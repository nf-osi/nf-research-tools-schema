  "methods": "Methods Hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines such as MHCC-1, MHCC97-H, SF7721, SMMC7721, Hep3B, and HepG2 were chosen in this study. We first examined the expression and the distribution of ezrin and F-actin in these cell lines using immunofluorescence, RT–PCR, and the western blot. Next we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) to down-regulate ezrin expression in MHCC-1, MHCC97-H, SF7721, and HepG2 to investigate the role of ezrin in tumor cell growth and invasiveness.",
