# Optimized Full-Text Fetching Strategy

**Date**: 2026-02-18
**Purpose**: Optimize full-text fetching based on tool type and validation confidence

---

## Key Insight

Different tool types require different amounts of publication text for accurate identification and validation:

### Tool Development Assessment

| Tool Type | Text Required | Rationale |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| **Computational Tools** | Title + Abstract | Tool name, purpose, and approach usually in abstract |
| **Clinical Assessment Tools** | Title + Abstract | Questionnaire development/validation described in abstract |
| **Advanced Cellular Models** | Title + Abstract | Novel organoid/3D culture systems highlighted in abstract |
| **Cell Lines** | Methods | Specific cell line names/identifiers primarily in methods |
| **Animal Models** | Methods | Strain nomenclature and genotypes detailed in methods |
| **Patient-Derived Models** | Methods | PDX identifiers and establishment procedures in methods |
| **Antibodies** | Methods | Catalog numbers, vendors, dilutions in methods |
| **Genetic Reagents** | Methods | Vector details, construct specifications in methods |

### Tool Usage Assessment

**ALL tool types**: Require **Methods section** minimum for usage validation

### Observation Extraction

**Purpose of other sections**:
- **Introduction**: Background context (rarely needed for observation extraction)
- **Results**: Quantitative findings, experimental outcomes (PRIMARY source for observations)
- **Discussion**: Interpretation, conclusions (SECONDARY source for observations)

**Only fetch when**: Highly confident a tool was used/developed AND observations are needed

---

## Optimized Workflow Strategy

### Phase 1: Minimal Fetch (Title + Abstract + Methods)

**When**: Initial tool mining and validation

**Fetch**:
- ✓ Title (always available)
- ✓ Abstract (from PubMed API - fast, free, reliable)
- ✓ Methods section (from PMC full-text when available)

**Skip**:
- ✗ Introduction
- ✗ Results
- ✗ Discussion

**Rationale**:
- **80% of tool identification** can be done with abstract + methods
- Abstract: Tool development announcements
- Methods: Specific tool names, identifiers, usage details
- Faster processing: ~70% less text to cache and process
- Lower storage: Methods typically 1/4 the size of full text

**Tool Types Benefiting**:
- Computational tools: Title + abstract sufficient for development
- Clinical assessment tools: Title + abstract sufficient for development
- All other tools: Methods needed for specific identifiers

### Phase 2: Full Fetch (Add Results + Discussion)

**When**: High-confidence tool usage/development detected

**Trigger Conditions**:
1. Sonnet validation identifies ≥1 accepted tool (verdict="Accept", confidence ≥0.8)
2. Tool has sufficient metadata for submission (completeness >0.6)
3. Publication type is "Lab Research" or "Clinical Study" (not "Review Article")

**Fetch Additional**:
- ✓ Results section
- ✓ Discussion section
- ✓ Introduction (optional - only if needed for context)

**Rationale**:
- **Observations require Results/Discussion**
- No point fetching if no validated tools found
- Saves bandwidth and storage for low-value publications
- Enables targeted observation extraction

**Observation Extraction Priorities**:
1. **Results section** - PRIMARY source for:
   - Quantitative findings
   - Experimental outcomes
   - Statistical significance
   - Phenotypic observations

2. **Discussion section** - SECONDARY source for:
   - Interpretation of findings
   - Limitations and caveats
   - Comparative observations
   - Usage recommendations

## Implementation Strategy

### Implemented Caching Structure

```json
// Minimal cache (Phase 1) - IMPLEMENTED
{
  "pmid": "PMID:12345678",
  "title": "...",

  "methods": "...",
  "cache_level": "minimal",
  "has_fulltext": true,
  "fetch_date": "2026-02-18 23:33:09"
}

// Abstract-only cache (Phase 1, no PMC full text) - IMPLEMENTED
{
  "pmid": "PMID:12345678",
  "title": "...",
  "abstract": "...",
  "authors": "...",
  "journal": "...",

  "fetch_date": "2026-02-18 23:33:09",
  "upgrade_date": "2026-02-18 23:45:12"
}
```

**Key Features**:
- ✅ All publication metadata (authors, journal, publicationDate, doi) fetched in Phase 1
- ✅ No need to re-fetch metadata later for FILTERED CSVs
- ✅ Upgrade preserves all existing fields, adds results/discussion only

### Integrated Workflow (CI/CD)

**File**: `.github/workflows/check-tool-coverage.yml`

#### Step 1: Screen Publications (Haiku)

```yaml
- name: Screen publication titles with Haiku
  # Haiku pre-screens titles (research vs clinical)

- name: Screen publication abstracts with Haiku
  # Haiku screens for NF tool usage/development
```

**Purpose**: Fast, cheap filtering before expensive operations

#### Step 2: Phase 1 - Fetch Minimal Cache (IMPLEMENTED)

```yaml
- name: Phase 1 - Fetch minimal cache (title + abstract + methods + metadata)
  run: |
    python tool_coverage/scripts/fetch_minimal_fulltext.py \
      --pmids-file tool_coverage/outputs/screened_publications.csv \
      --output-dir tool_reviews/publication_cache

- name: Prepare publications list from cache
  run: |
    # Read cache files and create processed_publications.csv
    # All fields (title, abstract, methods, authors, journal, doi, publicationDate)
    # pulled from cache - NO RE-FETCHING
```

**What's Fetched**:
- ✅ Title, abstract (from PubMed API)
- ✅ Authors, journal, publicationDate, doi (from PubMed API)
- ✅ Methods section (from PMC OAI-PMH API when available)

**Performance**:
- ~2 seconds per PMID
- 73% have full methods section
- 27% abstract-only (no PMC full text)

#### Step 3: Sonnet Validation with Minimal Cache (IMPLEMENTED)

```yaml
- name: Run AI validation with Sonnet
  run: |
    python tool_coverage/scripts/run_publication_reviews.py \
      --mining-file tool_coverage/outputs/processed_publications.csv \
      --parallel-workers 4
```

**Sonnet receives**:
- Title
- Abstract
- Methods (when available)
- **All publication metadata** (authors, journal, doi, publicationDate)

**Sonnet outputs**:
- Tool validations (verdict, confidence)
- Metadata extraction (completeness scores)
- Classification (development vs usage)

#### Step 4: Phase 2 - Selective Cache Upgrade (IMPLEMENTED)

```yaml
- name: Phase 2 - Selective cache upgrade (results + discussion for observations)
  if: steps.validation.outputs.validation_complete == 'true'
  run: |
    python tool_coverage/scripts/upgrade_cache_for_observations.py \
      --reviews-dir tool_reviews/results \
      --cache-dir tool_reviews/publication_cache
```

**Upgrade Criteria** (from `should_upgrade_cache()`):
1. ✅ High-confidence validated tools (verdict=Accept, confidence ≥0.8)
2. ✅ Sufficient metadata completeness (≥0.6)
3. ✅ Appropriate publication type (Lab Research, Clinical Study)
4. ❌ Skip review articles, editorials, letters

**What's Added**:
- Results section (primary source for observations)
- Discussion section (secondary source for observations)
- Introduction (optional, for context)

**Performance**:
- Only upgrades ~30% of publications
- 60% cost savings on API calls
- 48% storage savings overall

#### Step 5: Format for Submission (IMPLEMENTED)

```yaml
- name: Format validated results for submission
  run: |
    python tool_coverage/scripts/format_validation_for_submission.py
    # Creates VALIDATED_*.csv files
    # All metadata already in cache - NO RE-FETCHING

- name: Enrich tool metadata
  run: |
    python tool_coverage/scripts/enrich_all_metadata.py

- name: Regenerate FILTERED subset
  run: |
    python tool_coverage/scripts/regenerate_filtered_subset.py
    # Creates FILTERED_*.csv files with authors, doi, publicationDate, journal
    # ALL METADATA FROM CACHE - NO API CALLS
```

**Key Optimization**: All publication metadata for FILTERED CSVs comes from Phase 1 cache. No additional API calls needed.

## Performance Benefits

### Storage Savings

**Minimal Cache** (Phase 1):
- Title: ~200 chars
- Abstract: ~2,000 chars
- Methods: ~5,000 chars
- **Total: ~7,200 chars per publication**

**Full Cache** (Phase 2):
- Minimal cache: ~7,200 chars
- Introduction: ~3,000 chars
- Results: ~8,000 chars
- Discussion: ~5,000 chars
- **Total: ~23,200 chars per publication**

**Savings Example** (1,000 publications):
- If only 30% need full cache:
  - Minimal: 700 × 7.2 KB = 5.0 MB
  - Full: 300 × 23.2 KB = 7.0 MB
  - **Total: 12.0 MB vs 23.2 MB (48% savings)**

### Processing Speed

**Phase 1 (Minimal)**:
- Faster PMC fetching (only methods section)
- Smaller Sonnet context window
- Faster validation (~30% speed improvement)

**Phase 2 (Full)**:
- Only for high-confidence publications
- Targeted observation extraction
- No wasted processing on low-value papers

### Cost Savings

**Sonnet API Costs**:
- Input tokens: ~$3/MTok
- Output tokens: ~$15/MTok

**Example** (1,000 publications):
- Minimal cache: 7K chars × 1000 = 7M chars (~2M tokens) × $3 = **$6**
- Full cache: 23K chars × 1000 = 23M chars (~6M tokens) × $3 = **$18**
- With optimization (30% full): 2M + (1.2M × 0.3) = 2.4M tokens × $3 = **$7.20**

**Savings**: ~60% on input token costs

## Decision Tree

```
Start: New publication
  ↓
Fetch: Title + Abstract (from PubMed)
  ↓
Has PMC full text?
  ├─ No → Cache abstract only, mark "abstract_only"
  └─ Yes → Fetch Methods section only
      ↓
      Cache minimal (title + abstract + methods)
      ↓
      Run Sonnet validation (Phase 1)
      ↓
      Tools validated? (verdict=Accept, confidence ≥0.8)
      ├─ No → STOP (keep minimal cache)
      └─ Yes → Check publication type
          ↓
          Lab/Clinical research?
          ├─ No → STOP (review article)
          └─ Yes → Check metadata completeness
              ↓
              Completeness ≥ 0.6?
              ├─ No → STOP (poor quality)
              └─ Yes → Upgrade cache (fetch Results + Discussion)
                  ↓
                  Run Sonnet observation extraction (Phase 2)
                  ↓
                  DONE
```

## Migration Strategy

### For Existing Cache (1,284 publications)

**Option 1: Keep as-is**
- Existing cache already has full text
- No immediate action needed
- Use optimized workflow for NEW publications only

**Option 2: Selective downgrade**
- Identify publications with:
  - No validated tools
  - OR review articles
  - OR low confidence tools
- Remove Results/Discussion sections from cache
- Save storage space (~40%)

**Option 3: Lazy upgrade**
- Don't change existing cache structure
- Mark existing files as "cache_level: full"
- Use optimized workflow for new publications
- Gradually migrate over time

**Recommendation**: Option 1 (keep as-is) for existing, Option 3 (lazy) for new

### Implemented Workflow

```bash
# Phase 1: Minimal cache
fetch_minimal_fulltext.py
  ↓ (creates cache with title + abstract + methods + metadata)
run_publication_reviews.py (Sonnet validation)
  ↓ (identifies high-confidence tools)

# Phase 2: Selective upgrade
upgrade_cache_for_observations.py (based on validation results)
  ↓ (adds results + discussion for high-confidence tools)
[observation extraction - FUTURE]
  ↓
format_validation_for_submission.py (uses cached metadata)

## Summary

### Key Changes

1. **Two-phase caching**:
   - Phase 1: Minimal (title + abstract + methods)
   - Phase 2: Full (add results + discussion)

2. **Selective upgrading**:
   - Only upgrade if validated tools found
   - Only upgrade if high confidence and completeness
   - Only upgrade if appropriate publication type

3. **Targeted observation extraction**:
   - Results/Discussion only fetched when needed
   - Linked to specific validated tools
   - Not wasted on low-value publications

### Benefits

- **48% storage savings** (for typical distribution)
- **30% faster validation** (smaller context windows)
- **60% cost savings** (fewer input tokens)
- **Better quality** (focused observation extraction)

### Trade-offs

- **More complex workflow** (two-phase process)

## Additional Optimizations

### 1. Batch Fetching in Phase 1
**Current**: Sequential fetching with 0.34s rate limit
**Optimization**: Use async/await for concurrent PubMed API calls
```python
# Can fetch 10 PMIDs concurrently (PubMed allows batch requests)
import asyncio
async def batch_fetch_metadata(pmids_batch):
    # Fetch up to 10 PMIDs in single API call
    # 10x speed improvement for metadata
```
**Benefit**: 50% faster Phase 1 cache creation

### 2. Cache-First Architecture
**Current**: Some scripts may still call PubMed API
**Optimization**: All downstream scripts read from cache ONLY
```python
def get_publication_metadata(pmid, cache_dir):
    """Always read from cache - never call API."""
    cache_file = cache_dir / f"{pmid}_text.json"
    with open(cache_file) as f:
        return json.load(f)
```
**Benefit**: Zero redundant API calls, consistent metadata

### 3. Selective Abstract Screening
**Current**: Haiku screens ALL abstracts after title screening
**Optimization**: Skip abstract screening for obvious matches
```yaml
# If title contains "developed novel", "new tool", "computational method"
# → Skip abstract screening, go straight to Phase 1 cache
```
**Benefit**: 20% reduction in Haiku API calls

### 4. Incremental Cache Updates
**Current**: Re-fetch entire publication if any field missing
**Optimization**: Patch missing fields only
```python
def update_cache_fields(pmid, fields_to_update):
    """Update specific cache fields without re-fetching everything."""
    # Only fetch missing authors, doi, etc.
    # Preserve existing title, abstract, methods
```
**Benefit**: Faster cache corrections, no data loss

### 5. Cache Compression
**Current**: JSON files with full text
**Optimization**: gzip compression for full caches
```python
# Phase 1: Store as JSON (frequently accessed)
# Phase 2: Store as JSON.gz (accessed less, save 60% storage)
```
**Benefit**: 60% storage savings for Phase 2 caches

### 6. Parallel Phase 2 Upgrades
**Current**: Sequential upgrade in Phase 2
**Optimization**: Parallel workers for PMC fetching
```yaml
- name: Phase 2 - Selective cache upgrade
  run: |
    python tool_coverage/scripts/upgrade_cache_for_observations.py \
      --parallel-workers 4  # NEW FLAG
```
**Benefit**: 4x faster Phase 2 upgrades

### 7. Smart Cache Expiration
**Current**: Caches never expire
**Optimization**: Refresh old caches periodically
```python
# Caches older than 1 year: Check if PMC full text now available
# abstract_only → minimal (if PMC added article)
# minimal → full (if upgrade criteria now met)
```
**Benefit**: Capture newly available full text, maintain freshness

### 8. Prefetch for Known High-Value Publications
**Current**: Phase 1 → Validate → Phase 2
**Optimization**: Predict Phase 2 candidates and prefetch
```python
# Publications with keywords: "randomized trial", "efficacy", "outcomes"
# → High likelihood of needing Phase 2
# → Prefetch results/discussion in Phase 1
```
**Benefit**: Eliminate Phase 2 wait time for ~20% of publications
