10.1186/1471-2164-3-13,PMID:12057013,Complex splicing pattern generates great diversity in human NF1 transcripts.,"BACKGROUND: Mutation analysis of the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene has shown that about 30% of NF1 patients carry a splice mutation resulting in the production of one or several shortened transcripts. Some of these transcripts were also found in fresh lymphocytes of healthy individuals, albeit typically at a very low level. Starting from this initial observation, we were interested to gain further insight into the complex nature of NF1 mRNA processing. RESULTS: We have used a RT-PCR plasmid library based method to identify novel NF1 splice variants. Several transcripts were observed with specific insertions/deletions and a survey was made. This large group of variants detected in one single gene allows to perform a comparative analysis of the factors involved in splice regulation. Exons that are prone to skipping were systematically analysed for 5' and 3' splice site strength, branch point strength and secondary structure. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed a complex splicing pattern, generating a great diversity in NF1 transcripts. We found that, on average, exons that are spliced out in part of the mRNA have significantly weaker acceptor sites. Some variants identified in this study could have distinct roles and might expand our knowledge of neurofibromin.",BMC genomics,2002-05-24,Ina Vandenbroucke; Tom Callens; Anne De Paepe; Ludwine Messiaen

Surgical therapy can be applied only in selected patients with resectable masses. Hence, development of new therapies for this disease is urgent. We used human neurofibroma implants in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) as a model to test the toxicity and potential efficacy of pirfenidone, a new therapeutic agent. Two hundred twelve human neurofibromas were transplanted into various locations in 59 experimental animals, and 30 mice with implants received oral pirfenidone for up to six weeks. Survival of neurofibromas in animals treated with pirfenidone was lower than in the control group $(P=.02)$. Tumors did not change histologic appearance or vascularization in response to pirfenidone. Treatment with pirfenidone, a new antifibrotic agent, inhibits survival of some tumors without causing toxicity in animals.",Journal of biomedicine & biotechnology,2004,Dusica Babovic-Vuksanovic; Lydia Petrovic; Bruce E.

The hallmark of NF1 is the onset of heterogeneous (dermal or plexiform) benign neurofibromas. Plexiform neurofibromas can give rise to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), and the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. RESULTS: To obtain further insight into the molecular pathogenesis of MPNSTs, we used real-time quantitative RT-PCR to quantify the mRNA expression of 489 selected genes in MPNSTs, in comparison with plexiform neurofibromas. The expression of 28 (5.7%) of the 489 genes was significantly different between MPNSTs and plexiform neurofibromas; 16 genes were upregulated and 12 were downregulated in MPNSTs. The altered genes were mainly involved in cell proliferation (MKI67, TOP2A, CCNE2), senescence (TERT, TERC), apoptosis (BIRC5/Survivin, TP73) and extracellular matrix remodeling (MMP13, MMP9, TIMP4, ITGB4). More interestingly, other genes were involved in the Ras signaling pathway (RASSF2, HMMR/RHAMM) and the Hedgehog-Gli signaling pathway (DHH, PTCH2). Several of the down-regulated genes were Schwann cell-specific (L1CAM, MPZ, S100B, SOX10, ERBB3) or mast cell-specific (CMA1, TPSB), pointing to a depletion and/or dedifferentiation of Schwann cells and mast cells during malignant transformation of plexiform neurofibromas. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that a limited number of signaling pathways, and particularly the Hedgehog-Gli signaling pathway, may be involved in malignant transformation of plexiform neurofibromas. Some of the relevant genes or their products warrant further investigation as potential therapeutic targets in NF1.",Molecular cancer,2004-07-15,Pascale Lévy; Dominique Vidaud; Karen Leroy; Ingrid Laurendeau; Janine Wechsler; Giulia Bolasco; Béatrice Parfait; Pierre Wolkenstein; Michel Vidaud; Ivan Bièche
10.1093/hmg/ddl165,PMID:16835260,Nf1+/- mast cells induce neurofibroma like phenotypes through secreted TGF-beta signaling.,"Neurofibromas are common tumors found in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients. These complex tumors are composed of Schwann cells, mast cells, fibroblasts and perineurial cells embedded in collagen that provide a lattice for tumor invasion. Genetic studies demonstrate that in neurofibromas, nullizygous loss of Nf1 in Schwann cells and haploinsufficiency of Nf1 in non-neuronal cells are required for tumorigenesis. Fibroblasts are a major cellular constituent in neurofibromas and are a source of collagen that constitutes approximately 50% of the dry weight of the tumor. Here, we show that two of the prevalent heterozygous cells found in neurofibromas, mast cells and fibroblasts interact directly to contribute to tumor phenotype. Nf1+/- mast cells secrete elevated concentrations of the profibrotic transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). In response to TGF-beta, both murine Nf1+/- fibroblasts and fibroblasts from human neurofibromas proliferate and synthesize excessive collagen, a hallmark of neurofibromas. We also establish that the TGF-beta response occurs via hyperactivation of a novel Ras-c-abl signaling pathway. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of c-abl reverses fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis to wild-type levels. These studies identify a novel molecular target to inhibit neurofibroma formation.",Human molecular genetics,2006-08-15,Feng-Chun Yang; Shi Chen; Travis Clegg; Xiaohong Li; Trent Morgan; Selina A Estwick; Jin Yuan; Waleed Khalaf; Sarah Burgin; Jeff Travers; Luis F Parada; David A Ingram; D Wade Clapp

Although most meningiomas are benign, 10% are classified as atypical or anaplastic, displaying aggressive clinical behavior. Biallelic inactivation of the neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor is associated with meningioma formation in all NF2 patients and 60% of sporadic meningiomas. Deletion of the p16(INK4a)/p14(ARF) locus is found in both benign and malignant meningiomas, while mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene is uncommon. Previously, we inactivated Nf2 in homozygous conditional knockout mice by adenoviral Cre delivery and showed that Nf2 loss in arachnoid cells is rate-limiting for meningioma formation. Here, we report that additional nullizygosity for p16(Ink4a) increases the frequency of meningioma and meningothelial proliferation in these mice without modifying the tumor grade. In addition, by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to screen a large cohort of mutant mice, we were able to detect meningothelial proliferation and meningioma development opening the way to future studies in which therapeutic interventions can be tested as preclinical assessment of their potential clinical application.","Brain pathology (Zurich, Switzerland)",2008-01,Michel Kalamarides; Anat O Stemmer-Rachamimov; Masaya Takahashi; Zhi-Yan Han; Fabrice Chareyre; Michiko Niwa-Kawakita; Peter M Black; Rona S Carroll; Marco Giovannini
10.1016/j.ccr.2008.01.003,PMID:18242513,The loss of Nf1 transiently promotes self-renewal but not tumorigenesis by neural crest stem cells.,"Neurofibromatosis is caused by the loss of neurofibromin (Nf1), leading to peripheral nervous system (PNS) tumors, including neurofibromas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). A long-standing question has been whether these tumors arise from neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) or differentiated glia. Germline or conditional Nf1 deficiency caused a transient increase in NCSC frequency and self-renewal in most regions of the fetal PNS. However, Nf1-deficient NCSCs did not persist postnatally in regions of the PNS that developed tumors and could not form tumors upon transplantation into adult nerves. Adult P0a-Cre+Nf1(fl/-) mice developed neurofibromas, and Nf1(+/-)Ink4a/Arf(-/-) and Nf1/p53(+/-) mice developed MPNSTs, but NCSCs did not persist postnatally in affected locations in these mice.

10.1124/jpet.107.135830,PMID:18367665,Induction of apoptosis in neurofibromatosis type 1 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor cell lines by a combination of novel farnesyl transferase inhibitors and lovastatin.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder that is driven by the loss of neurofibromin (Nf) protein function. Nf contains a Ras-GTPase-activating protein domain, which directly regulates Ras signaling. Numerous clinical manifestations are associated with the loss of Nf and increased Ras activity. Ras proteins must be prenylated to traffic and functionally localize with target membranes. Hence, Ras is a potential therapeutic target for treating NF1. We have tested the efficacy of two novel farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs), 1 and 2, alone or in combination with lovastatin, on two NF1 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) cell lines, NF90-8 and ST88-14. Single treatments of 1, 2, or lovastatin had no effect on Ras prenylation or MPNST cell proliferation. However, low micromolar combinations of 1 or 2 with lovastatin (FTI/lovastatin) reduced Ras prenylation in both MPNST cell lines. Furthermore, this FTI/lovastatin combination treatment reduced cell proliferation and induced an apoptotic response as shown by morphological analysis, procaspase-3/-7 activation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and accumulation of cells with sub-G(1) DNA content. Little to no detectable toxicity was observed in normal rat Schwann cells following FTI/lovastatin combination treatment. These data support the hypothesis that combination FTI plus lovastatin therapy may be a potential treatment for NF1 MPNSTs.",The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,2008-07,Jonathan W Wojtkowiak; Farid Fouad; Daniel T LaLonde; Miriam D Kleinman; Richard A Gibbs; John J Reiners; Richard F Borch; Raymond R Mattingly
10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-07-0518,PMID:18413802,Sorafenib inhibits growth and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in malignant peripheral nerve sheath cells.,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are soft-tissue tumors with a very poor prognosis and largely resistant to chemotherapy. MPNSTs are characterized by activation of the Ras pathway by loss of tumor suppressor neurofibromatosis type 1. In view of this, MPNST may be susceptible to inhibition of the activated Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by the B-Raf inhibitor sorafenib. MPNST (MPNST and ST8814) and dedifferentiated liposarcoma (LS141 and DDLS) human tumor cell lines were characterized for Ras activation and B-Raf expression. Tumor cells were treated with sorafenib and examined for growth inhibition, inhibition of phospho-MEK, phospho-ERK, cell cycle arrest, and changes in cyclin D1 and pRb expression. MPNSTs were sensitive to sorafenib at nanomolar concentrations. This appeared to be due to inhibition of phospho-MEK, phospho-ERK, suppression of cyclin D1, and hypophosphorylation of pRb at the CDK4-specific sites, resulting in a G(1) cell cycle arrest. These effects were not seen in the liposarcoma cells, which either did not express B-Raf or showed decreased Ras activation. Small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of B-Raf in MPNSTs also induced a G(1) cell cycle arrest in these cells, with a marked inhibition of cyclin D1 expression and Rb phosphorylation, whereas depletion of C-Raf did not affect either. With growth inhibition at the low nanomolar range, sorafenib, by inhibiting the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, may prove to be a novel therapy for patients with MPNST.",Molecular cancer therapeutics,2008-04,Grazia Ambrosini; Haider S Cheema; Sharon Seelman; Allison Teed; Elliot B Sambol; Samuel Singer; Gary K Schwartz
10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-6867,PMID:18451155,Pten haploinsufficiency accelerates formation of high-grade astrocytomas.,"We previously reported that central nervous system (CNS) inactivation of Nf1 and p53 tumor suppressor genes in mice results in the development of low-grade to high-grade progressive astrocytomas. When the tumors achieve high grade, they are frequently accompanied by Akt activation, reminiscent of the frequent association of PTEN mutations in human high-grade glioma. In the present study, we introduced CNS heterozygosity of Pten into the Nf1/p53 astrocytoma model. Resulting mice had accelerated morbidity, shortened survival, and full penetrance of high-grade astrocytomas. Haploinsufficiency of Pten accelerated formation of grade 3 astrocytomas, whereas loss of Pten heterozygosity and Akt activation coincided with progression into grade 4 tumors. These data suggest that successive loss of each Pten allele may contribute to de novo formation of high-grade astrocytoma and progression into glioblastoma, respectively, thus providing insight into the etiology of primary glioblastoma. The presence of ectopically migrating neural stem/progenitor lineage cells in presymptomatic Pten-deficient mutant brains supports the notion that these tumors may arise from stem/progenitor cells.",Cancer research,2008-05-01,Chang-Hyuk Kwon; Dawen Zhao; Jian Chen; Sheila Alcantara; Yanjiao Li; Dennis K Burns; Ralph P Mason; Eva Y-H P Lee; Hong Wu; Luis F Parada
10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-07-2335,PMID:18483311,Effective in vivo targeting of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are chemoresistant sarcomas with poor 5-year survival that arise in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or sporadically. We tested three drugs for single and combinatorial effects on collected MPNST cell lines and in MPNST xenografts. The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 inhibitor RAD001 (Everolimus) decreased growth 19% to 60% after 4 days of treatment in NF1 and sporadic-derived MPNST cell lines. Treatment of subcutaneous sporadic MPNST cell xenografts with RAD001 significantly, but transiently, delayed tumor growth, and decreased vessel permeability within xenografts. RAD001 combined with the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib caused additional inhibitory effects on growth and apoptosis in vitro, and a small but significant additional inhibitory effect on MPNST growth in vivo that were larger than the effects of RAD001 with doxorubicin. RAD001 plus erlotinib, in vitro and in vivo, reduced phosphorylation of AKT and total AKT levels, possibly accounting for their additive effect. The results support the consideration of RAD001 therapy in NF1 patient and sporadic MPNST. The preclinical tests described allow rapid screening strata for drugs that block MPNST growth, prior to tests in more complex models, and should be useful to identify drugs that synergize with RAD001.",Molecular cancer therapeutics,2008-05,Gunnar Johansson; Yonatan Y Mahller; Margaret H Collins; Mi-Ok Kim; Takahiro Nobukuni; John Perentesis; Timothy P Cripe; Heidi A Lane; Sara C Kozma; George Thomas; Nancy Ratner
10.1001/jama.300.3.287,PMID:18632543,Effect of simvastatin on cognitive functioning in children with neurofibromatosis type 1: a randomized controlled trial.,"CONTEXT: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is among the most common genetic disorders that cause learning disabilities. Recently, it was shown that statin-mediated inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase restores the cognitive deficits in an NF1 mouse model. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of simvastatin on neuropsychological, neurophysiological, and neuroradiological outcome measures in children with NF1. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-two of 114 eligible children (54%) with NF1 participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted between January 20, 2006, and February 8, 2007, at an NF1 referral center at a Dutch university hospital. INTERVENTION: Simvastatin or placebo treatment once daily for 12 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were scores on a Rey complex figure test (delayed recall), cancellation test (speed), prism adaptation, and the mean brain apparent diffusion coefficient based on magnetic resonance imaging. Secondary outcome measures were scores on the cancellation test (standard deviation), Stroop color word test, block design, object assembly, Rey complex figure test (copy), Beery developmental test of visual-motor integration, and judgment of line orientation. Scores were corrected for baseline performance, age, and sex. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed between the simvastatin and placebo groups on any primary outcome measure: Rey complex figure test (beta = 0.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.36 to 0.56); cancellation test (beta = -0.19; 95% CI, -0.67 to 0.29); prism adaptation (odds ratio = 2.0; 95% CI, 0.55 to 7.37); and mean brain apparent diffusion coefficient (beta = 0.06; 95% CI, -0.07 to 0.20). In the secondary outcome measures, we found a significant improvement in the simvastatin group in object assembly scores (beta = 0.54; 95% CI, 0.08 to 1.01), which was specifically observed in children with poor baseline performance (beta = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.29 to 1.30). Other secondary outcome measures revealed no significant effect of simvastatin treatment. CONCLUSION: In this 12-week trial, simvastatin did not improve cognitive function in children with NF1.

METHODS: Vestibular schwannoma xenografts were established in the interscapular fat pad in nude mice for 4 weeks. Initially, a small cohort of animals was treated with the ErbB2 inhibitor trastuzumab or saline for 2 weeks. Animals also received bromodeoxyuridine injections to label proliferating cells. In a longer-term experiment, animals were randomized to receive trastuzumab, erlotinib (an ErbB kinase inhibitor), or placebo for 12 weeks. Tumor growth was monitored by magnetic resonance imaging during the treatment period. Cell death was analyzed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin end labeling of fragmented DNA. RESULTS: Tumors can be distinguished with T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging sequences. Trastuzumab significantly reduced the proliferation of VS cells compared with control (p < 0.01) as analyzed by bromodeoxyuridine uptake. Control tumors demonstrated slight growth during the 12-week treatment period. Both trastuzumab and erlotinib significantly reduced the growth of VS xenografts (p < 0.05). Erlotinib, but not trastuzumab, resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin end labeling of fragmented DNA-positive VS cells (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: In this preliminary study, the ErbB inhibitors trastuzumab and erlotinib decreased growth of VS xenografts in nude mice, raising the possibility of using ErbB inhibitors in the management of patients with schwannomas, particularly those with neurofibromatosis Type 2.","Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology",2008-09,J Jason Clark; Matthew Provenzano; Henry R Diggelmann; Ningyong Xu; Skylar S Hansen; Marlan R Hansen
10.1097/MLG.0b013e318177e20b,PMID:18670322,Vestibular schwannoma quantitative polymerase chain reaction expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors.,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Determine the role of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) expression in sporadic and neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2)-related vestibular schwannomas (VS). Growth and proliferation signaling in human VS tumorigenesis may play a key role in molecular therapeutic targeting. VS carry mutations of the NF2 gene encoding the tumor suppressor, merlin, which interacts with ErbB2 in Schwann cells, implicating ErbB receptors in VS tumorigenesis. ErbB receptor family members are overexpressed or constitutively activated in many human tumors, and are effective therapeutic targets in some human cancers. VS occur more frequently in women and are larger, more vascular, and demonstrate increased growth rates during pregnancy. ER and PR may play a role in ErbB pathway activation and VS progression. STUDY DESIGN: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for ER and PR messenger RNA was performed using greater auricular and vestibular nerve controls (n = 8), sporadic VS (n = 23), and NF2-related VS (n = 16) tissues. METHODS: The qRT-PCR data were normalized with standardization to a single constitutively expressed control gene, human cyclophylin. RESULTS: Reverse transcription of messenger RNA from control and tumor specimens followed by RT Q-PCR demonstrated differences in ER and PR gene expression between sporadic and NF2-related VS. CONCLUSIONS: ER and PR expression in VS might have implications for development of a VS-specific drug delivery system using antihormone and ErbB pathway small molecule inhibitors, due to crosstalk between these receptors. These signals may be critical for re-establishing ErbB-mediated cell density dependent growth inhibition.",The Laryngoscope,2008-08,Andrew K Patel; Thomas H Alexander; Ali Andalibi; Allen F Ryan; Joni K Doherty
10.1007/s11060-008-9721-3,PMID:18974932,A role for the p53 pathway in the pathology of meningiomas with NF2 loss.,"The neurofibromatosis 2 locus (NF2) is inactivated through mutation and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 40-65% of all sporadic meningiomas, while the role of the p53 tumor suppression pathway in meningioma initiation and progression is still unclear. This study aims to determine if a p53 codon 72 arginine-to-proline polymorphism, found to be correlated with cancer development and cancer patient survival in other tumors, is associated with sporadic meningioma initiation or progression. We investigated Pro72 incidence in a cohort of 92 sporadic meningiomas and analyzed its association with histological grade (WHO classification) and with NF2 LOH (determined using polymorphic microsatellite markers on 22q). The Pro72 allele was not found to be selected for in the cohort. However, in the subgroup of meningiomas with NF2 LOH and carrying Pro72, 50.0% had high grade tumors (WHO grades II and III) compared to only 14.3% of those without NF2 LOH (OR = 6.0, CI = 1.56-23.11, P = 0.012). The significant association occurred only when considering subgroups of meningiomas with or without NF2 LOH, suggesting that not including NF2 status when analyzing study cohorts may explain the variability seen in the literature where all meningiomas were grouped together. Our data suggests a role for the p53 pathway in the progression of meningiomas in which NF2 is inactivated, and highlights the importance of accounting for NF2 LOH in future studies of meningiomas and the p53 pathway.",Journal of neuro-oncology,2009-02,ZeNan Chang; Chin-Lin Guo; Iris Ahronowitz; Anat O Stemmer-Rachamimov; Mia MacCollin; Fabio P Nunes

Here, we report a novel protein-protein interaction between NF2 protein (merlin or schwannomin) and erythrocyte p55, also designated as MPP1. The p55 is a conserved scaffolding protein with postulated functions in cell shape, hair cell development, and neural patterning of the retina. The FERM domain of NF2 protein binds directly to p55, and surface plasmon resonance analysis indicates a specific interaction with a kD value of 3.7 nM. We developed a specific monoclonal antibody against human erythrocyte p55, and found that both p55 and NF2 proteins are colocalized in the non-myelin-forming Schwann cells. This finding suggests that the p55-NF2 protein interaction may play a functional role in the regulation of apico-basal polarity and tumor suppression pathways in non-erythroid cells.","Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)",2009-03,Pil-Soo Seo; Brendan J Quinn; Anwar A Khan; Lixiao Zeng; Christos G Takoudis; Toshihiko Hanada; Annalisa Bolis; Alessandra Bolino; Athar H Chishti
10.1002/glia.20845,PMID:19191334,Microarray analyses reveal regional astrocyte heterogeneity with implications for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-regulated glial proliferation.,"Numerous studies have suggested that astrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) exhibit molecular and functional heterogeneity. In this regard, astroglia from different CNS locations express distinct immune system, and neurotransmitter proteins, have varying levels of gap junction coupling and respond differently to injury. However, the relevance of these differences to human disease is unclear. As brain tumors in children arise in specific CNS locations, we hypothesized that regional astroglial cell heterogeneity might partly underlie the propensity for gliomas to arise in these areas. In this study, we performed high-density RNA microarray profiling on astrocytes from postnatal day 1 optic nerve, cerebellum, brainstem, and neocortex. We showed that astroglia from each region are molecularly distinct, and we were able to develop gene expression patterns that distinguish astroglia, but not neural stem cells, from these different brain regions. We next used these microarray data to determine whether brain tumor suppressor genes were differentially expressed in these distinct populations of astroglia. Interestingly, neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene expression was decreased at both the RNA and protein levels in neocortical astroglia relative to astroglia from the other brain regions. To determine the functional significance of this finding, we found increased astroglial cell proliferation in optic nerve, brainstem, and cerebellum, but not neocortex, following Nf1 inactivation in vitro and in vivo. These findings provide molecular evidence for CNS astroglial cell heterogeneity, and suggest that differences in tumor suppressor gene expression might contribute to the regional localization of human brain tumors.",Glia,2009-08-15,Tu-Hsueh Yeh; Da Yong Lee; Scott M Gianino; David H Gutmann

We used gene expression profiling to define transcriptional changes between primary normal Schwann cells (n = 10), NF1-derived primary benign neurofibroma Schwann cells (NFSCs) (n = 22), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (MPNST) cell lines (n = 13), benign neurofibromas (NF) (n = 26) and MPNST (n = 6). Dermal and plexiform NFs were indistinguishable. A prominent theme in the analysis was aberrant differentiation. NFs repressed gene programs normally active in Schwann cell precursors and immature Schwann cells. MPNST signatures strongly differed; genes up-regulated in sarcomas were significantly enriched for genes activated in neural crest cells. We validated the differential expression of 82 genes including the neural crest transcription factor SOX9 and SOX9 predicted targets. SOX9 immunoreactivity was robust in NF and MPSNT tissue sections and targeting SOX9 - strongly expressed in NF1-related tumours - caused MPNST cell death.

10.1097/MAO.0b013e3181d2777f,PMID:20195187,Merlin knockdown in human Schwann cells: clues to vestibular schwannoma tumorigenesis.,"HYPOTHESIS: To investigate the early events in molecular progression toward schwannoma tumorigenesis, we developed an in vitro model of human Schwann cell tumorigenesis by merlin knockdown. BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2)-related and sporadic vestibular schwannoma (VS) exhibit loss of functional merlin (schwannomin). After loss of merlin expression in the Schwann cell, the initial steps toward VS tumorigenesis are unknown. Merlin, a putative tumor suppressor protein, interacts with many cellular proteins, regulating their function. Among these are receptor tyrosine kinases, including the epidermal growth factor receptor family B (ErbB) family receptors epidermal growth factor receptor and ErbB2. Functional merlin interacts with and internalizes these growth factor receptors, silencing their proliferation and survival signaling. Deregulation of CD44, the cell adhesion/signaling molecule and cancer stem cell marker, has also been implicated in VS tumorigenesis. METHODS: Merlin knockdown was performed using small interfering RNA transfection into human Schwann cell primary cultures. Knockdown was confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR, immunofluorescence, and Western analysis. Expression profiles of ErbB, merlin, and the stem cell markers nestin and CD44 were examined in knockdowns. Proliferation rate was assessed with bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, and radiation sensitivity was assessed using the Annexin assay in knockdowns versus controls. RESULTS: Merlin knockdowns demonstrated increased proliferation rate, upregulation of epidermal growth factor receptor, ErbB2, and ErbB3, CD44, and nestin. Short-term merlin depletion had no effect on gamma irradiation sensitivity compared with controls. CONCLUSION: Merlin depletion results in deregulation of ErbB receptor signaling, promotes a dedifferentiated state, and increases Schwann cell proliferation, suggesting critical steps toward schwannoma tumorigenesis.","Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology",2010-04,Zana Ahmad; Carrie Maiorana Brown; Andrew K Patel; Allen F Ryan; Rutherford Ongkeko; Joni K Doherty

To determine the contribution of NF1 in bone healing, we assessed bone healing in the Nf1(ob) (-/-) conditional mouse model lacking Nf1 specifically in osteoblasts. A closed distal tibia fracture protocol and a longitudinal study design were used. During the 21- to 28-day postfracture period, callus volume, as expected, decreased in wild-type but not in Nf1(ob) (-/-) mice, suggesting delayed healing. At these two time points, bone volume (BV/TV) and volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) measured by 3D micro-computed tomography were decreased in Nf1(ob) (-/-) callus-bridging cortices and trabecular compartments compared with wild-type controls. Histomorphometric analyses revealed the presence of cartilaginous remnants, a high amount of osteoid, and increased osteoclast surfaces in Nf1(ob) (-/-) calluses 21 days after fracture, which was accompanied by increased expression of osteopontin, Rankl, and Tgfbeta. Callus strength measured by three-point bending 28 days after fracture was reduced in Nf1(ob) (-/-) versus wild-type calluses. Importantly, from a clinical point of view, this defect of callus maturation and strength could be ameliorated by local delivery of low-dose lovastatin microparticles, which successfully decreased osteoid volume and cartilaginous remnant number and increased callus BV/TV and strength in mutant mice. These results thus indicate that the dysfunctions caused by loss of Nf1 in osteoblasts impair callus maturation and weaken callus mechanical properties and suggest that local delivery of low-dose lovastatin may improve bone healing in NF1 patients.",Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,2010-07,Weixi Wang; Jeffry S Nyman; Heather E Moss; Gloria Gutierrez; Gregory R Mundy; Xiangli Yang; Florent Elefteriou

These oncogenic pathways, involving leukocytes and fibroblasts, are not readily applicable to brain tumors (glioma), and other mechanisms must account for microenvironmental influences on central nervous system tumorigenesis. Previous studies from our laboratories have used neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models to understand the spatial restriction of glioma formation to the optic pathway of young children. Based on our initial findings, we hypothesize that brain region-specific differences in cAMP levels account for the pattern of NF1 gliomagenesis. To provide evidence that low levels of cAMP promote glioma formation in NF1, we generated foci of decreased cAMP in brain regions where gliomas rarely form in children with NF1. Focal cAMP reduction was achieved by forced expression of phosphodiesterase 4A1 (PDE4A1) in the cortex of Nf1 GEM strains. Ectopic PDE4A1 expression produced hypercellular lesions with features of human NF1-associated glioma. Conversely, pharmacologic elevation of cAMP with the PDE4 inhibitor rolipram dramatically inhibited optic glioma growth and tumor size in Nf1 GEM in vivo. Together, these results indicate that low levels of cAMP in a susceptible Nf1 mouse strain are sufficient to promote gliomagenesis, and justify the implementation of cAMP-based stroma-targeted therapies for glioma.",Cancer research,2010-07-15,Nicole M Warrington; Scott M Gianino; Erin Jackson; Patricia Goldhoff; Joel R Garbow; David Piwnica-Worms; David H Gutmann; Joshua B Rubin

We found that low cAMP levels were sufficient for tumorigenesis in a mouse model of Neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1)-associated optic pathway glioma (OPG). We hypothesized that the distinct pattern of glioma in NF1 reflected spatiotemporal differences in CXCL12 effects on cAMP levels. Thus, we sought to alter the pattern of gliomagenesis through manipulation of CXCL12-CXCR4 pathway activation in Nf1 OPG mice. Forced CXCL12 expression induced glioma at a low frequency. Further, treatment of Nf1 OPG mice with AMD3100, a CXCR4 antagonist, did not attenuate glioma growth. Thus, it appears, CXCL12 alone cannot promote gliomagenesis in NF1 mice.",Journal of neuroimmunology,2010-07-27,Tao Sun; Scott M Gianino; Erin Jackson; David Piwnica-Worms; David H Gutmann; Joshua B Rubin
10.1371/journal.pone.0013791,PMID:21072183,p21-Activated kinases are required for transformation in a cell-based model of neurofibromatosis type 2.,"BACKGROUND: NF2 is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by development of bilateral vestibular schwannomas and other benign tumors in central nervous system. Loss of the NF2 gene product, Merlin, leads to aberrant Schwann cell proliferation, motility, and survival, but the mechanisms by which this tumor suppressor functions remain unclear. One well-defined target of Merlin is the group I family of p21-activated kinases, which are allosterically inhibited by Merlin and which, when activated, stimulate cell cycle progression, motility, and increased survival. Here, we examine the effect of Pak inhibition on cells with diminished Merlin function. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using a specific peptide inhibitor of group I Paks, we show that loss of Pak activity restores normal cell movement in cells lacking Merlin function. In addition, xenografts of such cells form fewer and smaller tumors than do cells without Pak inhibition. However, in tumors, loss of Pak activity does not reduce Erk or Akt activity, two signaling proteins that are thought to mediate Pak function in growth factor pathways. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that Pak functions in novel signaling pathways in NF2, and may serve as a useful therapeutic target in this disease.",PloS one,2010-11-02,Hoi Yee Chow; Dina Stepanova; Jennifer Koch; Jonathan Chernoff

Clinical observations suggest that the development of SMN correlates with radiation dose; however, this relationship has not been investigated systematically. We developed a novel procedure for administering fractionated cranial irradiation (CI) and investigated the incidence and spectrum of cancer in control and heterozygous Nf1 mutant mice irradiated to a moderate (15 Gy) or high dose (30 Gy). Heterozygous Nf1 inactivation cooperated with CI to induce solid tumors and myeloid malignancies, with mice developing many of the most common SMNs found in human patients. CI-induced malignancies segregated according to radiation dose as Nf1(+/-) mice developed predominately hematologic abnormalities after 15 Gy, whereas solid tumors predominated at 30 Gy, suggesting that radiation dose thresholds exist for hematologic and nonhematologic cancers. Genetic and biochemical studies revealed discrete patterns of somatic Nf1 and Trp53 inactivation and we observed hyperactive Ras signaling in many radiation-induced solid tumors. This technique for administering focal fractionated irradiation will facilitate mechanistic and translational studies of SMNs.",Cancer research,2011-01-01,Jean L Nakamura; Connie Phong; Emile Pinarbasi; Scott C Kogan; Scott Vandenberg; Andrew E Horvai; Bruce A Faddegon; Dorothea Fiedler; Kevan Shokat; Benjamin T Houseman; Richard Chao; Russell O Pieper; Kevin Shannon

Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that durable responses to rapamycin treatment in a genetically engineered mouse model of Nf1 optic glioma require 20 mg/kg/day, whereas only transient tumor growth suppression was observed with 5 mg/kg/day rapamycin despite complete silencing of ribosomal S6 activity. To gain clinically relevant insights into the mechanism underlying this dose-dependent effect, we used Nf1-deficient glial cells in vitro and in vivo. First, there was an exponential relationship between blood and brain rapamycin levels. Second, we show that currently used biomarkers of mTOR pathway inhibition (phospho-S6, phospho-4EBP1, phospho-STAT3, and Jagged-1 levels) and tumor proliferation (Ki67) do not accurately reflect mTOR target inhibition or Nf1-deficient glial growth suppression. Third, the incomplete suppression of Nf1-deficient glial cell proliferation in vivo following 5 mg/kg/day rapamycin treatment reflects mTOR-mediated AKT activation, such that combined 5 mg/kg/day rapamycin and PI3-kinase (PI3K) inhibition or dual PI3K/mTOR inhibition recapitulates the growth suppressive effects of 20 mg/kg/day rapamycin. These new findings argue for the identification of more accurate biomarkers for rapamycin treatment response and provide reference preclinical data for comparing human rapamycin levels with target effects in the brain.",Molecular cancer therapeutics,2011-02,Sutapa Banerjee; Scott M Gianino; Feng Gao; Uwe Christians; David H Gutmann

Spinal deformities are common skeletal manifestations in patients with NF1. To date, the mechanism of vertebral abnormalities remains unclear because of the lack of appropriate animal models for the skeletal manifestations of NF1. In the present study, we report a novel murine NF1 model, Nf1(flox/-);Col2.3Cre(+) mice. These mice display short vertebral segments. In addition, a significant reduction in cortical and trabecular bone mass of the vertebrae was observed in Nf1(flox/-);Col2.3Cre(+) mice as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT). Peak stress and peak load were also significantly reduced in Nf1(flox/-);Col2.3Cre(+) mice as compared to controls. Furthermore, the lumbar vertebrae showed enlargement of the inter-vertebral canal, a characteristic feature of lumbar vertebrae in NF1 patients. Finally, histologic analysis demonstrated increased numbers of osteoclasts and decreased numbers of osteoblasts in the vertebrae of Nf1(flox/-);Col2.3Cre(+) mice in comparison to controls. In summary, Nf1(flox/-);Col2.3Cre(+) mice demonstrate multiple structural and functional abnormalities in the lumbar vertebrae which recapitulate the dystrophic vertebral changes in NF1 patients.

There is increasing evidence that many cancers initiate through acquisition of genetic mutations (loss of intrinsic control) in stem cells or their progenitors, followed by alterations of the surrounding microenvironment (loss of extrinsic control). In neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), deregulation of Ras signaling results in development of multiple neurofibromas, complex tumors of the peripheral nerves. Neurofibromas arise from the Schwann cell lineage following loss of function at the NF1 locus, which initiates a cascade of interactions with other cell types in the microenvironment and additional cell autonomous modifications. In this study, we sought to identify whether a temporal ""window of opportunity"" exists during which cells of the Schwann cell lineage can give rise to neurofibromas following loss of NF1. We showed that acute loss of NF1 in both embryonic and adult Schwann cells can lead to neurofibroma formation. However, the embryonic period when Schwann cell precursors and immature Schwann cells are most abundant coincides with enhanced susceptibility to plexiform neurofibroma tumorigenesis. This model has important implications for understanding early cellular events that dictate neurofibroma development, as well as for the development of novel therapies targeting these tumors.",Cancer research,2011-07-01,Lu Q Le; Chiachi Liu; Tracey Shipman; Zhiguo Chen; Ueli Suter; Luis F Parada

NF1 and PTPN11 are molecular lesions associated with Neurofibromatosis Syndrome Type I (NF1 Syndrome) and Noonan's Syndrome, respectively. The occurrence of JMML is rare; even among those predisposed with these syndromes to development of disease, and secondary genetic events likely contribute to the development and progression of disease. In NF1 syndrome, loss of p53 function is a common event in solid tumors, but uncommon in JMML, suggesting that the p53 pathway may be modified by other events in this hematopoietic disorder. The work presented here investigates the possible role of the p19(Arf) (p19) tumor suppressor in development of MPD associated with Nf1 gene loss in mice. We find that Nf1 mutant hematopoietic cells with loss of p19 develop accelerated hematopoietic disease similar to acute leukemia with a variable phenotype. This suggests that p19 may play a role in development of JMML and evaluation of the human p19 homolog (p14(ARF)) in JMML may be informative.",American journal of hematology,2011-07,Stephen M Wiesner; Jennifer L Geurts; Miechaleen D Diers; Rachel J Bergerson; Diane E Hasz; Kelly J Morgan; David A Largaespada
10.1186/1741-7015-9-82,PMID:21726432,MIA is a potential biomarker for tumour load in neurofibromatosis type 1.,"BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a frequent genetic disease characterized by multiple benign tumours with increased risk for malignancy. There is currently no biomarker for tumour load in NF1 patients. METHODS: In situ hybridization and quantitative real-time polymerase reaction were applied to investigate expression of cartilage-specific genes in mice bearing conditional inactivation of NF1 in the developing limbs. These mice do not develop tumours but recapitulate aspects of NF1 bone dysplasia, including deregulation of cartilage differentiation. It has been recently shown that NF1 tumours require for their growth the master regulator of cartilage differentiation SOX9. We thus hypothesized that some of the cartilage-specific genes deregulated in an Nf1Prx1 mouse model might prove to be relevant biomarkers of NF1 tumours. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing expression of the SOX9 target gene product melanoma-inhibitory activity/cd-rap (MIA) in tumour and serum samples of NF1 patients. RESULTS: Increased expression of Mia was found in Nf1-deficient cartilage in mice. In humans, MIA was expressed in all NF1-related tumours and its serum levels were significantly higher in NF1 patients than in healthy controls. Among NF1 patients, MIA serum levels were significantly higher in those with plexiform neurofibromas and in those with large number of cutaneous (> 1,000) or subcutaneous (> 100) neurofibromas than in patients without such tumours. Most notably, MIA serum levels correlated significantly with internal tumour burden.

However, the role of presynaptic voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels mediating this release has not been investigated. We investigated whether Ca(2+) currents and transmitter release were affected by reduced neurofibromin in Nf1(+/-) mice. Hippocampal Ca(2+) current density was greater in neurons from Nf1(+/-) mice and a greater fraction of Ca(2+) currents was activated at less depolarized potentials. In addition, release of the excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate, was increased in neuronal cortical cultures from Nf1(+/-) mice. Dendritic complexity and axonal length were also increased in neurons Nf1(+/-) mice compared to wild-type neurons, linking loss of neurofibromin to developmental changes in hippocampal axonal/cytoskeletal dynamics. Collectively, these results show that altered Ca(2+) channel density and transmitter release, along with increased axonal growth may account for the abnormal nervous system functioning in NF1.",Translational neuroscience,2010-06,Yuying Wang; Joel M Brittain; Sarah M Wilson; Cynthia M Hingtgen; Rajesh Khanna

NCFC patients manifest varying degrees of cognitive impairment, but the developmental basis of their brain abnormalities remains largely unknown. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), an NCFC syndrome, is caused by loss-of-function heterozygous mutations in the NF1 gene, which encodes neurofibromin, a RAS GTPase-activating protein. Here, we show that biallelic Nf1 inactivation promotes Erk-dependent, ectopic Olig2 expression specifically in transit-amplifying progenitors, leading to increased gliogenesis at the expense of neurogenesis in neonatal and adult subventricular zone (SVZ). Nf1-deficient brains exhibit enlarged corpus callosum, a structural defect linked to severe learning deficits in NF1 patients.

Sorafenib has been tolerated with manageable toxicities in adults and children with refractory cancer. We conducted a separate study in this population. Monitoring long-term toxicities such as effects on growth and obtaining additional pharmacokinetic data were of importance due to the young age and long duration of therapy seen in previous phase I trials in children with NF1. PROCEDURE: Children ≥3 and ≤18-year-old with NF1 and inoperable PN were eligible. Sorafenib was administered orally twice daily for consecutive 28-day cycles. Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined from toxicities observed during the first three cycles. RESULTS: Nine children enrolled, median age 8 (6-12) years. At the starting 115 mg/m(2) /dose (n = 5), two experienced dose-limiting grade 3 pain in their PN. At the de-escalated 80 mg/m(2) /dose (n = 4), approximately 40% of the pediatric solid tumor MTD, two had dose-limiting toxicity (grade 3 rash and grade 4 mood alteration), exceeding the MTD. At 80 mg/m(2) /dose, the median AUC(0-12 hours) at steady-state was 39.5 µg hours/ml. Toxicities appeared to correspond with decreases in quality of life (QOL). No tumor shrinkage was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Children with NF1 and PN did not tolerate sorafenib at doses substantially lower than the MTD in children and adults with malignant solid tumors.

The lack of experimental models of SMNs has limited understanding of their pathogenesis. It is currently not possible to predict or prevent this devastating late complication. Individuals with neurofibromatosis I (NF1) are at increased risk of developing therapy-induced cancers for unclear reasons. To model SMNs, we replicated clinical radiotherapy and delivered fractionated abdominal irradiation to Nf1(+/-) and wild-type mice. Similar to irradiated cancer survivors, irradiated wild-type and Nf1(+/-) mice developed diverse in-field malignancies. In Nf1(+/-) mice, fractionated irradiation promoted both classical NF1-associated malignancies and malignancies unassociated with the NF1 syndrome but typical of SMNs. Nf1 heterozygosity potentiated the mutagenic effects of irradiation, as evidenced by the significantly reduced survival after irradiation and tumor development that was often characterized by synchronous primary tumors. Interestingly, diverse radiation-induced tumors arising in wild-type and Nf1(+/-) mice shared a genetic signature characterized by monoallelic loss of Nf1 and the adjacent Trp53 allele. These findings implicate Nf1 loss as mediating tumorigenesis in a broad range of cell types and organs extending beyond the classical NF1 tumor histologies. Examining clinical SMN samples, we found LOH of NF1 in SMNs from non-NF1 patients. Nf1 heterozygosity confers broad susceptibility to genotoxin-induced tumorigenesis, and this paradigm serves as an experimental platform for future studies of SMNs.",Cancer research,2012-12-15,Grace Choi; Brian Huang; Emile Pinarbasi; Steve E Braunstein; Andrew E Horvai; Scott Kogan; Smita Bhatia; Bruce Faddegon; Jean L Nakamura

These are benign nerve sheath tumours, which can transform into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNST). METHODS: The aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed microRNA (miRNA) in neurofibromas and MPNST obtained from patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 using microarray analysis. Differential expression was validated by reverse transcription quantitative-PCR, and functional studies were performed after transfection of miRNA oligonucleotide mimics into MPNST cells. RESULTS: Sixteen miRNA were significantly differentially expressed in MPNST compared with NF, and of these fourteen were downregulated in MPNST: these included miR-30e*, miR-29c*, miR-29c, miR-340*, miR-30c, miR-139-5p, miR-195, miR-151-5p, miR-342-5p, miR-146a, miR-150, miR-223, let-7 a and let-7 g with a false discovery rate of q=8.48E-03 for the least significant miRNA. In contrast, miR-210 and miR-339-5p were upregulated in MPNST compared with neurofibromas. Prediction softwares/algorithms identified a list of genes targeted by miR-29c including extracellular matrix genes and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, all of which are reported to be involved in cell migration and invasion. Functional studies in a MPNST cell line, sNF96.2, using a mimic of the mature miR-29c showed reduced invasion, whereas there was no change in proliferation. Zymography of the manipulated cells showed that MMP2 activity was also reduced when miR-29c expression was forced in sNF96.2. CONCLUSION: We provide evidence that reduction of miR-29c has a pivotal role in the progression of nerve sheath tumours and results by increasing the invasive/migratory properties of nerve sheath tumours.",British journal of cancer,2013-03-05,N Presneau; M Eskandarpour; T Shemais; S Henderson; D Halai; R Tirabosco; A M Flanagan

10.18632/oncotarget.793,PMID:23328114,Genomic imbalance of HMMR/RHAMM regulates the sensitivity and response of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour cells to aurora kinase inhibition.,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNST) are rare, hereditary cancers associated with neurofibromatosis type I. MPNSTs lack effective treatment options as they often resist chemotherapies and have high rates of disease recurrence. Aurora kinase A (AURKA) is an emerging target in cancer and an aurora kinase inhibitor (AKI), termed MLN8237, shows promise against MPNST cell lines in vitro and in vivo. Here, we test MLN8237 against two primary human MPNST grown in vivo as xenotransplants and find that treatment results in tumour cells exiting the cell cycle and undergoing endoreduplication, which cumulates in stabilized disease. Targeted therapies can often fail in the clinic due to insufficient knowledge about factors that determine tumour susceptibilities, so we turned to three MPNST cell-lines to further study and modulate the cellular responses to AKI. We find that the sensitivity of cell-lines with amplification of AURKA depends upon the activity of the kinase, which correlates with the expression of the regulatory gene products TPX2 and HMMR/RHAMM. Silencing of HMMR/RHAMM, but not TPX2, augments AURKA activity and sensitizes MPNST cells to AKI. Furthermore, we find that AURKA activity is critical to the propagation and self-renewal of sphere-enriched MPNST cancer stem-like cells. AKI treatment significantly reduces the formation of spheroids, attenuates the self-renewal of spheroid forming cells, and promotes their differentiation. Moreover, silencing of HMMR/RHAMM is sufficient to endow MPNST cells with an ability to form and maintain sphere culture.

Research in understanding the pathogenetic mechanisms of neurofibroma development has led to the use of new clinical trials for the treatment of NF1. One of the most important outcomes of a trial is improvement in quality of life, however, no condition specific HRQOL instrument for NF1 exists. The objective of this study was to develop an NF1 HRQOL instrument as a module of PedsQL™ and to test for its initial feasibility, internal consistency reliability and validity in adults with NF1. METHODS: The NF1 specific HRQOL instrument was developed using a standard method of PedsQL™ module development - literature review, focus group/semi-structured interviews, cognitive interviews and experts' review of initial draft, pilot testing and field testing. Field testing involved 134 adults with NF1. Feasibility was measured by the percentage of missing responses, internal consistency reliability was measured with Cronbach's alpha and validity was measured by the known-groups method. RESULTS: Feasibility, measured by the percentage of missing responses was 4.8% for all subscales on the adult version of the NF1-specific instrument. Internal consistency reliability for the Total Score (alpha =0.97) and subscale reliabilities ranging from 0.72 to 0.96 were acceptable for group comparisons. The PedsQL™ NF1 module distinguished between NF1 adults with excellent to very good, good, and fair to poor health status. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the initial feasibility, reliability and validity of the PedsQL™ NF1 module in adult patients. The PedsQL™ NF1 Module can be used to understand the multidimensional nature of NF1 on the HRQOL patients with this disorder.",Health and quality of life outcomes,2013-02-21,Kavitha Nutakki; Cynthia M Hingtgen; Patrick Monahan; James W Varni; Nancy L Swigonski

Using a Sleeping Beauty forward genetic screen, we identified several genes involved in canonical Wnt signaling as potential drivers of benign neurofibromas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). In human neurofibromas and MPNSTs, activation of Wnt signaling increased with tumor grade and was associated with downregulation of β-catenin destruction complex members or overexpression of a ligand that potentiates Wnt signaling, R-spondin 2 (RSPO2). Induction of Wnt signaling was sufficient to induce transformed properties in immortalized human Schwann cells, and downregulation of this pathway was sufficient to reduce the tumorigenic phenotype of human MPNST cell lines. Small-molecule inhibition of Wnt signaling effectively reduced the viability of MPNST cell lines and synergistically induced apoptosis when combined with an mTOR inhibitor, RAD-001, suggesting that Wnt inhibition represents a novel target for therapeutic intervention in Schwann cell tumors.",Cancer discovery,2013-06,Adrienne L Watson; Eric P Rahrmann; Branden S Moriarity; Kwangmin Choi; Caitlin B Conboy; Andrew D Greeley; Amanda L Halfond; Leah K Anderson; Brian R Wahl; Vincent W Keng; Anthony E Rizzardi; Colleen L Forster; Margaret H Collins; Aaron L Sarver; Margaret R Wallace; Stephen C Schmechel; Nancy Ratner; David A Largaespada

To identify genetic drivers of MPNST development, we used the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon-based somatic mutagenesis system in mice with somatic loss of transformation-related protein p53 (Trp53) function and/or overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Common insertion site (CIS) analysis of 269 neurofibromas and 106 MPNSTs identified 695 and 87 sites with a statistically significant number of recurrent transposon insertions, respectively. Comparison to human data sets identified new and known driver genes for MPNST formation at these sites. Pairwise co-occurrence analysis of CIS-associated genes identified many cooperating mutations that are enriched in Wnt/β-catenin, PI3K-AKT-mTOR and growth factor receptor signaling pathways. Lastly, we identified several new proto-oncogenes, including Foxr2 (encoding forkhead box R2), which we functionally validated as a proto-oncogene involved in MPNST maintenance.",Nature genetics,2013-07,Eric P Rahrmann; Adrienne L Watson; Vincent W Keng; Kwangmin Choi; Branden S Moriarity; Dominic A Beckmann; Natalie K Wolf; Aaron Sarver; Margaret H Collins; Christopher L Moertel; Margaret R Wallace; Bernat Gel; Eduard Serra; Nancy Ratner; David A Largaespada
10.1186/1479-5876-11-213,PMID:24040940,Molecular-guided therapy predictions reveal drug resistance phenotypes and treatment alternatives in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.,"BACKGROUND: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are rare highly aggressive sarcomas that affect 8-13% of people with neurofibromatosis type 1. The prognosis for patients with MPNST is very poor. Despite TOP2A overexpression in these tumors, doxorubicin resistance is common, and the mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance in MPNST are poorly understood. Molecular-guided therapy prediction is an emerging strategy for treatment refractory sarcomas that involves identification of therapy response and resistance mechanisms in individual tumors. Here, we report the results from a personalized, molecular-guided therapy analysis of MPNST samples. METHODS: Established molecular-guided therapy prediction software algorithms were used to analyze published microarray data from human MPNST samples and cell lines, with benign neurofibroma tissue controls. MPNST and benign neurofibroma-derived cell lines were used for confirmatory in vitro experimentation using quantitative real-time PCR and growth inhibition assays. Microarray data was analyzed using Affymetrix expression console MAS 5.0 method. Significance was calculated with Welch's t-test with non-corrected p-value < 0.05 and validated using permutation testing across samples. Paired Student's t-tests were used to compare relative EC50 values from independent growth inhibition experiments. RESULTS: Molecular guided therapy predictions highlight substantial variability amongst human MPNST samples in expression of drug target and drug resistance pathways, as well as some similarities amongst samples, including common up-regulation of DNA repair mechanisms. In a subset of MPNSTs, high expression of ABCC1 is observed, serving as a predicted contra-indication for doxorubicin and related therapeutics in these patients. These microarray-based results are confirmed with quantitative, real-time PCR and immunofluorescence. The functional effect of drug efflux in MPNST-derived cells is confirmed using in vitro growth inhibition assays. Alternative therapeutics supported by the molecular-guided therapy predictions are reported and tested in MPNST-derived cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the substantial molecular heterogeneity of MPNSTs and validate molecular-guided therapy predictions in vitro. The observed molecular heterogeneity in MPNSTs influences therapy prediction. Also, mechanisms involving drug transport and DNA damage repair are primary mediators of MPNST chemotherapy resistance. Together, these findings support the utility of individualized therapy in MPNST as in other sarcomas, and provide initial proof-of concept that individualized therapy prediction can be accomplished.",Journal of translational medicine,2013-09-17,Jacqueline D Peacock; David Cherba; Kevin Kampfschulte; Mallory K Smith; Noel R Monks; Craig P Webb; Matthew Steensma

We demonstrate that germline knockout of one allele of each of these genes causes accelerated onset and progression of asbestos-induced malignant mesothelioma compared with asbestos-exposed Nf2(+/-) or wild-type mice. Ascites from some Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice exhibited large tumor spheroids, and tail vein injections of malignant mesothelioma cells established from these mice, but not from Nf2(+/-) or wild-type mice, produced numerous tumors in the lung, suggesting increased metastatic potential of tumor cells from Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice. Intraperitoneal injections of malignant mesothelioma cells derived from Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice into severe combined immunodeficient mice produced tumors that penetrated the diaphragm and pleural cavity and harbored increased cancer stem cells (CSC). Malignant mesothelioma cells from Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice stained positively for CSC markers and formed CSC spheroids in vitro more efficiently than counterparts from wild-type mice. Moreover, tumor cells from Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice showed elevated c-Met expression/activation, which was partly dependent on p53-mediated regulation of miR-34a and required for tumor migration/invasiveness and maintenance of the CSC population. Collectively, these studies demonstrate in vivo that inactivation of Nf2 and Cdkn2a cooperate to drive the development of highly aggressive malignant mesotheliomas characterized by enhanced tumor spreading capability and the presence of a CSC population associated with p53/miR-34a-dependent activation of c-Met. These findings suggest that cooperativity between losses of Nf2 and Cdkn2a plays a fundamental role in driving the highly aggressive tumorigenic phenotype considered to be a hallmark of malignant mesothelioma.",Cancer research,2014-02-15,Craig W Menges; Yuwaraj Kadariya; Deborah Altomare; Jacqueline Talarchek; Erin Neumann-Domer; Yue Wu; Guang-Hui Xiao; Irina M Shapiro; Vihren N Kolev; Jonathan A Pachter; Andres J Klein-Szanto; Joseph R Testa

Currently, there are few prognostic factors that predict clinical manifestations or outcomes in patients, even in families with an identical NF1 gene mutation. In this study, we leveraged Nf1 genetically engineered mice (GEM) to define the potential role of sex as a clinically relevant modifier of NF1-associated neuronal dysfunction. METHODS: Deidentified clinical data were analyzed to determine the impact of sex on optic glioma-associated visual decline in children with NF1. In addition, Nf1 GEM were employed as experimental platforms to investigate sexually dimorphic differences in learning/memory, visual acuity, retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death, and Nf1 protein (neurofibromin)-regulated signaling pathway function (Ras activity, cyclic adenosine monophosphate [cAMP], and dopamine levels). RESULTS: Female patients with NF1-associated optic glioma were twice as likely to undergo brain magnetic resonance imaging for visual symptoms and 3× more likely to require treatment for visual decline than their male counterparts. As such, only female Nf1 GEM exhibited a decrement in optic glioma-associated visual acuity, shorter RGC axons, and attenuated cAMP levels. In contrast, only male Nf1 GEM showed spatial learning/memory deficits, increased Ras activity, and reduced dopamine levels. INTERPRETATION: Collectively, these observations establish sex as a major prognostic factor underlying neuronal dysfunction in NF1, and suggest that sex should be considered when interpreting future preclinical and clinical study results.",Annals of neurology,2014-02,Kelly A Diggs-Andrews; Jacquelyn A Brown; Scott M Gianino; Joshua B Rubin; David F Wozniak; David H Gutmann
10.1186/1471-2407-14-6,PMID:24386979,"Modulation of Ras signaling alters the toxicity of hydroquinone, a benzene metabolite and component of cigarette smoke.","BACKGROUND: Benzene is an established human leukemogen, with a ubiquitous environmental presence leading to significant population exposure. In a genome-wide functional screen in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, inactivation of IRA2, a yeast ortholog of the human tumor suppressor gene NF1 (Neurofibromin), enhanced sensitivity to hydroquinone, an important benzene metabolite. Increased Ras signaling is implicated as a causal factor in the increased pre-disposition to leukemia of individuals with mutations in NF1. METHODS: Growth inhibition of yeast by hydroquinone was assessed in mutant strains exhibiting varying levels of Ras activity. Subsequently, effects of hydroquinone on both genotoxicity (measured by micronucleus formation) and proliferation of WT and Nf1 null murine hematopoietic precursors were assessed. RESULTS: Here we show that the Ras status of both yeast and mammalian cells modulates hydroquinone toxicity, indicating potential synergy between Ras signaling and benzene toxicity. Specifically, enhanced Ras signaling increases both hydroquinone-mediated growth inhibition in yeast and genotoxicity in mammalian hematopoetic precursors as measured by an in vitro erythroid micronucleus assay. Hydroquinone also increases proliferation of CFU-GM progenitor cells in mice with Nf1 null bone marrow relative to WT, the same cell type associated with benzene-associated leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Together our findings show that hydroquinone toxicity is modulated by Ras signaling. Individuals with abnormal Ras signaling could be more vulnerable to developing myeloid diseases after exposure to benzene. We note that hydroquinone is used cosmetically as a skin-bleaching agent, including by individuals with cafe-au-lait spots (which may be present in individuals with neurofibromatosis who have a mutation in NF1), which could be unadvisable given our findings.",BMC cancer,2014-01-05,Matthew North; Joe Shuga; Michele Fromowitz; Alexandre Loguinov; Kevin Shannon; Luoping Zhang; Martyn T Smith; Chris D Vulpe

To determine the mechanisms underlying bone fragility in NF1 we analyzed two conditional mouse models, Nf1Prx1 (limb knock-out) and Nf1Col1 (osteoblast specific knock-out), as well as cortical bone samples from individuals with NF1. We examined mouse bone tissue with micro-computed tomography, qualitative and quantitative histology, mechanical tensile analysis, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM). In cortical bone of Nf1Prx1 mice we detected ectopic blood vessels that were associated with diaphyseal mineralization defects. Defective mineral binding in the proximity of blood vessels was most likely due to impaired bone collagen formation, as these areas were completely devoid of acidic matrix proteins and contained thin collagen fibers. Additionally, we found significantly reduced mechanical strength of the bone material, which was partially caused by increased osteocyte volume. Consistent with these observations, bone samples from individuals with NF1 and tibial dysplasia showed increased osteocyte lacuna volume. Reduced mechanical properties were associated with diminished matrix stiffness, as determined by SAM. In line with these observations, bone tissue from individuals with NF1 and tibial dysplasia showed heterogeneous mineralization and reduced collagen fiber thickness and packaging. Collectively, the data indicate that bone fragility in NF1 tibial dysplasia is partly due to an increased osteocyte-related micro-porosity, hypomineralization, a generalized defect of organic matrix formation, exacerbated in the regions of tensional and bending force integration, and finally persistence of ectopic blood vessels associated with localized macro-porotic bone lesions.",PloS one,2014,Jirko Kühnisch; Jong Seto; Claudia Lange; Susanne Schrof; Sabine Stumpp; Karolina Kobus; Julia Grohmann; Nadine Kossler; Peter Varga; Monika Osswald; Denise Emmerich; Sigrid Tinschert; Falk Thielemann; Georg Duda; Wenke Seifert; Thaqif El Khassawna; David A Stevenson; Florent Elefteriou; Uwe Kornak; Kay Raum; Peter Fratzl; Stefan Mundlos; Mateusz Kolanczyk

Using transcriptome analysis we identified MAF as an NF1- regulated transcription factor and verified MAF regulation through RAS/MAPK/AP-1 signaling in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) cell lines. MAF was also downregulated in human MPNST. Acute re-expression of MAF promoted expression of glial differentiation markers in MPNST cells in vitro, decreased self-renewal of embryonic precursors and transiently affected tumor cell phenotypes in vitro by increasing MPNST cell death and reducing metabolic activity and anchorage-independent growth. Paradoxically, chronic MAF overexpression enhanced MPNST cell tumor growth in vivo, correlating with elevated pS6 in vitro and in vivo. RAD001 blocked MAF-mediated tumor growth, and MAF regulated the mTOR pathway through DEPTOR.

We investigated the neural mechanisms underlying the visual deficits of children and adolescents with NF1 by studying visual evoked potentials (VEPs) and brain oscillations during visual stimulation and rest periods. METHODS: Electroencephalogram/event-related potential (EEG/ERP) responses were measured during visual processing (NF1 n = 17; controls n = 19) and idle periods with eyes closed and eyes open (NF1 n = 12; controls n = 14). Visual stimulation was chosen to bias activation of the three detection mechanisms: achromatic, red-green and blue-yellow. RESULTS: We found significant differences between the groups for late chromatic VEPs and a specific enhancement in the amplitude of the parieto-occipital alpha amplitude both during visual stimulation and idle periods. Alpha modulation and the negative influence of alpha oscillations in visual performance were found in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest abnormal later stages of visual processing and enhanced amplitude of alpha oscillations supporting the existence of deficits in basic sensory processing in NF1. Given the link between alpha oscillations, visual perception and attention, these results indicate a neural mechanism that might underlie the visual sensitivity deficits and increased lapses of attention observed in individuals with NF1.",Journal of neurodevelopmental disorders,2014-02-21,Maria J Ribeiro; Otília C d'Almeida; Fabiana Ramos; Jorge Saraiva; Eduardo D Silva; Miguel Castelo-Branco

Merlin, the product of the Neurofibromatosis 2 tumor suppressor gene, has been extensively studied to understand its functions in growth control. Here we describe experiments in which we used Drosophila as an in vivo system to test the functions of the normal human NF2 gene products and patient-derived mutant alleles. Although the predominant NF2 gene isoform, isoform 1, could functionally replace the Drosophila Merlin gene, a second isoform with a distinct C-terminal tail could not. Immunofluorescence studies show that the two isoforms have distinct subcellular localizations when expressed in the polarized imaginal epithelium, and function in genetic rescue assays correlates with apical localization of the NF2 protein. Interestingly, we found that a patient-derived missense allele, NF2L64P, appears to be temperature sensitive.

The disease-focused NF2 impact on quality of life (NFTI-QOL) patient questionnaire was assessed as an outcome measure for treatment in a multi-centre study. NFTI-QOL was related to clinician-rated severity (ClinSev) and genetic severity (GenSev) over repeated visits. Data were evaluated for 288 NF2 patients (n = 464 visits) attending the English national NF2 clinics from 2010 to 2012. The male-to-female ratio was equal and the mean age was 42.2 (SD 17.8) years. The analysis included NFTI-QOL eight-item score, ClinSev graded as mild, moderate, or severe, and GenSev as a rank order of the number of NF2 mutations (graded as mild, moderate, severe). The mean (SD) 8.7 (5.4) score for NFTI-QOL for either a first visit or all visits 9.2 (5.4) was similar to the published norm of 9.4 (5.5), with no significant relationships with age or gender. NFTI-QOL internal reliability was good, with a Cronbach's alpha score of 0.85 and test re-test reliability r = 0.84. NFTI related to ClinSev (r = 0.41, p < 0.001; r = 0.46 for all visits), but weakly to GenSev (r = 0.16, p < 0.05; r = 0.15 for all visits). ClinSev related to GenSev (r = 0.41, p < 0.001; r = 0.42 for all visits). NFTI-QOL showed a good reliability and ability to detect significant longitudinal changes in the QOL of individuals.

10.18632/oncotarget.1609,PMID:24681606,Co-targeting the MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways in two genetically engineered mouse models of schwann cell tumors reduces tumor grade and multiplicity.,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are soft tissue sarcomas that occur spontaneously, or from benign plexiform neurofibromas, in the context of the genetic disorder Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1). The current standard treatment includes surgical resection, high-dose chemotherapy, and/or radiation. To date, most targeted therapies have failed to demonstrate effectiveness against plexiform neurofibromas and MPNSTs. Recently, several studies suggested that the mTOR and MAPK pathways are involved in the formation and progression of MPNSTs. Everolimus (RAD001) inhibits the mTOR and is currently FDA approved for several types of solid tumors. PD-0325901 (PD-901) inhibits MEK, a component of the MAPK pathway, and is currently in clinical trials. Here, we show in vitro than MPNST cell lines are more sensitive to inhibition of cellular growth by Everolimus and PD-901 than immortalized human Schwann cells. In combination, these drugs synergistically inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis. In two genetically engineered mouse models of MPNST formation, modeling both sporadic and NF1-associated MPNSTs, Everolimus, or PD-901 treatment alone each transiently reduced tumor burden and size, and extended lifespan. However, prolonged treatment of each single agent resulted in the development of resistance and reactivation of target pathways. Combination therapy using Everolimus and PD-901 had synergistic effects on reducing tumor burden and size, and increased lifespan. Combination therapy allowed persistent and prolonged reduction in signaling through both pathways. These data suggest that co-targeting mTOR and MEK may be effective in patients with sporadic or NF1-associated MPNSTs.",Oncotarget,2014-03-30,Adrienne L Watson; Leah K Anderson; Andrew D Greeley; Vincent W Keng; Eric P Rahrmann; Amanda L Halfond; Natasha M Powell; Margaret H Collins; Tilat Rizvi; Christopher L Moertel; Nancy Ratner; David A Largaespada

The primary objective of this open label, single arm phase II trial was to evaluate the activity of pirfenidone in children and young adults with inoperable PN. PROCEDURE: Patients (3-21 years) with NF1-related progressive PN received pirfenidone at the previously determined optimal dose (500 mg/m(2) orally, q8h) on a continuous dosing schedule (one cycle = 28 days). Volumetric MRI analysis was used to assess response. Progression was defined as ≥ 20% PN volume increase compared to baseline. Pirfenidone would be considered active if it doubled the median time to progression (TTP) compared to the TTP on the placebo arm of a phase II trial with the farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib, which used near identical eligibility criteria. Toxicities, objective response rate, and quality of life (QOL) also were evaluated. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were enrolled and tolerated pirfenidone well with intermittent nausea and vomiting as the most frequent toxicities. A dose reduction was required in only three patients. The median TTP for pirfenidone was 13.2 months compared to 10.6 months for the placebo control group from the tipifarnib trial (two-tailed P = 0.92; one-tailed P = 0.46). No objective responses were observed.

Whereas many spinal ependymomas exhibit indolent behavior, the only treatment option for clinically symptomatic tumors is surgery. In this regard, medical therapies are unfortunately lacking due to an incomplete understanding of the critical growth control pathways that govern the function of spinal cord (SC) neural progenitor cells (NPCs). METHODS: To identify potential therapeutic targets for these tumors, we leveraged primary mouse Nf2-deficient spinal cord neural progenitor cells. RESULTS: We demonstrate that the Nf2 protein, merlin, negatively regulates spinal neural progenitor cell survival and glial differentiation in an ErbB2-dependent manner, and that NF2-associated spinal ependymomas exhibit increased ErbB2 activation. Moreover, we show that Nf2-deficient SC NPC ErbB2 activation results from Rac1-mediated ErbB2 retention at the plasma membrane.

Current treatment modalities have been largely ineffective, resulting in a high rate of MPNST recurrence and poor five-year patient survival. This necessitates the exploration of alternative chemotherapeutic options for MPNST patients. This study sought to assess the cytotoxic effect of the BH3-mimetic AT101 [(-)-gossypol] on MPNST cells in vitro and to identify key regulators of AT101-induced MPNST cell death. We found that AT101 caused caspase-independent, non-apoptotic MPNST cell death, which was accompanied by autophagy and was mediated through HIF-1α induced expression of the atypical BH3-only protein BNIP3. These effects were mediated by intracellular iron chelation, a previously unreported mechanism of AT101 cytotoxicity.",PloS one,2014,Niroop Kaza; Latika Kohli; Christopher D Graham; Barbara J Klocke; Steven L Carroll; Kevin A Roth

Because Merlin has high level of sequence similarity to the Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin family of proteins, the structural model of Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin protein autoinhibition and cycling between closed/resting and open/active conformational states is often employed to explain Merlin function. However, recent biochemical studies suggest alternative molecular models of Merlin function. Here, we have determined the low-resolution molecular structure and binding activity of Merlin and a Merlin(S518D) mutant that mimics the inactivating phosphorylation at S518 using small-angle neutron scattering and binding experiments. Small-angle neutron scattering shows that, in solution, both Merlin and Merlin(S518D) adopt a closed conformation, but binding experiments indicate that a significant fraction of either Merlin or Merlin(S518D) is capable of binding to the target protein NHERF1. Upon binding to the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate lipid, the wild-type Merlin adopts a more open conformation than in solution, but Merlin(S518D) remains in a closed conformation. This study supports a rheostat model of Merlin in NHERF1 binding and contributes to resolving a controversy about the molecular conformation and binding activity of Merlin.",Journal of molecular biology,2014-07-29,Jahan Ali Khajeh; Jeong Ho Ju; Moussoubaou Atchiba; Marc Allaire; Christopher Stanley; William T Heller; David J E Callaway; Zimei Bu
10.1002/jbmr.2298,PMID:24932921,Neurofibromin deficiency-associated transcriptional dysregulation suggests a novel therapy for tibial pseudoarthrosis in NF1.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in NF1. Among the earliest manifestations is tibial pseudoarthrosis and persistent nonunion after fracture. To further understand the pathogenesis of pseudoarthrosis and the underlying bone remodeling defect, pseudoarthrosis tissue and cells cultured from surgically resected pseudoarthrosis tissue from NF1 individuals were analyzed using whole-exome and whole-transcriptome sequencing as well as genomewide microarray analysis. Genomewide analysis identified multiple genetic mechanisms resulting in somatic biallelic NF1 inactivation; no other genes with recurring somatic mutations were identified. Gene expression profiling identified dysregulated pathways associated with neurofibromin deficiency, including phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. Unlike aggressive NF1-associated malignancies, tibial pseudoarthrosis tissue does not harbor a high frequency of somatic mutations in oncogenes or other tumor-suppressor genes, such as p53. However, gene expression profiling indicates that pseudoarthrosis tissue has a tumor-promoting transcriptional pattern, despite lacking tumorigenic somatic mutations. Significant overexpression of specific cancer-associated genes in pseudoarthrosis highlights a potential for receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors to target neurofibromin-deficient pseudoarthrosis and promote proper bone remodeling and fracture healing.",Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,2014-12,Nandina Paria; Tae-Joon Cho; In Ho Choi; Nobuhiro Kamiya; Kay Kayembe; Rong Mao; Rebecca L Margraf; Gerlinde Obermosser; Ila Oxendine; David W Sant; Mi Hyun Song; David A Stevenson; David H Viskochil; Carol A Wise; Harry K W Kim; Jonathan J Rios
10.1186/gb-2014-15-6-r80,PMID:24958239,SVA retrotransposon insertion-associated deletion represents a novel mutational mechanism underlying large genomic copy number changes with non-recurrent breakpoints.,"BACKGROUND: Genomic disorders are caused by copy number changes that may exhibit recurrent breakpoints processed by nonallelic homologous recombination. However, region-specific disease-associated copy number changes have also been observed which exhibit non-recurrent breakpoints. The mechanisms underlying these non-recurrent copy number changes have not yet been fully elucidated. RESULTS: We analyze large NF1 deletions with non-recurrent breakpoints as a model to investigate the full spectrum of causative mechanisms, and observe that they are mediated by various DNA double strand break repair mechanisms, as well as aberrant replication. Further, two of the 17 NF1 deletions with non-recurrent breakpoints, identified in unrelated patients, occur in association with the concomitant insertion of SINE/variable number of tandem repeats/Alu (SVA) retrotransposons at the deletion breakpoints. The respective breakpoints are refractory to analysis by standard breakpoint-spanning PCRs and are only identified by means of optimized PCR protocols designed to amplify across GC-rich sequences. The SVA elements are integrated within SUZ12P intron 8 in both patients, and were mediated by target-primed reverse transcription of SVA mRNA intermediates derived from retrotranspositionally active source elements. Both SVA insertions occurred during early postzygotic development and are uniquely associated with large deletions of 1 Mb and 867 kb, respectively, at the insertion sites. CONCLUSIONS: Since active SVA elements are abundant in the human genome and the retrotranspositional activity of many SVA source elements is high, SVA insertion-associated large genomic deletions encompassing many hundreds of kilobases could constitute a novel and as yet under-appreciated mechanism underlying large-scale copy number changes in the human genome.",Genome biology,2014-06-02,Julia Vogt; Kathrin Bengesser; Kathleen B M Claes; Katharina Wimmer; Victor-Felix Mautner; Rick van Minkelen; Eric Legius; Hilde Brems; Meena Upadhyaya; Josef Högel; Conxi Lazaro; Thorsten Rosenbaum; Simone Bammert; Ludwine Messiaen; David N Cooper; Hildegard Kehrer-Sawatzki
10.1186/1479-7364-8-10,PMID:24980480,Novel age-dependent targets in vestibular schwannomas.,"BACKGROUND: Schwannomas are the most common neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2)-associated tumors with significant phenotypic heterogeneity in patients. The most severe subtype has an early and rapid progression and the mild type has a later onset and a less aggressive course. The aim of this study was to elucidate the underlying molecular differences between these groups. We compared the gene expression pattern between patients with early to late age of onset. RESULTS: A gene signature of 21 genes was constructed to differentiate between early-onset and late-onset patients. We confirmed these results by real-time PCR for SNF1LK2, NGFRAP1L1 (BEX 5), GMNN, and EPHA2. CONCLUSION: Genes identified here may be additional aberrations in merlin-depleted cells that govern the disease onset. A significant number of these genes have been suggested as having a role in carcinogenesis and are used as biomarkers for prognosis in several other cancers. The role of these genes in NF2 carcinogenesis and their potential as biomarkers or drug target are worthwhile exploring.",Human genomics,2014-06-30,Amos Toren; Juergen K Reichardt; Ali Andalibi; Nancy Ya-Hsuan Hsu; Joni Doherty; William Slattery; Ruty Mehrian-Shai
10.3389/fonc.2014.00147,PMID:25003081,An integrative analysis of meningioma tumors reveals the determinant genes and pathways of malignant transformation.,"Meningiomas are frequent central nervous system neoplasms, which despite their predominant benignity, show sporadically malignant behavior. Type 2 neurofibromatosis and polymorphisms in several genes have been associated with meningioma risk and are probably involved in its pathogenesis. Although GWAS studies have found loci related to meningioma risk, little is known about the factors determining malignant transformation. Thus, this study is aimed to identify the genomic and transcriptomic factors influencing evolution from benignity toward aggressive phenotypes. By applying an integrative bioinformatics pipeline combining public information on a wealth of biological layers of complexity (from genetic polymorphisms to protein interactions), this study identified a module of co-expressed genes highly correlated with tumor stage and statistically linked to several genomic regions (module Quantitative Trait Loci, mQTLs). Ontology analysis of the transcription hub genes identified microtubule-associated cell-cycle processes as key drivers of such network. mQTLs and single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with meningioma stage were replicated in an alternative meningioma cohort, and integration of these results with up-to-date scientific literature and several databases retrieved a list of genes and pathways with a potentially important role in meningioma malignancy. As a result, cytoskeleton and cell-cell adhesion pathways, calcium-channels and glutamate receptors, as well as oxidoreductase and endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathways were found to be the most important and redundant findings associated to meningioma progression. This study presents an integrated view of the pathways involved in meningioma malignant conversion and paves the way for the development of new research lines that will improve our understanding of meningioma biology.",Frontiers in oncology,2014,José Carlos Iglesias Gómez; Adrián Mosquera Orgueira

In addition to glial cell-derived tumors in the PNS and CNS, disease-related lesions also affect the skin and the eyes. Furthermore, 60% of NF2 patients suffer from peripheral nerve damage, clinically referred to as peripheral neuropathy. Strikingly, NF2-associated neuropathy often occurs in the absence of nerve damaging tumors, suggesting tumor-independent events. Recent findings indicate an important role of merlin in neuronal cell types concerning neuromorphogenesis, axon structure maintenance and communication between axons and Schwann cells. In this review, we compile clinical and experimental evidences for the underestimated role of the tumor suppressor merlin in the neuronal compartment.",Acta neuropathologica communications,2014-07-12,Alexander Schulz; Ansgar Zoch; Helen Morrison

We found that derepressed CRL4(DCAF1) promotes YAP- and TEAD-dependent transcription by ubiquitylating and, thereby, inhibiting Lats1 and 2 in the nucleus. Genetic epistasis experiments and analysis of tumor-derived missense mutations indicate that this signaling connection sustains the oncogenicity of Merlin-deficient tumor cells. Analysis of clinical samples confirms that this pathway operates in NF2-mutant tumors.

10.1038/onc.2014.185,PMID:25043298,Oncogenic role of Merlin/NF2 in glioblastoma.,"Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults, with a poor prognosis because of its resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Merlin/NF2 (moesin-ezrin-radixin-like protein/neurofibromatosis type 2) is a tumor suppressor found to be mutated in most nervous system tumors; however, it is not mutated in glioblastomas. Merlin associates with several transmembrane receptors and intracellular proteins serving as an anchoring molecule. Additionally, it acts as a key component of cell motility. By selecting sub-populations of U251 glioblastoma cells, we observed that high expression of phosphorylated Merlin at serine 518 (S518-Merlin), NOTCH1 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) correlated with increased cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. These cells were defective in cell-contact inhibition with changes in Merlin phosphorylation directly affecting NOTCH1 and EGFR expression, as well as downstream targets HES1 (hairy and enhancer of split-1) and CCND1 (cyclin D1). Of note, we identified a function for S518-Merlin, which is distinct from what has been reported when the expression of Merlin is diminished in relation to EGFR and NOTCH1 expression, providing first-time evidence that demonstrates that the phosphorylation of S518-Merlin in glioblastoma promotes oncogenic properties that are not only the result of inactivation of the tumor suppressor role of Merlin but also an independent process implicating a Merlin-driven regulation of NOTCH1 and EGFR.",Oncogene,2015-05-14,P A Guerrero; W Yin; L Camacho; D Marchetti
10.1002/jbmr.2316,PMID:25043591,Combined MEK inhibition and BMP2 treatment promotes osteoblast differentiation and bone healing in Nf1Osx -/- mice.,"Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disease with an incidence of 1/3000, caused by mutations in the NF1 gene, which encodes the RAS/GTPase-activating protein neurofibromin. Non-bone union after fracture (pseudarthrosis) in children with NF1 remains a challenging orthopedic condition to treat. Recent progress in understanding the biology of neurofibromin suggested that NF1 pseudarthrosis stems primarily from defects in the bone mesenchymal lineage and hypersensitivity of hematopoietic cells to TGFβ. However, clinically relevant pharmacological approaches to augment bone union in these patients remain limited. In this study, we report the generation of a novel conditional mutant mouse line used to model NF1 pseudoarthrosis, in which Nf1 can be ablated in an inducible fashion in osteoprogenitors of postnatal mice, thus circumventing the dwarfism associated with previous mouse models where Nf1 is ablated in embryonic mesenchymal cell lineages. An ex vivo-based cell culture approach based on the use of Nf1(flox/flox) bone marrow stromal cells showed that loss of Nf1 impairs osteoprogenitor cell differentiation in a cell-autonomous manner, independent of developmental growth plate-derived or paracrine/hormonal influences. In addition, in vitro gene expression and differentiation assays indicated that chronic ERK activation in Nf1-deficient osteoprogenitors blunts the pro-osteogenic property of BMP2, based on the observation that only combination treatment with BMP2 and MEK inhibition promoted the differentiation of Nf1-deficient osteoprogenitors. The in vivo preclinical relevance of these findings was confirmed by the improved bone healing and callus strength observed in Nf1osx (-/-) mice receiving Trametinib (a MEK inhibitor) and BMP2 released locally at the fracture site via a novel nanoparticle and polyglycidol-based delivery method. Collectively, these results provide novel evidence for a cell-autonomous role of neurofibromin in osteoprogenitor cells and insights about a novel targeted approach for the treatment of NF1 pseudoarthrosis.",Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,2015-01,Jean de la Croix Ndong; David M Stevens; Guillaume Vignaux; Sasidhar Uppuganti; Daniel S Perrien; Xiangli Yang; Jeffry S Nyman; Eva Harth; Florent Elefteriou
10.1371/journal.pgen.1004575,PMID:25329635,Genetic modifiers of neurofibromatosis type 1-associated café-au-lait macule count identified using multi-platform analysis.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant, monogenic disorder of dysregulated neurocutaneous tissue growth. Pleiotropy, variable expressivity and few NF1 genotype-phenotype correlates limit clinical prognostication in NF1. Phenotype complexity in NF1 is hypothesized to derive in part from genetic modifiers unlinked to the NF1 locus. In this study, we hypothesized that normal variation in germline gene expression confers risk for certain phenotypes in NF1. In a set of 79 individuals with NF1, we examined the association between gene expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines with NF1-associated phenotypes and sequenced select genes with significant phenotype/expression correlations. In a discovery cohort of 89 self-reported European-Americans with NF1 we examined the association between germline sequence variants of these genes with café-au-lait macule (CALM) count, a tractable, tumor-like phenotype in NF1. Two correlated, common SNPs (rs4660761 and rs7161) between DPH2 and ATP6V0B were significantly associated with the CALM count. Analysis with tiled regression also identified SNP rs4660761 as significantly associated with CALM count. SNP rs1800934 and 12 rare variants in the mismatch repair gene MSH6 were also associated with CALM count. Both SNPs rs7161 and rs4660761 (DPH2 and ATP6V0B) were highly significant in a mega-analysis in a combined cohort of 180 self-reported European-Americans; SNP rs1800934 (MSH6) was near-significant in a meta-analysis assuming dominant effect of the minor allele. SNP rs4660761 is predicted to regulate ATP6V0B, a gene associated with melanosome biology. Individuals with homozygous mutations in MSH6 can develop an NF1-like phenotype, including multiple CALMs. Through a multi-platform approach, we identified variants that influence NF1 CALM count.",PLoS genetics,2014-10,Alexander Pemov; Heejong Sung; Paula L Hyland; Jennifer L Sloan; Sarah L Ruppert; Andrea M Baldwin; Joseph F Boland; Sara E Bass; Hyo Jung Lee; Kristine M Jones; Xijun Zhang; James C Mullikin; Brigitte C Widemann; Alexander F Wilson; Douglas R Stewart
10.1371/journal.pone.0107760,PMID:25340526,Nilotinib is more potent than imatinib for treating plexiform neurofibroma in vitro and in vivo.,"Plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) are benign nerve sheath tumors mostly associated with neurofibromatosis type 1. They often extend through multiple layers of tissue and therefore cannot be treated satisfactorily by surgery. Nilotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat leukemia, with advantages over the prototype imatinib in terms of potency and selectivity towards BCR-ABL, and the DDR, PDGFR, and KIT receptor kinases. In this study, we compared efficacies of the two drugs on cultured cells of PNF in vitro and on xenografted tumor fragments on sciatic nerve of athymic nude mice. Xenografts were monitored weekly using a high resolution ultrasound measurement. Treatment with nilotinib at a daily dose of 100 mg/kg for four weeks led to a reduction of the graft sizesstd by 68±7% in the 8 treated mice, significantly more than the 33±8% reduction in the 8 untreated mice (P<0.05) and the 47±15% in the 7 mice treated with imatinib (P<0.05). The peak plasma nilotinib concentration 6.6±1.1 µM is within the pharmacological range of clinical application. Imatinib, but not nilotinib significantly hindered body weight increase of the mice and elevated cytotoxicity of mouse spleen cells (P<0.05). Our results suggest that nilotinib may be more potent than imatinib for treating PNFs and may also be better tolerated.

10.1111/pme.12620,PMID:25377441,Development and validation of the English Pain Interference Index and Pain Interference Index-Parent report.,"OBJECTIVE: Measurement of pain interference in children is challenged by a lack of validated measures with a parent proxy report. This study investigated the psychometric properties of the Pain Interference Index (PII), a six-item questionnaire originally developed in Swedish, in chronically ill youth. METHODS: We adapted the PII for English-speaking participants and created a parallel parent proxy measure. Respondents indicate how much pain has interfered with the child's life in the past 2 weeks (0-6 scale); higher scores indicate more pain interference. Eligible participants included individuals 6-25 years with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and cancer. Internal consistency was assessed; validity was examined by correlating PII scores with existing measures of pain interference (Modified Brief Pain Inventory [MBPI]) and pain intensity (visual analogue scale [VAS]), and with measures of disease severity. RESULTS: Among 60 participants (mean age 14.7 years, range 6-24) and their parents, PII internal consistency was 0.84 and 0.96, respectively. PII scores correlated with MBPI (r = 0.81, P < 0.0001) and VAS (r = 0.55, P < 0.0001) scores and differentiated between patients with mild vs moderate/severe NF1 disease severity (P < 0.05). The PII-Parent was significantly correlated with the mothers' and fathers' VAS rating of the child's pain intensity (Ps < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Internal consistency of the English PII is high; validity is supported by the PII's correlations with other measures of pain interference and pain intensity, and with disease severity in patients with NF1. Preliminary data indicate that the English PII is a reliable, valid, feasible pain interference measure for youth with NF1 and cancer.","Pain medicine (Malden, Mass.)",2015-02,Staci Martin; Shawn Nelson Schmitt; Pamela L Wolters; Brittany Abel; Mary Anne Toledo-Tamula; Andrea Baldwin; Rikard K Wicksell; Melinda Merchant; Brigitte Widemann
10.7554/eLife.05151,PMID:25535838,Transient inhibition of the ERK pathway prevents cerebellar developmental defects and improves long-term motor functions in murine models of neurofibromatosis type 1.,"Individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) frequently exhibit cognitive and motor impairments and characteristics of autism. The cerebellum plays a critical role in motor control, cognition, and social interaction, suggesting that cerebellar defects likely contribute to NF1-associated neurodevelopmental disorders. Here we show that Nf1 inactivation during early, but not late stages of cerebellar development, disrupts neuronal lamination, which is partially caused by overproduction of glia and subsequent disruption of the Bergmann glia (BG) scaffold. Specific Nf1 inactivation in glutamatergic neuronal precursors causes premature differentiation of granule cell (GC) precursors and ectopic production of unipolar brush cells (UBCs), indirectly disrupting neuronal migration. Transient MEK inhibition during a neonatal window prevents cerebellar developmental defects and improves long-term motor performance of Nf1-deficient mice. This study reveals essential roles of Nf1 in GC/UBC migration by generating correct numbers of glia and controlling GC/UBC fate-specification/differentiation, identifying a therapeutic prevention strategy for multiple NF1-associcated developmental abnormalities.",eLife,2014-12-23,Edward Kim; Yuan Wang; Sun-Jung Kim; Miriam Bornhorst; Emmanuelle S Jecrois; Todd E Anthony; Chenran Wang; Yi E Li; Jun-Lin Guan; Geoffrey G Murphy; Yuan Zhu
,PMID:25549701,Exome sequencing on malignant meningiomas identified mutations in neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) and meningioma 1 (MN1) genes.,"BACKGROUND: Meningiomas are tumors originating from the membranous layers surrounding the central nervous system, and are generally regarded as ""benign"" tumors of the brain. Malignant meningiomas are rare and are typically associated with a higher risk of local tumor recurrence and a poorer prognosis (median survival time <2 years). Previous genome-wide association studies and exome sequencing studies have identified genes that play a role in susceptibility to meningiomas, but these studies did not focus specifically on malignant tumors. METHODS: We performed exome sequencing on five malignant meningiomas on the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform using Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon kits. We used wANNOVAR web server to annotate and prioritize variants, identified candidate genes with recurrent mutations, and validated selected mutations by Sanger sequencing. We next designed custom NimbleGen targeted region arrays on five candidate genes, and sequenced four additional malignant meningiomas. RESULTS: From exome sequencing data, we identified several frequently mutated genes including NF2, MN1, ARID1B, SEMA4D, and MUC2, with private mutations in tumors. We sequenced these genes in four additional samples and identified potential driver mutations in NF2 (neurofibromatosis type 2) and MN1 (meningioma 1). CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that mutations in NF2 may play a role in progression of meningiomas, and nominated MN1 as a candidate gene for malignant transformation of meningiomas. Our sample size is limited by the extreme rarity of malignant meningiomas, but our study represents one of the first sequencing studies focusing on the malignant subtype.",Discovery medicine,2014-12,Xu Zhang; Haiying Jia; Yao Lu; Chengliang Dong; Jinghui Hou; Zheng Wang; Feng Wang; Hongbin Zhong; Lin Wang; Kai Wang

Unfortunately, there is a lack of comparable reagents for the study of pediatric low-grade glioma (LGG). Leveraging a neurofibromatosis 1 (Nf1) genetically engineered mouse LGG model, we report the isolation of CD133(+) multi-potent low-grade glioma stem cells (LG-GSCs), which generate glioma-like lesions histologically similar to the parent tumor following injection into immunocompetent hosts. In addition, we demonstrate that these LG-GSCs harbor selective resistance to currently employed conventional and biologically targeted anti-cancer agents, which reflect the acquisition of new targetable signaling pathway abnormalities. Using transcriptomic analysis to identify additional molecular properties, we discovered that mouse and human LG-GSCs harbor high levels of Abcg1 expression critical for protecting against ER-stress-induced mouse LG-GSC apoptosis.

METHODS: Primary cultures containing tumor and nontumor stromal cells were utilized in a novel strategy to test drug responses with respect to both efficacy and specificity. The strategy tested in this pilot study was implemented using four primary cultures derived from plexiform neurofibromas. Responses to two cytotoxic drugs (nilotinib and imatinib) were measured by following dose-dependent changes in the proportions of tumor and nontumor cells, determined by staining them with cell-type-specific antibodies. The viability of the cultured cells and the cytotoxic effect of the drugs were also measured using proliferation and cytotoxicity assays. RESULTS: The total number of cells decreased after the drug treatment, in accordance with the observed reduction in proliferation and increased cytotoxic effect upon incubation with the two anticancer drugs. The proportions of Schwann cells and fibroblasts changed dose-dependently, although the patterns of change varied between the tumor samples (from different sources) and between the two drugs. The highly variable in vitro drug responses probably reflect the large variations in the responses of tumors to therapies between individual patients in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results suggest that the concept of assessing in vitro drug responses using primary cultures is feasible, but demands the extensive further development of an application for preclinical drug selection and drug discovery.","Journal of clinical neurology (Seoul, Korea)",2015-04,Wei Jiang; Victor F Mautner; Reinhard E Friedrich; Lan Kluwe

Previous studies have demonstrated that increased neuronal inhibition underlies the learning deficits in NF1, however, the molecular mechanism underlying this cell-type specificity has remained unknown. Here, we identify an interneuron-specific attenuation of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) current as the cause for increased inhibition in Nf1 mutants. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that HCN1 is a novel NF1-interacting protein for which loss of NF1 results in a concomitant increase of interneuron excitability. Furthermore, the HCN channel agonist lamotrigine rescued the electrophysiological and cognitive deficits in two independent Nf1 mouse models, thereby establishing the importance of HCN channel dysfunction in NF1. Together, our results provide detailed mechanistic insights into the pathophysiology of NF1-associated cognitive defects, and identify a novel target for clinical drug development.",Molecular psychiatry,2015-11,A Omrani; T van der Vaart; E Mientjes; G M van Woerden; M R Hojjati; K W Li; D H Gutmann; C N Levelt; A B Smit; A J Silva; S A Kushner; Y Elgersma

These disorders are an important cause for intellectual disability; additional manifestations include autism spectrum disorder, seizures, and brain malformations. Changes in synaptic function are thought to underlie the neurological conditions associated with these syndromes. We therefore studied morphology and in vivo synaptic transmission of the calyx of Held synapse, a relay synapse in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) of the auditory brainstem, in mouse models of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), Fragile X syndrome (FXS), Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), and Costello syndrome. Calyces from both Tsc1(+/-) and from Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mice showed increased volume and surface area compared to wild-type (WT) controls. In addition, in Fmr1 KO animals a larger fraction of calyces showed complex morphology. In MNTB principal neurons of Nf1 (+/) (-) mice the average delay between EPSPs and APs was slightly smaller compared to WT controls, which could indicate an increased excitability. Otherwise, no obvious changes in synaptic transmission, or short-term plasticity were observed during juxtacellular recordings in any of the four lines. Our results in these four mutants thus indicate that abnormalities of mTOR or Ras signaling do not necessarily result in changes in in vivo synaptic transmission.",Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,2015,Tiantian Wang; Laura de Kok; Rob Willemsen; Ype Elgersma; J Gerard G Borst
10.18632/oncotarget.4858,PMID:26219339,A high-throughput kinome screen reveals serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 as a therapeutic target for NF2-deficient meningiomas.,"Meningiomas are the most common primary intracranial adult tumor. All Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2)-associated meningiomas and ~60% of sporadic meningiomas show loss of NF2 tumor suppressor protein. There are no effective medical therapies for progressive and recurrent meningiomas. Our previous work demonstrated aberrant activation of mTORC1 signaling that led to ongoing clinical trials with rapamycin analogs for NF2 and sporadic meningioma patients. Here we performed a high-throughput kinome screen to identify kinases responsible for mTORC1 pathway activation in NF2-deficient meningioma cells. Among the emerging top candidates were the mTORC2-specific target serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) and p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1). In NF2-deficient meningioma cells, inhibition of SGK1 rescues mTORC1 activation, and SGK1 activation is sensitive to dual mTORC1/2 inhibitor AZD2014, but not to rapamycin. PAK1 inhibition also leads to attenuated mTORC1 but not mTORC2 signaling, suggesting that mTORC2/SGK1 and Rac1/PAK1 pathways are independently responsible for mTORC1 activation in NF2-deficient meningiomas. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, we generated isogenic human arachnoidal cell lines (ACs), the origin cell type for meningiomas, expressing or lacking NF2. NF2-null CRISPR ACs recapitulate the signaling of NF2-deficient meningioma cells. Interestingly, we observe increased SGK1 transcription and protein expression in NF2-CRISPR ACs and in primary NF2-negative meningioma lines. Moreover, we demonstrate that the dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitor, AZD2014 is superior to rapamycin and PAK inhibitor FRAX597 in blocking proliferation of meningioma cells. Importantly, AZD2014 is currently in use in several clinical trials of cancer.

Children with NF1 are particularly prone to brain tumors (gliomas) involving the optic pathway that can result in impaired vision. Since tumor formation and expansion requires a cooperative tumor microenvironment, it is important to identify the cellular and acellular components associated with glioma development and growth. In this study, we used 3-D matrix assisted laser desorption ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS) to measure the distributions of multiple molecular species throughout optic nerve tissue in mice with and without glioma, and to explore their spatial relationships within the 3-D volume of the optic nerve and chiasm. 3-D IMS studies often involve extensive workflows due to the high volume of sections required to generate high quality 3-D images. Herein, we present a workflow for 3-D data acquisition and volume reconstruction using mouse optic nerve tissue.

We mapped an Nf1-Stat3-Arid1b/β-catenin pathway that becomes active in the context of Nf1 loss. Genetic deletion of Stat3 in Schwann cell progenitors (SCPs) and Schwann cells (SCs) prevents neurofibroma formation, decreasing SCP self-renewal and β-catenin activity. β-catenin expression rescues effects of Stat3 loss in SCPs. Importantly, P-STAT3 and β-catenin expression correlate in human neurofibromas. Mechanistically, P-Stat3 represses Gsk3β and the SWI/SNF gene Arid1b to increase β-catenin. Knockdown of Arid1b or Gsk3β in Stat3(fl/fl);Nf1(fl/fl);DhhCre SCPs rescues neurofibroma formation after in vivo transplantation. Stat3 represses Arid1b through histone modification in a Brg1-dependent manner, indicating that epigenetic modification plays a role in early tumorigenesis.

10.1002/ajmg.a.37623,PMID:27021207,Acceptance and commitment therapy in youth with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and chronic pain and their parents: A pilot study of feasibility and preliminary efficacy.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder affecting about 1 in 3,500 individuals. Chronic pain is commonly reported among individuals with NF1 and plexiform neurofibroma tumors (PNs). Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), an empirically supported method for addressing chronic pain, helps individuals re-focus on valued relationships and activities. This pilot study investigated the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a brief ACT workshop in the NF1 population. Eligible participants included adolescents and young adults (AYA; 12-21 years) with NF1 and chronic pain that interfered with daily functioning and their parents. Patients and parents completed baseline measures of pain interference, pain intensity, functional disability, pain acceptance, depression, and anxiety. Then, AYA and parents participated separately in a 2-day small-group ACT workshop. A telephone booster session occurred 1 month post-intervention. Three-month post-treatment measures were completed by mail. Ten adolescents (4 males; M age = 16.9 years) and seven parents provided baseline and 3-month data. Mean satisfaction with the study was moderate to high (3.9 for patients and 4.6 for parents on a 1-5 scales). Patients and parents reported significant declines in patients' pain interference at 3 months post-treatment. Patient-reported pain intensity significantly declined from baseline to 3 months. Parents reported marginally greater acceptance of their child's pain. No changes emerged in functional ability or mood. Preliminary findings suggest that a brief ACT group intervention is feasible and may help AYA with NF1 and PNs cope with their chronic pain, although larger randomized studies are needed to confirm treatment efficacy. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",American journal of medical genetics.

10.1002/acn3.288,PMID:27081657,A randomized placebo-controlled lovastatin trial for neurobehavioral function in neurofibromatosis I.,"OBJECTIVE: Lovastatin has been shown to reverse learning deficits in a mouse model of Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1), a common monogenic disorder caused by a mutation in the Ras-MAPK pathway and associated with learning disabilities. We conducted a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to assess lovastatin's effects on cognition and behavior in patients with NF1. METHOD: Forty-four NF1 patients (mean age 25.7+/-11.6 years; 64% female) were randomly assigned to 14 weeks of lovastatin (N = 23; maximum dose of 80 mg/day for adult participants and 40 mg/day for children) or placebo (N = 21). Based on findings in the mouse model, primary outcome measures were nonverbal learning and working memory. Secondary outcome measures included verbal memory, attention, and self/parent-reported behavioral problems, as well as tolerability of medication. Participants also underwent neuroimaging assessments at baseline and 14 weeks, to determine whether neural biomarkers were associated with treatment response. Linear mixed models assessed for differential treatment effects on outcome measures. RESULTS: Twelve participants dropped from the study prior to completion (8 placebo, 4 lovastatin), resulting in 32 completers (15 placebo, 17 lovastatin). Lovastatin was well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events. Differential improvement favoring lovastatin treatment was observed for one primary (working memory; effect size f (2) = 0.70, P < 0.01) and two secondary outcome measures (verbal memory, f (2) = 0.19, P = 0.02, and adult self-reported internalizing problems, f (2) = 0.26, P = 0.03). Exploratory moderator analyses revealed that higher baseline neural activity in frontal regions was associated with larger treatment effects. INTERPRETATION: These preliminary results suggest beneficial effects of lovastatin on some learning and memory functions, as well as internalizing symptoms in patients with NF1.",Annals of clinical and translational neurology,2016-04,Carrie E Bearden; Gerhard S Hellemann; Tena Rosser; Caroline Montojo; Rachel Jonas; Nicole Enrique; Laura Pacheco; Shaun A Hussain; Joyce Y Wu; Jennifer S Ho; James J McGough; Catherine A Sugar; Alcino J Silva

We performed a genome-wide screen to identify suppressors of liver tumor formation in mice, using CRISPR-mediated genome editing. METHODS: We performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-based knockout screen of P53-null mouse embryonic liver progenitor cells that overexpressed MYC. We infected p53 RESULTS: We identified 4 candidate liver tumor suppressor genes not previously associated with liver cancer (Nf1, Plxnb1, Flrt2, and B9d1). CRISPR-mediated knockout of Nf1, a negative regulator of RAS, accelerated liver tumor formation in mice. Loss of Nf1 or activation of RAS up-regulated the liver progenitor cell markers HMGA2 and SOX9. RAS pathway inhibitors suppressed the activation of the Hmga2 and Sox9 genes that resulted from loss of Nf1 or oncogenic activation of RAS. Knockdown of HMGA2 delayed formation of xenograft tumors from cells that expressed oncogenic RAS. In human HCCs, low levels of NF1 messenger RNA or high levels of HMGA2 messenger RNA were associated with shorter patient survival time. Liver cancer cells with inactivation of Plxnb1, Flrt2, and B9d1 formed more tumors in mice and had increased levels of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: Using a CRISPR-based strategy, we identified Nf1, Plxnb1, Flrt2, and B9d1 as suppressors of liver tumor formation. We validated the observation that RAS signaling, via mitogen-activated protein kinase, contributes to formation of liver tumors in mice. We associated decreased levels of NF1 and increased levels of its downstream protein HMGA2 with survival times of patients with HCC. Strategies to inhibit or reduce HMGA2 might be developed to treat patients with liver cancer.",Gastroenterology,2017-04,Chun-Qing Song; Yingxiang Li; Haiwei Mou; Jill Moore; Angela Park; Yotsawat Pomyen; Soren Hough; Zachary Kennedy; Andrew Fischer; Hao Yin; Daniel G Anderson; Darryl Conte; Lars Zender; Xin Wei Wang; Snorri Thorgeirsson; Zhiping Weng; Wen Xue

10.1056/NEJMoa1605943,PMID:28029918,Activity of Selumetinib in Neurofibromatosis Type 1-Related Plexiform Neurofibromas.,"BACKGROUND: Effective medical therapies are lacking for the treatment of neurofibromatosis type 1-related plexiform neurofibromas, which are characterized by elevated RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. METHODS: We conducted a phase 1 trial of selumetinib (AZD6244 or ARRY-142886), an oral selective inhibitor of MAPK kinase (MEK) 1 and 2, in children who had neurofibromatosis type 1 and inoperable plexiform neurofibromas to determine the maximum tolerated dose and to evaluate plasma pharmacokinetics. Selumetinib was administered twice daily at a dose of 20 to 30 mg per square meter of body-surface area on a continuous dosing schedule (in 28-day cycles). We also tested selumetinib using a mouse model of neurofibromatosis type 1-related neurofibroma. Response to treatment (i.e., an increase or decrease from baseline in the volume of plexiform neurofibromas) was monitored by using volumetric magnetic resonance imaging analysis to measure the change in size of the plexiform neurofibroma. RESULTS: A total of 24 children (median age, 10.9 years; range, 3.0 to 18.5) with a median tumor volume of 1205 ml (range, 29 to 8744) received selumetinib. Patients were able to receive selumetinib on a long-term basis; the median number of cycles was 30 (range, 6 to 56). The maximum tolerated dose was 25 mg per square meter (approximately 60% of the recommended adult dose). The most common toxic effects associated with selumetinib included acneiform rash, gastrointestinal effects, and asymptomatic creatine kinase elevation. The results of pharmacokinetic evaluations of selumetinib among the children in this trial were similar to those published for adults. Treatment with selumetinib resulted in confirmed partial responses (tumor volume decreases from baseline of ≥20%) in 17 of the 24 children (71%) and decreases from baseline in neurofibroma volume in 12 of 18 mice (67%). Disease progression (tumor volume increase from baseline of ≥20%) has not been observed to date. Anecdotal evidence of decreases in tumor-related pain, disfigurement, and functional impairment was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our early-phase data suggested that children with neurofibromatosis type 1 and inoperable plexiform neurofibromas benefited from long-term dose-adjusted treatment with selumetinib without having excess toxic effects.

To do this, we developed the I2HCP panel, a custom bait library covering 122 hereditary cancer genes. We improved bait design, tested different NGS platforms and created a clinically driven custom data analysis pipeline. The I2HCP panel was developed using a training set of hereditary colorectal cancer, hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and neurofibromatosis patients and reached an accuracy, analytical sensitivity and specificity greater than 99%, which was maintained in a validation set. I2HCP changed our diagnostic approach, involving clinicians and a genetic diagnostics team from panel design to reporting. The new strategy improved diagnostic sensitivity, solved uncertain clinical diagnoses and identified mutations in new genes. We assessed the genetic variation in the complete set of hereditary cancer genes, revealing a complex variation landscape that coexists with the disease-causing mutation. We developed, validated and implemented a custom NGS-based strategy for hereditary cancer diagnostics that improved our previous workflows. Additionally, the existence of a rich genetic variation in hereditary cancer genes favors the use of this panel to investigate their role in cancer risk.",Scientific reports,2017-01-04,Elisabeth Castellanos; Bernat Gel; Inma Rosas; Eva Tornero; Sheila Santín; Raquel Pluvinet; Juan Velasco; Lauro Sumoy; Jesús Del Valle; Manuel Perucho; Ignacio Blanco; Matilde Navarro; Joan Brunet; Marta Pineda; Lidia Feliubadaló; Gabi Capellá; Conxi Lázaro; Eduard Serra

These tumours display largely low grade features but their presence can lead to significant morbidity. Surgery and radiotherapy remain the only treatment options despite years of research, therefore an effective therapeutic is required. Unbiased omics studies have become pivotal in the identification of differentially expressed genes and proteins that may act as drug targets or biomarkers. Here we analysed the proteome and phospho-proteome of these genetically defined tumours using primary human tumour cells to identify upregulated/activated proteins and/or pathways. We identified over 2000 proteins in comparative experiments between Merlin-deficient schwannoma and meningioma compared to human Schwann and meningeal cells respectively. Using functional enrichment analysis we highlighted several dysregulated pathways and Gene Ontology terms. We identified several proteins and phospho-proteins that are more highly expressed in tumours compared to controls. Among proteins jointly dysregulated in both tumours we focused in particular on PDZ and LIM domain protein 2 (PDLIM2) and validated its overexpression in several tumour samples, while not detecting it in normal cells. We showed that shRNA mediated knockdown of PDLIM2 in both primary meningioma and schwannoma leads to significant reductions in cellular proliferation. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive assessment of the NF2-related meningioma and schwannoma proteome and phospho-proteome. Taken together, our data highlight several commonly deregulated factors, and indicate that PDLIM2 may represent a novel, common target for meningioma and schwannoma.",EBioMedicine,2017-02,Kayleigh Bassiri; Sara Ferluga; Vikram Sharma; Nelofer Syed; Claire L Adams; Edwin Lasonder; C Oliver Hanemann
10.1186/s12864-017-3519-7,PMID:28166733,A machine learning classifier trained on cancer transcriptomes detects NF1 inactivation signal in glioblastoma.,"BACKGROUND: We have identified molecules that exhibit synthetic lethality in cells with loss of the neurofibromin 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor gene. However, recognizing tumors that have inactivation of the NF1 tumor suppressor function is challenging because the loss may occur via mechanisms that do not involve mutation of the genomic locus. Degradation of the NF1 protein, independent of NF1 mutation status, phenocopies inactivating mutations to drive tumors in human glioma cell lines. NF1 inactivation may alter the transcriptional landscape of a tumor and allow a machine learning classifier to detect which tumors will benefit from synthetic lethal molecules. RESULTS: We developed a strategy to predict tumors with low NF1 activity and hence tumors that may respond to treatments that target cells lacking NF1. Using RNAseq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we trained an ensemble of 500 logistic regression classifiers that integrates mutation status with whole transcriptomes to predict NF1 inactivation in glioblastoma (GBM). On TCGA data, the classifier detected NF1 mutated tumors (test set area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) mean = 0.77, 95% quantile = 0.53 - 0.95) over 50 random initializations. On RNA-Seq data transformed into the space of gene expression microarrays, this method produced a classifier with similar performance (test set AUROC mean = 0.77, 95% quantile = 0.53 - 0.96). We applied our ensemble classifier trained on the transformed TCGA data to a microarray validation set of 12 samples with matched RNA and NF1 protein-level measurements. The classifier's NF1 score was associated with NF1 protein concentration in these samples. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that TCGA can be used to train accurate predictors of NF1 inactivation in GBM. The ensemble classifier performed well for samples with very high or very low NF1 protein concentrations but had mixed performance in samples with intermediate NF1 concentrations. Nevertheless, high-performing and validated predictors have the potential to be paired with targeted therapies and personalized medicine.",BMC genomics,2017-02-06,Gregory P Way; Robert J Allaway; Stephanie J Bouley; Camilo E Fadul; Yolanda Sanchez; Casey S Greene

The study aim was to develop and validate a disease-specific questionnaire to measure quality of life (QOL) in NF1 that is suitable both as an assessment tool in clinical practice and in clinical trials of novel therapy. METHODS: The Impact of NF1 on Quality of Life (INF1-QOL) questionnaire was developed by a literature search for common terms, focus group (n = 6), semi-structured interviews (n = 21), initial drafts (n =50) and final 14 item questionnaire (n = 50). Bivariate correlations between items, exploratory factor analysis, correlations with severity and EuroQol were employed. RESULTS: INF1-QOL showed good internal reliability (Cronbach's alpha 0.87), mean total INF1-QOL score was 8.64 (SD 6.3), median 7.00, range 0-30 (possible range 0-42); no significant correlations with age or gender. The mean total EuroQol score was 7.38 (SD 2.87), median 6.5, mean global EuroQol score was 76.34 (SD 16.56), median 80. Total INF1-QOL score correlated with total EuroQol r = 0.82, p < 0.0001. The highest impact on QOL was moderate or severe problems with anxiety and depression (32%) and negative effects of NF1 on role and outlook on life (42%). The mean inter-relater reliability for grading of clinical severity scores was 0.71 (range 0.65-0.79), and intra-class correlation was 0.92. The mean clinical severity score was 1.95 (SD 0.65) correlating r = 0.34 with total INF1-QOL score p < 0.05 and correlated 0.37 with total EuroQol score p < 0.01. The clinical severity score was mild in 17 (34%), moderate in 16 (32%) and 17 (34%) individuals had severe disease. CONCLUSIONS: INF1-QOL is a validated, reliable disease specific questionnaire that is easy and quick to complete. Role and outlook on life and anxiety and depression have the highest impact on QOL indicating the variability, severity and unpredictability of NF1. INFI-QOL correlates moderately with clinical severity. The moderate relationship between INF1-QOL and physician rated severity emphasizes the difference between clinical and patient perception. INFI-QOL will be useful in individual patient assessment and as an outcome measure for clinical trials.",Health and quality of life outcomes,2017-02-14,Rosalie E Ferner; Mary Thomas; Gemma Mercer; Victoria Williams; Guy D Leschziner; Shazia K Afridi; John F Golding

Macrophages are abundant in neurofibromas, and macrophage targeted interventions may have therapeutic potential in these tumors. We generated gene expression data from fluorescence-activated cell sorted (FACS) SCs and macrophages from wild-type and mutant nerve and neurofibroma to identify candidate pathways involved in SC-macrophage cross-talk. While in 1-month-old Nf1 mutant nerve neither SCs nor macrophages significantly differed from their normal counterparts, both macrophages and SCs showed significantly altered cytokine gene expression in neurofibromas. Computationally reconstructed SC-macrophage molecular networks were enriched for inflammation-associated pathways. We verified that neurofibroma SC conditioned medium contains macrophage chemo-attractants including colony stimulation factor 1 (CSF1). Network analysis confirmed previously implicated pathways and predict novel paracrine and autocrine loops involving cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. Network analysis also predicted a central role for decreased type-I interferon signaling. We validated type-I interferon expression in neurofibroma by protein profiling, and show that treatment of neurofibroma-bearing mice with polyethylene glycolyated (PEGylated) type-I interferon-α2b reduces the expression of many cytokines overexpressed in neurofibroma.

Since many OPGs occur in the context of the Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) cancer predisposition syndrome, we have previously employed Nf1 genetically-engineered mouse (GEM) strains to study the pathogenesis of these low-grade glial neoplasms. In the light of the finding that human and mouse low-grade gliomas are composed of Olig2+ cells and that Olig2+ oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) give rise to murine high-grade gliomas, we sought to determine whether Olig2+ OPCs could be tumor-initiating cells for Nf1 optic glioma. Similar to the GFAP-Cre transgenic strain previously employed to generate Nf1 optic gliomas, Olig2+ cells also give rise to astrocytes in the murine optic nerve in vivo. However, in contrast to the GFAP-Cre strain where somatic Nf1 inactivation in embryonic neural progenitor/stem cells (Nf1flox/mut; GFAP-Cre mice) results in optic gliomas by 3 months of age in vivo, mice with Nf1 gene inactivation in Olig2+ OPCs (Nf1flox/mut; Olig2-Cre mice) do not form optic gliomas until 6 months of age. These distinct patterns of glioma latency do not reflect differences in the timing or brain location of somatic Nf1 loss. Instead, they most likely reflect the cell of origin, as somatic Nf1 loss in CD133+ neural progenitor/stem cells during late embryogenesis results in optic gliomas at 3 months of age. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the cell of origin dictates the time to tumorigenesis in murine optic glioma.",Oncotarget,2017-07-18,Anne C Solga; Joseph A Toonen; Yuan Pan; Patrick J Cimino; Yu Ma; Guillaume A Castillon; Scott M Gianino; Mark H Ellisman; Da Yong Lee; David H Gutmann

METHODS: BOLD images were acquired from 23 adults with NF1 (age  RESULTS: Relative to healthy controls, participants with NF1 showed reduced recruitment of key components of WM circuitry, the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right parietal cortex. In addition, healthy controls exhibited greater simultaneous deactivation between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and temporal regions than NF1 patients. In contrast, NF1 patients showed greater PCC and bilateral parietal connectivity with visual cortices as well as between the PCC and the cerebellum. In NF1 participants, increased functional coupling of the PCC with frontal and parietal regions was associated with better spatial reasoning and WM performance, respectively; these relationships were not observed in controls. CONCLUSIONS: Dysfunctional engagement of WM circuitry, and aberrant functional connectivity of 'task-negative' regions in NF1 patients may underlie spatial WM difficulties characteristic of the disorder.",NeuroImage.

Eighty youth (ages 7-21) living with NF1 completed the DT and an accompanying checklist. The findings of this study suggest the DT and symptom checklist was acceptable and feasible to complete in a clinic setting. A small subset reported high distress that required further assessment and intervention.

Spred1 recruits the major GTPase activating protein (GAP) neurofibromin from the cytosol to the membrane in order to inactivate the small G protein Ras. These functions are dependent on the N-terminal EVH1 domain and the C-terminal Sprouty domain of Spred1 whereas the former specifically recognizes the GAP related domain of neurofibromin and the latter is responsible for membrane targeting. Within the GAP domain, Spred1 binding depends on the GAPex portion which is dispensable for Ras inactivation.

Patients affected with a constitutional truncating  METHODS: We have assessed NF2 clinical phenotype in 142 patients in relation to the UK NF2 Genetic Severity Score to validate its use as a clinical and research tool. RESULTS: The Genetic Severity Score showed significant correlations across 10 measures, including mean age at diagnosis, proportion of patients with bilateral vestibular schwannomas, presence of intracranial meningioma, spinal meningioma and spinal schwannoma, NF2 eye features, hearing grade, age at first radiotherapy, age at first surgery and age starting bevacizumab. In addition there was moderate but significant correlation with age at loss of useful hearing, and weak but significant correlations for mean age at death, quality of life, last optimum Speech Discrimination Score and total number of major interventions. Patients with severe disease presented at a younger age had a higher disease burden and greater requirement of intervention than patients with mild and moderate disease.

With next-generation sequencing (NGS), sequencing capacity is no longer a limitation to molecular diagnosis. Instead, the rising number of variants of unknown significance (VUSs) poses challenges to clinical interpretation and genetic counselling. We investigated the potential of an integrated pipeline combining NGS and the functional assessment of variants for the diagnosis of RASopathies. We included 63 Chinese patients with RASopathies that had previously tested negative for PTPN11 and HRAS mutations. In these patients, we performed a genetic analysis of genes associated with RASopathies using a multigene NGS panel and Sanger sequencing. For the VUSs, we evaluated evidence from genetic, bioinformatic and functional data. Twenty disease-causing mutations were identified in the 63 patients, providing a primary diagnostic yield of 31.7%. Four VUSs were identified in five patients. The functional assessment supported the pathogenicity of the RAF1 and RIT1 VUSs, while the significance of two VUSs in A2ML1 remained unclear. In summary, functional analysis improved the diagnostic yield from 31.7% to 36.5%. Although technically demanding and time-consuming, a functional genetic diagnostic analysis can ease the clinical translation of these findings to aid bedside interpretation.",Scientific reports,2018-02-05,Gordon K C Leung; H M Luk; Vincent H M Tang; W W Gao; Christopher C Y Mak; Mullin H C Yu; W L Wong; Yoyo W Y Chu; W L Yang; Wilfred H S Wong; Alvin C H Ma; Anskar Y H Leung; D Y Jin; Kelvin Y K Chan; Judith Allanson; Ivan F M Lo; Brian H Y Chung

Germline NF2 mutation leads to neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), characterized by multiple intracranial and spinal schwannomas. Patients with NF2 also frequently develop peripheral neuropathies. While the role of merlin in SC neoplasia is well established, its role in SC homeostasis is less defined. Here we explore the role of merlin in SC responses to nerve injury and their ability to support axon regeneration. We performed sciatic nerve crush in wild-type (WT) and in P0SchΔ39-121 transgenic mice that express a dominant negative Nf2 isoform in SCs. Recovery of nerve function was assessed by measuring mean contact paw area on a pressure pad 7, 21, 60, and 90 days following nerve injury and by nerve conduction assays at 90 days following injury. After 90 days, the nerves were harvested and axon regeneration was quantified stereologically. Myelin ultrastructure was analyzed by electron microscopy. Functional studies showed delayed nerve regeneration in Nf2 mutant mice compared to the WT mice. Delayed neural recovery correlated with a reduced density of regenerated axons and increased endoneurial space in mutants compared to WT mice. Nevertheless, functional and nerve conduction measures ultimately recovered to similar levels in WT and Nf2 mutant mice, while there was a small (∼17%) reduction in the percent of regenerated axons in the Nf2 mutant mice. The data suggest that merlin function in SCs regulates neural ultrastructure and facilitates neural regeneration, in addition to its role in SC neoplasia.",Neuroscience,2018-03-15,Kristy Truong; Iram Ahmad; J Jason Clark; Alison Seline; Tyler Bertroche; Brian Mostaert; Douglas J Van Daele; Marlan R Hansen

Molecular events driving SC-to-MPNST transformation are incompletely understood. Here, we show that human MPNSTs exhibit elevated HIPPO-TAZ/YAP expression, and that TAZ/YAP hyperactivity in SCs caused by Lats1/2 loss potently induces high-grade nerve-associated tumors with full penetrance. Lats1/2 deficiency reprograms SCs to a cancerous, progenitor-like phenotype and promotes hyperproliferation. Conversely, disruption of TAZ/YAP activity alleviates tumor burden in Lats1/2-deficient mice and inhibits human MPNST cell proliferation. Moreover, genome-wide profiling reveals that TAZ/YAP-TEAD1 directly activates oncogenic programs, including platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) signaling. Co-targeting TAZ/YAP and PDGFR pathways inhibits tumor growth. Thus, our findings establish a previously unrecognized convergence between Lats1/2-TAZ/YAP signaling and MPNST pathogenesis, revealing potential therapeutic targets in these untreatable tumors.",Cancer cell,2018-02-12,Lai Man Natalie Wu; Yaqi Deng; Jincheng Wang; Chuntao Zhao; Jiajia Wang; Rohit Rao; Lingli Xu; Wenhao Zhou; Kwangmin Choi; Tilat A Rizvi; Marc Remke; Joshua B Rubin; Randy L Johnson; Thomas J Carroll; Anat O Stemmer-Rachamimov; Jianqiang Wu; Yi Zheng; Mei Xin; Nancy Ratner; Q Richard Lu

The Ras-GAP neurofibromin is a very large cytoplasmic protein (2818 AA, 319 kDa) involved in the RAS-MAPK pathway. Aside from regulation of proliferation, it is involved in mechanosensoric of cells. We investigated neurofibromin replacement in cultured human fibroblasts showing reduced amount of neurofibromin. Full length neurofibromin was produced recombinantly in insect cells and purified. Protein transduction into cultured fibroblasts was performed employing cell penetrating peptides along with photochemical internalization. This combination of transduction strategies ensures the intracellular uptake and the translocation to the cytoplasm of neurofibromin. The transduced neurofibromin is functional, indicated by functional rescue of reduced mechanosensoric blindness and reduced RasGAP activity in cultured fibroblasts of NF1 patients or normal fibroblasts treated by NF1 siRNA. Our study shows that recombinant neurofibromin is able to revert cellular effects of NF1 haploinsuffiency in vitro, indicating a use of protein transduction into cells as a potential treatment strategy for the monogenic disease NF1.",Scientific reports,2018-04-18,K Mellert; S Lechner; M Lüdeke; M Lamla; P Möller; R Kemkemer; K Scheffzek; D Kaufmann

In contrast, the presence and the role of Merlin in oligodendrocytes, the myelin forming cells within the CNS, have not been elucidated. In this work, we demonstrate that Merlin immunoreactivity was broadly distributed in the white matter throughout the central nervous system. Following Merlin expression during development in the cerebellum, Merlin could be detected in the cerebellar white matter tract at early postnatal stages as shown by its co-localization with Olig2-positive cells as well as in adult brain sections where it was aligned with myelin basic protein containing fibers. This suggests that Merlin is expressed in immature and mature oligodendrocytes. Expression levels of Merlin were low in oligodendrocytes as compared to astrocytes and neurons throughout development. Expression of Merlin in oligodendroglia was further supported by its identification in either immortalized cell lines of oligodendroglial origin or in primary oligodendrocyte cultures. In these cultures, the two main splice variants of Nf2 could be detected. Merlin was localized in clusters within the nuclei and in the cytoplasm. Overexpressing Merlin in oligodendrocyte cell lines strengthened reduced impedance in XCELLigence measurements and Ki67 stainings in cultures over time. In addition, the initiation and elongation of cellular projections were reduced by Merlin overexpression. Consistently, cell migration was retarded in scratch assays done on Nf2-transfected oligodendrocyte cell lines. These data suggest that Merlin actively modulates process outgrowth and migration in oligodendrocytes.",PloS one,2018,Andrea Toledo; Elena Grieger; Khalad Karram; Helen Morrison; Stephan L Baader
10.1371/journal.pone.0190001,PMID:29787563,Graph complexity analysis identifies an ETV5 tumor-specific network in human and murine low-grade glioma.,"Conventional differential expression analyses have been successfully employed to identify genes whose levels change across experimental conditions. One limitation of this approach is the inability to discover central regulators that control gene expression networks. In addition, while methods for identifying central nodes in a network are widely implemented, the bioinformatics validation process and the theoretical error estimates that reflect the uncertainty in each step of the analysis are rarely considered. Using the betweenness centrality measure, we identified Etv5 as a potential tissue-level regulator in murine neurofibromatosis type 1 (Nf1) low-grade brain tumors (optic gliomas). As such, the expression of Etv5 and Etv5 target genes were increased in multiple independently-generated mouse optic glioma models relative to non-neoplastic (normal healthy) optic nerves, as well as in the cognate human tumors (pilocytic astrocytoma) relative to normal human brain. Importantly, differential Etv5 and Etv5 network expression was not directly the result of Nf1 gene dysfunction in specific cell types, but rather reflects a property of the tumor as an aggregate tissue. Moreover, this differential Etv5 expression was independently validated at the RNA and protein levels. Taken together, the combined use of network analysis, differential RNA expression findings, and experimental validation highlights the potential of the computational network approach to provide new insights into tumor biology.",PloS one,2018,Yuan Pan; Christina Duron; Erin C Bush; Yu Ma; Peter A Sims; David H Gutmann; Ami Radunskaya; Johanna Hardin
10.1167/iovs.17-22588,PMID:29847659,Neurofibromin Deficiency Induces Endothelial Cell Proliferation and Retinal Neovascularization.,"PURPOSE: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the result of inherited mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene, which encodes the protein neurofibromin. Eye manifestations are common in NF1 with recent reports describing a vascular dysplasia in the retina and choroid. Common features of NF1 retinopathy include tortuous and dilated feeder vessels that terminate in capillary tufts, increased endothelial permeability, and neovascularization. Given the retinal vascular phenotype observed in persons with NF1, we hypothesize that preserving neurofibromin may be a novel strategy to control pathologic retinal neovascularization. METHODS: Nf1 expression in human endothelial cells (EC) was reduced using small hairpin (sh) RNA and EC proliferation, migration, and capacity to form vessel-like networks were assessed in response to VEGF and hypoxia. Wild-type (WT), Nf1 heterozygous (Nf1+/-), and Nf1flox/+;Tie2cre pups were subjected to hyperoxia/hypoxia using the oxygen-induced retinopathy model. Retinas were analyzed quantitatively for extent of retinal vessel dropout, neovascularization, and capillary branching. RESULTS: Neurofibromin expression was suppressed in response to VEGF, which corresponded with activation of Mek-Erk and PI3-K-Akt signaling. Neurofibromin-deficient EC exhibited enhanced proliferation and network formation in response to VEGF and hypoxia via an Akt-dependent mechanism. In response to hyperoxia/hypoxia, Nf1+/- retinas exhibited increased vessel dropout and neovascularization when compared with WT retinas. Neovascularization was similar between Nf1+/- and Nf1flox/+;Tie2cre retinas, but capillary drop out in Nf1flox/+;Tie2cre retinas was significantly reduced when compared with Nf1+/- retinas.

There are no effective drug therapies for these benign tumors and conventional therapies have limited efficacy. Various model systems have been created and several drug targets have been implicated in NF2-driven tumorigenesis based on known effects of the absence of merlin, the product of the NF2 gene. We tested priority compounds based on known biology with traditional dose-concentration studies in meningioma and schwann cell systems. Concurrently, we studied functional kinome and gene expression in these cells pre- and post-treatment to determine merlin deficient molecular phenotypes. Cell viability results showed that three agents (GSK2126458, Panobinostat, CUDC-907) had the greatest activity across schwannoma and meningioma cell systems, but merlin status did not significantly influence response. In vivo, drug effect was tumor specific with meningioma, but not schwannoma, showing response to GSK2126458 and Panobinostat. In culture, changes in both the transcriptome and kinome in response to treatment clustered predominantly based on tumor type. However, there were differences in both gene expression and functional kinome at baseline between meningioma and schwannoma cell systems that may form the basis for future selective therapies. This work has created an openly accessible resource (www.synapse.org/SynodosNF2) of fully characterized isogenic schwannoma and meningioma cell systems as well as a rich data source of kinome and transcriptome data from these assay systems before and after treatment that enables single and combination drug discovery based on molecular phenotype.",PloS one,2018,Robert Allaway; Steve P Angus; Roberta L Beauchamp; Jaishri O Blakeley; Marga Bott; Sarah S Burns; Annemarie Carlstedt; Long-Sheng Chang; Xin Chen; D Wade Clapp; Patrick A Desouza; Serkan Erdin; Cristina Fernandez-Valle; Justin Guinney; James F Gusella; Stephen J Haggarty; Gary L Johnson; Salvatore La Rosa; Helen Morrison; Alejandra M Petrilli; Scott R Plotkin; Abhishek Pratap; Vijaya Ramesh; Noah Sciaky; Anat Stemmer-Rachamimov; Tim J Stuhlmiller; Michael E Talkowski; D Bradley Welling; Charles W Yates; Jon S Zawistowski; Wen-Ning Zhao

Studies that seek to understand cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying NF1 orthopedic problems are of great importance to better understand the pathogenesis and the development of new therapies. Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) are being used as an in vitro model for several diseases and appear as a suitable model for NF1. The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro chondrogenic differentiation of DPSCs from individuals with NF1 using two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) cultures. RESULTS: To fulfill the criteria of the International Society for Cellular Therapy, DPSCs were characterized by surface antigen expression and by their multipotentiality, being induced to differentiate towards adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic lineages in 2D cultures. Both DPSCs from individuals with NF1 (NF1 DPSCs) and control cultures were positive for CD90, CD105, CD146 and negative for CD13, CD14, CD45 and CD271, and successfully differentiated after the protocols. Chondrogenic differentiation was evaluated in 2D and in 3D (pellet) cultures, which were further evaluated by optical microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). 2D cultures showed greater extracellular matrix deposition in NF1 DPSCs comparing with controls during chondrogenic differentiation. In semithin sections, control pellets hadhomogenous-sized intra and extracelullar matrix vesicles, whereas NF1 cultures had matrix vesicles of different sizes. TEM analysis showed higher amount of collagen fibers in NF1 cultures compared with control cultures.

METHODS: A registration and segmentation pipeline was established using a cohort of NF1 patients with histopathological diagnosis of PN or MPNST, and medical imaging of the PN including MR and PET-CT. The corrected MR datasets were registered to the corresponding PET-CT via landmark-based registration. PET standard-uptake value (SUV) thresholds were used to guide segmentation of volumes of interest: MPNST-associated PET-hot regions (SUV≥3.5) and PN-associated PET-elevated regions (2.0<SUV<3.5). Quantitative imaging features were extracted from the MR, PET, and CT data and compared for statistical differences. Intensity histogram features included (mean, media, maximum, variance, full width at half maximum, entropy, kurtosis, and skewness), while image texture was quantified using Law's texture energy measures, grey-level co-occurrence matrices, and neighborhood grey-tone difference matrices. RESULTS: For each of the 20 NF1 subjects, a total of 320 features were extracted from the image data. Feature reduction and statistical testing identified 9 independent radiomic biomarkers from the MR data (4 intensity and 5 texture) and 4 PET (2 intensity and 2 texture) were different between the PET-hot versus PET-elevated volumes of interest.

These tumors arise more frequently within neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and present with resistance during standard chemotherapy leading to increased mortality and morbidity in those patients. In vitro all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and MEK inhibitors (MEKi) were shown to inhibit tumor proliferation, especially when applied in combination. Therefore, we established a nude mouse model to investigate if treatment of xenografts derived from NF1 associated S462 and T265 MPNST cells respond to ATRA and the MEKi PD0325901. RESULTS: We demonstrated that human NF1 associated MPNST derived from S462 but not T265 cells form solid subcutaneous tumors in Foxn1 nude mice but not in Balb/c, SHO or Shorn mice. We verified a characteristic staining pattern of human MPNST xenografts by immunohistochemistry. Therapeutic effects of ATRA and/or MEKi PD0325901 on growth of S462 MPNST xenografts in Foxn1 nude mice were not demonstrated in vitro, as we did not observe significant suppression of MPNST growth compared with placebo treatment.",BMC research notes,2018-07-28,Susan Fischer-Huchzermeyer; Levan Chikobava; Verena Stahn; Monique Zangarini; Philip Berry; Gareth J Veal; Volker Senner; Victor F Mautner; Anja Harder

Sixteen individuals diagnosed with NF1 underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT brain imaging followed by a neuropsychological assessment. Principal component analysis was performed on 17 measures of cognitive function and a machine learning approach based on Gaussian Process Regression was used to individually predict the components that represented most of the variance in the neuropsychological data. The accuracy of the method was estimated using leave-one-out cross-validation and its significance through permutation testing. We found that only the first component could be accurately predicted from resting state metabolism (r = 0.926, p<0.001). Multiple and heterogeneous measures contribute to the first component, mainly WISC/WAIS Procedure and Verbal IQ, verbal memory and fluency.

Sporadic VSs exhibit variable growth patterns and only a small fraction of the tumours are fast-growing; however, the underlying mechanisms remain undefined. METHODS: DNA sequencing and dosage analysis were used to identify the NF2 mutation status in sporadic schwannomas. The expression and sub-cellular localization of merlin and p53-MDM2 were assessed by immunoblotting, qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence. In vitro and in vivo studies were performed to reveal the effects of Nutlin-3 (a MDM2 inhibitor) and/or MG-132(a proteasome inhibitor) on schwannomas. The proliferation of schwannoma cells was assessed by CCK-8 assay, EdU staining and Flow cytometry analysis. FINDINGS: Double genetic hits of NF2 tended to occur in fast-growing tumours, characterized by the absence of merlin. The deregulation of p53-MDM2 was demonstrated to mediate merlin-deficient tumour growth, characterized by a nuclear accumulation of stabilized MDM2, contributing to a nuclear export of p53 for degradation. Nutlin-3 blocked the proliferation of schwannoma cells via a cooperative recovery of merlin and p53, accompanied by the shuttling of both proteins from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. We further demonstrated a difference in the sensitivity to Nutlin-3 between schwannoma cells with and without merlin expression. Nutlin-3 combined with MG-132 narrowed this between-group difference and triggered stronger inhibitory effects on the growth of schwannomas through coordinated reactivation of p53.

Gliomagenesis in NF1 results in a heterogeneous spectrum of low- to high-grade neoplasms occurring during the entire lifespan of patients. The pattern of genetic and epigenetic alterations of glioma that develops in NF1 patients and the similarities with sporadic glioma remain unknown. Here, we present the molecular landscape of low- and high-grade gliomas in patients affected by NF1 (NF1-glioma). We found that the predisposing germline mutation of the NF1 gene was frequently converted to homozygosity and the somatic mutational load of NF1-glioma was influenced by age and grade. High-grade tumors harbored genetic alterations of TP53 and CDKN2A, frequent mutations of ATRX associated with Alternative Lengthening of Telomere, and were enriched in genetic alterations of transcription/chromatin regulation and PI3 kinase pathways. Low-grade tumors exhibited fewer mutations that were over-represented in genes of the MAP kinase pathway. Approximately 50% of low-grade NF1-gliomas displayed an immune signature, T lymphocyte infiltrates, and increased neo-antigen load. DNA methylation assigned NF1-glioma to LGm6, a poorly defined Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 wild-type subgroup enriched with ATRX mutations.

Despite this observation, gonadal function has not been examined in patients with NF1. In order to assess the role of reduced neurofibromin in the testes, we examined testicular morphology and function in an Nf1+/- mouse model. We found that although Nf1+/- male mice are able to reproduce, they have significantly fewer pups per litter than Nf1+/+ control males. Reduced fertility in Nf1+/- male mice is associated with disorganization of the seminiferous epithelium, with exfoliation of germ cells and immature spermatids into the tubule lumen. Morphometric analysis shows that these alterations are associated with decreased Leydig cell numbers and increased spermatid cell numbers. We hypothesized that hyper-activation of Ras in Nf1+/- males affects ectoplasmic specialization, a Sertoli-spermatid adherens junction involved in spermiation.

NF2 is characterized by bilateral vestibular schwannomas (VSs) that cause progressive and debilitating hearing loss, leading to social isolation and increased rates of depression. A major limitation in NF2 basic and translational research is the lack of animal models that allow the full spectrum of research into the biology and molecular mechanisms of NF2 tumor progression, as well as the effects on neurological function. In this protocol, we describe how to inject schwannoma cells into the mouse brain cerebellopontine angle (CPA) region. We also describe how to apply state-of-the-art intravital imaging and hearing assessment techniques to study tumor growth and hearing loss. In addition, ataxia, angiogenesis, and tumor-stroma interaction assays can be applied, and the model can be used to test the efficacy of novel therapeutic approaches. By studying the disease from every angle, this model offers the potential to unravel the basic biological underpinnings of NF2 and to develop novel therapeutics to control this devastating disease. Our protocol can be adapted to study other diseases within the CPA, including meningiomas, lipomas, vascular malformations, hemangiomas, epidermoid cysts, cerebellar astrocytomas, and metastatic lesions. The entire surgical procedure takes ~45 min per mouse and allows for subsequent longitudinal imaging, as well as neurological and hearing assessment, for up to 2 months.",Nature protocols,2019-02,Jie Chen; Lukas D Landegger; Yao Sun; Jun Ren; Nir Maimon; Limeng Wu; Mei R Ng; John W Chen; Na Zhang; Yingchao Zhao; Xing Gao; Takeshi Fujita; Sylvie Roberge; Peigen Huang; Rakesh K Jain; Scott R Plotkin; Konstantina M Stankovic; Lei Xu

Quality of life has been shown impaired in NF1, due to severe complications, cosmetic features, and uncertainty about the disorder. METHODS: This study sought to develop a self-administered questionnaire in French to assess the burden of NF1 (BoN), then translate and linguistically and cross-culturally validate it into American English, standardized methodology applied, as outlined in the report. RESULTS: Based on several discussions with NF1 patients, a 17-item conceptual questionnaire was first produced. Of the 91 NF1 adult patients who responded to the conceptual questionnaire, 65 (64.6% females) were accessible. Subsequent confirmatory analyses generated a 15-item questionnaire grouped into four domains, demonstrating internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha: 091), discriminant validity, and high reliability. The BoN was likewise shown to significantly correlate with other validated questionnaires, such as Dermatology Life Quality Index, Perceived Stress Scale, and SF12 mental score, indicating good external validity. CONCLUSIONS: BoN is a specific tool for assessing the burden that NF1 generates on many practical aspects of the patient daily activities, beyond the notion of quality of life"". Given the increasing relevance that regulatory authorities attribute to patient-reported outcomes, the BoN questionnaire provides such supplementary information while accounting for the burden of NF1 patients in the broadest sense.",Orphanet journal of rare diseases,2019-05-03,Marie-Laure Armand; Charles Taieb; Aline Bourgeois; Mireille Bourlier; Mohammed Bennani; Christine Bodemer; Pierre Wolkenstein

Utilizing a telomere-specific FISH assay, we classified tumors as either ALT-positive or having long (without ALT), short, or normal telomere lengths. A total of 426 tumors from 256 NF1 patients were evaluated, as well as 99 MPNST tumor samples that were sporadic or of unknown NF1 status. In the NF1-glioma dataset, ALT was present in the majority of high-grade gliomas: 14 (of 23; 60%) in contrast to only 9 (of 47; 19%) low-grade gliomas (p = 0.0009). In the subset of ALT-negative glioma cases, telomere lengths were estimated and we observed 17 (57%) cases with normal, 12 (40%) cases with abnormally long, and only 1 (3%) case with short telomeres. In the NF1-associated malignant nerve sheath tumor (NF1-MPNST) set (n = 75), ALT was present in 9 (12%). In the subset of ALT-negative NF1-MPNST cases, telomeres were short in 9 (38%), normal in 14 (58%) and long in 1 (3%). In the glioma set, overall survival was significantly decreased for patients with ALT-positive tumors (p < 0.0001). In the NF1-MPNST group, overall survival was superior for patients with tumors with short telomeres (p = 0.003).

However, these circuits have never been directly assayed in vivo. We employed the genetically encoded optical dopamine sensor dLight1 to monitor dopaminergic neurotransmission in the ventral striatum of NF1 mice during motivated behavior. Additionally, we developed novel systemic AAV vectors to facilitate morphological reconstruction of dopaminergic populations in cleared tissue. We found that NF1 mice exhibit reduced spontaneous dopaminergic neurotransmission that was associated with excitation/inhibition imbalance in the ventral tegmental area and abnormal neuronal morphology. NF1 mice also had more robust dopaminergic and behavioral responses to salient visual stimuli, which were independent of learning, and rescued by optogenetic inhibition of non-dopaminergic neurons in the VTA. Overall, these studies provide a first in vivo characterization of dopaminergic circuit function in the context of NF1 and reveal novel pathophysiological mechanisms.",eLife,2019-09-23,J Elliott Robinson; Gerard M Coughlin; Acacia M Hori; Jounhong Ryan Cho; Elisha D Mackey; Zeynep Turan; Tommaso Patriarchi; Lin Tian; Viviana Gradinaru

A complete framework is required to better understand autism in NF1, from neurobiological levels through to behavioural and functional outcomes. The primary aims of this study are to establish the frequency of ASD in children with NF1, examine the social cognitive phenotype, investigate the neuropsychological processes contributing to ASD symptoms and poor social functioning in children with NF1, and to investigate novel structural and functional neurobiological markers of ASD and social dysfunction in NF1. The secondary aim of this study is to compare the neuropsychological and neurobiological features of ASD in children with NF1 to a matched group of patients with idiopathic ASD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is an international, multisite, prospective, cross-sectional cohort study of children with NF1, idiopathic ASD and typically developing (TD) controls. Participants will be 200 children with NF1 (3-15 years of age), 70 TD participants (3-15 years) and 35 children with idiopathic ASD (7-15 years). Idiopathic ASD and NF1 cases will be matched on age, sex and intelligence. All participants will complete cognitive testing and parents will rate their child's behaviour on standardised questionnaires. Neuroimaging will be completed by a subset of participants aged 7 years and older. Children with NF1 that screen at risk for ASD on the parent-rated Social Responsiveness Scale 2nd Edition will be invited back to complete the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale 2nd Edition and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised to determine whether they fulfil ASD diagnostic criteria.

10.3390/genes11020226,PMID:32098059,Integrative Analysis Identifies Candidate Tumor Microenvironment and Intracellular Signaling Pathways that Define Tumor Heterogeneity in NF1.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a monogenic syndrome that gives rise to numerous symptoms including cognitive impairment, skeletal abnormalities, and growth of benign nerve sheath tumors. Nearly all NF1 patients develop cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs), which occur on the skin surface, whereas 40-60% of patients develop plexiform neurofibromas (pNFs), which are deeply embedded in the peripheral nerves. Patients with pNFs have a ~10% lifetime chance of these tumors becoming malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). These tumors have a severe prognosis and few treatment options other than surgery. Given the lack of therapeutic options available to patients with these tumors, identification of druggable pathways or other key molecular features could aid ongoing therapeutic discovery studies. In this work, we used statistical and machine learning methods to analyze 77 NF1 tumors with genomic data to characterize key signaling pathways that distinguish these tumors and identify candidates for drug development. We identified subsets of latent gene expression variables that may be important in the identification and etiology of cNFs, pNFs, other neurofibromas, and MPNSTs. Furthermore, we characterized the association between these latent variables and genetic variants, immune deconvolution predictions, and protein activity predictions.",Genes,2020-02-21,Jineta Banerjee; Robert J Allaway; Jaclyn N Taroni; Aaron Baker; Xiaochun Zhang; Chang In Moon; Christine A Pratilas; Jaishri O Blakeley; Justin Guinney; Angela Hirbe; Casey S Greene; Sara Jc Gosline
10.1002/mgg3.1180,PMID:32107864,Expanding the Noonan spectrum/RASopathy NGS panel: Benefits of adding NF1 and SPRED1.,"BACKGROUND: RASopathies are a group of disorders caused by disruptions to the RAS-MAPK pathway. Despite being in the same pathway, Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) and Legius syndrome (LS) typically present with phenotypes distinct from Noonan spectrum disorders (NSDs). However, some NF1/LS individuals also exhibit NSD phenotypes, often referred to as Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome (NFNS), and may be mistakenly evaluated for NSDs, delaying diagnosis, and affecting patient management. METHODS: A derivation cohort of 28 patients with a prior negative NSD panel and either NFNS or a suspicion of NSD and café-au-lait spots underwent NF1 and SPRED1 sequencing. To further determine the utility and burden of adding these genes, a validation cohort of 505 patients with a suspected RASopathy were tested on a 14-gene RASopathy-associated panel. RESULTS: In the derivation cohort, six (21%) patients had disease-causing NF1 or SPRED1 variants. In the validation cohort, 11 (2%) patients had disease-causing variants and 15 (3%) had variants of uncertain significance in NF1 or SPRED1. Of those with disease-causing variants, 5/17 only had an NSD diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Adding NF1 and SPRED1 to RASopathy panels can speed diagnosis and improve patient management, without significantly increasing the burden of inconclusive results.",Molecular genetics & genomic medicine,2020-04,Leora Witkowski; Mitchell W Dillon; Elissa Murphy; Matthew S Lebo; Heather Mason-Suares

METHODS: We conducted an open-label, phase 2 trial of selumetinib to determine the objective response rate among patients with plexiform neurofibromas and to assess clinical benefit. Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 and symptomatic inoperable plexiform neurofibromas received oral selumetinib twice daily at a dose of 25 mg per square meter of body-surface area on a continuous dosing schedule (28-day cycles). Volumetric magnetic resonance imaging and clinical outcome assessments (pain, quality of life, disfigurement, and function) were performed at least every four cycles. Children rated tumor pain intensity on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable). RESULTS: A total of 50 children (median age, 10.2 years; range, 3.5 to 17.4) were enrolled from August 2015 through August 2016. The most frequent neurofibroma-related symptoms were disfigurement (44 patients), motor dysfunction (33), and pain (26). A total of 35 patients (70%) had a confirmed partial response as of March 29, 2019, and 28 of these patients had a durable response (lasting ≥1 year). After 1 year of treatment, the mean decrease in child-reported tumor pain-intensity scores was 2 points, considered a clinically meaningful improvement. In addition, clinically meaningful improvements were seen in child-reported and parent-reported interference of pain in daily functioning (38% and 50%, respectively) and overall health-related quality of life (48% and 58%, respectively) as well as in functional outcomes of strength (56% of patients) and range of motion (38% of patients). Five patients discontinued treatment because of toxic effects possibly related to selumetinib, and 6 patients had disease progression. The most frequent toxic effects were nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea; an asymptomatic increase in the creatine phosphokinase level; acneiform rash; and paronychia. CONCLUSIONS: In this phase 2 trial, most children with neurofibromatosis type 1 and inoperable plexiform neurofibromas had durable tumor shrinkage and clinical benefit from selumetinib.

10.3390/genes11050499,PMID:32369930,Unmasking Intra-tumoral Heterogeneity and Clonal Evolution in NF1-MPNST.,"Sarcomas are highly aggressive cancers that have a high propensity for metastasis, fail to respond to conventional therapies, and carry a poor 5-year survival rate. This is particularly true for patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), in which 8%-13% of affected individuals will develop a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). Despite continued research, no effective therapies have emerged from recent clinical trials based on preclinical work. One explanation for these failures could be the lack of attention to intra-tumoral heterogeneity. Prior studies have relied on a single sample from these tumors, which may not be representative of all subclones present within the tumor. In the current study, samples were taken from three distinct areas within a single tumor from a patient with an NF1-MPNST. Whole exome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and copy number analysis were performed on each sample. A blood sample was obtained as a germline DNA control. Distinct mutational signatures were identified in different areas of the tumor as well as significant differences in gene expression among the spatially distinct areas, leading to an understanding of the clonal evolution within this patient. These data suggest that multi-regional sampling may be important for driver gene identification and biomarker development in the future.",Genes,2020-05-01,Chang-In Moon; William Tompkins; Yuxi Wang; Abigail Godec; Xiaochun Zhang; Patrik Pipkorn; Christopher A Miller; Carina Dehner; Sonika Dahiya; Angela C Hirbe

10.7554/eLife.55137,PMID:32396062,Tgfb3 collaborates with PP2A and notch signaling pathways to inhibit retina regeneration.,"Neuronal degeneration in the zebrafish retina stimulates Müller glia (MG) to proliferate and generate multipotent progenitors for retinal repair. Controlling this proliferation is critical to successful regeneration. Previous studies reported that retinal injury stimulates pSmad3 signaling in injury-responsive MG. Contrary to these findings, we report pSmad3 expression is restricted to quiescent MG and suppressed in injury-responsive MG. Our data indicates that Tgfb3 is the ligand responsible for regulating pSmad3 expression. Remarkably, although overexpression of either Tgfb1b or Tgfb3 can stimulate pSmad3 expression in the injured retina, only Tgfb3 inhibits injury-dependent MG proliferation; suggesting the involvement of a non-canonical Tgfb signaling pathway. Furthermore, inhibition of Alk5, PP2A or Notch signaling rescues MG proliferation in Tgfb3 overexpressing zebrafish. Finally, we report that this Tgfb3 signaling pathway is active in zebrafish MG, but not those in mice, which may contribute to the different regenerative capabilities of MG from fish and mammals.",eLife,2020-05-12,Mi-Sun Lee; Jin Wan; Daniel Goldman

METHODS: Using a variety of transgenic mouse lines, we investigated how expression of Neurod1 effects medulloblastoma (MB) growth, schwannoma tumor progression, vestibular function, and SC cell proliferation. Primary human vestibular schwannoma (VS) cell cultures were transduced with adenoviral vectors expressing Neurod1. Cell proliferation was assessed by 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) uptake. STUDY DESIGN: Basic science investigation. RESULTS: Expression of Neurod1 reduced the growth of slow-growing but not fast-growing MB models. Gene transfer of Neurod1 in human schwannoma cultures significantly reduced cell proliferation in dose-dependent way. Deletion of the neurofibromatosis type 2 (Nf2) tumor-suppressor gene via Cre expression in SCs led to increased intraganglionic SC proliferation and mildly reduced vestibular sensory-evoked potentials (VsEP) responses compared to age-matched wild-type littermates. The effect of Neurod1-induced expression on intraganglionic SC proliferation in animals lacking Nf2 was mild and highly variable. Sciatic nerve axotomy significantly increased SC proliferation in wild-type and Nf2-null animals, and expression of Neurod1 reduced the proliferative capacity of both wild-type and Nf2-null SCs following nerve injury. CONCLUSION: Expression of Neurod1 reduces slow-growing MB progression and reduces human SC proliferation in primary VS cultures. In a genetic mouse model of schwannomas, we find some effects of Neurod1 expression; however, the high variability indicates that more tightly regulated Neurod1 expression levels that mimic our in vitro data are needed to fully validate Neurod1 effects on schwannoma progression.

We use CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to introduce mutations into genes commonly found mutated in HG-SOC, such as Trp53, Brca1, Nf1 and Pten. Our results support the dual origin hypothesis of HG-SOC, as we demonstrate that both epithelia can give rise to ovarian tumors with high-grade pathology. However, the mutated oviductal organoids expand much faster in vitro and more readily form malignant tumors upon transplantation.

Whether survivors of childhood cancer with NF1 are at increased risk for poor long-term health outcomes is unknown. METHODS: One hundred forty-seven 5+ year survivors of childhood glioma with NF1 from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study were compared with 2629 non-NF1 glioma survivors and 5051 siblings for late mortality, chronic health conditions, and psychosocial, neurocognitive, and socioeconomic outcomes. RESULTS: Survivors with NF1 (age at diagnosis: 6.8 ± 4.8 years) had greater cumulative incidence of late mortality 30 years after diagnosis (46.3% [95% confidence interval: 23.9-62.2%]) compared with non-NF1 survivors (18.0% [16.1-20.0%]) and siblings (0.9% [0.6-1.2%]), largely due to subsequent neoplasms. Compared with survivors without NF1, those with NF1 had more severe/life-threatening chronic conditions at cohort entry (46.3% [38.1-54.4%] vs. 30.8% [29.1-32.6%]), but similar rates of new conditions during follow-up (rate ratio: 1.26 [0.90-1.77]). Survivors with NF1 were more likely to report psychosocial impairments, neurocognitive deficits, and socioeconomic difficulties compared with survivors without NF1.

MPNSTs contain highly rearranged hyperploid genomes and exhibit a high division rate and aggressiveness. We have studied in vitro whether the mitotic kinesins KIF11, KIF15, and KIF23 have a functional role in maintaining MPNST cell survival and can represent potential therapeutic vulnerabilities. METHODS: We studied the expression of kinesin mRNAs and proteins in tumors and cell lines and used several in vitro functional assays to analyze the impact of kinesin genetic suppression (KIF15, KIF23) and drug inhibition (KIF11) in MPNST cells. We also performed in vitro combined treatments targeting KIF11 together with other described MPNST targets. RESULTS: The studied kinesins were overexpressed in MPNST samples. KIF15 and KIF23 were required for the survival of MPNST cell lines, which were also more sensitive than benign control fibroblasts to the KIF11 inhibitors ispinesib and ARRY-520. Co-targeting KIF11 and BRD4 with ARRY-520 and JQ1 reduced MPNST cell viability, synergistically killing a much higher proportion of MPNST cells than control fibroblasts. In addition, genetic suppression of  CONCLUSIONS: The mitotic spindle kinesins KIF11 and KIF15 and the cytokinetic kinesin KIF23 play a clear role in maintaining MPNST cell survival and may represent potential therapeutic vulnerabilities.

There are currently no effective therapies, underscoring the pressing need to define the molecular etiologies that underlie MPNST progression. The aim of this study was to examine clonal progression and identify the molecular events critical for MPNST spread. METHODS: In two patients with temporally and spatially distinct metastatic lesions, we employed whole exome sequencing (WES) to elucidate the genetic events of clonal progression, thus identifying the molecular events critical for MPNST spread. RESULTS: First, we demonstrated shared clonal origins for the metastatic lesions relative to the primary tumors, which were maintained throughout the course of MPNST progression, supporting the conclusion that cancer cells with metastatic potential already exist in the primary neoplasm. Second, we discovered TRIM23, a member of the Tripartite Motif family of proteins, as a regulator of MPNST lung metastatic spread in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: The ability to track the genomic evolution from primary to metastatic MPNST offers new insights into the sequence of genetic events required for tumor progression and has identified TRIM23 as a novel target for future study in this rare cancer.",Neuro-oncology advances,2020-07,Abigail Godec; Reyka Jayasinghe; John S A Chrisinger; Bethany Prudner; Tyler Ball; Yuxi Wang; Divya Srihari; Madhurima Kaushal; Hilary Dietz; Xiaochun Zhang; Melike Pekmezci; Sonika Dahiya; Yu Tao; Jinqin Luo; Brian A Van Tine; Li Ding; David H Gutmann; Angela C Hirbe

METHODS: A cross-sectional study of adults with NF1 and NF2 attending a tertiary center. Patients completed generic measures (SF-36, EQ-5D-5L, and PROMIS pain interference) and disease-specific questionnaires (PedsQL NF1 module and the NFTI-QOL for NF2). We compared generic scores between NF1 and NF2 individuals and used regression models to assess factors associated with quality of life. RESULTS: Hundred and eighty-four participants were enrolled. Mean age was 33 years in NF1 and 40 years in NF2. NF1 and NF2 individuals had lower employment rates and lower scores in all domains of the SF-36 compared to the general Canadian population ( CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with NF1 and NF2 have low quality of life, and this correlates with pain, anxiety, and depression, which are prevalent in NF1 and NF2. Perceived physical appearance predicts quality of life in NF1. A multidisciplinary approach is necessary for patients with NF1 and NF2, including mental health and pain management.",Neuro-oncology advances,2020-07,Geohana Hamoy-Jimenez; Raymond Kim; Suganth Suppiah; Gelareh Zadeh; Vera Bril; Carolina Barnett
10.1093/noajnl/vdaa037,PMID:32642741,Effect of age and neurofibromatosis type 1 status on white matter integrity in the optic radiations.,"BACKGROUND: Adults with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) have decreased white matter integrity, but differences in children with NF1 have not been described. Defining normal values for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures, especially in the optic radiations, is important to the development of DTI as a potential biomarker of visual acuity in children with optic pathway glioma. This study examines the effect of age and NF1 status on DTI measures in children. METHODS: In this retrospective study, MR imaging including DTI was conducted in 93 children (40 children with NF1 and 53 healthy controls) between 0 and 14 years of age. Regression models of age, sex, and NF1 status on DTI measures were evaluated, and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) compared DTI measures in age-matched NF1 to non-NF1 cohorts. RESULTS: Fractional anisotropy, radial diffusivity, and mean diffusivity in white matter tracts of the optic radiations varied with age and were best modeled by a logarithmic function. Age-related DTI measure change was different in NF1 versus non-NF1 subjects. Normal values and 95% confidence intervals for age 0.5-12 years were derived for both groups. Differences in DTI measures between NF1 and non-NF1 groups at a range of ages were shown diffusely throughout the cerebral white matter using TBSS. CONCLUSIONS: Children with NF1 demonstrate increased diffusion throughout the brain compared to children without NF1 suggesting a potentially altered developmental trajectory of optic radiation microstructure. Defining normal values for white matter integrity in children with NF1 may help target early intervention efforts in this vulnerable group.",Neuro-oncology advances,2020-07,Peter de Blank; Jeffrey I Berman; Marisa Prelack; John R Sollee; Adam Lane; Amy T Waldman; Michael J Fisher

Using serial MRI/3D-reconstruction, whole-genome sequencing and spectral karyotyping-based single-cell phylogenetic tree building, we show two distinct types of tumor evolution in p53-mutant driven mouse models. Malignant gliomas/GBMs grow as a single mass (Type 1) and multifocal masses (Type 2), respectively, despite both exhibiting loss of Pten/chromosome 19 (chr19) and PI3K/Akt activation with sub-tetraploid/4N genomes. Analysis of early biopsied and multi-segment tumor tissues reveals no evidence of less proliferative diploid/2N lesions in Type 1 tumors. Strikingly, CA-derived relatively quiescent tumor precursors with ancestral diploid/2N genomes and normal Pten/chr19 are observed in the subventricular zone (SVZ), but are distantly segregated from multi focal Type 2 tumors.

Genotype-phenotype correlations for NF1 are rare due to the large number of NF1 mutations and role of modifier genes in manifestations of NF1; however, emerging reports suggest that persons with NF1 display a distinct anthropometric and metabolic phenotype featuring short stature, low body mass index, increased insulin sensitivity, and protection from diabetes. Nf1 heterozygous (Nf1+/-) mice accurately reflect the dominant inheritance of NF1 and are regularly employed as a model of NF1. Here, we sought to identify whether Nf1+/- mice recapitulate the anthropometric and metabolic features identified in persons with NF1. Littermate 16-20 week-old male wildtype (WT) and Nf1+/- C57B/6J mice underwent nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), indirect calorimetry, and glucose/insulin/pyruvate tolerance testing. In some experiments, tissues were harvested for NMR and histologic characterization. Nf1+/- mice are leaner with significantly reduced visceral and subcutaneous fat mass, which corresponds with an increased density of small adipocytes and reduced leptin levels. Additionally, Nf1+/- mice are highly reliant on carbohydrates as an energy substrate and display increased glucose clearance and insulin sensitivity, but normal response to pyruvate suggesting enhanced glucose utilization and preserved gluconeogenesis. Finally, WT and Nf1+/- mice subjected to high glucose diet were protected from diet-induced obesity and hyperglycemia. Our data suggest that Nf1+/- mice closely recapitulate the anthropometric and metabolic phenotype identified in persons with NF1, which will impact the interpretation of previous and future translational studies of NF1.",Translational research : the journal of laboratory and clinical medicine,2021-02,Rebekah Tritz; Tyler Benson; Valerie Harris; Farlyn Z Hudson; James Mintz; Hanfang Zhang; Simone Kennard; Weiqin Chen; David W Stepp; Gabor Csanyi; Eric J Belin de Chantemèle; Neal L Weintraub; Brian K Stansfield

The malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), a very aggressive, therapy resistant, and Neurofibromatosis type 1 associated neoplasia, shows a high metabolic activity and affected patients may therefore benefit from 3-BrPA treatment. To elucidate the specific mode of action, we used a controlled cell model overexpressing proteasome activator (PA) 28, subsequently leading to p53 inactivation and oncogenic transformation and therefore reproducing an important pathway in MPNST and overall tumor pathogenesis. METHODS: Viability of MPNST cell lines S462, NSF1, and T265 in response to increasing doses (0-120 μM) of 3-BrPA was analyzed by CellTiter-Blue® assay. Additionally, we investigated viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (dihydroethidium assay), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase activity (NADH-TR assay) and lactate production (lactate assay) in mouse B8 fibroblasts overexpressing PA28 in response to 3-BrPA application. For all experiments normal and nutrient deficient conditions were tested. MPNST cell lines were furthermore characterized immunohistochemically for Ki67, p53, bcl2, bcl6, cyclin D1, and p21. RESULTS: MPNST significantly responded dose dependent to 3-BrPA application, whereby S462 cells were most responsive. Human control cells showed a reduced sensitivity. In PA28 overexpressing cancer cell model 3-BrPA application harmed mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase activity mildly and significantly failed to inhibit lactate production. PA28 overexpression was associated with a functional glycolysis as well as a partial resistance to stress provoked by nutrient deprivation. 3-BrPA treatment was not associated with an increase of ROS. Starvation sensitized MPNST to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive MPNST cells are sensitive to 3-BrPA therapy in-vitro with and without starvation. In a PA28 overexpression cancer cell model leading to p53 inactivation, thereby reflecting a key molecular feature in human NF1 associated MPNST, known functions of 3-BrPA to block mitochondrial activity and glycolysis were reproduced, however oncogenic cells displayed a partial resistance. To conclude, 3-BrPA was sufficient to reduce NF1 associated MPNST viability potentially due inhibition of glycolysis which should lead to the initiation of further studies and promises a potential benefit for NF1 patients.",BMC cancer,2020-09-18,Christian Linke; Markus Wösle; Anja Harder

These dysregulated pathways represent potential targets for therapeutic intervention. However, studies of novel single agents including MEK inhibitors (MEKi) have demonstrated limited efficacy both preclinically and clinically, with little advancement in overall patient survival. By interrogation of kinome activity through an unbiased screen and targeted evaluation of the signaling response to MEK inhibition, we have identified global activation of upstream receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) that converges on activation of RAS as a mechanism to limit sensitivity to MEK inhibition. As no direct inhibitors of pan-RAS were available, an inhibitor of the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, a critical mediator of RAS signal transduction downstream of multiple RTK, represented an alternate strategy. The combination of MEKi plus SHP099 was superior to MEKi alone in models of NF1-MPNST, including those with acquired resistance to MEKi.

NF1 Patients were recruited from a phase II clinical trial for the treatment of PN. Multiple b-value DWI was imaged over the largest PN. All DWI datasets were registered and intensity normalized prior to segmentation with a multi-spectral neural network classifier (MSNN). Manual volumes of PN were performed on 3D-T2 images registered to diffusion images and compared to MSNN volumes with the Sørensen-Dice coefficient. Intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) parameters were calculated from resulting volumes. 35 MRI scans were included from 14 subjects.

The study was conducted in parallel in the UK and US. METHODS: Qualitative interviews were conducted with patients to generate questionnaire content. Face and content validity of the draft scale was assessed by cognitive debriefing interviews (CDIs). A postal validation survey was conducted to identify the final version of the questionnaire (the PlexiQoL), establish its unidimensionality, and assess its psychometric properties. RESULTS: Thematic analysis was performed on 42 interview transcripts. Thirty-one CDIs revealed that patients found the draft scale to be comprehensible, relevant, and easy to complete. The postal validation survey was completed by 273 patients. Rasch analysis identified an 18-item unidimensional scale that showed excellent internal consistency, reproducibility, and sensitivity to differences in patient-perceived pNF severity, general health, and the use of pain medication.

Previously, we established NF2 loss activates mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) signaling, leading to clinical trials for NF2 and MN. Recently our omics studies identified activated ephrin (EPH) receptor and Src family kinases upon NF2 loss. Here, we report increased expression of several ligands in NF2-null human arachnoidal cells (ACs) and the MN cell line Ben-Men-1, particularly neuregulin-1/heregulin (NRG1), and confirm increased NRG1 secretion and activation of V-ERB-B avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 3 (ERBB3) receptor kinase. Conditioned-medium from NF2-null ACs or exogenous NRG1 stimulated ERBB3, EPHA2, and mTORC1/2 signaling, suggesting pathway crosstalk. NF2-null cells treated with an ERBB3-neutralizing antibody partially downregulated mTOR pathway activation but showed no effect on viability. mTORC1/2 inhibitor treatment decreased NRG1 expression and downregulated ERBB3 while re-activating pAkt T308, suggesting a mechanism independent of NRG1-ERBB3 but likely involving activation of another upstream receptor kinase. Transcriptomics after mTORC1/2 inhibition confirmed decreased ERBB3/ERBB4 while revealing increased expression of insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF1R). Drug treatment co-targeting mTORC1/2 and IGF1R/insulin receptor attenuated pAkt T308 and showed synergistic effects on viability. Our findings indicate potential autocrine signaling where NF2 loss leads to secretion/activation of NRG1-ERBB3 signaling. mTORC1/2 inhibition downregulates NRG1-ERBB3, while upregulating pAkt T308 through an adaptive response involving IGF1R/insulin receptor and co-targeting these pathways may prove effective for treatment of NF2-deficient MN.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2021,Roberta L Beauchamp; Serkan Erdin; Luke Witt; Justin T Jordan; Scott R Plotkin; James F Gusella; Vijaya Ramesh

This tumor forms in children with a genetic condition called neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), causing tumors to grow on nerves. In normal conditions, glial cells are there to support and protect nerve cells but, in NF1-OPG, glial cells have a genetic defect and grow out of control forming a tumor called a glioma. There are no rat models of NF1-OPG that can be used to explore various treatment options, and mouse models make interventional studies difficult due to their small eye size. We have created a model in which to study the progression of tumor growth in the optic nerve and establish the anatomical and functional consequences of the model and determine its suitability to serve as a surrogate for human disease. C6 rat glioma cells were injected into the optic nerve of Long-Evans rats and allowed to proliferate for 2 weeks. The eye clearly showed proptosis and lens opacity was observed, likely due to increased intraocular pressure caused by growing tumors. Hematoxylin-eosin staining showed marked cellularity, with hyperchromatism and pleomorphism. There was prominent area of necrosis with neoplastic cells palisading around the penumbra. Immunostaining with markers such as S100, β-tubulin III, Foxp3, CD45, Vimentin, and Ki67 confirmed low-grade tumor formation, with a mild immune response.

However, the effect of such ligands on distal orthosteric sites cannot be easily described by classical docking methods. Here, we applied machine learning (ML) approaches to expose the links between local dynamic patterns and different degrees of allosteric inhibition of the ATPase function in the molecular chaperone TRAP1. We focused on 11 novel allosteric modulators with similar affinities to the target but with inhibitory efficacy between the 26.3 and 76%. Using a set of experimentally related local descriptors, ML enabled us to connect the molecular dynamics (MD) accessible to ligand-bound (perturbed) and unbound (unperturbed) systems to the degree of ATPase allosteric inhibition. The ML analysis of the comparative perturbed ensembles revealed a redistribution of dynamic states in the inhibitor-bound versus inhibitor-free systems following allosteric binding. Linear regression models were built to quantify the percentage of experimental variance explained by the predicted inhibitor-bound TRAP1 states. Our strategy provides a comparative MD-ML framework to infer allosteric ligand functionality.

They account for substantial morbidity and mortality in NF1. Cutaneous (CNF) and plexiform neurofibromas (PNF) share nearly identical histology, but maintain different growth rates and risk of malignant conversion. The reasons for this disparate clinical behavior are not well explained by recent genome or transcriptome profiling studies. We hypothesized that CNFs and PNFs are epigenetically distinct tumor types that exhibit differential signaling due to genome-wide and site-specific methylation events. We interrogated the methylation profiles of 45 CNFs and 17 PNFs from NF1 subjects with the Illumina EPIC 850K methylation array. Based on these profiles, we confirm that CNFs and PNFs are epigenetically distinct tumors with broad differences in higher-order chromatin states and specific methylation events altering genes involved in key biological and cellular processes, such as inflammation, RAS/MAPK signaling, actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, and oxytocin signaling. Based on our identification of two separate DMRs associated with alternative leading exons in MAP2K3, we demonstrate differential RAS/MKK3/p38 signaling between CNFs and PNFs. Epigenetic reinforcement of RAS/MKK/p38 was a defining characteristic of CNFs leading to pro-inflammatory signaling and chromatin conformational changes, whereas PNFs signaled predominantly through RAS/MEK. Tumor size also correlated with specific CpG methylation events. Taken together, these findings confirm that NF1 deficiency influences the epigenetic regulation of RAS signaling fates, accounting for observed differences in CNF and PNF clinical behavior. The extension of these findings is that CNFs may respond differently than PNFs to RAS-targeted therapeutics raising the possibility of targeting p38-mediated inflammation for CNF treatment.",Epigenetics & chromatin,2021-01-13,Jamie L Grit; Benjamin K Johnson; Patrick S Dischinger; Curt J Essenburg; Marie Adams; Stacy Campbell; Kai Pollard; Christine A Pratilas; Tim J Triche; Carrie R Graveel; Matthew R Steensma

This is the first study to date to systematically assess RAS dependency of BRAF alterations with real-world cancer genomic databases. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate RAS dependency of individual BRAF alterations through alteration coexistence analysis using cancer genomic databases. DESIGN AND SETTING: A cross-sectional data analysis of 119 538 nonredundant cancer samples using cancer genomics databases including GENIE (Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange) and databases in cBioPortal including TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) (accessed March 24, 2020), in addition to 2745 cancer samples from Mayo Clinic Genomics Laboratory (January 1, 2015, to July 1, 2020). Frequencies and odds ratios of coexisting alterations of RAS (KRAS, NRAS and HRAS) and RAS regulatory genes (NF1, PTPN11 and CBL) were calculated for individual BRAF alterations, and compared according to the current BRAF alteration classification; cancer type specificity of coexisting alterations of RAS or RAS regulatory genes was also evaluated. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome measurement is enrichment of RAS (KRAS, NRAS and HRAS) alterations in BRAF variant cancers. Secondary outcome measurement is enrichment of RAS regulatory gene (NF1, PTPN11, and CBL) in BRAF variant cancers. RESULTS: A total of 2745 cancer samples from 2708 patients (female/male ratio: 1.0) tested by Mayo Clinic Genomics Laboratory and 119 538 patients (female/male ratio: 1.1) from GENIE and cBioPortal database were included in the study. In 119 538 nonredundant cancer samples, class 1 BRAF alterations and BRAF fusions were found to be mutually exclusive to alterations of RAS or RAS regulatory genes (odds ratio range 0.03-0.13 and 0.03-0.73 respectively), confirming their RAS independency. Both class 2 and class 3 BRAF alterations show variable and overlapping levels of enriched RAS alterations (odds ratio range: 0.03-5.9 and 0.63-2.52 respectively), suggesting heterogeneity in RAS dependency and a need to revisit BRAF alteration classification. For RAS-dependent BRAF alterations, the coexisting alterations also involve RAS regulatory genes by enrichment analysis (for example, S467L shows an odds ratio of 8.26 for NF1, 9.87 for PTPN11, and 15.23 for CBL) and occur in a variety of cancer types with some coalterations showing cancer type specificity (for example, HRAS variations account for 46.7% of all coexisting RAS alterations in BRAF variant bladder cancers, but 0% in non-small cell lung cancers). Variant-level assessment shows that BRAF alterations involving the same codon may differ in RAS dependency. In addition, RAS dependency of previously unclassified BRAF alterations could be assessed. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Current BRAF alteration classification based on in vitro assays does not accurately predict RAS dependency in vivo for non-V600 BRAF alterations. RAS-dependent BRAF variant cancers with different mechanisms of RAS activation suggest the need for different treatment strategies.",JAMA network open,2021-01-04,Yiqing Zhao; Hanzhong Yu; Cris M Ida; Kevin C Halling; Benjamin R Kipp; Katherine Geiersbach; Kandelaria M Rumilla; Sounak Gupta; Ming-Tseh Lin; Gang Zheng

We performed a phase II trial of the MAPK/ERK kinase inhibitor, mirdametinib (PD-0325901), in patients with NF1 and inoperable PNs. The primary objective was response rate based on volumetric magnetic resonance imaging analysis. METHODS: Inclusion criteria included age ≥ 16 years and a PN that was either progressive or causing significant morbidity. First-dose pharmacokinetics were performed. Patients completed patient-reported outcome measures. Patients received mirdametinib by mouth twice a day at 2 mg/m RESULTS: Nineteen patients were enrolled, and all 19 received mirdametinib. The median age was 24 years (range, 16-39 years); the median baseline tumor volume was 363.8 mL (range, 3.9-5,161 mL). Eight of the 19 patients (42%) achieved a partial response of the target PN by course 12, and 10 (53%) had stable disease. One patient (5%) developed progressive disease at course 8. Significant and durable decreases were observed in pain ratings. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this analysis represents the first characterization of the activity and pharmacokinetics of mirdametinib in patients with NF1 and PNs and is the first published response study for MAPK/ERK kinase inhibitors in adults with NF1 and PNs.

The RASopathies, a group of disorders caused by mutations of the Ras/MAPK pathway genes, share many overlapping clinical features. Studies suggest a high prevalence of ASD in the RASopathies, but detailed characterization of the ASD profile is lacking. The aim of this study was to compare the ASD symptom profile of three distinct RASopathies associated with both gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations: neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), Noonan syndrome (NS), and cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (CFC). Participants were drawn from existing databases if they had a diagnosis of a RASopathy, met the criteria for ASD, and were able to communicate verbally.

Despite advances in our understanding of MPNST pathobiology, there are few effective therapeutic options, and no investigational agents have proven successful in clinical trials. To further understand the genomic heterogeneity of MPNST, and to generate a preclinical platform that encompasses this heterogeneity, we developed a collection of NF1-MPNST patient-derived xenografts (PDX). These PDX were compared with the primary tumors from which they were derived using copy number analysis, whole exome sequencing, and RNA sequencing. We identified chromosome 8 gain as a recurrent genomic event in MPNST and validated its occurrence by FISH in the PDX and parental tumors, in a validation cohort, and by single-cell sequencing in the PDX. Finally, we show that chromosome 8 gain is associated with inferior overall survival in soft-tissue sarcomas. These data suggest that chromosome 8 gain is a critical event in MPNST pathogenesis and may account for the aggressive nature and poor outcomes in this sarcoma subtype.",JCI insight,2021-03-22,Carina Dehner; Chang In Moon; Xiyuan Zhang; Zhaohe Zhou; Chris Miller; Hua Xu; Xiaodan Wan; Kuangying Yang; Jay Mashl; Sara Jc Gosline; Yuxi Wang; Xiaochun Zhang; Abigail Godec; Paul A Jones; Sonika Dahiya; Himanshi Bhatia; Tina Primeau; Shunqiang Li; Kai Pollard; Fausto J Rodriguez; Li Ding; Christine A Pratilas; Jack F Shern; Angela C Hirbe

Existing chemotherapeutic and targeted agents have been unsuccessful in MPNST treatment, and recent findings implicate STAT3 and HIF1-α in driving MPNST. The DNA-binding and transcriptional activity of both STAT3 and HIF1-α is regulated by Redox factor-1 (Ref-1) redox function. A first-generation Ref-1 inhibitor, APX3330, is being tested in cancer clinical trials and could be applied to MPNST. METHODS: We characterised Ref-1 and p-STAT3 expression in various MPNST models. Tumour growth, as well as biomarkers of apoptosis and signalling pathways, were measured by qPCR and western blot following treatment with inhibitors of Ref-1 or STAT3.

Cutaneous neurofibromas (cNF) are among the most common visible manifestations of NF1 and present a major clinical burden for patients. NF1 patients with cNF often report decreased quality of life, emotional well-being and physical comfort. Developing effective medical therapies for cNF has been identified as a priority for the majority of adults with NF1. METHODS: The study was an open, controlled and prospective proof-of-concept clinical trial. The topical treatment consisted of two steps: cNF microporation using a laser device followed by topical application of one drop of diclofenac 25 mg/mL on the surface of the cNF (T neurofibroma = treatment) or physiological saline (C neurofibroma = control) and reapplied twice daily for 3 days. Neurofibroma assessments included visual and dermatoscopy observations noting color and presence of necrosis, presence of flaccidity, measurements in two dimensions, photographs, and histopathology after excision. The primary efficacy variable was the presence of tissue necrosis. The primary safety variable was the occurrence of treatment-related adverse events. RESULTS: Six patients were included in the study. The treatment resulted in transitory topical changes (healing of the microporation grid with formation of scintillating tissue layer, hyperemia and desquamation), with no statistically significant variation in the dimensions of the T and C neurofibromas in relation to pretreatment measurements. There was no necrosis in the T or C neurofibromas. In the histopathological analysis, there was no significant difference in the distribution of chronic (lymphocytic) inflammatory infiltrate in the papillary reticular dermis (subepithelial), type of infiltrate (diffuse, perivascular, or both), presence of fibrosis, and presence of atrophy among the T and C neurofibromas. No adverse events attributable to the use of diclofenac were reported during the treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment did not result in significant alterations in terms of presence of tissue necrosis, size, or histopathological features in the T neurofibromas or in comparison to the C neurofibromas. Topical diclofenac with laser microporation was well-tolerated, with no adverse events attributable to diclofenac reported. Whether these observations are due to minimal systemic and neurofibroma exposure remain to be explored in dosage studies with larger patient groups.

Here, we find that TRAP1 is highly expressed in the early stages of Zebrafish development, and its ablation delays embryogenesis while increasing mitochondrial respiration of fish larvae. TRAP1 expression is enhanced by hypoxic conditions both in developing embryos and in cancer models of Zebrafish and mammals. The TRAP1 promoter contains evolutionary conserved hypoxic responsive elements, and HIF1α stabilization increases TRAP1 levels. TRAP1 inhibition by selective compounds or by genetic knock-out maintains a high level of respiration in Zebrafish embryos after exposure to hypoxia.

The aim of this study was to assess selumetinib tissue pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) using a minipig model of NF1. METHODS: WT ( RESULTS: Key selumetinib PK parameters aligned with those observed in human patients. Selumetinib concentrations were higher in CNS tissues from NF1 compared to WT animals. Inhibition of ERK phosphorylation was achieved in PBMCs (mean 60% reduction), skin (95%), and sciatic nerve (64%) from all minipigs, whereas inhibition of ERK phosphorylation in cerebral cortex was detected only in NF1 animals (71%). Basal p-ERK levels were significantly higher in NF1 minipig optic nerve compared to WT and were reduced to WT levels (60%) with selumetinib. Modulation of transcript biomarkers was observed in all tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Selumetinib reduces MAPK signaling in tissues clinically relevant to NF1, effectively normalizing p-ERK to WT levels in optic nerve but resulting in abnormally low levels of p-ERK in the skin. These results suggest that selumetinib exerts activity in NF1-associated CNS tumors by normalizing Ras/MAPK signaling and may explain common MEK inhibitor-associated dermatologic toxicities.",Neuro-oncology advances,2021,Sara H Osum; Alexander W Coutts; Dylan J Duerre; Barbara R Tschida; Mark N Kirstein; James Fisher; W Robert Bell; Oona Delpuech; Paul D Smith; Brigitte C Widemann; Christopher L Moertel; David A Largaespada; Adrienne L Watson

MPNSTs arise from benign peripheral nerve plexiform neurofibromas that originate in the embryonic neural crest cell lineage. Using reporter transgenes that label early neural crest lineage cells in multiple NF1 MPNST mouse models, we discover and characterize a rare MPNST cell population with stem-cell-like properties, including quiescence, that is essential for tumor initiation and relapse. Following isolation of these cells, we derive a cancer-stem-cell-specific gene expression signature that includes consensus embryonic neural crest genes and identify Nestin as a marker for the MPNST cell of origin.

Its hallmarks are cutaneous findings including neurofibromas, benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors. We analyzed the collagen and matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) expression in Neurofibromatosis 1 cutaneous neurofibroma and found excessive expression of collagen and reduced expression of MMP1. To identify new therapeutic drugs for neurofibroma, we analyzed phosphorylation of components of the Ras pathway, which underlies NF1 regulation, and applied treatments to block this pathway (PD184352, U0126, and rapamycin) and lysosomal processes (chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and bafilomycin A (BafA)) in cultured Neurofibromatosis 1 fibroblasts. We found that downregulation of the MMP1 protein was a key abnormal feature in the neurofibromatosis 1 fibroblasts and that the decreased MMP1 was restored by the lysosomal blockers CQ and HCQ, but not by the blockers of the Ras pathway. Moreover, the MMP1-upregulating activity of those lysosomal blockers was dependent on aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) activation and ERK phosphorylation.

Positing a causal role for sensory processing differences requires observing atypical sensory reactivity prior to the emergence of other symptoms, which can be achieved through prospective studies. METHODS: In this longitudinal study, we examined auditory repetition suppression and change detection at 5 and 10 months in infants with and without Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1), a condition associated with higher likelihood of developing ASD. RESULTS: In typically developing infants, suppression to vowel repetition and enhanced responses to vowel/pitch change decreased with age over posterior regions, becoming more frontally specific; age-related change was diminished in the NF1 group. Whilst both groups detected changes in vowel and pitch, the NF1 group were largely slower to show a differentiated neural response. Auditory responses did not relate to later language, but were related to later ASD traits. CONCLUSIONS: These findings represent the first demonstration of atypical brain responses to sounds in infants with NF1 and suggest they may relate to the likelihood of later ASD.",Journal of neurodevelopmental disorders,2021-05-28,Jannath Begum-Ali; Anna Kolesnik-Taylor; Isabel Quiroz; Luke Mason; Shruti Garg; Jonathan Green; Mark H Johnson; Emily J H Jones
10.3390/ijms22105367,PMID:34065204,RABL6A Regulates Schwann Cell Senescence in an RB1-Dependent Manner.,"Schwann cells are normally quiescent, myelinating glia cells of the peripheral nervous system. Their aberrant proliferation and transformation underlie the development of benign tumors (neurofibromas) as well as deadly malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). We discovered a new driver of MPNSTs, an oncogenic GTPase named RABL6A, that functions in part by inhibiting the RB1 tumor suppressor. RB1 is a key mediator of cellular senescence, a permanent withdrawal from the cell cycle that protects against cell immortalization and transformation. Based on the RABL6A-RB1 link in MPNSTs, we explored the hypothesis that RABL6A promotes Schwann cell proliferation and abrogates their senescence by inhibiting RB1. Using sequentially passaged normal human Schwann cells (NHSCs), we found that the induction of replicative senescence was associated with reduced expression of endogenous RABL6A. Silencing RABL6A in low passage NHSCs caused premature stress-induced senescence, which was largely rescued by co-depletion of RB1.

Accurate detection and segmentation of neurofibromas are essential for assessing tumor burden and longitudinal tumor size changes. Automatic convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are sensitive and vulnerable as tumors' variable anatomical location and heterogeneous appearance on MRI. In this study, wepropose deep interactive networks (DINs) to address the above limitations. User interactions guide the model to recognize complicated tumors and quickly adapt to heterogeneous tumors. We introduce a simple but effective Exponential Distance Transform (ExpDT) that converts user interactions into guide maps regarded as the spatial and appearance prior. Comparing with popular Euclidean and geodesic distances, ExpDT is more robust to various image sizes, which reserves the distribution of interactive inputs. Furthermore, to enhance the tumor-related features, we design a deep interactive module to propagate the guides into deeper layers. We train and evaluate DINs on three MRI data sets from NF1 patients. The experiment results yield significant improvements of 44% and 14% in DSC comparing with automated and other interactive methods, respectively. We also experimentally demonstrate the efficiency of DINs in reducing user burden when comparing with conventional interactive methods.",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,2022-02,Jian-Wei Zhang; Wei Chen; K Ina Ly; Xubin Zhang; Fan Yan; Justin Jordan; Gordon Harris; Scott Plotkin; Pengyi Hao; Wenli Cai

Human muscle biopsies and mouse models of NF1 deficiency in muscle show intramyocellular lipid accumulation, and preclinical data have indicated that L-carnitine supplementation can ameliorate this phenotype. The aim of this study is to examine whether daily L-carnitine supplementation is safe and feasible, and will improve muscle strength and reduce fatigue in children with NF1. A 12-week Phase 2a trial was conducted using 1000 mg daily oral levocarnitine tartrate supplementation. Recruited children were between 8 and 12 years old with a clinical diagnosis of NF1, history of muscle weakness and fatigue, and naïve to L-carnitine. Primary outcomes were safety (self-reporting, biochemical testing) and compliance. Secondary outcomes included plasma acylcarnitine profiles, functional measures (muscle strength, long jump, handwriting speed, 6-minute-walk test [6MWT]), and parent-reported questionnaires (PedsQL™, CBCL/6-18). Six children completed the trial with no self-reported adverse events. Biochemical tests for kidney and liver function were normal, and the average compliance was 95%. Plasma acylcarnitine levels were low, but within a range not clinically linked to carnitine deficiency. For strength measures, there was a mean 53% increase in dorsiflexion strength (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.89-60.75; p = 0.02) and mean 66% increase in plantarflexion strength (95% CI 12.99-134.1; p = 0.03). In terms of muscle performance, there was a mean 10% increase in long jump distance (95% CI 2.97-16.03; p = 0.01) and 6MWT distance (95% CI 5.88-75.45; p = 0.03). Comparison with the 1000 Norms Project data showed a significant improvement in Z-score for all of these measures. Parent reports showed no negative impact on quality of life, and the perceived benefits led to the majority of individuals remaining on L-carnitine after the study.

Neurofibromin may regulate metabolism, though the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here we show that neurofibromin regulates metabolic homeostasis in Drosophila via a discrete neuronal circuit. Loss of neurofibromin increases metabolic rate via a Ras GAP-related domain-dependent mechanism, increases feeding homeostatically, and alters lipid stores and turnover kinetics. The increase in metabolic rate is independent of locomotor activity, and maps to a sparse subset of neurons. Stimulating these neurons increases metabolic rate, linking their dynamic activity state to metabolism over short time scales. Our results indicate that neurofibromin regulates metabolic rate via neuronal mechanisms, suggest that cellular and systemic metabolic alterations may represent a pathophysiological mechanism in neurofibromatosis type 1, and provide a platform for investigating the cellular role of neurofibromin in metabolic homeostasis.",Nature communications,2021-07-13,Valentina Botero; Bethany A Stanhope; Elizabeth B Brown; Eliza C Grenci; Tamara Boto; Scarlet J Park; Lanikea B King; Keith R Murphy; Kenneth J Colodner; James A Walker; Alex C Keene; William W Ja; Seth M Tomchik

A certain threshold of injury-derived signal must be exceeded in order to engage MG in a regenerative response (MG's injury-response threshold). Pan-retinal Notch inhibition expands the zone of injury-responsive MG at the site of focal injury, suggesting that Notch signaling regulates MG's injury-response threshold. We found that Notch signaling enhanced chromatin accessibility and gene expression at a subset of regeneration-associated genes in the uninjured retina. Two Notch effector genes, hey1 and id2b, were identified that reflect bifurcation of the Notch signaling pathway, and differentially regulate MG's injury-response threshold and proliferation of MG-derived progenitors. Furthermore, Notch signaling component gene repression in the injured retina suggests a role for Dll4, Dlb, and Notch3 in regulating Notch signaling in MG and epistasis experiments confirm that the Dll4/Dlb-Notch3-Hey1/Id2b signaling pathway regulates MG's injury-response threshold and proliferation.",Glia,2021-12,Aresh Sahu; Sulochana Devi; Jonathan Jui; Daniel Goldman

In the setting of NF1, this cancer type frequently arises from within its common and benign precursor, plexiform neurofibroma (PN). Transformation from PN to MPNST is challenging to diagnose due to difficulties in distinguishing cross-sectional imaging results and intralesional heterogeneity resulting in biopsy sampling errors. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This multi-institutional study from the National Cancer Institute and Washington University in St. Louis used fragment size analysis and ultra-low-pass whole genome sequencing (ULP-WGS) of plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) to distinguish between MPNST and PN in patients with NF1. Following in silico enrichment for short cfDNA fragments and copy number analysis to estimate the fraction of plasma cfDNA originating from tumor (tumor fraction), we developed a noninvasive classifier that differentiates MPNST from PN with 86% pretreatment accuracy (91% specificity, 75% sensitivity) and 89% accuracy on serial analysis (91% specificity, 83% sensitivity). Healthy controls without NF1 (participants = 16, plasma samples = 16), PN (participants = 23, plasma samples = 23), and MPNST (participants = 14, plasma samples = 46) cohorts showed significant differences in tumor fraction in plasma (P = 0.001) as well as cfDNA fragment length (P < 0.001) with MPNST samples harboring shorter fragments and being enriched for tumor-derived cfDNA relative to PN and healthy controls. No other covariates were significant on multivariate logistic regression. Mutational analysis demonstrated focal NF1 copy number loss in PN and MPNST patient plasma but not in healthy controls. Greater genomic instability including alterations associated with malignant transformation (focal copy number gains in chromosome arms 1q, 7p, 8q, 9q, and 17q; focal copy number losses in SUZ12, SMARCA2, CDKN2A/B, and chromosome arms 6p and 9p) was more prominently observed in MPNST plasma. Furthermore, the sum of longest tumor diameters (SLD) visualized by cross-sectional imaging correlated significantly with paired tumor fractions in plasma from MPNST patients (r = 0.39, P = 0.024). On serial analysis, tumor fraction levels in plasma dynamically correlated with treatment response to therapy and minimal residual disease (MRD) detection before relapse. Study limitations include a modest MPNST sample size despite accrual from 2 major referral centers for this rare malignancy, and lack of uniform treatment and imaging protocols representing a real-world cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor fraction levels derived from cfDNA fragment size and copy number alteration analysis of plasma cfDNA using ULP-WGS significantly correlated with MPNST tumor burden, accurately distinguished MPNST from its benign PN precursor, and dynamically correlated with treatment response. In the future, our findings could form the basis for improved early cancer detection and monitoring in high-risk cancer-predisposed populations.",PLoS medicine,2021-08,Jeffrey J Szymanski; R Taylor Sundby; Paul A Jones; Divya Srihari; Noah Earland; Peter K Harris; Wenjia Feng; Faridi Qaium; Haiyan Lei; David Roberts; Michele Landeau; Jamie Bell; Yi Huang; Leah Hoffman; Melissa Spencer; Matthew B Spraker; Li Ding; Brigitte C Widemann; Jack F Shern; Angela C Hirbe; Aadel A Chaudhuri

The prognosis of patients with MPNSTs is poor, with most studies reporting <50% survival at five years. However, studies evaluating MPNSTs are limited and report heterogeneous results. Because no MPNST-specific evidence-based treatment guideline exists, individual institutional experiences are very informative to the field. The main objective of this study was to investigate and report MPNST prognostic clinical and genetic biomarkers from our institution's Orthopedics service experience treating 20 cases from 1992 to 2017. Most patients were treated with resection and adjuvant radiation. Extended follow-up, averaging 11.4 years (ranging 1.1 to 25.1), revealed excellent five-year survival rates: 70% for overall and 60% for metastatic disease.

Approximately 10% of these variants affect RNA splicing and are either missed by conventional DNA diagnostics or are misinterpreted by in silico splicing predictions. Therefore, a targeted RNAseq-based approach was designed to detect pathogenic RNA splicing and associated pathogenic DNA variants. For this method RNA was extracted from lymphocytes, followed by targeted RNAseq. Next, an in-house developed tool (QURNAs) was used to calculate the enrichment score (ERS) for each splicing event. This method was thoroughly tested using two different patient cohorts with known pathogenic splice-variants in NF1. In both cohorts all 56 normal reference transcript exon splice junctions, 24 previously described and 45 novel non-reference splicing events were detected. Additionally, all expected pathogenic splice-variants were detected. Eleven patients with NF1 symptoms were subsequently tested, three of which have a known NF1 DNA variant with a putative effect on RNA splicing. This effect could be confirmed for all 3. The other eight patients were previously without any molecular confirmation of their NF1-diagnosis. A deep-intronic pathogenic splice variant could now be identified for two of them (25%). These results suggest that targeted RNAseq can be successfully used to detect pathogenic RNA splicing variants in NF1.",NPJ genomic medicine,2021-11-15,R Koster; R D Brandão; D Tserpelis; C E P van Roozendaal; C N van Oosterhoud; K B M Claes; A D C Paulussen; M Sinnema; M Vreeburg; V van der Schoot; C T R M Stumpel; M P G Broen; L Spruijt; M C J Jongmans; S A J Lesnik Oberstein; A S Plomp; M Misra-Isrie; F A Duijkers; M J Louwers; R Szklarczyk; K W J Derks; H G Brunner; A van den Wijngaard; M van Geel; M J Blok

10.1117/1.JBO.26.12.125001,PMID:34935315,Analysis of muscle tissue in vivo using fiber-optic autofluorescence and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy.,"SIGNIFICANCE: Current methods for analyzing pathological muscle tissue are time consuming and rarely quantitative, and they involve invasive biopsies. Faster and less invasive diagnosis of muscle disease may be achievable using marker-free in vivo optical sensing methods. AIM: It was speculated that changes in the biochemical composition and structure of muscle associated with pathology could be measured quantitatively using visible wavelength optical spectroscopy techniques enabling automated classification. APPROACH: A fiber-optic autofluorescence (AF) and diffuse reflectance (DR) spectroscopy device was manufactured. The device and data processing techniques based on principal component analysis were validated using in situ measurements on healthy skeletal and cardiac muscle. These methods were then applied to two mouse models of genetic muscle disease: a type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF1) limb-mesenchyme knockout (Nf1Prx1  -  /  -  ) and a muscular dystrophy mouse (mdx). RESULTS: Healthy skeletal and cardiac muscle specimens were separable using AF and DR with receiver operator curve areas (ROC-AUC) of >0.79. AF and DR analyses showed optically separable changes in Nf1Prx1  -  /  -   quadriceps muscle (ROC-AUC >0.97) with no differences detected in the heart (ROC-AUC <0.67), which does not undergo gene deletion in this model. Changes in AF spectra in mdx muscle were seen between the 3 week and 10 week time points (ROC-AUC = 0.96) and were not seen in the wild-type controls (ROC-AUC = 0.58). CONCLUSION: These findings support the utility of in vivo fiber-optic AF and DR spectroscopy for the assessment of muscle tissue. This report highlights that there is considerable scope to develop this marker-free optical technology for preclinical muscle research and for diagnostic assessment of clinical myopathies and dystrophies.",Journal of biomedical optics,2021-12,Christopher J Davey; Emily R Vasiljevski; Alexandra K O'Donohue; Simon C Fleming; Aaron Schindeler

Here, the authors used a genetics-first approach to examine how Ras/MAPK pathogenic variants affect the functional organization of the brain and cognitive phenotypes including weaknesses in attention and inhibition. Functional MRI was used to examine resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) in association with Ras/MAPK pathogenic variants in children with Noonan syndrome (NS). Participants (age 4-12 years) included 39 children with NS (mean age 8.44, SD = 2.20, 25 females) and 49 typically developing (TD) children (mean age 9.02, SD = 9.02, 33 females). Twenty-eight children in the NS group and 46 in the TD group had usable MRI data and were included in final analyses. The results indicated significant hyperconnectivity for the NS group within canonical visual, ventral attention, left frontoparietal and limbic networks (p < 0.05 FWE). Higher connectivity within canonical left frontoparietal and limbic networks positively correlated with cognitive function within the NS but not the TD group. Further, the NS group demonstrated significant group differences in seed-based striatal-frontal connectivity (Z > 2.6, p < 0.05 FWE). Hyperconnectivity within canonical brain networks may represent an intermediary phenotype between Ras/MAPK pathogenic variants and cognitive phenotypes, including weaknesses in attention and inhibition. Altered striatal-frontal connectivity corresponds with smaller striatal volume and altered white matter connectivity previously documented in children with NS. These results may indicate delayed maturation and compensatory mechanisms and they are important for understanding the pathophysiology underlying cognitive phenotypes in NS and in the broader population of children with neurodevelopmental disorders.",Molecular psychiatry,2022-03,Jennifer L Bruno; Sharon B Shrestha; Allan L Reiss; Manish Saggar; Tamar Green

Clinical classification of missense variants often represents a challenge, due to lack of evidence for pathogenicity and function. This study provides a summary of NF2 missense variants, with variant classifications based on currently available evidence. NF2 missense variants were collated from pathology-associated databases and existing literature. Association for Clinical Genomic Sciences Best Practice Guidelines (2020) were followed in the application of evidence for variant interpretation and classification. The majority of NF2 missense variants remain classified as variants of uncertain significance. However, NF2 missense variants identified in gnomAD occurred at a consistent rate across the gene, while variants compiled from pathology-associated databases displayed differing rates of variation by exon of NF2. The highest rate of NF2 disease-associated variants was observed in exon 7, while lower rates were observed toward the C-terminus of the NF2 protein, merlin. Further phenotypic information associated with variants, alongside variant-specific functional analysis, is necessary for more definitive variant interpretation. Our data identified differences in frequency of NF2 missense variants by exon between gnomAD population data and NF2 disease-associated variants, suggesting a potential genotype-phenotype correlation; further work is necessary to substantiate this.",Human mutation,2022-05,Katherine V Sadler; Charlie F Rowlands; Philip T Smith; Claire L Hartley; Naomi L Bowers; Nicola Y Roberts; Jade L Harris; Andrew J Wallace; D Gareth Evans; Ludwine M Messiaen; Miriam J Smith

Single chemotherapeutic agents have shown response rates ranging from 18% to 44% in clinical trials, so there is still a high medical need to identify chemotherapeutic combination treatments that improve clinical prognosis and outcome. We screened a collection of compounds from the NCATS Mechanism Interrogation PlatE (MIPE) library in three MPNST cell lines, using cell viability and apoptosis assays. We then tested whether compounds that were active as single agents were synergistic when screened as pairwise combinations. Synergistic combinations in vitro were further evaluated in patient-derived orthotopic xenograft/orthoxenograft (PDOX) athymic models engrafted with primary MPNST matching with their paired primary-derived cell line where synergism was observed. The high-throughput screening identified 21 synergistic combinations, from which four exhibited potent synergies in a broad panel of MPNST cell lines. One of the combinations, MK-1775 with Doxorubicin, significantly reduced tumor growth in a sporadic PDOX model (MPNST-SP-01; sevenfold) and in an NF1-PDOX model (MPNST-NF1-09; fourfold) and presented greater effects in TP53 mutated MPNST cell lines. The other three combinations, all involving Panobinostat (combined with NVP-BGT226, Torin 2, or Carfilzomib), did not reduce the tumor volume in vivo at noncytotoxic doses.

Here, we examined neuronal physiology in mouse models of the tumor predisposition syndrome Neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1), with different propensities to develop nervous system cancers. We show that central and peripheral nervous system neurons from mice with tumor-causing Nf1 gene mutations exhibit hyperexcitability and increased secretion of activity-dependent tumor-promoting paracrine factors. We discovered a neurofibroma mitogen (COL1A2) produced by peripheral neurons in an activity-regulated manner, which increases NF1-deficient Schwann cell proliferation, establishing that neurofibromas are regulated by neuronal activity. In contrast, mice with the Arg1809Cys Nf1 mutation, found in NF1 patients lacking neurofibromas or optic gliomas, do not exhibit neuronal hyperexcitability or develop these NF1-associated tumors. The hyperexcitability of tumor-prone Nf1-mutant neurons results from reduced NF1-regulated hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel function, such that neuronal excitability, activity-regulated paracrine factor production, and tumor progression are attenuated by HCN channel activation. Collectively, these findings reveal that NF1 mutations act at the level of neurons to modify tumor predisposition by increasing neuronal excitability and activity-regulated paracrine factor production.",Nature communications,2022-05-19,Corina Anastasaki; Juan Mo; Ji-Kang Chen; Jit Chatterjee; Yuan Pan; Suzanne M Scheaffer; Olivia Cobb; Michelle Monje; Lu Q Le; David H Gutmann

Here we show that TRAP1 interacts with F-ATP synthase, the protein complex that provides most cellular ATP. TRAP1 competes with the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase cyclophilin D (CyPD) for binding to the oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein (OSCP) subunit of F-ATP synthase, increasing its catalytic activity and counteracting the inhibitory effect of CyPD. Electrophysiological measurements indicate that TRAP1 directly inhibits a channel activity of purified F-ATP synthase endowed with the features of the permeability transition pore (PTP) and that it reverses PTP induction by CyPD, antagonizing PTP-dependent mitochondrial depolarization and cell death. Conversely, CyPD outcompetes the TRAP1 inhibitory effect on the channel. Our data identify TRAP1 as an F-ATP synthase regulator that can influence cell bioenergetics and survival and can be targeted in pathological conditions where these processes are dysregulated, such as cancer.",Cell death and differentiation,2022-12,Giuseppe Cannino; Andrea Urbani; Marco Gaspari; Mariaconcetta Varano; Alessandro Negro; Antonio Filippi; Francesco Ciscato; Ionica Masgras; Christoph Gerle; Elena Tibaldi; Anna Maria Brunati; Giorgio Colombo; Giovanna Lippe; Paolo Bernardi; Andrea Rasola

Prior research indicates that brain structure is affected in NF1, but it is unclear how these changes relate to aspects of cognition. METHODS: 29 adolescents aged 11-17 years were compared to age and sex-matched controls. NF1 subjects were assessed using detailed multimodal measurements of working memory at baseline followed by a 3T MR scan. A voxel-based morphometry approach was used to estimate the total and regional gray matter(GM) volumetric differences between the NF1 and control groups. The working memory metrics were subjected to a principal component analysis (PCA) approach. RESULTS: The NF1 groups showed increased gray matter volumes in the thalamus, corpus striatum, dorsal midbrain and cerebellum bilaterally in the NF1 group as compared to controls. Principal component analysis on the working memory metrics in the NF1 group yielded three independent factors reflecting high memory load, low memory load and auditory working memory. Correlation analyses revealed that increased volume of posterior cingulate cortex, a key component of the default mode network (DMN) was significantly associated with poorer performance on low working memory load tasks. CONCLUSION: These results are consistent with prior work showing larger subcortical brain volumes in the NF1 cohort. The strong association between posterior cingulate cortex volume and performance on low memory load conditions supports hypotheses of deficient DMN structural development, which in turn may contribute to the cognitive impairments in NF1.",Cerebral cortex communications,2022,Cameron Sawyer; Jonathan Green; Ben Lim; Gorana Pobric; JeYoung Jung; Grace Vassallo; D Gareth Evans; Charlotte J Stagg; Laura M Parkes; Stavros Stivaros; Nils Muhlert; Shruti Garg

METHODS: In this randomized, two-period crossover study, we investigated the hypothesis that remote-microphone listening devices can ameliorate hearing and communication deficits in affected school-aged children (7-17 years). Speech perception ability in background noise was evaluated in device-active and inactive conditions using the CNC-word test. Participants were then randomized to one of two treatment sequences: (1) inactive device for two weeks (placebo), followed by active device use for two weeks, or (2) active device for 2 weeks, followed by inactive device for 2 weeks. Listening and communication ratings (LIFE-R Questionnaire) were obtained at baseline and at the end of each treatment phase. RESULTS: Each participant demonstrated functional hearing benefits with remote-microphone use. All showed a speech perception in noise increase when the device was activated with a mean phoneme-score difference of 16.4% (p < 0.001) and reported improved listening/communication abilities in the school classroom (mean difference: 23.4%; p = 0.017). DISCUSSION: Conventional hearing aids are typically ineffective as a treatment for auditory neural dysfunction, making sounds louder, but not clearer for affected individuals. In this study, we demonstrate that remote-microphone technologies are acceptable/tolerable in pediatric patients with NF1 and can ameliorate their hearing deficits.

10.3390/brainsci12060720,PMID:35741605,Integrated Drug Mining Reveals Actionable Strategies Inhibiting Plexiform Neurofibromas.,"Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common genetic tumor predisposition syndromes, affecting up to 1 in 2500 individuals. Up to half of patients with NF1 develop benign nerve sheath tumors called plexiform neurofibromas (PNs), characterized by biallelic NF1 loss. PNs can grow to immense sizes, cause extensive morbidity, and harbor a 15% lifetime risk of malignant transformation. Increasingly, molecular sequencing and drug screening data from various preclinical murine and human PN cell lines, murine models, and human PN tissues are available to help identify salient treatments for PNs. Despite this, Selumetinib, a MEK inhibitor, is the only currently FDA-approved pharmacotherapy for symptomatic and inoperable PNs in pediatric NF1 patients. The discovery of alternative and additional treatments has been hampered by the rarity of the disease, which makes prioritizing drugs to be tested in future clinical trials immensely important. Here, we propose a gene regulatory network-based integrated analysis to mine high-throughput cell line-based drug data combined with transcriptomes from resected human PN tumors. Conserved network modules were characterized and served as drug fingerprints reflecting the biological connections among drug effects and the inherent properties of PN cell lines and tissue.

There is clinical success of targeting this complex in PRC2-dependent cancers, but an unmet therapeutic need exists in PRC2-loss cancer. PRC2-inactivating mutations are a hallmark feature of high-grade malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), an aggressive sarcoma with poor prognosis and no effective targeted therapy. Through RNAi screening in MPNST, we found that PRC2 inactivation increases sensitivity to genetic or small-molecule inhibition of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), which results in enhanced cytotoxicity and antitumor response. Mechanistically, PRC2 inactivation amplifies DNMT inhibitor-mediated expression of retrotransposons, subsequent viral mimicry response, and robust cell death in part through a protein kinase R (PKR)-dependent double-stranded RNA sensor. Collectively, our observations posit DNA methylation as a safeguard against antitumorigenic cell-fate decisions in PRC2-loss cancer to promote cancer pathogenesis, which can be therapeutically exploited by DNMT1-targeted therapy. SIGNIFICANCE: PRC2 inactivation drives oncogenesis in various cancers, but therapeutically targeting PRC2 loss has remained challenging. Here we show that PRC2-inactivating mutations set up a tumor context-specific liability for therapeutic intervention via DNMT1 inhibitors, which leads to innate immune signaling mediated by sensing of derepressed retrotransposons and accompanied by enhanced cytotoxicity.

Comprehensive profiling of genetic alterations beyond NF1 inactivation and epigenetic classification of these tumors remain limited. Through next-generation sequencing, copy number analysis, and DNA methylation profiling of gliomas from 47 NF1 patients, we identified 2 molecular subgroups of NF1-associated gliomas. The first harbored biallelic NF1 inactivation only, occurred primarily during childhood, followed a more indolent clinical course, and had a unique epigenetic signature for which we propose the terminology ""pilocytic astrocytoma, arising in the setting of NF1"". The second subgroup harbored additional oncogenic alterations including CDKN2A homozygous deletion and ATRX mutation, occurred primarily during adulthood, followed a more aggressive clinical course, and was epigenetically diverse, with most tumors aligning with either high-grade astrocytoma with piloid features or various subclasses of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. Several patients were treated with small molecule MEK inhibitors that resulted in stable disease or tumor regression when used as a single agent, but only in the context of those tumors with NF1 inactivation lacking additional oncogenic alterations. Together, these findings highlight recurrently altered pathways in NF1-associated gliomas and help inform targeted therapeutic strategies for this patient population.",Acta neuropathologica,2022-10,Calixto-Hope G Lucas; Emily A Sloan; Rohit Gupta; Jasper Wu; Drew Pratt; Harish N Vasudevan; Ajay Ravindranathan; Jairo Barreto; Erik A Williams; Anny Shai; Nicholas S Whipple; Carol S Bruggers; Ossama Maher; Burt Nabors; Michael Rodriguez; David Samuel; Melandee Brown; Jason Carmichael; Rufei Lu; Kanish Mirchia; Daniel V Sullivan; Melike Pekmezci; Tarik Tihan; Andrew W Bollen; Arie Perry; Anuradha Banerjee; Sabine Mueller; Nalin Gupta; Shawn L Hervey-Jumper; Nancy Ann Oberheim Bush; Mariza Daras; Jennie W Taylor; Nicholas A Butowski; John de Groot; Jennifer L Clarke; David R Raleigh; Joseph F Costello; Joanna J Phillips; Alyssa T Reddy; Susan M Chang; Mitchel S Berger; David A Solomon
10.1093/brain/awac342,PMID:36148553,Inhibition of YAP/TAZ-driven TEAD activity prevents growth of NF2-null schwannoma and meningioma.,"Schwannoma tumours typically arise on the eighth cranial nerve and are mostly caused by loss of the tumour suppressor Merlin (NF2). There are no approved chemotherapies for these tumours and the surgical removal of the tumour carries a high risk of damage to the eighth or other close cranial nerve tissue. New treatments for schwannoma and other NF2-null tumours such as meningioma are urgently required. Using a combination of human primary tumour cells and mouse models of schwannoma, we have examined the role of the Hippo signalling pathway in driving tumour cell growth. Using both genetic ablation of the Hippo effectors YAP and TAZ as well as novel TEAD palmitoylation inhibitors, we show that Hippo signalling may be successfully targeted in vitro and in vivo to both block and, remarkably, regress schwannoma tumour growth. In particular, successful use of TEAD palmitoylation inhibitors in a preclinical mouse model of schwannoma points to their potential future clinical use. We also identify the cancer stem cell marker aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1) as a Hippo signalling target, driven by the TAZ protein in human and mouse NF2-null schwannoma cells, as well as in NF2-null meningioma cells, and examine the potential future role of this new target in halting schwannoma and meningioma tumour growth.",Brain : a journal of neurology,2023-04-19,Liyam Laraba; Lily Hillson; Julio Grimm de Guibert; Amy Hewitt; Maisie R Jaques; Tracy T Tang; Leonard Post; Emanuela Ercolano; Ganesha Rai; Shyh-Ming Yang; Daniel J Jagger; Waldemar Woznica; Philip Edwards; Aditya G Shivane; C Oliver Hanemann; David B Parkinson

Neurofibromatosis-1 (NF-1) is a tumor suppressor gene that restricts the rapid and abnormal growth and differentiation of neural cells. In the present study, lentiviral vectors were used to knock out NF-1, Ricotr (the core member of mTORC2) or NF-1+Ricotr in neural stem cells in vitro, and the NF-1, Ricotr or NF-1+Ricotr knockout neural stem cells were transplanted at the lesion site in a rat model of spinal cord injury (SCI). We first demonstrated that targeted knockout of NF-1 had an antiapoptotic effect and improved neuronal differentiation by enhancing the mTORC2/Rictor pathway of neural stem cells in vitro. Subsequently, transplanting NF-1 knockout neural stem cells into the injured site sufficiently promoted the tissue repair and functional recovery of rats with spinal cord injury by enhancing the survival and neuronal differentiation of grafted neural stem cells. Collectively, these findings reveal a prominent role of NF-1 in neural stem cell biology, which is an invaluable step forward in enhancing the benefit of neural stem cell-mediated regenerative cell therapy for spinal cord injury and identifies the transplantation of NF-1 knockout neural stem cells as a promising strategy for spinal cord injury.",Experimental & molecular medicine,2022-10,Guoliang Chen; Xianlong Li; Hongzhang Zhu; Huachuan Wu; Dacheng He; Liangyu Shi; Fuxin Wei; Xizhe Liu; Ningning Chen; Shaoyu Liu

GABAergic dysregulation underlies working memory impairments seen in NF1. This mechanistic experimental study investigates whether application of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (atDCS) can modulate GABA and working memory in NF1. Thirty-one NF1 adolescents 11-18 years, were recruited to this single-blind sham-controlled cross-over randomized trial. AtDCS or sham stimulation was applied to the left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) and MR Spectroscopy was collected before and after intervention in the left DLPFC and occipital cortex. Task-related functional MRI was collected before, during, and after stimulation. Higher baseline GABA+ in the left DLPFC was associated with faster response times on baseline working memory measures. AtDCS was seen to significantly reduced GABA+ and increase brain activation in the left DLPFC as compared to sham stimulation. Task performance was worse in the aTDCS group during stimulation but no group differences in behavioural outcomes were observed at the end of stimulation. Although our study suggests aTDCS modulates inhibitory activity in the DLPFC, further work is needed to determine whether repeated sessions of atDCS and strategies such as alternating current stimulation offer a better therapeutic approach.",Scientific reports,2022-10-31,Shruti Garg; Steve Williams; JeYoung Jung; Gorana Pobric; Tulika Nandi; Ben Lim; Grace Vassallo; Jonathan Green; D Gareth Evans; Charlotte J Stagg; Laura M Parkes; Stavros Stivaros

The relative risk and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in people with rare diseases such as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), or schwannomatosis (SWN) is unknown. METHODS: We investigated the proportions of people with NF1, NF2, or SWN in the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) electronic health record data set who had a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19. RESULTS: The cohort sizes in N3C were 2501 (NF1), 665 (NF2), and 762 (SWN). We compared these with N3C cohorts of patients with other rare diseases (98-9844 individuals) and the general non-NF population of 5.6 million. The site- and age-adjusted proportion of people with NF1, NF2, or SWN who had a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 (collectively termed positive cases) was not significantly higher than in individuals without NF or other selected rare diseases. There were no severe outcomes reported in the NF2 or SWN cohorts. The proportion of patients experiencing severe outcomes was no greater for people with NF1 than in cohorts with other rare diseases or the general population. CONCLUSION: Having NF1, NF2, or SWN does not appear to increase the risk of being SARS-CoV-2 positive or of being a patient with COVID-19 or of developing severe complications from SARS-CoV-2.",Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics,2023-02,Jineta Banerjee; Jan M Friedman; Laura J Klesse; Kaleb H Yohay; Justin T Jordan; Scott R Plotkin; Robert J Allaway; Jaishri O Blakeley
10.1158/2159-8290.CD-22-0786,PMID:36598417,Genomic Patterns of Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor (MPNST) Evolution Correlate with Clinical Outcome and Are Detectable in Cell-Free DNA.,"UNLABELLED: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), an aggressive soft-tissue sarcoma, occurs in people with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and sporadically. Whole-genome and multiregional exome sequencing, transcriptomic, and methylation profiling of 95 tumor samples revealed the order of genomic events in tumor evolution. Following biallelic inactivation of NF1, loss of CDKN2A or TP53 with or without inactivation of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) leads to extensive somatic copy-number aberrations (SCNA). Distinct pathways of tumor evolution are associated with inactivation of PRC2 genes and H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) status. Tumors with H3K27me3 loss evolve through extensive chromosomal losses followed by whole-genome doubling and chromosome 8 amplification, and show lower levels of immune cell infiltration. Retention of H3K27me3 leads to extensive genomic instability, but an immune cell-rich phenotype. Specific SCNAs detected in both tumor samples and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) act as a surrogate for H3K27me3 loss and immune infiltration, and predict prognosis. SIGNIFICANCE: MPNST is the most common cause of death and morbidity for individuals with NF1, a relatively common tumor predisposition syndrome. Our results suggest that somatic copy-number and methylation profiling of tumor or cfDNA could serve as a biomarker for early diagnosis and to stratify patients into prognostic and treatment-related subgroups.

About 15-20% of individuals with NF1 develop brain tumors and one third of these occur outside of the optic pathway. These non-optic pathway gliomas are more likely to progress to malignancy, especially in adults. Despite their low frequency, high grade gliomas have a disproportional effect on the morbidity of NF1 patients. In vitro drug combination screens have not been performed on NF1-associated HGG, hindering our ability to develop informed clinical trials. Here we present the first in vitro drug combination screen (21 compounds alone or in combination with MEK or PI3K inhibitors) on the only human NF1 patient derived HGG cell line available and on three mouse glioma cell lines derived from the NF1-P53 genetically engineered mouse model, which sporadically develop HGG. These mouse glioma cell lines were never exposed to serum, grow as spheres and express markers that are consistent with an Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cell (OPC) lineage origin. Importantly, even though the true cell of origin for HGG remains elusive, they are thought to arise from the OPC lineage. We evaluated drug sensitivities of the three murine glioma cell lines in a 3D spheroid growth assay, which more accurately reflects drug sensitivities in vivo. Excitingly, we identified six compounds targeting HDACs, BRD4, CHEK1, BMI-1, CDK1/2/5/9, and the proteasome that potently induced cell death in our NF1-associated HGG. Moreover, several of these inhibitors work synergistically with either MEK or PI3K inhibitors.

Herein, we leveraged an unbiased proteomic approach to demonstrate that male, but not female, heterozygous Nf1 ± microglia exhibit differences in protein expression, which largely reflect pathways involved in cytoskeletal organization. In keeping with these predicted defects in cytoskeletal function, only male Nf1 ± microglia had reduced process arborization and surveillance capacity.

10.1172/JCI168227,PMID:37140985,Basement membrane proteins in extracellular matrix characterize NF1 neurofibroma development and response to MEK inhibitor.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common tumor-predisposing genetic disorders. Neurofibromas are NF1-associated benign tumors. A hallmark feature of neurofibromas is an abundant collagen-rich extracellular matrix (ECM) that constitutes more than 50% of the tumor dry weight. However, little is known about the mechanism underlying ECM deposition during neurofibroma development and treatment response. We performed a systematic investigation of ECM enrichment during plexiform neurofibroma (pNF) development and identified basement membrane (BM) proteins, rather than major collagen isoforms, as the most upregulated ECM component. Following MEK inhibitor treatment, the ECM profile displayed an overall downregulation signature, suggesting ECM reduction as a therapeutic benefit of MEK inhibition. Through these proteomic studies, TGF-β1 signaling was identified as playing a role in ECM dynamics. Indeed, TGF-β1 overexpression promoted pNF progression in vivo. Furthermore, by integrating single-cell RNA sequencing, we found that immune cells including macrophages and T cells produce TGF-β1 to induce Schwann cells to produce and deposit BM proteins for ECM remodeling. Following Nf1 loss, neoplastic Schwann cells further increased BM protein deposition in response to TGF-β1. Our data delineate the regulation governing ECM dynamics in pNF and suggest that BM proteins could serve as biomarkers for disease diagnosis and treatment response.",The Journal of clinical investigation,2023-06-15,Chunhui Jiang; Ashwani Kumar; Ze Yu; Tracey Shipman; Yong Wang; Renee M McKay; Chao Xing; Lu Q Le

Unsupervised analyses of methylome and transcriptome profiles identify two distinct subgroups of MPNSTs with unique targetable oncogenic programs. We establish two subgroups of MPNSTs: SHH pathway activation in MPNST-G1 and WNT/ß-catenin/CCND1 pathway activation in MPNST-G2. Single nuclei RNA sequencing characterizes the complex cellular architecture and demonstrate that malignant cells from MPNST-G1 and MPNST-G2 have neural crest-like and Schwann cell precursor-like cell characteristics, respectively.

To address the critical need for novel therapeutics in MPNST, we aimed to establish an ex vivo 3D platform that accurately captured the genomic diversity of MPNST and could be utilized in a medium-throughput manner for drug screening studies to be validated in vivo using patient-derived xenografts (PDX). METHODS: Genomic analysis was performed on all PDX-tumor pairs. Selected PDX were harvested for assembly into 3D microtissues. Based on prior work in our labs, we evaluated drugs (trabectedin, olaparib, and mirdametinib) ex vivo and in vivo. For 3D microtissue studies, cell viability was the endpoint as assessed by Zeiss Axio Observer. For PDX drug studies, tumor volume was measured twice weekly. Bulk RNA sequencing was performed to identify pathways enriched in cells. RESULTS: We developed 13 NF1-associated MPNST-PDX and identified mutations or structural abnormalities in NF1 (100%), SUZ12 (85%), EED (15%), TP53 (15%), CDKN2A (85%), and chromosome 8 gain (77%). We successfully assembled PDX into 3D microtissues, categorized as robust (>90% viability at 48 h), good (>50%), or unusable (<50%). We evaluated drug response to ""robust"" or ""good"" microtissues, namely MN-2, JH-2-002, JH-2-079-c, and WU-225.

10.1177/17407745231178839,PMID:37269078,Perspectives of adolescents with neurofibromatosis 1 and cutaneous neurofibromas: Implications for clinical trials.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: More than 99% of individuals with neurofibromatosis 1 develop cutaneous neurofibromas, benign nerve sheath tumors that manifest as nodules on the skin. These cutaneous neurofibromas emerge with age, appearing most commonly in adolescence. Nevertheless, few data have been published on how adolescents with neurofibromatosis 1 feel about cutaneous neurofibromas. The purpose of this study was to assess the perspectives of adolescents with neurofibromatosis 1 and their caregivers regarding cutaneous neurofibroma morbidity, treatment options, and acceptable risks-benefits of treatment. METHODS: An online survey was distributed through the world's largest NF registry. Eligibility criteria included self-reported neurofibromatosis 1 diagnosis, adolescent child ages 12-17 years, ≥1 cutaneous neurofibroma, and ability to read English. The survey was designed to collect details about the adolescent's cutaneous neurofibromas, views on morbidity related to cutaneous neurofibromas, social and emotional impact of cutaneous neurofibromas, communication regarding cutaneous neurofibromas, and views regarding current and potential future cutaneous neurofibroma treatment. RESULTS: Survey respondents included 28 adolescents and 32 caregivers. Adolescents reported having several negative feelings about cutaneous neurofibromas, particularly feeling worried about the potential progression of their cutaneous neurofibromas (50%). Pruritus (34%), location (34%), appearance (31%), and number (31%) were the most bothersome cutaneous neurofibroma features. Topical medication (77%-96%), followed by oral medication (54%-93%), was the most preferred treatment modality. Adolescents and caregivers most often replied that cutaneous neurofibroma treatment should be initiated when cutaneous neurofibromas become bothersome. The majority of respondents were willing to treat cutaneous neurofibromas for at least 1 year (64%-75%). Adolescent and caregivers were least willing to risk pain (72%-78%) and nausea/vomiting (59%-81%) as a cutaneous neurofibroma treatment side effect. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that adolescents with neurofibromatosis 1 are negatively impacted by their cutaneous neurofibromas, and that both adolescents and their caregivers would be willing to try longer-term experimental treatments.","Clinical trials (London, England)",2024-02,Ashley Cannon; Kavita Y Sarin; Andrea K Petersen; Dominique C Pichard; Pamela L Wolters; Gregg Erickson; Andrés J Lessing; Peng Li; Claas Röhl; Tena Rosser; Brigitte C Widemann; Jaishri O Blakeley; Scott R Plotkin

OBJECTIVE: To compare a mind-body skills training program, the Relaxation Response Resiliency Program for NF (3RP-NF), with a health education program (Health Enhancement Program for NF; HEP-NF) for improvement of quality of life among adults with NF. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This single-blind, remote randomized clinical trial randomly assigned 228 English-speaking adults with NF from around the world on a 1:1 basis, stratified by NF type, between October 1, 2017, and January 31, 2021, with the last follow-up February 28, 2022. INTERVENTIONS: Eight 90-minute group virtual sessions of 3RP-NF or HEP-NF. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes were collected at baseline, after treatment, and at 6-month and 1-year follow-up. The primary outcomes were physical health and psychological domain scores of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF). Secondary outcomes were the social relationships and environment domain scores of the WHOQOL-BREF. Scores are reported as transformed domain scores (range, 0-100, with higher scores indicating higher QOL). Analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: Of 371 participants who underwent screening, 228 were randomized (mean [SD] age, 42.7 [14.5] years; 170 women [75%]), and 217 attended 6 or more of 8 sessions and provided posttest data. Participants in both programs improved from baseline to after treatment in primary outcomes of physical health QOL score (3RP-NF, 5.1; 95% CI, 3.2-7.0; P < .001; HEP-NF, 6.4; 95% CI, 4.6-8.3; P < .001) and psychological QOL score (3RP-NF, 8.5; 95% CI, 6.4-10.7; P < .001; HEP-NF, 9.2; 95% CI, 7.1-11.2; P < .001). Participants in the 3RP-NF group showed sustained improvements after treatment to 12 months; posttreatment improvements for the HEP-NF group diminished (between-group difference for physical health QOL score, 4.9; 95% CI, 2.1-7.7; P = .001; effect size [ES] = 0.3; and psychological QOL score, 3.7; 95% CI, 0.2-7.6; P = .06; ES = 0.2). Results were similar for secondary outcomes of social relationships and environmental QOL. There were significant between-group differences from baseline to 12 months in favor of the 3RP-NF for physical health QOL score (3.6; 95% CI, 0.5-6.6; P = .02; ES = 0.2), social relationships QOL score (6.9; 95% CI, 1.2-12.7; P = .02; ES = 0.3), and environmental QOL score (3.5; 95% CI, 0.4-6.5; P = .02; ES = 0.2). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial of 3RP-NF vs HEP-NF, benefits from 3RP-NF and HEP-NF were comparable after treatment, but at 12 months from baseline, 3RP-NF was superior to HEP-NF on all primary and secondary outcomes. Results support the implementation of 3RP-NF in routine care.

RESULTS: Patient tumor analyses identified CDK4/6 and MEK as actionable targets for MPNST therapy. Low-dose combinations of CDK4/6 and MEK inhibitors synergistically reactivated the retinoblastoma (RB1) tumor suppressor, induced cell death, and decreased clonogenic survival of MPNST cells. In immune-deficient mice, dual CDK4/6-MEK inhibition slowed tumor growth in 4 of 5 MPNST PDXs. In immunocompetent mice, combination therapy of de novo MPNSTs caused tumor regression, delayed resistant tumor outgrowth, and improved survival relative to monotherapies. Drug-sensitive tumors that regressed contained plasma cells and increased cytotoxic T cells, whereas drug-resistant tumors adopted an immunosuppressive microenvironment with elevated MHC II-low macrophages and increased tumor cell PD-L1 expression. Excitingly, CDK4/6-MEK inhibition sensitized MPNSTs to anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) with some mice showing complete tumor regression. CONCLUSIONS: CDK4/6-MEK inhibition induces a novel plasma cell-associated immune response and extended antitumor activity in MPNSTs, which dramatically enhances anti-PD-L1 therapy. These preclinical findings provide strong rationale for clinical translation of CDK4/6-MEK-ICB targeted therapies in MPNST as they may yield sustained antitumor responses and improved patient outcomes.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2023-09-01,Jordan L Kohlmeyer; Joshua J Lingo; Courtney A Kaemmer; Amanda Scherer; Akshaya Warrier; Ellen Voigt; Juan A Raygoza Garay; Gavin R McGivney; Qierra R Brockman; Amy Tang; Ana Calizo; Kai Pollard; Xiaochun Zhang; Angela C Hirbe; Christine A Pratilas; Mariah Leidinger; Patrick Breheny; Michael S Chimenti; Jessica C Sieren; Varun Monga; Munir R Tanas; David K Meyerholz; Benjamin W Darbro; Rebecca D Dodd; Dawn E Quelle

Currently, the pathogenesis of bone disorders in NF1 patients is unclear, and there are no effective preventive and treatment measures. In this study, we found that knockout of the NF1 gene reduced cAMP levels and osteogenic differentiation in an osteoblast model, and icariin activated the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway to promote osteoblast differentiation of the NF1 gene knockout cell model by increasing intracellular cAMP levels. The PKA selective inhibitor H89 significantly impaired the stimulatory effect of icariin on osteogenesis in the NF1 cell model. In this study, an osteoblast model of NF1 was successfully constructed, and icariin was applied to the cell model for the first time. The results will help to elucidate the molecular mechanism of NF1 bone disease and provide new ideas for the clinical prevention and treatment of NF1 bone disease and drug development in the future.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2023-06-30,Meng Chen; Lianhua Lu; Dong Cheng; Jing Zhang; Xinyong Liu; Jianli Zhang; Tianliang Zhang

10.1186/s11689-023-09492-y,PMID:37608248,Aberrant oscillatory activity in neurofibromatosis type 1: an EEG study of resting state and working memory.,"BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder commonly associated with impaired cognitive function. Despite the well-explored functional roles of neural oscillations in neurotypical populations, only a limited number of studies have investigated oscillatory activity in the NF1 population. METHODS: We compared oscillatory spectral power and theta phase coherence in a paediatric sample with NF1 (N = 16; mean age: 13.03 years; female: n = 7) to an age/sex-matched typically developing control group (N = 16; mean age: 13.34 years; female: n = 7) using electroencephalography measured during rest and during working memory task performance. RESULTS: Relative to typically developing children, the NF1 group displayed higher resting state slow wave power and a lower peak alpha frequency. Moreover, higher theta power and frontoparietal theta phase coherence were observed in the NF1 group during working memory task performance, but these differences disappeared when controlling for baseline (resting state) activity. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, results suggest that NF1 is characterised by aberrant resting state oscillatory activity that may contribute towards the cognitive impairments experienced in this population.

Biochemical and crystallographic data suggested that K-RasT50I increases MAPK signal output through a non-GTPase mechanism, potentially by promoting asymmetric Ras:Ras interactions between T50 and E162. We generated a ""switchable"" system in which K-Ras mutant proteins expressed at physiologic levels supplant the fms like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) dependency of MOLM-13 leukemia cells lacking endogenous KRAS and used this system to interrogate single or compound G12D, T50I, D154Q, and E162L mutations. These studies support a key role for the asymmetric lateral assembly of K-Ras in a plasma membrane-distal orientation that promotes the formation of active Ras:Raf complexes in a membrane-proximal conformation. Disease-causing mutations such as T50I are a valuable starting point for illuminating normal Ras function, elucidating mechanisms of disease, and identifying potential therapeutic opportunities for Rasopathy disorders and cancer.",JCI insight,2023-09-08,Pan-Yu Chen; Benjamin J Huang; Max Harris; Christopher Boone; Weijie Wang; Heidi Carias; Brian Mesiona; Daniela Mavrici; Amanda C Kohler; Gideon Bollag; Chao Zhang; Ying Zhang; Kevin Shannon

During formation of PN, a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) develops, with recruitment of neoplastic and non-neoplastic cell types being critical for growth and progression. Due to the cohesive cellularity of PN, single-cell RNA-sequencing is difficult and may result in a loss of detection of critical cellular subpopulations. To bypass this barrier, we performed single-nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) on 8 frozen PN samples, and integrated this with spatial transcriptomics (ST) in 4 PN samples and immunohistochemistry to provide morphological context to transcriptomic data. SnRNA-seq analysis definitively charted the heterogeneous cellular subpopulations in the PN TME, with the predominant fraction being fibroblast subtypes. PN showed a remarkable amount of inter-sample homogeneity regarding cellular subpopulation proportions despite being resected from a variety of anatomical locations. ST analysis identified distinct cellular subpopulations which were annotated using snRNA-seq data and correlated with histological features. Schwann cell/fibroblast interactions were identified by receptor/ligand interaction analysis demonstrating a high probability of Neurexin 1/Neuroligin 1 (NRXN1/NLGN1) receptor-ligand cross-talk predicted between fibroblasts and non-myelinated Schwann cells (NM-SC) and subtypes, respectively. We observed aberrant expression of NRXN1 and NLGN1 in our PN snRNA-seq data compared to a normal mouse sciatic nerve single-cell RNA-seq dataset. This pathway has never been described in PN and may indicate a clear and direct communication pathway between putative NM-SC cells of origin and surrounding fibroblasts, potentially driving disease progression. SnRNA-seq integrated with spatial transcriptomics advances our understanding of the complex cellular heterogeneity of PN TME and identify potential novel communication pathways that may drive disease progression, a finding that could provide translational therapy options for patients with these devastating tumors of childhood and early adulthood.",Acta neuropathologica communications,2023-09-28,Vladimir Amani; Kent A Riemondy; Rui Fu; Andrea M Griesinger; Enrique Grimaldo; Graziella Ribeiro De Sousa; Ahmed Gilani; Molly Hemenway; Nicholas K Foreman; Andrew M Donson; Nicholas Willard

Children with NF1 are prone to the development of multiple nervous system abnormalities, including autism and brain tumors, which could reflect the effect of NF1 mutation on microglia function. Using heterozygous Nf1-mutant mice, we previously demonstrated that impaired purinergic signaling underlies deficits in microglia process extension and phagocytosis in situ. To determine whether these abnormalities are also observed in human microglia in the setting of NF1, we leveraged an engineered isogenic series of human induced pluripotent stem cells to generate human microglia-like (hiMGL) cells heterozygous for three different NF1 gene mutations found in patients with NF1. Whereas all NF1-mutant and isogenic control hiMGL cells expressed classical microglia markers and exhibited similar transcriptomes and cytokine/chemokine release profiles, only NF1-mutant hiMGL cells had defects in P2X receptor activation, phagocytosis and motility. Taken together, these findings indicate that heterozygous NF1 mutations impair a subset of the functional properties of human microglia, which could contribute to the neurological abnormalities seen in children with NF1.",Disease models & mechanisms,2023-12-01,Leonard D Kuhrt; Edyta Motta; Nirmeen Elmadany; Hannah Weidling; Raphaela Fritsche-Guenther; Ibrahim E Efe; Olivia Cobb; Jit Chatterjee; Lucy G Boggs; Marina Schnauß; Sebastian Diecke; Marcus Semtner; Corina Anastasaki; David H Gutmann; Helmut Kettenmann

However, the exact pathogenesis of the disease is still unclear. This study aims to use bioinformatics analyses to identify potential hub genes and therapeutic. We retrieved the mRNA expression profiles (GSE108524 and GSE141801) of NF2-VS from the database, and selected the leading 25% genes with the most variance across samples for weighted correlation network analysis. Subsequently, we conducted gene ontology term and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes signaling network enrichment analyses. The STRING database was employed for protein-protein interaction (PPI) axis construction. The mRNA-miRNA modulatory network was generated via the miRTarBase database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified via the R package ""limma"" in both datasets, and hub genes were screened via intersection of common DEGs, candidate hub genes from the PPI axis, and candidate hub genes from the key module. Finally, common DEGs were uploaded onto the connectivity map database to determine drug candidates. Based on our observations, the blue module exhibited the most significant relation to NF2-VS, and it included the NF2 gene. Using enrichment analysis, we demonstrated that the blue modules were intricately linked to modulations of cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, junction, and actin skeleton. Overall, 356 common DEGs were screened in both datasets, and 33 genes carrying a degree > 15 were chosen as candidate hub genes in the PPI axis. Subsequently, 4 genes, namely, GLUL, CAV1, MYH11, and CCND1 were recognized as real hub genes. In addition, 10 drugs with enrichment scores < -0.7 were identified as drug candidates. Our conclusions offered a novel insight into the potential underlying mechanisms behind NF2-VS.

Despite similar histologic appearance, these neoplasms exhibit diverse evolutionary trajectories, with a subset progressing to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), the leading cause of premature death in individuals with NF1. Malignant transformation of PNF often occurs through the development of atypical neurofibroma (ANF) precursor lesions characterized by distinct histopathologic features and CDKN2A copy-number loss. Although genomic studies have uncovered key driver events promoting tumor progression, the transcriptional changes preceding malignant transformation remain poorly defined. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Here we resolve gene-expression profiles in PNST across the neurofibroma-to-MPNST continuum in NF1 patients and mouse models, revealing early molecular features associated with neurofibroma evolution and transformation. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrate that ANF exhibit enhanced signatures of antigen presentation and immune response, which are suppressed as malignant transformation ensues. MPNST further displayed deregulated survival and mitotic fidelity pathways, and targeting key mediators of these pathways, CENPF and BIRC5, disrupted the growth and viability of human MPNST cell lines and primary murine Nf1-Cdkn2a-mutant Schwann cell precursors. Finally, neurofibromas contiguous with MPNST manifested distinct alterations in core oncogenic and immune surveillance programs, suggesting that early molecular events driving disease progression may precede histopathologic evidence of malignancy. CONCLUSIONS: If validated prospectively in future studies, these signatures may serve as molecular diagnostic tools to augment conventional histopathologic diagnosis by identifying neurofibromas at high risk of undergoing malignant transformation, facilitating risk-adapted care.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2024-03-01,Dana K Mitchell; Breanne Burgess; Emily E White; Abbi E Smith; Elizabeth A Sierra Potchanant; Henry Mang; Brooke E Hickey; Qingbo Lu; Shaomin Qian; Waylan Bessler; Xiaohong Li; Li Jiang; Kylee Brewster; Constance Temm; Andrew Horvai; Eric A Albright; Melissa L Fishel; Christine A Pratilas; Steven P Angus; D Wade Clapp; Steven D Rhodes

PNs may have complex, diffused, and irregular shapes. The objective of this work was to develop a volumetric quantification method for PNs as clinical assessment is currently based on unidimensional measurement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A semi-automatic segmentation technique based on mean magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) intensity thresholding (SSTMean) was developed and compared to a similar and previously published technique based on minimum image intensity thresholding (SSTMini). The performance (volume and computation time) of the two techniques was compared to manual tracings of 15 tumors of different locations, shapes, and sizes. Performance was also assessed using different MRI sequences. Reproducibility was assessed by inter-observer analysis. RESULTS: When compared to manual tracing, quantification performed with SSTMean was not significantly different (mean difference: 1.2 %), while volumes computed by SSTMini were significantly different (p < .0001, mean difference: 13.4 %). Volumes quantified by SSTMean were also significantly different than the ones assessed by SSTMini (p < .0001). Using SSTMean, volumes quantified with short TI inversion recovery, T1-, and T2-weighted imaging were not significantly different. Computation times used by SSTMean and SSTMini were significantly lower than for manual segmentation (p < .0001). The highest difference measured by two users was 8 cm CONCLUSION: Our method showed accuracy compared to a current gold standard (manual tracing) and reproducibility between users. The refined segmentation threshold and the possibility to define multiple regions-of-interest to initiate segmentation may have contributed to its performance. The versatility and speed of our method may prove useful to better monitor volumetric changes in lesions of patients enrolled in clinical trials to assessing response to therapy.",Heliyon,2024-01-15,Dorsa Sadat Kiaei; Ramy El-Jalbout; Jean-Claude Décarie; Sébastien Perreault; Mathieu Dehaes
10.1172/jci.insight.168826,PMID:38175707,Unbalancing cAMP and Ras/MAPK pathways as a therapeutic strategy for cutaneous neurofibromas.,"Cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs) are benign Schwann cell (SC) tumors arising from subepidermal glia. Individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) may develop thousands of cNFs, which greatly affect their quality of life. cNF growth is driven by the proliferation of NF1-/- SCs and their interaction with the NF1+/- microenvironment. We analyzed the crosstalk between human cNF-derived SCs and fibroblasts (FBs), identifying an expression signature specific to the SC-FB interaction. We validated the secretion of proteins involved in immune cell migration, suggesting a role of SC-FB crosstalk in immune cell recruitment. The signature also captured components of developmental signaling pathways, including the cAMP elevator G protein-coupled receptor 68 (GPR68). Activation of Gpr68 by ogerin in combination with the MEK inhibitor (MEKi) selumetinib reduced viability and induced differentiation and death of human cNF-derived primary SCs, a result corroborated using an induced pluripotent stem cell-derived 3D neurofibromasphere model. Similar results were obtained using other Gpr68 activators or cAMP analogs/adenylyl cyclase activators in combination with selumetinib. Interestingly, whereas primary SC cultures restarted their proliferation after treatment with selumetinib alone was stopped, the combination of ogerin-selumetinib elicited a permanent halt on SC expansion that persisted after drug removal. These results indicate that unbalancing the Ras and cAMP pathways by combining MEKi and cAMP elevators could be used as a potential treatment for cNFs.",JCI insight,2024-01-04,Helena Mazuelas; Miriam Magallón-Lorenz; Itziar Uriarte-Arrazola; Alejandro Negro; Inma Rosas; Ignacio Blanco; Elisabeth Castellanos; Conxi Lázaro; Bernat Gel; Meritxell Carrió; Eduard Serra

Approximately a quarter of NF1 patients experience the development of plexiform neurofibromas, potentially progressing into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). FT895, an HDAC11 inhibitor, exhibits potent anti-tumor effects on MPNST cells and enhances the cytotoxicity of cordycepin against MPNST. The study aims to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying FT895's efficacy against MPNST cells. Initially, our study unveiled that FT895 disrupts mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Post-FT895 treatment, reactive oxygen species (ROS) in MPNST notably increased, while mitochondrial DNA copy numbers decreased significantly. Seahorse analysis indicated a considerable decrease in basal, maximal, and ATP-production-coupled respiration following FT895 treatment. Immunostaining highlighted FT895's role in promoting mitochondrial aggregation without triggering mitophagy, possibly due to reduced levels of XBP1, Parkin, and PINK1 proteins. Moreover, the study using CHIP-qPCR analysis revealed a significant reduction in the copy numbers of promoters of the MPV17L2, POLG, TFAM, PINK1, and Parkin genes. The RNA-seq analysis underscored the prominent role of the HIF-1α signaling pathway post-FT895 treatment, aligning with the observed impairment in mitochondrial respiration. In summary, the study pioneers the revelation that FT895 induces mitochondrial respiratory damage in MPNST cells.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023-12-24,Po-Yuan Huang; I-An Shih; Ying-Chih Liao; Huey-Ling You; Ming-Jen Lee

NF1 is one of the top driver mutations in sporadic breast cancer such that 27 % of breast cancers exhibit damaging NF1 alterations. NF1 loss-of-function is a frequent event in the genomic evolution of estrogen receptor (ER)+ breast cancer metastasis and endocrine resistance. Individuals with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF) - a disorder caused by germline NF1 mutations - have an increased risk of dying from breast cancer [1-4]. NF-related breast cancers are associated with decreased overall survival compared to sporadic breast cancer. Despite numerous studies interrogating the role of RAS mutations in tumor metabolism, no study has comprehensively profiled the NF1-deficient breast cancer metabolome to define patterns of energetic and metabolic reprogramming. The goals of this investigation were (1) to define the role of NF1 deficiency in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer metabolic reprogramming and (2) to identify potential targeted pathway and metabolic inhibitor combination therapies for NF1-deficient ER + breast cancer. METHODS: We employed two ER+ NF1-deficient breast cancer models: (1) an NF1-deficient MCF7 breast cancer cell line to model sporadic breast cancer, and (2) three distinct, Nf1-deficient rat models to model NF-related breast cancer [1]. IncuCyte proliferation analysis was used to measure the effect of NF1 deficiency on cell proliferation and drug response. Protein quantity was assessed by Western Blot analysis. We then used RNAseq to investigate the transcriptional effect of NF1 deficiency on global and metabolism-related transcription. We measured cellular energetics using Agilent Seahorse XF-96 Glyco Stress Test and Mito Stress Test assays. We performed stable isotope labeling and measured [U- RESULTS: Our results revealed that NF1 deficiency enhanced cell proliferation, altered neurofibromin expression, and increased RAS and PI3K/AKT pathway signaling while constraining oxidative ATP production and restricting energetic flexibility. Neurofibromin deficiency also increased glutamine influx into TCA intermediates and dramatically increased lipid pools, especially triglycerides (TG). Lastly, NF1 deficiency alters the synergy between metabolic inhibitors and traditional targeted inhibitors. This includes increased synergy with inhibitors targeting glycolysis, glutamine metabolism, mitochondrial fatty acid transport, and TG synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: NF1 deficiency drives metabolic reprogramming in ER+ breast cancer. This reprogramming is characterized by oxidative ATP constraints, glutamine TCA influx, and lipid pool expansion, and these metabolic changes introduce novel metabolic-to-targeted inhibitor synergies.",Molecular metabolism,2024-02,Rachel Rae J House; Elizabeth A Tovar; Luke N Redlon; Curt J Essenburg; Patrick S Dischinger; Abigail E Ellis; Ian Beddows; Ryan D Sheldon; Evan C Lien; Carrie R Graveel; Matthew R Steensma

Functional interactions between NF1 and NF2 and broader mechanisms underlying malignant transformation of the Schwann lineage are unclear. Here we integrate bulk and single-cell genomics, biochemistry, and pharmacology across human samples, cell lines, and mouse allografts to identify cellular de-differentiation mechanisms driving malignant transformation and treatment resistance. We find DNA methylation groups of Schwann cell tumors can be distinguished by differentiation programs that correlate with response to the MEK inhibitor selumetinib. Functional genomic screening in NF1-mutant tumor cells reveals NF2 loss and PAK activation underlie selumetinib resistance, and we find that concurrent MEK and PAK inhibition is effective in vivo.

Here we show epigenetic reprogramming shapes the cellular landscape of schwannomas, the most common tumors of the peripheral nervous system. We find schwannomas are comprised of 2 molecular groups that are distinguished by activation of neural crest or nerve injury pathways that specify tumor cell states and the architecture of the tumor immune microenvironment. Moreover, we find radiotherapy is sufficient for interconversion of neural crest schwannomas to immune-enriched schwannomas through epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming. To define mechanisms underlying schwannoma groups, we develop a technique for simultaneous interrogation of chromatin accessibility and gene expression coupled with genetic and therapeutic perturbations in single-nuclei.

Mild to profound hearing loss and tinnitus are common symptoms reported by individuals with neurofibromatosis type 2. While tinnitus is known to have a significant and negative impact on the quality of life of individuals from the general population, the impact on individuals with neurofibromatosis type 2 is unknown. Consensus regarding the selection of suitable patient-reported outcome measures for assessment could advance further research into tinnitus in neurofibromatosis type 2 patients. The purpose of this work is to achieve a consensus recommendation by the Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis International Collaboration for patient-reported outcome measures used to evaluate quality of life in the domain of tinnitus for neurofibromatosis type 2 clinical trials. METHODS: The Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis Patient-Reported Outcomes Communication Subgroup systematically evaluated patient-reported outcome measures of quality of life in the domain of tinnitus for individuals with neurofibromatosis type 2 using previously published Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis rating procedures. Of the 19 identified patient-reported outcome measures, 3 measures were excluded because they were not validated as an outcome measure or could not have been used as a single outcome measure for a clinical trial. Sixteen published patient-reported outcome measures for the domain of tinnitus were scored and compared on their participant characteristics, item content, psychometric properties, and feasibility for use in clinical trials. RESULTS: The Tinnitus Functional Index was identified as the most highly rated measure for the assessment of tinnitus in populations with neurofibromatosis type 2, due to strengths in the areas of item content, psychometric properties, feasibility, and available scores.

The PlexiQoL questionnaire is a disease-specific QoL measure for adults with NF1-associated plexiform neurofibromas. The aim of this study was to adapt and validate a Dutch version of the PlexiQoL for the Netherlands. METHODS: The PlexiQoL was translated using the dual-panel methodology, followed by cognitive debriefing interviews to assess face and content validity. The psychometric properties were evaluated by administering the questionnaire on two separate occasions to a sample of adults with NF1 and plexiform neurofibromas. Feasibility was evaluated by the presence of floor/ceiling effects. Reliability was assessed by evaluating Cronbach's alpha coefficient and test-retest reliability, using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to check for known group validity. The Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) questionnaire was used as comparator questionnaire to evaluate convergent validity. RESULTS: The translation and cognitive debriefing interviews resulted in a Dutch version of the PlexiQoL that reflected the original concept and underlying semantic meanings of the UK English version. Forty participants completed the validation survey. The Dutch PlexiQoL demonstrated excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's α 0.825) and test-retest reliability (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.928). The questionnaire detected differences in PlexiQoL scores between participants based on self-reported general health and disease severity. Convergent validity was confirmed for relevant NHP subsections. CONCLUSIONS: The Dutch PlexiQoL demonstrated excellent psychometric properties and can be reliably used to measure plexiform neurofibroma-related QoL in adults with NF1 in the Netherlands.",Journal of patient-reported outcomes,2024-03-18,Britt A E Dhaenens; Sarah A van Dijk; Walter Taal; D Christine Noordhoek; Anna Coffey; Stephen P McKenna; Rianne Oostenbrink
10.1172/JCI176748,PMID:38502231,STING activation reprograms the microenvironment to sensitize NF1-related malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors for immunotherapy.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene that encodes neurofibromin, a RAS GTPase-activating protein. Inactivating NF1 mutations cause hyperactivation of RAS-mediated signaling, resulting in the development of multiple neoplasms, including malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). MPNSTs are an aggressive tumor and the main cause of mortality in patients with NF1. MPNSTs are difficult to resect and refractory to chemo- and radiotherapy, and no molecular therapies currently exist. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is an approach to treat inoperable, undruggable cancers like MPNST, but successful outcomes require an immune cell-rich tumor microenvironment. While MPNSTs are noninflamed ""cold"" tumors, here, we converted MPNSTs into T cell-inflamed ""hot"" tumors by activating stimulator of IFN genes (STING) signaling. Mouse genetic and human xenograft MPNST models treated with a STING agonist plus ICB exhibited growth delay via increased apoptotic cell death. This strategy offers a potential treatment regimen for MPNSTs.",The Journal of clinical investigation,2024-03-19,Bandarigoda N Somatilaka; Laasya Madana; Ali Sadek; Zhiguo Chen; Sanjay Chandrasekaran; Renee M McKay; Lu Q Le
10.1371/journal.pone.0302017,PMID:38603731,Raman difference spectroscopy and U-Net convolutional neural network for molecular analysis of cutaneous neurofibroma.,"In Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), peripheral nerve sheaths tumors are common, with cutaneous neurofibromas resulting in significant aesthetic, painful and functional problems requiring surgical removal. To date, determination of adequate surgical resection margins-complete tumor removal while attempting to preserve viable tissue-remains largely subjective. Thus, residual tumor extension beyond surgical margins or recurrence of the disease may frequently be observed. Here, we introduce Shifted-Excitation Raman Spectroscopy in combination with deep neural networks for the future perspective of objective, real-time diagnosis, and guided surgical ablation. The obtained results are validated through established histological methods. In this study, we evaluated the discrimination between cutaneous neurofibroma (n = 9) and adjacent physiological tissues (n = 25) in 34 surgical pathological specimens ex vivo at a total of 82 distinct measurement loci. Based on a convolutional neural network (U-Net), the mean raw Raman spectra (n = 8,200) were processed and refined, and afterwards the spectral peaks were assigned to their respective molecular origin. Principal component and linear discriminant analysis was used to discriminate cutaneous neurofibromas from physiological tissues with a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 97.3%, and overall classification accuracy of 97.6%. The results enable the presented optical, non-invasive technique in combination with artificial intelligence as a promising candidate to ameliorate both, diagnosis and treatment of patients affected by cutaneous neurofibroma and NF1.",PloS one,2024,Levi Matthies; Hendrik Amir-Kabirian; Medhanie T Gebrekidan; Andreas S Braeuer; Ulrike S Speth; Ralf Smeets; Christian Hagel; Martin Gosau; Christian Knipfer; Reinhard E Friedrich
10.1016/j.bpsc.2024.04.003,PMID:38621478,Influences of RASopathies on Neuroanatomical Variation in Children.,"BACKGROUND: RASopathies are a group of disorders characterized by pathogenic mutations in the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (Ras/MAPK) signaling pathway. Distinct pathogenic variants in genes encoding proteins in the Ras/MAPK pathway cause Noonan syndrome (NS) and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), which are associated with increased risk for autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. METHODS: This study examined the effect of RASopathies (NS and NF1) on human neuroanatomy, specifically on surface area (SA), cortical thickness (CT), and subcortical volumes. Using vertex-based analysis for cortical measures and Desikan region of interest parcellation for subcortical volumes, we compared structural T1-weighted images of children with RASopathies (n = 91, mean age = 8.81 years, SD = 2.12) to those of sex- and age-matched typically developing children (n = 74, mean age = 9.07 years, SD = 1.77). RESULTS: Compared with typically developing children, RASopathies had convergent effects on SA and CT, exhibiting increased SA in the precentral gyrus, decreased SA in occipital regions, and thinner CT in the precentral gyrus. RASopathies exhibited divergent effects on subcortical volumes, with syndrome-specific influences from NS and NF1. Overall, children with NS showed decreased volumes in striatal and thalamic structures, and children with NF1 displayed increased volumes in the hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals the converging and diverging neuroanatomical effects of RASopathies on human neurodevelopment. The convergence of cortical effects on SA and CT indicates a shared influence of Ras/MAPK hyperactivation on the human brain. Therefore, considering these measures as objective outcome indicators for targeted treatments is imperative.",Biological psychiatry.

These gliomas exhibit loss of the neurofibromin gene [neurofibromin type 1 (NF1)], and 10% to 15% of sporadic high-grade gliomas have somatic NF1 alterations. Loss of NF1 leads to hyperactive RAS signaling, creating opportunity given the established efficacy of MEK inhibitors in plexiform neurofibromas and some individuals with low-grade glioma. We observed that NF1-deficient glioblastoma neurospheres were sensitive to the combination of an MEK inhibitor (mirdametinib) with irradiation, as evidenced by synergistic inhibition of cell growth, colony formation, and increased cell death. In contrast, NF1-intact neurospheres were not sensitive to the combination, despite complete ERK pathway inhibition. No neurosphere lines exhibited enhanced sensitivity to temozolomide combined with mirdametinib. Mirdametinib decreased transcription of homologous recombination genes and RAD51 foci, associated with DNA damage repair, in sensitive models. Heterotopic xenograft models displayed synergistic growth inhibition to mirdametinib combined with irradiation in NF1-deficient glioma xenografts but not in those with intact NF1. In sensitive models, benefits were observed at least 3 weeks beyond the completion of treatment, including sustained phosphor-ERK inhibition on immunoblot and decreased Ki-67 expression. These observations demonstrate synergistic activity between mirdametinib and irradiation in NF1-deficient glioma models and may have clinical implications for patients with gliomas that harbor germline or somatic NF1 alterations.",Molecular cancer therapeutics,2024-09-04,Maria Ioannou; Kriti Lalwani; Abiola A Ayanlaja; Viveka Chinnasamy; Christine A Pratilas; Karisa C Schreck

The French cNF-Skindex is the first questionnaire to specifically assess cNF-related QoL in patients with NF1. We aimed to adapt and validate a Dutch version of the cNF-Skindex. METHODS: The questionnaire was translated using forward and backwards translation, and subsequently administered to a sample of 59 patients on two separate occasions. Feasibility was evaluated by the presence of floor/ceiling effects. Reliability was assessed by evaluating internal consistency and test-retest reliability, by calculating Cronbach's alpha and Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. The EQ-5D-5L and SF-36 were used to evaluate convergent validity, using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. An exploratory factor analysis was performed to study the data's internal structure. Multivariable linear regression was used to model the relationship between patient characteristics and the cNF-Skindex. RESULTS: The Dutch cNF-Skindex demonstrated excellent feasibility and reliability (Cronbach's alpha 0.96, test-retest correlation coefficient 0.88). Convergent validity was confirmed for the EQ-5D-5L and relevant SF-36 scales. All items and subdomains from the original questionnaire were confirmed following exploratory factor analysis.

Most patients with NF1 develop skin lesions called cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs). Currently the only approved therapeutic for NF1 is selumetinib, a mitogen -activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor. The purpose of this study was to analyze the transcriptome of cNF tumors before and on selumetinib treatment to understand both tumor composition and response. We obtained biopsy sets of tumors both pre- and on- selumetinib treatment from the same individuals and were able to collect sets from four separate individuals. We sequenced mRNA from 5844 nuclei and identified 30,442 genes in the untreated group and sequenced 5701 nuclei and identified 30,127 genes in the selumetinib treated group. We identified and quantified distinct populations of cells (Schwann cells, fibroblasts, pericytes, myeloid cells, melanocytes, keratinocytes, and two populations of endothelial cells). While we anticipated that cell proportions might change with treatment, we did not identify any one cell population that changed significantly, likely due to an inherent level of variability between tumors. We also evaluated differential gene expression based on drug treatment in each cell type. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was also used to identify pathways that differ on treatment. As anticipated, we identified a significant decrease in ERK/MAPK signaling in cells including Schwann cells but most specifically in myeloid cells. Interestingly, there is a significant decrease in opioid signaling in myeloid and endothelial cells; this downward trend is also observed in Schwann cells and fibroblasts. Cell communication was assessed by RNA velocity, Scriabin, and CellChat analyses which indicated that Schwann cells and fibroblasts have dramatically altered cell states defined by specific gene expression signatures following treatment (RNA velocity). There are dramatic changes in receptor-ligand pairs following treatment (Scriabin), and robust intercellular signaling between virtually all cell types associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) pathways (Collagen, Laminin, Fibronectin, and Nectin) is downregulated after treatment.

The main goal of screening is to detect symptomatic OPGs that require treatment. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been suggested as a tool for detection of neuro-retinal damage. AIMS: To investigate whether the ganglion cell layer assessed by OCT is a reliable measure to identify and detect relapses of symptomatic OPGs in children with NF1. METHODS: Children (3-6 years) with NF1, with and without known OPG and children with sporadic OPG (S-OPG) resident in the Stockholm area, were invited and followed in a prospective study during a three-year period. Brain magnetic resonance tomography (MRI) had been performed in children with symptoms of OPG. Outcome measures were VA in logMAR, visual field index (VFI), average thicknesses of the ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL), and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL). RESULTS: There were 25 children with MRI-verified OPG and 52 with NF1 without symptomatic OPG. Eyes from NF1 patients without symptoms of OPG showed significantly better results in all four analyzed parameters compared to eyes with NF1-associated OPG. Mean GC-IPL measurements seemed stable and reliable, significantly correlated to pRNFL (correlation coefficient (r) = 0.662, confidence interval (CI) = .507 to .773 p<0.001), VA (r = -0.661, CI = -7.45 to -.551, p<0.001) and VFI (r = 0.644, CI = .452 to .774, p<0.001). GC-IPL measurements were easy to obtain and acquired at considerably younger age than pRNFL (5.6±1.5 vs 6.8±1.3; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The mean GC-IPL thickness could distinguish well between eyes with OPG and eyes without symptomatic OPG in children with NF1. As thinning of GC-IPL assessed with OCT could indicate underlying OPG, it should be included in the screening protocol of children with questionable VA measurements and in particular in children with NF1.",PloS one,2024,Urszula Arnljots; Maria Nilsson; Roberto Bolzani; Mariagrazia Benassi; Ulrika Sandvik; Daniel Martin Munoz; Klas Blomgren; Kerstin Hellgren

In this study, we describe a cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragmentomic approach that distinguishes nonmalignant, premalignant, and malignant forms of PNST in the cancer predisposition syndrome, NF1. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: cfDNA was isolated from plasma samples of a novel cohort of 101 patients with NF1 and 21 healthy controls and underwent whole-genome sequencing. We investigated diagnosis-specific signatures of copy-number alterations with in silico size selection as well as fragment profiles. Fragmentomics were analyzed using complementary feature types: bin-wise fragment size ratios, end motifs, and fragment non-negative matrix factorization signatures. RESULTS: The novel cohort of patients with NF1 validated that our previous cfDNA copy-number alteration-based approach identifies malignant PNST (MPNST) but cannot distinguish between benign and premalignant states. Fragmentomic methods were able to differentiate premalignant states including atypical neurofibromas (AN). Fragmentomics also adjudicated AN cases suspicious for MPNST, correctly diagnosing samples noninvasively, which could have informed clinical management. CONCLUSIONS: Novel cfDNA fragmentomic signatures distinguish AN from benign plexiform neurofibromas and MPNST, enabling more precise clinical diagnosis and management.

While the molecular mechanisms underlying NF1 pathogenesis have been extensively studied, the development of effective therapeutic strategies remains a challenge. This paper presents the development and validation of a novel biomaterial testing model to enhance our understanding of NF1 pathophysiology, disease mechanisms and evaluate potential therapeutic interventions. Our long-term goal is to develop an invitro model of NF1 to evaluate drug targets. We have developed an in vitro system to test the cellular behavior of NF1 patient derived cells on electroconductive aligned nanofibrous biomaterials with electrical stimulatory cues. We hypothesized that cells cultured on electroconductive biomaterial will undergo morphological changes and variations in cell proliferation that could be further enhanced with the combination of exogenous electrical stimulation (ES). In this study, we developed electrospun Hyaluronic Acid-Carbon Nanotube (HA-CNT) nanofiber scaffolds to mimic the axon's topographical and bioelectrical cues that influence neurofibroma growth and development. The cellular behavior was qualitatively and quantitively analyzed through immunofluorescent stains, Alamar blue assays and ELISA assays. Schwann cells from NF1 patients appear to have lost their ability to respond to electrical stimulation in the development and regeneration range, which was seen through changes in morphology, proliferation and NGF release. Without stimulation, the conductive material enhances NF1 SC behavior. Wild-type SC respond to electrical stimulation with increased cell proliferation and NGF release. Using this system, we can better understand the interaction between axons and SC that lead to tumor formation, homeostasis and regeneration.",PloS one,2024,Judy Senanayake; Raymond R Mattingly; Harini G Sundararaghavan
10.1002/1878-0261.13704,PMID:39129390,Inhibition of autophagy as a novel treatment for neurofibromatosis type 1 tumors.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder caused by mutation of the NF1 gene that is associated with various symptoms, including the formation of benign tumors, called neurofibromas, within nerves. Drug treatments are currently limited. The mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor selumetinib is used for a subset of plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) but is not always effective and can cause side effects. Therefore, there is a clear need to discover new drugs to target NF1-deficient tumor cells. Using a Drosophila cell model of NF1, we performed synthetic lethal screens to identify novel drug targets. We identified 54 gene candidates, which were validated with variable dose analysis as a secondary screen. Pathways associated with five candidates could be targeted using existing drugs. Among these, chloroquine (CQ) and bafilomycin A1, known to target the autophagy pathway, showed the greatest potential for selectively killing NF1-deficient Drosophila cells. When further investigating autophagy-related genes, we found that 14 out of 30 genes tested had a synthetic lethal interaction with NF1. These 14 genes are involved in multiple aspects of the autophagy pathway and can be targeted with additional drugs that mediate the autophagy pathway, although CQ was the most effective. The lethal effect of autophagy inhibitors was conserved in a panel of human NF1-deficient Schwann cell lines, highlighting their translational potential. The effect of CQ was also conserved in a Drosophila NF1 in vivo model and in a xenografted NF1-deficient tumor cell line grown in mice, with CQ treatment resulting in a more significant reduction in tumor growth than selumetinib treatment. Furthermore, combined treatment with CQ and selumetinib resulted in a further reduction in NF1-deficient cell viability. In conclusion, NF1-deficient cells are vulnerable to disruption of the autophagy pathway. This pathway represents a promising target for the treatment of NF1-associated tumors, and we identified CQ as a candidate drug for the treatment of NF1 tumors.",Molecular oncology,2025-03,Megan Stevens; Yuanli Wang; Stephanie J Bouley; Torrey R Mandigo; Aditi Sharma; Sonali Sengupta; Amy Housden; Norbert Perrimon; James A Walker; Benjamin E Housden

However, clinical trials investigating cNF treatments lack standardised outcome measures to objectively evaluate changes in cNF size and appearance. 3D imaging has been proposed as an objective standardised outcome measure however various systems exist with different features that affect useability in clinical settings. The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy, precision, feasibility, reliability and accessibility of three imaging systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared the Vectra-H1, LifeViz-Micro and Cherry-Imaging systems. A total of 58 cNFs from 13 participants with NF1 were selected for imaging and analysis. The primary endpoint was accuracy as measured by comparison of measurements between imaging systems. Secondary endpoints included reliability between two operators, precision as measured with the average coefficient of variation, feasibility as determined by time to capture and analyse an image and accessibility as determined by cost. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in accuracy between the three devices for length or surface area measurements (p > 0.05), and reliability and precision were similar. Volume measurements demonstrated the most variability compared to other measurements; LifeViz-Micro demonstrated the least measurement variability for surface area and image capture and analysis were fastest with LifeViz-Micro. LifeViz-Micro was better for imaging smaller number of cNFs (1-3), Vectra-H1 better for larger areas and Cherry for uneven surfaces. CONCLUSIONS: All systems demonstrated excellent reliability but possess distinct advantages and limitations.

Loss of the RAS-GAP NF1 leads to sustained RAF/MEK/ERK signaling in MPNST. However, single-agent MEK inhibitors (MEKi) have failed to elicit a sustained inhibition of the MAPK signaling pathway in MPNST. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used pharmacological, biochemical, and genetic perturbations of the receptor tyrosine kinase and MAPK signaling pathway regulators to investigate the mechanisms of MEKi resistance and evaluated combination therapeutic strategies in various preclinical MPNST models in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: Here, we report that MEKi treatment resistance in MPNST involves two adaptive pathways: direct transcriptional upregulation of the receptor tyrosine kinase PDGFRβ and MEKi-induced increase in RAF dimer formation and activation of downstream signaling. Although the pharmacologic combination of a MEKi with a PDGFRβ-specific inhibitor was more effective than treatment with the MEKi alone, the combination of the MEKi and RAF dimer inhibitors led to a robust inhibition of MAPK pathway signaling. This combination treatment was effective in vitro and in vivo, as demonstrated by the significant increase in drug synergism and its high effectiveness in decreasing MPNST viability. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the combination of MEKis and PDGFR and/or RAF dimer inhibitors can overcome MEKi resistance and may serve as a novel targeted therapeutic strategy for patients with NF1-deficient MPNST, which in turn could impact future clinical investigations for this patient population.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2024-11-15,Miguel A Miranda-Román; Cindy J Lee; Eve Fishinevich; Leili Ran; Amish J Patel; Juan Yan; Makhzuna N Khudoynazarova; Sarah Warda; Mohini R Pachai; Yu Chen; Ping Chi

Despite many clinical trials, outcomes for patients with MPNST have remained stagnant, and most succumb to their disease; thus, novel therapeutic approaches are needed. A better understanding of the MPNST immune ecosystem will aid in the development of strategies to activate the immune system against the tumor. In this study, we profile the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) in NF1-associated peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNST) to discover insights on the role played by tumor-infiltrating immune cells in malignant transformation. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using fresh and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue from patients diagnosed with NF1-PNST, we dissected the TIME through IHC, multiparameter flow cytometry, and comparative transcriptomic studies. RESULTS: Immunophenotyping confirmed increased immune cell infiltration during malignant progression, with a predominance of infiltrating myeloid cells, particularly CD163+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). The T cells within MPNST exhibited signs of tumor activation, characterized by high programmed cell death 1 expression. Additionally, MPNST specimens demonstrated elevated levels of immunosuppressive TAM, with heightened PD-L1 expression. The proportion of CD163+ myeloid cells within the TIME correlated with poorer progression-free survival. Notably, loss of H3K27 trimethylation correlated with low immune cell infiltration in MPNST. CONCLUSIONS: Malignant transformation of NF1-PNST is characterized by an immunosuppressive microenvironment comprising TAM with high expression of PD-L1, which is associated with inferior outcomes. These findings suggest the clinical potential of immune-modulating therapeutics that can unleash an antitumor immune response.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2024-12-02,Lindy Zhang; Alexandre Maalouf; Stavriani C Makri; Jineta Banerjee; Aditya Suru; Ada J Tam; Ana Calizo; Kai Pollard; Jiawan Wang; Ludmila Danilova; Maria Ioannou; Adam S Levin; Carol D Morris; Daniel S Rhee; Allan J Belzberg; Jaishri O Blakeley; Brian H Ladle; Drew M Pardoll; Calixto-Hope G Lucas; Fausto J Rodriguez; John M Gross; Robert A Anders; Christine A Pratilas; Nicolas J Llosa

Given the critical role of cysteine residues in protein stability and function, we aimed to identify key NF1 mutations affecting cysteine residues that significantly contribute to neurofibromatosis pathology. To identify the most critical mutations in the NF1 gene that contribute to the pathology of neurofibromatosis, we employed a sophisticated computational pipeline specifically designed to detect significant mutations affecting the NF1 gene. Our approach involved an exhaustive search of databases such as the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD), UniProt, and ClinVar for information on missense mutations associated with NF1. Our search yielded a total of 204 unique cysteine missense mutations. We then employed in silico prediction tools, including PredictSNP, iStable, and Align GVGD, to assess the impact of these mutations. Among the mutations, C379R, R1000C, and C1016Y stood out due to their deleterious effects on the biophysical properties of the neurofibromin protein, significantly destabilizing its structure. These mutations were subjected to further phenotyping analysis using SNPeffect 4.0, which predicted disturbances in the protein's chaperone binding sites and overall structural stability. Furthermore, to directly visualize the impact of these mutations on protein structure, we utilized AlphaFold3 to simulate both the wild-type and mutant NF1 structures, revealing the significant effects of the R1000C mutation on the protein's conformation. In conclusion, the identification of these mutations can play a pivotal role in advancing the field of precision medicine and aid in the development of effective drugs for associated diseases.",Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,2024-10-07,Jie Chen; Ziqiao Li; Yiheng Wu; Xiang Li; Zipei Chen; Pan Chen; Yuhan Ding; Chengpeng Wu; Lidan Hu

Regardless of the high incidence and mortality, the molecular mechanisms underneath MPNST growth and metastatic progression remain poorly understood. In this proof-of-concept study, we performed somatic whole-exome sequencing (WES) to profile the genomic alterations in four samples from a patient with NF1-associated MPNST, consisting of a benign plexiform neurofibroma, a primary MPNST, and metastases from lung and skin tissues. By comparing genomic patterns, we identified a high level of variability across samples with distinctive genetic changes which allow for the definition of profiles of the early phase with respect to the late metastatic stages. Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants were abundant in the primary tumor, whereas the metastatic samples exhibited a high level of copy-number variations (CNVs), highlighting a possible genomic instability in the late phases.

Here, we report the generation of a conditional zebrafish model of neurofibromatosis established by inducible genetic knockout of nf2a/b, the zebrafish homologs of human NF2. Analysis of nf2a and nf2b expression revealed ubiquitous expression of nf2b in the early embryo, with overlapping expression in the neural crest and its derivatives and in the cranial mesenchyme. In contrast, nf2a displayed lower expression levels. Induction of nf2a/b knockout at early stages increased the proliferation of larval Schwann cells and meningeal fibroblasts. Subsequently, in adult zebrafish, nf2a/b knockout triggered the development of a spectrum of tumors, including vestibular Schwannomas, spinal Schwannomas, meningiomas and retinal hamartomas, mirroring the tumor manifestations observed in patients with NF-2. Collectively, these findings highlight the generation of a novel zebrafish model that mimics the complexities of the human NF-2 disorder. Consequently, this model holds significant potential for facilitating therapeutic screening and elucidating key driver genes implicated in NF-2 onset.",Disease models & mechanisms,2024-12-01,Ayyappa Raja Desingu Rajan; Yuanyun Huang; Jan Stundl; Katelyn Chu; Anushka Irodi; Zihan Yang; Brian E Applegate; Marianne E Bronner

NF1 loss may also be a harbinger of exploitable vulnerabilities in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma (GBM). Accurate and consistent detection of NF1 loss, however, is fraught given the large gene size, challenges with complete coverage and variant calling upon sequencing, and mechanisms of mRNA and protein regulation that result in early degradation in the absence of genomic alterations. Here, we seek to perform a composite analysis for NF1 loss accounting for genomic alterations and protein expression via immunohistochemistry. We also characterize the landscape of NF1 alterations in GBM. METHODS: We assembled a single-institution, retrospective cohort of 542 IDH-wildtype GBM with somatic next generation sequencing to investigate the frequency and nature of detected NF1 alterations. We selected 69 GBMs from which to build a tissue microarray (TMA) of 44 NF1-wildtype and 25 NF1-mutant cases. We performed NF1 immunohistochemistry using two different NF1 antibodies (NFC, Sigma-Aldrich; and iNF-07E, iNFixion Bioscience) and correlated results with clinical, genomic, and other immunohistochemical features. RESULTS: In our retrospective cohort, we identified 88 IDH-wildtype GBM with NF1 alterations (16%). NF1 alterations were mutually exclusive with EGFR and MDM2 alterations (p-adj < 0.001, 0.05, respectively), but co-occurred with PIK3R1 alterations (Log CONCLUSION: NF1 immunostaining may serve as a sensitive surrogate marker of NF1 genomic inactivation and a valuable extension to next-generation sequencing for defining NF1 status.

Based on clinical phenotypes, exome sequencing for small-nucleotide variations or array-based methods for copy-number variations (CNVs) are commonly offered to identify the underlying causative genetic variants. In this study, we investigated whether data from a standard ES test could be used to additionally identify pathogenic CNVs and increase diagnostic yield. METHODS: Prospectively, 134 patients presenting with a skin condition suspected of being genetic in origin were offered the next-generation variant exon screening (ngVES) test. Sequencing data were analyzed for both single-nucleotide variants and CNVs using established algorithms. RESULTS: The positive detection rate for skin diseases using ngVES was 66% (88/134) with the most common diagnoses being neurofibromatosis type1 ( CONCLUSION: The advances in the ngVES bioinformatics pipeline are proofs of concept, which improved identification of genetic variants associated with skin disease.

We used Strep tagged mNf1 cDNAs (both wild type (WT) and variant) to affinity purity NF1 Protein-Protein interactors (PPIs) from the Schwann cells. We were able to identify 98 PPIs and show that some of these PPIs bind differentially to variant proteins. Next, we evaluated global proteomes. We identified over 1900 proteins in immortalized human Schwann cells both with and without NF1 expression. We identified 148 proteins with differential expression levels based on genotype. Following Ingenuity Pathway analysis (IPA) we found multiple pathways were altered including decreases in ""oxidative phosphorylation,"" increases in ""mitochondrial dysfunction"", and ""glycolysis"", as well as changes in ""Myelination Signaling Pathway."" When we evaluated the proteome of NF1 null cells stably transfected with tagged mNf1 cDNAs we again identified an overall trend of metabolic differences pertaining to ""oxidative phosphorylation"", ""mitochondria dysfunction"", and ""glycolysis"" in the variant cDNA expressing cells. We then validated differential expression of the following proteins: LAMC1, CYB5R3, and SOD2 that are observed in the altered pathways. Finally, consistent with our proteomics findings, we show that NF1 is required to maintain mitochondrial respiratory function in Schwann cells by stabilizing NADH-linked oxidative phosphorylation and electron transfer. Taken together, these data indicate that NF1 plays a significant role in mitochondrial metabolism that results in proteomic changes in Schwann cells and may serve as a future drug target.",Scientific reports,2025-01-31,Christian X Fay; Elizabeth R M Zunica; Elias Awad; William Bradley; Cameron Church; Jian Liu; Hui Liu; David K Crossman; James A Mobley; John P Kirwan; Christopher L Axelrod; Erik Westin; Robert A Kesterson; Deeann Wallis

10.1186/s40478-025-01965-6,PMID:40025578,Development of CAR-T cell therapy for NF1/SWN-related nerve sheath tumor treatment.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and schwannomatosis (SWN) are rare genetic disorders with distinct genetic etiologies. Both syndromes are predominantly characterized by the development of multiple benign nerve sheath tumors, which typically arise from cranial/peripheral nerves. The management of NF1/SWN-associated benign nerve sheath tumors pose a substantial clinical challenge. In recent years, immunotherapy has demonstrated significant efficacy in treating various tumors, but its application to NF1/SWN has not been explored. In this study, we first evaluated the feasibility of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy for the treatment of benign NF1/SWN-related nerve sheath tumor by analyzing the expression of multiple antigens in 85 tumor samples. Our findings revealed that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/HER1) was highly expressed in most samples, indicating its potential as an ideal target for CAR-T cell therapy. Additionally, TGFβ1 and PDL1, key inhibitory regulators of T cell function within solid tumor microenvironment (TME), were universally overexpressed in these samples, highlighting the immunosuppressive nature of NF1/SWN tumors. To target HER1, we constructed CARs using three distinct scFvs (806, E2 and NEC). All three types of CAR-T cells demonstrated significant tumor-eliminating capability against NF1/SWN tumor cell lines, with 806 CAR-T cells showing the highest efficacy. Considering the immunosuppressive TME, we knocked out TGFBR2 and/or PDCD1 in 806 CAR-T cells using CRISPR/Cas9. Their anti-tumor efficacy was further evaluated using a 3D tumor spheroid model, and the gene-edited 806 CAR-T cells exhibited superior anti-tumor efficacy. In conclusion, we identified HER1 as a target for CAR-T cell therapy in NF1/SWN-related nerve sheath tumors, and developed anti-HER1 CAR-T cells that effectively eliminated NF1/SWN tumor cells, providing a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with these conditions.",Acta neuropathologica communications,2025-03-01,Na Tang; Lei Cheng; Jiawei Hao; Beilei Xu; Xi Pan; Xiaofei Wei; Hao Wu; Haoyi Wang

Alterations involving CDKN2A and components of PRC2 have been implicated as early drivers of peripheral nerve sheath tumor (PNST) evolution, but these events do not occur in all MPNST. Accordingly, emerging data have begun to highlight the importance of molecular-based stratification to improve outcomes in patients with NF1-PNST. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this study, we perform an integrated analysis of multiple, independent datasets obtained from human patients with NF1 to gain critical insights into PNST evolution and MPNST heterogeneity. RESULTS: We show that delta-like noncanonical Notch ligand 1 (DLK1) is significantly increased in MPNST and provide evidence that DLK1 overexpression may precede histologic changes consistent with malignancy. In complementary analyses, we find that serum levels of DLK1 are significantly higher in both mice and humans harboring MPNST compared with those without malignancy. Importantly, although DLK1 expression is increased in MPNST overall, through the integration of multiple, independent datasets, we demonstrate that divergent levels of DLK1 expression distinguish MPNST subsets characterized by unique molecular programs and potential therapeutic vulnerabilities. Specifically, we show that overexpression of DLK1 is associated with the reactivation of embryonic signatures, an immunosuppressive microenvironment, and a worse overall survival in patients with NF1-MPNST. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our findings provide critical insights into MPNST tumorigenesis and support prospective studies evaluating the utility of DLK1 tissue and serum levels in augmenting diagnosis, risk assessment, and therapeutic stratification in the setting of NF1-PNST.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2025-05-15,Dana K Mitchell; Kylee Brewster; Stavriani C Makri; Jaffar Khan; Eric A Albright; Andrew Horvai; Henry Mang; Qingbo Lu; Shelley A H Dixon; Emily White; Mohammad Reza Saadatzadeh; Khadijeh Bijangi-Vishehsaraei; Silpa Gampala; Brooke E Hickey; Hannah Leffew; Xiaohong Li; Li Jiang; Marisa D Ciesielski; Waylan K Bessler; Christopher D Collier; Aaron Cohen-Gadol; Melissa L Fishel; Christine A Pratilas; Karen E Pollok; Steven P Angus; Steven Rhodes; Wade Clapp
10.1093/g3journal/jkaf067,PMID:40191916,"The draft genome of the Wisconsin Miniature SwineTM, a valuable biomedical research tool.","Porcine biomedical models have emerged as valuable tools in biomedical research due to their physiological, anatomical, metabolic, immunological, and genetic similarities to humans. As a result, they offer greater relevance for translational studies than rodent models. Moreover, compared to nonhuman primates, porcine models are more cost-effective, easier to manipulate genetically, and raise fewer ethical concerns. However, the conventional breeds of swine most commonly used in research have rapid growth rates, which lead to logistical challenges such as increased space requirements, making them impractical as biomedical models. The Wisconsin Miniature SwineTM (WMSTM) was developed to address these shortcomings. The WMSTM porcine model grows slower, reaching and maintaining human sizes at adulthood. The model was also specifically designed to possess more human-like physiology that allows for easy modeling of comorbidities like obesity and metabolic syndrome that affect a large portion of the human population affected by chronic diseases. Thus, WMS™ is an ideal porcine gene editing platform for modeling complex multifactorial diseases. Here, we present the first draft genome assembly representative of the WMSTM line. The primary assembly was generated with ∼20× coverage of long reads from Oxford Nanopore Technologies and independently error-corrected using 23× Pacific Biosciences reads. Arima Genomics Hi-C data were used to improve contiguity. Largely congruent with the existing Sus scrofa genome, we also show the utility of WMSTM as a model through comparisons between 2 WMSTM genes and human homologs. Finally, we show the utility of genotyping by sequencing across WMSTM herds.

To date, no patient-reported outcome measures have been validated specifically to assess pNF-related pain intensity or pain interference in this population. Such measures are sorely needed since pain is being considered as an outcome in clinical trials targeting reduction of pNF. The study aims were to: (1) obtain qualitative information from individuals with NF1 and pNFs about their pain and its measurement and (2) modify existing scales to assess pNF-related pain intensity and pain interference for NF1 clinical trials. METHODS: For this multi-site, qualitative study, 56 individuals (26 children, 6-16 years; 30 adults, 18-68 years) with NF1 and pNF participated in a focus group and/or individual interview about pain intensity and pain interference (concept elicitation) and also provided feedback about existing pain measures (Numeric Rating Scale-11 and Pain Interference Index) assessing these domains (cognitive debriefing). Four additional waves of cognitive debriefing interviews further refined the measures. Qualitative concept elicitation data from transcripts were coded, analyzed using NVivo software, and thematic analysis was conducted using both deductive and inductive techniques. Additional themes and systematic problems and suggestions regarding the measures were gleaned from reviewing the field notes and interview transcriptions generated by the cognitive debriefing sessions. RESULTS: Concept elicitation themes included descriptions of two types of pNF-related pain (chronic and episodic), variability of pain over time, varying ability to recall pain, lack of knowledge of pNFs, and the ways pain interferes with daily activities. Cognitive debriefing themes included information on how to rate pNF-related pain intensity apart from other pain; problems and suggestions regarding the measures included difficulty comprehending some items and preferences for alternative wording and formatting. Based on these qualitative results, the measures' instructions, items, and formatting were modified to create the PAin INtensity Scale for plexiform neurofibromas (PAINS-pNF) and the Pain Interference Index for plexiform neurofibromas (PII-pNF) for administration on a mobile app or web-based platform. CONCLUSIONS: The PAINS-pNF and PII-pNF are promising self-report measures developed using patient engagement to evaluate tumor pain intensity and pain interference in NF1 clinical trials.

10.7759/cureus.82033,PMID:40352015,Development of a Machine Learning Algorithm for the Prediction of WHO Grade 1 Meningioma Recurrence.,"Objective Meningiomas commonly recur following gross total resection (GTR), and the risk of recurrence is difficult to predict using current classification schemes such as the World Health Organization (WHO) tumor grade. This study aimed to create a predictive model of recurrence risk following GTR of WHO grade 1 meningiomas based on histopathological and epidemiological factors.  Methods A retrospective chart review was completed for all patients at our institution who underwent their first surgery for a WHO grade 1 meningioma between 2017 and 2022. Those with genetic predispositions, such as neurofibromatosis type 2, were excluded. Baseline characteristics, including histopathology findings, were obtained, and we used a Risk-calibrated Superspase Linear Integer Model (Risk-SLIM) with a five-fold cross-validation (CV) to create a predictive model of recurrence over an average follow-up of three years.  Results Univariate analysis of our selected variables revealed a significant predictive association between WHO grade 1 meningioma recurrence and subtotal resection but not with any other variable. However, the meningioma recurrence score (MRS) generated by our machine learning algorithm revealed multiple predictive factors of recurrence, including age, female gender, and various histopathologic features, including the Ki-67/MIB-1 index. Conclusions Machine learning algorithms like the one we present here may help identify patients at high risk of recurrence of their WHO grade 1 meningioma, and they are more likely to benefit from closer postoperative surveillance or adjuvant treatment, even when GTR is achieved.",Cureus,2025-04,Simon G Ammanuel; Matthew Stenerson; Thomas Staniszewski; Manasa Kalluri; Benjamin Lee; Elsa Nico; Azam S Ahmed

While cNFs are always benign, they markedly decrease quality of life in individuals with NF1. Understanding the differences between cNFs and the skin is essential for developing treatments for cNFs. METHODS: We collected 15 cNFs from four NF1 individuals and used mass spectrometry to compare the tumor tissue with the skin overlying each tumor. Data were analyzed based on Gene Ontology (GO) terms. RESULTS: The expression patterns of the Schwann cell marker S100B and several keratins confirmed successful dissection of cNF tissue from the overlying skin. Hierarchical clustering showed extensive overlap between the tumor and skin samples in three out of four individuals, suggesting high overall similarity between the two tissue types. Based on the analysis of the GO terms, cNFs were associated with decreased expression of proteins related to cell proliferation, extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis and cellular metabolism. CONCLUSION: The cNFs are relatively quiescent, consistent with their benign nature and limited growth potential. The development of pharmacological therapy for cNFs requires overcoming the high similarity between cNFs and the overlying skin. The present dataset can serve as a resource for future research on cNFs.",British journal of cancer,2025-08,Roope A Kallionpää; Eija Martikkala; Pekka Haapaniemi; Sanna-Maria Karppinen; Pilvi Riihilä; Anne Rokka; Ilmo Leivo; Taina Pihlajaniemi; Sirkku Peltonen; Juha Peltonen
10.1186/s41747-025-00594-x,PMID:40437318,Quantitative MRI of dorsal root ganglion alterations in neurofibromatosis type 1 patients with or without pain.,"BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder characterised by skin and nervous system anomalies, primarily involving glial cells and nerve tumours. Pain, particularly chronic pain, is a significant but often overlooked symptom in NF1 patients, affecting their health-related quality of life. The dorsal root ganglion (DRG) is essential for pain signal transmission, yet in vivo studies of DRG in NF1 patients are lacking. METHODS: This prospective study included 20 NF1 patients (8 with neuropathic pain) and 28 healthy controls. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of lumbosacral DRG (L5 + S1) were performed using a 3-T scanner. Quantitative MRI techniques were applied to assess DRG volume, T2 relaxation time, and proton density (PD). Statistical analyses compared NF1 patients and controls, and NF1 patients with and without pain. RESULTS: NF1 patients had a significantly larger DRG volume and higher quantitative T2 and PD values compared to controls. Furthermore, DRG PD was significantly higher in NF1 patients with neuropathic pain than in those without pain. Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis identified DRG PD as the best discriminator of pain in NF1 patients, with an area under the curve of 0.84, indicating relevant and useful discriminatory power. CONCLUSION: NF1 patients showed objective macrostructural and microstructural DRG injury changes using dedicated DRG MRI, discriminating neuropathic pain status from non-pain status at the disease-symptom group level. These findings highlight the potential of DRG MRI to quantify DRG pathology in vivo and to determine the risk of functional pain status by imaging. RELEVANCE STATEMENT: The identification of structural and microstructural changes of the DRG by quantitative MRI provides a novel in vivo biomarker for understanding neuropathic pain mechanisms, pain risk assessment and treatment monitoring in NF1. KEY POINTS: Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in NF1 are enlarged by 176.3% in MRI. In quantitative MRI of DRG NF1, T2 relaxation time is increased by 22.9% and PD by 8.4%. DRG PD can distinguish a painful from a non-painful NF1 phenotype.",European radiology experimental,2025-05-28,Magnus Schindehütte; Eva Meller; Thomas Kampf; Florian Hessenauer; Nurcan Üçeyler; György Homola; Heike L Rittner; Cordula Matthies; Mirko Pham; Simon Weiner

The B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) family of proteins regulate apoptosis. Their ability to do so can be measured using several methods that in turn anticipate the fate of the cancer cell in response to apoptosis-inducing treatment. These assays ultimately identify the readiness of the cancer cell to undergo apoptosis, which is referred to as the mitochondrial priming state.

However, clinical trials testing new drugs are ongoing, and quantitative techniques based on cNF biology are needed to measure changes in cNF after treatment. cNF tumor bulk is composed of extracellular matrix and inflammatory cells that dictate their stiffness. No studies have reported measuring the stiffness change in neurofibromas, which would indicate shrinking of the tumor bulk. The goal of this study was to evaluate 2 different instruments-the Rex Gauge durometer (denoted as REX) and the Delfin SkinFibroMeter (denoted as DELFIN)-in reproducibly measuring cNF stiffness. Ninety-seven neurofibromas from patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 on different skin areas were measured at each of 2 visits about 2 weeks apart. The DELFIN had moderate within-tumor agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.607, 95% confidence interval = 0.512-0.691) and moderate within-visit agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.732, 95% confidence interval = 0.665-0.786), and the REX had moderate within-tumor agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.740, 95% confidence interval = 0.631-0.816) and excellent within-visit agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.937, 95% confidence interval = 0.913-0.953), while accounting for repeated visits and tumor measurements clustered within each patient. We found that both the DELFIN and REX are easy to use and reliable, providing consistent quantification of cNF stiffness.",JID innovations : skin science from molecules to population health,2025-07,Bahir Chamseddin; Renee M McKay; Ruyun Jin; Hong Zhu; Lu Q Le
10.1172/JCI188932,PMID:40590220,A haploinsufficiency restoration strategy corrects neurobehavioral deficits in Nf1+/- mice.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene resulting in the loss of function of neurofibromin, a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Ras. While the malignant manifestations of NF1 are associated with loss of heterozygosity of the residual WT allele, the nonmalignant neurodevelopmental sequelae, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and/or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are prevalent morbidities that occur in the setting of neurofibromin haploinsufficiency. We reasoned that augmenting endogenous levels of WT neurofibromin could serve as a potential therapeutic strategy to correct the neurodevelopmental manifestations of NF1. Here, we used a combination of genetic screening and genetically engineered murine models to identify a role for the F-box protein FBXW11 as a regulator of neurofibromin degradation. Disruption of Fbxw11, through germline mutation or targeted genetic manipulation in the nucleus accumbens, increased neurofibromin levels, suppressed Ras-dependent ERK phosphorylation, and corrected social learning deficits and impulsive behaviors in male Nf1+/- mice. Our results demonstrate that preventing the degradation of neurofibromin is a feasible and effective approach to ameliorate the neurodevelopmental phenotypes in a haploinsufficient disease model.",The Journal of clinical investigation,2025-07-01,Su Jung Park; Jodi L Lukkes; Ka-Kui Chan; Hayley P Drozd; Callie B Burgin; Shaomin Qian; Morgan McKenzie Sullivan; Cesar Gabriel Guevara; Nolen Cunningham; Stephanie Arenas; Makenna A Collins; Jacob Zucker; JinHee Won; Abbi Smith; Li Jiang; Dana K Mitchell; Steven D Rhodes; Steven P Angus; D Wade Clapp

Despite its high prevalence and clinical impact, the molecular mechanisms underlying cNF formation remain poorly understood. Here, we used an Nf1 knockout (Nf1-KO) mouse model combined with immunohistochemistry and single cell transcriptomics in order to investigate the mechanisms driving cNF development. Our results showed that mutant SCs accumulate in the skin of young mice weeks prior to the onset of cNF. However, these cells remain quiescent until triggered by skin trauma, which induces their proliferation and the rapid formation of cNFs. Using a trauma-induced Nf1-KO model with scRNAseq, we designed a transcriptomic atlas of growing and mature cNFs, as well as adjacent apparently healthy skin.

10.2196/71728,PMID:40737523,Clinician Perspectives of a Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Based 3D Volumetric Analysis Tool for Neurofibromatosis Type 2-Related Schwannomatosis: Qualitative Pilot Study.,"BACKGROUND: Accurate monitoring of tumor progression is crucial for optimizing outcomes in neurofibromatosis type 2-related schwannomatosis. Standard 2D linear analysis on magnetic resonance imaging is less accurate than 3D volumetric analysis, but since 3D volumetric analysis is time-consuming, it is not widely used. To shorten the time required for 3D volumetric analysis, our lab has been developing an automated artificial intelligence-driven 3D volumetric tool. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to survey and interview clinicians treating neurofibromatosis type 2-related schwannomatosis to understand their views on current 2D analysis and to gather insights for the design of an artificial intelligence-driven 3D volumetric analysis tool. METHODS: Interviews examined for the following themes: (1) shortcomings of the currently used linear analysis, (2) utility of 3D visualizations, (3) features of an interactive 3D modeling software, and (4) lack of a gold standard to assess the accuracy of 3D volumetric analysis. A Likert scale questionnaire was used to survey clinicians' levels of agreement with 25 statements related to 2D and 3D tumor analyses. RESULTS: A total of 14 clinicians completed a survey, and 12 clinicians were interviewed. Specialties ranged across neurosurgery, neuroradiology, neurology, oncology, and pediatrics. Overall, clinicians expressed concerns with current linear techniques, with clinicians agreeing that linear measurements can be variable with the possibility of two different clinicians calculating 2 different tumor sizes (mean 4.64, SD 0.49) and that volumetric measurements would be more helpful for determining clearer thresholds of tumor growth (mean 4.50, SD 0.52). For statements discussing the capabilities of a 3D volumetric analysis and visualization software, clinicians expressed strong interest in being able to visualize tumors with respect to critical brain structures (mean 4.36, SD 0.74) and in forecasting tumor growth (mean 4.77, SD 0.44). CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians were overall in favor of the adoption of 3D volumetric analysis techniques for measuring vestibular schwannoma tumors but expressed concerns regarding the novelty and inexperience surrounding these techniques. However, clinicians felt that the ability to visualize tumors with reference to critical structures, to overlay structures, to interact with 3D models, and to visualize areas of slow versus rapid growth in 3D would be valuable contributions to clinical practice. Overall, clinicians provided valuable insights for designing a 3D volumetric analysis tool for vestibular schwannoma tumor growth. These findings may also apply to other central nervous system tumors, offering broader utility in tumor growth assessments.",JMIR human factors,2025-07-30,Shelby T Desroches; Alice Huang; Rithvik Ghankot; Steven M Tommasini; Daniel H Wiznia; Frank D Buono

There are two recently FDA-approved drugs, selumetinib and mirdametinib, for pNF1 patients who have symptomatic and inoperable plexiform neurofibromas; however, these treatments achieve only approximately 30% tumor shrinkage. Fibroblasts, the most abundant cell types within the pNF1 tumor microenvironment, are implicated in pNF1 growth and invasion; however, how fibroblasts affect a drug response of pNF1 remains poorly understood. In the present study, we focused on contributions of fibroblasts to the drug resistance in pNF1 via their secretome.

10.1186/s40246-025-00803-z,PMID:40887659,RENOVO-NF1 accurately predicts NF1 missense variant pathogenicity.,"Identification of a pathogenic variant in NF1 is diagnostic for neurofibromatosis, but is often impossible at the moment of variant detection due to many factors including allelic heterogeneity, sequence homology, and the lack of functional assays. Computational tools may aid in interpretation but are not established for NF1. Here, we optimized our random forest-based predictor RENOVO for NF1 variant interpretation. RENOVO was developed using an approach of ""database archaeology"": by comparing versions of ClinVar over the years, we defined ""stable"" variants that maintained the same pathogenic/likely pathogenic/benign/likely benign (P/LP/B/LB) classification over time (n = 3579, the training set), and ""unstable"" variants that were initially classified as Variants of Unknown Significance (VUS) but were subsequently reclassified as P/LP/B/LB (n = 57, the test set). This approach allows to retrospectively measure accuracy on prediction with insufficient information, reproducing the scenario of maximal clinical utility. We further validated performance on: (i) validation set 1: 100 NF1 variants classified as VUS at the time of RENOVO development and subsequently reclassified as P/LP/B/LB in ClinVar; (ii) validation set 2: 15 de novo variants discovered in a prospective clinical cohort and subsequently reclassified per ACMG criteria. RENOVO obtained consistently high accuracy on all datasets: 98.6% on the training test, 96.5% in the test set, 82% in validation set 1 (but 96.2% for missense variants) and 93.7% on validation set 2. In conclusion, RENOVO-NF1 accurately interprets NF1 variants for which information at the time of detection is insufficient for ACMG classification and may overcome diagnostic challenges in neurofibromatosis.",Human genomics,2025-08-31,Emanuele Bonetti; Serena Pellegatta; Nayma Rosati; Marica Eoli; Luca Mazzarella

NF1 gene replacement therapy, though promising, is hindered by NF1 gene's large size and delivery challenges. We introduced a membrane-targeted, truncated neurofibromin comprising the GAP-related domain (GRD) fused to the KRAS4B C-terminal domain, which effectively inhibits the RAS signaling pathway and restores Schwann cell differentiation in an NF1 iPSC-derived model. For systemic application, we engineered an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector using in vivo capsid evolution through sequential DNA shuffling and peptide library screening in a NF1 xenograft mouse model. This tailored vector, AAV-NF, exhibits greatly reduced liver uptake, enhanced tumor targeting across various NF1-related MPNST, neurofibromas and glioma models, and therapeutic efficacy in xenografts of MPNST.

Loss of NF1 in MPNST leads to hyperactivation of RAS, however little is known about relevant downstream oncogenic signaling through RAF paralogs and effective targeted therapies in MPNST are still lacking. METHODS: Conditional gene expression, CRISPR-CAS9, and shRNA-mediated knockdown were used to perform gain/loss-of-function experiments to explore the effect of reconstituting the GTPase-activating protein-related domain of NF1 or knockdown of A/B/CRAF kinases on ERK signaling output and MPNST cell growth. Colony formation, cell proliferation and live cells imaging assays were performed to assess cell growth in response to genetic manipulations or drug treatments. Pathway enrichment analysis on RNA sequencing following drug perturbation, efficacy studies in cell-line-derived and patient-derived xenograft models, and immunoblotting/immunohistochemistry were conducted to assess tumor growth and ERK pathway activity in cells or in pharmacodynamic analyses of tumor xenografts. RESULTS: NF1 loss activates RAS/ERK signaling through B/CRAF, and cell growth and ERK signaling of NF1-MPNST are dependent on B/CRAF, but not ARAF. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of B/CRAF using a paralog-selective RAF inhibitor (RAFi) significantly potentiates MEK inhibitor (MEKi) treatment through more effective suppression of ERK signaling and proliferation. This is shown in multiple traditional and patient-derived cell line and xenograft models, including those with acquired resistance to MEKi. CONCLUSIONS: These findings contribute preclinical evidence that the combination of paralog-selective B/CRAFi and MEKi is effective in NF1-MPNST and can overcome resistance to single agent MEKi.

Individuals with NF1 develop benign tumors of the peripheral nervous system (neurofibromas), originating from the Schwann cell (SC) lineage after somatic loss of the wild-type NF1 allele, some of which progress further to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). There is only one FDA-approved targeted therapy for symptomatic plexiform neurofibromas and none approved for MPNSTs. The genetic basis of NF1 syndrome makes associated tumors ideal for using synthetic drug sensitivity approaches to uncover therapeutic vulnerabilities. We developed a drug discovery pipeline to identify therapeutics for NF1-related tumors using isogeneic pairs of NF1-proficient and NF1-deficient immortalized human SCs. We utilized these in a large-scale high-throughput screen for drugs that preferentially kill NF1-deficient cells, through which we identified 23 compounds capable of killing NF1-deficient SCs with selectivity. Multiple hits from this screen clustered into classes defined by the method of action. Four clinically interesting drugs from these classes were tested in vivo using both a genetically engineered mouse model of high-grade PNSTs and human MPNST xenografts. All drugs tested showed single-agent efficacy in these models as well as significant synergy when used in combination with the MEK inhibitor selumetinib.

Here, we introduce PERADIGM ( Phenotype Embedding similarity-based RAre DIsease Gene Mapping), a novel framework that leverages natural language processing techniques to integrate comprehensive phenotype information from electronic health records for rare disease gene discovery. PERADIGM employs an embedding model to capture relationships between ICD-10 codes, providing a nuanced representation of individual phenotypes. By utilizing patient similarity scores, it enhances the identification of candidate genes associated with disease-specific phenotypes, surpassing conventional methods that rely on binary disease status. We applied PERADIGM to the UK Biobank dataset for three rare diseases: autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), Marfan syndrome, and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). PERADIGM identified additional candidate genes associated with ADPKD-related and Marfan syndrome-related phenotypes, some of which are supported by existing literature, and demonstrated enhanced signal detection for NF1-specific phenotypes beyond traditional methods.

NF1-specific growth charts that account for expected macrocephaly may increase sensitivity for detecting atypical growth. We aimed to produce NF1-specific growth charts of head circumference for the age range of 0-3 years and to assess their potential clinical impact. METHODS: Using electronic health records from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, we collected head circumference measurements from children with NF1 and a community control cohort seen at scheduled well-child visits. We compared head circumference normalized using Centers for Disease Control (CDC) growth charts between these groups over time. We constructed NF1-specific growth charts using 2 independent methods. Finally, we used mixed-effects models to relate the resulting centile scores to developmental delay assessed with the Survey of Well-being of Young Children. RESULTS: Our data set contained 2,180 observations from 305 individuals (167 male) with NF1 and 104,750 observations from 16,742 individuals (8,809 male) in the community control cohort, all aged 0-3 years. Head circumference was significantly elevated in the NF1 cohort across the age range ( DISCUSSION: We present the first NF1-specific growth charts for head circumference covering the age range of 0-3 years. Macrocephaly in NF1 becomes more exaggerated over time as rate of growth is sustained compared with controls.

The most characteristic feature of the condition NF1 is the neurofibroma, a benign, multi-cellular tumor which initiates when a cell of the Schwann cell lineage gains a somatic pathogenic variant of the other NF1 allele. Neurofibromas developing at nerve termini in the skin are termed ""cutaneous"" neurofibromas (cNFs), while those developing within larger nerves are termed ""plexiform."" Most patients develop cNFs beginning in late childhood or early adulthood, continuing throughout life at variable rates. Some patients may develop only a few cNFs, while others suffer from thousands. There are no reliably effective physical or pharmaceutical therapies besides surgical removal. Although these are not life-threatening, they are disfiguring and can interfere with normal life functions. To provide a resource for research, we developed short-term cNF Schwann cell cultures from NF1 patients, from which we subsequently established the first semi-immortalized cNF cell lines through transduction with wild-type human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and murine cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (mCdk4) genes. Here we present molecular, cellular, and functional characterization of these cell lines, which will be of utility for investigating and developing NF1 cNF therapies.",PloS one,2026,Hua Li; Alexander Pemov; Robert Allaway; David F Muir; Lung-Ji Chang; Jineta Banerjee; Alexandra J Scott; Jaime M W Nagy; Jian Liu; Meritxell Carrió; Helena Mazuelas; Anthony Yachnis; Sang Y Lee; Xiaochun Zhang; Yang Lyu; Douglas R Stewart; Angela Hirbe; Jaishri O Blakeley; Eduard Serra; Deeann Wallis; Margaret R Wallace

Distinguishing MPNSTs from benign neurofibromas remains challenging. We investigated fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP) as a malignancy biomarker and theranostic target in peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Therefore, we integrated publicly available bulk transcriptomics, spatial transcriptomics, and single-cell RNA sequencing with immunohistochemistry (IHC) on independent archival samples. We further directly assessed clinical translatability using FAP-targeted PET/CT in an NF-1 patient undergoing work-up for suspected malignant transformation. Across independent bulk datasets, FAP was consistently up-regulated in MPNSTs compared with neurofibromas. In the TCGA sarcoma dataset, FAP varied by histotype but was clearly expressed in MPNSTs. Spatial transcriptomics revealed enrichment of FAP-high regions in MPNSTs and co-localization with tumor cell markers. Single-cell analysis showed FAP expression in MPNST tumor cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts, with the highest levels in neural crest-like tumor subpopulations previously linked to adverse prognosis; pseudotime analysis indicated decreasing FAP expression along trajectories toward Schwann cell precursor-like states linking FAP expression to a more primitive, dedifferentiated tumor cell state. IHC confirmed strong, predominantly tumor cell-intrinsic FAP expression in MPNSTs, with minimal staining in neurofibromas and normal tissues. Plexiform neurofibromas exhibited intermediate FAP expression. In clinical imaging, FAP-PET demonstrated higher tracer uptake in histologically proven MPNSTs than in benign lesions within the same patient, including a neurofibroma that was FDG-avid but FAP-negative, supporting added diagnostic specificity over FDG-PET/CT. In summary, FAP is robustly overexpressed in MPNSTs at transcript and protein levels, potentially concentrates in high-risk tumor cell states, and is detectable by targeted PET imaging. These findings identify FAP as a clinically relevant biomarker for malignancy in NF-1-associated tumors and support implementation of FAP-directed diagnostics and therapeutics in peripheral nerve sheath tumor work-up.",Acta neuropathologica,2026-01-27,Nic G Reitsam; Alexander Gäble; Lisa Siebenhüter; Tina Schaller; Friederike Liesche-Starnecker; Eva Sipos; Sebastian Dintner; Christoph Walz; John Babic; Martin Trepel; Malte Kircher; Victoria E Fincke; Pascal D Johann; Bruno Märkl; Constantin Lapa; Johanna S Enke

10.7759/cureus.100193,PMID:41602242,Perspectives of Patients and Providers on Chronic Pain Assessment in Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1): A Qualitative Study.,"Background and objective Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) typically presents with physical symptoms, neurocognitive impairments, and chronic pain (CP). Existing pain measures, originally developed for cancer pain or other diseases, do not address the specific healthcare needs of NF1 patients. Hence, this study aimed to examine how individuals with NF1-associated CP and their providers characterize the physical and emotional experiences of pain, as well as their perceived needs in assessing NF1-associated CP. Methods We performed a qualitative study, employing thematic analysis of data collected from six focus groups with 37 patients with NF1 and 16 one-on-one interviews with clinicians involved in NF1 care Results We identified three themes: Describing the Pain Experience, Treating and Dealing With NF1-Associated CP, and Attitudes About Current Pain Measures. Participants perceived certain shortcomings in current pain measures, emphasizing that pain tolerance, adaptation of goals and activities, and the presence of multiple concurrent pain sites are intrinsic to NF1. Patients expressed frustration with the need to quantify a highly subjective and individualized experience using existing measures. Similarly, providers reported frustration that current tools inadequately capture the impact of chronic pain on patients' daily lives, with some preferring more open, conversational approaches to pain assessment. Conclusions The data indicated that pain duration, frequency, regularity, and quality need to be clearly defined and operationalized for patients and providers to similarly understand these domains. Incorporating open-ended items that allow patients to describe their pain in their own words or through images may enhance patients' sense of being understood by their providers. There is a clear need for a standardized pain assessment tool that specifically captures the pain experiences of individuals with NF1.",Cureus,2025-12,Lauretta Grau; William A Zempsky; Staci Martin; Kaitlyn Larkin; Frank D Buono

Schwann cells and fibroblasts from transgenic mouse embryos in which the type 1 neurofibromatosis gene was disrupted by homologous recombination (Brannan et al. (1994) Genes Development, 8,1019-1029). Normal fascicle formation by perineurial cells failed to occur in the absence of neurofibromin. Fascicles were reduced in number and showed abnormal morphology when normal neurons and Schwann cells were cultured up to 37 days with fibroblasts lacking neurofibromin. Proliferation was increased in a majority of fibroblast cell strains analyzed from embryos lacking neurofibromin. These observations suggest that mutations in the neurofibromatosis type I gene affect fibroblast behavior that might contribute to neurofibroma formation in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1.","Development (Cambridge, England)",1995-11,T Rosenbaum; Y L Boissy; K Kombrinck; C I Brannan; N A Jenkins; N G Copeland; N Ratner
