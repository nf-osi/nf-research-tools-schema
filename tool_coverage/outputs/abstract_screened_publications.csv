Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized  by increased incidence of benign and malignant tumors of neural crest origin.  Mutations that activate the protooncogene ras, such as loss of Nf1, cooperate  with inactivating mutations at the p53 tumor suppressor gene during malignant  transformation. One hundred percent of mice harboring null Nf1 and p53 alleles  in cis synergize to develop soft tissue sarcomas between 3 and 7 months of age.  These sarcomas exhibit loss of heterozygosity at both gene loci and express  phenotypic traits characteristic of neural crest derivatives and human NF1  malignancies.

Author information: (1)Division of Pathology, Central Clinical Laboratory, School of Medicine, Iwate  Medical University, Morioka, Japan.  BACKGROUND: Contamination of nontumor tissue makes genetic analysis difficult.  For this reason, it is important to obtain pure tumor tissue to ensure accurate  genetic analysis. OBJECTIVE: To accurately assess the incidence of mutation of tumor suppressor  genes (p53: exon 5-8; APC: mutated cluster region; NF-2 gene: all exons) in 45  colorectal carcinomas. METHODS: We developed an application of the polymerase chain  reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequence by coupling  them with crypt isolation. RESULTS: Mutations of p53 and APC genes were found in 24 and 22 of 45 colorectal  carcinomas, respectively. No mutation of the NF-2 gene was observed in this  cancer. Single-strand conformation polymorphism using a crypt isolation  technique showed a clear migrating band and no false-positive data. CONCLUSIONS: The crypt isolation technique is a useful method for accurately  analyzing genetic alterations. Furthermore, our proposed method confirmed the  morphological findings obtained before the genetic analysis.

Author information: (1)INSERM U434, Fondation Jean Dausset, CEPH, Paris, France.  Hemizygosity for the NF2 gene in humans causes a syndromic susceptibility to  schwannoma development. However, Nf2 hemizygous mice do not develop schwannomas  but mainly osteosarcomas. In the tumors of both species, the second Nf2 allele  is inactivated. We report that conditional homozygous Nf2 knockout mice with  Cre-mediated excision of Nf2 exon 2 in Schwann cells showed characteristics of  neurofibromatosis type 2. These included schwannomas, Schwann cell hyperplasia,  cataract, and osseous metaplasia. Thus, the tumor suppressor function of Nf2,  here revealed in murine Schwann cells, was concealed in hemizygous Nf2 mice  because of insufficient rate of second allele inactivation in this cell  compartment. The finding of this conserved function documents the relevance of  the present approach to model the human disease.

Author information: (1)Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Departments of  Microbiology/Immunology and Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine,  Indianapolis 46202, USA.  Members of the Ras superfamily of signaling proteins modulate fundamental  cellular processes by cycling between an active GTP-bound conformation and an  inactive GDP-bound form. Neurofibromin, the protein product of the NF1 tumor  suppressor gene, and p120GAP are GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for p21(Ras)  (Ras) and negatively regulate output by accelerating GTP hydrolysis on Ras.  Neurofibromin and p120GAP differ markedly outside of their conserved GAP-related  domains (GRDs), and it is therefore unknown if the respective GRDs contribute  functional specificity. To address this question, we expressed the GRDs of  neurofibromin and p120GAP in primary cells from Nf1 mutant mice in vitro and in  vivo. Here we show that expression of neurofibromin GRD, but not the p120GAP  GRD, restores normal growth and cytokine signaling in three lineages of primary  Nf1-deficient cells that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Furthermore, utilizing a GAP-inactive mutant NF1  GRD identified in a family with NF1, we demonstrate that growth restoration is a  function of NF1 GRD GAP activity on p21(Ras). Thus, the GRDs of neurofibromin  and p120GAP specify nonoverlapping functions in multiple primary cell types.

LaJeunesse DR(1), McCartney BM, Fehon RG.  Author information: (1)Developmental, Cell and Molecular Biology Group, Department of Biology, Duke  University, Durham, North Carolina 27708-1000, USA.  Merlin, the Drosophila homologue of the human tumor suppressor gene  Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2), is required for the regulation of cell proliferation  and differentiation. To better understand the cellular functions of the NF2 gene  product, Merlin, recent work has concentrated on identifying proteins with which  it interacts either physically or functionally. In this article, we describe  genetic screens designed to isolate second-site modifiers of Merlin phenotypes  from which we have identified five multiallelic complementation groups that  modify both loss-of-function and dominant-negative Merlin phenotypes. Three of  these groups, Group IIa/scribbler (also known as brakeless), Group  IIc/blistered, and Group IId/net, are known genes, while two appear to be novel.  In addition, two genes, Group IIa/scribbler and Group IIc/blistered, alter  Merlin subcellular localization in epithelial and neuronal tissues, suggesting  that they regulate Merlin trafficking or function. Furthermore, we show that  mutations in scribbler and blistered display second-site noncomplementation with  one another. These results suggest that Merlin, blistered, and scribbler  function together in a common pathway to regulate Drosophila wing epithelial  development.

A reliable and robust method for measuring the expression of alternatively  spliced transcripts is an important step in investigating the significance of  each variant. So far, accurate quantification of splice variants has been  laborious and difficult due to the intrinsic limitations of conventional  methods. The many advantages of real-time PCR have made this technique  attractive to study its application in quantification of splice isoforms. We use  skipping of exon 37 in the NF1 gene as a model to compare and evaluate the  different strategies for quantitating splice variants using real-time PCR. An  overview of three different possibilities for detecting alternative transcripts  is given. We propose the use of a boundary-spanning primer to quantify isoforms  that differ greatly in abundance. We describe here a novel method for creating a  reliable standard curve using one plasmid containing both alternative  transcripts. In addition, we validate the use of an absolute standard curve  based on a dilution series of fluorometrically quantified PCR products.

Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a dominantly inherited disease associated with  the central nervous system. The NF2 gene product merlin is a tumor suppressor,  and its mutation or inactivation causes this disease. We report here the crystal  structure of the merlin FERM domain containing a 22-residue alpha-helical  segment. The structure reveals that the merlin FERM domain consists of three  subdomains displaying notable features of the electrostatic surface potentials,  although the overall surface potentials similar to those of ezrin/radixin/moesin  (ERM) proteins indicate electrostatic membrane association. The structure also  is consistent with inactivation mechanisms caused by the pathogenic mutations  associated with NF2.

Ina.Vandenbroucke@rug.ac.be  BACKGROUND: Mutation analysis of the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene has  shown that about 30% of NF1 patients carry a splice mutation resulting in the  production of one or several shortened transcripts. Some of these transcripts  were also found in fresh lymphocytes of healthy individuals, albeit typically at  a very low level. Starting from this initial observation, we were interested to  gain further insight into the complex nature of NF1 mRNA processing. RESULTS: We have used a RT-PCR plasmid library based method to identify novel  NF1 splice variants. Several transcripts were observed with specific  insertions/deletions and a survey was made. This large group of variants  detected in one single gene allows to perform a comparative analysis of the  factors involved in splice regulation. Exons that are prone to skipping were  systematically analysed for 5' and 3' splice site strength, branch point  strength and secondary structure. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed a complex splicing pattern, generating a great  diversity in NF1 transcripts. We found that, on average, exons that are spliced  out in part of the mRNA have significantly weaker acceptor sites. Some variants  identified in this study could have distinct roles and might expand our  knowledge of neurofibromin.

Individuals with  neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) are prone to the development of astrocytomas and  peripheral nerve sheath tumors whereas those affected with neurofibromatosis 2  (NF2) develop schwannomas and meningiomas. The development of traditional  homozygous knockout mice has provided insights into the roles of the NF1 and NF2  genes during development and in differentiation, but has been less instructive  regarding the contribution of NF1 and NF2 dysfunction to the pathogenesis of  specific benign and malignant tumors. Recent progress employing novel mouse  targeting strategies has begun to illuminate the roles of the NF1 and NF2 gene  products in the molecular pathogenesis of NF-associated tumors.

Some of these variants were expressed at low to  moderate low levels and possible implications of these findings are discussed.  Interestingly, two variants (NF1-DeltaE4b and NF1-DeltaE43) were shown to be  highly expressed in specific tissues. NF1-DeltaE43 lacks a nuclear targeting  sequence and might be functionally different from full-length NF1. These novel  NF1 splice variants might expand our understanding of the role of neurofibromin.

We describe a high-resolution radiation hybrid map of the region on human  chromosome 22 containing the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) gene. Eighty-five  hamster-human somatic cell hybrids generated by X-irradiation and cell fusion  were used to generate the radiation hybrid map. The presence or absence of 18  human chromosome 22-specific markers was determined in each hybrid by using  Southern blot hybridization. Sixteen of the 18 markers were distinguishable by  X-ray breakage in the radiation hybrids. Analysis of these data using two  different mathematical models and two different statistical methods resulted in  a single framework map consisting of 8 markers ordered with odds greater than  1000:1. The remaining nonframework markers were all localized to regions  consisting of two adjoining intervals on the framework map with odds greater  than 1000:1. Based on the RH map, the NF2 region of chromosome 22, defined by  the flanking markers D22S1 and D22S28, is estimated to span a physical distance  of approximately 6 Mb and is the most likely location for 9 of the 18 markers  studied: D22S33, D22S41, D22S42, D22S46, D22S56, LIF, D22S37, D22S44, and  D22S15.

We have optimized a technique for in situ localization of specific mRNAs using  digoxigenin-11-dUTP-labeled oligonucleotide probes. DNA probes were synthesized  for type I and type II collagen as well as transforming growth factor-beta 1 and  2 (TGF beta 1 and TGF beta 2). Control experiments, such as competitive  inhibition, nonsense sequence hybridization, and RNAse digestion all indicated  that the technique was highly sensitive and specific. In sections of growth  plate, type II collagen mRNA was predominantly expressed in the lower  proliferative and upper hypertrophic zone, whereas chondrocytes in articular  cartilage stained equally. These techniques then were applied to sections cut  from archival pathology specimens of musculoskeletal tissues. Primitive  chondrocytes in a chondrosarcoma expressed type I and type II collagen mRNA, but  did not stain with the nonsense probe. Sections from an osteosarcoma, an  aneurysmal bone cyst, and a neurofibroma also were investigated. The ability to  use chemically synthesized oligonucleotide probes, the high resolution, and the  short development times possible with this in situ procedure makes this  technique appealing for applied research into the gene expression of normal and  pathologic cellular events.

Gene expression changes in the lungs induced by paraquat (PQ) administration  were studied in rats using DNA microarrays that were detectable for 1,090 genes  per DNA microarray. The rats were subjected to subacute PQ exposure (7 mg/kg,  s.c., daily for eight administrations). Two days after the final administration,  the rats were divided into two groups. Group 1 experienced significant body  weight loss and displayed signs of subacute PQ toxicity, but Group 2 showed no  significant effects due to the PQ treatment. A control group, Group 3, was also  included. In the comparison of the gene expression levels in the animals from  Group 1 or Group 2 to the control animals treated by vehicle, 48 genes in Group  1 and 29 genes from Group 2 were differentially expressed. The twenty-eight  genes were common to these two groups.

The hallmark of NF1 is the onset of  heterogeneous (dermal or plexiform) benign neurofibromas. Plexiform  neurofibromas can give rise to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors  (MPNSTs), and the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. RESULTS: To obtain further insight into the molecular pathogenesis of MPNSTs, we  used real-time quantitative RT-PCR to quantify the mRNA expression of 489  selected genes in MPNSTs, in comparison with plexiform neurofibromas. The  expression of 28 (5.7%) of the 489 genes was significantly different between  MPNSTs and plexiform neurofibromas; 16 genes were upregulated and 12 were  downregulated in MPNSTs. The altered genes were mainly involved in cell  proliferation (MKI67, TOP2A, CCNE2), senescence (TERT, TERC), apoptosis  (BIRC5/Survivin, TP73) and extracellular matrix remodeling (MMP13, MMP9, TIMP4,  ITGB4). More interestingly, other genes were involved in the Ras signaling  pathway (RASSF2, HMMR/RHAMM) and the Hedgehog-Gli signaling pathway (DHH,  PTCH2). Several of the down-regulated genes were Schwann cell-specific (L1CAM,  MPZ, S100B, SOX10, ERBB3) or mast cell-specific (CMA1, TPSB), pointing to a  depletion and/or dedifferentiation of Schwann cells and mast cells during  malignant transformation of plexiform neurofibromas. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that a limited number of signaling pathways, and  particularly the Hedgehog-Gli signaling pathway, may be involved in malignant  transformation of plexiform neurofibromas. Some of the relevant genes or their  products warrant further investigation as potential therapeutic targets in NF1.

To better understand  the molecular heterogeneity of these tumors, we performed gene expression  profiling on 25 NF1-associated and 17 sporadic MPNSTs using oligonucleotide  microarrays representing approximately 8100 unique human gene transcripts. Using  several previously reported statistical approaches, we were unable to identify a  molecular signature that could reliably distinguish between NF1-associated and  sporadic MPNSTs in independent training and test sample sets. However, using an  unsupervised clustering approach, we identified an extensive gene expression  signature that distinguished 9 of the 42 tumors analyzed. This signature  corresponded to relative overexpression of transcripts associated with  neuroglial differentiation (NCAM, MBP, L1CAM, P1P) and relative down-regulation  of proliferation and growth factor associated transcripts (IGF2, FGFR1, MDK,  Ki67). All tumors with this gene expression signature lacked expression of EGFR  and all but one tumor were derived from patients with NF1. However, there were  no other obvious associations with histological grade, tumor site, metastasis,  recurrence, age, or patient survival.

Chen YX(1), Krull CE, Reneker LW.  Author information: (1)Departments of Ophthalmology, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA.  PURPOSE: The chicken embryo lens is a classical model system for developmental  and cell biology studies. To understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie  the morphological changes that occur during lens development, it is important to  develop an effective gene transfer method that permits the analysis of gene  functions in vivo. In ovo electroporation has been successfully used for  introducing DNA into neural and mesenchymal tissues of chicken embryos. In this  study, we explored the possibility of using this technique to manipulate gene  expression in lens epithelial and fiber cells, as well as in other cells of the  chicken eye. METHODS: Two DNA constructs were used in this study. pCAX contains a chicken  beta-actin promoter fused to the CMV IE enhancer to drive enhanced green  fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression. pMES-cNf2 uses the same chimeric promoter  to drive the expression of the chicken neurofibromatosis 2 (cNf2) and EGFP  proteins in the same cell. Plasmid DNA was injected into the lumen of the lens  vesicle in chicken embryos at stage 15. For corneal epithelial and retinal cell  electroporation, DNA was placed near the surface ectoderm in the eye region or  injected into the vitreous cavity, respectively. Electroporation was performed  with one electrode above the eye and the other underneath the head of the  embryo. Chicken embryos were harvested at different time points for EGFP  expression analysis by immunohistochemistry. 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU)  incorporation assays were used to evaluate the effects of cNf2 on lens  epithelial cell proliferation. RESULTS: A strong EGFP signal can be detected in lens cells 4 h after  electroporation. The transfected cells maintain high levels of EGFP expression  for at least 5 days. Overexpressing cNf2 in lens epithelial cells significantly  inhibits cell proliferation. Ectopic expression of EGFP in corneal epithelial  and retinal cells was also achieved by in ovo electroporation. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that exogenous DNA can be effectively  introduced into lens, corneal and retinal cells in the living embryo by in ovo  electroporation. In comparison to viral infection and transgenic mouse  approaches, in ovo electroporation offers an easier and quicker way to  manipulate gene expression during embryonic development. This technique will be  a useful tool for exploring the molecular mechanisms of lens and eye  development.  PMID: 15570216 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",True,In ovo electroporation gene transfer method

Comment in     Cell Oncol. 2005;27(5-6):359; author reply 361. doi: 10.1155/2005/363704.  BACKGROUND AND METHODS: 44 peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNST) (27  schwannomas, 9 neurofibromas and 8 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors  (MPNST)) were analyzed to determine DNA ploidy pattern and to clarify the  conflicting data in the literature concerning this topic (whether benign PNSTs  are aneuploid or not). For further insight we analyzed 6 schwannomas, one  atypical neurofibroma and five MPNSTs by fluorescence in situ hybridization  (FISH) technique using centromeric chromosome probes (7, 17 and 18) and  automatic image analysis station, Metafer 4. RESULTS: Benign schwannomas (including the problematic variants as ancient,  cellular, neuroblastoma like and multiplex schwannomas) could be characterized  by euploid-polyploidisation and by their 4c peak height value which was usually  more than 10% of total cell number measured. These characters were not found  among neurofibromas and MPNST-s. FISH analysis revealed and confirmed that the  'normal' euploid-polyploid cells are mainly eusomic-polysomic containing two,  four, eight or sixteen signals for each chromosomes examined, but in a small  proportion aneusomy was found among tumor cells of benign schwannomas (average:  2.58; range 1.33-3.44). In contrast, the atypical neurofibroma displayed marked  aneusomy (18.44%) but it contained normal eusomic and polysomic cells too. Two  diploid MPNSTs proved to be clearly aneusomic with trisomy of chromosome 17 and  monosomy of chromosome 18. CONCLUSIONS: All these data suggest that ploidy pattern determination combined  with FISH analysis may be a very useful supplementary tool for making a right  diagnosis (to differentiate benign versus malignant schwannomas in problematic  variants) and to understand better the malignant transformation in PNSTs.

Diebold R(1), Bartelt-Kirbach B, Evans DG, Kaufmann D, Hanemann CO.  Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, University of Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, 89070  Ulm, Germany.  Mutation detection in the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) gene is challenging  because when combining mutation detection methods such as single-strand  conformational polymorphism and heteroduplex analysis, denaturing gradient gel  electrophoresis, and direct sequencing of aberrant polymerase chain reaction  (PCR) fragments only 30 to 60% of the constitutional mutations are detected.  Because large deletions and complete chromosome rearrangements are also  described methods such as microarray-comparative genomic hybridization and  fluorescence in situ hybridization are also used. The one type of mutation often  missed corresponds to deletions encompassing one or few exons. To detect this  type we have developed a swift and reliable method. We perform a gene dosage  analysis with two fluorescent multiplex PCR assays that amplify 15 of the 17 NF2  exons. The labeled PCR products are quantified and gene dose is calculated with  respect to controls. We tested the reliability of this method with DNA from  eight NF2 patients with known heterozygous NF2 deletions, eight controls and  four unknown NF2 patients. In all of the patients with known heterozygous  deletions we found in several exons a reduction of gene dosage to 50 to 69%. In  one NF2 patient with previously unknown mutation and a severe phenotype we found  the gene dosage of two exons reduced by 50% indicating a deletion of these two  exons on one allele. This finding was validated by reverse transcriptase-PCR on  fibroblast and schwannoma cell cultures of this patient and cDNA sequencing. Our  gene dosage assay will detect deletions of one or more exons as well as gross  deletions of the whole coding region of the gene. It can complement the existing  screening methods because it is faster and easier.

Green JE(1), Baird AM, Hinrichs SH, Klintworth GK, Jay G.  Author information: (1)Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Frederick,  Maryland 21702-1201.  The expression of the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) tax gene  in transgenic mice has been shown to result in the development of neurofibromas.  Further characterization of these transgenic mice has revealed other significant  pathologic similarities between this transgenic mouse model and human  neurofibromatosis (NF). Pheochromocytomas of the adrenal medulla and hamartomas  of the iris are well-recognized manifestations of human NF. Adrenal medullary  tumors have been found in 68% of transgenic animals that were studied. They  appear, however, not to be pheochromocytomas, but rather composed of  undifferentiated spindle cells. Proliferation of fibroblastlike cells in the  iris also occurs in one-half of the transgenic animals surviving more than 6  months. Melanocytes, however, have not been found in the transgenic iris lesion,  although they are characteristically found in the Lisch nodules of human NF. The  similarities between human neurofibromatosis and this transgenic mouse model (in  which the overexpression of a single gene results in neoplasia) are discussed.  This transgenic system may provide further insights into molecular mechanisms  involved in the pathogenesis of neurofibromatosis.

Comment in     J Neurophysiol. 2005 Dec;94(6):3659-60. doi: 10.1152/jn.00862.2005.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common genetic disorder characterized by  tumor formation. People with NF1 also can experience more intense painful  responses to stimuli, such as minor trauma, than normal. NF1 results from a  heterozygous mutation of the NF1 gene, leading to decreased levels of  neurofibromin, the protein product of the NF1 gene. Neurofibromin is a guanosine  triphosphatase activating protein (GAP) for Ras and accelerates the conversion  of active Ras-GTP to inactive Ras-GDP; therefore mutation of the NF1 gene  frequently results in an increase in activity of the Ras transduction cascade.  Using patch-clamp electrophysiological techniques, we examined the excitability  of capsaicin-sensitive sensory neurons isolated from the dorsal root ganglia of  adult mice with a heterozygous mutation of the Nf1 gene (Nf1+/-), analogous to  the human mutation, in comparison to wildtype sensory neurons. Sensory neurons  from adult Nf1+/- mice generated a more than twofold higher number of action  potentials in response to a ramp of depolarizing current as wild-type neurons.  Consistent with the greater number of action potentials, Nf1+/- neurons had  lower firing thresholds, lower rheobase currents, and shorter firing latencies  than wild-type neurons. Interestingly, nerve growth factor augmented the  excitability of wild-type neurons in a concentration-related manner but did not  further alter the excitability of the Nf1+/- sensory neurons. These data clearly  suggest that GAPs, such as neurofibromin, can play a key role in the  excitability of nociceptive sensory neurons. This increased excitability may  explain the painful conditions experienced by people with NF1.

Therapy-induced cancers are a severe complication of genotoxic therapies. We  used heterozygous Nf1 mutant mice as a sensitized genetic background to  investigate tumor induction by radiation (RAD) and cyclophosphamide (CY).  Mutagen-exposed Nf1(+/-) mice developed secondary cancers that are common in  humans, including myeloid malignancies, sarcomas, and breast cancers. RAD  cooperated strongly with heterozygous Nf1 inactivation in tumorigenesis. Most of  the solid tumors showed loss of the wild-type Nf1 allele but retained two Trp53  alleles. Comparative genomic hybridization demonstrated distinct patterns of  copy number aberrations in sarcomas and breast cancers from Nf1 mutant mice, and  tumor cell lines showed deregulated Ras signaling. Nf1(+/-) mice provide a  tractable model for investigating the pathogenesis of common mutagen-induced  cancers and for testing preventive strategies.

Individuals with germline mutations in NF1 are predisposed to the development of  benign and malignant tumors of the peripheral and central nervous system (CNS).  Children with this disease suffer a high incidence of optic gliomas, a benign  but potentially debilitating tumor of the optic nerve; and an increased  incidence of malignant astrocytoma, reactive astrogliosis and intellectual  deficits. In the present study, we have sought insight into the molecular and  cellular basis of NF1-associated CNS pathologies. We show that mice genetically  engineered to lack NF1 in CNS exhibit a variety of defects in glial cells.  Primary among these is a developmental defect resulting in global reactive  astrogliosis in the adult brain and increased proliferation of glial progenitor  cells leading to enlarged optic nerves. As a consequence, all of the mutant  optic nerves develop hyperplastic lesions, some of which progress to optic  pathway gliomas. These data point to hyperproliferative glial progenitors as the  source of the optic tumors and provide a genetic model for NF1-associated  astrogliosis and optic glioma.

A single YAC  containing the entire NF1 locus has been constructed by homologous recombination  in yeast.

Author information: (1)Developmental Neurogenetics Laboratory, Barrow Neurological Institute, St  Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center, Phoenix, AZ 85013, USA. edonarum@aol.com  BACKGROUND: It has been estimated that more than 50% of patients with  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) have neurobehavioral impairments which include  attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, visual/spatial learning disabilities,  and a myriad of other cognitive developmental problems. The biological  mechanisms by which NF1 gene mutations lead to such cognitive deficits are not  well understood, although excessive Ras signaling and increased GABA mediated  inhibition have been implicated. It is proposed that the cognitive deficits in  NF1 are the result of dysfunctional cellular trafficking and localization of  molecules downstream of the primary gene defect. RESULTS: To elucidate genes involved in the pathogenic process, gene expression  analysis was performed comparing the expression profiles in various brain  regions for control and Nf1+/- heterozygous mice. Gene expression analysis was  performed for hippocampal samples dissected from postnatal day 10, 15, and 20  mice utilizing the Affymetrix Mouse Genome chip (Murine 430 2.0). Analysis of  expression profiles between Nf1+/- and wild-type animals was focused on the  hippocampus because of previous studies demonstrating alterations in hippocampal  LTP in the Nf1+/- mice, and the region's importance in visual/spatial learning.  Network analysis identified links between neurofibromin and kinesin genes, which  were down regulated in the Nf1+/- mice at postnatal days 15 and 20. CONCLUSION: Through this analysis, it is proposed that neurofibromin forms a  binding complex with amyloid precursor protein (APP) and through filamin  proteins interacts with a dopamine receptor (Drd3). Though the effects of these  interactions are not yet known, this information may provide novel ideas about  the pathogenesis of cognitive defects in NF1 and may facilitate the development  of novel targeted therapeutic interventions.

Wells Center for Pediatric Research,  Indiana University School of Medicine, 1044 W. Walnut Street, Indianapolis, IN  46202, USA.  Neurofibromas are common tumors found in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)  patients. These complex tumors are composed of Schwann cells, mast cells,  fibroblasts and perineurial cells embedded in collagen that provide a lattice  for tumor invasion. Genetic studies demonstrate that in neurofibromas,  nullizygous loss of Nf1 in Schwann cells and haploinsufficiency of Nf1 in  non-neuronal cells are required for tumorigenesis. Fibroblasts are a major  cellular constituent in neurofibromas and are a source of collagen that  constitutes approximately 50% of the dry weight of the tumor. Here, we show that  two of the prevalent heterozygous cells found in neurofibromas, mast cells and  fibroblasts interact directly to contribute to tumor phenotype. Nf1+/- mast  cells secrete elevated concentrations of the profibrotic transforming growth  factor-beta (TGF-beta). In response to TGF-beta, both murine Nf1+/- fibroblasts  and fibroblasts from human neurofibromas proliferate and synthesize excessive  collagen, a hallmark of neurofibromas. We also establish that the TGF-beta  response occurs via hyperactivation of a novel Ras-c-abl signaling pathway.  Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of c-abl reverses fibroblast proliferation  and collagen synthesis to wild-type levels. These studies identify a novel  molecular target to inhibit neurofibroma formation.

Author information: (1)Division of Cardiology, Department of Pediatrics, The Children's Hospital of  Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA. ismat@email.chop.edu  Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1; also known as von Recklinghausen's disease) is a  common autosomal-dominant condition primarily affecting neural crest-derived  tissues. The disease gene, NF1, encodes neurofibromin, a protein of over 2,800  amino acids that contains a 216-amino acid domain with Ras-GTPase-activating  protein (Ras-GAP) activity. Potential therapies for NF1 currently in development  and being tested in clinical trials are designed to modify NF1 Ras-GAP activity  or target downstream effectors of Ras signaling. Mice lacking the murine homolog  (Nf1) have mid-gestation lethal cardiovascular defects due to a requirement for  neurofibromin in embryonic endothelium. We sought to determine whether the GAP  activity of neurofibromin is sufficient to rescue complete loss of function or  whether other as yet unidentified functions of neurofibromin might also exist.  Using cre-inducible ubiquitous and tissue-specific expression, we demonstrate  that the isolated GAP-related domain (GRD) rescued cardiovascular development in  Nf1(-/-) embryos, but overgrowth of neural crest-derived tissues persisted,  leading to perinatal lethality. These results suggest that neurofibromin may  possess activities outside of the GRD that modulate neural crest homeostasis and  that therapeutic approaches solely aimed at targeting Ras activity may not be  sufficient to treat tumors of neural crest origin in NF1.

However, understanding of the cellular and  molecular basis of these sequelae is incomplete. Osteoclasts are specialized  myeloid cells that are the principal bone-resorbing cells of the skeleton. We  found that Nf1(+/-) mice contain elevated numbers of multinucleated osteoclasts.  Both osteoclasts and osteoclast progenitors from Nf1(+/-) mice were  hyperresponsive to limiting concentrations of M-CSF and receptor activator of  NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) levels. M-CSF-stimulated p21(ras)-GTP and Akt  phosphorylation was elevated in Nf1(+/-) osteoclasts associated with gains of  function in survival, proliferation, migration, adhesion, and lytic activity.  These gains of function are associated with more severe bone loss following  ovariectomy as compared with that in syngeneic WT mice. Intercrossing Nf1(+/-)  mice and mice deficient in class 1(A) PI3K (p85alpha) restored elevated PI3K  activity and Nf1(+/-) osteoclast functions to WT levels. Furthermore, in  vitro-differentiated osteoclasts from NF1 patients also displayed elevated  Ras/PI3K activity and increased lytic activity analogous to those in murine  Nf1(+/-) osteoclasts. Collectively, our results identify a what we believe to be  a novel cellular and biochemical NF1-haploinsufficient phenotype in osteoclasts  that has potential implications for the pathogenesis of NF1 bone disease.

Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Francisco, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) syndrome is caused by germline mutations in the  NF1 tumor suppressor, which encodes neurofibromin, a GTPase activating protein  for Ras. Children with NF1 are predisposed to juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia  (JMML) and lethally irradiated mice given transplants with homozygous Nf1 mutant  (Nf1-/-) hematopoietic stem cells develop a fatal myeloproliferative disorder  (MPD) that models JMML. We investigated the requirement for signaling through  the GM-CSF receptor to initiate and sustain this MPD by generating Nf1 mutant  hematopoietic cells lacking the common beta chain (Beta c) of the GM-CSF  receptor. Mice reconstituted with Nf1-/-, beta c-/- stem cells did not develop  evidence of MPD despite the presence of increased number of immature  hematopoietic progenitors in the bone marrow. Interestingly, when the Mx1-Cre  transgene was used to inactivate a conditional Nf1 mutant allele in  hematopoietic cells, concomitant loss of beta c-/- reduced the severity of the  MPD, but did not abrogate it. Whereas inhibiting GM-CSF signaling may be of  therapeutic benefit in JMML, our data also demonstrate aberrant proliferation of  Nf1-/-myeloid progenitors that is independent of signaling through the GM-CSF  receptor.

NF1 is caused by a germline mutation in the NF1  gene, with tumors showing loss of the wild type copy of NF1. In addition, NF1  heterozygosity in surrounding stroma is important for tumor formation,  suggesting an additional role of haploinsufficiency for NF1. Studies in mouse  models and NF1 families have implicated modifier genes unlinked to NF1 in the  severity of the disease and in susceptibility to astrocytoma and peripheral  nerve sheath tumors. To determine if differences in Nf1 expression may  contribute to the strain-specific effects on tumor predisposition, we examined  the levels of Nf1 gene expression in mouse strains with differences in tumor  susceptibility using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The data presented  in this paper demonstrate that strain background has as much effect on Nf1  expression levels as mutation of one Nf1 allele, indicating that studies of  haploinsufficiency must be carefully interpreted with respect to strain  background. Because expression levels do not correlate entirely with the  susceptibility or resistance to tumors observed in the strain, these data  suggest that either variation in Nf1 levels is not responsible for the  differences in astrocytoma and peripheral nerve sheath tumor susceptibility in  Nf1-/+;Trp53-/+cis mice, or that certain mouse strains have evolved compensatory  mechanisms for differences in Nf1 expression.

Ho IS(1), Hannan F, Guo HF, Hakker I, Zhong Y.  Author information: (1)Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York 11724, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a dominant genetic disorder that causes tumors  of the peripheral nervous system. In addition, >40% of afflicted children have  learning difficulties. The NF1 protein contains a highly conserved  GTPase-activating protein domain that inhibits Ras activity, and the C-terminal  region regulates cAMP levels via G-protein-dependent activation of adenylyl  cyclase. Behavioral analysis indicates that learning is disrupted in both  Drosophila and mouse NF1 models. Our previous work has shown that defective cAMP  signaling leads to the learning phenotype in Drosophila Nf1 mutants. In the  present report, our experiments showed that in addition to learning, long-term  memory was also abolished in Nf1 mutants. However, altered NF1-regulated Ras  activity is responsible for this defect rather than altered cAMP levels.  Furthermore, by expressing clinically relevant human NF1 mutations and deletions  in Drosophila Nf1-null mutants, we demonstrated that the GAP-related domain of  NF1 was necessary and sufficient for long-term memory, whereas the C-terminal  domain of NF1 was essential for immediate memory. Thus, we show that two  separate functional domains of the same protein can participate independently in  the formation of two distinct memory components.

Meningiomas account for approximately 30% of all primary central nervous system  tumors and are found in half of neurofibromatosis type 2 patients often causing  significant morbidity. Although most meningiomas are benign, 10% are classified  as atypical or anaplastic, displaying aggressive clinical behavior. Biallelic  inactivation of the neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor is associated  with meningioma formation in all NF2 patients and 60% of sporadic meningiomas.  Deletion of the p16(INK4a)/p14(ARF) locus is found in both benign and malignant  meningiomas, while mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene is uncommon.  Previously, we inactivated Nf2 in homozygous conditional knockout mice by  adenoviral Cre delivery and showed that Nf2 loss in arachnoid cells is  rate-limiting for meningioma formation. Here, we report that additional  nullizygosity for p16(Ink4a) increases the frequency of meningioma and  meningothelial proliferation in these mice without modifying the tumor grade. In  addition, by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to screen a large cohort of  mutant mice, we were able to detect meningothelial proliferation and meningioma  development opening the way to future studies in which therapeutic interventions  can be tested as preclinical assessment of their potential clinical application.

To estimate the contribution of single and multi-exon NF1 gene copy-number  changes to the NF1 mutation spectrum, we analysed a series of 201 Italian  patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Of these, 138 had previously been  found, using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography or protein  truncation test, to be heterozygous for intragenic NF1 point  mutations/deletions/insertions, and were excluded from this analysis. The  remaining 63 patients were analysed using multiplex ligation-dependent probe  amplification (MLPA), which allows detection of deletions or duplications  encompassing >or=1 NF1 exons, as well as entire gene deletions. MLPA results  were validated using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) or fluorescent in situ  hybridisation. MLPA screening followed by real-time qPCR detected a total of 23  deletions. Of these deletions, six were single exon, eight were multi-exon, and  nine were of the entire NF1 gene. In our series, deletions encompassing >or=1  NF1 exons accounted for approximately 7% (14/201) of the NF1 gene mutation  spectrum, suggesting that screening for these should now be systematically  included in genetic testing of patients with NF1.

Author information: (1)Mouse Cancer Genetics Program, National Cancer Institute at Frederick,  Frederick, Maryland 21702, USA.  Imprinted genes are monoallelically expressed from either the maternal or  paternal genome. Because cancer develops through genetic and epigenetic  alterations, imprinted genes affect tumorigenesis depending on which parental  allele undergoes alteration. We have shown previously in a mouse model of  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) that inheriting mutant alleles of Nf1 and Trp53  on chromosome 11 from the mother or father dramatically changes the tumor  spectrum of mutant progeny, likely due to alteration in an imprinted gene(s)  linked to Nf1 and Trp53. In order to identify imprinted genes on chromosome 11  that are responsible for differences in susceptibility, we tested candidate  imprinted genes predicted by a bioinformatics approach and an experimental  approach. We have tested 30 candidate genes (Havcr2, Camk2b, Ccdc85a, Cntnap1,  Ikzf1, 5730522E02Rik, Gria1, Zfp39, Sgcd, Jup, Nxph3, Spnb2, Asb3, Rasd1,  Map2k3, Map2k4, Trp53, Serpinf1, Crk, Rasl10b, Itga3, Hoxb5, Cbx1, Pparbp,  Igfbp4, Smarce1, Stat3, Atp6v0a1, Nbr1 and Meox1), two known imprinted genes  (Grb10 and Impact) and Nf1, which has not been previously identified as an  imprinted gene. Although we confirmed the imprinting of Grb10 and Impact, we  found no other genes imprinted in the brain. We did, however, find strain-biased  expression of Camk2b, 5730522E02Rik, Havcr2, Map2k3, Serpinf1, Rasl10b, Itga3,  Asb3, Trp53, Nf1, Smarce1, Stat3, Cbx1, Pparbp and Cntnap1. These results  suggest that the prediction of imprinted genes is complicated and must be  individually validated.

Author information: (1)Department of Tumor Genetics and Biology, Graduate School of Medical  Sciences, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Kumamoto, Japan.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor gene product, neurofibromin,  functions in part as a Ras-GAP, a negative regulator of Ras. Neurofibromin is  implicated in the neuronal abnormality of NF1 patients; however, the precise  cellular function of neurofibromin has yet to be clarified. Using proteomic  strategies, we identified a set of neurofibromin-associating cellular proteins,  including axon regulator CRMP-2 (Collapsin response mediator protein-2). CRMP-2  directly bound to the C-terminal domain of neurofibromin, and this association  was regulated by the manner of CRMP-2 phosphorylation. In nerve growth  factor-stimulated PC12 cells, neurofibromin and CRMP-2 co-localized particularly  on the distal tips and branches of extended neurites. Suppression of  neurofibromin using NF1 small interfering RNA significantly inhibited this  neurite outgrowth and up-regulated a series of CRMP-2 phosphorylations by  kinases identified as CDK5, GSK-3b, and Rho kinase. Overexpression of the  NF1-RAS-GAP-related domain rescued these NF1 small interfering RNA-induced  events. Our results suggest that neurofibromin regulates neuronal  differentiation by performing one or more complementary roles. First,  neurofibromin directly regulates CRMP-2 phosphorylation accessibility through  the complex formation. Also, neurofibromin appears to indirectly regulate CRMP-2  activity by suppressing CRMP-2-phosphorylating kinase cascades via its Ras-GAP  function. Our study demonstrates that the functional association of  neurofibromin and CRMP-2 is essential for neuronal cell differentiation and that  lack of expression or abnormal regulation of neurofibromin can result in  impaired function of neuronal cells, which is likely a factor in NF1-related  pathogenesis.

Recent evidence suggests that alterations in the self-renewal program of  stem/progenitor cells can cause tumorigenesis. By utilizing genetically  engineered mouse models of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), we demonstrated that  plexiform neurofibroma, the only benign peripheral nerve sheath tumor with  potential for malignant transformation, results from Nf1 deficiency in fetal  stem/progenitor cells of peripheral nerves. Surprisingly, this did not cause  hyperproliferation or tumorigenesis in early postnatal period. Instead,  peripheral nerve development appeared largely normal in the absence of Nf1  except for abnormal Remak bundles, the nonmyelinated axon-Schwann cell unit,  identified in postnatal mutant nerves. Subsequent degeneration of abnormal Remak  bundles was accompanied by initial expansion of nonmyelinating Schwann cells. We  suggest abnormally differentiated Remak bundles as a cell of origin for  plexiform neurofibroma.

Author information: (1)Center for Stem Cell Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Life Sciences  Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2216, USA.  Neurofibromatosis is caused by the loss of neurofibromin (Nf1), leading to  peripheral nervous system (PNS) tumors, including neurofibromas and malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). A long-standing question has been  whether these tumors arise from neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) or  differentiated glia. Germline or conditional Nf1 deficiency caused a transient  increase in NCSC frequency and self-renewal in most regions of the fetal PNS.  However, Nf1-deficient NCSCs did not persist postnatally in regions of the PNS  that developed tumors and could not form tumors upon transplantation into adult  nerves. Adult P0a-Cre+Nf1(fl/-) mice developed neurofibromas, and  Nf1(+/-)Ink4a/Arf(-/-) and Nf1/p53(+/-) mice developed MPNSTs, but NCSCs did not  persist postnatally in affected locations in these mice. Tumors appeared to  arise from differentiated glia, not NCSCs.  DOI: 10.1016/j.ccr.2008.01.003 PMCID: PMC2566828 PMID: 18242513 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",True,Parse error - defaulted to include

Author information: (1)Department of Developmental Biology and Kent Waldrep Center for Basic  Neuroscience Research on Nerve Growth and Regeneration, University of Texas  Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390-9133, USA.  The rodent barrel cortex is a useful system to study the role of genes and  neuronal activity in the patterning of the nervous system. Several genes  encoding either intracellular signaling molecules or neurotransmitter receptors  are required for barrel formation. Neurofibromin is a tumor suppressor protein  that has Ras GTPase activity, thus attenuating the MAPK (mitogen-activated  protein kinase) and and PI-3 kinase (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) pathways,  and is mutated in humans with the condition neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).  Neurofibromin is widely expressed in the developing and adult nervous system,  and a common feature of NF1 is deficits in intellectual development. In  addition, NF1 is an uncommonly high disorder among individuals with autism.  Thus, NF1 may have important roles in normal CNS development and function. To  explore roles for neurofibromin in the development of the CNS, we took advantage  of a mouse conditional allele. We show that mice that lack neurofibromin in the  majority of cortical neurons and astrocytes fail to form cortical barrels in the  somatosensory cortex, whereas segregation of thalamic axons within the  somatosensory cortex appears unaffected.

Murine mesothelioma closely  mimicked human malignant mesothelioma. Conditional Nf2;Ink4a/Arf mice showed  increased pleural invasion compared to conditional Nf2;p53 mice. Interestingly,  upon Ink4a loss in the latter mice median survival was significantly reduced and  all tumors were highly invasive, suggesting that Ink4a loss substantially  contributes to the poor clinical outcome of malignant mesothelioma.

Author information: (1)Department of Pharmacology, Wayne State University, 540 East Canfield Ave.,  Detroit, MI 48201, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder that is driven by the loss  of neurofibromin (Nf) protein function. Nf contains a Ras-GTPase-activating  protein domain, which directly regulates Ras signaling. Numerous clinical  manifestations are associated with the loss of Nf and increased Ras activity.  Ras proteins must be prenylated to traffic and functionally localize with target  membranes. Hence, Ras is a potential therapeutic target for treating NF1. We  have tested the efficacy of two novel farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs), 1  and 2, alone or in combination with lovastatin, on two NF1 malignant peripheral  nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) cell lines, NF90-8 and ST88-14. Single treatments of  1, 2, or lovastatin had no effect on Ras prenylation or MPNST cell  proliferation. However, low micromolar combinations of 1 or 2 with lovastatin  (FTI/lovastatin) reduced Ras prenylation in both MPNST cell lines. Furthermore,  this FTI/lovastatin combination treatment reduced cell proliferation and induced  an apoptotic response as shown by morphological analysis, procaspase-3/-7  activation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and accumulation of cells  with sub-G(1) DNA content. Little to no detectable toxicity was observed in  normal rat Schwann cells following FTI/lovastatin combination treatment. These  data support the hypothesis that combination FTI plus lovastatin therapy may be  a potential treatment for NF1 MPNSTs.

Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis,  MO 63110, USA.  Individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) develop abnormalities of both  neuronal and glial cell lineages, suggesting that the NF1 protein neurofibromin  is an essential regulator of neuroglial progenitor function. In this regard,  Nf1-deficient embryonic telencephalic neurospheres exhibit increased  self-renewal and prolonged survival as explants in vivo. Using a newly developed  brain lipid binding protein (BLBP)-Cre mouse strain to study the role of  neurofibromin in neural progenitor cell function in the intact animal, we now  show that neuroglial progenitor Nf1 inactivation results in increased glial  lineage proliferation and abnormal neuronal differentiation in vivo. Whereas the  glial cell lineage abnormalities are recapitulated by activated Ras or Akt  expression in vivo, the neuronal abnormalities were Ras- and Akt independent and  reflected impaired cAMP generation in Nf1-deficient cells in vivo and in vitro.  Together, these findings demonstrate that neurofibromin is required for normal  glial and neuronal development involving separable Ras-dependent and  cAMP-dependent mechanisms.

Author information: (1)Laboratory of New Drug Development, Department of Medicine, Memorial  Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021, USA.  Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are soft-tissue tumors with a  very poor prognosis and largely resistant to chemotherapy. MPNSTs are  characterized by activation of the Ras pathway by loss of tumor suppressor  neurofibromatosis type 1. In view of this, MPNST may be susceptible to  inhibition of the activated Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by  the B-Raf inhibitor sorafenib. MPNST (MPNST and ST8814) and dedifferentiated  liposarcoma (LS141 and DDLS) human tumor cell lines were characterized for Ras  activation and B-Raf expression. Tumor cells were treated with sorafenib and  examined for growth inhibition, inhibition of phospho-MEK, phospho-ERK, cell  cycle arrest, and changes in cyclin D1 and pRb expression. MPNSTs were sensitive  to sorafenib at nanomolar concentrations. This appeared to be due to inhibition  of phospho-MEK, phospho-ERK, suppression of cyclin D1, and hypophosphorylation  of pRb at the CDK4-specific sites, resulting in a G(1) cell cycle arrest. These  effects were not seen in the liposarcoma cells, which either did not express  B-Raf or showed decreased Ras activation. Small interfering RNA-mediated  depletion of B-Raf in MPNSTs also induced a G(1) cell cycle arrest in these  cells, with a marked inhibition of cyclin D1 expression and Rb phosphorylation,  whereas depletion of C-Raf did not affect either. With growth inhibition at the  low nanomolar range, sorafenib, by inhibiting the mitogen-activated protein  kinase pathway, may prove to be a novel therapy for patients with MPNST.

Lasater EA(1), Bessler WK, Mead LE, Horn WE, Clapp DW, Conway SJ, Ingram DA, Li  F.  Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine,  Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the  NF1 tumor suppressor gene. Neurofibromin is encoded by NF1 and functions as a  negative regulator of Ras activity. Somatic mutations in the residual normal NF1  allele within cancers of NF1 patients is consistent with NF1 functioning as a  tumor-suppressor. However, the prevalent non-malignant manifestations of NF1,  including learning and bone disorders emphasize the importance of dissecting the  cellular and biochemical effects of NF1 haploinsufficiency in multiple cell  lineages. One of the least studied complications of NF1 involves cardiovascular  disorders, including arterial occlusions that result in cerebral and visceral  infarcts. NF1 vasculopathy is characterized by vascular smooth muscle cell  (VSMC) accumulation in the intima area of vessels resulting in lumen occlusion.  We recently showed that Nf1 haploinsufficiency increases VSMC proliferation and  migration via hyperactivation of the Ras-Erk pathway, which is a signaling axis  directly linked to neointima formation in diverse animal models of vasculopathy.  Given this observation, we tested whether heterozygosity of Nf1 would lead to  vaso-occlusive disease in genetically engineered mice in vivo. Strikingly,  Nf1+/- mice have increased neointima formation, excessive vessel wall cell  proliferation and Erk activation after vascular injury in vivo. Further, this  effect is directly dependent on a Gleevec sensitive molecular pathway.  Therefore, these studies establish an Nf1 model of vasculopathy, which mirrors  features of human NF1 vaso-occlusive disease, identifies a potential therapeutic  target and provides a platform to further dissect the effect of Nf1  haploinsufficiency in cardiovascular disease.

Flaiz C(1), Ammoun S, Biebl A, Hanemann CO.  Author information: (1)Department of Clinical Neurobiology, Institute of Biomedical and Clinical  Science, Peninsula College for Medicine and Dentistry, Plymouth, UK.  Schwannomas are Schwann cell tumors of the nervous system that occur  spontaneously and in patients with neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) and lack the tumor  suppressor merlin. Merlin is known to bind paxillin, beta1 integrin and focal  adhesion kinase, members of focal contacts, multi-protein complexes that mediate  cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Moreover, merlin-deficient  Schwannomas show pathological adhesion to the extracellular matrix making the  characterization of focal contacts indispensable. Using our Schwannoma in vitro  model of human primary Schwann and Schwannoma cells, we here show that  Schwannoma cells display an increased number of mature and stable focal  contacts. In addition to an involvement of RhoA signaling via the Rho kinase  ROCK, Rac1 plays a significant role in the pathological adhesion of Schwannoma  cells. The Rac1 guanine exchange factor- beta-Pix, localizes to focal contacts  in human primary Schwannoma cells, and we show that part of the Rac1 activation,  an effect of merlin-deficiency, occurs at the level of focal contacts in human  primary Schwannoma cells. Our results help explaining the pathological adhesion  of Schwannoma cells, further strengthen the importance of RhoGTPase signaling in  Schwannoma development, and suggest that merlin's role in tumor suppression is  linked to focal contacts.

Author information: (1)Department of Developmental Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical  Center, Dallas, TX 75390-9133, USA.  We previously reported that central nervous system (CNS) inactivation of Nf1 and  p53 tumor suppressor genes in mice results in the development of low-grade to  high-grade progressive astrocytomas. When the tumors achieve high grade, they  are frequently accompanied by Akt activation, reminiscent of the frequent  association of PTEN mutations in human high-grade glioma. In the present study,  we introduced CNS heterozygosity of Pten into the Nf1/p53 astrocytoma model.  Resulting mice had accelerated morbidity, shortened survival, and full  penetrance of high-grade astrocytomas. Haploinsufficiency of Pten accelerated  formation of grade 3 astrocytomas, whereas loss of Pten heterozygosity and Akt  activation coincided with progression into grade 4 tumors. These data suggest  that successive loss of each Pten allele may contribute to de novo formation of  high-grade astrocytoma and progression into glioblastoma, respectively, thus  providing insight into the etiology of primary glioblastoma. The presence of  ectopically migrating neural stem/progenitor lineage cells in presymptomatic  Pten-deficient mutant brains supports the notion that these tumors may arise  from stem/progenitor cells.

Author information: (1)Division of Experimental Hematology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati,  OH, USA.  Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are chemoresistant sarcomas  with poor 5-year survival that arise in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1  (NF1) or sporadically. We tested three drugs for single and combinatorial  effects on collected MPNST cell lines and in MPNST xenografts. The mammalian  target of rapamycin complex 1 inhibitor RAD001 (Everolimus) decreased growth 19%  to 60% after 4 days of treatment in NF1 and sporadic-derived MPNST cell lines.  Treatment of subcutaneous sporadic MPNST cell xenografts with RAD001  significantly, but transiently, delayed tumor growth, and decreased vessel  permeability within xenografts. RAD001 combined with the epidermal growth factor  receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib caused additional inhibitory  effects on growth and apoptosis in vitro, and a small but significant additional  inhibitory effect on MPNST growth in vivo that were larger than the effects of  RAD001 with doxorubicin. RAD001 plus erlotinib, in vitro and in vivo, reduced  phosphorylation of AKT and total AKT levels, possibly accounting for their  additive effect. The results support the consideration of RAD001 therapy in NF1  patient and sporadic MPNST. The preclinical tests described allow rapid  screening strata for drugs that block MPNST growth, prior to tests in more  complex models, and should be useful to identify drugs that synergize with  RAD001.

Hegedus B(1), Yeh TH, Lee DY, Emnett RJ, Li J, Gutmann DH.  Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis,  MO 63110, USA.  To study the role of the neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) gene in mammalian brain  development, we recently generated mice in which Nf1 gene inactivation occurs in  neuroglial progenitor cells using the brain lipid binding protein (BLBP)  promoter. We found that Nf1(BLBP)CKO mice exhibit significantly reduced body  weights and anterior pituitary gland sizes. We further demonstrate that the  small anterior pituitary size reflects loss of neurofibromin expression in the  hypothalamus, leading to reduced growth hormone releasing hormone, pituitary  growth hormone (GH) and liver insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) production.  Since neurofibromin both negatively regulates Ras activity and positively  modulates cAMP levels, we examined the signaling pathway responsible for these  abnormalities. While BLBP-mediated expression of an activated Ras molecule did  not recapitulate the body weight and hypothalamic/pituitary defects, treatment  of Nf1(BLBP)CKO mice with rolipram to increase cAMP levels resulted in a partial  restoration of the body weight phenotype. Furthermore, conditional expression of  the Ras regulatory GAP domain of neurofibromin also did not rescue the body  weight or Igf1 mRNA defects in Nf1(BLBP)CKO mice. Collectively, these data  demonstrate a critical role for neurofibromin in hypothalamic-pituitary axis  function and provide further insights into the short stature and GH deficits  seen in children with NF1.

CONTEXT: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is among the most common genetic  disorders that cause learning disabilities. Recently, it was shown that  statin-mediated inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase  restores the cognitive deficits in an NF1 mouse model. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of simvastatin on neuropsychological,  neurophysiological, and neuroradiological outcome measures in children with NF1. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-two of 114 eligible children (54%) with  NF1 participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial  conducted between January 20, 2006, and February 8, 2007, at an NF1 referral  center at a Dutch university hospital. INTERVENTION: Simvastatin or placebo treatment once daily for 12 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were scores on a Rey complex figure test  (delayed recall), cancellation test (speed), prism adaptation, and the mean  brain apparent diffusion coefficient based on magnetic resonance imaging.  Secondary outcome measures were scores on the cancellation test (standard  deviation), Stroop color word test, block design, object assembly, Rey complex  figure test (copy), Beery developmental test of visual-motor integration, and  judgment of line orientation. Scores were corrected for baseline performance,  age, and sex. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed between the simvastatin and  placebo groups on any primary outcome measure: Rey complex figure test (beta =  0.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.36 to 0.56); cancellation test (beta =  -0.19; 95% CI, -0.67 to 0.29); prism adaptation (odds ratio = 2.0; 95% CI, 0.55  to 7.37); and mean brain apparent diffusion coefficient (beta = 0.06; 95% CI,  -0.07 to 0.20). In the secondary outcome measures, we found a significant  improvement in the simvastatin group in object assembly scores (beta = 0.54; 95%  CI, 0.08 to 1.01), which was specifically observed in children with poor  baseline performance (beta = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.29 to 1.30). Other secondary  outcome measures revealed no significant effect of simvastatin treatment. CONCLUSION: In this 12-week trial, simvastatin did not improve cognitive  function in children with NF1.

Lau YK(1), Murray LB, Houshmandi SS, Xu Y, Gutmann DH, Yu Q.  Author information: (1)Department of Oncological Sciences, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York,  NY 10029, USA.  Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is an inherited cancer syndrome in which affected  individuals develop nervous system tumors, including schwannomas, meningiomas,  and ependymomas. The NF2 protein merlin (or schwannomin) is a member of the Band  4.1 superfamily of proteins, which serve as linkers between transmembrane  proteins and the actin cytoskeleton. In addition to mutational inactivation of  the NF2 gene in NF2-associated tumors, mutations and loss of merlin expression  have also been reported in other types of cancers. In the present study, we show  that merlin expression is dramatically reduced in human malignant gliomas and  that reexpression of functional merlin dramatically inhibits both subcutaneous  and intracranial growth of human glioma cells in mice. We further show that  merlin reexpression inhibits glioma cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis in  vivo. Using microarray analysis, we identify altered expression of specific  molecules that play key roles in cell proliferation, survival, and motility.  These merlin-induced changes of gene expression were confirmed by real-time  quantitative PCR, Western blotting, and functional assays. These results  indicate that reexpression of merlin correlates with activation of mammalian  sterile 20-like 1/2-large tumor suppressor 2 signaling pathway and inhibition of  canonical and noncanonical Wnt signals. Collectively, our results show that  merlin is a potent inhibitor of high-grade human glioma.

Author information: (1)Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, University of Iowa, Iowa  City, Iowa 52242-1078, USA.  OBJECTIVE: To analyze the ability of ErbB inhibitors to reduce the growth of  vestibular schwannoma (VS) xenografts. METHODS: Vestibular schwannoma xenografts were established in the interscapular  fat pad in nude mice for 4 weeks. Initially, a small cohort of animals was  treated with the ErbB2 inhibitor trastuzumab or saline for 2 weeks. Animals also  received bromodeoxyuridine injections to label proliferating cells. In a  longer-term experiment, animals were randomized to receive trastuzumab,  erlotinib (an ErbB kinase inhibitor), or placebo for 12 weeks. Tumor growth was  monitored by magnetic resonance imaging during the treatment period. Cell death  was analyzed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin end  labeling of fragmented DNA. RESULTS: Tumors can be distinguished with T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging  sequences. Trastuzumab significantly reduced the proliferation of VS cells  compared with control (p < 0.01) as analyzed by bromodeoxyuridine uptake.  Control tumors demonstrated slight growth during the 12-week treatment period.  Both trastuzumab and erlotinib significantly reduced the growth of VS xenografts  (p < 0.05). Erlotinib, but not trastuzumab, resulted in a significant increase  in the percentage of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin  end labeling of fragmented DNA-positive VS cells (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: In this preliminary study, the ErbB inhibitors trastuzumab and  erlotinib decreased growth of VS xenografts in nude mice, raising the  possibility of using ErbB inhibitors in the management of patients with  schwannomas, particularly those with neurofibromatosis Type 2.

Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, Division of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery,  University of California, San Diego School of Medicine and Veterans Affairs  Medical Center, La Jolla, California, USA.  OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Determine the role of estrogen receptor (ER) and  progesterone receptor (PR) expression in sporadic and neurofibromatosis 2  (NF2)-related vestibular schwannomas (VS). Growth and proliferation signaling in  human VS tumorigenesis may play a key role in molecular therapeutic targeting.  VS carry mutations of the NF2 gene encoding the tumor suppressor, merlin, which  interacts with ErbB2 in Schwann cells, implicating ErbB receptors in VS  tumorigenesis. ErbB receptor family members are overexpressed or constitutively  activated in many human tumors, and are effective therapeutic targets in some  human cancers. VS occur more frequently in women and are larger, more vascular,  and demonstrate increased growth rates during pregnancy. ER and PR may play a  role in ErbB pathway activation and VS progression. STUDY DESIGN: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for ER  and PR messenger RNA was performed using greater auricular and vestibular nerve  controls (n = 8), sporadic VS (n = 23), and NF2-related VS (n = 16) tissues. METHODS: The qRT-PCR data were normalized with standardization to a single  constitutively expressed control gene, human cyclophylin. RESULTS: Reverse transcription of messenger RNA from control and tumor specimens  followed by RT Q-PCR demonstrated differences in ER and PR gene expression  between sporadic and NF2-related VS. CONCLUSIONS: ER and PR expression in VS might have implications for development  of a VS-specific drug delivery system using antihormone and ErbB pathway small  molecule inhibitors, due to crosstalk between these receptors. These signals may  be critical for re-establishing ErbB-mediated cell density dependent growth  inhibition.

Kolanczyk M(1), Kühnisch J, Kossler N, Osswald M, Stumpp S, Thurisch B, Kornak  U, Mundlos S.  Author information: (1)Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics, FG Development & Disease,  Berlin, Germany. kolanshy@molgen.mpg.de  BACKGROUND: Bowing and/or pseudarthrosis of the tibia is a known severe  complication of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Mice with conditionally  inactivated neurofibromin (Nf1) in the developing limbs and cranium (Nf1Prx1)  show bowing of the tibia caused by decreased bone mineralisation and increased  bone vascularisation. However, in contrast to NF1 patients, spontaneous  fractures do not occur in Nf1Prx1 mice probably due to the relatively low  mechanical load. We studied bone healing in a cortical bone injury model in  Nf1Prx1 mice as a model for NF1-associated bone disease. Taking advantage of  this experimental model we explore effects of systemically applied lovastatin, a  cholesterol-lowering drug, on the Nf1 deficient bone repair. METHODS: Cortical injury was induced bilaterally in the tuberositas tibiae in  Nf1Prx1 mutant mice and littermate controls according to a method described  previously. Paraffin as well as methacrylate sections were analysed from each  animal. We divided 24 sex-matched mutant mice into a lovastatin-treated and an  untreated group. The lovastatin-treated mice received 0.15 mg activated  lovastatin by daily gavage. The bone repair process was analysed at three  consecutive time points post injury, using histological methods, micro computed  tomography measurements and in situ hybridisation. At each experimental time  point, three lovastatin-treated mutant mice, three untreated mutant mice and  three untreated control mice were analysed. The animal group humanely killed on  day 14 post injury was expanded to six treated and six untreated mutant mice as  well as six control mice. RESULTS: Bone injury repair is a complex process, which requires the concerted  effort of numerous cell types. It is initiated by an inflammatory response,  which stimulates fibroblasts from the surrounding connective tissue to  proliferate and fill in the injury site with a provisional extracellular matrix.  In parallel, mesenchymal progenitor cells from the periost are recruited into  the injury site to become osteoblasts. In Nf1Prx1 mice bone repair is delayed  and characterised by the excessive formation and the persistence of  fibro-cartilaginous tissue and impaired extracellular matrix mineralisation.  Correspondingly, expression of Runx2 is downregulated. High-dose systemic  lovastatin treatment restores Runx2 expression and accelerates new bone  formation, thus improving cortical bone repair in Nf1Prx1 tibia. The bone  anabolic effects correlate with a reduction of the mitogen activated protein  kinase pathway hyper-activation in Nf1-deficient cells. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest the potential usefulness of lovastatin, a drug  approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1987 for the treatment of  hypercholesteraemia, in the treatment of Nf1-related fracture healing  abnormalities. The experimental model presented here constitutes a valuable tool  for the pre-clinical stage testing of candidate drugs, targeting Nf1-associated  bone dysplasia.

Author information: (1)Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Herman B Wells Center for  Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202,  USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common genetic disorder caused by mutations  in the NF1 locus, which encodes neurofibromin, a negative regulator of Ras.  Patients with NF1 develop numerous neurofibromas, which contain many  inflammatory mast cells that contribute to tumor formation. Subsequent to c-Kit  stimulation, signaling from Ras to Rac1/2 to the MAPK pathway appears to be  responsible for multiple hyperactive mast cell phenotypes; however, the specific  effectors that mediate these functions remain uncertain. p21-activated kinase 1  (Pak1) is a downstream mediator of Rac1/2 that has been implicated as a positive  regulator of MAPK pathway members and is a modulator of cell growth and  cytoskeletal dynamics. Using an intercross of Pak 1(-/-) mice with Nf1(+/-)  mice, we determined that Pak1 regulates hyperactive Ras-dependent proliferation  via a Pak1/Erk pathway, whereas a Pak1/p38 pathway is required for the increased  migration in Nf1(+/-) mast cells. Furthermore, we confirmed that loss of Pak1  corrects the dermal accumulation of Nf1(+/-) mast cells in vivo to levels found  in wild-type mice. Thus, Pak1 is a novel mast cell mediator that functions as a  key node in the MAPK signaling network and potential therapeutic target in NF1  patients.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs) are highly malignant and  resistant. Transformation might implicate up regulation of epidermal growth  factor receptor (EGFR). Fifty-two MPNST samples were studied for EGFR, Ki-67,  p53, and survivin expression by immunohistochemistry and for EGFR amplification  by in situ hybridization. Results were correlated with clinical data. EGFR RNA  was also quantified by RT-PCR in 20 other MPNSTs and 14 dermal neurofibromas.  Half of the patients had a neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). EGFR expression,  detected in 86% of MPNSTs, was more frequent in NF1 specimens and closely  associated with high-grade and p53-positive areas. MPNSTs expressed more EGFR  transcripts than neurofibromas. No amplification of EGFR locus was observed. NF1  status was the only prognostic factor in multivariate analysis, with median  survivals of 18 and 43 months for patients with or without NF1. Finally, EGFR  might become a new target for MPNSTs treatment, especially in NF1-associated  MPNSTs.

Plexiform neurofibromas constitute a serious burden for patients with  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a common autosomal dominant disorder  characterized by pigmentary changes and tumorous skin lesions (neurofibromas).  Despite the prominence of these benign tumors in NF1 patients, the mechanisms  underlying the tumor-associated loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in plexiform  neurofibromas have not been extensively studied. We performed LOH analysis on 43  plexiform neurofibromas from 31 NF1 patients, the largest study of its kind to  date. A total of 13 (30%) plexiform neurofibromas exhibited LOH involving 17q  markers. In three tumors, LOH was found to be confined to the NF1 gene region.  However, in none of the tumors was a somatic NF1 microdeletion, mediated by  non-allelic homologous recombination between either NF1-REPs or SUZ12 genes,  detected. Thus, NF1 microdeletions do not appear to be frequent somatic events  in plexiform neurofibromas. Determination of NF1 gene copy number by multiplex  ligation-dependent probe amplification indicated that although tumors with  smaller regions of LOH were characterized by 17q deletions, no NF1 gene copy  number changes were detected in six plexiform neurofibromas with more extensive  LOH. To our knowledge, mitotic recombination has not previously been reported to  be a frequent cause of LOH in plexiform neurofibromas.

Author information: (1)Inserm, Unité Mixte de Recherche en Santé 839, Paris, 75005, France.  Schwannomin/merlin is the product of a tumor suppressor gene mutated in  neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). Although the consequences of NF2 mutations on  Schwann cell proliferation are well established, the physiological role of  schwannomin in differentiated cells is not known. To unravel this role, we  studied peripheral nerves in mice overexpressing in Schwann cells schwannomin  with a deletion occurring in NF2 patients (P0-SCH-Delta39-121) or a C-terminal  deletion. The myelin sheath and nodes of Ranvier were essentially preserved in  both lines. In contrast, the ultrastructural and molecular organization of  contacts between Schwann cells and axons in paranodal and juxtaparanodal regions  were altered, with irregular juxtaposition of normal and abnormal areas of  contact. Similar but more severe alterations were observed in mice with  conditional deletion of the Nf2 gene in Schwann cells. The number of  Schmidt-Lanterman incisures, which are cytoplasmic channels interrupting the  compact myelin and characterized by distinct autotypic contacts, was increased  in the three mutant lines. P0-SCH-Delta39-121 and conditionally deleted mice  displayed exuberant wrapping of nonmyelinated fibers and short internodes, an  abnormality possibly related to altered control of Schwann cell proliferation.  In support of this hypothesis, Schwann cell number was increased along fibers  before myelination in P0-SCH-Delta39-121 mice but not in those with C-terminal  deletion. Schwann cell numbers were also more numerous in mice with conditional  deletion. Thus, schwannomin plays an important role in the control of Schwann  cell number and is necessary for the correct organization and regulation of  axoglial heterotypic and glio-glial autotypic contacts.

Author information: (1)Department of Pharmacology, Wayne State University School of Medicine,  Detroit, Michigan 48201, USA.  Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is characterized by the abnormal proliferation of  neuroectodermal tissues and the development of certain tumors, particularly  neurofibromas, which may progress into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors  (MPNSTs). Effective pharmacological therapy for the treatment of NF1 tumors is  currently unavailable and the prognosis for patients with MPNSTs is poor. Loss  of neurofibromin correlates with increased expression of the epidermal growth  factor receptor (EGFR) and ErbB2 tyrosine kinases and these kinases have been  shown to promote NF1 tumor-associated pathologies in vivo. We show here that  while NF1 MPNST cells have higher EGFR expression levels and are more sensitive  to EGF when compared to a non-NF1 MPNST cell line, the ability of the EGFR  inhibitor gefitinib to selectively inhibit NF1 MPNST cell proliferation is  marginal. We also show that NF1 MPNST proliferation correlates with activated  ErbB2 and can be suppressed by nanomolar concentrations of the pan-ErbB  inhibitor CI-1033 (canertinib). Consequently, targeting both EGFR and ErbB2 may  prove an effective strategy for suppressing NF1 MPNST tumor growth in vivo.

BACKGROUND: Transgenic and xenograft mouse models of vestibular schwannomas have  been previously reported in the literature. However, none of these models  replicate the intracranial location of these tumors to reflect the human  disease. Additionally, traditional imaging methods (magnetic resonance imaging,  computed tomography) for following tumor engraftment and growth are expensive  and time consuming. BLI has been successfully used to longitudinally follow  tumor treatment responses in a noninvasive manner. BLI's lower cost and labor  demands make this a more feasible approach for tumor monitoring in studies  involving large numbers of mice. METHODS: Patient excised vestibular schwannomas were cultured and transduced  with firefly luciferase expressing lentivirus. One million cells were  stereotactically injected into the right caudate nucleus of 21 nonobese  diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice. Schwannoma engraftment and growth  was prospectively followed for 30 weeks after injection with BLI. After animal  sacrifice, the presence of human tumor cells was confirmed with fluorescent in  situ hybridization. RESULTS: Eight (38%) of 21 mice successfully engrafted the schwannoma cells. All  of these mice were generated from 4 (67%) of the 6 patient excised tumors. These  8 mice could be differentiated from the nonengrafted mice at 21 weeks. The  engrafted group emitted BLI of greater than 100,000 photons/s (range,  142,478-3,106,300 photons/s; average, 618,740 photons/s), whereas the  nonengrafted group were all under 100,000 photons/s (range, 0-76,010 photons/s;  average, 10,737 photons/s) (p < 0.001). Fluorescent in situ hybridization  analysis confirmed the presence of viable human schwannoma cells in much greater  numbers in those mice with stable or growing tumors compared with those whose  tumors regressed. CONCLUSION: We have successfully established an intracranial schwannoma  xenograft model that can be followed with noninvasive BLI. We hope to use this  model for in vivo testing of schwannoma tumor therapies.

Striedinger K(1), VandenBerg SR, Baia GS, McDermott MW, Gutmann DH, Lal A.  Author information: (1)Brain Tumor Research Center, Department of Neurological Surgery, University  of California, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized  by the occurrence of schwannomas and meningiomas. Several studies have examined  the ability of the NF2 gene product, merlin, to function as a tumor suppressor  in diverse cell types; however, little is known about merlin growth regulation  in meningiomas. In Drosophila, merlin controls cell proliferation and apoptosis  by signaling through the Hippo pathway to inhibit the function of the  transcriptional coactivator Yorkie. The Hippo pathway is conserved in mammals.  On the basis of these observations, we developed human meningioma cell lines  matched for merlin expression to evaluate merlin growth regulation and  investigate the relationship between NF2 status and Yes-associated protein  (YAP), the mammalian homolog of Yorkie. NF2 loss in meningioma cells was  associated with loss of contact-dependent growth inhibition, enhanced  anchorage-independent growth and increased cell proliferation due to increased  S-phase entry. In addition, merlin loss in both meningioma cell lines and  primary tumors resulted in increased YAP expression and nuclear localization.  Finally, siRNA-mediated reduction of YAP in NF2-deficient meningioma cells  rescued the effects of merlin loss on cell proliferation and S-phase entry.  Collectively, these results represent the first demonstration that merlin  regulates cell growth in human cancer cells by suppressing YAP.

Author information: (1)Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, The Ohio  State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.  Signaling events leading to Schwann cell tumor initiation have been extensively  characterized in the context of neurofibromatosis (NF). Similar tumors are also  observed in patients with the endocrine neoplasia syndrome Carney complex, which  results from inactivating mutations in PRKAR1A. Loss of PRKAR1A causes enhanced  protein kinase A activity, although the pathways leading to tumorigenesis are  not well characterized. Tissue-specific ablation of Prkar1a in neural crest  precursor cells (TEC3KO mice) causes schwannomas with nearly 80% penetrance by  10 months. These heterogeneous neoplasms were clinically characterized as  genetically engineered mouse schwannomas, grades II and III. At the molecular  level, analysis of the tumors revealed almost complete loss of both NF proteins,  despite the fact that transcript levels were increased, implying  posttranscriptional regulation. Although Erk and Akt signaling are typically  enhanced in NF-associated tumors, we observed no activation of either of these  pathways in TEC3KO tumors. Furthermore, the small G proteins Ras, Rac1, and RhoA  are all known to be involved with NF signaling. In TEC3KO tumors, all three  molecules showed modest increases in total protein, but only Rac1 showed  significant activation. These data suggest that dysregulated protein kinase A  activation causes tumorigenesis through pathways that overlap but are distinct  from those described in NF tumorigenesis.

Chang Z(1), Guo CL, Ahronowitz I, Stemmer-Rachamimov AO, MacCollin M, Nunes FP.  Author information: (1)Division of Biology, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125,  USA.  The neurofibromatosis 2 locus (NF2) is inactivated through mutation and loss of  heterozygosity (LOH) in 40-65% of all sporadic meningiomas, while the role of  the p53 tumor suppression pathway in meningioma initiation and progression is  still unclear. This study aims to determine if a p53 codon 72  arginine-to-proline polymorphism, found to be correlated with cancer development  and cancer patient survival in other tumors, is associated with sporadic  meningioma initiation or progression. We investigated Pro72 incidence in a  cohort of 92 sporadic meningiomas and analyzed its association with histological  grade (WHO classification) and with NF2 LOH (determined using polymorphic  microsatellite markers on 22q). The Pro72 allele was not found to be selected  for in the cohort. However, in the subgroup of meningiomas with NF2 LOH and  carrying Pro72, 50.0% had high grade tumors (WHO grades II and III) compared to  only 14.3% of those without NF2 LOH (OR = 6.0, CI = 1.56-23.11, P = 0.012). The  significant association occurred only when considering subgroups of meningiomas  with or without NF2 LOH, suggesting that not including NF2 status when analyzing  study cohorts may explain the variability seen in the literature where all  meningiomas were grouped together. Our data suggests a role for the p53 pathway  in the progression of meningiomas in which NF2 is inactivated, and highlights  the importance of accounting for NF2 LOH in future studies of meningiomas and  the p53 pathway.

Comment in     Cell. 2008 Oct 31;135(3):408-10. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2008.10.009.  Interactions between tumorigenic cells and their surrounding microenvironment  are critical for tumor progression yet remain incompletely understood. Germline  mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene cause neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1),  a common genetic disorder characterized by complex tumors called neurofibromas.  Genetic studies indicate that biallelic loss of Nf1 is required in the  tumorigenic cell of origin in the embryonic Schwann cell lineage. However, in  the physiologic state, Schwann cell loss of heterozygosity is not sufficient for  neurofibroma formation and Nf1 haploinsufficiency in at least one additional  nonneoplastic lineage is required for tumor progression. Here, we establish that  Nf1 heterozygosity of bone marrow-derived cells in the tumor microenvironment is  sufficient to allow neurofibroma progression in the context of Schwann cell Nf1  deficiency. Further, genetic or pharmacologic attenuation of c-kit signaling in  Nf1+/- hematopoietic cells diminishes neurofibroma initiation and progression.  Finally, these studies implicate mast cells as critical mediators of tumor  initiation.

Author information: (1)Department of Neurobiology, Brain Research Institute, University of  California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.  We uncovered a role for ERK signaling in GABA release, long-term potentiation  (LTP), and learning, and show that disruption of this mechanism accounts for the  learning deficits in a mouse model for learning disabilities in  neurofibromatosis type I (NF1). Our results demonstrate that neurofibromin  modulates ERK/synapsin I-dependent GABA release, which in turn modulates  hippocampal LTP and learning. An Nf1 heterozygous null mutation, which results  in enhanced ERK and synapsin I phosphorylation, increased GABA release in the  hippocampus, and this was reversed by pharmacological downregulation of ERK  signaling. Importantly, the learning deficits associated with the Nf1 mutation  were rescued by a subthreshold dose of a GABA(A) antagonist. Accordingly, Cre  deletions of Nf1 showed that only those deletions involving inhibitory neurons  caused hippocampal inhibition, LTP, and learning abnormalities. Importantly, our  results also revealed lasting increases in GABA release triggered by learning,  indicating that the mechanisms uncovered here are of general importance for  learning.

Our previous studies  have shown that cells with overactivation in the Ras pathway are more permissive  to infection with herpes simplex virus 1 and its mutant version R3616. In this  study, we show that among five different mouse MPNST cell lines, only the ones  with elevated levels of Ras signaling are highly permissive to infection with  oncolytic herpes G207. Specific inhibitors of the Ras, ERK, and JNK pathways all  reduced the synthesis of viral proteins in MPNST cells. The cell lines that  contained lower levels of Ras and decreased activation of downstream signaling  components underwent an enhancement in apoptosis upon exposure to G207.  Additionally, mouse SW10 Schwann cells were able to become infected by parental  herpes but were found to be resistant to G207. The immortalization of these cell  lines with the expression of SV40 large T antigen increased the levels of Ras  activation and permissiveness to oncolytic herpes. A Ras/Raf kinase inhibitor  reduced the synthesis of both herpes simplex virus-1 and G207 proteins in SW10  cells. The results of this study, therefore, introduce Ras signaling as a  divergent turning point for the response of MPNST cells to an assault by  oncolytic herpes.

In disease-associated genes, understanding the functional significance of deep  intronic nucleotide variants represents a difficult challenge. We previously  reported that an NF1 intron 30 exonization event is triggered from a single  correct nomenclature is 'c.293-279 A>G' mutation [Raponi M, Upadhyaya M &  Baralle D (2006) Hum Mutat 27, 294-295]. In this paper, we investigate which  characteristics play a role in regulating inclusion of the aberrant pseudoexon.  Our investigation shows that pseudoexon inclusion levels are strongly  downregulated by polypyrimidine tract binding protein and its homologue neuronal  polypyrimidine tract binding protein. In particular, we provide evidence that  the functional effect of polypyrimidine tract binding protein is proportional to  its concentration, and map the cis-acting elements that are principally  responsible for this negative regulation. These results highlight the importance  of evaluating local sequence context for diagnostic purposes, and the utility of  developing therapies to turn off activated pseudoexons.

Individuals with the inherited cancer predisposition syndrome neurofibromatosis  2 (NF2) develop several central nervous system (CNS) malignancies, including  glial cell neoplasms (ependymomas). Recent studies have suggested that the NF2  protein, merlin (or schwannomin), may regulate receptor tyrosine kinase  signaling, intracellular mitogenic growth control pathways, or adherens junction  organization in non-nervous-system cell types. For this report, we used glial  fibrillary acidic protein conditional knockout mice and derivative glia to  determine how merlin regulates CNS glial cell proliferation. We show that the  loss of merlin in glial cells results in increased proliferation in vitro and in  vivo. Merlin regulation of glial cell growth reflects deregulated Src activity,  such that pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of Src activation reduces Nf2(-/-)  glial cell growth to wild-type levels. We further show that Src regulates  Nf2(-/-) glial cell growth by sequentially regulating FAK and paxillin  phosphorylation/activity. Next, we demonstrate that Src activation results from  merlin regulation of ErbB2 activation and that genetic or pharmacologic ErbB2  inhibition reduces Nf2(-/-) glial cell Src/Src effector activation and  proliferation to wild-type levels. Lastly, we show that merlin competes with Src  for direct binding to ErbB2 and present a novel molecular mechanism for merlin  regulation of ErbB2-dependent Src signaling and growth control.

Neurofibromatosis type 2 is an inherited disorder characterized by the  development of benign and malignant tumors on the auditory nerves and central  nervous system with symptoms including hearing loss, poor balance, skin lesions,  and cataracts. Here, we report a novel protein-protein interaction between NF2  protein (merlin or schwannomin) and erythrocyte p55, also designated as MPP1.  The p55 is a conserved scaffolding protein with postulated functions in cell  shape, hair cell development, and neural patterning of the retina. The FERM  domain of NF2 protein binds directly to p55, and surface plasmon resonance  analysis indicates a specific interaction with a kD value of 3.7 nM. We  developed a specific monoclonal antibody against human erythrocyte p55, and  found that both p55 and NF2 proteins are colocalized in the non-myelin-forming  Schwann cells. This finding suggests that the p55-NF2 protein interaction may  play a functional role in the regulation of apico-basal polarity and tumor  suppression pathways in non-erythroid cells.

Three proteins, GTPase activating protein (GAP), neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) and  the yeast inhibitory regulator of the RAS-cAMP pathway (IRA2), have the ability  to stimulate the GTPase activity of Ras proteins from higher animals or yeast.  Previous studies indicate that certain lipids are able to inhibit this activity  associated with the mammalian GAP protein. Inhibition of GAP would be expected  to biologically activate Ras protein. In these studies arachidonic acid is shown  also to inhibit the activity of the catalytic fragments of the other two  proteins, mammalian NF1 and the yeast IRA2 proteins. In addition, phosphatidic  acid (containing arachidonic and stearic acid) was inhibitory for the catalytic  fragment of NF1 protein, but did not inhibit the catalytic fragments of GAP or  IRA2 proteins. These observations emphasize the biochemical similarity of these  proteins and provide support for the suggestion that lipids might play an  important role in their biological control, and therefore also in the control of  Ras activity and cellular proliferation.

Yeh TH(1), Lee DY, Gianino SM, Gutmann DH.  Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis,  Missouri 63110, USA.  Numerous studies have suggested that astrocytes in the central nervous system  (CNS) exhibit molecular and functional heterogeneity. In this regard, astroglia  from different CNS locations express distinct immune system, and  neurotransmitter proteins, have varying levels of gap junction coupling and  respond differently to injury. However, the relevance of these differences to  human disease is unclear. As brain tumors in children arise in specific CNS  locations, we hypothesized that regional astroglial cell heterogeneity might  partly underlie the propensity for gliomas to arise in these areas. In this  study, we performed high-density RNA microarray profiling on astrocytes from  postnatal day 1 optic nerve, cerebellum, brainstem, and neocortex. We showed  that astroglia from each region are molecularly distinct, and we were able to  develop gene expression patterns that distinguish astroglia, but not neural stem  cells, from these different brain regions. We next used these microarray data to  determine whether brain tumor suppressor genes were differentially expressed in  these distinct populations of astroglia. Interestingly, neurofibromatosis type 1  (NF1) gene expression was decreased at both the RNA and protein levels in  neocortical astroglia relative to astroglia from the other brain regions. To  determine the functional significance of this finding, we found increased  astroglial cell proliferation in optic nerve, brainstem, and cerebellum, but not  neocortex, following Nf1 inactivation in vitro and in vivo. These findings  provide molecular evidence for CNS astroglial cell heterogeneity, and suggest  that differences in tumor suppressor gene expression might contribute to the  regional localization of human brain tumors.

Merlin inhibits PI 3-kinase activity through binding to PIKE-L.  Now, we show that merlin is a physiological substrate of Akt, which  phosphorylates merlin on both T230 and S315 residues. This phosphorylation  abolishes the folded conformation of merlin and inhibits its association with  PIKE-L, provoking merlin polyubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation.  This finding demonstrates a negative feed-back loop from merlin/PIKE-L/PI  3-kinase to Akt in tumors- The proliferation repressive activity of merlin is  also partially regulated by S518 phosphorylation- Thus, Akt-mediated merlin  T230/S315 phosphorylation, combined with S518 phosphorylation by PAK and PKA,  provides new insight into abrogating merlin function in the absence of merlin  mutational inactivation.

Author information: (1)Faculty of Health Sciences, Yamaguchi University School of Medicine, Ube,  Yamaguchi, Japan. yamamoms@yamaguchi-u.ac.jp  Neurofibromas are benign tumors that comprise primarily of Schwann cells and  fibroblasts. Mast cells have been found scattered in the tumor tissue, and their  role in promoting the proliferation of neurofibroma has been suggested.  Tranilast (N-[3,4-dimethoxycinnamolyl]anthranilic acid) is an anti-allergic drug  that inhibits release of the chemical mediators from mast cells and it used for  the treatment of keloids and hypertrophic scars by its inhibition of  growth-promoting transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta(1) from fibroblasts. We  assumed that tranilast would suppress neurofibroma cell growth. In order to  prove this hypothesis, we investigated the effectiveness of tranilast in  inhibiting the tumor growth using a new cell culture system obtained from  patients with neurofibromas. We called this culture system with the mixture of  Schwann cells and fibroblasts ""NF1 cells culture"". Mast cells were  differentiated from CD34(+) peripheral blood mononuclear cells of normal healthy  subjects, and were co-cultured with NF1 cells. Three days after tranilast (10  approximately 100 microM) added to the culture dishes, we counted viable cell  numbers and measured the concentrations of TGF-beta(1), stem cell factor (SCF)  and tryptase, which exists in the histamine granule, in the culture medium.  Tranilast significantly suppressed proliferation of the NF1 cells and lowered  the levels of TGF-beta(1), SCF and tryptase. These results suggest that  tranilast retards tumor proliferation through not only suppression of cell  growth factor, but also the inhibition of a chemical mediator released from mast  cells. Thus, tranilast can be a potent therapeutic agent to inhibit the growth  of neurofibromas.  DOI: 10.1620/tjem.217.193 PMID: 19282654 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",True,Parse error - defaulted to include

Raponi M(1), Buratti E, Dassie E, Upadhyaya M, Baralle D.  Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, UK.  Many disease-causing splicing mutations described in the literature produce  changes in splice sites (SS) or in exon-regulatory sequences. The delineation of  these splice aberrations can provide important insights into novel regulation  mechanisms. In this study, we evaluated the effect of patient variations in  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) exon 29 and its 5'SS surrounding area on its  splicing process. Only two of all nonsense, missense, synonymous and intronic  variations analyzed in this study clearly altered exon 29 inclusion/exclusion  levels. In particular, the intronic mutation +5g>a had the strongest effect,  resulting in total exon exclusion. This finding prompted us to evaluate the exon  29 5'SS in relation to its ability to bind U1 snRNP. This was performed by  direct analysis of the ability of U1 to bind to wild-type and mutant donor  sites, by engineering an in vitro splicing system to directly evaluate the  functional importance of U1 snRNA base pairing with the exon 29 donor site, and  by coexpression of mutant U1 snRNP molecules to try to rescue exon 29 inclusion  in vivo. The results revealed a low dependency on the presence of U1 snRNP, and  suggest that exon 29 donor site definition may depend on alternative mechanisms  of 5'SS recognition.

Eckert JM(1), Byer SJ, Clodfelder-Miller BJ, Carroll SL.  Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham,  Alabama 35294-0017, USA.  Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are the most common malignancy  associated with neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1). These Schwann cell  lineage-derived sarcomas aggressively invade adjacent nerve and soft tissue,  frequently precluding surgical resection. Little is known regarding the  mechanisms underlying this invasive behavior. We have shown that MPNSTs express  neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) beta isoforms, which promote Schwann cell migration during  development, and NRG-1 alpha isoforms, whose effects on Schwann cells are poorly  understood. Hypothesizing that NRG-1 beta and/or NRG-1 alpha promote MPNST  invasion, we found that NRG-1 beta promoted MPNST migration in a  substrate-specific manner, markedly enhancing migration on laminin but not on  collagen type I or fibronectin. The NRG-1 receptors erbB3 and erbB4 were present  in MPNST invadopodia (processes mediating invasion), partially colocalized with  focal adhesion kinase and the laminin receptor beta(1)-integrin and  coimmunoprecipitated with beta(1)-integrin. NRG-1 beta stimulated human and  murine MPNST cell migration and invasion in a concentration-dependent manner in  three-dimensional migration assays, acting as a chemotactic factor. Both  baseline and NRG-1 beta-induced migration were erbB-dependent and required the  action of MEK 1/2, SAPK/JNK, PI-3 kinase, Src family kinases and ROCK-I/II. In  contrast, NRG-1 alpha had no effect on the migration and invasion of some MPNST  lines and inhibited the migration of others. While NRG-1 beta potently and  persistently activated Erk 1/2, SAPK/JNK, Akt and Src family kinases, NRG-1  alpha did not activate Akt and activated these other kinases with kinetics  distinct from those evident in NRG-1 beta-stimulated cells. These findings  suggest that NRG-1 beta enhances MPNST migration and that NRG-1 beta and NRG-1  alpha differentially modulate this process.  (c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Ras leads an important signaling pathway that is deregulated in  neurofibromatosis type 1 and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). In  this study, we show that overactivation of Ras and many of its downstream  effectors occurred in only a fraction of MPNST cell lines. RalA, however, was  overactivated in all MPNST cells and tumor samples compared to nontransformed  Schwann cells. Silencing Ral or inhibiting it with a dominant-negative Ral (Ral  S28N) caused a significant reduction in proliferation, invasiveness, and in vivo  tumorigenicity of MPNST cells. Silencing Ral also reduced the expression of  epithelial mesenchymal transition markers. Expression of the NF1-GTPase-related  domain (NF1-GRD) diminished the levels of Ral activation, implicating a role for  neurofibromin in regulating RalA activation. NF1-GRD treatment caused a  significant decrease in proliferation, invasiveness, and cell cycle progression,  but cell death increased. We propose Ral overactivation as a novel cell  signaling abnormality in MPNST that leads to important biological outcomes with  translational ramifications.

The tumor predisposition disorder neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is one of the  most common genetic disorders of the nervous system. It is caused by mutations  in the Nf1 tumor-suppressor gene, which encodes a GTPase-activating protein  (GAP) that negatively regulates p21-RAS. Development of malignant nerve tumors  and neurofibromas occurs frequently in NF1. However, little is known about the  molecular mechanisms mediating the initiation and progression of these complex  tumors, or the identity of the specific cell type that gives rise to dermal or  cutaneous neurofibromas. In this study, we identify a population of  stem/progenitor cells residing in the dermis termed skin-derived precursors  (SKPs) that, through loss of Nf1, form neurofibromas. We propose that SKPs, or  their derivatives, are the cell of origin of dermal neurofibroma. We also  provide evidence that additional signals from nonneoplastic cells in the tumor  microenvironment play essential roles in neurofibromagenesis.

Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a tumor suppressor gene syndrome characterized  by multiple schwannomas, especially vestibular schwannomas (VS), and  meningiomas. Anticancer drug trials are now being explored, but there are no  standardized endpoints in NF2. We review the challenges of NF2 clinical trials  and suggest possible response criteria for use in initial phase II studies. We  suggest two main response criteria in such trials. Objective radiographic  response is defined as a durable 20% or greater reduction in VS volume based on  post-contrast T1-weighted MRI images collected with 3 mm or finer cuts through  the internal auditory canal. Hearing response is defined as a statistically  significant improvement in word recognition scores using 50-word recorded lists  in audiology. A possible composite endpoint incorporating both radiographic  response and hearing response is outlined. We emphasize pitfalls in response  assessment and suggest guidelines to minimize misinterpretations of response. We  also identify research goals in NF2 to facilitate future trial conduct, such as  identifying the expectations for time to tumor progression and time to  measurable hearing loss in untreated NF2-related VS, and the relation of both  endpoints to patient prognostic factors (such as age, baseline tumor volume, and  measures of disease severity). These data would facilitate future use of  endpoints based on stability of tumor size and hearing, which might be more  appropriate for testing certain drugs. We encourage adoption of standardized  endpoints early in the development of phase II trials for this population to  facilitate comparison of results across trials of different agents.

Inactivating mutations of the neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) gene, NF2, result  predominantly in benign neurological tumors, schwannomas and meningiomas, in  humans; however, mutations in murine Nf2 lead to a broad spectrum of cancerous  tumors. The tumor-suppressive function of the NF2 protein, merlin, a  membrane-cytoskeleton linker, remains unclear. Here, we identify the mammalian  target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) as a novel mediator of merlin's tumor  suppressor activity. Merlin-deficient human meningioma cells and merlin  knockdown arachnoidal cells, the nonneoplastic cell counterparts of meningiomas,  exhibit rapamycin-sensitive constitutive mTORC1 activation and increased growth.  NF2 patient tumors and Nf2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts demonstrate  elevated mTORC1 signaling. Conversely, the exogenous expression of wild-type  merlin isoforms, but not a patient-derived L64P mutant, suppresses mTORC1  signaling. Merlin does not regulate mTORC1 via the established mechanism of  phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt or mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular  signal-regulated kinase-mediated TSC2 inactivation and may instead regulate  TSC/mTOR signaling in a novel fashion. In conclusion, the deregulation of mTORC1  activation underlies the aberrant growth and proliferation of NF2-associated  tumors and may restrain the growth of these lesions through negative feedback  mechanisms, suggesting that rapamycin in combination with phosphoinositide  3-kinase inhibitors may be therapeutic for NF2.

The neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene responsible for von Recklinghausen  neurofibromatosis is related to regulators of ras proteins, and a portion of NF1  that is homologous to the ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) encodes a similar  GTPase-stimulating activity. We have raised rabbit antisera to a bacterially  synthesized 48-kDa peptide corresponding to the GAP-related domain of NF1  (NF1-GRD). These antisera immunoprecipitated the NF1-GRD peptide, and one of  them specifically inhibited the GTPase-stimulating activity of NF1-GRD. The sera  specifically detected a 280-kDa protein in lysates of mouse NIH 3T3 and human  HeLa cells. This protein corresponds to the NF1 gene product, as shown by  several criteria, including partial proteolysis. Subcellular fractionation  revealed that while GAP is predominantly cytoplasmic, all of the NF1 was  recovered in a pellet (100,000 x g) fraction. NF1 was present in a large  molecular mass complex in fibroblast and Schwannoma cell lines and appears to  associate with a very large (400-500 kDa) protein in both cell types.

Author information: (1)Wallenberg Laboratory, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska University  Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.  Hyperactive RAS signaling is caused by mutations in RAS genes or a deficiency of  the neurofibromatosis gene (NF1) and is common in myeloid malignancies. In mice,  expression of oncogenic K-RAS or inactivation of Nf1 in hematopoietic cells  results in myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) that do not progress to acute  myeloid leukemia (AML). Because NF1 is a RAS-GTPase-activating protein it has  been proposed that NF1 deficiency is functionally equivalent to an oncogenic  RAS. It is not clear, however, whether Nf1 deficiency would be redundant in  K-RAS-induced MPD development or whether the 2 mutations would cooperate in  leukemogenesis. Here, we show that the simultaneous inactivation of Nf1 and  expression of K-RAS(G12D) in mouse hematopoietic cells results in AML that was  fatal in primary mice within 4 weeks and transplantable to sublethally  irradiated secondary recipients. The data point to a strong cooperation between  Nf1 deficiency and oncogenic K-RAS.  DOI: 10.1182/blood-2009-02-205146 PMID: 19710506 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",True,Mouse model of NF1

Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) carry approximately a 10% lifetime  risk of developing a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). Although  the molecular mechanisms underlying NF1 to MPNST malignant transformation remain  unclear, alterations of both the RAS/RAF/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling  pathways have been implicated. In a series of genetically engineered murine  models, we perturbed RAS/RAF/MAPK or/and PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway, individually or  simultaneously, via conditional activation of K-ras oncogene or deletion of Nf1  or Pten tumor suppressor genes. Only K-Ras activation in combination with a  single Pten allele deletion led to 100% penetrable development of NF lesions and  subsequent progression to MPNST. Importantly, loss or decrease in PTEN  expression was found in all murine MPNSTs and a majority of human NF1-associated  MPNST lesions, suggesting that PTEN dosage and its controlled signaling pathways  are critical for transformation of NFs to MPNST. Using noninvasive in vivo  PET-CT imaging, we demonstrated that FDG can be used to identify the malignant  transformation in both murine and human MPNSTs. Our data suggest that combined  inhibition of RAS/RAF/MAPK and PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathways may be beneficial for  patients with MPNST.

Von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis is a common autosomal dominant genetic  disorder characterized by benign and malignant tumors of neural crest origin.  Significant progress in understanding the pathophysiology of this disease has  occurred in recent years, largely aided by the development of relevant animal  models. Von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis is caused by mutations in the NF1  gene, which encodes neurofibromin, a large protein that modulates the activity  of Ras. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of zebrafish  nf1a and nf1b, orthologues of NF1, and show neural crest and cardiovascular  defects resulting from morpholino knockdown, including vascular and cardiac  valvular abnormalities. Development of a zebrafish model of von Recklinghausen  neurofibromatosis will allow for structure-function analysis and genetic screens  in this tractable vertebrate system.

We used gene expression  profiling to define transcriptional changes between primary normal Schwann cells  (n = 10), NF1-derived primary benign neurofibroma Schwann cells (NFSCs) (n =  22), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (MPNST) cell lines (n = 13),  benign neurofibromas (NF) (n = 26) and MPNST (n = 6). Dermal and plexiform NFs  were indistinguishable. A prominent theme in the analysis was aberrant  differentiation. NFs repressed gene programs normally active in Schwann cell  precursors and immature Schwann cells. MPNST signatures strongly differed; genes  up-regulated in sarcomas were significantly enriched for genes activated in  neural crest cells. We validated the differential expression of 82 genes  including the neural crest transcription factor SOX9 and SOX9 predicted targets.  SOX9 immunoreactivity was robust in NF and MPSNT tissue sections and targeting  SOX9 - strongly expressed in NF1-related tumours - caused MPNST cell death. SOX9  is a biomarker of NF and MPNST, and possibly a therapeutic target in NF1.

Hawes JJ(1), Reilly KM.  Author information: (1)Mouse Cancer Genetics Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland  21702, USA.  Neurofibomatosis (NF1) patients are susceptible to multiple tumors of the  nervous system including neurofibromas, optic glioma, malignant peripheral nerve  sheath tumors (MPNSTs), and astrocytoma. The Nf1+/-;Trp53+/- (NPcis) mouse model  of NF1 spontaneously develops astrocytoma and MPNSTs that are very similar to  human NF1 tumors. To use this model for testing potential therapeutics, we have  developed systems that take advantage of bioluminescent reporters of tumor  growth. We have generated E2F1 promoter-driving luciferase (ELUX) reporter mice  to detect proliferating tumors in NPcis mice in vivo using bioluminescence. The  power of this system is that it enables looking at tumor evolution and detecting  spontaneous tumors at early stages of development as they evolve within their  natural haploinsufficient microenvironment. This system can be used to identify  tumors at different stages of tumorigenesis and to examine where spontaneous NF1  tumors initiate. The ability to rapidly screen multiple animals at a time  increases the potential for use of this model in preclinical trials. This model  will be valuable for the characterization of spontaneous NF1 tumors and will be  important for studying the treatment and prevention of NF1 tumors in vivo.

HYPOTHESIS: To investigate the early events in molecular progression toward  schwannoma tumorigenesis, we developed an in vitro model of human Schwann cell  tumorigenesis by merlin knockdown. BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2)-related and sporadic vestibular schwannoma  (VS) exhibit loss of functional merlin (schwannomin). After loss of merlin  expression in the Schwann cell, the initial steps toward VS tumorigenesis are  unknown. Merlin, a putative tumor suppressor protein, interacts with many  cellular proteins, regulating their function. Among these are receptor tyrosine  kinases, including the epidermal growth factor receptor family B (ErbB) family  receptors epidermal growth factor receptor and ErbB2. Functional merlin  interacts with and internalizes these growth factor receptors, silencing their  proliferation and survival signaling. Deregulation of CD44, the cell  adhesion/signaling molecule and cancer stem cell marker, has also been  implicated in VS tumorigenesis. METHODS: Merlin knockdown was performed using small interfering RNA transfection  into human Schwann cell primary cultures. Knockdown was confirmed by real-time  quantitative PCR, immunofluorescence, and Western analysis. Expression profiles  of ErbB, merlin, and the stem cell markers nestin and CD44 were examined in  knockdowns. Proliferation rate was assessed with bromodeoxyuridine  incorporation, and radiation sensitivity was assessed using the Annexin assay in  knockdowns versus controls. RESULTS: Merlin knockdowns demonstrated increased proliferation rate,  upregulation of epidermal growth factor receptor, ErbB2, and ErbB3, CD44, and  nestin. Short-term merlin depletion had no effect on gamma irradiation  sensitivity compared with controls. CONCLUSION: Merlin depletion results in deregulation of ErbB receptor signaling,  promotes a dedifferentiated state, and increases Schwann cell proliferation,  suggesting critical steps toward schwannoma tumorigenesis.

Wang W(1), Nyman JS, Moss HE, Gutierrez G, Mundy GR, Yang X, Elefteriou F.  Author information: (1)Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Department of Medicine, Nashville, TN  37232-0575, USA.  Postfracture tibial nonunion (pseudoarthrosis) leads to lifelong disability in  patients with neurofibromatosis type I (NF1), a disorder caused by mutations in  the NF1 gene. To determine the contribution of NF1 in bone healing, we assessed  bone healing in the Nf1(ob) (-/-) conditional mouse model lacking Nf1  specifically in osteoblasts. A closed distal tibia fracture protocol and a  longitudinal study design were used. During the 21- to 28-day postfracture  period, callus volume, as expected, decreased in wild-type but not in Nf1(ob)  (-/-) mice, suggesting delayed healing. At these two time points, bone volume  (BV/TV) and volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) measured by 3D micro-computed  tomography were decreased in Nf1(ob) (-/-) callus-bridging cortices and  trabecular compartments compared with wild-type controls. Histomorphometric  analyses revealed the presence of cartilaginous remnants, a high amount of  osteoid, and increased osteoclast surfaces in Nf1(ob) (-/-) calluses 21 days  after fracture, which was accompanied by increased expression of osteopontin,  Rankl, and Tgfbeta. Callus strength measured by three-point bending 28 days  after fracture was reduced in Nf1(ob) (-/-) versus wild-type calluses.  Importantly, from a clinical point of view, this defect of callus maturation and  strength could be ameliorated by local delivery of low-dose lovastatin  microparticles, which successfully decreased osteoid volume and cartilaginous  remnant number and increased callus BV/TV and strength in mutant mice. These  results thus indicate that the dysfunctions caused by loss of Nf1 in osteoblasts  impair callus maturation and weaken callus mechanical properties and suggest  that local delivery of low-dose lovastatin may improve bone healing in NF1  patients.  2010 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

Internal  neurofibromas are associated with increased morbidity and mortality through  malignant transformation and compression of neighboring organs. Our purpose was  to develop and to validate a clinical score for predicting internal  neurofibromas in adults. The development sample comprised 208 patients and the  validation sample 191 patients. The score was developed using logistic  regression. Discrimination and calibration of the model were evaluated. Four  variables were independently associated with internal neurofibromas: at least  two subcutaneous neurofibromas (odds ratio (OR)=4.7, [2.1-10.5]), age < or =30  years (OR=3.1, [1.4-6.8]), absence of cutaneous neurofibromas (OR=2.6,  [0.9-7.5]), and fewer than six café-au-lait spots (OR=2.0 [0.9-4.6]). The score  computed by linear combination of the rounded coefficients of these four  variables ranged from 0 to 40 (mean, 12.8+/-10.8). The probability of internal  neurofibromas was computed as exp (-2.93+0.11Score)/exp (1+(-2.93+0.11Score)).  Probabilities agreed well with the observed frequencies indicating good  calibration, and discrimination was adequate (AUC-ROC, 0.75) in both data sets.  The presence of internal neurofibromas can be accurately predicted using a  simple clinical score. Further work will establish the score threshold that  identifies patients at high risk for complications.

Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, Molecular Imaging Center, Mallinckrodt Institute of  Radiology, Developmental Biology, and Anatomy and Neurobiology, Washington  University School of Medicine and St Louis Children's Hospital, St Louis,  Missouri 63110, USA.  Current models of oncogenesis incorporate the contributions of chronic  inflammation and aging to the patterns of tumor formation. These oncogenic  pathways, involving leukocytes and fibroblasts, are not readily applicable to  brain tumors (glioma), and other mechanisms must account for microenvironmental  influences on central nervous system tumorigenesis. Previous studies from our  laboratories have used neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) genetically engineered mouse  (GEM) models to understand the spatial restriction of glioma formation to the  optic pathway of young children. Based on our initial findings, we hypothesize  that brain region-specific differences in cAMP levels account for the pattern of  NF1 gliomagenesis. To provide evidence that low levels of cAMP promote glioma  formation in NF1, we generated foci of decreased cAMP in brain regions where  gliomas rarely form in children with NF1. Focal cAMP reduction was achieved by  forced expression of phosphodiesterase 4A1 (PDE4A1) in the cortex of Nf1 GEM  strains. Ectopic PDE4A1 expression produced hypercellular lesions with features  of human NF1-associated glioma. Conversely, pharmacologic elevation of cAMP with  the PDE4 inhibitor rolipram dramatically inhibited optic glioma growth and tumor  size in Nf1 GEM in vivo. Together, these results indicate that low levels of  cAMP in a susceptible Nf1 mouse strain are sufficient to promote gliomagenesis,  and justify the implementation of cAMP-based stroma-targeted therapies for  glioma.

Tumorigenesis requires interactions between tumor progenitors and their  microenvironment. We found that low cAMP levels were sufficient for  tumorigenesis in a mouse model of Neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1)-associated optic  pathway glioma (OPG). We hypothesized that the distinct pattern of glioma in NF1  reflected spatiotemporal differences in CXCL12 effects on cAMP levels. Thus, we  sought to alter the pattern of gliomagenesis through manipulation of  CXCL12-CXCR4 pathway activation in Nf1 OPG mice. Forced CXCL12 expression  induced glioma at a low frequency. Further, treatment of Nf1 OPG mice with  AMD3100, a CXCR4 antagonist, did not attenuate glioma growth. Thus, it appears,  CXCL12 alone cannot promote gliomagenesis in NF1 mice.

Author information: (1)Department of Neurobiology, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095,  USA.  Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is one of the most common single-gene causes of  learning disabilities. Here, we use behavioral working memory probes and  electrophysiological studies in a mouse model of NF1 (Nf1 heterozygous null  mutants; Nf1(+/-)) to demonstrate that (i) Neurofibromin regulates prefrontal  and striatal inhibitory networks, specifically activity-dependent GABA release  and (ii) is required for working memory performance, with inhibition-dependent  working memory deficits seen in Nf1(+/-) mice. We find that increased inhibition  in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is sufficient to alter persistent activity in  a biophysical model of an mPFC microcircuit, suggesting a possible mechanism for  Nf1(+/-) working memory deficits. Accordingly, working memory assays applied  during functional MRI (fMRI) studies in human subjects with NF1 reveal  hypoactivation of corticostriatal networks, which is associated with impaired  working memory performance. Collectively, these integrative mouse and human  studies reveal molecular and cellular mechanisms contributing to working memory  deficits in NF1.

Buchanan ME(1), Davis RL.  Author information: (1)Department of Molecular and Human Genetics and Molecular and Cellular  Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.  Nonspecific cognitive impairments are one of the many manifestations of  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). A learning phenotype is also present in  Drosophila melanogaster that lack a functional neurofibromin gene (nf1).  Multiple studies have indicated that Nf1-dependent learning in Drosophila  involves the cAMP pathway, including the demonstration of a genetic interaction  between Nf1 and the rutabaga-encoded adenylyl cyclase (Rut-AC). Olfactory  classical conditioning experiments have previously demonstrated a requirement  for Rut-AC activity and downstream cAMP pathway signaling in neurons of the  mushroom bodies. However, Nf1 expression in adult mushroom body neurons has not  been observed. Here, we address this discrepancy by demonstrating (1) that  Rut-AC is required for the acquisition and stability of olfactory memories,  whereas Nf1 is only required for acquisition, (2) that expression of nf1 RNA can  be detected in the cell bodies of mushroom body neurons, and (3) that expression  of an nf1 transgene only in the alpha/beta subset of mushroom body neurons is  sufficient to restore both protein synthesis-independent and protein  synthesis-dependent memory. Our observations indicate that memory-related  functions of Rut-AC are both Nf1-dependent and -independent, that Nf1 mediates  the formation of two distinct memory components within a single neuron  population, and that our understanding of Nf1 function in memory processes may  be dissected from its role in other brain functions by specifically studying the  alpha/beta mushroom body neurons.

Author information: (1)Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's  Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio 45229, USA.  PURPOSE: Plexiform neurofibromas (pNF) are Schwann cell tumors found in a third  of individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). pNF can undergo  transformation to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). There are no  identified serum biomarkers of pNF tumor burden or transformation to MPNST.  Serum biomarkers would be useful to verify NF1 diagnosis, monitor tumor burden,  and/or detect transformation. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used microarray gene expression analysis to define 92  genes that encode putative secreted proteins in neurofibroma Schwann cells,  neurofibromas, and MPNST. We validated differential expression by quantitative  reverse transcription-PCR, Western blotting, and ELISA assays in cell  conditioned medium and control and NF1 patient sera. RESULTS: Of 13 candidate genes evaluated, only adrenomedullin (ADM) was  confirmed as differentially expressed and elevated in serum of NF1 patients. ADM  protein concentrati on was further elevated in serum of a small sampling of NF1  patients with MPNST. MPNST cell conditioned medium, containing ADM and  hepatocyte growth factor, stimulated MPNST migration and endothelial cell  proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, microarray analysis identifies potential serum biomarkers for  disease, and ADM is a serum biomarker of NF1. ADM serum levels do not seem to  correlate with the presence of pNFs but may be a biomarker of transformation to  MPNST.  ©2010 AACR.

Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis,  MO, USA.  Learning and behavioral abnormalities are among the most common clinical  problems in children with the neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) inherited cancer  syndrome. Recent studies using Nf1 genetically engineered mice (GEM) have been  instructive for partly elucidating the cellular and molecular defects underlying  these cognitive deficits; however, no current model has shed light on the more  frequently encountered attention system abnormalities seen in children with NF1.  Using an Nf1 optic glioma (OPG) GEM model, we report novel defects in  non-selective and selective attention without an accompanying hyperactivity  phenotype. Specifically, Nf1 OPG mice exhibit reduced rearing in response to  novel objects and environmental stimuli. Similar to children with NF1, the  attention system dysfunction in these mice is reversed by treatment with  methylphenidate (MPH), suggesting a defect in brain catecholamine homeostasis.  We further demonstrate that this attention system abnormality is the consequence  of reduced dopamine (DA) levels in the striatum, which is normalized following  either MPH or l-dopa administration. The reduction in striatal DA levels in Nf1  OPG mice is associated with reduced striatal expression of tyrosine hydroxylase,  the rate-limited enzyme in DA synthesis, without any associated dopaminergic  cell loss in the substantia nigra. Moreover, we demonstrate a cell-autonomous  defect in Nf1+/- dopaminergic neuron growth cone areas and neurite extension in  vitro, which results in decreased dopaminergic cell projections to the striatum  in Nf1 OPG mice in vivo. Collectively, these data establish abnormal DA  homeostasis as the primary biochemical defect underlying the attention system  dysfunction in Nf1 GEM relevant to children with NF1.

Author information: (1)Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard  Medical School, 44 Binney Street, Boston, MA 02115, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 is the most commonly inherited human cancer  predisposition syndrome. Neurofibromin (NF1) gene mutations lead to increased  risk of neurofibromas, schwannomas, low grade, pilocytic optic pathway gliomas,  as well as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors and glioblastomas. Despite  the evidence for NF1 tumor suppressor function in glial cell tumors, the  mechanisms underlying transformation remain poorly understood. In this report,  we used morpholinos to knockdown the two nf1 orthologs in zebrafish and show  that oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) numbers are increased in the  developing spinal cord, whereas neurons are unaffected. The increased OPC  numbers in nf1 morphants resulted from increased proliferation, as detected by  increased BrdU labeling, whereas TUNEL staining for apoptotic cells was  unaffected. This phenotype could be rescued by the forced expression of the  GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-related domain of human NF1. In addition, the in  vivo analysis of OPC migration following nf1 loss using time-lapse microscopy  demonstrated that olig2-EGFP(+) OPCs exhibit enhanced cell migration within the  developing spinal cord. OPCs pause intermittently as they migrate, and in nf1  knockdown animals, they covered greater distances due to a decrease in average  pause duration, rather than an increase in velocity while in motion.  Interestingly, nf1 knockdown also leads to an increase in ERK signaling,  principally in the neurons of the spinal cord. Together, these results show that  negative regulation of the Ras pathway through the GAP activity of NF1 limits  OPC proliferation and motility during development, providing insight into the  oncogenic mechanisms through which NF1 loss contributes to human glial tumors.

BACKGROUND: NF2 is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by development of  bilateral vestibular schwannomas and other benign tumors in central nervous  system. Loss of the NF2 gene product, Merlin, leads to aberrant Schwann cell  proliferation, motility, and survival, but the mechanisms by which this tumor  suppressor functions remain unclear. One well-defined target of Merlin is the  group I family of p21-activated kinases, which are allosterically inhibited by  Merlin and which, when activated, stimulate cell cycle progression, motility,  and increased survival. Here, we examine the effect of Pak inhibition on cells  with diminished Merlin function. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using a specific peptide inhibitor of group I  Paks, we show that loss of Pak activity restores normal cell movement in cells  lacking Merlin function. In addition, xenografts of such cells form fewer and  smaller tumors than do cells without Pak inhibition. However, in tumors, loss of  Pak activity does not reduce Erk or Akt activity, two signaling proteins that  are thought to mediate Pak function in growth factor pathways. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that Pak functions in novel  signaling pathways in NF2, and may serve as a useful therapeutic target in this  disease.

Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis,  Missouri 63110, USA.  Whereas carcinogenesis requires the acquisition of driver mutations in  progenitor cells, tumor growth and progression are heavily influenced by the  local microenvironment. Previous studies from our laboratory have used  Neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) genetically engineered mice to characterize the role  of stromal cells and signals to optic glioma formation and growth. Previously,  we have shown that Nf1+/- microglia in the tumor microenvironment are critical  cellular determinants of optic glioma proliferation. To define the role of  microglia in tumor formation and maintenance further, we used CD11b-TK mice, in  which resident brain microglia (CD11b+, CD68+, Iba1+, CD45low cells) can be  ablated at specific times after ganciclovir administration. Ganciclovir-mediated  microglia reduction reduced Nf1 optic glioma proliferation during both tumor  maintenance and tumor development. We identified the developmental window during  which microglia are increased in the Nf1+/- optic nerve and demonstrated that  this accumulation reflected delayed microglia dispersion. The increase in  microglia in the Nf1+/- optic nerve was associated with reduced expression of  the chemokine receptor, CX3CR1, such that reduced Cx3cr1 expression in  Cx3cr1-GFP heterozygous knockout mice led to a similar increase in optic nerve  microglia. These results establish a critical role for microglia in the  development and maintenance of Nf1 optic glioma.

Clinical  observations suggest that the development of SMN correlates with radiation dose;  however, this relationship has not been investigated systematically. We  developed a novel procedure for administering fractionated cranial irradiation  (CI) and investigated the incidence and spectrum of cancer in control and  heterozygous Nf1 mutant mice irradiated to a moderate (15 Gy) or high dose (30  Gy). Heterozygous Nf1 inactivation cooperated with CI to induce solid tumors and  myeloid malignancies, with mice developing many of the most common SMNs found in  human patients. CI-induced malignancies segregated according to radiation dose  as Nf1(+/-) mice developed predominately hematologic abnormalities after 15 Gy,  whereas solid tumors predominated at 30 Gy, suggesting that radiation dose  thresholds exist for hematologic and nonhematologic cancers. Genetic and  biochemical studies revealed discrete patterns of somatic Nf1 and Trp53  inactivation and we observed hyperactive Ras signaling in many radiation-induced  solid tumors. This technique for administering focal fractionated irradiation  will facilitate mechanistic and translational studies of SMNs.  © 2011 AACR.

Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, Box 8111,  660 South Euclid Avenue, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.  The identification of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) as a major mediator  of neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) tumor growth has led to the initiation of clinical  trials using rapamycin analogs. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown  that durable responses to rapamycin treatment in a genetically engineered mouse  model of Nf1 optic glioma require 20 mg/kg/day, whereas only transient tumor  growth suppression was observed with 5 mg/kg/day rapamycin despite complete  silencing of ribosomal S6 activity. To gain clinically relevant insights into  the mechanism underlying this dose-dependent effect, we used Nf1-deficient glial  cells in vitro and in vivo. First, there was an exponential relationship between  blood and brain rapamycin levels. Second, we show that currently used biomarkers  of mTOR pathway inhibition (phospho-S6, phospho-4EBP1, phospho-STAT3, and  Jagged-1 levels) and tumor proliferation (Ki67) do not accurately reflect mTOR  target inhibition or Nf1-deficient glial growth suppression. Third, the  incomplete suppression of Nf1-deficient glial cell proliferation in vivo  following 5 mg/kg/day rapamycin treatment reflects mTOR-mediated AKT activation,  such that combined 5 mg/kg/day rapamycin and PI3-kinase (PI3K) inhibition or  dual PI3K/mTOR inhibition recapitulates the growth suppressive effects of 20  mg/kg/day rapamycin. These new findings argue for the identification of more  accurate biomarkers for rapamycin treatment response and provide reference  preclinical data for comparing human rapamycin levels with target effects in the  brain.

Author information: (1)Department of Neuroscience, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The  Netherlands.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominantly inherited disease,  characterized by various neurocutaneous symptoms, cognitive impairments and  problems in fine and gross motor performance. Although cognitive deficits in NF1  have been attributed to increased release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter  γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) in the hippocampus, the origin of the motor deficits  is unknown. Cerebellar Purkinje cells, the sole output neurons of the cerebellar  cortex, are GABAergic neurons and express neurofibromin at high levels,  suggesting an important role for the cerebellum in the observed motor deficits  in NF1. To test this, we determined the cerebellar contribution to motor  problems in Nf1(+/-) mice, a validated mouse model for NF1. Using the Rotarod, a  non-specific motor performance test, we confirmed that, like NF1 patients,  Nf1(+/-) mice have motor deficits. Next, to evaluate the role of the cerebellum  in these deficits, mice were subjected to cerebellum-specific motor performance  and learning tests. Nf1(+/-) mice showed no impairment on the Erasmus ladder, as  step time and number of missteps were not different. Furthermore, when  compensatory eye movements were tested, no performance deficits were found in  the optokinetic reflex and vestibulo-ocular reflex in the dark (VOR) or in the  light (VVOR). Finally, Nf1(+/-) mice successfully completed short- and long-term  VOR adaptation paradigms, tests that both depend on cerebellar function. Thus,  despite the confirmed presence of motor performance problems in Nf1(+/-) mice,  we found no indication of a cerebellar component. These results, combined with  recent clinical data, suggest that cerebellar function is not overtly affected  in NF1 patients.  © 2011 The Authors.

Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine,  Indianapolis, IN, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant genetic disorder  caused by mutation of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene. Spinal deformities are  common skeletal manifestations in patients with NF1. To date, the mechanism of  vertebral abnormalities remains unclear because of the lack of appropriate  animal models for the skeletal manifestations of NF1. In the present study, we  report a novel murine NF1 model, Nf1(flox/-);Col2.3Cre(+) mice. These mice  display short vertebral segments. In addition, a significant reduction in  cortical and trabecular bone mass of the vertebrae was observed in  Nf1(flox/-);Col2.3Cre(+) mice as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry  (DEXA) and peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT). Peak stress and  peak load were also significantly reduced in Nf1(flox/-);Col2.3Cre(+) mice as  compared to controls. Furthermore, the lumbar vertebrae showed enlargement of  the inter-vertebral canal, a characteristic feature of lumbar vertebrae in NF1  patients. Finally, histologic analysis demonstrated increased numbers of  osteoclasts and decreased numbers of osteoblasts in the vertebrae of  Nf1(flox/-);Col2.3Cre(+) mice in comparison to controls. In summary,  Nf1(flox/-);Col2.3Cre(+) mice demonstrate multiple structural and functional  abnormalities in the lumbar vertebrae which recapitulate the dystrophic  vertebral changes in NF1 patients. This novel murine model provides a platform  to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis  of spinal deficits in NF1 patients.  Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Turk AN(1), Byer SJ, Zinn KR, Carroll SL.  Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, USA.  Although in vitro screens are essential for the initial identification of  candidate therapeutic agents, a rigorous assessment of the drug's ability to  inhibit tumor growth must be performed in a suitable animal model. The type of  animal model that is best for this purpose is a topic of intense discussion.  Some evidence indicates that preclinical trials examining drug effects on tumors  arising in transgenic mice are more predictive of clinical outcome(1)and so  candidate therapeutic agents are often tested in these models. Unfortunately,  transgenic models are not available for many tumor types. Further, transgenic  models often have other limitations such as concerns as to how well the mouse  tumor models its human counterpart, incomplete penetrance of the tumor phenotype  and an inability to predict when tumors will develop. Consequently, many  investigators use xenograft models (human tumor cells grafted into  immunodeficient mice) for preclinical trials if appropriate transgenic tumor  models are not available. Even if transgenic models are available, they are  often partnered with xenograft models as the latter facilitate rapid  determination of therapeutic ranges. Further, this partnership allows a  comparison of the effectiveness of the agent in transgenic tumors and genuine  human tumor cells. Historically, xenografting has often been performed by  injecting tumor cells subcutaneously (ectopic xenografts). This technique is  rapid and reproducible, relatively inexpensive and allows continuous  quantitation of tumor growth during the therapeutic period(2). However, the  subcutaneous space is not the normal microenvironment for most neoplasms and so  results obtained with ectopic xenografting can be misleading due to factors such  as an absence of organ-specific expression of host tissue and tumor genes. It  has thus been strongly recommended that ectopic grafting studies be replaced or  complemented by studies in which human tumor cells are grafted into their tissue  of origin (orthotopic xenografting)(2). Unfortunately, implementation of this  recommendation is often thwarted by the fact that orthotopic xenografting  methodologies have not yet been developed for many tumor types. Malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are highly aggressive sarcomas that  occur sporadically or in association with neurofibromatosis type 1(3) and most  commonly arise in the sciatic nerve(4). Here we describe a technically  straightforward method in which firefly luciferase-tagged human MPNST cells are  orthopically xenografted into the sciatic nerve of immunodeficient mice. Our  approach to assessing the success of the grafting procedure in individual  animals and subsequent non-biased randomization into study groups is also  discussed.

Author information: (1)FG Development & Disease, Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics,  Ihnestrasse 73, Berlin, Germany.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a multi-system disease caused by mutations in  the NF1 gene encoding a Ras-GAP protein, neurofibromin, which negatively  regulates Ras signaling. Besides neuroectodermal malformations and tumors, the  skeletal system is often affected (e.g. scoliosis and long bone dysplasia)  demonstrating the importance of neurofibromin for development and maintenance of  the musculoskeletal system. Here, we focus on the role of neurofibromin in  skeletal muscle development. Nf1 gene inactivation in the early limb bud  mesenchyme using Prx1-cre (Nf1(Prx1)) resulted in muscle dystrophy characterized  by fibrosis, reduced number of muscle fibers and reduced muscle force. This was  caused by an early defect in myogenesis affecting the terminal differentiation  of myoblasts between E12.5 and E14.5. In parallel, the muscle connective tissue  cells exhibited increased proliferation at E14.5 and an increase in the amount  of connective tissue as early as E16.5. These changes were accompanied by  excessive mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation. Satellite cells  isolated from Nf1(Prx1) mice showed normal self-renewal, but their  differentiation was impaired as indicated by diminished myotube formation. Our  results demonstrate a requirement of neurofibromin for muscle formation and  maintenance. This previously unrecognized function of neurofibromin may  contribute to the musculoskeletal problems in NF1 patients.

Lu.Le@UTSouthwestern.edu  Stem cells are under strict regulation by both intrinsic factors and the  microenvironment. There is increasing evidence that many cancers initiate  through acquisition of genetic mutations (loss of intrinsic control) in stem  cells or their progenitors, followed by alterations of the surrounding  microenvironment (loss of extrinsic control). In neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1),  deregulation of Ras signaling results in development of multiple neurofibromas,  complex tumors of the peripheral nerves. Neurofibromas arise from the Schwann  cell lineage following loss of function at the NF1 locus, which initiates a  cascade of interactions with other cell types in the microenvironment and  additional cell autonomous modifications. In this study, we sought to identify  whether a temporal ""window of opportunity"" exists during which cells of the  Schwann cell lineage can give rise to neurofibromas following loss of NF1. We  showed that acute loss of NF1 in both embryonic and adult Schwann cells can lead  to neurofibroma formation. However, the embryonic period when Schwann cell  precursors and immature Schwann cells are most abundant coincides with enhanced  susceptibility to plexiform neurofibroma tumorigenesis. This model has important  implications for understanding early cellular events that dictate neurofibroma  development, as well as for the development of novel therapies targeting these  tumors.  ©2011 AACR.

Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia (JMML) is a relentlessly progressive  myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic (MPD/MDS) hematopoietic disorder more common  in patients with any one of at least three distinct genetic lesions,  specifically NF1 gene loss and PTPN11 and NRAS mutations. NF1 and PTPN11 are  molecular lesions associated with Neurofibromatosis Syndrome Type I (NF1  Syndrome) and Noonan's Syndrome, respectively. The occurrence of JMML is rare;  even among those predisposed with these syndromes to development of disease, and  secondary genetic events likely contribute to the development and progression of  disease. In NF1 syndrome, loss of p53 function is a common event in solid  tumors, but uncommon in JMML, suggesting that the p53 pathway may be modified by  other events in this hematopoietic disorder. The work presented here  investigates the possible role of the p19(Arf) (p19) tumor suppressor in  development of MPD associated with Nf1 gene loss in mice. We find that Nf1  mutant hematopoietic cells with loss of p19 develop accelerated hematopoietic  disease similar to acute leukemia with a variable phenotype. This suggests that  p19 may play a role in development of JMML and evaluation of the human p19  homolog (p14(ARF)) in JMML may be informative.  Copyright © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a life-threatening  complication of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). NF1 is caused by mutation in the  gene encoding neurofibromin, a negative regulator of Ras signaling. There are no  effective pharmacologic therapies for MPNST. To identify new therapeutic  approaches targeting this dangerous malignancy, we developed assays in NF1(+/+)  and NF1(-/-) MPNST cell lines and in budding yeast lacking the NF1 homologue  IRA2 (ira2Δ). Here, we describe UC1, a small molecule that targets NF1(-/-) cell  lines and ira2Δ budding yeast. By using yeast genetics, we identified NAB3 as a  high-copy suppressor of UC1 sensitivity. NAB3 encodes an RNA binding protein  that associates with the C-terminal domain of RNA Pol II and plays a role in the  termination of nonpolyadenylated RNA transcripts. Strains with deletion of IRA2  are sensitive to genetic inactivation of NAB3, suggesting an interaction between  Ras signaling and Nab3-dependent transcript termination. This work identifies a  lead compound and a possible target pathway for NF1-associated MPNST, and shows  a novel model system approach to identify and validate target pathways for  cancer cells in which NF1 loss drives tumor formation.

There is currently no biomarker for tumour load in NF1 patients. METHODS: In situ hybridization and quantitative real-time polymerase reaction  were applied to investigate expression of cartilage-specific genes in mice  bearing conditional inactivation of NF1 in the developing limbs. These mice do  not develop tumours but recapitulate aspects of NF1 bone dysplasia, including  deregulation of cartilage differentiation. It has been recently shown that NF1  tumours require for their growth the master regulator of cartilage  differentiation SOX9. We thus hypothesized that some of the cartilage-specific  genes deregulated in an Nf1Prx1 mouse model might prove to be relevant  biomarkers of NF1 tumours. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing expression of  the SOX9 target gene product melanoma-inhibitory activity/cd-rap (MIA) in tumour  and serum samples of NF1 patients. RESULTS: Increased expression of Mia was found in Nf1-deficient cartilage in  mice. In humans, MIA was expressed in all NF1-related tumours and its serum  levels were significantly higher in NF1 patients than in healthy controls. Among  NF1 patients, MIA serum levels were significantly higher in those with plexiform  neurofibromas and in those with large number of cutaneous (> 1,000) or  subcutaneous (> 100) neurofibromas than in patients without such tumours. Most  notably, MIA serum levels correlated significantly with internal tumour burden. CONCLUSIONS: MIA is a potential serum biomarker of tumour load in NF1 patients  which could be useful in following the disease course and monitoring the  efficacy of therapies.

Brossier NM(1), Carroll SL.  Author information: (1)Department of Cell Biology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham,  AL 35294-0017, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), the most common genetic disorder affecting the  human nervous system, is characterized by the development of multiple benign  Schwann cell tumors in skin and large peripheral nerves. These neoplasms, which  are termed dermal and plexiform neurofibromas respectively, have distinct  clinical courses; of particular note, plexiform, but not dermal, neurofibromas  often undergo malignant progression to form malignant peripheral nerve sheath  tumors (MPNSTs), the most common malignancy occurring in NF1 patients. In recent  years, a number of genetically engineered mouse models have been created to  investigate the molecular mechanisms driving the pathogenesis of these tumors.  These models have been designed to address key questions including: (1) whether  NF1 loss in the Schwann cell lineage is essential for tumorigenesis; (2) what  cell type(s) in the Schwann cell lineage gives rise to dermal neurofibromas,  plexiform neurofibromas and MPNSTs; (3) how the tumor microenvironment  contributes to neoplasia; (4) what additional mutations contribute to  neurofibroma-MPNST progression; (5) what role different neurofibromin-regulated  Ras proteins play in this process and (6) how dysregulated growth factor  signaling facilitates PNS tumorigenesis. In this review, we summarize the major  findings from each of these models and their limitations as well as how  discrepancies between these models may be reconciled. We also discuss how  information gleaned from these models can be synthesized to into a comprehensive  model of tumor formation in peripheral nervous system and consider several of  the major questions that remain unanswered about this process.

Mutations of the neurofibromin gene (NF1) cause neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1),  a disease in which learning disabilities are common. Learning deficits also are  observed in mice with a heterozygous mutation of Nf1 (Nf1(+/-)). Dysregulation  of regulated neurotransmitter release has been observed in Nf1(+/-) mice.  However, the role of presynaptic voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels mediating this  release has not been investigated. We investigated whether Ca(2+) currents and  transmitter release were affected by reduced neurofibromin in Nf1(+/-) mice.  Hippocampal Ca(2+) current density was greater in neurons from Nf1(+/-) mice and  a greater fraction of Ca(2+) currents was activated at less depolarized  potentials. In addition, release of the excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate,  was increased in neuronal cortical cultures from Nf1(+/-) mice. Dendritic  complexity and axonal length were also increased in neurons Nf1(+/-) mice  compared to wild-type neurons, linking loss of neurofibromin to developmental  changes in hippocampal axonal/cytoskeletal dynamics. Collectively, these results  show that altered Ca(2+) channel density and transmitter release, along with  increased axonal growth may account for the abnormal nervous system functioning  in NF1.

Controls included 100 healthy age- and gender-matched control  subjects. METHODS: Confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy was performed for each subject,  investigating the presence and the number of choroidal abnormalities. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy for the  different cutoff values of the criterion choroidal nodules detected by NIR  compared with the NIH criteria. RESULTS: Choroidal nodules detected by NIR imaging were present in 79 (82%) of  95 of the NF1 patients, including 15 (71%) of the 21 NF1 pediatric patients.  Similar abnormalities were present in 7 (7%) of 100 healthy subjects, including  2 (8%) of the 25 healthy pediatric subjects. The highest accuracy was obtained  at the cutoff value of 1.5 choroidal nodules detected by NIR imagery.  Sensitivity and specificity of the examination at the optimal cutoff point were  83% and 96%, respectively. Diagnostic accuracy was 90% in the overall population  and 83% in the pediatric population. Both of these values were in line with the  most common NIH diagnostic criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Choroidal abnormalities appearing as bright patchy nodules detected  by NIR imaging frequently occurred in NF1 patients. The present study shows that  NIR examination to detect choroidal involvement should be considered as a new  diagnostic criterion for NF1.  Copyright © 2012 American Academy of Ophthalmology.

Attention system abnormalities represent a significant barrier to scholastic  achievement in children with neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1). Using a novel mouse  model of NF1-associated attention deficit (ADD), we demonstrate a presynaptic  defect in striatal dopaminergic homeostasis and leverage this finding to apply  [(11)C]-raclopride positron-emission tomography (PET) in the intact animal.  While methylphenidate and l-Deprenyl correct both striatal dopamine levels on  PET imaging and defective attention system function in Nf1 mutant mice,  pharmacologic agents that target de-regulated cyclic AMP and RAS signaling in  these mice do not. These studies establish a robust preclinical model to  evaluate promising agents for NF1-associated ADD.  Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Germline mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene cause neurofibromatosis type  1 (NF1), a complex genetic disorder with a high predisposition of numerous  skeletal dysplasias including short stature, osteoporosis, kyphoscoliosis, and  fracture non-union (pseudoarthrosis). We have developed murine models that  phenocopy many of the skeletal dysplasias observed in NF1 patients, including  reduced bone mass and fracture non-union. We also show that the development of  these skeletal manifestations requires an Nf1 haploinsufficient background in  addition to nullizygous loss of Nf1 in mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSCs)  and/or their progenies. This is replicated in two animal models of NF1,  PeriCre(+);Nf1(flox/-) and Col2.3Cre(+);Nf1(flox/-) mice. Adoptive transfer  experiments demonstrate a critical role of the Nf1+/- marrow microenvironment in  the impaired fracture healing in both models and adoptive transfer of WT bone  marrow cells improves fracture healing in these mice. To our knowledge, this is  the first demonstration of a non-cell autonomous mechanism in non-malignant NF1  manifestations. Collectively, these data provide evidence of a combinatory  effect between nullizygous loss of Nf1 in osteoblast progenitors and  haploinsufficiency in hematopoietic cells in the development of non-malignant  NF1 manifestations.

Author information: (1)Institute of Medical Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Heath  Park Way, Cardiff, UK.  Neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1), caused by heterozygous inactivation of the NF1  tumour suppressor gene, is associated with the development of benign and  malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs). Although numerous germline  NF1 mutations have been identified, relatively few somatic NF1 mutations have  been described in neurofibromas. Here we have screened 109 cutaneous  neurofibromas, excised from 46 unrelated NF1 patients, for somatic NF1  mutations. NF1 mutation screening (involving loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH)  analysis, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and DNA sequencing)  identified 77 somatic NF1 point mutations, of which 53 were novel. LOH spanning  the NF1 gene region was evident in 25 neurofibromas, but in contrast to previous  data from MPNSTs, it was absent at the TP53, CDKN2A and RB1 gene loci. Analysis  of DNA/RNA from neurofibroma-derived Schwann cell cultures revealed NF1  mutations in four tumours whose presence had been overlooked in the tumour DNA.  Bioinformatics analysis suggested that four of seven novel somatic NF1 missense  mutations (p.A330T, p.Q519P, p.A776T, p.S1463F) could be of functional/clinical  significance. Functional analysis confirmed this prediction for p.S1463F,  located within the GTPase-activating protein-related domain, as this mutation  resulted in a 150-fold increase in activated GTP-bound Ras. Comparison of the  relative frequencies of the different types of somatic NF1 mutation observed  with those of their previously reported germline counterparts revealed  significant (P=0.001) differences. Although non-identical somatic mutations  involving either the same or adjacent nucleotides were identified in three pairs  of tumours from the same patients (P<0.0002), no association was noted between  the type of germline and somatic NF1 lesion within the same individual.

Sumner K, Crockett DK, Muram T, Mallempati K, Best H, Mao R.  Legius syndrome (LS) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by germline  loss-of-function mutations in the sprouty-related, EVH1 domain containing 1  (SPRED1) gene. The phenotype of LS is multiple café au lait macules (CALM) with  other commonly reported manifestations, including intertriginous freckling,  lipomas, macrocephaly, and learning disabilities including ADHD and  developmental delays. Since the earliest signs of LS and neurofibromatosis type  1 (NF1) syndrome are pigmentary findings, the two are indistinguishable and  individuals with LS may meet the National Institutes of Health diagnostic  criteria for NF1 syndrome. However, individuals are not known to have an  increased risk for developing tumors (compared with NF1 patients). It is  therefore important to fully characterize the phenotype differences between NF1  and LS because the prognoses of these two disorders differ greatly. We have  developed a mutation database that characterizes the known variants in the  SPRED1 gene in an effort to facilitate this process for testing and interpreting  results. This database is free to the public and will be updated quarterly.  DOI: 10.1534/g3.111.000687 PMCID: PMC3276167 PMID: 22384355",True,SPRED1 genetic variants repository

Author information: (1)Tissue Engineering Lab, Bioengineering Area, Instituto Biodonostia, Hospital  Universitario Donostia, 20014 San Sebastián, Spain.  The most characteristic feature of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the  development of neurofibromas. It has been suggested that these tumors are caused  by somatic inactivation of the wild-type NF1 allele, but the cell that  originally suffers this mutation remains controversial. Several lines of  evidence support the clonal origin of these tumors, and it has been recently  suggested that skin-derived precursor cells (SKPs) could be the cell of origin  of dermal neurofibromas. Nullizygous (NF1(-/-)) SKPs do give rise to  neurofibromas when transplanted to heterozygous mice. Moreover, a nullizygous  population of cells that is S100β negative is present in human neurofibromas,  and NF1(+/-) multipotent progenitor cells are seemingly recruited to the tumor.  This evidence supports the neurofibroma stem cell hypothesis and a putative  involvement of SKPs in the aetiopathogenesis of the disease, suggesting that  SKPs could become a valuable tool for the in vitro study of NF1.

Author information: (1)Divisions of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Oncology, and  Biomedical Informatics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center,  Cincinnati, USA.  PURPOSE: Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) develop malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST), which are often inoperable and do not  respond well to current chemotherapies or radiation. The goal of this study was  to use comprehensive gene expression analysis to identify novel therapeutic  targets. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Nerve Schwann cells and/or their precursors are the  tumorigenic cell types in MPNST because of the loss of the NF1 gene, which  encodes the RasGAP protein neurofibromin. Therefore, we created a transgenic  mouse model, CNP-HRas12V, expressing constitutively active HRas in Schwann cells  and defined a Ras-induced gene expression signature to drive a Bayesian factor  regression model analysis of differentially expressed genes in mouse and human  neurofibromas and MPNSTs. We tested functional significance of Aurora kinase  overexpression in MPNST in vitro and in vivo using Aurora kinase short hairpin  RNAs (shRNA) and compounds that inhibit Aurora kinase. RESULTS: We identified 2,000 genes with probability of linkage to nerve Ras  signaling of which 339 were significantly differentially expressed in mouse and  human NF1-related tumor samples relative to normal nerves, including Aurora  kinase A (AURKA). AURKA was dramatically overexpressed and genomically amplified  in MPNSTs but not neurofibromas. Aurora kinase shRNAs and Aurora kinase  inhibitors blocked MPNST cell growth in vitro. Furthermore, an AURKA selective  inhibitor, MLN8237, stabilized tumor volume and significantly increased survival  of mice with MPNST xenografts. CONCLUSION: Integrative cross-species transcriptome analyses combined with  preclinical testing has provided an effective method for identifying candidates  for molecular-targeted therapeutics. Blocking Aurora kinases may be a viable  treatment platform for MPNST.  ©2012 AACR.

Castellanos, Xavier F [corrected to  Castellanos, F Xavier].  Learning disabilities and other cognitive disorders represent one of the most  important unmet medical needs and a significant source of lifelong disability.  To accelerate progress in this area, an international consortium of researchers  and clinicians, the Learning Disabilities Network (LeaDNet), was established in  2006. Initially, LeaDNet focused on neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a common  single gene disorder with a frequency of 1:3,000. Although NF1 is best  recognized as an inherited tumor predisposition syndrome, learning, cognitive,  and neurobehavioral deficits account for significant morbidity in this condition  and can have a profound impact on the quality of life of affected individuals.  Recently, there have been groundbreaking advances in our understanding of the  molecular, cellular, and neural systems underpinnings of NF1-associated learning  deficits in animal models, which precipitated clinical trials using a  molecularly targeted treatment for these deficits. However, much remains to be  learned about the spectrum of cognitive, neurological, and psychiatric  phenotypes associated with the NF1 clinical syndrome. In addition, there is a  pressing need to accelerate the identification of specific clinical targets and  treatments for these phenotypes. The successes with NF1 have allowed LeaDNet  investigators to broaden their initial focus to other genetic disorders  characterized by learning disabilities and cognitive deficits including other  RASopathies (caused by changes in the Ras signaling pathway). The ultimate  mission of LeaDNet is to leverage an international translational consortium of  clinicians and neuroscientists to integrate bench-to-bedside knowledge across a  broad range of cognitive genetic disorders, with the goal of accelerating the  development of rational and biologically based treatments.

Author information: (1)Division of Molecular Medicine and Genetics, Department of Internal Medicine,  University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.  Germline mutations in the RAS/ERK signaling pathway underlie several related  developmental disorders collectively termed neuro-cardio-facial-cutaneous (NCFC)  syndromes. NCFC patients manifest varying degrees of cognitive impairment, but  the developmental basis of their brain abnormalities remains largely unknown.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), an NCFC syndrome, is caused by loss-of-function  heterozygous mutations in the NF1 gene, which encodes neurofibromin, a RAS  GTPase-activating protein. Here, we show that biallelic Nf1 inactivation  promotes Erk-dependent, ectopic Olig2 expression specifically in  transit-amplifying progenitors, leading to increased gliogenesis at the expense  of neurogenesis in neonatal and adult subventricular zone (SVZ). Nf1-deficient  brains exhibit enlarged corpus callosum, a structural defect linked to severe  learning deficits in NF1 patients. Strikingly, these NF1-associated  developmental defects are rescued by transient treatment with an MEK/ERK  inhibitor during neonatal stages. This study reveals a critical role for Nf1 in  maintaining postnatal SVZ-derived neurogenesis and identifies a potential  therapeutic window for treating NF1-associated brain abnormalities.

The study of somatic genetic alterations in tumors contributes to the  understanding and management of cancer. Genetic alterations, such us copy number  or copy neutral changes, generate allelic imbalances (AIs) that can be  determined using polymorphic markers. Here we report the development of a simple  set of calculations for analyzing microsatellite multiplex PCR data from  control-tumor pairs that allows us to obtain accurate information not only  regarding the AI status of tumors, but also the percentage of tumor-infiltrating  normal cells, the locus copy-number status and the mechanism involved in AI. We  validated this new approach by re-analyzing a set of Neurofibromatosis type  1-associated dermal neurofibromas and comparing newly generated data with  results obtained for the same tumors in a previous study using MLPA, Paralog  Ratio Analysis and SNP-array techniques.Microsatellite multiplex PCR analysis  (MMPA) should be particularly useful for analyzing specific regions of the  genome containing tumor suppressor genes and also for determining the percentage  of infiltrating normal cells within tumors allowing them to be sorted before  they are analyzed by more expensive techniques.

To bring insights into neurofibroma biochemistry, a comprehensive secretome  analysis was performed on cultured human primary Schwann cells isolated from  surgically resected plexiform neurofibroma and from normal nerve tissue. Using a  combination of SDS-PAGE and high precision LC-MS/MS, 907 proteins were  confidently identified in the conditioned media of Schwann cell cultures  combined. Label free proteome profiling revealed consistent release of high  levels of 22 proteins by the four biological replicates of NF1 Schwann cell  cultures relative to the two normal Schwann cell cultures. Inversely, 9 proteins  displayed decreased levels in the conditioned media of NF1 relative to normal  Schwann cells. The proteins with increased levels included proteins involved in  cell growth, angiogenesis and complement pathway while proteins with decreased  levels included those involved in cell adhesion, plasminogen pathway and  extracellular matrix remodeling. Retinoic acid receptor responder protein-1  (RARRES1), previously described as an integral membrane tumor suppressor, was  found exclusively secreted by NF1 Schwann cells but not by normal Schwann cells.  All-trans retinoic acid modulated secretion of RARRES1 in a dose dependent  manner. This study shows altered secretion of key proteins in NF1 derived  Schwann cells. The potential implication of these proteins in neurofibroma  biology is discussed.  DOI: 10.3390/ijms13079380 PMCID: PMC3430302 PMID: 22942771 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",True,Secretome survey tool

Author information: (1)Pediatric Oncology Branch, NCI, CCR, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.  aekim@childrensnational.org  BACKGROUND: Sorafenib targets multiple pathways thought to be crucial in growth  of plexiform neurofibroma (PN) in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).  Sorafenib has been tolerated with manageable toxicities in adults and children  with refractory cancer. We conducted a separate study in this population.  Monitoring long-term toxicities such as effects on growth and obtaining  additional pharmacokinetic data were of importance due to the young age and long  duration of therapy seen in previous phase I trials in children with NF1. PROCEDURE: Children ≥3 and ≤18-year-old with NF1 and inoperable PN were  eligible. Sorafenib was administered orally twice daily for consecutive 28-day  cycles. Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined from toxicities observed  during the first three cycles. RESULTS: Nine children enrolled, median age 8 (6-12) years. At the starting  115 mg/m(2) /dose (n = 5), two experienced dose-limiting grade 3 pain in their  PN. At the de-escalated 80 mg/m(2) /dose (n = 4), approximately 40% of the  pediatric solid tumor MTD, two had dose-limiting toxicity (grade 3 rash and  grade 4 mood alteration), exceeding the MTD. At 80 mg/m(2) /dose, the median  AUC(0-12 hours) at steady-state was 39.5 µg hours/ml. Toxicities appeared to  correspond with decreases in quality of life (QOL). No tumor shrinkage was  observed. CONCLUSIONS: Children with NF1 and PN did not tolerate sorafenib at doses  substantially lower than the MTD in children and adults with malignant solid  tumors. Future trials with targeted agents for children with NF1 may require a  more conservative starting dose and separate definitions of dose limiting  toxicities (DLT) than children with cancer.

Author information: (1)Department of Radiation Oncology, University of California, San Francisco,  San Francisco, California, USA.  Second malignant neoplasms (SMN) are therapy-induced malignancies and a growing  problem in cancer survivors, particularly survivors of childhood cancers. The  lack of experimental models of SMNs has limited understanding of their  pathogenesis. It is currently not possible to predict or prevent this  devastating late complication. Individuals with neurofibromatosis I (NF1) are at  increased risk of developing therapy-induced cancers for unclear reasons. To  model SMNs, we replicated clinical radiotherapy and delivered fractionated  abdominal irradiation to Nf1(+/-) and wild-type mice. Similar to irradiated  cancer survivors, irradiated wild-type and Nf1(+/-) mice developed diverse  in-field malignancies. In Nf1(+/-) mice, fractionated irradiation promoted both  classical NF1-associated malignancies and malignancies unassociated with the NF1  syndrome but typical of SMNs. Nf1 heterozygosity potentiated the mutagenic  effects of irradiation, as evidenced by the significantly reduced survival after  irradiation and tumor development that was often characterized by synchronous  primary tumors. Interestingly, diverse radiation-induced tumors arising in  wild-type and Nf1(+/-) mice shared a genetic signature characterized by  monoallelic loss of Nf1 and the adjacent Trp53 allele. These findings implicate  Nf1 loss as mediating tumorigenesis in a broad range of cell types and organs  extending beyond the classical NF1 tumor histologies. Examining clinical SMN  samples, we found LOH of NF1 in SMNs from non-NF1 patients. Nf1 heterozygosity  confers broad susceptibility to genotoxin-induced tumorigenesis, and this  paradigm serves as an experimental platform for future studies of SMNs.

Functional MR imaging using DTI can increment the  diagnostic performance in differentiation of these lesions. Our aim was to  evaluate the role of 3T anatomic MR imaging and DTI in the characterization of  peripheral nerve tumor and tumorlike conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients (13 men, 16 women; mean age, 41±18  years; range, 11-83 years) with a nerve tumor or tumorlike condition (25 benign,  5 malignant) underwent 3T MR imaging by using anatomic (n=29), functional  diffusion, DWI (n=21), and DTI (n=24) techniques. Images were evaluated for  image quality (3-point scale), ADC of the lesion, tractography, and fractional  anisotropy of nerves with interobserver reliability in ADC and FA measurements. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in age (benign, 40±18 versus  malignant, 45±19 years) and sex (benign, male/female=12:12 versus malignant,  male/female=3:2) (P>.05). All anatomic (29/29, 100%) MR imaging studies received  ""good"" quality; 20/21 (95%) DWI and 21/24 (79%) DTI studies received ""good""  quality. ADC of benign lesions (1.848±0.40×10(-3) mm2/s) differed from that of  malignant lesions (0.900±0.25×10(-3) mm2/s, P<.001) with excellent interobserver  reliability (ICC=0.988 [95% CI, 0.976-0.994]). There were no FA or ADC  differences between men and women (P>.05). FA of involved nerves was lower than  that in contralateral healthy nerves (P<.001) with excellent interobserver  reliability (ICC=0.970 [95% CI, 0.946-0.991]). ADC on DTI and DWI was not  statistically different (P>.05), with excellent intermethod reliability  (ICC=0.943 [95% CI, 0.836-0.980]). Tractography differences were observed in  benign and malignant lesions. CONCLUSIONS: 3T MR imaging and DTI are valuable methods for anatomic and  functional evaluation of peripheral nerve lesions with excellent interobserver  reliability. While tractography and low FA provide insight into neural  integrity, low diffusivity values indicate malignancy in neural masses.

Schwannomas are tumors formed by proliferation of dedifferentiated Schwann  cells. Patients with neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) and schwannomatosis develop  multiple schwannomas in peripheral and cranial nerves. Although benign, these  tumors can cause extreme pain and compromise sensory/motor functions, including  hearing and vision. At present, surgical resection is the main treatment  modality, but it can be problematic because of tumor inaccessibility and risk of  nerve damage. We have explored gene therapy for schwannomas, using a model in  which immortalized human NF2 schwannoma cells expressing a fluorescent protein  and luciferase are implanted in the sciatic nerve of nude mice. Direct injection  of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 1 vector encoding caspase-1 (ICE)  under the Schwann-cell specific promoter, P0, leads to regression of these  tumors with essentially no vector-mediated neuropathology, and no changes in  sensory or motor function. In a related NF2 xenograft model designed to cause  measurable pain behavior, the same gene therapy leads to tumor regression and  concordant resolution of tumor-associated pain. This AAV1-P0-ICE vector holds  promise for clinical treatment of schwannomas by direct intratumoral injection  to achieve reduction in tumor size and normalization of neuronal function.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 is one of the most common familial  diseases, the hallmark of which is the development of multiple neurofibromas.  These are benign nerve sheath tumours, which can transform into malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNST). METHODS: The aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed microRNA  (miRNA) in neurofibromas and MPNST obtained from patients with neurofibromatosis  type 1 using microarray analysis. Differential expression was validated by  reverse transcription quantitative-PCR, and functional studies were performed  after transfection of miRNA oligonucleotide mimics into MPNST cells. RESULTS: Sixteen miRNA were significantly differentially expressed in MPNST  compared with NF, and of these fourteen were downregulated in MPNST: these  included miR-30e*, miR-29c*, miR-29c, miR-340*, miR-30c, miR-139-5p, miR-195,  miR-151-5p, miR-342-5p, miR-146a, miR-150, miR-223, let-7 a and let-7 g with a  false discovery rate of q=8.48E-03 for the least significant miRNA. In contrast,  miR-210 and miR-339-5p were upregulated in MPNST compared with neurofibromas.  Prediction softwares/algorithms identified a list of genes targeted by miR-29c  including extracellular matrix genes and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, all  of which are reported to be involved in cell migration and invasion. Functional  studies in a MPNST cell line, sNF96.2, using a mimic of the mature miR-29c  showed reduced invasion, whereas there was no change in proliferation.  Zymography of the manipulated cells showed that MMP2 activity was also reduced  when miR-29c expression was forced in sNF96.2. CONCLUSION: We provide evidence that reduction of miR-29c has a pivotal role in  the progression of nerve sheath tumours and results by increasing the  invasive/migratory properties of nerve sheath tumours.

Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are predisposed to juvenile  myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), an aggressive myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN)  that is refractory to conventional chemotherapy. Conditional inactivation of the  Nf1 tumor suppressor in hematopoietic cells of mice causes a progressive MPN  that accurately models JMML and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). We  characterized the effects of Nf1 loss on immature hematopoietic populations and  investigated treatment with the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 (hereafter called 901).  Somatic Nf1 inactivation resulted in a marked expansion of immature and  lineage-committed myelo-erythroid progenitors and ineffective erythropoiesis.  Treatment with 901 induced a durable drop in leukocyte counts, enhanced  erythropoietic function, and markedly reduced spleen sizes in mice with MPN. MEK  inhibition also restored a normal pattern of erythroid differentiation and  greatly reduced extramedullary hematopoiesis. Remarkably, genetic analysis  revealed the persistence of Nf1-deficient hematopoietic cells, indicating that  MEK inhibition modulates the proliferation and differentiation of Nf1 mutant  cells in vivo rather than eliminating them. These data provide a rationale for  performing clinical trials of MEK inhibitors in patients with JMML and CMML.

Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are prone to learning and  behavioral abnormalities, including problems with spatial learning and  attention. The molecular etiology for these deficits is unclear, as previous  studies have implicated defective dopamine, cyclic adenosine monophosphate  (cAMP), and Ras homeostasis. Using behavioral, electrophysiological, and primary  culture, we now demonstrate that reduced dopamine signaling is responsible for  cAMP-dependent defects in neuron function and learning. Collectively, these  results establish defective dopaminergic function as a contributing factor  underlying impaired spatial learning and memory in children and adults with NF1,  and support the use of treatments that restore normal dopamine homeostasis for  select individuals.

Cells sense physical properties of their extracellular environment and translate  them into biochemical signals. In this study, cell responses to surfaces with  submicron topographies were investigated in cultured human NF1 haploinsufficient  fibroblasts. Age-matched fibroblasts from 8 patients with neurofibromatosis type  1 (NF1(+/-)) and 9 controls (NF1(+/+)) were cultured on surfaces with grooves of  200 nm height and lateral distance of 2 μm. As cellular response indicator, the  mean cell orientation along microstructured grooves was systematically examined.  The tested NF1 haploinsufficient fibroblasts were significantly less affected by  the topography than those from healthy donors. Incubation of the NF1(+/-)  fibroblasts with the farnesyltransferase inhibitor FTI-277 and other inhibitors  of the neurofibromin pathway ameliorates significantly the cell orientation.  These data indicate that NF1 haploinsufficiency results in an altered response  to specific surface topography in fibroblasts. We suggest a new function of  neurofibromin in the sensoric mechanism to topographies and a partial  mechanosensoric blindness by NF1 haploinsufficiency.

Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, Child and Family Research Institute, University of  British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNST) are rare, hereditary cancers  associated with neurofibromatosis type I. MPNSTs lack effective treatment  options as they often resist chemotherapies and have high rates of disease  recurrence. Aurora kinase A (AURKA) is an emerging target in cancer and an  aurora kinase inhibitor (AKI), termed MLN8237, shows promise against MPNST cell  lines in vitro and in vivo. Here, we test MLN8237 against two primary human  MPNST grown in vivo as xenotransplants and find that treatment results in tumour  cells exiting the cell cycle and undergoing endoreduplication, which cumulates  in stabilized disease. Targeted therapies can often fail in the clinic due to  insufficient knowledge about factors that determine tumour susceptibilities, so  we turned to three MPNST cell-lines to further study and modulate the cellular  responses to AKI. We find that the sensitivity of cell-lines with amplification  of AURKA depends upon the activity of the kinase, which correlates with the  expression of the regulatory gene products TPX2 and HMMR/RHAMM. Silencing of  HMMR/RHAMM, but not TPX2, augments AURKA activity and sensitizes MPNST cells to  AKI. Furthermore, we find that AURKA activity is critical to the propagation and  self-renewal of sphere-enriched MPNST cancer stem-like cells. AKI treatment  significantly reduces the formation of spheroids, attenuates the self-renewal of  spheroid forming cells, and promotes their differentiation. Moreover, silencing  of HMMR/RHAMM is sufficient to endow MPNST cells with an ability to form and  maintain sphere culture. Collectively, our data indicate that AURKA is a  rationale therapeutic target for MPNST and tumour cell responses to AKI, which  include differentiation, are modulated by the abundance of HMMR/RHAMM.

Peyre M(1), Clermont-Taranchon E, Stemmer-Rachamimov A, Kalamarides M.  Author information: (1)AP-HP, Hôpital Beaujon, Service de Neurochirurgie, Clichy, France.  Invasion of the brain parenchyma by a meningioma classified by histological  criteria as World Health Organization (WHO) grade I meningioma, implies that the  tumor has greater likelihood of recurrence and a biological behavior similar to  the more aggressive WHO grade II meningiomas. It is therefore important to  detect microscopic foci of brain invasion during surgery in order to maximize  the resection and/or adapt imaging follow-up. In this study, we tested the  sensitivity of two handheld confocal imaging devices to detect foci of brain  invasion in two types of meningioma mouse models: in a genetically engineered  mouse model and in a syngeneic xenograft model. Confocal imaging offered precise  images of meningothelial and fibroblastic mouse meningiomas as well as malignant  meningiomas, which corresponded exactly to the pathological findings. Imaging  showed a sharp definition of the brain-tumor interface and enabled  identification of embedded nerves and vessels. Importantly, in both mouse models  used in this study, extension of tumor along Virchow-Robin spaces into adjacent  brain was detected by imaging. In conclusion, this novel technique, following  validation in clinical trials, may open new possibilities for use in operating  rooms to influence both decision making during the surgery and planning for  additional treatments.  © 2013 The Authors; Brain Pathology © 2013 International Society of  Neuropathology.

Author information: (1)Department of Tumor Genetics and Biology, Graduate school of Medical  Sciences, Kumamoto University, 1-1-1 Honjo, Chuo-ku, Kumamoto 860-8556, Japan.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor gene product, neurofibromin,  functions in part as a Ras-GAP, and though its loss is implicated in the  neuronal abnormality of NF1 patients, its precise cellular function remains  unclear. To study the molecular mechanism of NF1 pathogenesis, we prepared NF1  gene knockdown (KD) PC12 cells, as a NF1 disease model, and analyzed their  molecular (gene and protein) expression profiles with a unique integrated  proteomics approach, comprising iTRAQ, 2D-DIGE, and DNA microarrays, using an  integrated protein and gene expression analysis chart (iPEACH). In NF1-KD PC12  cells showing abnormal neuronal differentiation after NGF treatment, of 3198  molecules quantitatively identified and listed in iPEACH, 97 molecules  continuously up- or down-regulated over time were extracted. Pathway and network  analysis further revealed overrepresentation of calcium signaling and  transcriptional regulation by glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the up-regulated  protein set, whereas nerve system development was overrepresented in the  down-regulated protein set. The novel up-regulated network we discovered,  ""dynein IC2-GR-COX-1 signaling,"" was then examined in NF1-KD cells. Validation  studies confirmed that NF1 knockdown induces altered splicing and  phosphorylation patterns of dynein IC2 isomers, up-regulation and accumulation  of nuclear GR, and increased COX-1 expression in NGF-treated cells. Moreover,  the neurite retraction phenotype observed in NF1-KD cells was significantly  recovered by knockdown of the dynein IC2-C isoform and COX-1. In addition,  dynein IC2 siRNA significantly inhibited nuclear translocation and accumulation  of GR and up-regulation of COX-1 expression. These results suggest that dynein  IC2 up-regulates GR nuclear translocation and accumulation, and subsequently  causes increased COX-1 expression, in this NF1 disease model. Our integrated  proteomics strategy, which combines multiple approaches, demonstrates that  NF1-related neural abnormalities are, in part, caused by up-regulation of dynein  IC2-GR-COX-1 signaling, which may be a novel therapeutic target for NF1.

Research in understanding the pathogenetic mechanisms of neurofibroma  development has led to the use of new clinical trials for the treatment of NF1.  One of the most important outcomes of a trial is improvement in quality of life,  however, no condition specific HRQOL instrument for NF1 exists. The objective of  this study was to develop an NF1 HRQOL instrument as a module of PedsQL™ and to  test for its initial feasibility, internal consistency reliability and validity  in adults with NF1. METHODS: The NF1 specific HRQOL instrument was developed using a standard method  of PedsQL™ module development - literature review, focus group/semi-structured  interviews, cognitive interviews and experts' review of initial draft, pilot  testing and field testing. Field testing involved 134 adults with NF1.  Feasibility was measured by the percentage of missing responses, internal  consistency reliability was measured with Cronbach's alpha and validity was  measured by the known-groups method. RESULTS: Feasibility, measured by the percentage of missing responses was 4.8%  for all subscales on the adult version of the NF1-specific instrument. Internal  consistency reliability for the Total Score (alpha =0.97) and subscale  reliabilities ranging from 0.72 to 0.96 were acceptable for group comparisons.  The PedsQL™ NF1 module distinguished between NF1 adults with excellent to very  good, good, and fair to poor health status. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the initial feasibility, reliability and  validity of the PedsQL™ NF1 module in adult patients. The PedsQL™ NF1 Module can  be used to understand the multidimensional nature of NF1 on the HRQOL patients  with this disorder.

Using the  human MPNST Schwann cell line ST88-14, we demonstrate that, in addition to a  transient phosphorylation of Akt, PDGF-BB stimulation produces an atypical  sustained phosphorylation of Akt that is dependent on calcium and calmodulin  (CaM). The sustained Akt phosphorylation did not occur in PDGF-BB-stimulated  normal human Schwann cells or ST88-14 cells stimulated with stem cell factor,  whose receptor is also overexpressed in ST88-14 cells. The sustained Akt  phosphorylation induced by PDGF-BB was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells  with either the intracellular calcium chelator  1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl)  ester (BAPTA-AM) or the CaM antagonist W7, whereas the transient portion was not  inhibited. Akt also co-immunoprecipitated with CaM in a PDGF-BB-dependent  manner, suggesting that direct interaction between Akt and CaM is involved in  the sustained phosphorylation of Akt. Furthermore, we provide evidence that  anti-apoptotic effects of PDGF-BB on serum-deprived ST88-14 cells can be  inhibited by W7, implicating the PDGF-BB-induced activation of calcium/CaM in  promoting cell survival, presumably through sustained Akt activation. We  conclude that the activation of the calcium/CaM/Akt pathway resulting from  stimulation of overexpressed PDGF receptor-β may contribute to the survival and  tumorigenicity of MPNST cells.

Genetic changes required for the formation and progression of human Schwann cell  tumors remain elusive. Using a Sleeping Beauty forward genetic screen, we  identified several genes involved in canonical Wnt signaling as potential  drivers of benign neurofibromas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors  (MPNSTs). In human neurofibromas and MPNSTs, activation of Wnt signaling  increased with tumor grade and was associated with downregulation of β-catenin  destruction complex members or overexpression of a ligand that potentiates Wnt  signaling, R-spondin 2 (RSPO2). Induction of Wnt signaling was sufficient to  induce transformed properties in immortalized human Schwann cells, and  downregulation of this pathway was sufficient to reduce the tumorigenic  phenotype of human MPNST cell lines. Small-molecule inhibition of Wnt signaling  effectively reduced the viability of MPNST cell lines and synergistically  induced apoptosis when combined with an mTOR inhibitor, RAD-001, suggesting that  Wnt inhibition represents a novel target for therapeutic intervention in Schwann  cell tumors.

Author information: (1)From the Department of Cancer Biology, The Scripps Research Institute,  Jupiter, Florida 33458.  The p21-activated kinases (PAKs) are immediate downstream effectors of the  Rac/Cdc42 small G-proteins and implicated in promoting tumorigenesis in various  types of cancer including breast and lung carcinomas. Recent studies have  established a requirement for the PAKs in the pathogenesis of Neurofibromatosis  type 2 (NF2), a dominantly inherited cancer disorder caused by mutations at the  NF2 gene locus. Merlin, the protein product of the NF2 gene, has been shown to  negatively regulate signaling through the PAKs and the tumor suppressive  functions of Merlin are mediated, at least in part, through inhibition of the  PAKs. Knockdown of PAK1 and PAK2 expression, through RNAi-based approaches,  impairs the proliferation of NF2-null schwannoma cells in culture and inhibits  their ability to form tumors in vivo. These data implicate the PAKs as potential  therapeutic targets. High-throughput screening of a library of small molecules  combined with a structure-activity relationship approach resulted in the  identification of FRAX597, a small-molecule pyridopyrimidinone, as a potent  inhibitor of the group I PAKs. Crystallographic characterization of the  FRAX597/PAK1 complex identifies a phenyl ring that traverses the gatekeeper  residue and positions the thiazole in the back cavity of the ATP binding site, a  site rarely targeted by kinase inhibitors. FRAX597 inhibits the proliferation of  NF2-deficient schwannoma cells in culture and displayed potent anti-tumor  activity in vivo, impairing schwannoma development in an orthotopic model of  NF2.

BACKGROUND: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are rare highly  aggressive sarcomas that affect 8-13% of people with neurofibromatosis type 1.  The prognosis for patients with MPNST is very poor. Despite TOP2A overexpression  in these tumors, doxorubicin resistance is common, and the mechanisms of  chemotherapy resistance in MPNST are poorly understood. Molecular-guided therapy  prediction is an emerging strategy for treatment refractory sarcomas that  involves identification of therapy response and resistance mechanisms in  individual tumors. Here, we report the results from a personalized,  molecular-guided therapy analysis of MPNST samples. METHODS: Established molecular-guided therapy prediction software algorithms  were used to analyze published microarray data from human MPNST samples and cell  lines, with benign neurofibroma tissue controls. MPNST and benign  neurofibroma-derived cell lines were used for confirmatory in vitro  experimentation using quantitative real-time PCR and growth inhibition assays.  Microarray data was analyzed using Affymetrix expression console MAS 5.0 method.  Significance was calculated with Welch's t-test with non-corrected p-value <  0.05 and validated using permutation testing across samples. Paired Student's  t-tests were used to compare relative EC50 values from independent growth  inhibition experiments. RESULTS: Molecular guided therapy predictions highlight substantial variability  amongst human MPNST samples in expression of drug target and drug resistance  pathways, as well as some similarities amongst samples, including common  up-regulation of DNA repair mechanisms. In a subset of MPNSTs, high expression  of ABCC1 is observed, serving as a predicted contra-indication for doxorubicin  and related therapeutics in these patients. These microarray-based results are  confirmed with quantitative, real-time PCR and immunofluorescence. The  functional effect of drug efflux in MPNST-derived cells is confirmed using in  vitro growth inhibition assays. Alternative therapeutics supported by the  molecular-guided therapy predictions are reported and tested in MPNST-derived  cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the substantial molecular heterogeneity of  MPNSTs and validate molecular-guided therapy predictions in vitro. The observed  molecular heterogeneity in MPNSTs influences therapy prediction. Also,  mechanisms involving drug transport and DNA damage repair are primary mediators  of MPNST chemotherapy resistance. Together, these findings support the utility  of individualized therapy in MPNST as in other sarcomas, and provide initial  proof-of concept that individualized therapy prediction can be accomplished.

The neurofibromatoses (NF)--including neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1),  neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2), and schwannomatosis--are related tumor-suppressor  syndromes characterized by a predisposition to multiple tumor types and other  disease manifestations, which often result in functional disability, reduced  quality of life, pain, and, in some cases, malignancy. With increasing knowledge  of the biology and pathogenesis of NF, clinical trials with targeted agents  directed at NF tumors have become available. Most clinical trials for patients  with NF have used designs and endpoints similar to oncology trials. However,  differences in the disease manifestations and natural history of NF (compared to  cancers) require the development of new designs and endpoints to perform  meaningful NF clinical trials. The Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and  Schwannomatosis (REiNS) International Collaboration was established in 2011 at  the Children's Tumor Foundation meeting to achieve consensus within the NF  community about the design of future clinical trials, with a specific emphasis  on endpoints. The REiNS Collaboration includes 7 working groups that focus on  imaging of tumor response; functional, visual, patient-reported, and  neurocognitive outcomes; whole-body MRI; and disease biomarkers. This supplement  includes the first series of recommendations by the REiNS Collaboration. The  hope is that these recommendations will be used by members of the group and by  researchers outside of the REiNS International Collaboration to standardize the  measurement of outcomes and thus improve clinical trials for patients with NF.  Ultimately, we plan to engage industry partners and national regulatory agencies  in this process to facilitate the approval of drugs for patients with NF.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of the Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and  Schwannomatosis Visual Outcomes Committee is to define the best functional  outcome measures for future neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated optic  pathway glioma (OPG) clinical trials. METHODS: The committee considered the components of vision, other ophthalmologic  parameters affected by OPG, potential biomarkers of visual function, and quality  of life measures to arrive at consensus-based, evidence-driven recommendations  for objective and measurable functional endpoints for OPG trials. RESULTS: Visual acuity (VA) assessments using consistent quantitative testing  methods are recommended as the main functional outcome measure for NF1-OPG  clinical trials. Teller acuity cards are recommended for use as the primary VA  endpoint, and HOTV as a secondary endpoint once subjects are old enough to  complete it. The optic disc should be assessed for pallor, as this appears to be  a contributory variable that may affect the interpretation of VA change over  time. Given the importance of capturing patient-reported outcomes in clinical  trials, evaluating visual quality of life using the Children's Visual Function  Questionnaire as a secondary endpoint is also proposed. CONCLUSIONS: The use of these key functional endpoints will be essential for  evaluating the efficacy of future OPG clinical trials.

OBJECTIVE: Neurofibromatosis (NF)-related benign tumors such as plexiform  neurofibromas (PN) and vestibular schwannomas (VS) can cause substantial  morbidity. Clinical trials directed at these tumors have become available. Due  to differences in disease manifestations and the natural history of NF-related  tumors, response criteria used for solid cancers (1-dimensional/RECIST [Response  Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors] and bidimensional/World Health  Organization) have limited applicability. No standardized response criteria for  benign NF tumors exist. The goal of the Tumor Measurement Working Group of the  REiNS (Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis) committee  is to propose consensus guidelines for the evaluation of imaging response in  clinical trials for NF tumors. METHODS: Currently used imaging endpoints, designs of NF clinical trials, and  knowledge of the natural history of NF-related tumors, in particular PN and VS,  were reviewed. Consensus recommendations for response evaluation for future  studies were developed based on this review and the expertise of group members. RESULTS: MRI with volumetric analysis is recommended to sensitively and  reproducibly evaluate changes in tumor size in clinical trials. Volumetric  analysis requires adherence to specific imaging recommendations. A 20% volume  change was chosen to indicate a decrease or increase in tumor size. Use of these  criteria in future trials will enable meaningful comparison of results across  studies. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed imaging response evaluation guidelines, along with  validated clinical outcome measures, will maximize the ability to identify  potentially active agents for patients with NF and benign tumors.

OBJECTIVES: Neurofibromatosis (NF) is a genetic disease with multiple clinical  manifestations that can significantly impact quality of life (QOL). Clinical  trials should include patient-reported outcomes (PROs) as endpoints to assess  treatment effects on various aspects of QOL, but there is no consensus on the  selection and use of such measures in NF. This article describes the PRO Working  Group of the Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis  (REiNS) Collaboration, its main goals, methods for identifying appropriate PRO  measures for NF clinical trials, and recommendations for assessing pain  intensity. METHODS: The REiNS PRO group selected core endpoint domains important to assess  in NF. The members developed criteria to rate PRO measures, including patient  characteristics, psychometric properties, and feasibility, and utilized a  systematic process to evaluate PROs for NF clinical trials. Within the subdomain  of pain intensity, the group reviewed the Numerical Rating Scale-11 (NRS-11),  the Visual Analogue Scale, and the Faces Pain Scale-Revised using this process. RESULTS: Based on the review criteria, each of these pain intensity scales is  brief, reliable, valid, and widely used. However, the NRS-11 was given the  highest rating for use in NF clinical trials due to recommendations from pain  experts and other consensus groups, its extensive use in research, strong  psychometric data including sensitivity to change, and excellent feasibility in  ages ≥ 8 years. CONCLUSIONS: The systematic review criteria and process are effective for  identifying appropriate PRO measures and provide information utilized by the  REiNS Collaboration to achieve consensus regarding PROs in NF clinical trials.

(#)Contributed equally  The simplicity of programming the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short  palindromic repeats)-associated nuclease Cas9 to modify specific genomic loci  suggests a new way to interrogate gene function on a genome-wide scale. We show  that lentiviral delivery of a genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (GeCKO) library  targeting 18,080 genes with 64,751 unique guide sequences enables both negative  and positive selection screening in human cells. First, we used the GeCKO  library to identify genes essential for cell viability in cancer and pluripotent  stem cells. Next, in a melanoma model, we screened for genes whose loss is  involved in resistance to vemurafenib, a therapeutic RAF inhibitor. Our  highest-ranking candidates include previously validated genes NF1 and MED12, as  well as novel hits NF2, CUL3, TADA2B, and TADA1. We observe a high level of  consistency between independent guide RNAs targeting the same gene and a high  rate of hit confirmation, demonstrating the promise of genome-scale screening  with Cas9.

(#)Contributed equally  Malignant mesothelioma is a highly aggressive, asbestos-related cancer  frequently marked by mutations of both NF2 and CDKN2A. We demonstrate that  germline knockout of one allele of each of these genes causes accelerated onset  and progression of asbestos-induced malignant mesothelioma compared with  asbestos-exposed Nf2(+/-) or wild-type mice. Ascites from some  Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice exhibited large tumor spheroids, and tail vein  injections of malignant mesothelioma cells established from these mice, but not  from Nf2(+/-) or wild-type mice, produced numerous tumors in the lung,  suggesting increased metastatic potential of tumor cells from  Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice. Intraperitoneal injections of malignant mesothelioma  cells derived from Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice into severe combined  immunodeficient mice produced tumors that penetrated the diaphragm and pleural  cavity and harbored increased cancer stem cells (CSC). Malignant mesothelioma  cells from Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice stained positively for CSC markers and  formed CSC spheroids in vitro more efficiently than counterparts from wild-type  mice. Moreover, tumor cells from Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice showed elevated c-Met  expression/activation, which was partly dependent on p53-mediated regulation of  miR-34a and required for tumor migration/invasiveness and maintenance of the CSC  population. Collectively, these studies demonstrate in vivo that inactivation of  Nf2 and Cdkn2a cooperate to drive the development of highly aggressive malignant  mesotheliomas characterized by enhanced tumor spreading capability and the  presence of a CSC population associated with p53/miR-34a-dependent activation of  c-Met. These findings suggest that cooperativity between losses of Nf2 and  Cdkn2a plays a fundamental role in driving the highly aggressive tumorigenic  phenotype considered to be a hallmark of malignant mesothelioma.  ©2013 AACR.

Ann Neurol. 2014 May;75(5):800-1. doi: 10.1002/ana.24156.  OBJECTIVE: Children with neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) are at risk for developing  numerous nervous system abnormalities, including cognitive problems and brain  tumors (optic pathway glioma). Currently, there are few prognostic factors that  predict clinical manifestations or outcomes in patients, even in families with  an identical NF1 gene mutation. In this study, we leveraged Nf1 genetically  engineered mice (GEM) to define the potential role of sex as a clinically  relevant modifier of NF1-associated neuronal dysfunction. METHODS: Deidentified clinical data were analyzed to determine the impact of sex  on optic glioma-associated visual decline in children with NF1. In addition, Nf1  GEM were employed as experimental platforms to investigate sexually dimorphic  differences in learning/memory, visual acuity, retinal ganglion cell (RGC)  death, and Nf1 protein (neurofibromin)-regulated signaling pathway function (Ras  activity, cyclic adenosine monophosphate [cAMP], and dopamine levels). RESULTS: Female patients with NF1-associated optic glioma were twice as likely  to undergo brain magnetic resonance imaging for visual symptoms and 3× more  likely to require treatment for visual decline than their male counterparts. As  such, only female Nf1 GEM exhibited a decrement in optic glioma-associated  visual acuity, shorter RGC axons, and attenuated cAMP levels. In contrast, only  male Nf1 GEM showed spatial learning/memory deficits, increased Ras activity,  and reduced dopamine levels. INTERPRETATION: Collectively, these observations establish sex as a major  prognostic factor underlying neuronal dysfunction in NF1, and suggest that sex  should be considered when interpreting future preclinical and clinical study  results.  © 2014 Child Neurology Society/American Neurological Association.

Author information: (1)Department of Nutritional Science and Toxicology, University of California,  Berkeley, California 94720, USA. vulpe@berkeley.edu.  BACKGROUND: Benzene is an established human leukemogen, with a ubiquitous  environmental presence leading to significant population exposure. In a  genome-wide functional screen in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae,  inactivation of IRA2, a yeast ortholog of the human tumor suppressor gene NF1  (Neurofibromin), enhanced sensitivity to hydroquinone, an important benzene  metabolite. Increased Ras signaling is implicated as a causal factor in the  increased pre-disposition to leukemia of individuals with mutations in NF1. METHODS: Growth inhibition of yeast by hydroquinone was assessed in mutant  strains exhibiting varying levels of Ras activity. Subsequently, effects of  hydroquinone on both genotoxicity (measured by micronucleus formation) and  proliferation of WT and Nf1 null murine hematopoietic precursors were assessed. RESULTS: Here we show that the Ras status of both yeast and mammalian cells  modulates hydroquinone toxicity, indicating potential synergy between Ras  signaling and benzene toxicity. Specifically, enhanced Ras signaling increases  both hydroquinone-mediated growth inhibition in yeast and genotoxicity in  mammalian hematopoetic precursors as measured by an in vitro erythroid  micronucleus assay. Hydroquinone also increases proliferation of CFU-GM  progenitor cells in mice with Nf1 null bone marrow relative to WT, the same cell  type associated with benzene-associated leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Together our findings show that hydroquinone toxicity is modulated  by Ras signaling. Individuals with abnormal Ras signaling could be more  vulnerable to developing myeloid diseases after exposure to benzene. We note  that hydroquinone is used cosmetically as a skin-bleaching agent, including by  individuals with cafe-au-lait spots (which may be present in individuals with  neurofibromatosis who have a mutation in NF1), which could be unadvisable given  our findings.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic  disorder, resulting in a variety of neural tumors, with bilateral vestibular  schwannomas as the most frequent manifestation. Recently, merlin, the NF2 tumor  suppressor, has been identified as a novel negative regulator of mammalian  target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1); functional loss of merlin was shown to  result in elevated mTORC1 signaling in NF2-related tumors. Thus, mTORC1 pathway  inhibition may be a useful targeted therapeutic approach. METHODS: We studied in vitro cell models, cohorts of mice allografted with  Nf2(-/-) Schwann cells, and a genetically modified mouse model of NF2 schwannoma  in order to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed targeted therapy for NF2. RESULTS: We found that treatment with the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin reduced the  severity of NF2-related Schwann cell tumorigenesis without significant toxicity.  Consistent with these results, in an NF2 patient with growing vestibular  schwannomas, the rapalog sirolimus induced tumor growth arrest. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results constitute definitive evidence that  justifies proceeding with clinical trials using mTORC1-targeted agents in  selected patients with NF2 and in patients with NF2-related sporadic tumors.

Here, using a fluorescence  resonance energy transfer/fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy-based Ras  imaging technique in combination with 2-photon glutamate uncaging, we show that  neurofibromin, in which loss-of-function mutations cause Neurofibromatosis Type  1 (NF1), contributes to the majority (∼90%) of Ras inactivation in dendritic  spines of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus. Loss of  neurofibromin causes sustained Ras activation in spines, which leads to  impairment of spine structural plasticity and loss of spines in an  activity-dependent manner. Therefore, deregulation of postsynaptic Ras signaling  may explain, at least in part, learning disabilities associated with NF1.

Bone fragility due to osteopenia, osteoporosis or debilitating focal skeletal  dysplasias is a frequent observation in the Mendelian disease Neurofibromatosis  type 1 (NF1). To determine the mechanisms underlying bone fragility in NF1 we  analyzed two conditional mouse models, Nf1Prx1 (limb knock-out) and Nf1Col1  (osteoblast specific knock-out), as well as cortical bone samples from  individuals with NF1. We examined mouse bone tissue with micro-computed  tomography, qualitative and quantitative histology, mechanical tensile analysis,  small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX),  and scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM). In cortical bone of Nf1Prx1 mice we  detected ectopic blood vessels that were associated with diaphyseal  mineralization defects. Defective mineral binding in the proximity of blood  vessels was most likely due to impaired bone collagen formation, as these areas  were completely devoid of acidic matrix proteins and contained thin collagen  fibers. Additionally, we found significantly reduced mechanical strength of the  bone material, which was partially caused by increased osteocyte volume.  Consistent with these observations, bone samples from individuals with NF1 and  tibial dysplasia showed increased osteocyte lacuna volume. Reduced mechanical  properties were associated with diminished matrix stiffness, as determined by  SAM. In line with these observations, bone tissue from individuals with NF1 and  tibial dysplasia showed heterogeneous mineralization and reduced collagen fiber  thickness and packaging. Collectively, the data indicate that bone fragility in  NF1 tibial dysplasia is partly due to an increased osteocyte-related  micro-porosity, hypomineralization, a generalized defect of organic matrix  formation, exacerbated in the regions of tensional and bending force  integration, and finally persistence of ectopic blood vessels associated with  localized macro-porotic bone lesions.

BACKGROUNDS: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are an aggressive  and often lethal sarcoma that frequently develops in patients with  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). We developed new preclinical MPNST models and  tested the efficacy of oncolytic herpes simplex viruses (oHSVs), a promising  cancer therapeutic that selectively replicates in and kills cancer cells. METHODS: Mouse NF1(-) MPNST cell lines and human NF1(-) MPNST stemlike cells  (MSLCs) were implanted into the sciatic nerves of immunocompetent and athymic  mice, respectively. Tumor growth was followed by external measurement and  sciatic nerve deficit using a hind-limb scoring system. Oncolytic HSV G47Δ as  well as ""armed"" G47Δ expressing platelet factor 4 (PF4) or interleukin (IL)-12  were injected intratumorally into established sciatic nerve tumors. RESULTS: Mouse MPNST cell lines formed tumors with varying growth kinetics. A  single intratumoral injection of G47Δ in sciatic nerve tumors derived from human  S462 MSLCs in athymic mice or mouse M2 (37-3-18-4) cells in immunocompetent mice  significantly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival. Local IL-12  expression significantly improved the efficacy of G47Δ in syngeneic mice, while  PF4 expression prolonged survival. Injection of G47Δ directly into the sciatic  nerve of athymic mice resulted in only mild symptoms that did not differ from  phosphate buffered saline control. CONCLUSIONS: Two new orthotopic MPNST models are described, including in  syngeneic mice, expanding the options for preclinical testing. Oncolytic HSV  G47Δ exhibited robust efficacy in both immunodeficient and immunocompetent MPNST  models while maintaining safety. Interleukin-12 expression improved efficacy.  These studies support the clinical translation of G47Δ for patients with MPNST.  © The Author(s) 2014. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the  Society for Neuro-Oncology.

Comment in     Neuro Oncol. 2014 May;16(5):617-8. doi: 10.1093/neuonc/nou050.  BACKGROUND: RAS is dysregulated in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) related  plexiform neurofibromas (PNs). The activity of tipifarnib, which blocks RAS  signaling by inhibiting its farnesylation, was tested in children and young  adults with NF1 and progressive PNs. METHODS: Patients aged 3-25 years with NF1-related PNs and imaging evidence of  tumor progression were randomized in a double-blinded fashion to receive  tipifarnib (200 mg/m(2) orally every 12 h) or placebo (phase A) and crossed over  to the opposite treatment arm at the time of tumor progression (phase B). PN  volumes were measured with MRI, and progression was defined as ≥20% volume  increase. Time to progression (TTP) in phase A was the primary endpoint, and the  trial was powered to detect whether tipifarnib doubled TTP compared with  placebo. Toxicity, response, and quality of life were also monitored. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were enrolled. Tipifarnib and placebo were well  tolerated. On phase A, the median TTP was 10.6 months on the placebo arm and  19.2 months on the tipifarnib arm (P = .12; 1-sided). Quality of life improved  significantly compared with baseline on the tipifarnib arm but not on the  placebo arm. Volumetric tumor measurement detected tumor progression earlier  than conventional 2-dimensional (WHO) and 1-dimensional (RECIST) methods. CONCLUSIONS: Tipifarnib was well tolerated but did not significantly prolong TTP  of PNs compared with placebo. The randomized, flexible crossover design and  volumetric PN assessment provided a feasible and efficient means of assessing  the efficacy of tipifarnib. The placebo arm serves as an historical control  group for phase 2 single-arm trials directed at progressive PNs.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the expression levels of the  tumor suppressor WOX1 in nervous system tumors and its co-expression with p53  and neurofibromatosis type 2/merlin (NF2) tumor suppressor gene products. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry, western blotting and in situ hybridization were  used for WOX1 protein and WWOX mRNA expression. Immunofluorescence and electron  microscopical immunohistochemistry were performed for colocalization of gene  products. RESULTS: WOX1 expression is low in normal cortical neurons, mainly on the axon  fibers, whereas there is moderate to high immunoreactivity in the cytosol and  nuclei of certain tumor cells. In the microcystic (WHO grade I) and malignant  (WHO grade III) meningiomas, WOX1 expression is intense, but various in  transitional (WHO grade I) and atypical (WHO grade II) subtypes. WOX1 levels are  moderate to high in the menigiotheliomatous area, but relatively low in the  fibroblastic area. WOX1 and NF2/merlin, but not p53, colocalized in certain  tumor cells, primarily at the borders of nuclei. Schwannoma and astrocytoma  specimens stained moderately to strongly positive for the WOX1 protein.  Interestingly, the expression of WOX1, NF2/merlin and mutant p53 is intense in  high grade glioblastoma, but WOX1 expression is low in metastatic carcinoma or  adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of WOX1 on different types of nervous system tumors,  including primary and metastatic tumors, is differential.

Alternative splicing is an important regulator of the transcriptome. However,  mutations may cause alteration of splicing patterns, which in turn leads to  disease. During the past 10 years, exon skipping has been looked upon as a  powerful tool for correction of missplicing in disease and progress has been  made towards clinical trials. In this review, we discuss the use of antisense  oligonucleotides to correct splicing defects through exon skipping, with a  special focus on diseases affecting the nervous system, and the latest stage  achieved in its progress.

Mutations in the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor gene are common  in cancer and can cause resistance to therapy. Using transcriptome analysis we  identified MAF as an NF1- regulated transcription factor and verified MAF  regulation through RAS/MAPK/AP-1 signaling in malignant peripheral nerve sheath  tumor (MPNST) cell lines. MAF was also downregulated in human MPNST. Acute  re-expression of MAF promoted expression of glial differentiation markers in  MPNST cells in vitro, decreased self-renewal of embryonic precursors and  transiently affected tumor cell phenotypes in vitro by increasing MPNST cell  death and reducing metabolic activity and anchorage-independent growth.  Paradoxically, chronic MAF overexpression enhanced MPNST cell tumor growth in  vivo, correlating with elevated pS6 in vitro and in vivo. RAD001 blocked  MAF-mediated tumor growth, and MAF regulated the mTOR pathway through DEPTOR.  MAPK inhibition with NF1 loss of function is predicted to show limited efficacy  due to reactivation of mTOR signaling via MAF.

BACKGROUND: Inactivation of the NF2 gene predisposes to neurofibromatosis type  II and the development of schwannomas. In vitro studies have shown that loss of  NF2 leads to the induction of mitogenic signaling mediated by receptor tyrosine  kinases (RTKs), MAP kinase, AKT, or Hippo pathways. The goal of our study was to  evaluate the expression and activity of these signaling pathways in human  schwannomas in order to identify new potential therapeutic targets. METHODS: Large sets of human schwannomas, totaling 68 tumors, were analyzed  using complementary proteomic approaches. RTK arrays identified the most  frequently activated RTKs. The correlation between the expression and activity  of signaling pathways and proliferation of tumor cells using Ki67 marker was  investigated by reverse-phase protein array (RRPA). Finally,  immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the expression pattern of signaling  effectors in the tumors. RESULTS: We showed that Her2, Her3, PDGFRß, Axl, and Tie2 are frequently  activated in the tumors. Furthermore, RRPA demonstrated that Ki67 levels are  linked to YAP, p-Her3, and PDGFRß expression levels. In addition, Her2, Her3,  and PDGFRß are transcriptional targets of Yes-associated protein (YAP) in  schwannoma cells in culture. Finally, we observed that the expression of these  signaling effectors is very variable between tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor cell proliferation in human schwannomas is linked to a  signaling network controlled by the Hippo effector YAP. Her2, Her3, PDGFRß, Axl,  and Tie2, as well as YAP, represent potentially valuable therapeutic targets.  However, the variability of their expression between tumors may result in strong  differences in the response to targeted therapy.  © The Author(s) 2014.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) affects several areas of cognitive  function including visual processing and attention. We investigated the neural  mechanisms underlying the visual deficits of children and adolescents with NF1  by studying visual evoked potentials (VEPs) and brain oscillations during visual  stimulation and rest periods. METHODS: Electroencephalogram/event-related potential (EEG/ERP) responses were  measured during visual processing (NF1 n = 17; controls n = 19) and idle periods  with eyes closed and eyes open (NF1 n = 12; controls n = 14). Visual stimulation  was chosen to bias activation of the three detection mechanisms: achromatic,  red-green and blue-yellow. RESULTS: We found significant differences between the groups for late chromatic  VEPs and a specific enhancement in the amplitude of the parieto-occipital alpha  amplitude both during visual stimulation and idle periods. Alpha modulation and  the negative influence of alpha oscillations in visual performance were found in  both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest abnormal later stages of visual processing and  enhanced amplitude of alpha oscillations supporting the existence of deficits in  basic sensory processing in NF1. Given the link between alpha oscillations,  visual perception and attention, these results indicate a neural mechanism that  might underlie the visual sensitivity deficits and increased lapses of attention  observed in individuals with NF1.

Perosio PM(1), Brooks JJ.  Author information: (1)Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hospital of the University  of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 19104.  Identification of growth factors and receptors in mesenchymal tumors may be  crucial to understanding of growth regulation in sarcomas. During an  immunohistochemical study of the expression of growth factors and receptors in  human soft tissue tumors (STT), only 1 antisera capable of working in  paraffin-embedded tissue was noted. A detailed study of 141 STT was undertaken  to determine the frequency of expression of nerve growth factor receptor  (NGF-R), its specificity and sensitivity for neural tumors, and the effect of  fixation on detection. In normal mesenchymal tissue, only nerve sheath and  perivascular staining was seen. No immunoreactivity was seen in many tumors  including rhabdomyosarcoma, angiosarcoma, liposarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and  alveolar soft part sarcoma. Less than 15% of tumors of smooth muscle, fibrous,  or fibrohistiocytic origin showed immunoreactivity, usually focal. In contrast,  a high frequency of immunoreactivity was noted in tumors of neural origin (74%).  This included granular cell tumors (100%), Schwannoma/neurofibroma (91%),  malignant Schwannoma (78%), neuroblastoma/neuroepithelioma (60%), and  paraganglioma (57%). A high rate of reactivity was also seen in synovial  sarcomas (80%), undifferentiated sarcomas (60%), and hemangiopericytomas (43%),  suggesting a potential relationship to the neural phenotype. Among the neural  tumors, Bouin's fixation was superior to formalin, suggesting that  immunoreactivity for NGF-R is affected by fixation. This antibody may be a  useful adjunct marker diagnostically.  PMCID: PMC1880630 PMID: 2456020 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",True,Parse error - defaulted to include

The proper control of tissue growth is essential during normal development and  an important problem in human disease. Merlin, the product of the  Neurofibromatosis 2 tumor suppressor gene, has been extensively studied to  understand its functions in growth control. Here we describe experiments in  which we used Drosophila as an in vivo system to test the functions of the  normal human NF2 gene products and patient-derived mutant alleles. Although the  predominant NF2 gene isoform, isoform 1, could functionally replace the  Drosophila Merlin gene, a second isoform with a distinct C-terminal tail could  not. Immunofluorescence studies show that the two isoforms have distinct  subcellular localizations when expressed in the polarized imaginal epithelium,  and function in genetic rescue assays correlates with apical localization of the  NF2 protein. Interestingly, we found that a patient-derived missense allele,  NF2L64P, appears to be temperature sensitive. These studies highlight the  utility of Drosophila for in vivo functional analysis of highly conserved human  disease genes.

Author information: (1)National Neurofibromatosis 2 Service, England, UK, rosalie.ferner@kcl.ac.uk.  Advances in molecular biology have resulted in novel therapy for  neurofibromatosis 2-related (NF2) tumours, highlighting the need for robust  outcome measures. The disease-focused NF2 impact on quality of life (NFTI-QOL)  patient questionnaire was assessed as an outcome measure for treatment in a  multi-centre study. NFTI-QOL was related to clinician-rated severity (ClinSev)  and genetic severity (GenSev) over repeated visits. Data were evaluated for 288  NF2 patients (n = 464 visits) attending the English national NF2 clinics from  2010 to 2012. The male-to-female ratio was equal and the mean age was 42.2 (SD  17.8) years. The analysis included NFTI-QOL eight-item score, ClinSev graded as  mild, moderate, or severe, and GenSev as a rank order of the number of NF2  mutations (graded as mild, moderate, severe). The mean (SD) 8.7 (5.4) score for  NFTI-QOL for either a first visit or all visits 9.2 (5.4) was similar to the  published norm of 9.4 (5.5), with no significant relationships with age or  gender. NFTI-QOL internal reliability was good, with a Cronbach's alpha score of  0.85 and test re-test reliability r = 0.84. NFTI related to ClinSev (r = 0.41, p  < 0.001; r = 0.46 for all visits), but weakly to GenSev (r = 0.16, p < 0.05; r =  0.15 for all visits). ClinSev related to GenSev (r = 0.41, p < 0.001; r = 0.42  for all visits). NFTI-QOL showed a good reliability and ability to detect  significant longitudinal changes in the QOL of individuals. The moderate  relationships of NFTI-QOL with clinician- and genetic-rated severity suggest  that NFTI-QOL taps into NF2 patient experiences that are not encompassed by  ClinSev rating or genotype.

Author information: (1)Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 syndrome (NF1) is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene.  Availability of new sequencing technology prompted us to search for an  alternative method for NF1 mutation analysis. Genomic DNA was isolated from  saliva avoiding invasive sampling. The NF1 exons with an additional 50bp of  flanking intronic sequences were captured and enriched using the SeqCap EZ  Choice Library protocol. The captured DNA was sequenced with the Roche/454 GS  Junior system. The mean coverages of the targeted regions were 41x and 74x in 2  separate sets of samples. An NF1 mutation was discovered in 10 out of 16  separate patient samples. Our study provides proof of principle that the  sequence capture methodology combined with high-throughput sequencing is  applicable to NF1 mutation analysis. Deep intronic mutations may however remain  undetectable, and change at the DNA level may not predict the outcome at the  mRNA or protein levels.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are soft tissue sarcomas that  occur spontaneously, or from benign plexiform neurofibromas, in the context of  the genetic disorder Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1). The current standard  treatment includes surgical resection, high-dose chemotherapy, and/or radiation.  To date, most targeted therapies have failed to demonstrate effectiveness  against plexiform neurofibromas and MPNSTs. Recently, several studies suggested  that the mTOR and MAPK pathways are involved in the formation and progression of  MPNSTs. Everolimus (RAD001) inhibits the mTOR and is currently FDA approved for  several types of solid tumors. PD-0325901 (PD-901) inhibits MEK, a component of  the MAPK pathway, and is currently in clinical trials. Here, we show in vitro  than MPNST cell lines are more sensitive to inhibition of cellular growth by  Everolimus and PD-901 than immortalized human Schwann cells. In combination,  these drugs synergistically inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis. In two  genetically engineered mouse models of MPNST formation, modeling both sporadic  and NF1-associated MPNSTs, Everolimus, or PD-901 treatment alone each  transiently reduced tumor burden and size, and extended lifespan. However,  prolonged treatment of each single agent resulted in the development of  resistance and reactivation of target pathways. Combination therapy using  Everolimus and PD-901 had synergistic effects on reducing tumor burden and size,  and increased lifespan. Combination therapy allowed persistent and prolonged  reduction in signaling through both pathways. These data suggest that  co-targeting mTOR and MEK may be effective in patients with sporadic or  NF1-associated MPNSTs.

Yet, the role of this pathway in gliomagenesis remains  controversial because of the lack of relevant animal models. Using the  cytokeratin 5 promoter, we ectopically expressed a constitutively active  zebrafish Smoothened (Smoa1) in neural progenitor cells and analyzed tumorigenic  capacity of activated Shh signaling in both transient and stable transgenic  fish. Transient transgenic fish overexpressing Smoa1 developed retinal and brain  tumors, suggesting smoa1 is oncogenic in the zebrafish central nervous system  (CNS). We further established stable transgenic lines that simultaneously  developed optic pathway glioma (OPG) and various retinal tumors. In one of these  lines, up to 80% of F1 and F2 fish developed tumors within 1 year of age.  Microarray analysis of tumor samples showed upregulated expression of genes  involved in the cell cycle, cancer signaling and Shh downstream targets ptc1,  gli1 and gli2a. Tumors also exhibited specific gene signatures characteristic of  radial glia and progenitor cells as transcriptions of radial glia genes  cyp19a1b, s100β, blbp, gfap and the stem/progenitor genes nestin and sox2 were  significantly upregulated. Overexpression of GFAP, S100β, BLBP and Sox2 was  confirmed by immunofluorescence. We also detected overexpression of Mdm2  throughout the optic pathway in fish with OPG, therefore implicating the  Mdm2-Tp53 pathway in glioma pathogenesis. In conclusion, we demonstrate that  activated Shh signaling initiates tumorigenesis in the zebrafish CNS and provide  the first OPG model not associated with neurofibromatosis 1.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular malformations have a higher incidence in patients  with NF1 microdeletion syndrome compared to NF1 patients with intragenic  mutation, presumably owing to haploinsufficiency of one or more genes included  in the deletion interval and involved in heart development. In order to identify  which genes could be responsible for cardiovascular malformations in the deleted  patients, we carried out expression studies in mouse embryos and functional  studies in zebrafish. METHODS AND RESULTS: The expression analysis of three candidate genes included  in the NF1 deletion interval, ADAP2, SUZ12 and UTP6, performed by in situ  hybridisation, showed the expression of ADAP2 murine ortholog in heart during  fundamental phases of cardiac morphogenesis. In order to investigate the role of  ADAP2 in cardiac development, we performed loss-of-function experiments of  zebrafish ADAP2 ortholog, adap2, by injecting two different morpholino oligos  (adap2-MO and UTR-adap2-MO). adap2-MOs-injected embryos (morphants) displayed in  vivo circulatory and heart shape defects. The molecular characterisation of  morphants with cardiac specific markers showed that the injection of adap2-MOs  causes defects in heart jogging and looping. Additionally, morphological and  molecular analysis of adap2 morphants demonstrated that the loss of adap2  function leads to defective valvulogenesis, suggesting a correlation between  ADAP2 haploinsufficiency and the occurrence of valve defects in NF1-microdeleted  patients. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings indicate that ADAP2 has a role in heart  development, and might be a reliable candidate gene for the occurrence of  cardiovascular malformations in patients with NF1 microdeletion and, more  generally, for the occurrence of a subset of congenital heart defects.

Author information: (1)The Centre for Children's Bone Health, Sydney Children's Hospital Network,  Sydney, Australia; Discipline of Paediatrics and Child Health, Faculty of  Medicine, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.  Spinal pseudarthrosis is a well described complication of spine fusion surgery  in NF1 patients. Reduced bone formation and excessive resorption have been  described in NF1 and anti-resorptive agents may be advantageous in these  individuals. In this study, 16 wild type and 16 Nf1(+/-) mice were subjected to  posterolateral fusion using collagen sponges containing 5 µg rhBMP-2 introduced  bilaterally. Mice were dosed twice weekly with 0.02 mg/kg zoledronic acid (ZA)  or sterile saline. The fusion mass was assessed for bone volume (BV) and bone  mineral density (BMD) by microCT. Co-treatment using rhBMP-2 and ZA produced a  significant increase (p < 0.01) in BV of the fusion mass compared to rhBMP-2  alone in both wild type mice (+229%) and Nf1(+/-) mice (+174%). Co-treatment  also produced a significantly higher total BMD of the fusion mass compared to  rhBMP-2 alone in both groups (p < 0.01). Despite these gains with  anti-resorptive treatment, Nf1(+/-) deficient mice still generated less bone  than wild type controls. TRAP staining on histological sections indicated an  increased osteoclast surface/bone surface (Oc.S/BS) in Nf1(+/-) mice relative to  wild type mice, and this was reduced with ZA treatment.  © 2014 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Electronic address:  F-Giancotti@ski.mskcc.org.  The FERM domain protein Merlin, encoded by the NF2 tumor suppressor gene,  regulates cell proliferation in response to adhesive signaling. The growth  inhibitory function of Merlin is induced by intercellular adhesion and  inactivated by joint integrin/receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. Merlin  contributes to the formation of cell junctions in polarized tissues, activates  anti-mitogenic signaling at tight-junctions, and inhibits oncogenic gene  expression. Thus, inactivation of Merlin causes uncontrolled mitogenic signaling  and tumorigenesis. Merlin's predominant tumor suppressive functions are  attributable to its control of oncogenic gene expression through regulation of  Hippo signaling. Notably, Merlin translocates to the nucleus where it directly  inhibits the CRL4(DCAF1) E3 ubiquitin ligase, thereby suppressing inhibition of  the Lats kinases. A dichotomy in NF2 function has emerged whereby Merlin acts at  the cell cortex to organize cell junctions and propagate anti-mitogenic  signaling, whereas it inhibits oncogenic gene expression through the inhibition  of CRL4(DCAF1) and activation of Hippo signaling. The biochemical events  underlying Merlin's normal function and tumor suppressive activity will be  discussed in this Review, with emphasis on recent discoveries that have greatly  influenced our understanding of Merlin biology.

Author information: (1)Pediatric Oncology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.  BACKGROUND: Pirfenidone, an oral anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic agent with  activity in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, may mediate anti-tumor activity in  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and plexiform neurofibromas (PN) by inhibition of  fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis. The primary objective of this  open label, single arm phase II trial was to evaluate the activity of  pirfenidone in children and young adults with inoperable PN. PROCEDURE: Patients (3-21 years) with NF1-related progressive PN received  pirfenidone at the previously determined optimal dose (500 mg/m(2) orally, q8h)  on a continuous dosing schedule (one cycle = 28 days). Volumetric MRI analysis  was used to assess response. Progression was defined as ≥ 20% PN volume increase  compared to baseline. Pirfenidone would be considered active if it doubled the  median time to progression (TTP) compared to the TTP on the placebo arm of a  phase II trial with the farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib, which used  near identical eligibility criteria. Toxicities, objective response rate, and  quality of life (QOL) also were evaluated. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were enrolled and tolerated pirfenidone well with  intermittent nausea and vomiting as the most frequent toxicities. A dose  reduction was required in only three patients. The median TTP for pirfenidone  was 13.2 months compared to 10.6 months for the placebo control group from the  tipifarnib trial (two-tailed P = 0.92; one-tailed P = 0.46). No objective  responses were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Pirfenidone was well tolerated, but did not demonstrate activity as  defined in this trial and does not warrant further evaluation in children with  NF1 and progressive PN.  © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

OBJECTIVE: Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is overexpressed in serous ovarian  cancer. Loss of merlin, a product of the neurofibromatosis 2 tumor suppressor  gene, is being evaluated as a biomarker for FAK inhibitor sensitivity in  mesothelioma. Connections between merlin and FAK in ovarian cancer remain  undefined. METHODS: Nine human and two murine ovarian cancer cell lines were analyzed for  growth in the presence of a small molecule FAK inhibitor (PF-271, also termed  VS-6062) from 0.1 to 1 μM for 72 h. Merlin was evaluated by immunoblotting and  immunostaining of a human ovarian tumor tissue array. Growth of cells was  analyzed in an orthotopic tumor model and evaluated in vitro after stable  shRNA-mediated merlin knockdown. RESULTS: Greater than 50% inhibition of OVCAR8, HEY, and ID8-IP ovarian  carcinoma cell growth occurred with 0.1 μM PF-271 in anchorage-independent  (p<0.001) but not in adherent culture conditions. PF-271-mediated reduction in  FAK Y397 phosphorylation occurred independently of growth inhibition. Suspended  growth of OVCAR3, OVCAR10, IGROV1, IGROV1-IP, SKOV3, SKOV3-IP, A2780, and  5009-MOVCAR was not affected by 0.1 μM PF-271. Merlin expression did not  correlate with serous ovarian tumor grade or stage. PF-271 (30 mg/kg, BID) did  not inhibit 5009-MOVCAR tumor growth and merlin knockdown in SKOV3-IP and  OVCAR10 cells did not alter suspended cell growth upon PF-271 addition. CONCLUSIONS: Differential responsiveness to FAK inhibitor treatment was  observed. Intrinsic low merlin protein level correlated with PF-271-mediated  anchorage-independent growth inhibition, but reduction in merlin expression did  not induce sensitivity to FAK inhibition. Merlin levels may be useful for  patient stratification in FAK inhibitor trials.  Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Somatic mosaicism represents the coexistence of two or more cell populations  with different genotypes in one person, and it is involved in >30 monogenic  disorders. Somatic mosaicism characterizes approximately 25% to 33% of patients  with de novo neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). The identification of mosaicism is  crucial to patients and their families because the clinical course of the  disease and its transmission risk is influenced by the degree and distribution  of mutated cells. Moreover, in NF2, the capability of discriminating patients  with mosaicism is especially important to make differential diagnosis with  schwannomatosis. However, the identification of mosaic variants is considerably  difficult, and the development of specific molecular techniques to detect low  levels of unknown molecular alterations is required. Co-amplification at lower  denaturation temperature (COLD)-PCR has been described as a powerful method to  selectively amplify minority alleles from mixtures of wild-type and  mutation-containing sequences. Here, we applied COLD-PCR to molecular analysis  of patients with NF2 mosaicism. With the use of COLD-PCR, followed by direct  sequencing, we were able to detect NF2 mutations in blood DNA of three patients  with NF2 mosaicism. Our study has shown the capability of COLD-PCR in enriching  low-represented mutated allele in blood DNA sample, making it usable for  molecular diagnosis of patients with mosaicism.

Garcia C(1), Gutmann DH(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis,  Missouri, United States of America.  OBJECTIVE: Individuals with the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) cancer  predisposition syndrome develop spinal cord glial tumors (ependymomas) that  likely originate from neural progenitor cells. Whereas many spinal ependymomas  exhibit indolent behavior, the only treatment option for clinically symptomatic  tumors is surgery. In this regard, medical therapies are unfortunately lacking  due to an incomplete understanding of the critical growth control pathways that  govern the function of spinal cord (SC) neural progenitor cells (NPCs). METHODS: To identify potential therapeutic targets for these tumors, we  leveraged primary mouse Nf2-deficient spinal cord neural progenitor cells. RESULTS: We demonstrate that the Nf2 protein, merlin, negatively regulates  spinal neural progenitor cell survival and glial differentiation in an  ErbB2-dependent manner, and that NF2-associated spinal ependymomas exhibit  increased ErbB2 activation. Moreover, we show that Nf2-deficient SC NPC ErbB2  activation results from Rac1-mediated ErbB2 retention at the plasma membrane. SIGNIFICANCE: Collectively, these findings establish ErbB2 as a potential  rational therapeutic target for NF2-associated spinal ependymoma.

Erratum in     PLoS One. 2015 Aug 27;10(8):e0137153. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0137153.  Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive Schwann  cell-derived sarcomas and are the leading cause of mortality in patients with  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Current treatment modalities have been largely  ineffective, resulting in a high rate of MPNST recurrence and poor five-year  patient survival. This necessitates the exploration of alternative  chemotherapeutic options for MPNST patients. This study sought to assess the  cytotoxic effect of the BH3-mimetic AT101 [(-)-gossypol] on MPNST cells in vitro  and to identify key regulators of AT101-induced MPNST cell death. We found that  AT101 caused caspase-independent, non-apoptotic MPNST cell death, which was  accompanied by autophagy and was mediated through HIF-1α induced expression of  the atypical BH3-only protein BNIP3. These effects were mediated by  intracellular iron chelation, a previously unreported mechanism of AT101  cytotoxicity.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are genetically diverse,  aggressive sarcomas that occur sporadically or in association with  neurofibromatosis type 1 syndrome. Reduced TP53 gene expression and  amplification/overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene  occur in MPNST formation. We focused on determining the cooperativity between  reduced TP53 expression and EGFR overexpression for Schwann cell transformation  in vitro (immortalized human Schwann cells) and MPNST formation in vivo  (transgenic mice). Human gene copy number alteration data, microarray expression  data, and TMA analysis indicate that TP53 haploinsufficiency and increased EGFR  expression co-occur in human MPNST samples. Concurrent modulation of EGFR and  TP53 expression in HSC1λ cells significantly increased proliferation and  anchorage-independent growth in vitro. Transgenic mice heterozygous for a  Trp53-null allele and overexpressing EGFR in Schwann cells had a significant  increase in neurofibroma and grade 3 PNST (MPNST) formation compared with single  transgenic controls. Histological analysis of tumors identified a significant  increase in pAkt expression in grade 3 PNSTs compared with neurofibromas. Array  comparative genome hybridization analysis of grade 3 PNSTs identified recurrent  focal regions of chromosomal gains with significant enrichment in genes involved  in extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 signaling. Collectively, altered p53  expression cooperates with overexpression of EGFR in Schwann cells to enhance in  vitro oncogenic properties and tumorigenesis and progression in vivo.

In a diverse panel of cancer cell lines, we  found that the cells most sensitive to focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibition  lack expression of the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene  product, Merlin. Merlin expression is often lost in malignant pleural  mesothelioma (MPM), an asbestos-induced aggressive cancer with limited treatment  options. Our data demonstrate that low Merlin expression predicts for increased  sensitivity of MPM cells to a FAK inhibitor, VS-4718, in vitro and in tumor  xenograft models. Disruption of MPM cell-cell or cell-extracellular matrix (ECM)  contacts with blocking antibodies suggests that weak cell-cell adhesions in  Merlin-negative MPM cells underlie their greater dependence on cell-ECM-induced  FAK signaling. This provides one explanation of why Merlin-negative cells are  vulnerable to FAK inhibitor treatment. Furthermore, we validated aldehyde  dehydrogenase as a marker of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in MPM, a cell population  thought to mediate tumor relapse after chemotherapy. Whereas pemetrexed and  cisplatin, standard-of-care agents for MPM, enrich for CSCs, FAK inhibitor  treatment preferentially eliminates these cells. These preclinical results  provide the rationale for a clinical trial in MPM patients using a FAK inhibitor  as a single agent after first-line chemotherapy. With this design, the FAK  inhibitor could potentially induce a more durable clinical response through  reduction of CSCs along with a strong antitumor effect. Furthermore, our data  suggest that patients with Merlin-negative tumors may especially benefit from  FAK inhibitor treatment.  Copyright © 2014, American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Electronic address: zbu@ccny.cuny.edu.  The tumor suppressor protein Merlin inhibits cell proliferation upon  establishing cell-cell contacts. Because Merlin has high level of sequence  similarity to the Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin family of proteins, the structural model  of Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin protein autoinhibition and cycling between  closed/resting and open/active conformational states is often employed to  explain Merlin function. However, recent biochemical studies suggest alternative  molecular models of Merlin function. Here, we have determined the low-resolution  molecular structure and binding activity of Merlin and a Merlin(S518D) mutant  that mimics the inactivating phosphorylation at S518 using small-angle neutron  scattering and binding experiments. Small-angle neutron scattering shows that,  in solution, both Merlin and Merlin(S518D) adopt a closed conformation, but  binding experiments indicate that a significant fraction of either Merlin or  Merlin(S518D) is capable of binding to the target protein NHERF1. Upon binding  to the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate lipid, the wild-type Merlin adopts  a more open conformation than in solution, but Merlin(S518D) remains in a closed  conformation. This study supports a rheostat model of Merlin in NHERF1 binding  and contributes to resolving a controversy about the molecular conformation and  binding activity of Merlin.

Mori T(1), Gotoh S, Shirakawa M, Hakoshima T.  Author information: (1)Structural Biology Laboratory, Nara Institute of Science and Technology,  8916-5, Takayama, Ikoma, Nara, 630-0192, Japan.  Merlin, a tumor suppressor encoded by the neurofibromatosis type 2 gene, has  been shown to suppress tumorigenesis by inhibiting the Cullin 4-RING E3  ubiquitin ligase CRL4(DCAF) (1) in the nucleus. This inhibition is mediated by  direct binding of merlin to DDB1-and-Cullin 4-associated Factor 1 (DCAF1), yet  the binding mode of merlin to DCAF1 is not well defined. Here, we report  structural and biophysical studies of the merlin binding to DCAF1 and its  interference with CD44 binding. The crystal structure of the merlin FERM domain  bound to the DCAF1 C-terminal acidic tail reveals that the hydrophobic IILXLN  motif located at the C-terminal end of DCAF1 binds subdomain C of the FERM  domain by forming a β-strand. The binding site and mode resemble that of merlin  binding to the CD44 cytoplasmic tail. Competition binding assay showed that CD44  and DCAF1 compete for binding to the merlin FERM domain in solution. The CD44  cytoplasmic tail is known to be cleaved for nuclear translocation by regulated  intra-membrane proteolysis (RIP). Our structure implies that, in the nucleus,  the CD44 cytoplasmic tail cleaved by RIP could release DCAF1 from merlin by  competing for binding to the merlin FERM domain, which results in the inhibition  of merlin-mediated suppression of tumorigenesis.  © 2014 The Authors Genes to Cells © 2014 by the Molecular Biology Society of  Japan and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

The genetic locus for neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) has recently been mapped to the  pericentromeric region of chromosome 17. We have genotyped eight previously  identified RFLP probes on 50 NF1 families to determine the placement of the NF1  locus relative to the RFLP loci. Thirty-eight recombination events in the  pericentromeric region were identified, eight involving crossovers between NF1  and loci on either chromosomal arm. Multipoint linkage analysis resulted in the  unique placement of six loci at odds greater than 100:1 in the order of  pter-A10-41-EW301-NF1-EW207-CRI-L581-CRI-L946 -qter. Owing to insufficient  crossovers, three loci--D17Z1, EW206, and EW203--could not be uniquely  localized. In this region female recombination rates were significantly higher  than those of males. These data were part of a joint study aimed at the  localization of both NF1 and tightly linked pericentromeric markers for  chromosome 17.

The von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1) gene has been localized to the  pericentromeric region of chromosome 17. We have screened six multigenerational  families with multiple, tightly linked markers to aid in mapping this region of  the chromosome. More than 150 members in six families were typed with probes  including HHH202, D17Z1, EW203, EW206, EW207, EW301, pA10-41, D17S37, and  D17S36. Two-point lod scores for NF1 versus all markers were calculated. HHH202  demonstrated the tightest linkage to NF1 with theta = .0, z = 3.86 (95%  confidence limits [CL] of theta = .0-.13), suggesting that HHH202 be considered  as a potential candidate marker for use in carrier detection and prenatal  diagnosis. Pairwise marker-to-marker lod scores were used in examining the most  likely order of subsets of the markers. Of those tested, the most likely order  was (pter)-pA10-41-EW301-D17Z1-HHH202-NF1-E W206-EW207-EW203-(qter). In  addition, we have ascertained an NF1 x NF1 half-cousin mating in which there are  four affected family members who are potentially homozygous for the disease  gene. Two of these four individuals have been sampled and typed for marker loci.  When their D17Z1 genotypes are considered, the probability that both these  individuals are heterozygous is 85%.

The defective gene causing von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1), one of  the most common inherited disorders affecting the human nervous system, was  recently mapped to chromosome 17. We have used additional DNA markers to further  narrow and bracket the NF1 defect. A multipoint linkage analysis suggests that  the NF1 gene is flanked by D17Z1 on the centromeric side and by EW 207 on the  telomeric side of the long arm of chromosome 17. The identification of closely  linked flanking markers should allow us to develop a reliable prenatal and  presymptomatic diagnostic test for this serious neurological disorder and  provides the basis for applying chromosome-specific cloning techniques for the  isolation and characterization of the mutant gene.

Author information: (1)Department of Human Genetics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.  The von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1) gene has been mapped to the  pericentromeric region of chromosome 17. We conducted linkage analyses of NF1 by  using 10 polymorphic DNA markers from this chromosomal region. We ascertained 20  American Caucasian NF1 families (163 individuals, 98 NF1 affected) in Michigan  and Ohio and also studied a large family ascertained primarily in North  Carolina. The following markers were used in this study: HHH202, TH17.19, D17Z1,  ERBA1, EW203, EW206, EW207, EW301, CRI-L581, and CRI-L946. NF1 did not recombine  with either TH17.19 or HHH202 in any of the informative meioses surveyed  (maximum lod scores of 17.04 and 7.21, respectively, at a recombination fraction  of .00), indicating that these markers map very close to the NF1 gene. We also  report evidence of three instances of recombination between NF1 and the  centromeric marker D17Z1 (maximum lod score of 13.43 at a recombination fraction  of .04), as well as two crossovers between pairs of marker loci. We find no  evidence of locus heterogeneity, and our results support the localization of the  NF1 gene to proximal chromosome 17q.

A genetic linkage study with 16 polymorphic DNA markers spanning the region  17p11-17q24 in 22 NF1 families is presented. Close linkage between NF1 and eight  pericentromeric markers (HHH202, EW206, CRI-L946, EW203, EW301, FG2, p17H8, and  CRI-L581) has been found, probe HHH202 being the closest marker to NF1. Genetic  heterogeneity has been excluded. The study of multiply informative meioses  suggests that the probes HHH202 and RW206 are flanking markers for NF1. The most  likely order on the basis of multiply informative meioses and multipoint mapping  is pter-pA10.41-EW301-cen-HHH202-NF1-EW206-++ +EW207-qter.

The gene for von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) has recently been  mapped to the pericentromeric region of human chromosome 17. To further localize  the NF1 gene, linkage analysis using chromosome 17 DNA markers was performed on  11 multigeneration families with 175 individuals, 57 of whom were affected. The  markers used were D17Z1 (p17H8), D17S58 (EW301), D17S54 (EW203), D17S57 (EW206),  D17S73 (EW207), CRI-L946, HOX-2, and growth hormone. Tight linkage was found  between NF1 and D17Z1, D17S58, and D17S57 with a recombination fraction of zero.  One recombinant was detected between NF1 and D17S73, showing linkage with a 10%  recombination fraction. No linkage was detected between NF1 and CRI-L946 or  between HOX-2 and growth hormone.

Author information: (1)Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor  48109-0650.  The von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1) locus has been linked to  chromosome 17, and recent linkage analyses place the gene on the proximal long  arm. NF1 probably resides in 17q11.2, since two unrelated NF1 patients have been  identified who possess constitutional reciprocal translocations involving  17q11.2 with chromosomes 1 and 22. We have used a somatic-cell hybrid from the  t(17;22) individual, along with other hybrid cell lines, to order probes around  the NF1 locus. An additional probe, 17L1, has been isolated from a NotI linking  library made from flow-sorted chromosome 17 material and has been mapped to a  region immediately proximal to the translocation breakpoint. While neither NF1  translocation breakpoint has yet been identified by pulse-field gel analysis, an  overlap between two probes, EW206 and EW207, has been detected. Furthermore, we  have identified the breakpoint in a non-NF1 translocation, SP-3, on the proximal  side of the NF1 locus. This breakpoint has been helpful in creating a 1,000-kb  pulsed-field map, which includes the closely linked NF1 probes HHH202 and  TH17.19. The combined somatic-cell hybrid and pulsed-field gel analysis we  report here favors the probe order D17Z1-HHH202-TH17.19-CRYB1-17L1-NF1- (EW206,  EW207, EW203, L581, L946)-(ERBB2, ERBA1). The agreement in probe ordering  between linkage analysis and physical mapping is excellent, and the availability  of translocation breakpoints in NF1 should now greatly assist the cloning of  this locus.

In addition to reporting, in accompanying papers, their individual analyses of  mapping the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene on chromosome 17, members of the  International Consortium for NF1 Linkage contributed their data for our joint  analysis to determine the exact sequence of flanking markers and to obtain  precise estimates and confidence limits of the recombination fractions for the  closest markers, in anticipation of clinical use. With specimens from 142  families and more than 700 affected persons, eight teams used 31 markers in the  pericentric region of chromosome 17 to perform 13,838 genotypings. With the  combined data, we used the computer program CRI-MAP to build the most likely  sequence of loci by sequentially adding single loci to a fixed pair of loci and  separately calculating the likelihood of all permutations of four consecutive  loci. The best order is pter-pA10-41-EW301-centromere  (p17H8)-pHHH202-NF1-EW206-EW207-EW203++ +-CRI-L581-CRI-L946-HOX2-NGFR-qter. The  total genetic distance from pA10-41 to NGFR is 26 cM in males and 56 cM in  females, and the overall difference in sex-specific maps is statistically  significant (P = .006). The upper 99% confidence limits of the recombination  fraction of the closest proximal marker, pHHH202, is 4%, and that for the  closest distal marker, EW206, is 9%. These limits should decrease with the use  of additional probes and the further evaluation of DNA from the six persons  showing multiple recombinations within short genetic distances. Clinical  application is technically feasible with currently available markers, although  its appropriate use for prenatal and presymptomatic diagnosis requires further  discussion and evaluation.

Three additional markers (HHH202, CRI-L581, and CRI-L946) were  included in the analyses. Recombinants within the cluster of seven unordered  marker loci were identified by pairwise analyses for each family and by  examining the within-sibship segregation patterns for different markers. Changes  in the segregation pattern for different loci define genetic breakpoints. Given  that interference is complete in the region, markers with the same segregation  pattern lie on one side of the breakpoint, while markers with different  segregation patterns lie on opposite sides of the breakpoint.

Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) can be localized by (18)F-FDG PET.  The uptake is particularly high in tumors with an underlying succinate  dehydrogenase (SDH) mutation. SDHx-related PPGLs are characterized by  compromised oxidative phosphorylation and a pseudohypoxic response, which  mediates an increase in aerobic glycolysis, also known as the Warburg effect.  The aim of this study was to explore the hypothesis that increased uptake of  (18)F-FDG in SDHx-related PPGLs is reflective of increased glycolytic activity  and is correlated with expression of different proteins involved in glucose  uptake and metabolism through the glycolytic pathway. METHODS: Twenty-seven PPGLs collected from patients with hereditary mutations in  SDHB (n = 2), SDHD (n = 3), RET (n = 5), neurofibromatosis 1 (n = 1), and  myc-associated factor X (n = 1) and sporadic patients (n = 15) were  investigated. Preoperative (18)F-FDG PET/CT studies were analyzed; mean and  maximum standardized uptake values (SUVs) in manually drawn regions of interest  were calculated. The expression of proteins involved in glucose uptake (glucose  transporters types 1 and 3 [GLUT-1 and -3, respectively]), phosphorylation  (hexokinases 1, 2, and 3 [HK-1, -2, and -3, respectively]), glycolysis  (monocarboxylate transporter type 4 [MCT-4]), and angiogenesis (vascular  endothelial growth factor [VEGF], CD34) were examined in paraffin-embedded tumor  tissues using immunohistochemical staining with peroxidase-catalyzed  polymerization of diaminobenzidine as a read-out. The expression was correlated  with corresponding SUVs. RESULTS: Both maximum and mean SUVs for SDHx-related tumors were significantly  higher than those for sporadic and other hereditary tumors (P < 0.01). The  expression of HK-2 and HK-3 was significantly higher in SDHx-related PPGLs than  in sporadic PPGLs (P = 0.022 and 0.025, respectively). The expression of HK-2  and VEGF was significantly higher in SDHx-related PPGLs than in other hereditary  PPGLs (P = 0.039 and 0.008, respectively). No statistical differences in the  expression were observed for GLUT-1, GLUT-3, and MCT-4. The percentage anti-CD  34 staining and mean vessel perimeter were significantly higher in SDHx-related  PPGLs than in sporadic tumors (P = 0.050 and 0.010, respectively). Mean SUVs  significantly correlated with the expression of HK-2 (P = 0.027), HK-3 (P =  0.013), VEGF (P = 0.049), and MCT-4 (P = 0.020). CONCLUSION: The activation of aerobic glycolysis in SDHx-related PPGLs is  associated with increased (18)F-FDG accumulation due to accelerated glucose  phosphorylation by hexokinases rather than increased expression of glucose  transporters.  © 2014 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.

Author information: (1)Sarah M. and Charles E. Seay Center for Musculoskeletal Research, Texas  Scottish Rite Hospital for Children, Dallas, TX, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by  mutations in NF1. Among the earliest manifestations is tibial pseudoarthrosis  and persistent nonunion after fracture. To further understand the pathogenesis  of pseudoarthrosis and the underlying bone remodeling defect, pseudoarthrosis  tissue and cells cultured from surgically resected pseudoarthrosis tissue from  NF1 individuals were analyzed using whole-exome and whole-transcriptome  sequencing as well as genomewide microarray analysis. Genomewide analysis  identified multiple genetic mechanisms resulting in somatic biallelic NF1  inactivation; no other genes with recurring somatic mutations were identified.  Gene expression profiling identified dysregulated pathways associated with  neurofibromin deficiency, including phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. Unlike aggressive  NF1-associated malignancies, tibial pseudoarthrosis tissue does not harbor a  high frequency of somatic mutations in oncogenes or other tumor-suppressor  genes, such as p53. However, gene expression profiling indicates that  pseudoarthrosis tissue has a tumor-promoting transcriptional pattern, despite  lacking tumorigenic somatic mutations. Significant overexpression of specific  cancer-associated genes in pseudoarthrosis highlights a potential for receptor  tyrosine kinase inhibitors to target neurofibromin-deficient pseudoarthrosis and  promote proper bone remodeling and fracture healing.  © 2014 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

BACKGROUND: Genomic disorders are caused by copy number changes that may exhibit  recurrent breakpoints processed by nonallelic homologous recombination. However,  region-specific disease-associated copy number changes have also been observed  which exhibit non-recurrent breakpoints. The mechanisms underlying these  non-recurrent copy number changes have not yet been fully elucidated. RESULTS: We analyze large NF1 deletions with non-recurrent breakpoints as a  model to investigate the full spectrum of causative mechanisms, and observe that  they are mediated by various DNA double strand break repair mechanisms, as well  as aberrant replication. Further, two of the 17 NF1 deletions with non-recurrent  breakpoints, identified in unrelated patients, occur in association with the  concomitant insertion of SINE/variable number of tandem repeats/Alu (SVA)  retrotransposons at the deletion breakpoints. The respective breakpoints are  refractory to analysis by standard breakpoint-spanning PCRs and are only  identified by means of optimized PCR protocols designed to amplify across  GC-rich sequences. The SVA elements are integrated within SUZ12P intron 8 in  both patients, and were mediated by target-primed reverse transcription of SVA  mRNA intermediates derived from retrotranspositionally active source elements.  Both SVA insertions occurred during early postzygotic development and are  uniquely associated with large deletions of 1 Mb and 867 kb, respectively, at  the insertion sites. CONCLUSIONS: Since active SVA elements are abundant in the human genome and the  retrotranspositional activity of many SVA source elements is high, SVA  insertion-associated large genomic deletions encompassing many hundreds of  kilobases could constitute a novel and as yet under-appreciated mechanism  underlying large-scale copy number changes in the human genome.

Author information: (1)Institute for Genetic Medicine, University of Southern California, Keck  School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90089, USA. mehrian@usc.edu.  BACKGROUND: Schwannomas are the most common neurofibromatosis type 2  (NF2)-associated tumors with significant phenotypic heterogeneity in patients.  The most severe subtype has an early and rapid progression and the mild type has  a later onset and a less aggressive course. The aim of this study was to  elucidate the underlying molecular differences between these groups. We compared  the gene expression pattern between patients with early to late age of onset. RESULTS: A gene signature of 21 genes was constructed to differentiate between  early-onset and late-onset patients. We confirmed these results by real-time PCR  for SNF1LK2, NGFRAP1L1 (BEX 5), GMNN, and EPHA2. CONCLUSION: Genes identified here may be additional aberrations in  merlin-depleted cells that govern the disease onset. A significant number of  these genes have been suggested as having a role in carcinogenesis and are used  as biomarkers for prognosis in several other cancers. The role of these genes in  NF2 carcinogenesis and their potential as biomarkers or drug target are  worthwhile exploring.

Individuals with neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1) can manifest focal skeletal  dysplasias that remain extremely difficult to treat. NF1 is caused by mutations  in the NF1 gene, which encodes the RAS GTPase-activating protein neurofibromin.  We report here that ablation of Nf1 in bone-forming cells leads to  supraphysiologic accumulation of pyrophosphate (PPi), a strong inhibitor of  hydroxyapatite formation, and that a chronic extracellular signal-regulated  kinase (ERK)-dependent increase in expression of genes promoting PPi synthesis  and extracellular transport, namely Enpp1 and Ank, causes this phenotype. Nf1  ablation also prevents bone morphogenic protein-2-induced osteoprogenitor  differentiation and, consequently, expression of alkaline phosphatase and PPi  breakdown, further contributing to PPi accumulation. The short stature and  impaired bone mineralization and strength in mice lacking Nf1 in  osteochondroprogenitors or osteoblasts can be corrected by asfotase-α enzyme  therapy aimed at reducing PPi concentration. These results establish  neurofibromin as an essential regulator of bone mineralization. They also  suggest that altered PPi homeostasis contributes to the skeletal dysplasias  associated with NF1 and that some of the NF1 skeletal conditions could be  prevented pharmacologically.

Iglesias Gómez JC(1), Mosquera Orgueira A(2).  Author information: (1)Independent Video Editor , Santiago de Compostela , Spain. (2)Independent Researcher , A Coruña , Spain.  Meningiomas are frequent central nervous system neoplasms, which despite their  predominant benignity, show sporadically malignant behavior. Type 2  neurofibromatosis and polymorphisms in several genes have been associated with  meningioma risk and are probably involved in its pathogenesis. Although GWAS  studies have found loci related to meningioma risk, little is known about the  factors determining malignant transformation. Thus, this study is aimed to  identify the genomic and transcriptomic factors influencing evolution from  benignity toward aggressive phenotypes. By applying an integrative  bioinformatics pipeline combining public information on a wealth of biological  layers of complexity (from genetic polymorphisms to protein interactions), this  study identified a module of co-expressed genes highly correlated with tumor  stage and statistically linked to several genomic regions (module Quantitative  Trait Loci, mQTLs). Ontology analysis of the transcription hub genes identified  microtubule-associated cell-cycle processes as key drivers of such network.  mQTLs and single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with meningioma stage were  replicated in an alternative meningioma cohort, and integration of these results  with up-to-date scientific literature and several databases retrieved a list of  genes and pathways with a potentially important role in meningioma malignancy.  As a result, cytoskeleton and cell-cell adhesion pathways, calcium-channels and  glutamate receptors, as well as oxidoreductase and endoplasmic  reticulum-associated degradation pathways were found to be the most important  and redundant findings associated to meningioma progression. This study presents  an integrated view of the pathways involved in meningioma malignant conversion  and paves the way for the development of new research lines that will improve  our understanding of meningioma biology.

Jaakkola S(1), Peltonen J, Riccardi V, Chu ML, Uitto J.  Author information: (1)Department of Dermatology, Jefferson Medical College, Jefferson Institute of  Molecular Medicine, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  19107.  Cutaneous neurofibromas, characteristic lesions of neurofibromatosis 1, are  composed of an abundant extracellular matrix and nerve connective tissue-derived  cell types: Schwann cells, perineurial cells, and fibroblasts. In this study,  the extracellular matrix gene expression by these cells was examined under  culture conditions that allowed them to be metabolically active and readily  identifiable by morphologic and immunocytochemical criteria. Northern  hybridizations demonstrated expression of genes for type I, III, IV, and VI  collagens, as well as for fibronectin, laminin, and elastin. In situ  hybridizations revealed that all three cell types expressed pro alpha 1 (I), pro  alpha 2 (VI), and laminin B1 chain genes. However, fibroblasts did not contain  [35S]cDNA-mRNA hybrids specific for type IV collagen, whereas both Schwann cells  and perineurial cells expressed these genes. Perineurial cells and fibroblasts  readily expressed the fibronectin gene whereas Schwann cells were essentially  devoid of the corresponding mRNA. Perineurial cells also expressed the gene for  laminin A chain. The results indicate that the extracellular matrix gene  expression profiles of Schwann cells, perineurial cells, and fibroblasts are  distinct: all three cell types are capable of expressing some of the genes for  extracellular matrix components, such as type I and VI collagens, whereas  Schwann cells and perineurial cells may have the primary role in synthesizing  basement membrane zone components, type IV collagen and laminin. These  observations potentially relate to the mechanisms of growth and development of  human neurofibromas. The results attest to the applicability of the methodology  utilized here to study other human tumors with mixed cell populations.

Schulz A, Zoch A, Morrison H.  Mutagenic loss of the NF2 tumor suppressor gene encoded protein merlin is known  to provoke the hereditary neoplasia syndrome, Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). In  addition to glial cell-derived tumors in the PNS and CNS, disease-related  lesions also affect the skin and the eyes. Furthermore, 60% of NF2 patients  suffer from peripheral nerve damage, clinically referred to as peripheral  neuropathy. Strikingly, NF2-associated neuropathy often occurs in the absence of  nerve damaging tumors, suggesting tumor-independent events. Recent findings  indicate an important role of merlin in neuronal cell types concerning  neuromorphogenesis, axon structure maintenance and communication between axons  and Schwann cells. In this review, we compile clinical and experimental  evidences for the underestimated role of the tumor suppressor merlin in the  neuronal compartment.

It is currently unclear whether Merlin/NF2 suppresses tumorigenesis by  activating upstream components of the Hippo pathway at the plasma membrane or by  inhibiting the E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4(DCAF1) in the nucleus. We found that  derepressed CRL4(DCAF1) promotes YAP- and TEAD-dependent transcription by  ubiquitylating and, thereby, inhibiting Lats1 and 2 in the nucleus. Genetic  epistasis experiments and analysis of tumor-derived missense mutations indicate  that this signaling connection sustains the oncogenicity of Merlin-deficient  tumor cells. Analysis of clinical samples confirms that this pathway operates in  NF2-mutant tumors. We conclude that derepressed CRL4(DCAF1) promotes activation  of YAP by inhibiting Lats1 and 2 in the nucleus.

Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults,  with a poor prognosis because of its resistance to radiotherapy and  chemotherapy. Merlin/NF2 (moesin-ezrin-radixin-like protein/neurofibromatosis  type 2) is a tumor suppressor found to be mutated in most nervous system tumors;  however, it is not mutated in glioblastomas. Merlin associates with several  transmembrane receptors and intracellular proteins serving as an anchoring  molecule. Additionally, it acts as a key component of cell motility. By  selecting sub-populations of U251 glioblastoma cells, we observed that high  expression of phosphorylated Merlin at serine 518 (S518-Merlin), NOTCH1 and  epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) correlated with increased cell  proliferation and tumorigenesis. These cells were defective in cell-contact  inhibition with changes in Merlin phosphorylation directly affecting NOTCH1 and  EGFR expression, as well as downstream targets HES1 (hairy and enhancer of  split-1) and CCND1 (cyclin D1). Of note, we identified a function for  S518-Merlin, which is distinct from what has been reported when the expression  of Merlin is diminished in relation to EGFR and NOTCH1 expression, providing  first-time evidence that demonstrates that the phosphorylation of S518-Merlin in  glioblastoma promotes oncogenic properties that are not only the result of  inactivation of the tumor suppressor role of Merlin but also an independent  process implicating a Merlin-driven regulation of NOTCH1 and EGFR.

Erratum in     J Bone Miner Res. 2015 Jun;30(6):1118.  Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disease with an  incidence of 1/3000, caused by mutations in the NF1 gene, which encodes the  RAS/GTPase-activating protein neurofibromin. Non-bone union after fracture  (pseudarthrosis) in children with NF1 remains a challenging orthopedic condition  to treat. Recent progress in understanding the biology of neurofibromin  suggested that NF1 pseudarthrosis stems primarily from defects in the bone  mesenchymal lineage and hypersensitivity of hematopoietic cells to TGFβ.  However, clinically relevant pharmacological approaches to augment bone union in  these patients remain limited. In this study, we report the generation of a  novel conditional mutant mouse line used to model NF1 pseudoarthrosis, in which  Nf1 can be ablated in an inducible fashion in osteoprogenitors of postnatal  mice, thus circumventing the dwarfism associated with previous mouse models  where Nf1 is ablated in embryonic mesenchymal cell lineages. An ex vivo-based  cell culture approach based on the use of Nf1(flox/flox) bone marrow stromal  cells showed that loss of Nf1 impairs osteoprogenitor cell differentiation in a  cell-autonomous manner, independent of developmental growth plate-derived or  paracrine/hormonal influences. In addition, in vitro gene expression and  differentiation assays indicated that chronic ERK activation in Nf1-deficient  osteoprogenitors blunts the pro-osteogenic property of BMP2, based on the  observation that only combination treatment with BMP2 and MEK inhibition  promoted the differentiation of Nf1-deficient osteoprogenitors. The in vivo  preclinical relevance of these findings was confirmed by the improved bone  healing and callus strength observed in Nf1osx (-/-) mice receiving Trametinib  (a MEK inhibitor) and BMP2 released locally at the fracture site via a novel  nanoparticle and polyglycidol-based delivery method. Collectively, these results  provide novel evidence for a cell-autonomous role of neurofibromin in  osteoprogenitor cells and insights about a novel targeted approach for the  treatment of NF1 pseudoarthrosis.  © 2014 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

Molecular diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is challenging owing to  the large size of the tumour suppressor gene NF1, and the lack of mutation  hotspots. A somatic alteration of the wild-type NF1 allele is observed in  NF1-associated tumours. Genetic heterogeneity in NF1 was confirmed in patients  with SPRED1 mutations. Here, we present a targeted next-generation sequencing  (NGS) of NF1 and SPRED1 using a multiplex PCR approach (230 amplicons of  ∼150 bp) on a PGM sequencer. The chip capacity allowed mixing 48 bar-coded  samples in a 4-day workflow. We validated the NGS approach by retrospectively  testing 30 NF1-mutated samples, and then prospectively analysed 279 patients in  routine diagnosis. On average, 98.5% of all targeted bases were covered by at  least 20X and 96% by at least 100X. An NF1 or SPRED1 alteration was found in  246/279 (88%) and 10/279 (4%) patients, respectively. Genotyping throughput was  increased over 10 times, as compared with Sanger, with ∼90[euro ] for  consumables per sample. Interestingly, our targeted NGS approach also provided  quantitative information based on sequencing depth allowing identification of  multiexons deletion or duplication. We then addressed the NF1 somatic mutation  detection sensitivity in mosaic NF1 patients and tumours.

VSs occur in  either sporadic or familial (neurofibromatosis type 2, NF2) forms, both  associated with inactivating defects in the NF2 tumor suppressor gene. Treatment  for VSs is generally surgical resection or radiosurgery, however the morbidity  of such procedures has driven investigations into less invasive treatments.  Historically, lack of access to fresh tissue specimens and the fact that  schwannoma cells are not immortalized have significantly hampered the use of  primary cultures for investigation of schwannoma tumorigenesis. To overcome the  limited supply of primary cultures, the immortalized HEI193 VS cell line was  generated by transduction with HPV E6 and E7 oncogenes. This oncogenic  transduction introduced significant molecular and phenotypic alterations to the  cells, which limit their use as a model for human schwannoma tumors. We  therefore illustrate a simplified, reproducible protocol for culture of primary  human VS cells. This easily mastered technique allows for molecular and cellular  investigations that more accurately recapitulate the complexity of VS disease.

Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder  resulting from germline mutations in the NF2 gene. Bilateral vestibular  schwannomas, tumors on cranial nerve VIII, are pathognomonic for NF2 disease.  Furthermore, schwannomas also commonly develop in other cranial nerves, dorsal  root ganglia and peripheral nerves. These tumors are a major cause of morbidity  and mortality, and medical therapies to treat them are limited. Animal models  that accurately recapitulate the full anatomical spectrum of human NF2-related  schwannomas, including the characteristic functional deficits in hearing and  balance associated with cranial nerve VIII tumors, would allow systematic  evaluation of experimental therapeutics prior to clinical use. Here, we present  a genetically engineered NF2 mouse model generated through excision of the Nf2  gene driven by Cre expression under control of a tissue-restricted  3.9kbPeriostin promoter element. By 10 months of age, 100% of Postn-Cre;  Nf2(flox/flox) mice develop spinal, peripheral and cranial nerve tumors  histologically identical to human schwannomas. In addition, the development of  cranial nerve VIII tumors correlates with functional impairments in hearing and  balance, as measured by auditory brainstem response and vestibular testing.  Overall, the Postn-Cre; Nf2(flox/flox) tumor model provides a novel tool for  future mechanistic and therapeutic studies of NF2-associated schwannomas.  © The Author 2014.

Kaul A(1), Toonen JA(1), Gianino SM(1), Gutmann DH(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis,  Missouri.  BACKGROUND: Children with the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) tumor  predisposition syndrome are prone to the development of optic pathway gliomas  resulting from biallelic inactivation of the NF1 gene. Recent studies have  revealed the presence of other molecular alterations in a small portion of these  NF1-associated brain tumors. The purpose of this study was to leverage Nf1  genetically engineered mouse strains to define the functional significance of  these changes to optic glioma biology. METHODS: Nf1+/- mice were intercrossed with Nf1(flox/flox) mice, which were then  crossed with Nf1(flox/flox); GFAP-Cre mice, to generate Nf1(flox/mut); GFAP-Cre  (FMC) mice. These mice were additionally mated with conditional KIAA1549:BRAF  knock-in or Pten(flox/wt) mice to generate Nf1(flox/mut); f-BRAF; GFAP-Cre  (FMBC) mice or Nf1(flox/mut); Pten(flox/wt); GFAP-Cre (FMPC) mice, respectively.  The resulting optic gliomas were analyzed for changes in tumor volume,  proliferation, and retinal ganglion cell loss. RESULTS: While KIAA1549:BRAF conferred no additional biological properties on  Nf1 optic glioma, FMPC mice had larger optic gliomas with greater proliferative  indices and microglial infiltration. In addition, all 3 Nf1 murine optic glioma  strains exhibited reduced retinal ganglion cell survival and numbers; however,  FMPC mice had greater retinal nerve fiber layer thinning near the optic head  relative to FMC and FMBC mice. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these experiments demonstrate genetic cooperativity  between Nf1 loss and Pten heterozygosity relevant to optic glioma biology and  further underscore the value of employing genetically engineered mouse strains  to define the contribution of discovered molecular alterations to brain tumor  pathogenesis.  © The Author(s) 2014.

Author information: (1)1 Center for Medical Genetics, Keio University School of Medicine , Tokyo,  Japan .  AIMS: We assessed the validity of a next-generation sequencing protocol using  in-solution hybridization-based enrichment to identify NF1 mutations for the  diagnosis of 86 patients with a prototypic genetic syndrome, neurofibromatosis  type 1. In addition, other causative genes for classic genetic syndromes were  set as the target genes for coverage analysis. RESULTS: The protocol identified 30 nonsense, 19 frameshift, and 8 splice-site  mutations, together with 10 nucleotide substitutions that were previously  reported to be pathogenic. In the remaining 19 samples, 10 had single-exon or  multiple-exon deletions detected by a multiplex ligation-dependent probe  amplification method and 3 had missense mutations that were not observed in the  normal Japanese SNP database and were predicted to be pathogenic. Coverage  analysis of the genes other than the NF1 gene included on the same diagnostic  panel indicated that the mean coverage was 115-fold, a sufficient depth for  mutation detection. CONCLUSIONS: The overall mutation detection rate using the currently reported  method in 86 patients who met the clinical diagnostic criteria was 92.1% (70/76)  when 10 patients with large deletions were excluded. The results validate the  clinical utility of this next-generation sequencing-based method for the  diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1. Comparable detection rates can be  expected for other genetic syndromes, based on the results of the coverage  analysis.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant, monogenic disorder of  dysregulated neurocutaneous tissue growth. Pleiotropy, variable expressivity and  few NF1 genotype-phenotype correlates limit clinical prognostication in NF1.  Phenotype complexity in NF1 is hypothesized to derive in part from genetic  modifiers unlinked to the NF1 locus. In this study, we hypothesized that normal  variation in germline gene expression confers risk for certain phenotypes in  NF1. In a set of 79 individuals with NF1, we examined the association between  gene expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines with NF1-associated phenotypes and  sequenced select genes with significant phenotype/expression correlations. In a  discovery cohort of 89 self-reported European-Americans with NF1 we examined the  association between germline sequence variants of these genes with café-au-lait  macule (CALM) count, a tractable, tumor-like phenotype in NF1. Two correlated,  common SNPs (rs4660761 and rs7161) between DPH2 and ATP6V0B were significantly  associated with the CALM count. Analysis with tiled regression also identified  SNP rs4660761 as significantly associated with CALM count. SNP rs1800934 and 12  rare variants in the mismatch repair gene MSH6 were also associated with CALM  count. Both SNPs rs7161 and rs4660761 (DPH2 and ATP6V0B) were highly significant  in a mega-analysis in a combined cohort of 180 self-reported European-Americans;  SNP rs1800934 (MSH6) was near-significant in a meta-analysis assuming dominant  effect of the minor allele. SNP rs4660761 is predicted to regulate ATP6V0B, a  gene associated with melanosome biology. Individuals with homozygous mutations  in MSH6 can develop an NF1-like phenotype, including multiple CALMs. Through a  multi-platform approach, we identified variants that influence NF1 CALM count.

The corpus callosum connects cerebral hemispheres and is the largest axon tract  in the mammalian brain. Callosal malformations are among the most common  congenital brain anomalies and are associated with a wide range of  neuropsychological deficits. Crossing of the midline by callosal axons relies on  a proper midline environment that harbors guidepost cells emitting guidance cues  to instruct callosal axon navigation. Little is known about what controls the  formation of the midline environment. We find that two components of the Hippo  pathway, the tumor suppressor Nf2 (Merlin) and the transcriptional coactivator  Yap (Yap1), regulate guidepost development and expression of the guidance cue  Slit2 in mouse. During normal brain development, Nf2 suppresses Yap activity in  neural progenitor cells to promote guidepost cell differentiation and prevent  ectopic Slit2 expression. Loss of Nf2 causes malformation of midline guideposts  and Slit2 upregulation, resulting in callosal agenesis. Slit2 heterozygosity and  Yap deletion both restore callosal formation in Nf2 mutants. Furthermore,  selectively elevating Yap activity in midline neural progenitors is sufficient  to disrupt guidepost formation, upregulate Slit2 and prevent midline crossing.  The Hippo pathway is known for its role in controlling organ growth and  tumorigenesis. Our study identifies a novel role of this pathway in axon  guidance. Moreover, by linking axon pathfinding and neural progenitor behaviors,  our results provide an example of the intricate coordination between growth and  wiring during brain development.  © 2014.

Plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) are benign nerve sheath tumors mostly associated  with neurofibromatosis type 1. They often extend through multiple layers of  tissue and therefore cannot be treated satisfactorily by surgery. Nilotinib is a  tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat leukemia, with advantages over the  prototype imatinib in terms of potency and selectivity towards BCR-ABL, and the  DDR, PDGFR, and KIT receptor kinases. In this study, we compared efficacies of  the two drugs on cultured cells of PNF in vitro and on xenografted tumor  fragments on sciatic nerve of athymic nude mice. Xenografts were monitored  weekly using a high resolution ultrasound measurement. Treatment with nilotinib  at a daily dose of 100 mg/kg for four weeks led to a reduction of the graft  sizesstd by 68±7% in the 8 treated mice, significantly more than the 33±8%  reduction in the 8 untreated mice (P<0.05) and the 47±15% in the 7 mice treated  with imatinib (P<0.05). The peak plasma nilotinib concentration 6.6±1.1 µM is  within the pharmacological range of clinical application. Imatinib, but not  nilotinib significantly hindered body weight increase of the mice and elevated  cytotoxicity of mouse spleen cells (P<0.05). Our results suggest that nilotinib  may be more potent than imatinib for treating PNFs and may also be better  tolerated. Imatinib seems to have some off-target effect in elevating immunity.

Mutations in the merlin tumor suppressor gene cause Neurofibromatosis type 2  (NF2), which is a disease characterized by development of multiple benign tumors  in the nervous system. The current standard of care for NF2 calls for surgical  resection of the characteristic tumors, often with devastating neurological  consequences. There are currently no approved non-surgical therapies for NF2. In  an attempt to identify much needed targets and therapeutically active compounds  for NF2 treatment, we employed a chemical biology approach using  ultra-high-throughput screening. To support this goal, we created a merlin-null  mouse Schwann cell (MSC) line to screen for compounds that selectively decrease  their viability and proliferation. We optimized conditions for 384-well plate  assays and executed a proof-of-concept screen of the Library of  Pharmacologically Active Compounds. Further confirmatory and selectivity assays  identified phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) as a potential NF2 drug target.  Notably, loss of merlin function is associated with activation of the PI3K/Akt  pathway in human schwannomas. We report that AS605240, a PI3K inhibitor,  decreased merlin-null MSC viability in a dose-dependent manner without  significantly decreasing viability of control Schwann cells. AS605240 exerted  its action on merlin-null MSCs by promoting caspase-dependent apoptosis and  inducing autophagy. Additional PI3K inhibitors tested also decreased viability  of merlin-null MSCs in a dose-dependent manner. In summary, our chemical genomic  screen and subsequent hit validation studies have identified PI3K as potential  target for NF2 therapy.

Author information: (1)National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland,  USA.  OBJECTIVE: Measurement of pain interference in children is challenged by a lack  of validated measures with a parent proxy report. This study investigated the  psychometric properties of the Pain Interference Index (PII), a six-item  questionnaire originally developed in Swedish, in chronically ill youth. METHODS: We adapted the PII for English-speaking participants and created a  parallel parent proxy measure. Respondents indicate how much pain has interfered  with the child's life in the past 2 weeks (0-6 scale); higher scores indicate  more pain interference. Eligible participants included individuals 6-25 years  with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and cancer. Internal consistency was  assessed; validity was examined by correlating PII scores with existing measures  of pain interference (Modified Brief Pain Inventory [MBPI]) and pain intensity  (visual analogue scale [VAS]), and with measures of disease severity. RESULTS: Among 60 participants (mean age 14.7 years, range 6-24) and their  parents, PII internal consistency was 0.84 and 0.96, respectively. PII scores  correlated with MBPI (r = 0.81, P < 0.0001) and VAS (r = 0.55, P < 0.0001)  scores and differentiated between patients with mild vs moderate/severe NF1  disease severity (P < 0.05). The PII-Parent was significantly correlated with  the mothers' and fathers' VAS rating of the child's pain intensity (Ps < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Internal consistency of the English PII is high; validity is  supported by the PII's correlations with other measures of pain interference and  pain intensity, and with disease severity in patients with NF1. Preliminary data  indicate that the English PII is a reliable, valid, feasible pain interference  measure for youth with NF1 and cancer.  Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Molecular mechanisms governing the maintenance and proliferation of dorsal root  ganglia (DRG) progenitors are largely unknown. Here we reveal that the Hippo  pathway regulates the expansion of DRG progenitors and glia during mammalian DRG  development. The key effectors of this pathway, transcriptional coactivators Yap  and Taz, are expressed in DRG progenitors and glia during DRG development but  are at least partially inhibited from activating transcription. Aberrant YAP  activation leads to overexpansion of DRG progenitor and glial populations. We  further show that the Neurofibromatosis 2 (Nf2) tumor suppressor inhibits Yap  during DRG development. Loss of Nf2 leads to similar phenotypes as does YAP  hyperactivation, and deleting Yap suppresses these phenotypes. Our study  demonstrates that Nf2-Yap signaling plays important roles in controlling the  expansion of DRG progenitors and glia during DRG development.  Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

PMID:25475340,Validity and interexaminer reliability of a new method to quantify skin neurofibromas of neurofibromatosis 1 using paper frames.,10.1186/s13023-014-0202-9,Orphanet journal of rare diseases,2014.0,bench,pubmed,True,Clinical measurement method,"Validity and interexaminer reliability of a new method to quantify skin  neurofibromas of neurofibromatosis 1 using paper frames.  Cunha KS, Rozza-de-Menezes RE, Andrade RM, Theos A, Luiz RR, Korf B, Geller M.  BACKGROUND: Skin neurofibromas represent one of the main clinical manifestations  of neurofibromatosis 1, and their number varies greatly between individuals.  Quantifying their number is an important step in the methodology of many  clinical studies, but counting neurofibromas one by one in individuals with  thousands of tumors is arduous, time-consuming, and subject to intra and  interexaminer variability. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a new  methodology for skin neurofibromas quantification using paper frames. METHODS: The sample comprised 92 individuals with NF1. Paper frames, with a  central square measuring 100 cm2, were placed on the back, abdomen and thigh.  Images were taken, transferred to a computer and two independent examiners  counted the neurofibromas. The average number of neurofibromas/100 cm2 of skin  was obtained from the mean of the three values. The differences in the quantity  of neurofibromas counted by two examiners were evaluated with Intraclass  correlation coefficient (ICC), paired t-test, Bland-Altman and  survival-agreement plots. To evaluate the predictive value of the method in  obtaining the total number of neurofibromas, 49 participants also had their  tumors counted one by one. Reproducibility was assessed with Pearson's  correlation coefficients and simple linear regression model. RESULTS: There was excellent agreement between examiners (ICC range 0.992-0.997)  and the total number of skin neurofibromas could be predicted by the adhesive  frames technique using a specific formula (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In this article we describe a reliable, easy and rapid technique  using paper frames to quantify skin neurofibromas that accurately predicts the  total number of these tumors in patients with NF1. This method may be a useful  tool in clinical practice and clinical research to help achieve an accurate  quantitative phenotype of NF1.

Multiple peripheral nervous tumors were induced in 45 of 60 (75.0%) Syrian  golden hamsters by transplacental administration of N-ethyl-N-nitro-sourea.  Moreover, melanomas, pheochromocytomas, and Wilms' tumors developed in six  (10.0%), three (5.0%), and 13 (21.7%) animals, respectively. The histologic,  immunohistochemical, and electron microscopic findings of the peripheral nervous  tumors were similar to those of human neurofibroma, and their growth pattern and  distribution resembled those of human von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis  (VRNF). The occurrence of melanoma, pheochromocytoma, and proliferative foci of  melanin-containing cells in neurofibroma suggests that the targets of ENU in  hamsters are the neural crest-derived cells. With its high incidence of Wilms'  tumor, the hamster with ENU-induced tumors is considered to be a good animal  model for human neurocristopathy, including VRNF.

This study was designed to address the importance of MEK and Akt  signaling to Nf1 optic glioma growth. METHODS: Primary neonatal mouse astrocyte cultures were employed to determine  the consequence of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt and MEK inhibition  on Nf1-deficient astrocyte growth. Nf1 optic glioma-bearing mice were used to  assess the effect of Akt and MEK inhibition on tumor volume, proliferation, and  retinal ganglion cell dysfunction. RESULTS: Both MEK and Akt were hyperactivated in Nf1-deficient astrocytes in  vitro and in Nf1 murine optic gliomas in vivo. Pharmacologic PI3K or Akt  inhibition reduced Nf1-deficient astrocyte proliferation to wild-type levels,  while PI3K inhibition decreased Nf1 optic glioma volume and proliferation. Akt  inhibition of Nf1-deficient astrocyte and optic glioma growth reflected  Akt-dependent activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Sustained MEK  pharmacologic blockade also attenuated Nf1-deficient astrocytes as well as Nf1  optic glioma volume and proliferation. Importantly, these MEK inhibitory effects  resulted from p90RSK-mediated, Akt-independent mTOR activation. Finally, both  PI3K and MEK inhibition reduced optic glioma-associated retinal ganglion cell  loss and nerve fiber layer thinning. CONCLUSION: These findings establish that the convergence of 2 distinct Ras  effector pathways on mTOR signaling maintains Nf1 mouse optic glioma growth,  supporting the evaluation of pharmacologic inhibitors that target mTOR function  in future human NF1-optic pathway glioma clinical trials.  © The Author(s) 2014.

Individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) frequently exhibit cognitive and  motor impairments and characteristics of autism. The cerebellum plays a critical  role in motor control, cognition, and social interaction, suggesting that  cerebellar defects likely contribute to NF1-associated neurodevelopmental  disorders. Here we show that Nf1 inactivation during early, but not late stages  of cerebellar development, disrupts neuronal lamination, which is partially  caused by overproduction of glia and subsequent disruption of the Bergmann glia  (BG) scaffold. Specific Nf1 inactivation in glutamatergic neuronal precursors  causes premature differentiation of granule cell (GC) precursors and ectopic  production of unipolar brush cells (UBCs), indirectly disrupting neuronal  migration. Transient MEK inhibition during a neonatal window prevents cerebellar  developmental defects and improves long-term motor performance of Nf1-deficient  mice. This study reveals essential roles of Nf1 in GC/UBC migration by  generating correct numbers of glia and controlling GC/UBC  fate-specification/differentiation, identifying a therapeutic prevention  strategy for multiple NF1-associcated developmental abnormalities.

(#)Contributed equally  BACKGROUND: Meningiomas are tumors originating from the membranous layers  surrounding the central nervous system, and are generally regarded as ""benign""  tumors of the brain. Malignant meningiomas are rare and are typically associated  with a higher risk of local tumor recurrence and a poorer prognosis (median  survival time <2 years). Previous genome-wide association studies and exome  sequencing studies have identified genes that play a role in susceptibility to  meningiomas, but these studies did not focus specifically on malignant tumors. METHODS: We performed exome sequencing on five malignant meningiomas on the  Illumina HiSeq2000 platform using Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon kits. We  used wANNOVAR web server to annotate and prioritize variants, identified  candidate genes with recurrent mutations, and validated selected mutations by  Sanger sequencing. We next designed custom NimbleGen targeted region arrays on  five candidate genes, and sequenced four additional malignant meningiomas. RESULTS: From exome sequencing data, we identified several frequently mutated  genes including NF2, MN1, ARID1B, SEMA4D, and MUC2, with private mutations in  tumors. We sequenced these genes in four additional samples and identified  potential driver mutations in NF2 (neurofibromatosis type 2) and MN1 (meningioma  1). CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that mutations in NF2 may play a role in progression  of meningiomas, and nominated MN1 as a candidate gene for malignant  transformation of meningiomas. Our sample size is limited by the extreme rarity  of malignant meningiomas, but our study represents one of the first sequencing  studies focusing on the malignant subtype.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of patient and facility level factors on the  success of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in patients with  neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1). DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Large PGD reference laboratory. PATIENT(S): All patients with NF1 referred from June 2004 to May 2013. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Embryos' NF1 mutation status and live birth rates. RESULT(S): Seventy-seven couples underwent 156 PGD cycles during the study  period. The average maternal age at the time of embryo biopsy was 33.2 years.  The majority of embryos had a day 3 single blastomere biopsy without aneuploidy  screening. A diagnosis was obtained for 80% of biopsied embryos; 20% of biopsies  were nondiagnostic due to technical failures. Diagnosis was more often obtained  for embryos of parents with familial disease and for embryos biopsied at centers  that referred multiple NF1 cases. Among diagnosed embryos, 483/1,060 (46%) were  unaffected by the parental NF1 mutation. Twenty-two (14%) of the 156 cycles had  a confirmed live birth; if the observed success rate is applied to cycles with  unknown outcomes, 33/156 (21%) cycles are expected to have resulted in live  birth. In multivariate logistic regression, having a live birth was  significantly associated with having more unaffected embryos available for  transfer (odds ratio 1.33 per additional embryo, 95% confidence interval  1.02-1.72). CONCLUSION(S): Advances in biopsy and diagnostic techniques which increase the  number of unaffected embryos identified may improve live birth rates for  patients with NF1. Clinicians should counsel patients about their fertility and  reproductive options early, with the use of disease-specific data, to set  appropriate expectations for the PGD process.

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by  mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2. TSC has high frequency of osseous  manifestations such as sclerotic lesions in the craniofacial region. However, an  animal model that replicates TSC craniofacial bone lesions has not yet been  described. The roles of Tsc1 and the sequelae of Tsc1 dysfunction in bone are  unknown. In this study, we generated a mouse model of TSC with a deletion of  Tsc1 in neural crest-derived (NCD) cells that recapitulated the sclerotic  craniofacial bone lesions in TSC. Analysis of this mouse model demonstrated that  TSC1 deletion led to enhanced mTORC1 signaling in NCD bones and the increase in  bone formation is responsible for the aberrantly increased bone mass. Lineage  mapping revealed that TSC1 deficient NCD cells overpopulated the NCD bones.  Mechanistically, hyperproliferation of osteoprogenitors at an early postnatal  stage accounts for the increased osteoblast pool. Intriguingly, early postnatal  treatment with rapamycin, an mTORC1 inhibitor, can completely rescue the  aberrant bone mass, but late treatment cannot. Our data suggest that enhanced  mTOR signaling in NCD cells can increase bone mass through enlargement of the  osteoprogenitor pool, which likely explains the sclerotic bone lesion observed  in TSC patients.  © 2015 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

The availability of adult malignant glioma stem cells (GSCs) has provided  unprecedented opportunities to identify the mechanisms underlying treatment  resistance. Unfortunately, there is a lack of comparable reagents for the study  of pediatric low-grade glioma (LGG). Leveraging a neurofibromatosis 1 (Nf1)  genetically engineered mouse LGG model, we report the isolation of CD133(+)  multi-potent low-grade glioma stem cells (LG-GSCs), which generate glioma-like  lesions histologically similar to the parent tumor following injection into  immunocompetent hosts. In addition, we demonstrate that these LG-GSCs harbor  selective resistance to currently employed conventional and biologically  targeted anti-cancer agents, which reflect the acquisition of new targetable  signaling pathway abnormalities. Using transcriptomic analysis to identify  additional molecular properties, we discovered that mouse and human LG-GSCs  harbor high levels of Abcg1 expression critical for protecting against  ER-stress-induced mouse LG-GSC apoptosis. Collectively, these findings establish  that LGG cancer stem cells have unique molecular and functional properties  relevant to brain cancer treatment.  Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Individualized drug testing for tumors using a strategy  analogous to antibiotic tests for infectious diseases would be highly desirable  for personalized and individualized cancer care. METHODS: Primary cultures containing tumor and nontumor stromal cells were  utilized in a novel strategy to test drug responses with respect to both  efficacy and specificity. The strategy tested in this pilot study was  implemented using four primary cultures derived from plexiform neurofibromas.  Responses to two cytotoxic drugs (nilotinib and imatinib) were measured by  following dose-dependent changes in the proportions of tumor and nontumor cells,  determined by staining them with cell-type-specific antibodies. The viability of  the cultured cells and the cytotoxic effect of the drugs were also measured  using proliferation and cytotoxicity assays. RESULTS: The total number of cells decreased after the drug treatment, in  accordance with the observed reduction in proliferation and increased cytotoxic  effect upon incubation with the two anticancer drugs. The proportions of Schwann  cells and fibroblasts changed dose-dependently, although the patterns of change  varied between the tumor samples (from different sources) and between the two  drugs. The highly variable in vitro drug responses probably reflect the large  variations in the responses of tumors to therapies between individual patients  in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results suggest that the concept of assessing in  vitro drug responses using primary cultures is feasible, but demands the  extensive further development of an application for preclinical drug selection  and drug discovery.

Mesothelial cells are susceptible to asbestos fiber-induced cytotoxicity and on  longer time scales to transformation; the resulting mesothelioma is a highly  aggressive neoplasm that is considered as incurable at the present time Zucali  et al. (Cancer Treatment Reviews 37:543-558, 2011). Only few murine cell culture  models of immortalized mesothelial cells and mesothelioma cell lines exist to  date. We generated SV40-immortalized cell lines derived from wild-type (WT) and  neurofibromatosis 2 (merlin) heterozygote (Nf2+/-) mice, both on a commonly used  genetic background, C57Bl/6J. All immortalized mesothelial clones consistently  grow in DMEM supplemented with fetal bovine serum. Cells can be passaged for  more than 40 times without any signs of morphological changes or a decrease in  proliferation rate. The tumor suppressor gene NF2 is one of the most frequently  mutated genes in human mesothelioma, but its detailed function is still unknown.  Thus, these genotypically distinct cell lines likely relevant for malignant  mesothelioma formation are expected to serve as useful in vitro models, in  particular to compare with in vivo studies in mice of the same genotype.  Furthermore, we generated a novel murine mesothelioma cell line RN5 originating  from an Nf2+/- mouse subjected to repeated crocidolite exposure. RN5 cells are  highly tumorigenic.

Cognitive impairments are a major clinical feature of the common neurogenetic  disease neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Previous studies have demonstrated that  increased neuronal inhibition underlies the learning deficits in NF1, however,  the molecular mechanism underlying this cell-type specificity has remained  unknown. Here, we identify an interneuron-specific attenuation of  hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) current as the cause  for increased inhibition in Nf1 mutants. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that  HCN1 is a novel NF1-interacting protein for which loss of NF1 results in a  concomitant increase of interneuron excitability. Furthermore, the HCN channel  agonist lamotrigine rescued the electrophysiological and cognitive deficits in  two independent Nf1 mouse models, thereby establishing the importance of HCN  channel dysfunction in NF1. Together, our results provide detailed mechanistic  insights into the pathophysiology of NF1-associated cognitive defects, and  identify a novel target for clinical drug development.

The accurate detection of low-allelic variants is still challenging,  particularly for the identification of somatic mosaicism, where matched control  sample is not available. High throughput sequencing, by the simultaneous and  independent analysis of thousands of different DNA fragments, might overcome  many of the limits of traditional methods, greatly increasing the sensitivity.  However, it is necessary to take into account the high number of false positives  that may arise due to the lack of matched control samples. Here, we applied deep  amplicon sequencing to the analysis of samples with known genotype and variant  allele fraction (VAF) followed by a tailored statistical analysis. This method  allowed to define a minimum value of VAF for detecting mosaic variants with high  accuracy. Then, we exploited the estimated VAF to select candidate alterations  in NF2 gene in 34 samples with unknown genotype (30 blood and 4 tumor DNAs),  demonstrating the suitability of our method. The strategy we propose optimizes  the use of deep amplicon sequencing for the identification of low abundance  variants. Moreover, our method can be applied to different high throughput  sequencing approaches to estimate the background noise and define the accuracy  of the experimental design.

""Café-au-lait"" macules (CALMs) and overall skin hyperpigmentation are early  hallmarks of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). One of the most frequent monogenic  diseases, NF1 has subsequently been characterized with numerous benign Schwann  cell-derived tumors. It is well established that neurofibromin, the NF1 gene  product, is an antioncogene that down-regulates the RAS oncogene. In contrast,  the molecular mechanisms associated with alteration of skin pigmentation have  remained elusive. We have reassessed this issue by differentiating human  embryonic stem cells into melanocytes. In the present study, we demonstrate that  NF1 melanocytes reproduce the hyperpigmentation phenotype in vitro, and further  characterize the link between loss of heterozygosity and the typical CALMs that  appear over the general hyperpigmentation. Molecular mechanisms associated with  these pathological phenotypes correlate with an increased activity of  cAMP-mediated PKA and ERK1/2 signaling pathways, leading to overexpression of  the transcription factor MITF and of the melanogenic enzymes tyrosinase and  dopachrome tautomerase, all major players in melanogenesis. Finally, the  hyperpigmentation phenotype can be rescued using specific inhibitors of these  signaling pathways. These results open avenues for deciphering the pathological  mechanisms involved in pigmentation diseases, and provide a robust assay for the  development of new strategies for treating these diseases.

These disorders are an important cause  for intellectual disability; additional manifestations include autism spectrum  disorder, seizures, and brain malformations. Changes in synaptic function are  thought to underlie the neurological conditions associated with these syndromes.  We therefore studied morphology and in vivo synaptic transmission of the calyx  of Held synapse, a relay synapse in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body  (MNTB) of the auditory brainstem, in mouse models of tuberous sclerosis complex  (TSC), Fragile X syndrome (FXS), Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), and Costello  syndrome. Calyces from both Tsc1(+/-) and from Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mice showed  increased volume and surface area compared to wild-type (WT) controls. In  addition, in Fmr1 KO animals a larger fraction of calyces showed complex  morphology. In MNTB principal neurons of Nf1 (+/) (-) mice the average delay  between EPSPs and APs was slightly smaller compared to WT controls, which could  indicate an increased excitability. Otherwise, no obvious changes in synaptic  transmission, or short-term plasticity were observed during juxtacellular  recordings in any of the four lines. Our results in these four mutants thus  indicate that abnormalities of mTOR or Ras signaling do not necessarily result  in changes in in vivo synaptic transmission.

All  Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2)-associated meningiomas and ~60% of sporadic  meningiomas show loss of NF2 tumor suppressor protein. There are no effective  medical therapies for progressive and recurrent meningiomas. Our previous work  demonstrated aberrant activation of mTORC1 signaling that led to ongoing  clinical trials with rapamycin analogs for NF2 and sporadic meningioma patients.  Here we performed a high-throughput kinome screen to identify kinases  responsible for mTORC1 pathway activation in NF2-deficient meningioma cells.  Among the emerging top candidates were the mTORC2-specific target  serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) and p21-activated kinase 1  (PAK1). In NF2-deficient meningioma cells, inhibition of SGK1 rescues mTORC1  activation, and SGK1 activation is sensitive to dual mTORC1/2 inhibitor AZD2014,  but not to rapamycin. PAK1 inhibition also leads to attenuated mTORC1 but not  mTORC2 signaling, suggesting that mTORC2/SGK1 and Rac1/PAK1 pathways are  independently responsible for mTORC1 activation in NF2-deficient meningiomas.  Using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, we generated isogenic human arachnoidal cell  lines (ACs), the origin cell type for meningiomas, expressing or lacking NF2.  NF2-null CRISPR ACs recapitulate the signaling of NF2-deficient meningioma  cells. Interestingly, we observe increased SGK1 transcription and protein  expression in NF2-CRISPR ACs and in primary NF2-negative meningioma lines.  Moreover, we demonstrate that the dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitor, AZD2014 is  superior to rapamycin and PAK inhibitor FRAX597 in blocking proliferation of  meningioma cells. Importantly, AZD2014 is currently in use in several clinical  trials of cancer. Therefore, we believe that AZD2014 may provide therapeutic  advantage over rapalogs for recurrent and progressive meningiomas.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic condition caused  by dominant loss-of-function mutations of the tumor suppressor gene NF1 that  encodes neurofibromin, a negative regulator of RAS activity. Mutation analysis  of NF1 located at 17q11.2 has been hampered by the large size of the gene, the  high rate of new mutations, the lack of mutational clustering, and the presence  of several homologous loci. To date, about 80% of the reported NF1 mutations are  predicted to result in protein truncation, but very few studies have correlated  the causative NF1 mutation with its effect at the protein level. We evaluated a  novel diagnostic method to detect truncated forms of neurofibromin in a large  cohort of unrelated subjects suspected of having NF1, according to the NIH  consensus criteria. Western blot analysis was carried out on protein extracts  from patients' leukocytes to highlight the possible presence of altered  neurofibromin as a result of mutations in NF1. Truncated neurofibromin was  identified in 274/336 patients (81%), confirming the usefulness and  reproducibility of the proposed diagnostic approach. Our methodology can be  routinely applied in the diagnostic setting, thanks to its simplicity and  reliability. Combined with molecular approaches, it may increase the accuracy  and efficiency of NF1 genetic testing. We evaluated a novel diagnostic method to  detect truncated forms of neurofibromin in patients fulfilling the clinical  criteria for Neurofibromatosis 1. Western blot analysis identified truncated  neurofibromin in 274/336 patients (81%). Our results indicate that the proposed  technique is cheap and reliable, and could ideally be performed as a preliminary  biochemical screening before molecular analysis of the NF1 gene.  © 2015 International Society for Neurochemistry.

Merlin has broad tumor-suppressor functions as its mutations have been  identified in multiple benign tumors and malignant cancers. In all schwannomas,  the majority of meningiomas and 1/3 of ependymomas Merlin loss is causative. In  neurofibromatosis type 2, a dominantly inherited tumor disease because of the  loss of Merlin, patients suffer from multiple nervous system tumors and die on  average around age 40. Chemotherapy is not effective and tumor localization and  multiplicity make surgery and radiosurgery challenging and morbidity is often  considerable. Thus, a new therapeutic approach is needed for these tumors. Using  a primary human in vitro model for Merlin-deficient tumors, we report that the  Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein, extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase  (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) scaffold, kinase suppressor of  Ras 1 (KSR1), has a vital role in promoting schwannomas development. We show  that KSR1 overexpression is involved in many pathological phenotypes caused by  Merlin loss, namely multipolar morphology, enhanced cell-matrix adhesion, focal  adhesion and, most importantly, increased proliferation and survival. Our data  demonstrate that KSR1 has a wider role than MEK1/2 in the development of  schwannomas because adhesion is more dependent on KSR1 than MEK1/2.  Immunoprecipitation analysis reveals that KSR1 is a novel binding partner of  Merlin, which suppresses KSR1's function by inhibiting the binding between KSR1  and c-Raf. Our proteomic analysis also demonstrates that KSR1 interacts with  several Merlin downstream effectors, including E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4(DCAF1).  Further functional studies suggests that KSR1 and DCAF1 may co-operate to  regulate schwannomas formation. Taken together, these findings suggest that KSR1  serves as a potential therapeutic target for Merlin-deficient tumors.

AIMS: To develop an in vitro tool for assessing the efficacy and toxicity of  anticancer drugs using mixed culture containing both tumor and non-tumor cells.  Such in vitro tool should have high application potential in drug-screening and  personalized cancer care. METHODS: Fibroblasts were spiked as non-tumor cells into tumor cells of an  established line. The mixed culture was treated with a test drug at various  concentrations. After the treatment, DNA was prepared directly from the survived  adhesive cells in the wells of the 96-well plates using a simple and inexpensive  method, and subjected to digital PCR for measuring relative copy numbers of a  target gene NF1 to that of a reference gene RPP30. The NF1 gene is known to be  heterozygously deleted in these tumor cells while the RPP30 gene has two copies  in both tumor and non-tumor cells. Using the NF1/ RPP30 ratios resulting from  the dual digital PCR assay, the proportions of tumor cells were calculated for  each drug concentration. RESULTS: Digital PCR confirmed that the tumor cells have only one copy of the  NF1 gene while the non-tumor fibroblasts have two copies. By contrast, both  types of cells have two copies of the reference gene RPP30. Using the ratio of  the two genes, we successfully calculated the proportion of tumor cells which  decreased as the dose of the test drug increased up to a certain concentration,  indicating that the drug is more effective for the tumor cells than for the  non-tumor cells in this dose-range. At the highest dose, we observed a slight  increase in the proportion of tumor cells, likely reflecting the toxic effect of  the drug on both tumor and non-tumor cells. CONCLUSION: This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of a genetic- and  cell-based tool for testing efficacy and toxicity of anticancer drugs in vitro.  The promising results suggest that additional efforts are merited, for further  development since such a tool will likely have high application potential (1) in  drug discovery where it enables simultaneously assessing therapeutic effect on  target cells and toxic effect on non-target cells, and (2) in personalized  adjuvant chemotherapy where multiple drugs can be tested in primary cultures  derived from surgically removed tumor.

Schwannomatosis, a rare form of neurofibromatosis, is characterized  predominantly by multiple, often painful, schwannomas throughout the peripheral  nervous system. The current standard of care for schwannomatosis is surgical  resection. A major obstacle to schwannomatosis research is the lack of robust  tumor cell lines. There is a great need for mechanistic and drug discovery  studies of schwannomatosis, yet appropriate tools are not currently available.  Schwannomatosis tumors are difficult to grow in culture as they survive only a  few passages before senescence. Our lab has extensive experience in establishing  primary and immortalized human Schwann cell cultures from normal tissue that  retain their phenotypes after immortalization. Therefore we took on the  challenge of creating immortalized human Schwann cell lines derived from tumors  from schwannomatosis patients. We have established and fully characterized 2  schwannomatosis cell lines from 2 separate patients using SV40 virus large T  antigen. One patient reported pain and the other did not. The schwannomatosis  cell lines were stained with S100B antibodies to confirm Schwann cell identity.  The schwannomatosis cells also expressed the Schwann cell markers, p75NTR,  S100B, and NGF after multiple passages. Cell morphology was retained following  multiple passaging and freeze/ thaw cycles. Gene expression microarray analysis  was used to compare the cell lines with their respective parent tumors. No  differences in key genes were detected, with the exception that several cell  cycle regulators were upregulated in the schwannomatosis cell lines when  compared to their parent tumors. This upregulation was apparently a product of  cell culturing, as the schwannomatosis cells exhibited the same expression  pattern of cell cycle regulatory genes as normal primary human Schwann cells.  Cell growth was also similar between normal primary and immortalized tumor cells  in culture. Accurate cell lines derived directly from human tumors will serve as  invaluable tools for advancing schwannomatosis research, including drug  screening.

Congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia (CPT) is a rare disease which normally  presents itself during early childhood by anterolateral bowing of the tibia and  spontaneous tibial fractures. Although the exact etiology of CPT is highly  debated, 40-80% of CPT patients are carriers of a mutation in the  Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) gene, which can potentially result in an altered  phenotype of the skeletal cells and impaired bone healing. In this study we use  a computational model of bone regeneration to examine the effect of the Nf1  mutation on bone fracture healing by altering the parameter values of eight key  factors which describe the aberrant cellular behaviour of Nf1 haploinsufficient  and Nf1 bi-allelically inactivated cells. We show that the computational model  is able to predict the formation of a hamartoma as well as a wide variety of CPT  phenotypes through different combinations of altered parameter values. A  sensitivity analysis by ""Design of Experiments"" identified the impaired  endochondral ossification process and increased infiltration of fibroblastic  cells as key contributors to the degree of severity of CPT. Hence, the  computational model results have added credibility to the experimental  hypothesis of a genetic cause (i.e. Nf1 mutation) for CPT.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common neurogenetic disorder, in which  affected individuals develop tumors of the nervous system. Children with NF1 are  particularly prone to brain tumors (gliomas) involving the optic pathway that  can result in impaired vision. Since tumor formation and expansion requires a  cooperative tumor microenvironment, it is important to identify the cellular and  acellular components associated with glioma development and growth. In this  study, we used 3-D matrix assisted laser desorption ionization imaging mass  spectrometry (MALDI IMS) to measure the distributions of multiple molecular  species throughout optic nerve tissue in mice with and without glioma, and to  explore their spatial relationships within the 3-D volume of the optic nerve and  chiasm. 3-D IMS studies often involve extensive workflows due to the high volume  of sections required to generate high quality 3-D images. Herein, we present a  workflow for 3-D data acquisition and volume reconstruction using mouse optic  nerve tissue. The resulting 3-D IMS data yield both molecular similarities and  differences between glioma-bearing and wild-type (WT) tissues, including protein  distributions localizing to different anatomical subregions. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The current work addresses a number of challenges in  3-D MALDI IMS, driven by the small size of the mouse optic nerve and the need to  maintain consistency across multiple 2-D IMS experiments. The 3-D IMS data yield  both molecular similarities and differences between glioma-bearing and wild-type  (WT) tissues, including protein distributions localizing to different anatomical  subregions, which could then be targeted for identification and related back to  the biology observed in gliomas of the optic nerve.

To identify genes and signaling pathways that initiate Neurofibromatosis type 1  (NF1) neurofibromas, we used unbiased insertional mutagenesis screening, mouse  models, and molecular analyses. We mapped an Nf1-Stat3-Arid1b/β-catenin pathway  that becomes active in the context of Nf1 loss. Genetic deletion of Stat3 in  Schwann cell progenitors (SCPs) and Schwann cells (SCs) prevents neurofibroma  formation, decreasing SCP self-renewal and β-catenin activity. β-catenin  expression rescues effects of Stat3 loss in SCPs. Importantly, P-STAT3 and  β-catenin expression correlate in human neurofibromas. Mechanistically, P-Stat3  represses Gsk3β and the SWI/SNF gene Arid1b to increase β-catenin. Knockdown of  Arid1b or Gsk3β in Stat3(fl/fl);Nf1(fl/fl);DhhCre SCPs rescues neurofibroma  formation after in vivo transplantation. Stat3 represses Arid1b through histone  modification in a Brg1-dependent manner, indicating that epigenetic modification  plays a role in early tumorigenesis. Our data map a neural tumorigenesis pathway  and support testing JAK/STAT and Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibitors in  neurofibroma therapeutic trials.  Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder  affecting about 1 in 3,500 individuals. Chronic pain is commonly reported among  individuals with NF1 and plexiform neurofibroma tumors (PNs). Acceptance and  Commitment Therapy (ACT), an empirically supported method for addressing chronic  pain, helps individuals re-focus on valued relationships and activities. This  pilot study investigated the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a brief ACT  workshop in the NF1 population. Eligible participants included adolescents and  young adults (AYA; 12-21 years) with NF1 and chronic pain that interfered with  daily functioning and their parents. Patients and parents completed baseline  measures of pain interference, pain intensity, functional disability, pain  acceptance, depression, and anxiety. Then, AYA and parents participated  separately in a 2-day small-group ACT workshop. A telephone booster session  occurred 1 month post-intervention. Three-month post-treatment measures were  completed by mail. Ten adolescents (4 males; M age = 16.9 years) and seven  parents provided baseline and 3-month data. Mean satisfaction with the study was  moderate to high (3.9 for patients and 4.6 for parents on a 1-5 scales).  Patients and parents reported significant declines in patients' pain  interference at 3 months post-treatment. Patient-reported pain intensity  significantly declined from baseline to 3 months. Parents reported marginally  greater acceptance of their child's pain. No changes emerged in functional  ability or mood. Preliminary findings suggest that a brief ACT group  intervention is feasible and may help AYA with NF1 and PNs cope with their  chronic pain, although larger randomized studies are needed to confirm treatment  efficacy. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.  © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

OBJECTIVE: Lovastatin has been shown to reverse learning deficits in a mouse  model of Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1), a common monogenic disorder caused by a  mutation in the Ras-MAPK pathway and associated with learning disabilities. We  conducted a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to assess  lovastatin's effects on cognition and behavior in patients with NF1. METHOD: Forty-four NF1 patients (mean age 25.7+/-11.6 years; 64% female) were  randomly assigned to 14 weeks of lovastatin (N = 23; maximum dose of 80 mg/day  for adult participants and 40 mg/day for children) or placebo (N = 21). Based on  findings in the mouse model, primary outcome measures were nonverbal learning  and working memory. Secondary outcome measures included verbal memory,  attention, and self/parent-reported behavioral problems, as well as tolerability  of medication. Participants also underwent neuroimaging assessments at baseline  and 14 weeks, to determine whether neural biomarkers were associated with  treatment response. Linear mixed models assessed for differential treatment  effects on outcome measures. RESULTS: Twelve participants dropped from the study prior to completion (8  placebo, 4 lovastatin), resulting in 32 completers (15 placebo, 17 lovastatin).  Lovastatin was well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events. Differential  improvement favoring lovastatin treatment was observed for one primary (working  memory; effect size f (2) = 0.70, P < 0.01) and two secondary outcome measures  (verbal memory, f (2) = 0.19, P = 0.02, and adult self-reported internalizing  problems, f (2) = 0.26, P = 0.03). Exploratory moderator analyses revealed that  higher baseline neural activity in frontal regions was associated with larger  treatment effects. INTERPRETATION: These preliminary results suggest beneficial effects of  lovastatin on some learning and memory functions, as well as internalizing  symptoms in patients with NF1.

Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is a neurogenetic disease marked by multiple  cognitive and learning problems. Genetic variants may account for phenotypic  variance in NF1. Here, we investigated the association between the  catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val(158)Met polymorphism and working memory  and arithmetic performance in 50 NF1 individuals. A significant association of  the COMT polymorphism was observed only with verbal working memory, as measured  by the backward digit-span task with an advantageous performance for Met/Met  carriers. To study how genetic modifiers influence NF1 cognitive performance  might be of importance to decrease the unpredictability of the cognitive profile  among NF1 patients.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is associated with neurocognitive deficits that  can impact everyday functioning of children, adolescents, and adults with this  disease. However, there is little agreement regarding measures to use as  cognitive endpoints in clinical trials. This article describes the work of the  Neurocognitive Committee of the Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and  Schwannomatosis (REiNS) International Collaboration. The goal of this committee  is to identify standardized and specific cognitive assessment tools for use in  NF clinical trials. The committee first identified cognitive domains relevant to  NF1 and prioritized attention as the first domain of focus given prior and  current trends in NF1 cognitive clinical trials. Performance measures and  behavioral rating questionnaires of attention were reviewed by the group using  established criteria to assess patient characteristics, psychometric properties,  and feasibility. The highest rated tests underwent side-by-side comparison. The  Digit Span subtest from the Wechsler scales was given the highest ratings of the  performance measures due to its good psychometrics, feasibility, utility across  a wide age range, and extensive use in previous research. The Conners scales  achieved the highest ratings of the behavioral questionnaires for similar  reasons. Future articles will focus on other cognitive domains, with the  ultimate goal of achieving agreement for cognitive endpoints that can be used  across NF clinical trials.  © 2016 American Academy of Neurology.

OBJECTIVE: Tumors and other disease complications of neurofibromatosis (NF) can  cause pain and negatively affect physical functioning. To document the clinical  benefit of treatment in NF trials targeting these manifestations,  patient-reported outcomes (PROs) assessing pain and physical functioning should  be included as study endpoints. Currently, there is no consensus on the  selection and use of such measures in the NF population. This article presents  the recommendations of the PRO group of the Response Evaluation in  Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) International Collaboration for  assessing the domains of pain and physical functioning for NF clinical trials. METHODS: The REiNS PRO group reviewed and rated existing PRO measures assessing  pain intensity, pain interference, and physical functioning using their  systematic method. Final recommendations are based primarily on 4 main criteria:  patient characteristics, item content, psychometric properties, and feasibility  for clinical trials. RESULTS: The REiNS PRO group chose the Numeric Rating Scale-11 (≥8 years) to  assess pain intensity, the Pain Interference Index (6-24 years) and the  Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Pain  Interference Scale (≥18 years) to evaluate pain interference, and the PROMIS  Physical Functioning Scale to measure upper extremity function and mobility (≥5  years) for NF clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: The REiNS Collaboration currently recommends these PRO measures to  assess the domains of pain and physical functioning for NF clinical trials;  however, further research is needed to evaluate their use in individuals with  NF. A final consensus recommendation for the pain interference measure will be  disseminated in a future publication based on findings from additional published  research.  © 2016 American Academy of Neurology.

IMPORTANCE: Recent reports have demonstrated a higher incidence of autism  spectrum disorder (ASD) and substantially elevated autistic trait burden in  individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). However, important  discrepancies regarding the distribution of autistic traits, sex predominance,  and association between ASD symptoms and attentional problems have emerged, and  critical features of the ASD phenotype within NF1 have never been adequately  explored. Establishing NF1 as a monogenic cause for ASD has important  implications for affected patients and for future research focused on  establishing convergent pathogenic mechanisms relevant to the potential  treatment targets for ASD. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the quantitative autistic trait (QAT) burden in a  pooled NF1 data set. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Anonymized, individual-level primary data  were accumulated from 6 tertiary referral centers in the United States, Belgium,  United Kingdom, and Australia. A total of 531 individuals recruited from NF1  clinical centers were included in the study. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Distribution of ASD traits (Social Responsiveness  Scale, second edition [SRS-2], with T scores of ≥75 associated with a  categorical ASD diagnosis); attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)  traits (4 versions of Conners Rating Scale, with T scores of ≥65 indicating  clinically significant ADHD symptoms); ASD symptom structure, latent structure,  base rate derived from mixture modeling; and familiality. RESULTS: Of the 531 patients included in the analysis, 247 were male (46.5%);  median age was 11 years (range, 2.5-83.9 years). QAT scores were continuously  distributed and pathologically shifted; 13.2% (95% CI, 10.3%-16.1%) of  individuals scored within the most severe range (ie, above the first percentile  of the general population distribution) in which the male to female ratio was  markedly attenuated (1.6:1) relative to idiopathic ASD. Autistic symptoms in  this NF1 cohort demonstrated a robust unitary factor structure, with the first  principal component explaining 30.9% of the variance in SRS-2 scores, and a  strong association with ADHD symptoms (r = 0.61). Within-family correlation for  QAT burden (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.73 in NF1-affected  first-degree relatives) exceeded that observed in the general population and ASD  family samples. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study provides confirmation that the diversity  of mutations that give rise to NF1 function as quantitative trait loci for ASD.  Moreover, the within-family correlation implicates a high degree of mutational  specificity for this associated phenotype. Clinicians should be alerted to the  increased frequency of this disabling comorbidity, and the scientific community  should be aware of the potential for this monogenic disorder to help elucidate  the biological features of idiopathic autism.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether tumor size is associated with retinal nerve  fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, a measure of axonal degeneration and an  established biomarker of visual impairment in children with optic pathway  gliomas (OPGs) secondary to neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). METHODS: Children with NF1-OPGs involving the optic nerve (extension into the  chiasm and tracts permitted) who underwent both volumetric MRI analysis and  optical coherence tomography (OCT) within 2 weeks of each other were included.  Volumetric measurement of the entire anterior visual pathway (AVP; optic nerve,  chiasm, and tract) was performed using high-resolution T1-weighted MRI. OCT  measured the average RNFL thickness around the optic nerve. Linear regression  models evaluated the relationship between RNFL thickness and AVP dimensions and  volume. RESULTS: Thirty-eight participants contributed 55 study eyes. The mean age was  5.78 years. Twenty-two participants (58%) were female. RNFL thickness had a  significant negative relationship to total AVP volume and total brain volume (p  < 0.05, all comparisons). For every 1 mL increase in AVP volume, RNFL thickness  declined by approximately 5 microns. A greater AVP volume of OPGs involving the  optic nerve and chiasm, but not the tracts, was independently associated with a  lower RNFL thickness (p < 0.05). All participants with an optic chiasm volume  >1.3 mL demonstrated axonal damage (i.e., RNFL thickness <80 microns). CONCLUSIONS: Greater OPG and AVP volume predicts axonal degeneration, a  biomarker of vision loss, in children with NF1-OPGs. MRI volumetric measures may  help stratify the risk of visual loss from NF1-OPGs.  © 2016 American Academy of Neurology.

TOPIC: Children and adults with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a common  autosomal dominant condition, manifest a variety of ophthalmologic conditions.  Plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) involving the eyelid, orbit, periorbital, and  facial structures (orbital-periorbital plexiform neurofibroma [OPPN]) can result  in significant visual loss in children. Equally important, OPPNs can cause  significant alteration in physical appearance secondary to proptosis, ptosis,  and facial disfigurement, leading to social embarrassment and decreased  self-esteem. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Although NF1 is a relatively common disease in which routine  ophthalmologic examinations are required, no formal recommendations for clinical  care of children with OPPNs exist. Although medical and surgical interventions  have been reported, there are no agreed-on criteria for when OPPNs require  therapy and which treatment produces the best outcome. METHODS: Because a multidisciplinary team of specialists (oculofacial plastics,  pediatric ophthalmology, neuro-ophthalmology, medical genetics, and  neuro-oncology) direct management decisions, the absence of a uniform outcome  measure that represents visual or aesthetic sequelae complicates the design of  evidence-based studies and feasible clinical trials. RESULTS: In September 2013, a multidisciplinary task force, composed of  pediatric practitioners from tertiary care centers experienced in caring for  children with OPPN, was convened to address the lack of clinical care guidelines  for children with OPPN. CONCLUSIONS: This consensus statement provides recommendations for  ophthalmologic monitoring, outlines treatment indications and forthcoming  biologic therapy, and discusses challenges to performing clinical trials in this  complicated condition.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the specificity of the current clinical diagnostic  criteria for neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) relative to the requirement for  unilateral vestibular schwannoma (VS) and at least 2 other NF2-related tumors. METHODS: We interrogated our Manchester NF2 database, which contained 205  individuals meeting NF2 criteria who initially presented with a unilateral VS.  Of these, 83 (40.7%) went on to develop a contralateral VS. We concentrated our  genetic analysis on a group of 70 who initially fulfilled NF2 criteria with a  unilateral vestibular schwannoma and at least 2 additional nonintradermal  schwannomas. RESULTS: Overall, 5/70 (7%) individuals with unilateral VS and at least 2 other  schwannomas had a pathogenic or likely pathogenic LZTR1 mutation. Twenty of the  70 subsequently developed bilateral disease. Of the remaining 50, 5 (10%) had a  germline LZTR1 mutation, equivalent to the number (n = 5) with a germline NF2  mutation. CONCLUSIONS: The most common etiology for unilateral VS and 2 additional  NF2-associated tumors in this cohort was mosaic NF2. Germline LZTR1 and germline  NF2 mutations were equally common in our cohort. This indicates that LZTR1 must  be considered when making a diagnosis of NF2 in the presence of unilateral VS in  individuals without a germline NF2 mutation.  © 2016 American Academy of Neurology.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: It has been a challenge to identify liver tumor suppressors  or oncogenes due to the genetic heterogeneity of these tumors. We performed a  genome-wide screen to identify suppressors of liver tumor formation in mice,  using CRISPR-mediated genome editing. METHODS: We performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-based knockout screen of  P53-null mouse embryonic liver progenitor cells that overexpressed MYC. We  infected p53-/-;Myc;Cas9 hepatocytes with the mGeCKOa lentiviral library of  67,000 single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs), targeting 20,611 mouse genes, and  transplanted the transduced cells subcutaneously into nude mice. Within 1 month,  all the mice that received the sgRNA library developed subcutaneous tumors. We  performed high-throughput sequencing of tumor DNA and identified sgRNAs  increased at least 8-fold compared to the initial cell pool. To validate the top  10 candidate tumor suppressors from this screen, we collected data from patients  with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using the Cancer Genome Atlas and COSMIC  databases. We used CRISPR to inactivate candidate tumor suppressor genes in  p53-/-;Myc;Cas9 cells and transplanted them subcutaneously into nude mice; tumor  formation was monitored and tumors were analyzed by histology and  immunohistochemistry. Mice with liver-specific disruption of p53 were given  hydrodynamic tail-vein injections of plasmids encoding Myc and sgRNA/Cas9  designed to disrupt candidate tumor suppressors; growth of tumors and metastases  was monitored. We compared gene expression profiles of liver cells with vs  without tumor suppressor gene disrupted by sgRNA/Cas9. Genes found to be  up-regulated after tumor suppressor loss were examined in liver cancer cell  lines; their expression was knocked down using small hairpin RNAs, and tumor  growth was examined in nude mice. Effects of the MEK inhibitors AZD6244, U0126,  and trametinib, or the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib, were examined in human  and mouse HCC cell lines. RESULTS: We identified 4 candidate liver tumor suppressor genes not previously  associated with liver cancer (Nf1, Plxnb1, Flrt2, and B9d1). CRISPR-mediated  knockout of Nf1, a negative regulator of RAS, accelerated liver tumor formation  in mice. Loss of Nf1 or activation of RAS up-regulated the liver progenitor cell  markers HMGA2 and SOX9. RAS pathway inhibitors suppressed the activation of the  Hmga2 and Sox9 genes that resulted from loss of Nf1 or oncogenic activation of  RAS. Knockdown of HMGA2 delayed formation of xenograft tumors from cells that  expressed oncogenic RAS. In human HCCs, low levels of NF1 messenger RNA or high  levels of HMGA2 messenger RNA were associated with shorter patient survival  time. Liver cancer cells with inactivation of Plxnb1, Flrt2, and B9d1 formed  more tumors in mice and had increased levels of mitogen-activated protein kinase  phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: Using a CRISPR-based strategy, we identified Nf1, Plxnb1, Flrt2,  and B9d1 as suppressors of liver tumor formation. We validated the observation  that RAS signaling, via mitogen-activated protein kinase, contributes to  formation of liver tumors in mice. We associated decreased levels of NF1 and  increased levels of its downstream protein HMGA2 with survival times of patients  with HCC. Strategies to inhibit or reduce HMGA2 might be developed to treat  patients with liver cancer.  Copyright © 2017 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of lovastatin on visuospatial learning and  attention for treating cognitive and behavioral deficits in children with  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). METHODS: A multicenter, international, randomized, double-blind,  placebo-controlled trial was conducted between July 2009 and May 2014 as part of  the NF Clinical Trials Consortium. Children with NF1 aged 8-15 years were  screened for visuospatial learning or attention deficits (n = 272); 146 children  demonstrated deficits at baseline and were randomly assigned to lovastatin (n =  74; 40 mg/d) or placebo (n = 70). Treatment was administered once daily for 16  weeks. Primary outcomes were total errors on the Cambridge Neuropsychological  Test Automated Battery Paired Associate Learning task (visuospatial learning)  and the Score subtest from the Test of Everyday Attention for Children  (sustained attention). Secondary outcomes measured executive function,  attention, visuospatial skills, behavior, and quality of life. Primary analyses  were performed on the intention-to-treat population. RESULTS: Lovastatin had no significant effect on primary outcomes after 16 weeks  of treatment: visuospatial learning (Cohen d = -0.15, 95% confidence interval  -0.47 to 0.18) or sustained attention (Cohen d = 0.19, 95% confidence interval  -0.14 to 0.53). Lovastatin was well tolerated, with no increase in reported  adverse events compared to placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Lovastatin administered once daily for 16 weeks did not improve  visuospatial learning or attention in children with NF1 and is not recommended  for amelioration of cognitive deficits in this population. CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov  (NCT00853580) and Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry  (ACTRN12607000560493). CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class I evidence that for  children with NF1, lovastatin does not improve visuospatial learning or  attention deficits.  © 2016 American Academy of Neurology.

Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is one of the most common genetic disorders and is  caused by mutations in the NF1 gene. NF1 gene mutational analysis presents a  considerable challenge because of its large size, existence of highly homologous  pseudogenes located throughout the human genome, absence of mutational hotspots,  and diversity of mutations types, including deep intronic splicing mutations. We  aimed to evaluate the use of hybridization capture-based next-generation  sequencing to screen coding and noncoding NF1 regions. Hybridization  capture-based next-generation sequencing, with genomic DNA as starting material,  was used to sequence the whole NF1 gene (exons and introns) from 11 unrelated  individuals and 1 relative, who all had NF1. All of them met the NF1 clinical  diagnostic criteria. We showed a mutation detection rate of 91% (10 out of 11).  We identified eight recurrent and two novel mutations, which were all confirmed  by Sanger methodology. In the Sanger sequencing confirmation, we also included  another three relatives with NF1. Splicing alterations accounted for 50% of the  mutations. One of them was caused by a deep intronic mutation (c.1260 + 1604A >  G). Frameshift truncation and missense mutations corresponded to 30% and 20% of  the pathogenic variants, respectively. In conclusion, we show the use of a  simple and fast approach to screen, at once, the entire NF1 gene (exons and  introns) for different types of pathogenic variations, including the deep  intronic splicing mutations.

BACKGROUND: Effective medical therapies are lacking for the treatment of  neurofibromatosis type 1-related plexiform neurofibromas, which are  characterized by elevated RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. METHODS: We conducted a phase 1 trial of selumetinib (AZD6244 or ARRY-142886),  an oral selective inhibitor of MAPK kinase (MEK) 1 and 2, in children who had  neurofibromatosis type 1 and inoperable plexiform neurofibromas to determine the  maximum tolerated dose and to evaluate plasma pharmacokinetics. Selumetinib was  administered twice daily at a dose of 20 to 30 mg per square meter of  body-surface area on a continuous dosing schedule (in 28-day cycles). We also  tested selumetinib using a mouse model of neurofibromatosis type 1-related  neurofibroma. Response to treatment (i.e., an increase or decrease from baseline  in the volume of plexiform neurofibromas) was monitored by using volumetric  magnetic resonance imaging analysis to measure the change in size of the  plexiform neurofibroma. RESULTS: A total of 24 children (median age, 10.9 years; range, 3.0 to 18.5)  with a median tumor volume of 1205 ml (range, 29 to 8744) received selumetinib.  Patients were able to receive selumetinib on a long-term basis; the median  number of cycles was 30 (range, 6 to 56). The maximum tolerated dose was 25 mg  per square meter (approximately 60% of the recommended adult dose). The most  common toxic effects associated with selumetinib included acneiform rash,  gastrointestinal effects, and asymptomatic creatine kinase elevation. The  results of pharmacokinetic evaluations of selumetinib among the children in this  trial were similar to those published for adults. Treatment with selumetinib  resulted in confirmed partial responses (tumor volume decreases from baseline of  ≥20%) in 17 of the 24 children (71%) and decreases from baseline in neurofibroma  volume in 12 of 18 mice (67%). Disease progression (tumor volume increase from  baseline of ≥20%) has not been observed to date. Anecdotal evidence of decreases  in tumor-related pain, disfigurement, and functional impairment was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our early-phase data suggested that children with neurofibromatosis  type 1 and inoperable plexiform neurofibromas benefited from long-term  dose-adjusted treatment with selumetinib without having excess toxic effects.

We wanted to implement an NGS strategy to globally analyze hereditary cancer  with diagnostic quality while retaining the same degree of understanding and  control we had in pre-NGS strategies. To do this, we developed the I2HCP panel,  a custom bait library covering 122 hereditary cancer genes. We improved bait  design, tested different NGS platforms and created a clinically driven custom  data analysis pipeline. The I2HCP panel was developed using a training set of  hereditary colorectal cancer, hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and  neurofibromatosis patients and reached an accuracy, analytical sensitivity and  specificity greater than 99%, which was maintained in a validation set. I2HCP  changed our diagnostic approach, involving clinicians and a genetic diagnostics  team from panel design to reporting. The new strategy improved diagnostic  sensitivity, solved uncertain clinical diagnoses and identified mutations in new  genes. We assessed the genetic variation in the complete set of hereditary  cancer genes, revealing a complex variation landscape that coexists with the  disease-causing mutation. We developed, validated and implemented a custom  NGS-based strategy for hereditary cancer diagnostics that improved our previous  workflows. Additionally, the existence of a rich genetic variation in hereditary  cancer genes favors the use of this panel to investigate their role in cancer  risk.

The variable manifestation of phenotypes that occur in patients with  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) includes benign and malignant neurocutaneous  tumors for which no adequate treatment exists. Cell-based screening of known  bioactive compounds library identified the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)  inhibitor Cantharidin and the L-type calcium channel blocker Nifedipine as  potential candidates for NF1 pharmacotherapy. Validation of screening results  using human NF1-associated malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) cells  showed that Cantharidin effectively impeded MPNST cell growth, while Nifedipine  treatment significantly decreased local tumor growth in an MPNST xenograft  animal model. These data suggest that inhibitors of PP2A, as well as calcium  channel blockers, might be used in broader MPNST preclinical studies as single  agents or in combinatorial therapeutic strategies.

Loss or mutation of the tumour suppressor Merlin predisposes individuals to  develop multiple nervous system tumours, including schwannomas and meningiomas,  sporadically or as part of the autosomal dominant inherited condition  Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2). These tumours display largely low grade features but  their presence can lead to significant morbidity. Surgery and radiotherapy  remain the only treatment options despite years of research, therefore an  effective therapeutic is required. Unbiased omics studies have become pivotal in  the identification of differentially expressed genes and proteins that may act  as drug targets or biomarkers. Here we analysed the proteome and  phospho-proteome of these genetically defined tumours using primary human tumour  cells to identify upregulated/activated proteins and/or pathways. We identified  over 2000 proteins in comparative experiments between Merlin-deficient  schwannoma and meningioma compared to human Schwann and meningeal cells  respectively. Using functional enrichment analysis we highlighted several  dysregulated pathways and Gene Ontology terms. We identified several proteins  and phospho-proteins that are more highly expressed in tumours compared to  controls. Among proteins jointly dysregulated in both tumours we focused in  particular on PDZ and LIM domain protein 2 (PDLIM2) and validated its  overexpression in several tumour samples, while not detecting it in normal  cells. We showed that shRNA mediated knockdown of PDLIM2 in both primary  meningioma and schwannoma leads to significant reductions in cellular  proliferation. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive assessment of  the NF2-related meningioma and schwannoma proteome and phospho-proteome. Taken  together, our data highlight several commonly deregulated factors, and indicate  that PDLIM2 may represent a novel, common target for meningioma and schwannoma.  Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

BACKGROUND: We have identified molecules that exhibit synthetic lethality in  cells with loss of the neurofibromin 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor gene. However,  recognizing tumors that have inactivation of the NF1 tumor suppressor function  is challenging because the loss may occur via mechanisms that do not involve  mutation of the genomic locus. Degradation of the NF1 protein, independent of  NF1 mutation status, phenocopies inactivating mutations to drive tumors in human  glioma cell lines. NF1 inactivation may alter the transcriptional landscape of a  tumor and allow a machine learning classifier to detect which tumors will  benefit from synthetic lethal molecules. RESULTS: We developed a strategy to predict tumors with low NF1 activity and  hence tumors that may respond to treatments that target cells lacking NF1. Using  RNAseq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we trained an ensemble of 500  logistic regression classifiers that integrates mutation status with whole  transcriptomes to predict NF1 inactivation in glioblastoma (GBM). On TCGA data,  the classifier detected NF1 mutated tumors (test set area under the receiver  operating characteristic curve (AUROC) mean = 0.77, 95% quantile = 0.53 - 0.95)  over 50 random initializations. On RNA-Seq data transformed into the space of  gene expression microarrays, this method produced a classifier with similar  performance (test set AUROC mean = 0.77, 95% quantile = 0.53 - 0.96). We applied  our ensemble classifier trained on the transformed TCGA data to a microarray  validation set of 12 samples with matched RNA and NF1 protein-level  measurements. The classifier's NF1 score was associated with NF1 protein  concentration in these samples. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that TCGA can be used to train accurate predictors  of NF1 inactivation in GBM. The ensemble classifier performed well for samples  with very high or very low NF1 protein concentrations but had mixed performance  in samples with intermediate NF1 concentrations. Nevertheless, high-performing  and validated predictors have the potential to be paired with targeted therapies  and personalized medicine.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is an inherited, multi-system, tumour  suppressor disorder with variable complications that cause psychological  distress and social isolation. The study aim was to develop and validate a  disease-specific questionnaire to measure quality of life (QOL) in NF1 that is  suitable both as an assessment tool in clinical practice and in clinical trials  of novel therapy. METHODS: The Impact of NF1 on Quality of Life (INF1-QOL) questionnaire was  developed by a literature search for common terms, focus group (n = 6),  semi-structured interviews (n = 21), initial drafts (n =50) and final 14 item  questionnaire (n = 50). Bivariate correlations between items, exploratory factor  analysis, correlations with severity and EuroQol were employed. RESULTS: INF1-QOL showed good internal reliability (Cronbach's alpha 0.87), mean  total INF1-QOL score was 8.64 (SD 6.3), median 7.00, range 0-30 (possible range  0-42); no significant correlations with age or gender. The mean total EuroQol  score was 7.38 (SD 2.87), median 6.5, mean global EuroQol score was 76.34 (SD  16.56), median 80. Total INF1-QOL score correlated with total EuroQol r = 0.82,  p < 0.0001. The highest impact on QOL was moderate or severe problems with  anxiety and depression (32%) and negative effects of NF1 on role and outlook on  life (42%). The mean inter-relater reliability for grading of clinical severity  scores was 0.71 (range 0.65-0.79), and intra-class correlation was 0.92. The  mean clinical severity score was 1.95 (SD 0.65) correlating r = 0.34 with total  INF1-QOL score p < 0.05 and correlated 0.37 with total EuroQol score p < 0.01.  The clinical severity score was mild in 17 (34%), moderate in 16 (32%) and 17  (34%) individuals had severe disease. CONCLUSIONS: INF1-QOL is a validated, reliable disease specific questionnaire  that is easy and quick to complete. Role and outlook on life and anxiety and  depression have the highest impact on QOL indicating the variability, severity  and unpredictability of NF1. INFI-QOL correlates moderately with clinical  severity. The moderate relationship between INF1-QOL and physician rated  severity emphasizes the difference between clinical and patient perception.  INFI-QOL will be useful in individual patient assessment and as an outcome  measure for clinical trials.

Macrophages are abundant in neurofibromas, and macrophage targeted  interventions may have therapeutic potential in these tumors. We generated gene  expression data from fluorescence-activated cell sorted (FACS) SCs and  macrophages from wild-type and mutant nerve and neurofibroma to identify  candidate pathways involved in SC-macrophage cross-talk. While in 1-month-old  Nf1 mutant nerve neither SCs nor macrophages significantly differed from their  normal counterparts, both macrophages and SCs showed significantly altered  cytokine gene expression in neurofibromas. Computationally reconstructed  SC-macrophage molecular networks were enriched for inflammation-associated  pathways. We verified that neurofibroma SC conditioned medium contains  macrophage chemo-attractants including colony stimulation factor 1 (CSF1).  Network analysis confirmed previously implicated pathways and predict novel  paracrine and autocrine loops involving cytokines, chemokines, and growth  factors. Network analysis also predicted a central role for decreased type-I  interferon signaling. We validated type-I interferon expression in neurofibroma  by protein profiling, and show that treatment of neurofibroma-bearing mice with  polyethylene glycolyated (PEGylated) type-I interferon-α2b reduces the  expression of many cytokines overexpressed in neurofibroma. These studies reveal  numerous potential targetable interactions between Nf1 mutant SCs and  macrophages for further analyses.

The future of precision medicine is heavily reliant on the use of human tissues  to identify the key determinants that account for differences between  individuals with the same disorder. This need is exemplified by the  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) neurogenetic condition. As such, individuals with  NF1 are born with a germline mutation in the NF1 gene, but may develop numerous  distinct neurological problems, ranging from autism and attention deficit to  brain and peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Coupled with accurate preclinical  mouse models, the availability of NF1 patient-derived induced pluripotent stem  cells (iPSCs) provides new opportunities to define the critical factors that  underlie NF1-associated nervous system disease pathogenesis and progression. In  this review, we discuss the generation and potential applications of iPSC  technology to the study of NF1.  Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Low-grade gliomas are one of the most common brain tumors in children, where  they frequently form within the optic pathway (optic pathway gliomas; OPGs).  Since many OPGs occur in the context of the Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1)  cancer predisposition syndrome, we have previously employed Nf1  genetically-engineered mouse (GEM) strains to study the pathogenesis of these  low-grade glial neoplasms. In the light of the finding that human and mouse  low-grade gliomas are composed of Olig2+ cells and that Olig2+ oligodendrocyte  precursor cells (OPCs) give rise to murine high-grade gliomas, we sought to  determine whether Olig2+ OPCs could be tumor-initiating cells for Nf1 optic  glioma. Similar to the GFAP-Cre transgenic strain previously employed to  generate Nf1 optic gliomas, Olig2+ cells also give rise to astrocytes in the  murine optic nerve in vivo. However, in contrast to the GFAP-Cre strain where  somatic Nf1 inactivation in embryonic neural progenitor/stem cells (Nf1flox/mut;  GFAP-Cre mice) results in optic gliomas by 3 months of age in vivo, mice with  Nf1 gene inactivation in Olig2+ OPCs (Nf1flox/mut; Olig2-Cre mice) do not form  optic gliomas until 6 months of age. These distinct patterns of glioma latency  do not reflect differences in the timing or brain location of somatic Nf1 loss.  Instead, they most likely reflect the cell of origin, as somatic Nf1 loss in  CD133+ neural progenitor/stem cells during late embryogenesis results in optic  gliomas at 3 months of age. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the cell  of origin dictates the time to tumorigenesis in murine optic glioma.

Despite the growing knowledge of the genetic background behind the cancers that  occur in a context of hereditary predisposition, personal or family cancer  history may not be clear enough to support directional gene testing. Defined  targeted next-generation sequencing gene panels allow identification of the  causative disease mutations of multigene syndromes and differential diagnosis  for syndromes with phenotypically overlapping characteristics. Herein, we  established a next-generation sequencing analysis pipeline for the molecular  diagnosis of multiple inherited cancer predisposing syndromes using the  commercially available target sequencing panel TruSight Cancer. To establish the  analysis pipeline, we included 22 control samples with deleterious mutations  covering all genes currently analyzed at our institution by standard Sanger  sequencing. We tested the pipeline using 51 samples from patients with a  clinical diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), 10 of which without  previous molecular characterization of the causative NF1 mutations. We propose a  thoroughly validated analysis pipeline that combines Isaac Enrichment,  Burrows-Wheeler Aligner Enrichment, and NextGENe for the alignment and variant  calling, and GeneticistAssistant for variant annotation and prioritization. This  pipeline allowed the identification of disease-causing mutations in all 73  patients, including a large duplication of 37 bp in NF1. We show that high  sensitivity and specificity can be achieved by using multiple bioinformatic  tools for alignment and variant calling and careful variant filtering, having in  mind the clinical question.

Benign neurofibromas, the main phenotypic manifestations of the rare  neurological disorder neurofibromatosis type 1, degenerate to malignant tumors  associated to poor prognosis in about 10% of patients. Despite efforts in the  field of (epi)genomics, the lack of prognostic biomarkers with which to predict  disease evolution frustrates the adoption of appropriate early therapeutic  measures. To identify potential biomarkers of malignant neurofibroma  transformation, we integrated four human experimental studies and one for mouse,  using a gene score-based meta-analysis method, from which we obtained a  score-ranked signature of 579 genes. Genes with the highest absolute scores were  classified as promising disease biomarkers. By grouping genes with similar  neurofibromatosis-related profiles, we derived panels of potential biomarkers.  The addition of promoter methylation data to gene profiles indicated a panel of  genes probably silenced by hypermethylation. To identify possible therapeutic  treatments, we used the gene signature to query drug expression databases.  Trichostatin A and other histone deacetylase inhibitors, as well as cantharidin  and tamoxifen, were retrieved as putative therapeutic means to reverse the  aberrant regulation that drives to malignant cell proliferation and metastasis.  This in silico prediction corroborated reported experimental results that  suggested the inclusion of these compounds in clinical trials. This experimental  validation supported the suitability of the meta-analysis method used to  integrate several sources of public genomic information, and the reliability of  the gene signature associated to the malignant evolution of neurofibromas to  generate working hypotheses for prognostic and drug-responsive biomarkers or  therapeutic measures, thus showing the potential of this in silico approach for  biomarker discovery.

PURPOSE: Measurement of heterogeneity in 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG)  positron emission tomography (PET) images is reported to improve tumour  phenotyping and response assessment in a number of cancers. We aimed to  determine whether measurements of 18F-FDG heterogeneity could improve  differentiation of benign symptomatic neurofibromas from malignant peripheral  nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs). METHODS: 18F-FDG PET data from a cohort of 54 patients (24 female, 30 male, mean  age 35.1 years) with neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1), and clinically suspected  malignant transformation of neurofibromas into MPNSTs, were included. Scans were  performed to a standard clinical protocol at 1.5 and 4 h post-injection. Six  first-order [including three standardised uptake value (SUV) parameters],  four second-order (derived from grey-level co-occurrence matrices) and four  high-order (derived from neighbourhood grey-tone difference matrices)  statistical features were calculated from tumour volumes of interest. Each  patient had histological verification or at least 5 years clinical follow-up as  the reference standard with regards to the characterisation of tumours as benign  (n = 30) or malignant (n = 24). RESULTS: There was a significant difference between benign and malignant tumours  for all six first-order parameters (at 1.5 and 4 h; p < 0.0001), for  second-order entropy (only at 4 h) and for all high-order features (at 1.5 h and  4 h, except contrast at 4 h; p < 0.0001-0.047). Similarly, the area under the  receiver operating characteristic curves was high (0.669-0.997, p < 0.05) for  the same features as well as 1.5-h second-order entropy. No first-, second- or  high-order feature performed better than maximum SUV (SUVmax) at differentiating  benign from malignant tumours. CONCLUSIONS: 18F-FDG uptake in MPNSTs is higher than benign symptomatic  neurofibromas, as defined by SUV parameters, and more heterogeneous, as defined  by first- and high-order heterogeneity parameters. However, heterogeneity  analysis does not improve on SUVmax discriminative performance.

The neurofibromatoses (neurofibromatosis type 1, neurofibromatosis type 2 and  schwannomatosis) are rare disorders having clinical manifestations that vary  greatly from patient to patient. The rarity and variability of these disorders  has made it challenging for investigators to identify sufficient numbers of  patients with particular clinical characteristics or specific germline mutations  for participation in interventional studies. Similarly, because the natural  history of all types of neurofibromatosis (NF) is variable and unique for each  individual, it is difficult to identify meaningful clinical outcome measures for  potential therapeutic interventions. In 2012, the Children's Tumor Foundation  created a web-based patient-entered database, the NF Registry, to inform  patients of research opportunities for which they fit general eligibility  criteria and enable patients to contact investigators who are seeking to enroll  patients in approved trials. Registrants were recruited through CTF-affiliated  NF clinics and conferences, through its website, and by word-of-mouth and social  media. Following online consent, demographic information and details regarding  manifestations of NF were solicited on the Registry website. Statistical  analyses were performed on data from a cohort of 4680 registrants (the number of  registrants as of October 9, 2015) who met diagnostic criteria for one of the 3  NF conditions. The analyses support our hypothesis that patient-reported symptom  incidences in the NF Registry are congruent with published clinician-sourced  data. Between April 26, 2013 and July 8, 2016, the registry has been useful to  investigators in recruitment, particularly for observational trials, especially  those for development of patient-reported outcomes.

Cognitively, NF1 is  characterized by difficulties with executive control and visuospatial abilities.  Little is known about the neural substrates underlying these deficits. The  current study utilized Blood-Oxygen-Level-Dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI)  to explore the neural correlates of spatial working memory (WM) deficits in  patients with NF1. METHODS: BOLD images were acquired from 23 adults with NF1 (age M = 32.69; 61%  male) and 25 matched healthy controls (age M = 33.08; 64% male) during an  in-scanner visuo-spatial WM task. Whole brain functional and  psycho-physiological interaction analyses were utilized to investigate neural  activity and functional connectivity, respectively, during visuo-spatial WM  performance. Participants also completed behavioral measures of spatial  reasoning and verbal WM. RESULTS: Relative to healthy controls, participants with NF1 showed reduced  recruitment of key components of WM circuitry, the left dorsolateral prefrontal  cortex and right parietal cortex. In addition, healthy controls exhibited  greater simultaneous deactivation between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)  and temporal regions than NF1 patients. In contrast, NF1 patients showed greater  PCC and bilateral parietal connectivity with visual cortices as well as between  the PCC and the cerebellum. In NF1 participants, increased functional coupling  of the PCC with frontal and parietal regions was associated with better spatial  reasoning and WM performance, respectively; these relationships were not  observed in controls. CONCLUSIONS: Dysfunctional engagement of WM circuitry, and aberrant functional  connectivity of 'task-negative' regions in NF1 patients may underlie spatial WM  difficulties characteristic of the disorder.

Children and adolescents with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are at increased  risk for wide-ranging behavioral, developmental, and cognitive impairments and  decreased quality of life. To date, no psychosocial screening tool has been  developed to quickly assess the symptoms that 1) can be addressed during routine  medical appointments in children with NF1, 2) can produce interpretable and  actionable results, 3) can be integrated into medical care, and 4) can quickly  identify patients at risk in order to better address that the provision of  appropriate care are available. This study was conducted to test the overall  usability of the Distress Thermometer (DT) and symptom checklist and concordance  of DT ratings between pediatric patients, their caregivers and medical  providers. Eighty youth (ages 7-21) living with NF1 completed the DT and an  accompanying checklist. The findings of this study suggest the DT and symptom  checklist was acceptable and feasible to complete in a clinic setting. A small  subset reported high distress that required further assessment and intervention.  Significant discordance between distress ratings of caregivers and children and  healthcare providers was also found. Overall, the DT and accompanying symptom  checklist provide important information to identify the presence of distress and  contextualize the child's distress but is limited by not assessing whether these  symptoms interfere with the child's daily life.

Neurofibromin and Sprouty-related EVH1 domain-containing protein 1 (Spred1) both  act as negative regulators of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and  are associated with the rare diseases Neurofibromatosis type 1 and Legius  syndrome, respectively. Spred1 recruits the major GTPase activating protein  (GAP) neurofibromin from the cytosol to the membrane in order to inactivate the  small G protein Ras. These functions are dependent on the N-terminal EVH1 domain  and the C-terminal Sprouty domain of Spred1 whereas the former specifically  recognizes the GAP related domain of neurofibromin and the latter is responsible  for membrane targeting. Within the GAP domain, Spred1 binding depends on the  GAPex portion which is dispensable for Ras inactivation. In a first step towards  the characterization of the Neurofibromin Spred1 interface in solution we  assigned backbone and side chain 1H, 13C, and 15N chemical shifts of the Spred1  derived EVH1 domain. Our chemical shift data analysis indicate seven consecutive  β-strands followed by a C-terminal α-helix which is in agreement with the  previously reported crystal structure of Spred1(EVH1). Our data provide a  framework for further analysis of the function of patient-derived mutations  associated with rare diseases.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common, cancer-predisposing disease caused  by mutations in the NF1 tumor gene. Patients with NF1 have an increased risk for  benign and malignant tumors of the nervous system (e.g., neurofibromas,  malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, gliomas) and other tissues (e.g.,  leukemias, rhabdomyosarcoma, etc.) as well as increased susceptibility to  learning disabilities, chronic pain/migraines, hypertension, pigmentary changes,  and developmental lesions (e.g., tibial pseudoarthrosis). Pigs are an attractive  and upcoming animal model for future NF1 studies, but a potential limitation to  porcine model research has been the lack of validated reagents for direct  translational study to humans. To address that issue, we used formalin-fixed  tissues (human and pigs) to evaluate select immunohistochemical markers  (activated caspase-3, allograft inflammatory factor-1, beta-tubulin III,  calbindin D, CD13, CD20, desmin, epithelial membrane antigen, glial fibrillary  acidic protein, glucose transporter-1, laminin, myelin basic protein, myoglobin,  proliferating cell nuclear antigen, S100, vimentin, and von Willebrand factor).  The markers were validated by comparing known expression and localization in  human and pig tissues. Validation of these markers on fixed tissues will  facilitate prospective immunohistochemical studies of NF1 pigs, as well as other  pig models, in a more efficient, reproducible, and translationally relevant  manner.

Patients affected with a constitutional truncating NF2 mutation  have severe disease, while missense mutations or mosaic mutations present with a  milder attenuated phenotype. Genotype-derived natural history data are important  to inform discussions on prognosis and management. METHODS: We have assessed NF2 clinical phenotype in 142 patients in relation to  the UK NF2 Genetic Severity Score to validate its use as a clinical and research  tool. RESULTS: The Genetic Severity Score showed significant correlations across 10  measures, including mean age at diagnosis, proportion of patients with bilateral  vestibular schwannomas, presence of intracranial meningioma, spinal meningioma  and spinal schwannoma, NF2 eye features, hearing grade, age at first  radiotherapy, age at first surgery and age starting bevacizumab. In addition  there was moderate but significant correlation with age at loss of useful  hearing, and weak but significant correlations for mean age at death, quality of  life, last optimum Speech Discrimination Score and total number of major  interventions. Patients with severe disease presented at a younger age had a  higher disease burden and greater requirement of intervention than patients with  mild and moderate disease. CONCLUSIONS: This study validates the UK NF2 Genetic Severity Score to stratify  patients with NF2 for both clinical use and natural history studies.  © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of  the article) 2017.

Successful treatment of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated tumors poses a  significant clinical challenge. While the primary underlying genetic defect  driving RAS signaling is well described, recent evidence suggests immune  dysfunction contributes to tumor pathogenesis and malignant transformation. As  immunologic characterizations, prognostic and predictive of immunotherapeutic  clinical response in other cancers, are not fully described for benign and  malignant NF1-related tumors, we sought to define their immunologic profiles. We  determined the expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A/-B/-C,  β-2-microglobulin (B2M), and T cell inhibitory ligands PD-L1 and CTLA-4 by  microarray gene analysis and flow cytometry. We examined HLA-A/-B/-C, B2M, and  PD-L1 expression on thirty-six NF1-associated tumor samples by  immunohistochemistry, and correlated these with tumoral CD4+, CD8+, FOXP3+,  CD56+, and CD45RO+ lymphocytic infiltrates. We evaluated several tumors from a  single patient, observing trends of increasing immunogenicity over time, even  with disease progression. We observed similarly immunogenic profiles for  malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) and nodular and plexiform  neurofibromas, contrasting with diffuse neurofibromas. These studies suggest  that while immunotherapies may offer some benefit for MPNST and nodular and  plexiform neurofibromas, tumor heterogeneity might pose a significant clinical  challenge to this novel therapeutic approach.

Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor  involved in xenobiotic metabolism. Plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) can transform  into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) that are resistant to  existing therapies. These tumors are primarily composed of Schwann cells. In  addition to neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene inactivation, further genetic  lesions are required for malignant transformation. We have quantified the mRNA  expression levels of AHR and its associated genes in 38 human samples. We report  that AHR and the biosynthetic enzymes of its endogenous ligand are overexpressed  in human biopsies of PNFs and MPNSTs. We also detect a strong nuclear AHR  staining in MPNSTs. The inhibition of AHR by siRNA or antagonists, CH-223191 and  trimethoxyflavone, induces apoptosis in human MPNST cells. Since AHR  dysregulation is observed in these tumors, we investigate AHR involvement in  Schwann cell physiology. Hence, we studied the role of AHR in myelin structure  and myelin gene regulation in Ahr-/- mice during myelin development. AHR  ablation leads to locomotion defects and provokes thinner myelin sheaths around  the axons. We observe a dysregulation of myelin gene expression and myelin  developmental markers in Ahr-/- mice. Interestingly, AHR does not directly bind  to myelin gene promoters. The inhibition of AHR in vitro and in vivo increased  β-catenin levels and stimulated the binding of β-catenin on myelin gene  promoters. Taken together, our findings reveal an endogenous role of AHR in  peripheral myelination and in peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Finally, we  suggest a potential therapeutic approach by targeting AHR in nerve tumors.

RASopathies are a group of heterogeneous conditions caused by germline mutations  in RAS/MAPK signalling pathway genes. With next-generation sequencing (NGS),  sequencing capacity is no longer a limitation to molecular diagnosis. Instead,  the rising number of variants of unknown significance (VUSs) poses challenges to  clinical interpretation and genetic counselling. We investigated the potential  of an integrated pipeline combining NGS and the functional assessment of  variants for the diagnosis of RASopathies. We included 63 Chinese patients with  RASopathies that had previously tested negative for PTPN11 and HRAS mutations.  In these patients, we performed a genetic analysis of genes associated with  RASopathies using a multigene NGS panel and Sanger sequencing. For the VUSs, we  evaluated evidence from genetic, bioinformatic and functional data. Twenty  disease-causing mutations were identified in the 63 patients, providing a  primary diagnostic yield of 31.7%. Four VUSs were identified in five patients.  The functional assessment supported the pathogenicity of the RAF1 and RIT1 VUSs,  while the significance of two VUSs in A2ML1 remained unclear. In summary,  functional analysis improved the diagnostic yield from 31.7% to 36.5%. Although  technically demanding and time-consuming, a functional genetic diagnostic  analysis can ease the clinical translation of these findings to aid bedside  interpretation.

Germline NF2  mutation leads to neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), characterized by multiple  intracranial and spinal schwannomas. Patients with NF2 also frequently develop  peripheral neuropathies. While the role of merlin in SC neoplasia is well  established, its role in SC homeostasis is less defined. Here we explore the  role of merlin in SC responses to nerve injury and their ability to support axon  regeneration. We performed sciatic nerve crush in wild-type (WT) and in  P0SchΔ39-121 transgenic mice that express a dominant negative Nf2 isoform in  SCs. Recovery of nerve function was assessed by measuring mean contact paw area  on a pressure pad 7, 21, 60, and 90 days following nerve injury and by nerve  conduction assays at 90 days following injury. After 90 days, the nerves were  harvested and axon regeneration was quantified stereologically. Myelin  ultrastructure was analyzed by electron microscopy. Functional studies showed  delayed nerve regeneration in Nf2 mutant mice compared to the WT mice. Delayed  neural recovery correlated with a reduced density of regenerated axons and  increased endoneurial space in mutants compared to WT mice. Nevertheless,  functional and nerve conduction measures ultimately recovered to similar levels  in WT and Nf2 mutant mice, while there was a small (∼17%) reduction in the  percent of regenerated axons in the Nf2 mutant mice. The data suggest that  merlin function in SCs regulates neural ultrastructure and facilitates neural  regeneration, in addition to its role in SC neoplasia.  Copyright © 2018 IBRO.

BACKGROUND: Clinical overlap between neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2),  schwannomatosis, and meningiomatosis can make clinical diagnosis difficult.  Hence, molecular investigation of germline and tumor tissues may improve the  diagnosis. METHODS: We present the targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of NF2,  SMARCB1, LZTR1, SMARCE1, and SUFU tumor suppressor genes, using an  amplicon-based approach. We analyzed blood DNA from a cohort of 196 patients,  including patients with NF2 (N = 79), schwannomatosis (N = 40), meningiomatosis  (N = 12), and no clearly established diagnosis (N = 65). Matched tumor DNA was  analyzed when available. Forty-seven NF2-/SMARCB1-negative schwannomatosis  patients and 27 NF2-negative meningiomatosis patients were also evaluated. RESULTS: A NF2 variant was found in 41/79 (52%) NF2 patients. SMARCB1 or LZTR1  variants were identified in 5/40 (12.5%) and 13/40 (∼32%) patients in the  schwannomatosis cohort. Potentially pathogenic variants were found in 12/65  (18.5%) patients with no clearly established diagnosis. A LZTR1 variant was  identified in 16/47 (34%) NF2/SMARCB1-negative schwannomatosis patients. A  SMARCE1 variant was found in 3/39 (∼8%) meningiomatosis patients. No SUFU  variant was found in the cohort. NGS was an effective and sensitive method to  detect mutant alleles in blood or tumor DNA of mosaic NF2 patients.  Interestingly, we identified a 4-hit mechanism resulting in the complete NF2  loss-of-function combined with SMARCB1 and LZTR1 haploinsufficiency in  two-thirds of tumors from NF2 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous investigation of NF2, SMARCB1, LZTR1, and SMARCE1 is a  key element in the differential diagnosis of NF2, schwannomatosis, and  meningiomatosis. The targeted NGS strategy is suitable for the identification of  NF2 mosaicism in blood and for the investigation of tumors from these patients.

Neurofibromatosis type II (NF2) is a disease that needs new solutions.  Vestibular schwannoma (VS) growth causes progressive hearing loss, and the  standard treatment, including surgery and radiotherapy, can further damage the  nerve. There is an urgent need to identify an adjunct therapy that, by enhancing  the efficacy of radiation, can help lower the radiation dose and preserve  hearing. The mechanisms underlying deafness in NF2 are still unclear. One of the  major limitations in studying tumor-induced hearing loss is the lack of mouse  models that allow hearing testing. Here, we developed a cerebellopontine angle  (CPA) schwannoma model that faithfully recapitulates the tumor-induced hearing  loss. Using this model, we discovered that cMET blockade by crizotinib (CRZ)  enhanced schwannoma radiosensitivity by enhancing DNA damage, and CRZ treatment  combined with low-dose radiation was as effective as high-dose radiation. CRZ  treatment had no adverse effect on hearing; however, it did not affect  tumor-induced hearing loss, presumably because cMET blockade did not change  tumor hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) levels. This cMET gene knockdown study  independently confirmed the role of the cMET pathway in mediating the effect of  CRZ. Furthermore, we evaluated the translational potential of cMET blockade in  human schwannomas. We found that human NF2-associated and sporadic VSs showed  significantly elevated HGF expression and cMET activation compared with normal  nerves, which correlated with tumor growth and cyst formation. Using organoid  brain slice culture, cMET blockade inhibited the growth of patient-derived  schwannomas. Our findings provide the rationale and necessary data for the  clinical translation of combined cMET blockade with radiation therapy in  patients with NF2.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type1 (NF1) is associated with a broad range of  behavioural deficits, and an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory  neurotransmission has been postulated in this disorder. Inhibition is involved  in the control of frequency and stability of motor rhythms. Therefore, we aimed  to explore the link between behavioural motor control, brain rhythms and brain  activity, as assessed by EEG and fMRI in NF1. METHODS: We studied a cohort of 21 participants with NF1 and 20 age- and  gender-matched healthy controls, with a finger-tapping task requiring pacing at  distinct frequencies during EEG and fMRI scans. RESULTS: We found that task performance was significantly different between NF1  and controls, the latter showing higher tapping time precision. The  time-frequency patterns at the beta sub-band (20-26 Hz) mirrored the behavioural  modulations, with similar cyclic synchronization/desynchronization patterns for  both groups. fMRI results showed a higher recruitment of the extrapyramidal  motor system (putamen, cerebellum and red nucleus) in the control group during  the fastest pacing condition. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated impaired precision in rhythmic  pacing behaviour in NF1 as compared with controls. We found a decreased  recruitment of the cerebellum, a structure where inhibitory interneurons are  essential regulators of rhythmic synchronization, and in deep brain regions  pivotally involved in motor pacing. Our findings shed light into the neural  underpinnings of motor timing deficits in NF1.

Loss of the Neurofibromatosis 1 (Nf1) protein, neurofibromin, in Drosophila  disrupts circadian rhythms of locomotor activity without impairing central  clock function, suggesting effects downstream of the clock. However, the  relevant cellular mechanisms are not known. Leveraging the discovery of output  circuits for locomotor rhythms, we dissected cellular actions of neurofibromin  in recently identified substrates. Herein, we show that neurofibromin affects  the levels and cycling of calcium in multiple circadian peptidergic neurons. A  prominent site of action is the pars intercerebralis (PI), the fly equivalent of  the hypothalamus, with cell-autonomous effects of Nf1 in PI cells that secrete  DH44. Nf1 interacts genetically with peptide signaling to affect circadian  behavior. We extended these studies to mammals to demonstrate that mouse  astrocytes exhibit a 24-hr rhythm of calcium levels, which is also attenuated by  lack of neurofibromin. These findings establish a conserved role for  neurofibromin in intracellular signaling rhythms within the nervous system.  Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a disease caused by mutation of neurofibromin 1  (NF1), loss of which results in hyperactive Ras signaling and a concomitant  increase in cell proliferation and survival. Patients with neurofibromatosis  type 1 frequently develop tumors such as plexiform neurofibromas and malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Mutation of NF1 or loss of the NF1 protein is  also observed in glioblastoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and ovarian cancer among  other sporadic cancers. A therapy that selectively targets NF1 deficient tumors  would substantially advance our ability to treat these malignancies. To address  the need for these therapeutics, we developed and conducted a synthetic  lethality screen to discover molecules that target yeast lacking the homolog of  NF1, IRA2. One of the lead candidates that was observed to be synthetic lethal  with ira2Δ yeast is Y100. Here, we describe the mechanisms by which Y100 targets  ira2Δ yeast and NF1-deficient tumor cells. Y100 treatment disrupted  proteostasis, metabolic homeostasis, and induced the formation of mitochondrial  superoxide in NF1-deficient cancer cells. Previous studies also indicate that  NF1/Ras-dysregulated tumors may be sensitive to modulators of oxidative and ER  stress. We hypothesize that the use of Y100 and molecules with related  mechanisms of action represent a feasible therapeutic strategy for targeting NF1  deficient cells.

In Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) germ line loss of function mutations result in  reduction of cellular neurofibromin content (NF1+/-, NF1 haploinsufficiency).  The Ras-GAP neurofibromin is a very large cytoplasmic protein (2818 AA, 319 kDa)  involved in the RAS-MAPK pathway. Aside from regulation of proliferation, it is  involved in mechanosensoric of cells. We investigated neurofibromin replacement  in cultured human fibroblasts showing reduced amount of neurofibromin. Full  length neurofibromin was produced recombinantly in insect cells and purified.  Protein transduction into cultured fibroblasts was performed employing cell  penetrating peptides along with photochemical internalization. This combination  of transduction strategies ensures the intracellular uptake and the  translocation to the cytoplasm of neurofibromin. The transduced neurofibromin is  functional, indicated by functional rescue of reduced mechanosensoric blindness  and reduced RasGAP activity in cultured fibroblasts of NF1 patients or normal  fibroblasts treated by NF1 siRNA. Our study shows that recombinant neurofibromin  is able to revert cellular effects of NF1 haploinsuffiency in vitro, indicating  a use of protein transduction into cells as a potential treatment strategy for  the monogenic disease NF1.

Freret ME(1), Gutmann DH(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis,  Missouri.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common cancer predisposition syndrome caused  by mutations in the NF1 gene. The NF1-encoded protein (neurofibromin) is an  inhibitor of the oncoprotein RAS and controls cell growth and survival.  Individuals with NF1 are prone to developing low-grade tumors of the optic  nerves, chiasm, tracts, and radiations, termed optic pathway gliomas (OPGs),  which can cause vision loss. A paucity of surgical tumor specimens and of  patient-derived xenografts for investigative studies has limited our  understanding of human NF1-associated OPG (NF1-OPG). However, mice genetically  engineered to harbor Nf1 gene mutations develop optic gliomas that share many  features of their human counterparts. These genetically engineered mouse (GEM)  strains have provided important insights into the cellular and molecular  determinants that underlie mouse Nf1 optic glioma development, maintenance, and  associated vision loss, with relevance by extension to human NF1-OPG disease.  Herein, we review our current understanding of NF1-OPG pathobiology and describe  the mechanisms responsible for tumor initiation, growth, and associated vision  loss in Nf1 GEM models. We also discuss how Nf1 GEM and other preclinical models  can be deployed to identify and evaluate molecularly targeted therapies for OPG,  particularly as they pertain to future strategies aimed at preventing or  improving tumor-associated vision loss in children with NF1.  © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The architecture of individual cells and cell collectives enables functional  specification, a prominent example being the formation of epithelial tubes that  transport fluid or gas in many organs. The intrahepatic bile ducts (IHBDs) form  a tubular network within the liver parenchyma that transports bile to the  intestine. Aberrant biliary 'neoductulogenesis' is also a feature of several  liver pathologies including tumorigenesis. However, the mechanism of biliary  tube morphogenesis in development or disease is not known. Elimination of the  neurofibromatosis type 2 protein (NF2; also known as merlin or neurofibromin 2)  causes hepatomegaly due to massive biliary neoductulogenesis in the mouse liver.  We show that this phenotype reflects unlimited biliary morphogenesis rather than  proliferative expansion. Our studies suggest that NF2 normally limits biliary  morphogenesis by coordinating lumen expansion and cell architecture. This work  provides fundamental insight into how biliary fate and tubulogenesis are  coordinated during development and will guide analyses of disease-associated and  experimentally induced biliary pathologies.  © 2018.

The neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor protein Merlin functions as  a negative regulator of cell growth and actin dynamics in different cell types  amongst which Schwann cells have been extensively studied. In contrast, the  presence and the role of Merlin in oligodendrocytes, the myelin forming cells  within the CNS, have not been elucidated. In this work, we demonstrate that  Merlin immunoreactivity was broadly distributed in the white matter throughout  the central nervous system. Following Merlin expression during development in  the cerebellum, Merlin could be detected in the cerebellar white matter tract at  early postnatal stages as shown by its co-localization with Olig2-positive cells  as well as in adult brain sections where it was aligned with myelin basic  protein containing fibers. This suggests that Merlin is expressed in immature  and mature oligodendrocytes. Expression levels of Merlin were low in  oligodendrocytes as compared to astrocytes and neurons throughout development.  Expression of Merlin in oligodendroglia was further supported by its  identification in either immortalized cell lines of oligodendroglial origin or  in primary oligodendrocyte cultures. In these cultures, the two main splice  variants of Nf2 could be detected. Merlin was localized in clusters within the  nuclei and in the cytoplasm. Overexpressing Merlin in oligodendrocyte cell lines  strengthened reduced impedance in XCELLigence measurements and Ki67 stainings in  cultures over time. In addition, the initiation and elongation of cellular  projections were reduced by Merlin overexpression. Consistently, cell migration  was retarded in scratch assays done on Nf2-transfected oligodendrocyte cell  lines. These data suggest that Merlin actively modulates process outgrowth and  migration in oligodendrocytes.

Conventional differential expression analyses have been successfully employed to  identify genes whose levels change across experimental conditions. One  limitation of this approach is the inability to discover central regulators that  control gene expression networks. In addition, while methods for identifying  central nodes in a network are widely implemented, the bioinformatics validation  process and the theoretical error estimates that reflect the uncertainty in each  step of the analysis are rarely considered. Using the betweenness centrality  measure, we identified Etv5 as a potential tissue-level regulator in murine  neurofibromatosis type 1 (Nf1) low-grade brain tumors (optic gliomas). As such,  the expression of Etv5 and Etv5 target genes were increased in multiple  independently-generated mouse optic glioma models relative to non-neoplastic  (normal healthy) optic nerves, as well as in the cognate human tumors (pilocytic  astrocytoma) relative to normal human brain. Importantly, differential Etv5 and  Etv5 network expression was not directly the result of Nf1 gene dysfunction in  specific cell types, but rather reflects a property of the tumor as an aggregate  tissue. Moreover, this differential Etv5 expression was independently validated  at the RNA and protein levels. Taken together, the combined use of network  analysis, differential RNA expression findings, and experimental validation  highlights the potential of the computational network approach to provide new  insights into tumor biology.

PURPOSE: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the result of inherited mutations in  the NF1 tumor suppressor gene, which encodes the protein neurofibromin. Eye  manifestations are common in NF1 with recent reports describing a vascular  dysplasia in the retina and choroid. Common features of NF1 retinopathy include  tortuous and dilated feeder vessels that terminate in capillary tufts, increased  endothelial permeability, and neovascularization. Given the retinal vascular  phenotype observed in persons with NF1, we hypothesize that preserving  neurofibromin may be a novel strategy to control pathologic retinal  neovascularization. METHODS: Nf1 expression in human endothelial cells (EC) was reduced using small  hairpin (sh) RNA and EC proliferation, migration, and capacity to form  vessel-like networks were assessed in response to VEGF and hypoxia. Wild-type  (WT), Nf1 heterozygous (Nf1+/-), and Nf1flox/+;Tie2cre pups were subjected to  hyperoxia/hypoxia using the oxygen-induced retinopathy model. Retinas were  analyzed quantitatively for extent of retinal vessel dropout,  neovascularization, and capillary branching. RESULTS: Neurofibromin expression was suppressed in response to VEGF, which  corresponded with activation of Mek-Erk and PI3-K-Akt signaling.  Neurofibromin-deficient EC exhibited enhanced proliferation and network  formation in response to VEGF and hypoxia via an Akt-dependent mechanism. In  response to hyperoxia/hypoxia, Nf1+/- retinas exhibited increased vessel dropout  and neovascularization when compared with WT retinas. Neovascularization was  similar between Nf1+/- and Nf1flox/+;Tie2cre retinas, but capillary drop out in  Nf1flox/+;Tie2cre retinas was significantly reduced when compared with Nf1+/-  retinas. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that neurofibromin expression is essential for  controlling endothelial cell proliferation and retinal neovascularization and  therapies targeting neurofibromin-deficient EC may be beneficial.

Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is a rare tumor suppressor syndrome that manifests  with multiple schwannomas and meningiomas. There are no effective drug therapies  for these benign tumors and conventional therapies have limited efficacy.  Various model systems have been created and several drug targets have been  implicated in NF2-driven tumorigenesis based on known effects of the absence of  merlin, the product of the NF2 gene. We tested priority compounds based on known  biology with traditional dose-concentration studies in meningioma and schwann  cell systems. Concurrently, we studied functional kinome and gene expression in  these cells pre- and post-treatment to determine merlin deficient molecular  phenotypes. Cell viability results showed that three agents (GSK2126458,  Panobinostat, CUDC-907) had the greatest activity across schwannoma and  meningioma cell systems, but merlin status did not significantly influence  response. In vivo, drug effect was tumor specific with meningioma, but not  schwannoma, showing response to GSK2126458 and Panobinostat. In culture, changes  in both the transcriptome and kinome in response to treatment clustered  predominantly based on tumor type. However, there were differences in both gene  expression and functional kinome at baseline between meningioma and schwannoma  cell systems that may form the basis for future selective therapies. This work  has created an openly accessible resource (www.synapse.org/SynodosNF2) of fully  characterized isogenic schwannoma and meningioma cell systems as well as a rich  data source of kinome and transcriptome data from these assay systems before and  after treatment that enables single and combination drug discovery based on  molecular phenotype.

Loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene causes the autosomal dominant condition,  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Children and adults with NF1 suffer from  pathologies including benign and malignant tumors to cognitive deficits,  seizures, growth abnormalities, and peripheral neuropathies. NF1 encodes  neurofibromin, a Ras-GTPase activating protein, and NF1 mutations result in  hyperactivated Ras signaling in patients. Existing NF1 mutant mice mimic  individual aspects of NF1, but none comprehensively models the disease. We  describe a potentially novel Yucatan miniswine model bearing a heterozygotic  mutation in NF1 (exon 42 deletion) orthologous to a mutation found in NF1  patients. NF1+/ex42del miniswine phenocopy the wide range of manifestations seen  in NF1 patients, including café au lait spots, neurofibromas, axillary  freckling, and neurological defects in learning and memory. Molecular analyses  verified reduced neurofibromin expression in swine NF1+/ex42del fibroblasts, as  well as hyperactivation of Ras, as measured by increased expression of its  downstream effectors, phosphorylated ERK1/2, SIAH, and the checkpoint regulators  p53 and p21. Consistent with altered pain signaling in NF1, dysregulation of  calcium and sodium channels was observed in dorsal root ganglia expressing  mutant NF1. Thus, these NF1+/ex42del miniswine recapitulate the disease and  provide a unique, much-needed tool to advance the study and treatment of NF1.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) presents a wide range of clinical  manifestations, including bone alterations. Studies that seek to understand  cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying NF1 orthopedic problems are of  great importance to better understand the pathogenesis and the development of  new therapies. Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) are being used as an in vitro  model for several diseases and appear as a suitable model for NF1. The aim of  this study was to evaluate in vitro chondrogenic differentiation of DPSCs from  individuals with NF1 using two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D)  cultures. RESULTS: To fulfill the criteria of the International Society for Cellular  Therapy, DPSCs were characterized by surface antigen expression and by their  multipotentiality, being induced to differentiate towards adipogenic,  osteogenic, and chondrogenic lineages in 2D cultures. Both DPSCs from  individuals with NF1 (NF1 DPSCs) and control cultures were positive for CD90,  CD105, CD146 and negative for CD13, CD14, CD45 and CD271, and successfully  differentiated after the protocols. Chondrogenic differentiation was evaluated  in 2D and in 3D (pellet) cultures, which were further evaluated by optical  microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). 2D cultures showed  greater extracellular matrix deposition in NF1 DPSCs comparing with controls  during chondrogenic differentiation. In semithin sections, control pellets  hadhomogenous-sized intra and extracelullar matrix vesicles, whereas NF1  cultures had matrix vesicles of different sizes. TEM analysis showed higher  amount of collagen fibers in NF1 cultures compared with control cultures. CONCLUSION: NF1 DPSCs presented increased extracellular matrix deposition during  chondrogenic differentiation, which could be related to skeletal changes in  individuals with NF1.

BACKGROUND: This study explores whether objective, quantitative radiomic  biomarkers derived from magnetic resonance (MR), positron emission tomography  (PET), and computed tomography (CT) may be useful in reliably distinguishing  malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) from benign plexiform  neurofibromas (PN). METHODS: A registration and segmentation pipeline was established using a cohort  of NF1 patients with histopathological diagnosis of PN or MPNST, and medical  imaging of the PN including MR and PET-CT. The corrected MR datasets were  registered to the corresponding PET-CT via landmark-based registration. PET  standard-uptake value (SUV) thresholds were used to guide segmentation of  volumes of interest: MPNST-associated PET-hot regions (SUV≥3.5) and  PN-associated PET-elevated regions (2.0<SUV<3.5). Quantitative imaging features  were extracted from the MR, PET, and CT data and compared for statistical  differences. Intensity histogram features included (mean, media, maximum,  variance, full width at half maximum, entropy, kurtosis, and skewness), while  image texture was quantified using Law's texture energy measures, grey-level  co-occurrence matrices, and neighborhood grey-tone difference matrices. RESULTS: For each of the 20 NF1 subjects, a total of 320 features were extracted  from the image data. Feature reduction and statistical testing identified 9  independent radiomic biomarkers from the MR data (4 intensity and 5 texture) and  4 PET (2 intensity and 2 texture) were different between the PET-hot versus  PET-elevated volumes of interest. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests imaging features can be used to distinguish  malignancy in NF1-realted tumors, which could improve MPNST risk assessment and  positively impact clinical management of NF1 patients.

BACKGROUND: Meningiomas are the most common primary brain tumor in adults, and  somatic loss of the neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene is a  frequent genetic event. There is no effective treatment for tumors that recur or  continue to grow despite surgery and/or radiation. Therefore, targeted therapies  that either delay tumor progression or cause tumor shrinkage are much needed.  Our earlier work established mammalian target of rapamycin complex mTORC1/mTORC2  activation in NF2-deficient meningiomas. METHODS: High-throughput kinome analyses were performed in NF2-null human  arachnoidal and meningioma cell lines to identify functional kinome changes upon  NF2 loss. Immunoblotting confirmed the activation of kinases and demonstrated  effectiveness of drugs to block the activation. Drugs, singly and in  combination, were screened in cells for their growth inhibitory activity.  Antitumor drug efficacy was tested in an orthotopic meningioma model. RESULTS: Erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular receptor tyrosine kinases (EPH  RTKs), c-KIT, and Src family kinase (SFK) members, which are biological targets  of dasatinib, were among the top candidates activated in NF2-null cells.  Dasatinib significantly inhibited phospho-EPH receptor A2 (pEPHA2), pEPHB1,  c-KIT, and Src/SFK in NF2-null cells, showing no cross-talk with mTORC1/2  signaling. Posttreatment kinome analyses showed minimal adaptive changes. While  dasatinib treatment showed some activity, dual mTORC1/2 inhibitor and its  combination with dasatinib elicited stronger growth inhibition in meningiomas. CONCLUSION: Co-targeting mTORC1/2 and EPH RTK/SFK pathways could be a novel  effective treatment strategy for NF2-deficient meningiomas.

OBJECTIVE: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are aggressive  sarcomas characterized by high recurrence rates and early metastases. These  tumors arise more frequently within neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and present  with resistance during standard chemotherapy leading to increased mortality and  morbidity in those patients. In vitro all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and MEK  inhibitors (MEKi) were shown to inhibit tumor proliferation, especially when  applied in combination. Therefore, we established a nude mouse model to  investigate if treatment of xenografts derived from NF1 associated S462 and T265  MPNST cells respond to ATRA and the MEKi PD0325901. RESULTS: We demonstrated that human NF1 associated MPNST derived from S462 but  not T265 cells form solid subcutaneous tumors in Foxn1 nude mice but not in  Balb/c, SHO or Shorn mice. We verified a characteristic staining pattern of  human MPNST xenografts by immunohistochemistry. Therapeutic effects of ATRA  and/or MEKi PD0325901 on growth of S462 MPNST xenografts in Foxn1 nude mice were  not demonstrated in vitro, as we did not observe significant suppression of  MPNST growth compared with placebo treatment.

Purpose To evaluate whether patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-a  multisystem neurodevelopmental disorder with myriad imaging manifestations,  including focal transient myelin vacuolization within the deep gray nuclei,  brainstem, and cerebellum-exhibit differences in cortical and subcortical  structures, particularly in subcortical regions where these abnormalities  manifest. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, by using clinically  obtained three-dimensional T1-weighted MR images and established image analysis  methods, 10 intracranial volume-corrected subcortical and 34 cortical regions of  interest (ROIs) were quantitatively assessed in 32 patients with NF1 and 245  age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. By using linear models, ROI  cortical thicknesses and volumes were compared between patients with NF1 and  control subjects, as a function of age. With hierarchic cluster analysis and  partial correlations, differences in the pattern of association between cortical  and subcortical ROI volumes in patients with NF1 and control subjects were also  evaluated. Results Patients with NF1 exhibited larger subcortical volumes and  thicker cortices of select regions, particularly the hippocampi, amygdalae,  cerebellar white matter, ventral diencephalon, thalami, and occipital cortices.  For the thalami and pallida and 22 cortical ROIs in patients with NF1, a  significant inverse association between volume and age was found, suggesting  that volumes decrease with increasing age. Moreover, compared with those in  control subjects, ROIs in patients with NF1 exhibited a distinct pattern of  clustering and partial correlations. Discussion Neurofibromatosis type 1 is  characterized by larger subcortical volumes and thicker cortices of select  structures. Most apparent within the hippocampi, amygdalae, cerebellar white  matter, ventral diencephalon, thalami and occipital cortices, these  neurofibromatosis type 1-associated volumetric changes may, in part, be age  dependent. © RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this  article.

Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) can cause a wide range of cognitive deficits, but  its underlying nature is still unknown. We investigated the correlation between  cognitive performance and specific patterns of resting-state brain metabolism in  a NF1 sample. Sixteen individuals diagnosed with NF1 underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT  brain imaging followed by a neuropsychological assessment. Principal component  analysis was performed on 17 measures of cognitive function and a machine  learning approach based on Gaussian Process Regression was used to individually  predict the components that represented most of the variance in the  neuropsychological data. The accuracy of the method was estimated using  leave-one-out cross-validation and its significance through permutation testing.  We found that only the first component could be accurately predicted from  resting state metabolism (r = 0.926, p<0.001). Multiple and heterogeneous  measures contribute to the first component, mainly WISC/WAIS Procedure and  Verbal IQ, verbal memory and fluency. Considering the accurate prediction of  measures of neuropsychological performance based on brain metabolism in NF1  patients, this suggests an underlying metabolic pattern that relates to  cognitive performance in this group.

From 2005 to 2010, 20 consecutive patients with fully manifested  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) underwent elective neurofibroma resection at our  institution (Departments of Plastic Surgery and of Odontostomatology). Specimens  were photographed under optical microscope and confocal laser scanning  microscopy (CLSM) with ultra-high accuracy of detail, including depth of field.  Patients were followed up for a minimum of 4 years and up to a maximum of 12  years, postsurgery. While all nonrecurring lesions showed intense fluorescence,  six of the seven lesions with absence of fluorescence under CLSM recurred at a  mean of 5.5 years after surgical excision. Among the re-excised lesions, 3 were  diagnosed as malignant at the subsequent removal. Despite the limitation of a  small cohort, CLSM appears to be a simple and low-cost technique to  differentiate forms of neurofibromas with low and high risk of recurrence and  malignant degeneration.

Sporadic VSs exhibit variable  growth patterns and only a small fraction of the tumours are fast-growing;  however, the underlying mechanisms remain undefined. METHODS: DNA sequencing and dosage analysis were used to identify the NF2  mutation status in sporadic schwannomas. The expression and sub-cellular  localization of merlin and p53-MDM2 were assessed by immunoblotting, qRT-PCR and  immunofluorescence. In vitro and in vivo studies were performed to reveal the  effects of Nutlin-3 (a MDM2 inhibitor) and/or MG-132(a proteasome inhibitor) on  schwannomas. The proliferation of schwannoma cells was assessed by CCK-8 assay,  EdU staining and Flow cytometry analysis. FINDINGS: Double genetic hits of NF2 tended to occur in fast-growing tumours,  characterized by the absence of merlin. The deregulation of p53-MDM2 was  demonstrated to mediate merlin-deficient tumour growth, characterized by a  nuclear accumulation of stabilized MDM2, contributing to a nuclear export of p53  for degradation. Nutlin-3 blocked the proliferation of schwannoma cells via a  cooperative recovery of merlin and p53, accompanied by the shuttling of both  proteins from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. We further demonstrated a difference  in the sensitivity to Nutlin-3 between schwannoma cells with and without merlin  expression. Nutlin-3 combined with MG-132 narrowed this between-group difference  and triggered stronger inhibitory effects on the growth of schwannomas through  coordinated reactivation of p53. INTERPRETATION: These findings present treatment strategies directed on the  pathogenesis of sporadic schwannomas. FUND: National Natural Science Foundation  of China.  Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is caused by heterozygous  loss-of-function variants in the NF1 gene encoding neurofibromin which serves as  a tumor suppressor that inhibits RAS signaling and regulates cell proliferation  and differentiation. While, the only well-established functional domain in the  NF1 protein is the GAP-related domain (GRD), most of the identified  non-truncating disease-causing variants are located outside of this domain,  supporting the existence of other important disease-associated domains.  Identifying these domains may reveal novel functions of NF1. METHODS: By implementing inferential statistics combined with machine-learning  methods, we developed a novel NF1-specific functional prediction model that  focuses on nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs). The model enables  annotating all possible NF1 nonsynonymous variants, thus mapping the range of  pathogenic non-truncating variants at the codon level across the NF1 gene. FINDINGS: The generated model demonstrates high absolute prediction value for  missense and splice-site variations (area under the ROC curve of 0.96)  outperforming 14 other established models. By reviewing the entire dataset of  nonsynonymous variants, two novel domains (Armadillo type fold 1 and 2) were  identified as being associated with pathogenicity (OR 1.86; CI 1.04 to 3.34 and  OR 2.08; CI 1.08 to 4.04, respectively; P < .05). Specific exons and codons  associated with increased pathogenicity were also detected along the gene inside  and outside the GRD domain. INTERPRETATION: The developed model, enabled better prediction of pathogenicity  for variants in NF1 gene, as well as elucidation of novel NF1-associated domains  in addition to the GRD.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a dominantly inherited tumor  predisposition syndrome that targets the peripheral nervous system. It is caused  by mutations of the NF1 gene which serve as a negative regulator of the cellular  Ras/MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinases) signaling pathway. Owing to the  complexity in some parts of clinical diagnoses and the need for better  understanding of its molecular relationships, a genetic characterization of this  disorder will be helpful in the clinical setting. METHODS: In this study, we present a customized targeted gene panel of  NF1/KRAS/BRAF/p53 and SPRED1 genes combined with Multiple Ligation-Dependent  Probe Amplification analysis for the NF1 mutation screening in a cohort of  patients clinically suspected as NF1. RESULTS: In this study, we identified 73 NF1 mutations and two BRAF novel  variants from 100 NF1 patients who were suspected as having NF1. These genetic  alterations are heterogeneous and distribute in a complicated way without  clustering in either cysteine-serine-rich domain or within the GAP-related  domain. We also detected fifteen multi-exon deletions within the NF1 gene by  MLPA Analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that a genetic screening using a NGS panel  with high coverage of Ras-signaling components combined with Multiple  Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification analysis will enable differential  diagnosis of patients with overlapping clinical features.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disease that predisposes  individuals to developing benign neurofibromas and malignant peripheral nerve  sheath tumors (MPNST). The mechanism of NF1-tumorigenesis or the curatives have  not been established. Using unique trascriptome and proteome integration method,  iPEACH (1), we previously identified translationally controlled tumor protein  (TCTP) as a novel biological target for NF1-associated tumors (2). Here, we  identified specific TCTP-interacting proteins by sequential affinity  purification and data-independent mass spectrometry acquisition (AP-DIA/SWATH)  to investigate the role of TCTP in NF1-associated malignant tumors. TCTP mainly  interacts with proteins related to protein synthesis and especially to  elongation factor complex components, including EF1A2, EF1B, EF1D, EF1G, and  valyl-tRNA synthetase (VARS), in NF1-deficient malignant tumor cells.  Interestingly, TCTP preferentially binds to EF1A2 (normally found only in neural  and skeletal-muscle cells and several cancer cells), rather than EF1A1 despite  the high homologies (98%) in their sequences. The docking simulation and further  validations to study the interaction between TCTP and EF1A2 revealed that TCTP  directly binds with EF1A2 via the contact areas of EF1A2 dimerization. Using  unique and common sequences between EF1A2 and EF1A1 in AP-DIA/SWATH, we  quantitatively validated the interaction of EF1A2 and TCTP/other elongation  factors and found that TCTP coordinates the translational machinery of  elongation factors via the association with EF1A2. These data suggest that TCTP  activates EF1A2-dependent translation by mediating complex formation with other  elongation factors. Inhibiting the TCTP-EF1A2 interaction with EF1A2 siRNAs or a  TCTP inhibitor, artesunate, significantly down-regulated the factors related to  protein translation and caused dramatic suppression of growth/translation in  NF1-associated tumors. Our findings demonstrate that a specific protein  translation machinery related to the TCTP-EF1A2 interaction is functionally  implicated in the tumorigenesis and progression of NF1-associated tumors and  could represent a therapeutic target.  © 2019 Kobayashi et al.

The fertility of men with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is reduced. Despite this  observation, gonadal function has not been examined in patients with NF1. In  order to assess the role of reduced neurofibromin in the testes, we examined  testicular morphology and function in an Nf1+/- mouse model. We found that  although Nf1+/- male mice are able to reproduce, they have significantly fewer  pups per litter than Nf1+/+ control males. Reduced fertility in Nf1+/- male mice  is associated with disorganization of the seminiferous epithelium, with  exfoliation of germ cells and immature spermatids into the tubule lumen.  Morphometric analysis shows that these alterations are associated with decreased  Leydig cell numbers and increased spermatid cell numbers. We hypothesized that  hyper-activation of Ras in Nf1+/- males affects ectoplasmic specialization, a  Sertoli-spermatid adherens junction involved in spermiation. Consistent with  this idea, we found increased expression of phosphorylated ERK, a downstream  effector of Ras that has been shown to alter ectoplasmic specialization, in  Nf1+/- males in comparison to control Nf1+/+ littermates. These data demonstrate  that neurofibromin haploinsufficiency impairs spermatogenesis and fertility in a  mouse model of NF1.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a genetic tumor-predisposition  disorder caused by NF2/merlin tumor suppressor gene inactivation. The hallmark  of NF2 is formation of bilateral vestibular schwannomas (VS). Because merlin  modulates activity of the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase  (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, we investigated  repurposing drugs targeting MEK1 and/or MEK2 as a treatment for NF2-associated  schwannomas. METHODS: Mouse and human merlin-deficient Schwann cell lines (MD-MSC/HSC) were  screened against 6 MEK1/2 inhibitors. Efficacious drugs were tested in  orthotopic allograft and NF2 transgenic mouse models. Pathway and proteome  analyses were conducted. Drug efficacy was examined in primary human VS cells  with NF2 mutations and correlated with DNA methylation patterns. RESULTS: Trametinib, PD0325901, and cobimetinib were most effective in reducing  MD-MSC/HSC viability. Each decreased phosphorylated pERK1/2 and cyclin D1,  increased p27, and induced caspase-3 cleavage in MD-MSCs. Proteomic analysis  confirmed cell cycle arrest and activation of pro-apoptotic pathways in  trametinib-treated MD-MSCs. The 3 inhibitors slowed allograft growth; however,  decreased pERK1/2, cyclin D1, and Ki-67 levels were observed only in PD0325901  and cobimetinib-treated grafts. Tumor burden and average tumor size were reduced  in trametinib-treated NF2 transgenic mice; however, tumors did not exhibit  reduced pERK1/2 levels. Trametinib and PD0325901 modestly reduced viability of  several primary human VS cell cultures with NF2 mutations. DNA methylation  analysis of PD0325901-resistant versus -susceptible VS identified genes that  could contribute to drug resistance. CONCLUSION: MEK inhibitors exhibited differences in antitumor efficacy  resistance in schwannoma models with possible emergence of trametinib  resistance. The results support further investigation of MEK inhibitors in  combination with other targeted drugs for NF2 schwannomas.  © The Author(s) 2019.

Neurofibromatosis type II (NF2) is a disease that lacks effective therapies. NF2  is characterized by bilateral vestibular schwannomas (VSs) that cause  progressive and debilitating hearing loss, leading to social isolation and  increased rates of depression. A major limitation in NF2 basic and translational  research is the lack of animal models that allow the full spectrum of research  into the biology and molecular mechanisms of NF2 tumor progression, as well as  the effects on neurological function. In this protocol, we describe how to  inject schwannoma cells into the mouse brain cerebellopontine angle (CPA)  region. We also describe how to apply state-of-the-art intravital imaging and  hearing assessment techniques to study tumor growth and hearing loss. In  addition, ataxia, angiogenesis, and tumor-stroma interaction assays can be  applied, and the model can be used to test the efficacy of novel therapeutic  approaches. By studying the disease from every angle, this model offers the  potential to unravel the basic biological underpinnings of NF2 and to develop  novel therapeutics to control this devastating disease. Our protocol can be  adapted to study other diseases within the CPA, including meningiomas, lipomas,  vascular malformations, hemangiomas, epidermoid cysts, cerebellar astrocytomas,  and metastatic lesions. The entire surgical procedure takes ~45 min per mouse  and allows for subsequent longitudinal imaging, as well as neurological and  hearing assessment, for up to 2 months.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a tumor predisposition genetic disease caused  by mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene. Plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs)  are benign Schwann cell (SC) tumors of the peripheral nerve sheath that develop  through NF1 inactivation and can progress toward a malignant soft tissue  sarcoma. There is a lack of non-perishable model systems to investigate PNF  development. We reprogrammed PNF-derived NF1(-/-) cells, descendants from the  tumor originating cell. These NF1(-/-)-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)  captured the genomic status of PNFs and were able to differentiate toward neural  crest stem cells and further to SCs. iPSC-derived NF1(-/-) SCs exhibited a  continuous high proliferation rate, poor myelination ability, and a tendency to  form 3D spheres that expressed the same markers as their PNF-derived primary SC  counterparts. They represent a valuable model to study and treat PNFs.  PNF-derived iPSC lines were banked for making them available.  Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disease involving neurocutaneous  abnormalities. Neurofibromatosis type 1 is an autosomal dominant disorder  characterized by the neurofibromas and café-au-lait spots. Mutation in the NF 1  gene causes NF1. The NF 1 gene encodes neurofibromin. In this study, we found a  31-year-old Chinese boy with NF1. He presented only with café-au-lait spots over  the whole body. The proband's mother had a severe phenotype with neurofibroma  and café-au-lait macules over her whole body, mostly in the facial region. A  novel multi exon deletion c.(4661+1_4662-1)_(5748+1_5749-1)del; [EX36_39DEL] on  the NF 1 gene has been identified in the proband. Quantitative real-time  polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) confirmed that this mutation is co-segregated  well and was inherited from the proband's mother. The mutation was absent in the  proband's father and normal individuals. The novel multi exon deletion results  in the formation of a truncated NF1 protein that caused the NF1 phenotype in  this family. Our present study also emphasized the significance of rapid,  accurate and cost-effective screening for the patient with NF1 by next  generation sequencing (NGS).

Neurofibromatosis type 2 is an inherited, neoplastic disease associated with  schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas and that is caused by inactivation of  the tumor suppressor gene NF2 The NF2 gene product, Merlin, has no intrinsic  catalytic activity; its tumor suppressor function is mediated through the  proteins with which it interacts. We used proximity biotinylation followed by  mass spectrometry and direct binding assays to identify proteins that associated  with wild-type and various mutant forms of Merlin in immortalized Schwann cells.  We defined a set of 52 proteins in close proximity to wild-type Merlin. Most of  the Merlin-proximal proteins were components of cell junctional signaling  complexes, suggesting that additional potential interaction partners may exist  in adherens junctions, tight junctions, and focal adhesions. With mutant forms  of Merlin that cannot bind to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) or  that constitutively adopt a closed conformation, we confirmed a critical role  for PIP2 binding in Merlin function and identified a large cohort of proteins  that specifically interacted with Merlin in the closed conformation. Among these  proteins, we identified a previously unreported Merlin-binding protein,  apoptosis-stimulated p53 protein 2 (ASPP2, also called Tp53bp2), that bound to  closed-conformation Merlin predominately through the FERM domain. Our results  demonstrate that Merlin is a component of cell junctional mechanosensing  complexes and defines a specific set of proteins through which it acts.

Ishida O, Jimbow K.  Split-dopa preparation is a commonly used technique to visualize the epidermal  melanocytes. It can characterize the number of melanocytes and their tyrosinase  (dopa-oxidase) activities. There is not, however, any method to quantitate the  morphologic changes of dopa-positive melanocytes in the split preparation. This  study designed a computed image analyzing system and evaluated the structure of  epidermal melanocytes in café-au-lait macules with comparison to normally  pigmented skin in 5 patients with neurofibromatosis. By this method we were able  to delineate the melanocyte structure with melanocyte population and coloration  of the macules. We found that the population and structure of melanocytes differ  greatly depending on the coloration of the café-au-lait macules. The light brown  and brown macules showed the normal population of melanocytes with an increase  in the area and perimeter of whole cell; the area, perimeter, and diameter of  cytoplasm; and the area, length, and breadth of dendrites. In contrast, the dark  brown macules revealed a significant increase of the epidermal melanocytes with  a decrease in all of these parameters. Thus, the methodologic design presented  here may enable a quantitative, two-dimensional analysis of melanocyte structure  at the light microscopic level in the normal skin and in various pigmentary  disorders.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether [F]fluorothymidine (FLT) and/or  [F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) can differentiate  growth in neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) related vestibular schwannomas (VS) and to  evaluate the importance of PET scanner spatial resolution on measured tumor  uptake. METHODS: Six NF2 patients with 11 VS (4 rapidly growing, 7 indolent), were  scanned with FLT and FDG using a high-resolution research tomograph (HRRT,  Siemens) and a Siemens Biograph TrueV PET-CT, with and without resolution  modeling image reconstruction. Mean, maximum, and peak standardised uptake  values (SUV) for each tumor were derived and the intertumor correlation between  FDG and FLT uptake was compared. The ability of FDG and FLT SUV values to  discriminate between rapidly growing and slow growing (indolent) tumors was  assessed using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: Tumor uptake was seen with both tracers, using both scanners, with and  without resolution modeling. FDG and FLT uptake was correlated (R = 0.67-0.86,  p < 0.01) and rapidly growing tumors displayed significantly higher uptake  (SUVmean and SUVpeak) of both tracers (p < 0.05, one tailed t test). All of the  PET analyses performed demonstrated better discriminatory power (AUCROC  range = 0.71-0.86) than tumor size alone (AUCROC = 0.61). The use of standard  resolution scanner with standard reconstruction did not result in a notable  deterioration of discrimination accuracy. CONCLUSION: NF2 related VS demonstrate uptake of both FLT and FDG, which is  significantly increased in rapidly growing tumors. A short static FDG PET scan  with standard clinical resolution and reconstruction can provide relevant  information on tumor growth to aid clinical decision making.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a common genetic neurocutaneous  disease, with an autosomal dominant inheritance mode. Quality of life has been  shown impaired in NF1, due to severe complications, cosmetic features, and  uncertainty about the disorder. METHODS: This study sought to develop a self-administered questionnaire in  French to assess the burden of NF1 (BoN), then translate and linguistically and  cross-culturally validate it into American English, standardized methodology  applied, as outlined in the report. RESULTS: Based on several discussions with NF1 patients, a 17-item conceptual  questionnaire was first produced. Of the 91 NF1 adult patients who responded to  the conceptual questionnaire, 65 (64.6% females) were accessible. Subsequent  confirmatory analyses generated a 15-item questionnaire grouped into four  domains, demonstrating internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha: 091),  discriminant validity, and high reliability. The BoN was likewise shown to  significantly correlate with other validated questionnaires, such as Dermatology  Life Quality Index, Perceived Stress Scale, and SF12 mental score, indicating  good external validity. CONCLUSIONS: BoN is a specific tool for assessing the burden that NF1 generates  on many practical aspects of the patient daily activities, beyond the notion of  quality of life"". Given the increasing relevance that regulatory authorities  attribute to patient-reported outcomes, the BoN questionnaire provides such  supplementary information while accounting for the burden of NF1 patients in the  broadest sense.

Peripheral neurofibromatosis (NF) is one of the most common major genetic  disorders in man. Its chromosomal location is unknown and questions regarding  such factors as genetic heterogeneity remain unanswered. We have ascertained and  sampled several large multi-generation families for linkage studies including  one family of 66 subjects, 28 of whom were affected with NF. Recombinant DNA  studies of several restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) including  C3, ApoC2, pBam34 (D19S6], HAUP[APRT], pE40-1 [D11521], Hp[Hp2 alpha], LDR92,  and LDR111 failed to show a significant linkage (Z [lod score] greater than or  equal to 3.00) in this family. In addition, the results excluded areas of the  genome around the marker loci (Z greater than or equal to - 2.00) as potential  sites for linkage. The maximum Z obtained with the markers was for Hp at theta  (maximum recombination fraction) = 0.20 and Z = 0.399. We are now in the process  of screening additional RFLPs and families for linkage to NF.

(2)Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, University of California,  Davis, Davis, United States.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder whose  neurodevelopmental symptoms include impaired executive function, attention, and  spatial learning and could be due to perturbed mesolimbic dopaminergic  circuitry. However, these circuits have never been directly assayed in vivo. We  employed the genetically encoded optical dopamine sensor dLight1 to monitor  dopaminergic neurotransmission in the ventral striatum of NF1 mice during  motivated behavior. Additionally, we developed novel systemic AAV vectors to  facilitate morphological reconstruction of dopaminergic populations in cleared  tissue. We found that NF1 mice exhibit reduced spontaneous dopaminergic  neurotransmission that was associated with excitation/inhibition imbalance in  the ventral tegmental area and abnormal neuronal morphology. NF1 mice also had  more robust dopaminergic and behavioral responses to salient visual stimuli,  which were independent of learning, and rescued by optogenetic inhibition of  non-dopaminergic neurons in the VTA. Overall, these studies provide a first in  vivo characterization of dopaminergic circuit function in the context of NF1 and  reveal novel pathophysiological mechanisms.  © 2019, Robinson et al.

INTRODUCTION: Children with the single-gene disorder neurofibromatosis type 1  (NF1) appear to be at an increased risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and  exhibit a unique social-cognitive phenotype compared with children with  idiopathic ASD. A complete framework is required to better understand autism in  NF1, from neurobiological levels through to behavioural and functional outcomes.  The primary aims of this study are to establish the frequency of ASD in children  with NF1, examine the social cognitive phenotype, investigate the  neuropsychological processes contributing to ASD symptoms and poor social  functioning in children with NF1, and to investigate novel structural and  functional neurobiological markers of ASD and social dysfunction in NF1. The  secondary aim of this study is to compare the neuropsychological and  neurobiological features of ASD in children with NF1 to a matched group of  patients with idiopathic ASD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is an international, multisite, prospective,  cross-sectional cohort study of children with NF1, idiopathic ASD and typically  developing (TD) controls. Participants will be 200 children with NF1 (3-15 years  of age), 70 TD participants (3-15 years) and 35 children with idiopathic ASD  (7-15 years). Idiopathic ASD and NF1 cases will be matched on age, sex and  intelligence. All participants will complete cognitive testing and parents will  rate their child's behaviour on standardised questionnaires. Neuroimaging will  be completed by a subset of participants aged 7 years and older. Children with  NF1 that screen at risk for ASD on the parent-rated Social Responsiveness Scale  2nd Edition will be invited back to complete the Autism Diagnostic Observation  Scale 2nd Edition and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised to determine whether  they fulfil ASD diagnostic criteria. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has hospital ethics approval and the  results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and  international conferences.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Neurofibromin is a tumor suppressor encoded by the NF1 gene, which is mutated in  Rasopathy disease neurofibromatosis type I. Defects in NF1 lead to aberrant  signaling through the RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway due to  disruption of the neurofibromin GTPase-activating function on RAS family small  GTPases. Very little is known about the function of most of the neurofibromin  protein; to date, biochemical and structural data exist only for its GAP domain  and a region containing a Sec-PH motif. To better understand the role of this  large protein, here we carried out a series of biochemical and biophysical  experiments, including size-exclusion chromatography-multiangle light scattering  (SEC-MALS), small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering, and analytical  ultracentrifugation, indicating that full-length neurofibromin forms a  high-affinity dimer. We observed that neurofibromin dimerization also occurs in  human cells and likely has biological and clinical implications. Analysis of  purified full-length and truncated neurofibromin variants by negative-stain EM  revealed the overall architecture of the dimer and predicted the potential  interactions that contribute to the dimer interface. We could reconstitute  structures resembling high-affinity full-length dimers by mixing N- and  C-terminal protein domains in vitro The reconstituted neurofibromin was capable  of GTPase activation in vitro, and co-expression of the two domains in human  cells effectively recapitulated the activity of full-length neurofibromin. Taken  together, these results suggest how neurofibromin dimers might form and be  stabilized within the cell.  © 2020 Sherekar et al.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a monogenic syndrome that gives rise to  numerous symptoms including cognitive impairment, skeletal abnormalities, and  growth of benign nerve sheath tumors. Nearly all NF1 patients develop cutaneous  neurofibromas (cNFs), which occur on the skin surface, whereas 40-60% of  patients develop plexiform neurofibromas (pNFs), which are deeply embedded in  the peripheral nerves. Patients with pNFs have a ~10% lifetime chance of these  tumors becoming malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). These tumors  have a severe prognosis and few treatment options other than surgery. Given the  lack of therapeutic options available to patients with these tumors,  identification of druggable pathways or other key molecular features could aid  ongoing therapeutic discovery studies. In this work, we used statistical and  machine learning methods to analyze 77 NF1 tumors with genomic data to  characterize key signaling pathways that distinguish these tumors and identify  candidates for drug development. We identified subsets of latent gene expression  variables that may be important in the identification and etiology of cNFs,  pNFs, other neurofibromas, and MPNSTs. Furthermore, we characterized the  association between these latent variables and genetic variants, immune  deconvolution predictions, and protein activity predictions.

Despite being in the same pathway, Neurofibromatosis Type 1  (NF1) and Legius syndrome (LS) typically present with phenotypes distinct from  Noonan spectrum disorders (NSDs). However, some NF1/LS individuals also exhibit  NSD phenotypes, often referred to as Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome (NFNS),  and may be mistakenly evaluated for NSDs, delaying diagnosis, and affecting  patient management. METHODS: A derivation cohort of 28 patients with a prior negative NSD panel and  either NFNS or a suspicion of NSD and café-au-lait spots underwent NF1 and  SPRED1 sequencing. To further determine the utility and burden of adding these  genes, a validation cohort of 505 patients with a suspected RASopathy were  tested on a 14-gene RASopathy-associated panel. RESULTS: In the derivation cohort, six (21%) patients had disease-causing NF1 or  SPRED1 variants. In the validation cohort, 11 (2%) patients had disease-causing  variants and 15 (3%) had variants of uncertain significance in NF1 or SPRED1. Of  those with disease-causing variants, 5/17 only had an NSD diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Adding NF1 and SPRED1 to RASopathy panels can speed diagnosis and  improve patient management, without significantly increasing the burden of  inconclusive results.  © 2020 The Authors.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a rare, autosomal dominant disease with  variable clinical presentations. Large animal models are useful to help dissect  molecular mechanisms, determine relevant biomarkers, and develop effective  therapeutics. Here, we studied a NF1 minipig model (NF1+/ex42del) for the first  12 months of life to evaluate phenotype development, track disease progression,  and provide a comparison to human subjects. Through systematic evaluation, we  have shown that compared to littermate controls, the NF1 model develops  phenotypic characteristics of human NF1: [1] café-au-lait macules, [2]  axillary/inguinal freckling, [3] shortened stature, [4] tibial bone curvature,  and [5] neurofibroma. At 4 months, full body computed tomography imaging  detected significantly smaller long bones in NF1+/ex42del minipigs compared to  controls, indicative of shorter stature. We found quantitative evidence of  tibial bowing in a subpopulation of NF1 minipigs. By 8 months, an NF1+/ex42del  boar developed a large diffuse shoulder neurofibroma, visualized on magnetic  resonance imaging, which subsequently grew in size and depth as the animal aged  up to 20 months. The NF1+/ex42del minipig model progressively demonstrates  signature attributes that parallel clinical manifestations seen in humans and  provides a viable tool for future translational NF1 research.

Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1)-related Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors  (MPNST) are highly resistant sarcomas that account for significant mortality.  The mechanisms of therapy resistance are not well-understood in MPNSTs,  particularly with respect to kinase inhibition strategies. In this study, we  aimed to quantify the impact of both the genomic context and targeted therapy on  MPNST resistance using reverse phase phosphoproteome array (RPPA) analysis. We  treated tumorgrafts from three genetically engineered mouse models using MET  (capmatinib) and MEK (trametinib) inhibitors and doxorubicin, and assessed  phosphosignaling at 4 h, 2 days, and 21 days. Baseline kinase signaling in our  mouse models recapitulated an MET-addicted state (NF1-MET), P53 mutation  (NF1-P53), and HGF overexpression (NF1). Following perturbation with the drug,  we observed broad and redundant kinome adaptations that extended well beyond  canonical RAS/ERK or PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. MET and MEK inhibition were both  associated with an initial inflammatory response mediated by kinases in the  JAK/STAT pathway and NFkB. Growth signaling predominated at the 2-day and 21-day  time points as a result of broad RTK and intracellular kinase activation.  Interestingly, AXL and NFkB were strongly activated at the 2-day and 21-day time  points, and tightly correlated, regardless of the treatment type or genomic  context. The degree of kinome adaptation observed in innately resistant tumors  was significantly less than the surviving fractions of responsive tumors that  exhibited a latency period before reinitiating growth. Lastly, doxorubicin  resistance was associated with kinome adaptations that strongly favored growth  and survival signaling. These observations confirm that MPNSTs are capable of  profound signaling plasticity in the face of kinase inhibition or DNA damaging  agent administration. It is possible that by targeting AXL or NFkB, therapy  resistance can be mitigated.

The Genomics of Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor (GeM) Consortium is an  international collaboration focusing on multi-omic analysis of malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), the most aggressive tumor associated  with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Here we present a summary of current  knowledge gaps, a description of our consortium and the cohort we have  assembled, and an overview of our plans for multi-omic analysis of these tumors.  We propose that our analysis will lead to a better understanding of the order  and timing of genetic events related to MPNST initiation and progression. Our  ten institutions have assembled 96 fresh frozen NF1-related (63%) and sporadic  MPNST specimens from 86 subjects with corresponding clinical and pathological  data. Clinical data have been collected as part of the International MPNST  Registry. We will characterize these tumors with bulk whole genome sequencing,  RNAseq, and DNA methylation profiling. In addition, we will perform  multiregional analysis and temporal sampling, with the same methodologies, on a  subset of nine subjects with NF1-related MPNSTs to assess tumor heterogeneity  and cancer evolution. Subsequent multi-omic analyses of additional archival  specimens will include deep exome sequencing (500×) and high density copy number  arrays for both validation of results based on fresh frozen tumors, and to  assess further tumor heterogeneity and evolution. Digital pathology images are  being collected in a cloud-based platform for consensus review. The result of  these efforts will be the largest MPNST multi-omic dataset with correlated  clinical and pathological information ever assembled.

Cancer research has considerably progressed with the improvement of in vitro  study models, helping to understand the key role of the tumor microenvironment  in cancer development and progression. Over the last few years, complex 3D human  cell culture systems have gained much popularity over in vivo models, as they  accurately mimic the tumor microenvironment and allow high-throughput drug  screening. Of particular interest, in vitrohuman 3D tissue constructs, produced  by the self-assembly method of tissue engineering, have been successfully used  to model the tumor microenvironment and now represent a very promising approach  to further develop diverse cancer models. In this review, we describe the  importance of the tumor microenvironment and present the existing in vitro  cancer models generated through the self-assembly method of tissue engineering.  Lastly, we highlight the relevance of this approach to mimic various and complex  tumors, including basal cell carcinoma, cutaneous neurofibroma, skin melanoma,  bladder cancer, and uveal melanoma.

AIM: To evaluate if autism symptoms and diagnoses are more common in children  with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) than in typically developing children, to  which levels, and to determine if co-occurring attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder (ADHD) symptomatology accounts for this increase. METHOD: We searched hospital electronic medical records (EMR) for International  Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision NF1 and co-occurring diagnoses codes.  We recruited a subsample of 45 children (mean age 9y 2mo; SD 2y 7mo; range  5-12y; 22 males, 23 females) and collected parental reports of autism  symptomatology, adaptive behavior, and behavioral problems that were compared to  those of 360 age- and sex-matched controls from the Simons Simplex Collection  (SSC) with autism spectrum disorder (ASD; SSC-ASD) or typically developing  (SSC-TD). RESULTS: The EMR search identified 968 children with NF1; 8.8% had ADHD and 2.1%  had ASD co-occurring diagnoses. In the subsample, the mean autism scale score  for participants with NF1 was below cut-off for significant autism symptoms.  Participants with NF1 had significantly more autism and behavioral symptoms than  SSC-TD participants, and significantly less than SSC-ASD participants, with one  exception: ADHD symptom levels were similar to those of SSC-ASD participants. In  analyses that controlled for internalizing, ADHD, and communication scores, the  difference in autism symptom levels between participants with NF1 and typically  developing controls disappeared almost entirely. INTERPRETATION: Our results do not support an association between NF1 and  autism, both at the symptom and disorder levels. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Diagnoses of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder  (ADHD) were more common in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) than in  the general child population. Diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder were no more  common in children with NF1 than in the general child population. Increases in  autism symptoms did not reach clinically significant thresholds. Co-occurring  ADHD symptoms accounted for increased autism questionnaire scores. Adaptive  behavior in participants with NF1 showed normal socialization but lower  communication proficiency.  Publisher: OBJETIVO: Evaluar si el diagnóstico y los síntomas de autismo son más  frecuentes en niños con neurofibromatosis tipo 1 (NF1) comparado a niños con  desarrollo típico, cuáles son los niveles de severidad, y determinar si la  sintomatología concurrente debido déficit de atención / hiperactividad (TDAH)  explica la frecuencia. MÉTODO: Se realizaron búsquedas en los registros médicos  electrónicos hospitalarios (EMR) para el diagnóstico de NF1 y códigos  concurrentes en la Clasificación Internacional de Enfermedades, 10ma revisión.  Reclutamos una submuestra de 45 niños (edad promedio 9 años 2 meses; DE 2 años 7  meses; rango 5-12 años; 22 varones y 23 mujeres). Recolectamos informes  parentales acerca de la sintomatología del autismo, comportamiento adaptativo y  problemas de conducta que se compararon con los de 360 niños pareados por edad y  sexo provenientes de la Colección Simons Simplex (SSC) de niños con trastorno  del espectro autista (SSC-ASD) o de niños con desarrollo típico (SSC-TD). RESULTADOS: La búsqueda de EMR identificó a 968 niños con NF1; 8,8% tenían TDAH  y 2,1% tenían diagnósticos concurrentes de trastorno del espectro autista. En la  submuestra de participantes con NF1, la media de puntaje de la escala de autismo  fue inferior punto de corte. Los participantes con NF1 tuvieron  significativamente más síntomas de autismo y problemas de conducta que los  participantes de SSC-TD, y significativamente menos que los participantes de  SSC-ASD. Hubo una excepción: los niveles de síntomas de TDAH fueron similares a  los de los participantes de SSC-ASD. En los análisis que controlaron los  síntomas internalizantes, el TDAH y los puntajes de comunicación, la diferencia  en los niveles de síntomas de autismo entre los participantes con NF1 y los  controles con desarrollo típico desaparecieron casi por completo.  INTERPRETACIÓN: Nuestros resultados no respaldan una asociación entre NF1 y  autismo, tanto a nivel de frecuencia de los síntomas, ni con la severidad de los  mismos.

RESULTADOS: A busca em RME identificou 968 crianças com NF1; 8,8% tinha TDAH e  2,1% tinha diagnóstico concomitante de TEA. Na sub-amostra, o escore médio de  autismo para os participantes com NF1 estava abaixo do ponto de corte para  sintomas autistas significantes. Os participantes com NF1 tiveram  significativamente mais sintomas de autismo e comportamento do que os  participantes SSC-DT, e significativamente menos do que os participantes  SSC-TEA, com uma exceção: os níveis de sintomas de TDAH foram similares aos  participantes SSC-TEA. Na análise que controlou para escores internalizantes,  TDAH e comunicação, a diferença nos níveis de sintomas autistas entre  participantes com NF1 e desenvolvimento típico desapareceu quase totalmente.  INTERPRETAÇÃO: Nossos resultados não suportam associação entre NF1 e autismo,  mas com os sintomas e níveis de desordem.  © 2020 Mac Keith Press.

Some of these techniques have matured to  a level that has allowed testing in clinical trials, but few have made it to  approval by drug-regulatory bodies for the treatment of specific diseases. While  there are still various hurdles to be overcome, recent success stories have  proven the potential power of mutation-directed therapies and have fueled the  hope of finding therapeutics for other genetic disorders. In this review, we  summarize the state-of-the-art of various therapeutic approaches and assess  their applicability to the genetic disorder neurofibromatosis type I (NF1). NF1  is caused by the loss of function of neurofibromin, a tumor suppressor and  downregulator of the Ras signaling pathway. The condition is characterized by a  variety of phenotypes and includes symptoms such as skin spots, nervous system  tumors, skeletal dysplasia, and others. Hence, depending on the patient,  therapeutics may need to target different tissues and cell types. While we also  discuss the delivery of therapeutics, in particular via viral vectors and  nanoparticles, our main focus is on therapeutic techniques that reconstitute  functional neurofibromin, most notably cDNA replacement, CRISPR-based DNA  repair, RNA repair, antisense oligonucleotide therapeutics including exon  skipping, and nonsense suppression.

Primary brain tumors are a rare occurrence in comparison to other malignancies,  the most predominant form being glioma. Commonly, exposure to ionizing  radiations and inheritance of associated conditions such a neurofibromatosis and  tuberous sclerosis are the most common causes of development of glioma. However,  understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive glioma development is  limited. We explore the role of aberration of microRNA namely miR-494-3p through  long noncoding RNA WT1-AS in the development of gliomas. In this study, we found  that, levels of WT1-AS were significantly reduced in glioma tissues and cell  lines. The miR-494-3p levels were negatively correlated with WT1-AS levels. The  cellular proliferation and invasiveness decreased in WT1-AS transfected cell  lines. Further the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of  chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide was significantly reduced in the presence of  WT1-AS. The cotransfection of WT1-AS and miR-494-3p reduced activation of  phospho-AKT (p-AKT). Expression of miR-494-3p is modulated by binding to long  noncoding RNA WT1-AS. Deregulation of WT1-AS leads to aberrant expression of  miR-494-3p leading to hyperactivation of AKT. This malformation may result in  altering protective immune responses in malignancies. Targeting of WT1-AS,  miR-494-3p, and AKT may be novel therapeutic options in treatment of glioma.

OBJECTIVES: The objective was to explore the effect of the proneuronal  transcription factor neurogenic differentiation 1 (Neurod1, ND1) on Schwann  cells (SC) and schwannoma cell proliferation. METHODS: Using a variety of transgenic mouse lines, we investigated how  expression of Neurod1 effects medulloblastoma (MB) growth, schwannoma tumor  progression, vestibular function, and SC cell proliferation. Primary human  vestibular schwannoma (VS) cell cultures were transduced with adenoviral vectors  expressing Neurod1. Cell proliferation was assessed by 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine  (EdU) uptake. STUDY DESIGN: Basic science investigation. RESULTS: Expression of Neurod1 reduced the growth of slow-growing but not  fast-growing MB models. Gene transfer of Neurod1 in human schwannoma cultures  significantly reduced cell proliferation in dose-dependent way. Deletion of the  neurofibromatosis type 2 (Nf2) tumor-suppressor gene via Cre expression in SCs  led to increased intraganglionic SC proliferation and mildly reduced vestibular  sensory-evoked potentials (VsEP) responses compared to age-matched wild-type  littermates. The effect of Neurod1-induced expression on intraganglionic SC  proliferation in animals lacking Nf2 was mild and highly variable. Sciatic nerve  axotomy significantly increased SC proliferation in wild-type and Nf2-null  animals, and expression of Neurod1 reduced the proliferative capacity of both  wild-type and Nf2-null SCs following nerve injury. CONCLUSION: Expression of Neurod1 reduces slow-growing MB progression and  reduces human SC proliferation in primary VS cultures. In a genetic mouse model  of schwannomas, we find some effects of Neurod1 expression; however, the high  variability indicates that more tightly regulated Neurod1 expression levels that  mimic our in vitro data are needed to fully validate Neurod1 effects on  schwannoma progression.

Aims: TNF receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1), the mitochondrial paralog of  the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) family of molecular chaperones, is required  for neoplastic growth in several tumor cell models, where it inhibits succinate  dehydrogenase (SDH) activity, thus favoring bioenergetic rewiring, maintenance  of redox homeostasis, and orchestration of a hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha  (HIF1α)-mediated pseudohypoxic program. Development of selective TRAP1  inhibitors is instrumental for targeted development of antineoplastic drugs, but  it has been hampered up to now by the high degree of homology among catalytic  pockets of Hsp90 family members. The vegetal derivative honokiol and its  lipophilic bis-dichloroacetate ester, honokiol DCA (HDCA), are small-molecule  compounds with antineoplastic activity. HDCA leads to oxidative stress and  apoptosis in in vivo tumor models and displays an action that is functionally  opposed to that of TRAP1, as it induces both SDH and the mitochondrial  deacetylase sirtuin-3 (SIRT3), which further enhances SDH activity. We  investigated whether HDCA could interact with TRAP1, inhibiting its chaperone  function, and the effects of HDCA on tumor cells harboring TRAP1. Results: An  allosteric binding site in TRAP1 is able to host HDCA, which inhibits TRAP1 but  not Hsp90 ATPase activity. In neoplastic cells, HDCA reverts TRAP1-dependent  downregulation of SDH, decreases proliferation rate, increases mitochondrial  superoxide levels, and abolishes tumorigenic growth. Innovation: HDCA is a  potential lead compound for the generation of antineoplastic approaches based on  the allosteric inhibition of TRAP1 chaperone activity. Conclusions: We have  identified a selective TRAP1 inhibitor that can be used to better dissect TRAP1  biochemical functions and to tailor novel tumor-targeting strategies.

Schwannomatosis is the third form of neurofibromatosis and characterized by the  occurrence of multiple schwannomas. The most prominent symptom is chronic pain.  We aimed to test whether pain in schwannomatosis might be caused by small-fiber  neuropathy. Twenty patients with schwannomatosis underwent neurological  examination and nerve conduction studies. Levels of pain perception as well as  anxiety and depression were assessed by established questionnaires. Quantitative  sensory testing (QST) and laser-evoked potentials (LEP) were performed on  patients and controls. Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (wbMRI) and  magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) were performed to quantify tumors and  fascicular nerve lesions; skin biopsies were performed to determine  intra-epidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD). All patients suffered from chronic  pain without further neurological deficits. The questionnaires indicated  neuropathic symptoms with significant impact on quality of life. Peripheral  nerve tumors were detected in all patients by wbMRI. MRN showed additional  multiple fascicular nerve lesions in 16/18 patients. LEP showed significant  faster latencies compared to normal controls. Finally, IENFD was significantly  reduced in 13/14 patients. Our study therefore indicates the presence of  small-fiber neuropathy, predominantly of unmyelinated C-fibers. Fascicular nerve  lesions are characteristic disease features that are associated with faster LEP  latencies and decreased IENFD. Together these methods may facilitate  differential diagnosis of schwannomatosis.

Author information: (1)Section for Cell Biology and Physiology, Department of Biology, Faculty of  Science, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.  Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a major cause of cancer-related  death, with a 5-year survival of <10% and severely limited treatment options.  PDAC hallmarks include profound metabolic acid production and aggressive local  proliferation and invasiveness. This phenotype is supported by upregulated net  acid extrusion and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), the latter  typically induced by aberrant transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) signaling. It  is, however, unknown whether TGFβ-induced EMT and upregulation of acid extrusion  are causally related. Here, we show that mRNA and protein expression of the net  acid extruding transporters Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1, SLC9A1) and Na+, HCO 3-  cotransporter 1 (NBCn1, SLC4A7) are increased in a panel of human PDAC cell  lines compared to immortalized human pancreatic ductal epithelial (HPDE) cells.  Treatment of Panc-1 cells (which express SMAD4, required for canonical TGFβ  signaling) with TGFβ-1 for 48 h elicited classical EMT with down- and  upregulation of epithelial and mesenchymal markers, respectively, in a manner  inhibited by SMAD4 knockdown. Accordingly, less pronounced EMT was induced in  BxPC-3 cells, which do not express SMAD4. TGFβ-1 treatment elicited a  SMAD4-dependent increase in NHE1 expression, and a smaller, SMAD4-independent  increase in NBCn1 in Panc-1 cells. Consistent with this, TGFβ-1 treatment led to  elevated intracellular pH and increased net acid extrusion capacity in Panc-1  cells, but not in BxPC-3 cells, in an NHE1-dependent manner. Proliferation was  increased in Panc-1 cells and decreased in BxPC-3 cells, upon TGFβ-1 treatment,  and this, as well as EMT per se, was unaffected by NHE1- or NBCn1 inhibition.  TGFβ-1-induced EMT was associated with a 4-fold increase in Panc-1 cell  invasiveness, which further increased ~10-fold upon knockdown of the tumor  suppressor Merlin (Neurofibromatosis type 2). Knockdown of NHE1 or NBCn1  abolished Merlin-induced invasiveness, but not that induced by TGFβ-1 alone. In  conclusion, NHE1 and NBCn1 expression and NHE-dependent acid extrusion are  upregulated during TGFβ-1-induced EMT of Panc-1 cells. NHE1 upregulation is  SMAD4-dependent, and SMAD4-deficient BxPC-3 cells show no change in pHi  regulation. NHE1 and NBCn1 are not required for EMT per se or EMT-associated  proliferation changes, but are essential for the potentiation of invasiveness  induced by Merlin knockdown.

(#)Contributed equally  High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HG-SOC)-often referred to as a ""silent  killer""-is the most lethal gynecological malignancy. The fallopian tube (murine  oviduct) and ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) are considered the main candidate  tissues of origin of this cancer. However, the relative contribution of each  tissue to HG-SOC is not yet clear. Here, we establish organoid-based tumor  progression models of HG-SOC from murine oviductal and OSE tissues. We use  CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to introduce mutations into genes commonly found  mutated in HG-SOC, such as Trp53, Brca1, Nf1 and Pten. Our results support the  dual origin hypothesis of HG-SOC, as we demonstrate that both epithelia can give  rise to ovarian tumors with high-grade pathology. However, the mutated oviductal  organoids expand much faster in vitro and more readily form malignant tumors  upon transplantation. Furthermore, in vitro drug testing reveals distinct  lineage-dependent sensitivities to the common drugs used to treat HG-SOC in  patients.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common cancer predisposition syndrome caused  by mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene. NF1 encodes neurofibromin, a  GTPase-activating protein for RAS proto-oncogene GTPase (RAS). Plexiform  neurofibromas are a hallmark of NF1 and result from loss of heterozygosity of  NF1 in Schwann cells, leading to constitutively activated p21RAS. Given the  inability to target p21RAS directly, here we performed an shRNA library screen  of all human kinases and Rho-GTPases in a patient-derived NF1-/- Schwann cell  line to identify novel therapeutic targets to disrupt PN formation and  progression. Rho family members, including Rac family small GTPase 1 (RAC1),  were identified as candidates. Corroborating these findings, we observed that  shRNA-mediated knockdown of RAC1 reduces cell proliferation and phosphorylation  of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in NF1-/- Schwann cells.  Genetically engineered Nf1flox/flox;PostnCre+ mice, which develop multiple PNs,  also exhibited increased RAC1-GTP and phospho-ERK levels compared with  Nf1flox/flox;PostnCre- littermates. Notably, mice in which both Nf1 and Rac1  loci were disrupted (Nf1flox/floxRac1flox/flox;PostnCre+) were completely free  of tumors and had normal phospho-ERK activity compared with Nf1flox/flox  ;PostnCre+ mice. We conclude that the RAC1-GTPase is a key downstream node of  RAS and that genetic disruption of the Rac1 allele completely prevents PN tumor  formation in vivo in mice.  © 2020 Mund et al.

BACKGROUND: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) constitutes the  leading cause of neurofibromatosis type 1-related mortality. MPNSTs contain  highly rearranged hyperploid genomes and exhibit a high division rate and  aggressiveness. We have studied in vitro whether the mitotic kinesins KIF11,  KIF15, and KIF23 have a functional role in maintaining MPNST cell survival and  can represent potential therapeutic vulnerabilities. METHODS: We studied the expression of kinesin mRNAs and proteins in tumors and  cell lines and used several in vitro functional assays to analyze the impact of  kinesin genetic suppression (KIF15, KIF23) and drug inhibition (KIF11) in MPNST  cells. We also performed in vitro combined treatments targeting KIF11 together  with other described MPNST targets. RESULTS: The studied kinesins were overexpressed in MPNST samples. KIF15 and  KIF23 were required for the survival of MPNST cell lines, which were also more  sensitive than benign control fibroblasts to the KIF11 inhibitors ispinesib and  ARRY-520. Co-targeting KIF11 and BRD4 with ARRY-520 and JQ1 reduced MPNST cell  viability, synergistically killing a much higher proportion of MPNST cells than  control fibroblasts. In addition, genetic suppression of KIF15 conferred an  increased sensitivity to KIF11 inhibitors alone or in combination with JQ1. CONCLUSIONS: The mitotic spindle kinesins KIF11 and KIF15 and the cytokinetic  kinesin KIF23 play a clear role in maintaining MPNST cell survival and may  represent potential therapeutic vulnerabilities. Although further in vivo  evidences are still mandatory, we propose a simultaneous suppression of KIF11,  KIF15, and BRD4 as a potential therapy for MPNSTs.  © The Author(s) 2020.

BACKGROUND: Cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs) are the most common tumors in people  with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and are associated with reduced quality of  life. There is currently no widely accepted standardized language for describing  cNFs clinically or histopathologically. The objective of this study was to  evaluate interobserver agreement across pathologists in describing and reporting  of neurofibromas involving the skin. METHODS: Twenty-eight (H&E)-stained slides of cNF were scanned using an Aperio  XT scanner. The digital images were reviewed by 6 pathologists, who entered free  text of up to a 200 word description for each case into a REDcap database.  Responses were analyzed for the most commonly used terms based on frequency, as  well as agreement (reported as concordance) between reviewers. RESULTS: A set of the terms most commonly used by pathologists for the  histological classification of cNF along with areas of agreement and  disagreement have been identified. The study shows that there was strong  agreement across reviewers that not all neurofibromas involving the skin are  cutaneous neurofibromas and regarding the presence or absence of atypical  features and heterologous elements. Areas of less concordance were identified  and include cNF subtypes, definition of extension and pattern of growth, as well  as the distinction of a cNF from a plexiform without an intraneural component  involving skin. CONCLUSIONS: This work is the first step towards development of a robust  classification system and devising ""gold standard"" histopathologic diagnostic  criteria for cutaneous neurofibromas.  © The Author(s) 2019.

Up to 10% of all pediatric cancer patients may have an underlying germline  mutation which predisposed them to develop a malignancy. With more patients  being tested for and diagnosed with genetic tumor predisposition syndromes,  there has been improved characterization of their many nonmalignant  manifestations. However, designing and implementing clinical trials to treat the  nonmalignant tumor and non-tumor manifestations of these syndromes poses many  unique challenges. Unlike trials for malignancies where tumor response and  survival can be used as straightforward trial endpoints, the nonmalignant  manifestations are often chronic, evolve more slowly over time, and may not be  immediately life-threatening. Therefore, they will likely require a different  approach to both testing and treatment with a focus on more functional and  patient-reported outcome trial endpoints. The recent success of treatment trials  for the benign tumors plexiform neurofibromas in the tumor predisposition  syndrome neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) can be used as a model for the  development of clinical trials in other tumor predisposition syndromes. In this  article, we review the unique challenges associated with targeting the  nonmalignant aspects of these conditions as well as some of the lessons learned  from the NF1 experience which may be applied to other syndromes in the future.

BACKGROUND: There is scarce data on the quality of life of people with  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and type 2 (NF2) in Canada. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of adults with NF1 and NF2 attending a tertiary  center. Patients completed generic measures (SF-36, EQ-5D-5L, and PROMIS pain  interference) and disease-specific questionnaires (PedsQL NF1 module and the  NFTI-QOL for NF2). We compared generic scores between NF1 and NF2 individuals  and used regression models to assess factors associated with quality of life. RESULTS: Hundred and eighty-four participants were enrolled. Mean age was 33  years in NF1 and 40 years in NF2. NF1 and NF2 individuals had lower employment  rates and lower scores in all domains of the SF-36 compared to the general  Canadian population (P < .005). Using the EQ-5D-5L, there was a high proportion  of pain (64% in NF1 and 74% in NF2) and anxiety/depression (60% in NF1 and 68%  in NF2). Pain interference correlated with poor quality of life in NF1 and NF2;  perceived physical appearance was the main predictor of mental well-being in  NF1. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with NF1 and NF2 have low quality of life, and this  correlates with pain, anxiety, and depression, which are prevalent in NF1 and  NF2. Perceived physical appearance predicts quality of life in NF1. A  multidisciplinary approach is necessary for patients with NF1 and NF2, including  mental health and pain management.  © The Author(s) 2020.

(#)Contributed equally  Recent characterization of spatiotemporal genomic architecture of IDH-wild-type  multifocal glioblastomas (M-GBMs) suggests a clinically unobserved  common-ancestor (CA) with a less aggressive phenotype, generating highly  genetically divergent malignant gliomas/GBMs in distant brain regions. Using  serial MRI/3D-reconstruction, whole-genome sequencing and spectral  karyotyping-based single-cell phylogenetic tree building, we show two distinct  types of tumor evolution in p53-mutant driven mouse models. Malignant  gliomas/GBMs grow as a single mass (Type 1) and multifocal masses (Type 2),  respectively, despite both exhibiting loss of Pten/chromosome 19 (chr19) and  PI3K/Akt activation with sub-tetraploid/4N genomes. Analysis of early biopsied  and multi-segment tumor tissues reveals no evidence of less proliferative  diploid/2N lesions in Type 1 tumors. Strikingly, CA-derived relatively quiescent  tumor precursors with ancestral diploid/2N genomes and normal Pten/chr19 are  observed in the subventricular zone (SVZ), but are distantly segregated from  multi focal Type 2 tumors. Importantly, PI3K/Akt inhibition by Rictor/mTORC2  deletion blocks distant dispersal, restricting glioma growth in the SVZ.

Neurofibromatosis Type 2- (NF2-) associated vestibular schwannomas (VSs) are  histologically benign tumors. This study aimed to determine disease-related  genes, pathways, and potential therapeutic drugs associated with NF2-VSs using  the bioinformatics method. Microarray data of GSE108524 were downloaded from the  Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and differentially expressed genes  (DEGs) were screened using GEO2R. The functional enrichment and pathway  enrichment of DEGs were performed using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto  Encyclopedia of Genes Genomes (KEGG). Furthermore, the STRING and Cytoscape were  used to analyze the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of all  differentially expressed genes and identify hub genes. Finally, the enriched  gene sets belonging to the identified pathways were queried against the  Drug-Gene Interaction database to find drug candidates for topical use in  NF2-associated VSs. A total of 542 DEGs were identified, including 13  upregulated and 329 downregulated genes, which were mainly enriched in terms of  focal adhesion, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, ECM-receptor interaction, Toll-like  receptor signaling pathway, Rap1 signaling pathway, and regulation of actin  cytoskeleton. 28 hub genes were identified based on the subset of PPI network,  and 31 drugs were selected based on the Drug-Gene Interaction database. Drug  discovery using bioinformatics methods facilitates the identification of  existing or potential therapeutic drugs to improve NF2 treatment.  Copyright © 2020 Qiao Huang et al.

Electronic address: bstansfield@augusta.edu.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a heritable cancer predisposition syndrome  resulting from mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene. Genotype-phenotype  correlations for NF1 are rare due to the large number of NF1 mutations and role  of modifier genes in manifestations of NF1; however, emerging reports suggest  that persons with NF1 display a distinct anthropometric and metabolic phenotype  featuring short stature, low body mass index, increased insulin sensitivity, and  protection from diabetes. Nf1 heterozygous (Nf1+/-) mice accurately reflect the  dominant inheritance of NF1 and are regularly employed as a model of NF1. Here,  we sought to identify whether Nf1+/- mice recapitulate the anthropometric and  metabolic features identified in persons with NF1. Littermate 16-20 week-old  male wildtype (WT) and Nf1+/- C57B/6J mice underwent nuclear magnetic resonance  (NMR), indirect calorimetry, and glucose/insulin/pyruvate tolerance testing. In  some experiments, tissues were harvested for NMR and histologic  characterization. Nf1+/- mice are leaner with significantly reduced visceral and  subcutaneous fat mass, which corresponds with an increased density of small  adipocytes and reduced leptin levels. Additionally, Nf1+/- mice are highly  reliant on carbohydrates as an energy substrate and display increased glucose  clearance and insulin sensitivity, but normal response to pyruvate suggesting  enhanced glucose utilization and preserved gluconeogenesis. Finally, WT and  Nf1+/- mice subjected to high glucose diet were protected from diet-induced  obesity and hyperglycemia. Our data suggest that Nf1+/- mice closely  recapitulate the anthropometric and metabolic phenotype identified in persons  with NF1, which will impact the interpretation of previous and future  translational studies of NF1.

Aronson PJ(1), Ito K, Fukaya T, Hashimoto K, Mehregan AH.  Author information: (1)Department of Dermatology and Syphilology, Wayne State University School of  Medicine, Detroit, Michigan 48201.  The mouse monoclonal antibody AFH1 was produced using formalin-fixed, sham  paraffin-embedded human melanoma cell culture line A375 as immunogen. Reactivity  of this antibody was assessed by immunohistochemical techniques against  formalin- or acid alcohol-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue as well as formalin- or  acid alcohol-fixed unembedded lesions. Ninety-seven nevomelanocytic lesions,  neurofibromas, epithelial lesions, and a plasmacellular infiltrate were  evaluated. AFH1 was immunoreactive on 54 of 55 nevocytic lesions (98.2%), 15 of  16 primary melanomas (93.7%), a lentigo maligna, and nests in 21 of 21  dysplastic nevi (100%). Of 100 consecutive basal melanocytes of intraepidermal  melanoma cells counted in each lesion, mean AFH1 immunoreactivity for nonnested  basal melanocytes in nevocellular nevi was 3.8%; for dysplastic nevi, 13.8%; and  for intraepidermal melanoma cells, 78.0%. When nonnested basal melanocytes were  subdivided into cytologically normal and abnormal cell groups, AFH1  immunoreactivity was 9.4% and 72.6%, respectively. AFH1 recognition of the  lentiginous portion of dysplastic nevi corresponds statistically to the  appearance of abnormal melanocyte cytology, nest formation, or both. Using 50%  immunoreactive nonnested melanocytes as the criterion, AFH1 seems to distinguish  primary melanoma from dysplastic nevi with a sensitivity of 93.8% and a  specificity of 95.8%.

Neurofibromin gene (NF1) mutation causes neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a  disorder in which brain white matter deficits identified by neuroimaging are  common, yet of unknown cellular etiology. In mice, Nf1 loss in adult  oligodendrocytes causes myelin decompaction and increases oligodendrocyte nitric  oxide (NO) levels. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors rescue this pathology.  Whether oligodendrocyte pathology is sufficient to affect brain-wide structure  and account for NF1 imaging findings is unknown. Here we show that Nf1 gene  inactivation in adult oligodendrocytes (Plp-Nf1fl/+ mice) results in a motor  coordination deficit. Magnetic resonance imaging in awake mice showed that  fractional anisotropy is reduced in Plp-Nf1fl/+ corpus callosum and that  interhemispheric functional connectivity in the motor cortex is also reduced,  consistent with disrupted myelin integrity. Furthermore, NOS-specific inhibition  rescued both measures. These results suggest that oligodendrocyte defects  account for aspects of brain dysfunction in NF1 that can be identified by  neuroimaging and ameliorated by NOS inhibition.

Neurofibromatosis type (NF1) is a syndrome characterized by varied symptoms,  ranging from mild to more aggressive phenotypes. The variation is not explained  only by genetic and epigenetic changes in the NF1 gene and the concept of  phenotype-modifier genes in extensively discussed in an attempt to explain this  variability. Many datasets and tools are already available to explore the  relationship between genetic variation and disease, including systems biology  and expression data. To suggest potential NF1 modifier genes, we selected  proteins related to NF1 phenotype and NF1 gene ontologies. Protein-protein  interaction (PPI) networks were assembled, and network statistics were obtained  by using forward and reverse genetics strategies. We also evaluated the  heterogeneous networks comprising the phenotype ontologies selected, gene  expression data, and the PPI network. Finally, the hypothesized  phenotype-modifier genes were verified by a random-walk mathematical model. The  network statistics analyses combined with the forward and reverse genetics  strategies, and the assembly of heterogeneous networks, resulted in ten  potential phenotype-modifier genes: AKT1, BRAF, EGFR, LIMK1, PAK1, PTEN, RAF1,  SDC2, SMARCA4, and VCP. Mathematical models using the random-walk approach  suggested SDC2 and VCP as the main candidate genes for phenotype-modifiers.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a tumor-predisposition disorder  that arises due to pathogenic variants in tumor suppressor NF1. NF1 has variable  expressivity that may be due, at least in part, from heritable elements such as  modifier genes; however, few genetic modifiers have been identified to date. METHODS: In this study, we performed a genome-wide association analysis of the  number of café-au-lait macules (CALM) that are considered a tumor-like trait as  a clinical phenotype modifying NF1. RESULTS: A borderline genome-wide significant association was identified in the  discovery cohort (CALM1, N = 112) between CALM number and rs12190451 (and  rs3799603, r2  = 1.0; p = 7.4 × 10-8 ) in the intronic region of RPS6KA2.  Although, this association was not replicated in the second cohort (CALM2,  N = 59) and a meta-analysis did not show significantly associated variants in  this region, a significant corroboration score (0.72) was obtained for the  RPS6KA2 signal in the discovery cohort (CALM1) using Complementary Pairs  Stability Selection for Genome-Wide Association Studies (ComPaSS-GWAS) analysis,  suggesting that the lack of replication may be due to heterogeneity of the  cohorts rather than type I error. CONCLUSION: rs12190451 is located in a melanocyte-specific enhancer and may  influence RPS6KA2 expression in melanocytes-warranting further functional  studies.  © Published 2020.

BACKGROUND: Anticancer compound 3-bromopyruvate (3-BrPA) suppresses cancer cell  growth via targeting glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism. The malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), a very aggressive, therapy resistant, and  Neurofibromatosis type 1 associated neoplasia, shows a high metabolic activity  and affected patients may therefore benefit from 3-BrPA treatment. To elucidate  the specific mode of action, we used a controlled cell model overexpressing  proteasome activator (PA) 28, subsequently leading to p53 inactivation and  oncogenic transformation and therefore reproducing an important pathway in MPNST  and overall tumor pathogenesis. METHODS: Viability of MPNST cell lines S462, NSF1, and T265 in response to  increasing doses (0-120 μM) of 3-BrPA was analyzed by CellTiter-Blue® assay.  Additionally, we investigated viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS)  production (dihydroethidium assay), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide  dehydrogenase activity (NADH-TR assay) and lactate production (lactate assay) in  mouse B8 fibroblasts overexpressing PA28 in response to 3-BrPA application. For  all experiments normal and nutrient deficient conditions were tested. MPNST cell  lines were furthermore characterized immunohistochemically for Ki67, p53, bcl2,  bcl6, cyclin D1, and p21. RESULTS: MPNST significantly responded dose dependent to 3-BrPA application,  whereby S462 cells were most responsive. Human control cells showed a reduced  sensitivity. In PA28 overexpressing cancer cell model 3-BrPA application harmed  mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase activity mildly and significantly failed to  inhibit lactate production. PA28 overexpression was associated with a functional  glycolysis as well as a partial resistance to stress provoked by nutrient  deprivation. 3-BrPA treatment was not associated with an increase of ROS.  Starvation sensitized MPNST to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive MPNST cells are sensitive to 3-BrPA therapy in-vitro  with and without starvation. In a PA28 overexpression cancer cell model leading  to p53 inactivation, thereby reflecting a key molecular feature in human NF1  associated MPNST, known functions of 3-BrPA to block mitochondrial activity and  glycolysis were reproduced, however oncogenic cells displayed a partial  resistance. To conclude, 3-BrPA was sufficient to reduce NF1 associated MPNST  viability potentially due inhibition of glycolysis which should lead to the  initiation of further studies and promises a potential benefit for NF1 patients.

Loss of the RAS GTPase-activating protein (RAS-GAP) NF1 drives aberrant  activation of RAS/MEK/ERK signaling and other effector pathways in the majority  of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). These dysregulated pathways  represent potential targets for therapeutic intervention. However, studies of  novel single agents including MEK inhibitors (MEKi) have demonstrated limited  efficacy both preclinically and clinically, with little advancement in overall  patient survival. By interrogation of kinome activity through an unbiased screen  and targeted evaluation of the signaling response to MEK inhibition, we have  identified global activation of upstream receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) that  converges on activation of RAS as a mechanism to limit sensitivity to MEK  inhibition. As no direct inhibitors of pan-RAS were available, an inhibitor of  the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, a critical mediator of RAS signal  transduction downstream of multiple RTK, represented an alternate strategy. The  combination of MEKi plus SHP099 was superior to MEKi alone in models of  NF1-MPNST, including those with acquired resistance to MEKi. Our findings have  immediate translational implications and may inform future clinical trials for  patients with MPNST harboring alterations in NF1. SIGNIFICANCE: Combined  inhibition of MEK and SHP2 is effective in models of NF1-MPNST, both those naïve  to and those resistant to MEKi, as well as in the MPNST precursor lesion  plexiform neurofibroma.  ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a multi-organ disease caused by  mutations in neurofibromin 1 (NF1). Amongst other features, NF1 patients  frequently show reduced muscle mass and strength, impairing patients' mobility  and increasing the risk of fall. The role of Nf1 in muscle and the cause for the  NF1-associated myopathy are mostly unknown. METHODS: To dissect the function of Nf1 in muscle, we created muscle-specific  knockout mouse models for NF1, inactivating Nf1 in the prenatal myogenic lineage  either under the Lbx1 promoter or under the Myf5 promoter. Mice were analysed  during prenatal and postnatal myogenesis and muscle growth. RESULTS: Nf1Lbx1 and Nf1Myf5 animals showed only mild defects in prenatal  myogenesis. Nf1Lbx1 animals were perinatally lethal, while Nf1Myf5 animals  survived only up to approximately 25 weeks. A comprehensive phenotypic  characterization of Nf1Myf5 animals showed decreased postnatal growth, reduced  muscle size, and fast fibre atrophy. Proteome and transcriptome analyses of  muscle tissue indicated decreased protein synthesis and increased proteasomal  degradation, and decreased glycolytic and increased oxidative activity in muscle  tissue. High-resolution respirometry confirmed enhanced oxidative metabolism in  Nf1Myf5 muscles, which was concomitant to a fibre type shift from type 2B to  type 2A and type 1. Moreover, Nf1Myf5 muscles showed hallmarks of decreased  activation of mTORC1 and increased expression of atrogenes. Remarkably, loss of  Nf1 promoted a robust activation of AMPK with a gene expression profile  indicative of increased fatty acid catabolism. Additionally, we observed a  strong induction of genes encoding catabolic cytokines in muscle Nf1Myf5  animals, in line with a drastic reduction of white, but not brown adipose  tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate a cell autonomous role for Nf1 in myogenic  cells during postnatal muscle growth required for metabolic and proteostatic  homeostasis. Furthermore, Nf1 deficiency in muscle drives cross-tissue  communication and mobilization of lipid reserves.  © 2020 The Authors.

BACKGROUND: Brain tumors are the most common solid tumors of childhood, but  little is understood about the factors that influence their development.  Pediatric low-grade gliomas in particular display unique temporal and spatial  localization associated with different genetic mutations (eg, BRAF genomic  alterations, mutations in the neurofibromatosis type 1 [NF1] gene) for reasons  that remain unclear. NF1 low-grade gliomas typically arise in the optic pathway  of young children as optic pathway gliomas (OPGs), likely from a cell of origin  that resides within the third ventricular zone (TVZ). However, the factors that  contribute to their distinct temporal patterning and penetrance have not been  adequately explored. METHODS: TVZ neuroglial progenitor cells (NPCs) were analyzed over the course of  mouse brain development. Progenitors isolated by fluorescence-activated cell  sorting (FACS) were assessed for functional and molecular differences. The  impact of different germline Nf1 mutations on TVZ NPC properties was analyzed  using genetically engineered mice. RESULTS: We identify 3 individual factors that could each contribute to Nf1  optic glioma temporal patterning and penetrance. First, there are 3 functionally  and molecularly distinct populations of mouse TVZ NPCs, one of which (""M"" cells)  exhibits the highest clonogenic incidence, proliferation, and abundance during  embryogenesis. Second, TVZ NPC proliferation dramatically decreases after birth.  Third, germline Nf1 mutations differentially increase TVZ NPC proliferation  during embryogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: The unique temporal patterning and penetrance of Nf1 optic glioma  reflects the combined effects of TVZ NPC population composition, time-dependent  changes in progenitor proliferation, and the differential impact of the germline  Nf1 mutation on TVZ NPC expansion.  © The Author(s) 2020.

We assessed the accuracy of semi-automated tumor volume maps of plexiform  neurofibroma (PN) generated by a deep neural network, compared to manual  segmentation using diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data. NF1 Patients were  recruited from a phase II clinical trial for the treatment of PN. Multiple  b-value DWI was imaged over the largest PN. All DWI datasets were registered and  intensity normalized prior to segmentation with a multi-spectral neural network  classifier (MSNN). Manual volumes of PN were performed on 3D-T2 images  registered to diffusion images and compared to MSNN volumes with the  Sørensen-Dice coefficient. Intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) parameters were  calculated from resulting volumes. 35 MRI scans were included from 14 subjects.  Sørensen-Dice coefficient between the semi-automated and manual segmentation was  0.77 ± 0.016. Perfusion fraction (f) was significantly higher for tumor versus  normal tissue (0.47 ± 0.42 vs. 0.30 ± 0.22, p = 0.02), similarly, true diffusion  (D) was significantly higher for PN tumor versus normal (0.0018 ± 0.0003 vs.  0.0012 ± 0.0002, p < 0.0001). By contrast, the pseudodiffusion coefficient (D*)  was significantly lower for PN tumor versus normal (0.024 ± 0.01 vs.  0.031 ± 0.005, p < 0.0001). Volumes generated by a neural network from multiple  diffusion data on PNs demonstrated good correlation with manual volumes. IVIM  analysis of multiple b-value diffusion data demonstrates significant differences  between PN and normal tissue.

BACKGROUND: To develop and validate a patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure of  quality of life (QoL), specific to patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 1  (NF1)-associated plexiform neurofibromas (pNFs), suitable for use in clinical  efficacy trials. The study was conducted in parallel in the UK and US. METHODS: Qualitative interviews were conducted with patients to generate  questionnaire content. Face and content validity of the draft scale was assessed  by cognitive debriefing interviews (CDIs). A postal validation survey was  conducted to identify the final version of the questionnaire (the PlexiQoL),  establish its unidimensionality, and assess its psychometric properties. RESULTS: Thematic analysis was performed on 42 interview transcripts. Thirty-one  CDIs revealed that patients found the draft scale to be comprehensible,  relevant, and easy to complete. The postal validation survey was completed by  273 patients. Rasch analysis identified an 18-item unidimensional scale that  showed excellent internal consistency, reproducibility, and sensitivity to  differences in patient-perceived pNF severity, general health, and the use of  pain medication. CONCLUSIONS: The PlexiQoL is the first disease-specific PRO assessing the  ability of adults with NF-1 associated pNFs to meet their basic human needs.  Clinical trials are planned to assess the sensitivity to change of the PlexiQoL  in people undergoing treatment for pNFs.  © 2020 The Authors.

Plexiform neurofibromas (pNFs) are benign tumors of the peripheral nervous  system (PNS) that can progress towards a deadly soft tissue sarcoma termed  malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). pNFs appear during development  in the context of the genetic disease Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) due to the  complete loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene in a cell of the neural crest  (NC) - Schwann cell (SC) axis of differentiation. NF1(-/-) cells from pNFs can  be reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that exhibit an  increased proliferation rate and maintain full iPSC properties. Efficient  protocols for iPSC differentiation towards NC and SC exist and thus NC cells can  be efficiently obtained from NF1(-/-) iPSCs and further differentiated towards  SCs. In this review, we will focus on the iPSC modeling of pNFs, including the  reprogramming of primary pNF-derived cells, the properties of pNF-derived iPSCs,  the capacity to differentiate towards the NC-SC lineage, and how well  iPSC-derived NF1(-/-) SC spheroids recapitulate pNF-derived primary SCs. The  potential uses of NF1(-/-) iPSCs in pNF modeling and a future outlook are  discussed.  Copyright © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

INTRODUCTION: Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a rare, progressive and  incurable genetic disorder associated with progressive hearing loss and eventual  deafness. As a group, patients with NF report high levels of stress and  depressive symptoms. However, no studies have explored improvement in these  symptoms after psychosocial interventions. We have previously shown that a  mind-body program tailored to adults with NF2 who are deaf (the Relaxation  Response and Resiliency Program for Deaf NF2, d3RP-NF2) improves quality of life  and resiliency over and above a Health Enhancement program when both are  delivered via live-video and assisted by Communication Access Realtime  Translation (CART). Here we tested the effects of the programs on depression and  perceived stress. METHODS: Forty-five patients with NF2 and significant hearing loss were  randomized to the d3RP-NF2 or Health-Enhancement program and completed measures  of depression (PHQ-9) and perceived stress (PSS-10) at baseline,  post-intervention, and six-month follow-up. RESULTS: Patients randomized to the d3RP-NF2 program, but not to the control  condition, experienced significant decreases on both measures from baseline to  post-test, which were maintained at follow-up (within group tests). However,  improvements following the d3RP-NF2 program was not significantly higher than  those observed in the control group (between group tests). CONCLUSION: Results provide the first evidence of improvement in symptoms of  depression and perceived stress among deaf patients living with NF2 who  participate in a virtual mind-body program.

Meningiomas (MNs), arising from the arachnoid/meningeal layer, are nonresponsive  to chemotherapies, with ∼50% showing loss of the Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) tumor  suppressor gene. Previously, we established NF2 loss activates mechanistic  target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and mechanistic target of rapamycin  complex 2 (mTORC2) signaling, leading to clinical trials for NF2 and MN.  Recently our omics studies identified activated ephrin (EPH) receptor and Src  family kinases upon NF2 loss. Here, we report increased expression of several  ligands in NF2-null human arachnoidal cells (ACs) and the MN cell line  Ben-Men-1, particularly neuregulin-1/heregulin (NRG1), and confirm increased  NRG1 secretion and activation of V-ERB-B avian erythroblastic leukemia viral  oncogene homolog 3 (ERBB3) receptor kinase. Conditioned-medium from NF2-null ACs  or exogenous NRG1 stimulated ERBB3, EPHA2, and mTORC1/2 signaling, suggesting  pathway crosstalk. NF2-null cells treated with an ERBB3-neutralizing antibody  partially downregulated mTOR pathway activation but showed no effect on  viability. mTORC1/2 inhibitor treatment decreased NRG1 expression and  downregulated ERBB3 while re-activating pAkt T308, suggesting a mechanism  independent of NRG1-ERBB3 but likely involving activation of another upstream  receptor kinase. Transcriptomics after mTORC1/2 inhibition confirmed decreased  ERBB3/ERBB4 while revealing increased expression of insulin-like growth factor  receptor 1 (IGF1R). Drug treatment co-targeting mTORC1/2 and IGF1R/insulin  receptor attenuated pAkt T308 and showed synergistic effects on viability. Our  findings indicate potential autocrine signaling where NF2 loss leads to  secretion/activation of NRG1-ERBB3 signaling. mTORC1/2 inhibition downregulates  NRG1-ERBB3, while upregulating pAkt T308 through an adaptive response involving  IGF1R/insulin receptor and co-targeting these pathways may prove effective for  treatment of NF2-deficient MN.

The molecular pathogenesis of glioblastoma indicates that RTK/Ras/PI3K, RB and  TP53 pathways are critical for human gliomagenesis. Here, several transgenic  zebrafish lines with single or multiple deletions of nf1, tp53 and rb1 in  astrocytes, were established to genetically induce gliomagenesis in zebrafish.  In the mutant with a single deletion, we found only the nf1 mutation  low-efficiently induced tumour incidence, suggesting that the Nf1 pathway is  critical for the initiation of gliomagenesis in zebrafish. Combination of  mutations, nf1;tp53 and rb1;tp53 combined knockout fish, showed much higher  tumour incidences, high-grade histology, increased invasiveness, and shortened  survival time. Further bioinformatics analyses demonstrated the alterations in  RTK/Ras/PI3K, cell cycle, and focal adhesion pathways, induced by abrogated nf1,  tp53, or rb1, were probably the critical stepwise biological events for the  initiation and development of gliomagenesis in zebrafish. Gene expression  profiling and histological analyses showed the tumours derived from zebrafish  have significant similarities to the subgroups of human gliomas. Furthermore,  temozolomide treatment effectively suppressed gliomagenesis in these glioma  zebrafish models, and the histological responses in temozolomide-treated  zebrafish were similar to those observed in clinically treated glioma patients.  Thus, our findings will offer a potential tool for genetically investigating  gliomagenesis and screening potential targeted anti-tumour compounds for glioma  treatment.  © The Author(s) (2020).

The optic pathway glioma (OPG) is a slow-growing brain tumor that arises along  the optic nerve or its downstream connections and causing vision to gradually  worsen with time. This tumor forms in children with a genetic condition called  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), causing tumors to grow on nerves. In normal  conditions, glial cells are there to support and protect nerve cells but, in  NF1-OPG, glial cells have a genetic defect and grow out of control forming a  tumor called a glioma. There are no rat models of NF1-OPG that can be used to  explore various treatment options, and mouse models make interventional studies  difficult due to their small eye size. We have created a model in which to study  the progression of tumor growth in the optic nerve and establish the anatomical  and functional consequences of the model and determine its suitability to serve  as a surrogate for human disease. C6 rat glioma cells were injected into the  optic nerve of Long-Evans rats and allowed to proliferate for 2 weeks. The eye  clearly showed proptosis and lens opacity was observed, likely due to increased  intraocular pressure caused by growing tumors. Hematoxylin-eosin staining showed  marked cellularity, with hyperchromatism and pleomorphism. There was prominent  area of necrosis with neoplastic cells palisading around the penumbra.  Immunostaining with markers such as S100, β-tubulin III, Foxp3, CD45, Vimentin,  and Ki67 confirmed low-grade tumor formation, with a mild immune response.

Neurofibromatosis Type I (NF1) is a neurocutaneous genetic syndrome  characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, including benign  peripheral nerve sheath tumor called neurofibroma. These tumors originate from  the Schwann cell lineage but other cell types as well as extracellular matrix  (ECM) in the neurofibroma microenvironment constitute the majority of the tumor  mass. In fact, collagen accounts for up to 50% of the neurofibroma's dry weight.  Although the presence of collagens in neurofibroma is indisputable, the exact  repertoire of ECM genes and ECM-associated genes (i.e. the matrisome) and their  functions are unknown. Here, transcriptome profiling by single-cell RNA  sequencing reveals the matrisome of human cutaneous neurofibroma (cNF). We  discovered that classic pro-fibrogenic collagen I myofibroblasts are rare in  neurofibroma. In contrast, collagen VI, a pro-tumorigenic ECM, is abundant and  mainly secreted by neurofibroma fibroblasts. This study also identified  potential cell type-specific markers to further elucidate the biology of the cNF  microenvironment.

Matt.Steensma@vai.org.  Benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors are the clinical hallmark of  Neurofibromatosis Type 1. They account for substantial morbidity and mortality  in NF1. Cutaneous (CNF) and plexiform neurofibromas (PNF) share nearly identical  histology, but maintain different growth rates and risk of malignant conversion.  The reasons for this disparate clinical behavior are not well explained by  recent genome or transcriptome profiling studies. We hypothesized that CNFs and  PNFs are epigenetically distinct tumor types that exhibit differential signaling  due to genome-wide and site-specific methylation events. We interrogated the  methylation profiles of 45 CNFs and 17 PNFs from NF1 subjects with the Illumina  EPIC 850K methylation array. Based on these profiles, we confirm that CNFs and  PNFs are epigenetically distinct tumors with broad differences in higher-order  chromatin states and specific methylation events altering genes involved in key  biological and cellular processes, such as inflammation, RAS/MAPK signaling,  actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, and oxytocin signaling. Based on our  identification of two separate DMRs associated with alternative leading exons in  MAP2K3, we demonstrate differential RAS/MKK3/p38 signaling between CNFs and  PNFs. Epigenetic reinforcement of RAS/MKK/p38 was a defining characteristic of  CNFs leading to pro-inflammatory signaling and chromatin conformational changes,  whereas PNFs signaled predominantly through RAS/MEK. Tumor size also correlated  with specific CpG methylation events. Taken together, these findings confirm  that NF1 deficiency influences the epigenetic regulation of RAS signaling fates,  accounting for observed differences in CNF and PNF clinical behavior. The  extension of these findings is that CNFs may respond differently than PNFs to  RAS-targeted therapeutics raising the possibility of targeting p38-mediated  inflammation for CNF treatment.

(#)Contributed equally  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) are progressive,  multicellular neoplasms that cause morbidity and may transform to sarcoma.  Treatment of Nf1fl/fl;Postn-Cre mice with cabozantinib, an inhibitor of multiple  tyrosine kinases, caused a reduction in PN size and number and differential  modulation of kinases in cell lineages that drive PN growth. Based on these  findings, the Neurofibromatosis Clinical Trials Consortium conducted a phase II,  open-label, nonrandomized Simon two-stage study to assess the safety, efficacy  and biologic activity of cabozantinib in patients ≥16 years of age with NF1 and  progressive or symptomatic, inoperable PN ( NCT02101736 ). The trial met its  primary outcome, defined as ≥25% of patients achieving a partial response (PR,  defined as ≥20% reduction in target lesion volume as assessed by magnetic  resonance imaging (MRI)) after 12 cycles of therapy. Secondary outcomes included  adverse events (AEs), patient-reported outcomes (PROs) assessing pain and  quality of life (QOL), pharmacokinetics (PK) and the levels of circulating  endothelial cells and cytokines. Eight of 19 evaluable (42%) trial participants  achieved a PR. The median change in tumor volume was 15.2% (range, +2.2% to  -36.9%), and no patients had disease progression while on treatment. Nine  patients required dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy due to AEs;  common AEs included gastrointestinal toxicity, hypothyroidism, fatigue and  palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia. A total of 11 grade 3 AEs occurred in eight  patients. Patients with PR had a significant reduction in tumor pain intensity  and pain interference in daily life but no change in global QOL scores. These  data indicate that cabozantinib is active in NF1-associated PN, resulting in  tumor volume reduction and pain improvement.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant syndrome whose  characteristic manifestations include benign neurofibromas, yet NF1 is also  associated with a high risk of cancer. Measurements of circulating free plasma  DNA (cfDNA) are gaining wider applicability in cancer diagnostics, targeting of  therapy, and monitoring of therapeutic response. Individuals with NF1 are likely  to be followed up using this method, but the effects of NF1 and neurofibromas on  cfDNA levels are not known. We studied peripheral blood samples from 19 adults  with NF1 and 12 healthy controls. The cfDNA was isolated from plasma with QIAamp  Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit and quantified using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer. The  cfDNA concentration of each sample was normalized relative to the plasma protein  concentration. The normalized median concentration of cfDNA in plasma was 19.3  ng/ml (range 6.6-78.6) among individuals with NF1 and 15.9 ng/ml (range  4.8-47.0) among controls (p = .369). Individuals with NF1 who also had plexiform  neurofibroma (pNF) showed non-significantly elevated cfDNA concentration  compared to individuals with NF1 and without known pNF (median 25.4 vs.  18.8 ng/ml, p = .122). The effect of NF1 on cfDNA seems to be relatively small  and NF1 is therefore unlikely to hamper the use of cfDNA-based assays.  © 2021 The Authors.

IMPORTANCE: Understanding RAS dependency and mechanisms of RAS activation in  non-V600 BRAF variant cancers has important clinical implications. This is the  first study to date to systematically assess RAS dependency of BRAF alterations  with real-world cancer genomic databases. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate RAS dependency of individual BRAF alterations through  alteration coexistence analysis using cancer genomic databases. DESIGN AND SETTING: A cross-sectional data analysis of 119 538 nonredundant  cancer samples using cancer genomics databases including GENIE (Genomics  Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange) and databases in cBioPortal including  TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) (accessed March 24, 2020), in addition to 2745  cancer samples from Mayo Clinic Genomics Laboratory (January 1, 2015, to July 1,  2020). Frequencies and odds ratios of coexisting alterations of RAS (KRAS, NRAS  and HRAS) and RAS regulatory genes (NF1, PTPN11 and CBL) were calculated for  individual BRAF alterations, and compared according to the current BRAF  alteration classification; cancer type specificity of coexisting alterations of  RAS or RAS regulatory genes was also evaluated. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome measurement is enrichment of RAS  (KRAS, NRAS and HRAS) alterations in BRAF variant cancers. Secondary outcome  measurement is enrichment of RAS regulatory gene (NF1, PTPN11, and CBL) in BRAF  variant cancers. RESULTS: A total of 2745 cancer samples from 2708 patients (female/male ratio:  1.0) tested by Mayo Clinic Genomics Laboratory and 119 538 patients (female/male  ratio: 1.1) from GENIE and cBioPortal database were included in the study. In  119 538 nonredundant cancer samples, class 1 BRAF alterations and BRAF fusions  were found to be mutually exclusive to alterations of RAS or RAS regulatory  genes (odds ratio range 0.03-0.13 and 0.03-0.73 respectively), confirming their  RAS independency. Both class 2 and class 3 BRAF alterations show variable and  overlapping levels of enriched RAS alterations (odds ratio range: 0.03-5.9 and  0.63-2.52 respectively), suggesting heterogeneity in RAS dependency and a need  to revisit BRAF alteration classification. For RAS-dependent BRAF alterations,  the coexisting alterations also involve RAS regulatory genes by enrichment  analysis (for example, S467L shows an odds ratio of 8.26 for NF1, 9.87 for  PTPN11, and 15.23 for CBL) and occur in a variety of cancer types with some  coalterations showing cancer type specificity (for example, HRAS variations  account for 46.7% of all coexisting RAS alterations in BRAF variant bladder  cancers, but 0% in non-small cell lung cancers). Variant-level assessment shows  that BRAF alterations involving the same codon may differ in RAS dependency. In  addition, RAS dependency of previously unclassified BRAF alterations could be  assessed. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Current BRAF alteration classification based on in  vitro assays does not accurately predict RAS dependency in vivo for non-V600  BRAF alterations. RAS-dependent BRAF variant cancers with different mechanisms  of RAS activation suggest the need for different treatment strategies.

PURPOSE: Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) frequently develop  plexiform neurofibromas (PNs), which can cause significant morbidity. We  performed a phase II trial of the MAPK/ERK kinase inhibitor, mirdametinib  (PD-0325901), in patients with NF1 and inoperable PNs. The primary objective was  response rate based on volumetric magnetic resonance imaging analysis. METHODS: Inclusion criteria included age ≥ 16 years and a PN that was either  progressive or causing significant morbidity. First-dose pharmacokinetics were  performed. Patients completed patient-reported outcome measures. Patients  received mirdametinib by mouth twice a day at 2 mg/m2/dose (maximum dose = 4 mg  twice a day) in a 3-week on/1-week off sequence. Each course was 4 weeks in  duration. Evaluations were performed after four courses for the first year and  then after every six courses. Patients could receive a maximum of 24 total  courses. RESULTS: Nineteen patients were enrolled, and all 19 received mirdametinib. The  median age was 24 years (range, 16-39 years); the median baseline tumor volume  was 363.8 mL (range, 3.9-5,161 mL). Eight of the 19 patients (42%) achieved a  partial response of the target PN by course 12, and 10 (53%) had stable disease.  One patient (5%) developed progressive disease at course 8. Significant and  durable decreases were observed in pain ratings. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this analysis represents the first  characterization of the activity and pharmacokinetics of mirdametinib in  patients with NF1 and PNs and is the first published response study for MAPK/ERK  kinase inhibitors in adults with NF1 and PNs. Mirdametinib given at 2 mg/m2/dose  (maximum dose, 4 mg) twice daily in a 3-week on/1-week off sequence resulted in  a 42% partial response rate with preliminary evidence of reduction in pain.

Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a genetic condition affecting approximately  1:3500 persons worldwide. The NF1 gene codes for neurofibromin protein, a GTPase  activating protein (GAP) and a negative regulator of RAS. The NF1 gene undergoes  alternative splicing of exon 23a (E23a) that codes for 21 amino acids placed at  the center of the GAP related domain (GRD). E23a-containing type II  neurofibromin exhibits a weaker Ras-GAP activity compared to E23a-less type I  isoform. Exon E23a has been related with the cognitive impairment present in NF1  individuals. We designed antisense Phosphorodiamidate Morpholino Oligomers  (PMOs) to modulate E23a alternative splicing at physiological conditions of gene  expression and tested their impact during PC12 cell line neuronal  differentiation. Results show that any dynamic modification of the natural ratio  between type I and type II isoforms disturbed neuronal differentiation, altering  the proper formation of neurites and deregulating both the MAPK/ERK and cAMP/PKA  signaling pathways. Our results suggest an opposite regulation of these pathways  by neurofibromin and the possible existence of a feedback loop sensing  neurofibromin-related signaling. The present work illustrates the utility of  PMOs to study alternative splicing that could be applied to other alternatively  spliced genes in vitro and in vivo.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of a brief, transdiagnostic, peer-delivered  intervention for patients with rare diseases in addition to care as usual (CAU)  compared with CAU only. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this 2-group randomized clinical trial  conducted from October 5, 2017, to July 12, 2019, patients were recruited via  specialized clinics and patient organizations across Germany and participated  from home. The study included consecutive adult patients with neurofibromatosis  type 1, Marfan syndrome, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and pulmonary arterial  hypertension who have limited functionality because of the disease. Exclusion  criteria were a life-threatening health status and ongoing psychotherapeutic  treatment. Of 143 patients screened for eligibility with a semistructured  telephone interview, 54 were excluded, and 89 were randomized: 45 patients were  randomly allocated to the peer-delivered intervention group, and 44 to the  control group; 87 patients (98%) completed the 6-month follow-up assessment. The  analysis was performed using an intention-to-treat principle. Data cleansing and  analysis were conducted between April 25, 2019, and February 13, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: The 6-week intervention consisted of a self-help book and  telephone-based peer counseling in addition to CAU. The control group received  CAU alone. Peer counselors received training, structured consultation  guidelines, and supervision. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was acceptance of the disease as  assessed using the Illness Cognition Questionnaire (ICQ; mean sum scores range  from 0 to 18, with higher values representing more acceptance) 6 months after  the intervention. Secondary outcomes included self-reported coping strategies  (Health Education Impact Questionnaire), illness cognition (ICQ and Illness  Perception Questionnaire), depression severity (Patient Health Questionnaire  9-item depression scale), anxiety severity (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale),  quality of life (12-Item Short-Form Health Survey), and social support (Social  Support Questionnaire). Outcomes were assessed before the intervention, after  the intervention, and at a 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of the 89 participating patients was 46.3 (14.9)  years; 59 (66%) were women. There were no group differences regarding baseline  variables. All patients allocated to the intervention group completed the  intervention. Six months after the intervention, but not directly after  completing the program, the intervention group had significantly higher rates of  acceptance (ICQ) of the disease (primary outcome) compared with the CAU group.  Mean (SD) baseline ICQ scores were 9.61 (3.79) in the control group and 9.86  (3.40) in the intervention group. Mean (SE) ICQ scores at 6 months were 10.32  (0.42) for the control group and 11.79 (0.42) for the intervention group, with a  significant mean difference of -1.47 (95% CI, -2.63 to -0.31; P = .01). Several  secondary outcomes, including different coping strategies, social support, and  mental quality of life, were significantly higher after the intervention  compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, a self-help and  peer counseling intervention improved patients' acceptance of their rare chronic  diseases. Self-management and peer support can efficiently address the unique  care needs of patients with rare diseases. TRIAL REGISTRATION: isrctn.org Identifier: ISRCTN13738704.

Although patients are diagnosed according to clinical  criteria and few genotype-phenotype correlations are known, molecular analysis  remains important. NF1 displays allelic heterogeneity, with a high proportion of  variants affecting splicing, including deep intronic alleles and changes outside  the canonical splice sites, making validation problematic. Next Generation  Sequencing (NGS) technologies integrated with multiplex ligation-dependent probe  amplification (MLPA) have largely overcome RNA-based techniques but do not  detect splicing defects. A rapid minigene-based system was set up to test the  effects of NF1 variants on splicing. We investigated 29 intronic and exonic NF1  variants identified in patients during the diagnostic process. The minigene  assay showed the coexistence of multiple mechanisms of splicing alterations for  seven variants. A leaky effect on splicing was documented in one de novo  substitution detected in a sporadic patient with a specific phenotype without  neurofibromas. Our splicing assay proved to be a reliable and fast method to  validate novel NF1 variants potentially affecting splicing and to detect  hypomorphic effects that might have phenotypic consequences, avoiding the  requirement of patient's RNA.

Neurofibromatosis (NF) is an autosomal genetic disorder for which early and  definite clinical diagnoses are difficult. To identify the diagnosis, five  affected probands with suspected NF from unrelated families were included in  this study. Molecular analysis was performed using multigene panel testing and  Sanger sequencing. Ultradeep sequencing was used to analyze the mutation rate in  the tissues from the proband with mosaic mutations. Three different pathogenic  variants of the NF1 gene were found in three probands who mainly complained of  café-au-lait macules (CALMs), including one frameshift variant  c.5072_5073insTATAACTGTAACTCCTGGGTCAGGGAGTACACCAA:p.Tyr1692Ilefs in exon 37, one  missense variant c.3826C > T:p.Arg1276Ter in exon 28, and one splicing variant  c.4110 + 1G > T at the first base downstream of the 3'-end of exon 30. One NF1  gene mosaic variant was found in a proband who complained of cutaneous  neurofibroma with the frameshift variant c.495_498del:p.Thr165fs in exon 5, and  ultradeep sequencing showed the highest mutation rate of 10.81% in cutaneous  neurofibromas. A frameshift variant, c.36_39del:p.Ser12fs in exon 1 of the NF2  gene, was found in a proband who presented with skin plaques and intracranial  neurogenic tumors. All of these pathogenic variants were heterozygous, one was  not reported, and one not in Chinese before. This study expands the pathogenic  variant spectrum of NF and demonstrates the clinical diagnosis.  Copyright © 2021 Zhang, Wu, Cai, Fang and Xiao.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic  disorder with a prevalence of 1:3000 births and a wide variety of clinical  manifestations. Cutaneous neurofibromas (cNF) are among the most common visible  manifestations of NF1 and present a major clinical burden for patients. NF1  patients with cNF often report decreased quality of life, emotional well-being  and physical comfort. Developing effective medical therapies for cNF has been  identified as a priority for the majority of adults with NF1. METHODS: The study was an open, controlled and prospective proof-of-concept  clinical trial. The topical treatment consisted of two steps: cNF microporation  using a laser device followed by topical application of one drop of diclofenac  25 mg/mL on the surface of the cNF (T neurofibroma = treatment) or physiological  saline (C neurofibroma = control) and reapplied twice daily for 3 days.  Neurofibroma assessments included visual and dermatoscopy observations noting  color and presence of necrosis, presence of flaccidity, measurements in two  dimensions, photographs, and histopathology after excision. The primary efficacy  variable was the presence of tissue necrosis. The primary safety variable was  the occurrence of treatment-related adverse events. RESULTS: Six patients were included in the study. The treatment resulted in  transitory topical changes (healing of the microporation grid with formation of  scintillating tissue layer, hyperemia and desquamation), with no statistically  significant variation in the dimensions of the T and C neurofibromas in relation  to pretreatment measurements. There was no necrosis in the T or C neurofibromas.  In the histopathological analysis, there was no significant difference in the  distribution of chronic (lymphocytic) inflammatory infiltrate in the papillary  reticular dermis (subepithelial), type of infiltrate (diffuse, perivascular, or  both), presence of fibrosis, and presence of atrophy among the T and C  neurofibromas. No adverse events attributable to the use of diclofenac were  reported during the treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment did not result in significant alterations in terms of  presence of tissue necrosis, size, or histopathological features in the T  neurofibromas or in comparison to the C neurofibromas. Topical diclofenac with  laser microporation was well-tolerated, with no adverse events attributable to  diclofenac reported. Whether these observations are due to minimal systemic and  neurofibroma exposure remain to be explored in dosage studies with larger  patient groups.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common hereditary  neurocutaneous disorders. In addition to skin pigmentation and cutaneous  neurofibroma, some patients developed the plexiform neurofibroma since birth.  Plexiform neurofibroma has abundant Schwann cells, fibroblasts, mast cells,  blood vessels, and connective tissues, which increases the risk of developing a  malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). MPNST is a highly invasive  cancer with no effective therapeutic agent. Cordycepin or 3'-deoxyadenosine is  an extract from cordyceps militaris, which has been reported as an  anti-inflammation and anti-tumor agent. Herein, we evaluated cordycepin's  anti-proliferative effect on MPNST cell lines both in vitro and in vivo.  Cordycepin inhibited the MPNST cell growth with an arrest of cell cycle at G2/M  and S phases. The administration of naringin and pentostatin, inhibitors for  adenosine deaminase (ADA), enzyme responsible for cordycepin degradation, did  not show a synergistic effect in MPNST cells treated with cordycepin. However,  the combined treatment enhanced the decrease of tumors in xenograft mouse model.  Immunoblotting showed a decreased level of p53 protein in all MPNST cell lines,  but S462TY cells. After cordycepin treatment, the levels of ERK, survivin, pAKT,  and Sp1 proteins also decreased. The level of tubulin, but not actin or GAPDH,  decreased in a dose-dependent manner. The microtubule network which is composed  of tubulins was markedly decomposed in those treated MPNST cells. To elucidate  the epigenetic control of transcription, ChIP-qPCR assay of the Sp1 and tubulin  promoter regions revealed decreased Sp1 binding. The incorporation of  3'-doexyadenosine is detrimental for the process of poly(A) tail elongation. The  poly(A) tail length assay showed the tail length in Sp1 and tubulin transcripts  decreased in the treated cells. Nevertheless, the administration of SP1 protein  to the treated cells could not rescue them completely. Furthermore, the  p53-knocked-down cells (S462TY) where the expression of both p53 and Sp1 was  suppressed, were vulnerable to cordycepin. The p53 protein could ameliorate the  effect. In summary, cordycepin is effective to inhibit the growth of MPNST,  probably through the pathway of p53/Sp1/tubulin.  AJCR Copyright © 2021.

The aim of this study was to investigate P300  event-related potential (ERP) associated with WM in NF1. Sixteen adolescents  with NF1 were compared with controls on measures of WM and EEG was recorded  during a WM nback task. The NF1 group showed poorer performance on measures of  WM as compared to the control group. No group differences were observed in P300  amplitude at Pz, but P300 latency was shorter in the NF1 group. Topographic  analyses of P300 amplitude showed group differences indicating neural processing  differences in the NF1 group relative to controls, which possibly contribute to  the cognitive deficits seen in this population.  © 2021.

Cognitive dysfunction is among the hallmark symptoms of Neurofibromatosis 1, and  accordingly, loss of the Drosophila melanogaster ortholog of Neurofibromin 1  (dNf1) precipitates associative learning deficits. However, the affected  circuitry in the adult CNS remained unclear and the compromised mechanisms  debatable. Although the main evolutionarily conserved function attributed to Nf1  is to inactivate Ras, decreased cAMP signaling on its loss has been thought to  underlie impaired learning. Using mixed sex populations, we determine that dNf1  loss results in excess GABAergic signaling to the central for associative  learning mushroom body (MB) neurons, apparently suppressing learning. dNf1 is  necessary and sufficient for learning within these non-MB neurons, as a dAlk and  Ras1-dependent, but PKA-independent modulator of GABAergic neurotransmission.  Surprisingly, we also uncovered and discuss a postsynaptic Ras1-dependent, but  dNf1-independnet signaling within the MBs that apparently responds to  presynaptic GABA levels and contributes to the learning deficit of the mutants.

Electronic address:  paradal@mskcc.org.  NF1-associated malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are the major  cause of mortality in neurofibromatosis. MPNSTs arise from benign peripheral  nerve plexiform neurofibromas that originate in the embryonic neural crest cell  lineage. Using reporter transgenes that label early neural crest lineage cells  in multiple NF1 MPNST mouse models, we discover and characterize a rare MPNST  cell population with stem-cell-like properties, including quiescence, that is  essential for tumor initiation and relapse. Following isolation of these cells,  we derive a cancer-stem-cell-specific gene expression signature that includes  consensus embryonic neural crest genes and identify Nestin as a marker for the  MPNST cell of origin. Combined targeting of cancer stem cells along with  antimitotic chemotherapy yields effective tumor inhibition and prolongs  survival. Enrichment of the cancer stem cell signature in cognate human tumors  supports the generality and relevance of cancer stem cells to MPNST therapy  development.  Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

(#)Contributed equally  Neurofibromatosis type 1 is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by  mutation in the neurofibromin 1 (NF1) gene. Its hallmarks are cutaneous findings  including neurofibromas, benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors. We analyzed the  collagen and matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) expression in Neurofibromatosis 1  cutaneous neurofibroma and found excessive expression of collagen and reduced  expression of MMP1. To identify new therapeutic drugs for neurofibroma, we  analyzed phosphorylation of components of the Ras pathway, which underlies NF1  regulation, and applied treatments to block this pathway (PD184352, U0126, and  rapamycin) and lysosomal processes (chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ),  and bafilomycin A (BafA)) in cultured Neurofibromatosis 1 fibroblasts. We found  that downregulation of the MMP1 protein was a key abnormal feature in the  neurofibromatosis 1 fibroblasts and that the decreased MMP1 was restored by the  lysosomal blockers CQ and HCQ, but not by the blockers of the Ras pathway.  Moreover, the MMP1-upregulating activity of those lysosomal blockers was  dependent on aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) activation and ERK phosphorylation.  Our findings suggest that lysosomal blockers are potential candidates for the  treatment of Neurofibromatosis 1 neurofibroma.

Neurons have recently emerged as essential cellular constituents of the tumour  microenvironment, and their activity has been shown to increase the growth of a  diverse number of solid tumours1. Although the role of neurons in tumour  progression has previously been demonstrated2, the importance of neuronal  activity to tumour initiation is less clear-particularly in the setting of  cancer predisposition syndromes. Fifteen per cent of individuals with  the neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) cancer predisposition syndrome (in which tumours  arise in close association with nerves) develop low-grade neoplasms of the optic  pathway (known as optic pathway gliomas (OPGs)) during early childhood3,4,  raising  the possibility that postnatal light-induced activity of the optic  nerve drives tumour initiation. Here we use an authenticated mouse model of OPG  driven by mutations in the neurofibromatosis 1 tumour suppressor gene (Nf1)5 to  demonstrate that stimulation of optic nerve activity increases optic glioma  growth, and that decreasing visual experience via light deprivation prevents  tumour formation and maintenance. We show that the initiation of Nf1-driven OPGs  (Nf1-OPGs) depends on visual experience during a developmental period in which  Nf1-mutant mice are susceptible to tumorigenesis. Germline Nf1 mutation in  retinal neurons results in aberrantly increased shedding of neuroligin 3 (NLGN3)  within the optic nerve in response to retinal neuronal activity. Moreover,  genetic Nlgn3 loss or pharmacological inhibition of NLGN3 shedding blocks the  formation and progression of Nf1-OPGs. Collectively, our studies establish an  obligate role for neuronal activity in the development of some types of brain  tumours, elucidate a therapeutic strategy to reduce OPG incidence or mitigate  tumour progression, and underscore the role of Nf1mutation-mediated  dysregulation of neuronal signalling pathways in mouse models of the NF1 cancer  predisposition syndrome.

BACKGROUND: Emerging insights from numerous laboratories have revealed important  roles for nonneoplastic cells in the development and progression of brain  tumors. One of these nonneoplastic cellular constituents, glioma-associated  microglia (GAM), represents a unique population of brain monocytes within the  tumor microenvironment that have been reported to both promote and inhibit  glioma proliferation. To elucidate the role of GAM in the setting of low-grade  glioma (LGG), we leveraged RNA sequencing meta-analysis, genetically engineered  mouse strains, and human biospecimens. METHODS: Publicly available disease-associated microglia (DAM) RNA-seq datasets  were used, followed by immunohistochemistry and RNAScope validation.  CD11a-deficient mouse microglia were used for in vitro functional studies, while  LGG growth in mice was assessed using anti-CD11a neutralizing antibody treatment  of Neurofibromatosis type 1 (Nf1) optic glioma mice in vivo. RESULTS: We identified Itgal/CD11a enrichment in GAM relative to other DAM  populations, which was confirmed in several independently generated murine  models of Nf1 optic glioma. Moreover, ITGAL/CD11A expression was similarly  increased in human LGG (pilocytic astrocytoma) specimens from several different  datasets, specifically in microglia from these tumors. Using CD11a-knockout  mice, CD11a expression was shown to be critical for murine microglia CX3CL1  receptor (Cx3cr1) expression and CX3CL1-directed motility, as well as glioma  mitogen (Ccl5) production. Consistent with an instructive role for CD11a+  microglia in stromal control of LGG growth, antibody-mediated CD11a inhibition  reduced mouse Nf1 LGG growth in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these findings establish ITGAL/CD11A as a critical  microglia regulator of LGG biology relevant to future stroma-targeted brain  tumor treatment strategies.  © The Author(s) 2021.

(#)Contributed equally  BACKGROUND: Sensory modulation difficulties are common in children with  conditions such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and could contribute to other  social and non-social symptoms. Positing a causal role for sensory processing  differences requires observing atypical sensory reactivity prior to the  emergence of other symptoms, which can be achieved through prospective studies. METHODS: In this longitudinal study, we examined auditory repetition suppression  and change detection at 5 and 10 months in infants with and without  Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1), a condition associated with higher likelihood of  developing ASD. RESULTS: In typically developing infants, suppression to vowel repetition and  enhanced responses to vowel/pitch change decreased with age over posterior  regions, becoming more frontally specific; age-related change was diminished in  the NF1 group. Whilst both groups detected changes in vowel and pitch, the NF1  group were largely slower to show a differentiated neural response. Auditory  responses did not relate to later language, but were related to later ASD  traits. CONCLUSIONS: These findings represent the first demonstration of atypical brain  responses to sounds in infants with NF1 and suggest they may relate to the  likelihood of later ASD.

Neurofibromatosis Type II (NF2) is an autosomal dominant cancer predisposition  syndrome in which germline haploinsufficiency at the NF2 gene confers a greatly  increased propensity for tumor development arising from tissues of neural crest  derived origin. NF2 encodes the tumor suppressor, Merlin, and its biochemical  function is incompletely understood. One well-established function of Merlin is  as a negative regulator of group A serine/threonine p21-activated kinases  (PAKs). In these studies we explore the role of PAK1 and its closely related  paralog, PAK2, both pharmacologically and genetically, in Merlin-deficient  Schwann cells and in a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) that develops  spontaneous vestibular and spinal schwannomas. We demonstrate that PAK1 and PAK2  are both hyper activated in Merlin-deficient murine schwannomas. In preclinical  trials, a pan Group A PAK inhibitor, FRAX-1036, transiently reduced PAK1 and  PAK2 phosphorylation in vitro, but had insignificant efficacy in vivo.  NVS-PAK1-1, a PAK1 selective inhibitor, had a greater but still minimal effect  on our GEMM phenotype. However, genetic ablation of Pak1 but not Pak2 reduced  tumor formation in our NF2 GEMM. Moreover, germline genetic deletion of Pak1 was  well tolerated, while conditional deletion of Pak2 in Schwann cells resulted in  significant morbidity and mortality. These data support the further development  of PAK1-specific small molecule inhibitors and the therapeutic targeting of PAK1  in vestibular schwannomas and argue against PAK1 and PAK2 existing as  functionally redundant protein isoforms in Schwann cells.  © The Author(s) 2021.

Reduced muscle tone, muscle weakness, and physical fatigue can impact  considerably on quality of life for children with neurofibromatosis type 1  (NF1). Human muscle biopsies and mouse models of NF1 deficiency in muscle show  intramyocellular lipid accumulation, and preclinical data have indicated that  L-carnitine supplementation can ameliorate this phenotype. The aim of this study  is to examine whether daily L-carnitine supplementation is safe and feasible,  and will improve muscle strength and reduce fatigue in children with NF1. A  12-week Phase 2a trial was conducted using 1000 mg daily oral levocarnitine  tartrate supplementation. Recruited children were between 8 and 12 years old  with a clinical diagnosis of NF1, history of muscle weakness and fatigue, and  naïve to L-carnitine. Primary outcomes were safety (self-reporting, biochemical  testing) and compliance. Secondary outcomes included plasma acylcarnitine  profiles, functional measures (muscle strength, long jump, handwriting speed,  6-minute-walk test [6MWT]), and parent-reported questionnaires (PedsQL™,  CBCL/6-18). Six children completed the trial with no self-reported adverse  events. Biochemical tests for kidney and liver function were normal, and the  average compliance was 95%. Plasma acylcarnitine levels were low, but within a  range not clinically linked to carnitine deficiency. For strength measures,  there was a mean 53% increase in dorsiflexion strength (95% confidence interval  [CI] 8.89-60.75; p = 0.02) and mean 66% increase in plantarflexion strength (95%  CI 12.99-134.1; p = 0.03). In terms of muscle performance, there was a mean 10%  increase in long jump distance (95% CI 2.97-16.03; p = 0.01) and 6MWT distance  (95% CI 5.88-75.45; p = 0.03). Comparison with the 1000 Norms Project data  showed a significant improvement in Z-score for all of these measures. Parent  reports showed no negative impact on quality of life, and the perceived benefits  led to the majority of individuals remaining on L-carnitine after the study.  Twelve weeks of L-carnitine supplementation is safe and feasible in children  with NF1, and a Phase 3 trial should confirm the efficacy of treatment.  © 2021 The Authors.

OBJECTIVE: To determine a suitable outcome measure for assessing muscle strength  in neurofibromatosis (NF) type 1 and NF2 clinical trials, we evaluated the  intraobserver reliability of handheld dynamometry (HHD) and developed consensus  recommendations for its use in NF clinical trials. METHODS: Patients ≥5 years of age with weakness in at least 1 muscle group by  manual muscle testing (MMT) were eligible. Maximal isometric muscle strength of  a weak muscle group and the biceps of the dominant arm was measured by HHD. An  average of 3 repetitions per session was used as an observation, and 3 sessions  with rest period between each were performed on the same day by a single  observer. Intrasession and intersession intraclass correlation coefficients  (ICCs) and coefficients of variation (CVs) were calculated to assess reliability  and measurement error. RESULTS: Twenty patients with NF1 and 13 with NF2 were enrolled; median age was  12 years (interquartile range [IQR] 9-17 years) and 29 years (IQR 22-38 years),  respectively. By MMT, weak muscle strength ranged from 2-/5 to 4+/5. Biceps  strength was 5/5 in all patients. Intersession ICCs for the weak muscles were  0.98 and 0.99 in the NF1 and NF2 cohorts, respectively, and for biceps were 0.97  and 0.97, respectively. The median CVs for average session strength were 5.4%  (IQR 2.6%-7.3%) and 2.9% (IQR 2.0%-6.2%) for weak muscles and biceps,  respectively. CONCLUSION: HHD performed by a trained examiner with a well-defined protocol is  a reliable technique to measure muscle strength in NF1 and NF2. Recommendations  for strength testing in NF1 and NF2 trials are provided.  © 2021 American Academy of Neurology.

OBJECTIVE: To review and recommend patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures  assessing multidimensional domains of quality of life (QoL) to use as clinical  endpoints in medical and psychosocial trials for children and adults with  neurofibromatosis (NF) type 1, NF2, and schwannomatosis. METHODS: The PRO working group of the Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis  and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) International Collaboration used systematic methods  to review, rate, and recommend existing self-report and parent-report PRO  measures of generic and disease-specific QoL for NF clinical trials.  Recommendations were based on 4 main criteria: patient characteristics, item  content, psychometric properties, and feasibility. RESULTS: The highest-rated generic measures were (1) the Pediatric Quality of  Life Inventory (PedsQL) Generic Core Scales for NF clinical trials for children  or for children through adults, (2) the Functional Assessment of Cancer  Therapy-General for adult medical trials, and (3) the World Health Organization  Quality of Life-BREF for adult psychosocial trials. The highest-rated  disease-specific measures were (1) the PedsQL NF1 Module for NF1 trials, (2) the  NF2 Impact on Quality of Life Scale for NF2 trials, and (3) the Penn Acoustic  Neuroma Quality of Life Scale for NF2 trials targeting vestibular schwannomas.  To date, there are no disease-specific tools assessing multidimensional domains  of QoL for schwannomatosis. CONCLUSIONS: The REiNS Collaboration currently recommends these generic and  disease-specific PRO measures to assess multidimensional domains of QoL for NF  clinical trials. Additional research is needed to further evaluate the use of  these measures in both medical and psychosocial trials.  © 2021 American Academy of Neurology.

OBJECTIVE: To assess imaging utilization practices across clinical specialists  in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) for the evaluation of symptomatic and  asymptomatic children and adults with or without plexiform neurofibromas (PN). METHODS: An institutional review board-exempt survey was administered to medical  practitioners caring for individuals with NF1 at the Response Evaluation in  Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) meeting in September 2019. The  survey included questions on respondent demographic data (9 questions), type of  imaging obtained for asymptomatic (4 questions) and symptomatic (4 questions)  people with and without PN, and utilization of diffusion-weighted imaging (2  questions). RESULTS: Thirty practitioners participated in the survey. Most were academic  neuro-oncologists at high-volume (>10 patients/week) NF1 centers. Of 30  respondents, 26 had access to whole-body MRI (WB-MRI). The most common approach  to an asymptomatic person without PN was no imaging (adults: 57% [17/30];  children: 50% [15/30]), followed by a screening WB-MRI (adults: 20% [6/30];  children: 26.7% [8/30]). The most common approach to a person with symptoms or  known PN was regional MRI (adults: 90% [27/30]; children: 93% [28/30]), followed  by WB-MRI (adults: 20% [6/30]; children: 36.7% [11/30]). WB-MRI was most often  obtained to evaluate a symptomatic child with PN (37% [11/30]). CONCLUSIONS: More than 90% of practitioners indicated they would obtain a  regional MRI in a symptomatic patient without known or visible PN. Otherwise,  there was little consensus on imaging practices. Given the high prevalence of PN  and risk of malignant conversion in this patient population, there is a need to  define imaging-based guidelines for optimal clinical care and the design of  future clinical trials.  © 2021 American Academy of Neurology.

OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate published patient-reported outcome  measures for the assessment of hearing function and hearing-related quality of  life (QoL) and recommend measures selected by the Response Evaluation in  Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis International Collaboration (REiNS) as  endpoints for clinical trials in neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). METHODS: The REiNS Patient-Reported Outcomes Working Group systematically  evaluated published patient-reported outcome measures of (1) hearing function  and (2) hearing-related QoL for individuals with hearing loss of various  etiologies using previously published REiNS rating procedures. Ten measures of  hearing functioning and 11 measures of hearing-related QoL were reviewed.  Measures were numerically scored and compared primarily on their participant  characteristics (including participant age range and availability of normative  data), item content, psychometric properties, and feasibility for use in  clinical trials. RESULTS: The Self-Assessment of Communication and the Self-Assessment of  Communication-Adolescent were identified as most useful for adult and pediatric  populations with NF2, respectively, for the measurement of both hearing function  and hearing-related QoL. Measures were selected for their strengths in  participant characteristics, item content, psychometric properties, and  feasibility for use in clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: REiNS recommends the Self-Assessment of Communication adult and  adolescent forms for the assessment of patient-reported hearing function and  hearing-related QoL for NF2 clinical trials. Further work is needed to  demonstrate the utility of these measures in evaluating pharmacologic or  behavioral interventions.  © 2021 American Academy of Neurology.

Yemima.berman@health.nsw.gov.au.  OBJECTIVE: In order to explore the use of Skindex scoring in patients with  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) across multiple clinical sites and inform design  of additional quality of life measures, we analyzed correlations between  Skindex, site, and clinical measures for 79 patients with NF1 from specialized  clinics in Sydney, Australia (Royal North Shore Hospital [RNS]) and Minneapolis,  Minnesota (University of Minnesota [UMN]). METHODS: The relationship between clinical factors and Skindex scores were  explored by clinic site and overall. RESULTS: A total of 40 participants were recruited from RNS and 39 from UMN.  Female sex, total number of cutaneous neurofibroma (cNF), and whether cNF were  present on the face correlated highly with Skindex and not Riccardi scores. The  UMN site had lower average scores, but these differences were almost entirely  removed after adjusting for age, sex, facial cNF, and total cNF number. CONCLUSIONS: The development of cNF in adolescence and adulthood in NF1 often  leads to progressive disfigurement and discomfort and is among one of the most  common reasons for patients to seek medical treatment. Skindex has been used to  assess skin-related quality of life in NF1 previously but is not specific to  NF1. These findings highlight the need for a low threshold for referral to  dermatologists for all patients with NF1 regardless of the severity of disease.  The finding that facial cNF and higher total number of cNF correlates with  poorer skin-related quality of life may benefit design of more specific NF1  skin-related quality of life measures.  © 2021 American Academy of Neurology.

OBJECTIVE: To review parent-report social skills measures to identify and  recommend consensus outcomes for use in clinical trials of social deficit in  children and adolescents (ages 6-18 years) with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). METHODS: Searches were conducted via PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov to identity  social skills outcome measures with English language versions used in clinical  trials in the past 5 years with populations with known social skills deficits,  including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder  (ASD). Measures were rated by the Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and  Schwannomatosis (REiNS) Neurocognitive Committee on patient characteristics, use  in published studies, domains assessed, availability of standard scores,  psychometric properties, and feasibility to determine their appropriateness for  use in NF1 clinical trials. RESULTS: Two measures were ultimately recommended by the committee: the Social  Responsiveness Scale-2 (SRS-2) and the Social Skills Improvement System-Rating  Scale (SSIS-RS). CONCLUSIONS: Each of the 2 measures assesses different aspects of social  functioning. The SSIS-RS is appropriate for studies focused on broader social  functioning; the SRS-2 is best for studies targeting problematic social  behaviors associated with ASD. Researchers will need to consider the goals of  their study when choosing a measure, and specific recommendations for their use  are provided.  © 2021 American Academy of Neurology.

OBJECTIVE: As part of an evaluation of the Response Evaluation in  Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) International Collaboration  patient representative program, we surveyed REiNS members to (1) identify  facilitators and barriers to involving patient representatives and (2)  understand whether and how involving patient representatives affected  recommendations for clinical trial outcomes. METHODS: We administered an anonymous online survey to all REiNS members.  Facilitators and barriers to patient representative involvement were solicited  using a modified free listing technique; responses were inductively grouped into  higher-order categories and ranked based on saliency score (Smith s). Open-ended  questions assessed patient representative expectations for engagement, perceived  benefits/costs of patient engagement, and patient representative contributions;  responses were analyzed using conventional content analysis. RESULTS: A total of 63/172 (37%) members responded, including 18/30 (60%)  patient representatives. Providing sufficient opportunities to meaningfully  engage in research tasks and cultivating a respectful, inclusive atmosphere were  key facilitators to patient representatives' satisfaction and ability to make an  impact. Respondents perceived that patient representatives directly (through  their input on research tasks) and indirectly (through effects on other  stakeholders' knowledge and communication style) improved the organization's  research, leading to selection of more meaningful, relevant, and feasible  clinical trial outcome measures. Ongoing challenges to patient engagement  include difficulty scheduling meetings and concerns about the level of  scientific knowledge patient representatives needed to effectively engage. CONCLUSIONS: Involving patient representatives in REiNS improved perceived  quality of neurofibromatosis clinical trial outcome measures. Negotiating  sufficient opportunities to engage, fostering an inclusive atmosphere, and  navigating time pressures are key to effective patient engagement.  © 2021 American Academy of Neurology.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a chronic multisystemic genetic disorder that  results from loss of function in the neurofibromin protein. Neurofibromin may  regulate metabolism, though the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown.  Here we show that neurofibromin regulates metabolic homeostasis in Drosophila  via a discrete neuronal circuit. Loss of neurofibromin increases metabolic rate  via a Ras GAP-related domain-dependent mechanism, increases feeding  homeostatically, and alters lipid stores and turnover kinetics. The increase in  metabolic rate is independent of locomotor activity, and maps to a sparse subset  of neurons. Stimulating these neurons increases metabolic rate, linking their  dynamic activity state to metabolism over short time scales. Our results  indicate that neurofibromin regulates metabolic rate via neuronal mechanisms,  suggest that cellular and systemic metabolic alterations may represent a  pathophysiological mechanism in neurofibromatosis type 1, and provide a platform  for investigating the cellular role of neurofibromin in metabolic homeostasis.  © 2021.

The UMi031-A-2 hiPSC line contains a CRISPR-induced homozygous,  Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) mutation (L64P (CTG > CCG)) in the NF2 gene that  encodes a merlin tumor suppressor. This line was generated from an unaffected  iPSC line using CRISPR technology and characterized for pluripotency and  karyotypic stability. The c.191 T > C variant in NF2 is associated with a  syndromic nervous system tumor disorder leading to the development of bilateral  vestibular schwannomas. Once differentiated into Schwann cells, UMi031-A-2 can  serve as a resource for the analysis of signaling pathways deregulated upon  merlin defects and provide a pre-clinical platform for testing therapies for NF2  schwannomas.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated cognitive  impairments carry significant lifelong morbidity. The lack of targeted biologic  treatments remains a significant unmet need. We examine changes in cognition in  patients with NF1 in the first 48 weeks of mitogen-activated protein kinase  inhibitor (MEKi) treatment. METHODS: Fifty-nine patients with NF1 aged 5-27 years on an MEKi clinical trial  treating plexiform neurofibroma underwent pretreatment and follow-up cognitive  assessments over 48 weeks of treatment. Performance tasks (Cogstate) and  observer-reported functioning (BRIEF) were the primary outcomes. Group-level  (paired t tests) and individual-level analyses (Reliable Change Index, RCI) were  used. RESULTS: Analysis showed statistically significant improvements on BRIEF  compared with baseline (24-week Behavioral Regulation Index: t (58) = 3.03, p =  0.004, d = 0.24; 48-week Metacognition Index: t (39) = 2.70, p = 0.01, d =  0.27). RCI indicated that more patients had clinically significant improvement  at 48 weeks than expected by chance (χ2 = 11.95, p = 0.001, odds ratio [OR] =  6.3). Group-level analyses indicated stable performance on Cogstate (p > 0.05).  RCI statistics showed high proportions of improved working memory (24-week χ2 =  8.36, p = 0.004, OR = 4.6, and 48-week χ2 = 9.34, p = 0.004, OR = 5.3) but not  visual learning/memory. Patients with baseline impairments on BRIEF were more  likely to show significant improvement than nonimpaired patients (24 weeks 46%  vs 8%; χ2 = 9.54, p = 0.008, OR = 9.22; 48 weeks 63% vs 16%; χ2 = 7.50, p =  0.02, OR = 9.0). DISCUSSION: Our data show no evidence of neurotoxicity in 48 weeks of treatment  with an MEKi and a potential clinical signal supporting future research of MEKi  as a cognitive intervention.

The mechanism of vulnerability to pediatric low-grade gliomas (pLGGs)-the most  common brain tumor in children-during development remains largely unknown. Using  mouse models of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated pLGGs in the optic  pathway (NF1-OPG), we demonstrate that NF1-OPG arose from the vulnerability to  the dependency of Mek-Erk/MAPK signaling during gliogenesis of one of the two  developmentally transient precursor populations in the optic nerve,  brain-derived migrating glial progenitors (GPs), but not local progenitors.  Hyperactive Erk/MAPK signaling by Nf1 loss overproduced GPs by disrupting the  balance between stem-cell maintenance and gliogenesis of hypothalamic  ventricular zone radial glia (RG). Persistence of RG-like GPs initiated NF1-OPG,  causing Bax-dependent apoptosis in retinal ganglion cells. Removal of three  Mek1/Mek2 alleles or transient post-natal treatment with a low-dose MEK  inhibitor normalized differentiation of Nf1-/- RG-like GPs, preventing NF1-OPG  formation and neuronal degeneration. We provide the proof-of-concept evidence  for preventing pLGGs before tumor-associated neurological damage enters an  irreversible phase.  Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

BACKGROUND: The leading cause of mortality for patients with the  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) cancer predisposition syndrome is the development  of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), an aggressive soft tissue  sarcoma. In the setting of NF1, this cancer type frequently arises from within  its common and benign precursor, plexiform neurofibroma (PN). Transformation  from PN to MPNST is challenging to diagnose due to difficulties in  distinguishing cross-sectional imaging results and intralesional heterogeneity  resulting in biopsy sampling errors. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This multi-institutional study from the National Cancer  Institute and Washington University in St. Louis used fragment size analysis and  ultra-low-pass whole genome sequencing (ULP-WGS) of plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA)  to distinguish between MPNST and PN in patients with NF1. Following in silico  enrichment for short cfDNA fragments and copy number analysis to estimate the  fraction of plasma cfDNA originating from tumor (tumor fraction), we developed a  noninvasive classifier that differentiates MPNST from PN with 86% pretreatment  accuracy (91% specificity, 75% sensitivity) and 89% accuracy on serial analysis  (91% specificity, 83% sensitivity). Healthy controls without NF1 (participants =  16, plasma samples = 16), PN (participants = 23, plasma samples = 23), and MPNST  (participants = 14, plasma samples = 46) cohorts showed significant differences  in tumor fraction in plasma (P = 0.001) as well as cfDNA fragment length (P <  0.001) with MPNST samples harboring shorter fragments and being enriched for  tumor-derived cfDNA relative to PN and healthy controls. No other covariates  were significant on multivariate logistic regression. Mutational analysis  demonstrated focal NF1 copy number loss in PN and MPNST patient plasma but not  in healthy controls. Greater genomic instability including alterations  associated with malignant transformation (focal copy number gains in chromosome  arms 1q, 7p, 8q, 9q, and 17q; focal copy number losses in SUZ12, SMARCA2,  CDKN2A/B, and chromosome arms 6p and 9p) was more prominently observed in MPNST  plasma. Furthermore, the sum of longest tumor diameters (SLD) visualized by  cross-sectional imaging correlated significantly with paired tumor fractions in  plasma from MPNST patients (r = 0.39, P = 0.024). On serial analysis, tumor  fraction levels in plasma dynamically correlated with treatment response to  therapy and minimal residual disease (MRD) detection before relapse. Study  limitations include a modest MPNST sample size despite accrual from 2 major  referral centers for this rare malignancy, and lack of uniform treatment and  imaging protocols representing a real-world cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor fraction levels derived from cfDNA fragment size and copy  number alteration analysis of plasma cfDNA using ULP-WGS significantly  correlated with MPNST tumor burden, accurately distinguished MPNST from its  benign PN precursor, and dynamically correlated with treatment response. In the  future, our findings could form the basis for improved early cancer detection  and monitoring in high-risk cancer-predisposed populations.

BACKGROUND: Non-invasive differentiation between schwannomas and neurofibromas  is important for appropriate management, preoperative counseling, and surgical  planning, but has proven difficult using conventional imaging. The objective of  this study was to develop and evaluate machine learning approaches for  differentiating peripheral schwannomas from neurofibromas. METHODS: We assembled a cohort of schwannomas and neurofibromas from 3  independent institutions and extracted high-dimensional radiomic features from  gadolinium-enhanced, T1-weighted MRI using the PyRadiomics package on  Quantitative Imaging Feature Pipeline. Age, sex, neurogenetic syndrome,  spontaneous pain, and motor deficit were recorded. We evaluated the performance  of 6 radiomics-based classifier models with and without clinical features and  compared model performance against human expert evaluators. RESULTS: One hundred and seven schwannomas and 59 neurofibromas were included.  The primary models included both clinical and imaging data. The accuracy of the  human evaluators (0.765) did not significantly exceed the no-information rate  (NIR), whereas the Support Vector Machine (0.929), Logistic Regression (0.929),  and Random Forest (0.905) classifiers exceeded the NIR. Using the method of  DeLong, the AUCs for the Logistic Regression (AUC = 0.923) and K Nearest  Neighbor (AUC = 0.923) classifiers were significantly greater than the human  evaluators (AUC = 0.766; p = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS: The radiomics-based classifiers developed here proved to be more  accurate and had a higher AUC on the ROC curve than expert human evaluators.  This demonstrates that radiomics using routine MRI sequences and clinical  features can aid in differentiation of peripheral schwannomas and neurofibromas.  © The Author(s) 2021.

Author information: (1)Department of Laboratory Medicine and Genetics, Samsung Medical Center,  Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, 81 Irwon-ro, Gangnam-gu, Seoul  06351, Korea.  Neurofibromatosis type 1, characterized by neurofibromas and café-au-lait  macules, is one of the most common genetic disorders caused by pathogenic NF1  variants. Because of the high proportion of splicing mutations in NF1,  identifying variants that alter splicing may be an essential issue for  laboratories. Here, we investigated the sensitivity and specificity of SpliceAI,  a recently introduced in silico splicing prediction algorithm in conjunction  with other in silico tools. We evaluated 285 NF1 variants identified from 653  patients. The effect on variants on splicing alteration was confirmed by  complementary DNA sequencing followed by genomic DNA sequencing. For in silico  prediction of splicing effects, we used SpliceAI, MaxEntScan (MES), and Splice  Site Finder-like (SSF). The sensitivity and specificity of SpliceAI were 94.5%  and 94.3%, respectively, with a cut-off value of Δ Score > 0.22. The area under  the curve of SpliceAI was 0.975 (p < 0.0001). Combined analysis of MES/SSF  showed a sensitivity of 83.6% and specificity of 82.5%. The concordance rate  between SpliceAI and MES/SSF was 84.2%. SpliceAI showed better performance for  the prediction of splicing alteration for NF1 variants compared with MES/SSF. As  a convenient web-based tool, SpliceAI may be helpful in clinical laboratories  conducting DNA-based NF1 sequencing.

BACKGROUND: Patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) and plexiform  neurofibromas (PN) often have radiographically diagnosed distinct nodular  lesions (DNL) which can cause pain and weakness. Magnetic resonance-guided high  intensity focused ultrasound (MR-HIFU) can precisely and accurately deliver heat  to thermally ablate target tissue. The aim of this study is to evaluate  whole-body MRIs from patients with NF1 and DNL, applying volumetrics and a  consistent treatment planning approach to determine the feasibility of MR-HIFU  ablation of DNL. METHODS: A retrospective review of whole-body MRI scans from patients with NF1  and PN from CNH and NCI was performed. DNL are defined as lesions >3 cm,  distinct from PN and lacking the ""central dot"" feature. Criteria for MR-HIFU  thermal ablation include target location 1-8 cm from skin surface; >1 cm from  visible plexus, spinal canal, bladder, bowel, physis; and ability to ablate ≥50%  of lesion volume. Lesions in skull and vertebral body were excluded. RESULTS: In 26 patients, 120 DNL were identified. The majority of DNL were  located in an extremity (52.5%). Other sites included head/neck (7%), chest  (13%), and abdomen/pelvis (28%). The predefined HIFU ablation criteria was not  met for 47.5% of lesions (n = 57). The main limitation was proximity to a vital  structure or organ (79%). Complete and partial HIFU ablation was feasible for  25% and 27.5% of lesions, respectively. CONCLUSION: Based on imaging review of lesion location, technical considerations  and ability to target lesions, thermal ablation with MR-HIFU may be a feasible  noninvasive alternative for symptom management in patients with NF1 and  symptomatic DNL.  © The Author(s) 2021.

Genome editing in pigs has been made efficient, practical, and economically  viable by the CRISPR/Cas9 platform, representing a promising new era in  translational modeling of human disease for research and preclinical development  of therapies and devices. Porcine embryo microinjection provides a universally  available, efficient option over somatic-cell nuclear transfer, but requires  that critical considerations be made in genotypic validation of the models that  routinely go unaddressed. Accurate validation of genotypes is especially  important when modeling genetic disorders, such as neurofibromatosis type 1  (NF1) that exhibits complex genotype-phenotypic relationships. NF1, an autosomal  dominant disorder, is particularly hard to model as it manifests very  differently across patients, and even within families, with over 3,000  disease-associated mutations of the neurofibromin 1 (NF1) gene identified. The  precise nature of the mutations plays a role in the complex phenotypic  presentation of the disorder that includes benign and malignant peripheral and  central nervous system tumors, a variety of motor deficits and debilitating  cognitive impairments and musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal  disorders. NF1 can also often involve mutations in passenger genes such as TP53.  In this manuscript, we describe the creation of three novel porcine models of  NF1 and a model additionally harboring a mutation in TP53 by embryo  microinjection of CRISPR/Cas9. We present the challenges encountered in  validation of genotypes and the methodological strategies developed to counter  the hurdles. We present simple options for quantifying level of mosaicism: a  quantitative method (targeted amplicon sequencing) for small edits such as SNPs  and indels and a semiquantitative method (competitive PCR) for large edits.  Characterization of mosaicism allowed for strategic selection of founder pigs  for rapid, economical expansion of genetically defined lines. We also present  commonly observed unexpected DNA repair products (i.e., structural variants or  cryptic alleles) that are refractory to PCR amplification and thus evade  detection. We present the use of copy number variance assays to overcome hurdles  in detecting cryptic alleles. The report provides a framework for genotypic  validation of porcine models created by embryo microinjection and the expansion  of lines in an efficient manner.

OBJECTIVE: Research indicates that children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)  have weaknesses in fine and gross motor development in early childhood; however,  little is known about the stability and developmental trajectory of motor  functioning. We investigated (1) whether motor difficulties are evident and  stable in the preschool period in children with NF1 and (2) whether there are  particular patterns of motor development in this population. METHODS: Participants with NF1 and a control group of unaffected siblings were  enrolled at ages 3-8 years and were assessed yearly. Motor functioning was  assessed longitudinally using the Scales of Independent Behavior-Revised Motor  Scale and the Differential Ability Scales-II Copying subtest. Wilcoxon sign  tests were used to compare motor functioning at 3 or 4 years to 5 or 6 years old  for children with NF1 seen during both time periods (N = 27). Linear mixed model  growth curve analyses were used to compare trajectories for both children with  NF1 (N = 62) and unaffected siblings (N = 37). RESULTS: Children with NF1 made relative gains in raw scores, but not standard  scores, across measures. Growth curve analyses revealed a significant effect of  NF1 status on gross motor, fine motor, and copying scores, as well as an age by  NF1 status effect on fine and gross motor scores. CONCLUSIONS: Motor difficulties are evident early in life in children with NF1.  Though children with NF1 clearly acquire motor skills over time, they continue  to fall behind unaffected siblings, with the gap potentially widening over time.  Further implications are discussed.  © The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the  Society of Pediatric Psychology. All rights reserved.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is caused by loss-of-function variants in the NF1  gene. Approximately 10% of these variants affect RNA splicing and are either  missed by conventional DNA diagnostics or are misinterpreted by in silico  splicing predictions. Therefore, a targeted RNAseq-based approach was designed  to detect pathogenic RNA splicing and associated pathogenic DNA variants. For  this method RNA was extracted from lymphocytes, followed by targeted RNAseq.  Next, an in-house developed tool (QURNAs) was used to calculate the enrichment  score (ERS) for each splicing event. This method was thoroughly tested using two  different patient cohorts with known pathogenic splice-variants in NF1. In both  cohorts all 56 normal reference transcript exon splice junctions, 24 previously  described and 45 novel non-reference splicing events were detected.  Additionally, all expected pathogenic splice-variants were detected. Eleven  patients with NF1 symptoms were subsequently tested, three of which have a known  NF1 DNA variant with a putative effect on RNA splicing. This effect could be  confirmed for all 3. The other eight patients were previously without any  molecular confirmation of their NF1-diagnosis. A deep-intronic pathogenic splice  variant could now be identified for two of them (25%). These results suggest  that targeted RNAseq can be successfully used to detect pathogenic RNA splicing  variants in NF1.  © 2021. The Author(s).

SIGNIFICANCE: Current methods for analyzing pathological muscle tissue are time  consuming and rarely quantitative, and they involve invasive biopsies. Faster  and less invasive diagnosis of muscle disease may be achievable using  marker-free in vivo optical sensing methods. AIM: It was speculated that changes in the biochemical composition and structure  of muscle associated with pathology could be measured quantitatively using  visible wavelength optical spectroscopy techniques enabling automated  classification. APPROACH: A fiber-optic autofluorescence (AF) and diffuse reflectance (DR)  spectroscopy device was manufactured. The device and data processing techniques  based on principal component analysis were validated using in situ measurements  on healthy skeletal and cardiac muscle. These methods were then applied to two  mouse models of genetic muscle disease: a type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF1)  limb-mesenchyme knockout (Nf1Prx1  -  /  -  ) and a muscular dystrophy mouse  (mdx). RESULTS: Healthy skeletal and cardiac muscle specimens were separable using AF  and DR with receiver operator curve areas (ROC-AUC) of >0.79. AF and DR analyses  showed optically separable changes in Nf1Prx1  -  /  -   quadriceps muscle  (ROC-AUC >0.97) with no differences detected in the heart (ROC-AUC <0.67), which  does not undergo gene deletion in this model. Changes in AF spectra in mdx  muscle were seen between the 3 week and 10 week time points (ROC-AUC = 0.96) and  were not seen in the wild-type controls (ROC-AUC = 0.58). CONCLUSION: These findings support the utility of in vivo fiber-optic AF and DR  spectroscopy for the assessment of muscle tissue. This report highlights that  there is considerable scope to develop this marker-free optical technology for  preclinical muscle research and for diagnostic assessment of clinical myopathies  and dystrophies.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to assess the utility of  diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic  resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) to distinguish sporadic vestibular schwannomas (VSs)  from those related to neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 265 patients pathologically diagnosed with  VSs between January 2015 and October 2020 in a single institution. There were 28  patients (male: 19, female: 9; age 11-67 years) including 23 sporadic and five  NF2-related VSs, who had pretreatment DWI and DCE-MRI. Normalized mean apparent  diffusion coefficient (nADCmean) and DCE-MRI parameters along with tumor  characteristics were compared between sporadic and NF2-related VSs as  appropriate. The diagnostic performances were calculated based on the receiver  operating characteristic curve analysis for the values that showed significant  differences. To identify significant modalities, multivariate logistic  regression analysis was performed using nADCmean and the combination of  statistically significant DCE-MRI parameters. RESULTS: NADCmean, fractional volume of extracellular space (Ve), and forward  volume transfer constant (Ktrans) were significantly different between sporadic  and NF2-related VSs (nADCmean: median 1.62 vs. 1.16, P = .002; Ve: median 0.40  vs. 0.66, P = .007; Ktrans: median 0.17 vs. 0.33, P = .007), whereas fractional  plasma volume (Vp), reverse reflux rate constant (Kep), and tumor  characteristics were not. The diagnostic performances of nADCmean, Ve, and  Ktrans were 0.93, 0.90, and 0.90 area under the curves with cutoffs of 1.46,  0.51, and 0.29, respectively. nADCmean and the combination of Ve and Ktrans were  both chosen as significant differentiators by multivariate logistic regression  analysis (P = .027). CONCLUSIONS: DWI and DCE-MRI are both promising modalities to distinguish  sporadic and NF2-related VSs.  © 2022 American Society of Neuroimaging.

Clinical classification of missense variants often represents a challenge, due  to lack of evidence for pathogenicity and function. This study provides a  summary of NF2 missense variants, with variant classifications based on  currently available evidence. NF2 missense variants were collated from  pathology-associated databases and existing literature. Association for Clinical  Genomic Sciences Best Practice Guidelines (2020) were followed in the  application of evidence for variant interpretation and classification. The  majority of NF2 missense variants remain classified as variants of uncertain  significance. However, NF2 missense variants identified in gnomAD occurred at a  consistent rate across the gene, while variants compiled from  pathology-associated databases displayed differing rates of variation by exon of  NF2. The highest rate of NF2 disease-associated variants was observed in exon 7,  while lower rates were observed toward the C-terminus of the NF2 protein,  merlin. Further phenotypic information associated with variants, alongside  variant-specific functional analysis, is necessary for more definitive variant  interpretation. Our data identified differences in frequency of NF2 missense  variants by exon between gnomAD population data and NF2 disease-associated  variants, suggesting a potential genotype-phenotype correlation; further work is  necessary to substantiate this.  © 2022 The Authors.

(#)Contributed equally  Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are soft-tissue sarcomas that  are the leading cause of mortality in patients with Neurofibromatosis type 1  (NF1). Single chemotherapeutic agents have shown response rates ranging from 18%  to 44% in clinical trials, so there is still a high medical need to identify  chemotherapeutic combination treatments that improve clinical prognosis and  outcome. We screened a collection of compounds from the NCATS Mechanism  Interrogation PlatE (MIPE) library in three MPNST cell lines, using cell  viability and apoptosis assays. We then tested whether compounds that were  active as single agents were synergistic when screened as pairwise combinations.  Synergistic combinations in vitro were further evaluated in patient-derived  orthotopic xenograft/orthoxenograft (PDOX) athymic models engrafted with primary  MPNST matching with their paired primary-derived cell line where synergism was  observed. The high-throughput screening identified 21 synergistic combinations,  from which four exhibited potent synergies in a broad panel of MPNST cell lines.  One of the combinations, MK-1775 with Doxorubicin, significantly reduced tumor  growth in a sporadic PDOX model (MPNST-SP-01; sevenfold) and in an NF1-PDOX  model (MPNST-NF1-09; fourfold) and presented greater effects in TP53 mutated  MPNST cell lines. The other three combinations, all involving Panobinostat  (combined with NVP-BGT226, Torin 2, or Carfilzomib), did not reduce the tumor  volume in vivo at noncytotoxic doses. Our results support the utility of our  screening platform of in vitro and in vivo models to explore new therapeutic  approaches for MPNSTs and identified that combination MK-1775 with Doxorubicin  could be a good pharmacologic option for the treatment of these tumors.  ©2022 American Association for Cancer Research.

BACKGROUND: A high proportion of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)  present with functional hearing deficiency as a result of neural abnormality in  the late auditory brainstem. METHODS: In this randomized, two-period crossover study, we investigated the  hypothesis that remote-microphone listening devices can ameliorate hearing and  communication deficits in affected school-aged children (7-17 years). Speech  perception ability in background noise was evaluated in device-active and  inactive conditions using the CNC-word test. Participants were then randomized  to one of two treatment sequences: (1) inactive device for two weeks (placebo),  followed by active device use for two weeks, or (2) active device for 2 weeks,  followed by inactive device for 2 weeks. Listening and communication ratings  (LIFE-R Questionnaire) were obtained at baseline and at the end of each  treatment phase. RESULTS: Each participant demonstrated functional hearing benefits with  remote-microphone use. All showed a speech perception in noise increase when the  device was activated with a mean phoneme-score difference of 16.4% (p < 0.001)  and reported improved listening/communication abilities in the school classroom  (mean difference: 23.4%; p = 0.017). DISCUSSION: Conventional hearing aids are typically ineffective as a treatment  for auditory neural dysfunction, making sounds louder, but not clearer for  affected individuals. In this study, we demonstrate that remote-microphone  technologies are acceptable/tolerable in pediatric patients with NF1 and can  ameliorate their hearing deficits. CONCLUSION: Remote-microphone listening systems offer a viable treatment option  for children with auditory deficits associated with NF1.  © 2022. The Author(s).

Experimental tools and resources, such as animal models, cell lines, antibodies,  genetic reagents and biobanks, are key ingredients in biomedical research.  Investigators face multiple challenges when trying to understand the  availability, applicability and accessibility of these tools. A major challenge  is keeping up with current information about the numerous tools available for a  particular research problem. A variety of disease-agnostic projects such as the  Mouse Genome Informatics database and the Resource Identification Initiative  curate a number of types of research tools. Here, we describe our efforts to  build upon these resources to develop a disease-specific research tool resource  for the neurofibromatosis (NF) research community. This resource, the NF  Research Tools Database, is an open-access database that enables the exploration  and discovery of information about NF type 1-relevant animal models, cell lines,  antibodies, genetic reagents and biobanks. Users can search and explore tools,  obtain detailed information about each tool as well as read and contribute their  observations about the performance, reliability and characteristics of tools in  the database. NF researchers will be able to use the NF Research Tools Database  to promote, discover, share, reuse and characterize research tools, with the  goal of advancing NF research.

PURPOSE: The Danish neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) cohort was initiated to study  health-related, socioeconomic and psychological consequences of living with the  monogenetic disorder NF1 using a nationwide and population-based approach. PARTICIPANTS: The cohort includes all 2467 individuals in Denmark who were  hospitalised with or due to NF1 from 1977 to 2013 or registered in the RAREDIS  Database (1995-2013), a national clinical database for rare diseases, or both. A  comparison cohort matched to individuals with NF1 on sex and date of birth was  identified in the Civil Registration System (n=20 132). FINDINGS TO DATE: All cohort members were linked to the unique Danish registries  to obtain information on hospital contacts, birth outcomes, education and  partnership. A questionnaire was completed by 244 of the 629 adult cohort  members with NF1 registered in the RAREDIS Database to evaluate the psychosocial  and emotional burden. Further, neuropsychological tests were performed on 103  adult cohort members with NF1 and 38 adult population comparisons. To date, six  studies have been published. Individuals with NF1 had an increased risk for (1)  hospitalisation for disorders affecting all organ systems of the body throughout  all decades of life, (2) psychiatric disorders, (3) attaining a short or medium  long education and (4) not forming a life partner. Women with NF1 had an  increased risk for spontaneous abortions and stillbirths. Finally, adults with  NF1 had an impaired quality of life and a high need for professional support for  physical, psychological and work-related problems, which was partly associated  with disease severity and visibility. FUTURE PLANS: The cohort will regularly be updated with newly diagnosed patients  in the RAREDIS Database as well as with outcome information in the Danish  registries. New studies are in progress to assess other medical and  socioeconomic dimensions of living with NF1.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No  commercial re-use.

(#)Contributed equally  The poor survival and low efficiency of neuronal differentiation limits the  therapeutic effects of transplanted neural stem cells in the treatment of spinal  cord injury. Neurofibromatosis-1 (NF-1) is a tumor suppressor gene that  restricts the rapid and abnormal growth and differentiation of neural cells. In  the present study, lentiviral vectors were used to knock out NF-1, Ricotr (the  core member of mTORC2) or NF-1+Ricotr in neural stem cells in vitro, and the  NF-1, Ricotr or NF-1+Ricotr knockout neural stem cells were transplanted at the  lesion site in a rat model of spinal cord injury (SCI). We first demonstrated  that targeted knockout of NF-1 had an antiapoptotic effect and improved neuronal  differentiation by enhancing the mTORC2/Rictor pathway of neural stem cells in  vitro. Subsequently, transplanting NF-1 knockout neural stem cells into the  injured site sufficiently promoted the tissue repair and functional recovery of  rats with spinal cord injury by enhancing the survival and neuronal  differentiation of grafted neural stem cells. Collectively, these findings  reveal a prominent role of NF-1 in neural stem cell biology, which is an  invaluable step forward in enhancing the benefit of neural stem cell-mediated  regenerative cell therapy for spinal cord injury and identifies the  transplantation of NF-1 knockout neural stem cells as a promising strategy for  spinal cord injury.  © 2022.

NF2-related schwannomatosis (NF2-related SWN) is an autosomal dominant condition  caused by loss of function variants in the NF2 gene, which codes for the protein  Merlin and is characterized by the development of multiple tumors of the nervous  system. The clinical presentation of the disease is variable and related to the  type of the inherited germline variant. Here, we tested if phosphorodiamidate  morpholino oligomers (PMOs) could be used to correct the splice signaling caused  by variants at ±13 within the intron-exon boundary region and showed that the  PMOs designed for these variants do not constitute a therapeutic approach.  Furthermore, we evaluated the use of PMOs to decrease the severity of the  effects of NF2 truncating variants with the aim of generating milder hypomorphic  isoforms in vitro through the induction of the in-frame deletion of the  exon-carrying variant. We were able to specifically induce the skipping of exons  4, 8, and 11 maintaining the NF2 gene reading frame at cDNA level. Only the  skipping of exon 11 produced a hypomorphic Merlin (Merlin-e11), which is able to  partially rescue the observed phenotype in primary fibroblast cultures from  NF2-related SWN patients, being encouraging for the treatment of patients  harboring truncating variants located in exon 11.  © 2022 The Author(s).

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a rare genetic disease that causes  a wide range of disabilities leading to compromised quality of life (QOL). There  is clear need for a validated disease-specific tool to assess quality of life  among German-speaking patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). The NFTI-QOL  questionnaire has produced useful results in English-speaking cohorts. The aim  of this study was to produce and validate a German version of the NFTI-QOL  (NFTI-QOL-D) and to correlate QOL scores with a depression score (PHQ-9) and  clinical disease severity. METHODS: The original English-language NFTI-QOL was translated into German and  then back-translated in order to preserve the questionnaire's original concepts  and intentions. A link to an online survey encompassing the NFTI-QOL-D and the  PHQ-9 depression questionnaire was then sent to 97 patients with NF2 by email.  The respondents' scores were compared to clinician-reported disease severity  scores. RESULTS: 77 patients completed the online survey in full. Internal reliability  among NFTI-QOL-D responses was strong (Cronbach's alpha: 0.74). Both PHQ-9 and  clinician disease severity scores correlated with NFTI-QOL-D scores (Pearson's  rho 0.63 and 0.62, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The NFTI-QOL-D is a reliable and useful tool to assess  patient-reported QOL in German-speaking patients with NF2. The correlation of  QOL with both psychological and physical disease parameters underlines the  importance of individualized interdisciplinary patient care for NF2 patients,  with attention paid to mental well-being as well as to somatic disease  manifestations.  © 2023.

Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) patients develop an array of benign and malignant  tumors, of which Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors (MPNST) and High Grade  Gliomas (HGG) have a dismal prognosis. About 15-20% of individuals with NF1  develop brain tumors and one third of these occur outside of the optic pathway.  These non-optic pathway gliomas are more likely to progress to malignancy,  especially in adults. Despite their low frequency, high grade gliomas have a  disproportional effect on the morbidity of NF1 patients. In vitro drug  combination screens have not been performed on NF1-associated HGG, hindering our  ability to develop informed clinical trials. Here we present the first in vitro  drug combination screen (21 compounds alone or in combination with MEK or PI3K  inhibitors) on the only human NF1 patient derived HGG cell line available and on  three mouse glioma cell lines derived from the NF1-P53 genetically engineered  mouse model, which sporadically develop HGG. These mouse glioma cell lines were  never exposed to serum, grow as spheres and express markers that are consistent  with an Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cell (OPC) lineage origin. Importantly, even  though the true cell of origin for HGG remains elusive, they are thought to  arise from the OPC lineage. We evaluated drug sensitivities of the three murine  glioma cell lines in a 3D spheroid growth assay, which more accurately reflects  drug sensitivities in vivo. Excitingly, we identified six compounds targeting  HDACs, BRD4, CHEK1, BMI-1, CDK1/2/5/9, and the proteasome that potently induced  cell death in our NF1-associated HGG. Moreover, several of these inhibitors work  synergistically with either MEK or PI3K inhibitors. This study forms the basis  for further pre-clinical evaluation of promising targets, with an eventual hope  to translate these to the clinic.  Copyright: © 2023 Dougherty et al.

Nervous system cancers are the 10th leading cause of death worldwide, many of  which are difficult to diagnose and exhibit varying degrees of treatment  resistance. The limitations of existing cancer models, such as patient-derived  xenograft (PDX) models and genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models, call for  the development of novel preclinical cancer models to more faithfully mimic the  patient's cancer and offer additional insights. Recent advances in human stem  cell biology, organoid, and genome-editing techniques allow us to model nervous  system tumors in three types of next-generation tumor models: cell-of-origin  models, tumor organoids, and 3D multicellular coculture models. In this review,  we introduced and compared different human stem cell/organoid-derived models,  and comprehensively summarized and discussed the recently developed models for  various primary tumors in the central and peripheral nervous systems, including  glioblastoma (GBM), H3K27M-mutant Diffuse Midline Glioma (DMG) and H3G34R-mutant  High-grade Glioma (HGG), Low-grade Glioma (LGG), Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1),  Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2), Medulloblastoma (MB), Atypical Teratoid/rhabdoid  Tumor (AT/RT), and meningioma. We further compared these models with PDX and GEM  models, and discussed the opportunities and challenges of precision nervous  cancer modeling with human stem cells and organoids.  © 2023.

We previously discovered a sex-by-genotype defect in microglia function using a  heterozygous germline knockout mouse model of Neurofibromatosis type 1  (Nf1 ± mice), in which only microglia from male Nf1 ± mice exhibited defects in  purinergic signaling. Herein, we leveraged an unbiased proteomic approach to  demonstrate that male, but not female, heterozygous Nf1 ± microglia exhibit  differences in protein expression, which largely reflect pathways involved in  cytoskeletal organization. In keeping with these predicted defects in  cytoskeletal function, only male Nf1 ± microglia had reduced process  arborization and surveillance capacity. To determine whether these microglial  defects were cell autonomous or reflected adaptive responses to Nf1  heterozygosity in other cells in the brain, we generated conditional microglia  Nf1-mutant knockout mice by intercrossing Nf1flox/flox with Cx3cr1-CreER mice  (Nf1flox/wt; Cx3cr1-CreER mice, Nf1MG ± mice). Surprisingly, neither male nor  female Nf1MG ± mouse microglia had impaired process arborization or surveillance  capacity. In contrast, when Nf1 heterozygosity was generated in neurons,  astrocytes and oligodendrocytes by intercrossing Nf1flox/flox with hGFAP-Cre  mice (Nf1flox/wt; hGFAP-Cre mice, Nf1GFAP ± mice), the microglia defects found  in Nf1 ± mice were recapitulated. Collectively, these data reveal that  Nf1 ± sexually dimorphic microglia abnormalities are likely not cell-intrinsic  properties, but rather reflect a response to Nf1 heterozygosity in other brain  cells.  © 2023.

The advancement of CRISPR mediated gene engineering provides an opportunity to  improve upon preclinical human cell line models of cancer predisposing  syndromes. This review focuses on using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tools to  model various human cancer predisposition syndromes. We examine the genetic  mutations associated with neurofibromatosis type 1, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Gorlin  syndrome, BRCA mutant breast and ovarian cancers, and APC mutant cancers.  Furthermore, we discuss the possibilities of using next-generation  CRISPR-derived precision gene editing tools to introduce a variety of genetic  lesions into human cell lines. The goal is to improve the quality of preclinical  models surrounding these cancer predisposition syndromes through dissecting the  effects of these mutations on the development of cancer and to provide new  insights into the underlying mechanisms of these cancer predisposition  syndromes. These studies demonstrate the continued utility and improvement of  CRISPR/Cas9-induced human cell line models in studying the genetic basis of  cancer.  © 2023 The Authors.

(#)Contributed equally  Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a highly aggressive sarcoma,  and a lethal neurofibromatosis type 1-related malignancy, with little progress  made on treatment strategies. Here, we apply a multiplatform integrated  molecular analysis on 108 tumors spanning the spectrum of peripheral nerve  sheath tumors to identify candidate drivers of MPNST that can serve as  therapeutic targets. Unsupervised analyses of methylome and transcriptome  profiles identify two distinct subgroups of MPNSTs with unique targetable  oncogenic programs. We establish two subgroups of MPNSTs: SHH pathway activation  in MPNST-G1 and WNT/ß-catenin/CCND1 pathway activation in MPNST-G2. Single  nuclei RNA sequencing characterizes the complex cellular architecture and  demonstrate that malignant cells from MPNST-G1 and MPNST-G2 have neural  crest-like and Schwann cell precursor-like cell characteristics, respectively.  Further, in pre-clinical models of MPNST we confirm that inhibiting SHH pathway  in MPNST-G1 prevent growth and malignant progression, providing the rational for  investigating these treatments in clinical trials.  © 2023.

BACKGROUND: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are aggressive soft  tissue sarcomas that often develop in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1  (NF1). To address the critical need for novel therapeutics in MPNST, we aimed to  establish an ex vivo 3D platform that accurately captured the genomic diversity  of MPNST and could be utilized in a medium-throughput manner for drug screening  studies to be validated in vivo using patient-derived xenografts (PDX). METHODS: Genomic analysis was performed on all PDX-tumor pairs. Selected PDX  were harvested for assembly into 3D microtissues. Based on prior work in our  labs, we evaluated drugs (trabectedin, olaparib, and mirdametinib) ex vivo and  in vivo. For 3D microtissue studies, cell viability was the endpoint as assessed  by Zeiss Axio Observer. For PDX drug studies, tumor volume was measured twice  weekly. Bulk RNA sequencing was performed to identify pathways enriched in  cells. RESULTS: We developed 13 NF1-associated MPNST-PDX and identified mutations or  structural abnormalities in NF1 (100%), SUZ12 (85%), EED (15%), TP53 (15%),  CDKN2A (85%), and chromosome 8 gain (77%). We successfully assembled PDX into 3D  microtissues, categorized as robust (>90% viability at 48 h), good (>50%), or  unusable (<50%). We evaluated drug response to ""robust"" or ""good"" microtissues,  namely MN-2, JH-2-002, JH-2-079-c, and WU-225. Drug response ex vivo predicted  drug response in vivo, and enhanced drug effects were observed in select models. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the successful establishment of a novel 3D  platform for drug discovery and MPNST biology exploration in a system  representative of the human condition.  © The Author(s) 2023.

This study aims to (1) investigate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in  children with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) using the Pediatric Quality of Life  inventory (PedsQL) and the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ); and (2) compare the  psychometric properties and content of these questionnaires in NF1 patients.  PedsQL and CHQ proxy-reports were administered to parents/caregivers of 160  patients with NF1 aged 5-12 years. HRQoL scores were compared with Dutch  population norms using independent t-tests. Psychometric properties (feasibility  and reliability) were assessed by floor/ceiling effects and Cronbach's alpha  coefficient. A principal component analysis (PCA) with varimax rotation was  performed to identify the data's internal structure. By content mapping, we  identified unique constructs of each questionnaire. Proxy-reported HRQoL was  significantly lower on all PedsQL subscales for children aged 5-7 years, and on  4/6 subscales for children aged 8-12 years compared to norms. Significantly  lower HRQoL was reported on 6/14 CHQ subscales (children 5-7 years) and 9/14  subscales (children 8-12 years). The PedsQL showed slightly better feasibility  and reliability. The PCA identified two components, representing psychosocial  and physical aspects of HRQoL, explaining 63% of total variance. Both  questionnaires showed relevant loadings on both components. The CHQ subscales  concerning parents and family were considered unique contributions.  Proxy-reported HRQoL of children with NF1 is significantly lower compared to  norms on multiple domains. Both questionnaires adequately measure HRQoL in  children with NF1. However, the PedsQL has slightly better psychometric  properties, while the CHQ covers a unique dimension of HRQoL associated with  disease impact on parents and family.  © 2023 The Authors.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is caused by a nonfunctional copy of the NF1  tumor suppressor gene that predisposes patients to the development of cutaneous  neurofibromas (cNFs), the skin tumor that is the hallmark of this condition.  Innumerable benign cNFs, each appearing by an independent somatic inactivation  of the remaining functional NF1 allele, form in nearly all patients with NF1.  One of the limitations in developing a treatment for cNFs is an incomplete  understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and limitations in experimental  modeling. Recent advances in preclinical in vitro and in vivo modeling have  substantially enhanced our understanding of cNF biology and created  unprecedented opportunities for therapeutic discovery. We discuss the current  state of cNF preclinical in vitro and in vivo model systems, including two- and  three-dimensional cell cultures, organoids, genetically engineered mice,  patient-derived xenografts, and porcine models. We highlight the models'  relationship to human cNFs and how they can be used to gain insight into cNF  development and therapeutic discovery.  Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

BACKGROUND: The notion of ""burden"" has taken a key place in the evaluation of  care, particularly in the case of rare diseases. The aim of this study was to  evaluate the psychometric properties of the burden of neurofibromatosis 1  questionnaire (BoN) and to determine the perceived disease burden. RESULTS: The 15-item BoN was translated into Persian, and no items were removed  based on content validity. The adequacy of the sample was acceptable  (KMO = 0.902), and Bartlett's test of sphericity revealed statistically  significant results (P < 0.001). Exploratory factor analysis revealed three  factors. The reliability of the scale was good (Cronbach's alpha: 0.90), and the  intraclass coefficient was 0.85. The severity of the burden of neurofibromatosis  was moderate, and the total mean burden score was 33.12 ± 16.12. CONCLUSIONS: The Persian version of the BoN is an acceptable tool in terms of  structure and content, and it specifically assesses the practical aspects of  daily activities for patients with neurofibromatosis.  © 2023.

IMPORTANCE: Neurofibromatoses (NF; NF1, NF2, and schwannomatosis) are hereditary  tumor predisposition syndromes with a risk for poor quality of life (QOL) and no  evidence-based treatments. OBJECTIVE: To compare a mind-body skills training program, the Relaxation  Response Resiliency Program for NF (3RP-NF), with a health education program  (Health Enhancement Program for NF; HEP-NF) for improvement of quality of life  among adults with NF. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This single-blind, remote randomized clinical  trial randomly assigned 228 English-speaking adults with NF from around the  world on a 1:1 basis, stratified by NF type, between October 1, 2017, and  January 31, 2021, with the last follow-up February 28, 2022. INTERVENTIONS: Eight 90-minute group virtual sessions of 3RP-NF or HEP-NF. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes were collected at baseline, after  treatment, and at 6-month and 1-year follow-up. The primary outcomes were  physical health and psychological domain scores of the World Health Organization  Quality of Life Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF). Secondary outcomes were the social  relationships and environment domain scores of the WHOQOL-BREF. Scores are  reported as transformed domain scores (range, 0-100, with higher scores  indicating higher QOL). Analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: Of 371 participants who underwent screening, 228 were randomized (mean  [SD] age, 42.7 [14.5] years; 170 women [75%]), and 217 attended 6 or more of 8  sessions and provided posttest data. Participants in both programs improved from  baseline to after treatment in primary outcomes of physical health QOL score  (3RP-NF, 5.1; 95% CI, 3.2-7.0; P < .001; HEP-NF, 6.4; 95% CI, 4.6-8.3; P < .001)  and psychological QOL score (3RP-NF, 8.5; 95% CI, 6.4-10.7; P < .001; HEP-NF,  9.2; 95% CI, 7.1-11.2; P < .001). Participants in the 3RP-NF group showed  sustained improvements after treatment to 12 months; posttreatment improvements  for the HEP-NF group diminished (between-group difference for physical health  QOL score, 4.9; 95% CI, 2.1-7.7; P = .001; effect size [ES] = 0.3; and  psychological QOL score, 3.7; 95% CI, 0.2-7.6; P = .06; ES = 0.2). Results were  similar for secondary outcomes of social relationships and environmental QOL.  There were significant between-group differences from baseline to 12 months in  favor of the 3RP-NF for physical health QOL score (3.6; 95% CI, 0.5-6.6;  P = .02; ES = 0.2), social relationships QOL score (6.9; 95% CI, 1.2-12.7;  P = .02; ES = 0.3), and environmental QOL score (3.5; 95% CI, 0.4-6.5; P = .02;  ES = 0.2). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial of 3RP-NF vs  HEP-NF, benefits from 3RP-NF and HEP-NF were comparable after treatment, but at  12 months from baseline, 3RP-NF was superior to HEP-NF on all primary and  secondary outcomes. Results support the implementation of 3RP-NF in routine  care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03406208.

PURPOSE: To test the effects of the Relaxation Response Resiliency Program -  Neurofibromatosis (3RP-NF), a mind-body resilience program for people with NF,  on resilience factors from baseline to post-treatment and 6- and 12-month  follow-up. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a fully powered randomized clinical  trial (RCT) of 3RP-NF and health education control (HEP-NF). We recruited adults  with NF1, NF2, or schwannomatosis who reported stress or difficulty coping with  NF symptoms. Both conditions received 8 weekly 90-minute group sessions; 3RP-NF  focused on building resilience skills. We measured resilience factors via the  Measure of Current Status-A (adaptive coping), Cognitive and Affective  Mindfulness Scale-Revised (mindfulness), Gratitude Questionnaire-6 (gratitude),  Life Orientation Test Optimism Scale (optimism), and Medical Outcomes Study  Social Support Survey (perceived social support) at baseline, post-intervention,  and 6- and 12-month follow-up. We used linear mixed models with completely  unstructured covariance across up to four repeated measurements (baseline,  post-treatment, and 6- and 12-month follow-up) to investigate treatment effects  on resilience factors. RESULTS: We enrolled 228 individuals (Mage=42.7, SD = 14.6; 74.5% female; 87.7%  White; 72.8% NF1, 14.0% NF2, 13.2% schwannomatosis). Within groups, both 3RP-NF  and HEP-NF showed statistically significant improvements in all outcomes across  timepoints. 3RP-NF showed significantly greater improvement in adaptive coping  compared to HEP-NF from baseline to post-intervention and baseline to 6 months  (Mdifference= 0.29; 95% CI 0.13-0.46; p < 0.001; Mdifference= 0.25; 95% CI  0.07-0.33; p = 0.005); there were no other between-group differences amongst the  remaining resilience factors. CONCLUSION: 3RP-NF showed promise in sustainably improving coping abilities  amongst people with NF. TRIAL REGISTRATION INFORMATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03406208.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder, with up  to 50% of patients clinically displaying skeletal defects. Currently, the  pathogenesis of bone disorders in NF1 patients is unclear, and there are no  effective preventive and treatment measures. In this study, we found that  knockout of the NF1 gene reduced cAMP levels and osteogenic differentiation in  an osteoblast model, and icariin activated the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway to promote  osteoblast differentiation of the NF1 gene knockout cell model by increasing  intracellular cAMP levels. The PKA selective inhibitor H89 significantly  impaired the stimulatory effect of icariin on osteogenesis in the NF1 cell  model. In this study, an osteoblast model of NF1 was successfully constructed,  and icariin was applied to the cell model for the first time. The results will  help to elucidate the molecular mechanism of NF1 bone disease and provide new  ideas for the clinical prevention and treatment of NF1 bone disease and drug  development in the future.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) results from germline mutations in the  tumor-suppressor gene NF1 and predisposes patients to developing nervous system  tumors. Twenty percent of NF1 patients harbor nonsense mutations resulting in  premature termination codons (PTCs). Nonsense suppression therapies can  facilitate ribosomal readthrough of PTCs to restore full-length protein, but  their potential in NF1 is underexplored. We developed a minipig model of NF1  carrying a PTC to test whether nonsense suppression could restore expression of  the NF1-encoded protein neurofibromin in vitro and in vivo. Nonsense suppression  did not reliably increase neurofibromin in primary NF1-/- Schwann cells isolated  from minipig neurofibromas but could reduce phosphorylated ERK. Gentamicin  in vivo produced a similar plasma pharmacokinetic profile to humans and was  detectable in clinically relevant tissues, including cerebral cortex, sciatic  nerve, optic nerve, and skin. In gentamicin-treated animals, increased  neurofibromin expression was seen in the optic nerve. Nonsense-mediated decay  (NMD) causes degradation of transcripts with PTCs, which could impede nonsense  suppression therapies. Nonsense suppression in combination with NMD inhibition  restored neurofibromin protein expression in primary NF1-/- Schwann cells  isolated from minipig neurofibromas. Thus, the effectiveness of nonsense  suppression therapies can be improved in NF1 by the concurrent use of NMD  inhibitors.  © 2023 The Authors.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic neurodevelopmental  disorder commonly associated with impaired cognitive function. Despite the  well-explored functional roles of neural oscillations in neurotypical  populations, only a limited number of studies have investigated oscillatory  activity in the NF1 population. METHODS: We compared oscillatory spectral power and theta phase coherence in a  paediatric sample with NF1 (N = 16; mean age: 13.03 years; female: n = 7) to an  age/sex-matched typically developing control group (N = 16; mean age:  13.34 years; female: n = 7) using electroencephalography measured during rest  and during working memory task performance. RESULTS: Relative to typically developing children, the NF1 group displayed  higher resting state slow wave power and a lower peak alpha frequency. Moreover,  higher theta power and frontoparietal theta phase coherence were observed in the  NF1 group during working memory task performance, but these differences  disappeared when controlling for baseline (resting state) activity. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, results suggest that NF1 is characterised by aberrant  resting state oscillatory activity that may contribute towards the cognitive  impairments experienced in this population.

Single nucleotide variants in the general population are common genomic  alterations, where the majority are presumed to be silent polymorphisms without  known clinical significance. Using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)  cerebral organoid modeling of the 1.4 megabase Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)  deletion syndrome, we previously discovered that the cytokine receptor-like  factor-3 (CRLF3) gene, which is co-deleted with the NF1 gene, functions as a  major regulator of neuronal maturation. Moreover, children with NF1 and the  CRLF3L389P variant have greater autism burden, suggesting that this gene might  be important for neurologic function. To explore the functional consequences of  this variant, we generated CRLF3L389P-mutant hiPSC lines and Crlf3L389P-mutant  genetically engineered mice. While this variant does not impair protein  expression, brain structure, or mouse behavior, CRLF3L389P-mutant human cerebral  organoids and mouse brains exhibit impaired neuronal maturation and dendrite  formation. In addition, Crlf3L389P-mutant mouse neurons have reduced dendrite  lengths and branching, without any axonal deficits. Moreover, Crlf3L389P-mutant  mouse hippocampal neurons have decreased firing rates and synaptic current  amplitudes relative to wild type controls. Taken together, these findings  establish the CRLF3L389P variant as functionally deleterious and suggest that it  may be a neurodevelopmental disease modifier.  © The Author(s) 2023.

(#)Contributed equally  Plexiform neurofibroma (PN) is a leading cause of morbidity in children with the  genetic condition Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1), often disfiguring or  threatening vital structures. During formation of PN, a complex tumor  microenvironment (TME) develops, with recruitment of neoplastic and  non-neoplastic cell types being critical for growth and progression. Due to the  cohesive cellularity of PN, single-cell RNA-sequencing is difficult and may  result in a loss of detection of critical cellular subpopulations. To bypass  this barrier, we performed single-nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) on 8 frozen  PN samples, and integrated this with spatial transcriptomics (ST) in 4 PN  samples and immunohistochemistry to provide morphological context to  transcriptomic data. SnRNA-seq analysis definitively charted the heterogeneous  cellular subpopulations in the PN TME, with the predominant fraction being  fibroblast subtypes. PN showed a remarkable amount of inter-sample homogeneity  regarding cellular subpopulation proportions despite being resected from a  variety of anatomical locations. ST analysis identified distinct cellular  subpopulations which were annotated using snRNA-seq data and correlated with  histological features. Schwann cell/fibroblast interactions were identified by  receptor/ligand interaction analysis demonstrating a high probability of  Neurexin 1/Neuroligin 1 (NRXN1/NLGN1) receptor-ligand cross-talk predicted  between fibroblasts and non-myelinated Schwann cells (NM-SC) and subtypes,  respectively. We observed aberrant expression of NRXN1 and NLGN1 in our PN  snRNA-seq data compared to a normal mouse sciatic nerve single-cell RNA-seq  dataset. This pathway has never been described in PN and may indicate a clear  and direct communication pathway between putative NM-SC cells of origin and  surrounding fibroblasts, potentially driving disease progression. SnRNA-seq  integrated with spatial transcriptomics advances our understanding of the  complex cellular heterogeneity of PN TME and identify potential novel  communication pathways that may drive disease progression, a finding that could  provide translational therapy options for patients with these devastating tumors  of childhood and early adulthood.  © 2023.

Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common genetically inherited  disorders that affects 1 in 3000 children annually. Clinical manifestations vary  widely but nearly always include the development of cutaneous, plexiform and  diffuse neurofibromas that are managed over many years. Recent single-cell  transcriptomics profiling efforts of neurofibromas have begun to reveal cell  signaling processes. However, the cell signaling networks in mature,  non-cutaneous neurofibromas remain unexplored. Here, we present insights into  the cellular composition and signaling within mature neurofibromas, contrasting  with normal adjacent tissue, in a porcine model of NF1 using single-cell RNA  sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis and histopathological characterization. These  neurofibromas exhibited classic diffuse-type histologic morphology and expected  patterns of S100, SOX10, GFAP, and CD34 immunohistochemistry. The porcine mature  neurofibromas closely resemble human neurofibromas histologically and contain  all known cellular components of their human counterparts. The scRNA-seq  confirmed the presence of all expected cell types within these neurofibromas and  identified novel populations of fibroblasts and immune cells, which may  contribute to the tumor microenvironment by suppressing inflammation, promoting  M2 macrophage polarization, increasing fibrosis, and driving the proliferation  of Schwann cells. Notably, we identified tumor-associated IDO1 +/CD274+ (PD-L1)  + dendritic cells, which represent the first such observation in any NF1 animal  model and suggest the role of the upregulation of immune checkpoints in mature  neurofibromas. Finally, we observed that cell types in the tumor  microenvironment are poised to promote immune evasion, extracellular matrix  reconstruction, and nerve regeneration.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant condition caused by  germline mutations in the neurofibromin 1 (NF1) gene. Children with NF1 are  prone to the development of multiple nervous system abnormalities, including  autism and brain tumors, which could reflect the effect of NF1 mutation on  microglia function. Using heterozygous Nf1-mutant mice, we previously  demonstrated that impaired purinergic signaling underlies deficits in microglia  process extension and phagocytosis in situ. To determine whether these  abnormalities are also observed in human microglia in the setting of NF1, we  leveraged an engineered isogenic series of human induced pluripotent stem cells  to generate human microglia-like (hiMGL) cells heterozygous for three different  NF1 gene mutations found in patients with NF1. Whereas all NF1-mutant and  isogenic control hiMGL cells expressed classical microglia markers and exhibited  similar transcriptomes and cytokine/chemokine release profiles, only NF1-mutant  hiMGL cells had defects in P2X receptor activation, phagocytosis and motility.  Taken together, these findings indicate that heterozygous NF1 mutations impair a  subset of the functional properties of human microglia, which could contribute  to the neurological abnormalities seen in children with NF1.  © 2023.

Electronic address: eric.pasmant@inserm.fr.  Neurofibromatosis type-1 is a genetic disorder caused by loss-of-function  variants in the tumor-suppressor NF1. Approximately 4% to 11% of  neurofibromatosis type-1 patients have a NF1 locus complete deletion resulting  from nonallelic homologous recombination between low copy repeats. Codeleted  genes probably account for the more severe phenotype observed in NF1-deleted  patients. This genotype-phenotype correlation highlights the need for a detailed  molecular description. A droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) set along the NF1 locus was  designed to delimitate the three recurrent NF1 deletion breakpoints. The ddPCR  was tested in 121 samples from nonrelated NF1-deleted patients. Classification  based on ddPCR versus multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA)  was compared. In addition, microsatellites were analyzed to identify parental  origin of deletions. ddPCR identified 77 type-1 (64%), 20 type-2 (16%), 7 type-3  (6%), and 17 atypical deletions (14%). The results were comparable with MLPA,  except for three atypical deletions misclassified as type-2 using MLPA, for  which the SUZ12 gene was not deleted. A significant maternal bias (25 of 30) in  the origin of deletions was identified. This study proposes a fast and efficient  ddPCR quantification to allow fine NF1 deletion classification. It indicates  that ddPCR can be implemented easily into routine diagnosis to complement the  techniques dedicated to NF1 point variant identification. This new tool may help  unravel the genetic basis conditioning phenotypic variability in NF1-deleted  patients and offer tailored genetic counseling.

Yuan J(1), Fu Y, Liu Y.  Author information: (1)Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, The Second  Affiliated Hospital, Jiangxi Medical College, Nanchang University, Nanchang,  Jiangxi, China.  Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2)-related vestibular schwannoma (NF2-VS) is a rare  genetic disorder that results in bilateral acoustic neuromas. However, the exact  pathogenesis of the disease is still unclear. This study aims to use  bioinformatics analyses to identify potential hub genes and therapeutic. We  retrieved the mRNA expression profiles (GSE108524 and GSE141801) of NF2-VS from  the database, and selected the leading 25% genes with the most variance across  samples for weighted correlation network analysis. Subsequently, we conducted  gene ontology term and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes signaling network  enrichment analyses. The STRING database was employed for protein-protein  interaction (PPI) axis construction. The mRNA-miRNA modulatory network was  generated via the miRTarBase database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs)  were identified via the R package ""limma"" in both datasets, and hub genes were  screened via intersection of common DEGs, candidate hub genes from the PPI axis,  and candidate hub genes from the key module. Finally, common DEGs were uploaded  onto the connectivity map database to determine drug candidates. Based on our  observations, the blue module exhibited the most significant relation to NF2-VS,  and it included the NF2 gene. Using enrichment analysis, we demonstrated that  the blue modules were intricately linked to modulations of cell proliferation,  migration, adhesion, junction, and actin skeleton. Overall, 356 common DEGs were  screened in both datasets, and 33 genes carrying a degree > 15 were chosen as  candidate hub genes in the PPI axis. Subsequently, 4 genes, namely, GLUL, CAV1,  MYH11, and CCND1 were recognized as real hub genes. In addition, 10 drugs with  enrichment scores < -0.7 were identified as drug candidates. Our conclusions  offered a novel insight into the potential underlying mechanisms behind NF2-VS.  These findings may facilitate the identification of novel therapeutic targets in  the future.

(#)Contributed equally  PURPOSE: Plexiform neurofibromas (PNF) are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors  (PNST) associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Despite similar  histologic appearance, these neoplasms exhibit diverse evolutionary  trajectories, with a subset progressing to malignant peripheral nerve sheath  tumor (MPNST), the leading cause of premature death in individuals with NF1.  Malignant transformation of PNF often occurs through the development of atypical  neurofibroma (ANF) precursor lesions characterized by distinct histopathologic  features and CDKN2A copy-number loss. Although genomic studies have uncovered  key driver events promoting tumor progression, the transcriptional changes  preceding malignant transformation remain poorly defined. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Here we resolve gene-expression profiles in PNST across the  neurofibroma-to-MPNST continuum in NF1 patients and mouse models, revealing  early molecular features associated with neurofibroma evolution and  transformation. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrate that ANF exhibit enhanced signatures of  antigen presentation and immune response, which are suppressed as malignant  transformation ensues. MPNST further displayed deregulated survival and mitotic  fidelity pathways, and targeting key mediators of these pathways, CENPF and  BIRC5, disrupted the growth and viability of human MPNST cell lines and primary  murine Nf1-Cdkn2a-mutant Schwann cell precursors. Finally, neurofibromas  contiguous with MPNST manifested distinct alterations in core oncogenic and  immune surveillance programs, suggesting that early molecular events driving  disease progression may precede histopathologic evidence of malignancy. CONCLUSIONS: If validated prospectively in future studies, these signatures may  serve as molecular diagnostic tools to augment conventional histopathologic  diagnosis by identifying neurofibromas at high risk of undergoing malignant  transformation, facilitating risk-adapted care.  ©2023 American Association for Cancer Research.

Background: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder characterized  by heterozygous germline NF1 gene mutations that predispose patients to  developing plexiform neurofibromas, which are benign but often disfiguring  tumors of the peripheral nerve sheath induced by loss of heterozygosity at the  NF1 locus. These can progress to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors  (MPNSTs). There are no approved drug treatments for adults with NF1-related  inoperable plexiform neurofibromas, and only one drug (selumetinib), which is an  FDA-approved targeted therapy for the treatment of symptomatic pediatric  plexiform neurofibromas, highlighting the need for additional drug screening and  development. In high-throughput screening, the effectiveness of drugs against  cell lines is often assessed by measuring in vitro potency (AC50) or the area  under the curve (AUC). However, the variability of dose-response curves across  drugs and cell lines and the frequency of partial effectiveness suggest that  these measures alone fail to provide a full picture of overall efficacy.  Methods: Using concentration-response data, we combined response effectiveness  (EFF) and potency (AC50) into (a) a score characterizing the effect of a  compound on a single cell line, S = log[EFF/AC50], and (b) a relative score, ΔS,  characterizing the relative difference between a reference (e.g., non-tumor) and  test (tumor) cell line. ΔS was applied to data from high-throughput screening  (HTS) of a drug panel tested on NF1-/- tumor cells, using immortalized non-tumor  NF1+/- cells as a reference. Results: We identified drugs with sensitivity,  targeting expected pathways, such as MAPK-ERK and PI3K-AKT, as well as  serotonin-related targets, among others. The ΔS technique used here, in tandem  with a supplemental ΔS web tool, simplifies HTS analysis and may provide a  springboard for further investigations into drug response in NF1-related  cancers. The tool may also prove useful for drug development in a variety of  other cancers.  DOI: 10.3390/cancers15245811 PMCID: PMC10742026 PMID: 38136356  Conflict of interest statement: Authors Paul O.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Individuals with neurofibromatosis 1 may experience changes in  their appearance due to physical manifestations of the disorders and/or  treatment sequelae. Appearance concerns related to these physical changes can  lead to psychological distress and poorer quality of life. While many  neurofibromatosis 1 clinical trials focus on assessing changes in tumor volume,  evaluating patients' perspectives on corresponding changes in symptoms such as  physical appearance can be key secondary outcomes. We aimed to determine whether  any existing patient-reported outcome measures are appropriate for evaluating  changes in appearance concerns within neurofibromatosis 1 clinical trials. METHODS: After updating our previously published systematic review process, we  used it to identify and rate existing patient-reported outcome measures related  to disfigurement and appearance. Using a systematic literature search and  initial triage process, we focused on identifying patient-reported outcome  measures that could be used to evaluate changes in appearance concerns in  plexiform or cutaneous neurofibroma clinical trials in neurofibromatosis 1. Our  revised Patient-Reported Outcome Rating and Acceptance Tool for Endpoints then  was used to evaluate each published patient-reported outcome measures in five  domains, including (1) respondent characteristics, (2) content validity, (3)  scoring format and interpretability, (4) psychometric data, and (5) feasibility.  The highest-rated patient-reported outcome measures were then re-reviewed in a  side-by-side comparison to generate a final consensus recommendation. RESULTS: Eleven measures assessing appearance concerns were reviewed and rated;  no measures were explicitly designed to assess appearance concerns related to  neurofibromatosis 1. The FACE-Q Craniofacial Module-Appearance Distress scale  was the top-rated measure for potential use in neurofibromatosis 1 clinical  trials. Strengths of the measure included that it was rigorously developed,  included individuals with neurofibromatosis 1 in the validation sample, was  applicable to children and adults, covered item topics deemed important by  neurofibromatosis 1 patient representatives, exhibited good psychometric  properties, and was feasible for use in neurofibromatosis 1 trials. Limitations  included a lack of validation in older adults, no published information  regarding sensitivity to change in clinical trials, and limited availability in  languages other than English. CONCLUSION: The Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis  patient-reported outcome working group currently recommends the FACE-Q  Craniofacial Module Appearance Distress scale to evaluate patient-reported  changes in appearance concerns in clinical trials for neurofibromatosis  1-related plexiform or cutaneous neurofibromas. Additional research is needed to  validate this measure in people with neurofibromatosis 1, including older adults  and those with tumors in various body locations, and explore the effects of  nontumor manifestations on appearance concerns in people with neurofibromatosis  1 and schwannomatosis.

PURPOSE: To develop the PROMIS Pediatric Stigma (PPS) and Skin (PPS-Skin) by  constructing a common metric for measuring stigma in children with various  conditions, while capturing the unique features of each condition. METHODS: Data from 860 children, ages 8-17, with a diagnosis of epilepsy, pNF  (neurofibromatosis type 1 associated neurofibroma plexform), MD (muscular  dystrophy), cancer, or skin conditions recruited from three projects were  analyzed. Children with epilepsy, pNF and MD (sample-1) completed the original  18-item Neuro-QoL Stigma, while children with cancer and skin conditions (e.g.,  atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and genetic skin disorders; sample-2) completed a  16-item version and 6 additional skin related items. Exploratory factor analysis  (EFA) and confirmatory analysis (CFA) were used to evaluate unidimensionality of  24 stigma items. Differential item functioning (DIF) was used to evaluate  measurement equivalence on group, gender, age, and conditions. Item response  theory model (IRT) was used to construct the final measure. RESULTS: Sufficient unidimensionality was supported by both EFA and CFA. No  items showed significant DIF indicating stable measurement properties across  groups of comparison. All items fit the IRT model and were able to be calibrated  together to form the PPS which consists of 18 core items. The PPS-Skin (18 cores  items + 6 skin items) was developed by calibrating 6 skin items onto the common  metric as the PPS. CONCLUSIONS: We used IRT techniques to successfully develop the PPS and the  PPS-Skin, which share a common metric and account for unique and common concerns  related to chronic conditions.  © 2024.

RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) are peripheral nerve  tumors that occur in 25-50 % of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. PNs may  have complex, diffused, and irregular shapes. The objective of this work was to  develop a volumetric quantification method for PNs as clinical assessment is  currently based on unidimensional measurement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A semi-automatic segmentation technique based on mean  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) intensity thresholding (SSTMean) was developed  and compared to a similar and previously published technique based on minimum  image intensity thresholding (SSTMini). The performance (volume and computation  time) of the two techniques was compared to manual tracings of 15 tumors of  different locations, shapes, and sizes. Performance was also assessed using  different MRI sequences. Reproducibility was assessed by inter-observer  analysis. RESULTS: When compared to manual tracing, quantification performed with SSTMean  was not significantly different (mean difference: 1.2 %), while volumes computed  by SSTMini were significantly different (p < .0001, mean difference: 13.4 %).  Volumes quantified by SSTMean were also significantly different than the ones  assessed by SSTMini (p < .0001). Using SSTMean, volumes quantified with short TI  inversion recovery, T1-, and T2-weighted imaging were not significantly  different. Computation times used by SSTMean and SSTMini were significantly  lower than for manual segmentation (p < .0001). The highest difference measured  by two users was 8 cm3. CONCLUSION: Our method showed accuracy compared to a current gold standard  (manual tracing) and reproducibility between users. The refined segmentation  threshold and the possibility to define multiple regions-of-interest to initiate  segmentation may have contributed to its performance. The versatility and speed  of our method may prove useful to better monitor volumetric changes in lesions  of patients enrolled in clinical trials to assessing response to therapy.  © 2023 The Authors.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a disorder in which RAS is constitutively  activated due to the loss of the Ras-GTPase-activating activity of  neurofibromin. RAS must be prenylated (i.e., farnesylated or geranylgeranylated)  to traffic and function properly. Previous studies showed that the anti-growth  properties of farnesyl monophosphate prodrug farnesyltransferase inhibitors  (FTIs) on human NF1 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) cells are  potentiated by co-treatment with lovastatin. Unfortunately, such prodrug FTIs  have poor aqueous solubility. In this study, we synthesized a series of prodrug  FTI polyamidoamine generation 4 (PAMAM G4) dendrimers that compete with farnesyl  pyrophosphate for farnesyltransferase (Ftase) and assessed their effects on  human NF1 MPNST S462TY cells. The prodrug 3-tert-butylfarnesyl monophosphate  FTI-dendrimer (i.e., IG 2) exhibited improved aqueous solubility. Concentrations  of IG 2 and lovastatin (as low as 0.1 μM) having little to no effect when used  singularly synergistically suppressed cell proliferation, colony formation, and  induced N-RAS, RAP1A, and RAB5A deprenylation when used in combination.  Combinational treatment had no additive or synergistic effects on the  proliferation/viability of immortalized normal rat Schwann cells, primary rat  hepatocytes, or normal human mammary epithelial MCF10A cells. Combinational, but  not singular, in vivo treatment markedly suppressed the growth of S462TY  xenografts established in the sciatic nerves of immune-deficient mice. Hence,  prodrug farnesyl monophosphate FTIs can be rendered water-soluble by conjugation  to PAMAM G4 dendrimers and exhibit potent anti-tumor activity when combined with  clinically achievable statin concentrations.

Approximately a quarter of NF1 patients experience the development of plexiform  neurofibromas, potentially progressing into malignant peripheral nerve sheath  tumors (MPNST). FT895, an HDAC11 inhibitor, exhibits potent anti-tumor effects  on MPNST cells and enhances the cytotoxicity of cordycepin against MPNST. The  study aims to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying FT895's efficacy  against MPNST cells. Initially, our study unveiled that FT895 disrupts  mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Post-FT895 treatment, reactive oxygen  species (ROS) in MPNST notably increased, while mitochondrial DNA copy numbers  decreased significantly. Seahorse analysis indicated a considerable decrease in  basal, maximal, and ATP-production-coupled respiration following FT895  treatment. Immunostaining highlighted FT895's role in promoting mitochondrial  aggregation without triggering mitophagy, possibly due to reduced levels of  XBP1, Parkin, and PINK1 proteins. Moreover, the study using CHIP-qPCR analysis  revealed a significant reduction in the copy numbers of promoters of the  MPV17L2, POLG, TFAM, PINK1, and Parkin genes. The RNA-seq analysis underscored  the prominent role of the HIF-1α signaling pathway post-FT895 treatment,  aligning with the observed impairment in mitochondrial respiration. In summary,  the study pioneers the revelation that FT895 induces mitochondrial respiratory  damage in MPNST cells.

Electronic address: Matt.Steensma@vai.org.  OBJECTIVE: NF1 is a tumor suppressor gene and its protein product,  neurofibromin, is a negative regulator of the RAS pathway. NF1 is one of the top  driver mutations in sporadic breast cancer such that 27 % of breast cancers  exhibit damaging NF1 alterations. NF1 loss-of-function is a frequent event in  the genomic evolution of estrogen receptor (ER)+ breast cancer metastasis and  endocrine resistance. Individuals with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF) - a  disorder caused by germline NF1 mutations - have an increased risk of dying from  breast cancer [1-4]. NF-related breast cancers are associated with decreased  overall survival compared to sporadic breast cancer. Despite numerous studies  interrogating the role of RAS mutations in tumor metabolism, no study has  comprehensively profiled the NF1-deficient breast cancer metabolome to define  patterns of energetic and metabolic reprogramming. The goals of this  investigation were (1) to define the role of NF1 deficiency in estrogen  receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer metabolic reprogramming and (2) to  identify potential targeted pathway and metabolic inhibitor combination  therapies for NF1-deficient ER + breast cancer. METHODS: We employed two ER+ NF1-deficient breast cancer models: (1) an  NF1-deficient MCF7 breast cancer cell line to model sporadic breast cancer, and  (2) three distinct, Nf1-deficient rat models to model NF-related breast cancer  [1]. IncuCyte proliferation analysis was used to measure the effect of NF1  deficiency on cell proliferation and drug response. Protein quantity was  assessed by Western Blot analysis. We then used RNAseq to investigate the  transcriptional effect of NF1 deficiency on global and metabolism-related  transcription. We measured cellular energetics using Agilent Seahorse XF-96  Glyco Stress Test and Mito Stress Test assays. We performed stable isotope  labeling and measured [U-13C]-glucose and [U-13C]-glutamine metabolite  incorporation and measured total metabolite pools using mass spectrometry.  Lastly, we used a Bliss synergy model to investigate NF1-driven changes in  targeted and metabolic inhibitor synergy. RESULTS: Our results revealed that NF1 deficiency enhanced cell proliferation,  altered neurofibromin expression, and increased RAS and PI3K/AKT pathway  signaling while constraining oxidative ATP production and restricting energetic  flexibility. Neurofibromin deficiency also increased glutamine influx into TCA  intermediates and dramatically increased lipid pools, especially triglycerides  (TG). Lastly, NF1 deficiency alters the synergy between metabolic inhibitors and  traditional targeted inhibitors. This includes increased synergy with inhibitors  targeting glycolysis, glutamine metabolism, mitochondrial fatty acid transport,  and TG synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: NF1 deficiency drives metabolic reprogramming in ER+ breast cancer.  This reprogramming is characterized by oxidative ATP constraints, glutamine TCA  influx, and lipid pool expansion, and these metabolic changes introduce novel  metabolic-to-targeted inhibitor synergies.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 2-related schwannomatosis is a genetic  disease characterized by the development of bilateral vestibular schwannomas,  ependymomas, meningiomas, and cataracts. Mild to profound hearing loss and  tinnitus are common symptoms reported by individuals with neurofibromatosis type  2. While tinnitus is known to have a significant and negative impact on the  quality of life of individuals from the general population, the impact on  individuals with neurofibromatosis type 2 is unknown. Consensus regarding the  selection of suitable patient-reported outcome measures for assessment could  advance further research into tinnitus in neurofibromatosis type 2 patients. The  purpose of this work is to achieve a consensus recommendation by the Response  Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis International Collaboration  for patient-reported outcome measures used to evaluate quality of life in the  domain of tinnitus for neurofibromatosis type 2 clinical trials. METHODS: The Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis  Patient-Reported Outcomes Communication Subgroup systematically evaluated  patient-reported outcome measures of quality of life in the domain of tinnitus  for individuals with neurofibromatosis type 2 using previously published  Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis rating procedures.  Of the 19 identified patient-reported outcome measures, 3 measures were excluded  because they were not validated as an outcome measure or could not have been  used as a single outcome measure for a clinical trial. Sixteen published  patient-reported outcome measures for the domain of tinnitus were scored and  compared on their participant characteristics, item content, psychometric  properties, and feasibility for use in clinical trials. RESULTS: The Tinnitus Functional Index was identified as the most highly rated  measure for the assessment of tinnitus in populations with neurofibromatosis  type 2, due to strengths in the areas of item content, psychometric properties,  feasibility, and available scores. DISCUSSION: Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis  currently recommends the Tinnitus Functional Index for the assessment of  tinnitus in neurofibromatosis type 2 clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: Our goal was to develop a 3D tumor slice model, replicating the  individual tumor microenvironment and for individual pharmaceutical testing in  vestibular schwannomas with and without relation to NF2. METHODS: Tissue samples from 16 VS patients (14 sporadic, 2 NF2-related) were  prospectively analyzed. Slices of 350 µm thickness were cultured in vitro, and  the 3D tumor slice model underwent thorough evaluation for culturing time,  microenvironment characteristics, morphology, apoptosis, and proliferation  rates. Common drugs - Lapatinib (10 µM), Nilotinib (20 µM), and Bevacizumab  (10 µg/ml) - known for their responses in VS were used for treatment. Treatment  responses were assessed using CC3 as an apoptosis marker and Ki67 as a  proliferation marker. Standard 2D cell culture models of the same tumors served  as controls. RESULTS: The 3D tumor slice model accurately mimicked VS ex vivo, maintaining  stability for three months. Cell count within the model was approximately  tenfold higher than in standard cell culture, and the tumor microenvironment  remained stable for 46 days. Pharmacological testing was feasible for up to  three weeks, revealing interindividual differences in treatment response to  Lapatinib and intraindividual variability in response to Lapatinib and  Nilotinib. The observed effects were less pronounced in tumor slices than in  standard cell culture, indicating the model's proximity to in vivo tumor biology  and enhanced realism. Bevacizumab had limited impact in both models. CONCLUSION: This study introduces a 3D tumor slice model for sporadic and  NF2-related VS, demonstrating stability for up to 3 months, replication of the  schwannoma microenvironment, and utility for individualized pharmacological  testing.

(#)Contributed equally  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common genetic disorders  caused by heterozygous germline NF1 mutations. NF1 affects many systems,  including the skeletal system. To date, no curative therapies are available for  skeletal manifestations such as scoliosis and tibial dysplasia, mainly due to  the lack of knowledge about the mechanisms that underlie this process. By using  CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in human-induced pluripotent stem cells  (hiPSCs) to minimize the variability due to genetic background and epigenetic  factors, we generated isogenic heterozygous and homozygous NF1-deficient hiPSC  lines to investigate the consequences of neurofibromin inactivation on  osteoblastic differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that loss of one or both  copies of NF1 does not alter the potential of isogenic hiPSCs to differentiate  into mesenchymal stem cells (hiPSC-MSCs). However, NF1 (+/-) and NF1 (-/-)  hiPSC-MSCs show a defect in osteogenic differentiation and mineralization. In  addition, we show that a mono-allelic deletion in NF1 in an isogenic context is  sufficient to impair cell differentiation into osteoblasts. Overall, this study  highlights the relevance of generating isogenic lines, which may help in  genotype-phenotype correlation and provide a human cellular model to understand  the molecular mechanisms underlying NF1 and, thus, discover new therapeutic  strategies.

BACKGROUND: Half of the patients with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) develop one  or more tumours called plexiform neurofibromas, which can have a significant  impact on Quality of Life (QoL). The PlexiQoL questionnaire is a  disease-specific QoL measure for adults with NF1-associated plexiform  neurofibromas. The aim of this study was to adapt and validate a Dutch version  of the PlexiQoL for the Netherlands. METHODS: The PlexiQoL was translated using the dual-panel methodology, followed  by cognitive debriefing interviews to assess face and content validity. The  psychometric properties were evaluated by administering the questionnaire on two  separate occasions to a sample of adults with NF1 and plexiform neurofibromas.  Feasibility was evaluated by the presence of floor/ceiling effects. Reliability  was assessed by evaluating Cronbach's alpha coefficient and test-retest  reliability, using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. Mann-Whitney U  tests were used to check for known group validity. The Nottingham Health Profile  (NHP) questionnaire was used as comparator questionnaire to evaluate convergent  validity. RESULTS: The translation and cognitive debriefing interviews resulted in a Dutch  version of the PlexiQoL that reflected the original concept and underlying  semantic meanings of the UK English version. Forty participants completed the  validation survey. The Dutch PlexiQoL demonstrated excellent internal  consistency (Cronbach's α 0.825) and test-retest reliability (Spearman  correlation coefficient 0.928). The questionnaire detected differences in  PlexiQoL scores between participants based on self-reported general health and  disease severity. Convergent validity was confirmed for relevant NHP  subsections. CONCLUSIONS: The Dutch PlexiQoL demonstrated excellent psychometric properties  and can be reliably used to measure plexiform neurofibroma-related QoL in adults  with NF1 in the Netherlands.  © 2024.

In Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), peripheral nerve sheaths tumors are common,  with cutaneous neurofibromas resulting in significant aesthetic, painful and  functional problems requiring surgical removal. To date, determination of  adequate surgical resection margins-complete tumor removal while attempting to  preserve viable tissue-remains largely subjective. Thus, residual tumor  extension beyond surgical margins or recurrence of the disease may frequently be  observed. Here, we introduce Shifted-Excitation Raman Spectroscopy in  combination with deep neural networks for the future perspective of objective,  real-time diagnosis, and guided surgical ablation. The obtained results are  validated through established histological methods. In this study, we evaluated  the discrimination between cutaneous neurofibroma (n = 9) and adjacent  physiological tissues (n = 25) in 34 surgical pathological specimens ex vivo at  a total of 82 distinct measurement loci. Based on a convolutional neural network  (U-Net), the mean raw Raman spectra (n = 8,200) were processed and refined, and  afterwards the spectral peaks were assigned to their respective molecular  origin. Principal component and linear discriminant analysis was used to  discriminate cutaneous neurofibromas from physiological tissues with a  sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 97.3%, and overall classification accuracy  of 97.6%. The results enable the presented optical, non-invasive technique in  combination with artificial intelligence as a promising candidate to ameliorate  both, diagnosis and treatment of patients affected by cutaneous neurofibroma and  NF1.

BACKGROUND: Almost all patients with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) develop  cutaneous neurofibroma (cNF), benign dermal tumours that have a large impact on  the patient's Quality of Life (QoL). The French cNF-Skindex is the first  questionnaire to specifically assess cNF-related QoL in patients with NF1. We  aimed to adapt and validate a Dutch version of the cNF-Skindex. METHODS: The questionnaire was translated using forward and backwards  translation, and subsequently administered to a sample of 59 patients on two  separate occasions. Feasibility was evaluated by the presence of floor/ceiling  effects. Reliability was assessed by evaluating internal consistency and  test-retest reliability, by calculating Cronbach's alpha and Spearman's rank  correlation coefficients. The EQ-5D-5L and SF-36 were used to evaluate  convergent validity, using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. An  exploratory factor analysis was performed to study the data's internal  structure. Multivariable linear regression was used to model the relationship  between patient characteristics and the cNF-Skindex. RESULTS: The Dutch cNF-Skindex demonstrated excellent feasibility and  reliability (Cronbach's alpha 0.96, test-retest correlation coefficient 0.88).  Convergent validity was confirmed for the EQ-5D-5L and relevant SF-36 scales.  All items and subdomains from the original questionnaire were confirmed  following exploratory factor analysis. The patient characteristics included in  the multivariable linear regression were not significantly associated with the  cNF-Skindex score. CONCLUSIONS: The Dutch cNF-Skindex displayed excellent psychometric properties,  enabling use in the Netherlands.  © 2024. The Author(s).

NF1 patients  frequently develop a benign tumor in peripheral nerve plexuses called plexiform  neurofibroma. In the past two decades, tissue-specific Nf1 knockout mouse models  were developed using commercially available tissue-specific Cre recombinase and  the Nf1 flox mice to mimic neurofibroma development. However, these models  develop para-spinal neurofibroma, recapitulating a rare type of neurofibroma  found in NF1 patients. The NPcis mouse model developed a malignant version of  neurofibroma called malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) within 3 to  6 months but intriguingly without apparent benign precursor lesion. Here, we  revisited the NPcis model and discovered that about 20% display clinical signs  similar to Nf1 tissue-specific knockout mice models. However, a systematic  histological analysis could not explain the clinical signs we observed although  we noticed lesions reminiscent of a neurofibroma in a peripheral nerve, a  cutaneous neurofibroma, and para-spinal neurofibroma on rare occasions in NPcis  mice. We also observed that 10% of the mice developed a malignant peripheral  nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) spontaneously, coinciding with their earring tag  identification. Strikingly, half of the sciatic nerves from NPcis mice developed  plexiform neurofibroma within 1-6 months when intentionally injured. Thus, we  provided a procedure to turn the widely used NPcis sarcoma model into a model  recapitulating plexiform neurofibroma.  Copyright: © 2024 Plante et al.

Plexiform  neurofibromas (PNFs) are benign tumors commonly formed in patients with NF1.  PNFs have a high incidence of developing into malignant peripheral nerve sheath  tumors (MPNSTs) with a 5-year survival rate of only 30%. Therefore, the accurate  diagnosis and differentiation of MPNSTs from benign PNFs are critical to patient  management. We studied a fluorine-18 labeled tryptophan positron emission  tomography (PET) radiotracer, 1-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tryptophan  (L-[18F]FETrp), to detect NF1-associated tumors in an animal model. An ex vivo  biodistribution study of L-[18F]FETrp showed a similar tracer distribution and  kinetics between the wild-type and triple mutant mice with the highest uptake in  the pancreas. Bone uptake was stable. Brain uptake was low during the 90-min  uptake period. Static PET imaging at 60 min post-injection showed L-[18F]FETrp  had a comparable tumor uptake with [1⁸F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). However,  L-[18F]FETrp showed a significantly higher tumor-to-brain ratio than FDG (n = 4,  p < 0.05). Sixty-minute-long dynamic PET scans using the two radiotracers showed  similar kidney, liver, and lung kinetics. A dysregulated tryptophan metabolism  in NF1 mice was further confirmed using immunohistostaining. L-[18F]FETrp is  warranted to further investigate differentiating malignant NF1 tumors from  benign PNFs. The study may reveal the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway as a  therapeutic target for treating NF1.

BACKGROUND: Optic pathway glioma (OPG) is a feared complication to  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) since it can cause visual impairment in young  children. The main goal of screening is to detect symptomatic OPGs that require  treatment. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been suggested as a tool for  detection of neuro-retinal damage. AIMS: To investigate whether the ganglion cell layer assessed by OCT is a  reliable measure to identify and detect relapses of symptomatic OPGs in children  with NF1. METHODS: Children (3-6 years) with NF1, with and without known OPG and children  with sporadic OPG (S-OPG) resident in the Stockholm area, were invited and  followed in a prospective study during a three-year period. Brain magnetic  resonance tomography (MRI) had been performed in children with symptoms of OPG.  Outcome measures were VA in logMAR, visual field index (VFI), average  thicknesses of the ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL), and  peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL). RESULTS: There were 25 children with MRI-verified OPG and 52 with NF1 without  symptomatic OPG. Eyes from NF1 patients without symptoms of OPG showed  significantly better results in all four analyzed parameters compared to eyes  with NF1-associated OPG. Mean GC-IPL measurements seemed stable and reliable,  significantly correlated to pRNFL (correlation coefficient (r) = 0.662,  confidence interval (CI) = .507 to .773 p<0.001), VA (r = -0.661, CI = -7.45 to  -.551, p<0.001) and VFI (r = 0.644, CI = .452 to .774, p<0.001). GC-IPL  measurements were easy to obtain and acquired at considerably younger age than  pRNFL (5.6±1.5 vs 6.8±1.3; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The mean GC-IPL thickness could distinguish well between eyes with  OPG and eyes without symptomatic OPG in children with NF1. As thinning of GC-IPL  assessed with OCT could indicate underlying OPG, it should be included in the  screening protocol of children with questionable VA measurements and in  particular in children with NF1.

Neurofibromatosis type 1, a genetic disorder caused by pathogenic germline  variations in NF1, predisposes individuals to the development of tumors,  including cutaneous and plexiform neurofibromas (CNs and PNs), optic gliomas,  astrocytomas, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, high-grade gliomas and malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), which are chemotherapy- and  radiation-resistant sarcomas with poor survival. Loss of NF1 also occurs in  sporadic tumors, such as glioblastoma (GBM), melanoma, breast, ovarian and lung  cancers. We performed a high-throughput screen for compounds that were synthetic  lethal with NF1 loss, which identified several leads, including the small  molecule Y102. Treatment of cells with Y102 perturbed autophagy, mitophagy and  lysosome positioning in NF1-deficient cells. A dual proteomics approach  identified BLOC-one-related complex (BORC), which is required for lysosome  positioning and trafficking, as a potential target of Y102. Knockdown of a BORC  subunit using siRNA recapitulated the phenotypes observed with Y102 treatment.  Our findings demonstrate that BORC might be a promising therapeutic target for  NF1-deficient tumors.  © 2024. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

Plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) occur in about a half of neurofibromatosis type 1  (NF1) patients and have garnered significant research attention due to their  capacity for growth and potential for malignant transformation. NF1 plexiform  neurofibroma (pNF1) is a complex tumor composed of Schwann cell-derived tumor  cells (Nf1-/-) and the tumor microenvironment (TME). Although it has been widely  demonstrated that the TME is involved in the formation of neurofibromas, little  is known about the effects of the TME on the subsequent progression of human  pNF1. Elucidating the molecular interactions between tumor cells and the TME may  provide new therapeutic targets to reduce the progression of pNF1. In the  present study, we focused on the contributions of fibroblasts, the most abundant  cell types in the TME, to the growth of pNF1. To simulate the TME, we used a  three-dimensional (3D) coculture model of immortalized pNF1 tumor cells (Nf1-/-)  and primary fibroblasts (Nf1+/-) derived from pNF1 patients. We performed  live-cell imaging of 3D/4D (3D in real-time) cultures through confocal  microscopy followed by 3D quantitative analyses using advanced imaging software.  The growth of pNF1 spheroids in 3D cocultures with fibroblasts was significantly  greater than that of pNF1 spheroids in 3D monocultures. An increase in the  growth of pNF1 spheroids also occurred when they were cultured with conditioned  media (CM) from fibroblasts. Moreover, fibroblast-derived CM increased the  invasive outgrowth and further local invasion of pNF1 spheroids. Interestingly,  when small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) were depleted from the  fibroblast-derived CM, the stimulation of the growth of pNF1 spheroids was lost.  Our results suggest that fibroblast-derived sEVs are a therapeutic target for  reducing the growth of pNF1.

Electronic address: allan.jacobson@umassmed.edu.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a human genetic disorder caused by variants in  the NF1 gene. Plexiform neurofibromas, one of many NF1 manifestations, are  benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors occurring in up to 50% of NF1 patients. A  substantial fraction of NF1 pathogenetic variants are nonsense mutations, which  result in the synthesis of truncated non-functional NF1 protein (neurofibromin).  To date, no therapeutics have restored neurofibromin expression or addressed the  consequences of this protein's absence in NF1 nonsense mutation patients, but  nonsense suppression is a potential approach to the problem. Ataluren is a small  molecule drug that has been shown to stimulate functional nonsense codon  readthrough in several models of nonsense mutation diseases, as well as in  Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients. To test ataluren's potential applicability  in nonsense mutation NF1 patients, we evaluated its therapeutic effects using  three treatment regimens in a previously established NF1 patient-derived  (c.2041C > T; p.Arg681X) nonsense mutation mouse model. Collectively, our  experiments indicate that: i) ataluren appeared to slow the growth of  neurofibromas and alleviate some paralysis phenotypes, ii) female Nf1-nonsense  mutation mice manifested more severe paralysis and neurofibroma phenotypes than  male mice, iii) ataluren doses with apparent effectiveness were lower in female  mice than in male mice, and iv) age factors also influenced ataluren's  effectiveness.

Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a complex genetic disorder characterized by  the development of benign neurofibromas, which can cause significant morbidity  in affected individuals. While the molecular mechanisms underlying NF1  pathogenesis have been extensively studied, the development of effective  therapeutic strategies remains a challenge. This paper presents the development  and validation of a novel biomaterial testing model to enhance our understanding  of NF1 pathophysiology, disease mechanisms and evaluate potential therapeutic  interventions. Our long-term goal is to develop an invitro model of NF1 to  evaluate drug targets. We have developed an in vitro system to test the cellular  behavior of NF1 patient derived cells on electroconductive aligned nanofibrous  biomaterials with electrical stimulatory cues. We hypothesized that cells  cultured on electroconductive biomaterial will undergo morphological changes and  variations in cell proliferation that could be further enhanced with the  combination of exogenous electrical stimulation (ES). In this study, we  developed electrospun Hyaluronic Acid-Carbon Nanotube (HA-CNT) nanofiber  scaffolds to mimic the axon's topographical and bioelectrical cues that  influence neurofibroma growth and development. The cellular behavior was  qualitatively and quantitively analyzed through immunofluorescent stains, Alamar  blue assays and ELISA assays. Schwann cells from NF1 patients appear to have  lost their ability to respond to electrical stimulation in the development and  regeneration range, which was seen through changes in morphology, proliferation  and NGF release. Without stimulation, the conductive material enhances NF1 SC  behavior. Wild-type SC respond to electrical stimulation with increased cell  proliferation and NGF release. Using this system, we can better understand the  interaction between axons and SC that lead to tumor formation, homeostasis and  regeneration.  Copyright: © 2024 Senanayake et al.

BACKGROUND: Cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs) are a major cause of disfigurement in  patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1). However, clinical trials  investigating cNF treatments lack standardised outcome measures to objectively  evaluate changes in cNF size and appearance. 3D imaging has been proposed as an  objective standardised outcome measure however various systems exist with  different features that affect useability in clinical settings. The aim of this  study was to compare the accuracy, precision, feasibility, reliability and  accessibility of three imaging systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared the Vectra-H1, LifeViz-Micro and  Cherry-Imaging systems. A total of 58 cNFs from 13 participants with NF1 were  selected for imaging and analysis. The primary endpoint was accuracy as measured  by comparison of measurements between imaging systems. Secondary endpoints  included reliability between two operators, precision as measured with the  average coefficient of variation, feasibility as determined by time to capture  and analyse an image and accessibility as determined by cost. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in accuracy between the three  devices for length or surface area measurements (p > 0.05), and reliability and  precision were similar. Volume measurements demonstrated the most variability  compared to other measurements; LifeViz-Micro demonstrated the least measurement  variability for surface area and image capture and analysis were fastest with  LifeViz-Micro. LifeViz-Micro was better for imaging smaller number of cNFs  (1-3), Vectra-H1 better for larger areas and Cherry for uneven surfaces. CONCLUSIONS: All systems demonstrated excellent reliability but possess distinct  advantages and limitations. Surface area is the most consistent and reliable  parameter for measuring cNF size in clinical trials.  © 2024 The Author(s). Skin Research and Technology published by John Wiley &  Sons Ltd.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a prevalent autosomal dominant disorder caused  by mutations in the NF1 gene, leading to multisystem disorders. Given the  critical role of cysteine residues in protein stability and function, we aimed  to identify key NF1 mutations affecting cysteine residues that significantly  contribute to neurofibromatosis pathology. To identify the most critical  mutations in the NF1 gene that contribute to the pathology of neurofibromatosis,  we employed a sophisticated computational pipeline specifically designed to  detect significant mutations affecting the NF1 gene. Our approach involved an  exhaustive search of databases such as the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD),  UniProt, and ClinVar for information on missense mutations associated with NF1.  Our search yielded a total of 204 unique cysteine missense mutations. We then  employed in silico prediction tools, including PredictSNP, iStable, and Align  GVGD, to assess the impact of these mutations. Among the mutations, C379R,  R1000C, and C1016Y stood out due to their deleterious effects on the biophysical  properties of the neurofibromin protein, significantly destabilizing its  structure. These mutations were subjected to further phenotyping analysis using  SNPeffect 4.0, which predicted disturbances in the protein's chaperone binding  sites and overall structural stability. Furthermore, to directly visualize the  impact of these mutations on protein structure, we utilized AlphaFold3 to  simulate both the wild-type and mutant NF1 structures, revealing the significant  effects of the R1000C mutation on the protein's conformation. In conclusion, the  identification of these mutations can play a pivotal role in advancing the field  of precision medicine and aid in the development of effective drugs for  associated diseases.  © 2024.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder  characterized by the predisposition to develop tumors such as malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) which represents the primary cause of  death for NF1-affected patients. Regardless of the high incidence and mortality,  the molecular mechanisms underneath MPNST growth and metastatic progression  remain poorly understood. In this proof-of-concept study, we performed somatic  whole-exome sequencing (WES) to profile the genomic alterations in four samples  from a patient with NF1-associated MPNST, consisting of a benign plexiform  neurofibroma, a primary MPNST, and metastases from lung and skin tissues. By  comparing genomic patterns, we identified a high level of variability across  samples with distinctive genetic changes which allow for the definition of  profiles of the early phase with respect to the late metastatic stages.  Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants were abundant in the primary tumor,  whereas the metastatic samples exhibited a high level of copy-number variations  (CNVs), highlighting a possible genomic instability in the late phases. The most  known MPNST-related genes, such as TP53 and SUZ12, were identified in CNVs  observed within the primary tumor. Pathway analysis of altered early genes in  MPNST pointed to a potential role in cell motility, division and metabolism.  Moreover, we employed survival analysis with the TCGA sarcoma genomic dataset on  262 affected patients, in order to corroborate the predictive significance of  the identified early and metastatic MPNST driver genes. Specifically, the  expression changes related to the mutated genes, such as in RBMX, PNPLA6 and  AGAP2, were associated with reduced patient survival, distinguishing them as  potential prognostic biomarkers. This study underlines the relevance of  integrating genomic results with clinical information for early diagnosis and  prognostic understanding of tumor aggressiveness.

Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF-2) is a dominantly inherited genetic disorder that  results from variants in the tumor suppressor gene, neurofibromin 2 (NF2). Here,  we report the generation of a conditional zebrafish model of neurofibromatosis  established by inducible genetic knockout of nf2a/b, the zebrafish homologs of  human NF2. Analysis of nf2a and nf2b expression revealed ubiquitous expression  of nf2b in the early embryo, with overlapping expression in the neural crest and  its derivatives and in the cranial mesenchyme. In contrast, nf2a displayed lower  expression levels. Induction of nf2a/b knockout at early stages increased the  proliferation of larval Schwann cells and meningeal fibroblasts. Subsequently,  in adult zebrafish, nf2a/b knockout triggered the development of a spectrum of  tumors, including vestibular Schwannomas, spinal Schwannomas, meningiomas and  retinal hamartomas, mirroring the tumor manifestations observed in patients with  NF-2. Collectively, these findings highlight the generation of a novel zebrafish  model that mimics the complexities of the human NF-2 disorder. Consequently,  this model holds significant potential for facilitating therapeutic screening  and elucidating key driver genes implicated in NF-2 onset.  © 2024.

BACKGROUND: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) can arise from  atypical neurofibromas (ANF). Loss of the polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) is  a common event. Previous studies on PRC2-regulated genes in MPNST used genetic  add-back experiments in highly aneuploid MPNST cell lines which may miss  PRC2-regulated genes in NF1-mutant ANF-like precursor cells. A set of  PRC2-regulated genes in human Schwann cells (SCs) has not been defined. We  hypothesized that PRC2 loss has direct and indirect effects on gene expression  resulting in MPNST, so we sought to identify PRC2-regulated genes in  immortalized human Schwann cells (iHSCs). METHODS: We engineered NF1-deficient iHSCs with loss of function SUZ12 or EED  mutations. RNA sequencing revealed 1327 differentially expressed genes to define  PRC2-regulated genes. To investigate MPNST pathogenesis, we compared genes in  iHSCs to consistent gene expression differences between ANF and MPNSTs.  Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing was used to further define targets.  Methylome and proteomic analyses were performed to further identify enriched  pathways. RESULTS: We identified potential PRC2-regulated drivers of MPNST progression.  Pathway analysis indicates many upregulated cancer-related pathways. We found  transcriptional evidence for activated Notch and Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling  in PRC2-deficient iHSCs. Functional studies confirm that Notch signaling is  active in MPNST cell lines, patient-derived xenografts, and transient cell  models of PRC2 deficiency. A combination of MEK and γ-secretase inhibition shows  synergy in MPNST cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: We identified PRC2-regulated genes and potential drivers of MPNSTs.  Our findings support the Notch pathway as a druggable target in MPNSTs. Our  identification of PRC2-regulated genes and pathways could result in more novel  therapeutic approaches.  © The Author(s) 2024.

Based on clinical phenotypes, exome sequencing for small-nucleotide  variations or array-based methods for copy-number variations (CNVs) are commonly  offered to identify the underlying causative genetic variants. In this study, we  investigated whether data from a standard ES test could be used to additionally  identify pathogenic CNVs and increase diagnostic yield. METHODS: Prospectively, 134 patients presenting with a skin condition suspected  of being genetic in origin were offered the next-generation variant exon  screening (ngVES) test. Sequencing data were analyzed for both single-nucleotide  variants and CNVs using established algorithms. RESULTS: The positive detection rate for skin diseases using ngVES was 66%  (88/134) with the most common diagnoses being neurofibromatosis type1 (n = 48)  and tuberous sclerosis type2 (n = 12). The diagnostic increased yield from 58%  to 66% was the result of additional detection of pathogenic CNVs. Each of the 9  CNVs were verified by independent genetic tests. CONCLUSION: The advances in the ngVES bioinformatics pipeline are proofs of  concept, which improved identification of genetic variants associated with skin  disease. Simultaneous single-nucleotide variants/INDEL and CNV detection by this  approach demonstrates ngVES potential as a first-tier screen for any suspected  genetic disease.  © 2024 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American College of Medical  Genetics and Genomics.

To compare 1D (linear) tumor volume calculations and classification systems with  3D-segmented volumetric analysis (SVA), focusing specifically on their  effectiveness in the evaluation and management of NF2-associated vestibular  schwannomas (VS). VS were clinically followed every 6 months with cranial,  thin-sliced (< 3 mm) MRI. We retrospectively reviewed and used T1-weighted  post-contrast enhanced (gadolinium) images for both SVA and linear measurements.  3D-SVA was performed manually or combined with semiautomated segmentation by  using axial planes. The maximum linear dimensions (MLD) were determined in three  dimensions (anteroposterior, transverse, and craniocaudal planes) using axial  and coronal planes. The MLD was cubed (MLD3), and orthogonal analysis (OA) was  derived to establish comparability with the SVA. The Hannover and Koos  classification was used to depict the size ratio in each MRI and tumor. A linear  regression model was performed to compare 1D/classification systems to SVA, and  the percentage deviation change of MLD3 and OA to SVA was established using a  one-way multivariate variance analysis. 2586 SVA and 10344 linear measurements  were performed in a cohort of 149 NF2 patients and 292 associated VS. All  measurement techniques (MLD3, OA, KOOS, and Hannover) significantly (and  strongly, r2 > 0.5) correlated with SVA (p < 0.001). The OA showed an even  stronger positive correlation than the MLD3 to SVA. Smaller classified tumors  (T1/T2, K1/K2) exhibited a low-moderate positive correlation (r2 = 0.23-0.44)  compared to medium-sized (T3, K2/3) and large tumors (T4, K4; r2 = 0.54-0.76).  Pre- and postoperative MLD3 and OA statistically significantly predict SVA  (p < 0.001), but the postoperative correlation was weaker, particularly for MLD3  to SVA values. All analyses showed a large scatter range. In the percentage  deviation analysis of MLD3 and OA from SVA, small tumors (K1/K2, T1/T2) were  overestimated. Compared to the SVA, the MLD3 and especially the OA are a  time-saving alternative for monitoring the tumor volume of NF2-associated VS.  However, the scatter range in small/surgically reduced tumors is enormous. For  this reason, they are not recommended for monitoring off-label therapy with  Bevacizumab or for treatment decisions depending on a precise assessment of  tumor volume and growth. Developing deep learning-based volume determinations in  the future is essential to reduce SVA's time intensity.  © 2025. The Author(s).

OBJECTIVE: Dimensionality reduction techniques aim to enhance the performance of  machine learning (ML) models by reducing noise and mitigating overfitting. We  sought to compare the effect of different dimensionality reduction methods for  comorbidity features extracted from electronic health records (EHRs) on the  performance of ML models for predicting the development of various  sub-phenotypes in children with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). MATERIALS AND METHODS: EHR-derived data from pediatric subjects with a confirmed  clinical diagnosis of NF1 were used to create 10 unique comorbidities  code-derived feature sets by incorporating dimensionality reduction techniques  using raw International Classification of Diseases codes, Clinical  Classifications Software Refined, and Phecode mapping schemes. We compared the  performance of logistic regression, XGBoost, and random forest models utilizing  each feature set. RESULTS: XGBoost-based predictive models were most successful at predicting NF1  sub-phenotypes. Overall, features based on domain knowledge-informed mapping  schema performed better than unsupervised feature reduction methods. High-level  features exhibited the worst performance across models and outcomes, suggesting  excessive information loss with over-aggregation of features. DISCUSSION: Model performance is significantly impacted by dimensionality  reduction techniques and varies by specific ML algorithm and outcome being  predicted. Automated methods using existing knowledge and ontology databases can  effectively aggregate features extracted from EHRs. CONCLUSION: Dimensionality reduction through feature aggregation can enhance the  performance of ML models, particularly in high-dimensional datasets with small  sample sizes, commonly found in EHRs health applications. However, if not  carefully optimized, it can lead to information loss and data  oversimplification, potentially adversely affecting model performance.  © The Author(s) 2025.

(#)Contributed equally  Deep-learning models have shown promise in differentiating between benign and  malignant lesions. Previous studies have primarily focused on specific  anatomical regions, overlooking tumors occurring throughout the body with highly  heterogeneous whole-body backgrounds. Using neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) as an  example, this study developed highly accurate MRI-based deep-learning models for  the early automated screening of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors  (MPNSTs) against complex whole-body background. In a Chinese seven-center  cohort, data from 347 subjects were analyzed. Our one-step model incorporated  normal tissue/organ labels to provide contextual information, offering a  solution for tumors with complex backgrounds. To address privacy concerns, we  utilized a lightweight deep neural network suitable for hospital deployment. The  final model achieved an accuracy of 85.71% for MPNST diagnosis in the validation  cohort and 84.75% accuracy in the independent test set, outperforming another  classic two-step model. This success suggests potential for AI models in  screening other whole-body primary/metastatic tumors.  © 2025. The Author(s).

For paediatric patients suffering from neurofibromatosis, Selumetinib (SEL) is  the only approved drug. Here an original ecofriendly and high pace method is  introduced using 96- microwell spectrophotometric assay (MW-SPA) to measure SEL  content in bulk and commercial pharmaceutical formulation (Koselugo® capsules).  This assay was relied on in-microwell formation of a coloured charge transfer  complex (CTC) upon interaction of SEL with  2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ). The complex was fully  characterized by spectrophotometric and computational studies. The CTC exhibited  an absorbance maximum (λmax) at 440 nm. The ease of reaction occurrence, complex  stability and its high absorptivity were proved by measuring its association  constant (0.63 × 102 L/ mol), standard free energy change (-10.31 KJ/mol), molar  absorptivity (ε) (3.78 × 103 L/mol/cm), and the SEL: DDQ stoichiometric ratio  (1:1). Establishments of the optimum values of the applied conditions in 96-well  assay plate were refined regarding DDQ concentration, reaction time,  temperature, and solvents. Validation of the assay was according to the ICH  guidelines. The assay was linear in SEL' concentrations ranged from 10 to  200 µg/well, with limits of detection and quantitation of 4.1 and 12.5 µg/well,  respectively. Then, the assay was efficaciously adapted to accurately and  precisely determine SEL content in bulk form and Koselugo® capsules. The assay  environmental safety was documented by three different comprehensive metric  tools. Additionally, assessment of the assay's rate demonstrated its high  throughput, enabling the processing of large number of samples in pharmaceutical  quality control laboratories. The successful development of this assay provides  a valuable fast and green analytical tool for ensuring the quality control of  SEL's bulk form and capsules.  © 2024. The Author(s).

In efforts to evaluate potential biomarkers and drug targets for  Neurofibromatosis Type I (NF1) we utilized affinity mass spectrometry and global  proteomics to investigate how variation within and loss of NF1 affect  immortalized human Schwann cells. We used Strep tagged mNf1 cDNAs (both wild  type (WT) and variant) to affinity purity NF1 Protein-Protein interactors (PPIs)  from the Schwann cells. We were able to identify 98 PPIs and show that some of  these PPIs bind differentially to variant proteins. Next, we evaluated global  proteomes. We identified over 1900 proteins in immortalized human Schwann cells  both with and without NF1 expression. We identified 148 proteins with  differential expression levels based on genotype. Following Ingenuity Pathway  analysis (IPA) we found multiple pathways were altered including decreases in  ""oxidative phosphorylation,"" increases in ""mitochondrial dysfunction"", and  ""glycolysis"", as well as changes in ""Myelination Signaling Pathway."" When we  evaluated the proteome of NF1 null cells stably transfected with tagged mNf1  cDNAs we again identified an overall trend of metabolic differences pertaining  to ""oxidative phosphorylation"", ""mitochondria dysfunction"", and ""glycolysis"" in  the variant cDNA expressing cells. We then validated differential expression of  the following proteins: LAMC1, CYB5R3, and SOD2 that are observed in the altered  pathways. Finally, consistent with our proteomics findings, we show that NF1 is  required to maintain mitochondrial respiratory function in Schwann cells by  stabilizing NADH-linked oxidative phosphorylation and electron transfer. Taken  together, these data indicate that NF1 plays a significant role in mitochondrial  metabolism that results in proteomic changes in Schwann cells and may serve as a  future drug target.  © 2025.

We aimed to characterize the structure and function of the early visual system  of the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) mouse model, a syndromic model of autism  spectrum disorders (ASD). We used Nf1+/- mice and WT littermates and performed  retinal structural analysis by optical coherence tomography (OCT), and  functional assessment by electrophysiological recordings. We then performed  behavioral visual tests using optomotor response (OMR) and sensitivity to visual  stimulus familiarity. From the structural analysis, we found increased thickness  for ganglion cell layer-inner plexiform layer (GCL-IPL) and outer nuclear layer  (ONL) in male Nf1+/- mice compared with WT littermates. Regarding retinal  electrophysiology, female Nf1+/- mice exhibited increased amplitudes for the  second oscillatory potential (OP2) compared with WT littermates. Nevertheless,  both Nf1+/- and WT mice presented normal visual acuity as measured by OMR and  were able to exhibit regular visual stimulus familiarity responses. While  structural sex-dependent changes are in line with previous results for brain  anatomic measures, the subtle sex-dependent changes in oscillatory activity may  relate to GABAergic neurotransmission changes found in NF1. Overall, these  structural and functional changes do not seem to translate into visual  behavioral alterations.  Copyright © 2025 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.

Genetic disorders such as neurofibromatosis type 1 (Nf1) increase vulnerability  to cognitive and behavioral disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder and  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Nf1 results from mutations in the  neurofibromin gene that can reduce levels of the neurofibromin protein. While  the mechanisms have yet to be fully elucidated, loss of Nf1 may alter neuronal  circuit activity leading to changes in behavior and susceptibility to cognitive  and behavioral comorbidities. Here we show that mutations decreasing Nf1  expression alter motor behaviors, impacting the patterning, prioritization, and  behavioral state dependence in a Drosophila model of Nf1. Loss of Nf1 increased  spontaneous grooming in male and female flies. This followed a nonlinear spatial  pattern, with Nf1 deficiency increasing grooming of certain body parts  differentially, including the abdomen, head, and wings. The increase in grooming  could be overridden by hunger in foraging animals, demonstrating that the Nf1  effect is plastic and internal state dependent. Stimulus-evoked grooming  patterns were altered as well, suggesting that hierarchical recruitment of  grooming command circuits was altered. Yet loss of Nf1 in sensory neurons and/or  grooming command neurons did not alter grooming frequency, suggesting that Nf1  affects grooming via higher-order circuit alterations. Changes in grooming  coincided with alterations in walking. Flies lacking Nf1 walked with increased  forward velocity on a spherical treadmill, yet there was no detectable change in  leg kinematics or gait. These results demonstrate that loss of Nf1 alters the  patterning and prioritization of repetitive behaviors, in a state-dependent  manner, without affecting low-level motor functions.

Linear and volumetric analysis are the typical methods to measure tumor size. 3D  volumetric analysis has risen in popularity; however, this is very time and  labor intensive limiting its implementation in clinical practice. This study  aims to show that an AI-led approach can shorten the length of time required to  conduct 3D volumetric analysis of VS tumors and improve image processing  accuracy. From Yale New Haven Hospital and public patient recruitment, 143 MRIs  were included in the ground truth dataset. To create the tumor models for the  ground truth dataset, an image processing software (Simpleware ScanIP, Synopsys)  was used. The helper (DPP V1.0) was trained using proprietary AI- and ML-based  algorithms and information. A proof-of-concept AI model achieved a mean DICE  score of 0.76 (standard deviation 0.21). After the final testing stage, the  model improved to a final mean DICE score of 0.88 (range 0.74-0.93, standard  deviation 0.04). Our study has demonstrated an efficient, accurate AI for 3D  volumetric analysis of vestibular schwannomas. The use of this AI will enable  faster 3D volumetric analysis compared to manual segmentation. Additionally, the  overlay function would allow visualization of growth patterns. The tool will be  a method of assessing tumor growth and allow clinicians to make more informed  decisions.  © 2025. The Author(s).

INTRODUCTION: Neurofibromatosis type 2 (Nf2) gene inactivation is common in  sporadic and Nf2-related meningioma. There is currently scant literature  describing the development of an intracranial meningioma model in animals. Given  the role of Nf2 and other gene inactivation in meningeal cells, we used Cas9  mice here as the background host to establish a new animal model of skull base  meningioma in this study. AIMS: Cas9 transgenic mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory and raised in  our institution. Subsequently, meningeal cells were obtained from the Cas9  transgenic mice, cultured in medium, and passaged in vitro. We then prepared  lentivirus vector pLentiCre/gRNA, which could express the elements blocking the  function of four genes: Nf2, P15Ink4b, P16Ink4a, and P19Arf. We infected the  meningeal cells with the lentivirus vector pLentiCre/gRNA and tested the  expression of these four genes in those infected meningeal cells. Next,  adeno-associated virus vector pAAVCre/gRNA was injected in vivo into the skull  base meningeal cells of the neonate Cas9 transgenic mice. These mice were  observed once a week and killed 10 months later for brain inspection and  pathological analysis. RESULTS: Twenty Cas9 transgenic mice were successfully bred. Five mice were  killed so that meningeal cells could be extracted, cultured, and infected with  the lentivirus vector pLentiCre/gRNA for 72 h in vitro. The gene function test  showed that Nf2, P15Ink4b, P16Ink4a, and P19Arf were all blocked in the infected  meningeal cells, which indicated that the lentivirus vector pLentiCre/gRNA could  effectively block the expression of the four genes in targeted cells. Then  pAAVCre/gRNA was injected into the skull base meningeal cells of 15 mice  in vivo, and nine mice were observed for 10 months so that the intracranial  tumor growth could be assessed. Among these nine mice, pathological analysis  showed that six mice had benign meningioma subtypes similar to human meningioma,  one mouse had atypical meningioma, one mouse had malignant meningioma, and one  mouse had sarcoma. CONCLUSIONS: The Cas9 mouse model of skull base meningioma generated with the  Nf2 genetic defect and the combinational loss of P15Ink4b, P16Ink4a, and P19Arf  could provide a new tool for investigating the pathogenesis of meningioma and  the development of chemical interventions for this disease.  © 2025 The Author(s).

(#)Contributed equally  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and schwannomatosis (SWN) are rare genetic  disorders with distinct genetic etiologies. Both syndromes are predominantly  characterized by the development of multiple benign nerve sheath tumors, which  typically arise from cranial/peripheral nerves. The management of  NF1/SWN-associated benign nerve sheath tumors pose a substantial clinical  challenge. In recent years, immunotherapy has demonstrated significant efficacy  in treating various tumors, but its application to NF1/SWN has not been  explored. In this study, we first evaluated the feasibility of chimeric antigen  receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy for the treatment of benign NF1/SWN-related nerve  sheath tumor by analyzing the expression of multiple antigens in 85 tumor  samples. Our findings revealed that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/HER1)  was highly expressed in most samples, indicating its potential as an ideal  target for CAR-T cell therapy. Additionally, TGFβ1 and PDL1, key inhibitory  regulators of T cell function within solid tumor microenvironment (TME), were  universally overexpressed in these samples, highlighting the immunosuppressive  nature of NF1/SWN tumors. To target HER1, we constructed CARs using three  distinct scFvs (806, E2 and NEC). All three types of CAR-T cells demonstrated  significant tumor-eliminating capability against NF1/SWN tumor cell lines, with  806 CAR-T cells showing the highest efficacy. Considering the immunosuppressive  TME, we knocked out TGFBR2 and/or PDCD1 in 806 CAR-T cells using CRISPR/Cas9.  Their anti-tumor efficacy was further evaluated using a 3D tumor spheroid model,  and the gene-edited 806 CAR-T cells exhibited superior anti-tumor efficacy. In  conclusion, we identified HER1 as a target for CAR-T cell therapy in  NF1/SWN-related nerve sheath tumors, and developed anti-HER1 CAR-T cells that  effectively eliminated NF1/SWN tumor cells, providing a promising therapeutic  strategy for patients with these conditions.  © 2025.

Porcine biomedical models have emerged as valuable tools in biomedical research  due to their physiological, anatomical, metabolic, immunological, and genetic  similarities to humans. As a result, they offer greater relevance for  translational studies than rodent models. Moreover, compared to nonhuman  primates, porcine models are more cost-effective, easier to manipulate  genetically, and raise fewer ethical concerns. However, the conventional breeds  of swine most commonly used in research have rapid growth rates, which lead to  logistical challenges such as increased space requirements, making them  impractical as biomedical models. The Wisconsin Miniature SwineTM (WMSTM) was  developed to address these shortcomings. The WMSTM porcine model grows slower,  reaching and maintaining human sizes at adulthood. The model was also  specifically designed to possess more human-like physiology that allows for easy  modeling of comorbidities like obesity and metabolic syndrome that affect a  large portion of the human population affected by chronic diseases. Thus, WMS™  is an ideal porcine gene editing platform for modeling complex multifactorial  diseases. Here, we present the first draft genome assembly representative of the  WMSTM line. The primary assembly was generated with ∼20× coverage of long reads  from Oxford Nanopore Technologies and independently error-corrected using 23×  Pacific Biosciences reads. Arima Genomics Hi-C data were used to improve  contiguity. Largely congruent with the existing Sus scrofa genome, we also show  the utility of WMSTM as a model through comparisons between 2 WMSTM genes and  human homologs. Finally, we show the utility of genotyping by sequencing across  WMSTM herds. The WMSTM genome generated here is highly complete and supports  investigators utilizing WMSTM in biomedical research.  © The Author(s) 2025.

(#)Contributed equally  BACKGROUND: Schwannomas are nerve sheath tumors arising at cranial and  peripheral nerves, either sporadically or in patients with a  schwannomatosis-predisposition syndrome. There is limited understanding of the  transcriptional heterogeneity of schwannomas across genetic backgrounds and  anatomic locations. METHODS: Here, we prospectively profile by single-cell full-length  transcriptomics tumors from 22 patients with NF2-related schwannomatosis,  non-NF2-related schwannomatosis, and sporadic schwannomas, resected from cranial  and peripheral nerves. We profiled 11,373 cells (after QC), including neoplastic  cells, fibroblasts, T cells, endothelial cells, myeloid cells, and pericytes. RESULTS: We characterize the intra-tumoral genetic and transcriptional  heterogeneity of schwannoma, identifying six distinct transcriptional  metaprograms, with gene signatures related to stress, myelin production, antigen  presentation, interferon signaling, glycolysis, and extracellular matrix. We  demonstrate the robustness of our findings with analysis of an independent  cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our atlas describes the spectrum of gene expression across  schwannoma entities at the single-cell level and will serve as an important  resource for the community.  © 2025.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and Legius syndrome (LS) are caused by  inactivating variants in NF1 and SPRED1. NF1 encodes neurofibromin (NF), a  GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for RAS that interacts with the SPRED1 product,  Sprouty-related protein with an EVH (Ena/Vasp homology) domain 1 (SPRED1).  Obtaining a clinical and molecular diagnosis of NF1 or LS can be challenging due  to the phenotypic diversity, the size and complexity of the NF1 and SPRED1 loci,  and uncertainty over the effects of some NF1 and SPRED1 variants on pre-mRNA  splicing and/or protein expression and function. To improve NF1 and SPRED1  variant classification and establish pathogenicity for NF1 and SPRED1 variants  identified in individuals with NF1 or LS, we analyzed patient RNA by RT-PCR and  performed in vitro exon trap experiments and estimated NF and SPRED1 protein  expression, RAS GAP activity, and interaction. We obtained evidence to support  pathogenicity according to American College of Medical Genetics guidelines for  73/114 variants tested, demonstrating the utility of functional approaches for  NF1 and SPRED1 variant classification and NF and LS diagnostics.

Introduction: Sleep is a fundamental biological function critical for physical  and mental health. Chronic sleep disturbances can significantly impair  cognitive, emotional, and social functioning, leading to deficits in attention,  alertness, and executive function, alongside increased irritability, anxiety,  and depression. For pediatric patients, such disturbances pose additional  concerns, potentially disrupting developmental processes and quality of life for  both children and their families. Objectives: Emerging evidence suggests a  correlation between neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and an increased prevalence  of sleep disorders in children. NF1, a genetic condition affecting multiple body  systems, including the nervous system, may predispose children to sleep  disturbances due to its neurodevelopmental and behavioral impacts. This  observational case-control study aimed to explore the association between NF1  and sleep disorders in pediatric patients, comparing the prevalence and patterns  of sleep disturbances between NF1 patients and healthy controls. Patients and  Methods: The study included 100 children aged 2-12 years, divided into two  groups: 50 with NF1 (case group) and 50 children belonging to the control group.  NF1 patients were recruited from the Unit of Rare Diseases of the Nervous System  in Childhood at the Policlinico ""G. Rodolico-San Marco"" University Hospital in  Catania. Data were collected using a questionnaire completed by parents,  assessing parasomnias, breathing-related sleep disorders, and other behavioral  and physiological disturbances; these data were compared to a sleep assessment  performed using an Apple Watch Ultra. Results: NF1 patients exhibited a  significantly higher prevalence of sleep disorders than controls. Notable  differences included increased nocturnal hyperhidrosis (48% vs. 10%), bruxism  (48% vs. 28%), restless legs syndrome (22% vs. 4%), frequent nighttime  awakenings (22% vs. 8%), and sleep paralysis (12% vs. 0%). A finding of poorer  sleep quality also emerged from the results of sleep analysis using an Apple  Watch Ultra. Conclusions: These findings confirm an elevated risk of sleep  disorders in children with NF1, emphasizing the importance of early  identification and management to improve quality of life and mitigate cognitive  and behavioral impacts. Further research is essential to understand the  mechanisms underlying these associations and develop targeted interventions for  this population.

(#)Contributed equally  BACKGROUND: Pain is a common symptom in individuals with neurofibromatosis type  1 (NF1) that often is associated with plexiform neurofibroma (pNF) tumors. To  date, no patient-reported outcome measures have been validated specifically to  assess pNF-related pain intensity or pain interference in this population. Such  measures are sorely needed since pain is being considered as an outcome in  clinical trials targeting reduction of pNF. The study aims were to: (1) obtain  qualitative information from individuals with NF1 and pNFs about their pain and  its measurement and (2) modify existing scales to assess pNF-related pain  intensity and pain interference for NF1 clinical trials. METHODS: For this multi-site, qualitative study, 56 individuals (26 children,  6-16 years; 30 adults, 18-68 years) with NF1 and pNF participated in a focus  group and/or individual interview about pain intensity and pain interference  (concept elicitation) and also provided feedback about existing pain measures  (Numeric Rating Scale-11 and Pain Interference Index) assessing these domains  (cognitive debriefing). Four additional waves of cognitive debriefing interviews  further refined the measures. Qualitative concept elicitation data from  transcripts were coded, analyzed using NVivo software, and thematic analysis was  conducted using both deductive and inductive techniques. Additional themes and  systematic problems and suggestions regarding the measures were gleaned from  reviewing the field notes and interview transcriptions generated by the  cognitive debriefing sessions. RESULTS: Concept elicitation themes included descriptions of two types of  pNF-related pain (chronic and episodic), variability of pain over time, varying  ability to recall pain, lack of knowledge of pNFs, and the ways pain interferes  with daily activities. Cognitive debriefing themes included information on how  to rate pNF-related pain intensity apart from other pain; problems and  suggestions regarding the measures included difficulty comprehending some items  and preferences for alternative wording and formatting. Based on these  qualitative results, the measures' instructions, items, and formatting were  modified to create the PAin INtensity Scale for plexiform neurofibromas  (PAINS-pNF) and the Pain Interference Index for plexiform neurofibromas  (PII-pNF) for administration on a mobile app or web-based platform. CONCLUSIONS: The PAINS-pNF and PII-pNF are promising self-report measures  developed using patient engagement to evaluate tumor pain intensity and pain  interference in NF1 clinical trials. The second phase of the study to provide  reliability, validity, and normative data for individuals with NF1 and pNFs ages  8 years and older is underway.  © 2025.

Objective Meningiomas commonly recur following gross total resection (GTR), and  the risk of recurrence is difficult to predict using current classification  schemes such as the World Health Organization (WHO) tumor grade. This study  aimed to create a predictive model of recurrence risk following GTR of WHO grade  1 meningiomas based on histopathological and epidemiological factors.  Methods A  retrospective chart review was completed for all patients at our institution who  underwent their first surgery for a WHO grade 1 meningioma between 2017 and  2022. Those with genetic predispositions, such as neurofibromatosis type 2, were  excluded. Baseline characteristics, including histopathology findings, were  obtained, and we used a Risk-calibrated Superspase Linear Integer Model  (Risk-SLIM) with a five-fold cross-validation (CV) to create a predictive model  of recurrence over an average follow-up of three years.  Results Univariate  analysis of our selected variables revealed a significant predictive association  between WHO grade 1 meningioma recurrence and subtotal resection but not with  any other variable. However, the meningioma recurrence score (MRS) generated by  our machine learning algorithm revealed multiple predictive factors of  recurrence, including age, female gender, and various histopathologic features,  including the Ki-67/MIB-1 index. Conclusions Machine learning algorithms like  the one we present here may help identify patients at high risk of recurrence of  their WHO grade 1 meningioma, and they are more likely to benefit from closer  postoperative surveillance or adjuvant treatment, even when GTR is achieved.

BACKGROUND: Cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs) are the hallmark of the  tumor-predisposition syndrome neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1). While cNFs are always  benign, they markedly decrease quality of life in individuals with NF1.  Understanding the differences between cNFs and the skin is essential for  developing treatments for cNFs. METHODS: We collected 15 cNFs from four NF1 individuals and used mass  spectrometry to compare the tumor tissue with the skin overlying each tumor.  Data were analyzed based on Gene Ontology (GO) terms. RESULTS: The expression patterns of the Schwann cell marker S100B and several  keratins confirmed successful dissection of cNF tissue from the overlying skin.  Hierarchical clustering showed extensive overlap between the tumor and skin  samples in three out of four individuals, suggesting high overall similarity  between the two tissue types. Based on the analysis of the GO terms, cNFs were  associated with decreased expression of proteins related to cell proliferation,  extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis and cellular metabolism. CONCLUSION: The cNFs are relatively quiescent, consistent with their benign  nature and limited growth potential. The development of pharmacological therapy  for cNFs requires overcoming the high similarity between cNFs and the overlying  skin. The present dataset can serve as a resource for future research on cNFs.  © 2025. The Author(s).

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder characterised  by skin and nervous system anomalies, primarily involving glial cells and nerve  tumours. Pain, particularly chronic pain, is a significant but often overlooked  symptom in NF1 patients, affecting their health-related quality of life. The  dorsal root ganglion (DRG) is essential for pain signal transmission, yet in  vivo studies of DRG in NF1 patients are lacking. METHODS: This prospective study included 20 NF1 patients (8 with neuropathic  pain) and 28 healthy controls. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of  lumbosacral DRG (L5 + S1) were performed using a 3-T scanner. Quantitative MRI  techniques were applied to assess DRG volume, T2 relaxation time, and proton  density (PD). Statistical analyses compared NF1 patients and controls, and NF1  patients with and without pain. RESULTS: NF1 patients had a significantly larger DRG volume and higher  quantitative T2 and PD values compared to controls. Furthermore, DRG PD was  significantly higher in NF1 patients with neuropathic pain than in those without  pain. Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis identified DRG PD as the  best discriminator of pain in NF1 patients, with an area under the curve of  0.84, indicating relevant and useful discriminatory power. CONCLUSION: NF1 patients showed objective macrostructural and microstructural  DRG injury changes using dedicated DRG MRI, discriminating neuropathic pain  status from non-pain status at the disease-symptom group level. These findings  highlight the potential of DRG MRI to quantify DRG pathology in vivo and to  determine the risk of functional pain status by imaging. RELEVANCE STATEMENT: The identification of structural and microstructural  changes of the DRG by quantitative MRI provides a novel in vivo biomarker for  understanding neuropathic pain mechanisms, pain risk assessment and treatment  monitoring in NF1. KEY POINTS: Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in NF1 are enlarged by 176.3% in MRI. In  quantitative MRI of DRG NF1, T2 relaxation time is increased by 22.9% and PD by  8.4%. DRG PD can distinguish a painful from a non-painful NF1 phenotype.  © 2025. The Author(s).

Alrubia S(1), Alshehri WA(1), Alzoman NZ(1), Darwish IA(1).  Author information: (1)1Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy King Saud  University, Riyadh Saudi Arabia.  Selumetinib (SEL) is a recently approved medication for paediatric patients who  have neurofibromatosis type 1. It is the first approved therapy for this rare,  debilitating, and disfiguring disease. Development of proper analytical  platforms for SEL analysis in its marketed pharmaceutical formulation (Koselugo®  capsules) and blood plasma is highly warranted. Availability of such analytical  tools would ensure SEL capsules' quality and effective therapy. This study  introduces, for the first time, the development of two label-free and sensitive  platforms for SEL quantification in capsules and human plasma. These platforms  are microwave-assisted with an ultraviolet absorbance microplate reader (MW-UV)  and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with a photodiode-array  detector (HPLC-PDA). Both platforms employed the SEL native UV absorption as an  analytical signal. The MW-UV measured the UV absorption in 96-well transparent  plates at 255 nm. The HPLC-PDA involved chromatographic separation of SEL and  tozasertib (TOZ), internal standard, on a C18 column both were detected at 255  nm. The optimum procedures of both platforms were established and validated  following the ICH guidelines. The linearity ranges were 15-500 µg mL-1 and  0.8-100 µg mL-1, with limits of quantification of 15.3 and 3.5 µg mL-1, for  MW-UV and HPLC-PDA, resp. Both platforms displayed high precision with relative  standard deviation values ≤ 1.8 %, and high accuracy with recovery ranging from  98.3 to 102.3 %. The platforms were successfully applied to quantify SEL in bulk  form, Koselugo® capsules, and were preliminarily applied to human plasma  analysis. Eco-friendliness assessment confirmed the adherence of both platforms  to green analytical approaches. MW-UV and HPLC-PDA are simple and fast, enabling  high-throughput analysis, thus introducing valuable tools for routine use in  quality control and clinical laboratories for SEL quantification.  © 2025 Sarah Alrubia et al.

One of the hallmarks of cancer cells is their failure to respond to the cellular  mechanism of apoptosis. The B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) family of proteins  regulate apoptosis. Their ability to do so can be measured using several methods  that in turn anticipate the fate of the cancer cell in response to  apoptosis-inducing treatment. These assays ultimately identify the readiness of  the cancer cell to undergo apoptosis, which is referred to as the mitochondrial  priming state. These metrics, however, have been challenging to implement in the  clinic. Methods: Here, we describe a unique method that relies on a panel of  novel conformation-specific antibodies (termed PRIMAB) that can directly measure  the mitochondrial priming state. These reagents are highly specific for  complexes of their corresponding pro-survival protein interactions with the  pro-apoptotic protein BIM. These BIM-containing heterodimeric complexes have  long been established as hallmarks of primed cancer cells. Results: Using  clinically amenable assay formats, PRIMABs were shown to detect the presence of  these anti-apoptotic-pro-apoptotic complexes and their disruption by BH3-mimetic  drugs. Moreover, PRIMABs were able to detect a shift in priming status following  BH3-mimetic treatment, a factor associated with resistance to these drugs. In a  panel of AML patient samples, we report a wide range of priming levels for each  PRIMAB complex, demonstrating the potential for heterogeneity in responses. We  also show that PRIMABs could be predictive of outcomes for AML patients  following cytarabine-based treatment. Conclusions: PRIMABs provide novel and  useful tools for cancer research and for clinical implementation as reagents  providing predictive tests for treatment response.

Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 develop multiple cutaneous neurofibromas  (cNFs) for which no effective drug therapy exists; mainstay treatment remains  physical removal. However, clinical trials testing new drugs are ongoing, and  quantitative techniques based on cNF biology are needed to measure changes in  cNF after treatment. cNF tumor bulk is composed of extracellular matrix and  inflammatory cells that dictate their stiffness. No studies have reported  measuring the stiffness change in neurofibromas, which would indicate shrinking  of the tumor bulk. The goal of this study was to evaluate 2 different  instruments-the Rex Gauge durometer (denoted as REX) and the Delfin  SkinFibroMeter (denoted as DELFIN)-in reproducibly measuring cNF stiffness.  Ninety-seven neurofibromas from patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 on  different skin areas were measured at each of 2 visits about 2 weeks apart. The  DELFIN had moderate within-tumor agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient =  0.607, 95% confidence interval = 0.512-0.691) and moderate within-visit  agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.732, 95% confidence interval =  0.665-0.786), and the REX had moderate within-tumor agreement (intraclass  correlation coefficient = 0.740, 95% confidence interval = 0.631-0.816) and  excellent within-visit agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.937,  95% confidence interval = 0.913-0.953), while accounting for repeated visits and  tumor measurements clustered within each patient. We found that both the DELFIN  and REX are easy to use and reliable, providing consistent quantification of cNF  stiffness.  © 2025 The Authors.

The NF1 tumor suppressor gene is recurrently mutated in human cancers and is  associated with the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) cancer predisposition  syndrome. NF1 encodes neurofibromin, a Ras guanosine triphosphate (GTPase)  activating protein that negatively regulates Ras signaling. NF1 mutation  accordingly leads to Ras misactivation and downstream activation of RAF/MEK/ERK  signaling, leading to the approval of the MEK inhibitor selumetinib for NF-1  associated peripheral nervous system (PNS) tumors. However, how NF1 loss  modifies response to selumetinib and the utility of targeting additional  upstream inputs or downstream outputs of Ras these tumors remain unclear. Here,  we perform RNA-sequencing, phosphoproteomic, pharmacologic, and proximal  proteomic analysis across a panel of CRISPR interference immortalized peripheral  nerve (iPN) cells to systematically dissect the function of neurofibromin loss.  Small guide NF1 (sgNF1) repression is sufficient to increase Ras GTP levels and  alter gene expression to promote cell proliferation and dedifferentiation, with  sgNF1 iPNs showing decreased sensitivity to selumetinib due to altered feedback  regulation to Ras/RAF/MEK/ERK. Upstream small guide PTPN11 (sgPTPN11) repression  leads to the inverse gene expression signature, decreasing cell proliferation  and promoting differentiation, and sgPTPN11 iPNs are more sensitive to  selumetinib. However, upstream sonof sevenless 1 inhibition shows limited  efficacy in iPNs due to compensation by SOS2. Finally, proximal proteomics  reveals Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (KRAS), but not Harvey rat sarcoma virus  (HRAS) or neuroblastoma Ras viral oncogene homolog (NRAS), associates with  neurofibromin in iPN cells, and pan-KRAS inhibition is sufficient to block ERK  activation and CDK1/2 activation in NF1 mutant cells, suggesting blocking KRAS  may be a therapeutic approach for NF1 mutant PNS tumors.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations of the  NF1 tumor suppressor gene resulting in the loss of function of neurofibromin, a  GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Ras. While the malignant manifestations of  NF1 are associated with loss of heterozygosity of the residual WT allele, the  nonmalignant neurodevelopmental sequelae, including autism spectrum disorder  (ASD) and/or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are prevalent  morbidities that occur in the setting of neurofibromin haploinsufficiency. We  reasoned that augmenting endogenous levels of WT neurofibromin could serve as a  potential therapeutic strategy to correct the neurodevelopmental manifestations  of NF1. Here, we used a combination of genetic screening and genetically  engineered murine models to identify a role for the F-box protein FBXW11 as a  regulator of neurofibromin degradation. Disruption of Fbxw11, through germline  mutation or targeted genetic manipulation in the nucleus accumbens, increased  neurofibromin levels, suppressed Ras-dependent ERK phosphorylation, and  corrected social learning deficits and impulsive behaviors in male Nf1+/- mice.  Our results demonstrate that preventing the degradation of neurofibromin is a  feasible and effective approach to ameliorate the neurodevelopmental phenotypes  in a haploinsufficient disease model.

BACKGROUND: Accurate monitoring of tumor progression is crucial for optimizing  outcomes in neurofibromatosis type 2-related schwannomatosis. Standard 2D linear  analysis on magnetic resonance imaging is less accurate than 3D volumetric  analysis, but since 3D volumetric analysis is time-consuming, it is not widely  used. To shorten the time required for 3D volumetric analysis, our lab has been  developing an automated artificial intelligence-driven 3D volumetric tool. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to survey and interview clinicians  treating neurofibromatosis type 2-related schwannomatosis to understand their  views on current 2D analysis and to gather insights for the design of an  artificial intelligence-driven 3D volumetric analysis tool. METHODS: Interviews examined for the following themes: (1) shortcomings of the  currently used linear analysis, (2) utility of 3D visualizations, (3) features  of an interactive 3D modeling software, and (4) lack of a gold standard to  assess the accuracy of 3D volumetric analysis. A Likert scale questionnaire was  used to survey clinicians' levels of agreement with 25 statements related to 2D  and 3D tumor analyses. RESULTS: A total of 14 clinicians completed a survey, and 12 clinicians were  interviewed. Specialties ranged across neurosurgery, neuroradiology, neurology,  oncology, and pediatrics. Overall, clinicians expressed concerns with current  linear techniques, with clinicians agreeing that linear measurements can be  variable with the possibility of two different clinicians calculating 2  different tumor sizes (mean 4.64, SD 0.49) and that volumetric measurements  would be more helpful for determining clearer thresholds of tumor growth (mean  4.50, SD 0.52). For statements discussing the capabilities of a 3D volumetric  analysis and visualization software, clinicians expressed strong interest in  being able to visualize tumors with respect to critical brain structures (mean  4.36, SD 0.74) and in forecasting tumor growth (mean 4.77, SD 0.44). CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians were overall in favor of the adoption of 3D volumetric  analysis techniques for measuring vestibular schwannoma tumors but expressed  concerns regarding the novelty and inexperience surrounding these techniques.  However, clinicians felt that the ability to visualize tumors with reference to  critical structures, to overlay structures, to interact with 3D models, and to  visualize areas of slow versus rapid growth in 3D would be valuable  contributions to clinical practice. Overall, clinicians provided valuable  insights for designing a 3D volumetric analysis tool for vestibular schwannoma  tumor growth. These findings may also apply to other central nervous system  tumors, offering broader utility in tumor growth assessments.  © Shelby T Desroches, Alice Huang, Rithvik Ghankot, Steven M Tommasini, Daniel H  Wiznia, Frank D Buono.

OBJECTIVE: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a neurocutaneous genetic disorder  caused by dominant mutations in the NF1 gene and characterized by increased  susceptibility to develop benign and malignant tumors. The type of NF1 mutation,  the expression of gene modifiers as well as epigenetic factors correlate with  the clinical heterogeneity. In this regard microRNAs (miRNAs) play a role in  post-transcriptional gene regulation. Compelling evidence shows that circulating  miRNAs mirror pathophysiological conditions, thus emerging as potential  biomarkers for human diseases. To date, the role of circulating miRNAs in NF1  has been poorly investigated. We aimed to study serum miRNA profiling as novel  non-invasive diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for NF1 disease. METHODS: The profile of circulating miRNAs in a monocentric cohort of 126 NF1  patients was carried out by a pooling approach of small non-coding RNA  sequencing and validation analysis by Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR. RESULTS: sncRNA-seq analysis of pooled serum samples identified 87  differentially expressed miRNAs in NF1 patients compared to healthy controls.  qRT-PCR validation confirmed a distinctive circulating miRNA signature in NF1,  with significant upregulation of miR-100-5p, miR-16-2-3p, miR-4508, and  miR-885-5p and downregulation of miR-107 and miR-4433b-5p. Hierarchical  clustering based on these six miRNAs effectively discriminated NF1 subjects from  controls, and network analysis revealed their involvement in key cancer-related  pathways, including ERK/MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and mTOR signaling. INTERPRETATION: Our study identified a distinct circulating miRNA signature of  six miRNAs that reliably differentiates NF1 patients from non-affected  individuals. These miRNAs are implicated in regulating NF1 downstream pathways  and signaling processes involved in tumorigenesis.  Copyright © 2025 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

INTRODUCTION: Neurofibromatosis type 2 related Schwannomatosis (NF2-SWN) is a  genetic disorder characterized by the growth of vestibular schwannomas (VS),  which often leads to progressive hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction.  Accurate volumetric assessment of VS tumors is crucial for effective monitoring  and treatment planning. Since tumor growth dynamics are often subtle, the  resolution of MRI scans plays a critical role in detecting small volumetric  changes that inform clinical decisions. This study evaluates the impact of MRI  voxel resolution on the accuracy of manual and AI-driven volumetric segmentation  of VS in NF2-SWN patients. METHODS: Ten patients with NF2-SWN, totaling 17 tumors, underwent  high-resolution MRI scans with varying voxel sizes on different MRI machines at  Yale New Haven Hospital. Tumors were segmented using both manual and AI-based  methods, and the effect of voxel size on segmentation precision was quantified  through volume measurements, Dice similarity coefficients, and Hausdorff  distances. RESULTS: Results indicate that larger voxel sizes (1.2 × 0.9 × 4.0 mm)  significantly reduced segmentation accuracy when compared to smaller voxel sizes  (0.5 × 0.5 × 0.8 mm). In addition, AI-based segmentation outperformed manual  methods, particularly at larger voxel sizes. DISCUSSION: These findings highlight the importance of optimizing voxel  resolution for accurate tumor monitoring and suggest that AI-driven segmentation  may improve consistency and precision in NF2-SWN tumor surveillance.  © 2025 Ghankot, Singh, Desroches, Jester, Mahajan, Lorr, Buono, Wiznia, Johnson  and Tommasini.

Plexiform neurofibromas (hereafter called pNF1) are often diagnosed in early  childhood and occur in about 30% of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients.  pNF1 exhibits aggressive growth along a nerve in the body and has substantial  potential for progression to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors that are  rarely curable. There are two recently FDA-approved drugs, selumetinib and  mirdametinib, for pNF1 patients who have symptomatic and inoperable plexiform  neurofibromas; however, these treatments achieve only approximately 30% tumor  shrinkage. Fibroblasts, the most abundant cell types within the pNF1 tumor  microenvironment, are implicated in pNF1 growth and invasion; however, how  fibroblasts affect a drug response of pNF1 remains poorly understood. In the  present study, we focused on contributions of fibroblasts to the drug resistance  in pNF1 via their secretome. We employed our established three-dimensional (3D)  culture system incorporating human pNF1 tumor cells (Nf1-/-) and primary  fibroblasts (Nf1+/-) grown in our patented microfluidic culture chips for  monocultures and parallel cocultures in which 3D pNF1 structures and fibroblasts  share their secretome without direct cell-to-cell contact. Three-dimensional  pNF1 structures in 3D parallel cocultures with fibroblasts exhibited greater  drug resistance than ones in monocultures. We found that pNF1 tumor cells showed  increased P-glycoprotein expression when incubated with fibroblast-derived  conditioned media or parallel cocultured with fibroblasts, compared to control  conditions. Pharmacological inhibition of P-glycoprotein partially restored drug  sensitivity. Additionally, fibroblasts showed higher resistance to selumetinib  and mirdametinib than pNF1 tumor structures, likely due to elevated  P-glycoprotein levels. This study is the first to define precise roles of  fibroblasts in pNF1 drug resistance, emphasizing the potential of  fibroblast-targeted therapies as a promising approach to improve pNF1 treatment  outcomes.

Identification of a pathogenic variant in NF1 is diagnostic for  neurofibromatosis, but is often impossible at the moment of variant detection  due to many factors including allelic heterogeneity, sequence homology, and the  lack of functional assays. Computational tools may aid in interpretation but are  not established for NF1. Here, we optimized our random forest-based predictor  RENOVO for NF1 variant interpretation. RENOVO was developed using an approach of  ""database archaeology"": by comparing versions of ClinVar over the years, we  defined ""stable"" variants that maintained the same pathogenic/likely  pathogenic/benign/likely benign (P/LP/B/LB) classification over time (n = 3579,  the training set), and ""unstable"" variants that were initially classified as  Variants of Unknown Significance (VUS) but were subsequently reclassified as  P/LP/B/LB (n = 57, the test set). This approach allows to retrospectively  measure accuracy on prediction with insufficient information, reproducing the  scenario of maximal clinical utility. We further validated performance on: (i)  validation set 1: 100 NF1 variants classified as VUS at the time of RENOVO  development and subsequently reclassified as P/LP/B/LB in ClinVar; (ii)  validation set 2: 15 de novo variants discovered in a prospective clinical  cohort and subsequently reclassified per ACMG criteria. RENOVO obtained  consistently high accuracy on all datasets: 98.6% on the training test, 96.5% in  the test set, 82% in validation set 1 (but 96.2% for missense variants) and  93.7% on validation set 2. In conclusion, RENOVO-NF1 accurately interprets NF1  variants for which information at the time of detection is insufficient for ACMG  classification and may overcome diagnostic challenges in neurofibromatosis.  © 2025.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the value of high resolution nerve ultrasound (HRUS)3 and  nerve conduction studies (NCS)4 in screening for plexiform neurofibromas (PNs)5  in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).6 METHODS: Adult patients with NF1 were  eligible. Patients were divided into two groups: with peripheral nervous system  related symptoms (PNS7 group) and without PNS-related symptoms (non-PNS group).  Study visit included neurological examination, NCS and HRUS. RESULTS: Sixty patients were enrolled, 37 in the PNS group and 23 in the non-PNS  group. HRUS was abnormal in 52 patients (87 %), 34 in the PNS group (92 %) and  18 in the non-PNS group (78 %, p = 0.24). Patients with continuous nerve  enlargements (high PN tumor load) were easily distinguished with HRUS. 85 % of  patients with normal NCS have nerve enlargements on HRUS. CONCLUSIONS: HRUS helps to assess PN tumor burden in NF1. NCS did not have  additional value. SIGNIFICANCE: HRUS might be useful as a screening tool for PN in NF1, especially  in settings with less MRI availability.  Copyright © 2025 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant tumor syndrome caused by  pathogenic variants in the NF1 gene. Beside tumor formation, patients often have  sleep disturbances, suggesting circadian involvement. Previous NF1 studies have  implicated MAPK pathway, cAMP-PKA, calcium signaling, and ALK in circadian  regulation, and shown disrupted rhythms in murine astrocytes lacking NF1.  However, whether human Schwann cells show rhythmic gene expression remains  unknown, although impaired rhythms may contribute to tumorigenesis. In this  study, we analyzed normal human Schwann cells and NF1-derived malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) for rhythmic gene expression. Cultured  cells were synchronized via serum shock, and mRNA levels of core clock and  associated genes (e.g. ARNTL, JUN, TGFA, CLOCK, VEGFA, MYC) were quantified at  defined intervals. We observed rhythmic core clock gene expression in normal  Schwann cells, demonstrating intrinsic circadian oscillations in peripheral  glia. In contrast, MPNST lacked rhythmicity in core clock genes, instead showing  de novo rhythmic expression of oncogenes and growth factors like MYC and VEGFA.  Thus, loss of clock gene rhythmicity (desynchronization) and emergence of  rhythmic oncogene expression (synchronization) in NF1-associated MPNST further  our understanding of peripheral glial physiology and tumorigenesis. These  insights suggest that chronotherapeutic strategies may be beneficial for  NF1-associated MPNST.  © 2025 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a tumor predisposition syndrome caused by  alterations in NF1 gene that lead to tumor growth throughout the nervous system,  which can cause morbidity and mortality, and transform to malignancy. NF1 gene  replacement therapy, though promising, is hindered by NF1 gene's large size and  delivery challenges. We introduced a membrane-targeted, truncated neurofibromin  comprising the GAP-related domain (GRD) fused to the KRAS4B C-terminal domain,  which effectively inhibits the RAS signaling pathway and restores Schwann cell  differentiation in an NF1 iPSC-derived model. For systemic application, we  engineered an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector using in vivo capsid evolution  through sequential DNA shuffling and peptide library screening in a NF1  xenograft mouse model. This tailored vector, AAV-NF, exhibits greatly reduced  liver uptake, enhanced tumor targeting across various NF1-related MPNST,  neurofibromas and glioma models, and therapeutic efficacy in xenografts of  MPNST. This study not only advances a viable AAV vector for NF1 treatment but  also outlines a replicable strategy for vector and payload development in other  monogenic and tumor-associated disease manifestations.  © 2025.

BACKGROUND: Treatment for patients with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors  (MPNST) is an unmet clinical need. Loss of NF1 in MPNST leads to hyperactivation  of RAS, however little is known about relevant downstream oncogenic signaling  through RAF paralogs and effective targeted therapies in MPNST are still  lacking. METHODS: Conditional gene expression, CRISPR-CAS9, and shRNA-mediated knockdown  were used to perform gain/loss-of-function experiments to explore the effect of  reconstituting the GTPase-activating protein-related domain of NF1 or knockdown  of A/B/CRAF kinases on ERK signaling output and MPNST cell growth. Colony  formation, cell proliferation and live cells imaging assays were performed to  assess cell growth in response to genetic manipulations or drug treatments.  Pathway enrichment analysis on RNA sequencing following drug perturbation,  efficacy studies in cell-line-derived and patient-derived xenograft models, and  immunoblotting/immunohistochemistry were conducted to assess tumor growth and  ERK pathway activity in cells or in pharmacodynamic analyses of tumor  xenografts. RESULTS: NF1 loss activates RAS/ERK signaling through B/CRAF, and cell growth  and ERK signaling of NF1-MPNST are dependent on B/CRAF, but not ARAF. Genetic or  pharmacological inhibition of B/CRAF using a paralog-selective RAF inhibitor  (RAFi) significantly potentiates MEK inhibitor (MEKi) treatment through more  effective suppression of ERK signaling and proliferation. This is shown in  multiple traditional and patient-derived cell line and xenograft models,  including those with acquired resistance to MEKi. CONCLUSIONS: These findings contribute preclinical evidence that the combination  of paralog-selective B/CRAFi and MEKi is effective in NF1-MPNST and can overcome  resistance to single agent MEKi.

Individuals with NF1 develop benign tumors of the peripheral nervous system  (neurofibromas), originating from the Schwann cell (SC) lineage after somatic  loss of the wild-type NF1 allele, some of which progress further to malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). There is only one FDA-approved targeted  therapy for symptomatic plexiform neurofibromas and none approved for MPNSTs.  The genetic basis of NF1 syndrome makes associated tumors ideal for using  synthetic drug sensitivity approaches to uncover therapeutic vulnerabilities. We  developed a drug discovery pipeline to identify therapeutics for NF1-related  tumors using isogeneic pairs of NF1-proficient and NF1-deficient immortalized  human SCs. We utilized these in a large-scale high-throughput screen for drugs  that preferentially kill NF1-deficient cells, through which we identified 23  compounds capable of killing NF1-deficient SCs with selectivity. Multiple hits  from this screen clustered into classes defined by the method of action. Four  clinically interesting drugs from these classes were tested in vivo using both a  genetically engineered mouse model of high-grade PNSTs and human MPNST  xenografts. All drugs tested showed single-agent efficacy in these models as  well as significant synergy when used in combination with the MEK inhibitor  selumetinib. This high-throughput screen platform yielded novel therapeutically  relevant compounds for the treatment of NF1-associated tumors and can serve as a  tool to rapidly evaluate new compounds and combinations in the future.  ©2025 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.

In-depth exploration of tumor immune suppression mechanisms may provide new  therapeutic options for NF2-associated tumors. In this study, we found that sEVs  secreted by NF2-associated schwannomas (NF2-EVs) facilitate the conversion of  CD14+ monocytes into an MDSC-like phenotype, showcasing MDSC-like inhibitory  functions. Moreover, these NF2-EVs are capable of enhancing tumor cell  proliferation. Through proteomic analysis and subsequent validation of the  NF2-EVs, we identified elevated levels of HSP90. When we knocked down HSP90  expression in tumor cells, the sEVs secreted showed diminished capacity to  convert monocytes into MDSCs and a reduced ability to promote tumor cell  proliferation. Conversely, sEVs secreted by tumor cells that overexpress HSP90  displayed the opposite effects. Further mechanistic studies revealed that HSP90  could influence the expression of AKT/p-AKT and ERK/p-ERK. Our results suggest  that NF2 tumor cells could regulate the AKT/p-AKT and ERK/p-ERK pathways to  promote tumor cell proliferation and the formation of an immunosuppressive  microenvironment by secreting sEVs' HSP90, offering valuable insights into the  involvement of HSP90 in exosome-mediated communication within the context of  NF2-related schwannomatosis (NF2-SWN). This information has the potential to  inform the design of effective immunotherapeutic protocols and offer new  treatment options for NF2-SWN patients.

Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated its effectiveness by  achieving human-level performance in various complex tasks, including the  biomedical field. Cancer research, adapting to a fast-changing world, is  leveraging AI as a promising framework to better understand tumor development.  Moreover, current AI methods can help predict more suitable and personalized  treatment strategies for specific types of tumors. We explored AI methods  applied to Neurofibromatosis Type 1, focusing on glial tumors. Additionally, we  have reviewed all publicly available datasets to date. Discussion of future  challenges is highly desirable since Neurofibromatosis Type 1 is one of the most  common hereditary tumor syndromes and is associated with an increased rate of  glial tumors as well as a reduced life expectancy due to malignancy.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a complex, multisystem, genetic disorder  caused by germline NF1 variants that predispose affected individuals to tumors  of the nervous system. With the identification of the NF1 gene in the late 1980s  and the elucidation of the role of the encoded protein, neurofibromin, in  regulating RAS signaling, considerable research effort has been invested to  identify therapeutic treatments for NF1 tumors. Over the past two decades,  high-throughput drug screening approaches have been a significant component of  these endeavors. However, considerable variability exists among studies in terms  of disease models, symptom targets, screening libraries, methods, and outcomes.  In this review, we present an overall summary of efforts toward discovering new  therapeutic strategies for NF1-related tumors using high-throughput screening  and how such findings can be employed for prospective research in the NF1 field.

Identifying genes associated with rare diseases remains challenging due to the  scarcity of patients and the limited statistical power of traditional  association methods. Here, we introduce PERADIGM ( Phenotype Embedding  similarity-based RAre DIsease Gene Mapping), a novel framework that leverages  natural language processing techniques to integrate comprehensive phenotype  information from electronic health records for rare disease gene discovery.  PERADIGM employs an embedding model to capture relationships between ICD-10  codes, providing a nuanced representation of individual phenotypes. By utilizing  patient similarity scores, it enhances the identification of candidate genes  associated with disease-specific phenotypes, surpassing conventional methods  that rely on binary disease status. We applied PERADIGM to the UK Biobank  dataset for three rare diseases: autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease  (ADPKD), Marfan syndrome, and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). PERADIGM  identified additional candidate genes associated with ADPKD-related and Marfan  syndrome-related phenotypes, some of which are supported by existing literature,  and demonstrated enhanced signal detection for NF1-specific phenotypes beyond  traditional methods. Our findings demonstrate the potential of PERADIGM to  identify genes associated with rare diseases and related phenotypes by  incorporating phenotype embeddings and patient similarity, providing a powerful  tool for precision medicine and a deeper understanding of rare disease genetics  and clinical manifestations.

Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2)-related schwannomatosis is an autosomal dominant  genetic disorder characterized by the development of cranial and peripheral  nerve schwannomas, including bilateral vestibular schwannomas which are  associated with substantial morbidity. Current therapeutic strategies comprise  surgical resection, radiotherapy, and systemic administration of bevacizumab;  however, these approaches are frequently limited by high recurrence rates and  morbidity. In this study, a transgenic murine model (Postn-Cre;Nf2flox/flox) was  employed to investigate the combined effect of intraperitoneally administered  human bevacizumab (5 mg/kg b. w.) and focused ultrasound (FUS) on drug delivery  and tumor growth in DRG schwannomas. ELISA-based analysis demonstrated a  3.8-fold increase in intratumoral bevacizumab concentration following the  combined application of human bevacizumab and FUS, compared to bevacizumab  alone. Tumor growth was assessed using 7-T MRI of the spine with intravenous  gadolinium contrast, and outcomes were compared across five experimental groups:  (1) human bevacizumab alone, (2) murine bevacizumab alone, (3) human bevacizumab  combined with FUS, (4) FUS alone, and (5) untreated controls. Treatments,  including drug administration and FUS exposure, were performed three times at  two-week intervals. Notably, the combined treatment group (human  bevacizumab + FUS) exhibited a trend toward tumor size reduction.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Macrocephaly is among the most common findings in  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and may be associated with other clinical  manifestations of the genetic syndrome. NF1-specific growth charts that account  for expected macrocephaly may increase sensitivity for detecting atypical  growth. We aimed to produce NF1-specific growth charts of head circumference for  the age range of 0-3 years and to assess their potential clinical impact. METHODS: Using electronic health records from the Children's Hospital of  Philadelphia, we collected head circumference measurements from children with  NF1 and a community control cohort seen at scheduled well-child visits. We  compared head circumference normalized using Centers for Disease Control (CDC)  growth charts between these groups over time. We constructed NF1-specific growth  charts using 2 independent methods. Finally, we used mixed-effects models to  relate the resulting centile scores to developmental delay assessed with the  Survey of Well-being of Young Children. RESULTS: Our data set contained 2,180 observations from 305 individuals (167  male) with NF1 and 104,750 observations from 16,742 individuals (8,809 male) in  the community control cohort, all aged 0-3 years. Head circumference was  significantly elevated in the NF1 cohort across the age range (p-adjusted  <0.05), but the Cohen effect size d varied nonlinearly with age, starting  moderate at 1 month (d = 0.56), then small at 4 months (d = 0.28), moderate  again at 15 months (d = 0.58), and finally large at 28 months (d = 0.80).  NF1-specific growth curves demonstrated slower increases in head circumference  in the first 2 months of life, yet more sustained growth over time. Although  none of the children with NF1 met the standard for microcephaly according to CDC  charts, smaller head circumference benchmarked against NF1-specific charts was  correlated with developmental delay (standardized β = 0.24; p < 0.02). DISCUSSION: We present the first NF1-specific growth charts for head  circumference covering the age range of 0-3 years. Macrocephaly in NF1 becomes  more exaggerated over time as rate of growth is sustained compared with  controls. Smaller head size relative to NF1 growth expectations is not captured  by CDC charts yet it nevertheless relates to developmental delay, suggesting  that NF1-specific charts may increase sensitivity to clinically concerning  patterns of growth in children with NF1.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that  affects ∼ 1: 2700 individuals (Lee et al., 2023) however the underlying  pathogenic mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we performed  simultaneous reprogramming and CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to generate  pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs) lines and their respective isogenic controls from  six individuals with different pathogenic NF1 variants. All iPSC lines had a  normal karyotype, were pluripotent and able to differentiate into the three  embryonic germ layers. These iPSC lines are valuable pre-clinical models to  investigate the pathomechanisms of NF1 and can be used for future screening to  identify new therapeutic treatments for NF1.

Optic glioma, a slow-growing tumor, is associated with Neurofibromatosis type 1  (NF1) mutations and increased midkine (MDK) production. A connection between  asthma and optic glioma has previously been observed, but the mechanisms are  unclear. To elucidate the role of asthma in the regulation of glioma formation,  we investigated the role of T cells and the subsequent pathways in the  regulation of microglia, a key player in the glioma tumor microenvironment  (TME). While asthma is often linked to chronic inflammation, our mathematical  analysis and experimental evidence suggest that inflammation can play a key role  in suppressing the proliferation of optic glioma cells via immune reprogramming  of T cells and the delicate control of signaling networks in microglia. Our  mathematical model unveils the complex interactions between tumor and immune  cells in optic glioma. Our results indicate that asthma-induced T cell  reprogramming inhibits tumor growth by promoting the release of decorin and a  subsequent suppression of CCR8 and the intercellular binding kinetics in  microglia, followed by blocking of CCL5 production in TME via suppression of  NFκB. We developed anti-cancer strategies by leveraging this asthma-induced  immune regulation.  © 2026. The Author(s).

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant condition in which  patients are heterozygous for a disruptive pathogenic variant in the NF1 gene.  The most characteristic feature of the condition NF1 is the neurofibroma, a  benign, multi-cellular tumor which initiates when a cell of the Schwann cell  lineage gains a somatic pathogenic variant of the other NF1 allele.  Neurofibromas developing at nerve termini in the skin are termed ""cutaneous""  neurofibromas (cNFs), while those developing within larger nerves are termed  ""plexiform."" Most patients develop cNFs beginning in late childhood or early  adulthood, continuing throughout life at variable rates. Some patients may  develop only a few cNFs, while others suffer from thousands. There are no  reliably effective physical or pharmaceutical therapies besides surgical  removal. Although these are not life-threatening, they are disfiguring and can  interfere with normal life functions. To provide a resource for research, we  developed short-term cNF Schwann cell cultures from NF1 patients, from which we  subsequently established the first semi-immortalized cNF cell lines through  transduction with wild-type human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and  murine cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (mCdk4) genes. Here we present molecular,  cellular, and functional characterization of these cell lines, which will be of  utility for investigating and developing NF1 cNF therapies.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a neurogenetic disorder caused by loss of  function mutations in the gene neurofibromin 1 (NF1). NF1 encodes neurofibromin,  a multifunctional tumor suppressing protein that regulates Ras, cAMP, and  dopamine signaling. NF1 predisposes patients to a wide range of symptoms,  including peripheral nerve tumors, brain tumors, and cognitive dysfunction.  Despite considerable work using animal models to investigate the role of  neurofibromin in behavior, translating research into treatment for  NF1-associated cognitive dysfunction has not yet been successful. Here, we  provide evidence that Cxcr4 chemokine receptor signaling is a regulator of  habituation learning and modulator of cAMP-PKA signaling in nf1 mutant larval  zebrafish. Combining a small-molecule drug screen and RNAseq analysis, we show  that cxcr4b expression is increased in nf1 mutants and that pharmacological  inhibition of Cxcr4 with AMD3100 (Plerixafor) improves habituation learning. We  further demonstrate that Plerixafor activates cAMP-PKA pathway signaling but has  limited effects on Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway signaling in the nf1 mutant brain.  CXCR4 was previously identified as a potential therapeutic target for  neurofibromin-deficient tumorigenesis. Our results suggest that Cxcr4 signaling  also regulates neurofibromin-dependent cognitive function.  © 2026. Published by The Company of Biologists.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive sarcomas and a  major cause of mortality in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1). Distinguishing  MPNSTs from benign neurofibromas remains challenging. We investigated fibroblast  activation protein alpha (FAP) as a malignancy biomarker and theranostic target  in peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Therefore, we integrated publicly available  bulk transcriptomics, spatial transcriptomics, and single-cell RNA sequencing  with immunohistochemistry (IHC) on independent archival samples. We further  directly assessed clinical translatability using FAP-targeted PET/CT in an NF-1  patient undergoing work-up for suspected malignant transformation. Across  independent bulk datasets, FAP was consistently up-regulated in MPNSTs compared  with neurofibromas. In the TCGA sarcoma dataset, FAP varied by histotype but was  clearly expressed in MPNSTs. Spatial transcriptomics revealed enrichment of  FAP-high regions in MPNSTs and co-localization with tumor cell markers.  Single-cell analysis showed FAP expression in MPNST tumor cells and  cancer-associated fibroblasts, with the highest levels in neural crest-like  tumor subpopulations previously linked to adverse prognosis; pseudotime analysis  indicated decreasing FAP expression along trajectories toward Schwann cell  precursor-like states linking FAP expression to a more primitive,  dedifferentiated tumor cell state. IHC confirmed strong, predominantly tumor  cell-intrinsic FAP expression in MPNSTs, with minimal staining in neurofibromas  and normal tissues. Plexiform neurofibromas exhibited intermediate FAP  expression. In clinical imaging, FAP-PET demonstrated higher tracer uptake in  histologically proven MPNSTs than in benign lesions within the same patient,  including a neurofibroma that was FDG-avid but FAP-negative, supporting added  diagnostic specificity over FDG-PET/CT. In summary, FAP is robustly  overexpressed in MPNSTs at transcript and protein levels, potentially  concentrates in high-risk tumor cell states, and is detectable by targeted PET  imaging. These findings identify FAP as a clinically relevant biomarker for  malignancy in NF-1-associated tumors and support implementation of FAP-directed  diagnostics and therapeutics in peripheral nerve sheath tumor work-up.  © 2026.

Background: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder  characterized by cutaneous and subcutaneous neurofibromas, which impact quality  of life. Dermoscopy-guided high-frequency ultrasound (DG-HFUS) integrates  dermoscopy with 33 MHz ultrasound, enabling precise lesion localization and  reproducible measurements. Objective: To characterize neurofibromas in NF1  patients using DG-HFUS and identify imaging parameters for diagnosis,  monitoring, and treatment planning. Methods: 14 genetically confirmed NF1  patients underwent DG-HFUS imaging (Dermus SkinScanner). 100 neurofibromas were  assessed for size, location, shape, contours, surface, echogenicity, global  echogenicity, and posterior acoustic features. Results: Lesions were dermal  (79%) or subcutaneous (21%), round (28%), ovoid (63%), or spiked (9%). Mean  vertical and lateral diameters were 5.37 ± 2.66 mm and 2.28 ± 1.39 mm. All were  hypoechoic; 62% homogeneous, 38% heterogeneous. Margins were well-defined in 57%  and poorly defined in 43%. Posterior enhancement occurred in 3% and shadowing in  10%. Conclusions: DG-HFUS provides a detailed, reproducible assessment of  neurofibromas, supporting differential diagnosis, surgical planning, and  longitudinal monitoring. The evaluated imaging parameters offer objective  insights for optimizing NF1 management. Future developments, including 3D  reconstruction and AI-assisted analysis, may further enhance its clinical  utility.

Background and objective Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) typically presents with  physical symptoms, neurocognitive impairments, and chronic pain (CP). Existing  pain measures, originally developed for cancer pain or other diseases, do not  address the specific healthcare needs of NF1 patients. Hence, this study aimed  to examine how individuals with NF1-associated CP and their providers  characterize the physical and emotional experiences of pain, as well as their  perceived needs in assessing NF1-associated CP. Methods We performed a  qualitative study, employing thematic analysis of data collected from six focus  groups with 37 patients with NF1 and 16 one-on-one interviews with clinicians  involved in NF1 care Results We identified three themes: Describing the Pain  Experience, Treating and Dealing With NF1-Associated CP, and Attitudes About  Current Pain Measures. Participants perceived certain shortcomings in current  pain measures, emphasizing that pain tolerance, adaptation of goals and  activities, and the presence of multiple concurrent pain sites are intrinsic to  NF1. Patients expressed frustration with the need to quantify a highly  subjective and individualized experience using existing measures. Similarly,  providers reported frustration that current tools inadequately capture the  impact of chronic pain on patients' daily lives, with some preferring more open,  conversational approaches to pain assessment. Conclusions The data indicated  that pain duration, frequency, regularity, and quality need to be clearly  defined and operationalized for patients and providers to similarly understand  these domains. Incorporating open-ended items that allow patients to describe  their pain in their own words or through images may enhance patients' sense of  being understood by their providers. There is a clear need for a standardized  pain assessment tool that specifically captures the pain experiences of  individuals with NF1.  Copyright © 2025, Grau et al.

NF2 (neurofibromatosis type 2)-related schwannomatosis (NF2-SWN) is a cancer  predisposition syndrome characterized by the development of bilateral vestibular  (VS) and spinal schwannomas. While benign, these tumors can cause substantial  morbidity, and effective pharmacological treatments remain limited. Here, we  demonstrate that genetic ablation of focal adhesion kinase (Fak/Ptk2) impairs  tumor formation and preserves hearing in a murine model of NF2. Mechanistically,  we show that Fak deletion decreases macrophage infiltration, attenuates  nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2-, leucine rich  repeats (LRR)- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 inflammasome activation,  and suppresses the hepatocyte growth factor-MET axis. Pharmacological inhibition  of FAK with single agent VS-4718 did not significantly reduce macroscopic tumor  volume; however, its use in combination with the mitogen-activated protein  kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor selumetinib resulted in both a significant  reduction in tumor volume and the preservation of dorsal root ganglion  architecture. Our findings establish a critical role for FAK in schwannoma  development and provide rationale for evaluation of combination FAK plus MEK  inhibition in future clinical trials for NF2-associated SWN.

(#)Contributed equally  Neurofibromatosis type I is a rare neurocutaneous syndrome characterized by the  development of disfiguring neurofibroma tumors with unmet clinical needs. As  Neurofibromatosis Type I is a monogenic disease, the development of gene therapy  is highly attractive, but it is currently unknown if rescuing the NF1 gene in  established neurofibroma is sufficient for tumor regression. Here, we test this  hypothesis by building two novel NF1 mouse models with reversible NF1  expression. In the first model, the human NF1 -/- Schwann cells named ipNF95.11b  C/T are genetically modified with a doxycycline-inducible full-length mouse Nf1  gene. One month after cells implantation in the sciatic nerve, mice are split  into two treatment groups and received either doxycycline or control water.  Strikingly, most sciatic nerves from mice allowed to drink doxycycline water for  one month do not display neurofibroma histologically (2 out of 16 sciatic  nerves, 13%) whereas 75% (12 out of 16 sciatic nerves) develop or maintain a  neurofibroma when drinking control water. In the second model, the human NF1 +/-  Schwann cells named ipNF95.11 C are genetically modified with a  doxycycline-inducible potent shRNA against the NF1 mRNA transcript. Strikingly,  doxycycline withdrawal after neurofibroma establishment allowed limited  neurofibroma maintenance (3 out of 14 sciatic nerves, 21%), whereas most sciatic  nerves showed evidence of neurofibroma when kept on doxycycline (12 out of 14  sciatic nerves, 86%). Finally, intrathecal injection of the full-length Nf1  lentivirus in established 1-month ipNF95.11b C/T xenograft pNF significantly  reduced tumor burden. All mice are female. Thus, we provide proof-of-principle  of the efficacy of NF1 Gene Therapy in plexiform neurofibroma mice models,  paving the way to the development of therapeutic gene therapy solutions for NF1  patients.  © 2026.

Neuroblastoma is one of the commoner tumors of infancy and childhood. There is  great variation in the histological picture and even within one tumor. One  unique feature is the apparently high rate of spontaneous regression,  particularly during the first year of life. There is also a tendency for  neuroblastoma to mature to the more benign ganglioneuroma and recent in vitro  studies suggest that a serum factor may influence this process. Approximately 90  percent of patients with neuroblastoma excrete abnormally high quantities of  various catecholamines, thus providing a useful diagnostic tool and a means for  evaluating the effect of therapy. Treatment requires a multidisciplinary team  approach involving a surgeon, radiotherapist and chemotherapist. Prognosis is  influenced by a number of host factors and the most important of these seem to  be the patient's age at diagnosis and the extent of the disease, although some  children with widespread disease appear to have a particularly good prognosis.  It is difficult to evaluate the influence of chemotherapy on survival in  patients with neuroblastoma but it has not been of great significance. The  unique biologic characteristics of this tumor require further study in the hope  of providing more effective therapy.

Ross AH, Grob P, Bothwell M, Elder DE, Ernst CS, Marano N, Ghrist BF, Slemp CC,  Herlyn M, Atkinson B, et al.  The nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor was characterized by using a new series  of anti-receptor monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). These MAbs (i) showed  significantly greater reactivity with a melanoma cell line expressing higher  levels of NGF receptor, (ii) inhibited the binding of 125I-labeled NGF to its  receptor, and (iii) immunoprecipitated both metabolically labeled and  125I-labeled NGF affinity-labeled receptor. These experiments defined the  receptor as a 75-kDa cell-surface protein. The NGF receptor was visualized by  immunoperoxidase staining in tissue sections of human nevi, melanomas,  neurofibromas, a pheochromocytoma, and peripheral nerves.

If applied presurgically, it blocks the dispersion  of neocytes during surgery. Also, HLI inhibits metastatic dissemination of  malignant tumors and therefore might reduce the percentage of patients with  recurrence, decreasing the chance of survival of any other primary tumor.

Ariel IM.  Most tumors (benign and malignant) do not arise from the nerves per se, but from  the supporting cells; tumors arising from the cells of Schwann are termed  schwannoma or neurilemoma--benign or malignant. Surgical extirpation is the only  way of treating these tumors. Radiation therapy can offer significant palliation  and prolongation of life, but no cures have been observed. Other forms of  therapy (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, etc.) have little to offer at this time.  Benign tumors can be treated by local surgical extirpation; malignant tumors  must be radically resected, including major amputations where indicated. Certain  dermatomes have a proclivity to produce tumors, and new growths (benign and  malignant) proximal to the one clinically apparent can be expected in certain  patients. Neurofibromatosis (von Recklinghausen's disease) is a genetic error of  metabolism with a proclivity to produce multiple neurofibrosarcomas, and in  about 10 percent of the patients, malignant neurilemomas. Of 100 patients with  malignant neurilemomas treated by the author, 74 were considered determinate;  among them, the 10-year ""cure"" rate was 32 percent.

The melanin macroglobule (MMG), formerly called ""macromelanosome,"" is a  cytoplasmic spherical granule formed in the melanocyte, varying in size from one  to several microns, much larger than normal ellipsoidal melanosomes. Although  ultrastructural features of MMG have been adequately described in the past,  there has been a disagreement about the formation process of MMG. In order to  further elucidate the nature and origin of MMG, electron microscopic studies  were conducted in several pigmentary disorders. Our findings included: (1) The  most remarkable characteristics of MMG are (a) the pleomorphism of their  internal structure and (b) the variation of their size. (2) MMG do not represent  true melanosomes but unique forms of autolysosomes resulting from the fusion of  autophagosomes (containing various numbers of melanosomes) with primary and/or  secondary lysosomes. (3) MMG are retained within melanocytes or transferred to  keratinocytes and to Langerhans cells in the epidermis, and to macrophages in  the dermis in any of their developmental stages. After transfer, MMG can fuse  with other heterolysosomes and probably increase in size in these cells. We  regard melanosome complexes as but one step in an autophagic process within  melanocytes which can, on occasion, produce MMG as residual bodies.

McKee GJ, Ferguson MW.  The mesencephalic neural crest cells of Hamburger-Hamilton Stage 9-Stage 11  chick embryos were surgically extirpated unilaterally in 148 embryos and  bilaterally in 8 embryos. Sham operations were performed unilaterally on 16  control embryos and bilaterally on one control embryo. Embryos were fixed at  various time intervals after operation, studied macroscopically, and by light  and scanning electron microscopy, and their development compared with that of 47  normal embryos. The extirpated mesencephalic region was repopulated by crest  cells within 6-8 hours after operation. These 'new' crest cells migrated from  adjacent neuraxial levels (principally the metencephalon and prosencephalon)  along the basement membrane of the neural tube and the regenerating ectoderm. At  prosencephalic and metencephalic levels, both intrinsic hyperplasia of migrating  cells and prolonged migration of crest cells from the dorsomedian part of the  neural tube contributed the additional cells required to repopulate the  mesencephalic region. Morphogenesis and differentiation of all crest cell  derivatives were normal and craniofacial malformations were absent. Thus the  neural crest and neural tube can compensate for an extensive regional loss,  premigratory crest cells are neither regionally patterned nor determined (as  prosencephalic and metencephalic cells give rise to normal mesencephalic  derivatives) and regional failure of crest cell formation is an unlikely facial  pathogenetic mechanism. Previous workers who observed facial malformations  following crest cell extirpations performed the latter by removing the lips of  the neural tube which not only removed the crest cells but also the compensatory  mechanism. Cervical scoliosis was observed in extirpated embryos but not in  controls. The pathogenesis of this scoliosis may be related to the process of  compensation, which could disturb the sequential differentiation of the neural  tube and so disorganise the mechanisms of normal axial flexion. These  observations may be relevant to the pathogenesis of some forms of congenital and  infantile idiopathic scoliosis; such scoliosis in man is frequently present in  neurofibromatosis--a neural crest lesion.

Author information: (1)Mammalian Genetics Laboratory, ABL-Basic Research Program, NCI-Frederick  Cancer Research and Development Center, Maryland 21702, USA.  Evi-2, a common site of viral integration in BXH-2 myeloid lymphomas, is located  within a large intron of the Nf1 tumor suppressor gene. Viral integration at  Evi-2 appears to induce disease by disrupting normal Nf1 expression. During our  attempts to characterize the nature of the proviruses located at Evi-2, we found  that approximately half of the proviruses were defective nonecotropic proviruses  (A. M. Buchberg, H. G. Bedigian, N. A. Jenkins, and N. G. Copeland, Mol. Cell.  Biol. 10:4658-4666, 1990). This was surprising, since most proviruses  characterized at other BXH-2 common integration sites are full-length ecotropic  viruses. In the studies described here, we found that this defective provirus  carries two large deletions, one in pol and one in env, and is structurally  related to another murine retrovirus, the murine AIDS retrovirus. By using  oligonucleotide probes specific for this defective provirus, designated MRV, we  showed that MRV-related proviruses are carried as endogenous germ line  proviruses in most inbred strains. In addition, we identified the endogenous MRV  provirus that gives rise to the defective proviruses identified at Evi-2. We  present a model that accounts for the positive selection of MRV proviruses at  Evi-2, which may allow selective identification of common viral integration  sites harboring tumor suppressor genes.

Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands.  The product of the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene is a  595-amino-acid protein bearing resemblance to a family of band-4.1-related  proteins. These proteins, including ezrin, radixin, and moesin, probably  function as molecular linking proteins, connecting the cytoskeleton to the cell  membrane. On the grounds of the homology to the ezrin, radixin, and moesin  proteins and on the basis of its predicted secondary structure, the NF2 protein  is also thought to act as a cytoskeleton-cell membrane linking protein. Using  monoclonal antibodies to amino- and carboxyl-terminal synthetic NF2 peptides we  demonstrate the co-localization of the NF2 protein with elements of the  cytoskeleton in a COS cell model system and in cultured human cells.  Furthermore, the presence of the NF2 protein in tissue sections is shown. The  monoclonal antibodies specifically stain smooth muscle cells and the stratum  granulosum of the human epidermis. In cultured smooth muscle cells the NF2  protein co-localizes with actin stress fibers. Immunoelectron microscopy  demonstrates the presence of the NF2 protein associated with keratohyalin  granules and to a lesser extent with intermediate filaments in the human  epidermis. We conclude that the NF2 protein is indeed associated with multiple  elements of the cytoskeleton.  PMCID: PMC1869530 PMID: 7485397 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",True,Parse error - defaulted to include

The histogenesis of dural-based or ""central"" hemangiopericytomas (cHPCs) remains  controversial. Some authors consider these tumors variants of meningiomas while  others consider them akin to peripheral hemangiopericytomas (pHPCs). Meningiomas  frequently have mutations in the neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) gene, providing a  molecular marker for meningiomas and other NF2-related tumors. We therefore  analyzed the NF2 gene in cHPCs, pHPCs, and meningiomas to determine whether  cHPCs are more similar at the molecular genetic level to meningiomas or pHPCs.  Using paraffin-embedded archival material from 28 cHPCs (including three primary  and recurrent tumors), 10 pHPCs, and 26 meningiomas, we scanned all 17 exons of  the NF2 gene and flanking intronic sequences for mutations with single strand  conformation polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing. No NF2 mutations were  found in either cHPCs or pHPCs, whereas 35% of meningiomas had NF2 gene  alterations (P < 0.001). The NF2 gene mutations in meningiomas were all  truncating mutations, consistent with previous studies. Our findings suggest  that cHPCs are distinct from meningiomas at the molecular genetic level and  support prior clinico-pathological data that distinguish these tumor-entities.

The neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene encodes a protein, neurofibromin,  containing GTPase-activating protein-related domain (GRD) that stimulates  intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras protein. By screening a randomly mutagenized  NF1-GRD library in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we isolated two NF1-GRD mutants  (NF201 and NF204) with single amino acid substitutions, which suppress the heat  shock-sensitive phenotype of the RAS2(G19V) mutant. The NF1-GRD mutants also  suppress the oncogenic Ras-induced transformation of NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts  (Nakafuku, M., Nagamine, M., Ohtoshi, A., Tanaka, K., Toh-e, A., and Kaziro, Y.  (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90, 6706-6710). In this paper, we  investigated the molecular mechanism of inhibition of the transforming  Ras-specific function by the NF1-GRD mutants in mammalian cells. In human  embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, the mutant NF1-GRDs attenuated the stimulation  of mitogen-activated protein kinase by Ras(G12V), but not by platelet-derived  growth factor. In cell-free systems, purified recombinant NF1-GRD mutants showed  an inhibitory effect on the association of Ras.guanosine  5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) with Raf at several times lower  concentrations than the wild type. Furthermore, it was revealed that the binding  affinity of the mutant NF1-GRDs toward Ras.GTP gamma S is approximately 5-10  times higher than the wild type. These results suggest that the mutant NF1-GRDs  tightly bind to an oncogenic Ras in its GTP-bound active conformation and block  the interaction between Ras and its effector, Raf.

Gutmann DH(1), Tennekoon GI, Cole JL, Collins FS, Rutkowski JL.  Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor.  Neurofibromin, the product of the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene, is a  approximately 250 kDa protein expressed predominantly in cortical neurons and  oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) and sensory neurons and  Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). To gain insight into the  biological role of neurofibromin in Schwann cells, the modulation of NF1 gene  expression in a Schwann cell line (MT4H1) stimulated to either proliferate or  differentiate in response to agents that elevate intracellular cAMP was  examined. Untreated cells and cells exposed to mitogenic doses of forskolin  (1-10 microM) or 8-bromo-cAMP (0.1 mM) expressed low levels of NF1 mRNA and the  protein was barely detectable. High doses of forskolin (100 microM) or  8-bromo-cAMP (1 mM) induced the expression of both myelin P0 protein and  neurofibromin with an identical time course. Although NF1 mRNA levels peaked  within 1-6 hr, the rise in neurofibromin was not apparent until 24-48 hr and  peaked 72 hr after treatment. P0 and neurofibromin were also coinduced by  cell-cell contact in high density, untreated cultures. Moreover, differentiation  initiated by either cAMP stimulation or high density culture conditions was  associated with predominant expression of the type 2 NF1 mRNA isoform. In  contrast, type 1 NF1 mRNA isoform expression was observed in untreated Schwann  cells or those stimulated with mitogenic doses of forskolin or 8-bromo-cAMP.

Suzuki H(1), Takahashi K, Shibahara S.  Author information: (1)Department of Applied Physiology and Molecular Biology, Tohoku University  School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant disorder,  primarily affecting cells of neural crest origin, and is characterized by  café-au-lait skin spots, multiple neurofibromas, and higher incidence of  malignancy. A gene linked to NF1 encodes neurofibromin, an established function  of which is to stimulate intrinsic GTPase activity of ras protein. The  neurofibromin gene gives rise to multiple transcripts generated by alternative  splicing, that encode various neurofibromin isoforms. In this study, we have  cloned a cDNA encoding a newly identified species of a putative amino-terminal  isoform which lacks a large portion of neurofibromin, including the domain  related to GTPase-activating protein. This clone carries the insert of 2.7 kb,  coding for a protein of 593 amino acid residues, tentatively termed N-isoform  11, whose amino-terminal 574 residues are identical to those of authentic  neurofibromin encoded by the eleven exons located at the 5' portion of the gene.  Previously, we cloned a cDNA coding for a similar isoform of 551 amino acid  residues, termed N-isoform 10, whose amino-terminal portion is encoded by the  first ten exons. The molecular weights of these two deduced N-isoforms are  consistent with the values determined by in vitro translation of the mRNA  transcribed from each N-isoform cDNA. The presence of the amino-terminal  isoform(s) suggests the physiological significance of the amino-terminal portion  of neurofibromin.

Largaespada DA(1), Shaughnessy JD Jr, Jenkins NA, Copeland NG.  Author information: (1)Mammalian Genetics Laboratory, NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development  Center, Maryland 21702, USA.  Approximately 15% of BXH-2 myeloid leukemias harbor proviral integrations at the  Evi-2 common viral integration site. Evi-2 is located within a large intron of  the Nf1 tumor suppressor gene, raising the possibility that proviral integration  at Evi-2 predisposes mice to myeloid tumor development by disrupting Nf1  expression. This hypothesis is supported by data suggesting that mutations in  the human NF1 gene are causally associated with the development of juvenile  chronic myelogenous leukemia (K. M. Shannon, P. O'Connell, G. A. Martin, D.  Paderanga, K. Olson, P. Dinndorf, and F. McCormick, N. Engl. J. Med.  330:597-601, 1994) and mouse studies showing that aged mice, heterozygous for a  germ line Nf1 mutation, develop myeloid leukemia with loss of the wild-type Nf1  allele (T. Jacks, T. S. Shih, E. M. Schmitt, R. T. Bronson, A. Bernards, and R.  A. Weinberg, Nat. Genet. 7:353-361, 1994). To determine if viral integration at  Evi-2 disrupts Nf1 expression, we derived a series of BXH-2 myeloid leukemia  cell lines with or without viral integrations at Evi-2. In all cell lines  examined, viral integration at Evi-2 resulted in the production of only  truncated Nf1 transcripts and no stable, full-length neurofibromin. Although  neurofibromin is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for p21ras proteins, its loss  in the BXH-2 leukemic cell lines was not correlated with an increased  steady-state level of p21ras bound to GTP. These data suggest that neurofibromin  is not the sole mediator of Ras-GAP activity in myeloid cells and may have a  GAP-independent function in myeloid cells.

Mutations at the neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) locus in humans and mice result in  abnormal growth of neural crest-derived cells, including melanocytes and Schwann  cells. We have exploited a targeted disruption of the NF1 gene in mice to  examine the role of neurofibromin in the acquisition of neurotrophin dependence  in embryonic neurons. We show that both neural crest- and placode-derived  sensory neurons isolated from NF1(-/-) embryos develop, extend neurites, and  survive in the absence of neurotrophins, whereas their wild-type counterparts  die rapidly unless nerve growth factor (NGF) or brain-derived neurotrophic  factor (BDNF) is added to the culture medium. Moreover, NF1 (-/-) sympathetic  neurons survive for extended periods and acquire mature morphology in the  presence of NGF-blocking antibodies. Our results are consistent with a model  wherein neurofibromin acts as a negative regulator of neurotrophin-mediated  signaling for survival of embryonic peripheral neurons.

Maraia RJ(1), Driscoll CT, Bilyeu T, Hsu K, Darlington GJ.  Author information: (1)Laboratory of Molecular Growth Regulation, National Institute of Child Health  and Human Development, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.  Alu repeats are short interspersed elements (SINEs) of dimeric structure whose  transposition sometimes leads to heritable disorders in humans. Human cells  contain a poly(A)- small cytoplasmic transcript of -120 nucleotides (nt)  homologous to the left Alu monomer. Although its monomeric size indicates that  small cytoplasmic Alu (scAlu) RNA is not an intermediary of human Alu  transpositions, a less abundant poly(A)-containing Alu transcript of dimeric  size and specificity expected of a transposition intermediary is also detectable  in HeLa cells (A. G. Matera, U. Hellmann, M. F. Hintz, and C. W. Schmid, Mol.  Cell. Biol. 10:5424-5432, 1990). Although its function is unknown, the  accumulation of Alu RNA and its ability to interact with a conserved protein  suggest a role in cell biology (D.-Y. Chang and R. J. Maraia, J. Biol. Chem.  268:6423-28, 1993). The relationship between the -120- and -300-nt Alu  transcripts had not been determined. However, a B1 SINE produces scB1 RNA by  posttranscriptional processing, suggesting a similar pathway for scAlu. An Alu  SINE which recently transposed into the neurofibromatosis 1 locus was expressed  in microinjected frog oocytes. This neurofibromatosis 1 Alu produced a primary  transcript followed by the appearance of the scAlu species. 3' processing of a  synthetic -300-nt Alu RNA by HeLa nuclear extract in vitro also produced scAlu  RNA. Primer extension of scAlu RNA indicates synthesis by RNA polymerase III.  HeLa-derived scAlu cDNAs were cloned so as to preserve their 5'-terminal  sequences and were found to correspond to polymerase III transcripts of the left  monomeric components of three previously identified Alu SINE subfamilies. Rodent  x human somatic cell hybrids express Alu RNAs whose size, heterogeneous length,  and chromosomal distribution indicate their derivation from SINEs. The  coexpression of dimeric and monomeric Alu RNA in several hybrids suggests a  precursor-product relationship.

Author information: (1)Department of Neuropathology, University of Bonn, Germany.  There is evidence from cytogenetic and loss of heterozygosity studies for the  involvement of a tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 22 in the formation of  meningiomas. Recently, the NF2 gene, which causes neurofibromatosis type 2 and  which is located in the affected region on chromosome 22, has been identified. A  previous study on 8 of the 17 exons of the NF2 gene described mutations in 16%  of meningiomas. We have analyzed the entire coding region of the NF2 gene in 70  sporadic meningiomas and identified 43 mutations in 41 patients. These resulted  predominantly in immediate truncation, splicing abnormalities, or an altered  reading frame of the predicted protein product. Although there was no evidence  for distinct hotspots, all mutations occurred in the first 13 exons, the region  of homology with the filopodial proteins moesin, ezrin, and radixin. The  association of loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 22 with mutations in the NF2  gene was significant. These data suggest that NF2 represents the meningioma  locus on chromosome 22. NF2 mutations occurred significantly more frequently in  fibroblastic meningioma (70%) and transitional meningioma (83%) than in  meningiothelial meningioma (25%), thus indicating a differential molecular  pathogenesis of these meningioma variants.

Armendariz-Borunda J(1), Simkevich CP, Roy N, Raghow R, Kang AH, Seyer JM.  Author information: (1)VA Medical Center Research Service, Memphis, TN 28104.  Activation of liver Ito cells is characterized by increased proliferation,  fibrogenesis, loss of cellular retinoid and change of cell-shape. Here, we have  described fundamental differences between freshly isolated Ito cells (FIC) and  long-term cultured Ito cells (LTIC). This process of activation correlates with  the absence of expression of Pro alpha 1(I) gene in FIC. LTIC expressed abundant  transcripts of Pro alpha 1(I) gene. Nuclear run-off experiments showed the  inability of FIC to support Pro alpha 1(I) RNA transcription while LTIC  transcribed it greater than 5-fold as compared with FIC. Transforming growth  factor beta (TGF beta)-treated LTIC had a preferential increase in the rate of  Pro alpha 1(I) gene transcription as compared with control LTIC. A human  collagen type I promoter-enhancer construct (pCOL-KT) [Thompson, Simkevich,  Holness, Kang and Raghow (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 2549-2556] was readily  expressed in LTIC but failed to be expressed in FIC. Furthermore, TGF beta  treatment of LTIC resulted in an increased expression of pCOL-KT. The deletion  of an activator protein-1 (AP-1) binding site (+598 to +604) in the 360 bp  enhancer region of pCOL-KT (S360) caused decreased expression of the CAT  reporter gene, suggesting that this bonafide AP-1 site can, at least in part,  mediate the transactivation effect of TGF beta. Using DNAase I protection, we  demonstrate a single foot-print located at +590 to +625 in the S360 fragment;  nuclear extracts prepared from TGF beta-treated LTIC exhibited greater activity  of these AP-1 binding proteins. Gel mobility assays corroborated and extended  the footprinting observation. No AP-1-binding activity was found in the nuclear  extracts of FIC. Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the consensus AP-1  motif were able to compete out the binding; consensus NF-1 motif  oligonucleotides failed to do so. The preincubation of nuclear extracts from  control and TGF beta-treated LTIC with antibodies against c-jun and c-fos  rendered a reduced binding of AP-1 proteins to the target S360 fragment.

Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.  The gene for the hereditary disorder neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), which  predisposes for benign CNS tumors such as vestibular schwannomas and  meningiomas, has been assigned to chromosome 22 and recently has been isolated.  Mutations in the NF2 gene were found in both sporadic meningiomas and vestibular  schwannomas. However, so far only 6 of the 16 exons of the gene have been  analyzed. In order to extend the analysis of an involvement of the NF2 gene in  the sporadic counterparts of these NF2-related tumors, we have used reverse  transcriptase-PCR amplification followed by SSCP and DNA sequence analysis to  screen for mutations in the coding region of the NF2 gene. Analysis of the NF2  gene transcript in 53 unrelated patients with meningiomas and vestibular  schwannomas revealed mutations in 32% of the sporadic meningiomas (n = 44), in  50% of the sporadic vestibular schwannomas (n = 4), in 100% of the tumors found  in NF2 patients (n = 2), and in one of three tumors from multiple-meningioma  patients. Of the 18 tumors in which a mutation in the NF2 gene transcript was  observed and the copy number of chromosome 22 could be established, 14 also  showed loss of (parts of) chromosome 22. This suggests that in sporadic  meningiomas and NF2-associated tumors the NF2 gene functions as a recessive  tumor-suppressor gene. The mutations detected resulted mostly in frameshifts,  predicting truncations starting within the N-terminal half of the putative  protein.

Allele loss of APC, DCC, p53 and RB1 in colorectal tumours has  been reported previously using a variety of methods. However, not all workers  used intragenic markers. We have used microsatellite polymorphisms which map  within, or are closely linked to, these tumour-suppressor gene loci in order to  determine whether these loci are indeed the targets for alteration in colorectal  cancer. In addition, we have assayed two other tumour-suppressor genes, WT1 and  NF1, to see whether they play a role in colorectal carcinogenesis. The putative  metastasis-suppressor gene, NM23, was also investigated since there have been  conflicting reports about its involvement in colorectal carcinogenesis. Allele  loss was detected at the DCC (29%), p53 (66%), RB1 (50%) and NF1 (14%) loci and  in the APC/MCC region (50%), but not at the WT1 or NM23 loci. These rapid, and  mostly gene-specific, fluorescent multiplex PCR assays for allele loss detection  could be modified to devise a single molecular diagnostic test for the important  lesions in colorectal cancer.

Kalra R(1), Paderanga DC, Olson K, Shannon KM.  Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco.  Children with neurofibromatosis, type 1 (NF-1) are at increased risk of  developing malignant myeloid disorders and their bone marrows frequently show  loss of the normal allele of the NF1 tumor-suppressor gene. NF1 encodes a  protein called neurofibromin, which accelerates guanosine triphosphate (GTP)  hydrolysis on the p21ras (Ras) family of signaling proteins. We used a genetic  approach to test the hypothesis that NF1 negatively regulates myeloid cell  growth through its effect on Ras. This model predicts that, if RAS mutations and  loss of NF1 function deregulate myeloid growth by the same biomechanical  mechanism, then activating RAS mutations will be restricted to children with  malignant myeloid disorders who do not have NF-1. We studied 71 children,  including 28 with bone marrow monosomy 7 syndrome (Mo7), 35with juvenile chronic  myelogenous leukemia (JCML), three with other forms of preleukemia, and five  with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), for activating mutations of KRAS and  NRAS. The incidence of RAS mutations was 21% (12 of 55) in patients without NF-1  and 0% (zero of 16) in children with NF-1 (P = .04). Among the 55 patients who  did not have NF-1, we found RAS mutations in four of 27 with Mo 7, in five of 24  with JCML, in two of 3 with AML, and in a patient with myeloproliferative  syndrome (MPS). These data from primary human cancer cells provide strong  genetic evidence that NF1 limits the growth of myeloid cells by regulating Ras.

The gene for type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF1) is most highly expressed in brain  and spinal cord, although low levels of mRNA can be found in nearly all tissues.  As a first step in investigating the regulation of NF1 gene expression, we have  cloned and sequenced the promoter regions of the human and mouse NF1 genes and  mapped the transcriptional start sites in both species. We report here that the  5' ends of the human and murine NF1 genes are highly conserved. While no  discernable TATA or CCAAT box sequences are seen, transcription initiates at  identical sites in both species, 484 nucleotides upstream of the ATG initiation  codon in the human gene. The human and mouse NF1 genes share particularly high  sequence homology (95%) between nucleotides -33 and +261 and contain several  perfectly conserved transcription factor binding site motifs, including a cAMP  response element, several AP2 consensus binding sites, and a serum response  element. The high conservation of these sequences indicates that they are likely  to be significant in the regulation of NF1 gene expression.

Author information: (1)Department of Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Auburn  University, AL 36849-5519.  Neurofibromatosis in cattle is typically a noncutaneous disease. A small group  of cows in a Holstein dairy herd developed cutaneous neurofibromatosis. This  unique condition was investigated and compared with neurofibromatosis type 1  (NF1) in humans. All cutaneous lesions but one were consistent with  neurofibromas in noncutaneous sites in cattle and neurofibromas in patients with  NF1. One bovine lesion was classified as a neurofibrosarcoma.  Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy supported Schwannian  differentiation in benign and malignant lesions. Linkage analysis with a  polymorphism in the bovine NF1 gene confirmed that two affected animals from the  same sire inherited the same paternal NF1 allele. Bovine cutaneous  neurofibromatosis is a naturally occurring disease in this group of animals,  characterized by skin tumors morphologically identical to those of NF1. An  informative polymorphism at the NF1 locus of two animals and their sire suggests  this disorder may be caused by hereditary mutations at the bovine NF1 locus.

PURPOSE: To investigate the evolution of deeply located high-signal-intensity  abnormalities of the brain on T2-weighted MR images of patients with  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1). METHODS: The study consists of two patient groups: 1) retrospective evaluation  of MR scans of 24 symptomatic NF-1 patients, 10 of whom were sequentially  studied, and 2) prospective MR evaluations of 20 asymptomatic NF-1 subjects from  14 families; 2 of these families were sequentially studied. RESULTS: Deeply located, high-signal-intensity abnormalities on T2-weighted  images were noted in 34 of 44 NF-1 subjects (77%). If NF-1 patients are grouped  according to age, 28 of 30 subjects (93%) younger than 15 years had the lesions,  whereas 4 of 7 subjects (57%) between 16 and 30 years, and 2 of 7 subjects (29%)  older than 31 years had lesions. High-signal lesions in basal ganglia and brain  stem were demonstrated in all decades with relatively high frequency. Lesions in  the cerebellar white matter and dentate nuclei were mainly found in the patients  younger than 10 years, and never found after the third decade. In 13 sequential  studies (mean interval, 24 months), lesions appeared to increase in size in 3,  remain unchanged in size in 2, and decrease in size in 7. One subject showed a  mixed pattern of lesion size change. CONCLUSIONS: Deeply located high-signal-intensity lesions on T2-weighted MR  images are more evident in young NF-1 patients. The underlying brain  abnormality, while pathologically unproved, is probably transient.  PMCID: PMC8334401 PMID: 7985572 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",True,Parse error - defaulted to include

To characterize mitogens that might contribute to Schwann cell proliferation  during development or in tumors, we tested the ability of hepatocyte growth  factor (HGF) to stimulate Schwann cell division in vitro. HGF is a potent  mitogen for purified rat Schwann cells; DNA synthesis in rat Schwann cells was  stimulated 20-40-fold by 3-10 ng/ml HGF. Rat Schwann cells express c-met mRNA,  encoding the HGF receptor, but not HGF mRNA, implying that HGF might act as a  paracrine Schwann cell growth factor. HGF-stimulated Schwann cell proliferation  differs from that of previously described Schwann cell mitogens in that its  activity is abolished by forskolin and is not inhibited or potentiated by  addition of transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) or fibroblast growth  factor (FGF). HGF is probably not a component of the axonal signal thought to  cause Schwann cell division during development, as anti-HGF neutralizing  antibodies failed to block neuron-stimulated Schwann cell proliferation. In  contrast, mitogenic activity present in normal human adult nerves and in  neurofibromas from patients with type 1 neurofibromatosis analyzed in the  absence of forskolin is largely inhibitable by anti-HGF. Thus, HGF is a novel  mitogen for Schwann cells in vitro and it is present in Schwann cell tumors,  suggesting a potential role for HGF after wounding of peripheral nerves or in  tumor growth.

Fye KH, Jacobs RP, Roe RL.  A casual relationship between von Recklinghausen's disease, or  neurofibromatosis, and arteriolar abnormalities has been reported in the  European literature. A patient was seen who had biopsy-proved neurofibromatosis  and renovascular hypertension and retroperitoneal bleeding. An arteriographic  study showed multiple small aneurysms throughout the coeliac axis, the superior  mesenteric artery and in several small intrarenal vessels. Renal vein renin  levels were elevated particularly in the right renal vein, supporting the  diagnosis of renovascular hypertension. Both the aneurysms seen in angiographic  studies and the retroperitoneal hemorrhage are probably vascular manifestations  of von Recklinghausen's disease. Support for this conclusion is enhanced by the  absence of clinical, laboratory or histologic data supporting the only tenable  differential diagnosis, periarteritis nodosa.

Schroeder WT(1), Stewart-Galetka S, Mandavilli S, Parry DA, Goldsmith L, Duvic  M.  Author information: (1)Department of Dermatology, University of Texas Medical School, Houston 77030.  We report here the isolation and characterization of a cDNA that encodes a novel  extracellular epidermal molecule, epidermal surface antigen (ESA), which is  thought to play a role in intercellular epidermal adhesion. Sequence analysis  reveals that the 379 amino acid ESA has a molecular mass of about 41.7 kDa and  an alpha-helix-rich secondary conformation. Much of this also has an heptad  substructure, consistent with the formation of several bundles of alpha-helices  in a compact globular structure. The ESA protein appears to consist of an  NH2-terminal hydrophobic region with mixed alpha and beta structure followed by  a more hydrophilic COOH-terminal region which is very rich in alpha-helix. The  2.5-kilobase ESA mRNA is expressed in cultured keratinocytes, melanocytes,  fibroblasts, carcinoma, and melanoma cell lines. The ESA gene is conserved in  all mammalian species examined and has been localized to human chromosome 17  (M17S1) in the same region as the gene for von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis.  The high level of expression of the ESA mRNA in human skin and in cultured cells  derived from the epidermis, the appearance of ESA protein early in human  development, and conservation of the ESA gene throughout mammalian evolution  suggest that the novel ESA protein plays a vital role in epidermal structure and  maintenance.

Tikoo A(1), Varga M, Ramesh V, Gusella J, Maruta H.  Author information: (1)Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria,  Australia.  Previously, we have cloned a candidate for the 595-amino acid neurofibromatosis  type 2 tumor suppressor called NF2 or Merlin, with striking sequence similarity  in its N-terminal half to an F-actin-binding protein family called TERM, which  includes talin, ezrin, radixin, and moesin (Trofatter, J. A., MacCollin, M. M.,  Rutter, J. L., Murrell, J. R., Duyao, M. P., Parry, D. M., Eldridge, R., Kley,  N., Menon, A. G., Pulaski, K., Haase, V. H., Ambrose, C. M., Munro, D., Bove,  C., Haines, J. L., Martuza, R. L., MacDonald, M. E., Seizinger, B. R., Short, M.  P., Buckler, A. J., and Gusella, J. F. (1993) Cell 72, 791-800). In an attempt  to determine whether NF2 serves as a tumor suppressor and if so whether its  N-terminal half is involved in its anti-oncogenicity, both full-length NF2 and  its N-terminal half (NF2-N, residues 9-359) have been expressed in  v-Ha-Ras-transformed NIH/3T3 cells. Like neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)  fragments (Nur-E-Kamal, M. S. A., Varga, M., and Maruta, H. (1993) J. Biol.  Chem. 268, 22331-22337), full-length NF2 can reverse the Ras-induced malignant  phenotype, i.e. anchorage-independent growth in a soft agar, and restore contact  inhibition of cell growth, indicating that NF2 is indeed a tumor suppressor.  Furthermore, NF2-N also suppresses the Ras-induced malignant phenotype, although  it appears to be less effective than the full-length NF2. These observations  indicate that the anti-Ras function of NF2 resides in part in its N-terminal  half. Thus, NF2 appears to be a new member of the tumor suppressor family of  actin-cytoskeleton-associated proteins, which includes vinculin, alpha-actinin,  tropomyosin-1, gelsolin, and tensin.

Jorde LB(1), Watkins WS, Viskochil D, O'Connell P, Ward K.  Author information: (1)Department of Human Genetics, University of Utah Health Sciences Center, Salt  Lake City 84112.  To test the usefulness of linkage disequilibrium for gene mapping, we compared  physical distances and linkage disequilibrium among eight RFLPs in the  neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) region. Seven of the polymorphisms span most of the  NF1 gene, while the remaining polymorphism lies approximately 70 kb 3' to a stop  codon in exon 49. By using Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH)  kindreds, 91-110 unrelated parents were genotyped. A high degree of  disequilibrium is maintained among the seven intragenic polymorphisms (r > .82,  P < 10(-7)), even though they are separated by as much as 340 kb. The 3'  polymorphism is only 68 kb distal to the next polymorphism, but disequilibrium  between the 3' polymorphism and all others is comparatively low (magnitude of 4  < .33, P values .27-.001). This result was replicated in three sets of unrelated  kindreds: the Utah CEPH families, the non-Utah CEPH families, and an independent  set of NF1 families. Trigenic, quadrigenic, three-locus, and four-locus  disequilibrium measures were also estimated. There was little evidence of  higher-order linkage disequilibrium. As expected for a disease with multiple  mutations, no disequilibrium was observed between the disease gene and any of  the RFLPs. The observed pattern of high disequilibrium within the gene and a  loss of disequilibrium 3' to the stop codon could have implications for gene  mapping studies. These are discussed, and guidelines for linkage disequilibrium  studies are suggested.  PMCID: PMC1682302 PMID: 8105688 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",True,Parse error - defaulted to include

Malhotra R(1), Ratner N.  Author information: (1)Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of Cincinnati College of  Medicine, Ohio 45267-0521.  Pigmentation defects are common in the inherited disease type 1  neurofibromatosis (NF1), predicting a role for the NF1 gene product,  neurofibromin, in the skin. We used immunohistochemistry to determine the  distribution of neurofibromin in normal developing and adult rat skin, normal  neonatal and adult human skin, and skin from patients affected with NF1. The  distribution of NF1 mRNA in the epidermis was also analyzed by in situ  hybridization. NF1 mRNA and neurofibromin are highly enriched in the  keratinocytes in the stratum spinosum of the epidermis in the embryonic, but not  adult, rat and in both neonatal and adult humans. Immunoelectron microscopic  analysis confirmed that neurofibromin is associated with the keratinocyte plasma  membrane, particularly adjacent to desmosomes. Neurofibromin is also detectable  in human melanocytes. Analysis of skin from NF1 patients showed normal  neurofibromin expression in nine of ten hyperpigmented cafe-au-lait macules and  in adjacent unaffected skin. We conclude that 1) neurofibromin expression in the  perinatal rat closely parallels expression in the human; 2) reduction in  detectable neurofibromin cannot be used to distinguish NF1 and normal human  skin; and 3) neurofibromin might function in keratinocytes, as well as  melanocytes.

Gutmann DH(1), Cole JL, Collins FS.  Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor.  Neurofibromin, the protein product of the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene,  has two alternate isoforms which are generated by alternative splicing of two  exons. One of these isoforms containing exon 48a is expressed at highest levels  in muscle. Since neurofibromin is a p21-ras regulator and has been recently  shown to be modulated during Schwann cell differentiation, we examined the  expression of the NF1 gene product during in vitro muscle differentiation.  Previous work demonstrated that C2C12 murine myoblast cell differentiation could  be blocked by the introduction of an activated p21-ras protein. Using this model  system, we demonstrate that differentiating C2C12 cells upregulate the  expression of NF1 mRNA by 2 days of serum starvation concomitant with increased  expression of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor mRNA. This upregulation of mRNA  expression paralleled an increase in neurofibromin and N-ras levels, but no  change in the relative abundance of the isoforms containing exon 23a or exon 48a  was observed during in vitro myoblast differentiation. The increase in  neurofibromin levels paralleled a decrease in the levels of activated p21-ras as  assayed by in vivo 32P-orthophosphate incorporation into p21-ras. These results  suggest that in vitro C2C12 cell differentiation is associated with a  concomitant increase in NF1 gene expression and decrease in the proportion of  activated p21-ras.

Author information: (1)Molecular Medical Genetics Program, Children's Hospital of Western Ontario,  London, Canada.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common, autosomal dominant genetic disorder  with a variety of highly variable symptoms including cutaneous manifestations  (such as café au lait spots), Lisch nodules, plexiform neurofibromas, skeletal  abnormalities, an increased risk for malignancy, and the development of learning  disabilities. The wide clinical variability of expression of the disease  phenotype and high (spontaneous) mutation rate of the NF1 gene indicate that  careful clinical examination of patients and family members is necessary to  provide an accurate diagnosis of the disease. Since very few NF1 mutations have  been identified, and with the apparent lack of a predominant mutation in this  large, highly mutable gene, molecular diagnosis of NF1 will continue to be based  on haplotypes using linkage analysis. Here we report our experiences while  providing a molecular diagnostic service for NF1 in the ethnically diverse  region of south-western Ontario. Molecular diagnoses with at least one  informative probe/enzyme combination are reported for 19 families including two  families requesting prenatal diagnosis for NF1. We have augmented the classical  Southern based approach to linkage analysis with the use of PCR based assays for  molecular linkage. Furthermore, criteria have been established in our laboratory  for executing molecular linkage based on heterozygosity values, recombination  fractions, and the use of intragenic probes/markers.

Author information: (1)Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan  48109.  Sequence analysis has shown significant homology between the catalytic regions  of the mammalian ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP), yeast Ira1p and Ira2p  (inhibitory regulators of the RAS-cyclic AMP pathway), and neurofibromin, the  protein encoded by the NF1 gene. Yeast expression experiments have confirmed  that a 381-amino-acid segment of neurofibromin, dubbed the GAP-related domain  (GRD), can function as a GAP. Using the RNA polymerase chain reaction with  primers flanking the NF1-GRD, we have identified evidence for alternative  splicing in this region of the NF1 gene. In addition to the already published  sequence (type I), an alternative RNA carrying a 63-nucleotide insertion (type  II) is present in all tissues examined, although the relative amounts of types I  and II vary. The insertion is conserved across species but is not present in  GAP, IRA1, or IRA2. GenBank searches have failed to identify significant  similarity between the inserted sequence and known DNA or protein sequences,  although the basic amino acid composition of the insertion shares features with  nuclear targeting sequences. Expression studies in yeasts show that despite the  partial disruption of the neurofibromin-IRA-GAP homology by this insertion, both  forms of the NF1-GRD can complement loss of IRA function. In vivo assays  designed to compare the GAP activity of the two alternatively spliced forms of  the NF1-GRD show that both can increase the conversion of GTP-bound ras to its  GDP-bound form, although the insertion of the 21 amino acids weakens this  effect. The strong conservation of this alternative splicing suggests that both  type I and II isoforms mediate important biological functions of neurofibromin.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 is one of the most common inherited disorders with an  incidence of 1 in 3000. The search for NF1 mutations has been hampered by the  overall size of the gene, the large number of exons, and the high mutation rate.

We have  identified five new mutations using single strand conformation polymorphism  (SSCP) and heteroduplex analysis (HA) and three intragenic deletions with the  microsatellite markers. Of the five new mutations, two were in exon 27a, two in  exon 45, and one in exon 49 and these include 4630delA, 4572delC, R7846X,  T7828A, and one in the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR).

We have developed a potential model of Schwann cell tumor formation in  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). We show that mouse Schwann cells heterozygous or  null at Nf1 display angiogenic and invasive properties, mimicking the behavior  of Schwann cells from human neurofibromas. Mutations at Nf1 are insufficient to  promote Schwann cell hyperplasia. Here we show that Schwann cell hyperplasia can  be induced by protein kinase A activation in mutant cells. Removal of serum from  the culture medium also stimulates hyperplasia, but only in some mutant cells.  After serum removal, clones of hyperproliferating Schwann cells lose contact  with axons in vitro, develop growth factor-independent proliferation, and  exhibit decreased expression of the cell differentiation marker P0 protein;  hyperproliferating cells develop after a 1-week lag in Schwann cells  heterozygous at Nf1. The experiments suggest that events subsequent to Nf1  mutations are required for development of Schwann cell hyperplasia. Finally, an  anti-Ras farnesyl protein transferase inhibitor greatly diminished both clone  formation and hyperproliferation of null mutant cells, but not invasion;  farnesyl transferase inhibitors could be useful in treating benign  manifestations of NF1.

However, because the  screens performed to date primarily have generated autosomal P-element  insertions, this collection has not been as useful for performing reverse  genetic analysis of X-linked genes. We have designed a reverse genetic screen  that takes advantage of the hemizygosity of the X chromosome in males together  with a cosmid-based transgene that serves as an autosomally linked duplication  of a small region of the X chromosome. The efficacy and efficiency of this  method is demonstrated by the isolation of mutations in Drosophila homologues of  two well-studied genes, the human Neurofibromatosis 2 tumor suppressor and the  yeast CDC42 gene. The method we describe should be of general utility for the  isolation of mutations in other X-linked genes, and should also provide an  efficient method for the isolation of new allcles of existing X-linked or  autosomal mutations in Drosophila.

Author information: (1)Institut für Neuropathologie, Universitätsklinikum Bonn, Germany.  umt907@ibm.rhrz.uni-bonn.de  The specific analysis of gene transcripts is of increasing importance for  studies in molecular pathology. Competitive RT-PCR with mutagenized exogenous  competitor templates has evolved as an attractive approach to quantify  individual mRNA levels. The generation of exogenous competitor RNAs usually  requires mutagenesis and cloning of the mutant fragment into plasmids followed  by in vitro transcription. In contrast to primer directed mutagenesis and in  vitro transcription, preparation of the mutant fragments is a time consuming  procedure. Here we report on a modified semi-quantitative RT-PCR protocol to  circumvent the laborious cloning of mutant exogenous competitors. Templates for  the in vitro transcription are generated in a single PCR reaction with  simultaneous addition of a promoter sequence 5'of the forward primer and  deletion of 10-20 nucleotides at the opposite end just ahead of the reverse  primer binding site. The product of this PCR step serves as template for in  vitro transcription to yield exogenous competitor RNA of equal quality and  amount as conventional cloning strategies. Total RNA amounts are corrected for  by analyzing the expression of different housekeeping genes in the same manner.  One of the primers used in the following competitive RT-PCR reaction is labeled  with a fluorescent dye for the analysis of target and exogenous competitor  product on an semiautomated sequencer. In the present study, this protocol was  employed to analyze the expression of the PTCH, Fas-receptor, NF-1,  beta2-microglobulin and GAPD genes in human brain tumors. It will, however, be  widely applicable to studies on cellular transcripts in biological specimens.
