18525d0d-c13f-4a58-b41c-dc6ff1ef98e2,Nf1+/- mice,Animal Model,Immune System,"T cells from Nf1+/- mice showed enhanced proliferative responses and functional 
activity. Nf1+/- T cells were more hyperproliferative when stimulated with 
anti-CD3 compared to wild-type controls. In delayed-type hypersensitivity assays, 
Nf1+/- mice showed more pronounced ear thickness responses, higher cellularity 
in draining lymph nodes, and increased numbers of activated cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. 
This enhanced immune surveillance may explain the impaired malignant transformation 
observed in Nf1+/- mice.
