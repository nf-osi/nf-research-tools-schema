Background Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are a rare and heterogeneous group of soft tissue sarcomas (STSs), accounting for 3\u201310% of all STSs, with an incidence of approximately 0.001% in the general population [ 1 ,  2 ]. About half (40\u201350%) of MPNSTs occur in patients with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by mutations in the  NF1  gene [ 3 ,  4 ]. The remaining MPNSTs occur sporadically (40\u201347%) or at sites of prior radiation therapy (10\u201313%) [ 3 ,  5 ]. Despite these different clinical settings, the histology of MPNSTs is consistent across cases: fibrosarcoma-like fascicular spindle cell histological pattern, high hypercellularity and mitotic activity, cytologic atypia, and sites of tumor necrosis [ 6 ]. In the clinical context of NF1, MPNST commonly develops through a path initiating in a preexisting plexiform neurofibroma (pNF), a benign developmental tumor of the peripheral nervous system caused by the bi-allelic inactivation of the  NF1  gene in the Schwann cell lineage [ 7 ].  NF1  is a tumor suppressor gene (TSG) that regulates cell proliferation and survival through the negative regulation of the Ras/MAPK pathway [ 8 ]. Then, if  NF1 (-/-) pNF cells lose the  CDKN2A  locus, a premalignant discrete nodular lesion termed atypical neurofibroma (ANNUBPs) arises [ 9 \u2013 11 ]. Mutations in other TSGs, most commonly in components of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2),  SUZ12  or  EED  [ 12 ], and less frequently in the  TP53  gene [ 13 ,  14 ] are present only in MPNSTs and not in the preceding lesions. This core pattern of inactivated TSGs is the primary genetic hallmark of \u201cclassic\u201d MPNSTs [ 15 ,  16 ], along with histologic features such as loss of expression of the neural crest-Schwann cell differentiation axis markers S100B and SOX10, and tri-methylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3), a marker of PRC2 inactivation [ 17 ]. The clinical outcome of MPNST patients is poor, with an overall five-year survival rate of 50% [ 4 ], which is critically worsened in the event of recurrence or metastasis. Currently, the most effective treatment for MPNSTs is complete surgical resection with wide negative margins [ 18 ]. However, this strategy is often complicated by tumor size, location, and the presence of metastases [ 19 ,  20 ]. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy have shown limited efficacy, highlighting the need for better therapeutic approaches [ 21 ]. As such, preclinical models are critical for studying MPNST biology and testing new treatments [ 22 ,  23 ]. Cell lines provide a simple, cost-effective platform for in vitro preclinical research. However, due to the rarity of MPNSTs, especially in sporadic cases, there is a significant lack of established human cell lines, with only 44 currently listed in  Cellosaurus  (version 51, updated in December 2024) [ 23 ,  24 ].
