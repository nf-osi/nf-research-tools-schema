PMID:10339466,Myeloid malignancies induced by alkylating agents in Nf1 mice.,"Myeloid malignancies induced by alkylating agents in Nf1 mice.  Mahgoub N(1), Taylor BR, Le Beau MM, Gratiot M, Carlson KM, Atwater SK, Jacks T,  Shannon KM.  Author information: (1)Departments of Pediatrics and Laboratory Medicine, University of California,  San Francisco, CA, USA.  Therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (t-AML and  MDS) are severe late complications of treatment with genotoxic chemotherapeutic  agents. Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are predisposed to  malignant myeloid disorders that are associated with inactivation of the NF1  tumor suppressor gene in the leukemic clone. Recent clinical data suggest that  NF1 might be also associated with an increased risk of t-AML after treatment  with alkyating agents. To test this hypothesis, we administered cyclophosphamide  or etoposide to cohorts of wild-type and heterozygous Nf1 knockout mice.  Cyclophosphamide exposure cooperated strongly with heterozygous inactivation of  Nf1 in myeloid leukemogenesis, while etoposide did not. Somatic loss of the  normal Nf1 allele correlated with clinical disease and was more common in 129/Sv  mice than in 129/Sv x C57BL/6 animals. Leukemic cells showing loss of  heterozygosity at Nf1 retained a structural allele on each chromosome 11  homolog. These studies establish a novel in vivo model of alkylator-induced  myeloid malignancy that will facilitate mechanistic and translational studies.

PMID:10383727,"The Nf1 tumor suppressor regulates mouse skin wound healing, fibroblast proliferation, and collagen deposited by fibroblasts.","The Nf1 tumor suppressor regulates mouse skin wound healing, fibroblast  proliferation, and collagen deposited by fibroblasts.  Atit RP(1), Crowe MJ, Greenhalgh DG, Wenstrup RJ, Ratner N.  Author information: (1)Division of Biology, Children's Hospital Research Foundation, Cincinnati,  Ohio, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 patients develop peripheral nerve tumors  (neurofibromas) composed mainly of Schwann cells and fibroblasts, in an abundant  collagen matrix produced by fibroblasts. Trauma has been proposed to trigger  neurofibroma formation. To test if loss of the neurofibromatosis type 1 gene  (Nf1) compromises fibroblast function in vivo following trauma, skin wounding  was performed in Nf1 knockout mice. The pattern and amount of collagen-rich  granulation bed tissue, manufactured by fibroblasts, was grossly abnormal in 60%  of Nf1+/- wounds. Nf1 mutant fibroblasts showed cell autonomous abnormalities in  collagen deposition in vitro that were not mimicked by Ras activation in  fibroblasts, even though some Nf1 effects are mediated through Ras. Nf1+/- skin  wound fibroblasts also proliferated past the normal wound maturation phase; this  in vivo effect was potentiated by muscle injury. In vitro, Nf1+/- fibroblasts  showed higher proliferation in 10% serum than Nf1+/+ fibroblasts.  Macrophage-conditioned media or epidermal growth factor potentiated Nf1+/-  fibroblast proliferation in vitro, demonstrating abnormal response of mutant  fibroblasts to wound cytokines. Thus Nf1 is a key regulator of fibroblast  responses to injury, and Nf1 mutation in mouse fibroblasts causes abnormalities  characteristic of human neurofibromas.

PMID:10433955,Molecular genetic analysis of ependymal tumors. NF2 mutations and chromosome 22q loss occur preferentially in intramedullary spinal ependymomas.,"Molecular genetic analysis of ependymal tumors. NF2 mutations and chromosome 22q  loss occur preferentially in intramedullary spinal ependymomas.  Ebert C(1), von Haken M, Meyer-Puttlitz B, Wiestler OD, Reifenberger G, Pietsch  T, von Deimling A.  Author information: (1)Department of Neuropathology, University of Bonn Medical Center, Bonn  Charité, Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany.  Ependymal tumors are heterogeneous with regard to morphology, localization, age  at first clinical manifestation, and prognosis. Several molecular alterations  have been reported in these tumors, including allelic losses on chromosomes 10,  17, and 22 and mutations in the NF2 gene. However, in contrast to astrocytic  gliomas, no consistent molecular alterations have been associated with distinct  types of ependymal tumors. To evaluate whether morphological subsets of  ependymomas are characterized by specific genetic lesions, we analyzed a series  of 62 ependymal tumors, including myxopapillary ependymomas, subependymomas,  ependymomas, and anaplastic ependymomas, for allelic losses on chromosome arms  10q and 22q and mutations in the PTEN and NF2 genes. Allelic losses on 10q and  22q were detected in 5 of 56 and 12 of 54 tumors, respectively. Six ependymomas  carried somatic NF2 mutations, whereas no mutations were detected in the PTEN  gene. All six of the NF2 mutations occurred in ependymomas of WHO grade II and  were exclusively observed in tumors with a spinal localization (P = 0.0063).  These findings suggest that a considerable fraction of spinal ependymomas are  associated with molecular events involving chromosome 22 and that mutations in  the NF2 gene may be of primary importance for their genesis. Furthermore, our  data suggest that the more favorable clinical course of spinal ependymomas may  relate to a distinct pattern of genetic alterations different from that of  intracerebral ependymomas.

PMID:10567424,Interdomain interaction of merlin isoforms and its influence on intermolecular binding to NHE-RF.,"Interdomain interaction of merlin isoforms and its influence on intermolecular  binding to NHE-RF.  Gonzalez-Agosti C(1), Wiederhold T, Herndon ME, Gusella J, Ramesh V.  Author information: (1)Molecular Neurogenetics Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown,  Massachusetts 02129, USA.  Merlin, the neurofibromatosis 2 tumor suppressor protein, has two major isoforms  with alternate C termini and is related to the ERM (ezrin, radixin, moesin)  proteins. Regulation of the ERMs involves intramolecular and/or intermolecular  head-to-tail associations between family members. We have determined whether  merlin undergoes similar interactions, and our findings indicate that the C  terminus of merlin isoform 1 is able to associate with its N-terminal domain in  a head-to-tail fashion. However, the C terminus of isoform 2 lacks this  property. Similarly, the N terminus of merlin can also associate with C terminus  of moesin. We have also explored the effect of merlin self-association on  binding to the regulatory cofactor of Na(+)-H(+) exchanger (NHE-RF), an  interacting protein for merlin and the ERMs. Merlin isoform 2 captures more  NHE-RF than merlin isoform 1 in affinity binding assays, suggesting that in  full-length merlin isoform 1, the NHE-RF binding site is masked because of the  self-interactions of merlin. Treatment with a phospholipid known to decrease  self-association of ERMs enhances the binding of merlin isoform 1 to NHE-RF.  Thus, although isoform 1 resembles the ERM proteins, which transition between  inactive (closed) and active (open) states, isoform 2 is distinct, existing only  in the active (open) state and presumably constitutively more available for  interaction with other protein partners.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized  by increased incidence of benign and malignant tumors of neural crest origin.  Mutations that activate the protooncogene ras, such as loss of Nf1, cooperate  with inactivating mutations at the p53 tumor suppressor gene during malignant  transformation. One hundred percent of mice harboring null Nf1 and p53 alleles  in cis synergize to develop soft tissue sarcomas between 3 and 7 months of age.  These sarcomas exhibit loss of heterozygosity at both gene loci and express  phenotypic traits characteristic of neural crest derivatives and human NF1  malignancies.

PMID:10595915,Deletions of the INK4A gene occur in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors but not in neurofibromas.,"Deletions of the INK4A gene occur in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors  but not in neurofibromas.  Kourea HP(1), Orlow I, Scheithauer BW, Cordon-Cardo C, Woodruff JM.  Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York,  New York 10021, USA.  The INK4A gene, a candidate tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 9p21,  encodes two protein products, p16 and p19(ARF). p16 is a negative cell cycle  regulator capable of arresting cells in the G1 phase by inhibiting  cyclin-dependent kinases 4 (Cdk4) and 6 (Cdk6), thus preventing pRB  phosphorylation. p19(ARF) prevents Mdm2-mediated neutralization of p53. Loss of  INK4A is a frequent molecular alteration involved in the genesis of several  neoplasms, including tumors of neuroectodermal origin. This study investigated  the frequency of INK4A gene alterations in a series of malignant peripheral  nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) and neurofibromas (NFs). INK4A gene and the  p19(ARF)-specific exon 1beta were studied in 11 MPNST samples from 8 patients  and 7 neurofibromas. Presence of INK4A deletions was assessed by Southern  blotting hybridization and by a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR).  INK4A point mutations were examined by single-strand conformation polymorphism  (SSCP) and sequencing. The p16 promoter methylation status was determined by PCR  amplification of bisulfite-treated DNA. Homozygous deletions of exon 2, thus  affecting both p16 and p19(ARF), were identified in MPNSTs from 4 of 8 patients.  Deletions, mutations, or silencing by methylation were not identified in the  neurofibromas analyzed. Based on our results, we conclude that INK4A deletions  are frequent events in MPNSTs and may participate in tumor progression.  Silencing of p16 by methylation, which occurs often in several tumor types, is  uncommon in MPNSTs.

Kourea HP(1), Cordon-Cardo C, Dudas M, Leung D, Woodruff JM.  Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York,  New York, USA. kouma@otenet.gr  There is little information regarding the status of cell cycle regulators in  malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) and neurofibromas (NFs). In  this study, we investigated patterns of expression of p53 and pRB,  cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) p21 and p27, as well as cyclins D1 and  E, in a cohort of 35 well-characterized MPNSTs and 16 NFs. These phenotypes were  correlated with proliferative index, as assessed by Ki-67, as well as  clinicopathological parameters of poor outcome. p53 nuclear overexpression was  found in 10 of 35 (29%) MPNSTs, and it was lacking in NFs (P = 0.02). There were  no differences in the patterns of expression of pRB, cyclin D1, and p21 between  MPNSTs and NFs. However, p27 nuclear expression was present in most NFs, but it  was absent in the majority of MPNSTs, which displayed cytoplasmic staining (P <  0.001). Nuclear cyclin E expression was more pronounced in MPNSTs than in NFs.  We observed inverse patterns of expression for nuclear p27 and nuclear cyclin E  expression. The staining profiles of cytoplasmic p27 and nuclear cyclin E  expression were found to be statistically associated (P = 0.01). High Ki-67  expression was found in 20 of 34 (59%) MPNSTs but was absent in NFs (P < 0.001).  Furthermore, detection of cytoplasmic p27 expression was found to be a  prognostic factor for poor survival in MPNSTs (P = 0.03, relative risk = 2.4).

PMID:10620616,Genetic and biochemical evidence that haploinsufficiency of the Nf1 tumor suppressor gene modulates melanocyte and mast cell fates in vivo.,"Genetic and biochemical evidence that haploinsufficiency of the Nf1 tumor  suppressor gene modulates melanocyte and mast cell fates in vivo.  Ingram DA(1), Yang FC, Travers JB, Wenning MJ, Hiatt K, New S, Hood A, Shannon  K, Williams DA, Clapp DW.  Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine,  Indianapolis, Indiana 46202, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal-dominant disorder  characterized by cutaneous neurofibromas infiltrated with large numbers of mast  cells, melanocyte hyperplasia, and a predisposition to develop malignant  neoplasms. NF1 encodes a GTPase activating protein (GAP) for Ras. Consistent  with Knudson's ""two hit"" model of tumor suppressor genes, leukemias and  malignant solid tumors in NF1 patients frequently demonstrate somatic loss of  the normal NF1 allele. However, the phenotypic and biochemical consequences of  heterozygous inactivation of Nf1 are largely unknown. Recently neurofibromin,  the protein encoded by NF1, was shown to negatively regulate Ras activity in  Nf1-/- murine myeloid hematopoietic cells in vitro through the c-kit receptor  tyrosine kinase (dominant white spotting, W). Since the W and Nf1 locus appear  to function along a common developmental pathway, we generated mice with  mutations at both loci to examine potential interactions in vivo. Here, we show  that haploinsufficiency at Nf1 perturbs cell fates in mast cells in vivo, and  partially rescues coat color and mast cell defects in W(41) mice.  Haploinsufficiency at Nf1 also increased mast cell proliferation, survival, and  colony formation in response to Steel factor, the ligand for c-kit. Furthermore,  haploinsufficiency was associated with enhanced Ras-mitogen-activated protein  kinase activity, a major downstream effector of Ras, via wild-type and mutant  (W(41)) c-kit receptors. These observations identify a novel interaction between  c-kit and neurofibromin in vivo, and offer experimental evidence that  haploinsufficiency of Nf1 alters both cellular and biochemical phenotypes in two  cell lineages that are affected in individuals with NF1. Collectively, these  data support the emerging concept that heterozygous inactivation of tumor  suppressor genes may have profound biological effects in multiple cell types.

Author information: (1)Departments of Medicine and Pediatrics, Divisions of Hematology/Oncology,  Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL  35294-3300, USA. peter.emanuel@ccc.uab.edu  Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is an early childhood disease for which  there is no effective therapy. Therapy with 13-cis retinoic acid or low-dose  chemotherapy can induce some responses, but neither mode is curative. Stem cell  transplantation can produce lasting remissions but is hampered by high rates of  relapse. The pathogenesis of JMML involves deregulated cytokine signal  transduction through the Ras signaling pathway, with resultant selective  hypersensitivity of JMML cells to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating  factor (GM-CSF). A JMML mouse model, achieved through homozygous deletion of the  neurofibromatosis gene, confirmed the involvement of deregulated Ras in JMML  pathogenesis. With this pathogenetic knowledge, mechanism-based treatments are  now being developed and tested. Ras is critically dependent on a prenylation  reaction for its signal transduction abilities. Farnesyltransferase inhibitors  are compounds that were developed specifically to block the prenylation of Ras.  Two of these compounds, L-739,749 and L-744, 832, were tested for their ability  to inhibit spontaneous JMML granulocyte-macrophage colony growth. Within a dose  range of 1 to 10 micromol/L, each compound demonstrated dose-dependent  inhibition of JMML colony growth. An age-matched patient with a different  disease and GM-CSF-stimulated normal adult marrow cells also demonstrated  dose-dependent inhibitory effects on colony growth, but they were far less  sensitive to these compounds than JMML hematopoietic progenitors. Even if the  addition of L-739,749 were delayed for 5 days, significant inhibitory effects  would still show in JMML cultures. These results demonstrate that a putative  Ras-blocking compound can have significant growth inhibitory effects in vitro,  perhaps indicating a potential treatment for JMML.

PMID:10633134,A search for evidence of somatic mutations in the NF1 gene.,"A search for evidence of somatic mutations in the NF1 gene.  John AM(1), Ruggieri M, Ferner R, Upadhyaya M.  Author information: (1)Institute of Medical Genetics, University College of Medicine of Wales, Heath  Park, Cardiff CF4 4XN, UK.  Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder affecting 1 in  3000 people. The NF1 gene is located on chromosome 17q11.2, spans 350 kb of  genomic DNA, and contains 60 exons. A major phenotypic feature of the disease is  the widespread occurrence of benign dermal and plexiform neurofibromas. Genetic  and biochemical data support the hypothesis that NF1 acts as a tumour suppressor  gene. Molecular analysis of a number of NF1 specific tumours has shown the  inactivation of both NF1 alleles during tumourigenesis, in accordance with  Knudson's ""two hit"" hypothesis. We have studied 82 tumours from 45 NF1 patients.  Two separate strategies were used in this study to search for the somatic  changes involved in the formation of NF1 tumours. First, evidence of loss of  heterozygosity (LOH) of the NF1 gene region was investigated, and, second, a  screen for the presence of sequence alterations was conducted on a large panel  of DNA derived from matched blood/tumour pairs. In this study, the largest of  its kind to date, we found that 12% of the tumours (10/82) exhibited LOH;  previous studies have detected LOH in 3-36% of the neurofibromas examined. In  addition, an SSCP/HA mutation screen identified five novel NF1 germline and two  somatic mutations. In a plexiform neurofibroma from an NF1 patient, mutations in  both NF1 alleles have been characterised.

Goutebroze L(1), Brault E, Muchardt C, Camonis J, Thomas G.  Author information: (1)U434, INSERM-Institut Curie, 75005 Paris, France. goutebroze@cephb.fr  The neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) protein, known as schwannomin or merlin, is a  tumor suppressor involved in NF2-associated and sporadic schwannomas and  meningiomas. It is closely related to the ezrin-radixin-moesin family members,  implicated in linking membrane proteins to the cytoskeleton. The molecular  mechanism allowing schwannomin to function as a tumor suppressor is unknown. In  attempt to shed light on schwannomin function, we have identified a novel  coiled-coil protein, SCHIP-1, that specifically associates with schwannomin in  vitro and in vivo. Within its coiled-coil region, this protein is homologous to  human FEZ proteins and the related Caenorhabditis elegans gene product UNC-76.  Immunofluorescent staining of transiently transfected cells shows a partial  colocalization of SCHIP-1 and schwannomin, beneath the cytoplasmic membrane.  Surprisingly, immunoprecipitation assays reveal that in a cellular context,  association with SCHIP-1 can be observed only with some naturally occurring  mutants of schwannomin, or a schwannomin spliced isoform lacking exons 2 and 3,  but not with the schwannomin isoform exhibiting growth-suppressive activity. Our  observations suggest that SCHIP-1 interaction with schwannomin is regulated by  conformational changes in schwannomin, possibly induced by posttranslational  modifications, alternative splicing, or mutations.

Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco 94143-0519,  USA.  The NF1 tumor suppressor gene encodes neurofibromin, a GTPase-activating protein  (GAP) for p21ras (Ras). Children with NF1 are predisposed to juvenile  myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). Some heterozygous Nf1 mutant mice develop a  similar myeloproliferative disorder (MPD), and adoptive transfer of  Nf1-deficient fetal liver cells consistently induces this MPD. Human JMML and  murine Nf1-deficient cells are hypersensitive to granulocyte-macrophage  colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in methylcellulose cultures. We generated  hematopoietic cells deficient in both Nf1 and Gmcsf to test whether GM-CSF is  required to drive excessive proliferation of Nf1-/- cells in vivo. Here we show  that GM-CSF play a central role in establishing and maintaining the MPD and that  recipients engrafted with Nf1-/- Gmcsf-/- hematopoietic cells are hypersensitive  to exogenous GM-CSF.

Castelldefels, Km 2.7, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, 08907-Barcelona, Spain.  Alternative splicing is a regulatory process of gene expression based on the  flexibility in the selection of splice sites. In this manuscript we present the  characterisation of an alternative splicing of the NF1 pre-mRNA induced by  cold-shock conditions. We demonstrate that the accuracy of the splicing  mechanism was perturbed after keeping samples for a short period of time at room  temperature, resulting in the insertion of a 31-bp cryptic exon between exons 4a  and 4b of the NF1 mRNA. This alternative splicing is not cell type specific and  is not induced by other stress conditions such as heat shock or  hyper-osmolarity. The alternative spliced mRNA is efficiently transported to the  cytoplasm and it is proven to belong to the poly A(+)mRNA fraction. Previous  misleading interpretations about this transcript, together with our finding  relating its presence to cold shock and not to the NF1 disease, strongly  indicate that this phenomenon should be taken into account in genetic testing  when RNA methodology is used for mutation detection. This is the first  description of an alternative splicing induced by cold shock in a human pre-mRNA  and should provide further insights into the factors that control alternative  splicing.

Author information: (1)Division of Pathology, Central Clinical Laboratory, School of Medicine, Iwate  Medical University, Morioka, Japan.  BACKGROUND: Contamination of nontumor tissue makes genetic analysis difficult.  For this reason, it is important to obtain pure tumor tissue to ensure accurate  genetic analysis. OBJECTIVE: To accurately assess the incidence of mutation of tumor suppressor  genes (p53: exon 5-8; APC: mutated cluster region; NF-2 gene: all exons) in 45  colorectal carcinomas. METHODS: We developed an application of the polymerase chain  reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequence by coupling  them with crypt isolation. RESULTS: Mutations of p53 and APC genes were found in 24 and 22 of 45 colorectal  carcinomas, respectively. No mutation of the NF-2 gene was observed in this  cancer. Single-strand conformation polymorphism using a crypt isolation  technique showed a clear migrating band and no false-positive data. CONCLUSIONS: The crypt isolation technique is a useful method for accurately  analyzing genetic alterations. Furthermore, our proposed method confirmed the  morphological findings obtained before the genetic analysis.

Fahsold R(1), Hoffmeyer S, Mischung C, Gille C, Ehlers C, Kücükceylan N,  Abdel-Nour M, Gewies A, Peters H, Kaufmann D, Buske A, Tinschert S, Nürnberg P.  Author information: (1)Gemeinschaftspraxis B. Prager & A. Junge, Dresden, Germany.  More than 500 unrelated patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) were  screened for mutations in the NF1 gene. For each patient, the whole coding  sequence and all splice sites were studied for aberrations, either by the  protein truncation test (PTT), temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE)  of genomic PCR products, or, most often, by direct genomic sequencing (DGS) of  all individual exons. A total of 301 sequence variants, including 278 bona fide  pathogenic mutations, were identified. As many as 216 or 183 of the genuine  mutations, comprising 179 or 161 different ones, can be considered novel when  compared to the recent findings of Upadhyaya and Cooper, or to the NNFF mutation  database. Mutation-detection efficiencies of the various screening methods were  similar: 47.1% for PTT, 53.7% for TGGE, and 54.9% for DGS. Some 224 mutations  (80.2%) yielded directly or indirectly premature termination codons. These  mutations showed even distribution over the whole gene from exon 1 to exon 47.  Of all sequence variants determined in our study, <20% represent C-->T or G-->A  transitions within a CpG dinucleotide, and only six different mutations also  occur in NF1 pseudogenes, with five being typical C-->T transitions in a CpG.  Thus, neither frequent deamination of 5-methylcytosines nor interchromosomal  gene conversion may account for the high mutation rate of the NF1 gene. As  opposed to the truncating mutations, the 28 (10.1%) missense or  single-amino-acid-deletion mutations identified clustered in two distinct  regions, the GAP-related domain (GRD) and an upstream gene segment comprising  exons 11-17. The latter forms a so-called cysteine/serine-rich domain with three  cysteine pairs suggestive of ATP binding, as well as three potential  cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) recognition sites obviously phosphorylated  by PKA. Coincidence of mutated amino acids and those conserved between human and  Drosophila strongly suggest significant functional relevance of this region,  with major roles played by exons 12a and 15 and part of exon 16.

Most important, we found that 80% of the merlin mutants studied  significantly altered cell adhesion, causing cells to detach from the  substratum. This finding implies a function for merlin in regulating cell-matrix  attachment, and changes in cell adhesion caused by mutant protein expression may  be an initial step in the pathogenesis of NF2. In addition, five different  mutations in merlin caused a significant increase in detergent solubility of  merlin compared to wild type, indicating a decreased ability to interact with  the cytoskeleton. Although not correlated to the cell-adhesion phenotype, four  missense mutations decreased the binding of merlin to the ERM-interacting  protein EBP-50, implicating this interaction in merlin inhibition of cell  growth. Last, we found that some NF2 point mutations in merlin most closely  resembled gain-of-function alleles in their cellular phenotype, which suggests  that mutant NF2 alleles may not always act in a loss-of-function manner, as had  been assumed, but may include a spectrum of allelic types with different  phenotypic effects on the function of the protein. In aggregate, these cellular  phenotypes provide a useful assay for identifying the functional domains and  molecular partners necessary for merlin tumor-suppressor activity.

Atit RP(1), Mitchell K, Nguyen L, Warshawsky D, Ratner N.  Author information: (1)Division of Molecular and Developmental Biology, Children's Hospital Research  Foundation, Cincinnati, OH, USA.  There is increasing evidence implicating the human NF1 gene in epithelial  carcinogenesis. To test if NF1 can play a part in skin tumor formation, we  analyzed effects of the skin cancer initiator dimethylbenz-anthracene and/or the  tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-acetylphorbol on mice heterozygous for null  mutations in Nf1 (Nf1+/-). Mice were on the C57BL/6 background, noted for  resistance to chemical carcinogens. Nf1+/- mice (18 of 24) developed papillomas  after treatment with dimethylbenzanthracene and  12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-acetylphorbol; papillomas did not develop in wild-type  C57BL/6 mice nor Nf1+/- mice treated with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-acetylphorbol  alone. All papillomas analyzed (six of six) had mutations in codon 61 of H-ras,  demonstrating strong cooperation between the Nf1 GTPase activating protein for  Ras, neurofibromin, and Ras-GTP. After exposure to  12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-acetylphorbol, Nf1+/- keratinocytes showed significant,  sustained, increases in proliferation, implicating Nf1 in phorbol ester  responsive pathways. Thus, Nf1 levels regulate the response of keratinocytes to  12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-acetylphorbol. Nf1+/- mice also showed a 2-fold increase  in the development of pigmented skin patches stimulated by  dimethylbenzanthracene; patches were characterized by hair follicles in anagen  phase, implicating keratinocytes in the aberrant hyperpigmentation. Our results  show that mutation in the Nf1 gene causes abnormal keratinocyte proliferation  that can be revealed by environmental assaults such as carcinogen exposure. The  data support a plausible role for NF1 mutation in human epithelial  carcinogenesis.

However, Nf2 hemizygous mice do not develop schwannomas  but mainly osteosarcomas. In the tumors of both species, the second Nf2 allele  is inactivated. We report that conditional homozygous Nf2 knockout mice with  Cre-mediated excision of Nf2 exon 2 in Schwann cells showed characteristics of  neurofibromatosis type 2. These included schwannomas, Schwann cell hyperplasia,  cataract, and osseous metaplasia. Thus, the tumor suppressor function of Nf2,  here revealed in murine Schwann cells, was concealed in hemizygous Nf2 mice  because of insufficient rate of second allele inactivation in this cell  compartment. The finding of this conserved function documents the relevance of  the present approach to model the human disease.

Sherman LS(1), Atit R, Rosenbaum T, Cox AD, Ratner N.  Author information: (1)Department of Cell Biology, Neurobiology and Anatomy, University of  Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio 45267-0521, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common genetic disorder characterized by  multiple neurofibromas, peripheral nerve tumors containing mainly Schwann cells  and fibroblasts. The NF1 gene encodes neurofibromin, a tumor suppressor  postulated to function in part as a Ras GTPase-activating protein. The roles of  different cell types and of elevated Ras-GTP in neurofibroma formation are  unclear. To determine which neurofibroma cell type has altered Ras-GTP  regulation, we developed an immunocytochemical assay for active, GTP-bound Ras.  In NIH 3T3 cells, the assay detected overexpressed, constitutively activated K-,  N-, and Ha-Ras and insulin-induced endogenous Ras-GTP. In dissociated  neurofibroma cells from NF1 patients, Ras-GTP was elevated in Schwann cells but  not fibroblasts. Twelve to 62% of tumor Schwann cells showed elevated Ras-GTP,  unexpectedly revealing neurofibroma Schwann cell heterogeneity. Increased basal  Ras-GTP did not correlate with increased cell proliferation. Normal human  Schwann cells, however, did not demonstrate elevated basal Ras activity.  Furthermore, compared with cells from wild type littermates, Ras-GTP was  elevated in all mouse Nf1(-/-) Schwann cells but never in Nf1(-/-) mouse  fibroblasts. Our results indicate that Ras activity is detectably increased in  only some neurofibroma Schwann cells and suggest that neurofibromin is not an  essential regulator of Ras activity in fibroblasts.

Hiatt KK(1), Ingram DA, Zhang Y, Bollag G, Clapp DW.  Author information: (1)Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Departments of  Microbiology/Immunology and Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine,  Indianapolis 46202, USA.  Members of the Ras superfamily of signaling proteins modulate fundamental  cellular processes by cycling between an active GTP-bound conformation and an  inactive GDP-bound form. Neurofibromin, the protein product of the NF1 tumor  suppressor gene, and p120GAP are GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for p21(Ras)  (Ras) and negatively regulate output by accelerating GTP hydrolysis on Ras.  Neurofibromin and p120GAP differ markedly outside of their conserved GAP-related  domains (GRDs), and it is therefore unknown if the respective GRDs contribute  functional specificity. To address this question, we expressed the GRDs of  neurofibromin and p120GAP in primary cells from Nf1 mutant mice in vitro and in  vivo. Here we show that expression of neurofibromin GRD, but not the p120GAP  GRD, restores normal growth and cytokine signaling in three lineages of primary  Nf1-deficient cells that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Furthermore, utilizing a GAP-inactive mutant NF1  GRD identified in a family with NF1, we demonstrate that growth restoration is a  function of NF1 GRD GAP activity on p21(Ras). Thus, the GRDs of neurofibromin  and p120GAP specify nonoverlapping functions in multiple primary cell types.

Nguyen R(1), Reczek D, Bretscher A.  Author information: (1)Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, New  York 14853, USA.  The neurofibromatosis 2 tumor suppressor gene product merlin has strong sequence  identity to the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) family over its approximately  300-residue N-terminal domain. ERM proteins are membrane cytoskeletal linkers  that are negatively regulated by an intramolecular association between domains  known as NH(2)- and COOH-ERM association domains (N- and C-ERMADs) that mask  sites for binding membrane-associated proteins, such as EBP50 and E3KARP, and  F-actin. Here we show that merlin has self-association regions analogous to the  N- and C-ERMADs. Moreover, the N-/C-ERMAD interaction in merlin is relatively  weak and dynamic, and this property is reflected by the ability of full-length  recombinant merlin to form homo-oligomers. Remarkably, the merlin C-ERMAD has a  higher affinity for the N-ERMAD of ezrin than the N-ERMAD of merlin. Both the  ezrin and merlin N-ERMAD bind EBP50. This interaction with the ezrin N-ERMAD can  be inhibited by the presence of the ezrin C-ERMAD, whereas interaction with the  merlin N-ERMAD is not inhibited by either C-ERMAD. E3KARP binds tightly to the  ezrin N-ERMAD but has little affinity for the merlin N-ERMAD. The implications  of these associations and the hierarchies of binding for the function and  regulation of merlin and ERM proteins are discussed.

Author information: (1)Divisions of Neurology and Genetics, the Department of Pediatrics, University  of Florida Brain Institute and College of Medicine, Gainesville, Florida 32610,  USA. muir@ufbi.ufl.edu  Dermal and plexiform neurofibromas are peripheral nerve sheath tumors that arise  frequently in neurofibromatosis type 1. The goal of the present study was to  examine the tumorigenic properties of neurofibromin-deficient human Schwann  cells (SCs) that were found to represent a subset of SCs present in  approximately half of the total neurofibromas examined. Highly enriched SC  cultures were established from 10 dermal and eight plexiform neurofibromas by  selective subculture using glial growth factor-2 and laminin. These cultures had  low tumorigenic potential in classical in vitro assays yet several unique  preneoplastic properties were frequently observed, including delayed senescence,  a lack of density-limited growth, and a strong propensity to spontaneously form  proliferative cell aggregates rich in extracellular matrix. Western blot  analysis failed to detect full-length neurofibromin in any of the neurofibroma  SC cultures, indicating that neurofibromin-deficient SCs had a substantial  growth advantage. Immunohistochemical staining of the originating tumors showed  the majority were comprised principally of neurofibromin-negative SCs, whereas  the remainder contained both neurofibromin-negative and neurofibromin-positive  SCs. Lastly, engraftment of neurofibromin-deficient SC cultures into the  peripheral nerves of scid mice consistently produced persistent  neurofibroma-like tumors with diffuse and often extensive intraneural growth.  These findings indicate that neurofibromin-deficient SCs are involved in  neurofibroma formation and, by selective subculture, provide a resource for the  development of an in vivo model to further examine the role of these mutant SCs  in neurofibroma histogenesis.

The neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene encodes a large tumor suppressor protein  (neurofibromin). Although it is known to possess Ras GTPase-activating protein  (GAP) activity, the cellular role of neurofibromin remains unclear. Here we used  yeast two-hybrid screening to identify neurofibromin-interacting proteins.  Syndecan-2, a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), was isolated as  a binding partner for two distinct regions of the neurofibromin protein. We  subsequently found that neurofibromin can bind all four mammalian syndecans. NF1  interaction requires the transmembrane domain and a membrane-proximal region of  the cytoplasmic tail of syndecan, but not the C terminus of syndecan known to  bind to CASK, a membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK). Neurofibromin,  syndecans, and CASK have overlapping subcellular distributions in axons and  synapses of neurons, as shown by biochemical fractionation and immunostaining.  Moreover, neurofibromin exists in a complex with syndecan and CASK in vivo, as  evidenced by their coimmunoprecipitation from rat brain. Our findings suggest  that interaction with different members of the syndecan family may be a  mechanism for localizing neurofibromin to specialized domains of the plasma  membrane.

James MF(1), Manchanda N, Gonzalez-Agosti C, Hartwig JH, Ramesh V.  Author information: (1)Molecular Neurogenetics Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Building 149,  13th Street, Charlestown, MA 02129, USA.  The neurofibromatosis 2 protein product merlin, named for its relatedness to the  ezrin, radixin and moesin (ERM) family of proteins, is a tumour suppressor whose  absence results in the occurrence of multiple tumours of the nervous system,  particularly schwannomas and meningiomas. Merlin's similarity to ERMs suggests  that it might share functions, acting as a link between cytoskeletal components  and the cell membrane. The N-terminus of merlin has strong sequence identity to  the N-terminal actin-binding region of ezrin; here we describe in detail the  merlin-actin interaction. Employing standard actin co-sedimentation assays, we  have determined that merlin isoform 2 binds F-actin with an apparent binding  constant of 3.6 microM and a stoichiometry of 1 mol of merlin per 11.5 mol of  actin in filaments at saturation. Further, solid-phase binding assays reveal  that merlin isoforms 1 and 2 bind actin filaments differentially, suggesting  that the intramolecular interactions in isoform 1 might hinder its ability to  bind actin. However, merlin does not bind G-actin. Studies of actin filament  dynamics show that merlin slows filament disassembly with no influence on the  assembly rate, indicating that merlin binds along actin filament lengths. This  conclusion is supported by electron microscopy, which demonstrates that merlin  binds periodically along cytoskeletal actin filaments. Comparison of these  findings with those reported for ERM proteins reveal a distinct role for merlin  in actin filament dynamics.

Author information: (1)Department of Neurosurgery, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Kumamoto  860-8556, Japan.  BACKGROUND: Although mutational inactivation and allelic loss in the NF2 gene  appear to be causal events in the majority of vestibular schwannomas,  involvement of another potentially important mechanism, transcriptional  inactivation, has not been investigated. RESULTS: We cloned and functionally characterized the 5'-flanking region of the  human NF2 gene and identified the molecular mechanisms that regulate NF2  expression. Luciferase assay and site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that a  70-base pair (bp) region (-591 to -522 bp from the translation start site) was  essential for the basic expression of the NF2 gene. A gel mobility shift assay  indicated recognition by nuclear protein of the unusually long ( approximately  66 bp) sequences in this region. Recognition was inhibited by either mutation of  the binding core sequence or by methylation of three CpG sites. Point mutations  at these CpG sites significantly decreased promoter activity, suggesting the  importance of these sites. In 14 of 23 vestibular schwannomas, these three CpG  sites were methylated in a site-specific manner and the methylation status was  consistent with the expression of NF2 mRNA. CONCLUSIONS: Suppressed expression by aberrant methylation or mutation of the  promoter elements could be an alternative mechanism for inactivation of the NF2  gene.

LaJeunesse DR(1), McCartney BM, Fehon RG.  Author information: (1)Developmental, Cell and Molecular Biology Group, Department of Biology, Duke  University, Durham, North Carolina 27708-1000, USA.  Merlin, the Drosophila homologue of the human tumor suppressor gene  Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2), is required for the regulation of cell proliferation  and differentiation. To better understand the cellular functions of the NF2 gene  product, Merlin, recent work has concentrated on identifying proteins with which  it interacts either physically or functionally. In this article, we describe  genetic screens designed to isolate second-site modifiers of Merlin phenotypes  from which we have identified five multiallelic complementation groups that  modify both loss-of-function and dominant-negative Merlin phenotypes. Three of  these groups, Group IIa/scribbler (also known as brakeless), Group  IIc/blistered, and Group IId/net, are known genes, while two appear to be novel.  In addition, two genes, Group IIa/scribbler and Group IIc/blistered, alter  Merlin subcellular localization in epithelial and neuronal tissues, suggesting  that they regulate Merlin trafficking or function. Furthermore, we show that  mutations in scribbler and blistered display second-site noncomplementation with  one another. These results suggest that Merlin, blistered, and scribbler  function together in a common pathway to regulate Drosophila wing epithelial  development.

Author information: (1)Center for Research in Neuroscience, McGill University and the Montreal  General Hospital, 1650 Cedar Avenue, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.  The neurofibromatosis type 2 gene (NF2) is involved in the pathogenesis of  benign tumors of the human nervous system. The NF2 protein, called schwannomin  or merlin, is inactivated in virtually all schwannomas and meningiomas. The  molecular mechanisms by which schwannomin functions as a tumor suppressor is  unknown but believed to involve plasma membrane-cytoskeletal interactions. Two  major alternatively spliced isoforms of schwannomin differing in their C termini  have been reported. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified  syntenin as a binding partner for schwannomin isoform-1 (sch-1). Syntenin is an  adapter protein that couples transmembrane proteoglycans to cytoskeletal  components and is involved in intracellular vesicle transport. The C terminus 25  amino acids of sch-1 and the two PDZ domains of syntenin mediate their binding,  and mutations introduced within the VAFFEEL region of sch-1 defined a sequence  crucial for syntenin recognition. We have showed that the two proteins  interacted in vitro and in vivo and localized underneath the plasma membrane.  Fibroblast cells expressing heterologous antisense syntenin display alterations  in the subcellular distribution of sch-1. Together, these results provide the  first functional clue to the existence of schwannomin isoforms and could unravel  novel pathways for the transport and subcellular localization of schwannomin in  vivo.

A reliable and robust method for measuring the expression of alternatively  spliced transcripts is an important step in investigating the significance of  each variant. So far, accurate quantification of splice variants has been  laborious and difficult due to the intrinsic limitations of conventional  methods. The many advantages of real-time PCR have made this technique  attractive to study its application in quantification of splice isoforms. We use  skipping of exon 37 in the NF1 gene as a model to compare and evaluate the  different strategies for quantitating splice variants using real-time PCR. An  overview of three different possibilities for detecting alternative transcripts  is given. We propose the use of a boundary-spanning primer to quantify isoforms  that differ greatly in abundance. We describe here a novel method for creating a  reliable standard curve using one plasmid containing both alternative  transcripts. In addition, we validate the use of an absolute standard curve  based on a dilution series of fluorometrically quantified PCR products.

Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of  Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.  Mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene cause neurofibromatosis type I (NF1),  a disease characterized by the formation of cutaneous neurofibromas infiltrated  with a high density of degranulating mast cells. A hallmark of cell lines  generated from NF1 patients or Nf1-deficient mice is their propensity to  hyperproliferate. Neurofibromin, the protein encoded by NF1, negatively  regulates p21(ras) activity by accelerating the conversion of Ras-GTP to  Ras-GDP. However, identification of alterations in specific p21(ras) effector  pathways that control proliferation in NF1-deficient cells is incomplete and  critical for understanding disease pathogenesis. Recent studies have suggested  that the proliferative effects of p21(ras) may depend on signaling outputs from  the small Rho GTPases, Rac and Rho, but the physiologic importance of these  interactions in an animal disease model has not been established. Using a  genetic intercross between Nf1(+/)- and Rac2(-)(/)- mice, we now provide genetic  evidence to support a biochemical model where hyperactivation of the  extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) via the hematopoietic-specific Rho  GTPase, Rac2, directly contributes to the hyperproliferation of Nf1-deficient  mast cells in vitro and in vivo. Further, we demonstrate that Rac2 functions as  mediator of cross-talk between phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI-3K) and the  classical p21(ras)-Raf-Mek-ERK pathway to confer a distinct proliferative  advantage to Nf1(+/)- mast cells. Thus, these studies identify Rac2 as a novel  mediator of cross-talk between PI-3K and the p21(ras)-ERK pathway which  functions to alter the cellular phenotype of a cell lineage involved in the  pathologic complications of a common genetic disease.

Its  mixed composition typically includes Schwann cells, fibroblasts,  perineurial-like cells, and mast cells. Although NF1 loss of heterozygosity has  been reported in subsets of PNs, it remains uncertain which cell type(s) harbor  these alterations. Using a dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization and  immunohistochemistry technique, we studied NF1 gene status in S-100  protein-positive and -negative cell subpopulations in archival paraffin-embedded  specimens from seven PNs, two atypical PNs, one cellular/atypical PN, and eight  MPNSTs derived from 13 patients, seven of which had neurofibromatosis type 1  (NF1). NF1 loss was detected in four of seven PNs and one atypical PN, with  deletions entirely restricted to S-100 protein-immunoreactive Schwann cells. In  contrast, all eight MPNSTs harbored NF1 deletions, regardless of S-100 protein  expression or NF1 clinical status. Our results suggest that the Schwann cell is  the primary neoplastic component in PNs and that S-100 protein-negative cells in  MPNST represent dedifferentiated Schwann cells, which harbor NF1 deletions in  both NF1-associated and sporadic tumors.

Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a disease that occurs in young  children and is associated with a high mortality rate. In most patients, JMML  has a progressive course leading to death by virtue of infection, bleeding, or  progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). As it is known that children with  neurofibromatosis type 1 syndrome have a markedly increased risk of developing  JMML, we have previously developed a mouse model of JMML through reconstitution  of lethally irradiated mice with hematopoietic stem cells homozygous for a  loss-of-function mutation in the Nf1 gene (D.

In the course of  these experiments, we found that all these genetically identical reconstituted  mice developed a JMML-like disorder, but only a subset went on to develop more  acute disease. This result strongly suggests that additional genetic lesions are  responsible for disease progression to AML. Here, we describe the production of  a unique tumor panel, created using the BXH-2 genetic background, for  identification of these additional genetic lesions. Using this tumor panel, we  have identified a locus, Epi1, which maps 30 to 40 kb downstream of the Myb gene  and appears to be the most common site of somatic viral integration in BXH-2  mice. Our findings suggest that proviral integrations at Epi1 cooperate with  loss of Nf1 to cause AML.

PMID:11535133,Binding of the merlin-I product of the neurofibromatosis type 2 tumour suppressor gene to a novel site in beta-fodrin is regulated by association between merlin domains.,"Binding of the merlin-I product of the neurofibromatosis type 2 tumour  suppressor gene to a novel site in beta-fodrin is regulated by association  between merlin domains.  Neill GW(1), Crompton MR.  Author information: (1)Centre for Cutaneous Research, St Bartholomew's and the Royal London, Queen  Mary and Westfield College, 2 Newark Street, London E1 2AT, UK.  The mechanism underlying the tumour-suppressor activity of the neurofibromatosis  type 2 (NF2) gene product, merlin, is largely undefined but there is evidence  that the biological function of the protein might be mediated partly through  interactions with the cytoskeleton. Merlin is expressed predominantly as two  isoforms that differ at their C-termini owing to alternative splicing of exon  16. By expressing merlin isoform I as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, we  isolated a clone encoding a region of the cytoskeletal protein beta-fodrin.  Confirmation of the merlin-fodrin interaction was provided by using the  mammalian two-hybrid system and binding assays in vitro. In addition, these  assays and co-immunoprecipitation from mammalian cells revealed that the binding  site for fodrin is located in the C-terminal half of merlin at a site that is  masked in the native protein. Co-expression of the N-terminus of merlin  decreased the interaction of its C-terminus with fodrin, implicating homophilic  interactions of merlin isoform I in masking the fodrin-binding site. The effect  of three disease-associated mutations on the merlin-fodrin interaction and  merlin dimerization was also investigated. The mutation L535P, but not L360P or  K413E, significantly decreased the merlin-fodrin interaction but not  dimerization, indicating that the tumour suppressor ability of merlin might  reside partly in its ability to interact with the cytoskeleton via fodrin.

Author information: (1)Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine,  Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.  The NF1 tumor-suppressor gene is frequently inactivated in juvenile  myelomonocytic leukemia, and Nf1 mutant mice model this myeloproliferative  disorder (MPD). Competitive repopulation assays were performed to quantify the  proliferative advantage of Nf1(-/-) hematopoietic cells in vivo. Nf1 mutant stem  cells demonstrated a growth advantage that was greatest in myeloid lineage cells  and least pronounced in T lymphocytes. Surprisingly, although low numbers of  Nf1-deficient cells consistently outcompeted wild-type cells, levels of  chimerism were stable over months of observation, and MPD was not observed  unless threshold numbers of mutant cells were injected. These data showing that  normal competitor cells can strongly modulate the growth of mutant populations  in vivo have general implications for modeling cancer in the mouse. In  particular, strains in which cancer-associated mutations are expressed in fields  of target cells may not accurately model early events in tumorigenesis because  they eliminate the requirement for a mutant clone to outcompete resident normal  cells.

Author information: (1)Department of Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Massachusetts  Institute of Technology, Cambridge 02139, USA.  Mutations in the neurofibromatosis type II (NF2) tumor suppressor predispose  humans and mice to tumor development. The study of Nf2+/- mice has demonstrated  an additional effect of Nf2 loss on tumor metastasis. The NF2-encoded protein,  merlin, belongs to the ERM (ezrin, radixin, and moesin) family of  cytoskeleton:membrane linkers. However, the molecular basis for the tumor- and  metastasis- suppressing activity of merlin is unknown. We have now placed merlin  in a signaling pathway downstream of the small GTPase Rac. Expression of  activated Rac induces phosphorylation and decreased association of merlin with  the cytoskeleton. Furthermore, merlin overexpression inhibits Rac-induced  signaling in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Finally, Nf2-/- cells exhibit  characteristics of cells expressing activated alleles of Rac. These studies  provide insight into the normal cellular function of merlin and how Nf2 mutation  contributes to tumor initiation and progression.

Author information: (1)Human Genetics Program, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  19111, USA.  The neurofibromatosis type 2 tumor suppressor gene, NF2, is mutated in the germ  line of NF2 patients and predisposes affected individuals to intracranial and  spinal tumors. Moreover, somatic mutations of NF2 can occur in the sporadic  counterparts of these neurological tumor types as well as in certain neoplasms  of non-neuroectodermal origin, such as malignant mesothelioma and melanoma. NF2  encodes a 595-amino acid protein, merlin, which exhibits significant homology to  the ezrin-radixin-moesin family of proteins. However, the mechanism by which  merlin exerts its tumor suppressor activity is not well understood. In this  investigation, we show that merlin is phosphorylated in response to expression  of activated Rac and activated Cdc42 in mammalian cells. Furthermore, we  demonstrate that merlin phosphorylation is mediated by p21-activated kinase  (Pak), a common downstream target of both Rac and Cdc42. Both in vivo and in  vitro kinase assays demonstrated that Pak can directly phosphorylate merlin at  serine 518, a site that affects merlin activity and localization. These  biochemical investigations provide insights into the regulation of merlin  function and establish a framework for elucidating tumorigenic mechanisms  involved in neoplasms associated with merlin inactivation.

Mukhopadhyay D(1), Anant S, Lee RM, Kennedy S, Viskochil D, Davidson NO.  Author information: (1)Department of Medicine, Washington University Medical School, St. Louis, MO  63110, USA.  C-->U RNA editing of neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) mRNA changes an arginine (CGA) to  a UGA translational stop codon, predicted to result in translational termination  of the edited mRNA. Previous studies demonstrated varying degrees of C-->U RNA  editing in peripheral nerve-sheath tumor samples (PNSTs) from patients with NF1,  but the basis for this heterogeneity was unexplained. In addition, the role, if  any, of apobec-1, the catalytic deaminase that mediates C-->U editing of  mammalian apolipoprotein B (apoB) RNA, was unresolved. We have examined these  questions in PNSTs from patients with NF1 and demonstrate that a subset (8/34)  manifest C-->U editing of RNA. Two distinguishing characteristics were found in  the PNSTs that demonstrated editing of NF1 RNA. First, these tumors express  apobec-1 mRNA, the first demonstration, in humans, of its expression beyond the  luminal gastrointestinal tract. Second, PNSTs with C-->U editing of RNA manifest  increased proportions of an alternatively spliced exon, 23A, downstream of the  edited base. C-->U editing of RNA in these PNSTs was observed preferentially in  transcripts containing exon 23A. These findings were complemented by in vitro  studies using synthetic RNA templates incubated in the presence of recombinant  apobec-1, which again confirmed preferential editing of transcripts containing  exon 23A. Finally, adenovirus-mediated transfection of HepG2 cells revealed  induction of editing of apoB RNA, along with preferential editing of NF1  transcripts containing exon 23A. Taken together, the data support the hypothesis  that C-->U RNA editing of the NF1 transcript occurs both in a subset of PNSTs  and in an alternatively spliced form containing a downstream exon, presumably an  optimal configuration for enzymatic deamination by apobec-1.

Author information: (1)Structural Biology Laboratory, Nara Institute of Science and Technology and  CREST, Japan.  Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a dominantly inherited disease associated with  the central nervous system. The NF2 gene product merlin is a tumor suppressor,  and its mutation or inactivation causes this disease. We report here the crystal  structure of the merlin FERM domain containing a 22-residue alpha-helical  segment. The structure reveals that the merlin FERM domain consists of three  subdomains displaying notable features of the electrostatic surface potentials,  although the overall surface potentials similar to those of ezrin/radixin/moesin  (ERM) proteins indicate electrostatic membrane association. The structure also  is consistent with inactivation mechanisms caused by the pathogenic mutations  associated with NF2.

Haines TR(1), Rodenhiser DI, Ainsworth PJ.  Author information: (1)London Regional Cancer Centre, Departments of Biochemistry, Child Health  Research Institute, London Health Sciences Centre, Ontario, London, N6C 2V5,  Canada.  Recent reports of cytosine methylation occurring at CpA and CpT dinucleotides in  murine ES cells as well as in Drosophila have renewed interest in methylation at  sites other than CpGs. Our examination of the murine neurofibromatosis type 1  gene by sodium bisulfite genomic sequencing has revealed non-CpG methylation  primarily in the oocyte and the maternally derived allele of the 2-cell embryo,  with markedly lower levels found in sperm. Non-CpG methylation was not found in  later stages of embryo development or in adult tissue. Our results suggest that  maternal-specific de novo non-CpG methylation has occurred sometime between  ovulation and formation of the 2-cell embryo, while during the same period the  paternally derived allele has undergone site-specific active demethylation. Our  data demonstrate both stage and parent-of-origin specific changes in methylation  patterns within the neurofibromatosis type 1 coding region-involving cytosines  located at both CpG and non-CpG dinucleotides.

Bashour AM(1), Meng JJ, Ip W, MacCollin M, Ratner N.  Author information: (1)Department of Cell Biology, Neurobiology and Anatomy, University of  Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio 45267, USA.  Schwannoma tumors, which occur sporadically and in patients with  neurofibromatosis, account for 8% of intracranial tumors and can only be treated  by surgical removal. Most schwannomas have biallelic mutations in the NF2 tumor  suppressor gene. We previously showed that schwannoma-derived Schwann cells  exhibit membrane ruffling and aberrant cell spreading when plated onto laminin,  indicative of fundamental F-actin cytoskeletal defects. Here we expand these  observations to a large group of sporadic and NF2-related tumors and extend them  to schwannomatosis-derived tumors. Mutation at NF2 correlated with F-actin  abnormalities, but the extent of morphological change did not correlate with the  type of NF2 mutation. We used a recently described molecular strategy,  TAT-mediated protein transfer, to acutely introduce the NF2 protein, merlin,  into primary human schwannoma cells in an attempt to reverse the cytoskeletal  phenotype. Abnormal ruffling and cell spreading by cells with identified NF2  mutations were rapidly reversed by introduction of TAT-merlin. The effect is  specific to TAT-merlin isoform 1, the growth-suppressive isoform of merlin.  TAT-merlin isoform 2, a TAT-merlin mutant (L64P), and merlin lacking TAT were  ineffective in reversing the cytoskeletal phenotype. Results show that merlin  isoform 1 is sufficient to restore normal actin organization in NF2-deficient  human tumor cells, demonstrating a key role for merlin in the NF2 phenotype.  These results lay the foundation for epigenetic complementation studies in NF2  mouse models and possibly for experiments to evaluate the utility of merlin  transduction into patients as protein therapy.

Author information: (1)Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland.  We have previously shown that NF1 (type 1 neurofibromatosis) p21ras  GTPase-activating tumor suppressor protein undergoes major relocalization during  the formation of cell-cell junctions in differentiating keratinocytes in vitro.  This prompted us to study the distribution of NF1 mRNA under the same conditions  by in situ hybridization. In differentiating keratinocytes, the NF1 mRNA signal  intensified within the cell cytoplasm within the first 0.5 to 2 hours after  induction of cellular differentiation. First, the hybridization signal was  evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm. Subsequently, NF1 mRNA was  gradually polarized to the cellular periphery at the side of cell-cell junctions  and finally disappeared. Reappearance of NF1 mRNA was found in migrating  keratinocytes forming a bilayered culture. Disruption of microfibrillar  cytoskeleton, but not microtubules, caused a marked change in the subcellular  distribution of NF1 mRNA. This data may suggest that intact actin microfilaments  are essential for transport of NF1 mRNA to the cell periphery. This is the first  study demonstrating that NF1, or any tumor suppressor mRNA, belongs to a rare  group of mRNAs not targeted to free polysomes or ribosomes of the rough  endoplasmic reticulum. This finding recognizes a potential way for  post-transcriptional modification of NF1 expression.

Grand Blvd. Detroit, MI 48202, U.S.A.  The Protein 4.1 family contains at least two members that function as tumour  suppressors, the neurofibromatosis 2 gene product merlin and the recently  identified differentially expressed in adenocarcinoma of the lung  (DAL-1)/Protein 4.1B molecule. DAL-1/Protein 4.1B loss is observed in a variety  of tumours, including breast and lung cancers as well as meningiomas. We have  previously demonstrated that DAL-1/Protein 4.1B interacts with some but not all  merlin-binding proteins, raising the possibility that DAL-1/Protein 4.1B  associates with additional unique proteins specific to its function as a  negative growth regulator. Using yeast two-hybrid interaction cloning, we  identified three 14-3-3 isoforms, beta, gamma and eta, to be DAL-1/Protein  4.1B-binding proteins. These interactions were verified by using glutathione  S-transferase affinity chromatography in vitro and co-immunoprecipitation in  vivo. The interaction of 14-3-3 with DAL-1/Protein 4.1B was specific, as 14-3-3  did not bind to the related Protein 4.1 family members merlin, ezrin or radixin.  The DAL-1/Protein 4.1B domain that mediates 14-3-3 binding was mapped to  residues Pro(244) and Leu(280) within the 4.1/ezrin/radixin/moesin domain. The  identification of this novel DAL-1/Protein 4.1B-interacting protein represents  the first step towards elucidating its potentially unique mechanism of action.

Ina.Vandenbroucke@rug.ac.be  BACKGROUND: Mutation analysis of the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene has  shown that about 30% of NF1 patients carry a splice mutation resulting in the  production of one or several shortened transcripts. Some of these transcripts  were also found in fresh lymphocytes of healthy individuals, albeit typically at  a very low level. Starting from this initial observation, we were interested to  gain further insight into the complex nature of NF1 mRNA processing. RESULTS: We have used a RT-PCR plasmid library based method to identify novel  NF1 splice variants. Several transcripts were observed with specific  insertions/deletions and a survey was made. This large group of variants  detected in one single gene allows to perform a comparative analysis of the  factors involved in splice regulation. Exons that are prone to skipping were  systematically analysed for 5' and 3' splice site strength, branch point  strength and secondary structure. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed a complex splicing pattern, generating a great  diversity in NF1 transcripts. We found that, on average, exons that are spliced  out in part of the mRNA have significantly weaker acceptor sites. Some variants  identified in this study could have distinct roles and might expand our  knowledge of neurofibromin.

Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, 660 South  Euclid Avenue, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.  Individuals with the neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) inherited tumor syndrome develop  low-grade gliomas (astrocytomas) at an increased frequency, suggesting that the  NF1 gene is a critical growth regulator for astrocytes. In an effort to  determine the contribution of the NF1 gene product, neurofibromin, to astrocyte  growth regulation and NF1-associated astrocytoma formation, we generated  astrocyte-specific Nf1 conditional knockout mice (Nf1(GFAP)CKO) by using  Cre/LoxP technology. Transgenic mice were developed in which Cre recombinase was  specifically expressed in astrocytes by embryonic day 14.5. Successive  intercrossing with mice bearing a conditional Nf1 allele (Nf1flox) resulted in  GFAP-Cre Nf1flox/flox (Nf1(GFAP)CKO) animals. No astrocytoma formation or  neurological impairment was observed in Nf1(GFAP)CKO mice after 20 months, but  increased numbers of proliferating astrocytes were observed in several brain  regions. To determine the consequence of Nf1 inactivation at different  developmental times, the growth properties of embryonic day 12.5 and postnatal  day 2 Nf1 null astrocytes were analyzed. Nf1 null astrocytes exhibited increased  proliferation but lacked tumorigenic properties in vitro and did not form tumors  when injected into immunocompromised mouse brains in vivo. Collectively, our  results suggest that loss of neurofibromin is not sufficient for astrocytoma  formation in mice and that other genetic or environmental factors might  influence NF1-associated glioma tumorigenesis.

Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), a syndrome associated with multiple tumors of  the nervous system, mostly schwannomas, is caused by mutations in the NF2 tumor  suppressor gene that encodes schwannomin (Sch). Here we examined NF2  pathogenetic mutations that result in misfolding of the FERM domain. We found  that these mutant forms of Sch were efficiently degraded by the  ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In transfected cells, Sch Delta F118 was 3-fold  more efficiently degraded than the related molecule ezrin bearing the equivalent  mutation. In heterozygous Nf2 knock-out mouse fibroblasts, endogenous mutant Sch  Delta 81-121, but not wild type Sch, was also degraded by proteasomes. We  further show that this degradation pathway is functional in primary Schwann  cells. We analyzed Sch Delta 39-121 expressed in a transgenic mouse model of NF2  and found that Sch Delta 39-121, but not the endogenous wild type Sch, was  unstable due to proteasome-mediated degradation. Altogether these results  suggest that degradation of mutant Sch mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome  pathway is a physiopathological pathway contributing to the loss of Sch function  in NF2 patients.

Mutations in either of the two tumor suppressor genes NF1 (neurofibromin) and  NF2 (merlin) result in Neurofibromatosis, a condition predisposing individuals  to developing a variety of benign and malignant tumors of the central and  peripheral nervous systems. Here we report the identification of two distinct  NF1-containing complexes, one in the soluble and the other in the particulate  fraction of HeLa extract. We show that the soluble NF1 complex delineates a  large holo-NF1 complex (2 MDa) encompassing the components of a smaller  particulate core-NF1 complex (400 kDa). Purification of the core-NF1 complex  followed by mass spectrometric analysis revealed the motor protein, kinesin-1  heavy chain (HsuKHC/KIF5B), as a catalytic subunit of both NF-1-containing  complexes. Importantly, although NF1 and NF2 are not in a stable association,  NF2 is also a component of a distinct kinesin-1-containing complex.

Malminen M(1), Peltonen S, Koivunen J, Peltonen J.  Author information: (1)Department of Medical Biochemistry, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.  marhen@utu.fi  BACKGROUND: NF1 refers to type 1 neurofibromatosis syndrome, which has been  linked with mutations of the large NF1 gene. NF1 tumor suppressor protein,  neurofibromin, has been shown to regulate ras: the NF1 protein contains a GTPase  activating protein (GAP) related domain which functions as p21rasGAP. Our  studies have previously demonstrated that the NF1 protein forms a high affinity  association with cytokeratin 14 during the formation of desmosomes and  hemidesmosomes in cultured keratinocytes. METHODS: The expression of NF1 protein was studied in developing human epidermis  using western transfer analysis, indirect immunofluorescence, confocal laser  scanning microscopy, immunoelectron microscopy, and in situ hybridization. RESULTS: The expression of NF1 protein was noted to be highly elevated in the  periderm at 8 weeks estimated gestational age (EGA) and in the basal cells at  8-14 weeks EGA. During this period, NF1 protein was associated with cytokeratin  filaments terminating to desmosomes and hemidesmosomes. NF1 protein did not  display colocalization with alpha-tubulin or actin of the cytoskeleton, or with  adherens junction proteins. CONCLUSIONS: These results depict an early fetal period when the NF1 tumor  suppressor is abundantly expressed in epidermis and associated with cytokeratin  filaments. This period is characterized by the initiation of differentiation of  the basal cells, maturation of the basement membrane zone as well as accentuated  formation of selected cellular junctions. NF1 tumor suppressor may function in  the regulation of epidermal histogenesis via controlling the organization of the  keratin cytoskeleton during the assembly of desmosomes and hemidesmosomes.

PMID:12243339,Inhibition of ras-mediated activator protein 1 activity and cell growth by merlin.,"Inhibition of ras-mediated activator protein 1 activity and cell growth by  merlin.  Kim H(1), Lim JY, Kim YH, Kim H, Park SH, Lee KH, Han H, Jeun SS, Lee JH, Rha  HK.  Author information: (1)Neuroscience Genome Research Center, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul.  The neurofibromatosis type2 (NF2) gene encodes an intracellular-associated  protein that is referred to as either merlin or schwannomin. Merlin/Schwannomin  is a tumor suppressor protein that has been reported to block the Ras-mediated  cell proliferation and -anchorage-independent cell growth. However, its  inhibitory mechanism is uncertain. In this report, merlin was demonstrated to be  effective in suppressing Ras-induced foci-formation and its associated AP-1  activity in NIH3T3cells. In addition, merlin blocked Ras-induced Rb  phosphorylation, and inhibited the increase of cyclin D1 levels. It also blocked  E2F-1-dependent transcription. These results suggest that merlin inhibits  abnormal cell proliferation which is activated via Ras by repressing Rb  phosphorylation, blocking the increase of the cyclin D1 protein level, and  inhibiting the activation of AP-1- and E2F-1-dependent transcription in NIH3T3  cells.

Author information: (1)Indiana University School of Medicine, Herman B. Wells Center for Pediatric  Research, Department of Microbiology/Immunology, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.  dingram@iupui.edu  The development of molecularly targeted treatments of adult leukemias warrants  investigation of these targets in similar pediatric leukemias. The NF1 tumor  suppressor gene, which encodes a GTPase activating protein for p21(ras), is  frequently inactivated in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). Other  patients with JMML acquire activating RAS gene mutations. Recipient mice  reconstituted with Nf1-/- fetal hematopoietic cells develop a myeloproliferative  disease (MPD) that models the human disease. JMML arises from clonal expansion  of a hematopoietic stem cell, and JMML cells and murine Nf1-/- hematopoietic  cells are hypersensitive to granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor and  KitL, the ligand for c-kit. We generated embryos doubly mutant for the Wv allele  of c-kit and Nf1 to ask if reduction of c-kit activity would delay or prevent  the development of MPD. Despite a reduction in c-kit activity to approximately  10% of wild-type levels, Nf1-/-;Wv/Wv cells induced MPD in recipient mice.

Comment in     Nat Genet. 2003 Jan;33(1):8-9. doi: 10.1038/ng0103-8.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis is a  genetic disorder that occurs in 1 of 4000 births and is characterized by benign  and malignant tumors. Cardiovascular defects also contribute to NF1, though the  pathogenesis is still unclear. Deficiency in neurofibromin (encoded by Nf1) in  mice results in mid-embryonic lethality owing to cardiac abnormalities  previously thought to be secondary to cardiac neural-crest defects. Using  tissue-specific gene inactivation, we show that endothelial-specific  inactivation of Nf1 recapitulates key aspects of the complete null phenotype,  including multiple cardiovascular abnormalities involving the endocardial  cushions and myocardium. This phenotype is associated with an elevated level of  ras signaling in Nf1(-/-) endothelial cells and greater nuclear localization of  the transcription factor Nfatc1. Inactivation of Nf1 in the neural crest does  not cause cardiac defects but results in tumors of neural-crest origin  resembling those seen in humans with NF1. These results establish a new and  essential role for Nf1 in endothelial cells and confirm the requirement for  neurofibromin in the neural crest.

Schwannomin (Sch) is the product of the NF2 tumor suppressor gene. The NF2 gene  is mutated in patients affected by neurofibromatosis type 2, a syndrome  associated with multiple tumors of the nervous system. Here we found that Sch,  when its N-terminal FERM domain was misfolded by the pathogenetic mutation Delta  F118, formed aggresomes, i.e. aggregates that cluster at the centrosome as a  result of microtubule-dependent transport. Strikingly the related protein ezrin  affected by the same mutation did not form aggresomes even though its FERM  domain was similarly misfolded. By studying ezrin/Sch chimeras, we delineated a  sequence of 61 amino acids in the C terminus of Sch that determined the  formation of aggresomes. Aggresome formation by these chimeras was independent  from their rate of degradation. Sch(535-595) was sufficient to induce aggresomes  of a green fluorescent fusion protein in vivo and aggregates of a glutathione  S-transferase fusion protein in vitro. Taken together, these results suggest  that aggresome formation is controlled primarily by aggresome determinants,  which are distinct from degradation determinants, or from misfolding, through  which aggresome determinants might be exposed.

Author information: (1)Department of Cell Biology, Neurobiology and Anatomy, University of  Cincinnati College of Medicine, 231 Bethesda Avenue, Cincinnati, OH 45267-0521,  USA.  Loss of axonal contact characterizes Schwann cells in benign and malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) from neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)  patients. Tumor Schwann cells demonstrate NF1 mutations, elevated Ras activity,  and aberrant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression. Using cDNA  microarrays, we found that brain lipid binding protein (BLBP) is elevated in an  EGFR-positive subpopulation of Nf1 mutant mouse Schwann cells (Nf1(-/-) TXF)  that grows away from axons; BLBP expression was not affected by  farnesyltransferase inhibitor, an inhibitor of H-Ras. BLBP was also detected in  EGFR-positive cell lines derived from Nf1:p53 double mutant mice and human  MPNST. BLBP expression was induced in normal Schwann cells following  transfection with EGFR but not H-Ras12V. Furthermore, EGFR-mediated BLBP  expression was not inhibited by dominant-negative H-Ras, indicating that BLBP  expression is downstream of Ras-independent EGFR signaling. BLBP-blocking  antibodies enabled process outgrowth from Nf1(-/-) TXF cells and restored  interaction with axons, without affecting cell proliferation or migration.  Following injury, BLBP expression was induced in normal sciatic nerves when  nonmyelinating Schwann cells remodeled their processes. These data suggest that  BLBP, stimulated by Ras-independent pathways, regulates Schwann cell-axon  interactions in normal peripheral nerve and peripheral nerve tumors.

Utermark T(1), Alekov A, Lerche H, Abramowski V, Giovannini M, Hanemann CO.  Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.  BACKGROUND: Human malignant mesotheliomas (HMMs) are aggressive tumors that  arise from the mesothelium. They respond poorly to conventional tumor treatment  and outcome is often fatal. Inactivating mutations of the neurofibromatosis type  2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene merlin have been described in nearly 60% of  primary malignant mesothelioma and in approximately 20% of the mesothelioma cell  lines. Studies regarding human NF2 schwannoma cells revealed a higher  proliferation and a larger noninactivating K(+) outward current compared with  controls. The enhanced proliferation of merlin-deficient NF2 schwannoma cells  could be reduced in the presence of quinidine, a K(+) channel blocker, whereas  the proliferation of normal Schwann cells is not affected. The current study was  undertaken to evaluate the effect of quinidine on the proliferation of HMM cell  lines in relation to their NF2 status. METHODS: Proliferation analyses using bromodeoxyuridine incorporation was  performed by immunocytochemical staining and fluorescence assisted cell sorting.  The patch-clamp technique was applied for electrophysiologic characterization of  the HMM cell lines. The cytochrome P450 2D6 locus, known to be mutated at high  frequencies in NF2 patients and to be specifically inhibited by quinidine, was  screened for mutations by cycle sequencing. RESULTS: Quinidine selectively reduces the proliferation of merlin-deficient HMM  cell lines by causing a G(0)/G(1) arrest, whereas the proliferation rates of  merlin-expressing HMM cell lines remain unchanged. The effect of quinidine on  the proliferation of HMM cell lines appears to be correlated with the NF2 gene  status but not with the K(+) outward current. No relation to cytochrome P450 2D6  mutations was detected. CONCLUSIONS: Quinidine or quinidine analogs are of potential therapeutic  interest for the subset of merlin-deficient mesothelioma tumors.

Author information: (1)Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics and The Cancer  Center, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.  Syntenin, a 33 kDa protein, interacts with several cell membrane receptors and  with merlin, the product of the causal gene for neurofibromatosis type II. We  report a crystal structure of the functional fragment of human syntenin  containing two canonical PDZ domains, as well as binding studies for full-length  syntenin, the PDZ tandem, and isolated PDZ domains. We show that the functional  properties of syntenin are a result of independent interactions with target  peptides, and that each domain is able to bind peptides belonging to two  different classes: PDZ1 binds peptides from classes I and III, while PDZ2  interacts with classes I and II. The independent binding of merlin by PDZ1 and  syndecan-4 by PDZ2 provides direct evidence for the coupling of  syndecan-mediated signaling to actin regulation by merlin.

Author information: (1)Department of Tumor Genetics and Biology, Kumamoto University School of  Medicine, Kumamoto 860-0811, Japan.  Neurofibromin, the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene product, contains a  central domain homologous to a family of proteins known as Ras-GTPase-activating  proteins (Ras-GAPs), which function as negative regulators of Ras. The loss of  neurofibromin function has been thought to be implicated in the abnormal  regulation of Ras in NF1-related pathogenesis. In this study, we found a novel  role of neurofibromin in neuronal differentiation in conjunction with the  regulation of Ras activity via its GAP-related domain (GRD) in neuronal cells.  In PC12 cells, time-dependent increases in the GAP activity of cellular  neurofibromin (NF1-GAP) were detected after NGF stimulation, which were  correlated with the down-regulation of Ras activity during neurite elongation.  Interestingly, the NF1-GAP increase was due to the induction of alternative  splicing of NF1-GRD type I triggered by the NGF-induced Ras activation.  Dominant-negative (DN) forms of NF1-GRD type I significantly inhibited the  neurite extension of PC12 cells via regulation of the Ras state. NF1-GRD-DN also  reduced axonal and dendritic branching/extension of rat embryonic hippocampal  neurons. These results demonstrate that the mutual regulation of Ras and NF1-GAP  is essential for normal neuronal differentiation and that abnormal regulation in  neuronal cells may be implicated in NF1-related learning and memory disturbance.

Author information: (1)Biomedicum Helsinki, Department of Pathology, Neuroscience Center, Institute  of Biotechnology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Central  Hospital, 00014 Helsinki, Finland. mikaela.gronholm@helsinki.fi  The cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, important in neuronal signaling, is  regulated by molecules that bind and target PKA regulatory subunits. Of four  regulatory subunits, RIbeta is most abundantly expressed in brain. The RIbeta  knockout mouse has defects in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, suggesting a role  for RIbeta in learning and memory-related functions. Molecules that interact  with or regulate RIbeta are still unknown. We identified the neurofibromatosis 2  tumor suppressor protein merlin (schwannomin), a molecule related to the  ezrin-radixin-moesin family of membrane-cytoskeleton linker proteins, as a  binding partner for RIbeta. Merlin and RIbeta demonstrated a similar expression  pattern in central nervous system neurons and an overlapping subcellular  localization in cultured hippocampal neurons and transfected cells. The proteins  were coprecipitated from brain lysates by cAMP-agarose and coimmunoprecipited  from cellular lysates with specific antibodies. In vitro binding studies  verified that the interaction is direct. The interaction appeared to be under  conformational regulation and was mediated via the alpha-helical region of  merlin. Sequence comparison between merlin and known PKA anchoring proteins  identified a conserved alpha-helical PKA anchoring protein motif in merlin.  These results identify merlin as the first neuronal binding partner for  PKA-RIbeta and suggest a novel function for merlin in connecting neuronal  cytoskeleton to PKA signaling.

Author information: (1)Department of Cell Biology, Neurobiology, and Anatomy, University of  Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio 45267-0521, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients are predisposed to learning  disabilities, macrocephaly, and brain tumors as well as abnormalities on  magnetic resonance imaging that are postulated to result from abnormal  myelination. Here we show that Nf1+/- spinal cords in adult mice have more than  twofold-increased numbers of NG2+ progenitor cells. Nf1-/- embryonic spinal  cords have increased numbers of Olig2+ progenitors. Also, cultures from Nf1  mutant embryos with hemizygous and biallelic Nf1 mutations have dramatically  increased numbers of CNS oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. In medium that allows  growth of neuroepithelial cells and glial progenitors, mutant cells  hyper-respond to FGF2, have increased basal and FGF-stimulated Ras-GTP, and fail  to accumulate when treated with a farnesyltransferase inhibitor. Cell  accumulation results in part from increased proliferation and decreased cell  death. In contrast to wild-type cells, Nf1-/- progenitors express the glial  differentiation marker O4 while retaining expression of the progenitor marker  nestin. Nf1 mutant progenitors also abnormally coexpress the glial  differentiation markers O4 and GFAP. Importantly, Nf1-/- spinal cord-derived  oligodendrocyte progenitors, which are amplified 12-fold, retain the ability to  form oligodendrocytes after in vivo transplantation. The data reveal a key role  for neurofibromin and Ras signaling in the maintenance of CNS progenitor cell  pools and also suggest a potential role for progenitor cell defects in the CNS  abnormalities of NF1 patients.

Utermark T(1), Kaempchen K, Hanemann CO.  Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Zentrum für klinische Forschung, University of Ulm,  Germany.  Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene coding for merlin cause Neurofibromatosis  type 2 (NF2), all spontaneous schwannomas, and a majority of meningiomas. Merlin  links transmembrane proteins to the cytoskeleton. Accordingly, primary human  schwannoma cells lacking merlin show an increased number of lamellipodia and  filopodia as well as increased cell spreading. We show enhanced adhesion in  primary human schwannoma cells and present evidence that this is dependent on  the integrin chains alpha6beta1 and alpha6beta4. We further demonstrate that the  integrin chains beta1 and beta4 are upregulated in schwannomas using different  complementary methods, and report higher expression of these integrins per  schwannoma cell by fluorescence assisted cell sorting (FACS). Finally we report  clustering of the integrin chains alpha6, beta1, and beta4 on schwannoma cells.  Our findings fit well into recent data on the role of merlin in signaling  cascades connected to integrins and help explain pathological ensheathment of  extracellular matrix or pseudomesaxon formation which is a hallmark of  schwannoma histopathology.

PMID:1362901,The role of Gln61 and Glu63 of Ras GTPases in their activation by NF1 and Ras GAP.,"The role of Gln61 and Glu63 of Ras GTPases in their activation by NF1 and Ras  GAP.  Nur-E-Kamal MS(1), Maruta H.  Author information: (1)Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria,  Australia.  Two distinct GAPs of 120 and 235 kDa called GAP1 and NF1 serve as attenuators of  Ras, a member of GTP-dependent signal transducers, by stimulating its intrinsic  guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity. The GAP1 (also called Ras GAP) is  highly specific for Ras and does not stimulate the intrinsic GTPase activity of  Rap1 or Rho. Using GAP1C, the C-terminal GTPase activating domain (residues  720-1044) of bovine GAP1, we have shown previously that the GAP1 specificity is  determined by the Ras domain (residues 61-65) where Gln61 plays the primary  role. The corresponding domain (residues 1175-1531) of human NF1 (called NF1C),  which shares only 26% sequence identity with the GAP1C, also activates Ras  GTPases. In this article, we demonstrate that the NF1C, like the GAP1C, is  highly specific for Ras and does not activate either Rap1 or Rho GTPases.  Furthermore, using a series of chimeric Ras/Rap1 and mutated Ras GTPases, we  show that Gln at position 61 of the GTPases primarily determines that NF1C as  well as GAP1C activates Ras GTPases, but not Rap1 GTPases, and Glu at position  63 of the GTPases is required for maximizing the sensitivity of Ras GTPases to  both NF1C and GAP1C. Interestingly, replacement of Glu63 of c-HaRas by Lys  reduces its intrinsic GTPase activity and abolishes the GTPase activation by  both NF1C and GAP1C. Thus, the potentiation of oncogenicity by Lys63 mutation of  c-HaRas appears primarily to be due to the loss of its sensitivity to the two  major Ras signal attenuators (NF1 and GAP1).

We describe a high-resolution radiation hybrid map of the region on human  chromosome 22 containing the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) gene. Eighty-five  hamster-human somatic cell hybrids generated by X-irradiation and cell fusion  were used to generate the radiation hybrid map. The presence or absence of 18  human chromosome 22-specific markers was determined in each hybrid by using  Southern blot hybridization. Sixteen of the 18 markers were distinguishable by  X-ray breakage in the radiation hybrids. Analysis of these data using two  different mathematical models and two different statistical methods resulted in  a single framework map consisting of 8 markers ordered with odds greater than  1000:1. The remaining nonframework markers were all localized to regions  consisting of two adjoining intervals on the framework map with odds greater  than 1000:1. Based on the RH map, the NF2 region of chromosome 22, defined by  the flanking markers D22S1 and D22S28, is estimated to span a physical distance  of approximately 6 Mb and is the most likely location for 9 of the 18 markers  studied: D22S33, D22S41, D22S42, D22S46, D22S56, LIF, D22S37, D22S44, and  D22S15.

Dasgupta B(1), Dugan LL, Gutmann DH.  Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis,  Missouri 63110, USA.  Individuals with the neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1)-inherited tumor predisposition  syndrome develop low-grade astrocytomas. The NF1 tumor suppressor gene product  neurofibromin exhibits GTPase-activating activity (GAP) toward RAS, such that  loss of neurofibromin expression leads to high levels of activated RAS and  increased cell proliferation. Previous work has demonstrated that Nf1  inactivation in astrocytes leads to increased cell proliferation in vitro and in  vivo, accompanied by increased RAS pathway activation. Studies on Nf1 mutant  Drosophila have suggested that neurofibromin might also regulate cAMP signaling.  Because intracellular cAMP levels have profound effects on astrocyte growth  control, we sought to determine the contribution of neurofibromin to astrocyte  cAMP regulation. In this report, we demonstrate that Nf1 inactivation in  astrocytes results in reduced cAMP generation in response to PACAP and  attenuated calcium influx and Rap1 activation. Based on the differential effects  of forskolin and dibutyryl-cAMP on Nf1-/- astrocytes, neurofibromin likely  functions at the level of adenylyl cyclase activation. Last, the reintroduction  of a fragment of neurofibromin containing residues sufficient for restoring  RAS-GAP function in Nf1-/- cells resulted in only partial restoration of  neurofibromin-mediated cAMP regulation. These results demonstrate that  neurofibromin positively influences cAMP generation and activation of cAMP  growth regulatory targets in astrocytes and expands the role of the NF1 gene in  astrocyte growth regulation.

We describe a novel interaction between merlin and p21-activated  kinase 1 (Pak1), which is dynamic and facilitated upon increased cellular  confluence. Merlin inhibits the activation of Pak1, as the loss of merlin  expression results in the inappropriate activation of Pak1 under conditions  associated with low basal activity. Conversely, the overexpression of merlin in  cells that display a high basal activity of Pak1 resulted in the inhibition of  Pak1 activation. This inhibitory function of merlin is mediated through its  binding to the Pak1 PBD and by inhibiting Pak1 recruitment to focal adhesions.  This link provides a possible mechanism for the effect of loss of merlin  expression in tumorigenesis.

Warren C(1), James LA, Ramsden RT, Wallace A, Baser ME, Varley JM, Evans DG.  Author information: (1)Cancer Research UK Department of Cancer Genetics, The Paterson Institute for  Cancer Research, Manchester, UK.  BACKGROUND: Schwannomas are benign tumours of the nervous system that are  usually sporadic but also occur in the inherited disorder neurofibromatosis type  2 (NF2). The NF2 gene is a tumour suppressor on chromosome 22. Loss of  expression of the NF2 protein product, merlin, is universal in both sporadic and  NF2 related schwannomas. The GTPase signalling molecules RhoA and Rac1 regulate  merlin function, but to date only mutation in the NF2 gene has been identified  as a causal event in schwannoma formation. METHODS: Comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) was used to screen 76  vestibular schwannomas from 76 patients (66 sporadic and 10 NF2 related) to  identify other chromosome regions that may harbour genes involved in the  tumorigenesis. RESULTS: The most common change was loss on chromosome 22, which was more  frequent in sporadic than in NF2 related tumours. Importantly, eight tumours  (10%) showed gain of copy number on chromosome 9q34. Each of the two NF2  patients who had received stereotactic radiotherapy had non-chromosome 22  changes, whereas only one of eight non-irradiated NF2 patients had any  chromosome changes. Three tumours had gain on 17q, which has also been reported  in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours that are associated with  neurofibromatosis type 1. Other sites that were identified in three or fewer  tumours were regions on chromosomes 10, 11, 13, 16, 19, 20, X, and Y. CONCLUSIONS: These findings should be verified using techniques that can detect  smaller genetic changes, such as microarray-CGH.

Mast cell infiltration is a well-known phenomenon; however, their  role in tumor pathogenesis has been enigmatic. In an elegant set of experiments  using cells derived from a murine model of neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), Yang et  al. dissect the molecular pathways involved in mast cell migration to  neurofibromin-deficient Schwann cells. These results set the stage for rational  development of therapeutics that could influence the multicellular  microenvironment of neurofibromas to inhibit the development and/or progression  of these tumors in human NF1.

The NF1 tumor suppressor gene encodes a GTPase-activating protein called  neurofibromin that negatively regulates Ras signaling. Mutations in NF1 cause  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). The development of neurofibromas, which are  complex tumors composed of multiple cell types, is a hallmark of NF1. Somatic  inactivation of murine Nf1 in Schwann cells is necessary, but not sufficient, to  initiate neurofibroma formation. Neurofibromas occur with high penetrance in  mice in which Nf1 is ablated in Schwann cells in the context of a heterozygous  mutant (Nf1+/-) microenvironment. Mast cells infiltrate neurofibromas, where  they secrete proteins that can remodel the ECM and initiate angiogenesis. Thus,  identification of mechanisms responsible for mast cell migration to tumor  microenvironments is important for understanding tumorigenesis and for designing  potential therapies. Here, we show that homozygous Nf1 mutant (Nf1-/-) Schwann  cells secrete Kit ligand (KitL), which stimulates mast cell migration, and that  Nf1+/- mast cells are hypermotile in response to KitL. Furthermore, we link  hyperactivation of the Ras-class IA-PI3K-Rac2 pathway to increased Nf1+/- mast  cell migration. Thus, these studies identify a novel interaction between Nf1-/-  Schwann cells and Nf1+/- mast cells that is likely to be important in  neurofibroma formation.

Author information: (1)Neuroscience Genome Research Center, The Catholic University of Korea, 505  Banpo-dong, Socho-gu, Seoul 137-701, Korea.  The stability of p53 tumor suppressor is regulated by Mdm2 via the  ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated proteolysis pathway. The c-Abl and PTEN  tumor suppressors are known to stabilize p53 by blocking the Mdm2-mediated p53  degradation. This study investigated the correlation between p53 and merlin, a  neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2)-related tumor suppressor, in association with the Mdm2  function. The results showed that merlin increased the p53 stability by  inhibiting the Mdm2-mediated degradation of p53, which accompanied the increase  in the p53-dependent transcriptional activity. The stabilization of p53 by  merlin appeared to be accomplished through Mdm2 degradation, and the N-terminal  region of merlin was responsible for this novel activity. This study also showed  that overexpression of merlin-induced apoptosis of cells depending  preferentially on p53 in response to the serum starvation or a chemotherapeutic  agent. These results suggest that merlin could be a positive regulator of p53 in  terms of tumor suppressor activity, and provide the promising therapeutic means  for treating tumors with non-functional merlin or Mdm2 overexpression.

PMID:14724565,Role of TC21/R-Ras2 in enhanced migration of neurofibromin-deficient Schwann cells.,"Role of TC21/R-Ras2 in enhanced migration of neurofibromin-deficient Schwann  cells.  Huang Y(1), Rangwala F, Fulkerson PC, Ling B, Reed E, Cox AD, Kamholz J, Ratner  N.  Author information: (1)Department of Cell Biology, Neurobiology and Anatomy, University of  Cincinnati, College of Medicine, 3125 Eden Ave., Cincinnati, OH 45267-0521, USA.  The neurofibromatosis type 1 tumor suppressor protein neurofibromin, is a GTPase  activating protein for H-, N-, K-, R-Ras and TC21/R-Ras2 proteins. We  demonstrate that Schwann cells derived from Nf1-null mice have enhanced  chemokinetic and chemotactic migration in comparison to wild-type controls.  Surprisingly, this migratory phenotype is not inhibited by a farnesyltransferase  inhibitor or dominant-negative (dn) (N17)H-Ras (which inhibits H-, N-, and K-Ras  activation). We postulated that increased activity of R-Ras and/or TC21/R-Ras2,  due to loss of Nf1, contributes to increased migration. Mouse Schwann cells  (MSCs) express R-Ras and TC21/R-Ras2 and their specific guanine exchange  factors, C3G and AND-34. Infection of Nf1-null MSCs with a dn(43N)R-Ras  adenovirus (to inhibit both R-Ras and TC21/R-Ras2 activation) decreases  migration by approximately 50%. Conversely, expression of activated  (72L)TC21/R-Ras2, but not activated (38V)R-Ras, increases migration, suggesting  a role of TC21/R-Ras2 activation in the migration of neurofibromin-deficient  Schwann cells. TC21/R-Ras2 preferentially couples to the phosphatidylinositol  3-kinase (PI3-kinase) and MAP kinase pathways. Treatment with a PI3-kinase or  MAP kinase inhibitor reduces Nf1-null Schwann cell migration, implicating these  TC21 effectors in Schwann cell migration. These data reveal a key role for  neurofibromin regulation of TC21/R-Ras2 in Schwann cells, a cell type critical  to NF1 tumor pathogenesis.

Author information: (1)Department of Tumor Genetics and Biology, Graduate School of Medical  Sciences, Kumamoto University, 1-1-1 Honjo, Kumamoto 860-8556, Japan.  Neurofibromin, a neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) tumor suppressor gene product,  has a domain acting as a GTPase activating protein and functions in part as a  negative regulator of Ras. Loss of neurofibromin expression in NF1 patients is  associated with elevated Ras activity and increased cell proliferation.  Therefore, regulation of the function of neurofibromin is heavily involved in  cell growth and differentiation. In the present study, we identified a novel  cellular neurofibromin-associating protein, 14-3-3, which belongs to a highly  conserved family of proteins that regulate intracellular signal transduction  events in all eukaryotic cells. The interaction of 14-3-3 is mainly directed to  the C-terminal domain (CTD) of neurofibromin, and the cAMP-dependent protein  kinase (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation clustered on CTD-Ser (2576, 2578, 2580,  2813) and Thr (2556) is required for the interaction. Interestingly, the  increased phosphorylation and association of 14-3-3 negatively regulate the  function of neurofibromin. These findings indicate that PKA phosphorylation  followed by 14-3-3 protein interaction may modulate the biochemical and  biological functions of neurofibromin.

Wolff RK(1), Frazer KA, Jackler RK, Lanser MJ, Pitts LH, Cox DR.  Author information: (1)Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Francisco 94143-0554.  The neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) gene has been hypothesized to be a recessive  tumor suppressor, with mutations at the same locus on chromosome 22 that lead to  NF2 also leading to sporadic tumors of the types seen in NF2. Flanking markers  for this gene have previously been defined as D22S1 centromeric and D22S28  telomeric. Identification of subregions of this interval that are consistently  rearranged in the NF2-related tumors would aid in better defining the disease  locus. To this end, we have compared tumor and constitutional DNAs, isolated  from 39 unrelated patients with sporadic and NF2-associated acoustic neuromas,  meningiomas, schwannomas, and ependymomas, at eight polymorphic loci on  chromosome 22. Two of the tumors studied revealed loss-of-heterozygosity  patterns, which is consistent with the presence of chromosome 22 terminal  deletions. By using additional polymorphic markers, the terminal deletion  breakpoint found in one of the tumors, an acoustic neuroma from an NF2 patient,  was mapped within the previously defined NF2 region. The breakpoint occurred  between the haplotyped markers D22S41/D22S46 and D22S56. This finding redefines  the proximal flanking marker and localizes the NF2 gene between markers  D22S41/D22S46 and D22S28. In addition, we identified a sporadic acoustic neuroma  that reveals a loss-of-heterozygosity pattern consistent with mitotic  recombination or deletion and reduplication, which are mechanisms not previously  seen in studies of these tumors. This finding, while inconsistent with models of  tumorigenesis that invoke single deletions and their gene-dosage effects, lends  further support to the recessive tumor-suppressor model.

Author information: (1)Centre for Medical Genetics, Ghent University Hospital, De Pintelaan 185-0K5,  9000 Ghent, Belgium.  Mutations in the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor gene predispose  individuals to a variety of benign and malignant tumors. Many tumor suppressors  'shuttle' between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, thus regulating their function.  By expressing different NF1 constructs in COS-7 cells (encompassing exons 28-49  and fused to the green fluorescent protein), we identified a functional nuclear  localization signal (NLS) in exon 43. Mutation of the NLS completely abolishes  the nuclear entry of the NF1-derivative fusion protein. A highly expressed  splice variant that lacks this NLS controls the localization and hence the  function of neurofibromin. The localization of neurofibromin in the nucleus may  provide novel clues to unknown functions for NF1.

Chen Y(1), Gutmann DH, Haipek CA, Martinsen BJ, Bronner-Fraser M, Krull CE.  Author information: (1)Division of Biological Sciences,University of Missouri-Colombia, Colombia,  Missouri 65211, USA.  The neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor protein merlin, or schwannomin,  functions as a negative growth regulator such that inactivating mutations in Nf2  predispose humans to tumors. In addition, merlin has a critical role during  embryonic development. Nf2-deficient mice die early during embryogenesis, with  defects in gastrulation and extraembryonic tissues. To investigate the function  of Nf2/merlin during embryonic development, we first identified the homologous  Nf2 gene in chicken (cNf2) and examined the distribution of chicken merlin  (c-merlin) during myogenesis. cNf2 encoded a full-length mRNA of 1,770  nucleotides and a protein of 589 residues. C-merlin shared high sequence  homology and common protein motifs with vertebrate and Drosophila merlins. In  addition, cNF2 functions as a negative growth regulator similar to human and  Drosophila merlin in vitro. In vivo, c-merlin was expressed diffusely in the  forming dermomyotome but down-regulated in migratory muscle precursors in the  forelimb. As muscle formed in the limb, c-merlin expression was up-regulated. As  an initial examination of c-merlin function during myogenesis, c-merlin was  ectopically expressed in muscle precursors and the effects on muscle development  were examined. We show that ectopic merlin expression reduces the proliferation  of muscle precursors as well as their ability to migrate effectively in limb  mesoderm. Collectively, these results demonstrate that c-merlin is  developmentally regulated in migrating and differentiating myogenic cells, where  it functions as a negative regulator of both muscle growth and motility.

Hiatt K(1), Ingram DA, Huddleston H, Spandau DF, Kapur R, Clapp DW.  Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine,  Indianapolis, Indiana 46202, USA.  Genetic loss of surface Fas antigen expression leads to reduced apoptosis of  myeloid and lymphoid progenitor cells, and a propensity to develop autoimmunity  and myeloid leukemia in mouse models. Oncogenic p21(ras) decreases surface Fas  antigen expression and renders fibroblasts resistant to Fas mediated apoptosis.  Neurofibromin, which is encoded by NF1, is a GTPase activating protein that  negatively regulates p21(ras) activity. NF1 loss leads to deregulation of  p21(ras)-effector pathways, which control myeloid cell survival. Heterozygous  inactivation of Nf1 increases mast cell numbers in Nf1 +/- mice, and enhances  mast cell survival in response to c-kit ligand (kit-L). Here, we show that  Nf1-deficient mast cells have reduced surface Fas antigen expression in response  to kit-L and are resistant to Fas ligand-mediated apoptosis. Using genetic  intercrosses between Nf1 +/- and class I (A)-PI-3K-deficient mice, we  demonstrate that hyperactivation of the p21(ras)-class I(A) PI-3K pathway is the  mechanism for this phenotype. Finally, we demonstrate that mast cells from both  Fas antigen-deficient mice and Nf1 +/- mice are resistant to apoptosis following  kit-L withdrawal in vivo. Thus, therapies designed to decrease p21(ras) activity  and up-regulate Fas antigen expression may limit the pathological accumulation  of myeloid cells in disease states where p21(ras) is hyperactivated.

Author information: (1)Catholic Neuroscience Center, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul  137-701, Korea.  The neurofibromatosis type 2 gene-encoded protein, merlin, is related to the ERM  (ezrin, radixin, and moesin) family of membrane-cytoskeleton-associated  proteins. Recent studies suggest that the loss of neurofibromatosis type 2  function contributes to tumor development and metastasis. Although the cellular  functions of merlin as a tumor suppressor are relatively well characterized, the  cellular mechanism whereby merlin controls cell proliferation from membrane  locations is still poorly understood. During our efforts to find potential  merlin modulators through protein-protein interactions, we identified  transactivation-responsive RNA-binding protein (TRBP) as a merlin-binding  protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen. The interaction between TRBP and merlin  was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays,  co-immunoprecipitation, and co-localization experiments. The carboxyl-terminal  regions of each protein were responsible for their interaction. Cells  overexpressing TRBP showed enhanced cell growth in cell proliferation assays and  also exhibited transformed phenotypes, such as anchorage-independent cell growth  and tumor development in mouse xenografts. Merlin efficiently inhibited these  oncogenic activities of TRBP in our experiments. These results provide the first  clue to the functional interaction between TRBP and merlin and suggest a novel  mechanism for the tumor suppressor function of merlin both in vitro and in vivo.

We have optimized a technique for in situ localization of specific mRNAs using  digoxigenin-11-dUTP-labeled oligonucleotide probes. DNA probes were synthesized  for type I and type II collagen as well as transforming growth factor-beta 1 and  2 (TGF beta 1 and TGF beta 2). Control experiments, such as competitive  inhibition, nonsense sequence hybridization, and RNAse digestion all indicated  that the technique was highly sensitive and specific. In sections of growth  plate, type II collagen mRNA was predominantly expressed in the lower  proliferative and upper hypertrophic zone, whereas chondrocytes in articular  cartilage stained equally. These techniques then were applied to sections cut  from archival pathology specimens of musculoskeletal tissues. Primitive  chondrocytes in a chondrosarcoma expressed type I and type II collagen mRNA, but  did not stain with the nonsense probe. Sections from an osteosarcoma, an  aneurysmal bone cyst, and a neurofibroma also were investigated. The ability to  use chemically synthesized oligonucleotide probes, the high resolution, and the  short development times possible with this in situ procedure makes this  technique appealing for applied research into the gene expression of normal and  pathologic cellular events.

Gene expression changes in the lungs induced by paraquat (PQ) administration  were studied in rats using DNA microarrays that were detectable for 1,090 genes  per DNA microarray. The rats were subjected to subacute PQ exposure (7 mg/kg,  s.c., daily for eight administrations). Two days after the final administration,  the rats were divided into two groups. Group 1 experienced significant body  weight loss and displayed signs of subacute PQ toxicity, but Group 2 showed no  significant effects due to the PQ treatment. A control group, Group 3, was also  included. In the comparison of the gene expression levels in the animals from  Group 1 or Group 2 to the control animals treated by vehicle, 48 genes in Group  1 and 29 genes from Group 2 were differentially expressed. The twenty-eight  genes were common to these two groups. These differentially expressed genes  following paraquat treatment were classified as follows: 5 neurotransmitter  receptor genes; 4 transporter genes; 4 voltage-gated ion channel genes; 2 lipid  metabolism enzyme genes; 2 G-proteins involved in endocytosis and exocytosis  genes; 7 cytokine genes; 4 ADP ribosylation genes involved in cell death and  regeneration; CFTR gene, which is the causal gene for cystic fibrosis;  neurofibromatosis type 1 gene, which is the causal gene for the  neurofibromatosis type 1 that is known to accompany pulmonary fibrosis; and the  causal gene for spinocerebellar ataxia.

Author information: (1)Laboratoire de Génétique Moléculaire-UPRES EA 3618, Faculté des Sciences  Pharmaceutiques et Biologiques, Université Paris V, Paris, France.  pascale.levy@etu.univ-paris5.fr  BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder  with a complex range of clinical symptoms. The hallmark of NF1 is the onset of  heterogeneous (dermal or plexiform) benign neurofibromas. Plexiform  neurofibromas can give rise to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors  (MPNSTs), and the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. RESULTS: To obtain further insight into the molecular pathogenesis of MPNSTs, we  used real-time quantitative RT-PCR to quantify the mRNA expression of 489  selected genes in MPNSTs, in comparison with plexiform neurofibromas. The  expression of 28 (5.7%) of the 489 genes was significantly different between  MPNSTs and plexiform neurofibromas; 16 genes were upregulated and 12 were  downregulated in MPNSTs. The altered genes were mainly involved in cell  proliferation (MKI67, TOP2A, CCNE2), senescence (TERT, TERC), apoptosis  (BIRC5/Survivin, TP73) and extracellular matrix remodeling (MMP13, MMP9, TIMP4,  ITGB4). More interestingly, other genes were involved in the Ras signaling  pathway (RASSF2, HMMR/RHAMM) and the Hedgehog-Gli signaling pathway (DHH,  PTCH2). Several of the down-regulated genes were Schwann cell-specific (L1CAM,  MPZ, S100B, SOX10, ERBB3) or mast cell-specific (CMA1, TPSB), pointing to a  depletion and/or dedifferentiation of Schwann cells and mast cells during  malignant transformation of plexiform neurofibromas. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that a limited number of signaling pathways, and  particularly the Hedgehog-Gli signaling pathway, may be involved in malignant  transformation of plexiform neurofibromas. Some of the relevant genes or their  products warrant further investigation as potential therapeutic targets in NF1.

Author information: (1)Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of  Medicine, St Louis, MO 63110, USA. watsonm@pathbox.wustl.edu  Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are highly aggressive Schwann  cell neoplasms that are frequently associated with Type I Neurofibromatosis  (NF1) and respond poorly to current therapeutic regimens. To better understand  the molecular heterogeneity of these tumors, we performed gene expression  profiling on 25 NF1-associated and 17 sporadic MPNSTs using oligonucleotide  microarrays representing approximately 8100 unique human gene transcripts. Using  several previously reported statistical approaches, we were unable to identify a  molecular signature that could reliably distinguish between NF1-associated and  sporadic MPNSTs in independent training and test sample sets. However, using an  unsupervised clustering approach, we identified an extensive gene expression  signature that distinguished 9 of the 42 tumors analyzed. This signature  corresponded to relative overexpression of transcripts associated with  neuroglial differentiation (NCAM, MBP, L1CAM, P1P) and relative down-regulation  of proliferation and growth factor associated transcripts (IGF2, FGFR1, MDK,  Ki67). All tumors with this gene expression signature lacked expression of EGFR  and all but one tumor were derived from patients with NF1. However, there were  no other obvious associations with histological grade, tumor site, metastasis,  recurrence, age, or patient survival. We conclude that distinct molecular  classes of MPNST exist and that the ability to stratify these tumors based on  unique and biologically relevant gene expression profiles may be important for  future targeted therapeutics.

PMID:15570216,Targeted gene expression in the chicken eye by in ovo electroporation.,"Targeted gene expression in the chicken eye by in ovo electroporation.  Chen YX(1), Krull CE, Reneker LW.  Author information: (1)Departments of Ophthalmology, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA.  PURPOSE: The chicken embryo lens is a classical model system for developmental  and cell biology studies. To understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie  the morphological changes that occur during lens development, it is important to  develop an effective gene transfer method that permits the analysis of gene  functions in vivo. In ovo electroporation has been successfully used for  introducing DNA into neural and mesenchymal tissues of chicken embryos. In this  study, we explored the possibility of using this technique to manipulate gene  expression in lens epithelial and fiber cells, as well as in other cells of the  chicken eye. METHODS: Two DNA constructs were used in this study. pCAX contains a chicken  beta-actin promoter fused to the CMV IE enhancer to drive enhanced green  fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression. pMES-cNf2 uses the same chimeric promoter  to drive the expression of the chicken neurofibromatosis 2 (cNf2) and EGFP  proteins in the same cell. Plasmid DNA was injected into the lumen of the lens  vesicle in chicken embryos at stage 15. For corneal epithelial and retinal cell  electroporation, DNA was placed near the surface ectoderm in the eye region or  injected into the vitreous cavity, respectively. Electroporation was performed  with one electrode above the eye and the other underneath the head of the  embryo. Chicken embryos were harvested at different time points for EGFP  expression analysis by immunohistochemistry. 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU)  incorporation assays were used to evaluate the effects of cNf2 on lens  epithelial cell proliferation. RESULTS: A strong EGFP signal can be detected in lens cells 4 h after  electroporation. The transfected cells maintain high levels of EGFP expression  for at least 5 days. Overexpressing cNf2 in lens epithelial cells significantly  inhibits cell proliferation. Ectopic expression of EGFP in corneal epithelial  and retinal cells was also achieved by in ovo electroporation. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that exogenous DNA can be effectively  introduced into lens, corneal and retinal cells in the living embryo by in ovo  electroporation. In comparison to viral infection and transgenic mouse  approaches, in ovo electroporation offers an easier and quicker way to  manipulate gene expression during embryonic development. This technique will be  a useful tool for exploring the molecular mechanisms of lens and eye  development.  PMID: 15570216 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",True,In ovo electroporation gene transfer method

Rong R(1), Tang X, Gutmann DH, Ye K.  Author information: (1)Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of  Medicine, 615 Michael Street, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.  Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is a tumor suppressor, although the molecular  mechanism accounting for this effect remains unknown. Here, we show that merlin  exerts its activity by inhibiting phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase),  through binding to PIKE-L. Wild-type merlin, but not patient-derived mutant  (L64P), binds PIKE-L and inhibits PI3-kinase activity. This suppression of  PI3-kinase activity results from merlin disrupting the binding of PIKE-L to  PI3-kinase. In addition, merlin suppression of PI3-kinase activity as well as  schwannoma cell growth is abrogated by a single PIKE-L point mutation (P187L)  that cannot bind merlin but can still activate PI3-kinase. Knocking down PIKE-L  with RNA interference abolishes merlin's tumor-suppressive activity. Our data  support the hypothesis that PIKE-L is an important mediator of merlin growth  suppression.

Comment in     Cell Oncol. 2005;27(5-6):359; author reply 361. doi: 10.1155/2005/363704.  BACKGROUND AND METHODS: 44 peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNST) (27  schwannomas, 9 neurofibromas and 8 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors  (MPNST)) were analyzed to determine DNA ploidy pattern and to clarify the  conflicting data in the literature concerning this topic (whether benign PNSTs  are aneuploid or not). For further insight we analyzed 6 schwannomas, one  atypical neurofibroma and five MPNSTs by fluorescence in situ hybridization  (FISH) technique using centromeric chromosome probes (7, 17 and 18) and  automatic image analysis station, Metafer 4. RESULTS: Benign schwannomas (including the problematic variants as ancient,  cellular, neuroblastoma like and multiplex schwannomas) could be characterized  by euploid-polyploidisation and by their 4c peak height value which was usually  more than 10% of total cell number measured. These characters were not found  among neurofibromas and MPNST-s. FISH analysis revealed and confirmed that the  'normal' euploid-polyploid cells are mainly eusomic-polysomic containing two,  four, eight or sixteen signals for each chromosomes examined, but in a small  proportion aneusomy was found among tumor cells of benign schwannomas (average:  2.58; range 1.33-3.44). In contrast, the atypical neurofibroma displayed marked  aneusomy (18.44%) but it contained normal eusomic and polysomic cells too. Two  diploid MPNSTs proved to be clearly aneusomic with trisomy of chromosome 17 and  monosomy of chromosome 18. CONCLUSIONS: All these data suggest that ploidy pattern determination combined  with FISH analysis may be a very useful supplementary tool for making a right  diagnosis (to differentiate benign versus malignant schwannomas in problematic  variants) and to understand better the malignant transformation in PNSTs.

Furlong W(1), Barr RD, Feeny D, Yandow S.  Author information: (1)Centre for Health Economics and Policy Analysis, and Department of Clinical  Epidemiology and Biostatistics, McMaster University, Hamilton Canada.  furlongb@mcmaster.ca  The objectives of this report are to review the assessment of patient-focused  outcomes in pediatric orthopedic surgery, to describe a framework for  identifying appropriate sets of measures, and to illustrate an application of  the framework to a challenging orthopedic problem.A detailed framework of study  design and measurement factors is described. The factors are important for  selecting appropriate instruments to measure health status and health-related  quality of life (HRQL) in a particular context. A study to evaluate treatment  alternatives for patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 and congenital tibial  dysplasia (NF1-CTD) provides a rich illustration of the application of the  framework. The application involves great variability in the instrument  selection factors. Furthermore, these patients and their supportive caregivers  face numerous complex health challenges with long-term implications for HRQL.  Detailed summaries of important generic preference-based multi-attribute  measurement systems, pediatric health profile instruments, and pediatric  orthopedic-specific instruments are presented. Age-appropriate generic and  specific measures are identified for study of NF1-CTD patients. Selected  measures include the Activities Scale for Children, Gillette Functional  Assessment Questionnaire Walking Scale, Health Utilities Index, and Pediatric  Inventory of Quality of Life. Reliable and valid measures for application to  pediatric orthopedics are available. There are important differences among  measures. The selected measures complement each other. The framework in this  report provides a guide for selecting appropriate measures. Application of  appropriate sets of measures will enhance the ability to describe the morbidity  of pediatric orthopedic patients and to assess the effectiveness of alternative  clinical interventions. The framework for measurement of health status and HRQL  from a patient perspective has relevance to many other areas of orthopedic  practice.

Author information: (1)Departments of Cell Biology, Neurobiology, and Anatomy, University of  Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio 45267, USA.  Benign neurofibromas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors are serious  complications of neurofibromatosis type 1. The epidermal growth factor receptor  is not expressed by normal Schwann cells, yet is overexpressed in subpopulations  of Nf1 mutant Schwann cells. We evaluated the role of EGFR in Schwann cell  tumorigenesis. Expression of EGFR in transgenic mouse Schwann cells elicited  features of neurofibromas: Schwann cell hyperplasia, excess collagen, mast cell  accumulation, and progressive dissociation of non-myelin-forming Schwann cells  from axons. Mating EGFR transgenic mice to Nf1 hemizygotes did not enhance this  phenotype. Genetic reduction of EGFR in Nf1(+/-);p53(+/-) mice that develop  sarcomas significantly improved survival. Thus, gain- and loss-of-function  experiments support the relevance of EGFR to peripheral nerve tumor formation.

PMID:15659388,Erbin regulates mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation and MAP kinase-dependent interactions between Merlin and adherens junction protein complexes in Schwann cells.,"Erbin regulates mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation and MAP  kinase-dependent interactions between Merlin and adherens junction protein  complexes in Schwann cells.  Rangwala R(1), Banine F, Borg JP, Sherman LS.  Author information: (1)Division of Neuroscience, Oregon National Primate Research Center, Oregon  Health & Science University, Beaverton, Oregon 97006, USA.  Biallelic mutations in the neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) gene are linked to  schwannoma and meningioma tumorigenesis. Cells with NF2 mutations exhibit  elevated levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)  and aberrant cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts. The NF2 gene product, merlin,  associates with adherens junction protein complexes, suggesting that part of its  function as a tumor suppressor involves regulating cell junctions. Here, we find  that a novel PDZ protein, called erbin, binds directly to the merlin-binding  partner, EBP0, and regulates adherens junction dissociation through a MAP  kinase-dependent mechanism. Reducing erbin expression using a targeted siRNA in  primary cultures of Schwann cells results in altered cell-cell interactions,  disruption of E-cadherin adherens junctions, increased cell proliferation, and  elevated levels of phosphorylated ERK, all phenotypes observed in cells that  lack merlin. Reduction of erbin expression also results in the dissociation of  merlin from adherens junction proteins and an increase in the levels of  phosphorylated merlin. These phenotypes can be rescued if cells with reduced  levels of erbin are treated with a pharmacological inhibitor of ERK kinase.  Collectively, these data indicate that erbin regulates MAP kinase activation in  Schwann cells and suggest that erbin links merlin to both adherens junction  protein complexes and the MAP kinase signaling pathway.

PMID:15681480,Sensitive detection of deletions of one or more exons in the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) gene by multiplexed gene dosage polymerase chain reaction.,"Sensitive detection of deletions of one or more exons in the neurofibromatosis  type 2 (NF2) gene by multiplexed gene dosage polymerase chain reaction.  Diebold R(1), Bartelt-Kirbach B, Evans DG, Kaufmann D, Hanemann CO.  Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, University of Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, 89070  Ulm, Germany.  Mutation detection in the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) gene is challenging  because when combining mutation detection methods such as single-strand  conformational polymorphism and heteroduplex analysis, denaturing gradient gel  electrophoresis, and direct sequencing of aberrant polymerase chain reaction  (PCR) fragments only 30 to 60% of the constitutional mutations are detected.  Because large deletions and complete chromosome rearrangements are also  described methods such as microarray-comparative genomic hybridization and  fluorescence in situ hybridization are also used. The one type of mutation often  missed corresponds to deletions encompassing one or few exons. To detect this  type we have developed a swift and reliable method. We perform a gene dosage  analysis with two fluorescent multiplex PCR assays that amplify 15 of the 17 NF2  exons. The labeled PCR products are quantified and gene dose is calculated with  respect to controls. We tested the reliability of this method with DNA from  eight NF2 patients with known heterozygous NF2 deletions, eight controls and  four unknown NF2 patients. In all of the patients with known heterozygous  deletions we found in several exons a reduction of gene dosage to 50 to 69%. In  one NF2 patient with previously unknown mutation and a severe phenotype we found  the gene dosage of two exons reduced by 50% indicating a deletion of these two  exons on one allele. This finding was validated by reverse transcriptase-PCR on  fibroblast and schwannoma cell cultures of this patient and cDNA sequencing. Our  gene dosage assay will detect deletions of one or more exons as well as gross  deletions of the whole coding region of the gene. It can complement the existing  screening methods because it is faster and easier.

The lack of direct targets for TATA-binding protein (TBP)-like factors (TLFs)  confounds the understanding of their role in gene expression. Here we report  that human TLF (also called TBP-related factor 2 [TRF2]) activates a number of  different genes, including the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene. The  overexpression of TLF increases the amount of NF1 mRNA in cells. In vivo, TLF  binds to and upregulates transcription from a fragment of the NF1 promoter. In  vitro, purified TLF-TFIIA binds directly to the same NF1 promoter fragment that  is required for TLF responsiveness in cells. Furthermore, targeted deletion of  TLF in mice reduces NF1 levels. In contrast, TLF inhibits transcription driven  by a fragment from the TATA-containing c-fos promoter by sequestering TFIIA. TBP  affects the NF1 and c-fos promoters in a manner reciprocal to that of TLF,  stimulating the c-fos promoter and inhibiting NF1 transcription. We conclude  that TLF is a functional regulator of transcription with targets distinct from  those of TBP.

Baser ME(1), Mautner VF, Parry DM, Evans DG.  Author information: (1)michael.baser@verizon.net  Four longitudinal studies of vestibular schwannoma (VS) growth rates in  neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) have yielded very different results on the  relationship of VS growth rates to age. The studies had different patient  eligibility criteria, indices of VS growth rates, VS volumetric methods, and  sample sizes. We reanalysed data from two of the longitudinal studies and used  data from the population based United Kingdom NF2 Registry to determine the most  likely reason for the different results and the actual relationship of VS growth  rates to age. We found that the eligibility criterion in one study caused  selection bias for slower growing VS. The proper interpretation of the results  from the four studies is that VS growth rates in NF2 are highly variable but  tend to decrease with increasing age. Clinical trials for VS in NF2 should focus  on younger patients because VS growth rates tend to decrease with increasing  age, and because faster growing VS are more likely to be excised with increasing  age than slower growing VS.

Author information: (1)Park Hospital for Children, Old Road, Headington, Oxford OX3 7LQ, UK.  hilaryjohnson@onetel.com  The objective of this study was to explore the behaviour, including sleep  patterns, of children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). For this purpose we  designed a cross-sectional descriptive survey conducted by postal enquiry with  telephone follow-up. Simonds and Parraga's sleep questionnaire and the Strength  and Difficulties Questionnaire were used to screen sleep patterns and behaviours  respectively. Information was obtained for 64 children (39 male, mean age 10 y 7  mo, SD 4 y 1 mo, range 3 to 18 y; 57% response rate). There were increased  numbers of children with NF1 achieving scores in the borderline and abnormal  range for ratings of peer problems (p < 0.001), hyperactivity (p < 0.001),  emotional symptoms (p < 0.001), and conduct disorder (p < 0.05). Total  difficulties score was also high (p < 0.001) in the NF1 group. Only one group of  sleep problems, parasomnias (in particular sleepwalking and sleep terrors), had  a higher occurrence (p < or = 0.05) in the NF1 group than in the general  population. Within the NF1 group, conduct problems (p < or = 0.05),  hyperactivity (p < or = 0.01), emotional problems (p < or = 0.01), and the total  difficulties score (p < or = 0.01) were all significantly higher in children  with frequent sleep disturbance. We conclude that NF1 is associated with sleep  and behavioural problems in a high proportion of children. Psychiatric  conditions, e.g. attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder, may be underdiagnosed  on a large scale in children with NF1, and the use of simple screening tools in  clinical settings may prove beneficial.

Author information: (1)Division of Molecular Medicine, Ruder Bosković Institute, Bijenicka c 54,  HR-10000 Zagreb, Croatia. tcacev@irb.hr  BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Colon cancer tumorigenesis is a multistep process of  mutation accumulation in a number of oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes. NF1  gene protein, neurofibromin, acts as a tumour suppressor by turning the active  form of Ras into an inactive form. This molecular switch has an important role  in the control of the cell cycle and differentiation, and changes in Ras  activity are present in many different cancers. This is the first study to  investigate the role of NF1 in sporadic colon cancer. METHODS: We investigated loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the NF1 locus. Real  time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to determine NF1  mRNA expression in tumours and corresponding normal tissue. Expression of  neurofibromin was analysed by immunohistochemistry. Relative ratio of NF1 mRNA  type I and II isoform expression was also examined. RESULTS: LOH of the NF1 gene was detected in 20.7% of heterozygous samples. NF1  mRNA expression was significantly increased in tumour tissue compared with  corresponding normal tissue (p = 0.04291). There was a statistically significant  increase in NF1 type I isoform expression (p = 0.0005) in tumour tissue compared  with corresponding normal colon tissue. NF1 isoform type II was predominantly  expressed in normal tissue while the NF1 isoform type I prevailed in tumour  samples. The transition from dominant expression of isoform type II in normal  mucous tissue 15 cm away from the tumour to dominant expression of isoform type  I in tumour tissue itself was detected. Total neurofibromin expression increased  as tumours were more advanced but expression of wild-type neurofibromin remained  the same. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the NF1 gene may play a role in the  development and progression of colon cancer and the NF1 gene may be a potential  tumour marker and a new potential target for colon cancer therapy.

Author information: (1)Department of Applied Molecular Biosciences, Graduate School of  Bioagricultural Sciences, Nagoya University, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan.  Alix/AIP1 is a multifunctional adaptor protein involved in endocytosis, cell  adhesion, and cell death. By yeast two-hybrid screening we identified a novel  Alix/AIP1-interacting protein named Rab GTPase-activating protein-like protein  (RabGAPLP). Interaction between Alix and RabGAPLP was confirmed by pull-down  assays using fusion proteins of either glutathione-S-transferase (GST) or  chitin-binding domain (CBD) and lysates of cultured mammalian cells expressing  the respective proteins. Partial colocalization of FLAG-tagged RabGAPLP and  green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused Alix was observed at cell edges and  filopodia-like structures by fluorescence confocal laser scanning microscopic  analysis. The identity of RabGAPLP to merlin-associated protein (MAP), one of  the interacting partners of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene  product (merlin), implies cross-talk of membrane traffic and cell adhesion.

Author information: (1)Genetics Division, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and  Harvard Medical School, 458c NRB, 77 Louis Pasteur Avenue, Boston, MA 02115,  USA.  Erratum in     Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Nov 1;102(44):16119.  Loss-of-function mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene underlie the  familial cancer syndrome neurofibromatosis type I (NF1). The NF1-encoded  protein, neurofibromin, functions as a Ras-GTPase activating protein (RasGAP).  Accordingly, deregulation of Ras is thought to contribute to NF1 development.  However, the critical effector pathways involved in disease pathogenesis are  still unknown. We show here that the mTOR pathway is tightly regulated by  neurofibromin. mTOR is constitutively activated in both NF1-deficient primary  cells and human tumors in the absence of growth factors. This aberrant  activation depends on Ras and PI3 kinase, and is mediated by the phosphorylation  and inactivation of the TSC2-encoded protein tuberin by AKT. Importantly, tumor  cell lines derived from NF1 patients, and a genetically engineered cell system  that requires Nf1-deficiency for transformation, are highly sensitive to the  mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Furthermore, while we show that the activation of  endogenous Ras leads to constitutive mTOR signaling in this disease state, we  also demonstrate that in normal cells Ras is differentially required for mTOR  signaling in response to various growth factors. Thus, these findings identify  the NF1 tumor suppressor as an indispensable regulator of TSC2 and mTOR.  Furthermore, our results also demonstrate that Ras plays a critical role in the  activation of mTOR in both normal and tumorigenic settings. Finally, these data  suggest that rapamycin, or its derivatives, may represent a viable therapy for  NF1.

Author information: (1)Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, PRB  512, 23rd and Pierce, Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA.  Von Recklinghausen's disease is a relatively common familial genetic disorder  characterized by inactivating mutations of the Neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) gene  that predisposes these patients to malignancies, including an increased risk for  juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. However, NF1 mutations are not common in acute  myeloid leukemia (AML). Given that the RUNX1 transcription factor is the most  common target for chromosomal translocations in acute leukemia, we asked if NF1  might be regulated by RUNX1. In reporter assays, RUNX1 activated the NF1  promoter and cooperated with C/EBPalpha and ETS2 to activate the NF1 promoter  over 80-fold. Moreover, the t(8;21) fusion protein RUNX1-MTG8 (R/M), which  represses RUNX1-regulated genes, actively repressed the NF1 promoter. R/M  associated with the NF1 promoter in vivo and repressed endogenous NF1 gene  expression. In addition, similar to loss of NF1, R/M expression enhanced the  sensitivity of primary myeloid progenitor cells to granulocyte-macrophage  colony-stimulating factor. Our results indicate that the NF1 tumor suppressor  gene is a direct transcriptional target of RUNX1 and the t(8;21) fusion protein,  suggesting that suppression of NF1 expression contributes to the molecular  pathogenesis of AML.

Friedrich RE(1), Kluwe L, Fünsterer C, Mautner VF.  Author information: (1)Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic, Eppendorf University Hospital, University of  Hamburg, Germany. rfriedri@uke.uni-hamburg.de  Plexiform neurofibroma (PNF) is a typical feature of neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1).  About 10% of patients with NF1 develop malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors  (MPNST), usually arising from PNF, and this is the major cause of poor  prognosis. A better prognosis can be achieved if the tumors are diagnosed at an  early stage. Our objective was to establish magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  criteria for MPNST, and to test their usefulness in detecting early malignant  changes in PNF and to correlate the findings with the mutations of the NF1 gene. PATIENTS AND METHODS: NF1 outpatients were diagnosed according to the NIH  criteria. All patients underwent a complete dermatological, ophthalmological and  neurological examination and ultrasound of the abdomen between 1997 and 2002.  The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and all patients gave  informed consent to analyze clinical records and tumor material for scientific  purposes. MRI was performed with devices at 1.5 Tesla field strength (Siemens  Magnetom Symphony) or in some patients at 1.0 Tesla field strength (Siemens  Impact Expert). T1- and T2-weighted sequences including STIR-sequences were  acquired. Ultra-rapid image sequences with HASTE technique were performed for  trunk imaging. In patients with no contraindication for the application of  contrast media, Gadolinum-DTPA Magnevist was administered intravenously. RESULTS: MRI was performed on 50 patients with NF1 and nerve sheath tumors, of  whom 7 had atypical pain, tumor growth or neurological deficits indicative of  malignancy; the other 43 were asymptomatic. On MRI, all 7 symptomatic patients  had inhomogeneous lesions, due to necrosis and hemorrhage and patchy contrast  enhancement. In one patient, the multiplicity of confluent tumors with  inhomogeneous areas in addition to central lesions did not allow the exclusion  of malignancy. Only 3 of the 43 asymptomatic patients had comparable changes;  the other 40 patients had tumors of relatively homogeneous structure on T1- and  T2-weighted images before and after contrast enhancement. All 3 asymptomatic  patients with inhomogeneous lesions were shown to have MPNST. Analysis of  mutations of the NF1 gene of the 10 MPNST patients revealed a variety of  mutations. Concerning the correlation of genetic findings and MPNST in NF1, the  sample size of this study group was too small to define genotype-phenotype  relations. In this cohort, all types of mutations were found. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence for certain radiographic findings on  MRI in PNF of NF1 patients that have to be considered as signs of malignancy, in  particular indicating an MPNST. These findings are especially valuable in the  long term follow-up control of patients with large tumors (plexiform  neurofibromas).

Gershon TR(1), Oppenheimer O, Chin SS, Gerald WL.  Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York  Avenue, New York, NY 10021, USA. gershont@mskcc.org  Neuroectodermal tumor cells, like neural crest (NC) cells, are pluripotent,  proliferative, and migratory. We tested the hypothesis that genetic programs  essential to NC development are activated in neuroectodermal tumors. We examined  the expression of transcription factors PAX3, PAX7, AP-2alpha, and SOX10 in  human embryos and neuroectodermal tumors: neurofibroma, schwannoma,  neuroblastoma, malignant nerve sheath tumor, melanoma, medulloblastoma,  supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor, and Ewing's sarcoma. We also  examined the expression of P0, ERBB3, and STX, targets of SOX10, AP-2alpha, and  PAX3, respectively. PAX3, AP-2alpha, and SOX10 were expressed sequentially in  human NC development, whereas PAX7 was restricted to mesoderm. Tumors expressed  PAX3, AP-2alpha, SOX10, and PAX7 in specific combinations. SOX10 and AP-2alpha  were expressed in relatively differentiated neoplasms. The early NC marker,  PAX3, and its homologue, PAX7, were detected in poorly differentiated tumors and  tumors with malignant potential. Expression of NC transcription factors and  target genes correlated. Transcription factors essential to NC development are  thus present in neuroectodermal tumors. Correlation of specific NC transcription  factors with phenotype, and with expression of specific downstream genes,  provides evidence that these transcription factors actively influence gene  expression and tumor behavior. These findings suggest that PAX3, PAX7,  AP-2alpha, and SOX10 are potential markers of prognosis and targets for  therapeutic intervention.

Green JE(1), Baird AM, Hinrichs SH, Klintworth GK, Jay G.  Author information: (1)Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Frederick,  Maryland 21702-1201.  The expression of the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) tax gene  in transgenic mice has been shown to result in the development of neurofibromas.  Further characterization of these transgenic mice has revealed other significant  pathologic similarities between this transgenic mouse model and human  neurofibromatosis (NF). Pheochromocytomas of the adrenal medulla and hamartomas  of the iris are well-recognized manifestations of human NF. Adrenal medullary  tumors have been found in 68% of transgenic animals that were studied. They  appear, however, not to be pheochromocytomas, but rather composed of  undifferentiated spindle cells. Proliferation of fibroblastlike cells in the  iris also occurs in one-half of the transgenic animals surviving more than 6  months. Melanocytes, however, have not been found in the transgenic iris lesion,  although they are characteristically found in the Lisch nodules of human NF. The  similarities between human neurofibromatosis and this transgenic mouse model (in  which the overexpression of a single gene results in neoplasia) are discussed.  This transgenic system may provide further insights into molecular mechanisms  involved in the pathogenesis of neurofibromatosis.

Evans DG(1), Maher ER, Baser ME.  Author information: (1)University Department of Medical Genetics, St. Mary's Hospital, Manchester  M13 0JH, UK.  It has been suggested that somatic mutations that accumulate due to an age  related decline in the efficiency of DNA repair mechanisms might contribute to  the increased incidence of cancer in older people. However, there is little  direct evidence for this phenomenon. The spectra of germline and somatic  mutations can be compared in cancer genes that cause inherited tumour syndromes  and sporadic tumours, respectively. In addition, mosaic patients reflect the  nature of mutations that occur in early development. Hence, we hypothesised that  the ""temporal mutation record"" of a human cancer gene might provide insight into  mechanisms of mutagenesis in the germline, in early development, and in  adulthood. We compared the ratio of frameshift to nonsense mutations in three  diseases that are related to the NF2 tumour suppressor gene: classic  neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2), caused by germline NF2 mutations; mosaic NF2; and  unilateral sporadic vestibular schwannoma (USVS), caused by somatic NF2  inactivation. Nonsense mutations predominated in both classic and mosaic NF2,  but the ratio of nonsense to frameshift mutations was reversed in USVS.  Moreover, in USVS patients, the ratio of somatic frameshift to nonsense  mutations increased significantly with increasing age at diagnosis. This pattern  is consistent with an age related decline in the efficiency of DNA repair  mechanisms. Similar studies for other familial cancer genes may provide further  evidence for this hypothesis.

Hirokawa Y(1), Arnold M, Nakajima H, Zalcberg J, Maruta H.  Author information: (1)Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Parkville/Melbourne, Australia.  PAK1, a Rac/CDC42-dependent Ser/Thr kinase, is required for both  neurofibromatosis (NF) and RAS transformation in vivo. FK228, a histone  deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, activates a very specific set of genes such as the  tumor suppressor WAF1, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and  suppresses the growth of these tumors. In addition, this drug downregulates  cyclin D1, which is upregulated by RAS through PAK1, in breast cancers. In this  study, we demonstrate that FK228 at 0.1-1 nM significantly reduces the kinase  activity of PAK1 in these cells, without affecting the protein level of PAK1.  Interestingly, estrogen receptor (ER) and PAK1 mutually activate each other in  breast cancers. Here we provide an evidence suggesting that breast cancers  require PAK1 for their estrogen-dependent growth. Moreover, the treatment with  FK228 strongly inhibits the estrogen-dependent growth of human breast cancers  (both tamoxifen-sensitive and resistant cell lines) in vivo, suggesting that  FK228 and other anti-PAK1 drugs would be useful for the treatment of breast  cancers which become resistant to currently used estrogen antagonists such as  tamoxifen.

Wang Y(1), Nicol GD, Clapp DW, Hingtgen CM.  Author information: (1)Departments of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Indiana University School of  Medicine, Indianapolis, 46202, USA.  Comment in     J Neurophysiol. 2005 Dec;94(6):3659-60. doi: 10.1152/jn.00862.2005.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common genetic disorder characterized by  tumor formation. People with NF1 also can experience more intense painful  responses to stimuli, such as minor trauma, than normal. NF1 results from a  heterozygous mutation of the NF1 gene, leading to decreased levels of  neurofibromin, the protein product of the NF1 gene. Neurofibromin is a guanosine  triphosphatase activating protein (GAP) for Ras and accelerates the conversion  of active Ras-GTP to inactive Ras-GDP; therefore mutation of the NF1 gene  frequently results in an increase in activity of the Ras transduction cascade.  Using patch-clamp electrophysiological techniques, we examined the excitability  of capsaicin-sensitive sensory neurons isolated from the dorsal root ganglia of  adult mice with a heterozygous mutation of the Nf1 gene (Nf1+/-), analogous to  the human mutation, in comparison to wildtype sensory neurons. Sensory neurons  from adult Nf1+/- mice generated a more than twofold higher number of action  potentials in response to a ramp of depolarizing current as wild-type neurons.  Consistent with the greater number of action potentials, Nf1+/- neurons had  lower firing thresholds, lower rheobase currents, and shorter firing latencies  than wild-type neurons. Interestingly, nerve growth factor augmented the  excitability of wild-type neurons in a concentration-related manner but did not  further alter the excitability of the Nf1+/- sensory neurons. These data clearly  suggest that GAPs, such as neurofibromin, can play a key role in the  excitability of nociceptive sensory neurons. This increased excitability may  explain the painful conditions experienced by people with NF1.

PMID:16098465,Early inactivation of p53 tumor suppressor gene cooperating with NF1 loss induces malignant astrocytoma.,"Early inactivation of p53 tumor suppressor gene cooperating with NF1 loss  induces malignant astrocytoma.  Zhu Y(1), Guignard F, Zhao D, Liu L, Burns DK, Mason RP, Messing A, Parada LF.  Author information: (1)Center for Developmental Biology and Kent Waldrep Foundation Center for Basic  Research on Nerve Growth and Regeneration, University of Texas Southwestern  Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA.  Malignant astrocytoma, the most prevalent primary brain tumor, is resistant to  all known therapies and frequently harbors mutations that inactivate p53 and  activate Ras signaling. We have generated mouse strains that lack p53 and harbor  a conditional allele of the NF1 tumor suppressor that negatively regulates Ras  signaling. The mice develop malignant astrocytomas with complete penetrance. The  majority of tumors display characteristics of glioblastoma multiforme with  concomitant alteration of signaling pathways previously described in the human  counterparts of this neoplasm. We find that the sequence of tumor suppressor  inactivation influences tumorigenicity and that earliest evidence of tumor  formation localizes to regions of the brain that contain a multipotent stem cell  population capable of in vivo differentiation into neurons and glia.

Inagaki H(1), Ohye T, Kogo H, Yamada K, Kowa H, Shaikh TH, Emanuel BS, Kurahashi  H.  Author information: (1)Division of Molecular Genetics, Institute for Comprehensive Medical Science,  Fujita Health University, 1-98 Dengakugakubo, Kutsukake,Toyoake, Aichi 470-1192,  Japan.  Palindromic sequences are dispersed in the human genome and may cause  chromosomal translocations in humans. They constitute unsequenced gaps in the  human genome because of their resistance to PCR amplification, cloning into  vectors, and sequencing. We have overcome these difficulties by using a  combination of optimized PCR conditions, cloning in a recombination-deficient E.  coli strain, and RNA polymerases in sequencing. Using these methods, we analyzed  a palindromic AT-rich repeat (PATRR) in the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene  on chromosome 17 (17PATRR). The 17PATRR manifests a size polymorphism due to a  highly variable length of (AT)(n) dinucleotide repeats within the PATRR.  17PATRRs can be categorized into two types: a longer one that comprises a nearly  or completely perfect palindrome, and a shorter one that represents its deleted  asymmetric derivative. In vitro analysis shows that the longer 17PATRR is more  likely to form a cruciform structure than the shorter one. Two reported  t(17;22)(q11;q11) patients with NF1, whose breakpoints were identified within  the 17PATRR, have translocations that are derived from perfect or nearly perfect  palindromic alleles. This implies that the symmetric structure of a PATRR can  induce a translocation. We identified conserved PATRRs within the NF1 gene in  great apes and similar inverted repeats in two Old World monkeys, but not in New  World monkeys or other mammals. This indicates that the palindromic region  appeared approximately 25 million years ago and elongated during primate  evolution. Although such palindromic regions are usually unstable and disappear  rapidly due to deletion, the 17PATRR in the NF1 gene was stably conserved during  evolution for reasons that are still unknown.

Consoli C(1), Moss C, Green S, Balderson D, Cooper DN, Upadhyaya M.  Author information: (1)Institute of Medical Genetics, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.  Segmental neurofibromatosis type 1 (SNF1), characterized by the regionally  limited distribution of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) features, has been  attributed to mosaicism for an NF1 gene mutation. The occurrence of classical  NF1 in the offspring of a parent with SNF1 suggests that cutaneous mosaicism may  be accompanied by gonadal mosaicism. We studied a girl with generalized NF1, and  her mother who has SNF1. A recurrent nonsense mutation in exon 31 (R1947X) of  the NF1 gene was identified in the lymphocyte DNA of the affected child by  denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and PCR/direct sequencing. DNA  sequence analysis failed, however, to identify the R1947X mutation in peripheral  lymphocytes, and in keratinocytes and fibroblasts cultured from affected and  unaffected skin in the mother. DNA fragments containing exon 31 were then cloned  from each cell line and these clones were screened using allele-specific PCR.  The R1947X mutation was identified in 29 of 146 clones derived from  keratinocytes from the affected region and in 12 of 136 clones derived from  fibroblasts from the affected region, but in no clones derived from clinically  unaffected tissues. These findings confirm that gonosomal mosaicism can occur in  SNF1, with consequent important implications for genetic counselling.

Author information: (1)Department of Tumor Genetics and Biology, Graduate School of Medical  Sciences, Kumamoto University, Japan.  Neurofibromin is a neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor gene product  with a domain that acts as a GTPase-activating protein and functions, in part,  as a negative regulator of Ras. Loss of neurofibromin expression in NF1 patients  is associated with elevated Ras activity and increased cell proliferation,  predisposing to a variety of tumors of the peripheral and central nervous  systems. We show here, using the small interfering RNA (siRNA) technique, that  neurofibromin dynamically regulates actin cytoskeletal reorganization, followed  by enhanced cell motility and gross cell aggregation in Matrigel matrix. NF1  siRNA induces characteristic morphological changes, such as excessive actin  stress fiber formation, with elevated negative phosphorylation levels of  cofilin, which regulates actin cytoskeletal reorganization by depolymerizing and  severing actin filaments. We found that the elevated phosphorylation of cofilin  in neurofibromin-depleted cells is promoted by activation of a Rho-ROCK-LIMK2  pathway, which requires Ras activation but is not transduced through three major  Ras-mediated downstream pathways via Raf, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and  RalGEF. In addition, the exogenous expression of the NF1-GTPase-activating  protein-related domain suppressed the NF1 siRNA-induced phenotypes.  Neurofibromin was demonstrated to play a significant role in the machinery  regulating cell proliferation and in actin cytoskeletal reorganization, which  affects cell motility and adhesion. These findings may explain, in part, the  mechanism of multiple neurofibroma formation in NF1 patients.

Therapy-induced cancers are a severe complication of genotoxic therapies. We  used heterozygous Nf1 mutant mice as a sensitized genetic background to  investigate tumor induction by radiation (RAD) and cyclophosphamide (CY).  Mutagen-exposed Nf1(+/-) mice developed secondary cancers that are common in  humans, including myeloid malignancies, sarcomas, and breast cancers. RAD  cooperated strongly with heterozygous Nf1 inactivation in tumorigenesis. Most of  the solid tumors showed loss of the wild-type Nf1 allele but retained two Trp53  alleles. Comparative genomic hybridization demonstrated distinct patterns of  copy number aberrations in sarcomas and breast cancers from Nf1 mutant mice, and  tumor cell lines showed deregulated Ras signaling.

Jung JR(1), Kim H, Jeun SS, Lee JY, Koh EJ, Ji C.  Author information: (1)Department of Neurosurgery, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 137-701,  Korea.  The neurofibromatosis type2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene product, merlin, is  structurally related to the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) family of proteins that  anchor the actin cytoskeleton to specific membrane proteins and participate in  cell signaling. However, the basis of the tumor suppressing activity of merlin  is not well understood. Previously, we identified a role of merlin as an  inhibitor of the Ras-ERK signaling pathway. Recent studies have suggested that  phosphorylation of merlin, as of other ERM proteins, may regulate its function.  To determine whether phosphorylation of merlin affects its suppression of  Ras-ERK signaling, we generated plasmids expressing full-length merlin with  substitutions of serine 518, a potential phosphorylation site. A substitution  that mimics constitutive phosphorylation (S518D) abrogated the ability of merlin  to suppress effects of the Ras-ERK signaling pathway such as Ras-induced SRE  transactivation, Elk-mediated SRE transactivation, Ras-induced ERK  phosphorylation and Ras-induced focus formation. On the other hand, an S518A  mutant, which mimics nonphosphorylated merlin, acted like wild type merlin.  These observations show that mimicking merlin phosphorylation impairs not only  growth suppression by merlin but also its inhibitory action on the Ras-ERK  signaling pathway.

Individuals with germline mutations in NF1 are predisposed to the development of  benign and malignant tumors of the peripheral and central nervous system (CNS).  Children with this disease suffer a high incidence of optic gliomas, a benign  but potentially debilitating tumor of the optic nerve; and an increased  incidence of malignant astrocytoma, reactive astrogliosis and intellectual  deficits. In the present study, we have sought insight into the molecular and  cellular basis of NF1-associated CNS pathologies. We show that mice genetically  engineered to lack NF1 in CNS exhibit a variety of defects in glial cells.  Primary among these is a developmental defect resulting in global reactive  astrogliosis in the adult brain and increased proliferation of glial progenitor  cells leading to enlarged optic nerves. As a consequence, all of the mutant  optic nerves develop hyperplastic lesions, some of which progress to optic  pathway gliomas. These data point to hyperproliferative glial progenitors as the  source of the optic tumors and provide a genetic model for NF1-associated  astrogliosis and optic glioma.

Author information: (1)Institute of Cytology and Genetics, Russian Academy of Sciences, 630090,  Novosibirsk, Russia. ksu@bionet.nsc.ru  BACKGROUND: Merlin, the product of the Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) tumor  suppressor gene, belongs to the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) subgroup of the  protein 4.1 superfamily, which links cell surface glycoproteins to the actin  cytoskeleton. While merlin's functional activity has been examined in mammalian  and Drosophila models, little is understood about its evolution, diversity, and  overall distribution among different taxa. RESULTS: By combining bioinformatic and phylogenetic approaches, we demonstrate  that merlin homologs are present across a wide range of metazoan lineages. While  the phylogenetic tree shows a monophyletic origin of the ERM family, the origin  of the merlin proteins is robustly separated from that of the ERM proteins. The  derivation of merlin is thought to be in early metazoa. We have also observed  the expansion of the ERM-like proteins within the vertebrate clade, which  occurred after its separation from Urochordata (Ciona intestinalis). Amino acid  sequence alignment reveals the absence of an actin-binding site in the  C-terminal region of all merlin proteins from various species but the presence  of a conserved internal binding site in the N-terminal domain of the merlin and  ERM proteins. In addition, a more conserved pattern of amino acid residues is  found in the region containing the so-called ""Blue Box,"" although some amino  acid substitutions in this region exist in the merlin sequences of worms, fish,  and Ciona. Examination of sequence variability at functionally significant  sites, including the serine-518 residue, the phosphorylation of which modulates  merlin's intra-molecular association and function as a tumor suppressor,  identifies several potentially important sites that are conserved among all  merlin proteins but divergent in the ERM proteins. Secondary structure  prediction reveals the presence of a conserved alpha-helical domain in the  central to C-terminal region of the merlin proteins of various species. The  conserved residues and structures identified correspond to the important sites  highlighted by the available crystal structures of the merlin and ERM proteins.  Furthermore, analysis of the merlin gene structures from various organisms  reveals the increase of gene length during evolution due to the expansion of  introns; however, a reduction of intron number and length appears to occur in  the merlin gene of the insect group. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate a monophyletic origin of the merlin proteins  with their root in the early metazoa. The overall similarity among the primary  and secondary structures of all merlin proteins and the conservation of several  functionally important residues suggest a universal role for merlin in a wide  range of metazoa.

S.cerevisiae demonstrated that the more palindromic alleles were inevitably  corrupted upon cloning in E.coli, but could be propagated intact in yeast. The  high quality sequence obtained from the yeast-based approach provides insight  into the various mechanisms that destabilize a palindrome in E.coli, yeast and  humans, into the diversification of a highly polymorphic site within the NF1  locus during primate evolution, and into the association between palindromy and  chromosomal translocation.

De Schepper S(1), Boucneau JM, Westbroek W, Mommaas M, Onderwater J, Messiaen L,  Naeyaert JM, Lambert JL.

The neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene product, neurofibromin, is known to  interact with Ras, thereby negatively regulating its growth-promoting function.  Although this is a well-established interaction, the discovery of other  neurofibromin interacting partners could reveal new functional properties of  this large protein. Using yeast two-hybrid analysis against a brain cDNA  library, we identified a novel interaction between the amyloid precursor protein  and the GTPase activating protein-related domain of neurofibromin. This  interaction was further analyzed in human melanocytes and confirmed by  immunoprecipitation and colocalization studies. In addition, we observed a  colocalization of amyloid precursor protein and neurofibromin with melanosomes.  Amyloid precursor protein has been proposed to function as a vesicle cargo  receptor for the motor protein kinesin-1 in neurons. This colocalization of  amyloid precursor protein and neurofibromin with melanosomes was lost in  melanocytes obtained from normal skin of a NF1 patient. We suggest that a  complex between amyloid precursor protein, neurofibromin, and melanosomes might  be important in melanosome transport, which could shed a new light on the  etiopathogenesis of pigment-cell-related manifestations in NF1.

Author information: (1)Department of Human Genetics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48109.  The yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) system (Burke et al., 1987, Science 236:  806-812) allows the direct cloning of large regions of the genome. A YAC contig  map of approximately 700 kb encompassing the region surrounding the type 1  neurofibromatosis (NF1) locus on 17q11.2 has been constructed. A single YAC  containing the entire NF1 locus has been constructed by homologous recombination  in yeast. In the process of contig construction a novel method of YAC end rescue  has been developed by YAC circularization in yeast and plasmid rescue in  bacteria. YACs containing homology to the NF1 region but mapping to another  chromosome have also been discovered. Sequences of portions of the homologous  locus indicate that this other locus is a nonprocessed pseudogene.

D'Angelo I(1), Welti S, Bonneau F, Scheffzek K.  Author information: (1)European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Structural and Computational Biology  Programme, Meyerhofstrasse 1, 69117 Heidelberg, Germany.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common tumour predisposition syndrome  associated with numerous clinical complications. Mutations in the tumour  suppressor gene NF1 are responsible for disease pathogenesis. This gene encodes  the 320 kDa protein neurofibromin, the only clearly defined function of which is  to act as a Ras-specific GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP). Here we report the  structural discovery of a novel module in neurofibromin, composed of a Sec14p  homologous segment and a previously undetected pleckstrin homology (PH)-like  domain of potentially novel function. We show phospholipid binding by this  bipartite module and identify residues that are involved in this activity; we  also show that the PH-like domain is not sufficient for lipid binding. The  unique architecture of the domain interface points to a model of how the PH-like  domain may regulate binding of a ligand by the Sec14 module.

Hirokawa Y(1), Nheu T, Grimm K, Mautner V, Maeda S, Yoshida M, Komiyama K,  Maruta H.  Author information: (1)Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Parkville/Melbourne, Australia.  There is increasing evidence that more than 70% of cancers including pancreatic,  breast and prostate cancers as well as neurofibromatosis (NF) are highly  addicted to abnormal activation of the Ser/Thr kinase PAK1 for their growth. So  far FK228 is the most potent among the HDAC (histone deacetylase) inhibitors  that block the activation of both PAK1 and another kinase AKT, downstream of  PI-3 kinase. However, FK228 is still in clinical trials (phase 2) for a variety  of cancers (but not for NF as yet), and not available for most cancer/NF  patients. Thus, we have been exploring an alternative which is already in the  market, and therefore immediately useful for the treatment of those desperate  cancer/NF patients. Here we provide the first evidence that extracts of Chinese/  Japanese peppercorns (Zanthoxyli Fructus) from the plant Zanthoxylum piperitum  called ""Hua Jiao""/""Sansho"", block selectively the key kinase PAK1, leading to  the downregulation of cyclin D1. Unlike FK228, these extracts do not inhibit AKT  activation at the concentrations that block either cancer growth or PAK1  activation. The Chinese pepper extract selectively inhibits the growth of  NF1-deficient malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) cells, without  affecting the growth of normal fibroblasts, and suppresses the growth of  NF1-deficient human breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) xenograft in mice. Our data  suggest that these peppercorn extracts would be potentially useful for the  treatment of PAK1-dependent NF such as MPNST, in addition to a variety of  PAK1-dependent cancers including breast cancers.

Hannan F(1), Ho I, Tong JJ, Zhu Y, Nurnberg P, Zhong Y.  Author information: (1)Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type I (NFI) is a common genetic disorder that causes nervous  system tumors, and learning and memory defects in humans, and animal models. We  identify a novel growth factor stimulated adenylyl cyclase (AC) pathway in the  Drosophila brain, which is disrupted by mutations in the epidermal growth factor  receptor (EGFR), neurofibromin (NF1) and Ras, but not Galpha(s). This is the  first demonstration in a metazoan that a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathway,  acting independently of the heterotrimeric G-protein subunit Galpha(s), can  activate AC. We also show that Galpha(s) is the major Galpha isoform in fly  brains, and define a second AC pathway stimulated by serotonin and histamine  requiring NF1 and Galpha(s), as well as a third, classical Galpha(s)-dependent  AC pathway, which is stimulated by Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-amide (FMRFamide) and  dopamine. Using mutations and deletions of the human NF1 protein (hNF1)  expressed in Nf1 mutant flies, we show that Ras activation by hNF1 is essential  for growth factor stimulation of AC activity. Further, we demonstrate that  sequences in the C-terminal region of hNF1 are sufficient for  NF1/Galpha(s)-dependent neurotransmitter stimulated AC activity, and for rescue  of body size defects in Nf1 mutant flies.

PMID:16524466,Cognitive dysfunction in NF1 knock-out mice may result from altered vesicular trafficking of APP/DRD3 complex.,"Cognitive dysfunction in NF1 knock-out mice may result from altered vesicular  trafficking of APP/DRD3 complex.  Donarum EA(1), Halperin RF, Stephan DA, Narayanan V.  Author information: (1)Developmental Neurogenetics Laboratory, Barrow Neurological Institute, St  Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center, Phoenix, AZ 85013, USA. edonarum@aol.com  BACKGROUND: It has been estimated that more than 50% of patients with  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) have neurobehavioral impairments which include  attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, visual/spatial learning disabilities,  and a myriad of other cognitive developmental problems. The biological  mechanisms by which NF1 gene mutations lead to such cognitive deficits are not  well understood, although excessive Ras signaling and increased GABA mediated  inhibition have been implicated. It is proposed that the cognitive deficits in  NF1 are the result of dysfunctional cellular trafficking and localization of  molecules downstream of the primary gene defect. RESULTS: To elucidate genes involved in the pathogenic process, gene expression  analysis was performed comparing the expression profiles in various brain  regions for control and Nf1+/- heterozygous mice. Gene expression analysis was  performed for hippocampal samples dissected from postnatal day 10, 15, and 20  mice utilizing the Affymetrix Mouse Genome chip (Murine 430 2.0). Analysis of  expression profiles between Nf1+/- and wild-type animals was focused on the  hippocampus because of previous studies demonstrating alterations in hippocampal  LTP in the Nf1+/- mice, and the region's importance in visual/spatial learning.  Network analysis identified links between neurofibromin and kinesin genes, which  were down regulated in the Nf1+/- mice at postnatal days 15 and 20. CONCLUSION: Through this analysis, it is proposed that neurofibromin forms a  binding complex with amyloid precursor protein (APP) and through filamin  proteins interacts with a dopamine receptor (Drd3). Though the effects of these  interactions are not yet known, this information may provide novel ideas about  the pathogenesis of cognitive defects in NF1 and may facilitate the development  of novel targeted therapeutic interventions.

Author information: (1)Molecular Cardiology Research Institute, Tufts-New England Medical Center,  Tufts University School of Medicine, 750 Washington Street, Boston, MA 02111,  USA.  The Ras --> Raf --> MEK1/2 --> extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway couples mitogenic signals to  cell proliferation. B-Raf and Raf-1 function within an oligomer wherein they are  regulated in part by mutual transactivation. The MAPK kinase kinase (MAP3K)  mixed-lineage kinase 3 (MLK3) is required for mitogen activation of B-Raf and  cell proliferation. Here we show that the kinase activity of MLK3 is not  required for support of B-Raf activation. Instead, MLK3 is a component of the  B-Raf/Raf-1 complex and is required for maintenance of the integrity of this  complex. We show that the activation of ERK and the proliferation of human  schwannoma cells bearing a loss-of-function mutation in the neurofibromatosis 2  (NF2) gene require MLK3. We find that merlin, the product of NF2, blunts the  activation of both ERK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Finally, we  demonstrate that merlin and MLK3 can interact in situ and that merlin can  disrupt the interactions between B-Raf and Raf-1 or those between MLK3 and  either B-Raf or Raf-1. Thus, MLK3 is part of a multiprotein complex and is  required for ERK activation. The levels of this complex may be negatively  regulated by merlin.

Nakai Y(1), Zheng Y, MacCollin M, Ratner N.  Author information: (1)Division of Experimental Hematology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Research  Foundation, Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio  45229, USA.  Schwann cell-axon interaction is the hallmark feature of peripheral nerves, yet  the intracellular signals underlying this interaction are unknown. Schwann cells  extend processes and migrate on developing axons before differentiation,  requiring coordinated regulation of the Schwann cell cytoskeleton. Small GTPases  of the Rho family, including Rho, Rac, and cell division cycle 42, regulate the  actin cytoskeleton. The neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) gene is commonly mutated  in schwannomas, Schwann cell tumors that contain cells lacking axon interaction.  NF2 is involved in suppression of Rac signaling, and cultured schwannoma cells  contain elevated, GTP-bound, active Rac. Despite these previous studies, a  causal relationship between Rac activation and the abnormal cellular morphology  of schwannoma is unknown. We used fluorescence resonance energy transfer to  follow Rac activity in normal human Schwann cells and schwannoma cells during  interaction with neurons. Normal Schwann cells elongated processes along  neurites under low Rac activity. Schwannoma cells showed high Rac activity at  distal regions of the cells and failed to align processes with neurites.  Application of a Rac-specific inhibitor, the chemical compound NSC23766, to  schwannoma cells restored neuronal interaction. The data support the  significance of regulated Rac signaling in mediating Schwann cell-axon  interaction and suggest that controlling Rac activity as a possible therapy for  schwannomas.

Maitra S(1), Kulikauskas RM, Gavilan H, Fehon RG.  Author information: (1)Department of Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology, University of Chicago,  Illinois 60637, USA.  The precise coordination of signals that control proliferation is a key feature  of growth regulation in developing tissues . While much has been learned about  the basic components of signal transduction pathways, less is known about how  receptor localization, compartmentalization, and trafficking affect signaling in  developing tissues. Here we examine the mechanism by which the Drosophila  Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor ortholog Merlin (Mer) and the related  tumor suppressor expanded (ex) regulate proliferation and differentiation in  imaginal epithelia. Merlin and Expanded are members of the FERM (Four-point one,  Ezrin, Radixin, Moesin) domain superfamily, which consists of  membrane-associated cytoplasmic proteins that interact with transmembrane  proteins and may function as adapters that link to protein complexes and/or the  cytoskeleton . We demonstrate that Merlin and Expanded function to regulate the  steady-state levels of signaling and adhesion receptors and that loss of these  proteins can cause hyperactivation of associated signaling pathways. In  addition, pulse-chase labeling of Notch in living tissues indicates that  receptor levels are upregulated at the plasma membrane in Mer; ex double mutant  cells due to a defect in receptor clearance from the cell surface. We propose  that these proteins control proliferation by regulating the abundance,  localization, and turnover of cell-surface receptors and that misregulation of  these processes may be a key component of tumorigenesis.

Nabeshima K(1), Iwasaki H, Nishio J, Koga K, Shishime M, Kikuchi M.  Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, Fukuoka University Hospital, Fukuoka 814-0180,  Japan. kaznabes@fukuoka-u.ac.jp  BACKGROUND: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including membrane-type (MT)-MMPs,  correlate with biological aggressiveness in many carcinomas. However, their  roles in peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) have rarely been investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, the immunohistochemical expression of 6  MMPs, their 3 inhibitors and emmprin, an MMP inducer, was examined in 14  schwannomas, 14 neurofibromas and 12 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors  (MPNSTs) in relation to malignant potentials. RESULTS: Higher expression levels (>3+) of emmprin and MT1-MMP were noted in  83.3% and 16.7% of MPNSTs, respectively, versus none in schwannomas and  neurofibromas (p<0.0001). The overall expression rate (1-4+) of MT1-MMP was  58.3% in MPNSTs versus 7.1% in both schwannomas and neurofibromas (p=0.0093).  Gelatinase A (MMP-2) showed higher expression levels (>3+) in all the tumors  without significant differencies. Moreover, the expression patterns of MMP-1 and  gelatinase B (MMP-9) could divide PNSTs into two groups: schwannoma versus  neurofibroma/MPNST. Higher expression levels (>3+) of MMP-9 were observed in 50%  of schwannomas versus none in neurofibromas and MPNSTs, while those of MMP-1  were found in 35.7% of neurofibromas and 66.7% of MPNSTs versus none in  schwannomas. RECK was the main inhibitor expressed in these 3 tumors, with no  significant differences. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that emmprin and MT1-MMP may be malignant  potential-related proteins in PNSTs, and that MMP-1 and 9 may help  differentiation between schwannoma and neurofibroma, especially in their  plexiform types.

Electronic address: heitm001@duke.edu.  The G protein-coupled receptor Gpr1 and associated Galpha subunit Gpa2 govern  dimorphic transitions in response to extracellular nutrients by signaling  coordinately with Ras to activate adenylyl cyclase in the yeast Saccharomyces  cerevisiae. Gpa2 forms a protein complex with the kelch Gbeta mimic subunits  Gpb1/2, and previous studies demonstrate that Gpb1/2 negatively control cAMP-PKA  signaling via Gpa2 and an unknown second target. Here, we define these targets  of Gpb1/2 as the yeast neurofibromin homologs Ira1 and Ira2, which function as  GTPase activating proteins of Ras. Gpb1/2 bind to a conserved C-terminal domain  of Ira1/2, and loss of Gpb1/2 results in a destabilization of Ira1 and Ira2,  leading to elevated levels of Ras2-GTP and unbridled cAMP-PKA signaling. Because  the Gpb1/2 binding domain on Ira1/2 is conserved in the human neurofibromin  protein, an analogous signaling network may contribute to the neoplastic  development of neurofibromatosis type 1.

Wells Center for Pediatric Research,  Indiana University School of Medicine, 1044 W. Walnut Street, Indianapolis, IN  46202, USA.  Neurofibromas are common tumors found in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)  patients. These complex tumors are composed of Schwann cells, mast cells,  fibroblasts and perineurial cells embedded in collagen that provide a lattice  for tumor invasion. Genetic studies demonstrate that in neurofibromas,  nullizygous loss of Nf1 in Schwann cells and haploinsufficiency of Nf1 in  non-neuronal cells are required for tumorigenesis. Fibroblasts are a major  cellular constituent in neurofibromas and are a source of collagen that  constitutes approximately 50% of the dry weight of the tumor. Here, we show that  two of the prevalent heterozygous cells found in neurofibromas, mast cells and  fibroblasts interact directly to contribute to tumor phenotype. Nf1+/- mast  cells secrete elevated concentrations of the profibrotic transforming growth  factor-beta (TGF-beta). In response to TGF-beta, both murine Nf1+/- fibroblasts  and fibroblasts from human neurofibromas proliferate and synthesize excessive  collagen, a hallmark of neurofibromas. We also establish that the TGF-beta  response occurs via hyperactivation of a novel Ras-c-abl signaling pathway.  Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of c-abl reverses fibroblast proliferation  and collagen synthesis to wild-type levels. These studies identify a novel  molecular target to inhibit neurofibroma formation.

Akhmametyeva EM(1), Mihaylova MM, Luo H, Kharzai S, Welling DB, Chang LS.  Author information: (1)Center for Childhood Cancer, Children's Research Institute, Children's  Hospital, Columbus, Ohio, USA.  Mutations in the Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) gene are associated with  predisposition to vestibular schwannomas, spinal schwannomas, meningiomas, and  ependymomas. Presently, how NF2 is expressed during embryonic development and in  the tissues affected by neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) has not been well  defined. To examine NF2 expression in vivo, we generated transgenic mice  carrying a 2.4-kb NF2 promoter driving beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) with a  nuclear localization signal. Whole-mount embryo staining revealed that the NF2  promoter directed beta-gal expression as early as embryonic day E5.5. Strong  expression was detected at E6.5 in the embryonic ectoderm containing many  mitotic cells. beta-gal staining was also found in parts of embryonic endoderm  and mesoderm. The beta-gal staining pattern in the embryonic tissues was  corroborated by in situ hybridization analysis of endogenous Nf2 RNA expression.  Importantly, we observed strong NF2 promoter activity in the developing brain  and in sites containing migrating cells including the neural tube closure,  branchial arches, dorsal aorta, and paraaortic splanchnopleura. Furthermore, we  noted a transient change of NF2 promoter activity during neural crest cell  migration. While little beta-gal activity was detected in premigratory neural  crest cells at the dorsal ridge region of the neural fold, significant activity  was seen in the neural crest cells already migrating away from the dorsal neural  tube. In addition, we detected considerable NF2 promoter activity in various  NF2-affected tissues such as acoustic ganglion, trigeminal ganglion, spinal  ganglia, optic chiasma, the ependymal cell-containing tela choroidea, and the  pigmented epithelium of the retina. The NF2 promoter expression pattern during  embryogenesis suggests a specific regulation of the NF2 gene during neural crest  cell migration and further supports the role of merlin in cell adhesion,  motility, and proliferation during development.

Author information: (1)Division of Cardiology, Department of Pediatrics, The Children's Hospital of  Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA. ismat@email.chop.edu  Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1; also known as von Recklinghausen's disease) is a  common autosomal-dominant condition primarily affecting neural crest-derived  tissues. The disease gene, NF1, encodes neurofibromin, a protein of over 2,800  amino acids that contains a 216-amino acid domain with Ras-GTPase-activating  protein (Ras-GAP) activity. Potential therapies for NF1 currently in development  and being tested in clinical trials are designed to modify NF1 Ras-GAP activity  or target downstream effectors of Ras signaling. Mice lacking the murine homolog  (Nf1) have mid-gestation lethal cardiovascular defects due to a requirement for  neurofibromin in embryonic endothelium. We sought to determine whether the GAP  activity of neurofibromin is sufficient to rescue complete loss of function or  whether other as yet unidentified functions of neurofibromin might also exist.  Using cre-inducible ubiquitous and tissue-specific expression, we demonstrate  that the isolated GAP-related domain (GRD) rescued cardiovascular development in  Nf1(-/-) embryos, but overgrowth of neural crest-derived tissues persisted,  leading to perinatal lethality. These results suggest that neurofibromin may  possess activities outside of the GRD that modulate neural crest homeostasis and  that therapeutic approaches solely aimed at targeting Ras activity may not be  sufficient to treat tumors of neural crest origin in NF1.

Wells Center for Pediatric Research,  Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana 46202, USA.  fyang@iupui.edu  Individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) have a high incidence of  osteoporosis and osteopenia. However, understanding of the cellular and  molecular basis of these sequelae is incomplete. Osteoclasts are specialized  myeloid cells that are the principal bone-resorbing cells of the skeleton. We  found that Nf1(+/-) mice contain elevated numbers of multinucleated osteoclasts.  Both osteoclasts and osteoclast progenitors from Nf1(+/-) mice were  hyperresponsive to limiting concentrations of M-CSF and receptor activator of  NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) levels. M-CSF-stimulated p21(ras)-GTP and Akt  phosphorylation was elevated in Nf1(+/-) osteoclasts associated with gains of  function in survival, proliferation, migration, adhesion, and lytic activity.  These gains of function are associated with more severe bone loss following  ovariectomy as compared with that in syngeneic WT mice. Intercrossing Nf1(+/-)  mice and mice deficient in class 1(A) PI3K (p85alpha) restored elevated PI3K  activity and Nf1(+/-) osteoclast functions to WT levels. Furthermore, in  vitro-differentiated osteoclasts from NF1 patients also displayed elevated  Ras/PI3K activity and increased lytic activity analogous to those in murine  Nf1(+/-) osteoclasts. Collectively, our results identify a what we believe to be  a novel cellular and biochemical NF1-haploinsufficient phenotype in osteoclasts  that has potential implications for the pathogenesis of NF1 bone disease.

Lenarz M(1), Lim HH, Patrick JF, Anderson DJ, Lenarz T.  Author information: (1)Otorhinolaryngology Department, Medical University of Hannover, Hannover,  Lower Saxony 30625, Germany.  The auditory midbrain implant (AMI) is a new treatment for hearing restoration  in patients with neural deafness or surgically inaccessible cochleae who cannot  benefit from cochlear implants (CI). This includes neurofibromatosis type II  (NF2) patients who, due to development and/or removal of vestibular schwannomas,  usually experience complete damage of their auditory nerves. Although the  auditory brainstem implant (ABI) provides sound awareness and aids lip-reading  capabilities for these NF2 patients, it generally only achieves hearing  performance levels comparable with a single-channel CI. In collaboration with  Cochlear Ltd. (Lane Cove, Australia), we developed a human prototype AMI, which  is designed for electrical stimulation along the well-defined tonotopic gradient  of the inferior colliculus central nucleus (ICC). Considering that better speech  perception and hearing performance has been correlated with a greater number of  discriminable frequency channels of information available, the ability of the  AMI to effectively activate discrete frequency regions within the ICC may enable  better hearing performance than achieved by the ABI. Therefore, the goal of this  study was to investigate if our AMI array could achieve low-threshold,  frequency-specific activation within the ICC, and whether the levels for ICC  activation via AMI stimulation were within safe limits for human application. We  electrically stimulated different frequency regions within the ICC via the AMI  array and recorded the corresponding neural activity in the primary auditory  cortex (A1) using a multisite silicon probe in ketamine-anesthetized guinea  pigs. Based on our results, AMI stimulation achieves lower thresholds and more  localized, frequency-specific activation than CI stimulation. Furthermore, AMI  stimulation achieves cortical activation with current levels that are within  safe limits for central nervous system stimulation. This study confirms that our  AMI design is sufficient for ensuring safe and effective activation of the ICC,  and warrants further studies to translate the AMI into clinical application.

Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Francisco, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) syndrome is caused by germline mutations in the  NF1 tumor suppressor, which encodes neurofibromin, a GTPase activating protein  for Ras. Children with NF1 are predisposed to juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia  (JMML) and lethally irradiated mice given transplants with homozygous Nf1 mutant  (Nf1-/-) hematopoietic stem cells develop a fatal myeloproliferative disorder  (MPD) that models JMML. We investigated the requirement for signaling through  the GM-CSF receptor to initiate and sustain this MPD by generating Nf1 mutant  hematopoietic cells lacking the common beta chain (Beta c) of the GM-CSF  receptor. Mice reconstituted with Nf1-/-, beta c-/- stem cells did not develop  evidence of MPD despite the presence of increased number of immature  hematopoietic progenitors in the bone marrow. Interestingly, when the Mx1-Cre  transgene was used to inactivate a conditional Nf1 mutant allele in  hematopoietic cells, concomitant loss of beta c-/- reduced the severity of the  MPD, but did not abrogate it. Whereas inhibiting GM-CSF signaling may be of  therapeutic benefit in JMML, our data also demonstrate aberrant proliferation of  Nf1-/-myeloid progenitors that is independent of signaling through the GM-CSF  receptor.

Skuse GR(1), Kosciolek BA, Rowley PT.  Author information: (1)Division of Genetics, University of Rochester School of Medicine, NY.  von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1) is the most common hereditary  syndrome predisposing to neoplasia. NF1 is an autosomal dominant disease caused  by a single gene which maps to chromosome 17q11.2. The most common symptomatic  manifestation of NF1 is the benign neurofibroma. Our previous studies of tumors  in NF1, studies which detected a loss of heterozygosity for DNA markers from the  NF1 region of chromosome 17 in malignant tumors, did not detect a loss in  neurofibromas. We report here that a more extensive study, including the  analysis of neurofibromas from 19 unrelated NF1 patients by using seven probes,  failed to detect a single instance of loss of heterozygosity. This finding  suggests that neurofibromas are either polyclonal or monoclonal in origin but  arise by a mechanism different from that of NF1 malignancies. In order to  investigate the first possibility, we analyzed neurofibromas from female NF1  patients by using an X chromosome-specific probe, from the phosphoglycerokinase  (PGK) gene, which detects an RFLP. The detected alleles carry additional  recognition sites for the methylation-sensitive enzyme HpaII, so that the allele  derived from the active X chromosome is digested by HpaII while the one from the  hypermethylated, inactive X chromosome is not. We analyzed neurofibromas from 30  unrelated females with NF1. Eight patients were heterozygous for the PGK RFLP.  By this assay, neurofibromas from all eight appeared monoclonal in origin. These  results suggest that benign neurofibromas in NF1 arise by a mechanism that is  different from that of malignant tumors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  PMCID: PMC1683134 PMID: 1715669 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",False,"Tumor origin study, no tool development"

Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, University of South  Florida, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.  Mutations of the neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene have frequently  been detected not only in schwannomas and other central nervous system tumors of  NF2 patients but also in their sporadic counterparts and malignant tumors  unrelated to the NF2 syndrome such as malignant mesothelioma, indicating a  broader role for the NF2 gene in human tumorigenesis. However, the mechanisms by  which the NF2 product, merlin or schwannomin, is regulated and controls cell  proliferation remain elusive. Here, we identify a novel GTP-binding protein,  dubbed NGB (referring to NF2-associated GTP binding protein), which binds to  merlin. NGB is highly conserved between Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis  elegans, and human cells, and its GTP-binding region is very similar to those  found in R-ras and Rap2. However, ectopic expression of NGB inhibits cell  growth, cell aggregation, and tumorigenicity in tumorigenic schwanomma cells.  Down-regulation and infrequent mutation of NGB were detected in human glioma  cell lines and primary tumors. The interaction of NGB with merlin impairs the  turnover of merlin, yet merlin does not affect the GTPase nor GTP-binding  activity of NGB. Finally, the tumor suppressor functions of NGB require merlin  and are linked to its ability to suppress cyclin D1 expression. Collectively,  these findings indicate that NGB is a tumor suppressor that regulates and  requires merlin to suppress cell proliferation.

Lavery W(1), Hall V, Yager JC, Rottgers A, Wells MC, Stern M.  Author information: (1)Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Rice University, Houston, Texas  77251, USA.  Drosophila peripheral nerves, structured similarly to their mammalian  counterparts, comprise a layer of motor and sensory axons wrapped by an inner  peripheral glia (analogous to the mammalian Schwann cell) and an outer  perineurial glia (analogous to the mammalian perineurium). Growth and  proliferation within mammalian peripheral nerves are increased by Ras pathway  activation: loss-of-function mutations in Nf1, which encodes the Ras inhibitor  neurofibromin, cause the human genetic disorder neurofibromatosis, which is  characterized by formation of neurofibromas (tumors of peripheral nerves).  However, the signaling pathways that control nerve growth downstream of Ras  remain incompletely characterized. Here we show that expression specifically  within the Drosophila peripheral glia of the constitutively active Ras(V12)  increases perineurial glial thickness. Using chromosomal loss-of-function  mutations and transgenes encoding dominant-negative and constitutively active  proteins, we show that this nonautonomous effect of Ras(V12) is mediated by the  Ras effector phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and its downstream kinase Akt.  We also show that the nonautonomous, growth-promoting effects of activated PI3K  are suppressed by coexpression within the peripheral glia of FOXO+ (forkhead box  O) a transcription factor inhibited by Akt-dependent phosphorylation. We suggest  that Ras-PI3K-Akt activity in the peripheral glia promotes growth of the  perineurial glia by inhibiting FOXO. In mammalian peripheral nerves, the Schwann  cell releases several growth factors that affect the proliferative properties of  neighbors. Some of these factors are oversecreted in Nf1 mutants. Our results  raise the possibility that neurofibroma formation in individuals with  neurofibromatosis might result in part from a Ras-PI3K-Akt-dependent inhibition  of FOXO within Schwann cells.

Hawes JJ(1), Tuskan RG, Reilly KM.  Author information: (1)Mouse Cancer Genetics Program, National Cancer Institute-Frederick, West 7th  Street at Fort Detrick, P.O. Box B, Building 560, Rm 31-20, Frederick, MD 21702,  USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the most common cancer predisposition syndrome  affecting the nervous system, with elevated risk for both astrocytoma and  peripheral nerve sheath tumors. NF1 is caused by a germline mutation in the NF1  gene, with tumors showing loss of the wild type copy of NF1. In addition, NF1  heterozygosity in surrounding stroma is important for tumor formation,  suggesting an additional role of haploinsufficiency for NF1. Studies in mouse  models and NF1 families have implicated modifier genes unlinked to NF1 in the  severity of the disease and in susceptibility to astrocytoma and peripheral  nerve sheath tumors. To determine if differences in Nf1 expression may  contribute to the strain-specific effects on tumor predisposition, we examined  the levels of Nf1 gene expression in mouse strains with differences in tumor  susceptibility using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The data presented  in this paper demonstrate that strain background has as much effect on Nf1  expression levels as mutation of one Nf1 allele, indicating that studies of  haploinsufficiency must be carefully interpreted with respect to strain  background. Because expression levels do not correlate entirely with the  susceptibility or resistance to tumors observed in the strain, these data  suggest that either variation in Nf1 levels is not responsible for the  differences in astrocytoma and peripheral nerve sheath tumor susceptibility in  Nf1-/+;Trp53-/+cis mice, or that certain mouse strains have evolved compensatory  mechanisms for differences in Nf1 expression.

Bottillo I(1), De Luca A, Schirinzi A, Guida V, Torrente I, Calvieri S,  Gervasini C, Larizza L, Pizzuti A, Dallapiccola B.  Author information: (1)IRCCS-CSS, San Giovanni Rotondo and CSS-Mendel Institute, Rome, Italy.  BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 is one of the most common autosomal  dominant disorders, affecting about 1:3,500 individuals. NF1 exon 7 displays  weakly defined exon-intron boundaries, and is particularly prone to missplicing. METHODS: In this study we investigated the expression of exon 7 transcripts  using bioinformatic identification of splicing regulatory sequences, and  functional minigene analysis of four sequence changes [c.910C>T (R304X),  c.945G>A/c.946C>A (Q315Q/L316M), c.1005T>C (N335N)] identified in exon 7 of  three different NF1 patients. RESULTS: Our results detected the presence of three exonic splicing enhancers  (ESEs) and one putative exonic splicing silencer (ESS) element. The wild type  minigene assay resulted in three alternative isoforms, including a transcript  lacking NF1 exon 7 (NF1DeltaE7). Both the wild type and the mutated constructs  shared NF1DeltaE7 in addition to the complete messenger, but displayed a  different ratio between the two transcripts. In the presence of R304X and  Q315Q/L316M mutations, the relative proportion between the different isoforms is  shifted toward the expression of NF1DeltaE7, while in the presence of N335N  variant, the NF1DeltaE7 expression is abolished. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, it appears mandatory to investigate the role of each  nucleotide change within the NF1 coding sequence, since a significant proportion  of NF1 exon 7 mutations affects pre-mRNA splicing, by disrupting exonic splicing  motifs and modifying the delicate balance between aberrantly and correctly  spliced transcripts.

Lebo RV(1), Lynch ED, Bird TD, Golbus MS, Barker DF, O'Connell P, Chance PF.  Author information: (1)Department of Obstetrics, University of California, San Francisco 94143-0720.  This study demonstrates a clear and current role for multicolor in situ  hybridization in expediting positional cloning studies of unknown disease genes.  Nine polymorphic DNA cosmids have been mapped to eight ordered locations  spanning the Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1 (CMT1A) disease gene region in distal  band 17p11.2, by multicolor in situ hybridization. When used with linkage  analysis, these methods have generated a fine physical map and have firmly  assigned the CMT1A gene to distal band 17p11.2. Linkage analysis with four CMT1A  pedigrees mapped the CMT1A gene with respect to two flanking markers (8B10-5  cM[LOD 5.2]-CMT1A-3.5 cM[LOD 5.3]-10E4). Additional loci were physically mapped  and ordered by in situ hybridization and analysis of phase-known recombinants in  CMT1A pedigrees. The order determined by multicolor in situ hybridization was  17cen-LEW301-8B10-5H5/6A9-VAW409- 5G7-6G1-4A11-VAW412-10E4-pter. Two ordered  probes, 4A11 and 6G1, reside on the same 440-kb partial SfiI restriction  fragment. These data demonstrate the ability of in situ hybridization to resolve  loci within 0.5 Mb on early-metaphase chromosomes. Multicolor in situ  hybridization also excluded the possibility of pericentric inversions in two  unrelated patients with CMT1 and neurofibromatosis type 1. When used with  pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, multicolor in situ hybridization can establish  physical location, order, and distance in closely spaced chromosome loci.

Author information: (1)MGH Center for Cancer Research, Harvard Medical School Department of  Pathology, Charlestown, MA 02129, USA.  The neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor, Merlin, is a  membrane/cytoskeleton-associated protein that mediates contact-dependent  inhibition of proliferation. Here we show that upon cell-cell contact Merlin  coordinates the processes of adherens junction stabilization and negative  regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling by restraining  the EGFR into a membrane compartment from which it can neither signal nor be  internalized. In confluent Nf2(-/-) cells, EGFR activation persists, driving  continued proliferation that is halted by specific EGFR inhibitors. These  studies define a new mechanism of tumor suppression, provide mechanistic insight  into the poorly understood phenomenon of contact-dependent inhibition of  proliferation, and suggest a therapeutic strategy for NF2-mutant tumors.

Aoki M(1), Nabeshima K, Koga K, Hamasaki M, Suzumiya J, Tamura K, Iwasaki H.  Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, Fukuoka University School of Medicine, Fukuoka,  Japan.  Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is rare, highly aggressive,  resistant to radiochemotherapy, and associated with poor prognosis. Basic  research to develop new treatment regimes is critically needed. This study was  designed to identify motogenic factor(s) involved in MPNST cell invasion and  inhibitor(s) of such invasive activity. We profiled the invasion-inducing  activities of eight motogenic growth factors on two human MPNST cell lines,  FU-SFT8611 and 9817, using in vitro Matrigel invasion assays. Platelet-derived  growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) was identified as the most effective MPNST cell  invasion-inducing factor. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and hepatocyte growth  factor (HGF) also stimulated invasion in one MPNST cell line. Expressions of  PDGF-BB and EGF receptors (PDGFR-beta and EGFR) mRNAs were detected more  frequently and their proteins were expressed at higher levels in MPNST tissues  than benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors (schwannomas and neurofibromas). In  both MPNST cell lines, PDGF-BB induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFR-beta  but not of PDGFR-alpha, and specific PDGFR-beta inhibition by small interfering  RNA to the receptor inhibited PDGF-BB-stimulated MPNST cell invasion, suggesting  the predominant role of PDGFR-beta. Inhibition of PDGFR-beta phosphorylation by  pretreatment with herbimycin A and imatinib mesylate effectively suppressed  basement membrane invasion and cell growth in vitro. No mutations were present  in exons 12 and 18 of PDGFR-beta in both MPNST cell lines and 10 human MPNST  tissues examined. Our results indicated that PDGF-BB enhanced the invasive  activity of MPNST cells through PDGFR phosphorylation and that imatinib  inhibited such activity. The results provide the ground for further assessment  of the therapeutic potential of imatinib in suppressing the invasion and growth  of MPNST.

Ho IS(1), Hannan F, Guo HF, Hakker I, Zhong Y.  Author information: (1)Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York 11724, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a dominant genetic disorder that causes tumors  of the peripheral nervous system. In addition, >40% of afflicted children have  learning difficulties. The NF1 protein contains a highly conserved  GTPase-activating protein domain that inhibits Ras activity, and the C-terminal  region regulates cAMP levels via G-protein-dependent activation of adenylyl  cyclase. Behavioral analysis indicates that learning is disrupted in both  Drosophila and mouse NF1 models. Our previous work has shown that defective cAMP  signaling leads to the learning phenotype in Drosophila Nf1 mutants. In the  present report, our experiments showed that in addition to learning, long-term  memory was also abolished in Nf1 mutants. However, altered NF1-regulated Ras  activity is responsible for this defect rather than altered cAMP levels.  Furthermore, by expressing clinically relevant human NF1 mutations and deletions  in Drosophila Nf1-null mutants, we demonstrated that the GAP-related domain of  NF1 was necessary and sufficient for long-term memory, whereas the C-terminal  domain of NF1 was essential for immediate memory. Thus, we show that two  separate functional domains of the same protein can participate independently in  the formation of two distinct memory components.

Friedrich RE(1), Keiner D, Hagel C.  Author information: (1)Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic, Eppendorf University Hospital, University of  Hamburg, Germany. rfriedri@uke.uni-hamburg.de  BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal-dominant inherited  disease, characterised by the development of nerve sheath tumors. NF1 is the  most frequently inherited disease associated with a predisposition for cancer  (in particular malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors: MPNST). NF1 is a  progressive disease with phase-like growth spurts of dermal or plexiform  neurofibroma (PNF). These tumors can cause severe disfigurement of patients.  Growth control of these tumors is poorly understood. The aim of this study was  to identify the expression of insulin-like growth factor 1-receptor (IGF-1R) in  peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Factor and receptor are involved in the growth  control of numerous physiological and pathological processes, including Schwann  cell development. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The investigation included tumors of NF1-patients only  (neurofibroma, MPNST). Sections of the specimens were immunohistochemically  typed for several antigens (target antigens: IGF-1R, S-100, EMA, CD34, MIB-1),  using both single and double-staining methods. Double-staining allowed the  sub-typing of the IGF-1R-expressing cells in the mixed nerve sheath tumors. The  expression was also investigated in Schwann cell cultures and co-cultures with  fibroblasts. RESULTS: Staining of S-100 and IGF-1R, PNF were more intensely marked than MPNST  (r = -0.439, p < 0.002, N = 49). The proliferation index was tumor-type  dependent: MPNST > neurofibroma. The IGF-1R-expression correlated positively  with the MIB-1 index in neurofibroma (r = 0.372, p = 0.021, N = 38). The  receptor expression was higher in PNF than in dermal neurofibroma (r = 0.335, p  = 0.040, N = 38). IGF-1R was detected in Schwann cells (S-100 positive) and in  perineurial cells (EMA-positive) of all nerve sheath tumors. However, the  receptor was also identified in CD34-marked endothelia of neurofibromas but not  in endothelia of MPNST. In Schwann cell cultures, a strong receptor-expression  became evident. This expression was independent of co-cultivation of tumor cells  with fibroblasts. The statistical calculations excluded the impact of gender on  the receptor expression. CONCLUSION: This investigation provides evidence for the expression of IGF-1R in  nerve sheath tumors in NF1. The expression pattern varied between the tumor  types, the cell types, and between tumors of the same type. IGF and IGF-1R are a  prerequisite to maintain Schwann cell stability in the postnatal period and to  prevent Schwann cell apoptosis. The first evidence for IGF-1R expression in  mutated Schwann cells may indicate a tumor-type associated receptor expression  in NF1.

Factors contributing to tumor  progression are largely unknown. We therefore examined MPNST from 22  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients, 14 non-NF1 patients, and 14  neurofibroma patients for matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13) expression.  Because wild-type and mutant p53 were shown to differentially regulate MMP-13  expression, TP53 status and protein levels were also determined. MMP-13  expression was detected in 58% of MPNST and was significantly associated with  recurrent MPNST (P = .019). p53 was observed in 78% of MPNST and was found to be  strongly associated with MMP-13 expression (P = .005). In contrast, 14  neurofibromas lacked MMP-13 and p53 expressions. TP53 mutations were found in  only 11% of MPNST and were associated with high tumor grades (P = .029). No  significant association between mutant TP53 and MMP-13 was observed, indicating  that other factors drive MMP-13 expression in MPNST. The presence of metastasis  was linked to p53Pro(72) polymorphism (P = .041) and shorter survival. In  summary, our data suggest that MMP-13 expression in nerve sheath tumors is  coupled with malignant progression. Therefore, MMP-13 may serve as a marker for  progression and as a therapeutic target.

Author information: (1)Department of Human Genetics, University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann  Arbor 48109.  Von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis, or type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF1), is a  common autosomal dominant disorder characterized by abnormalities in multiple  tissues derived from the embryonic neural crest. Portions of the gene have been  recently identified by positional cloning, and sequence analysis has shown  homology to the GTPase activating protein (GAP) family. In this report we  present the results of an extensive cDNA walk resulting in the cloning of the  complete coding region of the NF1 transcript. Analysis of the sequences reveals  an open reading frame of 2818 amino acids, although alternatively spliced  products may code for different protein isoforms. The gene extends for  approximately 300 kb on chromosome 17, with its promoter in a CpG-rich island.

Author information: (1)Department of Cell and Cancer Biology, Vontz Center for Molecular Studies,  University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH 45267-0521, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a genetic disorder characterized by the  formation of bilateral schwannomas of the eighth cranial nerve. Although the  protein product of the NF2 gene (merlin) is a classical tumor suppressor, the  mechanism by which merlin suppresses cell proliferation is not fully understood.  The availability of isolated tumor cells would facilitate a better understanding  of the molecular function of merlin, but primary schwannoma cells obtained from  patients grow slowly and do not yield adequate numbers for biochemical analysis.  In this study, we have examined the NF2 mutation in HEI-193 cells, an  immortalized cell line derived from the schwannoma of an NF2 patient. Previous  work showed that the NF2 mutation in HEI-193 cells causes a splicing defect in  the NF2 transcript. We have confirmed this result and further identified the  resultant protein product as an isoform of merlin previously designated as  isoform 3. The level of isoform 3 proteins in HEI-193 cells is comparable to the  levels of merlin isoforms 1 and 2 in normal human Schwann cells and several  other immortalized cell lines. In contrast to many mutant forms of merlin,  isoform 3 is as resistant to proteasomal degradation as isoforms 1 and 2 and can  interact with each of these isoforms in vivo. Cell proliferation assays showed  that, in NF2(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts, exogenously expressed merlin  isoform 3 does exhibit growth suppressive activity although it is significantly  lower than that of identically expressed merlin isoform 1. These results  indicate that, although HEI-193 cells have undetectable levels of merlin  isoforms 1 and 2, they are, in fact, not a merlin-null model because they  express the moderately active growth suppressive merlin isoform 3.

Kalamarides M(1), Stemmer-Rachamimov AO, Takahashi M, Han ZY, Chareyre F,  Niwa-Kawakita M, Black PM, Carroll RS, Giovannini M.  Author information: (1)Inserm U674, Paris, France.  Meningiomas account for approximately 30% of all primary central nervous system  tumors and are found in half of neurofibromatosis type 2 patients often causing  significant morbidity. Although most meningiomas are benign, 10% are classified  as atypical or anaplastic, displaying aggressive clinical behavior. Biallelic  inactivation of the neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor is associated  with meningioma formation in all NF2 patients and 60% of sporadic meningiomas.  Deletion of the p16(INK4a)/p14(ARF) locus is found in both benign and malignant  meningiomas, while mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene is uncommon.  Previously, we inactivated Nf2 in homozygous conditional knockout mice by  adenoviral Cre delivery and showed that Nf2 loss in arachnoid cells is  rate-limiting for meningioma formation. Here, we report that additional  nullizygosity for p16(Ink4a) increases the frequency of meningioma and  meningothelial proliferation in these mice without modifying the tumor grade. In  addition, by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to screen a large cohort of  mutant mice, we were able to detect meningothelial proliferation and meningioma  development opening the way to future studies in which therapeutic interventions  can be tested as preclinical assessment of their potential clinical application.

Author information: (1)Molecular Neurogenetics Unit, Center for Human Genetic Research,  Massachusetts General Hospital, Richard B. Simches Research Building, 185  Cambridge Street, Boston, MA 02114, USA.  Meningiomas, common tumors arising from arachnoidal cells of the meninges, may  occur sporadically, or in association with the inherited disorder,  neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2). Most sporadic meningiomas result from NF2  inactivation, resulting in loss of tumor suppressor merlin, implicated in  regulating membrane-cytoskeletal organization. To investigate merlin function in  an authentic target cell type for NF2 tumor formation, we established primary  cultures from genetically-matched meningioma and normal arachnoidal tissues. Our  studies revealed novel and distinct cell biological and biochemical properties  unique to merlin-deficient meningioma cells compared to merlin-expressing  arachnoidal and meningioma cells, and other NF2-deficient cell types.  Merlin-deficient meningioma cells displayed cytoskeletal and cell contact  defects, altered cell morphology and growth properties, most notably cell  senescence, implicating the activation of senescence pathways in limiting benign  meningioma growth. Merlin suppression by RNAi in arachnoidal cells replicated  merlin-deficient meningioma features, thus establishing these cell systems as  disease-relevant models for studying NF2 tumorigenesis.

Author information: (1)IRCCS-CSS, San Giovanni Rotondo and CSS-Mendel Institute, Rome, Italy.  To estimate the contribution of single and multi-exon NF1 gene copy-number  changes to the NF1 mutation spectrum, we analysed a series of 201 Italian  patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Of these, 138 had previously been  found, using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography or protein  truncation test, to be heterozygous for intragenic NF1 point  mutations/deletions/insertions, and were excluded from this analysis. The  remaining 63 patients were analysed using multiplex ligation-dependent probe  amplification (MLPA), which allows detection of deletions or duplications  encompassing >or=1 NF1 exons, as well as entire gene deletions. MLPA results  were validated using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) or fluorescent in situ  hybridisation. MLPA screening followed by real-time qPCR detected a total of 23  deletions. Of these deletions, six were single exon, eight were multi-exon, and  nine were of the entire NF1 gene. In our series, deletions encompassing >or=1  NF1 exons accounted for approximately 7% (14/201) of the NF1 gene mutation  spectrum, suggesting that screening for these should now be systematically  included in genetic testing of patients with NF1.

Tuskan RG(1), Tsang S, Sun Z, Baer J, Rozenblum E, Wu X, Munroe DJ, Reilly KM.  Author information: (1)Mouse Cancer Genetics Program, National Cancer Institute at Frederick,  Frederick, Maryland 21702, USA.  Imprinted genes are monoallelically expressed from either the maternal or  paternal genome. Because cancer develops through genetic and epigenetic  alterations, imprinted genes affect tumorigenesis depending on which parental  allele undergoes alteration. We have shown previously in a mouse model of  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) that inheriting mutant alleles of Nf1 and Trp53  on chromosome 11 from the mother or father dramatically changes the tumor  spectrum of mutant progeny, likely due to alteration in an imprinted gene(s)  linked to Nf1 and Trp53. In order to identify imprinted genes on chromosome 11  that are responsible for differences in susceptibility, we tested candidate  imprinted genes predicted by a bioinformatics approach and an experimental  approach. We have tested 30 candidate genes (Havcr2, Camk2b, Ccdc85a, Cntnap1,  Ikzf1, 5730522E02Rik, Gria1, Zfp39, Sgcd, Jup, Nxph3, Spnb2, Asb3, Rasd1,  Map2k3, Map2k4, Trp53, Serpinf1, Crk, Rasl10b, Itga3, Hoxb5, Cbx1, Pparbp,  Igfbp4, Smarce1, Stat3, Atp6v0a1, Nbr1 and Meox1), two known imprinted genes  (Grb10 and Impact) and Nf1, which has not been previously identified as an  imprinted gene. Although we confirmed the imprinting of Grb10 and Impact, we  found no other genes imprinted in the brain. We did, however, find strain-biased  expression of Camk2b, 5730522E02Rik, Havcr2, Map2k3, Serpinf1, Rasl10b, Itga3,  Asb3, Trp53, Nf1, Smarce1, Stat3, Cbx1, Pparbp and Cntnap1. These results  suggest that the prediction of imprinted genes is complicated and must be  individually validated.

PMID:18218617,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor, neurofibromin, regulates the neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells via its associating protein, CRMP-2.","Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor, neurofibromin, regulates the  neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells via its associating protein, CRMP-2.  Patrakitkomjorn S(1), Kobayashi D, Morikawa T, Wilson MM, Tsubota N, Irie A,  Ozawa T, Aoki M, Arimura N, Kaibuchi K, Saya H, Araki N.  Author information: (1)Department of Tumor Genetics and Biology, Graduate School of Medical  Sciences, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Kumamoto, Japan.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor gene product, neurofibromin,  functions in part as a Ras-GAP, a negative regulator of Ras. Neurofibromin is  implicated in the neuronal abnormality of NF1 patients; however, the precise  cellular function of neurofibromin has yet to be clarified. Using proteomic  strategies, we identified a set of neurofibromin-associating cellular proteins,  including axon regulator CRMP-2 (Collapsin response mediator protein-2). CRMP-2  directly bound to the C-terminal domain of neurofibromin, and this association  was regulated by the manner of CRMP-2 phosphorylation. In nerve growth  factor-stimulated PC12 cells, neurofibromin and CRMP-2 co-localized particularly  on the distal tips and branches of extended neurites. Suppression of  neurofibromin using NF1 small interfering RNA significantly inhibited this  neurite outgrowth and up-regulated a series of CRMP-2 phosphorylations by  kinases identified as CDK5, GSK-3b, and Rho kinase. Overexpression of the  NF1-RAS-GAP-related domain rescued these NF1 small interfering RNA-induced  events. Our results suggest that neurofibromin regulates neuronal  differentiation by performing one or more complementary roles. First,  neurofibromin directly regulates CRMP-2 phosphorylation accessibility through  the complex formation. Also, neurofibromin appears to indirectly regulate CRMP-2  activity by suppressing CRMP-2-phosphorylating kinase cascades via its Ras-GAP  function. Our study demonstrates that the functional association of  neurofibromin and CRMP-2 is essential for neuronal cell differentiation and that  lack of expression or abnormal regulation of neurofibromin can result in  impaired function of neuronal cells, which is likely a factor in NF1-related  pathogenesis.

Author information: (1)Division of Molecular Medicine and Genetics, Department of Internal Medicine,  University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.  Recent evidence suggests that alterations in the self-renewal program of  stem/progenitor cells can cause tumorigenesis. By utilizing genetically  engineered mouse models of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), we demonstrated that  plexiform neurofibroma, the only benign peripheral nerve sheath tumor with  potential for malignant transformation, results from Nf1 deficiency in fetal  stem/progenitor cells of peripheral nerves. Surprisingly, this did not cause  hyperproliferation or tumorigenesis in early postnatal period. Instead,  peripheral nerve development appeared largely normal in the absence of Nf1  except for abnormal Remak bundles, the nonmyelinated axon-Schwann cell unit,  identified in postnatal mutant nerves. Subsequent degeneration of abnormal Remak  bundles was accompanied by initial expansion of nonmyelinating Schwann cells. We  suggest abnormally differentiated Remak bundles as a cell of origin for  plexiform neurofibroma.

Author information: (1)Center for Stem Cell Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Life Sciences  Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2216, USA.  Neurofibromatosis is caused by the loss of neurofibromin (Nf1), leading to  peripheral nervous system (PNS) tumors, including neurofibromas and malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). A long-standing question has been  whether these tumors arise from neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) or  differentiated glia. Germline or conditional Nf1 deficiency caused a transient  increase in NCSC frequency and self-renewal in most regions of the fetal PNS.  However, Nf1-deficient NCSCs did not persist postnatally in regions of the PNS  that developed tumors and could not form tumors upon transplantation into adult  nerves. Adult P0a-Cre+Nf1(fl/-) mice developed neurofibromas, and  Nf1(+/-)Ink4a/Arf(-/-) and Nf1/p53(+/-) mice developed MPNSTs, but NCSCs did not  persist postnatally in affected locations in these mice. Tumors appeared to  arise from differentiated glia, not NCSCs.  DOI: 10.1016/j.ccr.2008.01.003 PMCID: PMC2566828 PMID: 18242513 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",True,Parse error - defaulted to include

Author information: (1)Department of Developmental Biology and Kent Waldrep Center for Basic  Neuroscience Research on Nerve Growth and Regeneration, University of Texas  Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390-9133, USA.  The rodent barrel cortex is a useful system to study the role of genes and  neuronal activity in the patterning of the nervous system. Several genes  encoding either intracellular signaling molecules or neurotransmitter receptors  are required for barrel formation. Neurofibromin is a tumor suppressor protein  that has Ras GTPase activity, thus attenuating the MAPK (mitogen-activated  protein kinase) and and PI-3 kinase (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) pathways,  and is mutated in humans with the condition neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).  Neurofibromin is widely expressed in the developing and adult nervous system,  and a common feature of NF1 is deficits in intellectual development. In  addition, NF1 is an uncommonly high disorder among individuals with autism.  Thus, NF1 may have important roles in normal CNS development and function. To  explore roles for neurofibromin in the development of the CNS, we took advantage  of a mouse conditional allele. We show that mice that lack neurofibromin in the  majority of cortical neurons and astrocytes fail to form cortical barrels in the  somatosensory cortex, whereas segregation of thalamic axons within the  somatosensory cortex appears unaffected.

Malignant mesothelioma is a devastating disease that has been associated with  loss of Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) and genetic lesions affecting RB and P53  pathways. We introduced similar lesions in the mesothelial lining of the  thoracic cavity of mice. Mesothelioma developed at high incidence in  Nf2;Ink4a/Arf and Nf2;p53 conditional knockout mice with median survival times  of approximately 30 and 20 weeks, respectively. Murine mesothelioma closely  mimicked human malignant mesothelioma. Conditional Nf2;Ink4a/Arf mice showed  increased pleural invasion compared to conditional Nf2;p53 mice. Interestingly,  upon Ink4a loss in the latter mice median survival was significantly reduced and  all tumors were highly invasive, suggesting that Ink4a loss substantially  contributes to the poor clinical outcome of malignant mesothelioma.

Author information: (1)Department of Pharmacology, Wayne State University, 540 East Canfield Ave.,  Detroit, MI 48201, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder that is driven by the loss  of neurofibromin (Nf) protein function. Nf contains a Ras-GTPase-activating  protein domain, which directly regulates Ras signaling. Numerous clinical  manifestations are associated with the loss of Nf and increased Ras activity.  Ras proteins must be prenylated to traffic and functionally localize with target  membranes. Hence, Ras is a potential therapeutic target for treating NF1. We  have tested the efficacy of two novel farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs), 1  and 2, alone or in combination with lovastatin, on two NF1 malignant peripheral  nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) cell lines, NF90-8 and ST88-14. Single treatments of  1, 2, or lovastatin had no effect on Ras prenylation or MPNST cell  proliferation. However, low micromolar combinations of 1 or 2 with lovastatin  (FTI/lovastatin) reduced Ras prenylation in both MPNST cell lines. Furthermore,  this FTI/lovastatin combination treatment reduced cell proliferation and induced  an apoptotic response as shown by morphological analysis, procaspase-3/-7  activation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and accumulation of cells  with sub-G(1) DNA content. Little to no detectable toxicity was observed in  normal rat Schwann cells following FTI/lovastatin combination treatment. These  data support the hypothesis that combination FTI plus lovastatin therapy may be  a potential treatment for NF1 MPNSTs.

Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis,  MO 63110, USA.  Individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) develop abnormalities of both  neuronal and glial cell lineages, suggesting that the NF1 protein neurofibromin  is an essential regulator of neuroglial progenitor function. In this regard,  Nf1-deficient embryonic telencephalic neurospheres exhibit increased  self-renewal and prolonged survival as explants in vivo. Using a newly developed  brain lipid binding protein (BLBP)-Cre mouse strain to study the role of  neurofibromin in neural progenitor cell function in the intact animal, we now  show that neuroglial progenitor Nf1 inactivation results in increased glial  lineage proliferation and abnormal neuronal differentiation in vivo. Whereas the  glial cell lineage abnormalities are recapitulated by activated Ras or Akt  expression in vivo, the neuronal abnormalities were Ras- and Akt independent and  reflected impaired cAMP generation in Nf1-deficient cells in vivo and in vitro.  Together, these findings demonstrate that neurofibromin is required for normal  glial and neuronal development involving separable Ras-dependent and  cAMP-dependent mechanisms.

Author information: (1)Laboratory of New Drug Development, Department of Medicine, Memorial  Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021, USA.  Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are soft-tissue tumors with a  very poor prognosis and largely resistant to chemotherapy. MPNSTs are  characterized by activation of the Ras pathway by loss of tumor suppressor  neurofibromatosis type 1. In view of this, MPNST may be susceptible to  inhibition of the activated Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by  the B-Raf inhibitor sorafenib. MPNST (MPNST and ST8814) and dedifferentiated  liposarcoma (LS141 and DDLS) human tumor cell lines were characterized for Ras  activation and B-Raf expression. Tumor cells were treated with sorafenib and  examined for growth inhibition, inhibition of phospho-MEK, phospho-ERK, cell  cycle arrest, and changes in cyclin D1 and pRb expression. MPNSTs were sensitive  to sorafenib at nanomolar concentrations. This appeared to be due to inhibition  of phospho-MEK, phospho-ERK, suppression of cyclin D1, and hypophosphorylation  of pRb at the CDK4-specific sites, resulting in a G(1) cell cycle arrest. These  effects were not seen in the liposarcoma cells, which either did not express  B-Raf or showed decreased Ras activation. Small interfering RNA-mediated  depletion of B-Raf in MPNSTs also induced a G(1) cell cycle arrest in these  cells, with a marked inhibition of cyclin D1 expression and Rb phosphorylation,  whereas depletion of C-Raf did not affect either. With growth inhibition at the  low nanomolar range, sorafenib, by inhibiting the mitogen-activated protein  kinase pathway, may prove to be a novel therapy for patients with MPNST.

Lasater EA(1), Bessler WK, Mead LE, Horn WE, Clapp DW, Conway SJ, Ingram DA, Li  F.  Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine,  Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the  NF1 tumor suppressor gene. Neurofibromin is encoded by NF1 and functions as a  negative regulator of Ras activity. Somatic mutations in the residual normal NF1  allele within cancers of NF1 patients is consistent with NF1 functioning as a  tumor-suppressor. However, the prevalent non-malignant manifestations of NF1,  including learning and bone disorders emphasize the importance of dissecting the  cellular and biochemical effects of NF1 haploinsufficiency in multiple cell  lineages. One of the least studied complications of NF1 involves cardiovascular  disorders, including arterial occlusions that result in cerebral and visceral  infarcts. NF1 vasculopathy is characterized by vascular smooth muscle cell  (VSMC) accumulation in the intima area of vessels resulting in lumen occlusion.  We recently showed that Nf1 haploinsufficiency increases VSMC proliferation and  migration via hyperactivation of the Ras-Erk pathway, which is a signaling axis  directly linked to neointima formation in diverse animal models of vasculopathy.  Given this observation, we tested whether heterozygosity of Nf1 would lead to  vaso-occlusive disease in genetically engineered mice in vivo. Strikingly,  Nf1+/- mice have increased neointima formation, excessive vessel wall cell  proliferation and Erk activation after vascular injury in vivo. Further, this  effect is directly dependent on a Gleevec sensitive molecular pathway.  Therefore, these studies establish an Nf1 model of vasculopathy, which mirrors  features of human NF1 vaso-occlusive disease, identifies a potential therapeutic  target and provides a platform to further dissect the effect of Nf1  haploinsufficiency in cardiovascular disease.

Author information: (1)Department of Clinical Neurobiology, Institute of Biomedical and Clinical  Science, Peninsula College for Medicine and Dentistry, Plymouth, UK.  Schwannomas are Schwann cell tumors of the nervous system that occur  spontaneously and in patients with neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) and lack the tumor  suppressor merlin. Merlin is known to bind paxillin, beta1 integrin and focal  adhesion kinase, members of focal contacts, multi-protein complexes that mediate  cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Moreover, merlin-deficient  Schwannomas show pathological adhesion to the extracellular matrix making the  characterization of focal contacts indispensable. Using our Schwannoma in vitro  model of human primary Schwann and Schwannoma cells, we here show that  Schwannoma cells display an increased number of mature and stable focal  contacts. In addition to an involvement of RhoA signaling via the Rho kinase  ROCK, Rac1 plays a significant role in the pathological adhesion of Schwannoma  cells. The Rac1 guanine exchange factor- beta-Pix, localizes to focal contacts  in human primary Schwannoma cells, and we show that part of the Rac1 activation,  an effect of merlin-deficiency, occurs at the level of focal contacts in human  primary Schwannoma cells. Our results help explaining the pathological adhesion  of Schwannoma cells, further strengthen the importance of RhoGTPase signaling in  Schwannoma development, and suggest that merlin's role in tumor suppression is  linked to focal contacts.

Kwon CH(1), Zhao D, Chen J, Alcantara S, Li Y, Burns DK, Mason RP, Lee EY, Wu H,  Parada LF.  Author information: (1)Department of Developmental Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical  Center, Dallas, TX 75390-9133, USA.  We previously reported that central nervous system (CNS) inactivation of Nf1 and  p53 tumor suppressor genes in mice results in the development of low-grade to  high-grade progressive astrocytomas. When the tumors achieve high grade, they  are frequently accompanied by Akt activation, reminiscent of the frequent  association of PTEN mutations in human high-grade glioma. In the present study,  we introduced CNS heterozygosity of Pten into the Nf1/p53 astrocytoma model.  Resulting mice had accelerated morbidity, shortened survival, and full  penetrance of high-grade astrocytomas. Haploinsufficiency of Pten accelerated  formation of grade 3 astrocytomas, whereas loss of Pten heterozygosity and Akt  activation coincided with progression into grade 4 tumors. These data suggest  that successive loss of each Pten allele may contribute to de novo formation of  high-grade astrocytoma and progression into glioblastoma, respectively, thus  providing insight into the etiology of primary glioblastoma. The presence of  ectopically migrating neural stem/progenitor lineage cells in presymptomatic  Pten-deficient mutant brains supports the notion that these tumors may arise  from stem/progenitor cells.

Author information: (1)Division of Experimental Hematology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati,  OH, USA.  Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are chemoresistant sarcomas  with poor 5-year survival that arise in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1  (NF1) or sporadically. We tested three drugs for single and combinatorial  effects on collected MPNST cell lines and in MPNST xenografts. The mammalian  target of rapamycin complex 1 inhibitor RAD001 (Everolimus) decreased growth 19%  to 60% after 4 days of treatment in NF1 and sporadic-derived MPNST cell lines.  Treatment of subcutaneous sporadic MPNST cell xenografts with RAD001  significantly, but transiently, delayed tumor growth, and decreased vessel  permeability within xenografts. RAD001 combined with the epidermal growth factor  receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib caused additional inhibitory  effects on growth and apoptosis in vitro, and a small but significant additional  inhibitory effect on MPNST growth in vivo that were larger than the effects of  RAD001 with doxorubicin. RAD001 plus erlotinib, in vitro and in vivo, reduced  phosphorylation of AKT and total AKT levels, possibly accounting for their  additive effect. The results support the consideration of RAD001 therapy in NF1  patient and sporadic MPNST. The preclinical tests described allow rapid  screening strata for drugs that block MPNST growth, prior to tests in more  complex models, and should be useful to identify drugs that synergize with  RAD001.

Skoko N(1), Baralle M, Buratti E, Baralle FE.  Author information: (1)International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB),  Padriciano 99, Trieste, Italy.  We have previously identified an ESE in NF1 exon 37 whose disruption by the  pathological mutation c.6792C>G caused aberrant splicing. We now investigate the  RNA-protein complexes affected by the c.6792C>G mutation observing that this  concurrently decreases the affinity for the positive splicing factor YB-1 and  increases the affinity for the negative splicing factors, hnRNPA1, hnRNPA2 and a  new player in these type of complexes, DAZAP1. Our findings highlight the  complexity of the interplay between positive and negative factors in the exon  inclusion/skipping outcome. Furthermore, our observations stress the role of a  wide genomic context in NF1 exon 37 definition.

Hegedus B(1), Yeh TH, Lee DY, Emnett RJ, Li J, Gutmann DH.  Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis,  MO 63110, USA.  To study the role of the neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) gene in mammalian brain  development, we recently generated mice in which Nf1 gene inactivation occurs in  neuroglial progenitor cells using the brain lipid binding protein (BLBP)  promoter. We found that Nf1(BLBP)CKO mice exhibit significantly reduced body  weights and anterior pituitary gland sizes. We further demonstrate that the  small anterior pituitary size reflects loss of neurofibromin expression in the  hypothalamus, leading to reduced growth hormone releasing hormone, pituitary  growth hormone (GH) and liver insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) production.  Since neurofibromin both negatively regulates Ras activity and positively  modulates cAMP levels, we examined the signaling pathway responsible for these  abnormalities. While BLBP-mediated expression of an activated Ras molecule did  not recapitulate the body weight and hypothalamic/pituitary defects, treatment  of Nf1(BLBP)CKO mice with rolipram to increase cAMP levels resulted in a partial  restoration of the body weight phenotype. Furthermore, conditional expression of  the Ras regulatory GAP domain of neurofibromin also did not rescue the body  weight or Igf1 mRNA defects in Nf1(BLBP)CKO mice. Collectively, these data  demonstrate a critical role for neurofibromin in hypothalamic-pituitary axis  function and provide further insights into the short stature and GH deficits  seen in children with NF1.

Comment in     JAMA. 2008 Nov 26;300(20):2369; author reply 2369-70. doi:  10.1001/jama.2008.687.  CONTEXT: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is among the most common genetic  disorders that cause learning disabilities. Recently, it was shown that  statin-mediated inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase  restores the cognitive deficits in an NF1 mouse model. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of simvastatin on neuropsychological,  neurophysiological, and neuroradiological outcome measures in children with NF1. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-two of 114 eligible children (54%) with  NF1 participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial  conducted between January 20, 2006, and February 8, 2007, at an NF1 referral  center at a Dutch university hospital. INTERVENTION: Simvastatin or placebo treatment once daily for 12 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were scores on a Rey complex figure test  (delayed recall), cancellation test (speed), prism adaptation, and the mean  brain apparent diffusion coefficient based on magnetic resonance imaging.  Secondary outcome measures were scores on the cancellation test (standard  deviation), Stroop color word test, block design, object assembly, Rey complex  figure test (copy), Beery developmental test of visual-motor integration, and  judgment of line orientation. Scores were corrected for baseline performance,  age, and sex. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed between the simvastatin and  placebo groups on any primary outcome measure: Rey complex figure test (beta =  0.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.36 to 0.56); cancellation test (beta =  -0.19; 95% CI, -0.67 to 0.29); prism adaptation (odds ratio = 2.0; 95% CI, 0.55  to 7.37); and mean brain apparent diffusion coefficient (beta = 0.06; 95% CI,  -0.07 to 0.20). In the secondary outcome measures, we found a significant  improvement in the simvastatin group in object assembly scores (beta = 0.54; 95%  CI, 0.08 to 1.01), which was specifically observed in children with poor  baseline performance (beta = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.29 to 1.30). Other secondary  outcome measures revealed no significant effect of simvastatin treatment. CONCLUSION: In this 12-week trial, simvastatin did not improve cognitive  function in children with NF1.

PMID:18632626,Merlin is a potent inhibitor of glioma growth.,"Merlin is a potent inhibitor of glioma growth.  Lau YK(1), Murray LB, Houshmandi SS, Xu Y, Gutmann DH, Yu Q.  Author information: (1)Department of Oncological Sciences, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York,  NY 10029, USA.  Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is an inherited cancer syndrome in which affected  individuals develop nervous system tumors, including schwannomas, meningiomas,  and ependymomas. The NF2 protein merlin (or schwannomin) is a member of the Band  4.1 superfamily of proteins, which serve as linkers between transmembrane  proteins and the actin cytoskeleton. In addition to mutational inactivation of  the NF2 gene in NF2-associated tumors, mutations and loss of merlin expression  have also been reported in other types of cancers. In the present study, we show  that merlin expression is dramatically reduced in human malignant gliomas and  that reexpression of functional merlin dramatically inhibits both subcutaneous  and intracranial growth of human glioma cells in mice. We further show that  merlin reexpression inhibits glioma cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis in  vivo. Using microarray analysis, we identify altered expression of specific  molecules that play key roles in cell proliferation, survival, and motility.  These merlin-induced changes of gene expression were confirmed by real-time  quantitative PCR, Western blotting, and functional assays. These results  indicate that reexpression of merlin correlates with activation of mammalian  sterile 20-like 1/2-large tumor suppressor 2 signaling pathway and inhibition of  canonical and noncanonical Wnt signals. Collectively, our results show that  merlin is a potent inhibitor of high-grade human glioma.

Clark JJ(1), Provenzano M, Diggelmann HR, Xu N, Hansen SS, Hansen MR.  Author information: (1)Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, University of Iowa, Iowa  City, Iowa 52242-1078, USA.  OBJECTIVE: To analyze the ability of ErbB inhibitors to reduce the growth of  vestibular schwannoma (VS) xenografts. METHODS: Vestibular schwannoma xenografts were established in the interscapular  fat pad in nude mice for 4 weeks. Initially, a small cohort of animals was  treated with the ErbB2 inhibitor trastuzumab or saline for 2 weeks. Animals also  received bromodeoxyuridine injections to label proliferating cells. In a  longer-term experiment, animals were randomized to receive trastuzumab,  erlotinib (an ErbB kinase inhibitor), or placebo for 12 weeks. Tumor growth was  monitored by magnetic resonance imaging during the treatment period. Cell death  was analyzed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin end  labeling of fragmented DNA. RESULTS: Tumors can be distinguished with T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging  sequences. Trastuzumab significantly reduced the proliferation of VS cells  compared with control (p < 0.01) as analyzed by bromodeoxyuridine uptake.  Control tumors demonstrated slight growth during the 12-week treatment period.  Both trastuzumab and erlotinib significantly reduced the growth of VS xenografts  (p < 0.05). Erlotinib, but not trastuzumab, resulted in a significant increase  in the percentage of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin  end labeling of fragmented DNA-positive VS cells (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: In this preliminary study, the ErbB inhibitors trastuzumab and  erlotinib decreased growth of VS xenografts in nude mice, raising the  possibility of using ErbB inhibitors in the management of patients with  schwannomas, particularly those with neurofibromatosis Type 2.

Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, Division of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery,  University of California, San Diego School of Medicine and Veterans Affairs  Medical Center, La Jolla, California, USA.  OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Determine the role of estrogen receptor (ER) and  progesterone receptor (PR) expression in sporadic and neurofibromatosis 2  (NF2)-related vestibular schwannomas (VS). Growth and proliferation signaling in  human VS tumorigenesis may play a key role in molecular therapeutic targeting.  VS carry mutations of the NF2 gene encoding the tumor suppressor, merlin, which  interacts with ErbB2 in Schwann cells, implicating ErbB receptors in VS  tumorigenesis. ErbB receptor family members are overexpressed or constitutively  activated in many human tumors, and are effective therapeutic targets in some  human cancers. VS occur more frequently in women and are larger, more vascular,  and demonstrate increased growth rates during pregnancy. ER and PR may play a  role in ErbB pathway activation and VS progression. STUDY DESIGN: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for ER  and PR messenger RNA was performed using greater auricular and vestibular nerve  controls (n = 8), sporadic VS (n = 23), and NF2-related VS (n = 16) tissues. METHODS: The qRT-PCR data were normalized with standardization to a single  constitutively expressed control gene, human cyclophylin. RESULTS: Reverse transcription of messenger RNA from control and tumor specimens  followed by RT Q-PCR demonstrated differences in ER and PR gene expression  between sporadic and NF2-related VS. CONCLUSIONS: ER and PR expression in VS might have implications for development  of a VS-specific drug delivery system using antihormone and ErbB pathway small  molecule inhibitors, due to crosstalk between these receptors. These signals may  be critical for re-establishing ErbB-mediated cell density dependent growth  inhibition.

PMID:18671844,Modelling neurofibromatosis type 1 tibial dysplasia and its treatment with lovastatin.,"Modelling neurofibromatosis type 1 tibial dysplasia and its treatment with  lovastatin.  Kolanczyk M(1), Kühnisch J, Kossler N, Osswald M, Stumpp S, Thurisch B, Kornak  U, Mundlos S.  Author information: (1)Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics, FG Development & Disease,  Berlin, Germany. kolanshy@molgen.mpg.de  BACKGROUND: Bowing and/or pseudarthrosis of the tibia is a known severe  complication of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Mice with conditionally  inactivated neurofibromin (Nf1) in the developing limbs and cranium (Nf1Prx1)  show bowing of the tibia caused by decreased bone mineralisation and increased  bone vascularisation. However, in contrast to NF1 patients, spontaneous  fractures do not occur in Nf1Prx1 mice probably due to the relatively low  mechanical load. We studied bone healing in a cortical bone injury model in  Nf1Prx1 mice as a model for NF1-associated bone disease. Taking advantage of  this experimental model we explore effects of systemically applied lovastatin, a  cholesterol-lowering drug, on the Nf1 deficient bone repair. METHODS: Cortical injury was induced bilaterally in the tuberositas tibiae in  Nf1Prx1 mutant mice and littermate controls according to a method described  previously. Paraffin as well as methacrylate sections were analysed from each  animal. We divided 24 sex-matched mutant mice into a lovastatin-treated and an  untreated group. The lovastatin-treated mice received 0.15 mg activated  lovastatin by daily gavage. The bone repair process was analysed at three  consecutive time points post injury, using histological methods, micro computed  tomography measurements and in situ hybridisation. At each experimental time  point, three lovastatin-treated mutant mice, three untreated mutant mice and  three untreated control mice were analysed. The animal group humanely killed on  day 14 post injury was expanded to six treated and six untreated mutant mice as  well as six control mice. RESULTS: Bone injury repair is a complex process, which requires the concerted  effort of numerous cell types. It is initiated by an inflammatory response,  which stimulates fibroblasts from the surrounding connective tissue to  proliferate and fill in the injury site with a provisional extracellular matrix.  In parallel, mesenchymal progenitor cells from the periost are recruited into  the injury site to become osteoblasts. In Nf1Prx1 mice bone repair is delayed  and characterised by the excessive formation and the persistence of  fibro-cartilaginous tissue and impaired extracellular matrix mineralisation.  Correspondingly, expression of Runx2 is downregulated. High-dose systemic  lovastatin treatment restores Runx2 expression and accelerates new bone  formation, thus improving cortical bone repair in Nf1Prx1 tibia. The bone  anabolic effects correlate with a reduction of the mitogen activated protein  kinase pathway hyper-activation in Nf1-deficient cells. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest the potential usefulness of lovastatin, a drug  approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1987 for the treatment of  hypercholesteraemia, in the treatment of Nf1-related fracture healing  abnormalities. The experimental model presented here constitutes a valuable tool  for the pre-clinical stage testing of candidate drugs, targeting Nf1-associated  bone dysplasia.

Author information: (1)Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Herman B Wells Center for  Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202,  USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common genetic disorder caused by mutations  in the NF1 locus, which encodes neurofibromin, a negative regulator of Ras.  Patients with NF1 develop numerous neurofibromas, which contain many  inflammatory mast cells that contribute to tumor formation. Subsequent to c-Kit  stimulation, signaling from Ras to Rac1/2 to the MAPK pathway appears to be  responsible for multiple hyperactive mast cell phenotypes; however, the specific  effectors that mediate these functions remain uncertain. p21-activated kinase 1  (Pak1) is a downstream mediator of Rac1/2 that has been implicated as a positive  regulator of MAPK pathway members and is a modulator of cell growth and  cytoskeletal dynamics. Using an intercross of Pak 1(-/-) mice with Nf1(+/-)  mice, we determined that Pak1 regulates hyperactive Ras-dependent proliferation  via a Pak1/Erk pathway, whereas a Pak1/p38 pathway is required for the increased  migration in Nf1(+/-) mast cells. Furthermore, we confirmed that loss of Pak1  corrects the dermal accumulation of Nf1(+/-) mast cells in vivo to levels found  in wild-type mice. Thus, Pak1 is a novel mast cell mediator that functions as a  key node in the MAPK signaling network and potential therapeutic target in NF1  patients.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs) are highly malignant and  resistant. Transformation might implicate up regulation of epidermal growth  factor receptor (EGFR). Fifty-two MPNST samples were studied for EGFR, Ki-67,  p53, and survivin expression by immunohistochemistry and for EGFR amplification  by in situ hybridization. Results were correlated with clinical data. EGFR RNA  was also quantified by RT-PCR in 20 other MPNSTs and 14 dermal neurofibromas.  Half of the patients had a neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). EGFR expression,  detected in 86% of MPNSTs, was more frequent in NF1 specimens and closely  associated with high-grade and p53-positive areas. MPNSTs expressed more EGFR  transcripts than neurofibromas. No amplification of EGFR locus was observed. NF1  status was the only prognostic factor in multivariate analysis, with median  survivals of 18 and 43 months for patients with or without NF1. Finally, EGFR  might become a new target for MPNSTs treatment, especially in NF1-associated  MPNSTs.

PMID:18800150,Mechanisms of loss of heterozygosity in neurofibromatosis type 1-associated plexiform neurofibromas.,"Mechanisms of loss of heterozygosity in neurofibromatosis type 1-associated  plexiform neurofibromas.  Steinmann K(1), Kluwe L, Friedrich RE, Mautner VF, Cooper DN, Kehrer-Sawatzki H.  Author information: (1)Institute of Human Genetics, University of Ulm, Germany.  Plexiform neurofibromas constitute a serious burden for patients with  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a common autosomal dominant disorder  characterized by pigmentary changes and tumorous skin lesions (neurofibromas).  Despite the prominence of these benign tumors in NF1 patients, the mechanisms  underlying the tumor-associated loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in plexiform  neurofibromas have not been extensively studied. We performed LOH analysis on 43  plexiform neurofibromas from 31 NF1 patients, the largest study of its kind to  date. A total of 13 (30%) plexiform neurofibromas exhibited LOH involving 17q  markers. In three tumors, LOH was found to be confined to the NF1 gene region.  However, in none of the tumors was a somatic NF1 microdeletion, mediated by  non-allelic homologous recombination between either NF1-REPs or SUZ12 genes,  detected. Thus, NF1 microdeletions do not appear to be frequent somatic events  in plexiform neurofibromas. Determination of NF1 gene copy number by multiplex  ligation-dependent probe amplification indicated that although tumors with  smaller regions of LOH were characterized by 17q deletions, no NF1 gene copy  number changes were detected in six plexiform neurofibromas with more extensive  LOH. To our knowledge, mitotic recombination has not previously been reported to  be a frequent cause of LOH in plexiform neurofibromas.

Author information: (1)Inserm, Unité Mixte de Recherche en Santé 839, Paris, 75005, France.  Schwannomin/merlin is the product of a tumor suppressor gene mutated in  neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). Although the consequences of NF2 mutations on  Schwann cell proliferation are well established, the physiological role of  schwannomin in differentiated cells is not known. To unravel this role, we  studied peripheral nerves in mice overexpressing in Schwann cells schwannomin  with a deletion occurring in NF2 patients (P0-SCH-Delta39-121) or a C-terminal  deletion. The myelin sheath and nodes of Ranvier were essentially preserved in  both lines. In contrast, the ultrastructural and molecular organization of  contacts between Schwann cells and axons in paranodal and juxtaparanodal regions  were altered, with irregular juxtaposition of normal and abnormal areas of  contact. Similar but more severe alterations were observed in mice with  conditional deletion of the Nf2 gene in Schwann cells. The number of  Schmidt-Lanterman incisures, which are cytoplasmic channels interrupting the  compact myelin and characterized by distinct autotypic contacts, was increased  in the three mutant lines. P0-SCH-Delta39-121 and conditionally deleted mice  displayed exuberant wrapping of nonmyelinated fibers and short internodes, an  abnormality possibly related to altered control of Schwann cell proliferation.  In support of this hypothesis, Schwann cell number was increased along fibers  before myelination in P0-SCH-Delta39-121 mice but not in those with C-terminal  deletion. Schwann cell numbers were also more numerous in mice with conditional  deletion. Thus, schwannomin plays an important role in the control of Schwann  cell number and is necessary for the correct organization and regulation of  axoglial heterotypic and glio-glial autotypic contacts.

Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is characterized by the abnormal proliferation of  neuroectodermal tissues and the development of certain tumors, particularly  neurofibromas, which may progress into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors  (MPNSTs). Effective pharmacological therapy for the treatment of NF1 tumors is  currently unavailable and the prognosis for patients with MPNSTs is poor. Loss  of neurofibromin correlates with increased expression of the epidermal growth  factor receptor (EGFR) and ErbB2 tyrosine kinases and these kinases have been  shown to promote NF1 tumor-associated pathologies in vivo. We show here that  while NF1 MPNST cells have higher EGFR expression levels and are more sensitive  to EGF when compared to a non-NF1 MPNST cell line, the ability of the EGFR  inhibitor gefitinib to selectively inhibit NF1 MPNST cell proliferation is  marginal. We also show that NF1 MPNST proliferation correlates with activated  ErbB2 and can be suppressed by nanomolar concentrations of the pan-ErbB  inhibitor CI-1033 (canertinib). Consequently, targeting both EGFR and ErbB2 may  prove an effective strategy for suppressing NF1 MPNST tumor growth in vivo.

PMID:18931645,Bioluminescent imaging of intracranial vestibular schwannoma xenografts in NOD/SCID mice.,"Bioluminescent imaging of intracranial vestibular schwannoma xenografts in  NOD/SCID mice.  Neff BA(1), Voss SG, Allen C, Schroeder MA, Driscoll CL, Link MJ, Galanis E,  Sarkaria JN.  Author information: (1)Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Mayo Clinic School of  Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA. neff.brian@mayo.edu  HYPOTHESIS: Intracranial vestibular schwannoma xenografts can be successfully  established and followed with bioluminescent imaging (BLI). BACKGROUND: Transgenic and xenograft mouse models of vestibular schwannomas have  been previously reported in the literature. However, none of these models  replicate the intracranial location of these tumors to reflect the human  disease. Additionally, traditional imaging methods (magnetic resonance imaging,  computed tomography) for following tumor engraftment and growth are expensive  and time consuming. BLI has been successfully used to longitudinally follow  tumor treatment responses in a noninvasive manner. BLI's lower cost and labor  demands make this a more feasible approach for tumor monitoring in studies  involving large numbers of mice. METHODS: Patient excised vestibular schwannomas were cultured and transduced  with firefly luciferase expressing lentivirus. One million cells were  stereotactically injected into the right caudate nucleus of 21 nonobese  diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice. Schwannoma engraftment and growth  was prospectively followed for 30 weeks after injection with BLI. After animal  sacrifice, the presence of human tumor cells was confirmed with fluorescent in  situ hybridization. RESULTS: Eight (38%) of 21 mice successfully engrafted the schwannoma cells. All  of these mice were generated from 4 (67%) of the 6 patient excised tumors. These  8 mice could be differentiated from the nonengrafted mice at 21 weeks. The  engrafted group emitted BLI of greater than 100,000 photons/s (range,  142,478-3,106,300 photons/s; average, 618,740 photons/s), whereas the  nonengrafted group were all under 100,000 photons/s (range, 0-76,010 photons/s;  average, 10,737 photons/s) (p < 0.001). Fluorescent in situ hybridization  analysis confirmed the presence of viable human schwannoma cells in much greater  numbers in those mice with stable or growing tumors compared with those whose  tumors regressed. CONCLUSION: We have successfully established an intracranial schwannoma  xenograft model that can be followed with noninvasive BLI. We hope to use this  model for in vivo testing of schwannoma tumor therapies.

PMID:18953429,"The neurofibromatosis 2 tumor suppressor gene product, merlin, regulates human meningioma cell growth by signaling through YAP.","The neurofibromatosis 2 tumor suppressor gene product, merlin, regulates human  meningioma cell growth by signaling through YAP.  Striedinger K(1), VandenBerg SR, Baia GS, McDermott MW, Gutmann DH, Lal A.  Author information: (1)Brain Tumor Research Center, Department of Neurological Surgery, University  of California, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized  by the occurrence of schwannomas and meningiomas. Several studies have examined  the ability of the NF2 gene product, merlin, to function as a tumor suppressor  in diverse cell types; however, little is known about merlin growth regulation  in meningiomas. In Drosophila, merlin controls cell proliferation and apoptosis  by signaling through the Hippo pathway to inhibit the function of the  transcriptional coactivator Yorkie. The Hippo pathway is conserved in mammals.  On the basis of these observations, we developed human meningioma cell lines  matched for merlin expression to evaluate merlin growth regulation and  investigate the relationship between NF2 status and Yes-associated protein  (YAP), the mammalian homolog of Yorkie. NF2 loss in meningioma cells was  associated with loss of contact-dependent growth inhibition, enhanced  anchorage-independent growth and increased cell proliferation due to increased  S-phase entry. In addition, merlin loss in both meningioma cell lines and  primary tumors resulted in increased YAP expression and nuclear localization.  Finally, siRNA-mediated reduction of YAP in NF2-deficient meningioma cells  rescued the effects of merlin loss on cell proliferation and S-phase entry.  Collectively, these results represent the first demonstration that merlin  regulates cell growth in human cancer cells by suppressing YAP.

Jones GN(1), Tep C, Towns WH 2nd, Mihai G, Tonks ID, Kay GF, Schmalbrock PM,  Stemmer-Rachamimov AO, Yoon SO, Kirschner LS.  Author information: (1)Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, The Ohio  State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.  Signaling events leading to Schwann cell tumor initiation have been extensively  characterized in the context of neurofibromatosis (NF). Similar tumors are also  observed in patients with the endocrine neoplasia syndrome Carney complex, which  results from inactivating mutations in PRKAR1A. Loss of PRKAR1A causes enhanced  protein kinase A activity, although the pathways leading to tumorigenesis are  not well characterized. Tissue-specific ablation of Prkar1a in neural crest  precursor cells (TEC3KO mice) causes schwannomas with nearly 80% penetrance by  10 months. These heterogeneous neoplasms were clinically characterized as  genetically engineered mouse schwannomas, grades II and III. At the molecular  level, analysis of the tumors revealed almost complete loss of both NF proteins,  despite the fact that transcript levels were increased, implying  posttranscriptional regulation. Although Erk and Akt signaling are typically  enhanced in NF-associated tumors, we observed no activation of either of these  pathways in TEC3KO tumors. Furthermore, the small G proteins Ras, Rac1, and RhoA  are all known to be involved with NF signaling. In TEC3KO tumors, all three  molecules showed modest increases in total protein, but only Rac1 showed  significant activation. These data suggest that dysregulated protein kinase A  activation causes tumorigenesis through pathways that overlap but are distinct  from those described in NF tumorigenesis.

PMID:18974932,A role for the p53 pathway in the pathology of meningiomas with NF2 loss.,"A role for the p53 pathway in the pathology of meningiomas with NF2 loss.  Chang Z(1), Guo CL, Ahronowitz I, Stemmer-Rachamimov AO, MacCollin M, Nunes FP.  Author information: (1)Division of Biology, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125,  USA.  The neurofibromatosis 2 locus (NF2) is inactivated through mutation and loss of  heterozygosity (LOH) in 40-65% of all sporadic meningiomas, while the role of  the p53 tumor suppression pathway in meningioma initiation and progression is  still unclear. This study aims to determine if a p53 codon 72  arginine-to-proline polymorphism, found to be correlated with cancer development  and cancer patient survival in other tumors, is associated with sporadic  meningioma initiation or progression. We investigated Pro72 incidence in a  cohort of 92 sporadic meningiomas and analyzed its association with histological  grade (WHO classification) and with NF2 LOH (determined using polymorphic  microsatellite markers on 22q). The Pro72 allele was not found to be selected  for in the cohort. However, in the subgroup of meningiomas with NF2 LOH and  carrying Pro72, 50.0% had high grade tumors (WHO grades II and III) compared to  only 14.3% of those without NF2 LOH (OR = 6.0, CI = 1.56-23.11, P = 0.012). The  significant association occurred only when considering subgroups of meningiomas  with or without NF2 LOH, suggesting that not including NF2 status when analyzing  study cohorts may explain the variability seen in the literature where all  meningiomas were grouped together. Our data suggests a role for the p53 pathway  in the progression of meningiomas in which NF2 is inactivated, and highlights  the importance of accounting for NF2 LOH in future studies of meningiomas and  the p53 pathway.

Comment in     Cell. 2008 Oct 31;135(3):408-10. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2008.10.009.  Interactions between tumorigenic cells and their surrounding microenvironment  are critical for tumor progression yet remain incompletely understood. Germline  mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene cause neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1),  a common genetic disorder characterized by complex tumors called neurofibromas.  Genetic studies indicate that biallelic loss of Nf1 is required in the  tumorigenic cell of origin in the embryonic Schwann cell lineage. However, in  the physiologic state, Schwann cell loss of heterozygosity is not sufficient for  neurofibroma formation and Nf1 haploinsufficiency in at least one additional  nonneoplastic lineage is required for tumor progression. Here, we establish that  Nf1 heterozygosity of bone marrow-derived cells in the tumor microenvironment is  sufficient to allow neurofibroma progression in the context of Schwann cell Nf1  deficiency. Further, genetic or pharmacologic attenuation of c-kit signaling in  Nf1+/- hematopoietic cells diminishes neurofibroma initiation and progression.  Finally, these studies implicate mast cells as critical mediators of tumor  initiation.

Author information: (1)Department of Neurobiology, Brain Research Institute, University of  California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.  We uncovered a role for ERK signaling in GABA release, long-term potentiation  (LTP), and learning, and show that disruption of this mechanism accounts for the  learning deficits in a mouse model for learning disabilities in  neurofibromatosis type I (NF1). Our results demonstrate that neurofibromin  modulates ERK/synapsin I-dependent GABA release, which in turn modulates  hippocampal LTP and learning. An Nf1 heterozygous null mutation, which results  in enhanced ERK and synapsin I phosphorylation, increased GABA release in the  hippocampus, and this was reversed by pharmacological downregulation of ERK  signaling. Importantly, the learning deficits associated with the Nf1 mutation  were rescued by a subthreshold dose of a GABA(A) antagonist. Accordingly, Cre  deletions of Nf1 showed that only those deletions involving inhibitory neurons  caused hippocampal inhibition, LTP, and learning abnormalities. Importantly, our  results also revealed lasting increases in GABA release triggered by learning,  indicating that the mechanisms uncovered here are of general importance for  learning.

Author information: (1)Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Oncology, and  Transplantation, Kansas University Medical Center, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA.  ffarassati@kumc.edu  Lack of expression of neurofibromin in neurofibromatosis 1 and its lethal  derivative, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), is thought to  result in the overactivation of the Ras signaling pathway. Our previous studies  have shown that cells with overactivation in the Ras pathway are more permissive  to infection with herpes simplex virus 1 and its mutant version R3616. In this  study, we show that among five different mouse MPNST cell lines, only the ones  with elevated levels of Ras signaling are highly permissive to infection with  oncolytic herpes G207. Specific inhibitors of the Ras, ERK, and JNK pathways all  reduced the synthesis of viral proteins in MPNST cells. The cell lines that  contained lower levels of Ras and decreased activation of downstream signaling  components underwent an enhancement in apoptosis upon exposure to G207.  Additionally, mouse SW10 Schwann cells were able to become infected by parental  herpes but were found to be resistant to G207. The immortalization of these cell  lines with the expression of SV40 large T antigen increased the levels of Ras  activation and permissiveness to oncolytic herpes. A Ras/Raf kinase inhibitor  reduced the synthesis of both herpes simplex virus-1 and G207 proteins in SW10  cells. The results of this study, therefore, introduce Ras signaling as a  divergent turning point for the response of MPNST cells to an assault by  oncolytic herpes.

Raponi M(1), Buratti E, Llorian M, Stuani C, Smith CW, Baralle D.  Author information: (1)Human Genetics Division, University of Southampton, UK.  In disease-associated genes, understanding the functional significance of deep  intronic nucleotide variants represents a difficult challenge. We previously  reported that an NF1 intron 30 exonization event is triggered from a single  correct nomenclature is 'c.293-279 A>G' mutation [Raponi M, Upadhyaya M &  Baralle D (2006) Hum Mutat 27, 294-295]. In this paper, we investigate which  characteristics play a role in regulating inclusion of the aberrant pseudoexon.  Our investigation shows that pseudoexon inclusion levels are strongly  downregulated by polypyrimidine tract binding protein and its homologue neuronal  polypyrimidine tract binding protein. In particular, we provide evidence that  the functional effect of polypyrimidine tract binding protein is proportional to  its concentration, and map the cis-acting elements that are principally  responsible for this negative regulation. These results highlight the importance  of evaluating local sequence context for diagnostic purposes, and the utility of  developing therapies to turn off activated pseudoexons.

Houshmandi SS(1), Emnett RJ, Giovannini M, Gutmann DH.  Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis,  MO 63110, USA.  Individuals with the inherited cancer predisposition syndrome neurofibromatosis  2 (NF2) develop several central nervous system (CNS) malignancies, including  glial cell neoplasms (ependymomas). Recent studies have suggested that the NF2  protein, merlin (or schwannomin), may regulate receptor tyrosine kinase  signaling, intracellular mitogenic growth control pathways, or adherens junction  organization in non-nervous-system cell types. For this report, we used glial  fibrillary acidic protein conditional knockout mice and derivative glia to  determine how merlin regulates CNS glial cell proliferation. We show that the  loss of merlin in glial cells results in increased proliferation in vitro and in  vivo. Merlin regulation of glial cell growth reflects deregulated Src activity,  such that pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of Src activation reduces Nf2(-/-)  glial cell growth to wild-type levels. We further show that Src regulates  Nf2(-/-) glial cell growth by sequentially regulating FAK and paxillin  phosphorylation/activity. Next, we demonstrate that Src activation results from  merlin regulation of ErbB2 activation and that genetic or pharmacologic ErbB2  inhibition reduces Nf2(-/-) glial cell Src/Src effector activation and  proliferation to wild-type levels. Lastly, we show that merlin competes with Src  for direct binding to ErbB2 and present a novel molecular mechanism for merlin  regulation of ErbB2-dependent Src signaling and growth control.

Author information: (1)UIC Cancer Center, COMRB, Room 5099, 909 South Wolcott Avenue, Chicago, IL  60612-3725, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 2 is an inherited disorder characterized by the  development of benign and malignant tumors on the auditory nerves and central  nervous system with symptoms including hearing loss, poor balance, skin lesions,  and cataracts. Here, we report a novel protein-protein interaction between NF2  protein (merlin or schwannomin) and erythrocyte p55, also designated as MPP1.  The p55 is a conserved scaffolding protein with postulated functions in cell  shape, hair cell development, and neural patterning of the retina. The FERM  domain of NF2 protein binds directly to p55, and surface plasmon resonance  analysis indicates a specific interaction with a kD value of 3.7 nM. We  developed a specific monoclonal antibody against human erythrocyte p55, and  found that both p55 and NF2 proteins are colocalized in the non-myelin-forming  Schwann cells. This finding suggests that the p55-NF2 protein interaction may  play a functional role in the regulation of apico-basal polarity and tumor  suppression pathways in non-erythroid cells.

Golubić M(1), Tanaka K, Dobrowolski S, Wood D, Tsai MH, Marshall M, Tamanoi F,  Stacey DW.  Author information: (1)Department of Molecular Biology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, OH 44195-5285.  Three proteins, GTPase activating protein (GAP), neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) and  the yeast inhibitory regulator of the RAS-cAMP pathway (IRA2), have the ability  to stimulate the GTPase activity of Ras proteins from higher animals or yeast.  Previous studies indicate that certain lipids are able to inhibit this activity  associated with the mammalian GAP protein. Inhibition of GAP would be expected  to biologically activate Ras protein. In these studies arachidonic acid is shown  also to inhibit the activity of the catalytic fragments of the other two  proteins, mammalian NF1 and the yeast IRA2 proteins. In addition, phosphatidic  acid (containing arachidonic and stearic acid) was inhibitory for the catalytic  fragment of NF1 protein, but did not inhibit the catalytic fragments of GAP or  IRA2 proteins. These observations emphasize the biochemical similarity of these  proteins and provide support for the suggestion that lipids might play an  important role in their biological control, and therefore also in the control of  Ras activity and cellular proliferation.

Yeh TH(1), Lee DY, Gianino SM, Gutmann DH.  Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis,  Missouri 63110, USA.  Numerous studies have suggested that astrocytes in the central nervous system  (CNS) exhibit molecular and functional heterogeneity. In this regard, astroglia  from different CNS locations express distinct immune system, and  neurotransmitter proteins, have varying levels of gap junction coupling and  respond differently to injury. However, the relevance of these differences to  human disease is unclear. As brain tumors in children arise in specific CNS  locations, we hypothesized that regional astroglial cell heterogeneity might  partly underlie the propensity for gliomas to arise in these areas. In this  study, we performed high-density RNA microarray profiling on astrocytes from  postnatal day 1 optic nerve, cerebellum, brainstem, and neocortex. We showed  that astroglia from each region are molecularly distinct, and we were able to  develop gene expression patterns that distinguish astroglia, but not neural stem  cells, from these different brain regions. We next used these microarray data to  determine whether brain tumor suppressor genes were differentially expressed in  these distinct populations of astroglia. Interestingly, neurofibromatosis type 1  (NF1) gene expression was decreased at both the RNA and protein levels in  neocortical astroglia relative to astroglia from the other brain regions. To  determine the functional significance of this finding, we found increased  astroglial cell proliferation in optic nerve, brainstem, and cerebellum, but not  neocortex, following Nf1 inactivation in vitro and in vivo. These findings  provide molecular evidence for CNS astroglial cell heterogeneity, and suggest  that differences in tumor suppressor gene expression might contribute to the  regional localization of human brain tumors.

Author information: (1)Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of  Medicine, 615 Michael Street, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA. kye@emory.edu  The neurofibromatosis-2 (NF2) tumor suppressor protein, merlin or schwannomin,  inhibits cell proliferation by modulating the growth activities of its binding  partners, including the cell surface glycoprotein CD44, membrane-cytoskeleton  linker protein ezrin and PIKE (PI 3-kinase enhancer) GTPase, etc. Merlin exerts  its growth suppressive activity through a folded conformation that is tightly  controlled through phosphorylation by numerous protein kinases including PAK,  PKA and Akt. Merlin inhibits PI 3-kinase activity through binding to PIKE-L.  Now, we show that merlin is a physiological substrate of Akt, which  phosphorylates merlin on both T230 and S315 residues. This phosphorylation  abolishes the folded conformation of merlin and inhibits its association with  PIKE-L, provoking merlin polyubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation.  This finding demonstrates a negative feed-back loop from merlin/PIKE-L/PI  3-kinase to Akt in tumors- The proliferation repressive activity of merlin is  also partially regulated by S518 phosphorylation- Thus, Akt-mediated merlin  T230/S315 phosphorylation, combined with S518 phosphorylation by PAK and PKA,  provides new insight into abrogating merlin function in the absence of merlin  mutational inactivation.

Yamamoto M(1), Yamauchi T, Okano K, Takahashi M, Watabe S, Yamamoto Y.  Author information: (1)Faculty of Health Sciences, Yamaguchi University School of Medicine, Ube,  Yamaguchi, Japan. yamamoms@yamaguchi-u.ac.jp  Neurofibromas are benign tumors that comprise primarily of Schwann cells and  fibroblasts. Mast cells have been found scattered in the tumor tissue, and their  role in promoting the proliferation of neurofibroma has been suggested.  Tranilast (N-[3,4-dimethoxycinnamolyl]anthranilic acid) is an anti-allergic drug  that inhibits release of the chemical mediators from mast cells and it used for  the treatment of keloids and hypertrophic scars by its inhibition of  growth-promoting transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta(1) from fibroblasts. We  assumed that tranilast would suppress neurofibroma cell growth. In order to  prove this hypothesis, we investigated the effectiveness of tranilast in  inhibiting the tumor growth using a new cell culture system obtained from  patients with neurofibromas. We called this culture system with the mixture of  Schwann cells and fibroblasts ""NF1 cells culture"". Mast cells were  differentiated from CD34(+) peripheral blood mononuclear cells of normal healthy  subjects, and were co-cultured with NF1 cells. Three days after tranilast (10  approximately 100 microM) added to the culture dishes, we counted viable cell  numbers and measured the concentrations of TGF-beta(1), stem cell factor (SCF)  and tryptase, which exists in the histamine granule, in the culture medium.  Tranilast significantly suppressed proliferation of the NF1 cells and lowered  the levels of TGF-beta(1), SCF and tryptase. These results suggest that  tranilast retards tumor proliferation through not only suppression of cell  growth factor, but also the inhibition of a chemical mediator released from mast  cells. Thus, tranilast can be a potent therapeutic agent to inhibit the growth  of neurofibromas.  DOI: 10.1620/tjem.217.193 PMID: 19282654 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",True,Parse error - defaulted to include
PMID:19292874,Low U1 snRNP dependence at the NF1 exon 29 donor splice site.,"Low U1 snRNP dependence at the NF1 exon 29 donor splice site.  Raponi M(1), Buratti E, Dassie E, Upadhyaya M, Baralle D.  Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, UK.  Many disease-causing splicing mutations described in the literature produce  changes in splice sites (SS) or in exon-regulatory sequences. The delineation of  these splice aberrations can provide important insights into novel regulation  mechanisms. In this study, we evaluated the effect of patient variations in  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) exon 29 and its 5'SS surrounding area on its  splicing process. Only two of all nonsense, missense, synonymous and intronic  variations analyzed in this study clearly altered exon 29 inclusion/exclusion  levels. In particular, the intronic mutation +5g>a had the strongest effect,  resulting in total exon exclusion. This finding prompted us to evaluate the exon  29 5'SS in relation to its ability to bind U1 snRNP. This was performed by  direct analysis of the ability of U1 to bind to wild-type and mutant donor  sites, by engineering an in vitro splicing system to directly evaluate the  functional importance of U1 snRNA base pairing with the exon 29 donor site, and  by coexpression of mutant U1 snRNP molecules to try to rescue exon 29 inclusion  in vivo. The results revealed a low dependency on the presence of U1 snRNP, and  suggest that exon 29 donor site definition may depend on alternative mechanisms  of 5'SS recognition.

PMID:19306381,Neuregulin-1 beta and neuregulin-1 alpha differentially affect the migration and invasion of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor cells.,"Neuregulin-1 beta and neuregulin-1 alpha differentially affect the migration and  invasion of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor cells.  Eckert JM(1), Byer SJ, Clodfelder-Miller BJ, Carroll SL.  Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham,  Alabama 35294-0017, USA.  Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are the most common malignancy  associated with neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1). These Schwann cell  lineage-derived sarcomas aggressively invade adjacent nerve and soft tissue,  frequently precluding surgical resection. Little is known regarding the  mechanisms underlying this invasive behavior. We have shown that MPNSTs express  neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) beta isoforms, which promote Schwann cell migration during  development, and NRG-1 alpha isoforms, whose effects on Schwann cells are poorly  understood. Hypothesizing that NRG-1 beta and/or NRG-1 alpha promote MPNST  invasion, we found that NRG-1 beta promoted MPNST migration in a  substrate-specific manner, markedly enhancing migration on laminin but not on  collagen type I or fibronectin. The NRG-1 receptors erbB3 and erbB4 were present  in MPNST invadopodia (processes mediating invasion), partially colocalized with  focal adhesion kinase and the laminin receptor beta(1)-integrin and  coimmunoprecipitated with beta(1)-integrin. NRG-1 beta stimulated human and  murine MPNST cell migration and invasion in a concentration-dependent manner in  three-dimensional migration assays, acting as a chemotactic factor. Both  baseline and NRG-1 beta-induced migration were erbB-dependent and required the  action of MEK 1/2, SAPK/JNK, PI-3 kinase, Src family kinases and ROCK-I/II. In  contrast, NRG-1 alpha had no effect on the migration and invasion of some MPNST  lines and inhibited the migration of others. While NRG-1 beta potently and  persistently activated Erk 1/2, SAPK/JNK, Akt and Src family kinases, NRG-1  alpha did not activate Akt and activated these other kinases with kinetics  distinct from those evident in NRG-1 beta-stimulated cells. These findings  suggest that NRG-1 beta enhances MPNST migration and that NRG-1 beta and NRG-1  alpha differentially modulate this process.  (c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Author information: (1)Institute of Neuropathology, Domagkstraße 19, 48149 Münster, University  Hospital Münster, Germany.  Drosophila melanogaster has been utilized to model human brain diseases. In most  of these invertebrate transgenic models, some aspects of human disease are  reproduced. Although investigation of rodent models has been of significant  impact, invertebrate models offer a wide variety of experimental tools that can  potentially address some of the outstanding questions underlying neurological  disease. This review considers what has been gleaned from invertebrate models of  neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease,  metabolic diseases such as Leigh disease, Niemann-Pick disease and ceroid  lipofuscinoses, tumor syndromes such as neurofibromatosis and tuberous  sclerosis, epilepsy as well as CNS injury. It is to be expected that genetic  tools in Drosophila will reveal new pathways and interactions, which hopefully  will result in molecular based therapy approaches.

Ras leads an important signaling pathway that is deregulated in  neurofibromatosis type 1 and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). In  this study, we show that overactivation of Ras and many of its downstream  effectors occurred in only a fraction of MPNST cell lines. RalA, however, was  overactivated in all MPNST cells and tumor samples compared to nontransformed  Schwann cells. Silencing Ral or inhibiting it with a dominant-negative Ral (Ral  S28N) caused a significant reduction in proliferation, invasiveness, and in vivo  tumorigenicity of MPNST cells. Silencing Ral also reduced the expression of  epithelial mesenchymal transition markers. Expression of the NF1-GTPase-related  domain (NF1-GRD) diminished the levels of Ral activation, implicating a role for  neurofibromin in regulating RalA activation. NF1-GRD treatment caused a  significant decrease in proliferation, invasiveness, and cell cycle progression,  but cell death increased. We propose Ral overactivation as a novel cell  signaling abnormality in MPNST that leads to important biological outcomes with  translational ramifications.

The tumor predisposition disorder neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is one of the  most common genetic disorders of the nervous system. It is caused by mutations  in the Nf1 tumor-suppressor gene, which encodes a GTPase-activating protein  (GAP) that negatively regulates p21-RAS. Development of malignant nerve tumors  and neurofibromas occurs frequently in NF1. However, little is known about the  molecular mechanisms mediating the initiation and progression of these complex  tumors, or the identity of the specific cell type that gives rise to dermal or  cutaneous neurofibromas. In this study, we identify a population of  stem/progenitor cells residing in the dermis termed skin-derived precursors  (SKPs) that, through loss of Nf1, form neurofibromas. We propose that SKPs, or  their derivatives, are the cell of origin of dermal neurofibroma. We also  provide evidence that additional signals from nonneoplastic cells in the tumor  microenvironment play essential roles in neurofibromagenesis.

Author information: (1)Department of Neurology and Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital,  Boston, MA 02114, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a tumor suppressor gene syndrome characterized  by multiple schwannomas, especially vestibular schwannomas (VS), and  meningiomas. Anticancer drug trials are now being explored, but there are no  standardized endpoints in NF2. We review the challenges of NF2 clinical trials  and suggest possible response criteria for use in initial phase II studies. We  suggest two main response criteria in such trials. Objective radiographic  response is defined as a durable 20% or greater reduction in VS volume based on  post-contrast T1-weighted MRI images collected with 3 mm or finer cuts through  the internal auditory canal. Hearing response is defined as a statistically  significant improvement in word recognition scores using 50-word recorded lists  in audiology. A possible composite endpoint incorporating both radiographic  response and hearing response is outlined. We emphasize pitfalls in response  assessment and suggest guidelines to minimize misinterpretations of response. We  also identify research goals in NF2 to facilitate future trial conduct, such as  identifying the expectations for time to tumor progression and time to  measurable hearing loss in untreated NF2-related VS, and the relation of both  endpoints to patient prognostic factors (such as age, baseline tumor volume, and  measures of disease severity). These data would facilitate future use of  endpoints based on stability of tumor size and hearing, which might be more  appropriate for testing certain drugs. We encourage adoption of standardized  endpoints early in the development of phase II trials for this population to  facilitate comparison of results across trials of different agents.

Author information: (1)Center for Human Genetic Research, Massachusetts General Hospital, Richard B.  Simches Research Building, 185 Cambridge St., Boston, MA 02114, USA.  Inactivating mutations of the neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) gene, NF2, result  predominantly in benign neurological tumors, schwannomas and meningiomas, in  humans; however, mutations in murine Nf2 lead to a broad spectrum of cancerous  tumors. The tumor-suppressive function of the NF2 protein, merlin, a  membrane-cytoskeleton linker, remains unclear. Here, we identify the mammalian  target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) as a novel mediator of merlin's tumor  suppressor activity. Merlin-deficient human meningioma cells and merlin  knockdown arachnoidal cells, the nonneoplastic cell counterparts of meningiomas,  exhibit rapamycin-sensitive constitutive mTORC1 activation and increased growth.  NF2 patient tumors and Nf2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts demonstrate  elevated mTORC1 signaling. Conversely, the exogenous expression of wild-type  merlin isoforms, but not a patient-derived L64P mutant, suppresses mTORC1  signaling. Merlin does not regulate mTORC1 via the established mechanism of  phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt or mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular  signal-regulated kinase-mediated TSC2 inactivation and may instead regulate  TSC/mTOR signaling in a novel fashion. In conclusion, the deregulation of mTORC1  activation underlies the aberrant growth and proliferation of NF2-associated  tumors and may restrain the growth of these lesions through negative feedback  mechanisms, suggesting that rapamycin in combination with phosphoinositide  3-kinase inhibitors may be therapeutic for NF2.

DeClue JE(1), Cohen BD, Lowy DR.  Author information: (1)Laboratory of Cellular Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD  20892.  The neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene responsible for von Recklinghausen  neurofibromatosis is related to regulators of ras proteins, and a portion of NF1  that is homologous to the ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) encodes a similar  GTPase-stimulating activity. We have raised rabbit antisera to a bacterially  synthesized 48-kDa peptide corresponding to the GAP-related domain of NF1  (NF1-GRD). These antisera immunoprecipitated the NF1-GRD peptide, and one of  them specifically inhibited the GTPase-stimulating activity of NF1-GRD. The sera  specifically detected a 280-kDa protein in lysates of mouse NIH 3T3 and human  HeLa cells. This protein corresponds to the NF1 gene product, as shown by  several criteria, including partial proteolysis. Subcellular fractionation  revealed that while GAP is predominantly cytoplasmic, all of the NF1 was  recovered in a pellet (100,000 x g) fraction. NF1 was present in a large  molecular mass complex in fibroblast and Schwannoma cell lines and appears to  associate with a very large (400-500 kDa) protein in both cell types. The  relevance of these findings to cellular regulation of p21ras is discussed.

Slomiany MG(1), Dai L, Bomar PA, Knackstedt TJ, Kranc DA, Tolliver L, Maria BL,  Toole BP.  Author information: (1)Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, Medical University of South Carolina,  Charleston, South Carolina 29425, USA.  Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) develop in approximately 10% of  neurofibromatosis type-1 patients and are a major contributing factor to  neurofibromatosis-1 patient mortality and morbidity. MPNSTs are multidrug  resistant, and thus long-term patient survival rates are poor after standard  doxorubicin or multiagent chemotherapies. We show that the hyaluronan receptor  CD44 forms complexes with multidrug transporters, BCRP (ABCG2) and  P-glycoprotein (ABCB1), in the plasma membrane of human MPNST cells. Small  hyaluronan oligosaccharides antagonize hyaluronan-CD44-mediated processes and  inhibit hyaluronan production. Treatment of MPNST cells with the hyaluronan  oligomers causes disassembly of CD44-transporter complexes and induces  internalization of CD44, BCRP, and P-glycoprotein. Consequently, the oligomers  suppress drug transporter activity and increase sensitivity to doxorubicin  treatment in culture. In vivo, systemic administration of hyaluronan oligomers  inhibits growth of MPNST xenografts. Moreover, the oligomers and doxorubicin act  synergistically in vivo, in that combined suboptimal doses induce tumor  regression to a greater extent than the additive effects of each agent alone.  These findings indicate that constitutive hyaluronan-CD44 interactions  contribute to drug transporter localization and function at the plasma membrane,  and that attenuating hyaluronan-CD44 interactions sensitizes MPNSTs to  doxorubicin in vitro and in vivo. These results also show the potential efficacy  of hyaluronan oligomers, which are nontoxic and nonimmunogenic, as an adjuvant  for chemotherapy in MPNST patients.

Kweh F(1), Zheng M, Kurenova E, Wallace M, Golubovskaya V, Cance WG.  Author information: (1)University of Florida Shands Cancer Center, Gainesville, Florida, USA.  The NF1 gene that is altered in patients with type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF1)  encodes a neurofibromin protein that functions as a tumor suppressor. In this  report, we show for the first time physical interaction between neurofibromin  and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), the protein that localizes at focal adhesions.  We show that neurofibromin associates with the N-terminal domain of FAK, and  that the C-terminal domain of neurofibromin directly interacts with FAK.  Confocal microscopy demonstrates colocalization of NF1 and FAK in the cytoplasm,  perinuclear and nuclear regions inside the cells. Nf1+/+ MEF cells expressed  less cell growth during serum deprivation conditions, and adhered less on  collagen and fibronectin-treated plates than Nf1(-/-) MEF cells, associated with  changes in actin and FAK staining. In addition, Nf1+/+ MEF cells detached more  significantly than Nf1(-/-) MEF cells by disruption of FAK signaling with the  dominant-negative inhibitor of FAK, C-terminal domain of FAK (FAK-CD). Thus, the  results demonstrate the novel interaction of neurofibromin and FAK and suggest  their involvement in cell adhesion, cell growth, and other cellular events and  pathways.

Morris ZS(1), McClatchey AI.  Author information: (1)Massachusetts General Hospital Center for Cancer Research and Department of  Pathology, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, MA 02129, USA.  The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has frequently been implicated in  hyperproliferative diseases of renal tubule epithelia. We have shown that the  NF2 tumor suppressor Merlin inhibits EGFR internalization and signaling in a  cell contact-dependent manner. Interestingly, despite the paucity of recurring  mutations in human renal cell carcinoma (RCC), homozygous mutation of the NF2  gene is found in approximately 2% of RCC patient samples in the Sanger COSMIC  database. To examine the roles of Merlin and EGFR in kidney tumorigenesis, we  generated mice with a targeted deletion of Nf2 in the proximal convoluted  epithelium using a Villin-Cre transgene. All of these mice developed  intratubular neoplasia by 3 months, which progressed to invasive carcinoma by  6-10 months. Kidneys from these mice demonstrated marked hyperproliferation and  a concomitant increase in label-retaining putative progenitor cells. Early  lumen-filling lesions in this model exhibited hyperactivation of EGFR signaling,  altered solubility of adherens junctions components, and loss of epithelial  polarity. Renal cortical epithelial cells derived from either early or late  lesions were dependent on EGF for in vitro proliferation and were arrested by  pharmacologic inhibition of EGFR or re-expression of Nf2. These cells formed  malignant tumors upon s.c. injection into immunocompromised mice before in vitro  passage. Treatment of Vil-Cre;Nf2(lox/lox) mice with the EGFR inhibitor  erlotinib halted the proliferation of tumor cells. These studies give added  credence to the role of EGFR signaling and perhaps Nf2 deficiency in RCC and  describe a rare and valuable mouse model for exploring the molecular basis of  this disease.

Xu J(1), Ismat FA, Wang T, Lu MM, Antonucci N, Epstein JA.  Author information: (1)Department of Cell and Developmental Biology and the Penn Cardiovascular  Institute, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.  RATIONALE: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant  disorder with a broad array of clinical manifestations, including benign and  malignant tumors, and characteristic cutaneous findings. NF1 patients also have  an increased incidence of cardiovascular diseases, including obstructive  vascular disorders and hypertension. The disease gene, NF1, encodes  neurofibromin, a ubiquitously expressed protein that acts, in part, as a Ras-GAP  (GTP-ase activating protein), downregulating the activity of activated Ras  protooncogenes. In animal models, endothelial and smooth muscle expression of  the disease gene is critical for normal heart development and the prevention of  vascular disease, respectively. OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of NF1 in the postnatal and adult heart. METHODS AND RESULTS: We generated mice with homozygous loss of the murine  homolog Nf1 in myocardium (Nf1mKO) and evaluated their hearts for biochemical,  structural, and functional changes. Nf1mKO mice have normal embryonic  cardiovascular development but have marked cardiac hypertrophy, progressive  cardiomyopathy, and fibrosis in the adult. Hyperactivation of Ras and downstream  pathways are seen in the heart with the loss of Nf1, along with activation of a  fetal gene program. CONCLUSIONS: This report describes a critical role of Nf1 in the regulation of  cardiac growth and function. Activation of pathways known to be involved in  cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction are seen with the loss of myocardial  neurofibromin.

Du X(1), Sprang SR.  Author information: (1)Department of Biochemistry, University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center,  6001 Forest Park, Room ND10.300, Dallas, Texas 75390-9050, USA.  Ras-catalyzed guanosine 5' triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis proceeds through a  loose transition state as suggested in our previous study of (18)O kinetic  isotope effects (KIE) [ Du , X. et al. ( 2004 ) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.  101 , 8858 - 8863 ]. To probe the mechanisms of GTPase activation protein  (GAP)-facilitated GTP hydrolysis reactions, we measured the (18)O KIEs in GTP  hydrolysis catalyzed by Ras in the presence of GAP(334) or NF1(333), the  catalytic fragment of p120GAP or NF1. The KIEs in the leaving group oxygens (the  beta nonbridge and the beta-gamma bridge oxygens) reveal that chemistry is  rate-limiting in GAP(334)-facilitated GTP hydrolysis but only partially  rate-limiting in the NF1(333)-facilitated GTP hydrolysis reaction. The KIEs in  the gamma nonbridge oxygens and the leaving group oxygens reveal that the  GAP(334) or NF1(333)-facilitated GTP hydrolysis reaction proceeds through a  loose transition state that is similar in nature to the transition state of the  GTP hydrolysis catalyzed by Ras alone. However, the KIEs in the pro-S beta,  pro-R beta, and beta-gamma oxygens suggest that charge increase on the  beta-gamma bridge oxygen is more prominent in the transition states of GAP(334)-  and NF1(333)-facilitated reactions than that catalyzed by the intrinsic GTPase  activity of Ras. The charge distribution on the two beta nonbridge oxygens is  also very asymmetric. The catalytic roles of active site residues were inferred  from the effect of mutations on the reaction rate and KIEs. Our results suggest  that the arginine finger of GAP and amide protons in the P-loop of Ras stabilize  the negative charge on the beta-gamma bridge oxygen and the pro-S beta nonbridge  oxygen of a loose transition state, whereas Lys-16 of Ras and Mg(2+) are only  involved in substrate binding.

Medical Drive, Salt Lake City, UT 84132, USA.  david.stevenson@hsc.utah.edu  The field of medical genetics is rapidly advancing, and therapeutic options to  treat genetic syndromes are becoming increasingly available. An understanding of  the pathophysiology of various genetic disorders has provided researchers the  opportunity to propose and test pharmacologic agents in preclinical murine  models with hopes of translation to human trials. The development of clinical  trials can be costly and time consuming, particularly for rare conditions. Pilot  feasibility studies should be performed when designing clinical trials for  genetic disorders. The development and selection of appropriate outcome measures  are particularly paramount in the implementation of clinical trials. The  selection of inappropriate outcome measures can lead to non-measurable  differences or clinically insignificant findings. In addition, just as age  appropriate measures are needed, some instruments may not apply to populations  with specific genetic disorders that have significant cognitive and physical  impairment, as the measures may not be sensitive enough to identify clinically  significant changes. In the last decade, health-related quality of life measures  (HRQOL) have been increasingly included as an outcome measure in clinical  trials. While traditional clinical outcomes are important, these newly developed  instruments should be considered along with clinical indicators as measures of  effect in clinical trials of interventions in genetic disorders.  2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Saydam O(1), Shen Y, Würdinger T, Senol O, Boke E, James MF, Tannous BA,  Stemmer-Rachamimov AO, Yi M, Stephens RM, Fraefel C, Gusella JF, Krichevsky AM,  Breakefield XO.  Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Neuroscience  Program, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02129, USA.  Meningiomas, one of the most common human brain tumors, are derived from  arachnoidal cells associated with brain meninges, are usually benign, and are  frequently associated with neurofibromatosis type 2. Here, we define a typical  human meningioma microRNA (miRNA) profile and characterize the effects of one  downregulated miRNA, miR-200a, on tumor growth. Elevated levels of miR-200a  inhibited meningioma cell growth in culture and in a tumor model in vivo.  Upregulation of miR-200a decreased the expression of transcription factors ZEB1  and SIP1, with consequent increased expression of E-cadherin, an adhesion  protein associated with cell differentiation. Downregulation of miR-200a in  meningiomas and arachnoidal cells resulted in increased expression of  beta-catenin and cyclin D1 involved in cell proliferation. miR-200a was found to  directly target beta-catenin mRNA, thereby inhibiting its translation and  blocking Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, which is frequently involved in cancer. A  direct correlation was found between the downregulation of miR-200a and the  upregulation of beta-catenin in human meningioma samples. Thus, miR-200a appears  to act as a multifunctional tumor suppressor miRNA in meningiomas through  effects on the E-cadherin and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways. This reveals  a previously unrecognized signaling cascade involved in meningioma tumor  development and highlights a novel molecular interaction between miR-200a and  Wnt signaling, thereby providing insights into novel therapies for meningiomas.

Cutts BA(1), Sjogren AK, Andersson KM, Wahlstrom AM, Karlsson C, Swolin B, Bergo  MO.  Author information: (1)Wallenberg Laboratory, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska University  Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.  Hyperactive RAS signaling is caused by mutations in RAS genes or a deficiency of  the neurofibromatosis gene (NF1) and is common in myeloid malignancies. In mice,  expression of oncogenic K-RAS or inactivation of Nf1 in hematopoietic cells  results in myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) that do not progress to acute  myeloid leukemia (AML). Because NF1 is a RAS-GTPase-activating protein it has  been proposed that NF1 deficiency is functionally equivalent to an oncogenic  RAS. It is not clear, however, whether Nf1 deficiency would be redundant in  K-RAS-induced MPD development or whether the 2 mutations would cooperate in  leukemogenesis. Here, we show that the simultaneous inactivation of Nf1 and  expression of K-RAS(G12D) in mouse hematopoietic cells results in AML that was  fatal in primary mice within 4 weeks and transplantable to sublethally  irradiated secondary recipients. The data point to a strong cooperation between  Nf1 deficiency and oncogenic K-RAS.  DOI: 10.1182/blood-2009-02-205146 PMID: 19710506 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",True,Mouse model of NF1

Author information: (1)Department of Pharmacology, Medical College, Yanbian University, 13300,  Yanji, Jilin Province, People's Republic of China.  Neurite outgrowth and neuronal differentiation play a crucial role in the  development of the nervous system. Understanding of neurotrophins induced  neurite outgrowth was important to develop therapeutic strategy for axon  regeneration in neurodegenerative diseases as well as after various nerve  injuries. It has been reported that extension of neurite and differentiation of  sympathetic neuron-like phenotype was modulated by nerve growth factor (NGF) in  PC12 cells. In this study, NGF mediated neurite outgrowth was investigated in  PC12 cells after liquiritin exposure. Liquiritin is a kind of flavonoids that is  extracted from Glycyrrhizae radix, which is frequently used to treat injury or  swelling for its life-enhancing properties as well as detoxification in  traditional Oriental medicine. The result showed that liquiritin significantly  promotes the neurite outgrowth stimulated by NGF in PC12 cells in dose dependant  manners whereas the liquiritin alone did not induce neurite outgrowth. Oligo  microarray and RT-PCR analysis further clarified that the neurotrophic effect of  liquiritin was related to the overexpression of neural related genes such as  neurogenin 3, neurofibromatosis 1, notch gene homolog 2, neuromedin U receptor 2  and neurotrophin 5. Thus, liquiritin may be a good candidate for treatment of  various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's  disease.

Sekido Y(1).  Author information: (1)Division of Molecular Oncology, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute,  Nagoya, Japan. ysekido@aichi-cc.jp  Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a tumor with poor prognosis associated with  asbestos exposure. While it remains to be clarified how asbestos fibers confer  genetic/epigenetic alterations and induce cellular transformation in normal  mesothelial cells, the understanding of key molecular mechanisms of MM cell  development, proliferation, and invasion has progressed. MM shows frequent  genetic inactivation of tumor suppressor genes of p16(INK4a)/p14(ARF) and  neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) which encodes Merlin, and epigenetic inactivation  of RASSF1A. However, no frequent mutations of well-known oncogenes such as K-RAS  and PIK3CA have been identified. Activation of multiple receptor tyrosine  kinases including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family and MET,  and subsequent deregulations of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and  phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling cascades are frequently  observed in most MM cells. The tumor suppressive function of Merlin in MM cells  is also being investigated by dissecting its possible downstream signaling  cascade called the Hippo pathway. Further comprehensive delineation of  dysregulated signaling cascades in MM cells will lead to identification of key  addiction pathways for cell survival and proliferation of MM cells, which  strongly promote establishment of a new molecular target therapy for MM.

Yu J(1), Deshmukh H, Gutmann RJ, Emnett RJ, Rodriguez FJ, Watson MA, Nagarajan  R, Gutmann DH.  Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, Washington University School of Medicine, Box 8111,  660 South Euclid Avenue, Saint Louis, MO 63110, USA.  Comment in     Neurology. 2009 Nov 10;73(19):1522-3. doi: 10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181c1850e.  OBJECTIVE: Independent studies have previously demonstrated that both the HIPK2  and BRAF genes are amplified and rearranged, respectively, in pilocytic  astrocytomas (PAs). The purpose of this study was to further investigate the  frequency of BRAF and HIPK2 alterations in PAs, the concordance of these events,  and their relationship to clinical phenotype. METHODS: We performed extensive characterization by array-based copy number  assessment (aCGH), HIPK2 copy number analysis, and BRAF rearrangement and  mutation analysis in a set of 79 PAs, including 9 tumors from patients with  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). RESULTS: We identified 1 of 3 previously identified BRAF rearrangements in 42/70  sporadic PAs. An additional 2 tumors with no rearrangement also exhibited BRAF  mutation, including a novel 3-base insertion. As predicted from the genomic  organization at this locus, 22/36 tumors with BRAF rearrangement also exhibited  corresponding HIPK2 amplification. However, 14/36 tumors with BRAF rearrangement  had no detectable HIPK2 gene amplification and 6/20 tumors demonstrated HIPK2  amplification without apparent BRAF rearrangement or mutation. Only 12/70 PAs  lacked detectable BRAF or HIPK2 alterations. Importantly, none of the 9 PA  tumors from NF1 patients exhibited BRAF rearrangement or mutation. CONCLUSIONS: BRAF rearrangement represents the most common genetic alteration in  sporadic, but not neurofibromatosis type 1-associated, pilocytic astrocytomas  (PAs). These findings implicate BRAF in the pathogenesis of these common  low-grade astrocytomas in children, and suggest that PAs arise either from NF1  inactivation or BRAF gain of function.

Comment in     Future Oncol. 2010 Apr;6(4):499-501. doi: 10.2217/fon.10.29.  Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) carry approximately a 10% lifetime  risk of developing a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). Although  the molecular mechanisms underlying NF1 to MPNST malignant transformation remain  unclear, alterations of both the RAS/RAF/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling  pathways have been implicated. In a series of genetically engineered murine  models, we perturbed RAS/RAF/MAPK or/and PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway, individually or  simultaneously, via conditional activation of K-ras oncogene or deletion of Nf1  or Pten tumor suppressor genes. Only K-Ras activation in combination with a  single Pten allele deletion led to 100% penetrable development of NF lesions and  subsequent progression to MPNST. Importantly, loss or decrease in PTEN  expression was found in all murine MPNSTs and a majority of human NF1-associated  MPNST lesions, suggesting that PTEN dosage and its controlled signaling pathways  are critical for transformation of NFs to MPNST. Using noninvasive in vivo  PET-CT imaging, we demonstrated that FDG can be used to identify the malignant  transformation in both murine and human MPNSTs. Our data suggest that combined  inhibition of RAS/RAF/MAPK and PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathways may be beneficial for  patients with MPNST.

Author information: (1)Department of Neurology and Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, and  Neuroscience Program, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, 02129, USA.  osaydam@partners.org  Meningiomas are among the most frequent tumors of the brain and spinal cord  accounting for 15-20% of all central nervous system tumors and frequently  associated with neurofibromatosis type 2. In this study, we aimed to unravel  molecular meningioma tumorigenesis and discover novel protein biomarkers for  diagnostic and/or prognostic purposes and performed in-depth proteomic profiling  of meningioma cells compared to human primary arachnoidal cells. We isolated  proteins from meningioma cell line SF4433 and human primary arachnoidal cells  and analyzed the protein profiles by Gel-nanoLC-MS/MS in conjunction with  protein identification and quantification by shotgun nanoLC tandem mass  spectrometry and spectral counting. Differential analysis of meningiomas  revealed changes in the expression levels of 281 proteins (P < 0.01) associated  with various biological functions such as DNA replication, recombination, cell  cycle, and apoptosis. Among several interesting proteins, we focused on a subset  of the highly significantly up-regulated proteins, the minichromosome  maintenance (MCM) family. We performed subsequent validation studies by qRT-PCR  in human meningioma tissue samples (WHO grade I, 14 samples; WHO grade II, 7  samples; and WHO grade III, 7 samples) compared to arachnoidal tissue controls  (from fresh autopsies; 3 samples) and found that MCMs are highly and  significantly up-regulated in human meningioma tumor samples compared to  arachnoidal tissue controls. We found a significant increase in MCM2 (8 fold),  MCM3 (5 fold), MCM4 (4 fold), MCM5 (4 fold), MCM6 (3 fold), and MCM7 (5 fold)  expressions in meningiomas. This study suggests that MCM family proteins are  up-regulated in meningiomas and can be used as diagnostic markers.

Hennigan RF(1), Foster LA, Chaiken MF, Mani T, Gomes MM, Herr AB, Ip W.  Author information: (1)Department of Cancer & Cell Biology, University of Cincinnati, Colege of  Medicine, Cincinnati, OH 45267, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 2 is an inherited autosomal disorder caused by biallelic  inactivation of the NF2 tumor suppressor gene. The NF2 gene encodes a 70-kDa  protein, merlin, which is a member of the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) family. ERM  proteins are believed to be regulated by a transition between a closed  conformation, formed by binding of their N-terminal FERM domain and C-terminal  tail domain (CTD), and an open conformation, in which the two domains do not  interact. Previous work suggests that the tumor suppressor function of merlin is  similarly regulated and that only the closed form is active. Therefore,  understanding the mechanisms that control its conformation is crucial. We have  developed a series of probes that measures merlin conformation by fluorescence  resonance energy transfer, both as purified protein and in live cells. Using  these tools, we find that merlin exists predominately as a monomer in a stable,  closed conformation that is mediated by the central alpha-helical domain. The  contribution from the FERM-CTD interaction to the closed conformation appears to  be less important. Upon phosphorylation or interaction with an effector protein,  merlin undergoes a subtle conformational change, suggesting a novel mechanism  that modulates the interaction between the FERM domain and the CTD.

Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer  Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Research Foundation, University of  Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH 45229-3039, USA.  Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive sarcomas  without effective therapeutics. Bioinformatics was used to identify potential  therapeutic targets. Paired Box (PAX), Eyes Absent (EYA), Dachsund (DACH) and  Sine Oculis (SIX) genes, which form a regulatory interactive network in  Drosophila, were found to be dysregulated in human MPNST cell lines and solid  tumors. We identified a decrease in DACH1 expression, and increases in the  expressions of PAX6, EYA1, EYA2, EYA4, and SIX1-4 genes. Consistent with the  observation that half of MPNSTs develop in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)  patients, subsequent to NF1 mutation, we found that exogenous expression of the  NF1-GTPase activating protein-related domain normalized DACH1 expression. EYA4  mRNA was elevated more than 100-fold as estimated by quantitative real-time PCR  in most MPNST cell lines. In vitro, suppression of EYA4 expression using short  hairpin RNA reduced cell adhesion and migration and caused cellular necrosis  without affecting cell proliferation or apoptotic cell death. MPNST cells  expressing shEYA4 either failed to form tumors in nude mice or formed very small  tumors, with extensive necrosis but similar levels of proliferation and  apoptosis as control cells. Our findings identify a role of EYA4 and possibly  interacting SIX and DACH proteins in MPNSTs and suggest the EYA4 pathway as a  rational therapeutic target.

Von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis is a common autosomal dominant genetic  disorder characterized by benign and malignant tumors of neural crest origin.  Significant progress in understanding the pathophysiology of this disease has  occurred in recent years, largely aided by the development of relevant animal  models. Von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis is caused by mutations in the NF1  gene, which encodes neurofibromin, a large protein that modulates the activity  of Ras. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of zebrafish  nf1a and nf1b, orthologues of NF1, and show neural crest and cardiovascular  defects resulting from morpholino knockdown, including vascular and cardiac  valvular abnormalities. Development of a zebrafish model of von Recklinghausen  neurofibromatosis will allow for structure-function analysis and genetic screens  in this tractable vertebrate system.

Author information: (1)Department of Dermatology, Jefferson Medical College, Thomas Jefferson  University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107.  Strikingly selective expression patterns of beta 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, and alpha  5 integrin subunits were revealed in endoneurium, perineurium, and epineurium of  fetal and adult human peripheral nerve by immunostaining with specific  antibodies. The alpha 2 subunit was expressed only on Schwann cells both in  fetal and adult nerve, whereas the alpha 3 epitopes were expressed exclusively  in the adult tissue and were primarily present on perineurial cells. The alpha 5  epitopes were expressed only on the innermost cell layer of perineurium of fetal  and adult nerve. The tumor cells within schwannomas and cutaneous neurofibromas  expressed both alpha 2 and alpha 3 subunits, indicating that Schwann cells have  the potential to express also the alpha 3 subunit in vivo. Cell cultures  established from human fetal nerve and neurofibromas revealed expression of the  alpha 2 and alpha 5 epitopes on Schwann cells, perineurial cells, and  fibroblasts, whereas only Schwann cells contained the alpha 3 epitopes which  were occasionally concentrated on the adjacent Schwann cells at cell-cell  contacts. Our findings emphasize that nerve connective tissue cells change their  profiles for expression of extracellular matrix receptors under conditions which  have different regulatory control signals exerted by, for example, axons,  humoral factors, or the extracellular matrix of the peripheral nerve. This  plasticity may play an important role during nerve development and in neoplastic  processes affecting the connective tissue compartments of peripheral nerve.

Arima Y(1), Hayashi H, Kamata K, Goto TM, Sasaki M, Kuramochi A, Saya H.  Author information: (1)Division of Gene Regulation, Institute for Advanced Medical Research, School  of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.  Plexiform and/or dermal neurofibromas are nerve sheath tumors of the peripheral  nervous system that are usually present in individuals with neurofibromatosis  type 1 (NF1). Neurofibromas arise from Schwann cells with biallelic inactivation  of NF1, the gene that encodes neurofibromin. This protein is responsible for  regulation of the Ras-mediated pathway, which has been shown to play a crucial  role in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT is a biological process  that occurs during embryogenesis and wound healing and is involved in  pathological processes such as organ fibrosis and cancer metastasis. However,  the relationship between neurofibromin and EMT has not been elucidated. We  investigated whether the EMT-related signaling pathway was upregulated in  NF1-associated neurofibromas and Schwann cells by assessing the expression  levels of the EMT-related transcription factors Snail, Slug, Twist, ZEB1 and  ZEB2. Immunohistochemical studies and quantitative reverse transcription  polymerase chain reaction revealed an increase in the expression levels of  EMT-related transcription factors in neurofibroma specimens and NF1-derived  Schwann cells (sNF96.2). In addition, the silencing of NF1 by siRNA induced the  expression of EMT-related transcription factors in normal human Schwann cells  and in epithelial-like breast cancer cells. Our findings suggest that the loss  of neurofibromin activated the EMT-related signaling pathway and that the  excessive mesenchymal reaction may play a key role in the development of  NF1-associated neurofibromas.

Understanding the biological pathways critical for common neurofibromatosis type  1 (NF1) peripheral nerve tumours is essential, as there is a lack of tumour  biomarkers, prognostic factors and therapeutics. We used gene expression  profiling to define transcriptional changes between primary normal Schwann cells  (n = 10), NF1-derived primary benign neurofibroma Schwann cells (NFSCs) (n =  22), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (MPNST) cell lines (n = 13),  benign neurofibromas (NF) (n = 26) and MPNST (n = 6). Dermal and plexiform NFs  were indistinguishable. A prominent theme in the analysis was aberrant  differentiation. NFs repressed gene programs normally active in Schwann cell  precursors and immature Schwann cells. MPNST signatures strongly differed; genes  up-regulated in sarcomas were significantly enriched for genes activated in  neural crest cells. We validated the differential expression of 82 genes  including the neural crest transcription factor SOX9 and SOX9 predicted targets.  SOX9 immunoreactivity was robust in NF and MPSNT tissue sections and targeting  SOX9 - strongly expressed in NF1-related tumours - caused MPNST cell death. SOX9  is a biomarker of NF and MPNST, and possibly a therapeutic target in NF1.

Omelyanchuk LV(1), Pertseva JA, Burns SS, Chang LS.  Author information: (1)Institute of Cytology and Genetics, Russian Academy of Sciences, 10  Lavrent'ev Ave., 630090, Novosibirsk, Russia. ome@bionet.nsc.ru  Hepatocyte growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase substrate (HRS) is an  endosomal protein required for trafficking receptor tyrosine kinases from the  early endosome to the lysosome. HRS interacts with Merlin, the Neurofibromatosis  2 (NF2) gene product, and this interaction may be important for Merlin's tumor  suppressor activity. Understanding the evolution, origin, and structure of HRS  may provide new insight into Merlin function. We show that HRS homologs are  present across a wide range of Metazoa with the yeast Vps27 protein as their  most distant ancestor. The phylogenetic tree of the HRS family coincides with  species evolution and divergence, suggesting a unique function for HRS. Sequence  alignment shows that various protein domains of HRS, including the VHS domain,  the FYVE domain, the UIM domain, and the clathrin-binding domain, are conserved  from yeast to multicellular organisms. The evolutionary transition from  unicellular to multicellular organisms was accompanied by the appearance of a  binding site for Merlin, which emerges in the early Metazoa after its separation  from flatworms. In addition to the region responsible for growth suppression,  the Merlin-binding and STAM-binding domains of HRS are conserved among  multicellular organisms. The residue equivalent to tyrosine-377, which is  phosphorylated in the human HRS protein, is highly conserved throughout the HRS  family. Three additional conserved boxes lacking assigned functions are found in  the HRS proteins of Metazoa. While boxes 1 and 3 may constitute the Eps-15-and  Snx1-binding sites, respectively, box 2, containing the residue equivalent to  tyrosine-377, is likely to be important for HRS phosphorylation. While several  functional domains are conserved throughout the HRS family, the STAM-binding,  Merlin-binding, and growth suppression domains evolved in the early Metazoa  around the time the Merlin protein emerged. As these domains appear during the  transition to multicellularity, their functional roles may be related to  cell-cell interaction.

Bosco EE(1), Nakai Y, Hennigan RF, Ratner N, Zheng Y.  Author information: (1)Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's  Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA.  The neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene encodes merlin, a  membrane/cytoskeleton protein necessary for the maintenance of contact  inhibition of growth in cells. Bi-allelic inactivation of NF2 is known to cause  multiple cancers in both humans and mice. However, the mechanism through which  merlin exerts its tumor-suppressive function remains obscure. In this report, we  show that NF2 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts lost contact inhibition of  cell proliferation and contained significantly increased canonical Wnt  signaling. Inhibition of Rac1, the activity of which is inversely regulated by  NF2, through the use of a dominant-negative mutant, small hairpin RNA or a small  molecule inhibitor in NF2-deficient cells, was able to suppress elevated Wnt  signals as shown by reduced activity of the T-cell factor 4 (TCF4) transcription  factor. Dominant-negative TCF4 or Rac1 mutant, as well as a small molecule  inhibition of Wnt, were able to curb NF2 deficiency-elicited cell proliferation  at the confluent state. Thus, Rac1-mediated canonical Wnt signaling is essential  for the loss of contact inhibition in NF2-deficient cells.

Morales FC(1), Molina JR, Hayashi Y, Georgescu MM.  Author information: (1)Department of Neuro-Oncology, The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer  Center, 6767 Bertner Avenue, Houston, TX 77030, USA.  Glioblastoma is a frequent brain malignancy with a dismal prognosis. The  molecular changes causing its aggressive phenotype are under investigation. We  report that the cytoskeletal-related proteins neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) and  ezrin have opposite yet interdependent activities in glioblastoma growth. We  show that NF2 is absent in approximately one-third of glioblastoma cell lines  and tumors, and that it suppresses growth when expressed in cells. Although  ezrin overexpression was previously observed in glioblastoma, we show here that  ezrin enhanced cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth but only in  cells expressing NF2. Ezrin interacted and delocalized NF2 from the cortical  compartment releasing its inhibition on Rac1. By using swap NF2-ezrin molecules,  we identified that the opposite effects on cell growth of NF2 and ezrin depend  on their amino-terminal FERM domain. The subcellular cortical localization  appeared important for NF2 suppressive activity. In contrast, the ability of  ezrin to enhance growth or complex NF2 did not depend on the molecular  conformation or subcellular localization. In conclusion, these studies show 2  mechanisms for NF2 inactivation in glioblastoma: (i) decreased protein  expression and (ii) increasing dosages of ezrin that disable NF2 by  intermolecular association and aberrant intracellular recruitment.

PMID:20159598,Kibra functions as a tumor suppressor protein that regulates Hippo signaling in conjunction with Merlin and Expanded.,"Kibra functions as a tumor suppressor protein that regulates Hippo signaling in  conjunction with Merlin and Expanded.  Yu J(1), Zheng Y, Dong J, Klusza S, Deng WM, Pan D.  Author information: (1)Department of Biological Science, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL  32306, USA.  The Hippo signaling pathway regulates organ size and tissue homeostasis from  Drosophila to mammals. Central to this pathway is a kinase cascade wherein Hippo  (Hpo), in complex with Salvador (Sav), phosphorylates and activates Warts (Wts),  which in turn phosphorylates and inactivates the Yorkie (Yki) oncoprotein, known  as the YAP coactivator in mammalian cells. The FERM domain proteins Merlin (Mer)  and Expanded (Ex) are upstream components that regulate Hpo activity through  unknown mechanisms. Here we identify Kibra as another upstream component of the  Hippo signaling pathway. We show that Kibra functions together with Mer and Ex  in a protein complex localized to the apical domain of epithelial cells, and  that this protein complex regulates the Hippo kinase cascade via direct binding  to Hpo and Sav. These results shed light on the mechanism of Ex and Mer function  and implicate Kibra as a potential tumor suppressor with relevance to  neurofibromatosis.  Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Phan VT(1), Ding VW, Li F, Chalkley RJ, Burlingame A, McCormick F.  Author information: (1)UCSF Helen Diller Family, Comprehensive Cancer Center, 2340 Sutter Street,  San Francisco, CA 94115, USA.  The neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene encodes the GTPase-activating protein  (GAP) neurofibromin, which negatively regulates Ras activity. The yeast  Saccharomyces cerevisiae has two neurofibromin homologs, Ira1 and Ira2. To  understand how these proteins are regulated, we utilized an unbiased proteomics  approach to identify Ira2 and neurofibromin binding partners. We demonstrate  that the Gpb1/Krh2 protein binds and negatively regulates Ira2 by promoting its  ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. We extended our findings to show that in  mammalian cells, the ETEA/UBXD8 protein directly interacts with and negatively  regulates neurofibromin. ETEA contains both UBA and UBX domains. Overexpression  of ETEA downregulates neurofibromin in human cells. Purified ETEA, but not a  mutant of ETEA that lacks the UBX domain, ubiquitinates the neurofibromin  GAP-related domain in vitro. Silencing of ETEA expression increases  neurofibromin levels and downregulates Ras activity. These findings provide  evidence for conserved ubiquitination pathways regulating the RasGAP proteins  Ira2 (in yeast) and neurofibromin (in humans).

Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of  Medicine, Indianapolis, 46202, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) results from mutations in the NF1 tumor  suppressor gene, which encodes the protein neurofibromin. NF1 patients display  diverse clinical manifestations, including vascular disease, which results from  neointima formation and vessel occlusion. However, the pathogenesis of NF1  vascular disease remains unclear. Vessel wall homeostasis is maintained by  complex interactions between vascular and bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs), and  neurofibromin regulates the function of each cell type. Therefore, utilizing  cre/lox techniques and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to delete 1  allele of Nf1 in endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and BMDCs  alone, we determined which cell lineage is critical for neointima formation in  vivo in mice. Here we demonstrate that heterozygous inactivation of Nf1 in BMDCs  alone was necessary and sufficient for neointima formation after vascular injury  and provide evidence of vascular inflammation in Nf1+/- mice. Further, analysis  of peripheral blood from NF1 patients without overt vascular disease revealed  increased concentrations of inflammatory cells and cytokines previously linked  to vascular inflammation and vasoocclusive disease. These data provide genetic  and cellular evidence of vascular inflammation in NF1 patients and Nf1+/- mice  and provide a framework for understanding the pathogenesis of NF1 vasculopathy  and potential therapeutic and diagnostic interventions.

Hawes JJ(1), Reilly KM.  Author information: (1)Mouse Cancer Genetics Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland  21702, USA.  Neurofibomatosis (NF1) patients are susceptible to multiple tumors of the  nervous system including neurofibromas, optic glioma, malignant peripheral nerve  sheath tumors (MPNSTs), and astrocytoma. The Nf1+/-;Trp53+/- (NPcis) mouse model  of NF1 spontaneously develops astrocytoma and MPNSTs that are very similar to  human NF1 tumors. To use this model for testing potential therapeutics, we have  developed systems that take advantage of bioluminescent reporters of tumor  growth. We have generated E2F1 promoter-driving luciferase (ELUX) reporter mice  to detect proliferating tumors in NPcis mice in vivo using bioluminescence. The  power of this system is that it enables looking at tumor evolution and detecting  spontaneous tumors at early stages of development as they evolve within their  natural haploinsufficient microenvironment. This system can be used to identify  tumors at different stages of tumorigenesis and to examine where spontaneous NF1  tumors initiate. The ability to rapidly screen multiple animals at a time  increases the potential for use of this model in preclinical trials. This model  will be valuable for the characterization of spontaneous NF1 tumors and will be  important for studying the treatment and prevention of NF1 tumors in vivo.

PMID:20181838,"The tumor suppressor merlin is required for cell cycle exit, terminal differentiation, and cell polarity in the developing murine lens.","The tumor suppressor merlin is required for cell cycle exit, terminal  differentiation, and cell polarity in the developing murine lens.  Wiley LA(1), Dattilo LK, Kang KB, Giovannini M, Beebe DC.  Author information: (1)Departments of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Washington University, St.  Louis, MO, USA.  PURPOSE. Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal-dominant CNS tumor  syndrome that affects 1:25,000 children and young adults. More than 50% of NF2  patients also develop posterior subcapsular cataracts (PSCs). The authors  deleted Nf2 from the lens to determine its role in fiber cell differentiation.  METHODS. Nf2 was conditionally deleted from murine lenses using the LeCre  transgene. Standard histology and immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent  methods were used to analyze lens morphology and markers of cell cycle  progression, differentiation, and cell junctions in wild-type and knockout  lenses from embryonic day 10.5 through postnatal day 3. RESULTS. Fiber cells  lacking Nf2 did not fully exit the cell cycle and continued to express  epithelial cell markers, such as FoxE3 and E-cadherin, despite expressing the  fiber cell marker Prox1. Many fiber cells lost their elongated morphology.  Markers of apical-basal polarity, such as ZO-1, were mislocalized along the  lateral and basal membranes of fiber cells. The lens vesicle failed to separate  from the surface ectoderm, and prospective lens and corneal epithelial cells  formed a multilayered mass of cells at the surface of the eye. Herniation of  this membrane caused the fiber mass to erupt through the cornea. CONCLUSIONS.  Nf2 is required for complete fiber cell terminal differentiation, maintenance of  cell polarity, and separation of lens vesicle from corneal epithelium. Defects  identified in fiber cell differentiation may explain the formation of PSCs in  patients with NF2. The lens provides an assay system to identify pathways  critical for fiber cell differentiation and to test therapies for the tumors  that occur in patients with NF2.

AIM: The World Health Organization's International Classification of  Functioning, Disability and Health adapted for children and young people  (ICF-CY) is a framework for describing and classifying health and health-related  states. The aim of the present study was to review literature on  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) using ICF-CY guidelines and to highlight findings  about the quality of life of children with NF1. METHOD: Electronic databases were searched to identify studies involving  children with NF1. Eligible studies were classified according to ICF-CY  categories. RESULTS: Children with NF1 have a variety of cognitive and other deficits.  However, very little information is available on the impact of these deficits on  their daily life. INTERPRETATION: Despite the broad range of functional and structural deficits in  children with NF1, the functional assessment of these children remains largely  unexplored. Future studies should aim at evaluating the participation of  children with NF1 in various situations, using tools with high real-world  validity.

Ahmad Z(1), Brown CM, Patel AK, Ryan AF, Ongkeko R, Doherty JK.  Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, Division of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,  University of California-San Diego, 3350 La Jolla Village Drive, San Diego, CA  92161, U.S.A.  HYPOTHESIS: To investigate the early events in molecular progression toward  schwannoma tumorigenesis, we developed an in vitro model of human Schwann cell  tumorigenesis by merlin knockdown. BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2)-related and sporadic vestibular schwannoma  (VS) exhibit loss of functional merlin (schwannomin). After loss of merlin  expression in the Schwann cell, the initial steps toward VS tumorigenesis are  unknown. Merlin, a putative tumor suppressor protein, interacts with many  cellular proteins, regulating their function. Among these are receptor tyrosine  kinases, including the epidermal growth factor receptor family B (ErbB) family  receptors epidermal growth factor receptor and ErbB2. Functional merlin  interacts with and internalizes these growth factor receptors, silencing their  proliferation and survival signaling. Deregulation of CD44, the cell  adhesion/signaling molecule and cancer stem cell marker, has also been  implicated in VS tumorigenesis. METHODS: Merlin knockdown was performed using small interfering RNA transfection  into human Schwann cell primary cultures. Knockdown was confirmed by real-time  quantitative PCR, immunofluorescence, and Western analysis. Expression profiles  of ErbB, merlin, and the stem cell markers nestin and CD44 were examined in  knockdowns. Proliferation rate was assessed with bromodeoxyuridine  incorporation, and radiation sensitivity was assessed using the Annexin assay in  knockdowns versus controls. RESULTS: Merlin knockdowns demonstrated increased proliferation rate,  upregulation of epidermal growth factor receptor, ErbB2, and ErbB3, CD44, and  nestin. Short-term merlin depletion had no effect on gamma irradiation  sensitivity compared with controls. CONCLUSION: Merlin depletion results in deregulation of ErbB receptor signaling,  promotes a dedifferentiated state, and increases Schwann cell proliferation,  suggesting critical steps toward schwannoma tumorigenesis.

PMID:20200958,Local low-dose lovastatin delivery improves the bone-healing defect caused by Nf1 loss of function in osteoblasts.,"Local low-dose lovastatin delivery improves the bone-healing defect caused by  Nf1 loss of function in osteoblasts.  Wang W(1), Nyman JS, Moss HE, Gutierrez G, Mundy GR, Yang X, Elefteriou F.  Author information: (1)Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Department of Medicine, Nashville, TN  37232-0575, USA.  Postfracture tibial nonunion (pseudoarthrosis) leads to lifelong disability in  patients with neurofibromatosis type I (NF1), a disorder caused by mutations in  the NF1 gene. To determine the contribution of NF1 in bone healing, we assessed  bone healing in the Nf1(ob) (-/-) conditional mouse model lacking Nf1  specifically in osteoblasts. A closed distal tibia fracture protocol and a  longitudinal study design were used. During the 21- to 28-day postfracture  period, callus volume, as expected, decreased in wild-type but not in Nf1(ob)  (-/-) mice, suggesting delayed healing. At these two time points, bone volume  (BV/TV) and volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) measured by 3D micro-computed  tomography were decreased in Nf1(ob) (-/-) callus-bridging cortices and  trabecular compartments compared with wild-type controls. Histomorphometric  analyses revealed the presence of cartilaginous remnants, a high amount of  osteoid, and increased osteoclast surfaces in Nf1(ob) (-/-) calluses 21 days  after fracture, which was accompanied by increased expression of osteopontin,  Rankl, and Tgfbeta. Callus strength measured by three-point bending 28 days  after fracture was reduced in Nf1(ob) (-/-) versus wild-type calluses.  Importantly, from a clinical point of view, this defect of callus maturation and  strength could be ameliorated by local delivery of low-dose lovastatin  microparticles, which successfully decreased osteoid volume and cartilaginous  remnant number and increased callus BV/TV and strength in mutant mice. These  results thus indicate that the dysfunctions caused by loss of Nf1 in osteoblasts  impair callus maturation and weaken callus mechanical properties and suggest  that local delivery of low-dose lovastatin may improve bone healing in NF1  patients.  2010 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

Silvestre DC(1), Gil GA, Tomasini N, Bussolino DF, Caputto BL.  Author information: (1)Departamento de Química Biológica, Facultad de Ciencias Químicas, CIQUIBIC,  Universidad Nacional de Córdoba, Córdoba, Argentina.  BACKGROUND: We have previously shown that the transcription factor c-Fos is also  capable of associating to endoplasmic reticulum membranes (ER) and activating  phospholipid synthesis. Herein we examined phospholipid synthesis status in  brain tumors from human patients and from NPcis mice, an animal model of the  human disease Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In human samples, c-Fos expression was at the limit of  detection in non-pathological specimens, but was abundantly expressed associated  to ER membranes in tumor cells. This was also observed in CNS of adult  tumor-bearing NPcis mice but not in NPcis fos(-/-) KO mice. A glioblastoma  multiforme and a malignant PNS tumor from a NF1 patient (MPNST) showed a 2- and  4- fold c-Fos-dependent phospholipid synthesis activation, respectively. MPNST  samples also showed increased cell proliferation rates and abundant c-Fos  expression. CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight a role of cytoplasmic c-Fos as an activator of  phospholipid synthesis in events demanding high rates of membrane biogenesis as  occurs for the exacerbated growth of tumors cells. They also disclose this  protein as a potential target for controlling tumor growth in the nervous  system.

Electronic address:  jkyriakis@tuftsmedicalcenter.org.  Many tumor suppressor proteins act to blunt the effects of mitogenic signaling  pathways. Loss of function mutations in the merlin tumor suppressor underlie  neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), a familial autosomal dominant cancer syndrome.  Studies of Drosophila suggest that Hippo (hpo) is required for inhibition of  cell proliferation mediated by dMer, the orthologue of human merlin. Mammalian  sterile 20-like kinase-2 (Mst2) is a mammalian Hpo orthologue, and numerous  studies implicate Mst2 as a tumor suppressor. Mst2 is negatively regulated by  the proto-oncoprotein Raf-1 in a manner independent of the kinase activity of  Raf-1. We sought to determine whether, in mammalian cells, merlin could  positively regulate Mst2. We also sought to determine whether Mst2, in addition  to being negatively regulated by Raf-1, might itself reciprocally regulate  Raf-1. In contrast to findings from Drosophila, we find no evidence that  mammalian merlin positively regulates mammalian Mst2. Instead, surprisingly, RNA  interference silencing of Mst2 leads to elevated inhibitory phosphorylation of  Raf-1 at Ser-259 and impaired Raf-1 kinase activity. Consequent to this, ERK  pathway activation and cell proliferation are attenuated. Phosphatase-2A (PP2A)  dephosphorylates Raf-1 Ser-259 in response to mitogens. Interestingly RNA  interference silencing of Mst2 triggers a striking proteasome-dependent decrease  in the levels of the catalytic subunit of PP2A (PP2A-C). A similar effect is  achieved upon silencing of large tumor suppressor (LATS)-1 and LATS2, direct  substrates of Mst2. Our studies reveal a more complex role for Mst2 than  previously thought. The Mst2 --> LATS1/2 pathway, by maintaining PP2A-C levels,  may, in some situations, positively affect mitogenic signaling.

Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143,  USA.  Monosomy 7 and del(7q) are associated with adverse features in myeloid  malignancies. A 2.5-Mb commonly deleted segment (CDS) of chromosome band 7q22 is  implicated as harboring a myeloid tumor suppressor gene (TSG); however,  molecular analysis of candidate TSGs has not uncovered loss of function. To  determine whether haploinsufficiency for the 7q22 CDS contributes to myeloid  leukemogenesis, we performed sequential gene targeting to flank a region of  orthologous synteny on mouse chromosome band 5A3 with loxP sites. We then  generated Mx1-Cre, 5A3(fl) mutant mice and deleted the targeted interval in  vivo. Although excision was inefficient, we confirmed somatic deletion of the  5A3 CDS in the hematopoietic stem cell compartment. Mx1-Cre, 5A3(fl) mice show  normal hematologic parameters and do not spontaneously develop myeloid  malignancies. The 5A3(fl) deletion does not cooperate with oncogenic Kras(G12D)  expression, Nf1 inactivation, or retroviral mutagenesis to accelerate leukemia  development and did not modulate responsiveness to antileukemia drugs. These  studies demonstrate that it is feasible to somatically delete a large  chromosomal segment implicated in tumor suppression in hematopoietic cell  populations in vivo; however, our data do not support the hypothesis that the  7q22/5A3 CDS interval contains a myeloid TSG.

Author information: (1)Department of Biochemistry, and Herman B. Wells Center for Pediatric  Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the most common genetic disorder with a  predisposition to malignancy and affects 1 in 3500 persons worldwide. NF1 is  caused by a mutation in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene that encodes the protein  neurofibromin. Patients with NF1 have cutaneous, diffuse, and plexiform  neurofibromas, tumors comprised primarily of Schwann cells, blood vessels,  fibroblasts, and mast cells. Studies from human and murine models that closely  recapitulate human plexiform neurofibroma formation indicate that tumorigenesis  necessitates NF1 loss of heterozygosity in the Schwann cell. In addition, our  most recent studies with bone marrow transplantation and pharmacologic  experiments implicate haploinsufficiency of Nf1 (Nf1(+/-)) and c-kit signaling  in the hematopoietic system as required and sufficient for tumor progression.  Here, we review recent studies implicating the hematopoietic system in plexiform  neurofibroma genesis, delineate the physiology of stem cell factor-dependent  hematopoietic cells and their contribution to the neurofibroma microenvironment,  and highlight the application of this research toward the first successful,  targeted medical treatment of a patient with a nonresectable and debilitating  neurofibroma. Finally, we emphasize the importance of the tumor microenvironment  hypothesis, asserting that tumorigenic cells in the neurofibroma do not arise  and grow in isolation.

Yi C(1), Maksimoska J, Marmorstein R, Kissil JL.  Author information: (1)Molecular and Cellular Oncogenesis Program, The Wistar Institute, 3601 Spruce  St., Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.  The p21-activated kinases (PAKs), immediate downstream effectors of the small  G-proteins of the Rac/cdc42 family, are critical mediators of signaling pathways  regulating cellular behaviors and as such, have been implicated in pathological  conditions including cancer. Recent studies have validated the requirement for  PAKs in promoting tumorigenesis in breast carcinoma and neurofibromatosis. Thus,  there has been considerable interest in the development of inhibitors to the  PAKs, as biological markers and leads for the development of therapeutics. While  initial approaches were based on screening for competitive organic inhibitors,  more recent efforts have focused on the identification of allosteric inhibitors,  organometallic ATP-competitive inhibitors and the use of PAK1/inhibitor crystal  structures for inhibitor optimization. This has led to the identification of  highly selective and potent inhibitors, which will serve as a basis for further  development of inhibitors for therapeutic applications.

Shilyansky C(1), Lee YS, Silva AJ.  Author information: (1)Department of Neurobiology, Psychology, Psychiatry and Biobehavioral  Sciences, Semel Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, California  90095, USA.  Neurofibromatosis Type I (NF1) is a single-gene disorder characterized by a high  incidence of complex cognitive symptoms, including learning disabilities,  attention deficit disorder, executive function deficits, and motor coordination  problems. Because the underlying genetic cause of this disorder is known, study  of NF1 from a molecular, cellular, and systems perspective has provided  mechanistic insights into the etiology of higher-order cognitive symptoms  associated with the disease. In particular, studies of animal models of NF1  indicated that disruption of Ras regulation of inhibitory networks is critical  to the etiology of cognitive deficits associated with NF1. Animal models of Nf1  identified mechanisms and pathways that are required for cognition, and  represent an important complement to the complex neuropsychological literature  on learning disabilities associated with this condition. Here, we review  findings from NF1 animal models and human populations affected by NF1,  highlighting areas of potential translation and discussing the implications and  limitations of generalizing findings from this single-gene disease to idiopathic  learning disabilities.

Benseñor LB(1), Barlan K, Rice SE, Fehon RG, Gelfand VI.  Author information: (1)Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Northwestern University Feinberg  School of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.  The neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) tumor-suppressor protein Merlin is a member  of the ERM family of proteins that links the cytoskeleton to the plasma  membrane. In humans, mutations in the NF2 gene cause neurofibromatosis type-2  (NF2), a cancer syndrome characterized by the development of tumors of the  nervous system. Previous reports have suggested that the subcellular  distribution of Merlin is critical to its function, and that several NF2 mutants  that lack tumor-suppressor activity present improper localization. Here we used  a Drosophila cell culture model to study the distribution and mechanism of  intracellular transport of Merlin and its mutants. We found that Drosophila  Merlin formed cytoplasmic particles that move bidirectionally along  microtubules. A single NF2-causing amino acid substitution in the FERM domain  dramatically inhibited Merlin particle movement. Surprisingly, the presence of  this immotile Merlin mutant also inhibited trafficking of the WT protein.  Analysis of the movement of WT protein using RNAi and pull-downs showed that  Merlin particles are associated with and moved by microtubule motors (kinesin-1  and cytoplasmic dynein), and that binding of motors and movement is regulated by  Merlin phosphorylation. Inhibition of Merlin transport by expression of the  dominant-negative mutant or depletion of kinesin-1 results in increased nuclear  accumulation of the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie.

Author information: (1)Molecular and Integrative Neuroscience Department, The Scripps Research  Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.  Adaptations in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) have been implicated in  alcohol and drug addiction. To identify genes that may contribute to excessive  drinking, here we performed microarray analyses in laser microdissected rat ACC  after a single or repeated administration of an intoxicating dose of alcohol (3  g/kg). Expression of the small G protein K-ras was differentially regulated  following both single and repeated alcohol administration. We also observed that  voluntary alcohol intake in K-ras heterozygous null mice (K-ras(+/-)) did not  increase after withdrawal from repeated cycles of intermittent ethanol vapor  exposure, unlike in their wild-type littermates. To identify K-ras regulated  pathways, we then profiled gene expression in the ACC of K-ras(+/-),  heterozygous null mice for the K-ras negative regulator Nf1 (Nf1(+/-)) and  wild-type mice following repeated administration of an intoxicating dose of  alcohol. Pathway analysis showed that alcohol differentially affected various  pathways in a K-ras dependent manner - some of which previously shown to be  regulated by alcohol - including the insulin/PI3K pathway, the NF-kappaB, the  phosphodiesterases (PDEs) pathway, the Jak/Stat and the adipokine signaling  pathways. Altogether, the data implicate K-ras-regulated pathways in the  regulation of excessive alcohol drinking after a history of dependence.  Copyright 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Author information: (1)Department of Radiation Oncology, Steele Laboratory, Massachusetts General  Hospital Cancer Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.  Patients with bilateral vestibular schwannomas associated with neurofibromatosis  type 2 (NF2) experience significant morbidity such as complete hearing loss. We  have recently shown that treatment with bevacizumab provided tumor stabilization  and hearing recovery in a subset of NF2 patients with progressive disease. In  the current study, we used two animal models to identify the mechanism of action  of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy in schwannomas. The  human HEI193 and murine Nf2(-/-) cell lines were implanted between the pia and  arachnoid meninges as well as in the sciatic nerve to mimic central and  peripheral schwannomas. Mice were treated with bevacizumab (10 mg/kg/wk i.v.) or  vandetanib (50 mg/kg/d orally) to block the VEGF pathway. Using intravital and  confocal microscopy, together with whole-body imaging, we measured tumor growth  delay, survival rate, as well as blood vessel structure and function at regular  intervals. In both models, tumor vessel diameter, length/surface area density,  and permeability were significantly reduced after treatment. After 2 weeks of  treatment, necrosis in HEI193 tumors and apoptosis in Nf2(-/-) tumors were  significantly increased, and the tumor growth rate decreased by an average of  50%. The survival of mice bearing intracranial schwannomas was extended by at  least 50%. This study shows that anti-VEGF therapy normalizes the vasculature of  schwannoma xenografts in nude mice and successfully controls the tumor growth,  probably by reestablishing a natural balance between VEGF and semaphorin 3  signaling.

Brown JA(1), Gianino SM, Gutmann DH.  Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis,  Missouri 63110, USA.  Individuals with the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) inherited cancer syndrome  exhibit neuronal dysfunction that predominantly affects the CNS. In this report,  we demonstrate a unique vulnerability of CNS neurons, but not peripheral nervous  system (PNS) neurons, to reduced Nf1 gene expression. Unlike dorsal root  ganglion neurons, Nf1 heterozygous (Nf1+/-) hippocampal and retinal ganglion  cell (RGC) neurons have decreased growth cone areas and neurite lengths, and  increased apoptosis compared to their wild-type counterparts. These abnormal  Nf1+/- CNS neuronal phenotypes do not reflect Ras pathway hyperactivation, but  rather result from impaired neurofibromin-mediated cAMP generation. In this  regard, elevating cAMP levels with forskolin or rolipram treatment, but not MEK  (MAP kinase kinase) or PI3-K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) inhibition,  reverses these abnormalities to wild-type levels in vitro. In addition, Nf1+/-  CNS, but not PNS, neurons exhibit increased apoptosis in response to excitotoxic  or oxidative stress in vitro. Since children with NF1-associated optic gliomas  often develop visual loss and Nf1 genetically engineered mice with optic glioma  exhibit RGC neuronal apoptosis in vivo, we further demonstrate that RGC  apoptosis resulting from optic glioma in Nf1 genetically engineered mice is  attenuated by rolipram treatment in vivo. Similar to optic glioma-induced RGC  apoptosis, the increased RGC neuronal death in Nf1+/- mice after optic nerve  crush injury is also attenuated by rolipram treatment in vivo. Together, these  findings establish a distinctive role for neurofibromin in CNS neurons with  respect to vulnerability to injury, define a CNS-specific neurofibromin  intracellular signaling pathway responsible for neuronal survival, and lay the  foundation for future neuroprotective glioma treatment approaches.

Internal  neurofibromas are associated with increased morbidity and mortality through  malignant transformation and compression of neighboring organs. Our purpose was  to develop and to validate a clinical score for predicting internal  neurofibromas in adults. The development sample comprised 208 patients and the  validation sample 191 patients. The score was developed using logistic  regression. Discrimination and calibration of the model were evaluated. Four  variables were independently associated with internal neurofibromas: at least  two subcutaneous neurofibromas (odds ratio (OR)=4.7, [2.1-10.5]), age < or =30  years (OR=3.1, [1.4-6.8]), absence of cutaneous neurofibromas (OR=2.6,  [0.9-7.5]), and fewer than six café-au-lait spots (OR=2.0 [0.9-4.6]). The score  computed by linear combination of the rounded coefficients of these four  variables ranged from 0 to 40 (mean, 12.8+/-10.8). The probability of internal  neurofibromas was computed as exp (-2.93+0.11Score)/exp (1+(-2.93+0.11Score)).  Probabilities agreed well with the observed frequencies indicating good  calibration, and discrimination was adequate (AUC-ROC, 0.75) in both data sets.  The presence of internal neurofibromas can be accurately predicted using a  simple clinical score. Further work will establish the score threshold that  identifies patients at high risk for complications.

Author information: (1)Department of Pharmacology, University of Virginia School of Medicine,  Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.  The Ras family GTPases (Ras, Rap1, and Rap2) and their downstream  mitogen-activated protein kinases (ERK, JNK, and p38MAPK) and PI3K signaling  cascades control various physiological processes. In neuronal cells, recent  studies have shown that these parallel cascades signal distinct forms of  AMPA-sensitive glutamate receptor trafficking during experience-dependent  synaptic plasticity and adaptive behavior. Interestingly, both hypo- and  hyperactivation of Ras/ Rap signaling impair the capacity of synaptic  plasticity, underscoring the importance of a ""happy-medium"" dynamic regulation  of the signaling. Moreover, accumulating reports have linked various genetic  defects that either up- or down-regulate Ras/Rap signaling with several mental  disorders associated with learning disability (e.g., Alzheimer's disease,  Angelman syndrome, autism, cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome, Coffin-Lowry  syndrome, Costello syndrome, Cowden and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndromes,  fragile X syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1, Noonan syndrome, schizophrenia,  tuberous sclerosis, and X-linked mental retardation), highlighting the necessity  of happy-medium dynamic regulation of Ras/Rap signaling in learning behavior.  Thus, the recent advances in understanding of neuronal Ras/Rap signaling provide  a useful guide for developing novel treatments for mental diseases.

Stamenkovic I(1), Yu Q.  Author information: (1)Department of Oncological Sciences, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York,  NY10029, USA.  Genetic alterations of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) gene lead to the  development of schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas. Mutations of NF2 gene  were also found in thyroid cancer, mesothelioma, and melanoma, suggesting that  it functions as a tumor suppressor in a wide spectrum of cells. The product of  NF2 gene is merlin (moesin-ezrin-radixin-like protein), a member of the Band 4.1  superfamily proteins. Merlin shares significant sequence homology with the ERM  (Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin) family proteins and serves as a linker between  transmembrane proteins and the actin-cytoskeleton. Merlin is a multifunctional  protein and involved in integrating and regulating the extracellular cues and  intracellular signaling pathways that control cell fate, shape, proliferation,  survival, and motility. Recent studies showed that merlin regulates the  cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions and functions of the cell surface  adhesion/extracellular matrix receptors including CD44 and that merlin and CD44  antagonize each other's function and work upstream of the mammalian Hippo  signaling pathway. Furthermore, merlin plays important roles in stabilizing the  contact inhibition of proliferation and in regulating activities of several  receptor tyrosine kinases. Accumulating data also suggested an emerging role of  merlin as a negative regulator of growth and progression of several non-NF2  associated cancer types. Together, these recent advances have improved our basic  understanding about merlin function, its regulation, and the major signaling  pathways regulated by merlin and provided the foundation for future translation  of these findings into the clinic for patients bearing the cancers in which  merlin function and/or its downstream signaling pathways are impaired or  altered.

Author information: (1)Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and NYU Cancer Institute,  Hassenfeld Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, 160 East 32nd  Street, 2nd Floor, New York, NY 10016, USA.  Vestibular schwannomas (VS) arising sporadically or in patients with  neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) consistently lack expression of Merlin, a tumor  suppressor. Conventional treatment options include surgery and radiotherapy but  there is no validated medical option. Recent evidence suggests that Merlin  deficiency may result in abnormal activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)  and downstream signaling, promoting tumor growth. Although small-molecule RTK  inhibitors are widely available for clinical use, no such therapy has been  validated in patients with VS. To screen for RTK activation, surgical VS  specimens from patients with and without NF2 were analyzed by phospho-RTK  profiling arrays. Downstream signaling pathway activation was analyzed by  phospho-MAPK arrays. Activated RTKs and downstream kinases were validated  immunohistochemically in corresponding formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded  tissues. Phospho-RTK arrays and immunohistochemistry showed consistent  overexpression and activation of EGFR family receptors and evidence of ERK1/2  downstream signaling was observed in all samples analyzed (n = 11). Based on the  findings, the small-molecule EGFR/ErbB2 kinase inhibitor lapatinib was selected  for evaluation of target inhibition and treatment efficacy in our in vitro human  schwannoma model. EGFR/ErbB2 targeted therapy with lapatinib inhibited ErbB2  phosphorylation and survivin upregulation, as well as downstream ERK1/2 and AKT  activation, resulting in decreased proliferation. We conclude that EGFR family  receptor activation is a consistent feature of both sporadic and NF2-related VS.  Molecular targeted therapy with lapatinib downregulates survivin and has  antiproliferative activity in a preclinical VS model. Based on these findings, a  clinical trial with lapatinib for the treatment of VS is currently underway.

Author information: (1)Maine Institute for Human Genetics & Health, Bangor, Maine.  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are frequently deregulated in human tumors, and play  important roles in tumor development and progression. The pathological roles of  miRNAs in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) tumorigenesis are largely unknown. We  demonstrated that miR-10b was up-regulated in primary Schwann cells isolated  from NF1 neurofibromas and in cell lines and tumor tissues from malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). Intriguingly, a significantly high  level of miR-10b correlated with low neurofibromin expression was found in a  neuroectodermal cell line: Ewing's sarcoma SK-ES-1 cells. Antisense inhibiting  miR-10b in NF1 MPNST cells reduced cell proliferation, migration and invasion.  Furthermore, we showed that NF1 mRNA was the target for miR-10b. Overexpression  of miR-10b in 293T cells suppressed neurofibromin expression and activated RAS  signaling. Antisense inhibition of miR-10b restored neurofibromin expression in  SK-ES-1 cells, and decreased RAS signaling independent of neurofibromin in NF1  MPNST cells. These results suggest that miR-10b may play an important role in  NF1 tumorigenesis through targeting neurofibromin and RAS signaling.  © 2010 Japanese Cancer Association.

Warrington NM(1), Gianino SM, Jackson E, Goldhoff P, Garbow JR, Piwnica-Worms D,  Gutmann DH, Rubin JB.  Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, Molecular Imaging Center, Mallinckrodt Institute of  Radiology, Developmental Biology, and Anatomy and Neurobiology, Washington  University School of Medicine and St Louis Children's Hospital, St Louis,  Missouri 63110, USA.  Current models of oncogenesis incorporate the contributions of chronic  inflammation and aging to the patterns of tumor formation. These oncogenic  pathways, involving leukocytes and fibroblasts, are not readily applicable to  brain tumors (glioma), and other mechanisms must account for microenvironmental  influences on central nervous system tumorigenesis. Previous studies from our  laboratories have used neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) genetically engineered mouse  (GEM) models to understand the spatial restriction of glioma formation to the  optic pathway of young children. Based on our initial findings, we hypothesize  that brain region-specific differences in cAMP levels account for the pattern of  NF1 gliomagenesis. To provide evidence that low levels of cAMP promote glioma  formation in NF1, we generated foci of decreased cAMP in brain regions where  gliomas rarely form in children with NF1. Focal cAMP reduction was achieved by  forced expression of phosphodiesterase 4A1 (PDE4A1) in the cortex of Nf1 GEM  strains. Ectopic PDE4A1 expression produced hypercellular lesions with features  of human NF1-associated glioma. Conversely, pharmacologic elevation of cAMP with  the PDE4 inhibitor rolipram dramatically inhibited optic glioma growth and tumor  size in Nf1 GEM in vivo. Together, these results indicate that low levels of  cAMP in a susceptible Nf1 mouse strain are sufficient to promote gliomagenesis,  and justify the implementation of cAMP-based stroma-targeted therapies for  glioma.

Tumorigenesis requires interactions between tumor progenitors and their  microenvironment. We found that low cAMP levels were sufficient for  tumorigenesis in a mouse model of Neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1)-associated optic  pathway glioma (OPG). We hypothesized that the distinct pattern of glioma in NF1  reflected spatiotemporal differences in CXCL12 effects on cAMP levels. Thus, we  sought to alter the pattern of gliomagenesis through manipulation of  CXCL12-CXCR4 pathway activation in Nf1 OPG mice. Forced CXCL12 expression  induced glioma at a low frequency. Further, treatment of Nf1 OPG mice with  AMD3100, a CXCR4 antagonist, did not attenuate glioma growth. Thus, it appears,  CXCL12 alone cannot promote gliomagenesis in NF1 mice.

Staser K(1), Yang FC, Clapp DW.  Author information: (1)Department of Biochemistry, Indiana University School of Medicine,  Indianapolis, Indiana 46202, USA.  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Tumorigenic cells can co-opt normal functions of nonmalignant  hematopoietic cells, promoting tumor progression. Recent mouse and human studies  indicate that mast cells underpin inflammation in the plexiform neurofibroma  microenvironment of neurofibromatosis type 1. In this model, Nf1  homozygous-deficient Schwann cells recruit hyperactive mast cells, promoting  tumorigenesis. Here, we discuss the importance of Nf1 gene dosage, delineate  hematopoietic contributions to the plexiform neurofibroma microenvironment, and  highlight applications to human treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: Previous studies found that plexiform neurofibroma formation in  a mouse model requires biallelic loss of Nf1 in Schwann cells and an Nf1  heterozygous cellular background. Now, transplantation and pharmacological  experiments have indicated that tumor formation specifically requires Nf1  heterozygosity of c-kit-dependent bone marrow. SUMMARY: Neurofibromatosis type 1 results from autosomal dominant mutations of  the NF1 tumor suppressor gene. Although unpredictable second-hit mutations in  the remaining NF1 allele precede local manifestations such as tumor formation,  human and mouse data indicate that NF1/Nf1 gene haploinsufficiency modulates  cellular physiology and disease pathogeneses. In particular, Nf1 haplo  insufficient mast cells demonstrate multiple gain-in-functions, and mast cells  permeate neurofibroma tissue. Transplantation experiments have shown that these  aberrant mast cells critically underpin the tumor microenvironment. Using these  findings, clinicians have medically treated a patient with a debilitating  plexiform neurofibroma.

Author information: (1)Center for Research in Biological Systems, National Center for Microscopy and  Imaging Research and Department of Neurosciences, University of California San  Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.  The purpose of this study was to investigate the progression of changes in  retinal ganglion cells and optic nerve glia in neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1)  genetically-engineered mice with optic glioma. Optic glioma tumors were  generated in Nf1+/- mice lacking Nf1 expression in GFAP+ cells (astrocytes).  Standard immunohistochemistry methods were employed to identify astrocytes  (GFAP, S100beta), proliferating progenitor cells (sox2, nestin), microglia  (Iba1), endothelial cells (CD31) and retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons  (Neurofilament 68k) in Nf1+/-, Nf1(GFAP)CKO (wild-type mice with Nf1 loss in  glial cells), and Nf1+/-(GFAP)CKO (Nf1+/- mice with Nf1 loss in glial cells)  mice. Ultrastructural changes in the optic chiasm and nerve were assessed by  electron microscopy (EM). RGC were counted in whole retina preparations using  high-resolution, mosaic confocal microscopy following their delineation by  retrograde FluoroGold labeling. We found that only Nf1+/-(GFAP)CKO mice  exhibited gross pre-chiasmatic optic nerve and chiasm enlargements containing  aggregated GFAP+/nestin+ and S100beta+/sox2+ cells (neoplastic glia) as well as  increased numbers of blood vessels and microglia. Optic gliomas in  Nf1+/-(GFAP)CKO mice contained axon fiber irregularities and multilamellar  bodies of degenerated myelin. EM and EM tomographic analyses showed increased  glial disorganization, disoriented axonal projections, profiles of degenerating  myelin and structural alterations at nodes of Ranvier. Lastly, we found reduced  RGC numbers in Nf1+/-(GFAP)CKO mice, supporting a model in which the combination  of optic nerve Nf1 heterozygosity and glial cell Nf1 loss results in disrupted  axonal-glial relationships, subsequently culminating in the degeneration of  optic nerve axons and loss of their parent RGC neurons.

Riddle ND(1), Gorden L, Rojiani MV, Hakam A, Rojiani AM.  Author information: (1)Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, University of South Florida, Tampa,  FL 33610, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) provides a unique system to evaluate the complete  range of neoplastic expressions, from encapsulated benignity to invasiveness and  malignancy. This study was aimed at determining whether CD44 and p53 may serve  as indicators of malignant progression of neurofibroma. CD44, a transmembrane  glycoprotein receptor for hyaluronic acid, and participates in  cell-extracellular matrix interactions and migration. CD44 may play a vital  role, either through under or overexpression, with invasion and metastases of  tumors, altering their ability to infiltrate the adjacent tissue. The tumor  suppressor gene, p53, has also been implicated in malignant progression of  various human tumors including malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST).  A total of 44 tumors from 33 patients with NF1 were evaluated with an anti-human  CD44H, CD44 splice variant v6 and anti-p53 monoclonal antibodies. Morphologic  expression patterns of expression were evaluated for CD44 while semiquantitative  criteria were applied to assess, p53 nuclear positivity. Immunoexpression of p53  was markedly higher in 12 of 16 MPNST (75%). Thirteen of 28 (46%) benign  neurofibroma also had some expression of p53 above 'normal level', although much  lower than the MPNST. Plexiform neurofibroma did not differ from other benign  lesions in their expression of p53. Our results suggest that p53 mutation as  evidenced by immunohistochemical overexpression is a factor in malignant  transformation and progression of neurofibroma. 70% of benign neurofibroma  demonstrated some, usually focal, CD44 positivity. The pattern of CD44  expression in plexiform neurofibroma was revealing, as it was maximal in the  'nonencapsulated' portions of the tumors. Eight of 11 (72%) locally infiltrative  cutaneous neurofibroma and 13 of 16 (81%) MPNST exhibited diffuse CD44  positivity. CD44v6 expression was positive in control tissues but was not  identified in any of tumor samples. Also, within the confines of encapsulated  tumors CD44 expression is limited, while in poorly circumscribed neurofibroma  CD44 expression is upregulated. This is interpreted as a reflection of the  interaction of CD44+ tumor cells with extracellular matrix, hence facilitating  infiltrative behavior.

Author information: (1)Department of Neurobiology, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095,  USA.  Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is one of the most common single-gene causes of  learning disabilities. Here, we use behavioral working memory probes and  electrophysiological studies in a mouse model of NF1 (Nf1 heterozygous null  mutants; Nf1(+/-)) to demonstrate that (i) Neurofibromin regulates prefrontal  and striatal inhibitory networks, specifically activity-dependent GABA release  and (ii) is required for working memory performance, with inhibition-dependent  working memory deficits seen in Nf1(+/-) mice. We find that increased inhibition  in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is sufficient to alter persistent activity in  a biophysical model of an mPFC microcircuit, suggesting a possible mechanism for  Nf1(+/-) working memory deficits. Accordingly, working memory assays applied  during functional MRI (fMRI) studies in human subjects with NF1 reveal  hypoactivation of corticostriatal networks, which is associated with impaired  working memory performance. Collectively, these integrative mouse and human  studies reveal molecular and cellular mechanisms contributing to working memory  deficits in NF1.

While a core kinase cascade leading from the protein kinase Hippo (Hpo)  (Mst1 and Mst2 in mammals) to the transcription coactivator Yorkie (Yki) (YAP in  mammals) has been established, upstream regulators of the Hippo kinase cascade  are less well defined, especially in mammals. Using conditional knockout mice,  we demonstrate that the Merlin/NF2 tumor suppressor and the YAP oncoprotein  function antagonistically to regulate liver development. While inactivation of  Yap led to loss of hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells, inactivation of Nf2  led to hepatocellular carcinoma and bile duct hamartoma. Strikingly, the  Nf2-deficient phenotypes in multiple tissues were largely suppressed by  heterozygous deletion of Yap, suggesting that YAP is a major effector of  Merlin/NF2 in growth regulation. Our studies link Merlin/NF2 to mammalian Hippo  signaling and implicate YAP activation as a mediator of pathologies relevant to  Neurofibromatosis 2.  (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

PMID:20668197,A distinct set of Drosophila brain neurons required for neurofibromatosis type 1-dependent learning and memory.,"A distinct set of Drosophila brain neurons required for neurofibromatosis type  1-dependent learning and memory.  Buchanan ME(1), Davis RL.  Author information: (1)Department of Molecular and Human Genetics and Molecular and Cellular  Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.  Nonspecific cognitive impairments are one of the many manifestations of  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). A learning phenotype is also present in  Drosophila melanogaster that lack a functional neurofibromin gene (nf1).  Multiple studies have indicated that Nf1-dependent learning in Drosophila  involves the cAMP pathway, including the demonstration of a genetic interaction  between Nf1 and the rutabaga-encoded adenylyl cyclase (Rut-AC). Olfactory  classical conditioning experiments have previously demonstrated a requirement  for Rut-AC activity and downstream cAMP pathway signaling in neurons of the  mushroom bodies. However, Nf1 expression in adult mushroom body neurons has not  been observed. Here, we address this discrepancy by demonstrating (1) that  Rut-AC is required for the acquisition and stability of olfactory memories,  whereas Nf1 is only required for acquisition, (2) that expression of nf1 RNA can  be detected in the cell bodies of mushroom body neurons, and (3) that expression  of an nf1 transgene only in the alpha/beta subset of mushroom body neurons is  sufficient to restore both protein synthesis-independent and protein  synthesis-dependent memory. Our observations indicate that memory-related  functions of Rut-AC are both Nf1-dependent and -independent, that Nf1 mediates  the formation of two distinct memory components within a single neuron  population, and that our understanding of Nf1 function in memory processes may  be dissected from its role in other brain functions by specifically studying the  alpha/beta mushroom body neurons.

Author information: (1)Institute of Age Research, Fritz Lipmann Institute, Beutenbergstrasse 11,  Jena, Germany.  The neurofibromatosis type 2 gene product merlin is known to provoke gliogenic  tumors as a result of its mutagenic loss. Merlin's physiological anti-mitogenic  function makes it unique among its ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) family members.  Although ERM proteins and merlin are known to be expressed in glial cells of the  peripheral nervous system and CNS, the neuronal expression pattern and function  of merlin have been less well investigated. We report here expression of merlin  in developing and mature neurons of the murine CNS. Within cerebellar Purkinje  cells (PCs), merlin was localized in the soma, sprouting dendrites and axons.  Merlin expression in PCs was high during the period of initial dendrite  regression and declined during later phases of dendrite elongation.  Consistently, merlin expression in vivo was increased in  Engrailed-2-overexpressing PCs, which are characterized by a reduced dendritic  extension. Furthermore, overexpression of merlin in dissociated cerebellar  cultures and in neurogenic P19 cells caused a significant decline in neurite  outgrowth, while, conversely, inhibition of merlin expression increased process  formation. This effect was dependent on phosphorylation of serine 518 and  involved the inactivation of the growth-promoting GTPase Rac. We thus provide  evidence that merlin plays a pivotal role in controlling the neuronal wiring in  the developing CNS.

PMID:20680410,The role of neurofibromin in N-Ras mediated AP-1 regulation in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.,"The role of neurofibromin in N-Ras mediated AP-1 regulation in malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumors.  Kraniak JM(1), Sun D, Mattingly RR, Reiners JJ Jr, Tainsky MA.  Author information: (1)Programs in Molecular Biology and Genetics, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer  Institute, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.  Plexiform neurofibromas commonly found in patients with Neurofibromatosis type I  (NF1) have a 5% risk of being transformed into malignant peripheral nerve sheath  tumors (MPNST). Germline mutations in the NF1 gene coding for neurofibromin,  which is a Ras GTPase activating protein (RasGAP) and a negative regulator of  Ras, result in an upregulation of the Ras pathway. We established a direct  connection between neurofibromin deficiency and downstream effectors of Ras in  cell lines from MPNST patients by demonstrating that knockdown of NF1 expression  using siRNA in a NF1 wild type MPNST cell line, STS-26T, activates the  Ras/ERK1,2 pathway and increases AP-1 binding and activity. We believe this is  the first time the transactivation of AP-1 has been linked directly to  neurofibromin deficiency in a disease relevant MPNST cell line. Previously, we  have shown that N-Ras is constitutively activated in cell lines derived from  independent MPNSTs from NF1 patients. We therefore sought to analyze the role of  the N-Ras pathway in deregulating AP-1 transcriptional activity. We show that  STS-26T clones conditionally expressing oncogenic N-Ras show increased  phosphorylated ERK1,2 and phosphorylated JNK expression concomitant with  increased AP-1 activity. MAP kinase pathways (ERK1,2 and JNK) were further  examined in ST88-14, a neurofibromin-deficient MPNST cell line. The basal  activity of ERK1,2 but not JNK was found to increase AP-1 activity. These  experiments further confirmed the link between the loss of neurofibromin and  increased activity of Ras/MAP kinase pathways and the activation of downstream  transcriptional mechanisms in MPNSTs from NF1 patients.

Zietsch J(1), Ziegenhagen N, Heppner FL, Reuss D, von Deimling A, Holtkamp N.  Author information: (1)Department of Neuropathology, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin,  Germany.  BACKGROUND: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are highly  aggressive tumors which originate from Schwann cells and develop in about 10% of  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients. The five year survival rate is poor and  more effective therapies are needed. Sunitinib is a drug targeting receptor  tyrosine kinases (RTK) like PDGFRalpha, c-Kit and VEGFR-2. These genes are  structurally related and cluster on chromosomal segment 4q12. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we characterize this region by multiplex  ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) in MPNST. Our probe set  encompasses the 3 adjacent RTK genes (PDGFRA, KIT, KDR) and 6 flanking genes. We  found amplification of several genes within this region in a subset of MPNST and  MPNST cell lines. Transcript and protein expression of PDGFRA matched well with  its increased copy number suggesting a central role of PDGFRA within the  amplicon. Studying the effect of sunitinib on 5 MPNST cell lines revealed that  cell line S462 harboring the 4q12 amplicon was extremely sensitive to the drug  with an IC50 below 1.0 microM. Moreover, sunitinib induced apoptosis and  prevented PDGF-AA induced signaling via PDGFRalpha as determined by western  blotting. Co-expression of VEGF and its receptor VEGFR-2 (KDR) was present in  MPNST cell lines suggesting an autocrine loop. We show that VEGF triggered  signal transduction via the MAPK pathway, which could be blocked by sunitinib. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Since multiple receptors targeted by sunitinib are  expressed or over-expressed by MPNST cells sunitinib appears as an attractive  drug for treatment of MPNST patients. Presence of the 4q12 amplicon and  subsequent over-expression of PDGFRA might serve as predictive markers for  efficacy of sunitinib.

The neurofibroma, a common feature of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), is a  benign peripheral nerve sheath tumor that contains predominantly Schwann cells  (SC). There are reports that neurofibroma growth may be affected by hormonal  changes, particularly in puberty and pregnancy, suggesting an influence by  steroid hormones. This study examined the effects of estrogen and progesterone  on proliferation and apoptosis in a panel of NF1 tumor xenografts. SC-enriched  cultures derived from three human NF1 tumor types (dermal neurofibroma,  plexiform neurofibroma, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST))  were xenografted in sciatic nerves of ovariectomized scid /Nf1-/+ mice. At the  same time, mice were implanted with time-release pellets for systemic delivery  of progesterone, estrogen or placebo. Proliferation and apoptosis by the  xenografted SC were examined two months after implantation, by Ki67  immunolabeling and TUNEL. Estrogen was found to increase the growth of all three  MPNST xenografts. Progesterone was associated with increased growth in two of  the three MPNSTs, yet decreased growth of the other. Of the four dermal  neurofibroma xenografts tested, estrogen caused a statistically significant  growth increase in one, and progesterone did in another. Of the four plexiform  neurofibroma SC xenografts, estrogen and progesterone significantly decreased  growth in one of the xenografts, but not the other three. No relationship of  patient age or gender to steroid response was observed. These findings indicate  that human NF1 Schwann cells derived from some tumors show increased  proliferation or decreased apoptosis in response to particular steroid hormones  in a mouse xenograft model. This suggests that anti-estrogen or  anti-progesterone therapies may be worth considering for specific NF1  neurofibromas and MPNSTs.

Author information: (1)Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's  Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio 45229, USA.  PURPOSE: Plexiform neurofibromas (pNF) are Schwann cell tumors found in a third  of individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). pNF can undergo  transformation to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). There are no  identified serum biomarkers of pNF tumor burden or transformation to MPNST.  Serum biomarkers would be useful to verify NF1 diagnosis, monitor tumor burden,  and/or detect transformation. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used microarray gene expression analysis to define 92  genes that encode putative secreted proteins in neurofibroma Schwann cells,  neurofibromas, and MPNST. We validated differential expression by quantitative  reverse transcription-PCR, Western blotting, and ELISA assays in cell  conditioned medium and control and NF1 patient sera. RESULTS: Of 13 candidate genes evaluated, only adrenomedullin (ADM) was  confirmed as differentially expressed and elevated in serum of NF1 patients. ADM  protein concentrati on was further elevated in serum of a small sampling of NF1  patients with MPNST. MPNST cell conditioned medium, containing ADM and  hepatocyte growth factor, stimulated MPNST migration and endothelial cell  proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, microarray analysis identifies potential serum biomarkers for  disease, and ADM is a serum biomarker of NF1. ADM serum levels do not seem to  correlate with the presence of pNFs but may be a biomarker of transformation to  MPNST.  ©2010 AACR.

Author information: (1)Faculty of Medicine, 2nd Department of Medicine, Semmelweis University,  Budapest, Hungary.  MicroRNAs are involved in the pathogenesis of several tumors, however, there  have been no data on microRNA expression in pheochromocytomas to date. The  objective of our study was to perform microRNA expression profiling in sporadic  and hereditary benign, and recurring adrenomedullary tumors. Furthermore, the  applicability of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples for the  analysis of microRNA expression in pheochromocytomas was examined. MicroRNA  expression data of three matched frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  samples were correlated. A total of 21 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples  (sporadic benign, multiple endocrine neoplasia 2, von Hippel-Lindau disease,  sporadic recurring) were subjected to microRNA expression profiling using  microarrays. MicroRNAs with significant differences in expression were validated  and sample sizes were extended including tumors from neurofibromatosis type 1  patients by real-time quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (n=33). MicroRNA  target prediction was carried out by TargetScan and MicroCosm Targets. Pathway  analysis of targets was performed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and DIANA  mirPath. Furthermore, microRNA expression profiles of a malignant  pheochromocytoma and a pair of primary and recurrent tumors were studied by  TaqMan Human MicroRNA Cards. MicroRNA expression correlated well between frozen  and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples (70-92%). Microarray analysis  revealed 16 significantly differentially expressed microRNAs. Five of these were  validated by real-time RT-PCR. miR-139-3p, miR-541 and miR-765 were  significantly differentially expressed between sporadic benign and von  Hippel-Lindau-related pheochromocytomas. Significantly higher expression of  miR-885-5p and miR-1225-3p was found in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 and  sporadic recurring pheochromocytomas, respectively. Pathway analysis revealed  the possible involvement of Notch- and G-protein-coupled receptor signaling in  tumor recurrence. MicroRNA expression profiles in the primary recurrent and  recurring malignant comparisons have been similar. In conclusion, we have proved  that formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples can be used for the analysis of  microRNA expression in pheochromocytomas. MicroRNA expression patterns differ  between various sporadic, hereditary and recurring tumors and miR-1225-3p may be  useful for identifying recurring pheochromocytomas.

Brown JA(1), Emnett RJ, White CR, Yuede CM, Conyers SB, O'Malley KL, Wozniak DF,  Gutmann DH.  Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis,  MO, USA.  Learning and behavioral abnormalities are among the most common clinical  problems in children with the neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) inherited cancer  syndrome. Recent studies using Nf1 genetically engineered mice (GEM) have been  instructive for partly elucidating the cellular and molecular defects underlying  these cognitive deficits; however, no current model has shed light on the more  frequently encountered attention system abnormalities seen in children with NF1.  Using an Nf1 optic glioma (OPG) GEM model, we report novel defects in  non-selective and selective attention without an accompanying hyperactivity  phenotype. Specifically, Nf1 OPG mice exhibit reduced rearing in response to  novel objects and environmental stimuli. Similar to children with NF1, the  attention system dysfunction in these mice is reversed by treatment with  methylphenidate (MPH), suggesting a defect in brain catecholamine homeostasis.  We further demonstrate that this attention system abnormality is the consequence  of reduced dopamine (DA) levels in the striatum, which is normalized following  either MPH or l-dopa administration. The reduction in striatal DA levels in Nf1  OPG mice is associated with reduced striatal expression of tyrosine hydroxylase,  the rate-limited enzyme in DA synthesis, without any associated dopaminergic  cell loss in the substantia nigra. Moreover, we demonstrate a cell-autonomous  defect in Nf1+/- dopaminergic neuron growth cone areas and neurite extension in  vitro, which results in decreased dopaminergic cell projections to the striatum  in Nf1 OPG mice in vivo. Collectively, these data establish abnormal DA  homeostasis as the primary biochemical defect underlying the attention system  dysfunction in Nf1 GEM relevant to children with NF1.

Cioffi JA(1), Yue WY, Mendolia-Loffredo S, Hansen KR, Wackym PA, Hansen MR.  Author information: (1)Legacy Clinical Research and Technology Center, Portland, Oregon 97232, USA.  joeciof@aol.com  HYPOTHESIS: Elevated levels of hsa-microRNA-21 (miR-21) in vestibular  schwannomas (VSs) may contribute to tumor growth by downregulating the tumor  suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and consequent hyperactivation  of protein kinase B (AKT), a key signaling protein in the cellular pathways that  lead to tumor growth. BACKGROUND: Vestibular schwannomas are benign tumors that arise from the  vestibular nerve. Left untreated, VSs can result in hearing loss, tinnitus,  vestibular dysfunction, trigeminal nerve dysfunction, and can even become life  threatening. Despite efforts to characterize the VS transcriptome, the molecular  pathways that lead to tumorigenesis are not completely understood. MicroRNAs are  small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally by  blocking the production of specific target proteins. METHODS: We examined miR-21 expression in VSs. To determine the functional  significance of miR-21 expression in VS cells, we transfected primary human VS  cultures with anti-miR-21 or control, scrambled oligonucleotides. RESULTS: We found consistent overexpression of miR-21 when compared with normal  vestibular nerve tissue. Furthermore, elevated levels of miR-21 correlated with  decreased levels of PTEN, a known molecular target of miR-21. Anti-miR-21  decreased VS cell proliferation in response to platelet-derived growth factor  stimulation and increased apoptosis, suggesting that increased miR-21 levels  contributes to VS growth. CONCLUSION: Because PTEN regulates signaling through the growth-promoting  phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT pathway, our findings suggest that miR-21 may be a  suitable molecular target for therapies aimed specifically at reducing VS  growth.

Author information: (1)Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard  Medical School, 44 Binney Street, Boston, MA 02115, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 is the most commonly inherited human cancer  predisposition syndrome. Neurofibromin (NF1) gene mutations lead to increased  risk of neurofibromas, schwannomas, low grade, pilocytic optic pathway gliomas,  as well as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors and glioblastomas. Despite  the evidence for NF1 tumor suppressor function in glial cell tumors, the  mechanisms underlying transformation remain poorly understood. In this report,  we used morpholinos to knockdown the two nf1 orthologs in zebrafish and show  that oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) numbers are increased in the  developing spinal cord, whereas neurons are unaffected. The increased OPC  numbers in nf1 morphants resulted from increased proliferation, as detected by  increased BrdU labeling, whereas TUNEL staining for apoptotic cells was  unaffected. This phenotype could be rescued by the forced expression of the  GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-related domain of human NF1. In addition, the in  vivo analysis of OPC migration following nf1 loss using time-lapse microscopy  demonstrated that olig2-EGFP(+) OPCs exhibit enhanced cell migration within the  developing spinal cord. OPCs pause intermittently as they migrate, and in nf1  knockdown animals, they covered greater distances due to a decrease in average  pause duration, rather than an increase in velocity while in motion.  Interestingly, nf1 knockdown also leads to an increase in ERK signaling,  principally in the neurons of the spinal cord. Together, these results show that  negative regulation of the Ras pathway through the GAP activity of NF1 limits  OPC proliferation and motility during development, providing insight into the  oncogenic mechanisms through which NF1 loss contributes to human glial tumors.

Zhan Y(1), Modi N, Stewart AM, Hieronimus RI, Liu J, Gutmann DH, Chadee DN.  Author information: (1)Department of Biological Sciences, University of Toledo, Toledo, OH, USA.  The Neurofibromatosis-2 (NF2) tumor suppressor merlin negatively regulates cell  proliferation in numerous cell types. We have previously shown that the NF2  protein (merlin/schwannomin) associates with mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3), a  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase that is required for the  proliferation of normal and neoplastic cells. In this study, we show that merlin  inhibits MLK3 activity, as well as the activation of its downstream effectors,  B-Raf, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase  (JNK). The ability of merlin to regulate MLK3 activity requires a direct  association between MLK3 and residues in the C-terminal region of merlin. Merlin  integrates Rho GTPase family signaling with MAPK activity by inhibiting the  binding between MLK3 and its upstream activator, Cdc42. Furthermore, we  demonstrate that MLK3 is required for merlin-mediated suppression of cell  proliferation and invasion. Collectively, these results establish merlin as a  potent inhibitor of MLK3, ERK and JNK activation in cancer, and provide a  mechanistic link between deregulated MAPK and Rho GTPase signaling in NF2 growth  control.

Author information: (1)Centre for Oncology and Applied Pharmacology, University of Glasgow, Cancer  Research UK Beatson Laboratories, Garscube Estate, Switchback Road, Bearsden,  Glasgow G611BD, UK.  BACKGROUND: Cellular senescence is a major barrier to tumour progression, though  its role in pathogenesis of cancer and other diseases is poorly understood in  vivo. Improved understanding of the degree to which latent senescence signalling  persists in tumours might identify intervention strategies to provoke  ""accelerated senescence"" responses as a therapeutic outcome. Senescence involves  convergence of multiple pathways and requires ongoing dynamic signalling  throughout its establishment and maintenance. Recent discovery of several new  markers allows for an expression profiling approach to study specific senescence  phenotypes in relevant tissue samples. We adopted a ""senescence scoring""  methodology based on expression profiles of multiple senescence markers to  examine the degree to which signals of damage-associated or secretory senescence  persist in various human tumours. RESULTS: We first show that scoring captures differential induction of damage or  inflammatory pathways in a series of public datasets involving radiotherapy of  colon adenocarcinoma, chemotherapy of breast cancer cells, replicative  senescence of mesenchymal stem cells, and progression of melanoma. We extended  these results to investigate correlations between senescence score and growth  inhibition in response to ~1500 compounds in the NCI60 panel. Scoring of our own  mesenchymal tumour dataset highlighted differential expression of secretory  signalling pathways between distinct subgroups of MPNST, liposarcomas and  peritoneal mesothelioma. Furthermore, a pro-inflammatory signature yielded by  hierarchical clustering of secretory markers showed prognostic significance in  mesothelioma. CONCLUSIONS: We find that ""senescence scoring"" accurately reports senescence  signalling in a variety of situations where senescence would be expected to  occur and highlights differential expression of damage associated and secretory  senescence pathways in a context-dependent manner.

Martin S(1), Gillespie A, Wolters PL, Widemann BC.  Author information: (1)Pediatric Oncology Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of  Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. martins@mail.nih.gov  BACKGROUND: With increasing knowledge of the molecular pathways contributing to  the progression of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-related plexiform neurofibroma  (PN), the number of clinical trials for PNs has increased. However, little is  known about the experiences of families with children with NF1 participating in  clinical trials. METHOD: A 47-item anonymous survey, designed to assess experiences in research,  was sent to parents with a child with NF1 and PNs who was evaluated at the  National Cancer Institute (NCI) for a clinical trial. RESULTS: Sixty-four (85%) parents completed the paper or online questionnaire.  Fifty-nine percent of the children were male; 44% were 11 years or older upon  enrollment. Most parents reported understanding the purpose of the study,  possible side effects, and their right to withdraw. Of respondents whose child  had participated in a placebo-controlled trial, 100% said they understood the  reason for the placebo at least somewhat. Seventy-four percent felt that study  participation helped their child; most would ""definitely"" or ""probably""  participate in a future study, including a placebo-controlled trial, and  particularly those assessing cognitive functioning or pain. Overall satisfaction  with participation was high and correlated with fewer transportation problems,  fewer study-related financial difficulties, and fewer school problems for the  child (ps<.05). CONCLUSIONS: Most parents of children with NF1 who participated in research at  the NCI reported a positive impact and would participate in future studies.

Author information: (1)Institut de Medicina Predictiva i Personalitzada del Càncer, Badalona,  Barcelona, Spain.  Dermal neurofibromas (dNFs) are benign tumors of the peripheral nervous system  typically associated with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients. Genes  controlling the integrity of the DNA are likely to influence the number of  neurofibromas developed because dNFs are caused by somatic mutational  inactivation of the NF1 gene, frequently evidenced by loss of heterozygosity  (LOH). We performed a comprehensive analysis of the prevalence and mechanisms of  LOH in dNFs. Our study included 518 dNFs from 113 patients. LOH was detected in  25% of the dNFs (N = 129). The most frequent mechanism causing LOH was mitotic  recombination, which was observed in 62% of LOH-tumors (N = 80), and which does  not reduce the number of NF1 gene copies. All events were generated by a single  crossover located between the centromere and the NF1 gene, resulting in  isodisomy of 17q. LOH due to the loss of the NF1 gene accounted for a 38% of  dNFs with LOH (N = 49), with deletions ranging in size from ∼80 kb to ∼8 Mb  within 17q. In one tumor we identified the first example of a  neurofibroma-associated second-hit type-2 NF1 deletion. Analysis of the  prevalence of mechanisms causing LOH in dNFs in individual patients (possibly  under genetic control) will elucidate whether there exist interindividual  variation.  © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Rouleau GA(1), Seizinger BR, Wertelecki W, Haines JL, Superneau DW, Martuza RL,  Gusella JF.  Author information: (1)Neurogenetics Laboratory, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown 02129.  Neurofibromatosis 2 or bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis (NF2) is a severe  autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of multiple tumors  of the nervous system, including meningiomas, gliomas, neurofibromas,  ependymomas, and particularly acoustic neuromas. Polymorphic DNA markers have  revealed frequent loss of one copy of chromosome 22 in the tumor types  associated with NF2. Family studies have demonstrated that the primary defect in  NF2 is linked to DNA markers on chromosome 22, suggesting that it involves  inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene. We have employed a combination of  multipoint linkage analysis and examination of deletions in primary tumor  specimens to precisely map the NF2 locus between flanking polymorphic DNA  markers on chromosome 22. The 13-cM region bracketed by these markers  corresponds to 13% of the genetic length of the long arm of chromosome 22 and is  expected to contain less than 5 x 10(6) bp of DNA. The delineation of flanking  markers for NF2 should permit accurate presymptomatic and prenatal diagnosis for  the disorder and greatly facilitate efforts to isolate the defective gene on the  basis of its location.

Chow HY(1), Stepanova D, Koch J, Chernoff J.  Author information: (1)Cancer Biology Program, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,  United States of America.  BACKGROUND: NF2 is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by development of  bilateral vestibular schwannomas and other benign tumors in central nervous  system. Loss of the NF2 gene product, Merlin, leads to aberrant Schwann cell  proliferation, motility, and survival, but the mechanisms by which this tumor  suppressor functions remain unclear. One well-defined target of Merlin is the  group I family of p21-activated kinases, which are allosterically inhibited by  Merlin and which, when activated, stimulate cell cycle progression, motility,  and increased survival. Here, we examine the effect of Pak inhibition on cells  with diminished Merlin function. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using a specific peptide inhibitor of group I  Paks, we show that loss of Pak activity restores normal cell movement in cells  lacking Merlin function. In addition, xenografts of such cells form fewer and  smaller tumors than do cells without Pak inhibition. However, in tumors, loss of  Pak activity does not reduce Erk or Akt activity, two signaling proteins that  are thought to mediate Pak function in growth factor pathways. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that Pak functions in novel  signaling pathways in NF2, and may serve as a useful therapeutic target in this  disease.

Gladden AB(1), Hebert AM, Schneeberger EE, McClatchey AI.  Author information: (1)Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Charlestown, MA 02129, USA.  The neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor, Merlin, is a FERM (Four  point one, Ezrin, Radixin, Moesin) domain-containing protein whose loss results  in defective morphogenesis and tumorigenesis in multiple tissues. Like the  closely related ERM proteins (Ezrin, Radixin, and Moesin), Merlin may organize  the plasma membrane by assembling membrane protein complexes and linking them to  the cortical actin cytoskeleton. We previously found that Merlin is a critical  mediator of contact-dependent inhibition of proliferation and is required for  the establishment of stable adherens junctions (AJs) in cultured cells. Here, we  delineate the molecular function of Merlin in AJ establishment in epidermal  keratinocytes in vitro and confirm that a role in AJ establishment is an  essential function of Merlin in vivo. Our studies reveal that Merlin can  associate directly with α-catenin and link it to Par3, thereby providing an  essential link between the AJ and the Par3 polarity complex during junctional  maturation.

Li W(1), Giancotti FG.  Author information: (1)Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, New York, NY, USA.  The mechanism by which the FERM domain protein Merlin, encoded by the tumor  suppressor NF2, restrains cell proliferation is poorly understood. Prior studies  have suggested that Merlin exerts its antimitogenic effect by interacting with  multiple signaling proteins located at or close to the plasma membrane. We have  recently observed that Merlin translocates into the nucleus and binds to and  inhibits the E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4 (DCAF1) . Genetic evidence indicates that  inactivation of Merlin induces oncogenic gene expression, hyperproliferation,  and tumorigenicity by unleashing the activity of CRL4 (DCAF1) . In addition to  providing a potential explanation for the diverse effects that loss of Merlin  exerts in multiple cell types, these findings suggest that compounds inhibiting  CRL4 (DCAF1) may display therapeutic efficacy in Neurofibromatosis type 2 and  other cancers driven by Merlin inactivation.

These cells reliably formed a tumor within several weeks which had  pathologic characteristics of schwannoma tumors.

Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis,  Missouri 63110, USA.  Whereas carcinogenesis requires the acquisition of driver mutations in  progenitor cells, tumor growth and progression are heavily influenced by the  local microenvironment. Previous studies from our laboratory have used  Neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) genetically engineered mice to characterize the role  of stromal cells and signals to optic glioma formation and growth. Previously,  we have shown that Nf1+/- microglia in the tumor microenvironment are critical  cellular determinants of optic glioma proliferation. To define the role of  microglia in tumor formation and maintenance further, we used CD11b-TK mice, in  which resident brain microglia (CD11b+, CD68+, Iba1+, CD45low cells) can be  ablated at specific times after ganciclovir administration. Ganciclovir-mediated  microglia reduction reduced Nf1 optic glioma proliferation during both tumor  maintenance and tumor development. We identified the developmental window during  which microglia are increased in the Nf1+/- optic nerve and demonstrated that  this accumulation reflected delayed microglia dispersion. The increase in  microglia in the Nf1+/- optic nerve was associated with reduced expression of  the chemokine receptor, CX3CR1, such that reduced Cx3cr1 expression in  Cx3cr1-GFP heterozygous knockout mice led to a similar increase in optic nerve  microglia. These results establish a critical role for microglia in the  development and maintenance of Nf1 optic glioma.

Author information: (1)Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City 84132.  Von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1) is one of the most common inherited  human disorders. The genetic locus that harbors the mutation(s) responsible for  NF1 is near the centromere of chromosome 17, within band q11.2. Translocation  breakpoints that have been found in this region in two patients with NF1 provide  physical landmarks and suggest an approach to identifying the NF1 gene. As part  of our exploration of this region, we have mapped the human homolog of a murine  gene (Evi-2) implicated in myeloid tumors to a location between the two  translocation breakpoints on chromosome 17. Cosmid-walk clones define a 60-kb  region between the two NF1 translocation breakpoints. The probable role of Evi-2  in murine neoplastic disease and the map location of the human homolog suggest a  potential role for EVI2 in NF1, but no physical rearrangements of this gene  locus are apparent in 87 NF1 patients.

Author information: (1)Department of Molecular Biology and Microbiology, Burnett School of  Biomedical Science, College of Medicine, University of Central Florida, Health  Science Campus, 6900 Lake Nona Boulevard, Orlando, FL 32827, USA.  The Neurofibromatosis type 2 tumor suppressor, schwannomin (Sch) is a plasma  membrane-cytoskeleton linking protein that regulates receptor signaling and  actin dynamics. We examined Sch's role in specifying morphological changes  needed for Schwann cell (SC) function in vitro. Isolated Sch-GFP-expressing SCs  extended bipolar processes 82% longer than those formed by GFP-expressing cells.  In contrast, SCs expressing dominant negative Sch-BBA-GFP extended bipolar  processes 16% shorter than controls and 64% shorter than Sch-GFP-expressing SCs.  nf2 gene inactivation caused isolated mouse SCs to transition from bipolar to  multipolar cells. Live imaging revealed that SCs co-expressing Sch-GFP and  dominant negative RacN17 behaved similarly in dorsal root ganglion explant  cultures; they quickly aligned on axons and slowly elongated bipolar processes.  In contrast, SCs expressing constitutively active RacV12 underwent continuous  transitions in morphology that interfered with axon alignment. When co-cultured  with neurons under myelin-promoting conditions, Sch-GFP-expressing SCs  elaborated longer myelin segments than GFP-expressing SCs. In contrast,  Sch-BBA-GFP-expressing SCs failed to align on or myelinate axons. Together,  these results demonstrate that Sch plays an essential role in inducing and/or  maintaining the SC's spindle shape and suggest that the mechanism involves  Sch-dependent inhibition of Rac activity. By stabilizing the bipolar morphology,  Sch promotes the alignment of SCs with axons and ultimately influences myelin  segment length.  Published by Elsevier Inc.

The von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) locus has been previously  assigned to the proximal long arm of chromosome 17, and two NF1 patients have  been identified who have constitutional balanced translocations involving  17q11.2. We have constructed a cosmid library from a chromosome-mediated gene  transfectant, KLT8, that contains approximately 10% of chromosome 17, including  17q11.2. Cosmids isolated from this library have been mapped across a panel of  somatic cell hybrids, including the hybrids from the two patients, and have been  localized to seven small regions of proximal 17q. We have 5 cosmids that map  directly above the two NF1 translocations, and 11 cosmids that map directly  below. Of these, 2 cosmids in each region are linked to the disease locus and 3  of these cosmids show no recombination. One distal cosmid, 2B/B35, detects the  two NF1 translocations by pulsed-field gel analysis and has been used to produce  a long-range restriction map that covers the translocations.

Author information: (1)Institute of Medical Genetics, Cardiff University, Heath Park Campus, Cardiff  CF14 4XN, United Kingdom. upadhyaya@cardiff.ac.uk  Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), often found associated with  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), are aggressive tumors that pose significant  diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. About 10% of NF1 patients may develop an  MPNST, exhibiting a poor prognosis. With no effective treatment available,  radical surgery and chemo- and radiotherapy are required to reduce tumor  recurrence, metastasis and prolong patient survival. MPNST pathogenesis is  poorly understood due mainly to its complex histopathology, but biallelic NF1  gene inactivation is essential for tumor development. There is also no defined  molecular signature for MPNST development, although several cell-cycle and  signalling regulation genes (CDKN2A, TP53, RB1, EGFR, CD44, PDGFR, PDGFRA, HGF,  MET and SOX9) are deregulated. Constitutive activation of several critical cell  signalling cascades also occurs in MPNSTs and these may define therapeutic  targets. Both preclinical and clinical trials are proposed, most involving a  combinatorial therapeutic approach. Multidisciplinary collaborative efforts are  clearly essential to fully decipher both the complex molecular basis of MPNST  development and to define potential therapeutic targets.

Author information: (1)Department of Radiation Oncology, University of California, San Francisco,  California 94158, USA. jnakamura@radonc.ucsf.edu  Secondary malignant neoplasms (SMN) are increasingly common complications of  cancer therapy that have proven difficult to model in mice. Clinical  observations suggest that the development of SMN correlates with radiation dose;  however, this relationship has not been investigated systematically. We  developed a novel procedure for administering fractionated cranial irradiation  (CI) and investigated the incidence and spectrum of cancer in control and  heterozygous Nf1 mutant mice irradiated to a moderate (15 Gy) or high dose (30  Gy). Heterozygous Nf1 inactivation cooperated with CI to induce solid tumors and  myeloid malignancies, with mice developing many of the most common SMNs found in  human patients. CI-induced malignancies segregated according to radiation dose  as Nf1(+/-) mice developed predominately hematologic abnormalities after 15 Gy,  whereas solid tumors predominated at 30 Gy, suggesting that radiation dose  thresholds exist for hematologic and nonhematologic cancers. Genetic and  biochemical studies revealed discrete patterns of somatic Nf1 and Trp53  inactivation and we observed hyperactive Ras signaling in many radiation-induced  solid tumors. This technique for administering focal fractionated irradiation  will facilitate mechanistic and translational studies of SMNs.  © 2011 AACR.

Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, Box 8111,  660 South Euclid Avenue, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.  The identification of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) as a major mediator  of neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) tumor growth has led to the initiation of clinical  trials using rapamycin analogs. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown  that durable responses to rapamycin treatment in a genetically engineered mouse  model of Nf1 optic glioma require 20 mg/kg/day, whereas only transient tumor  growth suppression was observed with 5 mg/kg/day rapamycin despite complete  silencing of ribosomal S6 activity. To gain clinically relevant insights into  the mechanism underlying this dose-dependent effect, we used Nf1-deficient glial  cells in vitro and in vivo. First, there was an exponential relationship between  blood and brain rapamycin levels. Second, we show that currently used biomarkers  of mTOR pathway inhibition (phospho-S6, phospho-4EBP1, phospho-STAT3, and  Jagged-1 levels) and tumor proliferation (Ki67) do not accurately reflect mTOR  target inhibition or Nf1-deficient glial growth suppression. Third, the  incomplete suppression of Nf1-deficient glial cell proliferation in vivo  following 5 mg/kg/day rapamycin treatment reflects mTOR-mediated AKT activation,  such that combined 5 mg/kg/day rapamycin and PI3-kinase (PI3K) inhibition or  dual PI3K/mTOR inhibition recapitulates the growth suppressive effects of 20  mg/kg/day rapamycin. These new findings argue for the identification of more  accurate biomarkers for rapamycin treatment response and provide reference  preclinical data for comparing human rapamycin levels with target effects in the  brain.

Lopez G(1), Torres K, Lev D.  Author information: (1)Department of Cancer Biology, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer  Center, Houston, TX, USA.  Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive, highly  metastatic, poor prognosis tumors for which effective therapeutic strategies are  currently lacking. We summarize recent work focusing on preclinical evaluation  of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) for the treatment of MPNST. HDACis  are a novel drug class with anti-cancer therapeutic promise. Using human MPNST  cell lines and xenograft models we found that a MPNST subset is highly sensitive  to HDACis, whereas a fraction is relatively resistant. HDACis were found to  induce autophagy in all MPNST cells in vitro and in vivo; in ""sensitive"" MPNST  cells autophagy occurs in concert with apoptosis, whereas unopposed autophagy  develops in ""resistant"" cells. Genetic and chemical autophagy blockade  significantly enhances HDACi-induced apoptotic cell death in both resistant and  sensitive cells. Combined chloroquine and HDACi treatment abrogates growth of  human MPNST xenografts and lung metastases. The potential role of autophagy in  cancer therapeutic response remains controversial; however, our study supports  HDACi-induced autophagy as a MPNST survival mechanism. These data also imply  that the consequences of drug-induced autophagy may be compound-type,  tumor-type, or even molecular context-dependent, suggesting a complex crosstalk  between autophagy and apoptosis. Clinical trials evaluating HDACis with  autophagy blockade for therapy of MPNST therefore merit consideration.

Rousseau G(1), Noguchi T, Bourdon V, Sobol H, Olschwang S.  Author information: (1)Laboratory of Molecular Oncogenetics, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille,  France.  BACKGROUND: Schwannomatosis is a disease characterized by multiple  non-vestibular schwannomas. Although biallelic NF2 mutations are found in  schwannomas, no germ line event is detected in schwannomatosis patients. In  contrast, germline mutations of the SMARCB1 (INI1) tumor suppressor gene were  described in familial and sporadic schwannomatosis patients. METHODS: To delineate the SMARCB1 gene contribution, the nine coding exons were  sequenced in a series of 56 patients affected with a variable number of  non-vestibular schwannomas. RESULTS: Nine variants scattered along the sequence of SMARCB1 were identified.  Five of them were classified as deleterious. All five patients carrying a  SMARCB1 mutation had more multiple schwannomas, corresponding to 10.2% of  patients with schwannomatosis. They were also diagnosed before 35 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that patients with schwannomas have a  significant probability of carrying a SMARCB1 mutation. Combined with data  available from other studies, they confirm the clinical indications for genetic  screening of the SMARCB1 gene.

Author information: (1)Department of Neuroscience, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The  Netherlands.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominantly inherited disease,  characterized by various neurocutaneous symptoms, cognitive impairments and  problems in fine and gross motor performance. Although cognitive deficits in NF1  have been attributed to increased release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter  γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) in the hippocampus, the origin of the motor deficits  is unknown. Cerebellar Purkinje cells, the sole output neurons of the cerebellar  cortex, are GABAergic neurons and express neurofibromin at high levels,  suggesting an important role for the cerebellum in the observed motor deficits  in NF1. To test this, we determined the cerebellar contribution to motor  problems in Nf1(+/-) mice, a validated mouse model for NF1. Using the Rotarod, a  non-specific motor performance test, we confirmed that, like NF1 patients,  Nf1(+/-) mice have motor deficits. Next, to evaluate the role of the cerebellum  in these deficits, mice were subjected to cerebellum-specific motor performance  and learning tests. Nf1(+/-) mice showed no impairment on the Erasmus ladder, as  step time and number of missteps were not different. Furthermore, when  compensatory eye movements were tested, no performance deficits were found in  the optokinetic reflex and vestibulo-ocular reflex in the dark (VOR) or in the  light (VVOR). Finally, Nf1(+/-) mice successfully completed short- and long-term  VOR adaptation paradigms, tests that both depend on cerebellar function. Thus,  despite the confirmed presence of motor performance problems in Nf1(+/-) mice,  we found no indication of a cerebellar component. These results, combined with  recent clinical data, suggest that cerebellar function is not overtly affected  in NF1 patients.  © 2011 The Authors.

Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a multiple neoplasia syndrome and is caused by  a mutation of the NF2 tumor suppressor gene that encodes for the tumor  suppressor protein merlin. Biallelic NF2 gene inactivation results in the  development of central nervous system tumors, including schwannomas,  meningiomas, ependymomas, and astrocytomas. Although a wide variety of missense  germline mutations in the coding sequences of the NF2 gene can cause loss of  merlin function, the mechanism of this functional loss is unknown. To gain  insight into the mechanisms underlying loss of merlin function in NF2, we  investigated mutated merlin homeostasis and function in NF2-associated tumors  and cell lines. Quantitative protein and RT-PCR analysis revealed that whereas  merlin protein expression was significantly reduced in NF2-associated tumors,  mRNA expression levels were unchanged. Transfection of genetic constructs of  common NF2 missense mutations into NF2 gene-deficient meningioma cell lines  revealed that merlin loss of function is due to a reduction in mutant protein  half-life and increased protein degradation. Transfection analysis also  demonstrated that recovery of tumor suppressor protein function is possible,  indicating that these mutants maintain intrinsic functional capacity. Further,  increased expression of mutant protein is possible after treatment with specific  proteostasis regulators, implicating protein quality control systems in the  degradative fate of mutant tumor suppressor proteins. These findings provide  direct insight into protein function and tumorigenesis in NF2 and indicate a  unique treatment paradigm for this disorder.

PMID:21402777,FERM domain phosphoinositide binding targets merlin to the membrane and is essential for its growth-suppressive function.,"FERM domain phosphoinositide binding targets merlin to the membrane and is  essential for its growth-suppressive function.  Mani T(1), Hennigan RF, Foster LA, Conrady DG, Herr AB, Ip W.  Author information: (1)Department of Cancer and Cell Biology, Vontz Center for Molecular Studies,  3125 Eden Avenue, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45267-0521, USA.  The neurofibromatosis type 2 tumor suppressor protein, merlin, is related to the  ERM (ezrin, radixin, and moesin) family of plasma membrane-actin cytoskeleton  linkers. For ezrin, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)) binding to  the amino-terminal FERM domain is required for its conformational activation,  proper subcellular localization, and function, but less is known about the role  of phosphoinositide binding for merlin. Current evidence indicates that  association with the membrane is important for merlin to function as a growth  regulator; however, the mechanisms by which merlin localizes to the membrane are  less clear. Here, we report that merlin binds phosphoinositides, including  PIP(2), via a conserved binding motif in its FERM domain. Abolition of FERM  domain-mediated phosphoinositide binding of merlin displaces merlin from the  membrane and releases it into the cytosol without altering the folding of  merlin. Importantly, a merlin protein whose FERM domain cannot bind  phosphoinositide is defective in growth suppression. Retargeting the mutant  merlin into the membrane using a dual-acylated amino-terminal decapeptide from  Fyn is sufficient to restore the growth-suppressive properties to the mutant  merlin. Thus, FERM domain-mediated phosphoinositide binding and membrane  association are critical for the growth-regulatory function of merlin.

Menon AG(1), Anderson KM, Riccardi VM, Chung RY, Whaley JM, Yandell DW, Farmer  GE, Freiman RN, Lee JK, Li FP, et al.  Author information: (1)Molecular Neurogenetics Laboratory, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.  von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1) is a common hereditary disorder  characterized by neural crest-derived tumors, particularly benign neurofibromas  whose malignant transformation to neurofibrosarcomas can be fatal. The NF1 gene  has been mapped to a small region of chromosome 17q, but neither the nature of  the primary defect nor the mechanisms involved in tumor progression are  understood. We have tested whether NF1 might be caused by the inactivation of a  tumor suppressor gene on 17q, analogous to that on chromosome 22 in NF2, by  searching for deletions of chromosome 17 in NF1-derived tumor specimens. Both  neurofibrosarcomas from patients with ""atypical"" NF and 5 of 6  neurofibrosarcomas from NF1 patients displayed loss of alleles for polymorphic  DNA markers on chromosome 17. However, the common region of deletion was on 17p  and did not include the NF1 region of 17q. Since no loss of markers on  chromosome 17 was observed in any of 30 benign tumors from NF1 patients, the 17p  deletions seen in neurofibrosarcomas are probably associated with tumor  progression and/or malignancy. This region contains a candidate gene for tumor  progression, p53, which has recently been implicated in the progression of a  broad array of human cancers. In a preliminary search for p53 aberrations by  direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA from 7  neurofibrosarcomas, 2 tumors that contained point mutations in exon 4 of the p53  gene were found, suggesting a role for this gene in at least some  neurofibrosarcomas. Thus the formation of malignant neurofibrosarcomas may  result from several independent genetic events including mutation of the NF1  gene, whose mechanism of tumorigenesis remains uncertain, and subsequent loss of  a ""tumor suppressor"" gene on 17p, most likely p53.

Zhang W(1), Rhodes SD, Zhao L, He Y, Zhang Y, Shen Y, Yang D, Wu X, Li X, Yang  X, Park SJ, Chen S, Turner C, Yang FC.  Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine,  Indianapolis, IN, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant genetic disorder  caused by mutation of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene. Spinal deformities are  common skeletal manifestations in patients with NF1. To date, the mechanism of  vertebral abnormalities remains unclear because of the lack of appropriate  animal models for the skeletal manifestations of NF1. In the present study, we  report a novel murine NF1 model, Nf1(flox/-);Col2.3Cre(+) mice. These mice  display short vertebral segments. In addition, a significant reduction in  cortical and trabecular bone mass of the vertebrae was observed in  Nf1(flox/-);Col2.3Cre(+) mice as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry  (DEXA) and peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT). Peak stress and  peak load were also significantly reduced in Nf1(flox/-);Col2.3Cre(+) mice as  compared to controls. Furthermore, the lumbar vertebrae showed enlargement of  the inter-vertebral canal, a characteristic feature of lumbar vertebrae in NF1  patients. Finally, histologic analysis demonstrated increased numbers of  osteoclasts and decreased numbers of osteoblasts in the vertebrae of  Nf1(flox/-);Col2.3Cre(+) mice in comparison to controls. In summary,  Nf1(flox/-);Col2.3Cre(+) mice demonstrate multiple structural and functional  abnormalities in the lumbar vertebrae which recapitulate the dystrophic  vertebral changes in NF1 patients. This novel murine model provides a platform  to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis  of spinal deficits in NF1 patients.  Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Baser ME(1), Friedman JM, Joe H, Shenton A, Wallace AJ, Ramsden RT, Evans DG.  Author information: (1)Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia and the Child  & Family Research Institute, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  PURPOSE: Four sets of clinical diagnostic criteria have been proposed for  neurofibromatosis 2, but all have low sensitivity at the time of initial  clinical assessment for the disease among patients with a negative family  history who do not present with bilateral vestibular schwannomas. We have  empirically developed and tested an improved set of diagnostic criteria that  uses current understanding of the natural history and genetic characteristics of  neurofibromatosis 2 to increase sensitivity while maintaining very high  specificity. METHODS: We used data from the UK Neurofibromatosis 2 Registry and Kaplan-Meier  curves to estimate frequencies of clinical features at various ages among  patients with or without unequivocal neurofibromatosis 2. On the basis of this  analysis, we developed the Baser criteria, a new diagnostic system that  incorporates genetic testing and gives more weight to the most characteristic  features and to those that occur before 30 years of age. RESULTS: In an independent validation subset of patients with unequivocal  neurofibromatosis 2, the Baser criteria increased diagnostic sensitivity to 79%  (9-15% greater than previous sets of criteria) while maintaining 100%  specificity at the age at onset of the first characteristic sign of  neurofibromatosis 2. CONCLUSION: The Baser criteria permit early diagnosis in a greater proportion of  patients with neurofibromatosis 2 than previous sets of diagnostic criteria.

Erkan EP(1), Breakefield XO, Saydam O.  Author information: (1)Molecular Oncology Research Unit, Division of Oncology, Department of  Pediatrics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna 1090 Austria.  miRNAs have been recently implicated as drivers in several carcinogenic  processes, where they can act either as oncogenes or as tumor suppressors.  Schwannomas arise from Schwann cells, the myelinating cells of the peripheral  nervous system. These benign tumors typically result from loss of the  neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene. We have recently carried  out high-throughput miRNA expression profiling of human vestibular schwannomas  using an array representing 407 known miRNAs in order to explore the role of  miRNAs in the tumorigenesis of schwannomas. We found that miR-7 functions as a  ""tumor suppressor"" by targeting proteins in three major oncogenic pathways -  EGFR, Pak1, and Ack1. Interestingly, in this study, we also observed that  several previously described potential tumor suppressor miRNAs that are  down-regulated in malignant tumors were up-regulated in schwannomas. Here we  discuss the possibility that ""tumor suppressor"" miRNAs may play a role in the  transition stage(s) of cancer from benign to malignant forms.

Turk AN(1), Byer SJ, Zinn KR, Carroll SL.  Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, USA.  Although in vitro screens are essential for the initial identification of  candidate therapeutic agents, a rigorous assessment of the drug's ability to  inhibit tumor growth must be performed in a suitable animal model. The type of  animal model that is best for this purpose is a topic of intense discussion.  Some evidence indicates that preclinical trials examining drug effects on tumors  arising in transgenic mice are more predictive of clinical outcome(1)and so  candidate therapeutic agents are often tested in these models. Unfortunately,  transgenic models are not available for many tumor types. Further, transgenic  models often have other limitations such as concerns as to how well the mouse  tumor models its human counterpart, incomplete penetrance of the tumor phenotype  and an inability to predict when tumors will develop. Consequently, many  investigators use xenograft models (human tumor cells grafted into  immunodeficient mice) for preclinical trials if appropriate transgenic tumor  models are not available. Even if transgenic models are available, they are  often partnered with xenograft models as the latter facilitate rapid  determination of therapeutic ranges. Further, this partnership allows a  comparison of the effectiveness of the agent in transgenic tumors and genuine  human tumor cells. Historically, xenografting has often been performed by  injecting tumor cells subcutaneously (ectopic xenografts). This technique is  rapid and reproducible, relatively inexpensive and allows continuous  quantitation of tumor growth during the therapeutic period(2). However, the  subcutaneous space is not the normal microenvironment for most neoplasms and so  results obtained with ectopic xenografting can be misleading due to factors such  as an absence of organ-specific expression of host tissue and tumor genes. It  has thus been strongly recommended that ectopic grafting studies be replaced or  complemented by studies in which human tumor cells are grafted into their tissue  of origin (orthotopic xenografting)(2). Unfortunately, implementation of this  recommendation is often thwarted by the fact that orthotopic xenografting  methodologies have not yet been developed for many tumor types. Malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are highly aggressive sarcomas that  occur sporadically or in association with neurofibromatosis type 1(3) and most  commonly arise in the sciatic nerve(4). Here we describe a technically  straightforward method in which firefly luciferase-tagged human MPNST cells are  orthopically xenografted into the sciatic nerve of immunodeficient mice. Our  approach to assessing the success of the grafting procedure in individual  animals and subsequent non-biased randomization into study groups is also  discussed.

Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, Division of Medical Genetics, University of Utah,  Salt Lake City, USA.  Skeletal abnormalities including scoliosis, tibial dysplasia, sphenoid wing  dysplasia, and decreased bone mineral density (BMD) are associated with  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). We report the cellular phenotype of NF1  human-derived osteoclasts and compare the in vitro findings with the clinical  phenotype. Functional characteristics (e.g., osteoclast formation, migration,  adhesion, resorptive capacity) and cellular mechanistic alterations (e.g.,  F-actin polymerization, MAPK phosphorylation, RhoGTPase activity) from  osteoclasts cultured from peripheral blood of individuals with NF1 (N = 75) were  assessed. Osteoclast formation was compared to phenotypic, radiologic, and  biochemical data. NF1 osteoprogenitor cells demonstrated increased osteoclast  forming capacity. Human NF1-derived osteoclasts demonstrated increased  migration, adhesion, and in vitro bone resorption. These activities coincided  with increased actin belt formation and hyperactivity in MAPK and RhoGTPase  pathways. Although osteoclast formation was increased, no direct correlation of  osteoclast formation with BMD, markers of bone resorption, or the clinical  skeletal phenotype was observed suggesting that osteoclast formation in vitro  cannot directly predict NF1 skeletal phenotypes. While NF1 haploinsufficiency  produces a generalized osteoclast gain-in-function and may contribute to  increased bone resorption, reduced BMD, and focal skeletal defects associated  with NF1, additional and perhaps local modifiers are likely required for the  development of skeletal abnormalities in NF1.

Author information: (1)FG Development & Disease, Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics,  Ihnestrasse 73, Berlin, Germany.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a multi-system disease caused by mutations in  the NF1 gene encoding a Ras-GAP protein, neurofibromin, which negatively  regulates Ras signaling. Besides neuroectodermal malformations and tumors, the  skeletal system is often affected (e.g. scoliosis and long bone dysplasia)  demonstrating the importance of neurofibromin for development and maintenance of  the musculoskeletal system. Here, we focus on the role of neurofibromin in  skeletal muscle development. Nf1 gene inactivation in the early limb bud  mesenchyme using Prx1-cre (Nf1(Prx1)) resulted in muscle dystrophy characterized  by fibrosis, reduced number of muscle fibers and reduced muscle force. This was  caused by an early defect in myogenesis affecting the terminal differentiation  of myoblasts between E12.5 and E14.5. In parallel, the muscle connective tissue  cells exhibited increased proliferation at E14.5 and an increase in the amount  of connective tissue as early as E16.5. These changes were accompanied by  excessive mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation. Satellite cells  isolated from Nf1(Prx1) mice showed normal self-renewal, but their  differentiation was impaired as indicated by diminished myotube formation. Our  results demonstrate a requirement of neurofibromin for muscle formation and  maintenance. This previously unrecognized function of neurofibromin may  contribute to the musculoskeletal problems in NF1 patients.

Wang JH(1), Lasota J, Miettinen M.  Author information: (1)Department of Soft Tissue Pathology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology,  Washington, DC, USA.  Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST) is the most common mesenchymal tumor of  the digestive tract. GISTs develop with relatively high incidence in patients  with Neurofibromatosis-1 syndrome (NF1). Mutational activation of KIT or PDGFRA  is believed to be a driving force in the pathogenesis of familial and sporadic  GISTs. Unlike those tumors, NF1-associated GISTs do not have KIT or PGDFRA  mutations. Similarly, no mutational activation of KIT or PDGFRA has been  identified in pediatric GISTs and in GISTs associated with Carney Triad and  Carney-Stratakis Syndrome. KIT and PDGFRA-wild type tumors are expected to have  lesser response to imatinib treatment. Recently, Carney Triad and  Carney-Stratakis Syndrome -associated GISTs and pediatric GISTs have been shown  to have a loss of expression of succinate dehydrogenase subunit B (SDHB), a  Krebs cycle/electron transport chain interface protein. It was proposed that  GISTs can be divided into SDHB- positive (type 1), and SDHB-negative (type 2)  tumors because of similarities in clinical features and response to imatinib  treatment. In this study, SDHB expression was examined immunohistochemically in  22 well-characterized NF1-associated GISTs. All analyzed tumors expressed SDHB.  Based on SDHB-expression status, NF1-associated GISTs belong to type 1 category;  however, similarly to SDHB type 2 tumors, they do not respond well to imatinib  treatment. Therefore, a simple categorization of GISTs into SDHB-positive  and-negative seems to be incomplete. A classification based on both SDHB  expression status and KIT and PDGFRA mutation status characterize GISTs more  accurately and allow subdivision of SDHB-positive tumors into different  clinico-genetic categories.

Therefore, it is of great importance to use the most  sensitive technology for testing DNA of the parents of the index patient for the  presence/absence of the familial mutation. To detect large rearrangements  multiplex ligation-depending probe amplification (MLPA) is often used. Here we  show that MLPA is less sensitive in detecting low-grade somatic mosaicism than  fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or a mutation-specific PCR test.  Therefore, we recommend FISH (if possible) or PCR analysis for the analysis of  parental DNA.

Author information: (1)Departments of Developmental Biology and Dermatology, Simmons Comprehensive  Cancer Center, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas,  Texas 75390-9133, USA. Lu.Le@UTSouthwestern.edu  Stem cells are under strict regulation by both intrinsic factors and the  microenvironment. There is increasing evidence that many cancers initiate  through acquisition of genetic mutations (loss of intrinsic control) in stem  cells or their progenitors, followed by alterations of the surrounding  microenvironment (loss of extrinsic control). In neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1),  deregulation of Ras signaling results in development of multiple neurofibromas,  complex tumors of the peripheral nerves. Neurofibromas arise from the Schwann  cell lineage following loss of function at the NF1 locus, which initiates a  cascade of interactions with other cell types in the microenvironment and  additional cell autonomous modifications. In this study, we sought to identify  whether a temporal ""window of opportunity"" exists during which cells of the  Schwann cell lineage can give rise to neurofibromas following loss of NF1. We  showed that acute loss of NF1 in both embryonic and adult Schwann cells can lead  to neurofibroma formation. However, the embryonic period when Schwann cell  precursors and immature Schwann cells are most abundant coincides with enhanced  susceptibility to plexiform neurofibroma tumorigenesis. This model has important  implications for understanding early cellular events that dictate neurofibroma  development, as well as for the development of novel therapies targeting these  tumors.  ©2011 AACR.

Fourteen mutations were within the dinucleotide acceptor and donor regions,  often referred to as (AG/GT) sequences. Six were outside these dinucleotide  regions but within the more broadly defined splicing regions used in the  information theory based model. Two others were in introns and outside the  broadly defined regions. Transcript analysis revealed exon skipping or  activation of one or more cryptic splicing sites for 17 mutations. No  alterations were found for the two intronic mutations and for three mutations in  the broadly defined splicing regions. Concordance and partial concordance  between the calculated predictions and the results of transcript analysis were  found for 14 and 6 mutations, respectively. For two mutations, the predicted  alteration was not found in the transcripts. Our results demonstrate that the  effects of splicing mutations in NF2 are often complex and that information  theory based analysis is helpful in elucidating the consequences of these  mutations.

Moyamoya is a cerebrovascular angiopathy characterized by a progressive stenosis  of the terminal part of the intracranial carotid arteries and the compensatory  development of abnormal and fragile collateral vessels, also called moyamoya  vessels, leading to ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Moyamoya angiopathy can  either be the sole manifestation of the disease (moyamoya disease) or be  associated with various conditions, including neurofibromatosis, Down syndrome,  TAAD (autosomal-dominant thoracic aortic aneurysm), and radiotherapy of head  tumors (moyamoya syndromes). Its prevalence is ten times higher in Japan than in  Europe, and an estimated 6%-12% of moyamoya disease is familial in Japan. The  pathophysiological mechanisms of this condition remain obscure. Here, we report  on three unrelated families affected with an X-linked moyamoya syndrome  characterized by the association of a moyamoya angiopathy, short stature, and a  stereotyped facial dysmorphism. Other symptoms include an hypergonadotropic  hypogonadism, hypertension, dilated cardiomyopathy, premature coronary heart  disease, premature hair graying, and early bilateral acquired cataract. We show  that this syndromic moyamoya is caused by Xq28 deletions removing MTCP1/MTCP1NB  and BRCC3. We also show that brcc3 morphant zebrafish display angiogenesis  defects that are rescued by endothelium-specific expression of brcc3.  Altogether, these data strongly suggest that BRCC3, a deubiquitinating enzyme  that is part of the cellular BRCA1 and BRISC complexes, is an important player  in angiogenesis and that BRCC3 loss-of-function mutations are associated with  moyamoya angiopathy.

Author information: (1)Mouse Cancer Genetics Program, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer  Institute-Frederick, Frederick, MD, USA  A growing body of work suggests that astrocytomas and glioblastoma multiforme  will require carefully tailored, molecularly targeted therapy for successful  treatment. Recent efforts to comprehensively identify mutations and gene  expression changes in glioblastoma have shown that mutation of NF1 is a common  alteration in human glioblastoma. We have developed and characterized a panel of  14 tumor lines from grades II through IV astrocytomas developed from our  Nf1-/+;Trp53-/+cis mouse model and have used this panel to characterize signal  transduction pathways and inhibitors that are candidate therapeutic targets for  astrocytoma and glioblastoma. We show that these tumors express platelet-derived  growth factor receptor-α, epidermal growth factor receptor, and their respective  ligands to varying degrees. We find that both the MEK and PI3K signaling  pathways downstream of epidermal growth factor receptor and platelet-derived  growth factor receptor-α are necessary for full proliferation of astrocytoma  cells; however, inhibition of the PI3K pathway is more effective than inhibition  of MEK at blocking cell growth. We have examined inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR  signaling pathway and find that PI-103 and TCN show particular promise for  inhibiting growth in Nf1 and Trp53 mutant astrocytoma cells.

Ahmad ZK(1), Brown CM, Cueva RA, Ryan AF, Doherty JK.  Author information: (1)Division of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Department of Surgery,  University of California, San Diego, California, USA.  BACKGROUND: Pharmacologic agents targeted against the ErbB family, or the  intracellular pathways that mediate their effects, could slow clinical  progression of vestibular schwannoma (VS) in patients where other modalities  carry a high risk-to-benefit ratio. OBJECTIVE: Determine the identity of the predominant ErbB dimer partners in VS  tumors and assess the effects of targeted inhibition of the ErbB molecules on VS  growth and proliferation, as well as apoptosis. SETTING: Academic tertiary referral center. METHODS: Coimmunoprecipitation and Western blotting of VS tissue, in vitro BrdU  assays of proliferation in the presence of lapatinib and tyrphostin (AG825)  using primary VS cultures, and annexin V cell death assays and cell cycle assays  using propidium iodide staining were performed on HEI193 cell line derived from  an neurofibromatosis type 2-associated VS. RESULTS: Activated ErbB family receptor heterodimers in VS contain predominantly  epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ErbB2. A robust, dose-dependent  inhibition of VS growth and proliferation with the dual EGFR/ErbB2 inhibitor,  lapatinib, was demonstrated. Lapatinib also inhibited EGF-induced VS  proliferation. The selective ErbB2 inhibitor, AG825, inhibited growth to a  lesser extent. HEI193 demonstrated apoptosis after lapatinib treatment. CONCLUSION: Dual EGFR and ErbB2 inhibition with lapatinib or combination therapy  may provide therapeutic benefit in VS treatment, but further studies are  necessary.

Buchberg AM(1), Bedigian HG, Jenkins NA, Copeland NG.  Author information: (1)Mammalian Genetics Laboratory, NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development  Center, Frederick, Maryland 21702.  BXH-2 mice have the highest incidence of spontaneous retrovirally induced  myeloid leukemia of any known inbred strain and, as such, represent a valuable  model system for identifying cellular proto-oncogenes involved in myeloid  disease. Chronic murine leukemia viruses often induce disease by insertional  activation or mutation of cellular proto-oncogenes. These loci are identified as  common viral integration sites in tumor DNAs. Here we report on the  characterization of a novel common viral integration site in BXH-2 myeloid  leukemias, designated Evi-2. Within the cluster of viral integration sites that  define Evi-2, we identified a gene that has the potential for encoding a novel  protein of 223 amino acids. This putative proto-oncogene possesses all of the  structural features of a transmembrane protein. Within the transmembrane domain  is a ""leucine zipper,"" suggesting that Evi-2 is involved in either homopolymer  or heteropolymer formation, which may play an important role in the normal  functioning of Evi-2. Interestingly, the human homolog of Evi-2 has recently  been shown to be tightly linked to the von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis  locus, suggesting a role for Evi-2 in human disease as well.

Wiesner SM(1), Geurts JL, Diers MD, Bergerson RJ, Hasz DE, Morgan KJ,  Largaespada DA.  Author information: (1)Center for Allied Health Programs, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis,  55455, USA.  Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia (JMML) is a relentlessly progressive  myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic (MPD/MDS) hematopoietic disorder more common  in patients with any one of at least three distinct genetic lesions,  specifically NF1 gene loss and PTPN11 and NRAS mutations. NF1 and PTPN11 are  molecular lesions associated with Neurofibromatosis Syndrome Type I (NF1  Syndrome) and Noonan's Syndrome, respectively. The occurrence of JMML is rare;  even among those predisposed with these syndromes to development of disease, and  secondary genetic events likely contribute to the development and progression of  disease. In NF1 syndrome, loss of p53 function is a common event in solid  tumors, but uncommon in JMML, suggesting that the p53 pathway may be modified by  other events in this hematopoietic disorder. The work presented here  investigates the possible role of the p19(Arf) (p19) tumor suppressor in  development of MPD associated with Nf1 gene loss in mice. We find that Nf1  mutant hematopoietic cells with loss of p19 develop accelerated hematopoietic  disease similar to acute leukemia with a variable phenotype. This suggests that  p19 may play a role in development of JMML and evaluation of the human p19  homolog (p14(ARF)) in JMML may be informative.  Copyright © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Zhan Y(1), Chadee DN.  Author information: (1)Department of Biological Sciences; University of Toledo; Toledo, OH USA.  Mammalian mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways respond to  diverse extracellular signals and coordinate a range of cellular responses.  Mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3) is a member of the mixed lineage kinase family of  MAPK kinase kinases (MAP3Ks) that functions to regulate multiple MAPK signaling  pathways. Activated forms of the Rho GTP ases, Rac and Cdc42, interact with MLK3  through the Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding (CRIB) motif and promote MLK3  catalytic activity. Our recent findings demonstrate that merlin, the product of  the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene, is a physiological  inhibitor of MLK3. Our results suggest that merlin inhibits MLK3 activity by  blocking the Cdc42-MLK3 interaction. In this commentary, the effect of merlin on  Cdc42-mediated activation of MLK3 and MAPK signaling will be discussed.

Author information: (1)Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Norris Cotton Cancer Center,  Dartmouth Medical School, 7650 Remsen, Hanover, NH 03755, USA.  Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a life-threatening  complication of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). NF1 is caused by mutation in the  gene encoding neurofibromin, a negative regulator of Ras signaling. There are no  effective pharmacologic therapies for MPNST. To identify new therapeutic  approaches targeting this dangerous malignancy, we developed assays in NF1(+/+)  and NF1(-/-) MPNST cell lines and in budding yeast lacking the NF1 homologue  IRA2 (ira2Δ). Here, we describe UC1, a small molecule that targets NF1(-/-) cell  lines and ira2Δ budding yeast. By using yeast genetics, we identified NAB3 as a  high-copy suppressor of UC1 sensitivity. NAB3 encodes an RNA binding protein  that associates with the C-terminal domain of RNA Pol II and plays a role in the  termination of nonpolyadenylated RNA transcripts. Strains with deletion of IRA2  are sensitive to genetic inactivation of NAB3, suggesting an interaction between  Ras signaling and Nab3-dependent transcript termination. This work identifies a  lead compound and a possible target pathway for NF1-associated MPNST, and shows  a novel model system approach to identify and validate target pathways for  cancer cells in which NF1 loss drives tumor formation.

Author information: (1)Institute of Medical Genetics, Charité, Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Humboldt  University, Augustenburger Platz 1, D-13353 Berlin, Germany.  kolanshy@molgen.mpg.de  BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a frequent genetic disease  characterized by multiple benign tumours with increased risk for malignancy.  There is currently no biomarker for tumour load in NF1 patients. METHODS: In situ hybridization and quantitative real-time polymerase reaction  were applied to investigate expression of cartilage-specific genes in mice  bearing conditional inactivation of NF1 in the developing limbs. These mice do  not develop tumours but recapitulate aspects of NF1 bone dysplasia, including  deregulation of cartilage differentiation. It has been recently shown that NF1  tumours require for their growth the master regulator of cartilage  differentiation SOX9. We thus hypothesized that some of the cartilage-specific  genes deregulated in an Nf1Prx1 mouse model might prove to be relevant  biomarkers of NF1 tumours. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing expression of  the SOX9 target gene product melanoma-inhibitory activity/cd-rap (MIA) in tumour  and serum samples of NF1 patients. RESULTS: Increased expression of Mia was found in Nf1-deficient cartilage in  mice. In humans, MIA was expressed in all NF1-related tumours and its serum  levels were significantly higher in NF1 patients than in healthy controls. Among  NF1 patients, MIA serum levels were significantly higher in those with plexiform  neurofibromas and in those with large number of cutaneous (> 1,000) or  subcutaneous (> 100) neurofibromas than in patients without such tumours. Most  notably, MIA serum levels correlated significantly with internal tumour burden. CONCLUSIONS: MIA is a potential serum biomarker of tumour load in NF1 patients  which could be useful in following the disease course and monitoring the  efficacy of therapies.

PMID:21727212,Nilotinib alone or in combination with selumetinib is a drug candidate for neurofibromatosis type 2.,"Nilotinib alone or in combination with selumetinib is a drug candidate for  neurofibromatosis type 2.  Ammoun S(1), Schmid MC, Triner J, Manley P, Hanemann CO.  Author information: (1)Clinical Neurobiology, Peninsula College for Medicine and Dentistry, The John  Bull Building, Tamar Science Park, Research Way, Plymouth PL6 8BU, United  Kingdom.  Loss of the tumor suppressor merlin is a cause of frequent tumors of the nervous  system, such as schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas, which occur  spontaneously or as part of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). Because there is  medical need for drug therapies for these tumors, our aim is to find therapeutic  targets. We have studied the pathobiology of schwannomas, because they are the  most common merlin-deficient tumors and are a model for all merlin-deficient  tumors. With use of a human schwannoma in vitro model, we previously described  strong overexpression/activation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β  (PDGFR-β) leading to strong, long-lasting activation of  extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and AKT and increased schwannoma  growth, which we successfully inhibited using the PDGFR/Raf inhibitor sorafenib.  However, the benign character of schwannomas may require long-term treatment;  thus, drug tolerability is an issue. With the use of Western blotting,  proliferation assays, viability assays, and a primary human schwannoma cell in  vitro model, we tested the PDGFR/c-KIT inhibitors imatinib (Glivec(;) Novartis)  and nilotinib (Tasigna(;) Novartis). Imatinib and nilotinib inhibited  PDGF-DD-mediated ERK1/2 activation, basal and PDGF-DD-mediated activation of  PDGFR-β and AKT, and schwannoma proliferation. Nilotinib is more potent than  imatinib, exerting its maximal inhibitory effect at concentrations lower than  steady-state trough plasma levels. In addition, nilotinib combined with the  MEK1/2 inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244) at low concentrations displayed stronger  efficiency toward tumor growth inhibition, compared with nilotinib alone. We  suggest that therapy with nilotinib or combinational therapy that   simultaneously inhibits PDGFR and the downstream Raf/MEK1/2/ERK1/2 pathway  could represent an effective treatment for schwannomas and other  merlin-deficient tumors.

Ma J(1), Li M, Hock J, Yu X.  Author information: (1)West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, People's Republic of China.  Individuals with nerofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) frequently suffer a spectrum of  bone pathologies, such as abnormal skeletal development (scoliosis, congenital  bowing, and congenital pseudoarthroses, etc), lower bone mineral density with  increased fracture risk. These skeletal problems may result, in part, from  abnormal osteoclastogenesis. Enhanced RAS/PI3K activity has been reported to  contribute to abnormal osteoclastogenesis in Nf1 heterozygous (Nf1+/-) mice.  However, the specific downstream pathways linked to NF1 abnormal  osteoclastogenesis have not been defined. Our aim was to determine whether  mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was a key effector responsible for abnormal  osteoclastogenesis in NF1. Primary osteoclast-like cells (OCLs) were cultured  from Nf1 wild-type (Nf1+/+) and Nf1+/- mice. Compared to Nf1+/+ controls, there  were 20% more OCLs induced from Nf1+/- mice. Nf1+/- OCLs were larger and  contained more nuclei. Hyperactive mTOR signaling was detected in Nf1+/- OCLs.  Inhibition of mTOR signaling by rapamycin in Nf1+/- OCLs abrogated abnormalities  in cellular size and number. Moreover, we found that hyperactive mTOR signaling  induced abnormal osteoclastogenesis major through hyper-proliferation. Our  research suggests that neurofibromin directly regulates osteoclastogenesis  through mTOR signaling pathway. Inhibiting mTOR may represent a viable strategy  to treat NF1 bone diseases.

Laulajainen M(1), Muranen T, Nyman TA, Carpén O, Grönholm M.  Author information: (1)Biomedicum Helsinki, Department of Pathology, University of Helsinki,  Helsinki, Finland. Minja.Pehrsson@helsinki.fi  Mutations in the Neurofibromatosis 2 gene (NF2) predispose to tumors of the  nervous system, mainly schwannomas and meningiomas. The NF2 gene encodes for the  tumor suppressor protein merlin (moesin-ezrin-radixin-like protein), which  functions as a linker between the plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton.  Carboxyterminal phosphorylation affects merlin activity, but many open questions  on the regulation of merlin function still remain. The phosphoinositide  3-kinase/Akt pathway is activated in human vestibular schwannoma, suggesting a  role for Akt-dependent merlin regulation in the formation of these tumors. In  this study, we identify merlin serine 10 as a novel substrate for Akt  phosphorylation. We demonstrate that this N-terminal phosphorylation directs  merlin for proteasome-mediated degradation and affects merlin binding to the E3  ligase component DCAF1. Our data indicate that sequential phosphorylation of  merlin C- and N-terminus by different oncogenic kinases targets merlin for  degradation and thus downregulates its activity. On the basis of these findings,  we propose a model for a posttranslational mechanism of merlin inactivation.

Author information: (1)Department of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery, The Ohio State  University, Columbus, OH 43212, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal-dominant disease that results in  the formation of bilateral vestibular schwannomas (VSs) and multiple  meningiomas. Treatment options for NF2-associated tumors are limited, and to  date, no medical therapies are FDA approved. The ideal chemotherapeutic agent  would inhibit both VS and meningiomas simultaneously. The objectives of this  study are (1) to test the efficacy of AR42, a novel histone deacetylase  inhibitor, to inhibit VS and meningioma growth and (2) to investigate this  drug's mechanisms of action. Primary cultures of human VS and meningioma cells  were established. Nf2-deficient mouse schwannoma and benign human meningioma  Ben-Men-1 cells were also cultured. Cells were treated with AR42, and the drug's  effects on proliferation and the cell cycle were analyzed using a  methanethiosulfonate assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Human  phospho-kinase arrays and Western blots were used to evaluate the effects of  AR42 on intracellular signaling. The in vivo efficacy of AR42 was investigated  using schwannoma xenografts. Tumor volumes were quantified using high-field,  volumetric MRI, and molecular target analysis was performed using  immunohistochemistry. AR42 inhibited the growth of primary human VS and  Nf2-deficient mouse schwannoma cells with a half maximal inhibitory  concentration (IC(50)) of 500 nM and 250-350 nM, respectively. AR42 also  inhibited primary meningioma cells and the benign meningioma cell line,  Ben-Men-1, with IC(50) values of 1.5 µM and 1.0 µM, respectively. AR42 treatment  induced cell-cycle arrest at G(2) and apoptosis in both VS and meningioma cells.  Also, AR42 exposure decreased phosphorylated Akt in schwannoma and meningioma  cells. In vivo treatment with AR42 inhibited the growth of schwannoma  xenografts, induced apoptosis, and decreased Akt activation. The potent growth  inhibitory activity of AR42 in schwannoma and meningioma cells suggests that  AR42 should be further evaluated as a potential treatment for NF2-associated  tumors.

Brossier NM(1), Carroll SL.  Author information: (1)Department of Cell Biology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham,  AL 35294-0017, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), the most common genetic disorder affecting the  human nervous system, is characterized by the development of multiple benign  Schwann cell tumors in skin and large peripheral nerves. These neoplasms, which  are termed dermal and plexiform neurofibromas respectively, have distinct  clinical courses; of particular note, plexiform, but not dermal, neurofibromas  often undergo malignant progression to form malignant peripheral nerve sheath  tumors (MPNSTs), the most common malignancy occurring in NF1 patients. In recent  years, a number of genetically engineered mouse models have been created to  investigate the molecular mechanisms driving the pathogenesis of these tumors.  These models have been designed to address key questions including: (1) whether  NF1 loss in the Schwann cell lineage is essential for tumorigenesis; (2) what  cell type(s) in the Schwann cell lineage gives rise to dermal neurofibromas,  plexiform neurofibromas and MPNSTs; (3) how the tumor microenvironment  contributes to neoplasia; (4) what additional mutations contribute to  neurofibroma-MPNST progression; (5) what role different neurofibromin-regulated  Ras proteins play in this process and (6) how dysregulated growth factor  signaling facilitates PNS tumorigenesis. In this review, we summarize the major  findings from each of these models and their limitations as well as how  discrepancies between these models may be reconciled. We also discuss how  information gleaned from these models can be synthesized to into a comprehensive  model of tumor formation in peripheral nervous system and consider several of  the major questions that remain unanswered about this process.

As a consequence of the accumulation of insertion events over evolutionary time,  mobile elements now comprise nearly half of the human genome. The Alu, L1, and  SVA mobile element families are still duplicating, generating variation between  individual genomes. Mobile element insertions (MEI) have been identified as  causes for genetic diseases, including hemophilia, neurofibromatosis, and  various cancers. Here we present a comprehensive map of 7,380 MEI polymorphisms  from the 1000 Genomes Project whole-genome sequencing data of 185 samples in  three major populations detected with two detection methods. This catalog  enables us to systematically study mutation rates, population segregation,  genomic distribution, and functional properties of MEI polymorphisms and to  compare MEI to SNP variation from the same individuals. Population allele  frequencies of MEI and SNPs are described, broadly, by the same neutral  ancestral processes despite vastly different mutation mechanisms and rates,  except in coding regions where MEI are virtually absent, presumably due to  strong negative selection. A direct comparison of MEI and SNP diversity levels  suggests a differential mobile element insertion rate among populations.

Author information: (1)Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, University of  Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska 68198, USA.  Recent genetic studies in Drosophila identified Kibra as a novel regulator of  the Hippo pathway, which controls tissue growth and tumorigenesis by inhibiting  cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis. The cellular function and regulation  of human KIBRA remain largely unclear. Here, we show that KIBRA is a  phosphoprotein and that phosphorylation of KIBRA is regulated in a cell  cycle-dependent manner with the highest level of phosphorylated KIBRA detected  in mitosis. We further demonstrate that the mitotic kinases Aurora-A and -B  phosphorylate KIBRA both in vitro and in vivo. We identified the highly  conserved Ser(539) as the primary phosphorylation site for Aurora kinases.  Moreover, we found that wild-type, but not catalytically inactive, protein  phosphatase 1 (PP1) associates with KIBRA. PP1 dephosphorylated  Aurora-phosphorylated KIBRA. KIBRA depletion impaired the interaction between  Aurora-A and PP1. We also show that KIBRA associates with neurofibromatosis type  2/Merlin in a Ser(539) phosphorylation-dependent manner. Phosphorylation of  KIBRA on Ser(539) plays a role in mitotic progression. Our results suggest that  KIBRA is a physiological substrate of Aurora kinases and reveal a new avenue  between KIBRA/Hippo signaling and the mitotic machinery.

Banerjee S(1), Crouse NR, Emnett RJ, Gianino SM, Gutmann DH.  Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis,  MO 63110, USA.  Converging evidence from the analysis of human brain tumors and genetically  engineered mice has revealed that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)  pathway is a central regulator of glial and glioma cell growth. In this regard,  mutational inactivation of neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1), tuberous sclerosis complex  (TSC), and PTEN genes is associated with glioma formation, such that  pharmacologic inhibition of mTOR signaling results in attenuated tumor growth.  This shared dependence on mTOR suggests that PTEN and NF1 (neurofibromin) glial  growth regulation requires TSC/Rheb (Ras homolog enriched in brain) control of  mTOR function. In this report, we use a combination of genetic silencing in  vitro and conditional mouse transgenesis approaches in vivo to demonstrate that  neurofibromin regulates astrocyte cell growth and glioma formation in a  TSC/Rheb-independent fashion. First, we show that Nf1 or Pten inactivation, but  not Tsc1 loss or Rheb overexpression, increases astrocyte cell growth in vitro.  Second, Nf1-deficient increased mTOR signaling and astrocyte hyperproliferation  is unaffected by Rheb shRNA silencing. Third, conditional Tsc1 inactivation or  Rheb overexpression in glial progenitors of Nf1(+/-) mice does not lead to  glioma formation. Collectively, these findings establish TSC/Rheb-independent  mechanisms for mTOR-dependent glial cell growth control and gliomagenesis  relevant to the design of therapies for individuals with glioma.

Children with the neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) cancer predisposition syndrome  exhibit numerous clinical problems that reflect defective central nervous system  (CNS) neuronal function, including learning disabilities, attention deficit  disorder, and seizures. These clinical features result from reduced NF1 protein  (neurofibromin) expression in NF1+/- (NF1 heterozygosity) brain neurons.  Previous studies have shown that mouse CNS neurons are sensitive to the effects  of reduced Nf1 expression and exhibit shorter neurite lengths, smaller growth  cone areas, and attenuated survival, reflecting attenuated neurofibromin cAMP  regulation. In striking contrast, Nf1+/- peripheral nervous system (PNS) neurons  are nearly indistinguishable from their wild-type counterparts, and complete  neurofibromin loss leads to increased neurite lengths and survival in a  RAS/Akt-dependent fashion. To gain insights into the differential responses of  CNS and PNS neurons to reduced neurofibromin function, we designed a series of  experiments to define the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the unique CNS  neuronal sensitivity to Nf1 heterozygosity. First, Nf1 heterozygosity decreases  cAMP levels in CNS, but not in PNS, neurons. Second, CNS neurons exhibit Nf1  gene-dependent increases in RAS pathway signaling, but no further decreases in  cAMP levels were observed in Nf1-/- CNS neurons relative to their Nf1+/-  counterparts. Third, neurofibromin regulates CNS neurite length and growth cone  areas in a cAMP/PKA/Rho/ROCK-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo.  Collectively, these findings establish cAMP/PKA/Rho/ROCK signaling as the  responsible axis underlying abnormal Nf1+/- CNS neuronal morphology with  important implications for future preclinical and clinical studies aimed at  improving cognitive and behavioral deficits in mice and children with reduced  brain neuronal NF1 gene expression.

Hambardzumyan D(1), Cheng YK, Haeno H, Holland EC, Michor F.  Author information: (1)Department of Regenerative Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio,  United States of America.  Primary glioblastomas are subdivided into several molecular subtypes. There is  an ongoing debate over the cell of origin for these tumor types where some  suggest a progenitor while others argue for a stem cell origin. Even within the  same molecular subgroup, and using lineage tracing in mouse models, different  groups have reached different conclusions. We addressed this problem from a  combined mathematical modeling and experimental standpoint. We designed a novel  mathematical framework to identify the most likely cells of origin of two glioma  subtypes. Our mathematical model of the unperturbed in vivo system predicts that  if a genetic event contributing to tumor initiation imparts symmetric  self-renewing cell division (such as PDGF overexpression), then the cell of  origin is a transit amplifier. Otherwise, the initiating mutations arise in stem  cells. The mathematical framework was validated with the RCAS/tv-a system of  somatic gene transfer in mice. We demonstrated that PDGF-induced gliomas can be  derived from GFAP-expressing cells of the subventricular zone or the cortex  (reactive astrocytes), thus validating the predictions of our mathematical  model. This interdisciplinary approach allowed us to determine the likelihood  that individual cell types serve as the cells of origin of gliomas in an  unperturbed system.

Wang Y(1), Brittain JM, Wilson SM, Hingtgen CM, Khanna R.  Author information: (1)Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Indiana University School of  Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.  Mutations of the neurofibromin gene (NF1) cause neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1),  a disease in which learning disabilities are common. Learning deficits also are  observed in mice with a heterozygous mutation of Nf1 (Nf1(+/-)). Dysregulation  of regulated neurotransmitter release has been observed in Nf1(+/-) mice.  However, the role of presynaptic voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels mediating this  release has not been investigated. We investigated whether Ca(2+) currents and  transmitter release were affected by reduced neurofibromin in Nf1(+/-) mice.  Hippocampal Ca(2+) current density was greater in neurons from Nf1(+/-) mice and  a greater fraction of Ca(2+) currents was activated at less depolarized  potentials. In addition, release of the excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate,  was increased in neuronal cortical cultures from Nf1(+/-) mice. Dendritic  complexity and axonal length were also increased in neurons Nf1(+/-) mice  compared to wild-type neurons, linking loss of neurofibromin to developmental  changes in hippocampal axonal/cytoskeletal dynamics. Collectively, these results  show that altered Ca(2+) channel density and transmitter release, along with  increased axonal growth may account for the abnormal nervous system functioning  in NF1.

Author information: (1)Institute of Cellular and Developmental Biology, Biomedical Sciences Research  Centre ""Alexander Fleming,"" Vari, Greece.  Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (Alk) is a Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) activated  in several cancers, but with largely unknown physiological functions. We report  two unexpected roles for the Drosophila ortholog dAlk, in body size  determination and associative learning. Remarkably, reducing neuronal dAlk  activity increased body size and enhanced associative learning, suggesting that  its activation is inhibitory in both processes. Consistently, dAlk activation  reduced body size and caused learning deficits resembling phenotypes of null  mutations in dNf1, the Ras GTPase Activating Protein-encoding conserved ortholog  of the Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) disease gene. We show that dAlk and dNf1  co-localize extensively and interact functionally in the nervous system.  Importantly, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of dAlk rescued the reduced  body size, adult learning deficits, and Extracellular-Regulated-Kinase (ERK)  overactivation dNf1 mutant phenotypes. These results identify dAlk as an  upstream activator of dNf1-regulated Ras signaling responsible for several dNf1  defects, and they implicate human Alk as a potential therapeutic target in NF1.

Author information: (1)Departments of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine,  Indianapolis, Indiana, United States of America.  The extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1 and 2) are widely-expressed and  they modulate proliferation, survival, differentiation, and protein synthesis in  multiple cell lineages. Altered ERK1/2 signaling is found in several genetic  diseases with skeletal phenotypes, including Noonan syndrome, Neurofibromatosis  type 1, and Cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome, suggesting that MEK-ERK signals  regulate human skeletal development. Here, we examine the consequence of Erk1  and Erk2 disruption in multiple functions of osteoclasts, specialized  macrophage/monocyte lineage-derived cells that resorb bone. We demonstrate that  Erk1 positively regulates osteoclast development and bone resorptive activity,  as genetic disruption of Erk1 reduced osteoclast progenitor cell numbers,  compromised pit formation, and diminished M-CSF-mediated adhesion and migration.  Moreover, WT mice reconstituted long-term with Erk1(-/-) bone marrow mononuclear  cells (BMMNCs) demonstrated increased bone mineral density as compared to  recipients transplanted with WT and Erk2(-/-) BMMNCs, implicating marrow  autonomous, Erk1-dependent osteoclast function.

Author information: (1)Università degli Studi di Milano, UO Oculistica, Fondazione IRCCS Cà Granda  Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy. francesco.viola@unimi.it  OBJECTIVE: To investigate in a large sample of consecutive patients with  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) the possibility of including the presence of  choroidal abnormalities detected by near-infrared reflectance (NIR) as a new  diagnostic criterion for NF1. DESIGN: Cross-sectional evaluation of a diagnostic test. PARTICIPANTS AND CONTROLS: Ninety-five consecutive adult and pediatric patients  (190 eyes) with NF1, diagnosed based on the National Institutes of Health (NIH)  criteria. Controls included 100 healthy age- and gender-matched control  subjects. METHODS: Confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy was performed for each subject,  investigating the presence and the number of choroidal abnormalities. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy for the  different cutoff values of the criterion choroidal nodules detected by NIR  compared with the NIH criteria. RESULTS: Choroidal nodules detected by NIR imaging were present in 79 (82%) of  95 of the NF1 patients, including 15 (71%) of the 21 NF1 pediatric patients.  Similar abnormalities were present in 7 (7%) of 100 healthy subjects, including  2 (8%) of the 25 healthy pediatric subjects. The highest accuracy was obtained  at the cutoff value of 1.5 choroidal nodules detected by NIR imagery.  Sensitivity and specificity of the examination at the optimal cutoff point were  83% and 96%, respectively. Diagnostic accuracy was 90% in the overall population  and 83% in the pediatric population. Both of these values were in line with the  most common NIH diagnostic criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Choroidal abnormalities appearing as bright patchy nodules detected  by NIR imaging frequently occurred in NF1 patients. The present study shows that  NIR examination to detect choroidal involvement should be considered as a new  diagnostic criterion for NF1.  Copyright © 2012 American Academy of Ophthalmology.

Attention system abnormalities represent a significant barrier to scholastic  achievement in children with neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1). Using a novel mouse  model of NF1-associated attention deficit (ADD), we demonstrate a presynaptic  defect in striatal dopaminergic homeostasis and leverage this finding to apply  [(11)C]-raclopride positron-emission tomography (PET) in the intact animal.  While methylphenidate and l-Deprenyl correct both striatal dopamine levels on  PET imaging and defective attention system function in Nf1 mutant mice,  pharmacologic agents that target de-regulated cyclic AMP and RAS signaling in  these mice do not. These studies establish a robust preclinical model to  evaluate promising agents for NF1-associated ADD.  Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine,  Indianapolis, Indiana, United States of America.  Germline mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene cause neurofibromatosis type  1 (NF1), a complex genetic disorder with a high predisposition of numerous  skeletal dysplasias including short stature, osteoporosis, kyphoscoliosis, and  fracture non-union (pseudoarthrosis). We have developed murine models that  phenocopy many of the skeletal dysplasias observed in NF1 patients, including  reduced bone mass and fracture non-union. We also show that the development of  these skeletal manifestations requires an Nf1 haploinsufficient background in  addition to nullizygous loss of Nf1 in mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSCs)  and/or their progenies. This is replicated in two animal models of NF1,  PeriCre(+);Nf1(flox/-) and Col2.3Cre(+);Nf1(flox/-) mice. Adoptive transfer  experiments demonstrate a critical role of the Nf1+/- marrow microenvironment in  the impaired fracture healing in both models and adoptive transfer of WT bone  marrow cells improves fracture healing in these mice. To our knowledge, this is  the first demonstration of a non-cell autonomous mechanism in non-malignant NF1  manifestations. Collectively, these data provide evidence of a combinatory  effect between nullizygous loss of Nf1 in osteoblast progenitors and  haploinsufficiency in hematopoietic cells in the development of non-malignant  NF1 manifestations.

Yogesha SD(1), Sharff AJ, Giovannini M, Bricogne G, Izard T.  Author information: (1)Cell Adhesion Laboratory, Department of Cancer Biology, The Scripps Research  Institute, Jupiter, Florida 33458, USA.  The merlin-1 tumor suppressor is encoded by the Neurofibromatosis-2 (Nf2) gene  and loss-of-function Nf2 mutations lead to nervous system tumors in man and to  several tumor types in mice. Merlin is an ERM (ezrin, radixin, moesin) family  cytoskeletal protein that interacts with other ERM proteins and with components  of cell-cell adherens junctions (AJs). Merlin stabilizes the links of AJs to the  actin cytoskeleton. Thus, its loss destabilizes AJs, promoting cell migration  and invasion, which in Nf2(+/-) mice leads to highly metastatic tumors.  Paradoxically, the ""closed"" conformation of merlin-1, where its N-terminal  four-point-one, ezrin, radixin, moesin (FERM) domain binds to its C-terminal  tail domain, directs its tumor suppressor functions. Here we report the crystal  structure of the human merlin-1 head domain when crystallized in the presence of  its tail domain. Remarkably, unlike other ERM head-tail interactions, this  structure suggests that binding of the tail provokes dimerization and dynamic  movement and unfurling of the F2 motif of the FERM domain. We conclude the  ""closed"" tumor suppressor conformer of merlin-1 is in fact an ""open"" dimer whose  functions are disabled by Nf2 mutations that disrupt this architecture.

Staser K(1), Yang FC, Clapp DW.  Author information: (1)Department of Biochemistry, Indiana University School of Medicine,  Indianapolis, Indiana 46202, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disease that results from either  heritable or spontaneous autosomal dominant mutations in the NF1 gene. A  second-hit mutation precedes the predominant NF1 neoplasms, which include  myeloid leukemia, optic glioma, and plexiform neurofibroma. Despite this  requisite NF1 loss of heterozygosity in the tumor cell of origin, nontumorigenic  cells contribute to both generalized and specific disease manifestations. In  mouse models of plexiform neurofibroma formation, Nf1 haploinsufficient mast  cells promote inflammation, accelerating tumor formation and growth. These  recruited mast cells, hematopoietic effector cells long known to permeate  neurofibroma tissue, mediate key mitogenic signals that contribute to vascular  ingrowth, collagen deposition, and tumor growth. Thus, the plexiform  neurofibroma microenvironment involves a tumor/stromal interaction with the  hematopoietic system that depends, at the molecular level, on a stem cell  factor/c-kit-mediated signaling axis. These observations parallel findings in  other NF1 disease manifestations and are clearly relevant to medical management  of these neurofibromas.

Author information: (1)Institute of Medical Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Heath  Park Way, Cardiff, UK.  Neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1), caused by heterozygous inactivation of the NF1  tumour suppressor gene, is associated with the development of benign and  malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs). Although numerous germline  NF1 mutations have been identified, relatively few somatic NF1 mutations have  been described in neurofibromas. Here we have screened 109 cutaneous  neurofibromas, excised from 46 unrelated NF1 patients, for somatic NF1  mutations. NF1 mutation screening (involving loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH)  analysis, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and DNA sequencing)  identified 77 somatic NF1 point mutations, of which 53 were novel. LOH spanning  the NF1 gene region was evident in 25 neurofibromas, but in contrast to previous  data from MPNSTs, it was absent at the TP53, CDKN2A and RB1 gene loci. Analysis  of DNA/RNA from neurofibroma-derived Schwann cell cultures revealed NF1  mutations in four tumours whose presence had been overlooked in the tumour DNA.  Bioinformatics analysis suggested that four of seven novel somatic NF1 missense  mutations (p.A330T, p.Q519P, p.A776T, p.S1463F) could be of functional/clinical  significance. Functional analysis confirmed this prediction for p.S1463F,  located within the GTPase-activating protein-related domain, as this mutation  resulted in a 150-fold increase in activated GTP-bound Ras. Comparison of the  relative frequencies of the different types of somatic NF1 mutation observed  with those of their previously reported germline counterparts revealed  significant (P=0.001) differences. Although non-identical somatic mutations  involving either the same or adjacent nucleotides were identified in three pairs  of tumours from the same patients (P<0.0002), no association was noted between  the type of germline and somatic NF1 lesion within the same individual.

Author information: (1)Division Human Genetics, Medical University Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.  katharina.wimmer@i-med.ac.at  Long interspersed (L1) and Alu elements are actively amplified in the human  genome through retrotransposition of their RNA intermediates by the -100 still  retrotranspositionally fully competent L1 elements. Retrotransposition can cause  inherited disease if such an element is inserted near or within a functional  gene. Using direct cDNA sequencing as the primary assay for comprehensive NF1  mutation analysis, we uncovered in 18 unrelated index patients splicing  alterations not readily explained at the genomic level by an underlying  point-mutation or deletion. Improved PCR protocols avoiding allelic drop-out of  the mutant alleles uncovered insertions of fourteen Alu elements, three L1  elements, and one poly(T) stretch to cause these splicing defects. Taken  together, the 18 pathogenic L1 endonuclease-mediated de novo insertions  represent the largest number of this type of mutations characterized in a single  human gene. Our findings show that retrotransposon insertions account for as  many as -0.4% of all NF1 mutations. Since altered splicing was the main effect  of the inserted elements, the current finding was facilitated by the use of  RNA-based mutation analysis protocols, resulting in improved detection compared  to gDNA-based approaches. Six different insertions clustered in a relatively  small 1.5-kb region (NF1 exons 21(16)-23(18)) within the 280-kb NF1 gene.  Furthermore, three different specific integration sites, one of them located in  this cluster region, were each used twice, i.e. NM_000267.3(NF1):c.1642-1_1642  in intron 14(10c), NM_000267.3(NF1):c.2835_2836 in exon 21(16), and  NM_000267.3(NF1):c.4319_4320 in exon 33(25). Identification of three loci that  each served twice as integration site for independent retrotransposition events  as well as 1.5-kb cluster region harboring six independent insertions supports  the notion of non-random insertion of retrotransposons in the human genome.  Currently, little is known about which features make sites particularly  vulnerable to L1 EN-mediated insertions. The here identified integration sites  may serve to elucidate these features in future studies.

PMID:22384355,The SPRED1 Variants Repository for Legius Syndrome.,"The SPRED1 Variants Repository for Legius Syndrome.  Sumner K, Crockett DK, Muram T, Mallempati K, Best H, Mao R.  Legius syndrome (LS) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by germline  loss-of-function mutations in the sprouty-related, EVH1 domain containing 1  (SPRED1) gene. The phenotype of LS is multiple café au lait macules (CALM) with  other commonly reported manifestations, including intertriginous freckling,  lipomas, macrocephaly, and learning disabilities including ADHD and  developmental delays. Since the earliest signs of LS and neurofibromatosis type  1 (NF1) syndrome are pigmentary findings, the two are indistinguishable and  individuals with LS may meet the National Institutes of Health diagnostic  criteria for NF1 syndrome. However, individuals are not known to have an  increased risk for developing tumors (compared with NF1 patients). It is  therefore important to fully characterize the phenotype differences between NF1  and LS because the prognoses of these two disorders differ greatly. We have  developed a mutation database that characterizes the known variants in the  SPRED1 gene in an effort to facilitate this process for testing and interpreting  results. This database is free to the public and will be updated quarterly.  DOI: 10.1534/g3.111.000687 PMCID: PMC3276167 PMID: 22384355",True,SPRED1 genetic variants repository

Author information: (1)Copenhagen Center for Glycomics, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of  Copenhagen, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark.  Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) are of fundamental importance in the nervous system.  However, the molecular details associated with GSL function are largely unknown,  in part because of the complexity of GSL biosynthesis in vertebrates. In  Drosophila, only one major GSL biosynthetic pathway exists, controlled by the  glycosyltransferase Egghead (Egh). Here we discovered that loss of Egh causes  overgrowth of peripheral nerves and attraction of immune cells to the nerves.  This phenotype is reminiscent of the human disorder neurofibromatosis type 1,  which is characterized by disfiguring nerve sheath tumors with mast cell  infiltration, increased cancer risk, and learning deficits. Neurofibromatosis  type 1 is due to a reduction of the tumor suppressor neurofibromin, a negative  regulator of the small GTPase Ras. Enhanced Ras signaling promotes glial growth  through activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and its downstream  kinase Akt. We find that overgrowth of peripheral nerves in egh mutants is  suppressed by down-regulation of the PI3K signaling pathway by expression of  either dominant-negative PI3K, the tumor suppressor PTEN, or the transcription  factor FOXO in the subperineurial glia. These results show that loss of the  glycosyltransferase Egh affects membrane signaling and activation of PI3K  signaling in glia of the peripheral nervous system, and suggest that  glycosyltransferases may suppress proliferation.

Author information: (1)Tissue Engineering Lab, Bioengineering Area, Instituto Biodonostia, Hospital  Universitario Donostia, 20014 San Sebastián, Spain.  The most characteristic feature of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the  development of neurofibromas. It has been suggested that these tumors are caused  by somatic inactivation of the wild-type NF1 allele, but the cell that  originally suffers this mutation remains controversial. Several lines of  evidence support the clonal origin of these tumors, and it has been recently  suggested that skin-derived precursor cells (SKPs) could be the cell of origin  of dermal neurofibromas. Nullizygous (NF1(-/-)) SKPs do give rise to  neurofibromas when transplanted to heterozygous mice. Moreover, a nullizygous  population of cells that is S100β negative is present in human neurofibromas,  and NF1(+/-) multipotent progenitor cells are seemingly recruited to the tumor.  This evidence supports the neurofibroma stem cell hypothesis and a putative  involvement of SKPs in the aetiopathogenesis of the disease, suggesting that  SKPs could become a valuable tool for the in vitro study of NF1.

Author information: (1)The Blavatnik School of Computer Science, Raymond and Beverly Sackler Faculty  of Exact Sciences, Tel-Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.  Neurofibromin regulates cell motility via three distinct GTPase pathways acting  through two different domains, the Ras GTPase-activating protein-related domain  (GRD) and the pre-GRD domain. First, the GRD domain inhibits Ras-dependent  changes in cell motility through the mitogen activated protein cascade. Second,  it also regulates Rho-dependent (Ras-independent) changes by activating LIM  kinase 2 (LIMK2), an enzyme that phosphorylates and inactivates cofilin (an  actin-depolymerizing factor). Third, the pre-GRD domain acts through the Rac1  GTPase, that activate the P21 activated kinase 1 (PAK1)-LIMK1-cofilin pathway.  We employed molecular modeling to identify a novel inhibitor of LIMK1/2. The  active sites of an ephrin-A receptor (EphA3) and LIMK2 showed marked similarity  (60%). On testing a known inhibitor of EphA3, we found that it fits to the  LIMK1/2-ATP binding site and to the latter's substrate-binding pockets. We  identified a similar compound, T56-LIMKi, and found that it inhibits LIMK1/2  kinase activities. It blocked the phosphorylation of cofilin which led to actin  severance and inhibition of tumor cell migration, tumor cell growth, and  anchorage-independent colony formation in soft agar. Because modulation of LIMK  by neurofibromin is not affected by the Ras inhibitor Salirasib, we examined the  combined effect of Salirasib and T56-LIMKi each of which can affect cell  motility by a distinct pathway. We found that their combined action on cell  proliferation and stress-fiber formation in neurofibromin-deficient cells was  synergistic. We suggest that this drug combination may be developed for  treatment of neurofibromatosis and cancer.

Author information: (1)Divisions of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Oncology, and  Biomedical Informatics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center,  Cincinnati, USA.  PURPOSE: Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) develop malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST), which are often inoperable and do not  respond well to current chemotherapies or radiation. The goal of this study was  to use comprehensive gene expression analysis to identify novel therapeutic  targets. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Nerve Schwann cells and/or their precursors are the  tumorigenic cell types in MPNST because of the loss of the NF1 gene, which  encodes the RasGAP protein neurofibromin. Therefore, we created a transgenic  mouse model, CNP-HRas12V, expressing constitutively active HRas in Schwann cells  and defined a Ras-induced gene expression signature to drive a Bayesian factor  regression model analysis of differentially expressed genes in mouse and human  neurofibromas and MPNSTs. We tested functional significance of Aurora kinase  overexpression in MPNST in vitro and in vivo using Aurora kinase short hairpin  RNAs (shRNA) and compounds that inhibit Aurora kinase. RESULTS: We identified 2,000 genes with probability of linkage to nerve Ras  signaling of which 339 were significantly differentially expressed in mouse and  human NF1-related tumor samples relative to normal nerves, including Aurora  kinase A (AURKA). AURKA was dramatically overexpressed and genomically amplified  in MPNSTs but not neurofibromas. Aurora kinase shRNAs and Aurora kinase  inhibitors blocked MPNST cell growth in vitro. Furthermore, an AURKA selective  inhibitor, MLN8237, stabilized tumor volume and significantly increased survival  of mice with MPNST xenografts. CONCLUSION: Integrative cross-species transcriptome analyses combined with  preclinical testing has provided an effective method for identifying candidates  for molecular-targeted therapeutics. Blocking Aurora kinases may be a viable  treatment platform for MPNST.  ©2012 AACR.

Castellanos, Xavier F [corrected to  Castellanos, F Xavier].  Learning disabilities and other cognitive disorders represent one of the most  important unmet medical needs and a significant source of lifelong disability.  To accelerate progress in this area, an international consortium of researchers  and clinicians, the Learning Disabilities Network (LeaDNet), was established in  2006. Initially, LeaDNet focused on neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a common  single gene disorder with a frequency of 1:3,000. Although NF1 is best  recognized as an inherited tumor predisposition syndrome, learning, cognitive,  and neurobehavioral deficits account for significant morbidity in this condition  and can have a profound impact on the quality of life of affected individuals.  Recently, there have been groundbreaking advances in our understanding of the  molecular, cellular, and neural systems underpinnings of NF1-associated learning  deficits in animal models, which precipitated clinical trials using a  molecularly targeted treatment for these deficits. However, much remains to be  learned about the spectrum of cognitive, neurological, and psychiatric  phenotypes associated with the NF1 clinical syndrome. In addition, there is a  pressing need to accelerate the identification of specific clinical targets and  treatments for these phenotypes. The successes with NF1 have allowed LeaDNet  investigators to broaden their initial focus to other genetic disorders  characterized by learning disabilities and cognitive deficits including other  RASopathies (caused by changes in the Ras signaling pathway). The ultimate  mission of LeaDNet is to leverage an international translational consortium of  clinicians and neuroscientists to integrate bench-to-bedside knowledge across a  broad range of cognitive genetic disorders, with the goal of accelerating the  development of rational and biologically based treatments.

Author information: (1)Division of Molecular Medicine and Genetics, Department of Internal Medicine,  University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.  Germline mutations in the RAS/ERK signaling pathway underlie several related  developmental disorders collectively termed neuro-cardio-facial-cutaneous (NCFC)  syndromes. NCFC patients manifest varying degrees of cognitive impairment, but  the developmental basis of their brain abnormalities remains largely unknown.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), an NCFC syndrome, is caused by loss-of-function  heterozygous mutations in the NF1 gene, which encodes neurofibromin, a RAS  GTPase-activating protein. Here, we show that biallelic Nf1 inactivation  promotes Erk-dependent, ectopic Olig2 expression specifically in  transit-amplifying progenitors, leading to increased gliogenesis at the expense  of neurogenesis in neonatal and adult subventricular zone (SVZ). Nf1-deficient  brains exhibit enlarged corpus callosum, a structural defect linked to severe  learning deficits in NF1 patients. Strikingly, these NF1-associated  developmental defects are rescued by transient treatment with an MEK/ERK  inhibitor during neonatal stages. This study reveals a critical role for Nf1 in  maintaining postnatal SVZ-derived neurogenesis and identifies a potential  therapeutic window for treating NF1-associated brain abnormalities.

The study of somatic genetic alterations in tumors contributes to the  understanding and management of cancer. Genetic alterations, such us copy number  or copy neutral changes, generate allelic imbalances (AIs) that can be  determined using polymorphic markers. Here we report the development of a simple  set of calculations for analyzing microsatellite multiplex PCR data from  control-tumor pairs that allows us to obtain accurate information not only  regarding the AI status of tumors, but also the percentage of tumor-infiltrating  normal cells, the locus copy-number status and the mechanism involved in AI. We  validated this new approach by re-analyzing a set of Neurofibromatosis type  1-associated dermal neurofibromas and comparing newly generated data with  results obtained for the same tumors in a previous study using MLPA, Paralog  Ratio Analysis and SNP-array techniques.Microsatellite multiplex PCR analysis  (MMPA) should be particularly useful for analyzing specific regions of the  genome containing tumor suppressor genes and also for determining the percentage  of infiltrating normal cells within tumors allowing them to be sorted before  they are analyzed by more expensive techniques.

Author information: (1)Children's National Medical Center, 111 Michigan Avenue NW, Washington, DC  20010, USA.  To bring insights into neurofibroma biochemistry, a comprehensive secretome  analysis was performed on cultured human primary Schwann cells isolated from  surgically resected plexiform neurofibroma and from normal nerve tissue. Using a  combination of SDS-PAGE and high precision LC-MS/MS, 907 proteins were  confidently identified in the conditioned media of Schwann cell cultures  combined. Label free proteome profiling revealed consistent release of high  levels of 22 proteins by the four biological replicates of NF1 Schwann cell  cultures relative to the two normal Schwann cell cultures. Inversely, 9 proteins  displayed decreased levels in the conditioned media of NF1 relative to normal  Schwann cells. The proteins with increased levels included proteins involved in  cell growth, angiogenesis and complement pathway while proteins with decreased  levels included those involved in cell adhesion, plasminogen pathway and  extracellular matrix remodeling. Retinoic acid receptor responder protein-1  (RARRES1), previously described as an integral membrane tumor suppressor, was  found exclusively secreted by NF1 Schwann cells but not by normal Schwann cells.  All-trans retinoic acid modulated secretion of RARRES1 in a dose dependent  manner. This study shows altered secretion of key proteins in NF1 derived  Schwann cells. The potential implication of these proteins in neurofibroma  biology is discussed.  DOI: 10.3390/ijms13079380 PMCID: PMC3430302 PMID: 22942771 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",True,Secretome survey tool

Author information: (1)Pediatric Oncology Branch, NCI, CCR, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.  aekim@childrensnational.org  BACKGROUND: Sorafenib targets multiple pathways thought to be crucial in growth  of plexiform neurofibroma (PN) in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).  Sorafenib has been tolerated with manageable toxicities in adults and children  with refractory cancer. We conducted a separate study in this population.  Monitoring long-term toxicities such as effects on growth and obtaining  additional pharmacokinetic data were of importance due to the young age and long  duration of therapy seen in previous phase I trials in children with NF1. PROCEDURE: Children ≥3 and ≤18-year-old with NF1 and inoperable PN were  eligible. Sorafenib was administered orally twice daily for consecutive 28-day  cycles. Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined from toxicities observed  during the first three cycles. RESULTS: Nine children enrolled, median age 8 (6-12) years. At the starting  115 mg/m(2) /dose (n = 5), two experienced dose-limiting grade 3 pain in their  PN. At the de-escalated 80 mg/m(2) /dose (n = 4), approximately 40% of the  pediatric solid tumor MTD, two had dose-limiting toxicity (grade 3 rash and  grade 4 mood alteration), exceeding the MTD. At 80 mg/m(2) /dose, the median  AUC(0-12 hours) at steady-state was 39.5 µg hours/ml. Toxicities appeared to  correspond with decreases in quality of life (QOL). No tumor shrinkage was  observed. CONCLUSIONS: Children with NF1 and PN did not tolerate sorafenib at doses  substantially lower than the MTD in children and adults with malignant solid  tumors. Future trials with targeted agents for children with NF1 may require a  more conservative starting dose and separate definitions of dose limiting  toxicities (DLT) than children with cancer.

Author information: (1)Department of Molecular, Virology, Immunology, and Medical Genetics, The Ohio  State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.  Schwannomas are peripheral nerve sheath tumors that often occur in the setting  of an inherited tumor predisposition syndrome, including neurofibromatosis types  1 (NF1) and 2 (NF2), familial schwannomatosis and Carney complex. Loss of the  NF2 tumor suppressor (encoding NF2, or Merlin) is associated with upregulation  of the Rac1 small GTPase, which is thought to have a key role in mediating tumor  formation. In prior studies, we generated a mouse model of schwannomas by  performing tissue-specific knockout (KO) of the Carney complex gene Prkar1a,  which encodes the type 1A regulatory subunit of protein kinase A. These tumors  exhibited down-regulation of Nf2 protein and an increase in activated Rac1. To  assess the requirement for Rac1 in schwannoma formation, we generated a double  KO (DKO) of Prkar1a and Rac1 in Schwann cells and monitored tumor formation.  Loss of Rac1 reduced tumor formation by reducing proliferation and enhancing  apoptosis. Surprisingly, the reduction of tumor formation was accompanied by  re-expression of the Nf2 protein. Furthermore, activated Rac1 was able to  downregulate Nf2 in vitro in a Pak-dependent manner. These in vivo data indicate  that activation of Rac1 is responsible for suppression of Nf2 protein  production; deficiency of Nf2 in Schwann cells leads to loss of cellular growth  control and tumor formation. Further, PKA activation through mutation in Prkar1a  is sufficient to initiate Rac1 signaling, with subsequent reduction of Nf2 and  schwannomagenesis. Although in vitro evidence has shown that loss of Nf2  activates Rac1, our data indicate that signaling between Nf2 and Rac1 occurs in  a bidirectional fashion, and these interactions are modulated by PKA.

Affected individuals develop glial  neoplasms (optic gliomas, malignant astrocytomas) and neuronal dysfunction  (learning disabilities, attention deficits). Nf1 genetically engineered mouse  models have revealed the molecular and cellular underpinnings of gliomagenesis,  attention deficit, and learning problems with relevance to basic neurobiology.  Using NF1 as a model system, these studies have revealed critical roles for the  NF1 gene in non-neoplastic cells in the tumor microenvironment, the importance  of brain region heterogeneity, novel mechanisms of glial growth regulation, the  neurochemical bases for attention deficit and learning abnormalities, and new  insights into neural stem cell function.

To examine physical, cognitive, and social-emotional predictors of  quality of life (HRQOL) and functional disability (FD) in adolescents diagnosed  with Neurofibromatosis-1. Methods. Participants were twenty-seven adolescents  with a diagnosis of NF-1 who were recruited through an NF-1 specialty clinic at  a large Midwestern children's hospital. Measurements of the adolescents'  cognitive functioning, pain, FD, HRQOL, and social and emotional functioning  were obtained with corresponding parent measures. Results. Emotional functioning  significantly predicted youth-reported and parent-reported HRQOL, whereas days  of pain significantly predicted youth-reported FD. Conclusions. NF-1 is a  complex disease. Measurements of the overall impact of the disease tap into  different aspects of the effects of NF-1 on daily life. Global outcomes such as  HRQOL appear to be influenced especially by emotional functioning, whereas  outcomes such as FD appear to be influenced by the physical/organic aspects of  NF-1.

Author information: (1)Department of Radiation Oncology, University of California, San Francisco,  San Francisco, California, USA.  Second malignant neoplasms (SMN) are therapy-induced malignancies and a growing  problem in cancer survivors, particularly survivors of childhood cancers. The  lack of experimental models of SMNs has limited understanding of their  pathogenesis. It is currently not possible to predict or prevent this  devastating late complication. Individuals with neurofibromatosis I (NF1) are at  increased risk of developing therapy-induced cancers for unclear reasons. To  model SMNs, we replicated clinical radiotherapy and delivered fractionated  abdominal irradiation to Nf1(+/-) and wild-type mice. Similar to irradiated  cancer survivors, irradiated wild-type and Nf1(+/-) mice developed diverse  in-field malignancies. In Nf1(+/-) mice, fractionated irradiation promoted both  classical NF1-associated malignancies and malignancies unassociated with the NF1  syndrome but typical of SMNs. Nf1 heterozygosity potentiated the mutagenic  effects of irradiation, as evidenced by the significantly reduced survival after  irradiation and tumor development that was often characterized by synchronous  primary tumors. Interestingly, diverse radiation-induced tumors arising in  wild-type and Nf1(+/-) mice shared a genetic signature characterized by  monoallelic loss of Nf1 and the adjacent Trp53 allele. These findings implicate  Nf1 loss as mediating tumorigenesis in a broad range of cell types and organs  extending beyond the classical NF1 tumor histologies. Examining clinical SMN  samples, we found LOH of NF1 in SMNs from non-NF1 patients. Nf1 heterozygosity  confers broad susceptibility to genotoxin-induced tumorigenesis, and this  paradigm serves as an experimental platform for future studies of SMNs.

Here we show that gliomas can originate from  differentiated cells in the central nervous system (CNS), including cortical  neurons. Transduction by oncogenic lentiviral vectors of neural stem cells  (NSCs), astrocytes, or even mature neurons in the brains of mice can give rise  to malignant gliomas. All the tumors, irrespective of the site of lentiviral  vector injection (the initiating population), shared common features of high  expression of stem or progenitor markers and low expression of differentiation  markers. Microarray analysis revealed that tumors of astrocytic and neuronal  origin match the mesenchymal GBM subtype. We propose that most differentiated  cells in the CNS upon defined genetic alterations undergo dedifferentiation to  generate a NSC or progenitor state to initiate and maintain the tumor  progression, as well as to give rise to the heterogeneous populations observed  in malignant gliomas.

Morgan Department of Radiology and Radiological Science, Johns  Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland 21287, USA. achhabr6@jhmi.edu  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A number of benign and malignant peripheral nerve tumor  and tumorlike conditions produce similar imaging features on conventional  anatomic MR imaging. Functional MR imaging using DTI can increment the  diagnostic performance in differentiation of these lesions. Our aim was to  evaluate the role of 3T anatomic MR imaging and DTI in the characterization of  peripheral nerve tumor and tumorlike conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients (13 men, 16 women; mean age, 41±18  years; range, 11-83 years) with a nerve tumor or tumorlike condition (25 benign,  5 malignant) underwent 3T MR imaging by using anatomic (n=29), functional  diffusion, DWI (n=21), and DTI (n=24) techniques. Images were evaluated for  image quality (3-point scale), ADC of the lesion, tractography, and fractional  anisotropy of nerves with interobserver reliability in ADC and FA measurements. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in age (benign, 40±18 versus  malignant, 45±19 years) and sex (benign, male/female=12:12 versus malignant,  male/female=3:2) (P>.05). All anatomic (29/29, 100%) MR imaging studies received  ""good"" quality; 20/21 (95%) DWI and 21/24 (79%) DTI studies received ""good""  quality. ADC of benign lesions (1.848±0.40×10(-3) mm2/s) differed from that of  malignant lesions (0.900±0.25×10(-3) mm2/s, P<.001) with excellent interobserver  reliability (ICC=0.988 [95% CI, 0.976-0.994]). There were no FA or ADC  differences between men and women (P>.05). FA of involved nerves was lower than  that in contralateral healthy nerves (P<.001) with excellent interobserver  reliability (ICC=0.970 [95% CI, 0.946-0.991]). ADC on DTI and DWI was not  statistically different (P>.05), with excellent intermethod reliability  (ICC=0.943 [95% CI, 0.836-0.980]). Tractography differences were observed in  benign and malignant lesions. CONCLUSIONS: 3T MR imaging and DTI are valuable methods for anatomic and  functional evaluation of peripheral nerve lesions with excellent interobserver  reliability. While tractography and low FA provide insight into neural  integrity, low diffusivity values indicate malignancy in neural masses.

Author information: (1)Neuroscience Center, Department of Neurology and Center for Molecular Imaging  Research, Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA  02114, USA.  Schwannomas are tumors formed by proliferation of dedifferentiated Schwann  cells. Patients with neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) and schwannomatosis develop  multiple schwannomas in peripheral and cranial nerves. Although benign, these  tumors can cause extreme pain and compromise sensory/motor functions, including  hearing and vision. At present, surgical resection is the main treatment  modality, but it can be problematic because of tumor inaccessibility and risk of  nerve damage. We have explored gene therapy for schwannomas, using a model in  which immortalized human NF2 schwannoma cells expressing a fluorescent protein  and luciferase are implanted in the sciatic nerve of nude mice. Direct injection  of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 1 vector encoding caspase-1 (ICE)  under the Schwann-cell specific promoter, P0, leads to regression of these  tumors with essentially no vector-mediated neuropathology, and no changes in  sensory or motor function. In a related NF2 xenograft model designed to cause  measurable pain behavior, the same gene therapy leads to tumor regression and  concordant resolution of tumor-associated pain. This AAV1-P0-ICE vector holds  promise for clinical treatment of schwannomas by direct intratumoral injection  to achieve reduction in tumor size and normalization of neuronal function.

Presneau N(1), Eskandarpour M, Shemais T, Henderson S, Halai D, Tirabosco R,  Flanagan AM.  Author information: (1)UCL Cancer Institute, 72 Huntley Street, London WC1E 6BT, UK.  BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 is one of the most common familial  diseases, the hallmark of which is the development of multiple neurofibromas.  These are benign nerve sheath tumours, which can transform into malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNST). METHODS: The aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed microRNA  (miRNA) in neurofibromas and MPNST obtained from patients with neurofibromatosis  type 1 using microarray analysis. Differential expression was validated by  reverse transcription quantitative-PCR, and functional studies were performed  after transfection of miRNA oligonucleotide mimics into MPNST cells. RESULTS: Sixteen miRNA were significantly differentially expressed in MPNST  compared with NF, and of these fourteen were downregulated in MPNST: these  included miR-30e*, miR-29c*, miR-29c, miR-340*, miR-30c, miR-139-5p, miR-195,  miR-151-5p, miR-342-5p, miR-146a, miR-150, miR-223, let-7 a and let-7 g with a  false discovery rate of q=8.48E-03 for the least significant miRNA. In contrast,  miR-210 and miR-339-5p were upregulated in MPNST compared with neurofibromas.  Prediction softwares/algorithms identified a list of genes targeted by miR-29c  including extracellular matrix genes and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, all  of which are reported to be involved in cell migration and invasion. Functional  studies in a MPNST cell line, sNF96.2, using a mimic of the mature miR-29c  showed reduced invasion, whereas there was no change in proliferation.  Zymography of the manipulated cells showed that MMP2 activity was also reduced  when miR-29c expression was forced in sNF96.2. CONCLUSION: We provide evidence that reduction of miR-29c has a pivotal role in  the progression of nerve sheath tumours and results by increasing the  invasive/migratory properties of nerve sheath tumours.

Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are predisposed to juvenile  myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), an aggressive myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN)  that is refractory to conventional chemotherapy. Conditional inactivation of the  Nf1 tumor suppressor in hematopoietic cells of mice causes a progressive MPN  that accurately models JMML and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). We  characterized the effects of Nf1 loss on immature hematopoietic populations and  investigated treatment with the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 (hereafter called 901).  Somatic Nf1 inactivation resulted in a marked expansion of immature and  lineage-committed myelo-erythroid progenitors and ineffective erythropoiesis.  Treatment with 901 induced a durable drop in leukocyte counts, enhanced  erythropoietic function, and markedly reduced spleen sizes in mice with MPN. MEK  inhibition also restored a normal pattern of erythroid differentiation and  greatly reduced extramedullary hematopoiesis. Remarkably, genetic analysis  revealed the persistence of Nf1-deficient hematopoietic cells, indicating that  MEK inhibition modulates the proliferation and differentiation of Nf1 mutant  cells in vivo rather than eliminating them. These data provide a rationale for  performing clinical trials of MEK inhibitors in patients with JMML and CMML.

Diggs-Andrews KA(1), Tokuda K, Izumi Y, Zorumski CF, Wozniak DF, Gutmann DH.  Author information: (1)Departments of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis,  MO 63110, USA.  Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are prone to learning and  behavioral abnormalities, including problems with spatial learning and  attention. The molecular etiology for these deficits is unclear, as previous  studies have implicated defective dopamine, cyclic adenosine monophosphate  (cAMP), and Ras homeostasis. Using behavioral, electrophysiological, and primary  culture, we now demonstrate that reduced dopamine signaling is responsible for  cAMP-dependent defects in neuron function and learning. Collectively, these  results establish defective dopaminergic function as a contributing factor  underlying impaired spatial learning and memory in children and adults with NF1,  and support the use of treatments that restore normal dopamine homeostasis for  select individuals.

Kaufmann D(1), Hoesch J, Su Y, Deeg L, Mellert K, Spatz JP, Kemkemer R.  Author information: (1)Institute of Human Genetics, University of Ulm, Ulm, Stuttgart, Germany.  Cells sense physical properties of their extracellular environment and translate  them into biochemical signals. In this study, cell responses to surfaces with  submicron topographies were investigated in cultured human NF1 haploinsufficient  fibroblasts. Age-matched fibroblasts from 8 patients with neurofibromatosis type  1 (NF1(+/-)) and 9 controls (NF1(+/+)) were cultured on surfaces with grooves of  200 nm height and lateral distance of 2 μm. As cellular response indicator, the  mean cell orientation along microstructured grooves was systematically examined.  The tested NF1 haploinsufficient fibroblasts were significantly less affected by  the topography than those from healthy donors. Incubation of the NF1(+/-)  fibroblasts with the farnesyltransferase inhibitor FTI-277 and other inhibitors  of the neurofibromin pathway ameliorates significantly the cell orientation.  These data indicate that NF1 haploinsufficiency results in an altered response  to specific surface topography in fibroblasts. We suggest a new function of  neurofibromin in the sensoric mechanism to topographies and a partial  mechanosensoric blindness by NF1 haploinsufficiency.

Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, Box 8111,  660 South Euclid Avenue, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.  Cognitive dysfunction, including significant impairments in learning, behavior,  and attention, is found in over 10% of children in the general population.  However, in the common inherited cancer predisposition syndrome,  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), the prevalence of these cognitive deficits  approaches 70%. As a monogenic disorder, NF1 provides a unique genetic tool to  identify and dissect mechanistically the molecular and cellular bases underlying  cognitive dysfunction. In this review, we discuss Nf1 fly and mouse systems that  mimic many of the cognitive abnormalities seen in children with NF1. Further, we  describe discoveries from these models that have uncovered defects in the  regulation of Ras activity, cAMP generation, and dopamine homeostasis as key  mechanisms important for cognitive dysfunction in children with NF1.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) develop sporadically or in the  context of neurofibromatosis type 1. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)  overexpression has been implicated in MPNST formation, but its precise role and  relevant signaling pathways remain unknown. We found that EGFR overexpression  promotes mouse neurofibroma transformation to aggressive MPNST (GEM-PNST).  Immunohistochemistry demonstrated phosphorylated STAT3 (Tyr705) in both human  MPNST and mouse GEM-PNST. A specific JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor FLLL32 delayed MPNST  formation in an MPNST xenograft nude mouse model. STAT3 knockdown by shRNA  prevented MPNST formation in vivo. Finally, reducing EGFR activity strongly  reduced pSTAT3 in vivo. Thus, an EGFR-STAT3 pathway is necessary for MPNST  transformation and establishment of MPNST xenografts growth but not for tumor  maintenance. Efficacy of the FLLL32 pharmacological inhibitor in delaying MPNST  growth suggests that combination therapies targeting JAK/STAT3 might be useful  therapeutics.

Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, Child and Family Research Institute, University of  British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNST) are rare, hereditary cancers  associated with neurofibromatosis type I. MPNSTs lack effective treatment  options as they often resist chemotherapies and have high rates of disease  recurrence. Aurora kinase A (AURKA) is an emerging target in cancer and an  aurora kinase inhibitor (AKI), termed MLN8237, shows promise against MPNST cell  lines in vitro and in vivo. Here, we test MLN8237 against two primary human  MPNST grown in vivo as xenotransplants and find that treatment results in tumour  cells exiting the cell cycle and undergoing endoreduplication, which cumulates  in stabilized disease. Targeted therapies can often fail in the clinic due to  insufficient knowledge about factors that determine tumour susceptibilities, so  we turned to three MPNST cell-lines to further study and modulate the cellular  responses to AKI. We find that the sensitivity of cell-lines with amplification  of AURKA depends upon the activity of the kinase, which correlates with the  expression of the regulatory gene products TPX2 and HMMR/RHAMM. Silencing of  HMMR/RHAMM, but not TPX2, augments AURKA activity and sensitizes MPNST cells to  AKI. Furthermore, we find that AURKA activity is critical to the propagation and  self-renewal of sphere-enriched MPNST cancer stem-like cells. AKI treatment  significantly reduces the formation of spheroids, attenuates the self-renewal of  spheroid forming cells, and promotes their differentiation. Moreover, silencing  of HMMR/RHAMM is sufficient to endow MPNST cells with an ability to form and  maintain sphere culture. Collectively, our data indicate that AURKA is a  rationale therapeutic target for MPNST and tumour cell responses to AKI, which  include differentiation, are modulated by the abundance of HMMR/RHAMM.

We report genomic analysis of 300 meningiomas, the most common primary brain  tumors, leading to the discovery of mutations in TRAF7, a proapoptotic E3  ubiquitin ligase, in nearly one-fourth of all meningiomas. Mutations in TRAF7  commonly occurred with a recurrent mutation (K409Q) in KLF4, a transcription  factor known for its role in inducing pluripotency, or with AKT1(E17K), a  mutation known to activate the PI3K pathway. SMO mutations, which activate  Hedgehog signaling, were identified in ~5% of non-NF2 mutant meningiomas. These  non-NF2 meningiomas were clinically distinctive-nearly always benign, with  chromosomal stability, and originating from the medial skull base. In contrast,  meningiomas with mutant NF2 and/or chromosome 22 loss were more likely to be  atypical, showing genomic instability, and localizing to the cerebral and  cerebellar hemispheres. Collectively, these findings identify distinct  meningioma subtypes, suggesting avenues for targeted therapeutics.

Peyre M(1), Clermont-Taranchon E, Stemmer-Rachamimov A, Kalamarides M.  Author information: (1)AP-HP, Hôpital Beaujon, Service de Neurochirurgie, Clichy, France.  Invasion of the brain parenchyma by a meningioma classified by histological  criteria as World Health Organization (WHO) grade I meningioma, implies that the  tumor has greater likelihood of recurrence and a biological behavior similar to  the more aggressive WHO grade II meningiomas. It is therefore important to  detect microscopic foci of brain invasion during surgery in order to maximize  the resection and/or adapt imaging follow-up. In this study, we tested the  sensitivity of two handheld confocal imaging devices to detect foci of brain  invasion in two types of meningioma mouse models: in a genetically engineered  mouse model and in a syngeneic xenograft model. Confocal imaging offered precise  images of meningothelial and fibroblastic mouse meningiomas as well as malignant  meningiomas, which corresponded exactly to the pathological findings. Imaging  showed a sharp definition of the brain-tumor interface and enabled  identification of embedded nerves and vessels. Importantly, in both mouse models  used in this study, extension of tumor along Virchow-Robin spaces into adjacent  brain was detected by imaging. In conclusion, this novel technique, following  validation in clinical trials, may open new possibilities for use in operating  rooms to influence both decision making during the surgery and planning for  additional treatments.  © 2013 The Authors; Brain Pathology © 2013 International Society of  Neuropathology.

Author information: (1)Department of Tumor Genetics and Biology, Graduate school of Medical  Sciences, Kumamoto University, 1-1-1 Honjo, Chuo-ku, Kumamoto 860-8556, Japan.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor gene product, neurofibromin,  functions in part as a Ras-GAP, and though its loss is implicated in the  neuronal abnormality of NF1 patients, its precise cellular function remains  unclear. To study the molecular mechanism of NF1 pathogenesis, we prepared NF1  gene knockdown (KD) PC12 cells, as a NF1 disease model, and analyzed their  molecular (gene and protein) expression profiles with a unique integrated  proteomics approach, comprising iTRAQ, 2D-DIGE, and DNA microarrays, using an  integrated protein and gene expression analysis chart (iPEACH). In NF1-KD PC12  cells showing abnormal neuronal differentiation after NGF treatment, of 3198  molecules quantitatively identified and listed in iPEACH, 97 molecules  continuously up- or down-regulated over time were extracted. Pathway and network  analysis further revealed overrepresentation of calcium signaling and  transcriptional regulation by glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the up-regulated  protein set, whereas nerve system development was overrepresented in the  down-regulated protein set. The novel up-regulated network we discovered,  ""dynein IC2-GR-COX-1 signaling,"" was then examined in NF1-KD cells. Validation  studies confirmed that NF1 knockdown induces altered splicing and  phosphorylation patterns of dynein IC2 isomers, up-regulation and accumulation  of nuclear GR, and increased COX-1 expression in NGF-treated cells. Moreover,  the neurite retraction phenotype observed in NF1-KD cells was significantly  recovered by knockdown of the dynein IC2-C isoform and COX-1. In addition,  dynein IC2 siRNA significantly inhibited nuclear translocation and accumulation  of GR and up-regulation of COX-1 expression. These results suggest that dynein  IC2 up-regulates GR nuclear translocation and accumulation, and subsequently  causes increased COX-1 expression, in this NF1 disease model. Our integrated  proteomics strategy, which combines multiple approaches, demonstrates that  NF1-related neural abnormalities are, in part, caused by up-regulation of dynein  IC2-GR-COX-1 signaling, which may be a novel therapeutic target for NF1.

Author information: (1)Laboratory for Applied Radiation Oncology, Department of Radiation Oncology,  University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland.  Despite the prominent pro-apoptotic role of p53, this protein has also been  shown to promote cell survival in response to metabolic stress. However, the  specific mechanism by which p53 protects cells from metabolic stress-induced  death is unknown. Earlier we reported that carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1C  (CPT1C), a brain-specific member of a family of mitochondria-associated enzymes  that have a central role in fatty acid metabolism promotes cell survival and  tumor growth. Unlike other members of the CPT family, the subcellular  localization of CPT1C and its cellular function remains elusive. Here, we report  that CPT1C is a novel p53-target gene with a bona fide p53-responsive element  within the first intron. CPT1C is upregulated in vitro and in vivo in a  p53-dependent manner. Interestingly, expression of CPT1C is induced by metabolic  stress factors such as hypoxia and glucose deprivation in a p53 and AMP  activated kinase-dependent manner. Furthermore, in a murine tumor model,  depletion of Cpt1c leads to delayed tumor development and a striking increase in  survival. Taken together, our results indicate that p53 protects cells from  metabolic stress via induction of CPT1C and that CPT1C may have a crucial role  in carcinogenesis. CPT1C may therefore represent an exciting new therapeutic  target for the treatment of hypoxic and otherwise treatment-resistant tumors.

Author information: (1)Peninsula School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Plymouth, Devon,  PL6 8BU, UK.  Loss of the Merlin tumour suppressor causes abnormal de-differentiation and  proliferation of Schwann cells and formation of schwannoma tumours in patients  with neurofibromatosis type 2. Within the mature peripheral nerve the normal  development, differentiation and maintenance of myelinating and non-myelinating  Schwann cells is regulated by a network of transcription factors that include  SOX10, OCT6 (now known as POU3F1), NFATC4 and KROX20 (also known as Egr2). We  have examined for the first time how their regulation of Schwann cell  development is disrupted in primary human schwannoma cells. We find that  induction of both KROX20 and OCT6 is impaired, whereas enforced expression of  KROX20 drives both myelin gene expression and cell cycle arrest in Merlin-null  cells. Importantly, we show that human schwannoma cells have reduced expression  of SOX10 protein and messenger RNA. Analysis of mouse SOX10-null Schwann cells  shows they display many of the characteristics of human schwannoma cells,  including increased expression of platelet derived growth factor receptor beta  (PDGFRB) messenger RNA and protein, enhanced proliferation, increased focal  adhesions and schwannoma-like morphology. Correspondingly, reintroduction of  SOX10 into human Merlin-null cells restores the ability of these cells to induce  KROX20 and myelin protein zero (MPZ), localizes NFATC4 to the nucleus, reduces  cell proliferation and suppresses PDGFRB expression. Thus, we propose that loss  of the SOX10 protein, which is vital for normal Schwann cell development, is  also key to the pathology of Merlin-null schwannoma tumours.

Sun D(1), Haddad R, Kraniak JM, Horne SD, Tainsky MA.  Author information: (1)Center for Molecular Medicine and Genetics, Wayne State University School of  Medicine, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan 48201, USA.  Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a type of soft tissue sarcoma  that occurs in carriers of germline mutations in Nf1 gene as well as  sporadically. Neurofibromin, encoded by the Nf1 gene, functions as a  GTPase-activating protein (GAP) whose mutation leads to activation of wt-RAS and  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in neurofibromatosis type I  (NF1) patients' tumors. However, therapeutic targeting of RAS and MAPK have had  limited success in this disease. In this study, we modulated NRAS,  mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK)1/2, and  neurofibromin levels in MPNST cells and determined gene expression changes to  evaluate the regulation of signaling pathways in MPNST cells. Gene expression  changes due to neurofibromin modulation but independent of NRAS and MEK1/2  regulation in MPNST cells indicated bone morphogenetic protein 2 (Bmp2)  signaling as a key pathway. The BMP2-SMAD1/5/8 pathway was activated in  NF1-associated MPNST cells and inhibition of BMP2 signaling by LDN-193189 or  short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to BMP2 decreased the motility and invasion of  NF1-associated MPNST cells. The pathway-specific gene changes provide a greater  understanding of the complex role of neurofibromin in MPNST pathology and novel  targets for drug discovery.  ©2013 AACR.

Although traditional models of carcinogenesis have largely focused on neoplastic  cells, converging data have revealed the importance of non-neoplastic stromal  cells in influencing tumor growth and progression. Leveraging a genetically  engineered mouse model of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated optic  glioma, we now demonstrate that stromal microglia express the CX3CR1 chemokine  receptor, such that reduced CX3CR1 expression decreases optic nerve microglia.  Moreover, genetic reduction of Cx3cr1 expression in Nf1 optic glioma mice delays  optic glioma formation. Coupled with previous findings demonstrating that  microglia maintain optic glioma growth, these new findings provide a strong  preclinical rationale for the development of future stroma-directed glioma  therapies in children.

Nutakki K(1), Hingtgen CM, Monahan P, Varni JW, Swigonski NL.  Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine,  Indianapolis, IN, USA. knutakki@iupui.edu  BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant  genetic disorder with significant impact on health-related quality of life  (HRQOL). Research in understanding the pathogenetic mechanisms of neurofibroma  development has led to the use of new clinical trials for the treatment of NF1.  One of the most important outcomes of a trial is improvement in quality of life,  however, no condition specific HRQOL instrument for NF1 exists. The objective of  this study was to develop an NF1 HRQOL instrument as a module of PedsQL™ and to  test for its initial feasibility, internal consistency reliability and validity  in adults with NF1. METHODS: The NF1 specific HRQOL instrument was developed using a standard method  of PedsQL™ module development - literature review, focus group/semi-structured  interviews, cognitive interviews and experts' review of initial draft, pilot  testing and field testing. Field testing involved 134 adults with NF1.  Feasibility was measured by the percentage of missing responses, internal  consistency reliability was measured with Cronbach's alpha and validity was  measured by the known-groups method. RESULTS: Feasibility, measured by the percentage of missing responses was 4.8%  for all subscales on the adult version of the NF1-specific instrument. Internal  consistency reliability for the Total Score (alpha =0.97) and subscale  reliabilities ranging from 0.72 to 0.96 were acceptable for group comparisons.  The PedsQL™ NF1 module distinguished between NF1 adults with excellent to very  good, good, and fair to poor health status. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the initial feasibility, reliability and  validity of the PedsQL™ NF1 module in adult patients. The PedsQL™ NF1 Module can  be used to understand the multidimensional nature of NF1 on the HRQOL patients  with this disorder.

Comment in     Cancer Cell. 2013 Mar 18;23(3):269-71. doi: 10.1016/j.ccr.2013.03.001.  Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are soft tissue sarcomas that  arise in connective tissue surrounding peripheral nerves. They occur  sporadically in a subset of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). MPNSTs  are highly aggressive, therapeutically resistant, and typically fatal. Using  comparative transcriptome analysis, we identified CXCR4, a G-protein-coupled  receptor, as highly expressed in mouse models of NF1-deficient MPNSTs, but not  in nontransformed precursor cells. The chemokine receptor CXCR4 and its ligand,  CXCL12, promote MPNST growth by stimulating cyclin D1 expression and cell-cycle  progression through PI3-kinase (PI3K) and β-catenin signaling. Suppression of  CXCR4 activity either by shRNA or pharmacological inhibition decreases MPNST  cell growth in culture and inhibits tumorigenesis in allografts and in  spontaneous genetic mouse models of MPNST.

Göztepe Eğitim ve Araştırma  Hastanesi, İstanbul.semasaltik@superonline.com  OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate health-related quality of  life (HRQoL) in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and to determine  the factors affecting HRQoL in these children, with particular emphasis on  NF1-specific findings and complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patient group included 60 NF1 patients aged 3-18  years that were evaluated at our pediatric neurology outpatient clinic between  January 2001 and January 2011. The control group included 96 age-matched  patients without chronic disease and whose mothers had similar levels of  education as the mothers of those in the patient group. All the mothers  completed the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory PedsQoL-Parent Form and the  PedsQoL scores in the 2 groups were statistically compared. In addition, the  effects of sociodemographic variables, as well as NF1-specific findings and  complications (skin findings, neurofibromas, Lisch nodules, arterial  hypertension and/or cardiac pathology, short stature, macrocephaly, orthopedic  problems, hyperintense lesions on cranial MRI, epileptic seizures, psychiatric  disease, and cognitive involvement) were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: All PedsQoL domain scores were lower in the patient group than in the  control group (P = 0.0001). HRQoL decreased, and the number of NF1-specific  findings and complications increased as age increased in the patient group (P =  0.013). Short stature, neurofibromas and/or plexiform neurofibromas, bone  lesions, and psychiatric problems were factors specifically related to low-level  HRQoL in the NF1 patients. CONCLUSION: NF1 negatively affected HRQoL in the patient group. We think that  multidisciplinary evaluation and, in particular, psychiatric management of NF1  patients are necessary to improve patient HRQoL.

Farrer RG(1), Farrer JR, DeVries GH.  Author information: (1)Research Service, Edward Hines, Jr. Veterans Administration Hospital, Hines,  Illinois 60141, USA. robert.farrer@va.gov  Neurofibromatosis type 1-derived Schwann cells isolated from malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) overexpress PDGF receptor-β and generate  an aberrant intracellular calcium increase in response to PDGF-BB. Using the  human MPNST Schwann cell line ST88-14, we demonstrate that, in addition to a  transient phosphorylation of Akt, PDGF-BB stimulation produces an atypical  sustained phosphorylation of Akt that is dependent on calcium and calmodulin  (CaM). The sustained Akt phosphorylation did not occur in PDGF-BB-stimulated  normal human Schwann cells or ST88-14 cells stimulated with stem cell factor,  whose receptor is also overexpressed in ST88-14 cells. The sustained Akt  phosphorylation induced by PDGF-BB was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells  with either the intracellular calcium chelator  1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl)  ester (BAPTA-AM) or the CaM antagonist W7, whereas the transient portion was not  inhibited. Akt also co-immunoprecipitated with CaM in a PDGF-BB-dependent  manner, suggesting that direct interaction between Akt and CaM is involved in  the sustained phosphorylation of Akt. Furthermore, we provide evidence that  anti-apoptotic effects of PDGF-BB on serum-deprived ST88-14 cells can be  inhibited by W7, implicating the PDGF-BB-induced activation of calcium/CaM in  promoting cell survival, presumably through sustained Akt activation. We  conclude that the activation of the calcium/CaM/Akt pathway resulting from  stimulation of overexpressed PDGF receptor-β may contribute to the survival and  tumorigenicity of MPNST cells.

In this issue of Cancer Discovery, 2 studies provide new evidence implicating  loss of the tumor suppressor neurofibromin (NF1) in the biologic behavior of  cutaneous melanoma. The first study from Maertens and colleagues describes a new  transgenic mouse model in which mutant BRAF cooperates with NF1 loss to drive  melanoma development through the abrogation of oncogene-induced senescence. The  second, from Whittaker and colleagues, used a high-throughput short hairpin RNA  screening approach to identify NF1 loss as a key mediator of acquired and  intrinsic BRAF inhibitor resistance.

Author information: (1)Campbell Family Cancer Research Institute, Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto,  ON, Canada M5G 1L7.  Defects in the RAS small G protein or its associated network of regulatory  proteins that disrupt GTPase cycling are a major cause of cancer and  developmental RASopathy disorders. Lack of robust functional assays has been a  major hurdle in RAS pathway-targeted drug development. We used NMR to obtain  detailed mechanistic data on RAS cycling defects conferred by oncogenic  mutations, or full-length RASopathy-derived regulatory proteins. By monitoring  the conformation of wild-type and oncogenic RAS in real-time, we show that  opposing properties integrate with regulators to hyperactivate oncogenic RAS  mutants. Q61L and G13D exhibited rapid nucleotide exchange and an unexpected  susceptibility to GAP-mediated hydrolysis, in direct contrast with G12V,  indicating different approaches must be taken to inhibit these oncoproteins. An  NMR methodology was established to directly monitor RAS cycling by intact,  multidomain proteins encoded by RASopathy genes in mammalian cell extracts. By  measuring GAP activity from tumor cells, we demonstrate how loss of  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) increases RAS-GTP levels in NF1-derived cells. We  further applied this methodology to profile Noonan Syndrome (NS)-derived SOS1  mutants. Combining NMR with cell-based assays allowed us to differentiate  defects in catalysis, allosteric regulation, and membrane targeting of  individual mutants, while revealing a membrane-dependent compensatory effect  that attenuates dramatic increases in RAS activation shown by Y337C, L550P, and  I252T. Our NMR method presents a precise and robust measure of RAS activity,  providing mechanistic insights that facilitate discovery of therapeutics  targeted against the RAS signaling network.

Yanase S(1), Luo Y, Maruta H.  Author information: (1)Daito-Bunka University, Saitama, Japan.  There is an increasing evidence that the oncogenic kinase PAK1 is responsible  not only for malignant transformation, but also for several other diseases such  as inflammatory diseases (asthma and arthritis), infectious diseases including  malaria, AIDS, and flu, as well as a series of neuronal diseases/disorders  (neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, Alzheimer's diseases, Huntington's  disease, epilepsy, depression, learning deficit, etc.) which often cause  premature death. Interestingly, a few natural PAK1-blockers such as curcumin,  caffeic acid (CA) and rosmarinic acid (RA) extend the lifespan of the nematode  Caenorhabditis elegans or fruit flies. Here, to explore the possibility that C.  elegans could provide us with a quick and inexpensive in vivo screening system  for a series of more potent but safe (non-toxic) PAK1-blocking therapeutics, we  examined the effects of PAK1-deficiency or down-regulation on a few selected  functions of this worm, including reproduction, expression of HSP16.2 gene, and  lifespan. In short, we found that PAK1 promotes reproduction, whereas it  inactivates HSP16.2 gene and shortens lifespan, as do PI-3 kinase (AGE-1), TOR,  and insulin-like signalling /ILS (Daf-2) in this worm. These findings not only  support the ""trade-off"" theory on reproduction versus lifespan, but also suggest  the possibility that the reduced reproduction (or HSP16.2 gene activation) of  this worm could be used as the first indicator of extended lifespan for a quick  in vivo screening for PAK1-blockers.

Author information: (1)Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis,MN 55455, USA.  Genetic changes required for the formation and progression of human Schwann cell  tumors remain elusive. Using a Sleeping Beauty forward genetic screen, we  identified several genes involved in canonical Wnt signaling as potential  drivers of benign neurofibromas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors  (MPNSTs). In human neurofibromas and MPNSTs, activation of Wnt signaling  increased with tumor grade and was associated with downregulation of β-catenin  destruction complex members or overexpression of a ligand that potentiates Wnt  signaling, R-spondin 2 (RSPO2). Induction of Wnt signaling was sufficient to  induce transformed properties in immortalized human Schwann cells, and  downregulation of this pathway was sufficient to reduce the tumorigenic  phenotype of human MPNST cell lines. Small-molecule inhibition of Wnt signaling  effectively reduced the viability of MPNST cell lines and synergistically  induced apoptosis when combined with an mTOR inhibitor, RAD-001, suggesting that  Wnt inhibition represents a novel target for therapeutic intervention in Schwann  cell tumors.

Deo M(1), Huang JL, Van Raamsdonk CD.  Author information: (1)Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver,  Canada.  When mutations in two different genes produce the same mutant phenotype, it  suggests that the encoded proteins either interact with each other, or act in  parallel to fulfill a similar purpose. Haploinsufficiency of Neurofibromin and  over-expression of Endothelin 3 both cause increased numbers of melanocytes to  populate the dermis during mouse development, and thus we are interested in how  these two signaling pathways might intersect. Neurofibromin is mutated in the  human genetic disease, neurofibromatosis type 1, which is characterized by the  development of Schwann cell based tumors and skin hyper-pigmentation.  Neurofibromin is a GTPase activating protein, while the Endothelin 3 ligand  activates Endothelin receptor B, a G protein coupled receptor. In order to study  the genetic interactions between endothelin and neurofibromin, we defined the  deletion breakpoints of the classical Ednrb piebald lethal allele (Ednrb(s-l) )  and crossed these mice to mice with a loss-of-function mutation in  neurofibromin, Dark skin 9 (Dsk9). We found that Neurofibromin  haploinsufficiency requires Endothelin receptor B to darken the tail dermis. In  contrast, Neurofibromin haploinsufficiency increases the area of the coat that  is pigmented in Endothelin receptor B null mice. We also found an oncogenic  mutation in the G protein alpha subunit, GNAQ, which couples to Endothelin  receptor B, in a uveal melanoma from a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1.  Thus, this data suggests that there is a complex relationship between  Neurofibromin and Endothelin receptor B.

Author information: (1)The Arthur and Sonia Labatt Brain Tumour Research Centre, Toronto, Canada;  Cell Biology Program, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.  vedant.arun@utoronto.ca  Neurofibromin (NF1) is encoded by the NF1 tumour suppressor gene. Mutations  result in a disorder known as Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF-1), and patients are  often diagnosed due to the presence of unusual pigmentary patterns that include  Café au lait macules (CALMs). Little is known about how loss of NF1 results in  pigmentary defects in melanocytes. We sought to identify novel NF1 interacting  proteins and elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the pigmentary  defects. The cytoplasmic Dynein Heavy Chain 1 (DHC) was found to interact with  NF1 along microtubules in vesicular structures identified to be melanosomes. Our  studies suggest that NF1 is involved in melanosomal localization, and that  disruptions in NF1-DHC interactions may contribute to the abnormal pigmentary  features commonly associated with this debilitating syndrome.

To identify genetic drivers of MPNST  development, we used the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon-based somatic  mutagenesis system in mice with somatic loss of transformation-related protein  p53 (Trp53) function and/or overexpression of human epidermal growth factor  receptor (EGFR). Common insertion site (CIS) analysis of 269 neurofibromas and  106 MPNSTs identified 695 and 87 sites with a statistically significant number  of recurrent transposon insertions, respectively. Comparison to human data sets  identified new and known driver genes for MPNST formation at these sites.  Pairwise co-occurrence analysis of CIS-associated genes identified many  cooperating mutations that are enriched in Wnt/β-catenin, PI3K-AKT-mTOR and  growth factor receptor signaling pathways. Lastly, we identified several new  proto-oncogenes, including Foxr2 (encoding forkhead box R2), which we  functionally validated as a proto-oncogene involved in MPNST maintenance.

Author information: (1)Center for Neural Tumor Research and Section on Genetics of Hereditary Ear  Disorders, House Research Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, CA  90057, USA.  PURPOSE: The growth and survival of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2)-deficient  cells are enhanced by the activation of multiple signaling pathways including  ErbBs/IGF-1R/Met, PI3K/Akt, and Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk1/2. The chaperone protein HSP90  is essential for the stabilization of these signaling molecules. The aim of the  study was to characterize the effect of HSP90 inhibition in various  NF2-deficient models. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We tested efficacy of the small-molecule NXD30001, which  has been shown to be a potent HSP90 inhibitor. The antiproliferative activity of  NXD30001 was tested in NF2-deficient cell lines and in human primary schwannoma  and meningioma cultures in vitro. The antitumor efficacy of HSP90 inhibition in  vivo was verified in two allograft models and in one NF2 transgenic model. The  underlying molecular alteration was further characterized by a global  transcriptome approach. RESULTS: NXD30001 induced degradation of client proteins in and suppressed  proliferation of NF2-deficient cells. Differential expression analysis  identified subsets of genes implicated in cell proliferation, cell survival,  vascularization, and Schwann cell differentiation whose expression was altered  by NXD30001 treatment. The results showed that NXD30001 in NF2-deficient  schwannoma suppressed multiple pathways necessary for tumorigenesis. CONCLUSIONS: HSP90 inhibition showing significant antitumor activity against  NF2-related tumor cells in vitro and in vivo represents a promising option for  novel NF2 therapies.

PURPOSE: Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PGL) are neuroendocrine tumors of  sympathetic and parasympathetic paraganglia. This study investigated the  relationships between genotype-specific differences in mitochondrial function  and catecholamine content in PGL tumors. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Respiratory chain enzyme assays and (1)H-nuclear magnetic  resonance (NMR) spectroscopy at 500 MHz were conducted on homogenates of 35  sporadic PGLs and 59 PGLs from patients with hereditary mutations in succinate  dehydrogenase subunits B and D (SDHB, SDHD), succinate dehydrogenase assembly  factor 2, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), rearranged during transfection (RET),  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), and myc-associated factor X. RESULTS: In SDHx-related PGLs, a significant decrease in complex II activity (P  < 0.0001) and a significant increase in complex I, III, and IV enzyme activities  were observed when compared to sporadic, RET, and NF1 tumors. Also, a  significant increase in citrate synthase (P < 0.0001) enzyme activity was  observed in SDHx-related PGLs when compared to sporadic-, VHL-, RET-, and  NF1-related tumors. An increase in succinate accumulation (P < 0.001) and  decrease in ATP/ADP/AMP accumulation (P < 0.001) was observed when compared to  sporadic PGLs and PGLs of other genotypes. Positive correlations (P < 0.01) were  observed between respiratory chain complex II activity and total catecholamine  content and ATP/ADP/AMP and total catecholamine contents in tumor tissues. CONCLUSIONS: This study for the first time establishes a relationship between  determinants of energy metabolism, like activity of respiratory chain enzyme  complex II, ATP/ADP/AMP content, and catecholamine content in PGL tumors. Also,  this study for the first time successfully uses NMR spectroscopy to detect  catecholamines in PGL tumors and provides ex vivo evidence for the accumulation  of succinate in PGL tumors with an SDHx mutation.

Author information: (1)Department of Psychiatry, Washington University School of Medicine, St.  Louis, Missouri, United States of America. wozniakd@psychiatry.wustl.edu  Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) frequently have cognitive and  behavioral deficits. Some of these deficits have been successfully modeled in  Nf1 genetically-engineered mice that develop optic gliomas (Nf1 OPG mice). In  the current study, we show that abnormal motivational influences affect the  behavior of Nf1 OPG mice, particularly with regard to their response to novel  environmental stimuli. For example, Nf1 OPG mice made fewer spontaneous  alternations in a Y-maze and fewer arm entries relative to WT controls. However,  analysis of normalized alternation data demonstrated that these differences were  not due to a spatial working memory deficit. Other reported behavioral results  (e.g., open-field test, below) suggest that differential responses to novelty  and/or other motivational influences may be more important determinants of these  kinds of behavior than simple differences in locomotor activity/spontaneous  movements. Importantly, normal long-term depression was observed in hippocampal  slices from Nf1 OPG mice. Results from elevated plus maze testing showed that  differences in exploratory activity between Nf1 OPG and WT control mice may be  dependent on the environmental context (e.g., threatening or non-threatening)  under which exploration is being measured. Nf1 OPG mice also exhibited decreased  exploratory hole poking in a novel holeboard and showed abnormal olfactory  preferences, although L-dopa (50 mg/kg) administration resolved the abnormal  olfactory preference behaviors. Nf1 OPG mice displayed an attenuated response to  a novel open field in terms of decreased ambulatory activity and rearing but  only during the first 10 min of the session. Importantly, Nf1 OPG mice  demonstrated investigative rearing deficits with regard to a novel hanging  object suspended on one side of the field which were not rescued by L-dopa  administration. Collectively, our results provide new data important for  evaluating therapeutic treatments aimed at ameliorating NF1-associated  cognitive/behavioral deficits.

Author information: (1)UMR745 INSERM, Université Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cité, Faculté des  Sciences Pharmaceutiques et Biologiques, 4 avenue de l'Observatoire, 75006  Paris, France.  BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common dominant tumor  predisposition syndrome affecting 1 in 3,500 individuals. The hallmarks of NF1  are the development of peripheral nerve sheath tumors either benign (dermal and  plexiform neurofibromas) or malignant (MPNSTs). RESULTS: To comprehensively characterize the role of microRNAs in NF1  tumorigenesis, we analyzed 377 miRNAs expression in a large panel of dermal and  plexiform neurofibromas, and MPNSTs. The most significantly upregulated miRNA in  plexiform neurofibromas was miR-486-3p that targets the major tumor suppressor  gene, PTEN. We confirmed PTEN downregulation at mRNA level. In plexiform  neurofibromas, we also report aberrant expression of four miRNAs involved in the  RAS-MAPK pathway (miR-370, miR-143, miR-181a, and miR-145). In MPNSTs,  significant deregulated miRNAs were involved in PTEN repression (miR-301a,  miR-19a, and miR-106b), RAS-MAPK pathway regulation (Let-7b, miR-195, and  miR-10b), mesenchymal transition (miR-200c, let-7b, miR-135a, miR-135b, and  miR-9), HOX genes expression (miR-210, miR-196b, miR-10a, miR-10b, and miR-9),  and cell cycle progression (miR-195, let-7b, miR-20a, miR-210, miR-129-3p,  miR-449a, and miR-106b). CONCLUSION: We confirmed the implication of PTEN in genesis of plexiform  neurofibromas and MPNSTs in NF1. Markedly deregulated miRNAs might have  potential diagnostic or prognostic value and could represent novel strategies  for effective pharmacological therapies of NF1 tumors.

Recently, mutations in the neurofibromin 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor gene  were identified in multiple subtypes of human soft-tissue sarcomas. To study the  effect of NF1 inactivation in the initiation and progression of distinct sarcoma  subtypes, we have developed a novel mouse model of temporally and spatially  restricted NF1-deleted sarcoma. To generate primary sarcomas, we inject  adenovirus containing Cre recombinase into NF1(flox/flox); Ink4a/Arf(flox/flox)  mice at two distinct orthotopic sites: intramuscularly or in the sciatic nerve.  The mice develop either high-grade myogenic sarcomas or malignant peripheral  nerve sheath tumor (MPNST)-like tumors, respectively. These tumors reflect the  histologic properties and spectrum of sarcomas found in patients. To explore the  use of this model for preclinical studies, we conducted a study of  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway inhibition with the MEK  inhibitor PD325901. Treatment with PD325901 delays tumor growth through  decreased cyclin D1 mRNA and cell proliferation. We also examined the effects of  MEK inhibition on the native tumor stroma and find that PD325901 decreases VEGFα  expression in tumor cells with a corresponding decrease in microvessel density.  Taken together, our results use a primary tumor model to show that sarcomas can  be generated by loss of NF1 and Ink4a/Arf, and that these tumors are sensitive  to MEK inhibition by direct effects on tumor cells and the surrounding  microenvironment. These studies suggest that MEK inhibitors should be further  explored as potential sarcoma therapies in patients with tumors containing NF1  deletion.

Sharma R(1), Wu X, Rhodes SD, Chen S, He Y, Yuan J, Li J, Yang X, Li X, Jiang L,  Kim ET, Stevenson DA, Viskochil D, Xu M, Yang FC.  Author information: (1)Departments of Pediatrics.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common genetic disorder affecting 1 in 3500  individuals. Patients with NF1 are predisposed to debilitating skeletal  manifestations, including osteopenia/osteoporosis and long bone pseudarthrosis  (nonunion fracture). Hyperactivation of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase  (MAPK) pathway in NF1 is known to underlie aberrant proliferation and  differentiation in cell lineages, including osteoclast progenitors and  mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) also known as osteoblast progenitors (pro-OBLs).  Our current study demonstrates the hyper Ras/MAPK as a critical pathway  underlying the pathogenesis of NF1-associated fracture repair deficits.  Nf1-deficient pro-OBLs exhibit Ras/MAPK hyperactivation. Introduction of the NF1  GTPase activating-related domain (NF1 GAP-related domain) in vitro is sufficient  to rescue hyper Ras activity and enhance osteoblast (OBL) differentiation in  Nf1(-/-) pro-OBLs and NF1 human (h) MSCs cultured from NF1 patients with  skeletal abnormalities, including pseudarthrosis or scoliosis. Pharmacologic  inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) signaling with  PD98059 partially rescues aberrant Erk activation while enhancing OBL  differentiation and expression of OBL markers, osterix and osteocalcin, in  Nf1-deficient murine pro-OBLs. Similarly, MEK inhibition enhances OBL  differentiation of hMSCs. In addition, PD98059 rescues aberrant osteoclast  maturation in Nf1 haploinsufficient bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs).  Importantly, MEK inhibitor significantly improves fracture healing in an NF1  murine model, Col2.3Cre;Nf1(flox/-). Collectively, these data indicate the  Ras/MAPK cascade as a critical pathway in the pathogenesis of bone loss and  pseudarthrosis related to NF1 mutations. These studies provide evidence for  targeting the MAPK pathway to improve bone mass and treat pseudarthrosis in NF1.

PMID:23863479,Tumor suppressor Nf2 limits expansion of the neural progenitor pool by inhibiting Yap/Taz transcriptional coactivators.,"Tumor suppressor Nf2 limits expansion of the neural progenitor pool by  inhibiting Yap/Taz transcriptional coactivators.  Lavado A(1), He Y, Paré J, Neale G, Olson EN, Giovannini M, Cao X.  Author information: (1)Department of Developmental Neurobiology, St Jude Children's Research  Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.  Brain development requires a precise balance between expansion of the neural  progenitor pool and the production of postmitotic neurons and glia. Disruption  of this equilibrium results in a myriad of structural abnormalities and  disorders of the nervous system. The molecular mechanism that restricts neural  progenitor expansion is poorly understood. Here we show that the tumor  suppressor neurofibromatosis 2 (Nf2; merlin) limits the expansion of neural  progenitor cells (NPCs) in the mammalian dorsal telencephalon. Nf2 is localized  at the apical region of NPCs. In the absence of Nf2, NPCs of the cortical hem,  hippocampal primordium and neocortical primordium overexpand, while production  of Cajal-Retzius cells and hippocampal neurons decreases, resulting in severe  malformation of the hippocampus in adult mice. We further show that Nf2  functions by inhibiting the Yap/Taz transcriptional coactivators, probably  through a mechanism that is distinct from the canonical Hippo pathway.  Overexpressing human YAP in NPCs causes a hippocampal malformation phenotype  that closely resembles that of Nf2 mutants and, importantly, deleting Yap in the  Nf2 mutant background largely restores hippocampal development. Our studies  uncover Nf2 as an important inhibitor of neural progenitor expansion and  establish Yap/Taz as key downstream effectors of Nf2 during brain development.

PMID:23907387,An integrative characterization of recurrent molecular aberrations in glioblastoma genomes.,"An integrative characterization of recurrent molecular aberrations in  glioblastoma genomes.  Sintupisut N(1), Liu PL, Yeang CH.  Author information: (1)Institute of Statistical Science, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC and  Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.  Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and malignant primary brain  tumor in adults. Decades of investigations and the recent effort of the Cancer  Genome Atlas (TCGA) project have mapped many molecular alterations in GBM cells.  Alterations on DNAs may dysregulate gene expressions and drive malignancy of  tumors. It is thus important to uncover causal and statistical dependency  between 'effector' molecular aberrations and 'target' gene expressions in GBMs.  A rich collection of prior studies attempted to combine copy number variation  (CNV) and mRNA expression data. However, systematic methods to integrate  multiple types of cancer genomic data-gene mutations, single nucleotide  polymorphisms, CNVs, DNA methylations, mRNA and microRNA expressions and  clinical information-are relatively scarce. We proposed an algorithm to build  'association modules' linking effector molecular aberrations and target gene  expressions and applied the module-finding algorithm to the integrated TCGA GBM  data sets. The inferred association modules were validated by six tests using  external information and datasets of central nervous system tumors: (i)  indication of prognostic effects among patients; (ii) coherence of target gene  expressions; (iii) retention of effector-target associations in external data  sets; (iv) recurrence of effector molecular aberrations in GBM; (v) functional  enrichment of target genes; and (vi) co-citations between effectors and targets.  Modules associated with well-known molecular aberrations of GBM-such as  chromosome 7 amplifications, chromosome 10 deletions, EGFR and NF1  mutations-passed the majority of the validation tests. Furthermore, several  modules associated with less well-reported molecular aberrations-such as  chromosome 11 CNVs, CD40, PLXNB1 and GSTM1 methylations, and mir-21  expressions-were also validated by external information. In particular, modules  constituting trans-acting effects with chromosome 11 CNVs and cis-acting effects  with chromosome 10 CNVs manifested strong negative and positive associations  with survival times in brain tumors. By aligning the information of association  modules with the established GBM subclasses based on transcription or  methylation levels, we found each subclass possessed multiple concurrent  molecular aberrations. Furthermore, the joint molecular characteristics derived  from 16 association modules had prognostic power not explained away by the  strong biomarker of CpG island methylator phenotypes. Functional and survival  analyses indicated that immune/inflammatory responses and epithelial-mesenchymal  transitions were among the most important determining processes of prognosis.  Finally, we demonstrated that certain molecular aberrations uniquely recurred in  GBM but were relatively rare in non-GBM glioma cells. These results justify the  utility of an integrative analysis on cancer genomes and provide testable  characterizations of driver aberration events in GBM.

HYPOTHESIS: Cucurbitacin D and goyazensolide, 2 plant-derived natural compounds,  possess potent growth-inhibitory activity in schwannoma and meningioma cells. BACKGROUND: Currently, no FDA-approved drugs are available for neurofibromatosis  type 2 (NF2)-associated schwannomas and meningiomas. Selected natural compounds  with antineoplastic activity, such as cucurbitacin D and goyazensolide, may be  developed as potential treatments for these tumors. METHODS: The Nf2-deficient mouse schwannoma Sch10545 and human benign meningioma  Ben-Men-1 cells were treated with various concentrations of cucurbitacin D and  goyazensolide. The effect on cell proliferation was determined using resazurin  assays. Flow cytometry was used to assess the cell cycle profiles. Western blot  analysis was performed to investigate the expression of various signaling  molecules related to the cell cycle and the AKT pathway. RESULTS: Cucurbitacin D inhibited proliferation of Sch10545 cells (IC50 ∼ 0.75  μM) and Ben-Men-1 cells (IC50 ∼0.2 μM). Goyazensolide also reduced cell  proliferation of Sch10545 cells (IC50 ∼0.9 μM) and Ben-Men-1 cells (IC50 ∼1 μM).  The G2/M population increased in both Sch10545 and Ben-Men-1 cells treated with  cucurbitacin D or goyazensolide around the IC50. Cucurbitacin and goyazensolide  substantially reduced the levels of cyclins E and A in treated Sch10545 and  Ben-Men-1 cells. Cucurbitacin D also inhibited cyclin B, phospho-AKT and  phospho-PRAS40 expression. In addition, goyazensolide reduced the levels of  phospho-AKT and NFκB and increased the expression of pro-apoptotic Bim in  Sch10545 and Ben-Men-1 cells. CONCLUSION: Both cucurbitacin D and goyazensolide effectively inhibit  proliferation of NF2-deficient schwannoma and meningioma cells, suggesting that  these natural compounds should be further evaluated as potential treatments for  NF2-related tumors.

Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is caused by mutations in the NF2 gene that  encodes a tumor-suppressor protein called merlin. NF2 is characterized by  formation of multiple schwannomas, meningiomas and ependymomas. Merlin  loss-of-function is associated with increased activity of Rac and p21-activated  kinases (PAKs) and deregulation of cytoskeletal organization. LIM domain kinases  (LIMK1 and 2) are substrate for Cdc42/Rac-PAK and modulate actin dynamics by  phosphorylating cofilin at serine-3. This modification inactivates the actin  severing and depolymerizing activity of cofilin. LIMKs also translocate into the  nucleus and regulate cell cycle progression. Significantly, LIMKs are  overexpressed in several tumor types, including skin, breast, lung, liver and  prostate. Here we report that mouse Schwann cells (MSCs) in which merlin  function is lost as a result of Nf2 exon2 deletion (Nf2(ΔEx2)) exhibited  increased levels of LIMK1, LIMK2 and active phospho-Thr508/505-LIMK1/2, as well  as phospho-Ser3-cofilin, compared with wild-type normal MSCs. Similarly, levels  of LIMK1 and 2 total protein and active phosphorylated forms were elevated in  human vestibular schwannomas compared with normal human Schwann cells (SCs).  Reintroduction of wild-type NF2 into Nf2(ΔEx2) MSC reduced LIMK1 and LIMK2  levels. We show that pharmacological inhibition of LIMK with BMS-5 decreased the  viability of Nf2(ΔEx2) MSCs in a dose-dependent manner, but did not affect  viability of control MSCs. Similarly, LIMK knockdown decreased viability of  Nf2(ΔEx2) MSCs. The decreased viability of Nf2(ΔEx2) MSCs was not due to  caspase-dependent or -independent apoptosis, but rather due to inhibition of  cell cycle progression as evidenced by accumulation of cells in G2/M phase.  Inhibition of LIMKs arrests cells in early mitosis by decreasing aurora A  activation. Our results suggest that LIMKs are potential drug targets for NF2  and tumors associated with merlin deficiency.

Author information: (1)From the Department of Cancer Biology, The Scripps Research Institute,  Jupiter, Florida 33458.  The p21-activated kinases (PAKs) are immediate downstream effectors of the  Rac/Cdc42 small G-proteins and implicated in promoting tumorigenesis in various  types of cancer including breast and lung carcinomas. Recent studies have  established a requirement for the PAKs in the pathogenesis of Neurofibromatosis  type 2 (NF2), a dominantly inherited cancer disorder caused by mutations at the  NF2 gene locus. Merlin, the protein product of the NF2 gene, has been shown to  negatively regulate signaling through the PAKs and the tumor suppressive  functions of Merlin are mediated, at least in part, through inhibition of the  PAKs. Knockdown of PAK1 and PAK2 expression, through RNAi-based approaches,  impairs the proliferation of NF2-null schwannoma cells in culture and inhibits  their ability to form tumors in vivo. These data implicate the PAKs as potential  therapeutic targets. High-throughput screening of a library of small molecules  combined with a structure-activity relationship approach resulted in the  identification of FRAX597, a small-molecule pyridopyrimidinone, as a potent  inhibitor of the group I PAKs. Crystallographic characterization of the  FRAX597/PAK1 complex identifies a phenyl ring that traverses the gatekeeper  residue and positions the thiazole in the back cavity of the ATP binding site, a  site rarely targeted by kinase inhibitors. FRAX597 inhibits the proliferation of  NF2-deficient schwannoma cells in culture and displayed potent anti-tumor  activity in vivo, impairing schwannoma development in an orthotopic model of  NF2. These studies identify a novel class of orally available ATP-competitive  Group I PAK inhibitors with significant potential for the treatment of NF2 and  other cancers.

Yin F(1), Yu J, Zheng Y, Chen Q, Zhang N, Pan D.  Author information: (1)Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Howard Hughes Medical  Institute, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205,  USA.  Although Merlin/NF2 was discovered two decades ago as a tumor suppressor  underlying Neurofibromatosis type II, its precise molecular mechanism remains  poorly understood. Recent studies in Drosophila revealed a potential link  between Merlin and the Hippo pathway by placing Merlin genetically upstream of  the kinase Hpo/Mst. In contrast to the commonly depicted linear model of Merlin  functioning through Hpo/Mst, here we show that in both Drosophila and mammals,  Merlin promotes downstream Hippo signaling without activating the intrinsic  kinase activity of Hpo/Mst. Instead, Merlin directly binds and recruits the  effector kinase Wts/Lats to the plasma membrane. Membrane recruitment, in turn,  promotes Wts phosphorylation by the Hpo-Sav kinase complex. We further show that  disruption of the actin cytoskeleton promotes Merlin-Wts interactions, which  implicates Merlin in actin-mediated regulation of Hippo signaling. Our findings  elucidate an important molecular function of Merlin and highlight the plasma  membrane as a critical subcellular compartment for Hippo signal transduction.

Author information: (1)Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's  Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine,  Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA.  Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and Costello syndrome Rasopathy  have behavioral deficits. In NF1 patients, these may correlate with white matter  enlargement and aberrant myelin. To model these features, we induced Nf1 loss or  HRas hyperactivation in mouse oligodendrocytes. Enlarged brain white matter  tracts correlated with myelin decompaction, downregulation of claudin-11, and  mislocalization of connexin-32. Surprisingly, non-cell-autonomous defects in  perivascular astrocytes and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) developed, implicating  a soluble mediator. Nitric oxide (NO) can disrupt tight junctions and gap  junctions, and NO and NO synthases (NOS1-NOS3) were upregulated in mutant white  matter. Treating mice with the NOS inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester or  the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine corrected cellular phenotypes. CNP-HRasG12V  mice also displayed locomotor hyperactivity, which could be rescued by  antioxidant treatment. We conclude that Nf1/Ras regulates oligodendrocyte NOS  and that dysregulated NO signaling in oligodendrocytes can alter the surrounding  vasculature. The data suggest that antioxidants may improve some behavioral  deficits in Rasopathy patients.  Copyright © 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

PMID:24040940,Molecular-guided therapy predictions reveal drug resistance phenotypes and treatment alternatives in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.,"Molecular-guided therapy predictions reveal drug resistance phenotypes and  treatment alternatives in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.  Peacock JD(1), Cherba D, Kampfschulte K, Smith MK, Monks NR, Webb CP, Steensma  M.  Author information: (1)Van Andel Research Institute, Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA.  matt.steensma@vai.org.  BACKGROUND: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are rare highly  aggressive sarcomas that affect 8-13% of people with neurofibromatosis type 1.  The prognosis for patients with MPNST is very poor. Despite TOP2A overexpression  in these tumors, doxorubicin resistance is common, and the mechanisms of  chemotherapy resistance in MPNST are poorly understood. Molecular-guided therapy  prediction is an emerging strategy for treatment refractory sarcomas that  involves identification of therapy response and resistance mechanisms in  individual tumors. Here, we report the results from a personalized,  molecular-guided therapy analysis of MPNST samples. METHODS: Established molecular-guided therapy prediction software algorithms  were used to analyze published microarray data from human MPNST samples and cell  lines, with benign neurofibroma tissue controls. MPNST and benign  neurofibroma-derived cell lines were used for confirmatory in vitro  experimentation using quantitative real-time PCR and growth inhibition assays.  Microarray data was analyzed using Affymetrix expression console MAS 5.0 method.  Significance was calculated with Welch's t-test with non-corrected p-value <  0.05 and validated using permutation testing across samples. Paired Student's  t-tests were used to compare relative EC50 values from independent growth  inhibition experiments. RESULTS: Molecular guided therapy predictions highlight substantial variability  amongst human MPNST samples in expression of drug target and drug resistance  pathways, as well as some similarities amongst samples, including common  up-regulation of DNA repair mechanisms. In a subset of MPNSTs, high expression  of ABCC1 is observed, serving as a predicted contra-indication for doxorubicin  and related therapeutics in these patients. These microarray-based results are  confirmed with quantitative, real-time PCR and immunofluorescence. The  functional effect of drug efflux in MPNST-derived cells is confirmed using in  vitro growth inhibition assays. Alternative therapeutics supported by the  molecular-guided therapy predictions are reported and tested in MPNST-derived  cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the substantial molecular heterogeneity of  MPNSTs and validate molecular-guided therapy predictions in vitro. The observed  molecular heterogeneity in MPNSTs influences therapy prediction. Also,  mechanisms involving drug transport and DNA damage repair are primary mediators  of MPNST chemotherapy resistance. Together, these findings support the utility  of individualized therapy in MPNST as in other sarcomas, and provide initial  proof-of concept that individualized therapy prediction can be accomplished.

Licis AK(1), Vallorani A, Gao F, Chen C, Lenox J, Yamada KA, Duntley SP, Gutmann  DH.  Author information: (1)1Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis,  MO, USA.  Children with neurodevelopmental disorders are at increased risk for sleep  issues, which affect quality of life, cognitive function, and behavior. To  determine the prevalence of sleep problems in children with the common  neurodevelopmental disorder neurofibromatosis type 1, a cross-sectional study  was performed on 129 affected subjects and 89 unaffected siblings, age 2 to 17  years, using the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children questionnaire. Children  with neurofibromatosis type 1 were significantly more likely to have  disturbances in initiating and maintaining sleep, arousal, sleep-wake  transition, and hyperhidrosis, but not problems with abnormal sleep breathing,  or excessive somnolence. Although the overall sleep scores were higher in  children with neurofibromatosis type 1, this was not related to a coexisting  attention deficit disorder, cognitive impairment, or stimulant medication use.  Collectively, these results demonstrate that children with neurofibromatosis  type 1 are more likely to have sleep disturbances, and support the use of  appropriate interventions for this at-risk population.

Adviento B(1), Corbin IL, Widjaja F, Desachy G, Enrique N, Rosser T, Risi S,  Marco EJ, Hendren RL, Bearden CE, Rauen KA, Weiss LA.  Author information: (1)Department of Psychiatry, University of California San Francisco, San  Francisco, California, USA.  BACKGROUND: Mutations in Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (Ras/MAPK) pathway  genes lead to a class of disorders known as RASopathies, including  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), Noonan syndrome (NS), Costello syndrome (CS),  and cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (CFC). Previous work has suggested potential  genetic and phenotypic overlap between dysregulation of Ras/MAPK signalling and  autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Although the literature offers conflicting  evidence for association of NF1 and autism, there has been no systematic  evaluation of autism traits in the RASopathies as a class to support a role for  germline Ras/MAPK activation in ASDs. METHODS: We examined the association of autism traits with NF1, NS, CS and CFC,  comparing affected probands with unaffected sibling controls and subjects with  idiopathic ASDs using the qualitative Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ)  and the quantitative Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS). RESULTS: Each of the four major RASopathies showed evidence for increased  qualitative and quantitative autism traits compared with sibling controls.  Further, each RASopathy exhibited a distinct distribution of quantitative social  impairment. Levels of social responsiveness show some evidence of correlation  between sibling pairs, and autism-like impairment showed a male bias similar to  idiopathic ASDs. CONCLUSIONS: Higher prevalence and severity of autism traits in RASopathies  compared to unaffected siblings suggests that dysregulation of Ras/MAPK  signalling during development may be implicated in ASD risk. Evidence for sex  bias and potential sibling correlation suggests that autism traits in the  RASopathies share characteristics with autism traits in the general population  and clinical ASD population and can shed light on idiopathic ASDs.

Erratum in     J Pathol. 2014 Jul;233(3):320. Igram, Davis R [corrected to Ingram, Davis  R].  Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs), which develop sporadically  or from neurofibromatosis, recur frequently with high metastatic potential and  poor outcome. The polycomb group protein enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2) is  an important regulator for various human malignancies. However, the function of  EZH2 in MPNSTs is unknown. Here we report that the EZH2-miR-30d-KPNB1 signalling  pathway is critical for MPNST tumour cell survival in vitro and tumourigenicity  in vivo. Up-regulated EZH2 in MPNST inhibits miR-30d transcription via promoter  binding activity, leading to enhanced expression of the nuclear transport  receptor KPNB1 that is inhibited by miR-30d targeting of KPNB1 3' UTR region.  Furthermore, inhibition of EZH2 or KPNB1, or miR-30d over-expression, induces  MPNST cell apoptosis in vitro and suppresses tumourigenesis in vivo. More  importantly, forced over-expression of KPNB1 rescues MPNST cell apoptosis  induced by EZH2 knockdown. Immunohistochemical analyses show that EZH2 and KPNB1  over-expression is observed in human MPNST specimens and is negatively  associated with miR-30d expression. Our findings identify a novel signalling  pathway involved in MPNST tumourigenesis, and also suggest that  EZH2-miR-30d-KPNB1 signalling represents multiple potential therapeutic  targetable nodes for MPNST.

Pheochromocytomas (PHEOs) and paragangliomas (PGLs; extra-adrenal tumors) are  rare neuroendocrine chromaffin cell tumors with a hereditary background in about  30%-35%. Those caused by succinate dehydrogenase subunit B (SDHB) germline  mutations are associated with a high metastatic potential and ultimately higher  patient mortality. Succinate dehydrogenase converts succinate to fumarate,  uniquely linking the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. SDH mutations  result in the accumulation of succinate associated with various metabolic  disturbances and the shift to aerobic glycolysis in tumor tissue. In the present  study, we measured succinate and fumarate levels in mouse pheochromocytoma (MPC)  and mouse tumor tissue (MTT) cells and in 10 apparently sporadic, 10 SDHB-, 5  SDHD-, and 2 neurofibromatosis 1-related PHEOs/PGLs and plasma samples using  mass spectrometry. We found that the succinate-to-fumarate ratio was  significantly higher in the SDHB- and SDHD-related PGLs than in apparently  sporadic and neurofibromatosis 1-related PHEOs/PGLs (P = .0376). To further  support our data, we silenced SDHB expression in MPC and MTT cells and evaluated  the succinate and fumarate levels. Compared with control samples, SDHB-silenced  MTT cells also showed an increase in the succinate-to-fumarate ratio (MTT cells:  2.45 vs 7.53), similar to the findings in SDHB-related PGLs. The present  findings for the first time demonstrate a significantly increased  succinate-to-fumarate ratio in SDHB/D-related PGLs and thus suggest this ratio  may be used as a new metabolic marker for the detection of SDHB/D-related  PHEOs/PGLs.

PMID:24197987,Vision specific quality of life in children with optic pathway gliomas.,"Vision specific quality of life in children with optic pathway gliomas.  Avery RA(1), Hardy KK.  Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Children's National Medical Center, 111 Michigan  Ave, NW, Washington, DC, 20010, USA, ravery@childrensnational.org.  Children with optic pathway gliomas (OPGs) frequently experience vision loss  from their tumors. Most pediatric OPG research has focused on radiographic and  visual outcomes, yet the impact of vision loss on quality of life (QOL) in  children with OPGs has not been studied. The present study prospectively  recruited children ≤ 10 years of age with sporadic or neurofibromatosis type 1  (NF1)-related OPGs. Vision specific QOL was assessed by parent proxy using the  Children's Visual Function Questionnaire (CVFQ), and scores were analyzed  according to magnitude of visual acuity (VA) loss and presence of visual field  (VF) loss. Thirty-six subjects completed the study (53 % female) with median age  of 4.6 years. Children with mild, moderate and severe vision loss have lower  CVFQ subscale scores, indicating a lower vision specific QOL, compared to those  with normal vision. Lower Competence scores were noted in participants with more  profound vision loss (p < 0.05), reflecting a decreased ability to complete  activities of daily living (e.g., feeding, grooming). Children with two visually  impaired eyes were rated as having greater difficulty with social interactions  and pleasurable activities (Personality subscale, p = 0.039) compared to those  with only one impaired eye. In summary, our findings demonstrate that children  with vision loss secondary to their OPG have a decreased vision specific QOL  compared to those with normal vision. Measuring vision specific QOL may be  considered a meaningful secondary outcome measure for pediatric OPG clinical  trials.

Electronic address: dingram@iu.edu.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) results from mutations in the NF1  tumor-suppressor gene, which encodes neurofibromin, a negative regulator of  diverse Ras signaling cascades. Arterial stenosis is a nonneoplastic  manifestation of NF1 that predisposes some patients to debilitating morbidity  and sudden death. Recent murine studies demonstrate that Nf1 heterozygosity  (Nf1(+/-)) in monocytes/macrophages significantly enhances intimal proliferation  after arterial injury. However, the downstream Ras effector pathway responsible  for this phenotype is unknown. Based on in vitro assays demonstrating enhanced  extracellular signal-related kinase (Erk) signaling in Nf1(+/-) macrophages and  vascular smooth muscle cells and in vivo evidence of Erk amplification without  alteration of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling in Nf1(+/-) neointimas, we  tested the hypothesis that Ras-Erk signaling regulates intimal proliferation in  a murine model of NF1 arterial stenosis. By using a well-established in vivo  model of inflammatory cell migration and standard cell culture,  neurofibromin-deficient macrophages demonstrate enhanced sensitivity to growth  factor stimulation in vivo and in vitro, which is significantly diminished in  the presence of PD0325901, a specific inhibitor of Ras-Erk signaling in phase 2  clinical trials for cancer. After carotid artery injury, Nf1(+/-) mice  demonstrated increased intimal proliferation compared with wild-type mice. Daily  administration of PD0325901 significantly reduced Nf1(+/-) neointima formation  to levels of wild-type mice. These studies identify the Ras-Erk pathway in  neurofibromin-deficient macrophages as the aberrant pathway responsible for  enhanced neointima formation.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-β/δ (PPARβ/δ) inhibits skin  tumorigenesis through mechanisms that may be dependent on HRAS signaling. The  present study examined the hypothesis that PPARβ/δ promotes HRAS-induced  senescence resulting in suppression of tumorigenesis. PPARβ/δ expression  increased p-ERK and decreased p-AKT activity. Increased p-ERK activity results  from the dampened HRAS-induced negative feedback response mediated in part  through transcriptional upregulation of RAS guanyl-releasing protein 1 (RASGRP1)  by PPARβ/δ. Decreased p-AKT activity results from repression of integrin-linked  kinase (ILK) and phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDPK1) expression.  Decreased p-AKT activity in turn promotes cellular senescence through  upregulation of p53 and p27 expression. Both over-expression of RASGRP1 and  shRNA-mediated knockdown of ILK partially restore cellular senescence in  Pparβ/δ-null cells. Higher PPARβ/δ expression is also correlated with increased  senescence observed in human benign neurofibromas and colon adenoma lesions in  vivo. These results demonstrate that PPARβ/δ promotes senescence to inhibit  tumorigenesis and provide new mechanistic insights into HRAS-induced cellular  senescence.

PMID:24232507,Neuregulin-1 overexpression and Trp53 haploinsufficiency cooperatively promote de novo malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor pathogenesis.,"Neuregulin-1 overexpression and Trp53 haploinsufficiency cooperatively promote  de novo malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor pathogenesis.  Brosius SN, Turk AN, Byer SJ, Brossier NM, Kohli L, Whitmire A, Mikhail FM, Roth  KA, Carroll SL.  Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are Schwann cell-derived  malignancies that arise from plexiform neurofibromas in patients with mutation  of the neurofibromin 1 (NF1) gene. We have shown that the growth factor  neuregulin-1 (NRG1) also contributes to human neurofibroma and MPNST  pathogenesis and that outbred C57BL/6J × SJL/J transgenic mice overexpressing  NRG1 in Schwann cells (P0-GGFβ3 mice) recapitulate the process of  neurofibroma-MPNST progression. However, it is unclear whether NRG1 acts  predominantly within NF1-regulated signaling cascades or instead activates other  essential cascades that cooperate with NF1 loss to promote tumorigenesis. We now  report that tumorigenesis is suppressed in inbred P0-GGFβ3 mice on a C57BL/6J  background. To determine whether NRG1 overexpression interacts with reduced Nf1  or Trp53 gene dosage to ""unmask"" tumorigenesis in these animals, we followed  cohorts of inbred P0-GGFβ3;Nf1+/−, P0-GGFβ3;Trp53+/− and control (P0-GGFβ3,  Nf1+/− and Trp53+/−) mice for 1 year. We found no reduction in survival or  tumors in control and P0-GGFβ3;Nf1+/− mice. In contrast, P0-GGFβ3;Trp53+/− mice  died on average at 226 days, with MPNSTs present in 95 % of these mice. MPNSTs  in inbred P0-GGFβ3;Trp53+/− mice arose de novo from micro-MPNSTs that uniformly  develop intraganglionically. These micro-MPNSTs are of lower grade (WHO grade  II-III) than the major MPNSTs (WHO grade III-IV); array comparative genomic  hybridization showed that lower grade MPNSTs also had fewer genomic  abnormalities. Thus, P0-GGFβ3;Trp53+/− mice represent a novel model of low- to  high-grade MPNST progression. We further conclude that NRG1 promotes peripheral  nervous system neoplasia predominantly via its effects on the signaling cascades  affected by Nf1 loss.

The neurofibromatoses (NF)--including neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1),  neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2), and schwannomatosis--are related tumor-suppressor  syndromes characterized by a predisposition to multiple tumor types and other  disease manifestations, which often result in functional disability, reduced  quality of life, pain, and, in some cases, malignancy. With increasing knowledge  of the biology and pathogenesis of NF, clinical trials with targeted agents  directed at NF tumors have become available. Most clinical trials for patients  with NF have used designs and endpoints similar to oncology trials. However,  differences in the disease manifestations and natural history of NF (compared to  cancers) require the development of new designs and endpoints to perform  meaningful NF clinical trials. The Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and  Schwannomatosis (REiNS) International Collaboration was established in 2011 at  the Children's Tumor Foundation meeting to achieve consensus within the NF  community about the design of future clinical trials, with a specific emphasis  on endpoints. The REiNS Collaboration includes 7 working groups that focus on  imaging of tumor response; functional, visual, patient-reported, and  neurocognitive outcomes; whole-body MRI; and disease biomarkers. This supplement  includes the first series of recommendations by the REiNS Collaboration. The  hope is that these recommendations will be used by members of the group and by  researchers outside of the REiNS International Collaboration to standardize the  measurement of outcomes and thus improve clinical trials for patients with NF.  Ultimately, we plan to engage industry partners and national regulatory agencies  in this process to facilitate the approval of drugs for patients with NF.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of the Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and  Schwannomatosis Visual Outcomes Committee is to define the best functional  outcome measures for future neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated optic  pathway glioma (OPG) clinical trials. METHODS: The committee considered the components of vision, other ophthalmologic  parameters affected by OPG, potential biomarkers of visual function, and quality  of life measures to arrive at consensus-based, evidence-driven recommendations  for objective and measurable functional endpoints for OPG trials. RESULTS: Visual acuity (VA) assessments using consistent quantitative testing  methods are recommended as the main functional outcome measure for NF1-OPG  clinical trials. Teller acuity cards are recommended for use as the primary VA  endpoint, and HOTV as a secondary endpoint once subjects are old enough to  complete it. The optic disc should be assessed for pallor, as this appears to be  a contributory variable that may affect the interpretation of VA change over  time. Given the importance of capturing patient-reported outcomes in clinical  trials, evaluating visual quality of life using the Children's Visual Function  Questionnaire as a secondary endpoint is also proposed. CONCLUSIONS: The use of these key functional endpoints will be essential for  evaluating the efficacy of future OPG clinical trials.

OBJECTIVE: Neurofibromatosis (NF)-related benign tumors such as plexiform  neurofibromas (PN) and vestibular schwannomas (VS) can cause substantial  morbidity. Clinical trials directed at these tumors have become available. Due  to differences in disease manifestations and the natural history of NF-related  tumors, response criteria used for solid cancers (1-dimensional/RECIST [Response  Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors] and bidimensional/World Health  Organization) have limited applicability. No standardized response criteria for  benign NF tumors exist. The goal of the Tumor Measurement Working Group of the  REiNS (Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis) committee  is to propose consensus guidelines for the evaluation of imaging response in  clinical trials for NF tumors. METHODS: Currently used imaging endpoints, designs of NF clinical trials, and  knowledge of the natural history of NF-related tumors, in particular PN and VS,  were reviewed. Consensus recommendations for response evaluation for future  studies were developed based on this review and the expertise of group members. RESULTS: MRI with volumetric analysis is recommended to sensitively and  reproducibly evaluate changes in tumor size in clinical trials. Volumetric  analysis requires adherence to specific imaging recommendations. A 20% volume  change was chosen to indicate a decrease or increase in tumor size. Use of these  criteria in future trials will enable meaningful comparison of results across  studies. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed imaging response evaluation guidelines, along with  validated clinical outcome measures, will maximize the ability to identify  potentially active agents for patients with NF and benign tumors.

OBJECTIVES: Neurofibromatosis (NF) is a genetic disease with multiple clinical  manifestations that can significantly impact quality of life (QOL). Clinical  trials should include patient-reported outcomes (PROs) as endpoints to assess  treatment effects on various aspects of QOL, but there is no consensus on the  selection and use of such measures in NF. This article describes the PRO Working  Group of the Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis  (REiNS) Collaboration, its main goals, methods for identifying appropriate PRO  measures for NF clinical trials, and recommendations for assessing pain  intensity. METHODS: The REiNS PRO group selected core endpoint domains important to assess  in NF. The members developed criteria to rate PRO measures, including patient  characteristics, psychometric properties, and feasibility, and utilized a  systematic process to evaluate PROs for NF clinical trials. Within the subdomain  of pain intensity, the group reviewed the Numerical Rating Scale-11 (NRS-11),  the Visual Analogue Scale, and the Faces Pain Scale-Revised using this process. RESULTS: Based on the review criteria, each of these pain intensity scales is  brief, reliable, valid, and widely used. However, the NRS-11 was given the  highest rating for use in NF clinical trials due to recommendations from pain  experts and other consensus groups, its extensive use in research, strong  psychometric data including sensitivity to change, and excellent feasibility in  ages ≥ 8 years. CONCLUSIONS: The systematic review criteria and process are effective for  identifying appropriate PRO measures and provide information utilized by the  REiNS Collaboration to achieve consensus regarding PROs in NF clinical trials.

Petrilli A(1), Bott M, Fernández-Valle C.  Author information: (1)Department of Biomedical Science, College of Medicine, University of Central  Florida, Lake Nona-Orlando, Florida, USA.  Mutations in the NF2 gene cause Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2), a disorder  characterized by the development of schwannomas, meningiomas and ependymomas in  the nervous system. Merlin, a tumor suppressor encoded by the NF2 gene,  modulates activity of many essential signaling pathways. Yet despite increasing  knowledge of merlin function, there are no NF2 drug therapies. In a pilot  high-throughput screen of the Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds, we  assayed for compounds capable of reducing viability of mouse Schwann cells (MSC)  with Nf2 inactivation as a cellular model for human NF2 schwannomas. AGK2, a  SIRT2 (sirtuin 2) inhibitor, was identified as a candidate compound. SIRT2 is  one of seven mammalian sirtuins that are NAD+-dependent protein deacetylases. We  show that merlin-mutant MSC have higher expression levels of SIRT2 and lower  levels of overall lysine acetylation than wild-type control MSC. Pharmacological  inhibition of SIRT2 decreases merlin-mutant MSC viability in a dose dependent  manner without substantially reducing wild-type MSC viability. Inhibition of  SIRT2 activity in merlin-mutant MSC is accompanied by release of lactate  dehydrogenase and high mobility group box 1 protein into the medium in the  absence of significant apoptosis, autophagy, or cell cycle arrest. These  findings suggest that SIRT2 inhibition triggers necrosis of merlin-mutant MSCs  and that SIRT2 is a potential NF2 drug target.

Author information: (1)Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris, Department of Neurosurgery, Hôpital  Beaujon, Clichy, France; INSERM, Génomique Fonctionnelle des Tumeurs Solides,  IUH, Paris, France.  Meningiomas are common central nervous system tumors. The World Health  Organization (WHO) defines three grades, predictive of the risk of recurrence.  These tumors can relapse frequently and sometimes undergo malignant  transformation. Maintenance of telomere length is a key process in malignant  progression, and mutations in TERT promoter have recently been identified in  various types of cancer. We sequenced the TERT promoter in 85 meningiomas from  73 patients. We found a high incidence of TERT promoter mutations in patients  with meningiomas undergoing malignant histological progression (28%, n = 5/18  patients). In this subset of patients with histological progression, TERT  promoter mutations were found in both the lowest and the highest grade tumors,  and in both NF2-mutated and nonmutated samples. In contrast, one mutation was  identified in 35 meningiomas without recurrence or progression, belonging to  various histological grades. This sample was an aggressive meningioma in a  patient who died shortly after surgery. Interestingly, tumors showing relapse  without histological progression were not mutated for TERT promoter (n = 20).  Finally, TERT promoter mutations were associated with a marked increase in TERT  expression. Thus, TERT promoter mutations are pivotal genetic alterations  involved in malignant progression of meningiomas and could be used as a  biomarker to identify meningiomas at risk of malignant transformation.  © 2013 International Society of Neuropathology.

Author information: (1)Authors' Affiliations: Departments of Dermatology, Developmental Biology, and  Biochemistry, and Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of  Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Dallas, Texas.  Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is an autosomal disorder that affects neural  crest-derived tissues, leading to a wide spectrum of clinical presentations.  Patients commonly present with plexiform neurofibromas, benign but debilitating  growths that can transform into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors  (MPNST), a main cause of mortality. Currently, surgery is the primary course of  treatment for MPNST, but with the limitation that these tumors are highly  invasive. Radiotherapy is another treatment option, but is undesirable because  it can induce additional mutations. Patients with MPNST may also receive  doxorubicin as therapy, but this DNA-intercalating agent has relatively low  tumor specificity and limited efficacy. In this study, we exploited a robust  genetically engineered mouse model of MPNST that recapitulates human  NF1-associated MPNST to identify a novel small chemical compound that inhibits  tumor cell growth. Compound 21 (Cpd21) inhibits growth of all available in vitro  models of MPNST and human MPNST cell lines, while remaining nontoxic to normally  dividing Schwann cells or mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We show that this  compound delays the cell cycle and leads to cellular apoptosis. Moreover, Cpd21  can reduce MPNST burden in a mouse allograft model, underscoring the compound's  potential as a novel chemotherapeutic agent.

Electronic address: deutscsi@evms.edu.  Overactivation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) has been implicated  in the pathogenesis of syndromic forms of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), such  as tuberous sclerosis complex, neurofibromatosis 1, and fragile X syndrome.  Administration of mTORC1 (mTOR complex 1) inhibitors (e.g. rapamycin) in  syndromic mouse models of ASDs improved behavior, cognition, and neuropathology.  However, since only a minority of ASDs are due to the effects of single genes  (∼10%), there is a need to explore inhibition of mTOR activity in mouse models  that may be more relevant to the majority of nonsyndromic presentations, such as  the genetically inbred BTBR T(+)Itpr3(tf)/J (BTBR) mouse model of ASDs. BTBR  mice have social impairment and exhibit increased stereotypic behavior. In prior  work, d-cycloserine, a partial glycineB site agonist that targets the  N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, was shown to improve sociability in both  Balb/c and BTBR mouse models of ASDs. Importantly, NMDA receptor activation  regulates mTOR signaling activity. The current study investigated the ability of  rapamycin (10mg/kg, i.p.×four days), an mTORC1 inhibitor, to improve sociability  and stereotypic behavior in BTBR mice. Using a standard paradigm to assess mouse  social behavior, rapamycin improved several measures of sociability in the BTBR  mouse, suggesting that mTOR overactivation represents a therapeutic target that  mediates or contributes to impaired sociability in the BTBR mouse model of ASDs.  Interestingly, there was no effect of rapamycin on stereotypic behaviors in this  mouse model.  Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Author information: (1)H.M. Laboratory, P.H. Laboratory, and M.E.T. Laboratory, Leibniz Institute  for Age Research - Fritz Lipmann Institute, 07745 Jena, Germany.  Receptor tyrosine kinases participate in several signaling pathways through  small G proteins such as Ras (rat sarcoma). An important component in the  activation of these G proteins is Son of sevenless (SOS), which catalyzes the  nucleotide exchange on Ras. For optimal activity, a second Ras molecule acts as  an allosteric activator by binding to a second Ras-binding site within SOS. This  allosteric Ras-binding site is blocked by autoinhibitory domains of SOS. We have  reported recently that Ras activation also requires the actin-binding proteins  ezrin, radixin, and moesin. Here we report the mechanism by which ezrin  modulates SOS activity and thereby Ras activation. Active ezrin enhances  Ras/MAPK signaling and interacts with both SOS and Ras in vivo and in vitro.  Moreover, in vitro kinetic assays with recombinant proteins show that ezrin also  is important for the activity of SOS itself. Ezrin interacts with GDP-Ras and  with the Dbl homology (DH)/pleckstrin homology (PH) domains of SOS, bringing  GDP-Ras to the proximity of the allosteric site of SOS. These actions of ezrin  are antagonized by the neurofibromatosis type 2 tumor-suppressor protein merlin.  We propose an additional essential step in SOS/Ras control that is relevant for  human cancer as well as all physiological processes involving Ras.

Schulz A(1), Kyselyova A, Baader SL, Jung MJ, Zoch A, Mautner VF, Hagel C,  Morrison H.  Author information: (1)1 Leibniz Institute for Age Research, Fritz Lipmann Institute, 07745 Jena,  Germany.  Axonal surface proteins encompass a group of heterogeneous molecules, which  exert a variety of different functions in the highly interdependent relationship  between axons and Schwann cells. We recently revealed that the tumour suppressor  protein merlin, mutated in the hereditary tumour syndrome neurofibromatosis type  2, impacts significantly on axon structure maintenance in the peripheral nervous  system. We now report on a role of neuronal merlin in the regulation of the  axonal surface protein neuregulin 1 important for modulating Schwann cell  differentiation and myelination. Specifically, neuregulin 1 type III expression  is reduced in sciatic nerve tissue of neuron-specific knockout animals as well  as in biopsies from seven patients with neurofibromatosis type 2. In vitro  experiments performed on both the P19 neuronal cell line and primary dorsal root  ganglion cells demonstrate the influence of merlin on neuregulin 1 type III  expression. Moreover, expression of ERBB2, a Schwann cell receptor for  neuregulin 1 ligands is increased in nerve tissue of both neuron-specific merlin  knockout animals and patients with neurofibromatosis type 2, demonstrating for  the first time that axonal merlin indirectly regulates Schwann cell behaviour.  Collectively, we have identified that neuronally expressed merlin can influence  Schwann cell activity in a cell-extrinsic manner.

(#)Contributed equally  The simplicity of programming the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short  palindromic repeats)-associated nuclease Cas9 to modify specific genomic loci  suggests a new way to interrogate gene function on a genome-wide scale. We show  that lentiviral delivery of a genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (GeCKO) library  targeting 18,080 genes with 64,751 unique guide sequences enables both negative  and positive selection screening in human cells. First, we used the GeCKO  library to identify genes essential for cell viability in cancer and pluripotent  stem cells. Next, in a melanoma model, we screened for genes whose loss is  involved in resistance to vemurafenib, a therapeutic RAF inhibitor. Our  highest-ranking candidates include previously validated genes NF1 and MED12, as  well as novel hits NF2, CUL3, TADA2B, and TADA1. We observe a high level of  consistency between independent guide RNAs targeting the same gene and a high  rate of hit confirmation, demonstrating the promise of genome-scale screening  with Cas9.

AIMS: To study the expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-x, as well the presence of cleaved  caspase-3 in neurofibromas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. The  expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x and the presence of cleaved caspase 3 were  compared to clinicopathological features of malignant peripheral nerve sheath  tumors and their impact on survival rates were also investigated.

Immunoquantification was  performed by computerized digital image analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Apoptosis is altered in neurofibromas and mainly in malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumors. High levels of cleaved caspase-3 are more common  in tumors with more aggressive histological features and it is associated with  lower disease free survival of patients with malignant peripheral nerve sheath  tumors.

(#)Contributed equally  Malignant mesothelioma is a highly aggressive, asbestos-related cancer  frequently marked by mutations of both NF2 and CDKN2A. We demonstrate that  germline knockout of one allele of each of these genes causes accelerated onset  and progression of asbestos-induced malignant mesothelioma compared with  asbestos-exposed Nf2(+/-) or wild-type mice. Ascites from some  Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice exhibited large tumor spheroids, and tail vein  injections of malignant mesothelioma cells established from these mice, but not  from Nf2(+/-) or wild-type mice, produced numerous tumors in the lung,  suggesting increased metastatic potential of tumor cells from  Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice. Intraperitoneal injections of malignant mesothelioma  cells derived from Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice into severe combined  immunodeficient mice produced tumors that penetrated the diaphragm and pleural  cavity and harbored increased cancer stem cells (CSC). Malignant mesothelioma  cells from Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice stained positively for CSC markers and  formed CSC spheroids in vitro more efficiently than counterparts from wild-type  mice. Moreover, tumor cells from Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice showed elevated c-Met  expression/activation, which was partly dependent on p53-mediated regulation of  miR-34a and required for tumor migration/invasiveness and maintenance of the CSC  population. Collectively, these studies demonstrate in vivo that inactivation of  Nf2 and Cdkn2a cooperate to drive the development of highly aggressive malignant  mesotheliomas characterized by enhanced tumor spreading capability and the  presence of a CSC population associated with p53/miR-34a-dependent activation of  c-Met. These findings suggest that cooperativity between losses of Nf2 and  Cdkn2a plays a fundamental role in driving the highly aggressive tumorigenic  phenotype considered to be a hallmark of malignant mesothelioma.  ©2013 AACR.

Ann Neurol. 2014 May;75(5):800-1. doi: 10.1002/ana.24156.  OBJECTIVE: Children with neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) are at risk for developing  numerous nervous system abnormalities, including cognitive problems and brain  tumors (optic pathway glioma). Currently, there are few prognostic factors that  predict clinical manifestations or outcomes in patients, even in families with  an identical NF1 gene mutation. In this study, we leveraged Nf1 genetically  engineered mice (GEM) to define the potential role of sex as a clinically  relevant modifier of NF1-associated neuronal dysfunction. METHODS: Deidentified clinical data were analyzed to determine the impact of sex  on optic glioma-associated visual decline in children with NF1. In addition, Nf1  GEM were employed as experimental platforms to investigate sexually dimorphic  differences in learning/memory, visual acuity, retinal ganglion cell (RGC)  death, and Nf1 protein (neurofibromin)-regulated signaling pathway function (Ras  activity, cyclic adenosine monophosphate [cAMP], and dopamine levels). RESULTS: Female patients with NF1-associated optic glioma were twice as likely  to undergo brain magnetic resonance imaging for visual symptoms and 3× more  likely to require treatment for visual decline than their male counterparts. As  such, only female Nf1 GEM exhibited a decrement in optic glioma-associated  visual acuity, shorter RGC axons, and attenuated cAMP levels. In contrast, only  male Nf1 GEM showed spatial learning/memory deficits, increased Ras activity,  and reduced dopamine levels. INTERPRETATION: Collectively, these observations establish sex as a major  prognostic factor underlying neuronal dysfunction in NF1, and suggest that sex  should be considered when interpreting future preclinical and clinical study  results.  © 2014 Child Neurology Society/American Neurological Association.

North M, Shuga J, Fromowitz M, Loguinov A, Shannon K, Zhang L, Smith MT, Vulpe  CD(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Nutritional Science and Toxicology, University of California,  Berkeley, California 94720, USA. vulpe@berkeley.edu.  BACKGROUND: Benzene is an established human leukemogen, with a ubiquitous  environmental presence leading to significant population exposure. In a  genome-wide functional screen in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae,  inactivation of IRA2, a yeast ortholog of the human tumor suppressor gene NF1  (Neurofibromin), enhanced sensitivity to hydroquinone, an important benzene  metabolite. Increased Ras signaling is implicated as a causal factor in the  increased pre-disposition to leukemia of individuals with mutations in NF1. METHODS: Growth inhibition of yeast by hydroquinone was assessed in mutant  strains exhibiting varying levels of Ras activity. Subsequently, effects of  hydroquinone on both genotoxicity (measured by micronucleus formation) and  proliferation of WT and Nf1 null murine hematopoietic precursors were assessed. RESULTS: Here we show that the Ras status of both yeast and mammalian cells  modulates hydroquinone toxicity, indicating potential synergy between Ras  signaling and benzene toxicity. Specifically, enhanced Ras signaling increases  both hydroquinone-mediated growth inhibition in yeast and genotoxicity in  mammalian hematopoetic precursors as measured by an in vitro erythroid  micronucleus assay. Hydroquinone also increases proliferation of CFU-GM  progenitor cells in mice with Nf1 null bone marrow relative to WT, the same cell  type associated with benzene-associated leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Together our findings show that hydroquinone toxicity is modulated  by Ras signaling. Individuals with abnormal Ras signaling could be more  vulnerable to developing myeloid diseases after exposure to benzene. We note  that hydroquinone is used cosmetically as a skin-bleaching agent, including by  individuals with cafe-au-lait spots (which may be present in individuals with  neurofibromatosis who have a mutation in NF1), which could be unadvisable given  our findings.

Comment in     Neuro Oncol. 2014 Apr;16(4):471-2. doi: 10.1093/neuonc/nou037.  BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic  disorder, resulting in a variety of neural tumors, with bilateral vestibular  schwannomas as the most frequent manifestation. Recently, merlin, the NF2 tumor  suppressor, has been identified as a novel negative regulator of mammalian  target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1); functional loss of merlin was shown to  result in elevated mTORC1 signaling in NF2-related tumors. Thus, mTORC1 pathway  inhibition may be a useful targeted therapeutic approach. METHODS: We studied in vitro cell models, cohorts of mice allografted with  Nf2(-/-) Schwann cells, and a genetically modified mouse model of NF2 schwannoma  in order to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed targeted therapy for NF2. RESULTS: We found that treatment with the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin reduced the  severity of NF2-related Schwann cell tumorigenesis without significant toxicity.  Consistent with these results, in an NF2 patient with growing vestibular  schwannomas, the rapalog sirolimus induced tumor growth arrest. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results constitute definitive evidence that  justifies proceeding with clinical trials using mTORC1-targeted agents in  selected patients with NF2 and in patients with NF2-related sporadic tumors.

In dendritic spines, Ras plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity but its  regulation mechanism is not fully understood. Here, using a fluorescence  resonance energy transfer/fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy-based Ras  imaging technique in combination with 2-photon glutamate uncaging, we show that  neurofibromin, in which loss-of-function mutations cause Neurofibromatosis Type  1 (NF1), contributes to the majority (∼90%) of Ras inactivation in dendritic  spines of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus. Loss of  neurofibromin causes sustained Ras activation in spines, which leads to  impairment of spine structural plasticity and loss of spines in an  activity-dependent manner. Therefore, deregulation of postsynaptic Ras signaling  may explain, at least in part, learning disabilities associated with NF1.

Bone fragility due to osteopenia, osteoporosis or debilitating focal skeletal  dysplasias is a frequent observation in the Mendelian disease Neurofibromatosis  type 1 (NF1). To determine the mechanisms underlying bone fragility in NF1 we  analyzed two conditional mouse models, Nf1Prx1 (limb knock-out) and Nf1Col1  (osteoblast specific knock-out), as well as cortical bone samples from  individuals with NF1. We examined mouse bone tissue with micro-computed  tomography, qualitative and quantitative histology, mechanical tensile analysis,  small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX),  and scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM). In cortical bone of Nf1Prx1 mice we  detected ectopic blood vessels that were associated with diaphyseal  mineralization defects. Defective mineral binding in the proximity of blood  vessels was most likely due to impaired bone collagen formation, as these areas  were completely devoid of acidic matrix proteins and contained thin collagen  fibers. Additionally, we found significantly reduced mechanical strength of the  bone material, which was partially caused by increased osteocyte volume.  Consistent with these observations, bone samples from individuals with NF1 and  tibial dysplasia showed increased osteocyte lacuna volume. Reduced mechanical  properties were associated with diminished matrix stiffness, as determined by  SAM. In line with these observations, bone tissue from individuals with NF1 and  tibial dysplasia showed heterogeneous mineralization and reduced collagen fiber  thickness and packaging. Collectively, the data indicate that bone fragility in  NF1 tibial dysplasia is partly due to an increased osteocyte-related  micro-porosity, hypomineralization, a generalized defect of organic matrix  formation, exacerbated in the regions of tensional and bending force  integration, and finally persistence of ectopic blood vessels associated with  localized macro-porotic bone lesions.

BACKGROUNDS: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are an aggressive  and often lethal sarcoma that frequently develops in patients with  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). We developed new preclinical MPNST models and  tested the efficacy of oncolytic herpes simplex viruses (oHSVs), a promising  cancer therapeutic that selectively replicates in and kills cancer cells. METHODS: Mouse NF1(-) MPNST cell lines and human NF1(-) MPNST stemlike cells  (MSLCs) were implanted into the sciatic nerves of immunocompetent and athymic  mice, respectively. Tumor growth was followed by external measurement and  sciatic nerve deficit using a hind-limb scoring system. Oncolytic HSV G47Δ as  well as ""armed"" G47Δ expressing platelet factor 4 (PF4) or interleukin (IL)-12  were injected intratumorally into established sciatic nerve tumors. RESULTS: Mouse MPNST cell lines formed tumors with varying growth kinetics. A  single intratumoral injection of G47Δ in sciatic nerve tumors derived from human  S462 MSLCs in athymic mice or mouse M2 (37-3-18-4) cells in immunocompetent mice  significantly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival. Local IL-12  expression significantly improved the efficacy of G47Δ in syngeneic mice, while  PF4 expression prolonged survival. Injection of G47Δ directly into the sciatic  nerve of athymic mice resulted in only mild symptoms that did not differ from  phosphate buffered saline control. CONCLUSIONS: Two new orthotopic MPNST models are described, including in  syngeneic mice, expanding the options for preclinical testing. Oncolytic HSV  G47Δ exhibited robust efficacy in both immunodeficient and immunocompetent MPNST  models while maintaining safety. Interleukin-12 expression improved efficacy.  These studies support the clinical translation of G47Δ for patients with MPNST.  © The Author(s) 2014. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the  Society for Neuro-Oncology.

Comment in     Neuro Oncol. 2014 May;16(5):617-8. doi: 10.1093/neuonc/nou050.  BACKGROUND: RAS is dysregulated in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) related  plexiform neurofibromas (PNs). The activity of tipifarnib, which blocks RAS  signaling by inhibiting its farnesylation, was tested in children and young  adults with NF1 and progressive PNs. METHODS: Patients aged 3-25 years with NF1-related PNs and imaging evidence of  tumor progression were randomized in a double-blinded fashion to receive  tipifarnib (200 mg/m(2) orally every 12 h) or placebo (phase A) and crossed over  to the opposite treatment arm at the time of tumor progression (phase B). PN  volumes were measured with MRI, and progression was defined as ≥20% volume  increase. Time to progression (TTP) in phase A was the primary endpoint, and the  trial was powered to detect whether tipifarnib doubled TTP compared with  placebo. Toxicity, response, and quality of life were also monitored. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were enrolled. Tipifarnib and placebo were well  tolerated. On phase A, the median TTP was 10.6 months on the placebo arm and  19.2 months on the tipifarnib arm (P = .12; 1-sided). Quality of life improved  significantly compared with baseline on the tipifarnib arm but not on the  placebo arm. Volumetric tumor measurement detected tumor progression earlier  than conventional 2-dimensional (WHO) and 1-dimensional (RECIST) methods. CONCLUSIONS: Tipifarnib was well tolerated but did not significantly prolong TTP  of PNs compared with placebo. The randomized, flexible crossover design and  volumetric PN assessment provided a feasible and efficient means of assessing  the efficacy of tipifarnib. The placebo arm serves as an historical control  group for phase 2 single-arm trials directed at progressive PNs.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the expression levels of the  tumor suppressor WOX1 in nervous system tumors and its co-expression with p53  and neurofibromatosis type 2/merlin (NF2) tumor suppressor gene products. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry, western blotting and in situ hybridization were  used for WOX1 protein and WWOX mRNA expression. Immunofluorescence and electron  microscopical immunohistochemistry were performed for colocalization of gene  products. RESULTS: WOX1 expression is low in normal cortical neurons, mainly on the axon  fibers, whereas there is moderate to high immunoreactivity in the cytosol and  nuclei of certain tumor cells. In the microcystic (WHO grade I) and malignant  (WHO grade III) meningiomas, WOX1 expression is intense, but various in  transitional (WHO grade I) and atypical (WHO grade II) subtypes. WOX1 levels are  moderate to high in the menigiotheliomatous area, but relatively low in the  fibroblastic area. WOX1 and NF2/merlin, but not p53, colocalized in certain  tumor cells, primarily at the borders of nuclei. Schwannoma and astrocytoma  specimens stained moderately to strongly positive for the WOX1 protein.  Interestingly, the expression of WOX1, NF2/merlin and mutant p53 is intense in  high grade glioblastoma, but WOX1 expression is low in metastatic carcinoma or  adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of WOX1 on different types of nervous system tumors,  including primary and metastatic tumors, is differential.

Siva K(1), Covello G, Denti MA.  Author information: (1)1 Center for Integrative Biology (CIBIO), University of Trento , Trento,  Italy .  Alternative splicing is an important regulator of the transcriptome. However,  mutations may cause alteration of splicing patterns, which in turn leads to  disease. During the past 10 years, exon skipping has been looked upon as a  powerful tool for correction of missplicing in disease and progress has been  made towards clinical trials. In this review, we discuss the use of antisense  oligonucleotides to correct splicing defects through exon skipping, with a  special focus on diseases affecting the nervous system, and the latest stage  achieved in its progress.

Mutations in the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor gene are common  in cancer and can cause resistance to therapy. Using transcriptome analysis we  identified MAF as an NF1- regulated transcription factor and verified MAF  regulation through RAS/MAPK/AP-1 signaling in malignant peripheral nerve sheath  tumor (MPNST) cell lines. MAF was also downregulated in human MPNST. Acute  re-expression of MAF promoted expression of glial differentiation markers in  MPNST cells in vitro, decreased self-renewal of embryonic precursors and  transiently affected tumor cell phenotypes in vitro by increasing MPNST cell  death and reducing metabolic activity and anchorage-independent growth.  Paradoxically, chronic MAF overexpression enhanced MPNST cell tumor growth in  vivo, correlating with elevated pS6 in vitro and in vivo. RAD001 blocked  MAF-mediated tumor growth, and MAF regulated the mTOR pathway through DEPTOR.  MAPK inhibition with NF1 loss of function is predicted to show limited efficacy  due to reactivation of mTOR signaling via MAF.

BACKGROUND: Inactivation of the NF2 gene predisposes to neurofibromatosis type  II and the development of schwannomas. In vitro studies have shown that loss of  NF2 leads to the induction of mitogenic signaling mediated by receptor tyrosine  kinases (RTKs), MAP kinase, AKT, or Hippo pathways. The goal of our study was to  evaluate the expression and activity of these signaling pathways in human  schwannomas in order to identify new potential therapeutic targets. METHODS: Large sets of human schwannomas, totaling 68 tumors, were analyzed  using complementary proteomic approaches. RTK arrays identified the most  frequently activated RTKs. The correlation between the expression and activity  of signaling pathways and proliferation of tumor cells using Ki67 marker was  investigated by reverse-phase protein array (RRPA). Finally,  immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the expression pattern of signaling  effectors in the tumors. RESULTS: We showed that Her2, Her3, PDGFRß, Axl, and Tie2 are frequently  activated in the tumors. Furthermore, RRPA demonstrated that Ki67 levels are  linked to YAP, p-Her3, and PDGFRß expression levels. In addition, Her2, Her3,  and PDGFRß are transcriptional targets of Yes-associated protein (YAP) in  schwannoma cells in culture. Finally, we observed that the expression of these  signaling effectors is very variable between tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor cell proliferation in human schwannomas is linked to a  signaling network controlled by the Hippo effector YAP. Her2, Her3, PDGFRß, Axl,  and Tie2, as well as YAP, represent potentially valuable therapeutic targets.  However, the variability of their expression between tumors may result in strong  differences in the response to targeted therapy.  © The Author(s) 2014.

Ribeiro MJ(1), d'Almeida OC, Ramos F, Saraiva J, Silva ED, Castelo-Branco M.  Author information: (1)Visual Neuroscience Laboratory, Institute for Biomedical Imaging and Life  Sciences (IBILI), Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Azinhaga de Santa  Comba, Coimbra 3000-548, Portugal. mjribeiro@fmed.uc.pt.  BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) affects several areas of cognitive  function including visual processing and attention. We investigated the neural  mechanisms underlying the visual deficits of children and adolescents with NF1  by studying visual evoked potentials (VEPs) and brain oscillations during visual  stimulation and rest periods. METHODS: Electroencephalogram/event-related potential (EEG/ERP) responses were  measured during visual processing (NF1 n = 17; controls n = 19) and idle periods  with eyes closed and eyes open (NF1 n = 12; controls n = 14). Visual stimulation  was chosen to bias activation of the three detection mechanisms: achromatic,  red-green and blue-yellow. RESULTS: We found significant differences between the groups for late chromatic  VEPs and a specific enhancement in the amplitude of the parieto-occipital alpha  amplitude both during visual stimulation and idle periods. Alpha modulation and  the negative influence of alpha oscillations in visual performance were found in  both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest abnormal later stages of visual processing and  enhanced amplitude of alpha oscillations supporting the existence of deficits in  basic sensory processing in NF1. Given the link between alpha oscillations,  visual perception and attention, these results indicate a neural mechanism that  might underlie the visual sensitivity deficits and increased lapses of attention  observed in individuals with NF1.

Perosio PM(1), Brooks JJ.  Author information: (1)Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hospital of the University  of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 19104.  Identification of growth factors and receptors in mesenchymal tumors may be  crucial to understanding of growth regulation in sarcomas. During an  immunohistochemical study of the expression of growth factors and receptors in  human soft tissue tumors (STT), only 1 antisera capable of working in  paraffin-embedded tissue was noted. A detailed study of 141 STT was undertaken  to determine the frequency of expression of nerve growth factor receptor  (NGF-R), its specificity and sensitivity for neural tumors, and the effect of  fixation on detection. In normal mesenchymal tissue, only nerve sheath and  perivascular staining was seen. No immunoreactivity was seen in many tumors  including rhabdomyosarcoma, angiosarcoma, liposarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and  alveolar soft part sarcoma. Less than 15% of tumors of smooth muscle, fibrous,  or fibrohistiocytic origin showed immunoreactivity, usually focal. In contrast,  a high frequency of immunoreactivity was noted in tumors of neural origin (74%).  This included granular cell tumors (100%), Schwannoma/neurofibroma (91%),  malignant Schwannoma (78%), neuroblastoma/neuroepithelioma (60%), and  paraganglioma (57%). A high rate of reactivity was also seen in synovial  sarcomas (80%), undifferentiated sarcomas (60%), and hemangiopericytomas (43%),  suggesting a potential relationship to the neural phenotype. Among the neural  tumors, Bouin's fixation was superior to formalin, suggesting that  immunoreactivity for NGF-R is affected by fixation. This antibody may be a  useful adjunct marker diagnostically.  PMCID: PMC1880630 PMID: 2456020 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",True,Parse error - defaulted to include

The proper control of tissue growth is essential during normal development and  an important problem in human disease. Merlin, the product of the  Neurofibromatosis 2 tumor suppressor gene, has been extensively studied to  understand its functions in growth control. Here we describe experiments in  which we used Drosophila as an in vivo system to test the functions of the  normal human NF2 gene products and patient-derived mutant alleles. Although the  predominant NF2 gene isoform, isoform 1, could functionally replace the  Drosophila Merlin gene, a second isoform with a distinct C-terminal tail could  not. Immunofluorescence studies show that the two isoforms have distinct  subcellular localizations when expressed in the polarized imaginal epithelium,  and function in genetic rescue assays correlates with apical localization of the  NF2 protein. Interestingly, we found that a patient-derived missense allele,  NF2L64P, appears to be temperature sensitive. These studies highlight the  utility of Drosophila for in vivo functional analysis of highly conserved human  disease genes.

Ferner RE(1), Shaw A, Evans DG, McAleer D, Halliday D, Parry A, Raymond FL,  Durie-Gair J, Hanemann CO, Hornigold R, Axon P, Golding JF.  Author information: (1)National Neurofibromatosis 2 Service, England, UK, rosalie.ferner@kcl.ac.uk.  Advances in molecular biology have resulted in novel therapy for  neurofibromatosis 2-related (NF2) tumours, highlighting the need for robust  outcome measures. The disease-focused NF2 impact on quality of life (NFTI-QOL)  patient questionnaire was assessed as an outcome measure for treatment in a  multi-centre study. NFTI-QOL was related to clinician-rated severity (ClinSev)  and genetic severity (GenSev) over repeated visits. Data were evaluated for 288  NF2 patients (n = 464 visits) attending the English national NF2 clinics from  2010 to 2012. The male-to-female ratio was equal and the mean age was 42.2 (SD  17.8) years. The analysis included NFTI-QOL eight-item score, ClinSev graded as  mild, moderate, or severe, and GenSev as a rank order of the number of NF2  mutations (graded as mild, moderate, severe). The mean (SD) 8.7 (5.4) score for  NFTI-QOL for either a first visit or all visits 9.2 (5.4) was similar to the  published norm of 9.4 (5.5), with no significant relationships with age or  gender. NFTI-QOL internal reliability was good, with a Cronbach's alpha score of  0.85 and test re-test reliability r = 0.84. NFTI related to ClinSev (r = 0.41, p  < 0.001; r = 0.46 for all visits), but weakly to GenSev (r = 0.16, p < 0.05; r =  0.15 for all visits). ClinSev related to GenSev (r = 0.41, p < 0.001; r = 0.42  for all visits). NFTI-QOL showed a good reliability and ability to detect  significant longitudinal changes in the QOL of individuals. The moderate  relationships of NFTI-QOL with clinician- and genetic-rated severity suggest  that NFTI-QOL taps into NF2 patient experiences that are not encompassed by  ClinSev rating or genotype.

Author information: (1)Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 syndrome (NF1) is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene.  Availability of new sequencing technology prompted us to search for an  alternative method for NF1 mutation analysis. Genomic DNA was isolated from  saliva avoiding invasive sampling. The NF1 exons with an additional 50bp of  flanking intronic sequences were captured and enriched using the SeqCap EZ  Choice Library protocol. The captured DNA was sequenced with the Roche/454 GS  Junior system. The mean coverages of the targeted regions were 41x and 74x in 2  separate sets of samples. An NF1 mutation was discovered in 10 out of 16  separate patient samples. Our study provides proof of principle that the  sequence capture methodology combined with high-throughput sequencing is  applicable to NF1 mutation analysis. Deep intronic mutations may however remain  undetectable, and change at the DNA level may not predict the outcome at the  mRNA or protein levels.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are soft tissue sarcomas that  occur spontaneously, or from benign plexiform neurofibromas, in the context of  the genetic disorder Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1). The current standard  treatment includes surgical resection, high-dose chemotherapy, and/or radiation.  To date, most targeted therapies have failed to demonstrate effectiveness  against plexiform neurofibromas and MPNSTs. Recently, several studies suggested  that the mTOR and MAPK pathways are involved in the formation and progression of  MPNSTs. Everolimus (RAD001) inhibits the mTOR and is currently FDA approved for  several types of solid tumors. PD-0325901 (PD-901) inhibits MEK, a component of  the MAPK pathway, and is currently in clinical trials. Here, we show in vitro  than MPNST cell lines are more sensitive to inhibition of cellular growth by  Everolimus and PD-901 than immortalized human Schwann cells. In combination,  these drugs synergistically inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis. In two  genetically engineered mouse models of MPNST formation, modeling both sporadic  and NF1-associated MPNSTs, Everolimus, or PD-901 treatment alone each  transiently reduced tumor burden and size, and extended lifespan. However,  prolonged treatment of each single agent resulted in the development of  resistance and reactivation of target pathways. Combination therapy using  Everolimus and PD-901 had synergistic effects on reducing tumor burden and size,  and increased lifespan. Combination therapy allowed persistent and prolonged  reduction in signaling through both pathways. These data suggest that  co-targeting mTOR and MEK may be effective in patients with sporadic or  NF1-associated MPNSTs.

Yet, the role of this pathway in gliomagenesis remains  controversial because of the lack of relevant animal models. Using the  cytokeratin 5 promoter, we ectopically expressed a constitutively active  zebrafish Smoothened (Smoa1) in neural progenitor cells and analyzed tumorigenic  capacity of activated Shh signaling in both transient and stable transgenic  fish. Transient transgenic fish overexpressing Smoa1 developed retinal and brain  tumors, suggesting smoa1 is oncogenic in the zebrafish central nervous system  (CNS). We further established stable transgenic lines that simultaneously  developed optic pathway glioma (OPG) and various retinal tumors. In one of these  lines, up to 80% of F1 and F2 fish developed tumors within 1 year of age.  Microarray analysis of tumor samples showed upregulated expression of genes  involved in the cell cycle, cancer signaling and Shh downstream targets ptc1,  gli1 and gli2a. Tumors also exhibited specific gene signatures characteristic of  radial glia and progenitor cells as transcriptions of radial glia genes  cyp19a1b, s100β, blbp, gfap and the stem/progenitor genes nestin and sox2 were  significantly upregulated. Overexpression of GFAP, S100β, BLBP and Sox2 was  confirmed by immunofluorescence. We also detected overexpression of Mdm2  throughout the optic pathway in fish with OPG, therefore implicating the  Mdm2-Tp53 pathway in glioma pathogenesis. In conclusion, we demonstrate that  activated Shh signaling initiates tumorigenesis in the zebrafish CNS and provide  the first OPG model not associated with neurofibromatosis 1.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular malformations have a higher incidence in patients  with NF1 microdeletion syndrome compared to NF1 patients with intragenic  mutation, presumably owing to haploinsufficiency of one or more genes included  in the deletion interval and involved in heart development. In order to identify  which genes could be responsible for cardiovascular malformations in the deleted  patients, we carried out expression studies in mouse embryos and functional  studies in zebrafish. METHODS AND RESULTS: The expression analysis of three candidate genes included  in the NF1 deletion interval, ADAP2, SUZ12 and UTP6, performed by in situ  hybridisation, showed the expression of ADAP2 murine ortholog in heart during  fundamental phases of cardiac morphogenesis. In order to investigate the role of  ADAP2 in cardiac development, we performed loss-of-function experiments of  zebrafish ADAP2 ortholog, adap2, by injecting two different morpholino oligos  (adap2-MO and UTR-adap2-MO). adap2-MOs-injected embryos (morphants) displayed in  vivo circulatory and heart shape defects. The molecular characterisation of  morphants with cardiac specific markers showed that the injection of adap2-MOs  causes defects in heart jogging and looping. Additionally, morphological and  molecular analysis of adap2 morphants demonstrated that the loss of adap2  function leads to defective valvulogenesis, suggesting a correlation between  ADAP2 haploinsufficiency and the occurrence of valve defects in NF1-microdeleted  patients. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings indicate that ADAP2 has a role in heart  development, and might be a reliable candidate gene for the occurrence of  cardiovascular malformations in patients with NF1 microdeletion and, more  generally, for the occurrence of a subset of congenital heart defects.

Author information: (1)The Centre for Children's Bone Health, Sydney Children's Hospital Network,  Sydney, Australia; Discipline of Paediatrics and Child Health, Faculty of  Medicine, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.  Spinal pseudarthrosis is a well described complication of spine fusion surgery  in NF1 patients. Reduced bone formation and excessive resorption have been  described in NF1 and anti-resorptive agents may be advantageous in these  individuals. In this study, 16 wild type and 16 Nf1(+/-) mice were subjected to  posterolateral fusion using collagen sponges containing 5 µg rhBMP-2 introduced  bilaterally. Mice were dosed twice weekly with 0.02 mg/kg zoledronic acid (ZA)  or sterile saline. The fusion mass was assessed for bone volume (BV) and bone  mineral density (BMD) by microCT. Co-treatment using rhBMP-2 and ZA produced a  significant increase (p < 0.01) in BV of the fusion mass compared to rhBMP-2  alone in both wild type mice (+229%) and Nf1(+/-) mice (+174%). Co-treatment  also produced a significantly higher total BMD of the fusion mass compared to  rhBMP-2 alone in both groups (p < 0.01). Despite these gains with  anti-resorptive treatment, Nf1(+/-) deficient mice still generated less bone  than wild type controls. TRAP staining on histological sections indicated an  increased osteoclast surface/bone surface (Oc.S/BS) in Nf1(+/-) mice relative to  wild type mice, and this was reduced with ZA treatment.  © 2014 Orthopaedic Research Society.

The growth  inhibitory function of Merlin is induced by intercellular adhesion and  inactivated by joint integrin/receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. Merlin  contributes to the formation of cell junctions in polarized tissues, activates  anti-mitogenic signaling at tight-junctions, and inhibits oncogenic gene  expression. Thus, inactivation of Merlin causes uncontrolled mitogenic signaling  and tumorigenesis. Merlin's predominant tumor suppressive functions are  attributable to its control of oncogenic gene expression through regulation of  Hippo signaling. Notably, Merlin translocates to the nucleus where it directly  inhibits the CRL4(DCAF1) E3 ubiquitin ligase, thereby suppressing inhibition of  the Lats kinases. A dichotomy in NF2 function has emerged whereby Merlin acts at  the cell cortex to organize cell junctions and propagate anti-mitogenic  signaling, whereas it inhibits oncogenic gene expression through the inhibition  of CRL4(DCAF1) and activation of Hippo signaling. The biochemical events  underlying Merlin's normal function and tumor suppressive activity will be  discussed in this Review, with emphasis on recent discoveries that have greatly  influenced our understanding of Merlin biology.

Widemann BC(1), Babovic-Vuksanovic D, Dombi E, Wolters PL, Goldman S, Martin S,  Goodwin A, Goodspeed W, Kieran MW, Cohen B, Blaney SM, King A, Solomon J,  Patronas N, Balis FM, Fox E, Steinberg SM, Packer RJ.  Author information: (1)Pediatric Oncology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.  BACKGROUND: Pirfenidone, an oral anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic agent with  activity in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, may mediate anti-tumor activity in  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and plexiform neurofibromas (PN) by inhibition of  fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis. The primary objective of this  open label, single arm phase II trial was to evaluate the activity of  pirfenidone in children and young adults with inoperable PN. PROCEDURE: Patients (3-21 years) with NF1-related progressive PN received  pirfenidone at the previously determined optimal dose (500 mg/m(2) orally, q8h)  on a continuous dosing schedule (one cycle = 28 days). Volumetric MRI analysis  was used to assess response. Progression was defined as ≥ 20% PN volume increase  compared to baseline. Pirfenidone would be considered active if it doubled the  median time to progression (TTP) compared to the TTP on the placebo arm of a  phase II trial with the farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib, which used  near identical eligibility criteria. Toxicities, objective response rate, and  quality of life (QOL) also were evaluated. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were enrolled and tolerated pirfenidone well with  intermittent nausea and vomiting as the most frequent toxicities. A dose  reduction was required in only three patients. The median TTP for pirfenidone  was 13.2 months compared to 10.6 months for the placebo control group from the  tipifarnib trial (two-tailed P = 0.92; one-tailed P = 0.46). No objective  responses were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Pirfenidone was well tolerated, but did not demonstrate activity as  defined in this trial and does not warrant further evaluation in children with  NF1 and progressive PN.  © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

OBJECTIVE: Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is overexpressed in serous ovarian  cancer. Loss of merlin, a product of the neurofibromatosis 2 tumor suppressor  gene, is being evaluated as a biomarker for FAK inhibitor sensitivity in  mesothelioma. Connections between merlin and FAK in ovarian cancer remain  undefined. METHODS: Nine human and two murine ovarian cancer cell lines were analyzed for  growth in the presence of a small molecule FAK inhibitor (PF-271, also termed  VS-6062) from 0.1 to 1 μM for 72 h. Merlin was evaluated by immunoblotting and  immunostaining of a human ovarian tumor tissue array. Growth of cells was  analyzed in an orthotopic tumor model and evaluated in vitro after stable  shRNA-mediated merlin knockdown. RESULTS: Greater than 50% inhibition of OVCAR8, HEY, and ID8-IP ovarian  carcinoma cell growth occurred with 0.1 μM PF-271 in anchorage-independent  (p<0.001) but not in adherent culture conditions. PF-271-mediated reduction in  FAK Y397 phosphorylation occurred independently of growth inhibition. Suspended  growth of OVCAR3, OVCAR10, IGROV1, IGROV1-IP, SKOV3, SKOV3-IP, A2780, and  5009-MOVCAR was not affected by 0.1 μM PF-271. Merlin expression did not  correlate with serous ovarian tumor grade or stage. PF-271 (30 mg/kg, BID) did  not inhibit 5009-MOVCAR tumor growth and merlin knockdown in SKOV3-IP and  OVCAR10 cells did not alter suspended cell growth upon PF-271 addition. CONCLUSIONS: Differential responsiveness to FAK inhibitor treatment was  observed. Intrinsic low merlin protein level correlated with PF-271-mediated  anchorage-independent growth inhibition, but reduction in merlin expression did  not induce sensitivity to FAK inhibition. Merlin levels may be useful for  patient stratification in FAK inhibitor trials.  Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Somatic mosaicism represents the coexistence of two or more cell populations  with different genotypes in one person, and it is involved in >30 monogenic  disorders. Somatic mosaicism characterizes approximately 25% to 33% of patients  with de novo neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). The identification of mosaicism is  crucial to patients and their families because the clinical course of the  disease and its transmission risk is influenced by the degree and distribution  of mutated cells. Moreover, in NF2, the capability of discriminating patients  with mosaicism is especially important to make differential diagnosis with  schwannomatosis. However, the identification of mosaic variants is considerably  difficult, and the development of specific molecular techniques to detect low  levels of unknown molecular alterations is required. Co-amplification at lower  denaturation temperature (COLD)-PCR has been described as a powerful method to  selectively amplify minority alleles from mixtures of wild-type and  mutation-containing sequences. Here, we applied COLD-PCR to molecular analysis  of patients with NF2 mosaicism. With the use of COLD-PCR, followed by direct  sequencing, we were able to detect NF2 mutations in blood DNA of three patients  with NF2 mosaicism. Our study has shown the capability of COLD-PCR in enriching  low-represented mutated allele in blood DNA sample, making it usable for  molecular diagnosis of patients with mosaicism.

Garcia C(1), Gutmann DH(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis,  Missouri, United States of America.  OBJECTIVE: Individuals with the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) cancer  predisposition syndrome develop spinal cord glial tumors (ependymomas) that  likely originate from neural progenitor cells. Whereas many spinal ependymomas  exhibit indolent behavior, the only treatment option for clinically symptomatic  tumors is surgery. In this regard, medical therapies are unfortunately lacking  due to an incomplete understanding of the critical growth control pathways that  govern the function of spinal cord (SC) neural progenitor cells (NPCs). METHODS: To identify potential therapeutic targets for these tumors, we  leveraged primary mouse Nf2-deficient spinal cord neural progenitor cells. RESULTS: We demonstrate that the Nf2 protein, merlin, negatively regulates  spinal neural progenitor cell survival and glial differentiation in an  ErbB2-dependent manner, and that NF2-associated spinal ependymomas exhibit  increased ErbB2 activation. Moreover, we show that Nf2-deficient SC NPC ErbB2  activation results from Rac1-mediated ErbB2 retention at the plasma membrane. SIGNIFICANCE: Collectively, these findings establish ErbB2 as a potential  rational therapeutic target for NF2-associated spinal ependymoma.

Erratum in     PLoS One. 2015 Aug 27;10(8):e0137153. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0137153.  Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive Schwann  cell-derived sarcomas and are the leading cause of mortality in patients with  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Current treatment modalities have been largely  ineffective, resulting in a high rate of MPNST recurrence and poor five-year  patient survival. This necessitates the exploration of alternative  chemotherapeutic options for MPNST patients. This study sought to assess the  cytotoxic effect of the BH3-mimetic AT101 [(-)-gossypol] on MPNST cells in vitro  and to identify key regulators of AT101-induced MPNST cell death. We found that  AT101 caused caspase-independent, non-apoptotic MPNST cell death, which was  accompanied by autophagy and was mediated through HIF-1α induced expression of  the atypical BH3-only protein BNIP3. These effects were mediated by  intracellular iron chelation, a previously unreported mechanism of AT101  cytotoxicity.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are genetically diverse,  aggressive sarcomas that occur sporadically or in association with  neurofibromatosis type 1 syndrome. Reduced TP53 gene expression and  amplification/overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene  occur in MPNST formation. We focused on determining the cooperativity between  reduced TP53 expression and EGFR overexpression for Schwann cell transformation  in vitro (immortalized human Schwann cells) and MPNST formation in vivo  (transgenic mice). Human gene copy number alteration data, microarray expression  data, and TMA analysis indicate that TP53 haploinsufficiency and increased EGFR  expression co-occur in human MPNST samples. Concurrent modulation of EGFR and  TP53 expression in HSC1λ cells significantly increased proliferation and  anchorage-independent growth in vitro. Transgenic mice heterozygous for a  Trp53-null allele and overexpressing EGFR in Schwann cells had a significant  increase in neurofibroma and grade 3 PNST (MPNST) formation compared with single  transgenic controls. Histological analysis of tumors identified a significant  increase in pAkt expression in grade 3 PNSTs compared with neurofibromas. Array  comparative genome hybridization analysis of grade 3 PNSTs identified recurrent  focal regions of chromosomal gains with significant enrichment in genes involved  in extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 signaling. Collectively, altered p53  expression cooperates with overexpression of EGFR in Schwann cells to enhance in  vitro oncogenic properties and tumorigenesis and progression in vivo.

In a diverse panel of cancer cell lines, we  found that the cells most sensitive to focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibition  lack expression of the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene  product, Merlin. Merlin expression is often lost in malignant pleural  mesothelioma (MPM), an asbestos-induced aggressive cancer with limited treatment  options. Our data demonstrate that low Merlin expression predicts for increased  sensitivity of MPM cells to a FAK inhibitor, VS-4718, in vitro and in tumor  xenograft models. Disruption of MPM cell-cell or cell-extracellular matrix (ECM)  contacts with blocking antibodies suggests that weak cell-cell adhesions in  Merlin-negative MPM cells underlie their greater dependence on cell-ECM-induced  FAK signaling. This provides one explanation of why Merlin-negative cells are  vulnerable to FAK inhibitor treatment. Furthermore, we validated aldehyde  dehydrogenase as a marker of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in MPM, a cell population  thought to mediate tumor relapse after chemotherapy. Whereas pemetrexed and  cisplatin, standard-of-care agents for MPM, enrich for CSCs, FAK inhibitor  treatment preferentially eliminates these cells. These preclinical results  provide the rationale for a clinical trial in MPM patients using a FAK inhibitor  as a single agent after first-line chemotherapy. With this design, the FAK  inhibitor could potentially induce a more durable clinical response through  reduction of CSCs along with a strong antitumor effect. Furthermore, our data  suggest that patients with Merlin-negative tumors may especially benefit from  FAK inhibitor treatment.  Copyright © 2014, American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Electronic address: zbu@ccny.cuny.edu.  The tumor suppressor protein Merlin inhibits cell proliferation upon  establishing cell-cell contacts. Because Merlin has high level of sequence  similarity to the Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin family of proteins, the structural model  of Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin protein autoinhibition and cycling between  closed/resting and open/active conformational states is often employed to  explain Merlin function. However, recent biochemical studies suggest alternative  molecular models of Merlin function. Here, we have determined the low-resolution  molecular structure and binding activity of Merlin and a Merlin(S518D) mutant  that mimics the inactivating phosphorylation at S518 using small-angle neutron  scattering and binding experiments. Small-angle neutron scattering shows that,  in solution, both Merlin and Merlin(S518D) adopt a closed conformation, but  binding experiments indicate that a significant fraction of either Merlin or  Merlin(S518D) is capable of binding to the target protein NHERF1. Upon binding  to the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate lipid, the wild-type Merlin adopts  a more open conformation than in solution, but Merlin(S518D) remains in a closed  conformation. This study supports a rheostat model of Merlin in NHERF1 binding  and contributes to resolving a controversy about the molecular conformation and  binding activity of Merlin.

Mori T(1), Gotoh S, Shirakawa M, Hakoshima T.  Author information: (1)Structural Biology Laboratory, Nara Institute of Science and Technology,  8916-5, Takayama, Ikoma, Nara, 630-0192, Japan.  Merlin, a tumor suppressor encoded by the neurofibromatosis type 2 gene, has  been shown to suppress tumorigenesis by inhibiting the Cullin 4-RING E3  ubiquitin ligase CRL4(DCAF) (1) in the nucleus. This inhibition is mediated by  direct binding of merlin to DDB1-and-Cullin 4-associated Factor 1 (DCAF1), yet  the binding mode of merlin to DCAF1 is not well defined. Here, we report  structural and biophysical studies of the merlin binding to DCAF1 and its  interference with CD44 binding. The crystal structure of the merlin FERM domain  bound to the DCAF1 C-terminal acidic tail reveals that the hydrophobic IILXLN  motif located at the C-terminal end of DCAF1 binds subdomain C of the FERM  domain by forming a β-strand. The binding site and mode resemble that of merlin  binding to the CD44 cytoplasmic tail. Competition binding assay showed that CD44  and DCAF1 compete for binding to the merlin FERM domain in solution. The CD44  cytoplasmic tail is known to be cleaved for nuclear translocation by regulated  intra-membrane proteolysis (RIP). Our structure implies that, in the nucleus,  the CD44 cytoplasmic tail cleaved by RIP could release DCAF1 from merlin by  competing for binding to the merlin FERM domain, which results in the inhibition  of merlin-mediated suppression of tumorigenesis.  © 2014 The Authors Genes to Cells © 2014 by the Molecular Biology Society of  Japan and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

Author information: (1)Department of Human Genetics, Collaborative Research, Inc., Bedford, MA  01730.  The genetic locus for neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) has recently been mapped to the  pericentromeric region of chromosome 17. We have genotyped eight previously  identified RFLP probes on 50 NF1 families to determine the placement of the NF1  locus relative to the RFLP loci. Thirty-eight recombination events in the  pericentromeric region were identified, eight involving crossovers between NF1  and loci on either chromosomal arm. Multipoint linkage analysis resulted in the  unique placement of six loci at odds greater than 100:1 in the order of  pter-A10-41-EW301-NF1-EW207-CRI-L581-CRI-L946 -qter. Owing to insufficient  crossovers, three loci--D17Z1, EW206, and EW203--could not be uniquely  localized. In this region female recombination rates were significantly higher  than those of males. These data were part of a joint study aimed at the  localization of both NF1 and tightly linked pericentromeric markers for  chromosome 17.

The von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1) gene has been localized to the  pericentromeric region of chromosome 17. We have screened six multigenerational  families with multiple, tightly linked markers to aid in mapping this region of  the chromosome. More than 150 members in six families were typed with probes  including HHH202, D17Z1, EW203, EW206, EW207, EW301, pA10-41, D17S37, and  D17S36. Two-point lod scores for NF1 versus all markers were calculated. HHH202  demonstrated the tightest linkage to NF1 with theta = .0, z = 3.86 (95%  confidence limits [CL] of theta = .0-.13), suggesting that HHH202 be considered  as a potential candidate marker for use in carrier detection and prenatal  diagnosis. Pairwise marker-to-marker lod scores were used in examining the most  likely order of subsets of the markers. Of those tested, the most likely order  was (pter)-pA10-41-EW301-D17Z1-HHH202-NF1-E W206-EW207-EW203-(qter). In  addition, we have ascertained an NF1 x NF1 half-cousin mating in which there are  four affected family members who are potentially homozygous for the disease  gene. Two of these four individuals have been sampled and typed for marker loci.  When their D17Z1 genotypes are considered, the probability that both these  individuals are heterozygous is 85%.

Author information: (1)Neurogenetics Laboratory, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston 02114.  The defective gene causing von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1), one of  the most common inherited disorders affecting the human nervous system, was  recently mapped to chromosome 17. We have used additional DNA markers to further  narrow and bracket the NF1 defect. A multipoint linkage analysis suggests that  the NF1 gene is flanked by D17Z1 on the centromeric side and by EW 207 on the  telomeric side of the long arm of chromosome 17. The identification of closely  linked flanking markers should allow us to develop a reliable prenatal and  presymptomatic diagnostic test for this serious neurological disorder and  provides the basis for applying chromosome-specific cloning techniques for the  isolation and characterization of the mutant gene.

Author information: (1)Department of Human Genetics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.  The von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1) gene has been mapped to the  pericentromeric region of chromosome 17. We conducted linkage analyses of NF1 by  using 10 polymorphic DNA markers from this chromosomal region. We ascertained 20  American Caucasian NF1 families (163 individuals, 98 NF1 affected) in Michigan  and Ohio and also studied a large family ascertained primarily in North  Carolina. The following markers were used in this study: HHH202, TH17.19, D17Z1,  ERBA1, EW203, EW206, EW207, EW301, CRI-L581, and CRI-L946. NF1 did not recombine  with either TH17.19 or HHH202 in any of the informative meioses surveyed  (maximum lod scores of 17.04 and 7.21, respectively, at a recombination fraction  of .00), indicating that these markers map very close to the NF1 gene. We also  report evidence of three instances of recombination between NF1 and the  centromeric marker D17Z1 (maximum lod score of 13.43 at a recombination fraction  of .04), as well as two crossovers between pairs of marker loci. We find no  evidence of locus heterogeneity, and our results support the localization of the  NF1 gene to proximal chromosome 17q.

Upadhyaya M(1), Sarfarazi M, Huson SM, Broadhead W, Fryer A, Harper PS.  Author information: (1)Institute of Medical Genetics, University of Wales College of Medicine,  Cardiff, United Kingdom.  A genetic linkage study with 16 polymorphic DNA markers spanning the region  17p11-17q24 in 22 NF1 families is presented. Close linkage between NF1 and eight  pericentromeric markers (HHH202, EW206, CRI-L946, EW203, EW301, FG2, p17H8, and  CRI-L581) has been found, probe HHH202 being the closest marker to NF1. Genetic  heterogeneity has been excluded. The study of multiply informative meioses  suggests that the probes HHH202 and RW206 are flanking markers for NF1. The most  likely order on the basis of multiply informative meioses and multipoint mapping  is pter-pA10.41-EW301-cen-HHH202-NF1-EW206-++ +EW207-qter.

The gene for von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) has recently been  mapped to the pericentromeric region of human chromosome 17. To further localize  the NF1 gene, linkage analysis using chromosome 17 DNA markers was performed on  11 multigeneration families with 175 individuals, 57 of whom were affected. The  markers used were D17Z1 (p17H8), D17S58 (EW301), D17S54 (EW203), D17S57 (EW206),  D17S73 (EW207), CRI-L946, HOX-2, and growth hormone. Tight linkage was found  between NF1 and D17Z1, D17S58, and D17S57 with a recombination fraction of zero.  One recombinant was detected between NF1 and D17S73, showing linkage with a 10%  recombination fraction. No linkage was detected between NF1 and CRI-L946 or  between HOX-2 and growth hormone. Our data are consistent with the proposed gene  order pter D17S58-D17Z1-NF1-D17S57-D17S73 qter.  PMCID: PMC1715469 PMID: 2491782 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",True,Parse error - defaulted to include
PMID:2491783,Physical mapping of the von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis region on chromosome 17.,"Physical mapping of the von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis region on  chromosome 17.  Fountain JW(1), Wallace MR, Brereton AM, O'Connell P, White RL, Rich DC,  Ledbetter DH, Leach RJ, Fournier RE, Menon AG, et al.  Author information: (1)Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor  48109-0650.  The von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1) locus has been linked to  chromosome 17, and recent linkage analyses place the gene on the proximal long  arm. NF1 probably resides in 17q11.2, since two unrelated NF1 patients have been  identified who possess constitutional reciprocal translocations involving  17q11.2 with chromosomes 1 and 22. We have used a somatic-cell hybrid from the  t(17;22) individual, along with other hybrid cell lines, to order probes around  the NF1 locus. An additional probe, 17L1, has been isolated from a NotI linking  library made from flow-sorted chromosome 17 material and has been mapped to a  region immediately proximal to the translocation breakpoint. While neither NF1  translocation breakpoint has yet been identified by pulse-field gel analysis, an  overlap between two probes, EW206 and EW207, has been detected. Furthermore, we  have identified the breakpoint in a non-NF1 translocation, SP-3, on the proximal  side of the NF1 locus. This breakpoint has been helpful in creating a 1,000-kb  pulsed-field map, which includes the closely linked NF1 probes HHH202 and  TH17.19. The combined somatic-cell hybrid and pulsed-field gel analysis we  report here favors the probe order D17Z1-HHH202-TH17.19-CRYB1-17L1-NF1- (EW206,  EW207, EW203, L581, L946)-(ERBB2, ERBA1). The agreement in probe ordering  between linkage analysis and physical mapping is excellent, and the availability  of translocation breakpoints in NF1 should now greatly assist the cloning of  this locus.

Goldgar DE(1), Green P, Parry DM, Mulvihill JJ.  Author information: (1)Department of Medical Informatics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City.  In addition to reporting, in accompanying papers, their individual analyses of  mapping the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene on chromosome 17, members of the  International Consortium for NF1 Linkage contributed their data for our joint  analysis to determine the exact sequence of flanking markers and to obtain  precise estimates and confidence limits of the recombination fractions for the  closest markers, in anticipation of clinical use. With specimens from 142  families and more than 700 affected persons, eight teams used 31 markers in the  pericentric region of chromosome 17 to perform 13,838 genotypings. With the  combined data, we used the computer program CRI-MAP to build the most likely  sequence of loci by sequentially adding single loci to a fixed pair of loci and  separately calculating the likelihood of all permutations of four consecutive  loci. The best order is pter-pA10-41-EW301-centromere  (p17H8)-pHHH202-NF1-EW206-EW207-EW203++ +-CRI-L581-CRI-L946-HOX2-NGFR-qter. The  total genetic distance from pA10-41 to NGFR is 26 cM in males and 56 cM in  females, and the overall difference in sex-specific maps is statistically  significant (P = .006). The upper 99% confidence limits of the recombination  fraction of the closest proximal marker, pHHH202, is 4%, and that for the  closest distal marker, EW206, is 9%. These limits should decrease with the use  of additional probes and the further evaluation of DNA from the six persons  showing multiple recombinations within short genetic distances. Clinical  application is technically feasible with currently available markers, although  its appropriate use for prenatal and presymptomatic diagnosis requires further  discussion and evaluation.

Fain PR(1), Wright E, Willard HF, Stephens K, Barker DF.  Author information: (1)Department of Medical Informatics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City.  Previous genetic analyses of chromosome 17 markers and NF1 (Fain et al. 1987)  were extended in an attempt to order marker loci that map physically to  17cen----17q12. Three additional markers (HHH202, CRI-L581, and CRI-L946) were  included in the analyses. Recombinants within the cluster of seven unordered  marker loci were identified by pairwise analyses for each family and by  examining the within-sibship segregation patterns for different markers. Changes  in the segregation pattern for different loci define genetic breakpoints. Given  that interference is complete in the region, markers with the same segregation  pattern lie on one side of the breakpoint, while markers with different  segregation patterns lie on opposite sides of the breakpoint. If the order of  boundary markers is known, markers on each side of a breakpoint can be oriented  in relation to the centromere. The order  cen-(HHH202/NF1)-(EW207)-(EW203/CRI-L581)- (CRI-L946)-(HOX-2/NGFR)-qter was  inferred by combining information from physical breakpoints in a panel of  mouse/human hybrids and information from genetic breakpoints found in 16 NF1  families.

Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) can be localized by (18)F-FDG PET.  The uptake is particularly high in tumors with an underlying succinate  dehydrogenase (SDH) mutation. SDHx-related PPGLs are characterized by  compromised oxidative phosphorylation and a pseudohypoxic response, which  mediates an increase in aerobic glycolysis, also known as the Warburg effect.  The aim of this study was to explore the hypothesis that increased uptake of  (18)F-FDG in SDHx-related PPGLs is reflective of increased glycolytic activity  and is correlated with expression of different proteins involved in glucose  uptake and metabolism through the glycolytic pathway. METHODS: Twenty-seven PPGLs collected from patients with hereditary mutations in  SDHB (n = 2), SDHD (n = 3), RET (n = 5), neurofibromatosis 1 (n = 1), and  myc-associated factor X (n = 1) and sporadic patients (n = 15) were  investigated. Preoperative (18)F-FDG PET/CT studies were analyzed; mean and  maximum standardized uptake values (SUVs) in manually drawn regions of interest  were calculated. The expression of proteins involved in glucose uptake (glucose  transporters types 1 and 3 [GLUT-1 and -3, respectively]), phosphorylation  (hexokinases 1, 2, and 3 [HK-1, -2, and -3, respectively]), glycolysis  (monocarboxylate transporter type 4 [MCT-4]), and angiogenesis (vascular  endothelial growth factor [VEGF], CD34) were examined in paraffin-embedded tumor  tissues using immunohistochemical staining with peroxidase-catalyzed  polymerization of diaminobenzidine as a read-out. The expression was correlated  with corresponding SUVs. RESULTS: Both maximum and mean SUVs for SDHx-related tumors were significantly  higher than those for sporadic and other hereditary tumors (P < 0.01). The  expression of HK-2 and HK-3 was significantly higher in SDHx-related PPGLs than  in sporadic PPGLs (P = 0.022 and 0.025, respectively). The expression of HK-2  and VEGF was significantly higher in SDHx-related PPGLs than in other hereditary  PPGLs (P = 0.039 and 0.008, respectively). No statistical differences in the  expression were observed for GLUT-1, GLUT-3, and MCT-4. The percentage anti-CD  34 staining and mean vessel perimeter were significantly higher in SDHx-related  PPGLs than in sporadic tumors (P = 0.050 and 0.010, respectively). Mean SUVs  significantly correlated with the expression of HK-2 (P = 0.027), HK-3 (P =  0.013), VEGF (P = 0.049), and MCT-4 (P = 0.020). CONCLUSION: The activation of aerobic glycolysis in SDHx-related PPGLs is  associated with increased (18)F-FDG accumulation due to accelerated glucose  phosphorylation by hexokinases rather than increased expression of glucose  transporters.  © 2014 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.

Author information: (1)Sarah M. and Charles E. Seay Center for Musculoskeletal Research, Texas  Scottish Rite Hospital for Children, Dallas, TX, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by  mutations in NF1. Among the earliest manifestations is tibial pseudoarthrosis  and persistent nonunion after fracture. To further understand the pathogenesis  of pseudoarthrosis and the underlying bone remodeling defect, pseudoarthrosis  tissue and cells cultured from surgically resected pseudoarthrosis tissue from  NF1 individuals were analyzed using whole-exome and whole-transcriptome  sequencing as well as genomewide microarray analysis. Genomewide analysis  identified multiple genetic mechanisms resulting in somatic biallelic NF1  inactivation; no other genes with recurring somatic mutations were identified.  Gene expression profiling identified dysregulated pathways associated with  neurofibromin deficiency, including phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. Unlike aggressive  NF1-associated malignancies, tibial pseudoarthrosis tissue does not harbor a  high frequency of somatic mutations in oncogenes or other tumor-suppressor  genes, such as p53. However, gene expression profiling indicates that  pseudoarthrosis tissue has a tumor-promoting transcriptional pattern, despite  lacking tumorigenic somatic mutations. Significant overexpression of specific  cancer-associated genes in pseudoarthrosis highlights a potential for receptor  tyrosine kinase inhibitors to target neurofibromin-deficient pseudoarthrosis and  promote proper bone remodeling and fracture healing.  © 2014 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

PMID:24958239,SVA retrotransposon insertion-associated deletion represents a novel mutational mechanism underlying large genomic copy number changes with non-recurrent breakpoints.,"SVA retrotransposon insertion-associated deletion represents a novel mutational  mechanism underlying large genomic copy number changes with non-recurrent  breakpoints.  Vogt J, Bengesser K, Claes KB, Wimmer K, Mautner VF, van Minkelen R, Legius E,  Brems H, Upadhyaya M, Högel J, Lazaro C, Rosenbaum T, Bammert S, Messiaen L,  Cooper DN, Kehrer-Sawatzki H.  BACKGROUND: Genomic disorders are caused by copy number changes that may exhibit  recurrent breakpoints processed by nonallelic homologous recombination. However,  region-specific disease-associated copy number changes have also been observed  which exhibit non-recurrent breakpoints. The mechanisms underlying these  non-recurrent copy number changes have not yet been fully elucidated. RESULTS: We analyze large NF1 deletions with non-recurrent breakpoints as a  model to investigate the full spectrum of causative mechanisms, and observe that  they are mediated by various DNA double strand break repair mechanisms, as well  as aberrant replication. Further, two of the 17 NF1 deletions with non-recurrent  breakpoints, identified in unrelated patients, occur in association with the  concomitant insertion of SINE/variable number of tandem repeats/Alu (SVA)  retrotransposons at the deletion breakpoints. The respective breakpoints are  refractory to analysis by standard breakpoint-spanning PCRs and are only  identified by means of optimized PCR protocols designed to amplify across  GC-rich sequences. The SVA elements are integrated within SUZ12P intron 8 in  both patients, and were mediated by target-primed reverse transcription of SVA  mRNA intermediates derived from retrotranspositionally active source elements.  Both SVA insertions occurred during early postzygotic development and are  uniquely associated with large deletions of 1 Mb and 867 kb, respectively, at  the insertion sites. CONCLUSIONS: Since active SVA elements are abundant in the human genome and the  retrotranspositional activity of many SVA source elements is high, SVA  insertion-associated large genomic deletions encompassing many hundreds of  kilobases could constitute a novel and as yet under-appreciated mechanism  underlying large-scale copy number changes in the human genome.

Author information: (1)Institute for Genetic Medicine, University of Southern California, Keck  School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90089, USA. mehrian@usc.edu.  BACKGROUND: Schwannomas are the most common neurofibromatosis type 2  (NF2)-associated tumors with significant phenotypic heterogeneity in patients.  The most severe subtype has an early and rapid progression and the mild type has  a later onset and a less aggressive course. The aim of this study was to  elucidate the underlying molecular differences between these groups. We compared  the gene expression pattern between patients with early to late age of onset. RESULTS: A gene signature of 21 genes was constructed to differentiate between  early-onset and late-onset patients. We confirmed these results by real-time PCR  for SNF1LK2, NGFRAP1L1 (BEX 5), GMNN, and EPHA2. CONCLUSION: Genes identified here may be additional aberrations in  merlin-depleted cells that govern the disease onset. A significant number of  these genes have been suggested as having a role in carcinogenesis and are used  as biomarkers for prognosis in several other cancers. The role of these genes in  NF2 carcinogenesis and their potential as biomarkers or drug target are  worthwhile exploring.

Individuals with neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1) can manifest focal skeletal  dysplasias that remain extremely difficult to treat. NF1 is caused by mutations  in the NF1 gene, which encodes the RAS GTPase-activating protein neurofibromin.  We report here that ablation of Nf1 in bone-forming cells leads to  supraphysiologic accumulation of pyrophosphate (PPi), a strong inhibitor of  hydroxyapatite formation, and that a chronic extracellular signal-regulated  kinase (ERK)-dependent increase in expression of genes promoting PPi synthesis  and extracellular transport, namely Enpp1 and Ank, causes this phenotype. Nf1  ablation also prevents bone morphogenic protein-2-induced osteoprogenitor  differentiation and, consequently, expression of alkaline phosphatase and PPi  breakdown, further contributing to PPi accumulation. The short stature and  impaired bone mineralization and strength in mice lacking Nf1 in  osteochondroprogenitors or osteoblasts can be corrected by asfotase-α enzyme  therapy aimed at reducing PPi concentration. These results establish  neurofibromin as an essential regulator of bone mineralization. They also  suggest that altered PPi homeostasis contributes to the skeletal dysplasias  associated with NF1 and that some of the NF1 skeletal conditions could be  prevented pharmacologically.

PMID:25003081,An integrative analysis of meningioma tumors reveals the determinant genes and pathways of malignant transformation.,"An integrative analysis of meningioma tumors reveals the determinant genes and  pathways of malignant transformation.  Iglesias Gómez JC(1), Mosquera Orgueira A(2).  Author information: (1)Independent Video Editor , Santiago de Compostela , Spain. (2)Independent Researcher , A Coruña , Spain.  Meningiomas are frequent central nervous system neoplasms, which despite their  predominant benignity, show sporadically malignant behavior. Type 2  neurofibromatosis and polymorphisms in several genes have been associated with  meningioma risk and are probably involved in its pathogenesis. Although GWAS  studies have found loci related to meningioma risk, little is known about the  factors determining malignant transformation. Thus, this study is aimed to  identify the genomic and transcriptomic factors influencing evolution from  benignity toward aggressive phenotypes. By applying an integrative  bioinformatics pipeline combining public information on a wealth of biological  layers of complexity (from genetic polymorphisms to protein interactions), this  study identified a module of co-expressed genes highly correlated with tumor  stage and statistically linked to several genomic regions (module Quantitative  Trait Loci, mQTLs). Ontology analysis of the transcription hub genes identified  microtubule-associated cell-cycle processes as key drivers of such network.  mQTLs and single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with meningioma stage were  replicated in an alternative meningioma cohort, and integration of these results  with up-to-date scientific literature and several databases retrieved a list of  genes and pathways with a potentially important role in meningioma malignancy.  As a result, cytoskeleton and cell-cell adhesion pathways, calcium-channels and  glutamate receptors, as well as oxidoreductase and endoplasmic  reticulum-associated degradation pathways were found to be the most important  and redundant findings associated to meningioma progression. This study presents  an integrated view of the pathways involved in meningioma malignant conversion  and paves the way for the development of new research lines that will improve  our understanding of meningioma biology.

Jaakkola S(1), Peltonen J, Riccardi V, Chu ML, Uitto J.  Author information: (1)Department of Dermatology, Jefferson Medical College, Jefferson Institute of  Molecular Medicine, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  19107.  Cutaneous neurofibromas, characteristic lesions of neurofibromatosis 1, are  composed of an abundant extracellular matrix and nerve connective tissue-derived  cell types: Schwann cells, perineurial cells, and fibroblasts. In this study,  the extracellular matrix gene expression by these cells was examined under  culture conditions that allowed them to be metabolically active and readily  identifiable by morphologic and immunocytochemical criteria. Northern  hybridizations demonstrated expression of genes for type I, III, IV, and VI  collagens, as well as for fibronectin, laminin, and elastin. In situ  hybridizations revealed that all three cell types expressed pro alpha 1 (I), pro  alpha 2 (VI), and laminin B1 chain genes. However, fibroblasts did not contain  [35S]cDNA-mRNA hybrids specific for type IV collagen, whereas both Schwann cells  and perineurial cells expressed these genes. Perineurial cells and fibroblasts  readily expressed the fibronectin gene whereas Schwann cells were essentially  devoid of the corresponding mRNA. Perineurial cells also expressed the gene for  laminin A chain. The results indicate that the extracellular matrix gene  expression profiles of Schwann cells, perineurial cells, and fibroblasts are  distinct: all three cell types are capable of expressing some of the genes for  extracellular matrix components, such as type I and VI collagens, whereas  Schwann cells and perineurial cells may have the primary role in synthesizing  basement membrane zone components, type IV collagen and laminin. These  observations potentially relate to the mechanisms of growth and development of  human neurofibromas. The results attest to the applicability of the methodology  utilized here to study other human tumors with mixed cell populations.

PMID:25012216,A neuronal function of the tumor suppressor protein merlin.,"A neuronal function of the tumor suppressor protein merlin.  Schulz A, Zoch A, Morrison H.  Mutagenic loss of the NF2 tumor suppressor gene encoded protein merlin is known  to provoke the hereditary neoplasia syndrome, Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). In  addition to glial cell-derived tumors in the PNS and CNS, disease-related  lesions also affect the skin and the eyes. Furthermore, 60% of NF2 patients  suffer from peripheral nerve damage, clinically referred to as peripheral  neuropathy. Strikingly, NF2-associated neuropathy often occurs in the absence of  nerve damaging tumors, suggesting tumor-independent events. Recent findings  indicate an important role of merlin in neuronal cell types concerning  neuromorphogenesis, axon structure maintenance and communication between axons  and Schwann cells. In this review, we compile clinical and experimental  evidences for the underestimated role of the tumor suppressor merlin in the  neuronal compartment.

It is currently unclear whether Merlin/NF2 suppresses tumorigenesis by  activating upstream components of the Hippo pathway at the plasma membrane or by  inhibiting the E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4(DCAF1) in the nucleus. We found that  derepressed CRL4(DCAF1) promotes YAP- and TEAD-dependent transcription by  ubiquitylating and, thereby, inhibiting Lats1 and 2 in the nucleus. Genetic  epistasis experiments and analysis of tumor-derived missense mutations indicate  that this signaling connection sustains the oncogenicity of Merlin-deficient  tumor cells. Analysis of clinical samples confirms that this pathway operates in  NF2-mutant tumors. We conclude that derepressed CRL4(DCAF1) promotes activation  of YAP by inhibiting Lats1 and 2 in the nucleus.

PMID:25043298,Oncogenic role of Merlin/NF2 in glioblastoma.,"Oncogenic role of Merlin/NF2 in glioblastoma.  Guerrero PA(1), Yin W(1), Camacho L(1), Marchetti D(2).  Author information: (1)Department of Pathology and Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston,  TX, USA. (2)1] Department of Pathology and Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine,  Houston, TX, USA [2] Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor  College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.  Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults,  with a poor prognosis because of its resistance to radiotherapy and  chemotherapy. Merlin/NF2 (moesin-ezrin-radixin-like protein/neurofibromatosis  type 2) is a tumor suppressor found to be mutated in most nervous system tumors;  however, it is not mutated in glioblastomas. Merlin associates with several  transmembrane receptors and intracellular proteins serving as an anchoring  molecule. Additionally, it acts as a key component of cell motility. By  selecting sub-populations of U251 glioblastoma cells, we observed that high  expression of phosphorylated Merlin at serine 518 (S518-Merlin), NOTCH1 and  epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) correlated with increased cell  proliferation and tumorigenesis. These cells were defective in cell-contact  inhibition with changes in Merlin phosphorylation directly affecting NOTCH1 and  EGFR expression, as well as downstream targets HES1 (hairy and enhancer of  split-1) and CCND1 (cyclin D1). Of note, we identified a function for  S518-Merlin, which is distinct from what has been reported when the expression  of Merlin is diminished in relation to EGFR and NOTCH1 expression, providing  first-time evidence that demonstrates that the phosphorylation of S518-Merlin in  glioblastoma promotes oncogenic properties that are not only the result of  inactivation of the tumor suppressor role of Merlin but also an independent  process implicating a Merlin-driven regulation of NOTCH1 and EGFR.

Erratum in     J Bone Miner Res. 2015 Jun;30(6):1118.  Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disease with an  incidence of 1/3000, caused by mutations in the NF1 gene, which encodes the  RAS/GTPase-activating protein neurofibromin. Non-bone union after fracture  (pseudarthrosis) in children with NF1 remains a challenging orthopedic condition  to treat. Recent progress in understanding the biology of neurofibromin  suggested that NF1 pseudarthrosis stems primarily from defects in the bone  mesenchymal lineage and hypersensitivity of hematopoietic cells to TGFβ.  However, clinically relevant pharmacological approaches to augment bone union in  these patients remain limited. In this study, we report the generation of a  novel conditional mutant mouse line used to model NF1 pseudoarthrosis, in which  Nf1 can be ablated in an inducible fashion in osteoprogenitors of postnatal  mice, thus circumventing the dwarfism associated with previous mouse models  where Nf1 is ablated in embryonic mesenchymal cell lineages. An ex vivo-based  cell culture approach based on the use of Nf1(flox/flox) bone marrow stromal  cells showed that loss of Nf1 impairs osteoprogenitor cell differentiation in a  cell-autonomous manner, independent of developmental growth plate-derived or  paracrine/hormonal influences. In addition, in vitro gene expression and  differentiation assays indicated that chronic ERK activation in Nf1-deficient  osteoprogenitors blunts the pro-osteogenic property of BMP2, based on the  observation that only combination treatment with BMP2 and MEK inhibition  promoted the differentiation of Nf1-deficient osteoprogenitors. The in vivo  preclinical relevance of these findings was confirmed by the improved bone  healing and callus strength observed in Nf1osx (-/-) mice receiving Trametinib  (a MEK inhibitor) and BMP2 released locally at the fracture site via a novel  nanoparticle and polyglycidol-based delivery method. Collectively, these results  provide novel evidence for a cell-autonomous role of neurofibromin in  osteoprogenitor cells and insights about a novel targeted approach for the  treatment of NF1 pseudoarthrosis.  © 2014 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

(2)Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis,  MO, USA gutmannd@neuro.wustl.edu.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder in which  affected individuals are prone to learning, attention and behavioral problems.  Previous studies in mice and flies have yielded conflicting results regarding  the specific effector pathways responsible for NF1 protein (neurofibromin)  regulation of neuronal function, with both cyclic AMP (cAMP)- and RAS-dependent  mechanisms described. Herein, we leverage a combination of induced pluripotent  stem cell-derived NF1 patient neural progenitor cells and Nf1 genetically  engineered mice to establish, for the first time, that neurofibromin regulation  of cAMP requires RAS activation in human and mouse neurons. However, instead of  involving RAS-mediated MEK/AKT signaling, RAS regulation of cAMP homeostasis  operates through the activation of atypical protein kinase C zeta, leading to  GRK2-driven Gαs inactivation. These findings reveal a novel mechanism by which  RAS can regulate cAMP levels in the mammalian brain.  © The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Molecular diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is challenging owing to  the large size of the tumour suppressor gene NF1, and the lack of mutation  hotspots. A somatic alteration of the wild-type NF1 allele is observed in  NF1-associated tumours. Genetic heterogeneity in NF1 was confirmed in patients  with SPRED1 mutations. Here, we present a targeted next-generation sequencing  (NGS) of NF1 and SPRED1 using a multiplex PCR approach (230 amplicons of  ∼150 bp) on a PGM sequencer. The chip capacity allowed mixing 48 bar-coded  samples in a 4-day workflow. We validated the NGS approach by retrospectively  testing 30 NF1-mutated samples, and then prospectively analysed 279 patients in  routine diagnosis. On average, 98.5% of all targeted bases were covered by at  least 20X and 96% by at least 100X. An NF1 or SPRED1 alteration was found in  246/279 (88%) and 10/279 (4%) patients, respectively. Genotyping throughput was  increased over 10 times, as compared with Sanger, with ∼90[euro ] for  consumables per sample. Interestingly, our targeted NGS approach also provided  quantitative information based on sequencing depth allowing identification of  multiexons deletion or duplication. We then addressed the NF1 somatic mutation  detection sensitivity in mosaic NF1 patients and tumours.

Author information: (1)Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck, University of Iowa Hospitals and  Clinics. (2)Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck, University of Iowa Hospitals and  Clinics; marlan-hansen@uiowa.edu.  Vestibular schwannomas (VSs) represent Schwann cell (SC) tumors of the  vestibular nerve, compromising 10% of all intracranial neoplasms. VSs occur in  either sporadic or familial (neurofibromatosis type 2, NF2) forms, both  associated with inactivating defects in the NF2 tumor suppressor gene. Treatment  for VSs is generally surgical resection or radiosurgery, however the morbidity  of such procedures has driven investigations into less invasive treatments.  Historically, lack of access to fresh tissue specimens and the fact that  schwannoma cells are not immortalized have significantly hampered the use of  primary cultures for investigation of schwannoma tumorigenesis. To overcome the  limited supply of primary cultures, the immortalized HEI193 VS cell line was  generated by transduction with HPV E6 and E7 oncogenes. This oncogenic  transduction introduced significant molecular and phenotypic alterations to the  cells, which limit their use as a model for human schwannoma tumors. We  therefore illustrate a simplified, reproducible protocol for culture of primary  human VS cells. This easily mastered technique allows for molecular and cellular  investigations that more accurately recapitulate the complexity of VS disease.

This approach not only makes possible the  development of animal models that demonstrate phenotypic similarities to their  respective human disorders, but has also allowed for significant progress  towards understanding the processes that mediate synaptic function and memory  formation in the nondiseased state. Examples of successful mouse models where  genetic manipulation of the mouse resulted in recapitulation of the  symptomatology of the human disorder and was used to significantly expand our  understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying normal synaptic plasticity  and memory formation are discussed in this article. These studies have broadened  our knowledge of several signal transduction cascades that function throughout  life to mediate synaptic physiology. Defining these events is key for developing  therapies to address disorders of cognitive ability.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disease that predisposes  individuals to develop benign neurofibromas and malignant peripheral nerve  sheath tumors (MPNSTs). Due to the lack of information on the molecular  mechanism of NF1-associated tumor pathogenesis or biomarkers/therapeutic  targets, an effective treatment for NF1 tumors has not been established. In this  study, the novel NF1-associated protein, translationally controlled tumor  protein (TCTP), was identified by integrated proteomics and found to be  up-regulated via activated MAPK/PI3K-AKT signaling in response to growth factors  in NF1-deficient Schwann cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of NF1-associated  tumors revealed that the TCTP expression level correlated with tumorigenicity.  In NF1-deficient MPNST cells, TCTP protein but not mRNA was down-regulated by  NF1 GTPase-activating protein-related domain or MAPK/PI3K inhibitors, and this  correlated with suppression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling.  mTOR inhibition by rapamycin also down-regulated TCTP protein expression,  whereas knockdown or overexpression of TCTP suppressed or activated mTOR  signaling, respectively, and affected cell viability. These results suggest that  a positive feedback loop between TCTP and mTOR contributes to NF1-associated  tumor formation. Last, the anti-tumor effect of artesunate, which binds to and  degrades TCTP, was evaluated. Artesunate significantly suppressed the viability  of MPNST cells but not normal Schwann cells, and the TCTP level inversely  correlated with artesunate sensitivity. Moreover, combinational use of  artesunate and rapamycin enhanced the cytotoxic effect on MPNST cells. These  findings suggest that TCTP is functionally implicated in the progression of  NF1-associated tumors and could serve as a biological target for their therapy.  © 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) caused by NF1 gene mutation is a commonly  inherited autosomal dominant disorder. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors  (MPNSTs), a type of aggressive sarcoma, are a major cause of mortality in NF1  patients. The malignant transformation of benign plexiform neurofibromas (PNs)  to MPNSTs is a marked peculiarity in NF1 patients, yet the pathogenesis remains  poorly understood. We found that an actin-associated protein transgelin (SM22)  was highly expressed in NF1-deficient MPNST tissues compared to NF1-deficient PN  tissues using immunohistological staining and primary cultured MPNST cells in  western blot analysis. We further found that this transgelin upregulation was  caused by increased transcriptional expression of the TAGLN gene encoding  transgelin. Comparison of DNA methylation values in the promoter and subpromoter  regions of the TAGLN gene in three types of NF1-deficient primary-cultured  cells, derived from an NF1 patient's normal phenotype, a benign PN and MPNST  tissues, revealed that the TAGLN gene was hypomethylated in the MPNST cells.  Next, to determine the functional role of transgelin in MPNST pathogenesis, we  manipulated the TAGLN gene expression and investigated the alteration of the  RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway in the  normal-phenotypic and malignant tumor cells. The downregulation of TAGLN  expression in NF1-deficient MPNST tumor cells through the treatment of the small  interfering RNA resulted in a decrease in the RAS activation (GTP-RAS) and the  downstream ERK1/2 activation (phosphorylated ERK1/2), while the overexpression  of TAGLN in normal-phenotypic NF1-deficient cells caused an increase in RAS and  ERK1/2 activation. These results indicate that upregulation of transgelin caused  by hypomethylation of the TAGLN gene is closely involved in tumor progression in  NF1.

Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder  resulting from germline mutations in the NF2 gene. Bilateral vestibular  schwannomas, tumors on cranial nerve VIII, are pathognomonic for NF2 disease.  Furthermore, schwannomas also commonly develop in other cranial nerves, dorsal  root ganglia and peripheral nerves. These tumors are a major cause of morbidity  and mortality, and medical therapies to treat them are limited. Animal models  that accurately recapitulate the full anatomical spectrum of human NF2-related  schwannomas, including the characteristic functional deficits in hearing and  balance associated with cranial nerve VIII tumors, would allow systematic  evaluation of experimental therapeutics prior to clinical use. Here, we present  a genetically engineered NF2 mouse model generated through excision of the Nf2  gene driven by Cre expression under control of a tissue-restricted  3.9kbPeriostin promoter element. By 10 months of age, 100% of Postn-Cre;  Nf2(flox/flox) mice develop spinal, peripheral and cranial nerve tumors  histologically identical to human schwannomas. In addition, the development of  cranial nerve VIII tumors correlates with functional impairments in hearing and  balance, as measured by auditory brainstem response and vestibular testing.  Overall, the Postn-Cre; Nf2(flox/flox) tumor model provides a novel tool for  future mechanistic and therapeutic studies of NF2-associated schwannomas.  © The Author 2014.

This study examined whether mice with a deficiency of neurofibromin, a Ras  GTPase activating protein, exhibit a nociceptive phenotype and probed a possible  contribution by calcitonin gene-related peptide. In the absence of inflammation,  Nf1+/- mice (B6.129S6 Nf1<tm1Fcr>/J) and wild type littermates responded  comparably to heat or mechanical stimuli, except for a subtle enhanced  mechanical sensitivity in female Nf1+/- mice. Nociceptive phenotype was also  examined after inflammation induced by capsaicin and formalin, which release  endogenous calcitonin gene-related peptide. Intraplantar injection of capsaicin  evoked comparable heat hyperalgesia and mechanical hypersensitivity in Nf1+/-  and wild type mice of both genders. Formalin injection caused a similar duration  of licking in male Nf1+/- and wild type mice. Female Nf1+/- mice licked less  than wild type mice, but displayed other nociceptive behaviors. In contrast,  intraplantar injection of CGRP caused greater heat hyperalgesia in Nf1+/- mice  of both genders compared to wild type mice. Male Nf1+/- mice also exhibited  greater mechanical hypersensitivity; however, female Nf1+/- mice exhibited less  mechanical hypersensitivity than their wild type littermates. Transcripts for  calcitonin gene-related peptide were similar in the dorsal root ganglia of both  genotypes and genders. Transcripts for receptor activity-modifying protein-1,  which is rate-limiting for the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor, in the  spinal cord were comparable for both genotypes and genders. The increased  responsiveness to intraplantar calcitonin gene-related peptide suggests that the  peripheral actions of calcitonin gene-related peptide are enhanced as a result  of the neurofibromin deficit. The analgesic efficacy of calcitonin gene-related  peptide receptor antagonists may therefore merit investigation in  neurofibromatosis patients.

PMID:25204795,Regulation of cell proliferation and adhesion by means of a novel region of drosophila merlin interacting with Sip1.,"Regulation of cell proliferation and adhesion by means of a novel region of  drosophila merlin interacting with Sip1.  Abeysundara N(1), Leung AC, Primrose DA, Hughes SC.  Author information: (1)Department of Medical Genetics, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta,  Canada.  BACKGROUND: The tumor suppressor protein merlin is thought to regulate cell  proliferation and cell adhesion through interaction with protein partners. Loss  of merlin is associated with Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) tumors. NHERF1 or  EBP50 is a scaffolding protein that functions in apical organization of  polarized cells. Merlin and NHERF1 have been shown to interact in vitro in  vertebrates. We investigate how the Drosophila NHERF1 orthologue, Sip1, and  Merlin function to regulate cell proliferation and adhesion. RESULTS: We identify two conserved arginine residues (R325 and R335) in Merlin  which, in addition to the FERM domain, are required for interaction with Sip1.  Mutation of the arginine residues result in reduced Sip1 binding to Merlin and  loss of Merlin growth suppressor function. Over-expression of Merlin(R325A)  and/or Merlin(R335L) in Drosophila wings result in increased proliferation in  the adult wing (increase in size), which is rescued by co-over-expression of  constitutively active Merlin protein. Reduced Sip1 binding to Merlin also  produces defects in adhesion in follicle epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Sip1 facilitates the activation of Merlin as a tumor suppressor  protein. Thus, our work provides insight into how Merlin functions as a tumor  suppressor and in adhesion and this provides insight into the mechanism of NF2  pathogenesis.  © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Electronic address:  oliver.hanemann@plymouth.ac.uk.  Deficiency of the tumour suppressor merlin leads to the development of  schwannomas, meningiomas and ependymomas occurring spontaneously or as a part of  the hereditary disease Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). Merlin loss is also found  in a proportion of other cancers like mesothelioma, melanoma, breast cancer and  glioblastoma. The tumour suppressor/transcription factor p53 regulates  proliferation, survival and differentiation and its deficiency plays a role in  the development of many tumours. 53 can be negatively regulated by FAK, PI3K/AKT  and MDM2 and possibly positively regulated by merlin in different cell lines. In  this study we investigated the role of p53 in merlin-deficient tumours. Using  our in vitro model of primary human schwannoma cells we have previously  demonstrated that FAK is overexpressed/activated and localises into the nucleus  of schwannoma cells increasing proliferation. AKT is strongly activated via  platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) - and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1)  - receptors increasing survival. Here we investigated p53 regulation and its  role in proliferation and survival of human primary schwannoma cells using  western blotting, immunocytochemistry, immunohistochemistry and proliferation,  survival and transcription factor assays. In human primary schwannoma cells p53  was found to be downregulated while MDM2 was upregulated leading to increased  cell proliferation and survival. p53 is regulated by merlin involving FAK, AKT  and MDM2. Merlin reintroduction into schwannoma cells increased p53 levels and  activity, and treatment with Nutlin-3, a drug which increases p53 stability by  disrupting the p53/MDM2 complex, decreased tumour growth and reduced cell  survival. These findings are important to dissect the mechanisms responsible for  the development of merlin-deficient tumours and to identify new therapeutic  targets. We suggest that Nutlin-3, possibly in combination with FAK or PI3K  inhibitors, can be employed as a novel treatment for schwannoma and other  merlin-deficient tumours.  Crown Copyright © 2014.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) represent a group of highly  aggressive soft-tissue sarcomas that may occur sporadically, in association with  neurofibromatosis type I (NF1 associated) or after radiotherapy. Using  comprehensive genomic approaches, we identified loss-of-function somatic  alterations of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) components (EED or  SUZ12) in 92% of sporadic, 70% of NF1-associated and 90% of  radiotherapy-associated MPNSTs. MPNSTs with PRC2 loss showed complete loss of  trimethylation at lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) and aberrant  transcriptional activation of multiple PRC2-repressed homeobox master regulators  and their regulated developmental pathways. Introduction of the lost PRC2  component in a PRC2-deficient MPNST cell line restored H3K27me3 levels and  decreased cell growth. Additionally, we identified frequent somatic alterations  of CDKN2A (81% of all MPNSTs) and NF1 (72% of non-NF1-associated MPNSTs), both  of which significantly co-occur with PRC2 alterations. The highly recurrent and  specific inactivation of PRC2 components, NF1 and CDKN2A highlights their  critical and potentially cooperative roles in MPNST pathogenesis.

Kaul A(1), Toonen JA(1), Gianino SM(1), Gutmann DH(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis,  Missouri.  BACKGROUND: Children with the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) tumor  predisposition syndrome are prone to the development of optic pathway gliomas  resulting from biallelic inactivation of the NF1 gene. Recent studies have  revealed the presence of other molecular alterations in a small portion of these  NF1-associated brain tumors. The purpose of this study was to leverage Nf1  genetically engineered mouse strains to define the functional significance of  these changes to optic glioma biology. METHODS: Nf1+/- mice were intercrossed with Nf1(flox/flox) mice, which were then  crossed with Nf1(flox/flox); GFAP-Cre mice, to generate Nf1(flox/mut); GFAP-Cre  (FMC) mice. These mice were additionally mated with conditional KIAA1549:BRAF  knock-in or Pten(flox/wt) mice to generate Nf1(flox/mut); f-BRAF; GFAP-Cre  (FMBC) mice or Nf1(flox/mut); Pten(flox/wt); GFAP-Cre (FMPC) mice, respectively.  The resulting optic gliomas were analyzed for changes in tumor volume,  proliferation, and retinal ganglion cell loss. RESULTS: While KIAA1549:BRAF conferred no additional biological properties on  Nf1 optic glioma, FMPC mice had larger optic gliomas with greater proliferative  indices and microglial infiltration. In addition, all 3 Nf1 murine optic glioma  strains exhibited reduced retinal ganglion cell survival and numbers; however,  FMPC mice had greater retinal nerve fiber layer thinning near the optic head  relative to FMC and FMBC mice. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these experiments demonstrate genetic cooperativity  between Nf1 loss and Pten heterozygosity relevant to optic glioma biology and  further underscore the value of employing genetically engineered mouse strains  to define the contribution of discovered molecular alterations to brain tumor  pathogenesis.  © The Author(s) 2014.

Genome-wide association studies indicated the homeobox-containing transcription  factor Engrailed-2 (En2) as a candidate gene for autism spectrum disorders  (ASD). Accordingly, En2 knock-out (En2(-/-)) mice show anatomical and behavioral  ""ASD-like"" features, including decreased sociability and learning deficits. The  molecular pathways underlying these deficits in En2(-/-) mice are not known.  Deficits in signaling pathways involving neurofibromin and  extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) have been associated with impaired  learning. Here we investigated the neurofibromin-ERK cascade in the hippocampus  of wild-type (WT) and En2(-/-) mice before and after spatial learning testing.  When compared with WT littermates, En2(-/-) mice showed impaired performance in  the Morris water maze (MWM), which was accompanied by lower expression of the  activity-dependent gene Arc. Quantitative RT-PCR, immunoblotting, and  immunohistochemistry experiments showed a marked downregulation of neurofibromin  expression in the dentate gyrus of both naive and MWM-treated En2(-/-) mice. ERK  phosphorylation, known to be induced in the presence of neurofibromin  deficiency, was increased in the dentate gyrus of En2(-/-) mice after MWM.  Treatment of En2(-/-) mice with lovastatin, an indirect inhibitor of ERK  phosphorylation, markedly reduced ERK phosphorylation in the dentate gyrus, but  was unable to rescue learning deficits in MWM-trained mutant mice. Further  investigation is needed to unravel the complex molecular mechanisms linking  dysregulation of neurofibromin-dependent pathways to spatial learning deficits  in the En2 mouse model of ASD.

PMID:25289889,Combinatorial therapy with tamoxifen and trifluoperazine effectively inhibits malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor growth by targeting complementary signaling cascades.,"Combinatorial therapy with tamoxifen and trifluoperazine effectively inhibits  malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor growth by targeting complementary  signaling cascades.  Brosius SN(1), Turk AN, Byer SJ, Longo JF, Kappes JC, Roth KA, Carroll SL.  Author information: (1)From the Departments of Pathology (SNB, ANT, SJB, KAR, SLC) and Medicine  (JCK) and the Medical Scientist Training Program (SNB), University of Alabama at  Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama; and Department of Pathology and Laboratory  Medicine (JFL, SLC), Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South  Carolina.  Chemotherapeutic agents effective against malignant peripheral nerve sheath  tumors (MPNSTs) are urgently needed. We recently found that tamoxifen potently  impedes xenograft growth. In vitro, tamoxifen inhibits MPNST proliferation and  survival in an estrogen receptor-independent manner; these effects are  phenocopied by the calmodulin inhibitor trifluoperazine. The present study was  performed to establish the mechanism of action of tamoxifen in vivo and optimize  its therapeutic effectiveness. To determine if tamoxifen has estrogen  receptor-dependent effects in vivo, we grafted MPNST cells in castrated and  ovariectomized mice; xenograft growth was unaffected by reductions in sex  hormones. To establish whether tamoxifen and trifluoperazine additively or  synergistically impede MPNST growth, mice xenografted with neurofibromatosis  type 1-associated or sporadic MPNST cells were treated with tamoxifen,  trifluoperazine, or both drugs for 30 days. Both monotherapies inhibited graft  growth by 50%, whereas combinatorial treatment maximally reduced graft mass by  90% and enhanced decreases in proliferation and survival. Kinomic analyses  showed that tamoxifen and trifluoperazine have both shared and distinct targets  in MPNSTs. In addition, trifluoperazine prevented tamoxifen-induced increases in  serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1, a protein linked to tamoxifen  resistance. These findings suggest that combinatorial therapy with tamoxifen and  trifluoperazine is effective against MPNSTs because these agents target  complementary pathways that are essential for MPNST pathogenesis.

Author information: (1)1 Center for Medical Genetics, Keio University School of Medicine , Tokyo,  Japan .  AIMS: We assessed the validity of a next-generation sequencing protocol using  in-solution hybridization-based enrichment to identify NF1 mutations for the  diagnosis of 86 patients with a prototypic genetic syndrome, neurofibromatosis  type 1. In addition, other causative genes for classic genetic syndromes were  set as the target genes for coverage analysis. RESULTS: The protocol identified 30 nonsense, 19 frameshift, and 8 splice-site  mutations, together with 10 nucleotide substitutions that were previously  reported to be pathogenic. In the remaining 19 samples, 10 had single-exon or  multiple-exon deletions detected by a multiplex ligation-dependent probe  amplification method and 3 had missense mutations that were not observed in the  normal Japanese SNP database and were predicted to be pathogenic. Coverage  analysis of the genes other than the NF1 gene included on the same diagnostic  panel indicated that the mean coverage was 115-fold, a sufficient depth for  mutation detection. CONCLUSIONS: The overall mutation detection rate using the currently reported  method in 86 patients who met the clinical diagnostic criteria was 92.1% (70/76)  when 10 patients with large deletions were excluded. The results validate the  clinical utility of this next-generation sequencing-based method for the  diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1. Comparable detection rates can be  expected for other genetic syndromes, based on the results of the coverage  analysis.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant, monogenic disorder of  dysregulated neurocutaneous tissue growth. Pleiotropy, variable expressivity and  few NF1 genotype-phenotype correlates limit clinical prognostication in NF1.  Phenotype complexity in NF1 is hypothesized to derive in part from genetic  modifiers unlinked to the NF1 locus. In this study, we hypothesized that normal  variation in germline gene expression confers risk for certain phenotypes in  NF1. In a set of 79 individuals with NF1, we examined the association between  gene expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines with NF1-associated phenotypes and  sequenced select genes with significant phenotype/expression correlations. In a  discovery cohort of 89 self-reported European-Americans with NF1 we examined the  association between germline sequence variants of these genes with café-au-lait  macule (CALM) count, a tractable, tumor-like phenotype in NF1. Two correlated,  common SNPs (rs4660761 and rs7161) between DPH2 and ATP6V0B were significantly  associated with the CALM count. Analysis with tiled regression also identified  SNP rs4660761 as significantly associated with CALM count. SNP rs1800934 and 12  rare variants in the mismatch repair gene MSH6 were also associated with CALM  count. Both SNPs rs7161 and rs4660761 (DPH2 and ATP6V0B) were highly significant  in a mega-analysis in a combined cohort of 180 self-reported European-Americans;  SNP rs1800934 (MSH6) was near-significant in a meta-analysis assuming dominant  effect of the minor allele. SNP rs4660761 is predicted to regulate ATP6V0B, a  gene associated with melanosome biology. Individuals with homozygous mutations  in MSH6 can develop an NF1-like phenotype, including multiple CALMs. Through a  multi-platform approach, we identified variants that influence NF1 CALM count.

Schwannomatosis is characterized by the development of multiple non-vestibular,  non-intradermal schwannomas. Constitutional inactivating variants in two genes,  SMARCB1 and, very recently, LZTR1, have been reported. We performed exome  sequencing of 13 schwannomatosis patients from 11 families without SMARCB1  deleterious variants. We identified four individuals with heterozygous  loss-of-function variants in LZTR1. Sequencing of the germline of 60 additional  patients identified 18 additional heterozygous variants in LZTR1. We identified  LZTR1 variants in 43% and 30% of familial (three of the seven families) and  sporadic patients, respectively. In addition, we tested LZTR1 protein  immunostaining in 22 tumors from nine unrelated patients with and without LZTR1  deleterious variants. Tumors from individuals with LZTR1 variants lost the  protein expression in at least a subset of tumor cells, consistent with a tumor  suppressor mechanism. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that molecular  analysis of LZTR1 may contribute to the molecular characterization of  schwannomatosis patients, in addition to NF2 mutational analysis and the  detection of chromosome 22 losses in tumor tissue. It will be especially useful  in differentiating schwannomatosis from mosaic Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2).  However, the role of LZTR1 in the pathogenesis of schwannomatosis needs further  elucidation.

Lavado A(1), Ware M(1), Paré J(1), Cao X(2).  Author information: (1)Department of Developmental Neurobiology, St. Jude Children's Research  Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. (2)Department of Developmental Neurobiology, St. Jude Children's Research  Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA Xinwei.cao@stjude.org.  The corpus callosum connects cerebral hemispheres and is the largest axon tract  in the mammalian brain. Callosal malformations are among the most common  congenital brain anomalies and are associated with a wide range of  neuropsychological deficits. Crossing of the midline by callosal axons relies on  a proper midline environment that harbors guidepost cells emitting guidance cues  to instruct callosal axon navigation. Little is known about what controls the  formation of the midline environment. We find that two components of the Hippo  pathway, the tumor suppressor Nf2 (Merlin) and the transcriptional coactivator  Yap (Yap1), regulate guidepost development and expression of the guidance cue  Slit2 in mouse. During normal brain development, Nf2 suppresses Yap activity in  neural progenitor cells to promote guidepost cell differentiation and prevent  ectopic Slit2 expression. Loss of Nf2 causes malformation of midline guideposts  and Slit2 upregulation, resulting in callosal agenesis. Slit2 heterozygosity and  Yap deletion both restore callosal formation in Nf2 mutants. Furthermore,  selectively elevating Yap activity in midline neural progenitors is sufficient  to disrupt guidepost formation, upregulate Slit2 and prevent midline crossing.  The Hippo pathway is known for its role in controlling organ growth and  tumorigenesis. Our study identifies a novel role of this pathway in axon  guidance. Moreover, by linking axon pathfinding and neural progenitor behaviors,  our results provide an example of the intricate coordination between growth and  wiring during brain development.  © 2014.

Plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) are benign nerve sheath tumors mostly associated  with neurofibromatosis type 1. They often extend through multiple layers of  tissue and therefore cannot be treated satisfactorily by surgery. Nilotinib is a  tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat leukemia, with advantages over the  prototype imatinib in terms of potency and selectivity towards BCR-ABL, and the  DDR, PDGFR, and KIT receptor kinases. In this study, we compared efficacies of  the two drugs on cultured cells of PNF in vitro and on xenografted tumor  fragments on sciatic nerve of athymic nude mice. Xenografts were monitored  weekly using a high resolution ultrasound measurement. Treatment with nilotinib  at a daily dose of 100 mg/kg for four weeks led to a reduction of the graft  sizesstd by 68±7% in the 8 treated mice, significantly more than the 33±8%  reduction in the 8 untreated mice (P<0.05) and the 47±15% in the 7 mice treated  with imatinib (P<0.05). The peak plasma nilotinib concentration 6.6±1.1 µM is  within the pharmacological range of clinical application. Imatinib, but not  nilotinib significantly hindered body weight increase of the mice and elevated  cytotoxicity of mouse spleen cells (P<0.05). Our results suggest that nilotinib  may be more potent than imatinib for treating PNFs and may also be better  tolerated. Imatinib seems to have some off-target effect in elevating immunity.

Mutations in the merlin tumor suppressor gene cause Neurofibromatosis type 2  (NF2), which is a disease characterized by development of multiple benign tumors  in the nervous system. The current standard of care for NF2 calls for surgical  resection of the characteristic tumors, often with devastating neurological  consequences. There are currently no approved non-surgical therapies for NF2. In  an attempt to identify much needed targets and therapeutically active compounds  for NF2 treatment, we employed a chemical biology approach using  ultra-high-throughput screening. To support this goal, we created a merlin-null  mouse Schwann cell (MSC) line to screen for compounds that selectively decrease  their viability and proliferation. We optimized conditions for 384-well plate  assays and executed a proof-of-concept screen of the Library of  Pharmacologically Active Compounds. Further confirmatory and selectivity assays  identified phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) as a potential NF2 drug target.  Notably, loss of merlin function is associated with activation of the PI3K/Akt  pathway in human schwannomas. We report that AS605240, a PI3K inhibitor,  decreased merlin-null MSC viability in a dose-dependent manner without  significantly decreasing viability of control Schwann cells. AS605240 exerted  its action on merlin-null MSCs by promoting caspase-dependent apoptosis and  inducing autophagy. Additional PI3K inhibitors tested also decreased viability  of merlin-null MSCs in a dose-dependent manner. In summary, our chemical genomic  screen and subsequent hit validation studies have identified PI3K as potential  target for NF2 therapy.

Martin S(1), Nelson Schmitt S, Wolters PL, Abel B, Toledo-Tamula MA, Baldwin A,  Wicksell RK, Merchant M, Widemann B.  Author information: (1)National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland,  USA.  OBJECTIVE: Measurement of pain interference in children is challenged by a lack  of validated measures with a parent proxy report. This study investigated the  psychometric properties of the Pain Interference Index (PII), a six-item  questionnaire originally developed in Swedish, in chronically ill youth. METHODS: We adapted the PII for English-speaking participants and created a  parallel parent proxy measure. Respondents indicate how much pain has interfered  with the child's life in the past 2 weeks (0-6 scale); higher scores indicate  more pain interference. Eligible participants included individuals 6-25 years  with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and cancer. Internal consistency was  assessed; validity was examined by correlating PII scores with existing measures  of pain interference (Modified Brief Pain Inventory [MBPI]) and pain intensity  (visual analogue scale [VAS]), and with measures of disease severity. RESULTS: Among 60 participants (mean age 14.7 years, range 6-24) and their  parents, PII internal consistency was 0.84 and 0.96, respectively. PII scores  correlated with MBPI (r = 0.81, P < 0.0001) and VAS (r = 0.55, P < 0.0001)  scores and differentiated between patients with mild vs moderate/severe NF1  disease severity (P < 0.05). The PII-Parent was significantly correlated with  the mothers' and fathers' VAS rating of the child's pain intensity (Ps < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Internal consistency of the English PII is high; validity is  supported by the PII's correlations with other measures of pain interference and  pain intensity, and with disease severity in patients with NF1. Preliminary data  indicate that the English PII is a reliable, valid, feasible pain interference  measure for youth with NF1 and cancer.  Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Molecular mechanisms governing the maintenance and proliferation of dorsal root  ganglia (DRG) progenitors are largely unknown. Here we reveal that the Hippo  pathway regulates the expansion of DRG progenitors and glia during mammalian DRG  development. The key effectors of this pathway, transcriptional coactivators Yap  and Taz, are expressed in DRG progenitors and glia during DRG development but  are at least partially inhibited from activating transcription. Aberrant YAP  activation leads to overexpansion of DRG progenitor and glial populations. We  further show that the Neurofibromatosis 2 (Nf2) tumor suppressor inhibits Yap  during DRG development. Loss of Nf2 leads to similar phenotypes as does YAP  hyperactivation, and deleting Yap suppresses these phenotypes. Our study  demonstrates that Nf2-Yap signaling plays important roles in controlling the  expansion of DRG progenitors and glia during DRG development.  Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by  a broad spectrum of cognitive deficits. In particular, executive dysfunction is  recognized as a core deficit of NF1, including impairments in executive  attention and inhibitory control. Yet, the neural mechanisms behind these  important deficits are still unknown. Here, we studied inhibitory control in a  visual go/no-go task in children and adolescents with NF1 and age- and  gender-matched controls (n = 16 per group). We applied a multimodal approach  using high-density electroencephalography (EEG), to study the evoked brain  responses, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure the levels of  GABA and glutamate + glutamine in the medial frontal cortex, a brain region that  plays a pivotal role in inhibitory control, and also in a control region, the  occipital cortex. Finally, we run correlation analyses to identify the  relationship between inhibitory control, levels of neurotransmitters, and EEG  markers of neural function. Individuals with NF1 showed impaired impulse control  and reduced EEG correlates of early visual processing (parieto-occipital P1) and  inhibitory control (frontal P3). MRS data revealed a reduction in medial frontal  GABA+/tCr (total Creatine) levels in the NF1 group, in parallel with the already  reported reduced occipital GABA levels. In contrast, glutamate + glutamine/tCr  levels were normal, suggesting the existence of abnormal inhibition/excitation  balance in this disorder. Notably, medial frontal but not occipital GABA levels  correlated with general intellectual abilities (IQ) in NF1, and inhibitory  control in both groups. Surprisingly, the relationship between inhibitory  control and medial frontal GABA was reversed in NF1: higher GABA was associated  with a faster response style whereas in controls it was related to a cautious  strategy. Abnormal GABAergic physiology appears, thus, as an important factor  underlying impaired cognition in NF1, in a level and region dependent manner.  Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Comment in     Neuro Oncol. 2015 Apr;17(4):481-2. doi: 10.1093/neuonc/nou338.  BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a tumor syndrome that results from  mutation of the NF2 tumor suppressor gene. The hallmark of NF2 is the presence  of bilateral vestibular schwannoma (VS). Though NF2-associated and sporadic VS  share identical histopathologic findings and cytogenetic alterations,  NF2-associated VS often appears multilobulated, is less responsive to  radiosurgery, and has worse surgical outcomes. Temporal bone autopsy specimens  and MRI of the inner ear performed on NF2 patients suggest that multiple  discrete tumors may be present within the labyrinth and cerebellopontine angle. METHODS: Treatment-naïve ears in patients enrolled in a prospective NF2 natural  history study (NIH#08-N-0044) were included for MRI analysis. T2-weighted and  postcontrast T1-weighted MRIs were evaluated for the presence of multiple  discrete tumors or a multilobulated mass. Peripheral blood (germline) and  regional samples of tumor tissue were procured from consecutive patients  enrolled in this study undergoing resection of a multilobulated VS (MVS).  Histopathologic evaluation and genetic analysis (single nucleotide polymorphism  array analysis, NF2 sequencing) were performed on each specimen. RESULTS: Over half of NF2 ears harbored either an MVS (60/139 ears) or multiple  discrete masses (19/139 ears). For 4 successive MVSs, genetic analysis revealed  an admixture of cell populations, each with its own somatic NF2 mutation or  deletion. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the majority of NF2-associated VSs are  polyclonal, such that the tumor mass represents a collision of multiple,  distinct tumor clones. This explains the characteristic lobulated gross  appearance of NF2-associated VS, and may also explain the substantially  different treatment outcomes compared with sporadic VS.

PMID:25475340,Validity and interexaminer reliability of a new method to quantify skin neurofibromas of neurofibromatosis 1 using paper frames.,"Validity and interexaminer reliability of a new method to quantify skin  neurofibromas of neurofibromatosis 1 using paper frames.  Cunha KS, Rozza-de-Menezes RE, Andrade RM, Theos A, Luiz RR, Korf B, Geller M.  BACKGROUND: Skin neurofibromas represent one of the main clinical manifestations  of neurofibromatosis 1, and their number varies greatly between individuals.  Quantifying their number is an important step in the methodology of many  clinical studies, but counting neurofibromas one by one in individuals with  thousands of tumors is arduous, time-consuming, and subject to intra and  interexaminer variability. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a new  methodology for skin neurofibromas quantification using paper frames. METHODS: The sample comprised 92 individuals with NF1. Paper frames, with a  central square measuring 100 cm2, were placed on the back, abdomen and thigh.  Images were taken, transferred to a computer and two independent examiners  counted the neurofibromas. The average number of neurofibromas/100 cm2 of skin  was obtained from the mean of the three values. The differences in the quantity  of neurofibromas counted by two examiners were evaluated with Intraclass  correlation coefficient (ICC), paired t-test, Bland-Altman and  survival-agreement plots. To evaluate the predictive value of the method in  obtaining the total number of neurofibromas, 49 participants also had their  tumors counted one by one. Reproducibility was assessed with Pearson's  correlation coefficients and simple linear regression model. RESULTS: There was excellent agreement between examiners (ICC range 0.992-0.997)  and the total number of skin neurofibromas could be predicted by the adhesive  frames technique using a specific formula (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In this article we describe a reliable, easy and rapid technique  using paper frames to quantify skin neurofibromas that accurately predicts the  total number of these tumors in patients with NF1. This method may be a useful  tool in clinical practice and clinical research to help achieve an accurate  quantitative phenotype of NF1.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine the proportion of individuals in our  schwannomatosis cohort whose disease is associated with an LZTR1 mutation. METHODS: We used exome sequencing, Sanger sequencing, and copy number analysis  to screen 65 unrelated individuals with schwannomatosis who were negative for a  germline NF2 or SMARCB1 mutation. We also screened samples from 39 patients with  a unilateral vestibular schwannoma (UVS), plus at least one other schwannoma,  but who did not have an identifiable germline or mosaic NF2 mutation. RESULTS: We identified germline LZTR1 mutations in 6 of 16 patients (37.5%) with  schwannomatosis who had at least one affected relative, 11 of 49 (22%) sporadic  patients, and 2 of 39 patients with UVS in our cohort. Three germline  mutation-positive patients in total had developed a UVS. Mosaicism was excluded  in 3 patients without germline mutation in NF2, SMARCB1, or LZTR1 by mutation  screening in 2 tumors from each. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm the relationship between mutations in LZTR1 and  schwannomatosis. They indicate that germline mutations in LZTR1 confer an  increased risk of vestibular schwannoma, providing further overlap with NF2, and  that further causative genes for schwannomatosis remain to be identified.  © 2014 American Academy of Neurology.

(#)Contributed equally  BACKGROUND: The neurofibromatosis type 1 (Nf1) gene encodes a GTPase activating  protein that negatively regulates small GTPases of the Ras family. METHODS: We assessed alcohol-related behaviors including alcohol sensitivity,  dependent and nondependent drinking, and basal and alcohol-induced  gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release in the central nucleus of the amygdala  (CeA) in Nf1 heterozygous null mice (Nf1(+/-)). We also investigated the  associations of NF1 polymorphisms with alcohol dependence risk and severity in  humans. RESULTS: Nf1(+/-) mice do not differ from wild-type mice in nondependent  drinking, such as 24-hour, 2-bottle choice drinking in the dark binge drinking  or limited access 2-bottle choice. However, Nf1(+/-) mice failed to escalate  alcohol drinking following chronic intermittent ethanol vapor exposure (CIE) to  induce dependence. Alcohol acutely increases GABA release in the CeA and alcohol  dependence is characterized by increased baseline GABA release in CeA.  Interestingly, GABA release in Nf1(+/-) mice is greater at baseline than  wild-type mice, is not elevated by induction of dependence by CIE, and failed to  show alcohol-induced facilitation both before and after CIE. Additionally, we  observed that multiple variants in the human NF1 gene are associated with a  quantitative measure of alcohol dependence in both African Americans and  European Americans. CONCLUSIONS: In this translational investigation, we found that Nf1 activity  regulates excessive drinking and basal and ethanol-stimulated GABA release in  the mouse central amygdala. We also found that genetic variation in NF1 may  confer an inherent susceptibility to the transition from nondependent to  dependent drinking in humans.

A new animal model for von Recklinghausen's  neurofibromatosis.  Nakamura T(1), Hara M, Kasuga T.  Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, Toranomon Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.  Multiple peripheral nervous tumors were induced in 45 of 60 (75.0%) Syrian  golden hamsters by transplacental administration of N-ethyl-N-nitro-sourea.  Moreover, melanomas, pheochromocytomas, and Wilms' tumors developed in six  (10.0%), three (5.0%), and 13 (21.7%) animals, respectively. The histologic,  immunohistochemical, and electron microscopic findings of the peripheral nervous  tumors were similar to those of human neurofibroma, and their growth pattern and  distribution resembled those of human von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis  (VRNF). The occurrence of melanoma, pheochromocytoma, and proliferative foci of  melanin-containing cells in neurofibroma suggests that the targets of ENU in  hamsters are the neural crest-derived cells. With its high incidence of Wilms'  tumor, the hamster with ENU-induced tumors is considered to be a good animal  model for human neurocristopathy, including VRNF.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) carries a significant psychosocial burden for  affected individuals. The objective of this study was to measure the prevalence  of depressive symptoms among a large sample of adults with NF1 and to quantify  the impact of depressive symptoms on quality of life (QoL). This cross-sectional  study used an Internet-based questionnaire to collect data from 498 adults who  self-reported as having NF1. Using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies  Depression (CESD) scale, 55% of all participants (61% of females and 43% of  males) scored above 16, indicating a high likelihood of clinical depression. In  a multivariate regression model controlling for demographics and potential  confounders, depressive symptoms accounted for 32% of the variance in QoL as  measured by the Quality of Life Index. This study is the largest to date and  found the highest prevalence of depression compared to prior studies. Our data  provide more compelling evidence that individuals with NF1 are at increased risk  for psychiatric morbidity and suggest that this population should be routinely  screened for depression. Because depression was found to be strongly associated  with QoL and accounted for nearly one-third of the variance in QoL, it is likely  that effectively treating depression may significantly enhance QoL for  individuals with NF1.  © 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

BACKGROUND: Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) develop optic pathway  gliomas, which result from impaired NF1 protein regulation of Ras activity. One  obstacle to the implementation of biologically targeted therapies is an  incomplete understanding of the individual contributions of the downstream Ras  effectors (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase [MEK], Akt) to optic glioma  maintenance. This study was designed to address the importance of MEK and Akt  signaling to Nf1 optic glioma growth. METHODS: Primary neonatal mouse astrocyte cultures were employed to determine  the consequence of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt and MEK inhibition  on Nf1-deficient astrocyte growth. Nf1 optic glioma-bearing mice were used to  assess the effect of Akt and MEK inhibition on tumor volume, proliferation, and  retinal ganglion cell dysfunction. RESULTS: Both MEK and Akt were hyperactivated in Nf1-deficient astrocytes in  vitro and in Nf1 murine optic gliomas in vivo. Pharmacologic PI3K or Akt  inhibition reduced Nf1-deficient astrocyte proliferation to wild-type levels,  while PI3K inhibition decreased Nf1 optic glioma volume and proliferation. Akt  inhibition of Nf1-deficient astrocyte and optic glioma growth reflected  Akt-dependent activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Sustained MEK  pharmacologic blockade also attenuated Nf1-deficient astrocytes as well as Nf1  optic glioma volume and proliferation. Importantly, these MEK inhibitory effects  resulted from p90RSK-mediated, Akt-independent mTOR activation. Finally, both  PI3K and MEK inhibition reduced optic glioma-associated retinal ganglion cell  loss and nerve fiber layer thinning. CONCLUSION: These findings establish that the convergence of 2 distinct Ras  effector pathways on mTOR signaling maintains Nf1 mouse optic glioma growth,  supporting the evaluation of pharmacologic inhibitors that target mTOR function  in future human NF1-optic pathway glioma clinical trials.  © The Author(s) 2014.

Individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) frequently exhibit cognitive and  motor impairments and characteristics of autism. The cerebellum plays a critical  role in motor control, cognition, and social interaction, suggesting that  cerebellar defects likely contribute to NF1-associated neurodevelopmental  disorders. Here we show that Nf1 inactivation during early, but not late stages  of cerebellar development, disrupts neuronal lamination, which is partially  caused by overproduction of glia and subsequent disruption of the Bergmann glia  (BG) scaffold. Specific Nf1 inactivation in glutamatergic neuronal precursors  causes premature differentiation of granule cell (GC) precursors and ectopic  production of unipolar brush cells (UBCs), indirectly disrupting neuronal  migration. Transient MEK inhibition during a neonatal window prevents cerebellar  developmental defects and improves long-term motor performance of Nf1-deficient  mice. This study reveals essential roles of Nf1 in GC/UBC migration by  generating correct numbers of glia and controlling GC/UBC  fate-specification/differentiation, identifying a therapeutic prevention  strategy for multiple NF1-associcated developmental abnormalities.

(#)Contributed equally  BACKGROUND: Meningiomas are tumors originating from the membranous layers  surrounding the central nervous system, and are generally regarded as ""benign""  tumors of the brain. Malignant meningiomas are rare and are typically associated  with a higher risk of local tumor recurrence and a poorer prognosis (median  survival time <2 years). Previous genome-wide association studies and exome  sequencing studies have identified genes that play a role in susceptibility to  meningiomas, but these studies did not focus specifically on malignant tumors. METHODS: We performed exome sequencing on five malignant meningiomas on the  Illumina HiSeq2000 platform using Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon kits. We  used wANNOVAR web server to annotate and prioritize variants, identified  candidate genes with recurrent mutations, and validated selected mutations by  Sanger sequencing. We next designed custom NimbleGen targeted region arrays on  five candidate genes, and sequenced four additional malignant meningiomas. RESULTS: From exome sequencing data, we identified several frequently mutated  genes including NF2, MN1, ARID1B, SEMA4D, and MUC2, with private mutations in  tumors. We sequenced these genes in four additional samples and identified  potential driver mutations in NF2 (neurofibromatosis type 2) and MN1 (meningioma  1). CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that mutations in NF2 may play a role in progression  of meningiomas, and nominated MN1 as a candidate gene for malignant  transformation of meningiomas. Our sample size is limited by the extreme rarity  of malignant meningiomas, but our study represents one of the first sequencing  studies focusing on the malignant subtype.

Erratum in     PLoS One. 2015 Mar 17;10(3):e0119975. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0119975.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the most common tumor predisposition disorder  affecting 1/3500 worldwide. Patients are at risk of developing benign  (neurofibromas) and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). The AXL  receptor tyrosine kinase has been implicated in several kinds of cancers, but so  far no studies have investigated the role of AXL in NF1 related tumorigenesis.  Recently, the soluble fraction from the extracellular domain of AXL (sAXL) has  been found in human plasma, and its level was correlated to poor prognosis in  patients with renal cancer. Compared to normal human Schwann cells, a  significantly high expression level of AXL was found in three of the four MPNST  cell lines and two of the three primary MPNST tissues. Similarly, the level of  sAXL in conditioned media corresponded to the protein and mRNA levels of AXL in  the MPNST cell lines. Furthermore, in two different human MPNST xenograft  models, the human sAXL could be detected in the mouse plasma. Its level was  proportionate to the size of the xenograft tumors, while no human sAXL was  detect prior to the formation of the tumors. Treatment with a newly developed  photodynamic therapy, prevented further tumor growth and resulted in drastically  reduced the levels of sAXL compared to that of the control group. Finally, the  level of sAXL was significantly increased in patients with plexiform tumors  compared to patients with only dermal neurofibromas, further supporting the role  of sAXL as a marker for NF1 related tumor burden.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of patient and facility level factors on the  success of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in patients with  neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1). DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Large PGD reference laboratory. PATIENT(S): All patients with NF1 referred from June 2004 to May 2013. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Embryos' NF1 mutation status and live birth rates. RESULT(S): Seventy-seven couples underwent 156 PGD cycles during the study  period. The average maternal age at the time of embryo biopsy was 33.2 years.  The majority of embryos had a day 3 single blastomere biopsy without aneuploidy  screening. A diagnosis was obtained for 80% of biopsied embryos; 20% of biopsies  were nondiagnostic due to technical failures. Diagnosis was more often obtained  for embryos of parents with familial disease and for embryos biopsied at centers  that referred multiple NF1 cases. Among diagnosed embryos, 483/1,060 (46%) were  unaffected by the parental NF1 mutation. Twenty-two (14%) of the 156 cycles had  a confirmed live birth; if the observed success rate is applied to cycles with  unknown outcomes, 33/156 (21%) cycles are expected to have resulted in live  birth. In multivariate logistic regression, having a live birth was  significantly associated with having more unaffected embryos available for  transfer (odds ratio 1.33 per additional embryo, 95% confidence interval  1.02-1.72). CONCLUSION(S): Advances in biopsy and diagnostic techniques which increase the  number of unaffected embryos identified may improve live birth rates for  patients with NF1. Clinicians should counsel patients about their fertility and  reproductive options early, with the use of disease-specific data, to set  appropriate expectations for the PGD process.

Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized  by the development of multiple tumors in the central nervous system, most  notably schwannomas and meningiomas. Mutational inactivation of NF2 is found in  40-60% of sporadic meningiomas, but the molecular mechanisms underlying  malignant changes of meningioma cells remain unclear. Because group I  p21-activated kinases (Paks) bind to and are inhibited by the NF2-encoded  protein Merlin, we assessed the signaling and anti-tumor effects of three  group-I specific Pak inhibitors - Frax597, 716 and 1036 - in NF2-/- meningiomas  in vitro and in an orthotopic mouse model. We found that these Pak inhibitors  suppressed the proliferation and motility of both benign (Ben-Men1) and  malignant (KT21-MG1) meningiomas cells. In addition, we found a strong reduction  in phosphorylation of Mek and S6, and decreased cyclin D1 expression in both  cell lines after treatment with Pak inhibitors. Using intracranial xenografts of  luciferase-expressing KT21-MG1 cells, we found that treated mice showed  significant tumor suppression for all three Pak inhibitors. Similar effects were  observed in Ben-Men1 cells. Tumors dissected from treated animals exhibited an  increase in apoptosis without notable change in proliferation. Collectively,  these results suggest that Pak inhibitors might be useful agents in treating  NF2-deficient meningiomas.

Aberrant fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) signaling disrupts  chondrocyte proliferation and growth plate size and architecture, leading to  various chondrodysplasias or bone overgrowth. These observations suggest that  the duration, intensity and cellular context of FGFR signaling during growth  plate chondrocyte maturation require tight, regulated control for proper bone  elongation. However, the machinery fine-tuning FGFR signaling in chondrocytes is  incompletely defined. We report here that neurofibromin, a Ras-GAP encoded by  Nf1, has an overlapping expression pattern with FGFR1 and FGFR3 in  prehypertrophic chondrocytes, and with FGFR1 in hypertrophic chondrocytes during  endochondral ossification. Based on previous evidence that neurofibromin  inhibits Ras-ERK signaling in chondrocytes and phenotypic analogies between mice  with constitutive FGFR1 activation and Nf1 deficiency in Col2a1-positive  chondrocytes, we asked whether neurofibromin is required to control  FGFR1-Ras-ERK signaling in maturing chondrocytes in vivo. Genetic Nf1 ablation  in Fgfr1-deficient chondrocytes reactivated Ras-ERK1/2 signaling in hypertrophic  chondrocytes and reversed the expansion of the hypertrophic zone observed in  mice lacking Fgfr1 in Col2a1-positive chondrocytes. Histomorphometric and gene  expression analyses suggested that neurofibromin, by inhibiting Rankl  expression, attenuates pro-osteoclastogenic FGFR1 signaling in hypertrophic  chondrocytes. We also provide evidence suggesting that neurofibromin in  prehypertrophic chondrocytes, downstream of FGFRs and via an indirect mechanism,  is required for normal extension and organization of proliferative columns.  Collectively, this study indicates that FGFR signaling provides an important  input into the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK1/2 signaling axis in chondrocytes, and that this  input is differentially regulated during chondrocyte maturation by a complex  intracellular machinery, of which neurofibromin is a critical component.  © The Author 2015.

Author information: (1)Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Utah Medical Center, Salt Lake  City 84132.  To better map the location of the von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1)  gene, we have characterized a somatic cell hybrid designated 7AE-11. This  microcell-mediated, chromosome-transfer construct harbors a centromeric segment  and a neo-marked segment from the distal long arm of human chromosome 17. We  have identified 269 cosmid clones with human sequences from a 7AE-11 library  and, using a panel of somatic cell hybrids with a total of six chromosome 17q  breakpoints, have mapped 240 of these clones on chromosome 17q. The panel  included a hybrid (NF13) carrying a der(22) chromosome that was isolated from an  NF1 patient with a balanced translocation, t(17;22) (q11.2;q11.2). Fifty-three  of the cosmids map into a region spanning the NF13 breakpoint, as defined by the  two closest flanking breakpoints (17q11.2 and 17q11.2-q12). RFLP clones from a  subset of these cosmids have been mapped by linkage analysis in normal reference  families, to localize the NF1 gene more precisely and to enhance the potential  for genetic diagnosis of this disorder. The cosmids in the NF1 region will be an  important resource for testing DNA blots of large-fragment restriction-enzyme  digests from NF1 patient cell lines, to detect rearrangements in patients' DNA  and to identify the 17;22 NF1 translocation breakpoint.

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by  mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2. TSC has high frequency of osseous  manifestations such as sclerotic lesions in the craniofacial region. However, an  animal model that replicates TSC craniofacial bone lesions has not yet been  described. The roles of Tsc1 and the sequelae of Tsc1 dysfunction in bone are  unknown. In this study, we generated a mouse model of TSC with a deletion of  Tsc1 in neural crest-derived (NCD) cells that recapitulated the sclerotic  craniofacial bone lesions in TSC. Analysis of this mouse model demonstrated that  TSC1 deletion led to enhanced mTORC1 signaling in NCD bones and the increase in  bone formation is responsible for the aberrantly increased bone mass. Lineage  mapping revealed that TSC1 deficient NCD cells overpopulated the NCD bones.  Mechanistically, hyperproliferation of osteoprogenitors at an early postnatal  stage accounts for the increased osteoblast pool. Intriguingly, early postnatal  treatment with rapamycin, an mTORC1 inhibitor, can completely rescue the  aberrant bone mass, but late treatment cannot. Our data suggest that enhanced  mTOR signaling in NCD cells can increase bone mass through enlargement of the  osteoprogenitor pool, which likely explains the sclerotic bone lesion observed  in TSC patients.  © 2015 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

Dilwali S(1), Roberts D, Stankovic KM.  Author information: (1)a Eaton Peabody Laboratories and Department of Otolaryngology; Massachusetts  Eye & Ear Infirmary ; Boston , MA USA.  Vestibular schwannoma (VS), the fourth most common intracranial tumor, arises  from the Schwann cells of the vestibular nerve. Although several pathways have  been independently implicated in VS pathobiology, interactions among these  pathways have not been explored in depth. We have investigated the potential  cross-talk between hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and vascular endothelial  growth factor-A (VEGF-A) in human VS, an interaction that has been described in  other physiological and pathological cell types. We affirmed previous findings  that VEGF-A signaling is aberrantly upregulated in VS, and established that  expression of HGF and its receptor cMET is also significantly higher in sporadic  VS than in healthy nerves. In primary human VS and Schwann cell cultures, we  found that VEGF-A and HGF signaling pathways modulate each other. siRNAs  targeting cMET decreased both cMET and VEGF-A protein levels, and siRNAs  targeting VEGF-A reduced cMET expression. Additionally, siRNA-mediated knockdown  of VEGF-A or cMET and pharmacologic inhibition of cMET decreased cellular  proliferation in primary human VS cultures. Our data suggest cross-talk between  these 2 prominent pathways in VS and highlight the HGF/cMET pathway as an  additional important therapeutic target in VS.

BACKGROUND: The major clinical challenge in the treatment of high-grade serous  ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the development of progressive resistance to  platinum-based chemotherapy. The objective of this study was to determine  whether intra-tumour genetic heterogeneity resulting from clonal evolution and  the emergence of subclonal tumour populations in HGSOC was associated with the  development of resistant disease. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Evolutionary inference and phylogenetic quantification of  heterogeneity was performed using the MEDICC algorithm on high-resolution whole  genome copy number profiles and selected genome-wide sequencing of 135 spatially  and temporally separated samples from 14 patients with HGSOC who received  platinum-based chemotherapy. Samples were obtained from the clinical  CTCR-OV03/04 studies, and patients were enrolled between 20 July 2007 and 22  October 2009. Median follow-up of the cohort was 31 mo (interquartile range  22-46 mo), censored after 26 October 2013. Outcome measures were overall  survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). There were marked differences  in the degree of clonal expansion (CE) between patients (median 0.74,  interquartile range 0.66-1.15), and dichotimization by median CE showed worse  survival in CE-high cases (PFS 12.7 versus 10.1 mo, p = 0.009; OS 42.6 versus  23.5 mo, p = 0.003). Bootstrap analysis with resampling showed that the 95%  confidence intervals for the hazard ratios for PFS and OS in the CE-high group  were greater than 1.0. These data support a relationship between heterogeneity  and survival but do not precisely determine its effect size. Relapsed tissue was  available for two patients in the CE-high group, and phylogenetic analysis  showed that the prevalent clonal population at clinical recurrence arose from  early divergence events. A subclonal population marked by a NF1 deletion showed  a progressive increase in tumour allele fraction during chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that quantitative measures of intra-tumour  heterogeneity may have predictive value for survival after chemotherapy  treatment in HGSOC. Subclonal tumour populations are present in pre-treatment  biopsies in HGSOC and can undergo expansion during chemotherapy, causing  clinical relapse.

Author information: (1)Department of Medical Information, University of Utah School of Medicine,  Salt Lake City 84108.  A total of 15 polymorphic markers were used to construct a genetic map that  encompasses the NF1 locus on chromosome 17. The markers were a subset of a large  collection of chromosome 17-specific probes and were selected for marker typing  in NF1 families after physical localization to the pericentric region of the  chromosome. Multilocus data for a total of 17 informative NF1 families and 39  other families were included in genetic analyses. No recombination was observed  between NF1 and four markers, one or more of which was informative in 86% of  parents. More-refined physical mapping studies demonstrated that all four of the  markers are proximal to the chromosome 17 translocation breakpoints from two NF1  patients bearing balanced translocations. The region flanking the disease locus  spans a distance of 1 centimorgan (cM) in males and 9 cM in females. Close  flanking markers were informative in 76% of meioses. Sex differences in  recombination rates in the pericentric region were highly significant  statistically.  PMCID: PMC1683433 PMID: 2573276 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",False,Genetic mapping study

Author information: (1)Fourth Department of Neurosurgery, Cangzhou Central Hospital, Cangzhou,  061001, China, liu_yc007@hotmail.com.  The activation of proline-rich phosphoprotein Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1)  possesses a possible link between stem/progenitor cells, organ size, and cancer.  YAP1 has been indicated as an oncoprotein, and overexpression of YAP1 is  reported in many human brain tumors, including infiltrating gliomas. During  normal brain development, the neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) protein suppresses YAP1  activity in neural progenitor cells to promote guidepost cell differentiation,  but loss of NF2 causes elevating YAP1 activity in midline neural progenitors,  which disrupts guidepost formation. Overexpression of endogenous CD44 (cancer  stem cell marker) promotes phosphorylation/inactivation of NF2, and upregulates  YAP1 expression and leads to cancer cell resistance in glioblastoma. The hippo  pathway is also related to the YAP1 action. However, the mechanism of YAP1  action in glioma is still far from clear understanding. Advances in clinical  management based on an improved understanding of the function of YAP1 may help  to serve as a molecular target in glioma therapeutics. Knockdown of YAP1 by  shRNA technology has been shown to reduce glioma in vitro; however, clinical  implications are still under investigation. YAP1 can be used as a diagnostic  marker for gliomas to monitor the disease status and may help to evaluate its  treatment effects.

The availability of adult malignant glioma stem cells (GSCs) has provided  unprecedented opportunities to identify the mechanisms underlying treatment  resistance. Unfortunately, there is a lack of comparable reagents for the study  of pediatric low-grade glioma (LGG). Leveraging a neurofibromatosis 1 (Nf1)  genetically engineered mouse LGG model, we report the isolation of CD133(+)  multi-potent low-grade glioma stem cells (LG-GSCs), which generate glioma-like  lesions histologically similar to the parent tumor following injection into  immunocompetent hosts. In addition, we demonstrate that these LG-GSCs harbor  selective resistance to currently employed conventional and biologically  targeted anti-cancer agents, which reflect the acquisition of new targetable  signaling pathway abnormalities. Using transcriptomic analysis to identify  additional molecular properties, we discovered that mouse and human LG-GSCs  harbor high levels of Abcg1 expression critical for protecting against  ER-stress-induced mouse LG-GSC apoptosis. Collectively, these findings establish  that LGG cancer stem cells have unique molecular and functional properties  relevant to brain cancer treatment.  Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant neurologic  condition characterized by significant clinical heterogeneity, ranging from  malignant cancers to cognitive deficits. Recent studies have begun to reveal  rare genotype-phenotype correlations, suggesting that the specific germline NF1  gene mutation may be one factor underlying disease heterogeneity. The purpose of  this study was to define the impact of the germline NF1 gene mutation on brain  neurofibromin function relevant to learning. Herein, we employ human NF1-patient  primary skin fibroblasts, induced pluripotent stem cells and derivative neural  progenitor cells (NPCs) to demonstrate that NF1 germline mutations have dramatic  effects on neurofibromin expression. Moreover, while all NF1-patient NPCs  exhibit increased RAS activation and reduced cyclic AMP generation, there was a  neurofibromin dose-dependent reduction in dopamine (DA) levels. Additionally, we  leveraged two complementary Nf1 genetically-engineered mouse strains in which  hippocampal-based learning and memory is DA-dependent to establish that neuronal  DA levels and signaling as well as mouse spatial learning are controlled in an  Nf1 gene dose-dependent manner. Collectively, this is the first demonstration  that different germline NF1 gene mutations differentially dictate neurofibromin  function in the brain.  © The Author 2015.

Author information: (1)Department of Molecular Biology, Graduated School of System Biology, College  of Natural Science, Pusan National University, Busan.  Although asbestos causes malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), rising from lung  mesothelium, the molecular mechanism has not been suggested until now. Extremely  low mutation rate in classical tumor suppressor genes (such as p53 and pRb) and  oncogenes (including Ras or myc) indicates that there would be MPM-specific  carcinogenesis pathway. To address this, we treated silica to mimic mesothelioma  carcinogenesis in mesothelioma and non-small cell lung cancer cell lines  (NSCLC). Treatment of silica induced p-Erk and Snail through RKIP reduction. In  addition, p53 and E-cadherin were decreased by silica-treatment. Elimination of  Snail restored p53 expression. We found that NF2 (frequently deleted in MPM)  inhibited Snail-mediated p53 suppression and was stabilized by RKIP.  Importantly, GN25, an inhibitor of p53-Snail interaction, induced p53 and  apoptosis. These results indicate that MPM can be induced by reduction of  RKIP/NF2, which suppresses p53 through Snail. Thus, the p53-Snail binding  inhibitor such as GN25 is a drug candidate for MPM.  DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.3543 PMCID: PMC4496341 PMID: 25823924 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",False,Molecular mechanism study

Therapeutic options are limited for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated  malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) and clinical trials using drug  agents have so far been unsuccessful. This lack of clinical success is likely  attributed to high levels of intratumoral molecular heterogeneity and variations  in signal transduction within MPNSTs. To better explore the variance of  malignant signaling properties within heterogeneous MPNSTs, four MPNST cell  lines (ST8814, S462, S1844.1, and S1507.2) were used. The data demonstrate that  small-molecule inhibition of the MET proto-oncogene and mTOR had variable  outcome when preventing wound healing, cell migration, and invasion, with the  S462 cells being highly resistant to both. Of interest, targeted inhibition of  the STAT3 transcription factor suppressed wound healing, cell migration,  invasion, and tumor formation in all four MPNST lines, which demonstrates that  unlike MET and mTOR, STAT3 functions as a common driver of tumorigenesis in  NF1-MPNSTs. Of clinical importance, STAT3 knockdown was sufficient to block the  expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)1α, HIF2α, and VEGF-A in all four  MPNST lines. Finally, the data demonstrate that wound healing, cell migration,  invasion, and tumor formation through STAT3 are highly dependent on HIF  signaling, where knockdown of HIF1α ablated these oncogenic facets of STAT3. IMPLICATIONS: This research reveals that aberrant STAT3 and HIF1a activity  drives tumor progression in MPNSTs, indicating that inhibition of the  STAT3/HIF1α/VEGF-A signaling axis is a viable treatment strategy.  ©2015 American Association for Cancer Research.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Individualized drug testing for tumors using a strategy  analogous to antibiotic tests for infectious diseases would be highly desirable  for personalized and individualized cancer care. METHODS: Primary cultures containing tumor and nontumor stromal cells were  utilized in a novel strategy to test drug responses with respect to both  efficacy and specificity. The strategy tested in this pilot study was  implemented using four primary cultures derived from plexiform neurofibromas.  Responses to two cytotoxic drugs (nilotinib and imatinib) were measured by  following dose-dependent changes in the proportions of tumor and nontumor cells,  determined by staining them with cell-type-specific antibodies. The viability of  the cultured cells and the cytotoxic effect of the drugs were also measured  using proliferation and cytotoxicity assays. RESULTS: The total number of cells decreased after the drug treatment, in  accordance with the observed reduction in proliferation and increased cytotoxic  effect upon incubation with the two anticancer drugs. The proportions of Schwann  cells and fibroblasts changed dose-dependently, although the patterns of change  varied between the tumor samples (from different sources) and between the two  drugs. The highly variable in vitro drug responses probably reflect the large  variations in the responses of tumors to therapies between individual patients  in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results suggest that the concept of assessing in  vitro drug responses using primary cultures is feasible, but demands the  extensive further development of an application for preclinical drug selection  and drug discovery.

Mesothelial cells are susceptible to asbestos fiber-induced cytotoxicity and on  longer time scales to transformation; the resulting mesothelioma is a highly  aggressive neoplasm that is considered as incurable at the present time Zucali  et al. (Cancer Treatment Reviews 37:543-558, 2011). Only few murine cell culture  models of immortalized mesothelial cells and mesothelioma cell lines exist to  date. We generated SV40-immortalized cell lines derived from wild-type (WT) and  neurofibromatosis 2 (merlin) heterozygote (Nf2+/-) mice, both on a commonly used  genetic background, C57Bl/6J. All immortalized mesothelial clones consistently  grow in DMEM supplemented with fetal bovine serum. Cells can be passaged for  more than 40 times without any signs of morphological changes or a decrease in  proliferation rate. The tumor suppressor gene NF2 is one of the most frequently  mutated genes in human mesothelioma, but its detailed function is still unknown.  Thus, these genotypically distinct cell lines likely relevant for malignant  mesothelioma formation are expected to serve as useful in vitro models, in  particular to compare with in vivo studies in mice of the same genotype.  Furthermore, we generated a novel murine mesothelioma cell line RN5 originating  from an Nf2+/- mouse subjected to repeated crocidolite exposure. RN5 cells are  highly tumorigenic.

Ratner N(1), Miller SJ(1).  Author information: (1)Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cancer and Blood  Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital, 3333 Burnet Avenue,  Cincinnati, Ohio 45229, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common genetic disorder that predisposes  affected individuals to tumours. The NF1 gene encodes a RAS GTPase-activating  protein called neurofibromin and is one of several genes that (when mutant)  affect RAS-MAPK signalling, causing related diseases collectively known as  RASopathies. Several RASopathies, beyond NF1, are cancer predisposition  syndromes. Somatic NF1 mutations also occur in 5-10% of human sporadic cancers  and may contribute to resistance to therapy. To highlight areas for  investigation in RASopathies and sporadic tumours with NF1 mutations, we  summarize current knowledge of NF1 disease, the NF1 gene and neurofibromin,  neurofibromin signalling pathways and recent developments in NF1 therapeutics.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1) is a complex neurogenetic disorder  characterised by the development of benign and malignant tumours of the  peripheral nerve sheath (MPNSTs). Whilst biallelic NF1 gene inactivation  contributes to benign tumour formation, additional cellular changes in gene  structure and/or expression are required to induce malignant transformation.  Although few molecular profiling studies have been performed on the process of  progression of pre-existing plexiform neurofibromas to MPNSTs, the integrated  analysis of copy number alterations (CNAs) and gene expression is likely to be  key to understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying NF1-MPNST  tumorigenesis. In a pilot study, we employed this approach to identify genes  differentially expressed between benign and malignant NF1 tumours. RESULTS: SPP1 (osteopontin) was the most differentially expressed gene (85-fold  increase in expression), compared to benign plexiform neurofibromas. Short  hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown of SPP1 in NF1-MPNST cells reduced tumour spheroid  size, wound healing and invasion in four different MPNST cell lines. Seventy-six  genes were found to exhibit concordance between CNA and gene expression level. CONCLUSIONS: Pathway analysis of these genes suggested that glutathione  metabolism and Wnt signalling may be specifically involved in NF1-MPNST  development. SPP1 is associated with malignant transformation in NF1-associated  MPNSTs and could prove to be an important target for therapeutic intervention.

BACKGROUND: In the last few years, the Non-negative Matrix Factorization ( NMF )  technique has gained a great interest among the Bioinformatics community, since  it is able to extract interpretable parts from high-dimensional datasets.  However, the computing time required to process large data matrices may become  impractical, even for a parallel application running on a multiprocessors  cluster. In this paper, we present NMF-mGPU, an efficient and easy-to-use  implementation of the NMF algorithm that takes advantage of the high computing  performance delivered by Graphics-Processing Units ( GPUs ). Driven by the  ever-growing demands from the video-games industry, graphics cards usually  provided in PCs and laptops have evolved from simple graphics-drawing platforms  into high-performance programmable systems that can be used as coprocessors for  linear-algebra operations. However, these devices may have a limited amount of  on-board memory, which is not considered by other NMF implementations on GPU. RESULTS: NMF-mGPU is based on CUDA ( Compute Unified Device Architecture ), the  NVIDIA's framework for GPU computing. On devices with low memory available,  large input matrices are blockwise transferred from the system's main memory to  the GPU's memory, and processed accordingly. In addition, NMF-mGPU has been  explicitly optimized for the different CUDA architectures. Finally, platforms  with multiple GPUs can be synchronized through MPI ( Message Passing Interface  ). In a four-GPU system, this implementation is about 120 times faster than a  single conventional processor, and more than four times faster than a single GPU  device (i.e., a super-linear speedup). CONCLUSIONS: Applications of GPUs in Bioinformatics are getting more and more  attention due to their outstanding performance when compared to traditional  processors. In addition, their relatively low price represents a highly  cost-effective alternative to conventional clusters. In life sciences, this  results in an excellent opportunity to facilitate the daily work of  bioinformaticians that are trying to extract biological meaning out of hundreds  of gigabytes of experimental information. NMF-mGPU can be used ""out of the box""  by researchers with little or no expertise in GPU programming in a variety of  platforms, such as PCs, laptops, or high-end GPU clusters.

Anderson DM(1), Spraggins JM, Rose KL, Schey KL.  Author information: (1)Department of Biochemistry, Mass Spectrometry Research Center, Vanderbilt  University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, 37232, USA.  The human optic nerve carries signals from the retina to the visual cortex of  the brain. Each optic nerve is comprised of approximately one million nerve  fibers that are organized into bundles of 800-1200 fibers surrounded by  connective tissue and supportive glial cells. Damage to the optic nerve  contributes to a number of blinding diseases including: glaucoma, neuromyelitis  optica, optic neuritis, and neurofibromatosis; however, the molecular mechanisms  of optic nerve damage and death are incompletely understood. Herein we present  high spatial resolution MALDI imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) analysis of lipids  and proteins to define the molecular anatomy of the human optic nerve. The  localization of a number of lipids was observed in discrete anatomical regions  corresponding to myelinated and unmyelinated nerve regions as well as to  supporting connective tissue, glial cells, and blood vessels. A protein fragment  from vimentin, a known intermediate filament marker for astrocytes, was observed  surrounding nerved fiber bundles in the lamina cribrosa region. S100B was also  found in supporting glial cell regions in the prelaminar region, and the  hemoglobin alpha subunit was observed in blood vessel areas. The molecular  anatomy of the optic nerve defined by MALDI IMS provides a firm foundation to  study biochemical changes in blinding human diseases.

Author information: (1)Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Medicine, University of Central  Florida, Orlando, FL, USA.  Merlin (Moesin-ezrin-radixin-like protein, also known as schwannomin) is a tumor  suppressor protein encoded by the neurofibromatosis type 2 gene NF2. Loss of  function mutations or deletions in NF2 cause neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), a  multiple tumor forming disease of the nervous system. NF2 is characterized by  the development of bilateral vestibular schwannomas. Patients with NF2 can also  develop schwannomas on other cranial and peripheral nerves, as well as  meningiomas and ependymomas. The only potential treatment is  surgery/radiosurgery, which often results in loss of function of the involved  nerve. There is an urgent need for chemotherapies that slow or eliminate tumors  and prevent their formation in NF2 patients. Interestingly NF2 mutations and  merlin inactivation also occur in spontaneous schwannomas and meningiomas, as  well as other types of cancer including mesothelioma, glioma multiforme, breast,  colorectal, skin, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, hepatic and prostate cancer.  Except for malignant mesotheliomas, the role of NF2 mutation or inactivation has  not received much attention in cancer, and NF2 might be relevant for prognosis  and future chemotherapeutic approaches. This review discusses the influence of  merlin loss of function in NF2-related tumors and common human cancers. We also  discuss the NF2 gene status and merlin signaling pathways affected in the  different tumor types and the molecular mechanisms that lead to tumorigenesis,  progression and pharmacological resistance.

INTRODUCTION: Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is an aggressive neoplasm causatively  associated with exposure to asbestos. MM is rarely responsive to conventional  cytotoxic drugs, and the outcome remains dismal. It is, therefore, necessary to  identify the signaling pathways that drive MM and to develop new therapeutics  specifically targeting the molecules involved. METHODS: We performed comprehensive RNA sequencing of 12 MM cell lines and four  clinical samples using so-called next-generation sequencers. RESULTS: We found 15 novel fusion transcripts including one derived from  chromosomal translocation between the large tumor suppressor 1 (LATS1) and  presenilin-1 (PSEN1) genes. LATS1 is one of the central players of the emerging  Hippo signaling pathway. The LATS1-PSEN1 fusion gene product lacked the ability  to phosphorylate yes-associated protein and to suppress the growth of a MM cell  line. The wild-type LATS1 allele was undetectable in this cell line, indicating  two-hit genetic inactivation of its tumor suppressor function. Using  pathway-targeted exon sequencing, we further identified a total of 11 somatic  mutations in four Hippo pathway genes (neurofibromatosis type 2 [NF2], LATS2,  RASSF1, and SAV1) in 35% (8 of 23) of clinical samples. Nuclear staining of  yes-associated protein was detected in 55% (24 of 44) of the clinical samples.  Expression and/or phosphorylation of the Hippo signaling proteins, RASSF1,  Merlin (NF2), LATS1, and LATS2, was frequently absent. CONCLUSIONS: The frequent alterations of Hippo pathway molecules found in this  study indicate the therapeutic feasibility of targeting this pathway in patients  with MM.

PMID:25909290,Expression alterations define unique molecular characteristics of spinal ependymomas.,"Expression alterations define unique molecular characteristics of spinal  ependymomas.  Lourdusamy A(1), Rahman R(1), Grundy RG(1).  Author information: (1)Children's Brain Tumour Research Centre, School of Medicine, Queen's Medical  Centre University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.  Ependymomas are glial tumors that originate in either intracranial or spinal  regions. Although tumors from different regions are histologically similar, they  are biologically distinct. We therefore sought to identify molecular  characteristics of spinal ependymomas (SEPN) in order to better understand the  disease biology of these tumors. Using gene expression profiles of 256 tumor  samples, we identified increased expression of 1,866 genes in SEPN when compared  to intracranial ependymomas. These genes are mainly related to  anterior/posterior pattern specification, response to oxidative stress, glial  cell differentiation, DNA repair, and PPAR signalling, and also significantly  enriched with cellular senescence genes (P = 5.5 × 10-03). In addition, a high  number of significantly down-regulated genes in SEPN are localized to chromosome  22 (81 genes from chr22: 43,325,255 - 135,720,974; FDR = 1.77 × 10-23 and 22  genes from chr22: 324,739 - 32,822,302; FDR = 2.07 × 10-09) including BRD1,  EP300, HDAC10, HIRA, HIC2, MKL1, and NF2. Evaluation of NF2 co-expressed genes  further confirms the enrichment of chromosome 22 regions. Finally, systematic  integration of chromosome 22 genes with interactome and NF2 co-expression data  identifies key candidate genes. Our results reveal unique molecular  characteristics of SEPN such as altered expression of cellular senescence and  chromosome 22 genes.

Although nullizygous loss of NF1 leads to myeloid malignancies,  haploinsufficient loss of NF1 (Nf1) has been shown to contribute to osteopenia  and osteoporosis which occurs in approximately 50% of neurofibromatosis type 1  (NF1) patients. Bone marrow mononuclear cells of haploinsufficient NF1 patients  and Nf1(+/-) mice exhibit increased osteoclastogenesis and accelerated bone  turnover; however, the culprit hematopoietic lineages responsible for  perpetuating these osteolytic manifestations have yet to be elucidated. Here we  demonstrate that conditional inactivation of a single Nf1 allele within the  myeloid progenitor cell population (Nf1-LysM) is necessary and sufficient to  promote multiple osteoclast gains-in-function, resulting in enhanced  osteoclastogenesis and accelerated osteoclast bone lytic activity in response to  proresorptive challenge in vivo. Surprisingly, mice conditionally Nf1  heterozygous in mature, terminally differentiated osteoclasts (Nf1-Ctsk) do not  exhibit any of these skeletal phenotypes, indicating a critical requirement for  Nf1 haploinsufficiency at a more primitive/progenitor stage of myeloid  development in perpetuating osteolytic activity. We further identified  p21Ras-dependent hyperphosphorylation of Pu.1 within the nucleus of Nf1  haploinsufficient myelomonocytic osteoclast precursors, providing a novel  therapeutic target for the potential treatment of NF1 associated osteolytic  manifestations.  © 2015 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

Cognitive impairments are a major clinical feature of the common neurogenetic  disease neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Previous studies have demonstrated that  increased neuronal inhibition underlies the learning deficits in NF1, however,  the molecular mechanism underlying this cell-type specificity has remained  unknown. Here, we identify an interneuron-specific attenuation of  hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) current as the cause  for increased inhibition in Nf1 mutants. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that  HCN1 is a novel NF1-interacting protein for which loss of NF1 results in a  concomitant increase of interneuron excitability. Furthermore, the HCN channel  agonist lamotrigine rescued the electrophysiological and cognitive deficits in  two independent Nf1 mouse models, thereby establishing the importance of HCN  channel dysfunction in NF1. Together, our results provide detailed mechanistic  insights into the pathophysiology of NF1-associated cognitive defects, and  identify a novel target for clinical drug development.

Brossier NM(1), Prechtl AM, Longo JF, Barnes S, Wilson LS, Byer SJ, Brosius SN,  Carroll SL.  Author information: (1)From the Departments of Cell Biology (NMB, SLC), Pathology (SJB, SNB, SLC),  and Pharmacology and Toxicology (SB, LSW) and the Medical Scientist Training  Program (NMB, SNB), University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama;  and Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of South  Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina (AMP, JFL, SLC).  Neurofibromin, the tumor suppressor encoded by the neurofibromatosis type 1  (NF1) gene, potentially suppresses the activation of H-Ras, N-Ras, and K-Ras.  However, it is not known whether these classic Ras proteins are hyperactivated  in NF1-null nerve sheath tumors, how they contribute to tumorigenesis, and what  signaling pathways mediate their effects. Here we show that H-Ras, N-Ras, and  K-Ras are coexpressed with their activators (guanine nucleotide exchange  factors) in neurofibromin-null malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST)  cells, and that all 3 Ras proteins are activated. Dominant negative (DN) H-Ras,  a pan-inhibitor of the classic Ras family, inhibited MPNST proliferation and  survival, but not migration. However, NF1-null MPNST cells were variably  dependent on individual Ras proteins. In some lines, ablation of H-Ras, N-Ras,  and/or K-Ras inhibited mitogenesis. In others, ablation of a single Ras protein  had no effect on proliferation; in these lines, ablation of a single Ras protein  resulted in compensatory increases in the activation and/or expression of other  Ras proteins. Using mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics, we identified 7  signaling networks affecting morphology, proliferation, and survival that are  regulated by DN H-Ras. Thus, neurofibromin loss activates multiple classic Ras  proteins that promote proliferation and survival by regulating several distinct  signaling cascades.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common, highly heritable  neuropsychiatric disorder with hyperactivity as one of the hallmarks. Aberrant  dopamine signaling is thought to be a major theme in ADHD, but how this relates  to the vast majority of ADHD candidate genes is illusive. Here we report a  Drosophila dopamine-related locomotor endophenotype that is shared by  pan-neuronal knockdown of orthologs of the ADHD-associated genes Dopamine  transporter (DAT1) and Latrophilin (LPHN3), and of a gene causing a monogenic  disorder with frequent ADHD comorbidity: Neurofibromin (NF1). The locomotor  signature was not found in control models and could be ameliorated by  methylphenidate, validating its relevance to symptoms of the disorder. The  Drosophila ADHD endophenotype can be further exploited in high throughput to  characterize the growing number of candidate genes. It represents an equally  useful outcome measure for testing chemical compounds to define novel treatment  options.

Erratum in     PLoS Genet. 2015 Jun 15;11(6):e1005327. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005327.  Imprinted genes are expressed from only one parental allele and heterozygous  loss involving the expressed allele is sufficient to produce complete loss of  protein expression. Genetic alterations are common in tumorigenesis but the role  of imprinted genes in this process is not well understood. In earlier work we  mutagenized mice heterozygous for the Neurofibromatosis I tumor suppressor gene  (NF1) to model radiotherapy-associated second malignant neoplasms that arise in  irradiated NF1 patients. Expression analysis of tumor cell lines established  from our mouse models identified Grb10 expression as widely absent. Grb10 is an  imprinted gene and polymorphism analysis of cell lines and primary tumors  demonstrates that the expressed allele is commonly lost in diverse Nf1 mutant  tumors arising in our mouse models. We performed functional studies to test  whether Grb10 restoration or loss alter fundamental features of the tumor  growth. Restoring Grb10 in Nf1 mutant tumors decreases proliferation, decreases  soft agar colony formation and downregulates Ras signaling. Conversely, Grb10  silencing in untransformed mouse embryo fibroblasts significantly increased cell  proliferation and increased Ras-GTP levels. Expression of a constitutively  activated MEK rescued tumor cells from Grb10-mediated reduction in colony  formation. These studies reveal that Grb10 loss can occur during in vivo  tumorigenesis, with a functional consequence in untransformed primary cells. In  tumors, Grb10 loss independently promotes Ras pathway hyperactivation, which  promotes hyperproliferation, an early feature of tumor development. In the  context of a robust Nf1 mutant mouse model of cancer this work identifies a  novel role for an imprinted gene in tumorigenesis.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by  mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene, which affect approximately 1 out of  3000 individuals. Patients with NF1 suffer from a range of malignant and  nonmalignant manifestations such as plexiform neurofibromas and skeletal  abnormalities. We previously demonstrated that Nf1 haploinsufficiency in  mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSPCs) results in impaired osteoblastic  differentiation, which may be associated with the skeletal manifestations in NF1  patients. Here we sought to further ascertain the role of Nf1 in modulating the  migration and adhesion of MSPCs of the Nf1 haploinsufficient (Nf1(+/-)) mice.  Nf1(+/-) MSPCs demonstrated increased nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio, increased  migration, and increased actin polymerization as compared to wild-type (WT)  MSPCs. Additionally, Nf1(+/-) MSPCs were noted to have significantly enhanced  cell adhesion to fibronectin with selective affinity for CH271 with an  overexpression of its complimentary receptor, CD49e. Nf1(+/-) MSPCs also showed  hyperactivation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) and mitogen activated  protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways when compared to WT MSPCs, which were  both significantly reduced in the presence of their pharmacologic inhibitors,  LY294002 and PD0325901, respectively. Collectively, our study suggests that both  PI3-K and MAPK signaling pathways play a significant role in enhanced migration  and adhesion of Nf1 haploinsufficient MSPCs.

The tumor suppressor Merlin/NF2 functions upstream of the core Hippo pathway  kinases Lats1/2 and Mst1/2, as well as the nuclear E3 ubiquitin ligase  CRL4(DCAF1). Numerous mutations of Merlin have been identified in  Neurofibromatosis type 2 and other cancer patients. Despite more than two  decades of research, the upstream regulator of Merlin in the Hippo pathway  remains unknown. Here we show by high-resolution crystal structures that the  Lats1/2-binding site on the Merlin FERM domain is physically blocked by Merlin's  auto-inhibitory tail. Angiomotin binding releases the auto-inhibition and  promotes Merlin's binding to Lats1/2. Phosphorylation of Ser518 outside the  Merlin's auto-inhibitory tail does not obviously alter Merlin's conformation,  but instead prevents angiomotin from binding and thus inhibits Hippo pathway  kinase activation. Cancer-causing mutations clustered in the angiomotin-binding  domain impair angiomotin-mediated Merlin activation. Our findings reveal that  angiomotin and Merlin respectively interface cortical actin filaments and core  kinases in Hippo signaling, and allow construction of a complete Hippo signaling  pathway.

Electronic address: marlan-hansen@uiowa.edu.  After nerve injury, Schwann cells (SCs) dedifferentiate, proliferate, and  support axon regrowth. If axons fail to regenerate, denervated SCs eventually  undergo apoptosis due, in part, to increased expression of the low-affinity  neurotrophin receptor, p75(NTR). Merlin is the protein product of the NF2 tumor  suppressor gene implicated in SC tumorigenesis. Here we explore the contribution  of merlin to SC responses to nerve injury. We find that merlin becomes  phosphorylated (growth permissive) in SCs following acute axotomy and following  gradual neural degeneration in a deafness model, temporally correlated with  increased p75(NTR) expression. p75(NTR) levels are elevated in P0SchΔ39-121  transgenic mice that harbor an Nf2 mutation in SCs relative to wild-type mice  before axotomy and remain elevated for a longer period of time following injury.  Replacement of wild-type, but not phospho-mimetic (S518D), merlin isoforms  suppresses p75(NTR) expression in primary human schwannoma cultures which  otherwise lack functional merlin. Despite elevated levels of p75(NTR), SC  apoptosis following axotomy is blunted in P0SchΔ39-121 mice relative to  wild-type mice suggesting that loss of functional merlin contributes to SC  resistance to apoptosis. Further, cultured SCs from mice with a  tamoxifen-inducible knock-out of Nf2 confirm that SCs lacking functional merlin  are less sensitive to p75(NTR)-mediated cell death. Taken together these results  point to a model whereby loss of axonal contact following nerve injury results  in merlin phosphorylation leading to increased p75(NTR) expression. Further,  they demonstrate that merlin facilitates p75(NTR)-mediated apoptosis in SCs  helping to explain how neoplastic SCs that lack functional merlin survive  long-term in the absence of axonal contact.

The accurate detection of low-allelic variants is still challenging,  particularly for the identification of somatic mosaicism, where matched control  sample is not available. High throughput sequencing, by the simultaneous and  independent analysis of thousands of different DNA fragments, might overcome  many of the limits of traditional methods, greatly increasing the sensitivity.  However, it is necessary to take into account the high number of false positives  that may arise due to the lack of matched control samples. Here, we applied deep  amplicon sequencing to the analysis of samples with known genotype and variant  allele fraction (VAF) followed by a tailored statistical analysis. This method  allowed to define a minimum value of VAF for detecting mosaic variants with high  accuracy. Then, we exploited the estimated VAF to select candidate alterations  in NF2 gene in 34 samples with unknown genotype (30 blood and 4 tumor DNAs),  demonstrating the suitability of our method. The strategy we propose optimizes  the use of deep amplicon sequencing for the identification of low abundance  variants. Moreover, our method can be applied to different high throughput  sequencing approaches to estimate the background noise and define the accuracy  of the experimental design.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients are predisposed to neurofibromas but the  driver(s) that contribute to neurofibroma formation are not fully understood. By  cross comparison of microarray gene lists on human neurofibroma-initiating cells  and developed neurofibroma Schwann cells (SCs) we identified RUNX1  overexpression in human neurofibroma initiation cells, suggesting RUNX1 might  relate to neurofibroma formation. Immunostaining confirmed RUNX1 protein  overexpression in human plexiform neurofibromas. Runx1 overexpression was  confirmed in mouse Schwann cell progenitors (SCPs) and mouse neurofibromas at  the messenger RNA and protein levels. Genetic inhibition of Runx1 expression by  small hairpin RNA or pharmacological inhibition of Runx1 function by a  Runx1/Cbfβ interaction inhibitor, Ro5-3335, decreased mouse neurofibroma sphere  number in vitro. Targeted genetic deletion of Runx1 in SCs and SCPs delayed  mouse neurofibroma formation in vivo. Mechanistically, loss of Nf1 increased  embryonic day 12.5 Runx1(+)/Blbp(+) progenitors that enable tumor formation.  These results suggest that Runx1 has an important role in Nf1 neurofibroma  initiation, and inhibition of RUNX1 function might provide a novel potential  therapeutic treatment strategy for neurofibroma patients.

SWI/SNF complexes use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to remodel chromatin. In  mammals they play a central role in regulating gene expression during  differentiation and proliferation. Mutations in SWI/SNF subunits are among the  most frequent gene alterations in cancer. The INI1/hSNF5/SMARCB1 subunit is  mutated in both malignant rhabdoid tumor, a highly aggressive childhood cancer,  and schwannomatosis, a tumor-predisposing syndrome characterized by mostly  benign tumors of the CNS. Here, we show that mutations in INI1 that cause  schwannomatosis target a hitherto unidentified N-terminal winged helix DNA  binding domain that is also present in the BAF45a/PHF10 subunit of the SWI/SNF  complex. The domain is structurally related to the SKI/SNO/DAC domain, which is  found in a number of metazoan chromatin-associated proteins.  Copyright © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

Author information: (1)*Department of Pathology †Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program ‡Department  of Medicine, Dermatology Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New  York, NY.  Desmoplastic melanoma (DM) is a rare variant of melanoma with distinct clinical,  histopathologic, and immunohistochemical features. Clinically, DM differs from  conventional melanoma by a higher propensity for local recurrence and less  frequent metastatic spread to regional lymph nodes. In its pure form, DM has a  distinct appearance displaying a low density of fusiform melanocytes in a  collagen-rich matrix. Whereas a number of mutations have been identified in  primary melanoma, including BRAF, NRAS, GNAQ, GNA11, and KIT, and the occurrence  of these mutations has been found to correlate to some extent with the  histopathologic features, anatomic site, and/or mode of sun exposure, no  distinct set of mutations has so far been reported for DM. To study the  potential association of neurofibromin (NF1) mutations with DM, we examined 15  desmoplastic and 20 non-DMs by next-generation sequencing. Mutations of the NF1  gene were found in 14 of 15 (93%) DMs and 4 of 20 (20%) non-DMs. The high  frequency of NF1 mutations in DMs suggests an important role for NF1 in the  biology of this type of melanoma.

Comment in     Pigment Cell Melanoma Res. 2016 Jan;29(1):4-5. doi: 10.1111/pcmr.12423.  ""Café-au-lait"" macules (CALMs) and overall skin hyperpigmentation are early  hallmarks of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). One of the most frequent monogenic  diseases, NF1 has subsequently been characterized with numerous benign Schwann  cell-derived tumors. It is well established that neurofibromin, the NF1 gene  product, is an antioncogene that down-regulates the RAS oncogene. In contrast,  the molecular mechanisms associated with alteration of skin pigmentation have  remained elusive. We have reassessed this issue by differentiating human  embryonic stem cells into melanocytes. In the present study, we demonstrate that  NF1 melanocytes reproduce the hyperpigmentation phenotype in vitro, and further  characterize the link between loss of heterozygosity and the typical CALMs that  appear over the general hyperpigmentation. Molecular mechanisms associated with  these pathological phenotypes correlate with an increased activity of  cAMP-mediated PKA and ERK1/2 signaling pathways, leading to overexpression of  the transcription factor MITF and of the melanogenic enzymes tyrosinase and  dopachrome tautomerase, all major players in melanogenesis. Finally, the  hyperpigmentation phenotype can be rescued using specific inhibitors of these  signaling pathways. These results open avenues for deciphering the pathological  mechanisms involved in pigmentation diseases, and provide a robust assay for the  development of new strategies for treating these diseases.

Defects in the rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog  (Ras)/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase and the phosphatidylinositol  3-kinase-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways are responsible  for several neurodevelopmental disorders. These disorders are an important cause  for intellectual disability; additional manifestations include autism spectrum  disorder, seizures, and brain malformations. Changes in synaptic function are  thought to underlie the neurological conditions associated with these syndromes.  We therefore studied morphology and in vivo synaptic transmission of the calyx  of Held synapse, a relay synapse in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body  (MNTB) of the auditory brainstem, in mouse models of tuberous sclerosis complex  (TSC), Fragile X syndrome (FXS), Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), and Costello  syndrome. Calyces from both Tsc1(+/-) and from Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mice showed  increased volume and surface area compared to wild-type (WT) controls. In  addition, in Fmr1 KO animals a larger fraction of calyces showed complex  morphology. In MNTB principal neurons of Nf1 (+/) (-) mice the average delay  between EPSPs and APs was slightly smaller compared to WT controls, which could  indicate an increased excitability. Otherwise, no obvious changes in synaptic  transmission, or short-term plasticity were observed during juxtacellular  recordings in any of the four lines. Our results in these four mutants thus  indicate that abnormalities of mTOR or Ras signaling do not necessarily result  in changes in in vivo synaptic transmission.

All  Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2)-associated meningiomas and ~60% of sporadic  meningiomas show loss of NF2 tumor suppressor protein. There are no effective  medical therapies for progressive and recurrent meningiomas. Our previous work  demonstrated aberrant activation of mTORC1 signaling that led to ongoing  clinical trials with rapamycin analogs for NF2 and sporadic meningioma patients.  Here we performed a high-throughput kinome screen to identify kinases  responsible for mTORC1 pathway activation in NF2-deficient meningioma cells.  Among the emerging top candidates were the mTORC2-specific target  serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) and p21-activated kinase 1  (PAK1). In NF2-deficient meningioma cells, inhibition of SGK1 rescues mTORC1  activation, and SGK1 activation is sensitive to dual mTORC1/2 inhibitor AZD2014,  but not to rapamycin. PAK1 inhibition also leads to attenuated mTORC1 but not  mTORC2 signaling, suggesting that mTORC2/SGK1 and Rac1/PAK1 pathways are  independently responsible for mTORC1 activation in NF2-deficient meningiomas.  Using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, we generated isogenic human arachnoidal cell  lines (ACs), the origin cell type for meningiomas, expressing or lacking NF2.  NF2-null CRISPR ACs recapitulate the signaling of NF2-deficient meningioma  cells. Interestingly, we observe increased SGK1 transcription and protein  expression in NF2-CRISPR ACs and in primary NF2-negative meningioma lines.  Moreover, we demonstrate that the dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitor, AZD2014 is  superior to rapamycin and PAK inhibitor FRAX597 in blocking proliferation of  meningioma cells. Importantly, AZD2014 is currently in use in several clinical  trials of cancer. Therefore, we believe that AZD2014 may provide therapeutic  advantage over rapalogs for recurrent and progressive meningiomas.

The tumour suppressor Merlin, encoded by the gene NF2, is frequently mutated in  the autosomal dominant disorder neurofibromatosis type II, characterised  primarily by the development of schwannoma and other glial cell tumours.  However, NF2 is expressed in virtually all analysed human and rodent organs, and  its deletion in mice causes early embryonic lethality. Additionally, NF2 encodes  for two major isoforms of Merlin of unknown functionality. Specifically, the  tumour suppressor potential of isoform 2 remains controversial. In this study,  we used Nf2 isoform-specific knockout mouse models to analyse the function of  each isoform during development and organ homeostasis. We found that both  isoforms carry full tumour suppressor functionality and can completely  compensate the loss of the other isoform during development and in most adult  organs. Surprisingly, we discovered that spermatogenesis is strictly dependent  on the presence of both isoforms. While the testis primarily expresses isoform  1, we noticed an enrichment of isoform 2 in spermatogonial stem cells. Deletion  of either isoform was found to cause decreased sperm quality as observed by  maturation defects and head/midpiece abnormalities. These defects led to  impaired sperm functionality as assessed by decreased sperm capacitation. Thus,  we describe spermatogenesis as a new Nf2-dependent process. Additionally, we  provide for the first time in vivo evidence for equal tumour suppressor  potentials of Merlin isoform 1 and isoform 2.

The NF2 gene product Merlin is a FERM-domain protein possessing a broad  tumor-suppressing function. NF2/Merlin has been implicated in regulating  multiple signaling pathways critical for cell growth and survival. However, it  remains unknown whether NF2/Merlin regulates Wnt/β-catenin signaling during  vertebrate embryogenesis. Here we demonstrate that NF2/Merlin is required for  body pattern formation in the Xenopus laevis embryo. Depletion of the maternal  NF2/Merlin enhances organizer gene expression dependent on the presence of  β-catenin, and causes dorsanteriorized development; Morpholino antisense  oligo-mediated knockdown of the zygotic NF2/Merlin shifts posterior genes  anteriorwards and reduces the anterior development. We further demonstrate that  targeted depletion of NF2 in the presumptive dorsal tissues increases the levels  of nuclear β-catenin in the neural epithelial cells. Biochemical analyses reveal  that NF2 depletion promotes the production of active β-catenin and concurrently  decreases the level of N-terminally phosphorylated β-catenin under the  stimulation of the endogenous Wnt signaling. Our findings suggest that  NF2/Merlin negatively regulates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity during the  pattern formation in early X. laevis embryos.  Copyright © 2015.

Ionizing radiation (IR) is a mutagen that promotes tumorigenesis in multiple  exposure contexts. One severe consequence of IR is the development of second  malignant neoplasms (SMNs), a radiotherapy-associated complication in survivors  of cancers, particularly pediatric cancers. SMN genomes are poorly  characterized, and the influence of genetic background on genotoxin-induced  mutations has not been examined. Using our mouse models of SMNs, we performed  whole exome sequencing of neoplasms induced by fractionated IR in wild-type and  Nf1 mutant mice. Using non-negative matrix factorization, we identified  mutational signatures that did not segregate by genetic background or histology.  Copy-number analysis revealed recurrent chromosomal alterations and differences  in copy number that were background dependent. Pathway analysis identified  enrichment of non-synonymous variants in genes responsible for cell assembly and  organization, cell morphology, and cell function and maintenance. In this model  system, ionizing radiation and Nf1 heterozygosity each exerted distinct  influences on the mutational landscape.  Copyright © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

PMID:26423696,How to Target Activated Ras Proteins: Direct Inhibition vs. Induced Mislocalization.,"How to Target Activated Ras Proteins: Direct Inhibition vs. Induced  Mislocalization.  Brock EJ, Ji K, Reiners JJ, Mattingly RR(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Pharmacology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, 540  East Canfield Ave, Detroit MI, USA. r.mattingly@wayne.edu.  Oncogenic Ras proteins are a driving force in a significant set of human cancers  and wildtype, unmutated Ras proteins likely contribute to the malignant  phenotype of many more. The overall challenge of targeting activated Ras  proteins has great promise to treat cancer, but this goal has yet to be  achieved. Significant efforts and resources have been committed to inhibiting  Ras, but these energies have so far made little impact in the clinic. Direct  attempts to target activated Ras proteins have faced many obstacles, including  the fundamental nature of the gain-of-function oncogenic activity being produced  by a loss-of-function at the biochemical level. Nevertheless, there has been  very promising recent pre-clinical progress. The major strategy that has so far  reached the clinic aimed to inhibit activated Ras indirectly through blocking  its post-translational modification and inducing its mislocalization. While  these efforts to indirectly target Ras through inhibition of farnesyl  transferase (FTase) were rationally designed, this strategy suffered from  insufficient attention to the distinctions between the isoforms of Ras. This led  to subsequent failures in large-scale clinical trials targeting K-Ras driven  lung, colon, and pancreatic cancers. Despite these setbacks, efforts to  indirectly target activated Ras through inducing its mislocalization have  persisted. It is plausible that FTase inhibitors may still have some utility in  the clinic, perhaps in combination with statins or other agents. Alternative  approaches for inducing mislocalization of Ras through disruption of its  palmitoylation cycle or interaction with chaperone proteins are in early stages  of development.

The multi-subunit mammalian Mediator complex acts as an integrator of  transcriptional regulation by RNA Polymerase II, and has emerged as a master  coordinator of development and cell fate determination. We previously identified  the Mediator subunit, MED28, as a cytosolic binding partner of merlin, the  Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor, and thus MED28 is distinct in having  a cytosolic role as an NF2 interacting protein as well as a nuclear role as a  Mediator complex subunit. Although limited in vitro studies have been performed  on MED28, its in vivo function remains unknown. Employing a knockout mouse  model, we describe for the first time the requirement for Med28 in the  developing mouse embryo. Med28-deficiency causes peri-implantation lethality  resulting from the loss of pluripotency of the inner cell mass accompanied by  reduced expression of key pluripotency transcription factors Oct4 and Nanog.  Further, overexpression of Med28 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts enhances the  efficiency of their reprogramming to pluripotency. Cre-mediated inactivation of  Med28 in induced pluripotent stem cells shows that Med28 is required for their  survival. Intriguingly, heterozygous loss of Med28 results in differentiation of  induced pluripotent stem cells into extraembryonic trophectoderm and primitive  endoderm lineages. Our findings document the essential role of Med28 in the  developing embryo as well as in acquisition and maintenance of pluripotency  during reprogramming.

BACKGROUND: Both the number and size of tumours in NF1 patients increase in  response to the rise in steroid hormones seen at puberty and during pregnancy.  The size of tumours decreases after delivery, suggesting that hormone-targeting  therapy might provide a viable new NF1 treatment approach. Our earlier studies  demonstrated that human NF1 tumour cell lines either went through apoptosis or  ceased growth in the presence of 2-methoxyoestradiol (2ME2), a naturally  occurring anticancer metabolite of 17-β estradiol. Previous reports of treatment  with sulfamoylated steroidal and non-steroidal derivatives of 2ME2 showed  promising reductions in tumour burden in hormone-responsive cancers other than  NF1. Here we present the first studies indicating that 2ME2 derivatives could  also provide an avenue for treating NF1, for which few treatment options are  available. METHODS: STX3451,  (2-(3-Bromo-4,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-7-methoxy-6-sulfamoyloxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline),  a non-steroidal sulphamate analogue of 2ME2, was tested in dose-dependent  studies of malignant and benign NF1 human tumour cell lines and cell lines with  variable controlled neurofibromin expression. The mechanisms of action of  STX3451 were also analysed. RESULTS: We found that STX3451-induced apoptosis in human malignant peripheral  nerve sheath tumour (MPNST) cell lines, even in the presence of elevated  oestrogen and progesterone. It inhibits both PI3 kinase and mTOR signalling  pathways. It disrupts actin- and microtubule-based cytoskeletal structures in  cell lines derived from human MPNSTs and in cells derived from benign plexiform  neurofibromas. STX3451 selectively kills MPNST-derived cells, but also halts  growth of other tumour-derived NF1 cell lines. CONCLUSION: STX3451 provides a new approach for inducing cell death and lowering  tumour burden in NF1 and other hormone-responsive cancers with limited treatment  options.

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a central regulator of a diverse  array of cellular processes, including cell growth, proliferation, autophagy,  translation, and actin polymerization. Components of the mTOR cascade are  present at synapses and influence synaptic plasticity and spine morphogenesis. A  prevailing view is that the study of mTOR and its role in autism spectrum  disorders (ASDs) will elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which mTOR regulates  neuronal function under physiological and pathological conditions. Although many  ASDs arise as a result of mutations in genes with multiple molecular functions,  they appear to converge on common biological pathways that give rise to  autism-relevant behaviors. Dysregulation of mTOR signaling has been identified  as a phenotypic feature common to fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis complex  1 and 2, neurofibromatosis 1, phosphatase and tensin homolog, and potentially  Rett syndrome. Below are a summary of topics covered in a symposium that  presents dysregulation of mTOR as a unifying theme in a subset of ASDs.  Copyright © 2015 the authors 0270-6474/15/3513836-07$15.00/0.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic condition caused  by dominant loss-of-function mutations of the tumor suppressor gene NF1 that  encodes neurofibromin, a negative regulator of RAS activity. Mutation analysis  of NF1 located at 17q11.2 has been hampered by the large size of the gene, the  high rate of new mutations, the lack of mutational clustering, and the presence  of several homologous loci. To date, about 80% of the reported NF1 mutations are  predicted to result in protein truncation, but very few studies have correlated  the causative NF1 mutation with its effect at the protein level. We evaluated a  novel diagnostic method to detect truncated forms of neurofibromin in a large  cohort of unrelated subjects suspected of having NF1, according to the NIH  consensus criteria. Western blot analysis was carried out on protein extracts  from patients' leukocytes to highlight the possible presence of altered  neurofibromin as a result of mutations in NF1. Truncated neurofibromin was  identified in 274/336 patients (81%), confirming the usefulness and  reproducibility of the proposed diagnostic approach. Our methodology can be  routinely applied in the diagnostic setting, thanks to its simplicity and  reliability. Combined with molecular approaches, it may increase the accuracy  and efficiency of NF1 genetic testing.

The proliferation of normal cells is inhibited at confluence, but the molecular  basis of this phenomenon, known as contact-dependent inhibition of  proliferation, is unclear. We previously identified the neurofibromatosis type 2  (NF2) tumor suppressor Merlin as a critical mediator of contact-dependent  inhibition of proliferation and specifically found that Merlin inhibits the  internalization of, and signaling from, the epidermal growth factor receptor  (EGFR) in response to cell contact. Merlin is closely related to the  membrane-cytoskeleton linking proteins Ezrin, Radixin, and Moesin, and  localization of Merlin to the cortical cytoskeleton is required for  contact-dependent regulation of EGFR. We show that Merlin and Ezrin are  essential components of a mechanism whereby mechanical forces associated with  the establishment of cell-cell junctions are transduced across the cell cortex  via the cortical actomyosin cytoskeleton to control the lateral mobility and  activity of EGFR, providing novel insight into how cells inhibit mitogenic  signaling in response to cell contact.  © 2015 Chiassson-MacKenzie et al.

Koliou X(1), Fedonidis C(1), Kalpachidou T(1), Mangoura D(1).  Author information: (1)Basic Research Center, Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of  Athens, Athens, Greece.  Comment in     J Neurochem. 2016 Jan;136(1):11-2. doi: 10.1111/jnc.13435.  Neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF-1) is caused by mutations in the tumor suppressor  gene NF1; its protein product neurofibromin is a RasGTPase-activating protein, a  property that has yet to explain aneuploidy, most often observed in astrocytes  in NF-1. Here, we provide a mechanistic model for the regulated nuclear import  of neurofibromin during the cell cycle and for a role in chromosome congression.  Specifically, we demonstrate that neurofibromin, phosphorylated on Ser2808, a  residue adjacent to a nuclear localization signal in the C-terminal domain  (CTD), by Protein Kinase C-epsilon (PKC-ε), accumulates in a Ran-dependent  manner and through binding to lamin in the nucleus at G2 in glioblastoma cells.  Furthermore, we identify CTD as a tubulin-binding domain and show that a  phosphomimetic substitution of its Ser2808 results in a predominantly nuclear  localization. Confocal analysis shows that endogenous neurofibromin localizes on  the centrosomes at interphase, as well as on the mitotic spindle, through direct  associations with tubulins, in glioblastoma cells and primary astrocytes. More  importantly, analysis of mitotic phenotypes after siRNA-mediated depletion shows  that acute loss of this tumor suppressor protein leads to aberrant chromosome  congression at the metaphase plate. Therefore, neurofibromin protein abundance  and nuclear import are mechanistically linked to an error-free chromosome  congression. Concerned with neurofibromin's, a tumor suppressor, mechanism of  action, we demonstrate in astrocytic cells that its synthesis, phosphorylation  by Protein Kinase C-ε on Ser2808 (a residue adjacent to a nuclear localization  sequence), and nuclear import are cell cycle-dependent, being maximal at G2.  During mitosis, neurofibromin is an integral part of the spindle, while its  depletion leads to aberrant chromosome congression, possibly explaining the  development of chromosomal instability in Neurofibromatosis type-1.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common human hereditary  disorders, predisposing individuals to the development of benign and malignant  tumors in the nervous system, as well as other clinical manifestations. NF1 is  caused by heterozygous mutations in the NF1 gene and around 25% of the  pathogenic changes affect pre-mRNA splicing. Since the molecular mechanisms  affected by these mutations are poorly understood, we have analyzed the splicing  mutations identified in exon 9 of NF1, which is particularly prone to such  changes, to better define the possible splicing regulatory elements. Using a  minigene approach, we studied the effect of five splicing mutations in this exon  described in patients. These highlighted three regulatory motifs within the  exon. An in vivo splicing analysis of an extensive collection of changes  generated in the minigene demonstrated that the CG motif at c.910-911 is  critical for the recognition of exon 9. We also found that the GC motif at  c.945-946 is involved in exon recognition through SRSF2 and that this motif is  part of a Composite Exon Splicing Regulatory Element made up of physically  overlapping enhancer and silencer elements. Finally, through an in vivo splicing  analysis and in vitro binding assays, we demonstrated that the c.1007G>A  mutation creates an Exonic Splicing Silencer element that binds the hnRNPA1  protein. The complexity of the splicing regulatory elements present in exon 9 is  most likely responsible for the fact that mutations in this region represent 25%  of all exonic changes that affect splicing in the NF1 gene.

Human malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are highly aggressive  soft-tissue sarcomas with a poor prognosis that arise either in the context of  neurofibromatosis 1 or sporadically. Inbred BDIX and BDIV rat strains highly  susceptible and resistant, respectively, to the development of  ethylnitrosourea-induced MPNST enable us to identify, by using methods not  applicable in humans, variant alleles involved in the pathways underlying  individual MPNST risk. On the basis of a genome-wide association analysis using  reciprocal intercrosses of BDIX and BDIV, BDIV alleles of two loci on chromosome  10, Mss1 and Mss7, were predicted to lower the risk of MPNST, the latter locus  with a female bias. In this study we confirm the two nonoverlapping loci by  exposing two congenic strains, BDIX.BDIV-Mss1 (Mss1) and BDIX.BDIV-Mss7 (Mss7),  each carrying a BDIV genomic segment spanning the respective locus, to  ethylnitrosourea. Compared with BDIX rats, the rate of MPNST is reduced 6.2-fold  and 2.0-fold for Mss1 and Mss7 rats of both sexes, respectively. Although a  moderate gain of survival time (30-50 days) is seen in Mss1 rats of both sexes  and Mss7 males, Mss7 females survive 134 days longer than BDIX females. BDIV  alleles at Mss7 obviously cause a markedly increased intrastrain sex difference  regarding survival time in Mss7 compared with BDIX rats. Fine mapping will lead  to the identification of allelic variants modulating rat MPNST risk and  subsequently to their human counterparts. This is of particular relevance,  because so far neither gene nor anonymous sequence variants have been identified  that influence the risk of human sporadic Schwann cell malignancy.

Though evidence is mounting that a major function of sleep is to maintain brain  plasticity and consolidate memory, little is known about the molecular pathways  by which learning and sleep processes intercept. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase  (Alk), the gene encoding a tyrosine receptor kinase whose inadvertent activation  is the cause of many cancers, is implicated in synapse formation and cognitive  functions. In particular, Alk genetically interacts with Neurofibromatosis 1  (Nf1) to regulate growth and associative learning in flies. We show that Alk  mutants have increased sleep. Using a targeted RNAi screen we localized the  negative effects of Alk on sleep to the mushroom body, a structure important for  both sleep and memory. We also report that mutations in Nf1 produce a sexually  dimorphic short sleep phenotype, and suppress the long sleep phenotype of Alk.  Thus Alk and Nf1 interact in both learning and sleep regulation, highlighting a  common pathway in these two processes.

Merlin has broad tumor-suppressor functions as its mutations have been  identified in multiple benign tumors and malignant cancers. In all schwannomas,  the majority of meningiomas and 1/3 of ependymomas Merlin loss is causative. In  neurofibromatosis type 2, a dominantly inherited tumor disease because of the  loss of Merlin, patients suffer from multiple nervous system tumors and die on  average around age 40. Chemotherapy is not effective and tumor localization and  multiplicity make surgery and radiosurgery challenging and morbidity is often  considerable. Thus, a new therapeutic approach is needed for these tumors. Using  a primary human in vitro model for Merlin-deficient tumors, we report that the  Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein, extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase  (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) scaffold, kinase suppressor of  Ras 1 (KSR1), has a vital role in promoting schwannomas development. We show  that KSR1 overexpression is involved in many pathological phenotypes caused by  Merlin loss, namely multipolar morphology, enhanced cell-matrix adhesion, focal  adhesion and, most importantly, increased proliferation and survival. Our data  demonstrate that KSR1 has a wider role than MEK1/2 in the development of  schwannomas because adhesion is more dependent on KSR1 than MEK1/2.  Immunoprecipitation analysis reveals that KSR1 is a novel binding partner of  Merlin, which suppresses KSR1's function by inhibiting the binding between KSR1  and c-Raf. Our proteomic analysis also demonstrates that KSR1 interacts with  several Merlin downstream effectors, including E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4(DCAF1).  Further functional studies suggests that KSR1 and DCAF1 may co-operate to  regulate schwannomas formation. Taken together, these findings suggest that KSR1  serves as a potential therapeutic target for Merlin-deficient tumors.

Hearing loss is the main limitation of radiation therapy for vestibular  schwannoma (VS), and identifying treatment options that minimize hearing loss  are urgently needed. Treatment with bevacizumab is associated with tumor control  and hearing improvement in neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) patients; however, its  effect is not durable and its mechanism of action on nerve function is unknown.  We modeled the effect anti-VEGF therapy on neurological function in the sciatic  nerve model and found that it improves neurological function by alleviating  tumor edema, which may further improve results by decreasing muscle atrophy and  increasing nerve regeneration. Using a cranial window model, we showed that  anti-VEGF treatment may achieve these effects via normalizing the tumor  vasculature, improving vessel perfusion, and delivery of oxygenation. It is  known that oxygen is a potent radiosensitizer; therefore, we further  demonstrated that combining anti-VEGF with radiation therapy can achieve a  better tumor control and help lower the radiation dose and, thus, minimize  radiation-related neurological toxicity. Our results provide compelling  rationale for testing combined therapy in human VS.

(2)Department of Neurology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf,  Hamburg, Germany.  AIMS: To develop an in vitro tool for assessing the efficacy and toxicity of  anticancer drugs using mixed culture containing both tumor and non-tumor cells.  Such in vitro tool should have high application potential in drug-screening and  personalized cancer care. METHODS: Fibroblasts were spiked as non-tumor cells into tumor cells of an  established line. The mixed culture was treated with a test drug at various  concentrations. After the treatment, DNA was prepared directly from the survived  adhesive cells in the wells of the 96-well plates using a simple and inexpensive  method, and subjected to digital PCR for measuring relative copy numbers of a  target gene NF1 to that of a reference gene RPP30. The NF1 gene is known to be  heterozygously deleted in these tumor cells while the RPP30 gene has two copies  in both tumor and non-tumor cells. Using the NF1/ RPP30 ratios resulting from  the dual digital PCR assay, the proportions of tumor cells were calculated for  each drug concentration. RESULTS: Digital PCR confirmed that the tumor cells have only one copy of the  NF1 gene while the non-tumor fibroblasts have two copies. By contrast, both  types of cells have two copies of the reference gene RPP30. Using the ratio of  the two genes, we successfully calculated the proportion of tumor cells which  decreased as the dose of the test drug increased up to a certain concentration,  indicating that the drug is more effective for the tumor cells than for the  non-tumor cells in this dose-range. At the highest dose, we observed a slight  increase in the proportion of tumor cells, likely reflecting the toxic effect of  the drug on both tumor and non-tumor cells. CONCLUSION: This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of a genetic- and  cell-based tool for testing efficacy and toxicity of anticancer drugs in vitro.  The promising results suggest that additional efforts are merited, for further  development since such a tool will likely have high application potential (1) in  drug discovery where it enables simultaneously assessing therapeutic effect on  target cells and toxic effect on non-target cells, and (2) in personalized  adjuvant chemotherapy where multiple drugs can be tested in primary cultures  derived from surgically removed tumor.

PMID:26585554,Loss of H3K27 trimethylation distinguishes malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors from histologic mimics.,"Loss of H3K27 trimethylation distinguishes malignant peripheral nerve sheath  tumors from histologic mimics.  Schaefer IM(1), Fletcher CD(1), Hornick JL(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical  School, Boston, MA, USA.  The diagnosis of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor is challenging,  particularly in the sporadic setting. Inactivation of the polycomb repressive  complex 2 (PRC2), resulting from inactivating mutations of its constituents  SUZ12 or EED1, has recently been identified in 70-90% of malignant peripheral  nerve sheath tumors. Homozygous PRC2 inactivation results in loss of histone  H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). PRC2 inactivation promotes tumor progression  and may render patients sensitive to epigenetic-based targeted therapies.  H3K27me3 loss has not yet been validated as a diagnostic marker. We evaluated  immunohistochemistry for H3K27me3 in 100 malignant peripheral nerve sheath  tumors (70 sporadic, 10 neurofibromatosis type 1-associated, 10  radiation-associated, 10 epithelioid) and 200 other spindle cell neoplasms  representing potential mimics (20 each monophasic synovial sarcoma,  leiomyosarcoma, dedifferentiated liposarcoma, malignant solitary fibrous tumor,  low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma, cellular schwannoma, spindle cell melanoma,  unclassified postradiation sarcoma; 10 each atypical neurofibroma, spindle cell  rhabdomyosarcoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, fibrosarcomatous  dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans). In total, 51 (51%) malignant peripheral nerve  sheath tumors, including 34 (49%) sporadic, 7 (70%) neurofibromatosis type  1-associated, and 10 (100%) radiation-associated, but no epithelioid malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumors, were negative for H3K27me3. An additional 6 (6%)  tumors showed heterogeneous H3K27me3 expression. Among the 90 sporadic,  neurofibromatosis type 1-associated, and radiation-associated malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumors, complete H3K27me3 loss was observed in 29% of  low-grade, 59% of intermediate-grade, and 83% of high-grade tumors (low vs  intermediate/high grade, P=0.0003). Among other tumor types, 4 (20%)  unclassified postradiation sarcomas were negative for H3K27me3, whereas all  other neoplasms were positive. Loss of H3K27me3 is highly specific for malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumor (although only modestly more sensitive than S-100  protein and SOX10) and may be a useful diagnostic marker. Our findings suggest  that PRC2 inactivation in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor may occur  during progression to higher grades.

Constitutional heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the SPRED1 gene cause  a phenotype known as Legius syndrome, which consists of symptoms of multiple  café-au-lait macules, axillary freckling, learning disabilities, and  macrocephaly. Legius syndrome resembles a mild neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)  phenotype. It has been demonstrated that SPRED1 functions as a negative  regulator of the Ras-ERK pathway and interacts with neurofibromin, the NF1 gene  product. However, the molecular details of this interaction and the effects of  the mutations identified in Legius syndrome and NF1 on this interaction have not  yet been investigated. In this study, using a yeast two-hybrid system and an  immunoprecipitation assay in HEK293 cells, we found that the SPRED1 EVH1 domain  interacts with the N-terminal 16 amino acids and the C-terminal 20 amino acids  of the GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-related domain (GRD) of neurofibromin,  which form two crossing α-helix coils outside the GAP domain. These regions have  been shown to be dispensable for GAP activity and are not present in p120(GAP).  Several mutations in these N- and C-terminal regions of the GRD in NF1 patients  and pathogenic missense mutations in the EVH1 domain of SPRED1 in Legius  syndrome reduced the binding affinity between the EVH1 domain and the GRD. EVH1  domain mutations with reduced binding to the GRD also disrupted the ERK  suppression activity of SPRED1. These data clearly demonstrate that SPRED1  inhibits the Ras-ERK pathway by recruiting neurofibromin to Ras through the  EVH1-GRD interaction, and this study also provides molecular basis for the  pathogenic mutations of NF1 and Legius syndrome.  © 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

Most malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) exhibit combined  inactivation of NF1, CDKN2A, and polycomb repressive complex 2 component genes  (Embryonic Ectoderm Development [EED] and Suppressor of Zeste 12 [SUZ12]).  Mutations in EED and SUZ12 induce loss of trimethylation at lysine 27 of histone  3 (H3K27me3), with subsequent aberrant transcriptional activation of polycomb  repressive complex 2-repressed homeobox master regulators. These findings  prompted us to investigate the performance of an anti-H3K27me3 monoclonal  antibody clone C36B11 as an immunohistochemical marker for MPNSTs. We assessed  the C36B11 reactivity pattern in a pathologically and genetically  well-characterized cohort of 68 MPNSTs, spanning various clinical presentations,  such as type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF1), radiotherapy, and sporadic MPNSTs. We  found that 69% (n=47) of all MPNSTs demonstrated loss of H3K27me3 expression,  with 42 (61%) showing complete loss and 5 (7%) showing partial loss, whereas 31%  (n=21) retained H3K27me3 expression. Among the NF1-related high-grade MPNSTs,  60% demonstrated loss of expression. In contrast, the majority of both sporadic  (95%) and radiotherapy-related (91%) MPNSTs showed loss of H3K27me3 expression.  Two of the 3 low-grade MPNSTs and all neurofibromas showed retained expression.  Furthermore, all 5 epithelioid MPNSTs retained H3K27me3 labeling. The  specificity of H3K27me3 loss as a marker for MPNSTs was studied by testing a  large spectrum of lesions included in MPNST differential diagnosis, such as  spindle/desmoplastic melanomas, synovial sarcomas, myoepithelial tumors, and  other mesenchymal neoplasms, all of which retained expression of H3K27me3. We  conclude that immunohistochemical analysis of H3K27me3 has good sensitivity and  robust specificity for the diagnosis of MPNST, particularly outside of NF1  clinical history, which represents the most challenging diagnostic setting.

Schwannomatosis, a rare form of neurofibromatosis, is characterized  predominantly by multiple, often painful, schwannomas throughout the peripheral  nervous system. The current standard of care for schwannomatosis is surgical  resection. A major obstacle to schwannomatosis research is the lack of robust  tumor cell lines. There is a great need for mechanistic and drug discovery  studies of schwannomatosis, yet appropriate tools are not currently available.  Schwannomatosis tumors are difficult to grow in culture as they survive only a  few passages before senescence. Our lab has extensive experience in establishing  primary and immortalized human Schwann cell cultures from normal tissue that  retain their phenotypes after immortalization. Therefore we took on the  challenge of creating immortalized human Schwann cell lines derived from tumors  from schwannomatosis patients. We have established and fully characterized 2  schwannomatosis cell lines from 2 separate patients using SV40 virus large T  antigen. One patient reported pain and the other did not. The schwannomatosis  cell lines were stained with S100B antibodies to confirm Schwann cell identity.  The schwannomatosis cells also expressed the Schwann cell markers, p75NTR,  S100B, and NGF after multiple passages. Cell morphology was retained following  multiple passaging and freeze/ thaw cycles. Gene expression microarray analysis  was used to compare the cell lines with their respective parent tumors. No  differences in key genes were detected, with the exception that several cell  cycle regulators were upregulated in the schwannomatosis cell lines when  compared to their parent tumors. This upregulation was apparently a product of  cell culturing, as the schwannomatosis cells exhibited the same expression  pattern of cell cycle regulatory genes as normal primary human Schwann cells.  Cell growth was also similar between normal primary and immortalized tumor cells  in culture. Accurate cell lines derived directly from human tumors will serve as  invaluable tools for advancing schwannomatosis research, including drug  screening.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: The Hippo pathway controls organ size through a negative  regulation of the transcription co-activator Yap1. The overexpression of  hyperactive mutant Yap1 or deletion of key components in the Hippo pathway leads  to increased organ size in different species. Analysis of interactions of this  pathway with other cellular signals corroborating organ size control is limited  in part due to the difficulties associated with development of rodent models. METHODS: Here, we develop a new model of reversible induction of the liver size  in mice using siRNA-nanoparticles targeting two kinases of the Hippo pathway,  namely, mammalian Ste20 family kinases 1 and 2 (Mst1 and Mst2), and an upstream  regulator, neurofibromatosis type II (Nf2). RESULTS: The triple siRNAs nanoparticle-induced hepatomegaly in mice phenocopies  one observed with Mst1(-/-)Mst2(-/-) liver-specific depletion, as shown by  extensive proliferation of hepatocytes and activation of Yap1. The simultaneous  co-treatment with a fourth siRNA nanoparticle against Yap1 fully blocked the  liver growth. Hippo pathway-induced liver enlargement is associated with p53  activation, evidenced by its accumulation in the nuclei and upregulation of its  target genes. Moreover, injections of the triple siRNAs nanoparticle in  p53(LSL/LSL) mice shows that livers lacking p53 expression grow faster and  exceed the size of livers in p53 wild-type animals, indicating a role of p53 in  controlling Yap1-induced liver growth. CONCLUSION: Our data show that siRNA-nanoparticulate manipulation of gene  expression can provide the reversible control of organ size in adult animals,  which presents a new avenue for the investigation of complex regulatory networks  in liver.

Comment in     Am J Pathol. 2016 Mar;186(3):462-3. doi: 10.1016/j.ajpath.2015.12.007.  Comprehensive genomic analyses of common nervous system cancers provide new  insights into their pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment. Although analogous  studies of rare nervous system tumors are needed, there are major barriers to  performing such studies. Cross-species comparative oncogenomics, identifying  driver mutations in mouse cancer models and validating them in human tumors, is  a promising alternative. Although still in its infancy, this approach is being  applied to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), rare Schwann  cell-derived malignancies that occur sporadically, after radiotherapy, and in  neurofibromatosis type 1. Studies of human neurofibromatosis type 1-associated  tumors suggest that NF1 tumor suppressor loss in Schwann cells triggers  cell-autonomous and intercellular changes, resulting in development of benign  neurofibromas; subsequent neurofibroma-MPNST progression is caused by aberrant  growth factor signaling and mutations affecting the p16(INK4A)-cyclin D1-CDK4-Rb  and p19(ARF)-Mdm2-p53 cell cycle pathways. Mice with Nf1, Trp53, and/or Cdkn2a  mutations that overexpress the Schwann cell mitogen neuregulin-1 or overexpress  the epidermal growth factor receptor validate observations in human tumors and,  to various degrees, model human tumorigenesis. Genomic analyses of MPNSTs  arising in neuregulin-1 and epidermal growth factor receptor-overexpressing mice  and forward genetic screens with Sleeping Beauty transposons implicate  additional signaling cascades in MPNST pathogenesis. These studies confirm the  utility of mouse models for MPNST driver gene discovery and provide new insights  into the complexity of MPNST pathogenesis.

Persons with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) have a predisposition for premature  and severe arterial stenosis. Mutations in the NF1 gene result in decreased  expression of neurofibromin, a negative regulator of p21(Ras), and increases Ras  signaling. Heterozygous Nf1 (Nf1(+/-)) mice develop a marked arterial stenosis  characterized by proliferating smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and a predominance of  infiltrating macrophages, which closely resembles arterial lesions from NF1  patients. Interestingly, lineage-restricted inactivation of a single Nf1 allele  in monocytes/macrophages is sufficient to recapitulate the phenotype observed in  Nf1(+/-) mice and to mobilize proinflammatory CCR2+ monocytes into the  peripheral blood. Therefore, we hypothesized that CCR2 receptor activation by  its primary ligand monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) is critical for  monocyte infiltration into the arterial wall and neointima formation in Nf1(+/-)  mice. MCP-1 induces a dose-responsive increase in Nf1(+/-) macrophage migration  and proliferation that corresponds with activation of multiple Ras kinases. In  addition, Nf1(+/-) SMCs, which express CCR2, demonstrate an enhanced  proliferative response to MCP-1 when compared with WT SMCs. To interrogate the  role of CCR2 activation on Nf1(+/-) neointima formation, we induced neointima  formation by carotid artery ligation in Nf1(+/-) and WT mice with genetic  deletion of either MCP1 or CCR2. Loss of MCP-1 or CCR2 expression effectively  inhibited Nf1(+/-) neointima formation and reduced macrophage content in the  arterial wall. Finally, administration of a CCR2 antagonist significantly  reduced Nf1(+/-) neointima formation. These studies identify MCP-1 as a potent  chemokine for Nf1(+/-) monocytes/macrophages and CCR2 as a viable therapeutic  target for NF1 arterial stenosis.  © The Author 2016.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a family of non-protein-coding RNAs with  length more than 200 nucleotides. LncRNAs played important roles in many  biological processes such as cell development, proliferation, invasion and  migration. Deregulation of LncRNAs was found in multiple tumors where they can  act as a tumor suppressor gene or oncogene. LncRNA ANRIL was identified as an  oncogene involved in a number of tumors such as gastric cancer, lung cancer,  hepatocellular carcinoma, and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Inhibition of  ANRIL suppressed the cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion.  Increasing data has showed that ANRIL may act as a diagnostic and prognostic  biomarker for some tumors. In our review, we summarize an overview of current  knowledge concerning the expression and role of ANRIL in various cancers.

Erratum in     Sci Rep. 2017 Jun 30;7:46384. doi: 10.1038/srep46384.  Congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia (CPT) is a rare disease which normally  presents itself during early childhood by anterolateral bowing of the tibia and  spontaneous tibial fractures. Although the exact etiology of CPT is highly  debated, 40-80% of CPT patients are carriers of a mutation in the  Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) gene, which can potentially result in an altered  phenotype of the skeletal cells and impaired bone healing. In this study we use  a computational model of bone regeneration to examine the effect of the Nf1  mutation on bone fracture healing by altering the parameter values of eight key  factors which describe the aberrant cellular behaviour of Nf1 haploinsufficient  and Nf1 bi-allelically inactivated cells. We show that the computational model  is able to predict the formation of a hamartoma as well as a wide variety of CPT  phenotypes through different combinations of altered parameter values. A  sensitivity analysis by ""Design of Experiments"" identified the impaired  endochondral ossification process and increased infiltration of fibroblastic  cells as key contributors to the degree of severity of CPT. Hence, the  computational model results have added credibility to the experimental  hypothesis of a genetic cause (i.e. Nf1 mutation) for CPT.

Approximately 30-50% of individuals with Neurofibromatosis type 1 develop benign  peripheral nerve sheath tumors, called plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs). PNFs can  undergo malignant transformation to highly metastatic malignant peripheral nerve  sheath tumors (MPNSTs) in 5-10% of NF1 patients, with poor prognosis. No  effective systemic therapy is currently available for unresectable tumors. In  tumors, the NF1 gene deficiency leads to Ras hyperactivation causing the  subsequent activation of the AKT/mTOR and Raf/MEK/ERK pathways and inducing  multiple cellular responses including cell proliferation. In this study, three  NF1-null MPNST-derived cell lines (90-8, 88-14 and 96-2), STS26T sporadic MPNST  cell line and PNF-derived primary Schwann cells were used to test responses to  AZD8055, an ATP-competitive ""active-site"" mTOR inhibitor. In contrast to  rapamycin treatment which only partially affected mTORC1 signaling, AZD8055  induced a strong inhibition of mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling in MPNST-derived cell  lines and PNF-derived Schwann cells. AZD8055 induced full blockade of mTORC1  leading to an efficient decrease of global protein synthesis. A higher cytotoxic  effect was observed with AZD8055 compared to rapamycin in the NF1-null  MPNST-derived cell lines with IC50 ranging from 70 to 140 nM and  antiproliferative effect was confirmed in PNF-derived Schwann cells. Cell  migration was impaired by AZD8055 treatment and cell cycle analysis showed a  G0/G1 arrest. Combined effects of AZD8055 and PD0325901 MEK inhibitor as well as  BRD4 (BromoDomain-containing protein 4) inhibitors showed a synergistic  antiproliferative effect. These data suggest that NF1-associated peripheral  nerve sheath tumors are an ideal target for AZD8055 as a single molecule or in  combined therapies.

BACKGROUND: Growth factors induce a characteristically short-lived Ras  activation in cells emerging from quiescence. Extensive work has shown that  transient as opposed to sustained Ras activation is critical for the induction  of mitogenic programs. Mitogen-induced accumulation of active Ras-GTP results  from increased nucleotide exchange driven by the nucleotide exchange factor Sos.  In contrast, the mechanism accounting for signal termination and prompt  restoration of basal Ras-GTP levels is unclear, but has been inferred to involve  feedback inhibition of Sos. Remarkably, how GTP-hydrolase activating proteins  (GAPs) participate in controlling the rise and fall of Ras-GTP levels is  unknown. RESULTS: Monitoring nucleotide exchange of Ras in permeabilized cells we find,  unexpectedly, that the decline of growth factor-induced Ras-GTP levels proceeds  in the presence of unabated high nucleotide exchange, pointing to GAP activation  as a major mechanism of signal termination. Experiments with non-hydrolysable  GTP analogues and mathematical modeling confirmed and rationalized the presence  of high GAP activity as Ras-GTP levels decline in a background of high  nucleotide exchange. Using pharmacological and genetic approaches we document a  raised activity of the neurofibromatosis type I tumor suppressor Ras-GAP  neurofibromin and an involvement of Rsk1 and Rsk2 in the down-regulation of  Ras-GTP levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that, in addition to feedback inhibition of Sos,  feedback stimulation of the RasGAP neurofibromin enforces termination of the Ras  signal in the context of growth-factor signaling. These findings ascribe a  precise role to neurofibromin in growth factor-dependent control of Ras activity  and illustrate how, by engaging Ras-GAP activity, mitogen-challenged cells play  safe to ensure a timely termination of the Ras signal irrespectively of the  reigning rate of nucleotide exchange.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common neurogenetic disorder, in which  affected individuals develop tumors of the nervous system. Children with NF1 are  particularly prone to brain tumors (gliomas) involving the optic pathway that  can result in impaired vision. Since tumor formation and expansion requires a  cooperative tumor microenvironment, it is important to identify the cellular and  acellular components associated with glioma development and growth. In this  study, we used 3-D matrix assisted laser desorption ionization imaging mass  spectrometry (MALDI IMS) to measure the distributions of multiple molecular  species throughout optic nerve tissue in mice with and without glioma, and to  explore their spatial relationships within the 3-D volume of the optic nerve and  chiasm. 3-D IMS studies often involve extensive workflows due to the high volume  of sections required to generate high quality 3-D images. Herein, we present a  workflow for 3-D data acquisition and volume reconstruction using mouse optic  nerve tissue. The resulting 3-D IMS data yield both molecular similarities and  differences between glioma-bearing and wild-type (WT) tissues, including protein  distributions localizing to different anatomical subregions. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The current work addresses a number of challenges in  3-D MALDI IMS, driven by the small size of the mouse optic nerve and the need to  maintain consistency across multiple 2-D IMS experiments. The 3-D IMS data yield  both molecular similarities and differences between glioma-bearing and wild-type  (WT) tissues, including protein distributions localizing to different anatomical  subregions, which could then be targeted for identification and related back to  the biology observed in gliomas of the optic nerve.

Neurofibromatosis I is a common genetic disorder that results in tumor  formation, and predisposes individuals to a range of cognitive/behavioral  symptoms, including deficits in attention, visuospatial skills, learning,  language development, and sleep, and autism spectrum disorder-like traits. The  nf1-encoded neurofibromin protein (Nf1) exhibits high conservation, from the  common fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to humans. Drosophila provides a  powerful platform to investigate the signaling cascades upstream and downstream  of Nf1, and the fly model exhibits similar behavioral phenotypes to mammalian  models. In order to understand how loss of Nf1 affects motor behavior in flies,  we combined traditional activity monitoring with video analysis of grooming  behavior. In nf1 mutants, spontaneous grooming was increased up to 7x. This  increase in activity was distinct from previously described dopamine-dependent  hyperactivity, as dopamine transporter mutants exhibited slightly decreased  grooming. Finally, we found that relative grooming frequencies can be compared  in standard activity monitors that measure infrared beam breaks, enabling the  use of activity monitors as an automated method to screen for grooming  phenotypes. Overall, these data suggest that loss of nf1 produces excessive  activity that is manifested as increased grooming, providing a platform to  dissect the molecular genetics of neurofibromin signaling across neuronal  circuits.

To identify genes and signaling pathways that initiate Neurofibromatosis type 1  (NF1) neurofibromas, we used unbiased insertional mutagenesis screening, mouse  models, and molecular analyses. We mapped an Nf1-Stat3-Arid1b/β-catenin pathway  that becomes active in the context of Nf1 loss. Genetic deletion of Stat3 in  Schwann cell progenitors (SCPs) and Schwann cells (SCs) prevents neurofibroma  formation, decreasing SCP self-renewal and β-catenin activity. β-catenin  expression rescues effects of Stat3 loss in SCPs. Importantly, P-STAT3 and  β-catenin expression correlate in human neurofibromas. Mechanistically, P-Stat3  represses Gsk3β and the SWI/SNF gene Arid1b to increase β-catenin. Knockdown of  Arid1b or Gsk3β in Stat3(fl/fl);Nf1(fl/fl);DhhCre SCPs rescues neurofibroma  formation after in vivo transplantation. Stat3 represses Arid1b through histone  modification in a Brg1-dependent manner, indicating that epigenetic modification  plays a role in early tumorigenesis. Our data map a neural tumorigenesis pathway  and support testing JAK/STAT and Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibitors in  neurofibroma therapeutic trials.  Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

A major barrier to developing precision  medicine approaches for NF1 is an incomplete understanding of the factors that  underlie its inherent variability. To determine the impact of the germline NF1  gene mutation on the optic gliomas frequently encountered in children with NF1,  we developed genetically engineered mice harboring two representative  NF1-patient-derived Nf1 gene mutations (c.2542G>C;p.G848R and  c.2041C>T;p.R681X). We found that each germline Nf1 gene mutation resulted in  different levels of neurofibromin expression. Importantly, only R681X(CKO) but  not G848R(CKO), mice develop optic gliomas with increased optic nerve volumes,  glial fibrillary acid protein immunoreactivity, proliferation and retinal  ganglion cell death, similar to Nf1 conditional knockout mice harboring a  neomycin insertion (neo) as the germline Nf1 gene mutation. These differences in  optic glioma phenotypes reflect both cell-autonomous and stromal effects of the  germline Nf1 gene mutation. In this regard, primary astrocytes harboring the  R681X germline Nf1 gene mutation exhibit increased basal astrocyte proliferation  (BrdU incorporation) indistinguishable from neo(CKO) astrocytes, whereas  astrocytes with the G848R mutation have lower levels of proliferation. Evidence  for paracrine effects from the tumor microenvironment were revealed when  R681X(CKO) mice were compared with conventional neo(CKO) mice. Relative to  neo(CKO) mice, the optic gliomas from R681X(CKO) mice had more microglia  infiltration and JNK(Thr183/Tyr185) activation, microglia-produced Ccl5, and  glial AKT(Thr308) activation. Collectively, these studies establish that the  germline Nf1 gene mutation is a major determinant of optic glioma development  and growth through by both tumor cell-intrinsic and stromal effects.  © The Author 2016.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder  affecting about 1 in 3,500 individuals. Chronic pain is commonly reported among  individuals with NF1 and plexiform neurofibroma tumors (PNs). Acceptance and  Commitment Therapy (ACT), an empirically supported method for addressing chronic  pain, helps individuals re-focus on valued relationships and activities. This  pilot study investigated the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a brief ACT  workshop in the NF1 population. Eligible participants included adolescents and  young adults (AYA; 12-21 years) with NF1 and chronic pain that interfered with  daily functioning and their parents. Patients and parents completed baseline  measures of pain interference, pain intensity, functional disability, pain  acceptance, depression, and anxiety. Then, AYA and parents participated  separately in a 2-day small-group ACT workshop. A telephone booster session  occurred 1 month post-intervention. Three-month post-treatment measures were  completed by mail. Ten adolescents (4 males; M age = 16.9 years) and seven  parents provided baseline and 3-month data. Mean satisfaction with the study was  moderate to high (3.9 for patients and 4.6 for parents on a 1-5 scales).  Patients and parents reported significant declines in patients' pain  interference at 3 months post-treatment. Patient-reported pain intensity  significantly declined from baseline to 3 months. Parents reported marginally  greater acceptance of their child's pain. No changes emerged in functional  ability or mood. Preliminary findings suggest that a brief ACT group  intervention is feasible and may help AYA with NF1 and PNs cope with their  chronic pain, although larger randomized studies are needed to confirm treatment  efficacy. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.  © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Urachal adenocarcinoma is a rare bladder malignancy arising from the urachal  remnant. Given its rarity and the lack of knowledge about its genetic  characteristics, optimal management of this cancer is not well defined. Practice  patterns vary and outcomes remain poor. In order to identify the genomic  underpinnings of this malignancy, we performed whole exome sequencing using  seven tumor/normal pairs of formalin fixed archival specimens. We identified  recurrent evidence of MAP-kinase pathway activation as three patients had  neurofibromin 1 (NF1) mutations, with one of these patients also harboring an  oncogenic KRAS G13D mutation. We also observed recurrent evidence of  Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation as three patients had oncogenic mutations in  APC or RNF43. In addition, somatic copy number analysis revealed focal  chromosome 12p amplifications in three samples, resembling findings from  testicular germ cell tumors. We describe the genomic landscape of this  malignancy in our institutional cohort and propose investigation of the  therapeutic potential for MAP-K pathway inhibition in the subset of patients who  show evidence of its activation.

OBJECTIVE: Lovastatin has been shown to reverse learning deficits in a mouse  model of Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1), a common monogenic disorder caused by a  mutation in the Ras-MAPK pathway and associated with learning disabilities. We  conducted a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to assess  lovastatin's effects on cognition and behavior in patients with NF1. METHOD: Forty-four NF1 patients (mean age 25.7+/-11.6 years; 64% female) were  randomly assigned to 14 weeks of lovastatin (N = 23; maximum dose of 80 mg/day  for adult participants and 40 mg/day for children) or placebo (N = 21). Based on  findings in the mouse model, primary outcome measures were nonverbal learning  and working memory. Secondary outcome measures included verbal memory,  attention, and self/parent-reported behavioral problems, as well as tolerability  of medication. Participants also underwent neuroimaging assessments at baseline  and 14 weeks, to determine whether neural biomarkers were associated with  treatment response. Linear mixed models assessed for differential treatment  effects on outcome measures. RESULTS: Twelve participants dropped from the study prior to completion (8  placebo, 4 lovastatin), resulting in 32 completers (15 placebo, 17 lovastatin).  Lovastatin was well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events. Differential  improvement favoring lovastatin treatment was observed for one primary (working  memory; effect size f (2) = 0.70, P < 0.01) and two secondary outcome measures  (verbal memory, f (2) = 0.19, P = 0.02, and adult self-reported internalizing  problems, f (2) = 0.26, P = 0.03). Exploratory moderator analyses revealed that  higher baseline neural activity in frontal regions was associated with larger  treatment effects. INTERPRETATION: These preliminary results suggest beneficial effects of  lovastatin on some learning and memory functions, as well as internalizing  symptoms in patients with NF1.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are highly aggressive soft  tissue neoplasms that are extremely rare and are frequently associated with  neurofibromatosis type 1 patients. MPNSTs are typically fatal, and there is no  effective treatment so far. In our previous study, we showed that flaccidoside  II, one of the triterpenoid saponins isolated from Anemone flaccida Fr. Schmidt,  has antitumor potential by inducing apoptosis. In the present study, we found  that flaccidoside II inhibits proliferation and facilitates apoptosis in MPNST  cell lines ST88-14 and S462. Furthermore, this study provides a mechanism by  which the downregulation of heme oxygenase-1 via extracellular signal-regulated  kinase-1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways is involved in the  apoptotic role of flaccidoside II. This study suggested the potential of  flaccidoside II as a novel pharmacotherapeutic approach for MPNSTs.

PMID:27159396,Cotargeting MNK and MEK kinases induces the regression of NF1-mutant cancers.,"Cotargeting MNK and MEK kinases induces the regression of NF1-mutant cancers.  Lock R, Ingraham R, Maertens O, Miller AL, Weledji N, Legius E, Konicek BM, Yan  SC, Graff JR, Cichowski K.  Neurofibromin 1-mutant (NF1-mutant) cancers are driven by excessive Ras  signaling; however, there are currently no effective therapies for these or  other Ras-dependent tumors. While combined MEK and mTORC1 suppression causes  regression of NF1-deficient malignancies in animal models, the potential  toxicity of cotargeting these 2 major signaling pathways in humans may  necessitate the identification of more refined, cancer-specific signaling nodes.  Here, we have provided evidence that MAPK-interacting kinases (MNKs), which  converge on the mTORC1 effector eIF4E, are therapeutic targets in NF1-deficient  malignancies. Specifically, we evaluated primary human NF1-deficient peripheral  nervous system tumors and found that MNKs are activated in the majority of  tumors tested. Genetic and chemical suppression of MNKs in NF1-deficient murine  tumor models and human cell lines potently cooperated with MEK inhibitors to  kill these cancers through effects on eIF4E. We also demonstrated that MNK  kinases are important and direct targets of cabozantinib. Accordingly,  coadministration of cabozantinib and MEK inhibitors triggered dramatic  regression in an aggressive genetically engineered tumor model. The cytotoxicity  of this combination required the suppression of MNK-induced eIF4E  phosphorylation and was not recapitulated by suppressing other cabozantinib  targets. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that combined MNK and MEK  suppression represents a promising therapeutic strategy for these incurable  Ras-driven tumors and highlight the utility of developing selective MNK  inhibitors for these and possibly other malignancies.

The Hippo-YAP pathway has emerged as a major driver of tumorigenesis in many  human cancers. YAP is a transcriptional coactivator and while details of YAP  regulation are quickly emerging, it remains unknown what downstream targets are  critical for the oncogenic functions of YAP. To determine the mechanisms  involved and to identify disease-relevant targets, we examined the role of YAP  in neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) using cell and animal models. We found that  YAP function is required for NF2-null Schwann cell survival, proliferation, and  tumor growth in vivo Moreover, YAP promotes transcription of several targets  including PTGS2, which codes for COX-2, a key enzyme in prostaglandin  biosynthesis, and AREG, which codes for the EGFR ligand, amphiregulin. Both AREG  and prostaglandin E2 converge to activate signaling through EGFR. Importantly,  treatment with the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib significantly inhibited the growth  of NF2-null Schwann cells and tumor growth in a mouse model of NF2.

Merlin, encoded by the NF2 gene, is a tumor suppressor that acts by inhibiting  mitogenic signaling and is mutated in Neurofibromatosis type II (NF2) disease,  although its molecular mechanism is not fully understood. Here, we observed that  Merlin inhibited Wnt/β-catenin signaling by blocking phosphorylation of LRP6,  which is necessary for Wnt signal transduction, whereas mutated Merlin in NF2  patients did not. Treatment with Wnt3a enhanced phosphorylation of Ser518 in  Merlin via activation of PAK1 in a PIP2-dependent manner. Phosphorylated Merlin  dissociated from LRP6, allowing for phosphorylation of LRP6. Tissues from NF2  patients exhibited higher levels of β-catenin, and proliferation of RT4-D6P2T  rat schwannoma cells was significantly reduced by treatment with chemical  inhibitors of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Taken together, our findings suggest that  sustained activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling due to abrogation of  Merlin-mediated inhibition of LRP6 phosphorylation may be a cause of NF2  disease.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and Legius syndrome are related diseases with  partially overlapping symptoms caused by alterations of the tumor suppressor  genes NF1 (encoding the protein neurofibromin) and SPRED1 (encoding  sprouty-related, EVH1 domain-containing protein 1, Spred1), respectively. Both  proteins are negative regulators of Ras/MAPK signaling with neurofibromin  functioning as a Ras-specific GTPase activating protein (GAP) and Spred1 acting  on hitherto undefined components of the pathway. Importantly, neurofibromin has  been identified as a key protein in the development of cancer, as it is  genetically altered in a large number of sporadic human malignancies unrelated  to NF1. Spred1 has previously been demonstrated to interact with neurofibromin  via its N-terminal Ena/VASP Homology 1 (EVH1) domain and to mediate membrane  translocation of its target dependent on its C-terminal Sprouty domain. However,  the region of neurofibromin required for the interaction with Spred1 has  remained unclear. Here we show that the EVH1 domain of Spred1 binds to the  noncatalytic (GAPex) portion of the GAP-related domain (GRD) of neurofibromin.  Binding is compatible with simultaneous binding of Ras and does not interfere  with GAP activity. Our study points to a potential targeting function of the  GAPex subdomain of neurofibromin that is present in all known canonical RasGAPs.

Author information: (1)Department of Life Science, University of Seoul, Seoul 02504, Korea.  Merlin, encoded by the NF2 gene, is a tumor suppressor that exerts its function  via inhibiting mitogenic receptors at the plasma membrane. Although multiple  mutations in Merlin have been identified in Neurofibromatosis type II (NF2)  disease, its molecular mechanism is not fully understood. Here, we show that  Merlin interacts with LRP6 and inhibits LRP6 phosphorylation, a critical step  for the initiation of Wnt signaling. We found that treatment of Wnt3a caused  phosphorylation of Merlin by PAK1, leading to detachment of Merlin from LRP6 and  allowing the initiation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. A higher level of β-catenin  was found in tissues from NF2 patients. Enhanced proliferation and migration  caused by knockdown of Merlin in glioblastoma cells were inhibited by  suppression of β-catenin. Conclusively, these results suggest that sustained  Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity induced by abrogation of Merlin-mediated  inhibition of LRP6 phosphorylation might be a cause of NF2 disease.

Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a dominantly inherited autosomal disease  characterized by schwannomas of the 8th cranial nerve. The NF2 tumor suppressor  gene encodes for Merlin, a protein implicated as a suppressor of multiple  cellular signaling pathways. To identify potential drug targets in  NF2-associated malignancies we assessed the consequences of inhibiting the  tyrosine kinase receptor MET. We identified crizotinib, a MET and ALK inhibitor,  as a potent inhibitor of NF2-null Schwann cell proliferation in vitro and tumor  growth in vivo. To identify the target/s of crizotnib we employed activity-based  protein profiling (ABPP), leading to identification of FAK1 (PTK2) as the  relevant target of crizotinib inhibition in NF2-null schwannoma cells.  Subsequent studies confirm that inhibition of FAK1 is sufficient to suppress  tumorigenesis in animal models of NF2 and that crizotinib-resistant forms of  FAK1 can rescue the effects of treatment. These studies identify a FDA approved  drug as a potential treatment for NF2 and delineate the mechanism of action in  NF2-null Schwann cells.

Glioma gene modules co-expressed with NF1 (NF1-M),  Sprouty (SPRY-M) and PTEN (PTEN-M) were identified, their signatures enabled  robust clustering of adult diffuse gliomas of WHO grades II-IV from five  independent data sets into two subtypes with distinct activities of  RAS-RAF-MEK-MAPK cascade and PI3K-AKT pathway (named RMPAhigh and RMPAlow  subtypes) in a morphology-independent manner. The RMPAhigh gliomas were  associated with poor prognosis compared to the RMPAlow gliomas. The RMPAhigh and  RMPAlow glioma subtypes harbored unique sets of genomic alterations in the RTK  signaling-related genes. The RMPAhigh gliomas were enriched in immature vessel  cells and tumor associated macrophages, and both cell types expressed high  levels of pro-angiogenic RTKs including MET, VEGFR1, KDR, EPHB4 and NRP1. In  gliomas with major genomic lesions unrelated to RTK pathway, high RMPA signature  was associated with short survival. Thus, the RMPA signatures capture RTK  activities in both glioma cells and glioma microenvironment, and RTK signaling  in the glioma microenvironment contributes to glioma progression.

Comment in     Haematologica. 2016 Dec;101(12):e492. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2016.156448.  Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia is a rare myeloproliferative neoplasm  characterized by hyperactive RAS signaling. Neurofibromin1 (encoded by the NF1  gene) is a negative regulator of RAS activation. Patients with neurofibromatosis  type 1 harbor loss-of-function mutations in NF1 and have a 200- to 500-fold  increased risk of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Leukemia cells from patients  with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia display hypersensitivity to certain  cytokines, such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. The  granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor utilizes  pre-associated JAK2 to initiate signals after ligand binding. JAK2 subsequently  activates STAT5, among other downstream effectors. Although STAT5 is gaining  recognition as an important mediator of growth factor signaling in myeloid  leukemias, the contribution of STAT5 to the development of hyperactive  RAS-initiated myeloproliferative disease has not been well described. In this  study, we investigated the consequence of STAT5 attenuation via genetic and  pharmacological approaches in Nf1-deficient murine models of juvenile  myelomonocytic leukemia. We found that homozygous Stat5 deficiency extended the  lifespan of Nf1-deficient mice and eliminated the development of  myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with Nf1 gene loss. Likewise, we found  that JAK inhibition with ruxolitinib attenuated myeloproliferative neoplasm in  Nf1-deficient mice. Finally, we found that primary cells from a patient with  KRAS-mutant juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia displayed reduced colony formation  in response to JAK2 inhibition. Our findings establish a central role for STAT5  activation in the pathogenesis of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and suggest  that targeting this pathway may be of clinical utility in these patients.

Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is a neurogenetic disease marked by multiple  cognitive and learning problems. Genetic variants may account for phenotypic  variance in NF1. Here, we investigated the association between the  catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val(158)Met polymorphism and working memory  and arithmetic performance in 50 NF1 individuals. A significant association of  the COMT polymorphism was observed only with verbal working memory, as measured  by the backward digit-span task with an advantageous performance for Met/Met  carriers. To study how genetic modifiers influence NF1 cognitive performance  might be of importance to decrease the unpredictability of the cognitive profile  among NF1 patients.

In contrast to axons of the central nervous system (CNS), axons of the  peripheral nervous system (PNS) show better, but still incomplete and often slow  regeneration following injury. The tumor suppressor protein merlin, mutated in  the hereditary tumor syndrome Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), has recently been  shown to have RhoA regulatory functions in PNS neurons-in addition to its  well-characterized, growth-inhibitory activity in Schwann cells. Here we report  that the conditional knockout of merlin in PNS neurons leads to impaired  functional recovery of mice following sciatic nerve crush injury, in a  gene-dosage dependent manner. Gross anatomical or electrophysiological  alterations of sciatic nerves could not be detected. However, correlating with  attenuated RhoA activation due to merlin deletion, ultrastructural analysis of  nerve samples indicated enhanced sprouting of axons with reduced caliber size  and increased myelination compared to wildtype animals. We conclude that  deletion of the tumor suppressor merlin in the neuronal compartment of  peripheral nerves results in compromised functional regeneration after injury.  This mechanism could explain the clinical observation that NF2 patients suffer  from higher incidences of slowly recovering facial nerve paralysis after  vestibular schwannoma surgery.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is associated with neurocognitive deficits that  can impact everyday functioning of children, adolescents, and adults with this  disease. However, there is little agreement regarding measures to use as  cognitive endpoints in clinical trials. This article describes the work of the  Neurocognitive Committee of the Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and  Schwannomatosis (REiNS) International Collaboration. The goal of this committee  is to identify standardized and specific cognitive assessment tools for use in  NF clinical trials. The committee first identified cognitive domains relevant to  NF1 and prioritized attention as the first domain of focus given prior and  current trends in NF1 cognitive clinical trials. Performance measures and  behavioral rating questionnaires of attention were reviewed by the group using  established criteria to assess patient characteristics, psychometric properties,  and feasibility. The highest rated tests underwent side-by-side comparison. The  Digit Span subtest from the Wechsler scales was given the highest ratings of the  performance measures due to its good psychometrics, feasibility, utility across  a wide age range, and extensive use in previous research. The Conners scales  achieved the highest ratings of the behavioral questionnaires for similar  reasons. Future articles will focus on other cognitive domains, with the  ultimate goal of achieving agreement for cognitive endpoints that can be used  across NF clinical trials.  © 2016 American Academy of Neurology.

OBJECTIVE: Tumors and other disease complications of neurofibromatosis (NF) can  cause pain and negatively affect physical functioning. To document the clinical  benefit of treatment in NF trials targeting these manifestations,  patient-reported outcomes (PROs) assessing pain and physical functioning should  be included as study endpoints. Currently, there is no consensus on the  selection and use of such measures in the NF population. This article presents  the recommendations of the PRO group of the Response Evaluation in  Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) International Collaboration for  assessing the domains of pain and physical functioning for NF clinical trials. METHODS: The REiNS PRO group reviewed and rated existing PRO measures assessing  pain intensity, pain interference, and physical functioning using their  systematic method. Final recommendations are based primarily on 4 main criteria:  patient characteristics, item content, psychometric properties, and feasibility  for clinical trials. RESULTS: The REiNS PRO group chose the Numeric Rating Scale-11 (≥8 years) to  assess pain intensity, the Pain Interference Index (6-24 years) and the  Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Pain  Interference Scale (≥18 years) to evaluate pain interference, and the PROMIS  Physical Functioning Scale to measure upper extremity function and mobility (≥5  years) for NF clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: The REiNS Collaboration currently recommends these PRO measures to  assess the domains of pain and physical functioning for NF clinical trials;  however, further research is needed to evaluate their use in individuals with  NF. A final consensus recommendation for the pain interference measure will be  disseminated in a future publication based on findings from additional published  research.  © 2016 American Academy of Neurology.

Previous evidence showed mutations of the neurofibromin type 2 gene (Nf2),  encoding the tumor suppressor protein merlin, in sporadic and vestibular  schwannomas affecting Schwann cells (SCs). Accordingly, efforts have been  addressed to identify possible factors, even environmental, that may regulate  neurofibromas growth. In this context, we investigated the exposure of SC to an  electromagnetic field (EMF), which is an environmental issue modulating  biological processes. Here, we show that SC exposed to 50 Hz EMFs changes their  morphology, proliferation, migration and myelinating capability. In these cells,  merlin is downregulated, leading to activation of two intracellular signaling  pathways, ERK/AKT and Hippo. Interestingly, SC changes their phenotype toward a  proliferative/migrating state, which in principle may be pathologically relevant  for schwannoma development.

BACKGROUND: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is an aggressive  sarcoma with few treatment options. Tumor immune state has not been  characterized in MPNST, and is important in determining response to immune  checkpoint blockade. Our aim was to evaluate the expression of programmed  death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), and presence of  CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in MPNST, and correlate these  findings with clinical behavior and outcome. RESULTS: PD-L1 staining of at least 1% was seen in 0/20 nerves, 2/68 benign  lesions and 9/53 MPNST. Two of 68 benign lesions and 7/53 (13%) MPNST had at  least 5% PD-L1 staining. CD8 staining of at least 5% was seen in 1/20 (5%)  nerves, 45/68 (66%) benign lesions and 30/53 (57%) MPNST. PD-L1 was  statistically more prevalent in MPNST than both nerves and benign lesions  (p=0.049 and p=0.008, respectively). Expression of PD-1 was absent in all tissue  specimens. There was no correlation of PD-L1 or CD8 expression with disease  state (primary versus metastatic) or patient survival. METHODS: A comprehensive PNST tissue microarray was created from 141 surgical  specimens including primary, recurrent, and metastatic MPNST (n=53),  neurofibromas (n=57), schwannoma (n=11), and normal nerve (n=20). Cores were  stained in triplicate for PD-L1, PD-1, and CD8, and expression compared between  tumor types. These data were then examined for survival correlates in 35  patients with primary MPNST. CONCLUSIONS: MPNST is characterized by low PD-L1 and absent PD-1 expression with  significant CD8+ TIL presence. MPNST immune microenvironment does not correlate  with patient outcome.

BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy targeting cancer-testis antigen NY-ESO-1 shows promise  for tumors with poor response to chemoradiation. Malignant peripheral nerve  sheath tumors (MPNSTs) and liposarcomas (LPS) are chemoresistant and have few  effective treatment options. Materials Methods: Using a comprehensive tissue  microarray (TMA) of both benign and malignant tumors in primary, recurrent, and  metastatic samples, we examined NY-ESO-1 expression in peripheral nerve sheath  tumor (PNST) and adipocytic tumors. The PNST TMA included 42 MPNSTs (spontaneous  n = 26, NF1-associated n = 16), 35 neurofibromas (spontaneous n = 22, NF-1  associated n = 13), 11 schwannomas, and 18 normal nerves. The LPS TMA included  48 well-differentiated/dedifferentiated (WD/DD) LPS, 13 myxoid/round cell LPS, 3  pleomorphic LPS, 8 lipomas, 1 myelolipoma, and 3 normal adipocytic tissue  samples. Stained in triplicate, NY-ESO-1 intensity and density were scored. RESULTS: NY-ESO-1 expression was exclusive to malignant tumors. 100% of  myxoid/round cell LPS demonstrated NY-ESO-1 expression, while only 6% of WD/DD  LPS showed protein expression, one of which was WD LPS. Of MPNST, 4/26 (15%)  spontaneous and 2/16 (12%) NF1-associated MPNSTs demonstrated NY-ESO-1  expression. Strong NY-ESO-1 expression was observed in myxoid/round cell and  dedifferentiated LPS, and MPNST in primary, neoadjuvant, and metastatic  settings. CONCLUSIONS: We found higher prevalence of NY-ESO-1 expression in MPNSTs than  previously reported, highlighting a subset of MPNST patients who may benefit  from immunotherapy. This study expands our understanding of NY-ESO-1 in WD/DD  LPS and is the first demonstration of staining in a WD LPS and  metastatic/recurrent myxoid/round cell LPS.

Hyaluronan (HA) has been shown to play important roles in the growth, invasion  and metastasis of malignant tumors. Our previous study showing that high HA  expression in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) is predictive of  poor patient prognosis, prompted us to speculate that inhibition of HA synthesis  in MPNST might suppress the tumorigenicity. The aim of our study was to  investigate the antitumor effects of 4-methylumbelliferone (MU), an HA synthesis  inhibitor, on human MPNST cells and tissues. The effects of MU on HA  accumulation and tumorigenicity in MPNST cells were analyzed in the presence or  absence of MU in an in vitro as well as in vivo xenograft model using human  MPNST cell lines, sNF96.2 (primary recurrent) and sNF02.2 (metastatic). MU  significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion in both MPNST  cell lines. HA binding protein (HABP) staining, particle exclusion assay and  quantification of HA revealed that MU significantly decreased HA accumulation in  the cytoplasms and pericellular matrices in both MPNST cell lines. The  expression levels of HA synthase2 (HAS2) and HA synthase3 (HAS3) mRNA were  downregulated after treatment with MU. MU induced apoptosis of sNF96.2 cells,  but not sNF02.2 cells. MU administration significantly inhibited the tumor  growth of sNF96.2 cells in the mouse xenograft model. To the best of our  knowledge, our study demonstrates for the first time the antitumor effects of MU  on human MPNST mediated by inhibition of HA synthesis. Our results suggest that  MU may be a promising agent with novel antitumor mechanisms for MPNST.  © 2016 UICC.  DOI: 10.1002/ijc.30460 PMID: 27706810 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",False,Drug effect study

Nf1 mutations or deletions are suggested to underlie the tumor predisposition of  NF1 (neurofibromatosis type 1) and few treatments are available for treating NF1  patients with advanced malignant tumors. Aberrant activation of Ras in  Nf1-deficient conditions is responsible for the promotion of tumorigenesis in  NF1. PKC is proven to be an important factor in supporting the viability of  Nf1-defected cells, but the molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. In  this study, we demonstrate that the inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) by  1-O-Hexadecyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycerol (HMG, a PKC inhibitor) preferentially  sensitizes Nf1-defected cells to apoptosis, via triggering a persistent mitotic  arrest. In this process, Ral A is activated. Subsequently, Chk1 is  phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus. Silencing Ral A significantly  blocks Chk1 nuclear translocation and releases HMG-treated Nf1-deficient cells  from mitotic arrest, resulting in the reduction of the magnitude of apoptosis.  Thus, our study reveals that PKC is able to maintain the homeostasis or  viability of Nf1-defected cells and may serve as a potential target for  developing new therapeutic strategies.

Author information: (1)Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cancer and Blood  Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Research Foundation,  Cincinnati Children's Hospital, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an inherited disease in which affected  patients are predisposed to develop benign Schwann cell (SC) tumours called  neurofibromas. In the mouse, loss of Nf1 in the SC lineage causes neurofibroma  formation. The tyrosine kinase receptor EGFR is expressed in Schwann cell  precursors (SCP), which have been implicated in plexiform neurofibroma  initiation. To test if EGFR activity affects neurofibroma initiation, size,  and/or number, we studied mice expressing human EGFR in SCs and SCP in the  context of mice that form neurofibromas. Neurofibroma number increased in  homozygous CNP-hEGFR mice versus heterozygous littermates, and neurofibroma  number and size increased when CNP-hEGFR was crossed to Nf1fl/fl;DhhCre mice.  Conversely, diminished EGFR signalling in Nf1fl/fl;DhhCre;Wa2/+ mice decreased  neurofibroma number. In vivo transplantation verified the correlation between  EGFR activity and neurofibroma formation. Mechanistically, expression of  CNP-hEGFR increased SCP/neurofibroma-initiating cell self-renewal, a surrogate  for tumour initiation, and activated P-Stat3. Further, Il-6 reinforced  Jak2/Stat3 activation in SCPs and SCs. These gain- and loss-of function assays  show that levels of tyrosine kinase expression in SCPs modify neurofibroma  initiation.

HYPOTHESIS: p21-activated kinase (PAK) regulates signaling pathways that promote  cell survival and proliferation; therefore, pharmacological inhibition of PAK  will induce cell death in vestibular schwannomas (VS) and meningiomas. BACKGROUND: All VS and many meningiomas result from loss of the  neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) gene product merlin, with ensuing PAK  hyperactivation and increased cell proliferation/survival. METHODS: The novel small molecule PAK inhibitors PI-8 and PI-15-tested in  schwannoma and meningioma cells-perturb molecular signaling and induce cell  death. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, flow  cytometry, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling  assay analyzed PAK inhibitors' effect on cell viability, cell cycle, and cell  death, respectively. Western blots evaluated activation and expression of cell  proliferation, apoptotic, and mitotic catastrophe markers. Light microscopy  evaluated cell morphology, and immunocytochemistry analyzed cellular  localization of phospho-Merlin and autophagy-related protein. RESULTS: Treatment with PI-8 and PI-15 decreased cell viability at 0.65 to  3.7 μM 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) in schwannoma and meningioma cells.  Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling and  immunocytochemistry studies show that PI-8 and PI-15 induce mitotic catastrophe  but not apoptosis in HEI193 cells while in BenMen1 cells, PI-8 induces autophagy  and mitotic catastrophe. PI-15 induces apoptosis in BenMen1 cells. PAK inhibitor  treated cells show phospho-Merlin localized to over-duplicated centrosomes of  dividing cells, multiple enlarged nuclei, and misaligned/missegregated  chromosomes-markers for mitotic catastrophe. Increased autophagy-related protein  levels in the nucleus confirmed this cell death type. PI-8 and PI-15 inhibits  PAK in both cell lines. However, only PI-15 inhibits v-akt murine thymoma viral  oncogene homolog in BenMen1 cells. CONCLUSION: PAK inhibitors induce cell death in schwannoma and meningioma cells,  at least in part, by mitotic catastrophe.

IMPORTANCE: Recent reports have demonstrated a higher incidence of autism  spectrum disorder (ASD) and substantially elevated autistic trait burden in  individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). However, important  discrepancies regarding the distribution of autistic traits, sex predominance,  and association between ASD symptoms and attentional problems have emerged, and  critical features of the ASD phenotype within NF1 have never been adequately  explored. Establishing NF1 as a monogenic cause for ASD has important  implications for affected patients and for future research focused on  establishing convergent pathogenic mechanisms relevant to the potential  treatment targets for ASD. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the quantitative autistic trait (QAT) burden in a  pooled NF1 data set. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Anonymized, individual-level primary data  were accumulated from 6 tertiary referral centers in the United States, Belgium,  United Kingdom, and Australia. A total of 531 individuals recruited from NF1  clinical centers were included in the study. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Distribution of ASD traits (Social Responsiveness  Scale, second edition [SRS-2], with T scores of ≥75 associated with a  categorical ASD diagnosis); attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)  traits (4 versions of Conners Rating Scale, with T scores of ≥65 indicating  clinically significant ADHD symptoms); ASD symptom structure, latent structure,  base rate derived from mixture modeling; and familiality. RESULTS: Of the 531 patients included in the analysis, 247 were male (46.5%);  median age was 11 years (range, 2.5-83.9 years). QAT scores were continuously  distributed and pathologically shifted; 13.2% (95% CI, 10.3%-16.1%) of  individuals scored within the most severe range (ie, above the first percentile  of the general population distribution) in which the male to female ratio was  markedly attenuated (1.6:1) relative to idiopathic ASD. Autistic symptoms in  this NF1 cohort demonstrated a robust unitary factor structure, with the first  principal component explaining 30.9% of the variance in SRS-2 scores, and a  strong association with ADHD symptoms (r = 0.61). Within-family correlation for  QAT burden (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.73 in NF1-affected  first-degree relatives) exceeded that observed in the general population and ASD  family samples. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study provides confirmation that the diversity  of mutations that give rise to NF1 function as quantitative trait loci for ASD.  Moreover, the within-family correlation implicates a high degree of mutational  specificity for this associated phenotype. Clinicians should be alerted to the  increased frequency of this disabling comorbidity, and the scientific community  should be aware of the potential for this monogenic disorder to help elucidate  the biological features of idiopathic autism.

It is well recognized that G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can activate  Ras-regulated kinase pathways to produce lasting changes in neuronal function.  Mechanisms by which GPCRs transduce these signals and their relevance to brain  disorders are not well understood. Here, we identify a major Ras regulator,  neurofibromin 1 (NF1), as a direct effector of GPCR signaling via Gβγ subunits  in the striatum. We find that binding of Gβγ to NF1 inhibits its ability to  inactivate Ras. Deletion of NF1 in striatal neurons prevents the  opioid-receptor-induced activation of Ras and eliminates its coupling to  Akt-mTOR-signaling pathway. By acting in the striatal medium spiny neurons of  the direct pathway, NF1 regulates opioid-induced changes in Ras activity,  thereby sensitizing mice to psychomotor and rewarding effects of morphine. These  results delineate a novel mechanism of GPCR signaling to Ras pathways and  establish a critical role of NF1 in opioid addiction.  Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Active G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) conformations not only are promoted by  agonists but also occur in their absence, leading to constitutive activity.  Association of GPCRs with intracellular protein partners might be one of the  mechanisms underlying GPCR constitutive activity. Here, we show that serotonin 5  hydroxytryptamine 6 (5-HT6) receptor constitutively activates the Gs/adenylyl  cyclase pathway in various cell types, including neurons. Constitutive activity  is strongly reduced by silencing expression of the Ras-GTPase activating protein  (Ras-GAP) neurofibromin, a 5-HT6 receptor partner. Neurofibromin is a  multidomain protein encoded by the NF1 gene, the mutation of which causes  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a genetic disorder characterized by multiple  benign and malignant nervous system tumors and cognitive deficits. Disrupting  association of 5-HT6 receptor with neurofibromin Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain  also inhibits receptor constitutive activity, and PH domain expression rescues  5-HT6 receptor-operated cAMP signaling in neurofibromin-deficient cells.  Furthermore, PH domains carrying mutations identified in NF1 patients that  prevent interaction with the 5-HT6 receptor fail to rescue receptor constitutive  activity in neurofibromin-depleted cells. Further supporting a role of  neurofibromin in agonist-independent Gs signaling elicited by native receptors,  the phosphorylation of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) is  strongly decreased in prefrontal cortex of Nf1+/- mice compared with WT mice.  Moreover, systemic administration of a 5-HT6 receptor inverse agonist reduces  CREB phosphorylation in prefrontal cortex of WT mice but not Nf1+/- mice.  Collectively, these findings suggest that disrupting 5-HT6  receptor-neurofibromin interaction prevents agonist-independent 5-HT6  receptor-operated cAMP signaling in prefrontal cortex, an effect that might  underlie neuronal abnormalities in NF1 patients.

Comment in     Neurology. 87(23):2389.  OBJECTIVE: To determine whether tumor size is associated with retinal nerve  fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, a measure of axonal degeneration and an  established biomarker of visual impairment in children with optic pathway  gliomas (OPGs) secondary to neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). METHODS: Children with NF1-OPGs involving the optic nerve (extension into the  chiasm and tracts permitted) who underwent both volumetric MRI analysis and  optical coherence tomography (OCT) within 2 weeks of each other were included.  Volumetric measurement of the entire anterior visual pathway (AVP; optic nerve,  chiasm, and tract) was performed using high-resolution T1-weighted MRI. OCT  measured the average RNFL thickness around the optic nerve. Linear regression  models evaluated the relationship between RNFL thickness and AVP dimensions and  volume. RESULTS: Thirty-eight participants contributed 55 study eyes. The mean age was  5.78 years. Twenty-two participants (58%) were female. RNFL thickness had a  significant negative relationship to total AVP volume and total brain volume (p  < 0.05, all comparisons). For every 1 mL increase in AVP volume, RNFL thickness  declined by approximately 5 microns. A greater AVP volume of OPGs involving the  optic nerve and chiasm, but not the tracts, was independently associated with a  lower RNFL thickness (p < 0.05). All participants with an optic chiasm volume  >1.3 mL demonstrated axonal damage (i.e., RNFL thickness <80 microns). CONCLUSIONS: Greater OPG and AVP volume predicts axonal degeneration, a  biomarker of vision loss, in children with NF1-OPGs. MRI volumetric measures may  help stratify the risk of visual loss from NF1-OPGs.  © 2016 American Academy of Neurology.

TOPIC: Children and adults with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a common  autosomal dominant condition, manifest a variety of ophthalmologic conditions.  Plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) involving the eyelid, orbit, periorbital, and  facial structures (orbital-periorbital plexiform neurofibroma [OPPN]) can result  in significant visual loss in children. Equally important, OPPNs can cause  significant alteration in physical appearance secondary to proptosis, ptosis,  and facial disfigurement, leading to social embarrassment and decreased  self-esteem. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Although NF1 is a relatively common disease in which routine  ophthalmologic examinations are required, no formal recommendations for clinical  care of children with OPPNs exist. Although medical and surgical interventions  have been reported, there are no agreed-on criteria for when OPPNs require  therapy and which treatment produces the best outcome. METHODS: Because a multidisciplinary team of specialists (oculofacial plastics,  pediatric ophthalmology, neuro-ophthalmology, medical genetics, and  neuro-oncology) direct management decisions, the absence of a uniform outcome  measure that represents visual or aesthetic sequelae complicates the design of  evidence-based studies and feasible clinical trials. RESULTS: In September 2013, a multidisciplinary task force, composed of  pediatric practitioners from tertiary care centers experienced in caring for  children with OPPN, was convened to address the lack of clinical care guidelines  for children with OPPN. CONCLUSIONS: This consensus statement provides recommendations for  ophthalmologic monitoring, outlines treatment indications and forthcoming  biologic therapy, and discusses challenges to performing clinical trials in this  complicated condition.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive tumors with low  survival rates and the leading cause of death in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)  patients under 40 years old. Surgical resection is the standard of care for  MPNSTs, but is often incomplete and can generate loss of function, necessitating  the development of novel treatment methods for this patient population. Here, we  describe a novel combination therapy comprising MEK inhibition and  nanoparticle-based photothermal therapy (PTT) for MPNSTs. MEK inhibitors block  activity driven by Ras, an oncogene constitutively activated in NF1-associated  MPNSTs, while PTT serves as a minimally invasive method to ablate cancer cells.  Our rationale for combining these seemingly disparate techniques for MPNSTs is  based on several reports demonstrating the efficacy of systemic chemotherapy  with local PTT. We combine the MEK inhibitor, PD-0325901 (PD901), with Prussian  blue nanoparticles (PBNPs) as PTT agents, to block MEK activity and  simultaneously ablate MPNSTs. Our data demonstrate the synergistic effect of  combining PD901 with PBNP-based PTT, which converge through the Ras pathway to  generate apoptosis, necrosis, and decreased proliferation, thereby mitigating  tumor growth and increasing survival of MPNST-bearing animals. Our results  suggest the potential of this novel local-systemic combination  ""nanochemotherapy"" for treating patients with MPNSTs.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the specificity of the current clinical diagnostic  criteria for neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) relative to the requirement for  unilateral vestibular schwannoma (VS) and at least 2 other NF2-related tumors. METHODS: We interrogated our Manchester NF2 database, which contained 205  individuals meeting NF2 criteria who initially presented with a unilateral VS.  Of these, 83 (40.7%) went on to develop a contralateral VS. We concentrated our  genetic analysis on a group of 70 who initially fulfilled NF2 criteria with a  unilateral vestibular schwannoma and at least 2 additional nonintradermal  schwannomas. RESULTS: Overall, 5/70 (7%) individuals with unilateral VS and at least 2 other  schwannomas had a pathogenic or likely pathogenic LZTR1 mutation. Twenty of the  70 subsequently developed bilateral disease. Of the remaining 50, 5 (10%) had a  germline LZTR1 mutation, equivalent to the number (n = 5) with a germline NF2  mutation. CONCLUSIONS: The most common etiology for unilateral VS and 2 additional  NF2-associated tumors in this cohort was mosaic NF2. Germline LZTR1 and germline  NF2 mutations were equally common in our cohort. This indicates that LZTR1 must  be considered when making a diagnosis of NF2 in the presence of unilateral VS in  individuals without a germline NF2 mutation.  © 2016 American Academy of Neurology.

During nervous system development, neurons and their progenitors migrate to  their final destinations. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the bilateral Q neuroblasts  and their descendants migrate long distances in opposite directions, despite  being born in the same posterior region. QR on the right migrates anteriorly and  generates the AQR neuron positioned near the head, and QL on the left migrates  posteriorly, giving rise to the PQR neuron positioned near the tail. In a screen  for genes required for AQR and PQR migration, we identified an allele of nfm-1,  which encodes a molecule similar to vertebrate NF2/Merlin, an important tumor  suppressor in humans. Mutations in NF2 lead to neurofibromatosis type II,  characterized by benign tumors of glial tissues. Here we demonstrate that in C.  elegans, nfm-1 is required for the ability of Q cells and their descendants to  extend protrusions and to migrate, but is not required for direction of  migration. Using a combination of mosaic analysis and cell-specific expression,  we show that NFM-1 is required nonautonomously, possibly in muscles, to promote  Q lineage migrations. We also show a genetic interaction between nfm-1 and the  C. elegans Slit homolog slt-1, which encodes a conserved secreted guidance cue.  Our results suggest that NFM-1 might be involved in the generation of an  extracellular cue that promotes Q neuroblast protrusion and migration that acts  with or in parallel to SLT-1 In vertebrates, NF2 and Slit2 interact in axon  pathfinding, suggesting a conserved interaction of NF2 and Slit2 in regulating  migratory events.

THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX: The polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is a histone  methyltransferase complex known to repress gene expression. There is a large  body of experimental evidence that supports its role in promoting tumorigenicity  by suppressing tumor suppressor genes. Here, we discuss the surprising findings  that, in neurofibromas, it may have a completely different role as a tumor  suppressor; mutations of PRC2 lead to conversion of benign neurofibromas into  malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) by de-repressing and thereby  activating genes driving cell growth and development. These findings have  potentially powerful clinical applications in both diagnosing and treating  MPNSTs. HYPOTHESIS: PRC2 loss drives malignant transformation of neurofibromas.

Schwannomatosis is characterized by the predisposition to develop multiple  schwannomas and, less commonly, meningiomas. Despite the clinical overlap with  neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), schwannomatosis is not caused by germline NF2  gene mutations. Instead, germline mutations of either the SMARCB1 or LZTR1  tumour suppressor genes have been identified in 86% of familial and 40% of  sporadic schwannomatosis patients. In contrast to patients with rhabdoid  tumours, which are due to complete loss-of-function SMARCB1 mutations,  individuals with schwannomatosis harbour predominantly hypomorphic SMARCB1  mutations which give rise to the synthesis of mutant proteins with residual  function that do not cause rhabdoid tumours. Although biallelic mutations of  SMARCB1 or LZTR1 have been detected in the tumours of patients with  schwannomatosis, the classical two-hit model of tumorigenesis is insufficient to  account for schwannoma growth, since NF2 is also frequently inactivated in these  tumours. Consequently, tumorigenesis in schwannomatosis must involve the  mutation of at least two different tumour suppressor genes, an occurrence  frequently mediated by loss of heterozygosity of large parts of chromosome 22q  harbouring not only SMARCB1 and LZTR1 but also NF2. Thus, schwannomatosis is  paradigmatic for a tumour predisposition syndrome caused by the concomitant  mutational inactivation of two or more tumour suppressor genes. This review  provides an overview of current models of tumorigenesis and mutational patterns  underlying schwannomatosis that will ultimately help to explain the complex  clinical presentation of this rare disease.

(2)Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis,  MO 63110 gutmannd@wustl.edu.  Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) develop low-grade brain tumors  throughout the optic pathway. Nearly 50% of children with optic pathway gliomas  (OPGs) experience visual impairment, and few regain their vision after  chemotherapy. Recent studies have revealed that girls with optic nerve gliomas  are five times more likely to lose vision and require treatment than boys. To  determine the mechanism underlying this sexually dimorphic difference in  clinical outcome, we leveraged Nf1 optic glioma (Nf1-OPG) mice. We demonstrate  that female Nf1-OPG mice exhibit greater retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss and  only females have retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning, despite mice of  both sexes harboring tumors of identical volumes and proliferation. Female  gonadal sex hormones are responsible for this sexual dimorphism, as ovariectomy,  but not castration, of Nf1-OPG mice normalizes RGC survival and RNFL thickness.  In addition, female Nf1-OPG mice have threefold more microglia than their male  counterparts, and minocycline inhibition of microglia corrects the retinal  pathology. Moreover, pharmacologic inhibition of microglial estrogen receptor-β  (ERβ) function corrects the retinal abnormalities in female Nf1-OPG mice.  Collectively, these studies establish that female gonadal sex hormones underlie  the sexual dimorphic differences in Nf1 optic glioma-induced retinal dysfunction  by operating at the level of tumor-associated microglial activation.  © 2017 Toonen et al.

Glioblastomas (GBM) are very difficult to treat and their aggressiveness is one  of the main reasons for this as well as for the frequent recurrences. MicroRNAs  post-transcriptionally regulate their target genes through interaction between  their seed sequence and 3'UTR of the target mRNAs. We previously reported that  miR-296-3p is regulated by neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) and enhances the  invasiveness of GBM cells via SOCS2/STAT3. In this study, we investigated  whether miR-296-5p, which originates from the same precursor miRNA as  miR-296-3p, can increase the invasiveness of GBM cells. It was observed that  miR-296-5p potentiated the invasion of various GBM cells including LN229, T98G,  and U87MG. Through bioinformatics approaches, two genes were identified as  miR-296-5p targets: caspase-8 (CASP8) and nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR).  From results obtained from Ago2 immunoprecipitation and luciferase assays, we  found that miR-296-5p downregulates CASP8 and NGFR through direct interaction  between seed sequence of the miRNA and 3'UTR of the target mRNA. Knockdown of  CASP8 or NGFR also increased the invasive ability of GBM cells, indicating that  CASP8 and NGFR are involved in potentiation of invasiveness by miR-296-5p.  Consistent with our findings, CASP8 was downregulated in brain metastatic lung  cancer cells, which have a high level of miR-296-5p, compared to parental cells,  suggesting that miR-296-5p may be generally associated with the acquisition of  invasiveness. Collectively, our results implicate miR-296-5p as a potential  cause of invasiveness in cancer and suggest it as a promising therapeutic target  for GBM.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: It has been a challenge to identify liver tumor suppressors  or oncogenes due to the genetic heterogeneity of these tumors. We performed a  genome-wide screen to identify suppressors of liver tumor formation in mice,  using CRISPR-mediated genome editing. METHODS: We performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-based knockout screen of  P53-null mouse embryonic liver progenitor cells that overexpressed MYC. We  infected p53-/-;Myc;Cas9 hepatocytes with the mGeCKOa lentiviral library of  67,000 single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs), targeting 20,611 mouse genes, and  transplanted the transduced cells subcutaneously into nude mice. Within 1 month,  all the mice that received the sgRNA library developed subcutaneous tumors. We  performed high-throughput sequencing of tumor DNA and identified sgRNAs  increased at least 8-fold compared to the initial cell pool. To validate the top  10 candidate tumor suppressors from this screen, we collected data from patients  with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using the Cancer Genome Atlas and COSMIC  databases. We used CRISPR to inactivate candidate tumor suppressor genes in  p53-/-;Myc;Cas9 cells and transplanted them subcutaneously into nude mice; tumor  formation was monitored and tumors were analyzed by histology and  immunohistochemistry. Mice with liver-specific disruption of p53 were given  hydrodynamic tail-vein injections of plasmids encoding Myc and sgRNA/Cas9  designed to disrupt candidate tumor suppressors; growth of tumors and metastases  was monitored. We compared gene expression profiles of liver cells with vs  without tumor suppressor gene disrupted by sgRNA/Cas9. Genes found to be  up-regulated after tumor suppressor loss were examined in liver cancer cell  lines; their expression was knocked down using small hairpin RNAs, and tumor  growth was examined in nude mice. Effects of the MEK inhibitors AZD6244, U0126,  and trametinib, or the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib, were examined in human  and mouse HCC cell lines. RESULTS: We identified 4 candidate liver tumor suppressor genes not previously  associated with liver cancer (Nf1, Plxnb1, Flrt2, and B9d1). CRISPR-mediated  knockout of Nf1, a negative regulator of RAS, accelerated liver tumor formation  in mice. Loss of Nf1 or activation of RAS up-regulated the liver progenitor cell  markers HMGA2 and SOX9. RAS pathway inhibitors suppressed the activation of the  Hmga2 and Sox9 genes that resulted from loss of Nf1 or oncogenic activation of  RAS. Knockdown of HMGA2 delayed formation of xenograft tumors from cells that  expressed oncogenic RAS. In human HCCs, low levels of NF1 messenger RNA or high  levels of HMGA2 messenger RNA were associated with shorter patient survival  time. Liver cancer cells with inactivation of Plxnb1, Flrt2, and B9d1 formed  more tumors in mice and had increased levels of mitogen-activated protein kinase  phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: Using a CRISPR-based strategy, we identified Nf1, Plxnb1, Flrt2,  and B9d1 as suppressors of liver tumor formation. We validated the observation  that RAS signaling, via mitogen-activated protein kinase, contributes to  formation of liver tumors in mice. We associated decreased levels of NF1 and  increased levels of its downstream protein HMGA2 with survival times of patients  with HCC. Strategies to inhibit or reduce HMGA2 might be developed to treat  patients with liver cancer.  Copyright © 2017 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of lovastatin on visuospatial learning and  attention for treating cognitive and behavioral deficits in children with  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). METHODS: A multicenter, international, randomized, double-blind,  placebo-controlled trial was conducted between July 2009 and May 2014 as part of  the NF Clinical Trials Consortium. Children with NF1 aged 8-15 years were  screened for visuospatial learning or attention deficits (n = 272); 146 children  demonstrated deficits at baseline and were randomly assigned to lovastatin (n =  74; 40 mg/d) or placebo (n = 70). Treatment was administered once daily for 16  weeks. Primary outcomes were total errors on the Cambridge Neuropsychological  Test Automated Battery Paired Associate Learning task (visuospatial learning)  and the Score subtest from the Test of Everyday Attention for Children  (sustained attention). Secondary outcomes measured executive function,  attention, visuospatial skills, behavior, and quality of life. Primary analyses  were performed on the intention-to-treat population. RESULTS: Lovastatin had no significant effect on primary outcomes after 16 weeks  of treatment: visuospatial learning (Cohen d = -0.15, 95% confidence interval  -0.47 to 0.18) or sustained attention (Cohen d = 0.19, 95% confidence interval  -0.14 to 0.53). Lovastatin was well tolerated, with no increase in reported  adverse events compared to placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Lovastatin administered once daily for 16 weeks did not improve  visuospatial learning or attention in children with NF1 and is not recommended  for amelioration of cognitive deficits in this population. CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov  (NCT00853580) and Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry  (ACTRN12607000560493). CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class I evidence that for  children with NF1, lovastatin does not improve visuospatial learning or  attention deficits.  © 2016 American Academy of Neurology.

Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is one of the most common genetic disorders and is  caused by mutations in the NF1 gene. NF1 gene mutational analysis presents a  considerable challenge because of its large size, existence of highly homologous  pseudogenes located throughout the human genome, absence of mutational hotspots,  and diversity of mutations types, including deep intronic splicing mutations. We  aimed to evaluate the use of hybridization capture-based next-generation  sequencing to screen coding and noncoding NF1 regions. Hybridization  capture-based next-generation sequencing, with genomic DNA as starting material,  was used to sequence the whole NF1 gene (exons and introns) from 11 unrelated  individuals and 1 relative, who all had NF1. All of them met the NF1 clinical  diagnostic criteria. We showed a mutation detection rate of 91% (10 out of 11).  We identified eight recurrent and two novel mutations, which were all confirmed  by Sanger methodology. In the Sanger sequencing confirmation, we also included  another three relatives with NF1. Splicing alterations accounted for 50% of the  mutations. One of them was caused by a deep intronic mutation (c.1260 + 1604A >  G). Frameshift truncation and missense mutations corresponded to 30% and 20% of  the pathogenic variants, respectively. In conclusion, we show the use of a  simple and fast approach to screen, at once, the entire NF1 gene (exons and  introns) for different types of pathogenic variations, including the deep  intronic splicing mutations.

BACKGROUND: Effective medical therapies are lacking for the treatment of  neurofibromatosis type 1-related plexiform neurofibromas, which are  characterized by elevated RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. METHODS: We conducted a phase 1 trial of selumetinib (AZD6244 or ARRY-142886),  an oral selective inhibitor of MAPK kinase (MEK) 1 and 2, in children who had  neurofibromatosis type 1 and inoperable plexiform neurofibromas to determine the  maximum tolerated dose and to evaluate plasma pharmacokinetics. Selumetinib was  administered twice daily at a dose of 20 to 30 mg per square meter of  body-surface area on a continuous dosing schedule (in 28-day cycles). We also  tested selumetinib using a mouse model of neurofibromatosis type 1-related  neurofibroma. Response to treatment (i.e., an increase or decrease from baseline  in the volume of plexiform neurofibromas) was monitored by using volumetric  magnetic resonance imaging analysis to measure the change in size of the  plexiform neurofibroma. RESULTS: A total of 24 children (median age, 10.9 years; range, 3.0 to 18.5)  with a median tumor volume of 1205 ml (range, 29 to 8744) received selumetinib.  Patients were able to receive selumetinib on a long-term basis; the median  number of cycles was 30 (range, 6 to 56). The maximum tolerated dose was 25 mg  per square meter (approximately 60% of the recommended adult dose). The most  common toxic effects associated with selumetinib included acneiform rash,  gastrointestinal effects, and asymptomatic creatine kinase elevation. The  results of pharmacokinetic evaluations of selumetinib among the children in this  trial were similar to those published for adults. Treatment with selumetinib  resulted in confirmed partial responses (tumor volume decreases from baseline of  ≥20%) in 17 of the 24 children (71%) and decreases from baseline in neurofibroma  volume in 12 of 18 mice (67%). Disease progression (tumor volume increase from  baseline of ≥20%) has not been observed to date. Anecdotal evidence of decreases  in tumor-related pain, disfigurement, and functional impairment was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our early-phase data suggested that children with neurofibromatosis  type 1 and inoperable plexiform neurofibromas benefited from long-term  dose-adjusted treatment with selumetinib without having excess toxic effects.

Erratum in     Neuro Oncol. 2017 Jun 1;19(6):876-877. doi: 10.1093/neuonc/nox045.  BACKGROUND: Optic gliomas arising in the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) cancer  predisposition syndrome cause reduced visual acuity in 30%-50% of affected  children. Since human specimens are rare, genetically engineered mouse (GEM)  models have been successfully employed for preclinical therapeutic discovery and  validation. However, the sequence of cellular and molecular events that  culminate in retinal dysfunction and vision loss has not been fully defined  relevant to potential neuroprotective treatment strategies. METHODS: Nf1flox/mut GFAP-Cre (FMC) mice and age-matched Nf1flox/flox (FF)  controls were euthanized at defined intervals from 2 weeks to 24 weeks of age.  Optic nerve volumes were measured, and optic nerves/retinae analyzed by  immunohistochemistry. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed on  anesthetized mice. FMC mice were treated with lovastatin from 12 to 16 weeks of  age. RESULTS: The earliest event in tumorigenesis was a persistent elevation in  proliferation (4 wk), which preceded sustained microglia numbers and incremental  increases in S100+ glial cells. Microglia activation, as evidenced by increased  interleukin (IL)-1β expression and morphologic changes, coincided with axonal  injury and retinal ganglion cell (RGC) apoptosis (6 wk). RGC loss and retinal  nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning then ensued (9 wk), as revealed by direct  measurements and live-animal OCT. Lovastatin administration at 12 weeks  prevented further RGC loss and RNFL thinning both immediately and 8 weeks after  treatment completion. CONCLUSION: By defining the chronology of the cellular and molecular events  associated with optic glioma pathogenesis, we demonstrate critical periods for  neuroprotective intervention and visual preservation, as well as establish OCT  as an accurate biomarker of RGC loss.  © The Author(s) 2016.

We wanted to implement an NGS strategy to globally analyze hereditary cancer  with diagnostic quality while retaining the same degree of understanding and  control we had in pre-NGS strategies. To do this, we developed the I2HCP panel,  a custom bait library covering 122 hereditary cancer genes. We improved bait  design, tested different NGS platforms and created a clinically driven custom  data analysis pipeline. The I2HCP panel was developed using a training set of  hereditary colorectal cancer, hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and  neurofibromatosis patients and reached an accuracy, analytical sensitivity and  specificity greater than 99%, which was maintained in a validation set. I2HCP  changed our diagnostic approach, involving clinicians and a genetic diagnostics  team from panel design to reporting. The new strategy improved diagnostic  sensitivity, solved uncertain clinical diagnoses and identified mutations in new  genes. We assessed the genetic variation in the complete set of hereditary  cancer genes, revealing a complex variation landscape that coexists with the  disease-causing mutation. We developed, validated and implemented a custom  NGS-based strategy for hereditary cancer diagnostics that improved our previous  workflows. Additionally, the existence of a rich genetic variation in hereditary  cancer genes favors the use of this panel to investigate their role in cancer  risk.

The variable manifestation of phenotypes that occur in patients with  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) includes benign and malignant neurocutaneous  tumors for which no adequate treatment exists. Cell-based screening of known  bioactive compounds library identified the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)  inhibitor Cantharidin and the L-type calcium channel blocker Nifedipine as  potential candidates for NF1 pharmacotherapy. Validation of screening results  using human NF1-associated malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) cells  showed that Cantharidin effectively impeded MPNST cell growth, while Nifedipine  treatment significantly decreased local tumor growth in an MPNST xenograft  animal model. These data suggest that inhibitors of PP2A, as well as calcium  channel blockers, might be used in broader MPNST preclinical studies as single  agents or in combinatorial therapeutic strategies.

Ricker CA(1), Pan Y(2), Gutmann DH(2), Keller C(1).  Author information: (1)Children's Cancer Therapy Development Institute , Beaverton, OR , USA. (2)Washington University School of Medicine , St. Louis, MO , USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder that results  from germline mutations of the NF1 gene, creating a predisposition to low-grade  gliomas (LGGs; pilocytic astrocytoma) in young children. Insufficient data and  resources represent major challenges to identifying the best possible drug  therapies for children with this tumor. Herein, we summarize the currently  available cell lines, genetically engineered mouse models, and therapeutic  targets for these LGGs. Conspicuously absent are human tumor-derived cell lines  or patient-derived xenograft models for NF1-LGG. New collaborative initiatives  between patients and their families, research groups, and pharmaceutical  companies are needed to create transformative resources and broaden the  knowledge base relevant to identifying cooperating genetic drivers and possible  drug therapeutics for this common pediatric brain tumor.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are a type of rare sarcomas  with a poor prognosis due to its highly invasive nature and limited treatment  options. Currently there is no targeted-cancer therapy for this type of  malignancy. Thus, it is important to identify more cancer driver genes that may  serve as targets of cancer therapy. Through comparative oncogenomics, we have  found that KANK1 was a candidate tumor suppressor gene (TSG) for human MPNSTs.  Although KANK1 is known as a cytoskeleton regulator, its tumorigenic function in  MPNSTs remains largely unknown. In this study, we report that restoration of  KANK1 in human MPNST cells inhibits cell growth both in human cell culture and  xenograft mice by increasing apoptosis. Consistently, knockdown of KANK1 in  neurofibroma cells promoted cell growth. Using RNA-seq analysis, we identified  CXXC5 and other apoptosis-related genes, and demonstrated that CXXC5 is  regulated by KANK1. Knockdown of CXXC5 was found to diminish KANK1-induced  apoptosis in MPNST cells. Thus, KANK1 inhibits MPNST cell growth though CXXC5  mediated apoptosis. Our results suggest that KANK1 may function as a tumor  suppressor in human MPNSTs, and thus it may be useful for targeted therapy.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common tumor-predisposition disorder due to  germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene NF1. A virtually pathognomonic  finding of NF1 is the plexiform neurofibroma (PN), a benign, likely congenital  tumor that arises from bi-allelic inactivation of NF1. PN can undergo  transformation to a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, an aggressive  soft-tissue sarcoma. To better understand the non-NF1 genetic contributions to  PN pathogenesis, we performed whole-exome sequencing, RNASeq profiling and  genome-wide copy-number determination for 23 low-passage Schwann cell cultures  established from surgical PN material with matching germline DNA. All resected  tumors were derived from routine debulking surgeries. None of the tumors were  considered at risk for malignant transformation at the time; for example, there  was no pain or rapid growth. Deep (~500X) NF1 exon sequencing was also conducted  on tumor DNA. Non-NF1 somatic mutation verification was performed using the  Ampliseq/IonTorrent platform. We identified 100% of the germline NF1 mutations  and found somatic NF1 inactivation in 74% of the PN. One individual with three  PNs had different NF1 somatic mutations in each tumor. The median number of  somatic mutations per sample, including NF1, was one (range 0-8). NF1 was the  only gene that was recurrently somatically inactivated in multiple tumors. Gene  Set Enrichment Analysis of transcriptome-wide tumor RNA sequencing identified  five significant (FDR<0.01) and seven trending (0.01⩽FDR<0.02) gene sets related  to DNA replication, telomere maintenance and elongation, cell cycle progression,  signal transduction and cell proliferation. We found no recurrent non-NF1 locus  copy-number variation in PN. This is the first multi-sample whole-exome and  whole-transcriptome sequencing study of NF1-associated PN. Taken together with  concurrent copy-number data, our comprehensive genetic analysis reveals the  primacy of NF1 loss as the driver of PN tumorigenesis.

Electronic address:  andrea.rasola@unipd.it.  Mutations in neurofibromin, a Ras GTPase-activating protein, lead to the tumor  predisposition syndrome neurofibromatosis type 1. Here, we report that cells  lacking neurofibromin exhibit enhanced glycolysis and decreased respiration in a  Ras/ERK-dependent way. In the mitochondrial matrix of neurofibromin-deficient  cells, a fraction of active ERK1/2 associates with succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)  and TRAP1, a chaperone that promotes the accumulation of the oncometabolite  succinate by inhibiting SDH. ERK1/2 enhances both formation of this multimeric  complex and SDH inhibition. ERK1/2 kinase activity is favored by the interaction  with TRAP1, and TRAP1 is, in turn, phosphorylated in an ERK1/2-dependent way.  TRAP1 silencing or mutagenesis at the serine residues targeted by ERK1/2  abrogates tumorigenicity, a phenotype that is reverted by addition of  a cell-permeable succinate analog. Our findings reveal that Ras/ERK signaling  controls the metabolic changes orchestrated by TRAP1 that have a key role in  tumor growth and are a promising target for anti-neoplastic strategies.

Loss or mutation of the tumour suppressor Merlin predisposes individuals to  develop multiple nervous system tumours, including schwannomas and meningiomas,  sporadically or as part of the autosomal dominant inherited condition  Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2). These tumours display largely low grade features but  their presence can lead to significant morbidity. Surgery and radiotherapy  remain the only treatment options despite years of research, therefore an  effective therapeutic is required. Unbiased omics studies have become pivotal in  the identification of differentially expressed genes and proteins that may act  as drug targets or biomarkers. Here we analysed the proteome and  phospho-proteome of these genetically defined tumours using primary human tumour  cells to identify upregulated/activated proteins and/or pathways. We identified  over 2000 proteins in comparative experiments between Merlin-deficient  schwannoma and meningioma compared to human Schwann and meningeal cells  respectively. Using functional enrichment analysis we highlighted several  dysregulated pathways and Gene Ontology terms. We identified several proteins  and phospho-proteins that are more highly expressed in tumours compared to  controls. Among proteins jointly dysregulated in both tumours we focused in  particular on PDZ and LIM domain protein 2 (PDLIM2) and validated its  overexpression in several tumour samples, while not detecting it in normal  cells. We showed that shRNA mediated knockdown of PDLIM2 in both primary  meningioma and schwannoma leads to significant reductions in cellular  proliferation. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive assessment of  the NF2-related meningioma and schwannoma proteome and phospho-proteome. Taken  together, our data highlight several commonly deregulated factors, and indicate  that PDLIM2 may represent a novel, common target for meningioma and schwannoma.  Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

BACKGROUND: We have identified molecules that exhibit synthetic lethality in  cells with loss of the neurofibromin 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor gene. However,  recognizing tumors that have inactivation of the NF1 tumor suppressor function  is challenging because the loss may occur via mechanisms that do not involve  mutation of the genomic locus. Degradation of the NF1 protein, independent of  NF1 mutation status, phenocopies inactivating mutations to drive tumors in human  glioma cell lines. NF1 inactivation may alter the transcriptional landscape of a  tumor and allow a machine learning classifier to detect which tumors will  benefit from synthetic lethal molecules. RESULTS: We developed a strategy to predict tumors with low NF1 activity and  hence tumors that may respond to treatments that target cells lacking NF1. Using  RNAseq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we trained an ensemble of 500  logistic regression classifiers that integrates mutation status with whole  transcriptomes to predict NF1 inactivation in glioblastoma (GBM). On TCGA data,  the classifier detected NF1 mutated tumors (test set area under the receiver  operating characteristic curve (AUROC) mean = 0.77, 95% quantile = 0.53 - 0.95)  over 50 random initializations. On RNA-Seq data transformed into the space of  gene expression microarrays, this method produced a classifier with similar  performance (test set AUROC mean = 0.77, 95% quantile = 0.53 - 0.96). We applied  our ensemble classifier trained on the transformed TCGA data to a microarray  validation set of 12 samples with matched RNA and NF1 protein-level  measurements. The classifier's NF1 score was associated with NF1 protein  concentration in these samples. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that TCGA can be used to train accurate predictors  of NF1 inactivation in GBM. The ensemble classifier performed well for samples  with very high or very low NF1 protein concentrations but had mixed performance  in samples with intermediate NF1 concentrations. Nevertheless, high-performing  and validated predictors have the potential to be paired with targeted therapies  and personalized medicine.

Neurofibromatosis type 2 is characterized by bilateral vestibular schwannomas,  which are benign tumors that originate from the nerve sheath and damage the  nerve as they grow, causing neurological dysfunction such as hearing loss.  Current standard radiation therapy can further augment hearing loss by inducing  local damage to mature nerve tissue. Treatment with bevacizumab, a Vascular  Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)-specific antibody, is associated with tumor  control and hearing improvement in NF2 patients; however, its effect is not  durable and its mechanism of action on improving nerve function is unknown.  Anti-VEGF treatment can normalize the tumor vasculature, improving vessel  perfusion and delivery of oxygen. It is known that oxygen is a potent  radiosensitizer; therefore, combining anti-VEGF treatment with radiation therapy  can achieve better tumor control and allow for the use of lower radiation doses,  thus minimizing treatment-related neurological toxicity.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is an inherited, multi-system, tumour  suppressor disorder with variable complications that cause psychological  distress and social isolation. The study aim was to develop and validate a  disease-specific questionnaire to measure quality of life (QOL) in NF1 that is  suitable both as an assessment tool in clinical practice and in clinical trials  of novel therapy. METHODS: The Impact of NF1 on Quality of Life (INF1-QOL) questionnaire was  developed by a literature search for common terms, focus group (n = 6),  semi-structured interviews (n = 21), initial drafts (n =50) and final 14 item  questionnaire (n = 50). Bivariate correlations between items, exploratory factor  analysis, correlations with severity and EuroQol were employed. RESULTS: INF1-QOL showed good internal reliability (Cronbach's alpha 0.87), mean  total INF1-QOL score was 8.64 (SD 6.3), median 7.00, range 0-30 (possible range  0-42); no significant correlations with age or gender. The mean total EuroQol  score was 7.38 (SD 2.87), median 6.5, mean global EuroQol score was 76.34 (SD  16.56), median 80. Total INF1-QOL score correlated with total EuroQol r = 0.82,  p < 0.0001. The highest impact on QOL was moderate or severe problems with  anxiety and depression (32%) and negative effects of NF1 on role and outlook on  life (42%). The mean inter-relater reliability for grading of clinical severity  scores was 0.71 (range 0.65-0.79), and intra-class correlation was 0.92. The  mean clinical severity score was 1.95 (SD 0.65) correlating r = 0.34 with total  INF1-QOL score p < 0.05 and correlated 0.37 with total EuroQol score p < 0.01.  The clinical severity score was mild in 17 (34%), moderate in 16 (32%) and 17  (34%) individuals had severe disease. CONCLUSIONS: INF1-QOL is a validated, reliable disease specific questionnaire  that is easy and quick to complete. Role and outlook on life and anxiety and  depression have the highest impact on QOL indicating the variability, severity  and unpredictability of NF1. INFI-QOL correlates moderately with clinical  severity. The moderate relationship between INF1-QOL and physician rated  severity emphasizes the difference between clinical and patient perception.  INFI-QOL will be useful in individual patient assessment and as an outcome  measure for clinical trials.

Meningiomas are mostly benign brain tumours, with a potential for becoming  atypical or malignant. On the basis of comprehensive genomic, transcriptomic and  epigenomic analyses, we compared benign meningiomas to atypical ones. Here, we  show that the majority of primary (de novo) atypical meningiomas display loss of  NF2, which co-occurs either with genomic instability or recurrent SMARCB1  mutations. These tumours harbour increased H3K27me3 signal and a hypermethylated  phenotype, mainly occupying the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) binding  sites in human embryonic stem cells, thereby phenocopying a more primitive  cellular state. Consistent with this observation, atypical meningiomas exhibit  upregulation of EZH2, the catalytic subunit of the PRC2 complex, as well as the  E2F2 and FOXM1 transcriptional networks. Importantly, these primary atypical  meningiomas do not harbour TERT promoter mutations, which have been reported in  atypical tumours that progressed from benign ones. Our results establish the  genomic landscape of primary atypical meningiomas and potential therapeutic  targets.

Macrophages are abundant in neurofibromas, and macrophage targeted  interventions may have therapeutic potential in these tumors. We generated gene  expression data from fluorescence-activated cell sorted (FACS) SCs and  macrophages from wild-type and mutant nerve and neurofibroma to identify  candidate pathways involved in SC-macrophage cross-talk. While in 1-month-old  Nf1 mutant nerve neither SCs nor macrophages significantly differed from their  normal counterparts, both macrophages and SCs showed significantly altered  cytokine gene expression in neurofibromas. Computationally reconstructed  SC-macrophage molecular networks were enriched for inflammation-associated  pathways. We verified that neurofibroma SC conditioned medium contains  macrophage chemo-attractants including colony stimulation factor 1 (CSF1).  Network analysis confirmed previously implicated pathways and predict novel  paracrine and autocrine loops involving cytokines, chemokines, and growth  factors. Network analysis also predicted a central role for decreased type-I  interferon signaling. We validated type-I interferon expression in neurofibroma  by protein profiling, and show that treatment of neurofibroma-bearing mice with  polyethylene glycolyated (PEGylated) type-I interferon-α2b reduces the  expression of many cytokines overexpressed in neurofibroma. These studies reveal  numerous potential targetable interactions between Nf1 mutant SCs and  macrophages for further analyses.

The future of precision medicine is heavily reliant on the use of human tissues  to identify the key determinants that account for differences between  individuals with the same disorder. This need is exemplified by the  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) neurogenetic condition. As such, individuals with  NF1 are born with a germline mutation in the NF1 gene, but may develop numerous  distinct neurological problems, ranging from autism and attention deficit to  brain and peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Coupled with accurate preclinical  mouse models, the availability of NF1 patient-derived induced pluripotent stem  cells (iPSCs) provides new opportunities to define the critical factors that  underlie NF1-associated nervous system disease pathogenesis and progression. In  this review, we discuss the generation and potential applications of iPSC  technology to the study of NF1.  Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Electronic address: nancy.ratner@cchmc.org.  The RASopathy neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common autosomal  dominant genetic disorders. In NF1 patients, neurological issues may result from  damaged myelin, and mice with a neurofibromin gene (Nf1) mutation show white  matter (WM) defects including myelin decompaction. Using mouse genetics, we find  that altered Nf1 gene-dose in mature oligodendrocytes results in progressive  myelin defects and behavioral abnormalities mediated by aberrant Notch  activation. Blocking Notch, upstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), or  nitric oxide signaling rescues myelin defects in hemizygous Nf1 mutants, and  pharmacological gamma secretase inhibition rescues aberrant behavior with no  effects in wild-type (WT) mice. Concomitant pathway inhibition rescues myelin  abnormalities in homozygous mutants. Notch activation is also observed in Nf1+/-  mouse brains, and cells containing active Notch are increased in NF1 patient WM.  We thus identify Notch as an Nf1 effector regulating myelin structure and  behavior in a RASopathy and suggest that inhibition of Notch signaling may be a  therapeutic strategy for NF1.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1, OMIM 162200), caused by NF1 gene mutations,  exhibits multi-system abnormalities, including skeletal deformities in humans.  Osteocytes play critical roles in controlling bone modeling and remodeling.  However, the role of neurofibromin, the protein product of the NF1 gene, in  osteocytes is largely unknown. This study investigated the role of neurofibromin  in osteocytes by disrupting Nf1 under the Dmp1-promoter. The conditional  knockout (Nf1 cKO) mice displayed serum profile of a metabolic bone disorder  with an osteomalacia-like bone phenotype. Serum FGF23 levels were 4 times  increased in cKO mice compared with age-matched controls. In addition,  calcium-phosphorus metabolism was significantly altered (calcium reduced;  phosphorus reduced; parathyroid hormone [PTH] increased; 1,25(OH)2 D decreased).  Bone histomorphometry showed dramatically increased osteoid parameters,  including osteoid volume, surface, and thickness. Dynamic bone histomorphometry  revealed reduced bone formation rate and mineral apposition rate in the cKO  mice. TRAP staining showed a reduced osteoclast number. Micro-CT demonstrated  thinner and porous cortical bones in the cKO mice, in which osteocyte dendrites  were disorganized as assessed by electron microscopy. Interestingly, the cKO  mice exhibited spontaneous fractures in long bones, as found in NF1 patients.  Mechanical testing of femora revealed significantly reduced maximum force and  stiffness. Immunohistochemistry showed significantly increased FGF23 protein in  the cKO bones. Moreover, primary osteocytes from cKO femora showed about  eightfold increase in FGF23 mRNA levels compared with control cells. The  upregulation of FGF23 was specifically and significantly inhibited by PI3K  inhibitor Ly294002, indicating upregulation of FGF23 through PI3K in  Nf1-deficient osteocytes. Taken together, these results indicate that Nf1  deficiency in osteocytes dramatically increases FGF23 production and causes a  mineralization defect (ie, hyperosteoidosis) via the alteration of  calcium-phosphorus metabolism.

Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a genetic syndrome that predisposes  individuals to multiple benign tumors of the central and peripheral nervous  systems, including vestibular schwannomas. Currently, there are no FDA approved  drug therapies for NF2. Loss of function of merlin encoded by the NF2 tumor  suppressor gene leads to activation of multiple mitogenic signaling cascades,  including platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and SRC in Schwann  cells. The goal of this study was to determine whether ponatinib, an  FDA-approved ABL/SRC inhibitor, reduced proliferation and/or survival of  merlin-deficient human Schwann cells (HSC). Merlin-deficient HSC had higher  levels of phosphorylated PDGFRα/β, and SRC than merlin-expressing HSC. A similar  phosphorylation pattern was observed in phospho-protein arrays of human  vestibular schwannoma samples compared to normal HSC. Ponatinib reduced  merlin-deficient HSC viability in a dose-dependent manner by decreasing  phosphorylation of PDGFRα/β, AKT, p70S6K, MEK1/2, ERK1/2 and STAT3. These  changes were associated with decreased cyclin D1 and increased p27Kip1levels,  leading to a G1 cell-cycle arrest as assessed by Western blotting and flow  cytometry. Ponatinib did not modulate ABL, SRC, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), or  paxillin phosphorylation levels. These results suggest that ponatinib is a  potential therapeutic agent for NF2-associated schwannomas and warrants further  in vivo investigation.

Author information: (1)Division of Cancer and Genetics, Cardiff University, Heath Park, Cardiff,  CF14 4XN, UK.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1; MIM# 162200) is a familial cancer syndrome that  affects 1 in 3,500 individuals worldwide and is inherited in an autosomal  dominant fashion. Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors (MPNSTs) represent a  significant cause of morbidity and mortality in NF1 and currently there is no  treatment or definite prognostic biomarkers for these tumors. Telomere  shortening has been documented in numerous tumor types. Short dysfunctional  telomeres are capable of fusion and it is considered that the ensuing genomic  instability may facilitate clonal evolution and the progression to malignancy.  To evaluate the potential role of telomere dysfunction in NF1-associated tumors,  we undertook a comparative analysis of telomere length in samples derived from  10 cutaneous and 10 diffused plexiform neurofibromas, and 19 MPNSTs. Telomere  length was determined using high-resolution Single Telomere Length Analysis  (STELA). The mean Xp/Yp telomere length detected in MPNSTs, at 3.282 kb, was  significantly shorter than that observed in both plexiform neurofibromas (5.793  kb; [p = 0.0006]) and cutaneous neurofibromas (6.141 kb; [p = 0.0007]). The  telomere length distributions of MPNSTs were within the length-ranges in which  telomere fusion is detected and that confer a poor prognosis in other tumor  types. These data indicate that telomere length may play a role in driving  genomic instability and clonal progression in NF1-associated MPNSTs.

Inactivation of NF2/Merlin causes the autosomal-dominant cancer predisposition  syndrome familial neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) and contributes to the  development of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). To develop a targeted  therapy for NF2-mutant tumors, we have exploited the recent realization that  Merlin loss drives tumorigenesis by activating the E3 ubiquitin ligase  CRL4DCAF1, thereby inhibiting the Hippo pathway component Lats. Here, we show  that MLN4924, a NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor, suppresses CRL4DCAF1  and attenuates activation of YAP in NF2-mutant tumor cells. In addition, MLN4924  sensitizes MPM to traditional chemotherapy, presumably as a result of collateral  inhibition of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRL) involved in DNA repair.  However, even in combination with chemotherapy, MLN4924 does not exhibit  significant preclinical activity. Further analysis revealed that depletion of  DCAF1 or treatment with MLN4924 does not affect mTOR hyperactivation in  NF2-mutant tumor cells, suggesting that loss of Merlin activates mTOR  independently of CRL4DCAF1 Intriguingly, combining MLN4924 with the mTOR/PI3K  inhibitor GDC-0980 suppresses the growth of NF2-mutant tumor cells in vitro as  well as in mouse and patient-derived xenografts. These results provide  preclinical rationale for the use of NAE inhibitors in combination with  mTOR/PI3K inhibitors in NF2-mutant tumors.

Recent studies have shown that constitutive activation of extracellular  signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) in Schwann cells (SCs) increases  myelin thickness in transgenic mice. In this secondary analysis, we report that  these transgenic mice develop a postnatal corneal neurofibroma with the loss of  corneal transparency by age six months. We show that expansion of  non-myelinating SCs, under the control of activated ERK1/2, also drive  myofibroblast differentiation that derives from both SC precursors and resident  corneal keratocytes. Further, these mice also harbor activated mast cells in the  central cornea, which contributes to pathological corneal neovascularization and  fibrosis. This breach of corneal avascularity and immune status is associated  with the growth of the tumor pannus, resulting in a corneal stroma that is  nearly four times its normal size. In corneas with advanced disease, some axons  became ectopically myelinated, and the disruption of Remak bundles is evident.  To determine whether myofibroblast differentiation was linked to vimentin, we  examined the levels and phosphorylation status of this fibrotic biomarker.  Concomitant with the early upregulation of vimentin, a serine 38-phosphorylated  isoform of vimentin (pSer38vim) increased in SCs, which was attributed primarily  to the soluble fraction of protein-not the cytoskeletal portion. However, the  overexpressed pSer38vim became predominantly cytoskeletal with the growth of the  corneal tumor. Our findings demonstrate an unrecognized function of ERK1/2 in  the maintenance of corneal homeostasis, wherein its over-activation in SCs  promotes corneal neurofibromas. This study is also the first report of a  genetically engineered mouse that spontaneously develops a corneal tumor.  © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Effective  chemotherapy is not available. To characterize a therapeutic target for  treatment, we investigated the role of cellular retinoic acid binding protein 2  (CRABP2) in MPNST in vitro. CRABP2 is a transcriptional co-activator of retinoic  acid signaling. Although overexpression of CRABP2 is described in several  cancers, it has not yet been studied in MPNSTs. We investigated CRABP2  expression in cultured Schwann cells and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded  specimens of human peripheral nerve sheath tumors. A transient knockdown of  CRABP2 was established in human NF1-associated MPNST cell lines (S462, T265,  NSF1), and functional effects on viability, proliferation, apoptosis, and  cytotoxicity were monitored. Finally, a 45-pathway reporter assay was performed  in knockdown cells. Expression of CRABP2 was found in epithelium, fibroblasts,  and tumor Schwann cells of skin, neurofibromas, and MPNSTs. In contrast, normal  skin Schwann cells (NF1+/-, NF1-/-) did not express CRABP2. In the absence of  retinoic acid, MPNST cells depleted of CRABP2 had reduced viability and  proliferation, induction of apoptosis and cytotoxicity, and up-regulation of the  type 1 interferon pathway. These data suggest a retinoic acid-independent,  non-tumor suppressor role of CRABP2 for the survival of MPNST cells in vitro.  Targeting CRABP2 overexpression may represent a unique approach for the  treatment of human MPNSTs.  Copyright © 2017 American Society for Investigative Pathology. Published by  Elsevier Inc.

Low-grade gliomas are one of the most common brain tumors in children, where  they frequently form within the optic pathway (optic pathway gliomas; OPGs).  Since many OPGs occur in the context of the Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1)  cancer predisposition syndrome, we have previously employed Nf1  genetically-engineered mouse (GEM) strains to study the pathogenesis of these  low-grade glial neoplasms. In the light of the finding that human and mouse  low-grade gliomas are composed of Olig2+ cells and that Olig2+ oligodendrocyte  precursor cells (OPCs) give rise to murine high-grade gliomas, we sought to  determine whether Olig2+ OPCs could be tumor-initiating cells for Nf1 optic  glioma. Similar to the GFAP-Cre transgenic strain previously employed to  generate Nf1 optic gliomas, Olig2+ cells also give rise to astrocytes in the  murine optic nerve in vivo. However, in contrast to the GFAP-Cre strain where  somatic Nf1 inactivation in embryonic neural progenitor/stem cells (Nf1flox/mut;  GFAP-Cre mice) results in optic gliomas by 3 months of age in vivo, mice with  Nf1 gene inactivation in Olig2+ OPCs (Nf1flox/mut; Olig2-Cre mice) do not form  optic gliomas until 6 months of age. These distinct patterns of glioma latency  do not reflect differences in the timing or brain location of somatic Nf1 loss.  Instead, they most likely reflect the cell of origin, as somatic Nf1 loss in  CD133+ neural progenitor/stem cells during late embryogenesis results in optic  gliomas at 3 months of age. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the cell  of origin dictates the time to tumorigenesis in murine optic glioma.

Despite the growing knowledge of the genetic background behind the cancers that  occur in a context of hereditary predisposition, personal or family cancer  history may not be clear enough to support directional gene testing. Defined  targeted next-generation sequencing gene panels allow identification of the  causative disease mutations of multigene syndromes and differential diagnosis  for syndromes with phenotypically overlapping characteristics. Herein, we  established a next-generation sequencing analysis pipeline for the molecular  diagnosis of multiple inherited cancer predisposing syndromes using the  commercially available target sequencing panel TruSight Cancer. To establish the  analysis pipeline, we included 22 control samples with deleterious mutations  covering all genes currently analyzed at our institution by standard Sanger  sequencing. We tested the pipeline using 51 samples from patients with a  clinical diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), 10 of which without  previous molecular characterization of the causative NF1 mutations. We propose a  thoroughly validated analysis pipeline that combines Isaac Enrichment,  Burrows-Wheeler Aligner Enrichment, and NextGENe for the alignment and variant  calling, and GeneticistAssistant for variant annotation and prioritization. This  pipeline allowed the identification of disease-causing mutations in all 73  patients, including a large duplication of 37 bp in NF1. We show that high  sensitivity and specificity can be achieved by using multiple bioinformatic  tools for alignment and variant calling and careful variant filtering, having in  mind the clinical question.

Benign neurofibromas, the main phenotypic manifestations of the rare  neurological disorder neurofibromatosis type 1, degenerate to malignant tumors  associated to poor prognosis in about 10% of patients. Despite efforts in the  field of (epi)genomics, the lack of prognostic biomarkers with which to predict  disease evolution frustrates the adoption of appropriate early therapeutic  measures. To identify potential biomarkers of malignant neurofibroma  transformation, we integrated four human experimental studies and one for mouse,  using a gene score-based meta-analysis method, from which we obtained a  score-ranked signature of 579 genes. Genes with the highest absolute scores were  classified as promising disease biomarkers. By grouping genes with similar  neurofibromatosis-related profiles, we derived panels of potential biomarkers.  The addition of promoter methylation data to gene profiles indicated a panel of  genes probably silenced by hypermethylation. To identify possible therapeutic  treatments, we used the gene signature to query drug expression databases.  Trichostatin A and other histone deacetylase inhibitors, as well as cantharidin  and tamoxifen, were retrieved as putative therapeutic means to reverse the  aberrant regulation that drives to malignant cell proliferation and metastasis.  This in silico prediction corroborated reported experimental results that  suggested the inclusion of these compounds in clinical trials. This experimental  validation supported the suitability of the meta-analysis method used to  integrate several sources of public genomic information, and the reliability of  the gene signature associated to the malignant evolution of neurofibromas to  generate working hypotheses for prognostic and drug-responsive biomarkers or  therapeutic measures, thus showing the potential of this in silico approach for  biomarker discovery.

(2)Department of Pathology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis,  MO 63110, USA.  Dermal neurofibromas (DNFs) are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors thought to  originate from Schwann cell progenitors. These tumors represent one of the  hallmarks of the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) tumor predisposition syndrome,  where they can number in the thousands. While NF1-DNFs arise due to mutations in  the NF1 gene, the vast majority of DNFs occur sporadically (sp-DNFs), where the  genetic etiology is currently unknown. Herein, we employed whole-exome  sequencing of sp-DNFs to identify a recurrent mutation in the KIR2DL5 gene,  which codes for a protein suppressor of natural killer (NK) cell activity. While  the function of KIR2DL5 outside of the immune system is unknown, we identified a  KIR2DL5N173D mutation in three of nine sp-DNFs, resulting in loss of KIR2DL5  protein expression. In contrast, two of these subjects had unrelated tumors,  which retained KIR2DL5 protein expression. Moreover, loss of KIR2DL5 expression  was demonstrated in 15 of 45 independently-identified sp-DNFs. Consistent with  its potential role as a negative growth regulator important for neurofibroma  maintenance, ectopic KIR2DL5N173D expression in normal human Schwann cells  resulted in reduced KIR2DL5 expression and increased cell proliferation.  Similarly, KIR2DL5 short hairpin RNA knockdown (KD) decreased KIR2DL5 protein  levels and increased cell proliferation, as well as correlated with PDGFRβ and  downstream RAS/AKT/mTOR hyperactivation. Importantly, inhibition of PDGFRβ or  AKT/mTOR activity in KIR2DL5-KD human Schwann cells reduced proliferation to  control levels. Collectively, these findings establish KIR2DL5 as a new Schwann  cell growth regulator relevant to sp-DNF pathogenesis, which links sporadic and  NF1-associated DNFs through RAS pathway hyperactivation.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common neurocutaneous  disorders. Some NF1 patients develop benign large plexiform neurofibroma(s) at  birth, which can then transform into a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor  (MPNST). There is no curative treatment for this rapidly progressive and easily  metastatic neurofibrosarcoma. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been developed as  an anti-cancer treatment, and 5-aminolevulinic (ALA) mediated PDT (ALA-PDT) has  been used to treat cutaneous skin and oral neoplasms. Doxycycline, a  tetracycline derivative, can substantially reduce the tumor burden in human and  animal models, in addition to its antimicrobial effects. The purpose of this  study was to evaluate the effect and to investigate the mechanism of action of  combined doxycycline and ALA-PDT treatment of MPNST cells. An  3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay showed  that the combination of ALA-PDT and doxycycline significantly reduce MPNST  survival rate, compared to cells treated with each therapy alone. Isobologram  analysis showed that the combined treatment had a synergistic effect. The  increased cytotoxic activity could be seen by an increase in cellular  protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) accumulation. Furthermore, we found that the higher  retention of PpIX was mainly due to increasing ALA uptake, rather than activity  changes of the enzymes porphobilinogen deaminase and ferrochelatase. The  combined treatment inhibited tumor growth in different tumor cell lines, but not  in normal human Schwann cells or fibroblasts. Similarly, a synergistic  interaction was also found in cells treated with ALA-PDT combined with  minocycline, but not tetracycline. In summary, doxycycline can potentiate the  effect of ALA-PDT to kill tumor cells. This increased potency allows for a dose  reduction of doxycycline and photodynamic radiation, reducing the occurrence of  toxic side effects in vivo.

Although the mechanisms that balance self-renewal and differentiation of a stem  cell lineage have been extensively studied, it remains poorly understood how  tissues that contain multiple stem cell lineages maintain balanced proliferation  among distinct lineages: when stem cells of a particular lineage proliferate,  how do the other lineages respond to maintain the correct ratio of cells among  linages? Here, we show that Merlin (Mer), a homolog of the human tumor  suppressor neurofibromatosis 2, is required to coordinate proliferation of  germline stem cells (GSCs) and somatic cyst stem cells (CySCs) in the Drosophila  testis. Mer mutant CySCs fail to coordinate their proliferation with that of  GSCs in multiple settings, and can be triggered to undergo tumorous  overproliferation. Mer executes its function by stabilizing adherens junctions.  Given the known role of Mer in contact-dependent inhibition of proliferation, we  propose that the proliferation of CySCs are regulated by crowdedness, or  confluency, of cells in their lineage with respect to that of germline, thereby  coordinating the proliferation of two lineages.

Mutation in the NF1 gene has its implication in poor osteoblastic  capabilities. We hypothesised that pamidronate will enhance the osteoblastic  potential of the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from lipofibromatosis  tissue of children with congenital pseudarthrosis tibia (CPT) associated with  NF1. In this study, bone marrow MSCs (BM MSCs) and CPT MSCs were obtained from  three patients undergoing salvage surgeries/bone grafting (healthy controls) and  those undergoing excision of the hamartoma and corrective surgeries  respectively. The effects of pamidronate (0, 10 nM, 100 nM and 1 μM) on cell  proliferation, toxicity and differentiation potential were assessed and the  outcome was measured by staining and gene expression. Our outcome showed that  CPT MSCs had more proliferation rate as compared to BM MSCs. All 3 doses of  pamidronate did not cause any toxicity to the cells in both the groups. The CPT  MSCs showed less differentiation with pamidronate compared to the healthy  control MSCs. This was quantitated by staining and gene expression analysis.  Therefore, supplementation with pamidronate alone will not aid in bone formation  in patients diagnosed with CPT. An additional stimulus is required to enhance  bone formation.

PURPOSE: Measurement of heterogeneity in 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG)  positron emission tomography (PET) images is reported to improve tumour  phenotyping and response assessment in a number of cancers. We aimed to  determine whether measurements of 18F-FDG heterogeneity could improve  differentiation of benign symptomatic neurofibromas from malignant peripheral  nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs). METHODS: 18F-FDG PET data from a cohort of 54 patients (24 female, 30 male, mean  age 35.1 years) with neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1), and clinically suspected  malignant transformation of neurofibromas into MPNSTs, were included. Scans were  performed to a standard clinical protocol at 1.5 and 4 h post-injection. Six  first-order [including three standardised uptake value (SUV) parameters],  four second-order (derived from grey-level co-occurrence matrices) and four  high-order (derived from neighbourhood grey-tone difference matrices)  statistical features were calculated from tumour volumes of interest. Each  patient had histological verification or at least 5 years clinical follow-up as  the reference standard with regards to the characterisation of tumours as benign  (n = 30) or malignant (n = 24). RESULTS: There was a significant difference between benign and malignant tumours  for all six first-order parameters (at 1.5 and 4 h; p < 0.0001), for  second-order entropy (only at 4 h) and for all high-order features (at 1.5 h and  4 h, except contrast at 4 h; p < 0.0001-0.047). Similarly, the area under the  receiver operating characteristic curves was high (0.669-0.997, p < 0.05) for  the same features as well as 1.5-h second-order entropy. No first-, second- or  high-order feature performed better than maximum SUV (SUVmax) at differentiating  benign from malignant tumours. CONCLUSIONS: 18F-FDG uptake in MPNSTs is higher than benign symptomatic  neurofibromas, as defined by SUV parameters, and more heterogeneous, as defined  by first- and high-order heterogeneity parameters. However, heterogeneity  analysis does not improve on SUVmax discriminative performance.

PMID:28595424,Animal models of meningiomas.,"Animal models of meningiomas.  Mawrin C(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Neuropathology, Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg,  Germany.  Meningiomas are frequent intracranial and intraspinal tumors. They are tumors of  the elderly, and meningioma growth at certain localizations, as well as  recurrent tumors or primary aggressive biology may pose a therapeutic challenge.  To understand the growth characteristics of meningiomas, animal models can  provide insights both from a biological and therapeutical point of view. Using  genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMM), it has been proven that alterations  of the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) gene are key steps for benign meningioma  development. Aggressive meningiomas can be induced by simultaneous activation of  Nf2 and the PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor)/-PDGF-Receptor (R) system, or  inactivation of Tp53 and cdkn2ab in mice. However, mechanisms acting in NF2  wild-type meningiomas are poorly understood so far, because appropriate models  are lacking. Xenograft models have been used either by implantation of primary  cultures derived from human meningiomas, or immortalized human cell lines,  respectively. While the value of primary cells is limited due to low rate of  overall tumor growth and slow proliferation, xenograft approaches have been  shown to be helpful for the evaluation of potential medical treatment options.  Future studies must incorporate new molecular meningioma tumor drivers, as well  as potential treatment options based on recurrent genetic alterations into the  generation of meningioma models.

Comment in     J Pathol. 2018 Jun;245(2):129-131. doi: 10.1002/path.5065.  Recent studies have suggested that the most common and lethal type of 'ovarian'  cancer, i.e. high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), usually arises from epithelium  on the fallopian tube fimbriae, and not from the ovarian surface epithelium. We  have developed Ovgp1-iCreERT2 mice in which the Ovgp1 promoter controls  expression of tamoxifen-regulated Cre recombinase in oviductal epithelium - the  murine equivalent of human fallopian tube epithelium (FTE). We employed  Ovgp1-iCreERT2 mice to show that FTE-specific inactivation of several different  combinations of tumour suppressor genes that are recurrently mutated in human  HGSCs - namely Brca1, Trp53, Rb1, and Nf1 - results in serous tubal  intraepithelial carcinomas (STICs) that progress to HGSC or carcinosarcoma, and  to widespread metastatic disease in a subset of mice. The cancer phenotype is  highly penetrant and more rapid in mice carrying engineered alleles of all four  tumour suppressor genes. Brca1, Trp53 and Pten inactivation in the oviduct also  results in STICs and HGSCs, and is associated with diffuse epithelial  hyperplasia and mucinous metaplasia, which are not observed in mice with intact  Pten. Oviductal tumours arise earlier in these mice than in those with Brca1,  Trp53, Rb1 and Nf1 inactivation. Tumour initiation and/or progression in mice  lacking conditional Pten alleles probably require the acquisition of additional  defects, a notion supported by our identification of loss of the wild-type Rb1  allele in the tumours of mice carrying only one floxed Rb1 allele. Collectively,  the models closely recapitulate the heterogeneity and histological, genetic and  biological features of human HGSC. These models should prove useful for studying  the pathobiology and genetics of HGSC in vivo, and for testing new approaches  for prevention, early detection, and treatment.

Electronic address:  Long-Sheng.Chang@nationwidechildrens.org.  Meningiomas frequently display activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, leading  to elevated levels of phospho-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E  binding proteins, which enhances protein synthesis; however, it is not known  whether inhibition of protein translation is an effective treatment option for  meningiomas. We found that human meningiomas expressed high levels of the three  components of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) translation initiation  complex, eIF4A, eIF4E, and eIF4G. The expression of eIF4A and eIF4E was  important in sustaining the growth of NF2-deficient benign meningioma Ben-Men-1  cells, as shRNA-mediated knockdown of these proteins strongly reduced cell  proliferation. Among a series of 23 natural compounds evaluated, silvestrol,  which inhibits eIF4A, was identified as being the most growth inhibitory in both  primary meningioma and Ben-Men-1 cells. Silvestrol treatment of meningioma cells  prominently induced G2/M arrest. Consistently, silvestrol significantly  decreased the amounts of cyclins D1, E1, A, and B, PCNA, and Aurora A. In  addition, total and phosphorylated AKT, ERK, and FAK, which have been shown to  be important drivers for meningioma cell proliferation, were markedly lower in  silvestrol-treated Ben-Men-1 cells. Our findings suggest that inhibiting protein  translation could be a potential treatment for meningiomas.  Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1: Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man  (OMIM) #162200) is an autosomal dominantly inherited tumour predisposition  syndrome. Heritable constitutional mutations in the NF1 gene result in  dysregulation of the RAS/MAPK pathway and are causative of NF1. The major known  function of the NF1 gene product neurofibromin is to downregulate RAS. NF1  exhibits variable clinical expression and is characterized by benign cutaneous  lesions including neurofibromas and café-au-lait macules, as well as a  predisposition to various types of malignancy, such as breast cancer and  leukaemia. However, acquired somatic mutations in NF1 are also found in a wide  variety of malignant neoplasms that are not associated with NF1. MAIN BODY: Capitalizing upon the availability of next-generation sequencing data  from cancer genomes and exomes, we review current knowledge of somatic NF1  mutations in a wide variety of tumours occurring at a number of different sites:  breast, colorectum, urothelium, lung, ovary, skin, brain and neuroendocrine  tissues, as well as leukaemias, in an attempt to understand their broader role  and significance, and with a view ultimately to exploiting this in a diagnostic  and therapeutic context. CONCLUSION: As neurofibromin activity is a key to regulating the RAS/MAPK  pathway, NF1 mutations are important in the acquisition of drug resistance, to  BRAF, EGFR inhibitors, tamoxifen and retinoic acid in melanoma, lung and breast  cancers and neuroblastoma. Other curiosities are observed, such as a high rate  of somatic NF1 mutation in cutaneous melanoma, lung cancer, ovarian carcinoma  and glioblastoma which are not usually associated with neurofibromatosis type 1.  Somatic NF1 mutations may be critical drivers in multiple cancers. The  mutational landscape of somatic NF1 mutations should provide novel insights into  our understanding of the pathophysiology of cancer. The identification of high  frequency of somatic NF1 mutations in sporadic tumours indicates that  neurofibromin is likely to play a critical role in development, far beyond that  evident in the tumour predisposition syndrome NF1.

The neurofibromatoses (neurofibromatosis type 1, neurofibromatosis type 2 and  schwannomatosis) are rare disorders having clinical manifestations that vary  greatly from patient to patient. The rarity and variability of these disorders  has made it challenging for investigators to identify sufficient numbers of  patients with particular clinical characteristics or specific germline mutations  for participation in interventional studies. Similarly, because the natural  history of all types of neurofibromatosis (NF) is variable and unique for each  individual, it is difficult to identify meaningful clinical outcome measures for  potential therapeutic interventions. In 2012, the Children's Tumor Foundation  created a web-based patient-entered database, the NF Registry, to inform  patients of research opportunities for which they fit general eligibility  criteria and enable patients to contact investigators who are seeking to enroll  patients in approved trials. Registrants were recruited through CTF-affiliated  NF clinics and conferences, through its website, and by word-of-mouth and social  media. Following online consent, demographic information and details regarding  manifestations of NF were solicited on the Registry website. Statistical  analyses were performed on data from a cohort of 4680 registrants (the number of  registrants as of October 9, 2015) who met diagnostic criteria for one of the 3  NF conditions. The analyses support our hypothesis that patient-reported symptom  incidences in the NF Registry are congruent with published clinician-sourced  data. Between April 26, 2013 and July 8, 2016, the registry has been useful to  investigators in recruitment, particularly for observational trials, especially  those for development of patient-reported outcomes.

Electronic  address: CBearden@mednet.ucla.edu.  BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder that disrupts  central nervous system development and neuronal function. Cognitively, NF1 is  characterized by difficulties with executive control and visuospatial abilities.  Little is known about the neural substrates underlying these deficits. The  current study utilized Blood-Oxygen-Level-Dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI)  to explore the neural correlates of spatial working memory (WM) deficits in  patients with NF1. METHODS: BOLD images were acquired from 23 adults with NF1 (age M = 32.69; 61%  male) and 25 matched healthy controls (age M = 33.08; 64% male) during an  in-scanner visuo-spatial WM task. Whole brain functional and  psycho-physiological interaction analyses were utilized to investigate neural  activity and functional connectivity, respectively, during visuo-spatial WM  performance. Participants also completed behavioral measures of spatial  reasoning and verbal WM. RESULTS: Relative to healthy controls, participants with NF1 showed reduced  recruitment of key components of WM circuitry, the left dorsolateral prefrontal  cortex and right parietal cortex. In addition, healthy controls exhibited  greater simultaneous deactivation between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)  and temporal regions than NF1 patients. In contrast, NF1 patients showed greater  PCC and bilateral parietal connectivity with visual cortices as well as between  the PCC and the cerebellum. In NF1 participants, increased functional coupling  of the PCC with frontal and parietal regions was associated with better spatial  reasoning and WM performance, respectively; these relationships were not  observed in controls. CONCLUSIONS: Dysfunctional engagement of WM circuitry, and aberrant functional  connectivity of 'task-negative' regions in NF1 patients may underlie spatial WM  difficulties characteristic of the disorder.

Jonathan.Chernoff@fccc.edu.  Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized  by the development of multiple tumors in the central nervous system, most  notably schwannomas, and meningiomas. Mutational inactivation of the NF2 gene  encoding the protein Merlin is found in most sporadic and inherited schwannomas,  but the molecular mechanisms underlying neoplastic changes in schwannoma cells  remain unclear. We report here that Nf2-deficient cells display elevated  expression levels of key enzymes involved in lipogenesis and that this  upregulation is caused by increased activity of Torc1. Inhibition or knockdown  of fatty acid synthase (FASN), the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of  palmitic acid from malonyl-CoA, drove NF2-deficient cells into apoptosis.  Treatment of NF2-mutant cells with agents that inhibit the production of  malonyl-CoA reduced their sensitivity to FASN inhibitors. Collectively, these  results suggest that the altered lipid metabolism found in NF2-mutant cells  renders them sensitive to elevated levels of malonyl-CoA, as occurs following  blockade of FASN, suggesting new targeted strategies in the treatment of  NF2-deficient tumors.

Children and adolescents with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are at increased  risk for wide-ranging behavioral, developmental, and cognitive impairments and  decreased quality of life. To date, no psychosocial screening tool has been  developed to quickly assess the symptoms that 1) can be addressed during routine  medical appointments in children with NF1, 2) can produce interpretable and  actionable results, 3) can be integrated into medical care, and 4) can quickly  identify patients at risk in order to better address that the provision of  appropriate care are available. This study was conducted to test the overall  usability of the Distress Thermometer (DT) and symptom checklist and concordance  of DT ratings between pediatric patients, their caregivers and medical  providers. Eighty youth (ages 7-21) living with NF1 completed the DT and an  accompanying checklist. The findings of this study suggest the DT and symptom  checklist was acceptable and feasible to complete in a clinic setting. A small  subset reported high distress that required further assessment and intervention.  Significant discordance between distress ratings of caregivers and children and  healthcare providers was also found. Overall, the DT and accompanying symptom  checklist provide important information to identify the presence of distress and  contextualize the child's distress but is limited by not assessing whether these  symptoms interfere with the child's daily life.

BACKGROUND: MiRNAs are involved in aberrant DNA methylation through regulation  of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in the pathogenesis and progression of  glioblastomas (GBM). MiR-152-3p was down-expressed in human malignancies, and  served as a tumor suppressor. Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) was significantly  decreased in GBM tissues with a high level of methylation. However, the link  between miR-152-3p, DNMT1 and methylation of NF2 in GBM is not clearly  established. This study was conducted to detect the mechanism between  miR-152-3p, DNMT1 and NF2 in GBM. METHODS: The levels of DNMT1 and NF2 expression were studied by qRT-PCR, Western  blot, immunofluorescence, and immumohistochemical staining. Methylation in the  promoter region of NF2 was detected by methylation-specific PCR and bisulfate  genomic sequencing PCR. Cell proliferation was examined by Cell-Counting Kit-8  and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assay, and cell invasion was evaluated by  transwell assay. Flow cytomery and Hoechst staining were used to analyze cell  apoptosis. A dual luciferase system was used to confirm the relationship between  miR-152-3p and DNMT1. RESULTS: Methylation of NF2 and DNMT1 was markedly increased, and miR-152-3p was  downregulated in GBM tissues and glioma cells. Both knockdown of DNMT1 and  overexpression miR-152-3p showed that demethylation activated the expression of  NF2. Furthermore, miR-152-3p directly targeted DNMT1. Both miR-152-3p  overexpression and DNMT1 knockdown significantly induced cell apoptosis and  inhibited invasive activity. This was also observed after NF2 overexpression. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that miR-152-3p can inhibit glioma cell  proliferation and invasion activities by decreasing DNMT1. The restoration of  miR-152-3p may have therapeutic application in the treatment of GBM.

PMID:28776579,Significance of H3K27me3 loss in the diagnosis of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.,"Significance of H3K27me3 loss in the diagnosis of malignant peripheral nerve  sheath tumors.

(2)Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California San Francisco,  San Francisco, CA, USA.  The diagnosis of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors can be challenging and  other spindle cell sarcomas commonly enter in the differential diagnosis. Loss  of trimethylation at lysine 27 of histone-H3 (H3K27me3) by immunohistochemistry  was recently described in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. However, its  specificity remains controversial. We therefore studied 82 synovial sarcomas, 39  malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, and 10 fibrosarcomatous  dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans for H3K27me3 loss by immunohistochemistry. The  diagnoses were based on morphology, immunophenotype, and genetics based on WHO  classification. H3K27me3 immunohistochemistry was scored by two pathologists  based on fraction of cells with nuclear staining (score 0 to 3+). Loss of  H3K27me3 (score 0) was seen in 44% of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors  and 9% of synovial sarcomas yielding positive and negative predictive values of  71% and 77%, respectively. Loss of H3K27me3 was seen in 10% of fibrosarcomatous  dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, yielding positive and negative predictive  values of 94 and 29% in the differential diagnosis of malignant peripheral nerve  sheath tumor versus fibrosarcomatous dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. Partial  loss (score 1-2) was common in all three tumor types. Among malignant peripheral  nerve sheath tumors, there was no significant association between H3K27me3 loss  and gender, tumor site, or size, and progression-free or overall survival.  Patients with tumors with H3K27me3 loss were younger than those with tumors with  retained H3K27me3 expression (P=0.011). H3K27me3 expression was lost in 50 and  31% of sporadic and Neurofibromatosis-associated malignant peripheral nerve  sheath tumors, respectively (P=0.25).Complete H3K27me3 loss is a moderately  sensitive and relatively specific marker for the diagnosis of malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumor when the differential diagnosis includes synovial  sarcoma and fibrosarcomatous dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. Partial loss has  limited diagnostic utility. H3K27me3 status does not show significant  association with clinical outcome in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.

Activating BRAF mutants cause feedback inhibition of GTP-bound RAS, are  RAS-independent and signal either as active monomers (class 1) or constitutively  active dimers (class 2). Here we characterize a third class of BRAF  mutants-those that have impaired kinase activity or are kinase-dead. These  mutants are sensitive to ERK-mediated feedback and their activation of  signalling is RAS-dependent. The mutants bind more tightly than wild-type BRAF  to RAS-GTP, and their binding to and activation of wild-type CRAF is enhanced,  leading to increased ERK signalling. The model suggests that dysregulation of  signalling by these mutants in tumours requires coexistent mechanisms for  maintaining RAS activation despite ERK-dependent feedback. Consistent with this  hypothesis, melanomas with these class 3 BRAF mutations also harbour RAS  mutations or NF1 deletions. By contrast, in lung and colorectal cancers with  class 3 BRAF mutants, RAS is typically activated by receptor tyrosine kinase  signalling. These tumours are sensitive to the inhibition of RAS activation by  inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases. We have thus defined three distinct  functional classes of BRAF mutants in human tumours. The mutants activate ERK  signalling by different mechanisms that dictate their sensitivity to therapeutic  inhibitors of the pathway.

The initiating oncogenic event in almost half of human lung adenocarcinomas is  still unknown, a fact that complicates the development of selective targeted  therapies. Yet these tumours harbour a number of alterations without obvious  oncogenic function including BRAF-inactivating mutations. Inactivating BRAF  mutants in lung predominate over the activating V600E mutant that is frequently  observed in other tumour types. Here we demonstrate that the expression of an  endogenous Braf(D631A) kinase-inactive isoform in mice (corresponding to the  human BRAF(D594A) mutation) triggers lung adenocarcinoma in vivo, indicating  that BRAF-inactivating mutations are initiating events in lung oncogenesis.  Moreover, inactivating BRAF mutations have also been identified in a subset of  KRAS-driven human lung tumours. Co-expression of Kras(G12V) and Braf(D631A) in  mouse lung cells markedly enhances tumour initiation, a phenomenon mediated by  Craf kinase activity, and effectively accelerates tumour progression when  activated in advanced lung adenocarcinomas. We also report a key role for the  wild-type Braf kinase in sustaining Kras(G12V)/Braf(D631A)-driven tumours.  Ablation of the wild-type Braf allele prevents the development of lung  adenocarcinoma by inducing a further increase in MAPK signalling that results in  oncogenic toxicity; this effect can be abolished by pharmacological inhibition  of Mek to restore tumour growth. However, the loss of wild-type Braf also  induces transdifferentiation of club cells, which leads to the rapid development  of lethal intrabronchiolar lesions. These observations indicate that the signal  intensity of the MAPK pathway is a critical determinant not only in tumour  development, but also in dictating the nature of the cancer-initiating cell and  ultimately the resulting tumour phenotype.

The loss of the tumor suppressor neurofibromatosis type 2 gene, encoding merlin,  has been considered to be a fundamental event during the malignant progression  of various cell types. However, a consensus for the mainstream mechanism, by  which merlin deficiency contributes to uncontrolled cellular proliferation, has  not been reached. The present study aimed to determine whether silencing of  merlin using lentivirus-based short hairpin RNA potentiates cellular  proliferation and cell cycle progression in human colon carcinoma HCT116 cell  lines, expressing p53. The present results demonstrated that merlin knockdown  contributed to cellular proliferation and G1/S cell cycle progression to a  greater extent in HCT116 cells wide-type for p53 (p53wt) compared with p53-null  (p53-/-) cells. This was supported by overexpression experiments which  demonstrated a significant inhibitory effect of excess merlin on cellular  proliferation only in HCT116 p53wt cells. In order to investigate the underlying  mechanisms of action, the expression of p53-involved G1/S transition genes was  evaluated by western blot analysis. For HCT116 p53wt cells, merlin loss  suppressed p53 expression, and therefore the dysregulation of cell cycle  regulatory proteins, including p21, cyclin D1/cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4 and  cyclin E1/CDK2 complexes. However, merlin knockdowns had no impact on the  expression of any of the aforementioned molecules in p53-/- cells, indicating  that lack of merlin resulted in G1/S cell cycle progression, and thereby  uncontrolled cellular proliferation mainly via the regulation of p53-mediated  pathways. Taken together, it was proposed that p53 performs an essential role in  mediating the oncogenic stimulus triggered by merlin loss, and p53 is a molecule  that should be investigated for its potential in targeted drug therapy for  merlin-deficient malignancies.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are rare, highly aggressive  sarcomas that can occur spontaneously or from pre-existing plexiform  neurofibromas in neurofibromatosis type1 (NF1) patients. MPNSTs have high local  recurrence rates, metastasize easily, are generally resistant to therapeutic  intervention and frequently fatal for the patient. Novel targeted therapeutic  strategies are urgently needed. Standard treatment for patients presenting with  advanced disease is doxorubicin based chemotherapy which inhibits the actions of  the enzyme topoisomerase IIα (TOP2A). Recent molecular studies using murine  models and cell lines identified the bromodomain containing protein 4 (BRD4) and  enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) as novel targets for MPNST treatment. We  investigated the expression and potential use of BRD4, EZH2 and TOP2A as  therapeutic targets in human NF1-derived MPNSTs. The transcript levels of BRD4,  EZH2 and TOP2A were determined in paired formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)  neurofibroma/MPNST samples derived from the same NF1 patient and in a set of  plexiform neurofibromas, atypical neurofibromas and MPNST. We further examined  the effect on cell viability of genetic or pharmacological inhibition of BRD4,  EZH2 and TOP2A in an MPNST cell line panel. Our results indicated that in MPNST  samples BRD4 mRNA levels were not upregulated and that MPNST cell lines were  relatively insensitive to the bromodomain inhibitor JQ1. We corroborated that  EZH2 mRNA expression is increased in MPNST but failed to confirm its reported  pivotal role in MPNST pathogenesis as EZH2 knockdown by siRNA did not interfere  with cellular proliferation and viability. Finally, the relation between TOP2A  levels and sensitivity for doxorubicin was examined, confirming reports that  TOP2A mRNA levels were overexpressed in MPNST and showing that MPNST cell lines  exhibited relatively high TOP2A protein levels and sensitivity to doxorubicin.  We tentatively conclude that the potential for effective therapeutic  intervention in MPNST by targeting BRD4, EZH2 and TOP2A individually, may be  limited. Clinical studies are necessary to ultimately prove the relevance of  BRD4 and EZH2 inhibition as novel therapeutic strategies for MPNST.

Neurofibromin and Sprouty-related EVH1 domain-containing protein 1 (Spred1) both  act as negative regulators of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and  are associated with the rare diseases Neurofibromatosis type 1 and Legius  syndrome, respectively. Spred1 recruits the major GTPase activating protein  (GAP) neurofibromin from the cytosol to the membrane in order to inactivate the  small G protein Ras. These functions are dependent on the N-terminal EVH1 domain  and the C-terminal Sprouty domain of Spred1 whereas the former specifically  recognizes the GAP related domain of neurofibromin and the latter is responsible  for membrane targeting. Within the GAP domain, Spred1 binding depends on the  GAPex portion which is dispensable for Ras inactivation. In a first step towards  the characterization of the Neurofibromin Spred1 interface in solution we  assigned backbone and side chain 1H, 13C, and 15N chemical shifts of the Spred1  derived EVH1 domain. Our chemical shift data analysis indicate seven consecutive  β-strands followed by a C-terminal α-helix which is in agreement with the  previously reported crystal structure of Spred1(EVH1). Our data provide a  framework for further analysis of the function of patient-derived mutations  associated with rare diseases.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common, cancer-predisposing disease caused  by mutations in the NF1 tumor gene. Patients with NF1 have an increased risk for  benign and malignant tumors of the nervous system (e.g., neurofibromas,  malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, gliomas) and other tissues (e.g.,  leukemias, rhabdomyosarcoma, etc.) as well as increased susceptibility to  learning disabilities, chronic pain/migraines, hypertension, pigmentary changes,  and developmental lesions (e.g., tibial pseudoarthrosis). Pigs are an attractive  and upcoming animal model for future NF1 studies, but a potential limitation to  porcine model research has been the lack of validated reagents for direct  translational study to humans. To address that issue, we used formalin-fixed  tissues (human and pigs) to evaluate select immunohistochemical markers  (activated caspase-3, allograft inflammatory factor-1, beta-tubulin III,  calbindin D, CD13, CD20, desmin, epithelial membrane antigen, glial fibrillary  acidic protein, glucose transporter-1, laminin, myelin basic protein, myoglobin,  proliferating cell nuclear antigen, S100, vimentin, and von Willebrand factor).  The markers were validated by comparing known expression and localization in  human and pig tissues. Validation of these markers on fixed tissues will  facilitate prospective immunohistochemical studies of NF1 pigs, as well as other  pig models, in a more efficient, reproducible, and translationally relevant  manner.

Patients affected with a constitutional truncating NF2 mutation  have severe disease, while missense mutations or mosaic mutations present with a  milder attenuated phenotype. Genotype-derived natural history data are important  to inform discussions on prognosis and management. METHODS: We have assessed NF2 clinical phenotype in 142 patients in relation to  the UK NF2 Genetic Severity Score to validate its use as a clinical and research  tool. RESULTS: The Genetic Severity Score showed significant correlations across 10  measures, including mean age at diagnosis, proportion of patients with bilateral  vestibular schwannomas, presence of intracranial meningioma, spinal meningioma  and spinal schwannoma, NF2 eye features, hearing grade, age at first  radiotherapy, age at first surgery and age starting bevacizumab. In addition  there was moderate but significant correlation with age at loss of useful  hearing, and weak but significant correlations for mean age at death, quality of  life, last optimum Speech Discrimination Score and total number of major  interventions. Patients with severe disease presented at a younger age had a  higher disease burden and greater requirement of intervention than patients with  mild and moderate disease. CONCLUSIONS: This study validates the UK NF2 Genetic Severity Score to stratify  patients with NF2 for both clinical use and natural history studies.  © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of  the article) 2017.

BACKGROUND: Meningiomas are the most common primary intracranial tumors in  adults. While a majority of meningiomas are slow growing neoplasms that may  cured by surgical resection, a subset demonstrates more aggressive behavior and  insidiously recurs despite surgery and radiation, without effective alternative  treatment options. Elucidation of critical mitogenic pathways in meningioma  oncogenesis may offer new therapeutic strategies. We performed an integrated  genomic and molecular analysis to characterize the expression and function of  osteoglycin (OGN) in meningiomas and explored possible therapeutic approaches  for OGN-expressing meningiomas. METHODS: OGN mRNA expression in human meningiomas was assessed by RNA microarray  and RNAscope. The impact of OGN on cell proliferation, colony formation, and  mitogenic signaling cascades was assessed in a human meningioma cell line  (IOMM-Lee) with stable overexpression of OGN. Furthermore, the functional  consequences of introducing an AKT inhibitor in OGN-overexpressing meningioma  cells were assessed. RESULTS: OGN mRNA expression was dramatically increased in meningiomas compared  to a spectrum of other brain tumors and normal brain. OGN-overexpressing  meningioma cells demonstrated an elevated rate of cell proliferation, cell cycle  activation, and colony formation as compared with cells transfected with control  vector. In addition, NF2 mRNA and protein expression were both attenuated in  OGN-overexpressing cells. Conversely, mTOR pathway and AKT activation increased  in OGN-overexpressing cells compared to control cells. Lastly, introduction of  an AKT inhibitor reduced OGN expression in meningioma cells and resulted in  increased cell death and autophagy, suggestive of a reciprocal relationship  between OGN and AKT. CONCLUSION: We identify OGN as a novel oncogene in meningioma proliferation. AKT  inhibition reduces OGN protein levels in meningioma cells, with a concomitant  increase in cell death, which provides a promising treatment option for  meningiomas with OGN overexpression.

Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix or to surrounding cells plays a key  role in cell proliferation and differentiation and is critical for proper tissue  homeostasis. An important pathway in adhesion-dependent cell proliferation is  the Hippo signaling cascade, which is coregulated by the transcription factors  Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding  motif (TAZ). However, how cells integrate extracellular information at the  molecular level to regulate YAP1's nuclear localization is still puzzling.  Herein, we investigated the role of β1 integrins in regulating this process. We  found that β1 integrin-dependent cell adhesion is critical for supporting cell  proliferation in mesenchymal cells both in vivo and in vitro β1  integrin-dependent cell adhesion relied on the relocation of YAP1 to the nucleus  after the down-regulation of its phosphorylated state mediated by large tumor  suppressor gene 1 and 2 (LATS1/2). We also found that this phenotype relies on  β1 integrin-dependent local activation of the small GTPase RAC1 at the plasma  membrane to control the activity of P21 (RAC1)-activated kinase (PAK) of group  1. We further report that the regulatory protein merlin (neurofibromin 2, NF2)  interacts with both YAP1 and LATS1/2 via its C-terminal moiety and FERM domain,  respectively. PAK1-mediated merlin phosphorylation on Ser-518 reduced merlin's  interactions with both LATS1/2 and YAP1, resulting in YAP1 dephosphorylation and  nuclear shuttling. Our results highlight RAC/PAK1 as major players in YAP1  regulation triggered by cell adhesion.  © 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

Electronic address: florente@bcm.edu.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common genetic disorder caused by mutations  in the NF1 gene. Recalcitrant bone healing following fracture (i.e.  pseudarthrosis) is one of the most problematic skeletal complications associated  with NF1. The etiology of this condition is still unclear; thus, pharmacological  options for clinical management are limited. Multiple studies have shown the  reduced osteogenic potential of Nf1-deficient osteoprogenitors. A recent  transcriptome profiling investigation revealed that EREG and EGFR, encoding  epiregulin and its receptor Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 1, respectively,  were among the top over-expressed genes in cells of the NF1 pseudarthrosis site.  Because EGFR stimulation is known to inhibit osteogenic differentiation, we  hypothesized that increased EREG and EGFR expression in NF1-deficient skeletal  progenitors may contribute to their reduced osteogenic differentiation  potential. In this study, we first confirmed via single-cell mRNA sequencing  that EREG over-expression was associated with NF1 second hit somatic mutations  in human bone cells, whereas Transforming Growth Factor beta 1 (TGFβ1)  expression was unchanged. Second, using ex-vivo recombined Nf1-deficient mouse  bone marrow stromal cells (mBMSCs), we show that this molecular signature is  conserved between mice and humans, and that epiregulin generated by these cells  is overexpressed and active, whereas soluble TGFβ1 expression and activity are  not affected. However, blocking either epiregulin function or EGFR signaling by  EGFR1 or pan EGFR inhibition (using AG-1478 and Poziotinib respectively) did not  correct the differentiation defect of Nf1-deficient mBMSCs, as measured by the  expression of Alpl, Ibsp and alkaline phosphatase activity. These results  suggest that clinically available drugs aimed at inhibiting EGFR signaling are  unlikely to have a significant benefit for the management of bone non-union in  children with NF1 PA.

OBJECTIVE: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a hereditary tumor syndrome  characterized by an increased risk of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors  (MPNST). Chemotherapy of MPNST is still insufficient. In this study, we  investigated whether human tumor Schwann cells derived from NF1 associated MPNST  respond to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). We analyzed effects of ATRA and MEK  inhibitor (MEKi) combination therapy. METHODS: MPNST cell lines S462, T265, NSF1 were treated with ATRA and MEKi U0126  and PD0325901. We assessed cell viability, proliferation, migration, apoptosis  and differentiation as well as mRNA expression of RAR and RXR subtypes and ATRA  target genes such as CRABP2, CYP26A1, RARB and PDK1. We also analyzed CRABP2  methylation in cell lines and performed immunohistochemistry of human MPNST  specimens. RESULTS: ATRA therapy reduced viability and proliferation in S462 and T265  cells, accompanied by differentiation, apoptosis and reduced migration. NSF1  cells which lacked RXRG expression did not respond to ATRA. We furthermore  demonstrated that ATRA signaling was functional for common targets, and that  mRNA expression of CRABP2 and its targets was raised by ATRA therapy, whereas  alternative pathways via FABP5 were not induced. Finally, combination of ATRA  and MEKi demonstrated additively reduced viability of T265 and S462 cells. CONCLUSIONS: We observed therapeutic effects in two of three MPNST cell lines  pronounced by combination therapy. These data point to a potentially successful  treatment of MPNST by combined application of ATRA and MEK inhibitors such as  U0126 or PD0325901.

Successful treatment of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated tumors poses a  significant clinical challenge. While the primary underlying genetic defect  driving RAS signaling is well described, recent evidence suggests immune  dysfunction contributes to tumor pathogenesis and malignant transformation. As  immunologic characterizations, prognostic and predictive of immunotherapeutic  clinical response in other cancers, are not fully described for benign and  malignant NF1-related tumors, we sought to define their immunologic profiles. We  determined the expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A/-B/-C,  β-2-microglobulin (B2M), and T cell inhibitory ligands PD-L1 and CTLA-4 by  microarray gene analysis and flow cytometry. We examined HLA-A/-B/-C, B2M, and  PD-L1 expression on thirty-six NF1-associated tumor samples by  immunohistochemistry, and correlated these with tumoral CD4+, CD8+, FOXP3+,  CD56+, and CD45RO+ lymphocytic infiltrates. We evaluated several tumors from a  single patient, observing trends of increasing immunogenicity over time, even  with disease progression. We observed similarly immunogenic profiles for  malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) and nodular and plexiform  neurofibromas, contrasting with diffuse neurofibromas. These studies suggest  that while immunotherapies may offer some benefit for MPNST and nodular and  plexiform neurofibromas, tumor heterogeneity might pose a significant clinical  challenge to this novel therapeutic approach.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: LukS-PV is a component of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL). We  have previously demonstrated that LukS-PV potently promoted differentiation and  induced apoptosis in THP-1 cells. However, the precise mechanisms of these  actions remain unknown. MicroRNAs (miRs) play important roles in cellular  differentiation and apoptosis. This study aimed to investigate the role of  miR-125a-3p in LukS-PV-regulated differentiation and apoptosis and its  underlying mechanism in THP-1 cells. METHODS: MicroRNA profiling analyses were conducted to determine differential  miRNA expression levels in THP-1 cells treated with LukS-PV. Cell  differentiation and apoptosis were measured in THP-1 cells by gain-of-function  and loss-of-function experiments. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase  reporter assays were used to confirm the targets of miR-125a-3p. The effects of  the miR-125a-3p targets on cellular differentiation were determined by knocking  them down. RESULTS: MiR-125a-3p was up-regulated after treating the human monocytic  leukaemia cell line THP-1 with LukS-PV. In addition, miR-125a-3p positively  regulated apoptosis and differentiation in THP-1 cells treated with LukS-PV.  Concordantly, luciferase reporter assays confirmed that neurofibromatosis type 1  (NF1) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) were direct target genes of miR-125a-3p.  Moreover, NF1 knockdown in THP-1 cells significantly promoted differentiation in  vitro. Finally, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, a  downstream target of NF1, was activated after NF1 knockdown. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm that miR-125a-3p is involved in  LukS-PV-mediated cell differentiation and apoptosis in THP-1 cells.  © 2017 The Author(s). Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.

BACKGROUND: peripheral nerve sheath tumors comprise a broad spectrum of  neoplasms. Vestibular schwannomas and plexiform neurofibromas are symptomatic  albeit benign, but a subset of the latter pre-malignant lesions will transform  to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). Surgery and radiotherapy  are the primary strategies to treat these tumors. Intrinsic resistance to drug  therapy characterizes all three tumor subtypes. The breast cancer resistance  protein BCRP is a transmembrane efflux transporter considered to play a key role  in various biological barriers such as the blood brain barrier. At the same time  it is associated with drug resistance in various tumors. Its potential role in  drug resistant tumors of the peripheral nervous system is largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: to assess if BCRP is expressed in vestibular schwannomas, plexiform  neurofibromas and MPNST. MATERIAL AND METHODS: immunohistochemical staining for BCRP was performed on a  tissue microarray composed out of 22 vestibular schwannomas, 10 plexiform  neurofibromas and 18 MPNSTs. RESULTS: sixteen out of twenty-two vestibular schwannomas (73%), nine out of ten  plexiform neurofibromas (90%) and six out of eighteen MPNST (33%) expressed BCRP  in the vasculature. Tumor cells were negative. CONCLUSION: BCRP is present in the vasculature of vestibular schwannomas,  plexiform neurofibromas and MPSNT. Therefore, it may reduce the drug exposure of  underlying tumor tissues and potentially cause failure of drug therapy.

Dermal neurofibromas are the hallmarks of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).  Neurofibromas harbor Schwann cells with two different genotypes: Schwann cells  which carry the germline mutation and a healthy NF1 allele (NF1 +/-), and a  subpopulation of Schwann cells which harbor the so-called second hit leading to  inactivation of both NF1 alleles (NF1 -/-). The second hit in the NF1 gene of  Schwann cells is considered to be the initial step in the development of  neurofibromas. Dermal neurofibromas typically start to grow in puberty, and  their number and size increase during pregnancy, indicating hormone  responsiveness. This is the first study to address the effect of human chorionic  gonadotropin (hCG) on the proliferation of human NF1 +/- and NF1 -/- Schwann  cells in vitro. In addition, the effects of estradiol and testosterone were also  investigated. The results showed that NF1 -/- Schwann cells were more sensitive  to estradiol, testosterone, and human chorionic gonadotropin than NF1 +/- cells.  Specifically, the proliferation of NF1 -/- Schwann cells was increased by up to  99, 110, and 170% compared to vehicle control when treated with estradiol,  testosterone, and hCG, respectively. Interestingly, no effect of estradiol,  testosterone, or hCG on the proliferation of the cells with NF1 +/- genotype was  observed. To conclude, the somatic second hit in the NF1 gene sensitizes Schwann  cells to sex hormones resulting in a highly increased proliferation. Our results  highlight the significance of sex hormones in the regulation of neurofibroma  growth.

PURPOSE: To investigate whether elevated glucose metabolism in neurofibroma,  determined by [F18]-FDG-PET, is correlated with cell density in MRI, as  expressed through the apparent diffusion coefficient. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 1 and  peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNST) were enrolled in this prospective,  IRB-approved study. After a single [F18]-FDG injection, patients consecutively  underwent [F18]-FDG-PET/CT and [F18]-FDG-PET/MRI on the same day. Maximum and  mean standardized uptake values (SUVmax, SUVmean) on [F18]-FDG-PET/CT and  [F18]-FDG-PET/MRI were compared, and correlated with minimum and mean apparent  diffusion coefficients (ADCmean, ADCmin). RESULTS: A total of 12 (6 male/6 female, mean age was 16.2 ± 5.2 years) patients  were prospectively included and analyzed on a per-lesion (n = 39) basis. The  SUVmean of examined PNST showed a moderate negative correlation with the ADCmean  (r = -.441) and ADCmin (r = -.477), which proved to be statistically significant  (p = .005 and p = .002). The SUVmax of the respective lesions, however, showed a  weaker negative correlation for ADCmean (r: -.311) and ADCmin (r: -.300) and did  not reach statistical significance (p = .054 and p = .057). Lesion-based  correlation between [F18]-FDG-PET/MRI and [F18]-FDG-PET/CT showed a moderate  correlation for SUVmax (r = .353; p = .027) and a strong one for SUVmean (r =  .879; p = .001)). Patient-based liver uptake (SUVmax and mean) of  [F18]-FDG-PET/MRI and [F18]-FDG-PET/CT were strongly positively correlated (r =  .827; p < .001 and r = .721; p < .001) but differed significantly (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: We found a statistically significant, negative correlation between  glucose metabolism and cell density in PNST. Thus, ADCmean and ADCmin could  possibly add complimentary information to the SUVmax and SUVmean and may serve  as a potential determinant of malignant transformation of PNST.

The optic neuroepithelial continuum of vertebrate eye develops into three  differentially growing compartments: the retina, the ciliary margin (CM), and  the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Neurofibromin 2 (Nf2) is strongly  expressed in slowly expanding RPE and CM compartments, and the loss of mouse Nf2  causes hyperplasia in these compartments, replicating the ocular abnormalities  seen in human NF2 patients. The hyperplastic ocular phenotypes were largely  suppressed by heterozygous deletion of Yap and Taz, key targets of the Nf2-Hippo  signaling pathway. We also found that, in addition to feedback transcriptional  regulation of Nf2 by Yap/Taz in the CM, activation of Nf2 expression by Mitf in  the RPE and suppression by Sox2 in retinal progenitor cells are necessary for  the differential growth of the corresponding cell populations. Together, our  findings reveal that Nf2 is a key player that orchestrates the differential  growth of optic neuroepithelial compartments during vertebrate eye development.

OBJECTIVE: Optical spectroscopy offers a noninvasive alternative to biopsy as a  first-line screening tool for suspicious skin lesions. This study sought to  define several optical parameters across malignant and benign tissue types. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective pilot trial utilizing the Zenalux IM1 optical  spectroscopy device from April 2016 to February 2017. For each skin lesion,  provider pre-biopsy probability of malignancy was compared to histolopathologic  diagnosis. Optical data were characterized across basal cell carcinoma (BCC;  n = 9), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC; n = 5), actinic keratosis (AK; n = 4),  scar tissue (n = 6), nevus (n = 2), and neurofibroma (NF; n = 1). Across all  patients, agreement was determined between control measurements collected  adjacent to the lesion and from the upper extremity. METHODS: Prospective single center pilot study. The optical properties of 27  cutaneous lesions were collected from 18 adult patients presenting to  Otolaryngology and Dermatology clinics with suspicious skin lesions warranting  biopsy. Spectroscopy measurements were recorded for each lesion: two at the  lesion site, two at an adjacent site (internal control), and one at the central  medial upper extremity (arm control). Variables of interest included absolute  oxygenated hemoglobin (Hb), Hb saturation, total Hb concentration, and Eumelanin  concentration. For each lesion, internal control averages were subtracted from  lesion averages to provide delta parameter values, and lesion averages were  divided by internal control averages to provide ratio parameter values. RESULTS: Mean percent difference between pre-biopsy probability of malignancy  and histology was 29%, with a difference of 75% or greater seen in 5 of 25  lesions. Mean values for BCC, SCC, AK, and scar tissue varied most between  extracted mean reduced scatter estimate (μa'; cm- ) delta values (BCC:  -2.2 ± 3.8; SCC: -3.9 ± 2.0; AK: -3.3 ± 4.2, Scar: -1.7 ± 1.2) and total Hb (µM)  ratio (BCC: 2.0 ± 3.3; SCC: 3.0 ± 1.3; AK: 1.1 ± 0.6; Scar: 1.4 ± 1.1).  Agreement between local and arm controls was poor. CONCLUSION: This pilot trial utilizes optical spectroscopy as a noninvasive  method for determining cutaneous lesion histology. Effect sizes observed across  optical parameters for benign and malignant tissue types will guide larger  prospective studies that may ultimately lead to prediction of lesional histology  without need for invasive biopsy.

Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor  involved in xenobiotic metabolism. Plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) can transform  into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) that are resistant to  existing therapies. These tumors are primarily composed of Schwann cells. In  addition to neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene inactivation, further genetic  lesions are required for malignant transformation. We have quantified the mRNA  expression levels of AHR and its associated genes in 38 human samples. We report  that AHR and the biosynthetic enzymes of its endogenous ligand are overexpressed  in human biopsies of PNFs and MPNSTs. We also detect a strong nuclear AHR  staining in MPNSTs. The inhibition of AHR by siRNA or antagonists, CH-223191 and  trimethoxyflavone, induces apoptosis in human MPNST cells. Since AHR  dysregulation is observed in these tumors, we investigate AHR involvement in  Schwann cell physiology. Hence, we studied the role of AHR in myelin structure  and myelin gene regulation in Ahr-/- mice during myelin development. AHR  ablation leads to locomotion defects and provokes thinner myelin sheaths around  the axons. We observe a dysregulation of myelin gene expression and myelin  developmental markers in Ahr-/- mice. Interestingly, AHR does not directly bind  to myelin gene promoters. The inhibition of AHR in vitro and in vivo increased  β-catenin levels and stimulated the binding of β-catenin on myelin gene  promoters. Taken together, our findings reveal an endogenous role of AHR in  peripheral myelination and in peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Finally, we  suggest a potential therapeutic approach by targeting AHR in nerve tumors.

Neurofibromin 1 (NF1) is a tumor suppressor gene encoding a Ras GTPase that  negatively regulates Ras signaling pathways. Mutations in NF1 are linked to  neurofibromatosis type 1, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and Watson syndrome.  In terms of antitumor immunity, CD1d-dependent natural killer T (NKT) cells play  an important role in the innate antitumor immune response. Generally, Type-I NKT  cells protect (and Type-II NKT cells impair) host antitumor immunity. We have  previously shown that CD1d-mediated antigen presentation to NKT cells is  regulated by cell signaling pathways. To study whether a haploinsufficiency in  NF1 would affect CD1d-dependent activation of NKT cells, we analyzed the  NKT-cell population as well as the functional expression of CD1d in Nf1+/- mice.  Nf1+/- mice were found to have similar levels of NKT cells as wildtype (WT)  littermates. Interestingly, however, reduced CD1d expression was observed in  Nf1+/- mice compared with their WT littermates. When inoculated with a T-cell  lymphoma in vivo, Nf1+/- mice survived longer than their WT littermates.  Furthermore, blocking CD1d in vivo significantly enhanced antitumor activity in  WT, but not in Nf1+/- mice. In contrast, a deficiency in Type-I NKT cells  increased antitumor activity in Nf1+/- mice, but not in WT littermates.  Therefore, these data suggest that normal NF1 expression impairs CD1d-mediated  NKT-cell activation and antitumor activity against a T-cell lymphoma.

RASopathies are a group of heterogeneous conditions caused by germline mutations  in RAS/MAPK signalling pathway genes. With next-generation sequencing (NGS),  sequencing capacity is no longer a limitation to molecular diagnosis. Instead,  the rising number of variants of unknown significance (VUSs) poses challenges to  clinical interpretation and genetic counselling. We investigated the potential  of an integrated pipeline combining NGS and the functional assessment of  variants for the diagnosis of RASopathies. We included 63 Chinese patients with  RASopathies that had previously tested negative for PTPN11 and HRAS mutations.  In these patients, we performed a genetic analysis of genes associated with  RASopathies using a multigene NGS panel and Sanger sequencing. For the VUSs, we  evaluated evidence from genetic, bioinformatic and functional data. Twenty  disease-causing mutations were identified in the 63 patients, providing a  primary diagnostic yield of 31.7%. Four VUSs were identified in five patients.  The functional assessment supported the pathogenicity of the RAF1 and RIT1 VUSs,  while the significance of two VUSs in A2ML1 remained unclear. In summary,  functional analysis improved the diagnostic yield from 31.7% to 36.5%. Although  technically demanding and time-consuming, a functional genetic diagnostic  analysis can ease the clinical translation of these findings to aid bedside  interpretation.

Electronic address: marlan-hansen@uiowa.edu.  Merlin is the protein product of the NF2 tumor suppressor gene. Germline NF2  mutation leads to neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), characterized by multiple  intracranial and spinal schwannomas. Patients with NF2 also frequently develop  peripheral neuropathies. While the role of merlin in SC neoplasia is well  established, its role in SC homeostasis is less defined. Here we explore the  role of merlin in SC responses to nerve injury and their ability to support axon  regeneration. We performed sciatic nerve crush in wild-type (WT) and in  P0SchΔ39-121 transgenic mice that express a dominant negative Nf2 isoform in  SCs. Recovery of nerve function was assessed by measuring mean contact paw area  on a pressure pad 7, 21, 60, and 90 days following nerve injury and by nerve  conduction assays at 90 days following injury. After 90 days, the nerves were  harvested and axon regeneration was quantified stereologically. Myelin  ultrastructure was analyzed by electron microscopy. Functional studies showed  delayed nerve regeneration in Nf2 mutant mice compared to the WT mice. Delayed  neural recovery correlated with a reduced density of regenerated axons and  increased endoneurial space in mutants compared to WT mice. Nevertheless,  functional and nerve conduction measures ultimately recovered to similar levels  in WT and Nf2 mutant mice, while there was a small (∼17%) reduction in the  percent of regenerated axons in the Nf2 mutant mice. The data suggest that  merlin function in SCs regulates neural ultrastructure and facilitates neural  regeneration, in addition to its role in SC neoplasia.  Copyright © 2018 IBRO.

BACKGROUND: Clinical overlap between neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2),  schwannomatosis, and meningiomatosis can make clinical diagnosis difficult.  Hence, molecular investigation of germline and tumor tissues may improve the  diagnosis. METHODS: We present the targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of NF2,  SMARCB1, LZTR1, SMARCE1, and SUFU tumor suppressor genes, using an  amplicon-based approach. We analyzed blood DNA from a cohort of 196 patients,  including patients with NF2 (N = 79), schwannomatosis (N = 40), meningiomatosis  (N = 12), and no clearly established diagnosis (N = 65). Matched tumor DNA was  analyzed when available. Forty-seven NF2-/SMARCB1-negative schwannomatosis  patients and 27 NF2-negative meningiomatosis patients were also evaluated. RESULTS: A NF2 variant was found in 41/79 (52%) NF2 patients. SMARCB1 or LZTR1  variants were identified in 5/40 (12.5%) and 13/40 (∼32%) patients in the  schwannomatosis cohort. Potentially pathogenic variants were found in 12/65  (18.5%) patients with no clearly established diagnosis. A LZTR1 variant was  identified in 16/47 (34%) NF2/SMARCB1-negative schwannomatosis patients. A  SMARCE1 variant was found in 3/39 (∼8%) meningiomatosis patients. No SUFU  variant was found in the cohort. NGS was an effective and sensitive method to  detect mutant alleles in blood or tumor DNA of mosaic NF2 patients.  Interestingly, we identified a 4-hit mechanism resulting in the complete NF2  loss-of-function combined with SMARCB1 and LZTR1 haploinsufficiency in  two-thirds of tumors from NF2 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous investigation of NF2, SMARCB1, LZTR1, and SMARCE1 is a  key element in the differential diagnosis of NF2, schwannomatosis, and  meningiomatosis. The targeted NGS strategy is suitable for the identification of  NF2 mosaicism in blood and for the investigation of tumors from these patients.

Comment in     Neuro Oncol. 2018 May 18;20(6):721-722. doi: 10.1093/neuonc/noy050.  BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) leads to the development of benign and  malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). MPNST have been described to  develop in preexisting benign plexiform neurofibromas (PN) and have a poor  prognosis. Atypical neurofibromas (ANF) were recently described as precursor  lesions for MPNST, making early detection and management of ANF a possible  strategy to prevent MPNST. We aimed to clinically characterize ANF and identify  management approaches. METHODS: We analyzed clinical, imaging, and pathology findings of all patients  with NF1 and ANF at 3 institutions. RESULTS: Sixty-three patients had 76 ANF (32M/31F; median age 27.1 y). On MRI,  most ANF appeared as distinct nodular lesions and were 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose  (FDG) avid. Forty-six ANF were associated with pain, 19 with motor weakness, 45  were palpable or visible, and 13 had no clinical signs. Completely resected ANF  (N = 57) have not recurred (median follow-up, 4.1 y; range, 0-14 y). Four ANF  transformed into MPNST and 17 patients had a history of MPNST in a different  location than was their ANF. CONCLUSIONS: Growth of distinct nodular lesions, pain, and FDG-PET avidity  should raise concern for ANF in NF1. Patients with ANF are at greater risk for  development of MPNST. Complete resection of ANF may prevent development of  MPNST.  DOI: 10.1093/neuonc/noy013 PMCID: PMC5961015 PMID: 29409029 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",False,Clinical characterization study

(4)Department of Dermatology, University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL, USA.  BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder characterized  by a predisposition to develop multiple benign tumors. A major feature of NF1 is  the development of localized cutaneous neurofibromas. Cutaneous neurofibromas  manifest in > 99% of adults with NF1 and are responsible for major negative  effects on quality of life. Previous reports have correlated increased burden of  cutaneous neurofibromas with age and pregnancy, but longitudinal data are not  available to establish a quantitative natural history of these lesions. The  purpose of this study is to conduct a prospective natural history study of 22  adults with NF1 over an 8-year period to quantify cutaneous neurofibroma number  and size. RESULTS: The average monthly increase in volume for cutaneous neurofibromas was  0.37 mm3 in the back region (95% CI (0.23, 0.51), p < 0.0001), 0.28 mm3 in the  abdominal region (95% CI (0.16, 0.41), p < 0.0001), and 0.21 mm3 in the arm/leg  region (95% CI (0.08, 0.34), p = 0.0022). The number of cutaneous neurofibromas  significantly increased in the back (slope = 0.032, p = 0.011) and abdominal  (slope = 0.018, p = 0.026) regions, while the leg/arm regions retained a  positive trend (slope = 0.004, p = 0.055). CONCLUSIONS: The number and volume of cutaneous neurofibromas significantly  increased over an 8-year timespan; however, the rate of increase is variable by  individual and body region. These findings may provide insight into cutaneous  neurofibroma development and benefit researchers considering clinical trials  targeting cutaneous neurofibromas.

In a non-selected sample of children with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) the  prevalence rate of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and predictive value of an  observational (ADOS)-and questionnaire-based screening instrument were assessed.  Complete data was available for 128 children. The prevalence rate for clinical  ASD was 10.9%, which is clearly higher than in the general population. This  prevalence rate is presumably more accurate than in previous studies that  examined children with NF1 with an ASD presumption or solely based on screening  instruments. The combined observational- and screening based classifications  demonstrated the highest positive predictive value for DSM-IV diagnosis,  highlighting the importance of using both instruments in children with NF1.

BACKGROUND: Subtle DNA methylation alterations mediated by carbon nanotubes  (CNTs) exposure might contribute to pathogenesis and disease susceptibility. It  is known that both multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and single-walled  carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) interact with nucleus. Such, nuclear-CNT interaction  may affect the DNA methylation effects. In order to understand the epigenetic  toxicity, in particular DNA methylation alterations, of SWCNTs and short MWCNTs,  we performed global/genome-wide, gene-specific DNA methylation and  RNA-expression analyses after exposing human bronchial epithelial cells  (16HBE14o- cell line). In addition, the presence of CNTs on/in the cell nucleus  was evaluated in a label-free way using femtosecond pulsed laser microscopy. RESULTS: Generally, a higher number of SWCNTs, compared to MWCNTs, was deposited  at both the cellular and nuclear level after exposure. Nonetheless, both CNT  types were in physical contact with the nuclei. While particle type dependency  was noticed for the identified genome-wide and gene-specific alterations, no  global DNA methylation alteration on 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) sites was observed  for both CNTs. After exposure to MWCNTs, 2398 genes were hypomethylated (at gene  promoters), and after exposure to SWCNTs, 589 CpG sites (located on 501 genes)  were either hypo- (N = 493 CpG sites) or hypermethylated (N = 96 CpG sites).  Cells exposed to MWCNTs exhibited a better correlation between gene promoter  methylation and gene expression alterations. Differentially methylated and  expressed genes induced changes (MWCNTs > SWCNTs) at different cellular  pathways, such as p53 signalling, DNA damage repair and cell cycle. On the other  hand, SWCNT exposure showed hypermethylation on functionally important genes,  such as SKI proto-oncogene (SKI), glutathione S-transferase pi 1 (GTSP1) and  shroom family member 2 (SHROOM2) and neurofibromatosis type I (NF1), which the  latter is both hypermethylated and downregulated. CONCLUSION: After exposure to both types of CNTs, epigenetic alterations may  contribute to toxic or repair response. Moreover, our results suggest that the  observed differences in the epigenetic response depend on particle type and  differential CNT-nucleus interactions.

Neurofibromatosis type II (NF2) is a disease that needs new solutions.  Vestibular schwannoma (VS) growth causes progressive hearing loss, and the  standard treatment, including surgery and radiotherapy, can further damage the  nerve. There is an urgent need to identify an adjunct therapy that, by enhancing  the efficacy of radiation, can help lower the radiation dose and preserve  hearing. The mechanisms underlying deafness in NF2 are still unclear. One of the  major limitations in studying tumor-induced hearing loss is the lack of mouse  models that allow hearing testing. Here, we developed a cerebellopontine angle  (CPA) schwannoma model that faithfully recapitulates the tumor-induced hearing  loss. Using this model, we discovered that cMET blockade by crizotinib (CRZ)  enhanced schwannoma radiosensitivity by enhancing DNA damage, and CRZ treatment  combined with low-dose radiation was as effective as high-dose radiation. CRZ  treatment had no adverse effect on hearing; however, it did not affect  tumor-induced hearing loss, presumably because cMET blockade did not change  tumor hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) levels. This cMET gene knockdown study  independently confirmed the role of the cMET pathway in mediating the effect of  CRZ. Furthermore, we evaluated the translational potential of cMET blockade in  human schwannomas. We found that human NF2-associated and sporadic VSs showed  significantly elevated HGF expression and cMET activation compared with normal  nerves, which correlated with tumor growth and cyst formation. Using organoid  brain slice culture, cMET blockade inhibited the growth of patient-derived  schwannomas. Our findings provide the rationale and necessary data for the  clinical translation of combined cMET blockade with radiation therapy in  patients with NF2.

Erratum in     Cancer Med. 2025 May;14(10):e70967. doi: 10.1002/cam4.70967.  Epidermal growth receptor (EGFR)-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have  emerged as first-line drugs for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  patients with EFGR mutations. However, most patients with NSCLC show acquired  resistance to EGFR-TKIs, and low expression of NF1 is a mechanism of EGFR-TKI  resistance in lung cancer. However, the mechanism by which NF1 is downregulated  in EGFR-TKI-resistant NSCLC is unclear. Here, we found the increased expression  of miR-641 in NSCLC cells and human NSCLC samples with resistance to TKI  compared to those with sensitive to TKI. In addition, our in vitro experiments  show that overexpression of miR-641 induces TKI resistance in NSCLC cells.  Furthermore, we identified that miR-641 activates ERK signaling by direct  targeting of neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) in NSCLC cells. Our data show that  overexpression of NF1 or silencing of ERK can block miR-641-induced resistance  of NSCLC cells to erlotinib treatment. Importantly, our animal experiments show  that combination of miR-641 inhibition and erlotinib treatment can significantly  inhibit erlotinib-resistant NSCLC growth, inhibit proliferation and induce  apoptosis compared to single-drug treatment. Our findings suggest that increased  expression of miR-641 significantly contributes to erlotinib resistance  development in NSCLC cells through activating ERK signaling by targeting NF1 and  that inhibition of miR-641 may reverse acquired resistance of NSCLC cells to  erlotinib treatment.  © 2018 The Authors.

BACKGROUND: CXCR4 is a chemokine receptor that recruits blood stem cells and  increases tumor cell growth and invasiveness. We examined CXCR4 expression in  vestibular schwannomas (VS) from patients with and without neurofibromatosis  type 2 (NF2) and correlated the levels with the patients' clinical  characteristics. The aim was to determine whether CXCR4 can be used as a  prognostic marker and as a target for systemic therapy. RESULTS: Overall, CXCR4 mRNA levels were 4.6-fold higher in VS versus control;  the levels were 4.9-fold higher in NF2 patients and 4.2-fold higher in sporadic  VS patients. IHC and WB showed heterogeneous protein expression, and CXCR4 was  expressed mainly in S100-positive Schwann cells. There was no correlation  between the CXCR4 protein levels and tumor extension. However, there was a trend  towards correlation between higher expression levels and greater hearing loss. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CXCR4 mRNA and protein levels were determined in VS  samples (n = 60); of these, 30 samples were from patients with NF2. Healthy  nerves from autopsies served as controls. CXCR4 mRNA levels were measured by  PCR, and protein levels were measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western  blotting (WB). Tumor extension and hearing loss were categorized according to  the Hannover Classification as clinical parameters. CONCLUSIONS: CXCR4 mRNA was overexpressed in VS relative to healthy vestibular  nerves, and there was a trend towards higher CXCR4 expression levels being  correlated with greater functional impairment. Thus, CXCR4 may be a prognostic  marker of VS, and CXCR4 inhibition has potential as a systemic approach for the  treatment of VS.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type1 (NF1) is associated with a broad range of  behavioural deficits, and an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory  neurotransmission has been postulated in this disorder. Inhibition is involved  in the control of frequency and stability of motor rhythms. Therefore, we aimed  to explore the link between behavioural motor control, brain rhythms and brain  activity, as assessed by EEG and fMRI in NF1. METHODS: We studied a cohort of 21 participants with NF1 and 20 age- and  gender-matched healthy controls, with a finger-tapping task requiring pacing at  distinct frequencies during EEG and fMRI scans. RESULTS: We found that task performance was significantly different between NF1  and controls, the latter showing higher tapping time precision. The  time-frequency patterns at the beta sub-band (20-26 Hz) mirrored the behavioural  modulations, with similar cyclic synchronization/desynchronization patterns for  both groups. fMRI results showed a higher recruitment of the extrapyramidal  motor system (putamen, cerebellum and red nucleus) in the control group during  the fastest pacing condition. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated impaired precision in rhythmic  pacing behaviour in NF1 as compared with controls. We found a decreased  recruitment of the cerebellum, a structure where inhibitory interneurons are  essential regulators of rhythmic synchronization, and in deep brain regions  pivotally involved in motor pacing. Our findings shed light into the neural  underpinnings of motor timing deficits in NF1.

Individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and plexiform neurofibromas  (PNs) can experience chronic pain. Previous research has examined the  relationship between heart rate variability (HRV) and persistent pain. HRV is an  index of autonomic nervous system functioning, and reflects the variability in  time elapsed between heartbeats. Patients with chronic pain tend to exhibit  lower HRV, which has been associated with poor adaptability, or psychological  flexibility, to stress. The aim of the current study was to examine  relationships between HRV, psychological flexibility, and pain in a sample of  adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with NF1 and PNs. AYA participants (n = 40)  16 to 34 years of age with NF1 completed baseline measures of pain and  psychological functioning, and underwent a 5-minute electrocardiogram (ECG). A  subset of 20 participants completed follow-up questionnaires and a second ECG 8  weeks later. Spectral analyses of ECGs yielded a measure of high-frequency heart  rate variability (HF-HRV). Baseline correlations revealed that lower HF-HRV is  related to greater inflexibility and more pain interference, but not pain  intensity. Moreover, psychological inflexibility significantly mediated the  relationship between HF-HRV and pain interference. Finally, regression models  indicated that baseline psychological inflexibility is a significant predictor  of HF-HRV at follow-up and, separately, that baseline HF-HRV significantly  predicted pain intensity at follow-up. These findings suggest complex mind-body  processes in the experience of pain in NF1, which have not been studied  previously. Implications for pain-related interventions and future research are  discussed.  © 2018 World Institute of Pain.

The neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) gene encodes merlin, a tumor suppressor  protein frequently inactivated in schwannoma, meningioma, and malignant  mesothelioma (MM). The sequence of merlin is similar to that of  ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) proteins which crosslink actin with the plasma  membrane, suggesting that merlin plays a role in transducing extracellular  signals to the actin cytoskeleton. Merlin adopts a distinct closed conformation  defined by specific intramolecular interactions and regulates diverse cellular  events such as transcription, translation, ubiquitination, and miRNA  biosynthesis, many of which are mediated through Hippo and mTOR signaling, which  are known to be closely involved in cancer development. MM is a very aggressive  tumor associated with asbestos exposure, and genetic alterations in NF2 that  abrogate merlin's functional activity are found in about 40% of MMs, indicating  the importance of NF2 inactivation in MM development and progression. In this  review, we summarize the current knowledge of molecular events triggered by  NF2/merlin inactivation, which lead to the development of mesothelioma and other  cancers, and discuss potential therapeutic targets in merlin-deficient  mesotheliomas.

Loss of the Neurofibromatosis 1 (Nf1) protein, neurofibromin, in Drosophila  disrupts circadian rhythms of locomotor activity without impairing central  clock function, suggesting effects downstream of the clock. However, the  relevant cellular mechanisms are not known. Leveraging the discovery of output  circuits for locomotor rhythms, we dissected cellular actions of neurofibromin  in recently identified substrates. Herein, we show that neurofibromin affects  the levels and cycling of calcium in multiple circadian peptidergic neurons. A  prominent site of action is the pars intercerebralis (PI), the fly equivalent of  the hypothalamus, with cell-autonomous effects of Nf1 in PI cells that secrete  DH44. Nf1 interacts genetically with peptide signaling to affect circadian  behavior. We extended these studies to mammals to demonstrate that mouse  astrocytes exhibit a 24-hr rhythm of calcium levels, which is also attenuated by  lack of neurofibromin. These findings establish a conserved role for  neurofibromin in intracellular signaling rhythms within the nervous system.  Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 associates with multiple neoplasms, and the Schwann  cell tumor neurofibroma is the most prevalent. A hallmark feature of  neurofibroma is mast cell infiltration, which is recruited by chemoattractant  stem cell factor (SCF) and has been suggested to sustain neurofibroma  tumorigenesis. In the present study, we use new, genetically engineered Scf mice  to decipher the contributions of tumor-derived SCF and mast cells to  neurofibroma development. We demonstrate that mast cell infiltration is  dependent on SCF from tumor Schwann cells. However, removal of mast cells by  depleting the main SCF source only slightly affects neurofibroma progression.  Other inflammation signatures show that all neurofibromas are associated with  high levels of macrophages regardless of Scf status. These findings suggest an  active inflammation in neurofibromas and partly explain why mast cell removal  alone is not sufficient to relieve tumor burden in this experimental  neurofibroma model. Furthermore, we show that plexiform neurofibromas are highly  associated with injury-prone spinal nerves that are close to flexible vertebras.  In summary, our study details the role of inflammation in neurofibromagenesis.  Our data indicate that prevention of inflammation and possibly also nerve injury  at the observed tumor locations are therapeutic approaches for neurofibroma  prophylaxis and that such treatment should be explored.

Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a tumor-forming disease of the nervous system  caused by deletion or by loss-of-function mutations in NF2, encoding the tumor  suppressing protein neurofibromin 2 (also known as schwannomin or merlin).  Neurofibromin 2 is a member of the ezrin, radixin, moesin (ERM) family of  proteins regulating the cytoskeleton and cell signaling. The correlation of the  tumor-suppressive function and conformation (open or closed) of neurofibromin 2  has been subject to much speculation, often based on extrapolation from other  ERM proteins, and controversy. Here we show that lipid binding results in the  open conformation of neurofibromin 2 and that lipid binding is necessary for  inhibiting cell proliferation. Collectively, our results provide a mechanism in  which the open conformation is unambiguously correlated with lipid binding and  localization to the membrane, which are critical for the tumor-suppressive  function of neurofibromin 2, thus finally reconciling the long-standing  conformation and function debate.

(#)Contributed equally  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to determine if the MOXO  visual- and vocal-distractors-based continuous performance test distinguishes  patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) from those without NF1. METHODS: Thirty-five patients (16 males; mean age 9.91 years) attending a  multidisciplinary NF1 clinic completed the MOXO test. The findings were compared  to 532 healthy age-matched standardized control subjects (285 males) without  ADHD. RESULTS: The overall performance in the MOXO text was significantly worse in the  NF1 group than in controls (p<0.01), but no group-specific pattern was  identified. Impulsivity and hyperactivity were significantly more prominent in  males than females (p<0.01). Compared to controls, the NF1 group exhibited  significantly more failures to respond to target stimuli in the presence of  visual distractors. CONCLUSIONS: MOXO scores are abnormal in patients with NF1, but the test cannot  differentiate between NF1 with ADHD characteristics and ADHD. The test  highlights sex differences in ADHD characteristics in NF1. Overreactivity to  visual distractors may form part of the attention deficit in NF1.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a disease caused by mutation of neurofibromin 1  (NF1), loss of which results in hyperactive Ras signaling and a concomitant  increase in cell proliferation and survival. Patients with neurofibromatosis  type 1 frequently develop tumors such as plexiform neurofibromas and malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Mutation of NF1 or loss of the NF1 protein is  also observed in glioblastoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and ovarian cancer among  other sporadic cancers. A therapy that selectively targets NF1 deficient tumors  would substantially advance our ability to treat these malignancies. To address  the need for these therapeutics, we developed and conducted a synthetic  lethality screen to discover molecules that target yeast lacking the homolog of  NF1, IRA2. One of the lead candidates that was observed to be synthetic lethal  with ira2Δ yeast is Y100. Here, we describe the mechanisms by which Y100 targets  ira2Δ yeast and NF1-deficient tumor cells. Y100 treatment disrupted  proteostasis, metabolic homeostasis, and induced the formation of mitochondrial  superoxide in NF1-deficient cancer cells. Previous studies also indicate that  NF1/Ras-dysregulated tumors may be sensitive to modulators of oxidative and ER  stress. We hypothesize that the use of Y100 and molecules with related  mechanisms of action represent a feasible therapeutic strategy for targeting NF1  deficient cells.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is caused by germline mutations in the NF1 gene  and is characterized by café au lait spots and benign tumours known as  neurofibromas. NF1 encodes the tumour suppressor protein neurofibromin, which  negatively regulates the small GTPase Ras, with the constitutive activation of  Ras signalling resulting from NF1 mutations being thought to underlie  neurofibroma development. We previously showed that knockdown of neurofibromin  triggers epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signalling and that such  signalling is activated in NF1-associated neurofibromas. With the use of a  cell-based drug screening assay, we have now identified the antiallergy drug  tranilast (N-(3,4-dimethoxycinnamoyl) anthranilic acid) as an inhibitor of EMT  and found that it attenuated the expression of mesenchymal markers and  angiogenesis-related genes in NF1-mutated sNF96.2 cells and in neurofibroma  cells from NF1 patients. Tranilast also suppressed the proliferation of  neurofibromin-deficient cells in vitro more effectively than it did that of  intact cells. In addition, tranilast inhibited sNF96.2 cell migration and  proliferation in vivo. Knockdown of type III collagen (COL3A1) also suppressed  the proliferation of neurofibroma cells, whereas expression of COL3A1 and SOX2  was increased in tranilast-resistant cells, suggesting that COL3A1 and the  transcription factor SOX2 might contribute to the development of tranilast  resistance.

In Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) germ line loss of function mutations result in  reduction of cellular neurofibromin content (NF1+/-, NF1 haploinsufficiency).  The Ras-GAP neurofibromin is a very large cytoplasmic protein (2818 AA, 319 kDa)  involved in the RAS-MAPK pathway. Aside from regulation of proliferation, it is  involved in mechanosensoric of cells. We investigated neurofibromin replacement  in cultured human fibroblasts showing reduced amount of neurofibromin. Full  length neurofibromin was produced recombinantly in insect cells and purified.  Protein transduction into cultured fibroblasts was performed employing cell  penetrating peptides along with photochemical internalization. This combination  of transduction strategies ensures the intracellular uptake and the  translocation to the cytoplasm of neurofibromin. The transduced neurofibromin is  functional, indicated by functional rescue of reduced mechanosensoric blindness  and reduced RasGAP activity in cultured fibroblasts of NF1 patients or normal  fibroblasts treated by NF1 siRNA. Our study shows that recombinant neurofibromin  is able to revert cellular effects of NF1 haploinsuffiency in vitro, indicating  a use of protein transduction into cells as a potential treatment strategy for  the monogenic disease NF1.

Freret ME(1), Gutmann DH(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis,  Missouri.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common cancer predisposition syndrome caused  by mutations in the NF1 gene. The NF1-encoded protein (neurofibromin) is an  inhibitor of the oncoprotein RAS and controls cell growth and survival.  Individuals with NF1 are prone to developing low-grade tumors of the optic  nerves, chiasm, tracts, and radiations, termed optic pathway gliomas (OPGs),  which can cause vision loss. A paucity of surgical tumor specimens and of  patient-derived xenografts for investigative studies has limited our  understanding of human NF1-associated OPG (NF1-OPG). However, mice genetically  engineered to harbor Nf1 gene mutations develop optic gliomas that share many  features of their human counterparts. These genetically engineered mouse (GEM)  strains have provided important insights into the cellular and molecular  determinants that underlie mouse Nf1 optic glioma development, maintenance, and  associated vision loss, with relevance by extension to human NF1-OPG disease.  Herein, we review our current understanding of NF1-OPG pathobiology and describe  the mechanisms responsible for tumor initiation, growth, and associated vision  loss in Nf1 GEM models. We also discuss how Nf1 GEM and other preclinical models  can be deployed to identify and evaluate molecularly targeted therapies for OPG,  particularly as they pertain to future strategies aimed at preventing or  improving tumor-associated vision loss in children with NF1.  © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The architecture of individual cells and cell collectives enables functional  specification, a prominent example being the formation of epithelial tubes that  transport fluid or gas in many organs. The intrahepatic bile ducts (IHBDs) form  a tubular network within the liver parenchyma that transports bile to the  intestine. Aberrant biliary 'neoductulogenesis' is also a feature of several  liver pathologies including tumorigenesis. However, the mechanism of biliary  tube morphogenesis in development or disease is not known. Elimination of the  neurofibromatosis type 2 protein (NF2; also known as merlin or neurofibromin 2)  causes hepatomegaly due to massive biliary neoductulogenesis in the mouse liver.  We show that this phenotype reflects unlimited biliary morphogenesis rather than  proliferative expansion. Our studies suggest that NF2 normally limits biliary  morphogenesis by coordinating lumen expansion and cell architecture.

The neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor protein Merlin functions as  a negative regulator of cell growth and actin dynamics in different cell types  amongst which Schwann cells have been extensively studied. In contrast, the  presence and the role of Merlin in oligodendrocytes, the myelin forming cells  within the CNS, have not been elucidated. In this work, we demonstrate that  Merlin immunoreactivity was broadly distributed in the white matter throughout  the central nervous system. Following Merlin expression during development in  the cerebellum, Merlin could be detected in the cerebellar white matter tract at  early postnatal stages as shown by its co-localization with Olig2-positive cells  as well as in adult brain sections where it was aligned with myelin basic  protein containing fibers. This suggests that Merlin is expressed in immature  and mature oligodendrocytes. Expression levels of Merlin were low in  oligodendrocytes as compared to astrocytes and neurons throughout development.  Expression of Merlin in oligodendroglia was further supported by its  identification in either immortalized cell lines of oligodendroglial origin or  in primary oligodendrocyte cultures. In these cultures, the two main splice  variants of Nf2 could be detected. Merlin was localized in clusters within the  nuclei and in the cytoplasm. Overexpressing Merlin in oligodendrocyte cell lines  strengthened reduced impedance in XCELLigence measurements and Ki67 stainings in  cultures over time. In addition, the initiation and elongation of cellular  projections were reduced by Merlin overexpression. Consistently, cell migration  was retarded in scratch assays done on Nf2-transfected oligodendrocyte cell  lines. These data suggest that Merlin actively modulates process outgrowth and  migration in oligodendrocytes.

(2)Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the National  Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.  BACKGROUND: Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) in neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) can cause  substantial morbidities. Clinical trials targeting PN have recently described  decreases in PN volumes. However, no previous study has assessed the association  between changes in PN volumes and PN-related morbidities. Our objective was to  assess if increasing PN volume in NF1 is associated with increasing PN-related  morbidity. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of patients enrolled on the NCI NF1  natural history study with ≥7 years of data available. Morbidities including  pain, motor dysfunction, vision loss, and PN-related surgery were assessed at  time of baseline PN MRI with volumetric analysis and time of MRI with maximum PN  volume. RESULTS: Forty-one patients (median age at baseline 8 y) with 57 PN were  included. At baseline, 40 PN had at least 1 PN-associated morbidity. During the  observation period, 27 PN required increasing pain medication, and these PN grew  faster per year (median difference 8.3%; 95% CI: 2.4, 13.8%) than those PN which  did not. PN resulting in motor impairment at baseline (n = 11) had larger  volumes compared with those that did not (median difference 461 mL; 95% CI:  66.9, 820). CONCLUSIONS: Many NF1 PN were associated with clinically significant morbidity  at baseline, highlighting the need for longitudinal morbidity evaluations  starting at an early age to capture changes in PN-associated morbidities.  Prospective evaluation of standardized patient reported and functional outcomes  in clinical trials are ongoing and may allow further characterization of the  association of PN volume increase or decrease and clinical changes.

Retraction in     Oncol Lett. 2018 Nov;16(5):6209. doi: 10.3892/ol.2018.9405.  Gene mutations are involved in the development of malignant mesothelioma.  Important mutations have been identified in the genes for cyclin-dependent  kinase inhibitor 2A (p16) alternative reading frame, breast cancer-associated  protein 1 (BAP1) and neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). Previously, the utility of  detecting the loss of BAP1 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and p16-deletion by  fluorescence in situ hybridization has been identified in several studies.  However, NF2-associated examinations have not been performed. The present study  aimed to evaluate the expression of yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) and tafazzin  (TAZ) protein, which are associated with NF2 gene mutations, in malignant  mesothelioma (MM) and reactive mesothelial cells (RMCs). Formalin-fixed  paraffin-embedded tissues from 31 MM and 33 RMC samples were analyzed. The  expression of YAP1 and TAZ protein were examined by IHC. Positivity for YAP1 was  identified 27/31 MM and 15/33 RMC samples. Positivity for TAZ was identified in  28/31 MM and 18/33 RMC samples. Using the optimal cutoff points determined by  the receiver operating characteristic curve, a positive IHC result for YAP1 and  TAZ was 74% sensitive and 94% specific for detecting MM. The results indicate  that increased expression of YAP1 and TAZ may be associated with mesothelial  tumorization, and aid in the diagnosis of MM.

Conventional differential expression analyses have been successfully employed to  identify genes whose levels change across experimental conditions. One  limitation of this approach is the inability to discover central regulators that  control gene expression networks. In addition, while methods for identifying  central nodes in a network are widely implemented, the bioinformatics validation  process and the theoretical error estimates that reflect the uncertainty in each  step of the analysis are rarely considered. Using the betweenness centrality  measure, we identified Etv5 as a potential tissue-level regulator in murine  neurofibromatosis type 1 (Nf1) low-grade brain tumors (optic gliomas). As such,  the expression of Etv5 and Etv5 target genes were increased in multiple  independently-generated mouse optic glioma models relative to non-neoplastic  (normal healthy) optic nerves, as well as in the cognate human tumors (pilocytic  astrocytoma) relative to normal human brain. Importantly, differential Etv5 and  Etv5 network expression was not directly the result of Nf1 gene dysfunction in  specific cell types, but rather reflects a property of the tumor as an aggregate  tissue. Moreover, this differential Etv5 expression was independently validated  at the RNA and protein levels. Taken together, the combined use of network  analysis, differential RNA expression findings, and experimental validation  highlights the potential of the computational network approach to provide new  insights into tumor biology.

Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive soft tissue  sarcomas that can occur sporadically or in the setting of the Neurofibromatosis  type 1 (NF1) cancer predisposition syndrome. These tumors carry a dismal overall  survival. Previous work in our lab had identified ATRX chromatin remodeler  (ATRX), previously termed, Alpha Thalassemia/Mental Retardation Syndrome X  Linked as a gene mutated in a subset of MPNSTs. Given the great need for novel  biomarkers and therapeutic targets for MPNSTs, we sought to determine the  expression of ATRX in a larger subset of sporadic and NF1 associated MPNSTs  (NF1-MPNSTs). We performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) on 74 MPNSTs (43  NF1-associated and 31 sporadic), 21 plexiform neurofibromas, and 9 atypical  neurofibromas. Using this approach, we have demonstrated that 58% (43/74) of  MPNSTs have aberrant ATRX expression (<80% nuclear expression) compared to only  7% (2/30) of benign (plexiform and atypical) neurofibromas. Second, we  demonstrated that 65% (28/43) of NF1-MPNSTs displayed aberrant ATRX expression  as did 48% (15/31) of sporadic MPNSTs. Finally, we show that aberrant ATRX  expression was associated with a significantly decreased overall survival for  patients with NF1-MPNST (median OS of 17.9 months for aberrant expression and  median OS not met (>120 months) for intact expression, p = 0.0276). In summary,  we demonstrate that ATRX is aberrantly expressed in the majority of NF1-MPNSTs,  but not plexiform or atypical neurofibromas. Additionally, aberrant ATRX  expression is associated with decreased overall survival in NF1-MPNST, but not  sporadic MPNST and may serve as a prognostic marker for patients with NF1-MPNST.

PURPOSE: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the result of inherited mutations in  the NF1 tumor suppressor gene, which encodes the protein neurofibromin. Eye  manifestations are common in NF1 with recent reports describing a vascular  dysplasia in the retina and choroid. Common features of NF1 retinopathy include  tortuous and dilated feeder vessels that terminate in capillary tufts, increased  endothelial permeability, and neovascularization. Given the retinal vascular  phenotype observed in persons with NF1, we hypothesize that preserving  neurofibromin may be a novel strategy to control pathologic retinal  neovascularization. METHODS: Nf1 expression in human endothelial cells (EC) was reduced using small  hairpin (sh) RNA and EC proliferation, migration, and capacity to form  vessel-like networks were assessed in response to VEGF and hypoxia. Wild-type  (WT), Nf1 heterozygous (Nf1+/-), and Nf1flox/+;Tie2cre pups were subjected to  hyperoxia/hypoxia using the oxygen-induced retinopathy model. Retinas were  analyzed quantitatively for extent of retinal vessel dropout,  neovascularization, and capillary branching. RESULTS: Neurofibromin expression was suppressed in response to VEGF, which  corresponded with activation of Mek-Erk and PI3-K-Akt signaling.  Neurofibromin-deficient EC exhibited enhanced proliferation and network  formation in response to VEGF and hypoxia via an Akt-dependent mechanism. In  response to hyperoxia/hypoxia, Nf1+/- retinas exhibited increased vessel dropout  and neovascularization when compared with WT retinas. Neovascularization was  similar between Nf1+/- and Nf1flox/+;Tie2cre retinas, but capillary drop out in  Nf1flox/+;Tie2cre retinas was significantly reduced when compared with Nf1+/-  retinas. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that neurofibromin expression is essential for  controlling endothelial cell proliferation and retinal neovascularization and  therapies targeting neurofibromin-deficient EC may be beneficial.

Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is a rare tumor suppressor syndrome that manifests  with multiple schwannomas and meningiomas. There are no effective drug therapies  for these benign tumors and conventional therapies have limited efficacy.  Various model systems have been created and several drug targets have been  implicated in NF2-driven tumorigenesis based on known effects of the absence of  merlin, the product of the NF2 gene. We tested priority compounds based on known  biology with traditional dose-concentration studies in meningioma and schwann  cell systems. Concurrently, we studied functional kinome and gene expression in  these cells pre- and post-treatment to determine merlin deficient molecular  phenotypes. Cell viability results showed that three agents (GSK2126458,  Panobinostat, CUDC-907) had the greatest activity across schwannoma and  meningioma cell systems, but merlin status did not significantly influence  response. In vivo, drug effect was tumor specific with meningioma, but not  schwannoma, showing response to GSK2126458 and Panobinostat. In culture, changes  in both the transcriptome and kinome in response to treatment clustered  predominantly based on tumor type. However, there were differences in both gene  expression and functional kinome at baseline between meningioma and schwannoma  cell systems that may form the basis for future selective therapies. This work  has created an openly accessible resource (www.synapse.org/SynodosNF2) of fully  characterized isogenic schwannoma and meningioma cell systems as well as a rich  data source of kinome and transcriptome data from these assay systems before and  after treatment that enables single and combination drug discovery based on  molecular phenotype.

BACKGROUND: Gene mutations within the RAS-MAPK signaling cascade result in  Noonan syndrome (NS), neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), and related disorders.  Recent research has documented an increased risk for social difficulties and  features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) among children with these conditions.  Despite this emerging evidence, the neuropsychological characteristics  associated with social skills deficits are not well understood, particularly for  children with NS. METHODS: Parents of children with NS (n = 39), NF1 (n = 39), and unaffected  siblings (n = 32) between the ages of 8 and 16 years were administered  well-validated caregiver questionnaires assessing their child's social skills,  language abilities, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms and  anxiety. RESULTS: With respect to overall social skills, average ratings of children in  both clinical groups were similar, and indicated weaker social skills compared  to unaffected siblings. Although ratings of social skills were outside of normal  limits for more than four in ten children within the clinical groups, most of  the deficits were mild/moderate. Fifteen percent of the children with NS and 5%  of the children with NF1 were rated as having severe social skills impairment  (< - 2SD). Independent of diagnosis, having fewer ADHD symptoms or better  social-pragmatic language skills was predictive of stronger social skills. CONCLUSIONS: Amidst efforts to support social skill development among children  and adolescents with RASopathies, neuropsychological correlates such as social  language competence, attention, and behavioral self-regulation could be  important targets of intervention.

Loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene causes the autosomal dominant condition,  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Children and adults with NF1 suffer from  pathologies including benign and malignant tumors to cognitive deficits,  seizures, growth abnormalities, and peripheral neuropathies. NF1 encodes  neurofibromin, a Ras-GTPase activating protein, and NF1 mutations result in  hyperactivated Ras signaling in patients. Existing NF1 mutant mice mimic  individual aspects of NF1, but none comprehensively models the disease. We  describe a potentially novel Yucatan miniswine model bearing a heterozygotic  mutation in NF1 (exon 42 deletion) orthologous to a mutation found in NF1  patients. NF1+/ex42del miniswine phenocopy the wide range of manifestations seen  in NF1 patients, including café au lait spots, neurofibromas, axillary  freckling, and neurological defects in learning and memory. Molecular analyses  verified reduced neurofibromin expression in swine NF1+/ex42del fibroblasts, as  well as hyperactivation of Ras, as measured by increased expression of its  downstream effectors, phosphorylated ERK1/2, SIAH, and the checkpoint regulators  p53 and p21. Consistent with altered pain signaling in NF1, dysregulation of  calcium and sodium channels was observed in dorsal root ganglia expressing  mutant NF1. Thus, these NF1+/ex42del miniswine recapitulate the disease and  provide a unique, much-needed tool to advance the study and treatment of NF1.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) presents a wide range of clinical  manifestations, including bone alterations. Studies that seek to understand  cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying NF1 orthopedic problems are of  great importance to better understand the pathogenesis and the development of  new therapies. Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) are being used as an in vitro  model for several diseases and appear as a suitable model for NF1. The aim of  this study was to evaluate in vitro chondrogenic differentiation of DPSCs from  individuals with NF1 using two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D)  cultures. RESULTS: To fulfill the criteria of the International Society for Cellular  Therapy, DPSCs were characterized by surface antigen expression and by their  multipotentiality, being induced to differentiate towards adipogenic,  osteogenic, and chondrogenic lineages in 2D cultures. Both DPSCs from  individuals with NF1 (NF1 DPSCs) and control cultures were positive for CD90,  CD105, CD146 and negative for CD13, CD14, CD45 and CD271, and successfully  differentiated after the protocols. Chondrogenic differentiation was evaluated  in 2D and in 3D (pellet) cultures, which were further evaluated by optical  microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). 2D cultures showed  greater extracellular matrix deposition in NF1 DPSCs comparing with controls  during chondrogenic differentiation. In semithin sections, control pellets  hadhomogenous-sized intra and extracelullar matrix vesicles, whereas NF1  cultures had matrix vesicles of different sizes. TEM analysis showed higher  amount of collagen fibers in NF1 cultures compared with control cultures. CONCLUSION: NF1 DPSCs presented increased extracellular matrix deposition during  chondrogenic differentiation, which could be related to skeletal changes in  individuals with NF1.

BACKGROUND: This study explores whether objective, quantitative radiomic  biomarkers derived from magnetic resonance (MR), positron emission tomography  (PET), and computed tomography (CT) may be useful in reliably distinguishing  malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) from benign plexiform  neurofibromas (PN). METHODS: A registration and segmentation pipeline was established using a cohort  of NF1 patients with histopathological diagnosis of PN or MPNST, and medical  imaging of the PN including MR and PET-CT. The corrected MR datasets were  registered to the corresponding PET-CT via landmark-based registration. PET  standard-uptake value (SUV) thresholds were used to guide segmentation of  volumes of interest: MPNST-associated PET-hot regions (SUV≥3.5) and  PN-associated PET-elevated regions (2.0<SUV<3.5). Quantitative imaging features  were extracted from the MR, PET, and CT data and compared for statistical  differences. Intensity histogram features included (mean, media, maximum,  variance, full width at half maximum, entropy, kurtosis, and skewness), while  image texture was quantified using Law's texture energy measures, grey-level  co-occurrence matrices, and neighborhood grey-tone difference matrices. RESULTS: For each of the 20 NF1 subjects, a total of 320 features were extracted  from the image data. Feature reduction and statistical testing identified 9  independent radiomic biomarkers from the MR data (4 intensity and 5 texture) and  4 PET (2 intensity and 2 texture) were different between the PET-hot versus  PET-elevated volumes of interest. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests imaging features can be used to distinguish  malignancy in NF1-realted tumors, which could improve MPNST risk assessment and  positively impact clinical management of NF1 patients.

BACKGROUND: Meningiomas are the most common primary brain tumor in adults, and  somatic loss of the neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene is a  frequent genetic event. There is no effective treatment for tumors that recur or  continue to grow despite surgery and/or radiation. Therefore, targeted therapies  that either delay tumor progression or cause tumor shrinkage are much needed.  Our earlier work established mammalian target of rapamycin complex mTORC1/mTORC2  activation in NF2-deficient meningiomas. METHODS: High-throughput kinome analyses were performed in NF2-null human  arachnoidal and meningioma cell lines to identify functional kinome changes upon  NF2 loss. Immunoblotting confirmed the activation of kinases and demonstrated  effectiveness of drugs to block the activation. Drugs, singly and in  combination, were screened in cells for their growth inhibitory activity.  Antitumor drug efficacy was tested in an orthotopic meningioma model. RESULTS: Erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular receptor tyrosine kinases (EPH  RTKs), c-KIT, and Src family kinase (SFK) members, which are biological targets  of dasatinib, were among the top candidates activated in NF2-null cells.  Dasatinib significantly inhibited phospho-EPH receptor A2 (pEPHA2), pEPHB1,  c-KIT, and Src/SFK in NF2-null cells, showing no cross-talk with mTORC1/2  signaling. Posttreatment kinome analyses showed minimal adaptive changes. While  dasatinib treatment showed some activity, dual mTORC1/2 inhibitor and its  combination with dasatinib elicited stronger growth inhibition in meningiomas. CONCLUSION: Co-targeting mTORC1/2 and EPH RTK/SFK pathways could be a novel  effective treatment strategy for NF2-deficient meningiomas.

OBJECTIVE: Outside of procedural-based methods, there are currently no  established medical treatments for cutaneous neurofibroma (cNF), which afflict  up to 99% of patients with NF1. Further, adult patients often report cNF are the  greatest burden of living with NF1. The Neurofibromatosis Therapeutic  Acceleration Program (NTAP) launched a think tank to address core questions to  facilitate development of effective therapeutics for cNF in people with NF1. METHODS: Experts (with and without explicit experience with NF1 or cNF) from  multiple scientific and medical disciplines, representing the ranks of academia,  industry, and government agencies, were invited to become a member of a team  addressing a specific subset of questions pertinent to cNF. Teams met monthly to  review published and unpublished materials, and created summaries about the  material known and unknown that may influence therapeutic development for cNF.  Teams prioritized questions and organized supporting data, which was presented  to the entire body of experts by each team at a research summit. RESULTS: Four themes were identified as being relevant to creating a  comprehensive research strategy for cNF: (1) establishing definitions of cNF,  (2) determining the biology of cNF with respect to tumor initiation,  progression, and maintenance, (3) outlining the factors that guide therapies  development, and (4) defining core considerations for clinical trials design and  optimization for cNF. CONCLUSION: Considerations and key questions for each of the thematic areas were  identified and provided basis for a request for applications launched by NTAP  focused on cNF and are described in the accompanying articles of this  supplement.  © 2018 The Author(s).

OBJECTIVE: A group of experts in dermatology, genetics, neuroscience, and  regenerative medicine collaborated to summarize current knowledge on the defined  factors contributing to cutaneous neurofibroma (cNF) development and to provide  consensus recommendations for future research priorities to gain an improved  understanding of the biology of cNF. METHODS: The group members reviewed published and unpublished data on cNF and  related diseases via literature search, defined a set of key topic areas deemed  critical in cNF pathogenesis, and developed recommendations in a series of  consensus meetings. RESULTS: Five specific topic areas were identified as being relevant to  providing an enhanced understanding of the biology of cNF: (1) defining the  human cells of origin; (2) understanding the role of the microenvironment,  focusing on neurons, mast cells, and fibroblasts; (3) defining the genetic and  molecular differences between the cNFs, focusing on size and number; (4)  understanding if sex hormones are critical for cNF development or progression;  and (5) identifying challenges in establishing in vitro and in vivo models  representing human cNF. CONCLUSIONS: The complexity of cNF biology stems from its heterogeneity at  multiple levels including genetic, spatial involvement, temporal development,  and cellular composition. We propose a unified working model for cNF that builds  a framework to address the key questions about cNF that, when answered, will  provide the necessary understanding of cNF biology to allow meaningful  development of therapies.  © 2018 The Author(s).

OBJECTIVE: Several clinical trials targeting cutaneous neurofibromas (cNF) have  been conducted; however, none has resulted in meaningful changes to care. The  Clinical Trial Design and Development subgroup's goals were to (1) define key  considerations in the design of clinical trials for cNF, (2) summarize existing  data in relation to these considerations, and (3) provide consensus  recommendations about key elements of trial design to accelerate the clinical  development of therapies for cNF. METHODS: The subgroup, with experts from genetics, dermatology, neurology,  oncology, and basic science, spanning academia, government research, and  regulatory programs, and industry, reviewed published and unpublished data on  clinical trials for cNF and other diseases in the skin. Discussions of these  data resulted in formulation of a list of priority issues to address in order to  develop efficient and effective clinical trials for cNF. RESULTS: The subgroup identified 2 natural history studies of cNF, 4 priority  outcome measures, and 6 patient-reported outcome tools for potential use in  efficacy trials of cNF. Time to initiate intervention, patient eligibility,  mechanism of action, route of administration, safety monitoring, and regulatory  agency interactions were identified as key factors to consider when designing  clinical trials for cNF. CONCLUSIONS: Alignment on endpoints and methods for the measurement and  quantification of cNF represent a priority for therapeutic development for cNF.  Advances in technological methods and outcome tools utilized in other skin  diseases may be applicable to cNF studies. Patient age is an important factor  guiding trial design and clinical development path.  © 2018 The Author(s).

OBJECTIVE: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are aggressive  sarcomas characterized by high recurrence rates and early metastases. These  tumors arise more frequently within neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and present  with resistance during standard chemotherapy leading to increased mortality and  morbidity in those patients. In vitro all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and MEK  inhibitors (MEKi) were shown to inhibit tumor proliferation, especially when  applied in combination. Therefore, we established a nude mouse model to  investigate if treatment of xenografts derived from NF1 associated S462 and T265  MPNST cells respond to ATRA and the MEKi PD0325901. RESULTS: We demonstrated that human NF1 associated MPNST derived from S462 but  not T265 cells form solid subcutaneous tumors in Foxn1 nude mice but not in  Balb/c, SHO or Shorn mice. We verified a characteristic staining pattern of  human MPNST xenografts by immunohistochemistry. Therapeutic effects of ATRA  and/or MEKi PD0325901 on growth of S462 MPNST xenografts in Foxn1 nude mice were  not demonstrated in vitro, as we did not observe significant suppression of  MPNST growth compared with placebo treatment.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are an aggressive form of soft  tissue neoplasm with extremely poor prognosis and no effective medical options  currently available. MPNSTs can occur either sporadically or in association with  the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) syndrome. Importantly, activation of  RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and WNT/CTNNB1 signaling pathways has been  reported in both NF1-related and late-stage sporadic MPNSTs. In this study, we  found that DAW22, a natural sesquiterpene coumarin compound isolated from Ferula  ferulaeoides (Steud.) Korov., could inhibit cell proliferation and colony  formation in five established human MPNST cancer cell lines. Further molecular  mechanism exploration indicated that DAW22 could target the main components in  the MPNST tumorigenic pathways: namely suppress phosphorylation of AKT and ERK,  and reduce levels of non-phospho (active) CTNNB1. Using the xenograft mouse  model transplanted with human MPNST cancer cell line, daily treatment with DAW22  for 25 days was effective in reducing tumor growth. These results support DAW22  as an alternative therapeutic compound for MPNST treatment by affecting multiple  signaling transduction pathways in its disease progression.  © 2018 The Authors.

INTRODUCTION: Dopamine dysregulation has been identified as a key modulator of  behavioural impairment in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and a potential  therapeutic target. Preclinical research demonstrates reduced dopamine in the  brains of genetically engineered NF1 mouse strains is associated with reduced  spatial-learning and attentional dysfunction. Methylphenidate, a stimulant  medication that increases dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission,  rescued the behavioural and dopamine abnormalities. Although preliminary  clinical trials have demonstrated that methylphenidate is effective in treating  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in children with NF1,  its therapeutic effect on cognitive performance is unclear. The primary aim of  this clinical trial is to assess the efficacy of methylphenidate for reducing  attention deficits, spatial working memory impairments and ADHD symptoms in  children with NF1. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of  methylphenidate with a two period crossover design. Thirty-six participants with  NF1 aged 7-16 years will be randomised to one of two treatment sequences: 6  weeks of methylphenidate followed by 6 weeks of placebo or; 6 weeks of placebo  followed by 6 weeks of methylphenidate. Neurocognitive and behavioural outcomes  as well as neuroimaging measures will be completed at baseline and repeated at  the end of each treatment condition (week 6, week 12). Primary outcome measures  are omission errors on the Conners Continuous Performance Test-II (attention),  between-search errors on the Spatial Working Memory task from the Cambridge  Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (spatial working memory) and the  Inattentive and Hyperactivity/Impulsivity Symptom Scales on the Conners  3-Parent. Secondary outcomes will examine the effect of methylphenidate on  executive functions, attention, visuospatial skills, behaviour, fine-motor  skills, language, social skills and quality of life. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial has hospital ethics approval and the  results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and  international conferences.

Purpose To evaluate whether patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-a  multisystem neurodevelopmental disorder with myriad imaging manifestations,  including focal transient myelin vacuolization within the deep gray nuclei,  brainstem, and cerebellum-exhibit differences in cortical and subcortical  structures, particularly in subcortical regions where these abnormalities  manifest. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, by using clinically  obtained three-dimensional T1-weighted MR images and established image analysis  methods, 10 intracranial volume-corrected subcortical and 34 cortical regions of  interest (ROIs) were quantitatively assessed in 32 patients with NF1 and 245  age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. By using linear models, ROI  cortical thicknesses and volumes were compared between patients with NF1 and  control subjects, as a function of age. With hierarchic cluster analysis and  partial correlations, differences in the pattern of association between cortical  and subcortical ROI volumes in patients with NF1 and control subjects were also  evaluated. Results Patients with NF1 exhibited larger subcortical volumes and  thicker cortices of select regions, particularly the hippocampi, amygdalae,  cerebellar white matter, ventral diencephalon, thalami, and occipital cortices.  For the thalami and pallida and 22 cortical ROIs in patients with NF1, a  significant inverse association between volume and age was found, suggesting  that volumes decrease with increasing age. Moreover, compared with those in  control subjects, ROIs in patients with NF1 exhibited a distinct pattern of  clustering and partial correlations. Discussion Neurofibromatosis type 1 is  characterized by larger subcortical volumes and thicker cortices of select  structures. Most apparent within the hippocampi, amygdalae, cerebellar white  matter, ventral diencephalon, thalami and occipital cortices, these  neurofibromatosis type 1-associated volumetric changes may, in part, be age  dependent. © RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this  article.

Investigating protein-protein interactions (PPIs) holds great potential for  therapeutic applications, since they mediate intricate cell signaling networks  in physiological and disease states. However, their complex and multifaceted  nature poses a major challenge for biochemistry and medicinal chemistry, thereby  limiting the druggability of biological partners participating in PPIs.  Molecular Dynamics (MD) provides a solid framework to study the reciprocal  shaping of proteins' interacting surfaces. Here, we review successful  applications of MD-based methods developed in our group to predict interfacial  areas involved in PPIs of pharmaceutical interest. We report two interesting  examples of how structural, dynamic and energetic information can be combined  into efficient strategies which, complemented by experiments, can lead to the  design of new small molecules with promising activities against cancer and  infections. Our advances in targeting key PPIs in angiogenic pathways and  antigen-antibody recognition events will be discussed for their role in drug  discovery and chemical biology.

Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) can cause a wide range of cognitive deficits, but  its underlying nature is still unknown. We investigated the correlation between  cognitive performance and specific patterns of resting-state brain metabolism in  a NF1 sample. Sixteen individuals diagnosed with NF1 underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT  brain imaging followed by a neuropsychological assessment. Principal component  analysis was performed on 17 measures of cognitive function and a machine  learning approach based on Gaussian Process Regression was used to individually  predict the components that represented most of the variance in the  neuropsychological data. The accuracy of the method was estimated using  leave-one-out cross-validation and its significance through permutation testing.  We found that only the first component could be accurately predicted from  resting state metabolism (r = 0.926, p<0.001). Multiple and heterogeneous  measures contribute to the first component, mainly WISC/WAIS Procedure and  Verbal IQ, verbal memory and fluency. Considering the accurate prediction of  measures of neuropsychological performance based on brain metabolism in NF1  patients, this suggests an underlying metabolic pattern that relates to  cognitive performance in this group.

From 2005 to 2010, 20 consecutive patients with fully manifested  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) underwent elective neurofibroma resection at our  institution (Departments of Plastic Surgery and of Odontostomatology). Specimens  were photographed under optical microscope and confocal laser scanning  microscopy (CLSM) with ultra-high accuracy of detail, including depth of field.  Patients were followed up for a minimum of 4 years and up to a maximum of 12  years, postsurgery. While all nonrecurring lesions showed intense fluorescence,  six of the seven lesions with absence of fluorescence under CLSM recurred at a  mean of 5.5 years after surgical excision. Among the re-excised lesions, 3 were  diagnosed as malignant at the subsequent removal. Despite the limitation of a  small cohort, CLSM appears to be a simple and low-cost technique to  differentiate forms of neurofibromas with low and high risk of recurrence and  malignant degeneration.

Electronic address: wuhao622@sina.cn.  BACKGROUND: The great majority of sporadic vestibular schwannomas (VSs) are due  to the mutations of the NF2 gene encoding merlin. Sporadic VSs exhibit variable  growth patterns and only a small fraction of the tumours are fast-growing;  however, the underlying mechanisms remain undefined. METHODS: DNA sequencing and dosage analysis were used to identify the NF2  mutation status in sporadic schwannomas. The expression and sub-cellular  localization of merlin and p53-MDM2 were assessed by immunoblotting, qRT-PCR and  immunofluorescence. In vitro and in vivo studies were performed to reveal the  effects of Nutlin-3 (a MDM2 inhibitor) and/or MG-132(a proteasome inhibitor) on  schwannomas. The proliferation of schwannoma cells was assessed by CCK-8 assay,  EdU staining and Flow cytometry analysis. FINDINGS: Double genetic hits of NF2 tended to occur in fast-growing tumours,  characterized by the absence of merlin. The deregulation of p53-MDM2 was  demonstrated to mediate merlin-deficient tumour growth, characterized by a  nuclear accumulation of stabilized MDM2, contributing to a nuclear export of p53  for degradation. Nutlin-3 blocked the proliferation of schwannoma cells via a  cooperative recovery of merlin and p53, accompanied by the shuttling of both  proteins from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. We further demonstrated a difference  in the sensitivity to Nutlin-3 between schwannoma cells with and without merlin  expression. Nutlin-3 combined with MG-132 narrowed this between-group difference  and triggered stronger inhibitory effects on the growth of schwannomas through  coordinated reactivation of p53. INTERPRETATION: These findings present treatment strategies directed on the  pathogenesis of sporadic schwannomas. FUND: National Natural Science Foundation  of China.  Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is caused by heterozygous  loss-of-function variants in the NF1 gene encoding neurofibromin which serves as  a tumor suppressor that inhibits RAS signaling and regulates cell proliferation  and differentiation. While, the only well-established functional domain in the  NF1 protein is the GAP-related domain (GRD), most of the identified  non-truncating disease-causing variants are located outside of this domain,  supporting the existence of other important disease-associated domains.  Identifying these domains may reveal novel functions of NF1. METHODS: By implementing inferential statistics combined with machine-learning  methods, we developed a novel NF1-specific functional prediction model that  focuses on nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs). The model enables  annotating all possible NF1 nonsynonymous variants, thus mapping the range of  pathogenic non-truncating variants at the codon level across the NF1 gene. FINDINGS: The generated model demonstrates high absolute prediction value for  missense and splice-site variations (area under the ROC curve of 0.96)  outperforming 14 other established models. By reviewing the entire dataset of  nonsynonymous variants, two novel domains (Armadillo type fold 1 and 2) were  identified as being associated with pathogenicity (OR 1.86; CI 1.04 to 3.34 and  OR 2.08; CI 1.08 to 4.04, respectively; P < .05). Specific exons and codons  associated with increased pathogenicity were also detected along the gene inside  and outside the GRD domain. INTERPRETATION: The developed model, enabled better prediction of pathogenicity  for variants in NF1 gene, as well as elucidation of novel NF1-associated domains  in addition to the GRD.

BACKGROUND: Cutaneous neurofibromas cause disfigurement and discomfort in  individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1). METHODS: The primary objective of this phase II, open-label, single-arm trial  was to assess whether orally administered everolimus reduced the surface volume  of cutaneous neurofibromas in patients with NF-1. RESULTS: Of 22 patients who took the study drug, 17 completed the trial; 5  patients withdrew due to adverse events. Sixteen patients had photographs of  sufficient quality for assessment of the primary outcome. A significant  reduction in lesion surface volume, defined as an end of trial volume > 2  standard errors (SE) less than baseline volume, was observed for 4/31 lesions  (13%) from 3/16 patients (19%). Additionally, a statistically significant  absolute change in average height for paired lesions was observed (p = 0.048).  Although not a prespecified outcome measure, a dramatic reduction in the size of  3 large plexiform neurofibromas with a cutaneous component was also noted and  documented by measurement of maximum circumference or magnetic resonance  imaging-based volumetric analysis. Adverse events were common in this trial, but  no serious adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Although this was a small, exploratory trial that was not powered  for significance, the reduction in surface volume observed in this study is  noteworthy assuming that the natural course for untreated lesions is to maintain  or increase in volume. Future studies are needed with larger study populations  that incorporate longer durations of treatment and better standardization of  volumetric measurements.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a dominantly inherited tumor  predisposition syndrome that targets the peripheral nervous system. It is caused  by mutations of the NF1 gene which serve as a negative regulator of the cellular  Ras/MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinases) signaling pathway. Owing to the  complexity in some parts of clinical diagnoses and the need for better  understanding of its molecular relationships, a genetic characterization of this  disorder will be helpful in the clinical setting. METHODS: In this study, we present a customized targeted gene panel of  NF1/KRAS/BRAF/p53 and SPRED1 genes combined with Multiple Ligation-Dependent  Probe Amplification analysis for the NF1 mutation screening in a cohort of  patients clinically suspected as NF1. RESULTS: In this study, we identified 73 NF1 mutations and two BRAF novel  variants from 100 NF1 patients who were suspected as having NF1. These genetic  alterations are heterogeneous and distribute in a complicated way without  clustering in either cysteine-serine-rich domain or within the GAP-related  domain. We also detected fifteen multi-exon deletions within the NF1 gene by  MLPA Analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that a genetic screening using a NGS panel  with high coverage of Ras-signaling components combined with Multiple  Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification analysis will enable differential  diagnosis of patients with overlapping clinical features.

Schwannomas are common, highly morbid and medically untreatable tumors that can  arise in patients with germ line as well as somatic mutations in  neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). These mutations most commonly result in the loss  of function of the NF2-encoded protein, Merlin. Little is known about how Merlin  functions endogenously as a tumor suppressor and how its loss leads to oncogenic  transformation in Schwann cells (SCs). Here, we identify nuclear factor  kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB)-inducing kinase (NIK) as  a potential drug target driving NF-κB signaling and Merlin-deficient schwannoma  genesis. Using a genomic approach to profile aberrant tumor signaling pathways,  we describe multiple upregulated NF-κB signaling elements in human and murine  schwannomas, leading us to identify a caspase-cleaved, proteasome-resistant NIK  kinase domain fragment that amplifies pathogenic NF-κB signaling.  Lentiviral-mediated transduction of this NIK fragment into normal SCs promotes  proliferation, survival, and adhesion while inducing schwannoma formation in a  novel in vivo orthotopic transplant model. Furthermore, we describe an  NF-κB-potentiated hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) to MET proto-oncogene receptor  tyrosine kinase (c-Met) autocrine feed-forward loop promoting SC proliferation.  These innovative studies identify a novel signaling axis underlying schwannoma  formation, revealing new and potentially druggable schwannoma vulnerabilities  with future therapeutic potential.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disease that predisposes  individuals to developing benign neurofibromas and malignant peripheral nerve  sheath tumors (MPNST). The mechanism of NF1-tumorigenesis or the curatives have  not been established. Using unique trascriptome and proteome integration method,  iPEACH (1), we previously identified translationally controlled tumor protein  (TCTP) as a novel biological target for NF1-associated tumors (2). Here, we  identified specific TCTP-interacting proteins by sequential affinity  purification and data-independent mass spectrometry acquisition (AP-DIA/SWATH)  to investigate the role of TCTP in NF1-associated malignant tumors. TCTP mainly  interacts with proteins related to protein synthesis and especially to  elongation factor complex components, including EF1A2, EF1B, EF1D, EF1G, and  valyl-tRNA synthetase (VARS), in NF1-deficient malignant tumor cells.  Interestingly, TCTP preferentially binds to EF1A2 (normally found only in neural  and skeletal-muscle cells and several cancer cells), rather than EF1A1 despite  the high homologies (98%) in their sequences. The docking simulation and further  validations to study the interaction between TCTP and EF1A2 revealed that TCTP  directly binds with EF1A2 via the contact areas of EF1A2 dimerization. Using  unique and common sequences between EF1A2 and EF1A1 in AP-DIA/SWATH, we  quantitatively validated the interaction of EF1A2 and TCTP/other elongation  factors and found that TCTP coordinates the translational machinery of  elongation factors via the association with EF1A2. These data suggest that TCTP  activates EF1A2-dependent translation by mediating complex formation with other  elongation factors. Inhibiting the TCTP-EF1A2 interaction with EF1A2 siRNAs or a  TCTP inhibitor, artesunate, significantly down-regulated the factors related to  protein translation and caused dramatic suppression of growth/translation in  NF1-associated tumors. Our findings demonstrate that a specific protein  translation machinery related to the TCTP-EF1A2 interaction is functionally  implicated in the tumorigenesis and progression of NF1-associated tumors and  could represent a therapeutic target.  © 2019 Kobayashi et al.

Normal Schwann cells (SCs) are quiescent in adult nerves, when ATP is released  from the nerve in an activity dependent manner. We find that suppressing nerve  activity in adult nerves causes SC to enter the cell cycle. In vitro, ATP  activates the SC G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) P2Y2. Downstream of P2Y2,  β-arrestin-mediated signaling results in PP2-mediated de-phosphorylation of AKT,  and PP2 activity is required for SC growth suppression. NF1 deficient SC show  reduced growth suppression by ATP, and are resistant to the effects of  β-arrestin-mediated signaling, including PP2-mediated de-phosphorylation of AKT.  In patients with the disorder Neurofibromatosis type 1, NF1 mutant SCs  proliferate and form SC tumors called neurofibromas. Elevating ATP levels in  vivo reduced neurofibroma cell proliferation. Thus, the low proliferation  characteristic of differentiated adult peripheral nerve may require ongoing,  nerve activity-dependent, ATP. Additionally, we identify a mechanism through  which NF1 SCs may evade growth suppression in nerve tumors.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are the leading cause of death  in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients. Current treatment modalities have  been largely unsuccessful in improving MPNST patient survival, making the  identification of new therapeutic targets urgent. In this study, we found that  interference with Usp9X, a deubiquitinating enzyme which is overexpressed in  nervous system tumors, or Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family  whose degradation is regulated by Usp9X, causes rapid death in human MPNST cell  lines. Although both Usp9X and Mcl-1 knockdown elicited some features of  apoptosis, broad spectrum caspase inhibition was ineffective in preventing  knockdown-induced MPNST cell death suggesting that caspase-independent death  pathways were also activated. Ultrastructural examination of MPNST cells  following either Usp9X interference or pharmacological inhibition showed  extensive cytoplasmic vacuolization and swelling of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)  and mitochondria most consistent with paraptotic cell death. Finally, the Usp9X  pharmacological inhibitor WP1130 significantly reduced human MPNST growth and  induced tumor cell death in an in vivo xenograft model. In total, these findings  indicate that Usp9X and Mcl-1 play significant roles in maintaining human MPNST  cell viability and that pharmacological inhibition of Usp9X deubiquitinase  activity could be a therapeutic target for MPNST treatment.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal genetic disorder. Patients with  NF1 are associated with mono-allelic loss of the tumor suppressor gene NF1 in  their germline, which predisposes them to develop a wide array of benign  lesions. Intriguingly, recent sequencing efforts revealed that the NF1 gene is  frequently mutated in multiple malignant tumors not typically associated with  NF1 patients, suggesting that NF1 heterozygosity is refractory to at least some  cancer types. In two orthogonal mouse models representing NF1- and  non-NF1-related tumors, we discover that an Nf1+/- microenvironment accelerates  the formation of benign tumors but impairs further progression to malignancy.  Analysis of benign and malignant tumors commonly associated with NF1 patients,  as well as those with high NF1 gene mutation frequency, reveals an antagonistic  role for NF1 heterozygosity in tumor initiation and malignant transformation and  helps to reconciliate the role of the NF1 gene in both NF1 and non-NF1 patient  contexts.

Nancy.Ratner@cchmc.org.  Plexiform neurofibroma, a benign peripheral nerve tumor, is associated with the  biallelic loss of function of the NF1 tumor suppressor in Schwann cells. Here,  we show that FLLL32, a small molecule inhibitor of JAK2/STAT3 signaling, reduces  neurofibroma growth in mice with conditional, biallelic deletion of Nf1 in the  Schwann cell lineage. FLLL32 treatment or Stat3 deletion in tumor cells reduced  inflammatory cytokine expression and tumor macrophage numbers in neurofibroma.  Although STAT3 inhibition downregulated the chemokines CCL2 and CCL12, which can  signal through CCR2 to recruit macrophages to peripheral nerves, deletion of  Ccr2 did not improve survival or reduce macrophage numbers in  neurofibroma-bearing mice. Interestingly, Iba1+; F4/80+;CD11b+ macrophages  accounted for ~20-40% of proliferating cells in untreated tumors. FLLL32  suppressed macrophage proliferation, implicating STAT3-dependent, local  proliferation in neurofibroma macrophage accumulation, and decreased Schwann  cell proliferation and increased Schwann cell death. The functions of STAT3  signaling in neurofibroma Schwann cells and macrophages, and its relevance as a  therapeutic target in neurofibroma, merit further investigation.

The fertility of men with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is reduced. Despite this  observation, gonadal function has not been examined in patients with NF1. In  order to assess the role of reduced neurofibromin in the testes, we examined  testicular morphology and function in an Nf1+/- mouse model. We found that  although Nf1+/- male mice are able to reproduce, they have significantly fewer  pups per litter than Nf1+/+ control males. Reduced fertility in Nf1+/- male mice  is associated with disorganization of the seminiferous epithelium, with  exfoliation of germ cells and immature spermatids into the tubule lumen.  Morphometric analysis shows that these alterations are associated with decreased  Leydig cell numbers and increased spermatid cell numbers. We hypothesized that  hyper-activation of Ras in Nf1+/- males affects ectoplasmic specialization, a  Sertoli-spermatid adherens junction involved in spermiation. Consistent with  this idea, we found increased expression of phosphorylated ERK, a downstream  effector of Ras that has been shown to alter ectoplasmic specialization, in  Nf1+/- males in comparison to control Nf1+/+ littermates. These data demonstrate  that neurofibromin haploinsufficiency impairs spermatogenesis and fertility in a  mouse model of NF1.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a genetic tumor-predisposition  disorder caused by NF2/merlin tumor suppressor gene inactivation. The hallmark  of NF2 is formation of bilateral vestibular schwannomas (VS). Because merlin  modulates activity of the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase  (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, we investigated  repurposing drugs targeting MEK1 and/or MEK2 as a treatment for NF2-associated  schwannomas. METHODS: Mouse and human merlin-deficient Schwann cell lines (MD-MSC/HSC) were  screened against 6 MEK1/2 inhibitors. Efficacious drugs were tested in  orthotopic allograft and NF2 transgenic mouse models. Pathway and proteome  analyses were conducted. Drug efficacy was examined in primary human VS cells  with NF2 mutations and correlated with DNA methylation patterns. RESULTS: Trametinib, PD0325901, and cobimetinib were most effective in reducing  MD-MSC/HSC viability. Each decreased phosphorylated pERK1/2 and cyclin D1,  increased p27, and induced caspase-3 cleavage in MD-MSCs. Proteomic analysis  confirmed cell cycle arrest and activation of pro-apoptotic pathways in  trametinib-treated MD-MSCs. The 3 inhibitors slowed allograft growth; however,  decreased pERK1/2, cyclin D1, and Ki-67 levels were observed only in PD0325901  and cobimetinib-treated grafts. Tumor burden and average tumor size were reduced  in trametinib-treated NF2 transgenic mice; however, tumors did not exhibit  reduced pERK1/2 levels. Trametinib and PD0325901 modestly reduced viability of  several primary human VS cell cultures with NF2 mutations. DNA methylation  analysis of PD0325901-resistant versus -susceptible VS identified genes that  could contribute to drug resistance. CONCLUSION: MEK inhibitors exhibited differences in antitumor efficacy  resistance in schwannoma models with possible emergence of trametinib  resistance. The results support further investigation of MEK inhibitors in  combination with other targeted drugs for NF2 schwannomas.  © The Author(s) 2019.

Neurofibromatosis type II (NF2) is a disease that lacks effective therapies. NF2  is characterized by bilateral vestibular schwannomas (VSs) that cause  progressive and debilitating hearing loss, leading to social isolation and  increased rates of depression. A major limitation in NF2 basic and translational  research is the lack of animal models that allow the full spectrum of research  into the biology and molecular mechanisms of NF2 tumor progression, as well as  the effects on neurological function. In this protocol, we describe how to  inject schwannoma cells into the mouse brain cerebellopontine angle (CPA)  region. We also describe how to apply state-of-the-art intravital imaging and  hearing assessment techniques to study tumor growth and hearing loss. In  addition, ataxia, angiogenesis, and tumor-stroma interaction assays can be  applied, and the model can be used to test the efficacy of novel therapeutic  approaches. By studying the disease from every angle, this model offers the  potential to unravel the basic biological underpinnings of NF2 and to develop  novel therapeutics to control this devastating disease. Our protocol can be  adapted to study other diseases within the CPA, including meningiomas, lipomas,  vascular malformations, hemangiomas, epidermoid cysts, cerebellar astrocytomas,  and metastatic lesions. The entire surgical procedure takes ~45 min per mouse  and allows for subsequent longitudinal imaging, as well as neurological and  hearing assessment, for up to 2 months.

In addition to physical manifestations such as  characteristic pigmentary changes, nerve sheath tumors, and skeletal  abnormalities, NF1 is also associated with increased rates of learning  disabilities, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum  disorder. While there are established NF1-related structural brain anomalies,  including brain overgrowth and white matter disruptions, little is known  regarding patterns of functional connectivity in NF1. Here, we sought to  investigate functional network connectivity (FNC) in a well-characterized sample  of NF1 participants (n = 30) vs. age- and sex-matched healthy controls (n = 30).  We conducted a comprehensive investigation of both static as well as dynamic FNC  and meta-state analysis, a novel approach to examine higher-dimensional temporal  dynamism of whole-brain connectivity. We found that static FNC of the cognitive  control domain is altered in NF1 participants. Specifically, connectivity  between anterior cognitive control areas and the cerebellum is decreased,  whereas connectivity within the cognitive control domain is increased in NF1  participants relative to healthy controls. These alterations are independent of  IQ. Dynamic FNC analysis revealed that NF1 participants spent more time in a  state characterized by whole-brain hypoconnectivity relative to healthy  controls. However, connectivity strength of dynamic states did not differ  between NF1 participants and healthy controls. NF1 participants exhibited also  reduced higher-dimensional dynamism of whole-brain connectivity, suggesting that  temporal fluctuations of FNC are reduced. Given that similar findings have been  observed in individuals with schizophrenia, higher occurrence of hypoconnected  dynamic states and reduced temporal dynamism may be more general indicators of  global brain dysfunction and not specific to either disorder.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a tumor predisposition genetic disease caused  by mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene. Plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs)  are benign Schwann cell (SC) tumors of the peripheral nerve sheath that develop  through NF1 inactivation and can progress toward a malignant soft tissue  sarcoma. There is a lack of non-perishable model systems to investigate PNF  development. We reprogrammed PNF-derived NF1(-/-) cells, descendants from the  tumor originating cell. These NF1(-/-)-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)  captured the genomic status of PNFs and were able to differentiate toward neural  crest stem cells and further to SCs. iPSC-derived NF1(-/-) SCs exhibited a  continuous high proliferation rate, poor myelination ability, and a tendency to  form 3D spheres that expressed the same markers as their PNF-derived primary SC  counterparts. They represent a valuable model to study and treat PNFs.  PNF-derived iPSC lines were banked for making them available.  Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

NF1 patients have an 8-16% lifetime risk of  developing a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), a highly  aggressive soft-tissue sarcoma, often arising from preexisting benign plexiform  neurofibromas (PNs) and atypical neurofibromas (ANFs). ANFs are distinct from  both PN and MPNST, representing an intermediate step in malignant  transformation. METHODS: In the first comprehensive genomic analysis of ANF originating from  multiple patients, we performed tumor/normal whole-exome sequencing (WES) of 16  ANFs. In addition, we conducted WES of 3 MPNSTs, copy-number meta-analysis of 26  ANFs and 28 MPNSTs, and whole transcriptome sequencing analysis of 5 ANFs and 5  MPNSTs. RESULTS: We identified a low number of mutations (median 1, range 0-5) in the  exomes of ANFs (only NF1 somatic mutations were recurrent), and frequent  deletions of CDKN2A/B (69%) and SMARCA2 (42%). We determined that polycomb  repressor complex 2 (PRC2) genes EED and SUZ12 were frequently mutated, deleted,  or downregulated in MPNSTs but not in ANFs. Our pilot gene expression study  revealed upregulated NRAS, MDM2, CCND1/2/3, and CDK4/6 in ANFs and MPNSTs, and  overexpression of EZH2 in MPNSTs only. CONCLUSIONS: The PN-ANF transition is primarily driven by the deletion of  CDKN2A/B. Further progression from ANF to MPNST likely involves broad  chromosomal rearrangements and frequent inactivation of the PRC2 genes, loss of  the DNA repair genes, and copy-number increase of signal transduction and  cell-cycle and pluripotency self-renewal genes.

Plexiform neurofibroma is a major contributor to morbidity in patients with  neurofibromatosis type I (NF1). Macrophages and mast cells infiltrate  neurofibroma, and data from mouse models implicate these leukocytes in  neurofibroma development. Antiinflammatory therapy targeting these cell  populations has been suggested as a means to prevent neurofibroma development.  Here, we compare gene expression in Nf1-mutant nerves, which invariably form  neurofibroma, and show disruption of neuron-glial cell interactions and immune  cell infiltration to mouse models, which rarely progresses to neurofibroma with  or without disruption of neuron-glial cell interactions. We find that the  chemokine Cxcl10 is uniquely upregulated in NF1 mice that invariably develop  neurofibroma. Global deletion of the CXCL10 receptor Cxcr3 prevented  neurofibroma development in these neurofibroma-prone mice, and an anti-Cxcr3  antibody somewhat reduced tumor numbers. Cxcr3 expression localized to T cells  and DCs in both inflamed nerves and neurofibromas, and Cxcr3 expression was  necessary to sustain elevated macrophage numbers in Nf1-mutant nerves. To our  knowledge, these data support a heretofore-unappreciated role for T cells and  DCs in neurofibroma initiation.

Surveys were administered to 49  participants (28 children and 21 adults), ages 8 through 40 years. The survey  included the Numeric Rating Scale 11 (NRS11) to assess pain intensity and the  Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) to assess pain  interference. A supplemental survey was created to measure pain frequency,  chronicity, quality, and location. Results suggest pain is not only present in  55% of the cohort, but that it can begin at early ages. Pain was chronic in 35%  of participants, with 41% reporting the use of medication to manage pain  symptoms. Common sources of pain included migraine headaches and NF-related  tumors. Pain was described as having neuropathic features (i.e., burning,  tingling, numbness, or itching), and was localized to the head, back, and  extremities. Further, subsets of participants reported moderate-to-severe pain  intensity, high frequency of pain, and interference of pain in daily activities.  Continued investigation of the pain experience in a multisystem disorder, such  as NF1, remains essential to providing guidance in the setting of complex pain  management.  © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Neuroblastoma is a malignancy arising from the developing sympathetic nervous  system and the most common and deadly cancer of infancy. New therapies are  needed to improve the prognosis for high-risk patients and to reduce toxicity  and late effects. Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) has previously been identified as  a promising drug target in various inflammatory diseases and cancers but has so  far not been extensively studied as a potential therapeutic target in  neuroblastoma. In this study, we observed elevated SYK gene expression in  neuroblastoma compared to neural crest and benign neurofibroma. While SYK  protein was detected in the majority of examined neuroblastoma tissues it was  less frequently observed in neuroblastoma cell lines. Depletion of SYK by siRNA  and the use of small molecule SYK inhibitors significantly reduced the cell  viability of neuroblastoma cell lines expressing SYK protein. Moreover, SYK  inhibition decreased ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation. The SYK inhibitor BAY  613606 enhanced the effect of different chemotherapeutic drugs. Transient  expression of a constitutive active SYK variant increased the viability of  neuroblastoma cells independent of endogenous SYK levels. Collectively, our  findings suggest that targeting SYK in combination with conventional  chemotherapy should be further evaluated as a treatment option in neuroblastoma.

(#)Contributed equally  PURPOSE: BET bromodomain inhibitors have emerged as a promising therapy for  numerous cancer types in preclinical studies, including neurofibromatosis type 1  (NF1)-associated malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). However,  potential mechanisms underlying resistance to these inhibitors in different  cancers are not completely understood. In this study, we explore new strategy to  overcome BET inhibitor resistance in MPNST.Experimental Design: Through modeling  tumor evolution by studying genetic changes underlying the development of MPNST,  a lethal sarcoma with no effective medical treatment, we identified a targetable  addiction to BET bromodomain family member BRD4 in MPNST. This served as a  controlled model system to delineate mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to  BET bromodomain inhibitors in this disease. RESULTS: Here, we show that a malignant progression-associated increase in BRD4  protein levels corresponds to partial sensitivity to BET inhibition in MPNST.  Strikingly, genetic depletion of BRD4 protein levels synergistically sensitized  MPNST cells to diverse BET inhibitors in culture and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, MPNST sensitivity to combination genetic and  pharmacologic inhibition of BRD4 revealed the presence of a unique addiction to  BRD4 in MPNST. Our discovery that a synthetic lethality exists between BET  inhibition and reduced BRD4 protein levels nominates MPNST for the investigation  of emerging therapeutic interventions such as proteolysis-targeting chimeras  (PROTACs) that simultaneously target bromodomain activity and BET protein  abundance.  ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the impact of plexiform neurofibromas on the lives of  adults with neurofibromatosis type 1. BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a complex neurogenetic syndrome that  affects many aspects of health and functioning. A common manifestation of  neurofibromatosis type 1 is plexiform neurofibromas, non-cancerous tumours that  can cause disfigurement, pain and neurologic disability. Patient-reported  outcome measures used in this condition have addressed symptoms and functional  ability but not how the condition affects patients' lives, particularly, their  ability to meet their human needs. METHODS: Unstructured qualitative interviews were conducted with adults with  neurofibromatosis type 1-associated plexiform neurofibromas in the United  Kingdom and United States. Interviewees were encouraged to describe how  plexiform neurofibromas affected their ability to meet their needs. Interviews  were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. The UK and US transcripts were  combined and theoretical thematic analysis was conducted. RESULTS: In all, 42 interviews (United Kingdom = 20, United States = 22) were  conducted. Transcripts revealed 696 statements on the impact of plexiform  neurofibromas on need fulfilment. Five major themes emerged: appearance,  relationships, independence, role fulfilment and pleasure. CONCLUSION: Neurofibromatosis type 1-associated plexiform neurofibromas have a  major effect on individuals' ability to meet their needs. An understanding of  need fulfilment will complement information generated from traditional  patient-reported outcome measures, particularly in a multi-faceted syndrome such  as neurofibromatosis type 1.

Most research on psychosocial consequences of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) has  focused on the relationship between disease factors and cognitive functioning.  NF1 may impair domains of learning and attention, resulting in low academic  performance. This study is the first nationwide population-based cohort study to  investigate educational attainment and delay in completing mandatory school by  persons with NF1. Educational information was collected from 550 persons at the  age of 30 (born 1965-1984). They were diagnosed with NF1 in Denmark and compared  to a cohort of NF1-free persons matched on gender and age (n = 4295).  Multinomial logistic models were applied to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for  obtaining short (≤9 years) or medium (10-12 years) education compared to long  education (>12 years) by the age of 30 years. We calculated the probability of  graduating 9th year of mandatory school at different ages in 932 persons with  NF1 and 7962 NF1-free persons (born 1965-2000) using quantile regression. The OR  of educational completion for short- and medium-term education was three fold  (95% CI 2.55-3.99) and 1.29 fold (95% CI 0.99-1.69) higher, respectively, for  persons with NF1 than NF1-free persons after adjusting for birth year, gender,  psychiatric and somatic morbidity and mother's education. Persons with NF1 were  significantly delayed in graduating mandatory school education compared to  NF1-free persons. When 90% of persons have graduated, persons with NF1 were 1.2  times older than the NF1-free persons. Experiencing delays in mandatory school  likely affect further educational achievements and may impair employment and  entering work force.

The primary cilium is a microtubule-based sensory organelle. The molecular  mechanism that regulates ciliary dynamics remains elusive. Here, we report an  unexpected finding that MLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of NEDD8-activating  enzyme (NAE), blocks primary ciliary formation by inhibiting synthesis/assembly  and promoting disassembly. This is mainly mediated by MLN4924-induced  phosphorylation of AKT1 at Ser473 under serum-starved, ciliary-promoting  conditions. Indeed, pharmaceutical inhibition (by MK2206) or genetic depletion  (via siRNA) of AKT1 rescues MLN4924 effect, indicating its causal role.  Interestingly, pAKT1-Ser473 activity regulates both ciliary synthesis/assembly  and disassembly in a MLN4924 dependent manner, whereas pAKT-Thr308 determines  the ciliary length in MLN4924-independent but VHL-dependent manner. Finally,  MLN4924 inhibits mouse hair regrowth, a process requires ciliogenesis.  Collectively, our study demonstrates an unexpected role of a neddylation  inhibitor in regulation of ciliogenesis via AKT1, and provides a  proof-of-concept for potential utility of MLN4924 in the treatment of human  diseases associated with abnormal ciliogenesis.

PMID:30859021,Neurofibromatosis Type 1: Review of Cutaneous and Subcutaneous Tumor Treatment on Quality of Life.,"Neurofibromatosis Type 1: Review of Cutaneous and Subcutaneous Tumor Treatment  on Quality of Life.  Taylor LA(1), Lewis VL Jr(2).  Author information: (1)Belleville, Ill. (2)Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Ill.  BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is the most common type of  neurogenetic disorder with a worldwide incidence of between 1 in 2,600 and 1 in  3,000. NF1 has a wide range of manifestations; as a result, NF1 has no ""public  persona."" Beginning at puberty and continuing thereafter patients may grow  cutaneous and subcutaneous tumors (neurofibromas) in large numbers, which cause  severe problems with appearance, which are similar in severity to those of  psoriasis. Appearance concerns due to tumors affect NF1 patients' Quality of  Life (QoL). NF1 patients are at increased risk for depression and treatment for  depression and significantly enhance QoL. Improving appearance and QoL by  decreasing the number of tumors is the NF1 patient's greatest concern. Improving  QoL is an end in itself. METHODS: There are no currently available medical or pharmacological treatments  for cutaneous and subcutaneous tumors of NF1. Surgery is the only treatment  option for cutaneous and subcutaneous tumors. High Quantity (HQ) surgical  removal by several methods has been used. RESULTS: HQ electrosurgical (ES) allows removal of large numbers of tumors,  hundreds per surgical session, appears to be highly effective, and most patients  are happy with their results. Other surgical techniques, such as scalpellic  surgery, are not effective. Inadequate insurance payments, few plastic surgeons  performing HQ tumor removal, lack of support from nonsurgeon physicians, few if  any NF clinics providing HQ tumor removal, pediatric orientation, focus on basic  research, and a dismissive attitude toward NF1 patients are all components in  the unavailability of HQ NF tumor removal. Such surgery is not cosmetic but  restoration of normal appearance from disfigurement due to a congenital,  neoplastic disease. CONCLUSIONS: National legislation is required to mandate insurance companies to  provide coverage for HQ tumor removal. Payments by health insurance companies to  plastic surgeons must be reasonable and comparable with other procedures. Effort  by neurologists and other nonsurgeons is needed to gain support of plastic  surgeons. Strong pressure is needed by support groups of NF for providing NF1 HQ  surgery at institutions with NF clinics and for proper payments for surgeons and  others.

Genetic mutations affecting chromatin modifiers are widespread in cancers. In  malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), Polycomb repressive complex 2  (PRC2), which plays a crucial role in gene silencing, is inactivated through  recurrent mutations in core subunits embryonic ectoderm development (EED) and  suppressor of zeste 12 homolog (SUZ12), but mutations in PRC2's main catalytic  subunit enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) have never been found. This is in  contrast to myeloid and lymphoid malignancies, which harbor frequent  loss-of-function mutations in EZH2. Here, we investigated whether the absence of  EZH2 mutations in MPNST is due to a PRC2-independent (i.e., noncanonical)  function of the enzyme or to redundancy with EZH1. We show that, in the absence  of SUZ12, EZH2 remains bound to EED but loses its interaction with all other  core and accessory PRC2 subunits. Through genetic and pharmacological analyses,  we unambiguously establish that EZH2 is functionally inert in this context,  thereby excluding a PRC2-independent function. Instead, we show that EZH1 and  EZH2 are functionally redundant in the slowly proliferating MPNST precursors. We  provide evidence that the compensatory function of EZH1 is alleviated upon  higher proliferation. This work reveals how context-dependent redundancies can  shape tumor-type specific mutation patterns in chromatin regulators.

Collapsin response mediator proteins (CRMPs) are a family of ubiquitously  expressed, homologous phosphoproteins best known for coordinating cytoskeletal  formation and regulating cellular division, migration, polarity, and synaptic  connection. CRMP2, the most studied of the five family members, is best known  for its affinity for tubulin heterodimers and function in regulating the  microtubule network. These functions are tightly regulated by post-translational  modifications including phosphorylation, SUMOylation, oxidation, and  O-GlcNAcylation. While CRMP2's physiological functions rely mostly on its  non-phosphorylated state, dysregulation of CRMP2 phosphorylation and SUMOylation  has been reported to be involved in the pathophysiology of multiple diseases  including cancer, chronic pain, spinal cord injury, neurofibromatosis type 1,  and others. Here, we provide a consolidated update on what is known about CRMP2  signaling and function, first focusing on axonal growth and neuronal polarity,  then illustrating the link between dysregulated CRMP2 post-translational  modifications and diseases. We additionally discuss the roles of CRMP2 in  non-neuronal cells, both in the CNS and regions of the periphery. Finally, we  offer thoughts on the therapeutic implications of modulating CRMP2 function in a  variety of diseases.

Author information: (1)Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London,  London, United Kingdom.  The cells of the neural crest, often referred to as neural crest stem cells,  give rise to a number of sub-lineages, one of which is Schwann cells, the glial  cells of peripheral nerves. Crest cells transform to adult Schwann cells through  the generation of two well defined intermediate stages, the Schwann cell  precursors (SCP) in early embryonic nerves, and immature Schwann cells (iSch) in  late embryonic and perinatal nerves. SCP are formed when neural crest cells  enter nascent nerves and form intimate relationships with axons, a diagnostic  feature of glial cells. This involves large-scale changes in gene expression,  including the activation of established glial cell markers. Like early glia in  the CNS, radial glia, SCP retain developmental multipotency and contribute to  other crest-derived lineages during embryonic development. SCP, as well as  closely related cells termed boundary cap cells, and later stages of the Schwann  cell lineage have all been implicated as the tumor initiating cell in NF1  associated neurofibromas. iSch are formed from SCP in a process that involves  the appearance of additional differentiation markers, autocrine survival  circuits, cellular elongation, a formation of endoneurial connective tissue and  basal lamina. Finally, in peri- and post-natal nerves, iSch are reversibly  induced by axon-associated signals to form the myelin and non-myelin Schwann  cells of adult nerves. This review article discusses early Schwann cell  development in detail and describes a large number of molecular signaling  systems that control glial development in embryonic nerves.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disease involving neurocutaneous  abnormalities. Neurofibromatosis type 1 is an autosomal dominant disorder  characterized by the neurofibromas and café-au-lait spots. Mutation in the NF 1  gene causes NF1. The NF 1 gene encodes neurofibromin. In this study, we found a  31-year-old Chinese boy with NF1. He presented only with café-au-lait spots over  the whole body. The proband's mother had a severe phenotype with neurofibroma  and café-au-lait macules over her whole body, mostly in the facial region. A  novel multi exon deletion c.(4661+1_4662-1)_(5748+1_5749-1)del; [EX36_39DEL] on  the NF 1 gene has been identified in the proband. Quantitative real-time  polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) confirmed that this mutation is co-segregated  well and was inherited from the proband's mother. The mutation was absent in the  proband's father and normal individuals. The novel multi exon deletion results  in the formation of a truncated NF1 protein that caused the NF1 phenotype in  this family. Our present study also emphasized the significance of rapid,  accurate and cost-effective screening for the patient with NF1 by next  generation sequencing (NGS).

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the most common of a group of rare diseases  known by the term, ""Neurofibromatosis,"" affecting 1 in 3000 to 4000 people. NF1  patients present with, among other disease complications, café au lait patches,  skin fold freckling, Lisch nodules, orthopedic complications, cutaneous  neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, cognitive impairment,  and chronic pain. Although NF1 patients inevitably express pain as a  debilitating symptom of the disease, not much is known about its manifestation  in the NF1 disease, with most current information coming from sporadic case  reports. Although these reports indicate the existence of pain, the molecular  signaling underlying this symptom remains underexplored, and thus, we include a  synopsis of the literature surrounding NF1 pain studies in 3 animal models:  mouse, rat, and miniswine. We also highlight unexplored areas of NF1 pain  research. As therapy for NF1 pain remains in various clinical and preclinical  stages, we present current treatments available for patients and highlight the  importance of future therapeutic development. Equally important, NF1 pain is  accompanied by psychological complications in comorbidities with sleep,  gastrointestinal complications, and overall quality of life, lending to the  importance of investigation into this understudied phenomenon of NF1. In this  review, we dissect the presence of pain in NF1 in terms of psychological  implication, anatomical presence, and discuss mechanisms underlying the onset  and potentiation of NF1 pain to evaluate current therapies and propose  implications for treatment of this severely understudied, but prevalent symptom  of this rare disease.

Neurofibromatosis type 2 is an inherited, neoplastic disease associated with  schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas and that is caused by inactivation of  the tumor suppressor gene NF2 The NF2 gene product, Merlin, has no intrinsic  catalytic activity; its tumor suppressor function is mediated through the  proteins with which it interacts. We used proximity biotinylation followed by  mass spectrometry and direct binding assays to identify proteins that associated  with wild-type and various mutant forms of Merlin in immortalized Schwann cells.  We defined a set of 52 proteins in close proximity to wild-type Merlin. Most of  the Merlin-proximal proteins were components of cell junctional signaling  complexes, suggesting that additional potential interaction partners may exist  in adherens junctions, tight junctions, and focal adhesions. With mutant forms  of Merlin that cannot bind to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) or  that constitutively adopt a closed conformation, we confirmed a critical role  for PIP2 binding in Merlin function and identified a large cohort of proteins  that specifically interacted with Merlin in the closed conformation. Among these  proteins, we identified a previously unreported Merlin-binding protein,  apoptosis-stimulated p53 protein 2 (ASPP2, also called Tp53bp2), that bound to  closed-conformation Merlin predominately through the FERM domain. Our results  demonstrate that Merlin is a component of cell junctional mechanosensing  complexes and defines a specific set of proteins through which it acts.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are aggressive sarcomas  typically developing in the context of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1). With the  exception of surgical resection, these tumors are resistant to all current  therapies, and unresectable, recurrent, or metastatic tumors are considered  incurable. Preclinical studies have identified several novel candidate molecular  targets for therapeutic intervention, but, to date, targeted therapies have  proven ineffective. Recent studies have identified recurrent mutations in  polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) core components, embryonic ectoderm  development protein (EED) and suppressor of zeste 12 homolog (SUZ12), in MPNST.  These mutations result in global loss of the histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation  epigenetic mark, normally deposited by PRC2, and subsequent gain in acetylation  at this residue. This altered chromatin state has been shown to promote MPNST  malignancy; however, acetylation at this residue sensitizes MPNSTs to BRD4 and  bromodomain and extra-terminal domain inhibition. Interestingly, the catalytic  component of PRC2, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), is not mutated in MPNST,  hinting that a noncanonical, PRC2-independent function of EZH2 may play a role  in this cancer. This review examines the pathobiology of MPNST, the contribution  of PRC2 subunits to this process, and the prospects for PRC2-related therapies  for this cancer. IMPLICATIONS: Identification of mutations in the PRC2  components EED and SUZ12 in the majority of MPNSTs may imply noncanonical  oncogenic activities of the intact component, EZH2, and provide new  opportunities for therapeutic intervention.  ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.

PMID:3102622,A computed image analyzing system for quantitation of melanocyte morphology in café-au-lait macules of neurofibromatosis.,"A computed image analyzing system for quantitation of melanocyte morphology in  café-au-lait macules of neurofibromatosis.  Ishida O, Jimbow K.  Split-dopa preparation is a commonly used technique to visualize the epidermal  melanocytes. It can characterize the number of melanocytes and their tyrosinase  (dopa-oxidase) activities. There is not, however, any method to quantitate the  morphologic changes of dopa-positive melanocytes in the split preparation. This  study designed a computed image analyzing system and evaluated the structure of  epidermal melanocytes in café-au-lait macules with comparison to normally  pigmented skin in 5 patients with neurofibromatosis. By this method we were able  to delineate the melanocyte structure with melanocyte population and coloration  of the macules. We found that the population and structure of melanocytes differ  greatly depending on the coloration of the café-au-lait macules. The light brown  and brown macules showed the normal population of melanocytes with an increase  in the area and perimeter of whole cell; the area, perimeter, and diameter of  cytoplasm; and the area, length, and breadth of dendrites. In contrast, the dark  brown macules revealed a significant increase of the epidermal melanocytes with  a decrease in all of these parameters. Thus, the methodologic design presented  here may enable a quantitative, two-dimensional analysis of melanocyte structure  at the light microscopic level in the normal skin and in various pigmentary  disorders.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether [F]fluorothymidine (FLT) and/or  [F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) can differentiate  growth in neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) related vestibular schwannomas (VS) and to  evaluate the importance of PET scanner spatial resolution on measured tumor  uptake. METHODS: Six NF2 patients with 11 VS (4 rapidly growing, 7 indolent), were  scanned with FLT and FDG using a high-resolution research tomograph (HRRT,  Siemens) and a Siemens Biograph TrueV PET-CT, with and without resolution  modeling image reconstruction. Mean, maximum, and peak standardised uptake  values (SUV) for each tumor were derived and the intertumor correlation between  FDG and FLT uptake was compared. The ability of FDG and FLT SUV values to  discriminate between rapidly growing and slow growing (indolent) tumors was  assessed using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: Tumor uptake was seen with both tracers, using both scanners, with and  without resolution modeling. FDG and FLT uptake was correlated (R = 0.67-0.86,  p < 0.01) and rapidly growing tumors displayed significantly higher uptake  (SUVmean and SUVpeak) of both tracers (p < 0.05, one tailed t test). All of the  PET analyses performed demonstrated better discriminatory power (AUCROC  range = 0.71-0.86) than tumor size alone (AUCROC = 0.61). The use of standard  resolution scanner with standard reconstruction did not result in a notable  deterioration of discrimination accuracy. CONCLUSION: NF2 related VS demonstrate uptake of both FLT and FDG, which is  significantly increased in rapidly growing tumors. A short static FDG PET scan  with standard clinical resolution and reconstruction can provide relevant  information on tumor growth to aid clinical decision making.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a common genetic neurocutaneous  disease, with an autosomal dominant inheritance mode. Quality of life has been  shown impaired in NF1, due to severe complications, cosmetic features, and  uncertainty about the disorder. METHODS: This study sought to develop a self-administered questionnaire in  French to assess the burden of NF1 (BoN), then translate and linguistically and  cross-culturally validate it into American English, standardized methodology  applied, as outlined in the report. RESULTS: Based on several discussions with NF1 patients, a 17-item conceptual  questionnaire was first produced. Of the 91 NF1 adult patients who responded to  the conceptual questionnaire, 65 (64.6% females) were accessible. Subsequent  confirmatory analyses generated a 15-item questionnaire grouped into four  domains, demonstrating internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha: 091),  discriminant validity, and high reliability. The BoN was likewise shown to  significantly correlate with other validated questionnaires, such as Dermatology  Life Quality Index, Perceived Stress Scale, and SF12 mental score, indicating  good external validity. CONCLUSIONS: BoN is a specific tool for assessing the burden that NF1 generates  on many practical aspects of the patient daily activities, beyond the notion of  quality of life"". Given the increasing relevance that regulatory authorities  attribute to patient-reported outcomes, the BoN questionnaire provides such  supplementary information while accounting for the burden of NF1 patients in the  broadest sense.

BACKGROUND: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs) are sarcomas of  Schwann cell lineage origin that occur sporadically or in association with the  inherited syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). This study aimed to examine  the function of High mobility group protein A2 (HMGA2) in NF1 MPNST progression  and the underlying molecular mechanism. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect HMGA2 expression in MPNST  and neurofibroma patient samples. Cell Cycle Kit-8 (CCK-8) and  5-ethynyl-20-deoxyuridine (EdU) assays, terminal deoxynucleotidyl  transferase-mediated nick end labelling, and transmission electron microscopy  were performed to reveal HMGA2 functions in NF1 MPNST cells in vitro and in  vivo. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and RNA sequencing  (RNA-Seq) were used to detect HMGA2-modulated genes regulating autophagy and  growth in NF1 MPNSTs in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: NF1 MPNST samples exhibit higher HMGA2 positivity rates (13/16) than  sporadic MPNST (16/41) and neurofibroma (0/7) patient samples. High HMGA2  expression is correlated with poor prognosis. Neurofibromin 1 (NF1)-deficient  MPNST cells display elevated HMGA2 expression. Functional experiments revealed  that HMGA2 knockdown inhibits NF1 MPNST cell growth in vitro and in vivo. In  addition to promoting cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, HMGA2 knockdown inhibits  autophagy, favouring cell death. RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq revealed that HMGA2  directly activates the Musashi-2 (MSI2) promoter region, and MSI2 overexpression  reverses autophagy and growth in shHMGA2-transfected cells. MSI2 interacts with  Beclin1, and Beclin1 blockade inhibits autophagy, thereby inhibiting cell  proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: HMGA2 knockdown regulates autophagy via MSI2-Beclin1 interactions  to inhibit NF1 MPNST growth, revealing potential therapeutic targets for these  untreatable tumours.

Merlin/NF2 is a bona fide tumor suppressor whose mutations underlie inherited  tumor syndrome neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), as well as various sporadic  cancers including kidney cancer. Multiple Merlin/NF2 effector pathways including  the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway have been identified. However, the molecular  mechanisms underpinning the growth and survival of NF2-mutant tumors remain  poorly understood. Using an inducible orthotopic kidney tumor model, we  demonstrate that YAP/TAZ silencing is sufficient to induce regression of  pre-established NF2-deficient tumors. Mechanistically, YAP/TAZ depletion  diminishes glycolysis-dependent growth and increases mitochondrial respiration  and reactive oxygen species (ROS) buildup, resulting in oxidative-stress-induced  cell death when challenged by nutrient stress. Furthermore, we identify  lysosome-mediated cAMP-PKA/EPAC-dependent activation of RAF-MEK-ERK signaling as  a resistance mechanism to YAP/TAZ inhibition. Finally, unbiased analysis of TCGA  primary kidney tumor transcriptomes confirms a positive correlation of a YAP/TAZ  signature with glycolysis and inverse correlations with oxidative  phosphorylation and lysosomal gene expression, supporting the clinical relevance  of our findings.

The objective was to investigate the serial mediating effects of speech  difficulties, patient health communication, and disease-specific worry in the  relationship between neurofibromatosis (NF) symptoms (pain and skin symptoms)  and total generic health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in children,  adolescents, and young adults with NF Type 1 (NF1) from the patient perspective.  The Speech, Communication, Worry, Pain, Skin Itch Bother, and Skin Sensations  Scales from the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) NF1 Module and the  PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales were completed in a multi-site national study by  305 patients ages 5-25 years. A serial multiple mediator model analysis was  conducted to test the hypothesized sequential mediating effects of speech  difficulties, health communication, and worry as intervening variables in the  association between NF1 symptoms and HRQOL. Symptoms predictive effects on total  generic HRQOL were serially mediated by speech difficulties, patient health  communication, and worry. In predictive analytics models utilizing hierarchical  multiple regression analyses with age and gender demographic covariates, the  pain, skin itch bother, and skin sensations multiple mediator models accounted  for 61%, 59%, and 56% of the variance in generic HRQOL (p < .001), reflecting  large effect sizes. Speech difficulties, patient health communication, and  disease-specific worry explain in part the mechanism of symptoms predictive  effects on total generic HRQOL in pediatric patients with NF1. Identifying  NF1-specific predictors and serial mediators of total generic HRQOL in pediatric  patients with NF1 from the patient perspective enables a patient-centered  comprehensive care approach for children, adolescents, and young adults with  NF1.  © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Plexiform neurofibroma (PN) tumors are a hallmark manifestation of  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) that arise in the Schwann cell (SC) lineage. NF1  is a common heritable cancer predisposition syndrome caused by germline  mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor, which encodes a GTPase-activating protein  called neurofibromin that negatively regulates Ras proteins. Whereas most PN are  clinically indolent, a subset progress to atypical neurofibromatous neoplasms of  uncertain biologic potential (ANNUBP) and/or to malignant peripheral nerve  sheath tumors (MPNSTs). In small clinical series, loss of 9p21.3, which includes  the CDKN2A locus, has been associated with the genesis of ANNUBP. Here we show  that the Cdkn2a alternate reading frame (Arf) serves as a gatekeeper tumor  suppressor in mice that prevents PN progression by inducing senescence-mediated  growth arrest in aberrantly proliferating Nf1-/- SC. Conditional ablation of Nf1  and Arf in the neural crest-derived SC lineage allows escape from senescence,  resulting in tumors that accurately phenocopy human ANNUBP and progress to MPNST  with high penetrance. This animal model will serve as a platform to study the  clonal development of ANNUBP and MPNST and to identify new therapies to treat  existing tumors and to prevent disease progression.  © The Author(s) 2019.

Guo X(1), Pan Y(1), Gutmann DH(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis,  Missouri.  Comment in     Neuro Oncol. 2019 Oct 9;21(10):1213-1214. doi: 10.1093/neuonc/noz125.  BACKGROUND: One of the clinical hallmarks of low-grade gliomas (LGGs) arising in  children with the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) cancer predisposition syndrome  is significant clinical variability with respect to tumor growth, associated  neurologic deficits, and response to therapy. Numerous factors could contribute  to this clinical heterogeneity, including the tumor cell of origin, the specific  germline NF1 gene mutation, and the coexistence of additional genomic  alterations. Since human specimens are rarely acquired, and have proven  difficult to maintain in vitro or as xenografts in vivo, we have developed a  series of Nf1 mutant optic glioma mouse strains representing each of these  contributing factors. METHODS: Optic glioma stem cells (o-GSCs) were generated from this collection of  Nf1 genetically engineered mice, and analyzed for their intrinsic growth  properties, as well as the production of chemokines that could differentially  attract T cells and microglia. RESULTS: The observed differences in Nf1 optic glioma growth are not the result  of cell autonomous growth properties of o-GSCs, but rather the unique patterns  of o-GSC chemokine expression, which differentially attract T cells and  microglia. This immune profile collectively dictates the levels of chemokine C-C  ligand 5 (Ccl5) expression, the key stromal factor that drives murine Nf1 optic  glioma growth. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal that genetic and genomic alterations create  murine LGG biological heterogeneity through the differential recruitment of T  cells and microglia by o-GSC-produced chemokines, which ultimately determine the  expression of stromal factors that drive tumor growth.  © The Author(s) 2019.

Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized  by the development of bilateral vestibular schwannomas. The NF2 gene encodes the  tumor suppressor merlin, and loss of merlin activity promotes tumorigenesis and  causes NF2. Cellular redox signaling has been implicated in different stages of  tumor development. Among reactive nitrogen species, peroxynitrite is the most  powerful oxidant produced by cells. We recently showed that  peroxynitrite-mediated tyrosine nitration down-regulates mitochondrial  metabolism in tumor cells. However, whether peroxynitrite supports a metabolic  shift that could be exploited for therapeutic development is unknown. Here, we  show that vestibular schwannomas from NF2 patients and human, merlin-deficient  (MD) Schwann cells have high levels of endogenous tyrosine nitration, indicating  production of peroxynitrite. Furthermore, scavenging or inhibiting peroxynitrite  formation significantly and selectively decreased survival of human and mouse  MD-Schwann cells. Using multiple complementary methods, we also found that  merlin deficiency leads to a reprogramming of energy metabolism characterized by  a peroxynitrite-dependent decrease of oxidative phosphorylation and increased  glycolysis and glutaminolysis. In MD-Schwann cells, scavenging of peroxynitrite  increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption and membrane potential, mediated by  the up-regulation of the levels and activity of mitochondrial complex IV. This  increase in mitochondrial activity correlated with a decrease in the glycolytic  rate and glutamine dependence. This is the first demonstration of a  peroxynitrite-dependent reprogramming of energy metabolism in tumor cells.  Oxidized proteins constitute a novel target for therapeutic development not only  for the treatment of NF2 schwannomas but also other tumors in which  peroxynitrite plays a regulatory role.  © 2019 Pestoni et al.

Author information: (1)Department of Medicine Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina  27710.  Peripheral neurofibromatosis (NF) is one of the most common major genetic  disorders in man. Its chromosomal location is unknown and questions regarding  such factors as genetic heterogeneity remain unanswered. We have ascertained and  sampled several large multi-generation families for linkage studies including  one family of 66 subjects, 28 of whom were affected with NF. Recombinant DNA  studies of several restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) including  C3, ApoC2, pBam34 (D19S6], HAUP[APRT], pE40-1 [D11521], Hp[Hp2 alpha], LDR92,  and LDR111 failed to show a significant linkage (Z [lod score] greater than or  equal to 3.00) in this family. In addition, the results excluded areas of the  genome around the marker loci (Z greater than or equal to - 2.00) as potential  sites for linkage. The maximum Z obtained with the markers was for Hp at theta  (maximum recombination fraction) = 0.20 and Z = 0.399. We are now in the process  of screening additional RFLPs and families for linkage to NF.

BACKGROUND: The neurofibromatoses (NF) are a group of genetic disorders that  interfere negatively with the quality of life (QoL) and influence physical,  emotional and social statuses. Studying the effects of neurofibromatoses on  various aspects of QoL seems important to implement beneficial strategies in  increasing the QoL of NF patients. The aim of this study was to review the  literature on quality of life in patients with NF and quantitatively evaluate  the effects of Neurofibromatosis on various aspects of quality of life by  synthesizing available studies. METHODS: This article is written according to the PRISMA checklist. Different  databases including PubMed, Scopus, Google scholar and Web of Science were  searched to identify studies that examined QoL of patients with  neurofibromatosis. The relevant data obtained from these papers were analyzed by  a random-effects model. The heterogeneity of studies was calculated using the I2  index and Egger test was used to determine publication bias. The information was  analyzed by R and STATA Ver 14. RESULTS: Twelve studies were selected as eligible for this research and were  included in the final analysis. The number of participants in the study was 7314  individuals containing 910 NF patients (642 NF1 and 268 NF2) and 6404 healthy  subjects. The mean scores of sub-scales of QoL were significantly lower in NF  patients compared with control except for the scale of cohesion. Family and NF  patients had lower quality of life in all aspects of QoL than controls. Also,  this meta-analysis shows that NF negatively effects on physical function, bodily  pain, mental health, social function and general health. Subgroup analysis  showed that NF had negative effects on all sub-scales of QoL if the study was  conducted in adults and used a SF-36 questionnaire. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests that NF is a broad spectrum disease,  affecting physical function, bodily pain, mental health, social function and  general health.

Patients with  mutations in NF1 have a strong predisposition for cardiovascular disease, which  contributes to their early mortality. Nf1 heterozygous (Nf1+/-) bone marrow to  wild type chimeras and mice with heterozygous recombination of Nf1 in myeloid  cells recapitulate many of the vascular phenotypes observed in Nf1+/- mutants.  Although these results suggest that macrophages play a central role in NF1  vasculopathy, the underlying mechanisms are currently unknown. In the present  study, we employed macrophages isolated from either Nf1+/- or Lysm Cre+/Nf1f/f  mice to test the hypothesis that loss of Nf1 stimulates macropinocytosis in  macrophages. Scanning electron microscopy and flow cytometry analysis of  FITC-dextran internalization demonstrated that loss of Nf1 in macrophages  stimulates macropinocytosis. We next utilized various cellular and molecular  approaches, pharmacological inhibitors and genetically modified mice to identify  the signaling mechanisms mediating macropinocytosis in Nf1-deficient  macrophages. Our results indicate that loss of Nf1 stimulates PKCδ-mediated  p47phox phosphorylation via RAS activation, leading to increased NADPH oxidase 2  activity, reactive oxygen species generation, membrane ruffling and  macropinocytosis. Interestingly, we also found that Nf1-deficient macrophages  internalize exosomes derived from angiotensin II-treated endothelial cells via  macropinocytosis in vitro and in the peritoneal cavity in vivo. As a result of  exosome internalization, Nf1-deficient macrophages polarized toward an  inflammatory M1 phenotype and secreted increased levels of proinflammatory  cytokines compared to controls. In conclusion, the findings of the present study  demonstrate that loss of Nf1 stimulates paracrine endothelial to myeloid cell  communication via macropinocytosis, leading to proinflammatory changes in  recipient macrophages.

INTRODUCTION: Tinnitus may have a very severe impact on the quality of life.  Unfortunately, for many patients, a satisfactory treatment modality is lacking.  The auditory brainstem implant (ABI) was originally indicated for hearing  restoration in patients with non-functional cochlear nerves, for example, in  neurofibromatosis type II. In analogy to a cochlear implant (CI), it has been  demonstrated that an ABI may reduce tinnitus as a beneficial side effect. For  tinnitus treatment, an ABI may have an advantage over a CI, as cochlear  implantation can harm inner ear structures due to its invasiveness, while an ABI  is presumed to not damage anatomical structures. This is the first study to  implant an ABI to investigate its effect on intractable tinnitus. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this pilot study, 10 adults having incapacitating  unilateral intractable tinnitus and ipsilateral severe hearing loss will have an  ABI implanted. The ABI is switched on 6 weeks after implantation, followed by  several fitting sessions aimed at finding an optimal stimulation strategy. The  primary outcome will be the change in Tinnitus Functioning Index. Secondary  outcomes will be tinnitus burden and quality of life (using Tinnitus Handicap  Inventory and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale questionnaires), tinnitus  characteristics (using Visual Analogue Scale, a tinnitus analysis), safety,  audiometric and vestibular function. The end point is set at 1 year after  implantation. Follow-up will continue until 5 years after implantation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol was reviewed and approved by the  Institutional Review Board of the University Medical Centre Groningen, The  Netherlands (METc 2015/479). The trial is registered at www.clinicialtrials.gov  and will be updated if amendments are made. Results of this study will be  disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and at scientific conferences.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by  loss-of-function mutations in NF1 gene, which encodes a GTPase activating  protein for RAS. NF1 affects multiple systems including brain and is highly  associated with cognitive deficits such as learning difficulties and attention  deficits. Previous studies have suggested that GABAergic inhibitory neuron is  the cell type primarily responsible for the learning deficits in mouse models of  NF1. However, it is not clear how NF1 mutations selectively affect inhibitory  neurons in the central nervous system. In this study, we show that the  expression level of Nf1 is significantly higher in inhibitory neurons than in  excitatory neurons in mouse hippocampus and cortex by using in situ  hybridization. Furthermore, we also found that NF1 is enriched in inhibitory  neurons in the human cortex, confirming that the differential expressions of NF1  between two cell types are evolutionarily conserved. Our results suggest that  the enriched expression of NF1 in inhibitory neurons may underlie inhibitory  neuron-specific deficits in NF1.

BACKGROUND: We have found that erbB receptor tyrosine kinases drive Ras  hyperactivation and growth in NF1-null malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors  (MPNSTs). However, MPNSTs variably express multiple erbB receptors with distinct  functional characteristics and it is not clear which of these receptors drive  MPNST pathogenesis. Here, we test the hypothesis that altered erbB4 expression  promotes MPNST pathogenesis by uniquely activating key cytoplasmic signaling  cascades. METHODS: ErbB4 expression was assessed using immunohistochemistry,  immunocytochemistry, immunoblotting and real-time PCR. To define erbB4  functions, we generated mice that develop MPNSTs with floxed Erbb4 alleles  (P0-GGFβ3;Trp53+/-;Erbb4flox/flox mice) and ablated Erbb4 in these tumors. MPNST  cell proliferation and survival was assessed using 3H-thymidine incorporation,  MTT assays, Real-Time Glo and cell count assays. Control and Erbb4-null MPNST  cells were orthotopically xenografted in immunodeficient mice and the growth,  proliferation (Ki67 labeling), apoptosis (TUNEL labeling) and angiogenesis of  these grafts was analyzed. Antibody arrays querying cytoplasmic kinases were  used to identify erbB4-responsive kinases. Pharmacologic or genetic inhibition  was used to identify erbB4-responsive kinases that drive proliferation. RESULTS: Aberrant erbB4 expression was evident in 25/30 surgically resected  human MPNSTs and in MPNSTs from genetically engineered mouse models (P0-GGFβ3  and P0-GGFβ3;Trp53+/- mice); multiple erbB4 splice variants that differ in their  ability to activate PI3 kinase and nuclear signaling were present in  MPNST-derived cell lines. Erbb4-null MPNST cells demonstrated decreased  proliferation and survival and altered morphology relative to non-ablated  controls. Orthotopic allografts of Erbb4-null cells were significantly smaller  than controls, with reduced proliferation, survival and vascularization. ERBB4  knockdown in human MPNST cells similarly inhibited DNA synthesis and viability.  Although we have previously shown that broad-spectrum erbB inhibitors inhibit  Ras activation, Erbb4 ablation did not affect Ras activation, suggesting that  erbB4 drives neoplasia via non-Ras dependent pathways. An analysis of 43  candidate kinases identified multiple NRG1β-responsive and erbB4-dependent  signaling cascades including the PI3K, WNK1, STAT3, STAT5 and phospholipase-Cγ  pathways. Although WNK1 inhibition did not alter proliferation, inhibition of  STAT3, STAT5 and phospholipase-Cγ markedly reduced proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: ErbB4 promotes MPNST growth by activating key non-Ras dependent  signaling cascades including the STAT3, STAT5 and phospholipase-Cγ pathways.  ErbB4 and its effector pathways are thus potentially useful therapeutic targets  in MPNSTs.

Acetylsalicylic acid has been linked to a lower risk for different cancer types,  presumably through its inhibitory effect on cyclooxygenase 2. This has also been  investigated in vestibular schwannomas with promising results suggesting an  antiproliferative effect and recently the intake has been recommended for  vestibular schwannomas as a conservative treatment option. We constructed tissue  microarrays from paraffin-embedded tissue samples of 1048 vestibular schwannomas  and analyzed the expression of cyclooxygenase 2 and the proliferation marker  MIB1 (Molecular Immunology Borstel) via immunohistochemistry together with  clinical data (age, gender, tumor extension, prior radiotherapy,  neurofibromatosis type 2, tumor recurrence, cyclooxygenase 2 responsive  medication). Univariate analysis showed that cyclooxygenase 2 expression was  increased with age, female gender, prior radiotherapy and larger tumor  extension. MIB1 expression was also associated with higher cyclooxygenase 2  expression. Schwannomas of neurofibromatosis type 2 patients had lower  cyclooxygenase 2 levels. Use of acetylsalicylic acid, non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressants did not  show differences in cyclooxygenase 2 or MIB1 expression. Instead, cyclooxygenase  2 expression increases with tumor extension while MIB1 expression is not  associated with tumor size. Overall, cyclooxygenase 2 expression is associated  with proliferation but not influenced by regular intake of acetylsalicylic acid  or other cyclooxygenase 2-responsive medications. Acetylsalicylic acid intake  does not alter cyclooxygenase 2 expression and has no antiproliferative effect  in vestibular.

Although Merlin's function as a tumor suppressor and regulator of mitogenic  signaling networks such as the Ras/rac, Akt, and Hippo pathways is  well-documented, in mammals as well as in insects, its role during cell cycle  progression remains unclear. In this study, using a combination of approaches,  including FACS analysis, time-lapse imaging, immunofluorescence microscopy, and  co-immunoprecipitation, we show that Ser-518 of Merlin is a substrate of the  Aurora protein kinase A during mitosis and that its phosphorylation facilitates  the phosphorylation of a newly discovered site, Thr-581. We found that the  expression in HeLa cells of a Merlin variant that is phosphorylation-defective  on both sites leads to a defect in centrosomes and mitotic spindles positioning  during metaphase and delays the transition from metaphase to anaphase. We also  show that the dual mitotic phosphorylation not only reduces Merlin binding to  microtubules but also timely modulates ezrin interaction with the cytoskeleton.  Finally, we identify several point mutants of Merlin associated with  neurofibromatosis type 2 that display an aberrant phosphorylation profile along  with defective α-tubulin-binding properties. Altogether, our findings of an  Aurora A-mediated interaction of Merlin with α-tubulin and ezrin suggest a  potential role for Merlin in cell cycle progression.  © 2019 Mandati et al.

Inactivation of the tumor suppressor NF2/merlin underlies neurofibromatosis type  2 (NF2) and some sporadic tumors. Previous studies have established that merlin  mediates contact inhibition of proliferation; however, the exact mechanisms  remain obscure and multiple pathways have been implicated. We have previously  reported that merlin inhibits Ras and Rac activity during contact inhibition,  but how merlin regulates Ras activity has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate  that merlin can directly interact with both Ras and p120RasGAP (also named  RasGAP). While merlin does not increase the catalytic activity of RasGAP, the  interactions with Ras and RasGAP may fine-tune Ras signaling. In vivo, loss of  RasGAP in Schwann cells, unlike the loss of merlin, failed to promote  tumorigenic growth in an orthotopic model. Therefore, modulation of Ras  signaling through RasGAP likely contributes to, but is not sufficient to account  for, merlin's tumor suppressor activity. Our study provides new insight into the  mechanisms of merlin-dependent Ras regulation and may have additional  implications for merlin-dependent regulation of other small GTPases.

Inactivation of the NF1 tumor suppressor in MPNST results in upregulation of  mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling and angiogenesis, which  contributes to disease progression. We conducted a phase II study for patients  (pts) with refractory MPNST combining everolimus (10 mg PO once daily) with  bevacizumab (10 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks) to determine the clinical benefit rate  (CBR) (complete response, partial response (PR), or stable disease  (SD) ≥ 4 months). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients ≥18 years old with chemotherapy refractory  sporadic or NF1 MPNST were eligible. Tumor response was assessed after every 2  cycles (the WHO criteria). A two-stage design targeting a 25% CBR was used:  if ≥ 1/15 pts in stage 1 responded, enrollment would be expanded by 10 pts, and  if ≥ 4/25 patients had clinical benefit, the combination would be considered  active. RESULTS: Twenty-five pts, 17 with NF1 and 8 with sporadic MPNST, enrolled. One  of 15 pts in stage 1 had clinical benefit. Of 10 additional pts enrolled, 2 had  clinical benefit. The median number of completed cycles was 3 (range 1-16).  Adverse events were similar to those known for this combination. CONCLUSION: With a CBR of 12% (3/25), the combination of everolimus and  bevacizumab did not reach the study's target response rate and is not considered  active in refractory MPNST.

Schwannomatosis is a multiple tumor syndrome in which patients develop benign  tumors along peripheral nerves throughout the body. The first symptom with which  schwannomatosis patients often present, prior to discovery of tumors, is pain.  This pain can be debilitating and is often inadequately alleviated by  pharmacological approaches. Schwannomatosis-associated pain can be localized to  the area of a tumor, or widespread. Moreover, not all tumors are painful, and  the occurrence of pain is often unrelated to tumor size or location. We  speculate that some individual tumors, but not others, secrete factors that act  on nearby nerves to augment nociception by producing neuronal sensitization or  spontaneous neuronal firing. We created cell lines from human SWN tumors with  varying degrees of pain. We have found that conditioned medium (CM) collected  from painful SWN tumors, but not that from nonpainful SWN tumors, sensitized DRG  neurons, causing increased sensitivity to depolarization by KCl, increased  response to noxious TRPV1 and TRPA1 agonists and also upregulated the expression  of pain-associated genes in DRG cultures. Multiple cytokines were also detected  at higher levels in CM from painful tumors. Taken together our data demonstrate  a differential ability of painful versus non-painful human schwannomatosis tumor  cells to secrete factors that augment sensory neuron responsiveness, and thus  identify a potential determinant of pain heterogeneity in schwannomatosis.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder whose  neurodevelopmental symptoms include impaired executive function, attention, and  spatial learning and could be due to perturbed mesolimbic dopaminergic  circuitry. However, these circuits have never been directly assayed in vivo. We  employed the genetically encoded optical dopamine sensor dLight1 to monitor  dopaminergic neurotransmission in the ventral striatum of NF1 mice during  motivated behavior. Additionally, we developed novel systemic AAV vectors to  facilitate morphological reconstruction of dopaminergic populations in cleared  tissue. We found that NF1 mice exhibit reduced spontaneous dopaminergic  neurotransmission that was associated with excitation/inhibition imbalance in  the ventral tegmental area and abnormal neuronal morphology. NF1 mice also had  more robust dopaminergic and behavioral responses to salient visual stimuli,  which were independent of learning, and rescued by optogenetic inhibition of  non-dopaminergic neurons in the VTA. Overall, these studies provide a first in  vivo characterization of dopaminergic circuit function in the context of NF1 and  reveal novel pathophysiological mechanisms.  © 2019, Robinson et al.

INTRODUCTION: Children with the single-gene disorder neurofibromatosis type 1  (NF1) appear to be at an increased risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and  exhibit a unique social-cognitive phenotype compared with children with  idiopathic ASD. A complete framework is required to better understand autism in  NF1, from neurobiological levels through to behavioural and functional outcomes.  The primary aims of this study are to establish the frequency of ASD in children  with NF1, examine the social cognitive phenotype, investigate the  neuropsychological processes contributing to ASD symptoms and poor social  functioning in children with NF1, and to investigate novel structural and  functional neurobiological markers of ASD and social dysfunction in NF1. The  secondary aim of this study is to compare the neuropsychological and  neurobiological features of ASD in children with NF1 to a matched group of  patients with idiopathic ASD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is an international, multisite, prospective,  cross-sectional cohort study of children with NF1, idiopathic ASD and typically  developing (TD) controls. Participants will be 200 children with NF1 (3-15 years  of age), 70 TD participants (3-15 years) and 35 children with idiopathic ASD  (7-15 years). Idiopathic ASD and NF1 cases will be matched on age, sex and  intelligence. All participants will complete cognitive testing and parents will  rate their child's behaviour on standardised questionnaires. Neuroimaging will  be completed by a subset of participants aged 7 years and older. Children with  NF1 that screen at risk for ASD on the parent-rated Social Responsiveness Scale  2nd Edition will be invited back to complete the Autism Diagnostic Observation  Scale 2nd Edition and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised to determine whether  they fulfil ASD diagnostic criteria. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has hospital ethics approval and the  results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and  international conferences.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Merlin ((Moesin-ezrin-radixin-like protein, also known as schwannomin) is a  tumor suppressor protein which is encoded by the neurofibromatosis type 2 gene,  NF2. Loss of function mutations or deletions in NF2 which normally restrains  tumor growth, leads to the formation of multiple tumors including schwannoma,  meningioma and ependymoma. We tested whether NF2/Merlin is expressed and exerts  similar control on proliferation of colorectal cancer cells and modulates the  rate of their apoptosis. Expression of NF2/Merlin was reduced in colorectal  cancer cells as compared with adjacent non-cancerous cells. Overexpression of  NF2 inhibited colony formation by tumor cells and inhibited proliferation of  cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. The rate of apoptosis was also increased  in colorectal cancer cells by overexpression of NF2. These findings show that  NF2/Merlin is also reduced in tumors that do not arise in the context of  neurofibromatosis and that induction of its expression might be used to control  tumor growth.

The carbon and nitrogen components of glutamine are used for multiple  biosynthetic processes by tumors. Glutamine metabolism and the therapeutic  potential of glutamine antagonists (GA), however, are incompletely understood in  malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), an aggressive soft tissue  sarcoma observed in patients with neurofibromatosis type I. We investigated  glutamine dependence of MPNST using JHU395, a novel orally bioavailable GA  prodrug designed to circulate inert in plasma, but permeate and release active  GA within target tissues. Human MPNST cells, compared with Schwann cells derived  from healthy peripheral nerve, were selectively susceptible to both glutamine  deprivation and GA dose-dependent growth inhibition. In vivo, orally  administered JHU395 delivered active GA to tumors with over 2-fold higher  tumor-to-plasma exposure, and significantly inhibited tumor growth in a murine  flank MPNST model without observed toxicity. Global metabolomics studies and  stable isotope-labeled flux analyses in tumors identified multiple  glutamine-dependent metabolites affected, including prominent effects on purine  synthesis. These data demonstrate that glutamine antagonism is a potential  antitumor strategy for MPNST.  ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.

PURPOSE: Bevacizumab treatment at 7.5 mg/kg every 3 weeks results in improved  hearing in approximately 35%-40% of patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2)  and progressive vestibular schwannomas (VSs). However, the optimal dose is  unknown. In this multicenter phase II and biomarker study, we evaluated the  efficacy and safety of high-dose bevacizumab in pediatric and adult patients  with NF2 with progressive VS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Bevacizumab was given for 6 months at 10 mg/kg every 2  weeks, followed by 18 months at 5 mg/kg every 3 weeks. The primary end point was  hearing response defined by word recognition score (WRS) at 6 months. Secondary  end points included toxicity, radiographic response, quality of life (QOL), and  plasma biomarkers. RESULTS: Twenty-two participants with NF2 (median age, 23 years) with  progressive hearing loss in the target ear (median baseline WRS, 53%) were  enrolled. Nine (41%) of 22 participants achieved a hearing response at 6 months  (1 of 7 children and 8 of 15 adults; P = .08). Radiographic response was seen in  7 (32%) of 22 patients with VS at 6 months (7 of 15 adults and 0 of 7 children;  P = .05). Common mild to moderate adverse events included hypertension, fatigue,  headache, and irregular menstruation. Improvement in NF2-related QOL and  reduction in tinnitus-related distress were reported in 30% and 60% of  participants, respectively. Paradoxically, high-dose bevacizumab treatment was  not associated with a significant decrease in free vascular endothelial growth  factor but was associated with increased carbonic anhydrase IX, hepatocyte  growth factor, placental growth factor, stromal cell-derived factor 1α, and  basic fibroblast growth factor concentrations in plasma. CONCLUSION: High-dose bevacizumab seems to be no more effective than  standard-dose bevacizumab for treatment of patients with NF2 with hearing loss.  In contrast to adults, pediatric participants did not experience tumor  shrinkage. However, adult and pediatric participants reported similar  improvement in QOL during induction. Novel approaches using bevacizumab should  be considered for children with NF2.  DOI: 10.1200/JCO.19.01367 PMCID: PMC7098833 PMID: 31626572 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",False,Clinical trial protocol

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are an aggressive soft-tissue  sarcoma amenable only to surgical resection. Oncolytic herpes simplex viruses  (oHSVs) are a promising experimental therapy. We previously showed that basal  interferon (IFN) and nuclear factor κB (NFκB) signaling upregulate  IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression and restrict efficient viral infection and  cell-to-cell spread in ∼50% of tested MPNSTs. Stimulator of Interferon Genes  (STING) integrates DNA sensor activity and mediates downstream IFN signaling in  infected cells. We sought to identify STING's role in oHSV resistance and  contribution to basal ISG upregulation in MPNSTs. We show that the level of  STING activity in human MPNST cell lines is predictive of oHSV sensitivity and  that resistant cell lines have intact mechanisms for detection of cytosolic  double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Furthermore, we show that STING downregulation  renders MPNSTs more permissive to oHSV infection and cell-to-cell spread. While  next-generation viruses can exploit this loss of STING activity,  first-generation viruses remain restricted. Finally, STING is not integral to  the previously-observed basal ISG upregulation, indicating that other pathways  contribute to basal IFN signaling in resistant MPNSTs. These data broaden our  understanding of the intrinsic pathways in MPNSTs and their role in oHSV  resistance and offer potential targets to potentiate oncolytic virus activity.  © 2019 The Authors.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a cancer predisposition syndrome that results  from dominant loss-of-function mutations mainly in the NF1 gene. Large  rearrangements are present in 5-10% of affected patients, generally encompass  NF1 neighboring genes, and are correlated with a more severe NF1 phenotype.  Evident genotype-phenotype correlations and the importance of the co-deleted  genes are difficult to establish. In our study we employed an evolutionary  approach to provide further insights into the understanding of the fundamental  function of genes that are co-deleted in subjects with NF1 microdeletions. Our  goal was to access the ortholog and paralog relationship of these genes in  primates and verify if purifying or positive selection are acting on these  genes. Fourteen genes were analyzed in twelve mammalian species. Of these, four  and ten genes showed positive selection and purifying selection, respectively.  The protein, RNF135, showed three sites under positive selection at the RING  finger domain, which may have been selected to increase efficiency in  ubiquitination routes in primates. The phylogenetic analysis suggests distinct  evolutionary constraint between the analyzed genes. With these analyses, we hope  to help clarify the correlation of the co-deletion of these genes and the more  severe phenotype of NF1.

Mutations in the neurofibromin 2 (NF2) gene were among the first genetic  alterations implicated in meningioma tumorigenesis, based on analysis of  neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) patients who not only develop vestibular  schwannomas but later have a high incidence of meningiomas. The NF2 gene  product, merlin, is a tumor suppressor that is thought to link the actin  cytoskeleton with plasma membrane proteins and mediate contact-dependent  inhibition of proliferation. However, the early recognition of the crucial role  of NF2 mutations in the pathogenesis of the majority of meningiomas has not yet  translated into useful clinical insights, due to the complexity of merlin's many  interacting partners and signaling pathways. Next-generation sequencing studies  and increasingly sophisticated NF2-deletion-based in vitro and in vivo models  have helped elucidate the consequences of merlin loss in meningioma  pathogenesis. In this review, we seek to summarize recent findings and provide  future directions toward potential therapeutics for this tumor.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis 1 and 2, although involving two different tumour  suppressor genes (neurofibromin and merlin, respectively), are both cancer  predisposition syndromes that disproportionately affect cells of neural crest  origin. New therapeutic approaches for both NF1 and NF2 are badly needed. In  promising previous work we demonstrated that two non-steroidal analogues of  2-methoxy-oestradiol (2ME2),  STX3451(2-(3-bromo-4,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-7-methoxy-6-sulfamoyloxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline),  and STX2895  (7-Ethyl-6-sulfamoyloxy-2-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline)  reduced tumour cell growth and induced apoptosis in malignant and benign human  Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) tumour cells. In earlier NF1 mechanism of action  studies we found that in addition to their effects on non-classical  hormone-sensitive pathways, STX agents acted on the actin- and  myosin-cytoskeleton, as well as PI3Kinase and MTOR signaling pathways. Tumour  growth in NF2 cells is affected by different inhibitors from those affecting NF1  growth pathways: specifically, NF2 cells are affected by merlin-downstream  pathway inhibitors. Because Merlin, the affected tumour suppressor gene in NF2,  is also known to be involved in stabilizing membrane-cytoskeletal complexes, as  well as in cell proliferation, and apoptosis, we looked for potentially common  mechanisms of action in the agents' effects on NF1 and NF2. We set out to  determine whether STX agents could therefore also provide a prospective avenue  for treatment of NF2. METHODS: STX3451 and STX2895 were tested in dose-dependent studies for their  effects on growth parameters of malignant and benign NF2 human tumour cell lines  in vitro. The mechanisms of action of STX3451 and STX2895 were also analysed. RESULTS: Although neither of the agents tested affected cell growth or apoptosis  in the NF2 tumour cell lines tested through the same mechanisms by which they  affect these parameters in NF1 tumour cell lines, both agents disrupted actin-  and myosin-based cytoskeletal structures in NF2 cell lines, with subsequent  effects on growth and cell death. CONCLUSIONS: Both STX3451 and STX2895 provide new approaches for inducing cell  death and lowering tumour burden in NF2 as well as in NF1, which both have  limited treatment options.

The RAS signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of developmental  processes, including cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation, in the  central nervous system (CNS). Germline mutations in the RAS signaling pathway  genes are associated with a group of neurodevelopmental disorders, collectively  called RASopathy, which includes neurofibromatosis type 1, Noonan syndrome,  cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome, and Costello syndrome. Most mutations  associated with RASopathies increase the activity of the RAS-ERK signaling  pathway, and therefore, most individuals with RASopathies share common  phenotypes, such as a short stature, heart defects, facial abnormalities, and  cognitive impairments, which are often accompanied by abnormal CNS development.  Recent studies using mouse models of RASopathies demonstrated that particular  mutations associated with each disorder disrupt CNS development in a  mutation-specific manner. Here, we reviewed the recent literatures that  investigated the developmental role of RASopathy-associated mutations using  mutant mice, which provided insights into the specific contribution of RAS-ERK  signaling molecules to CNS development and the subsequent impact on cognitive  function in adult mice.

AIM: Cutaneous neurofibroma (cNF), a hallmark feature of neurofibromatosis type  1 (NF1), results in psychological and physical damage to patients. Considering  the important role of mast cells in neurofibroma development, the aim of this  study was to elucidate the underlying mechanism of the interaction between cNF  cells and mast cells. MAIN METHODS: SW10 cells with Nf1 knocked down were used as a cNF cell model.  3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and colony  formation assays, as well as a mouse xenograft tumor model, were used to assess  the cNF tumor growth in vivo and in vitro. ELISAs and IHC were used to examine  the inflammatory activity of mast cells. KEY FINDINGS: We demonstrated that cNF cells activated mast cells, which in turn  promoted the cNF cell growth, while suppression of the inflammatory activity of  cNF-associated mast cells reversed their stimulating effect on the growth of cNF  cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that SW10 cells upregulated  PLCγ/AKT/IκBα/p65 signaling in mast cells, thereby increasing inflammation.  Moreover, PLCγ modulated the AKT/IκBα/p65 signaling activity and played a  critical role in the interaction of mast cells and cNF cells. Knockdown of PLCγ  in mast cells diminished their cNF cell-induced inflammatory activity and  subsequently reduced the cNF cell growth in vivo and in vitro. SIGNIFICANCE: This study revealed a novel interaction between mast cells and cNF  cells, suggesting a potential strategy for treating cNF by targeting the newly  recognized signaling pathway.

The time from identifying a drug target to a new drug approval is often measured  in decades and can take even longer for therapies to treat rare diseases. In  fact, 95% of rare diseases do not have a specific therapy approved at all.  Coordinated efforts to augment the drug development pipeline along with  long-term and comprehensive support that enable scientific breakthroughs for  rare diseases are possible, but it requires integration across multiple  stakeholders. This article analyzes the coordinated funding efforts of four  federal and philanthropic organizations to advance drug development for  neurofibromatosis type 1-associated tumors and discusses how these organizations  have been collaborating and evolved practices to optimize funding and research  support.  © 2019 The Authors.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 is an inherited condition with variable  phenotypic expression and a high medical and social burden. The objectives of  this patient survey were to better understand the real-world experiences of  patients living with cutaneous neurofibromas (cNF), to perceive their  satisfaction and feelings about cNF current management (only laser and surgery  are currently available), and to highlight their expectations of new therapeutic  modalities. RESULTS: One hundred seventy patients from 4 European countries took part in the  study, 65% (n = 110) were women and mean age was 39 years old. 96% (n = 164) of  respondents have cNF on visible parts of the body and the survey confirmed that  total number of cNF and visibility increase with age. Patients reported that cNF  mainly impacts everyday mood, general daily life and social life. The visibility  of cNF had a higher impact than their number. 92% (n = 156) of patients have a  regular and multidisciplinary medical follow-up. The dermatologist is one of the  most consulted healthcare professionals. 76% (n = 130) of respondents have  treated their cNF: 65% (n = 111) had surgery and 38% (n = 64) had multiple laser  sessions. Frequency of operations and regrowth of cNF were the two most  unsatisfactory aspects with both treatments for patients. Indeed, after removal,  new cNF appear in more than 75% (n = 128) of cases. As a future treatment,  patients expected a topical (30%, n = 51) or oral medication (29%, n = 50).  Around 2 out of 3 patients would agree to take it at least once a day or more  for life but they would like a well-tolerated treatment. According to patients,  the most important effectiveness criteria of a new treatment are to block cNF  growth and reduce their number. 70% (n = 119) of patients would consider a  future treatment moderately effective to very effective if it could clear 30% of  cNF. CONCLUSIONS: This first cNF European patient community survey confirmed that the  visible stigma and unaesthetic aspect of cNF have an important impact on  patients' quality of life. The survey highlighted that patients were not  entirely satisfied with the actual surgery and laser treatments and revealed  their clear and realistic expectations for future treatment of cNF.

Neurofibromin is a tumor suppressor encoded by the NF1 gene, which is mutated in  Rasopathy disease neurofibromatosis type I. Defects in NF1 lead to aberrant  signaling through the RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway due to  disruption of the neurofibromin GTPase-activating function on RAS family small  GTPases. Very little is known about the function of most of the neurofibromin  protein; to date, biochemical and structural data exist only for its GAP domain  and a region containing a Sec-PH motif. To better understand the role of this  large protein, here we carried out a series of biochemical and biophysical  experiments, including size-exclusion chromatography-multiangle light scattering  (SEC-MALS), small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering, and analytical  ultracentrifugation, indicating that full-length neurofibromin forms a  high-affinity dimer. We observed that neurofibromin dimerization also occurs in  human cells and likely has biological and clinical implications. Analysis of  purified full-length and truncated neurofibromin variants by negative-stain EM  revealed the overall architecture of the dimer and predicted the potential  interactions that contribute to the dimer interface. We could reconstitute  structures resembling high-affinity full-length dimers by mixing N- and  C-terminal protein domains in vitro The reconstituted neurofibromin was capable  of GTPase activation in vitro, and co-expression of the two domains in human  cells effectively recapitulated the activity of full-length neurofibromin. Taken  together, these results suggest how neurofibromin dimers might form and be  stabilized within the cell.  © 2020 Sherekar et al.

Theoretically, vascular endothelial growth  factor receptors (VEGFRs)-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) can kill both  tumor vessel cells and tumor cells expressing VEGFRs. Here we show an  exploratory clinical study of VEGFRs peptide vaccine in seven patients with  progressive NF2-derived schwannomas. Hearing improves in 2/5 assessable patients  (40%) as determined by international guidelines, with increases in word  recognition scores. Tumor volume reductions of ≥20% are observed in two  patients, including one in which bevacizumab had not been effective. There are  no severe adverse events related to the vaccine. Both VEGFR1-specific and  VEGFR2-specific CTLs are induced in six patients. Surgery is performed after  vaccination in two patients, and significant reductions in the expression  of VEGFRs in schwannomas are observed. Therefore, this clinical immunotherapy  study demonstrates the safety and preliminary efficacy of VEGFRs peptide  vaccination in patients with NF2.

Abundant mast cell infiltration and disease initiation at puberty are hallmark  features of cutaneous neurofibroma (cNF). However, the association between mast  cell infiltration and steroid hormones in cNF remains unclear. Here, we  determined that androgen receptor (AR) expression is positively associated with  mast cell density in cNF tissues. Moreover, both in vitro cell experiments and  in vivo mouse models verified that activated AR promoted mast cell infiltration  and that AR inhibition reduced mast cell infiltration. Analyses in cell models  and xenograft tumours both demonstrated that AR upregulated Yes associate   protein 1 (YAP)-adrenomedullin (AM) signalling. Clinical samples from cNF  patients further verified that AR was positively related to YAP and AM.  Mechanistic analysis revealed that AR accelerates AM transcription via enhancing  YAP- TEA domain transcription factor (TEAD) binding to the AM promoter.  Consequently, the upregulated AM enhanced mast cell recruitment. Interruption of  the YAP-TEAD interaction or inhibition of AM could impair mast cell accumulation  induced by active AR, which indicated that this newly found signalling pathway  may provide novel targets for cNF treatment.

Recent studies have demonstrated circular RNAs (circRNAs) to be widely expressed  and to have important physiological functions. However, the expression,  regulation, and function of circRNAs in neuroglial cells are unknown. Herein, we  characterized the expression, regulation, and function of circRNAs in  astrocytes. Astrocyte circRNAs were identified by computational analysis of  newborn SD rat primary astrocytes cultured with 20 g/L D-galactose. In this  manner, 7376 circRNAs were identified, among which most circRNAs (5754) were  derived from annot_exons, whereas 27 were antisense, 853 were exon/intron, 329  were intergenic, 41 were intronic, and 372 were one exon. Among these,  circNF1-419 was demonstrated to regulate autophagy, in over-expressing  circNF1-419 transfected astrocytes, through the PI3K-I/Akt-AMPK-mTOR and  PI3K-I/Akt-mTOR signaling pathways. An adenovirus associated virus packaging  system (virus titer 1 ×1012), over-expressing circNF1-419 and injected into  mouse cerebral cortex, showed autophagy enhancing activity by binding the  proteins Dynamin-1 and Adaptor protein 2 B1 (AP2B1). This binding regulated  aging markers (p21, p35/25, and p16) and inflammatory factors (TNF-α and NF-κB),  and reduced the expression of Alzheimer's disease marker proteins (Tau, p-Tau,  Aβ1-42, and APOE), which delayed senile dementia. Transcriptome analysis of the  brain showed that circNF1-419 improved other signaling pathways, especially  those related to the synapses of SAMP8 mice. These findings provide novel  insights into circNF1-419 and its potential usefulness for the diagnosis and  treatment of dementia by regulating Dynamin-1 and AP2B1 mediated autophagy.

BACKGROUND: Pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGG) are the most frequent brain  tumors in children. Up to 50% will be refractory to conventional chemotherapy.  It is now known that the majority of PLGG have activation of the MAPK/ERK  pathway. The same pathway is also activated in plexiform neurofibromas (PNs)  which are low-grade tumors involving peripheral nerves in patients with  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). These lesions are known to be refractory to  chemotherapy. Specific MEK inhibitors such as trametinib are now available and  have been approved for other cancers harboring mutations in the MAPK/ERK pathway  such as melanoma. We have observed significant responses to trametinib in  patients with refractory PLGG in our institutions and results from the phase I  study are promising. The treatment appears not only efficacious but is also  usually well tolerated. We hypothesize that we will observe responses in the  majority of refractory PLGG and PN treated with trametinib in this phase 2  study. METHODS: The primary objective is to determine the objective response rate of  trametinib as a single agent for treatment of progressing/refractory tumors with  MAPK/ERK pathway activation. The TRAM-01 study is a phase II multicentric  open-label basket trial including four groups. Group 1 includes NF1 patients  with progressing/refractory glioma. Group 2 includes NF1 patients with plexiform  neurofibroma. Group 3 includes patients with progressing/refractory glioma with  KIAA1549-BRAF fusion. Group 4 includes other patients with  progressing/refractory glioma with activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway. Eligible  patients for a given study group will receive daily oral trametinib at full dose  for a total of 18 cycles of 28 days. A total of 150 patients will be enrolled in  seven Canadian centers. Secondary objectives include the assessment of  progression-free survival, overall survival, safety and tolerability of  trametinib, serum levels of trametinib and evaluation of quality of life during  treatment. DISCUSSION: Trametinib will allow us to target directly and specifically the  MAPK/ERK pathway. We expect to observe a significant response in most patients.  Following our study, trametinib could be integrated into standard treatment of  PLGG and PN. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03363217 December 6, 2017.

These disorders include neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), Noonan  syndrome (NS), cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (CFC), and Costello syndrome (CS),  and others. RASopathies are characterized by heterogenous manifestations,  including congenital heart disease, failure to thrive, and increased risk of  cancers. Previous work led by the NCI Pediatric Oncology Branch has altered the  natural course of one of the key manifestations of the RASopathy NF1. Through  the conduct of a longitudinal cohort study and early phase clinical trials, the  MEK inhibitor selumetinib was identified as the first active therapy for the  NF1-related peripheral nerve sheath tumors called plexiform neurofibromas (PNs).  As a result, selumetinib was granted breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA  for the treatment of PN. Other RASopathy manifestations may also benefit from  RAS targeted therapies. The overall goal of Advancing RAS/RASopathy Therapies  (ART), a new NCI initiative, is to develop effective therapies and prevention  strategies for the clinical manifestations of the non-NF1 RASopathies and for  tumors characterized by somatic RAS mutations. This report reflects discussions  from a February 2019 initiation meeting for this project, which had broad  international collaboration from basic and clinical researchers and patient  advocates.

AIMS: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most  frequent neurocognitive impairments in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and a  well-known risk factor for intellectual dysfunction in general. Since NF1 is per  se associated with intellectual difficulties, this comorbidity may be crucial  for the cognitive development of affected patients. In our study, we  investigated if attention deficits are associated with intellectual functioning  in NF1 and if children with NF1 plus ADHD differ in their intellectual and  attention profiles from children affected by NF1-only or ADHD only. METHODS: 111 children aged between 6 and 12 years (53 NF1 plus ADHD, 28  NF1-only, 30 ADHD-only) performed the German version of the intelligence test  WISC-IV and a continuous performance test (T.O.V.A.) to assess attention  functions. Parents completed questionnaires about everyday attention and  executive functions (Conners 3®, BRIEF). RESULTS: Children with NF1 plus ADHD showed significantly lower intelligence  test scores (full-scale IQ: 89.39 [1.40]) than patients with NF1-only  (full-scale IQ: 101.14 [1.98]; p < .001), and intellectual functioning  correlated significantly with attention performance in NF1 (p < .001). As  compared to NF1-only, attention, and executive functioning were impaired on  several dimensions (T.O.V.A., Conners 3® and BRIEF) in NF1 plus ADHD. ADHD-only  was associated with significantly higher problem scores regarding  hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattention (Conners 3®). NF1-only was associated  with inattentiveness when compared to the normative sample of the T.O.V.A. CONCLUSION: NF1 is associated with variable attention problems. Severe attention  deficits appear to be a risk factor for intellectual dysfunction in NF1, more  than NF1 without attention deficit. NF1 plus ADHD presents a specific cognitive  profile, which differs from that of NF1 and from neurotypical ADHD.  Copyright © 2019 Magdalena Heimgärtner et al.

The use of radiation treatment has increased for both sporadic and  neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2)-associated vestibular schwannoma (VS). However,  there are a subset of radioresistant tumors and systemic treatments that are  seldom used in these patients. We investigated molecular alterations after  radiation in three NF2-associated and five sporadically operated recurrent VS  after primary irradiation. We compared these findings with 49 non-irradiated (36  sporadic and 13 NF2-associated) VS through gene-expression profiling and pathway  analysis. Furthermore, we stained the key molecules of the distinct pathway by  immunohistochemistry. A total of 195 differentially expressed genes in sporadic  and NF2-related comparisons showed significant differences based on the criteria  of p value < 0.05 and a two-fold change. These genes were involved in pathways  that are known to be altered upon irradiation (e.g., mammalian target of  rapamycin (mTOR), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and vascular endothelial  growth factor (VEGF) signaling). We observed a combined downregulation of PTEN  signaling and an upregulation of mTOR signaling in progressive NF2-associated VS  after irradiation. Immunostainings with mTOR and PTEN antibodies confirmed the  respective molecular alterations. Taken together, mTOR inhibition might be a  promising therapeutic strategy in NF2-associated VS progress after irradiation.

NF1 patients  are predisposed to formation of several type solid tumors as well as to juvenile  myelomonocytic leukemia. Loss of NF1 results in dysregulation of MAPK, PI3K and  other signaling cascades, to promote cell proliferation and to inhibit cell  apoptosis. The RUNX1 gene is associated with stem cell function in many tissues,  and plays a key role in the fate of stem cells. Aberrant RUNX1 expression leads  to context-dependent tumor development, in which RUNX1 may serve as a tumor  suppressor or an oncogene in specific tissue contexts. The co-occurrence of  mutation of NF1 and RUNX1 is detected rarely in several cancers and signaling  downstream of RAS-MAPK can alter RUNX1 function. Whether aberrant RUNX1  expression contributes to NF1-related tumorigenesis is not fully understood.  This review focuses on the role of RUNX1 in NF1-related tumors and blood  disorders, and in sporadic cancers.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a relatively common genetic disease, with a  prevalence ranging between 1/3000 and 1/6000 people worldwide. The disease  affects multiple systems with cutaneous, neurologic, and orthopedic as major  manifestations which lead to significant morbidity or mortality. Indeed, NF1  patients are at an increased risk of malignancy and have a life expectancy about  10-15 years shorter than the general population. The mainstay of management of  NF1 is a patient-centered longitudinal care with age-specific monitoring of  clinical manifestations, aiming at the early recognition and symptomatic  treatment of complications as they occur. Protocole national de diagnostic et de  soins (PNDS) are mandatory French clinical practice guidelines for rare diseases  required by the French national plan for rare diseases. Their purpose is to  provide health care professionals with guidance regarding the optimal diagnostic  and therapeutic management of patients affected with a rare disease; and thus,  harmonizing their management nationwide. PNDS are usually developed through a  critical literature review and a multidisciplinary expert consensus. The purpose  of this article is to present the French guidelines on NF1, making them even  more available to the international medical community. We further dwelled on the  emerging new evidence that might have therapeutic potential or a strong impact  on NF1 management in the coming feature. Given the complexity of the disease,  the management of children and adults with NF1 entails the full complement  healthcare providers and communication among the various specialties.

PURPOSE: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive soft  tissue sarcomas. Combining Hsp90 inhibitors to enhance endoplasmic reticulum  stress with mTOR inhibition results in dramatic MPNST shrinkage in a genetically  engineered MPNST mouse model. Ganetespib is an injectable potent small molecule  inhibitor of Hsp90. Sirolimus is an oral mTOR inhibitor. We sought to determine  the safety, tolerability, and recommended dose of ganetespib and sirolimus in  patients with refractory sarcomas and assess clinical benefits in patients with  unresectable/refractory MPNSTs. Patients and Methods. In this  multi-institutional, open-label, phase 1/2 study of ganetespib and sirolimus,  patients ≥16 years with histologically confirmed refractory sarcoma (phase 1) or  MPNST (phase 2) were eligible. A conventional 3 + 3 dose escalation design was  used for phase 1. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic measures were evaluated.  Primary objectives of phase 2 were to determine the clinical benefit rate (CBR)  of this combination in MPNSTs. Patient-reported outcomes assessed pain. RESULTS: Twenty patients were enrolled (10 per phase). Toxicities were  manageable; most frequent non-DLTs were diarrhea, elevated liver transaminases,  and fatigue. The recommended dose of ganetespib was 200 mg/m2 intravenously on  days 1, 8, and 15 with sirolimus 4 mg orally once daily with day 1 loading dose  of 12 mg. In phase 1, one patient with leiomyosarcoma achieved a sustained  partial response. In phase 2, no responses were observed. The median number of  cycles treated was 2 (1-4). Patients did not meet the criteria for clinical  benefit as defined per protocol. Pain ratings decreased or were stable. CONCLUSION: Despite promising preclinical rationale and tolerability of the  combination therapy, no responses were observed, and the study did not meet  parameters for further evaluation in MPNSTs.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a monogenic syndrome that gives rise to  numerous symptoms including cognitive impairment, skeletal abnormalities, and  growth of benign nerve sheath tumors. Nearly all NF1 patients develop cutaneous  neurofibromas (cNFs), which occur on the skin surface, whereas 40-60% of  patients develop plexiform neurofibromas (pNFs), which are deeply embedded in  the peripheral nerves. Patients with pNFs have a ~10% lifetime chance of these  tumors becoming malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). These tumors  have a severe prognosis and few treatment options other than surgery. Given the  lack of therapeutic options available to patients with these tumors,  identification of druggable pathways or other key molecular features could aid  ongoing therapeutic discovery studies. In this work, we used statistical and  machine learning methods to analyze 77 NF1 tumors with genomic data to  characterize key signaling pathways that distinguish these tumors and identify  candidates for drug development. We identified subsets of latent gene expression  variables that may be important in the identification and etiology of cNFs,  pNFs, other neurofibromas, and MPNSTs. Furthermore, we characterized the  association between these latent variables and genetic variants, immune  deconvolution predictions, and protein activity predictions.

Despite being in the same pathway, Neurofibromatosis Type 1  (NF1) and Legius syndrome (LS) typically present with phenotypes distinct from  Noonan spectrum disorders (NSDs). However, some NF1/LS individuals also exhibit  NSD phenotypes, often referred to as Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome (NFNS),  and may be mistakenly evaluated for NSDs, delaying diagnosis, and affecting  patient management. METHODS: A derivation cohort of 28 patients with a prior negative NSD panel and  either NFNS or a suspicion of NSD and café-au-lait spots underwent NF1 and  SPRED1 sequencing. To further determine the utility and burden of adding these  genes, a validation cohort of 505 patients with a suspected RASopathy were  tested on a 14-gene RASopathy-associated panel. RESULTS: In the derivation cohort, six (21%) patients had disease-causing NF1 or  SPRED1 variants. In the validation cohort, 11 (2%) patients had disease-causing  variants and 15 (3%) had variants of uncertain significance in NF1 or SPRED1. Of  those with disease-causing variants, 5/17 only had an NSD diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Adding NF1 and SPRED1 to RASopathy panels can speed diagnosis and  improve patient management, without significantly increasing the burden of  inconclusive results.  © 2020 The Authors.

Early diagnosis of neurofibromatosis is significant to start the  multidisciplinary approach of this type of patient. This syndrome may be first  identified in pediatric dental care. This study is about a 9-year-old patient  who was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 1 from a plexiform neurofibroma  displayed in the left hemi-maxilla. From the microscopic diagnosis of the lesion  the investigation of other related injuries began, according to the diagnostic  criteria of the National Institute of Health (NIH), leading to the diagnosis of  systemic alterations. The parental awareness about the condition and the  establishment of multidisciplinary care are important for the treatment to be  more conservative and the patient has fewer complications with better quality of  life. The use of the diagnostic criteria in this case shows how methodization is  important for reaching more accurate and reliable diagnoses.

(#)Contributed equally  Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an inherited disorder characterized by  bilateral vestibular schwannomas (VS) that arise from neoplastic Schwann cells  (SCs). NF2-associated VSs are often accompanied by meningioma (MN), and the  majority of NF2 patients show loss of the NF2 tumor suppressor. mTORC1 and  mTORC2-specific serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) are  constitutively activated in MN with loss of NF2. In a recent high-throughput  kinome screen in NF2-null human arachnoidal and meningioma cells, we showed  activation of EPH RTKs, c-KIT, and SFK members independent of mTORC1/2  activation. Subsequently, we demonstrated in vitro and in vivo efficacy of  combination therapy with the dual mTORC1/2 inhibitor AZD2014 and the  multi-kinase inhibitor dasatinib. For these reasons, we investigated activated  mTORC1/2 and EPH receptor-mediated signaling in sporadic and NF2-associated VS.  Using primary human VS cells and a mouse allograft model of schwannoma, we  evaluated the dual mTORC1/2 inhibitor AZD2014 and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor  dasatinib as monotherapies and in combination. Escalating dose-response  experiments on primary VS cells grown from 15 human tumors show that combination  therapy with AZD2014 and dasatinib is more effective at reducing metabolic  activity than either drug alone and exhibits a therapeutic effect at a  physiologically reasonable concentration (~0.1 µM). In vivo, while AZD2014 and  dasatinib each inhibit tumor growth alone, the effect of combination therapy  exceeds that of either drug. Co-targeting the mTOR and EPH receptor pathways  with these or similar compounds may constitute a novel therapeutic strategy for  VS, a condition for which there is no FDA-approved pharmacotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Understanding the natural history of non-malignant peripheral nerve  sheath tumors (PNSTs) in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is critical to optimal  clinical care and the development of meaningful clinical trials. METHODS: We longitudinally analyzed growth of plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) and  of PNSTs with distinct nodular appearance (distinct nodular lesions [DNLs])  using volumetric MRI analysis in patients enrolled on a natural history study  (NCT00924196). RESULTS: DNLs were observed in 58/122 (45.6%) patients (median 2 DNLs/patient).  In DNLs that developed during follow-up, median age of development was 17 years.  A moderate negative correlation was observed between the estimated PN growth  rate and patients' age at initial MRI (Spearman's r [95% CI]: -0.60 [-0.73,  -0.43], n = 70), whereas only a weak correlation was observed for DNLs  (Spearman's r [95% CI]: -0.25 [-0.47, 0.004]; n = 61). We observed a moderate  negative correlation between tumor growth rate and baseline tumor volume for PNs  and DNLs (Spearman's r [95% CI]: -0.52 [-0.67, -0.32] and -0.61 [-0.75, -0.42],  respectively). Spontaneous tumor volume reduction was observed in 10 PNs and 7  DNLs (median decrease per year, 3.6% and 7.3%, respectively). CONCLUSION: We corroborate previously described findings that most rapidly  growing PNs are observed in young children. DNLs tend to develop later in life  and their growth is minimally age related. Distinct growth characteristics of  PNs and DNLs suggest that these lesions have a different biology and may require  different clinical management and clinical trial design. In a subset of PNs and  DNLs, slow spontaneous regression in tumor volume was seen.  Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Neuro-Oncology  2020.

Comment in     Dev Med Child Neurol. 2020 Jul;62(7):773. doi: 10.1111/dmcn.14550.  AIM: We examined key features of two outcome measures for social dysfunction and  autism spectrum disorder traits, the Social Responsiveness Scale, Second Edition  (SRS-2) and the Social Skills Improvement System - Rating Scales (SSIS-RS), in  children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). The aim of the study was to  provide objective evidence as to which behavioural endpoint should be used in  clinical trials. METHOD: Cross-sectional behavioural and demographic data were pooled from four  paediatric NF1 tertiary referral centres in Australia and the United States  (N=122; 65 males, 57 females; mean age [SD] 9y 2mo [3y], range 3-15y). RESULTS: Distributions of SRS-2 and SSIS-RS scores were unimodal and both  yielded deficits, with a higher proportion of severely impaired scores on the  SRS-2 (16.4%) compared to the SSIS-RS (8.2%). Pearson's product-moment  correlations revealed that both questionnaires were highly related to each other  (r=-0.72, p<0.001) and to measures of adaptive social functioning (both  p<0.001). Both questionnaires were significantly related to  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms, but only very weakly  associated with intelligence. INTERPRETATION: The SRS-2 and SSIS-RS capture social dysfunction associated with  NF1, suggesting both may be suitable choices for assessing social outcomes in  this population in a clinical trial. However, careful thought needs to be given  to the nature of the intervention when selecting either as a primary endpoint. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: The Social Responsiveness Scale, Second Edition yielded a  large deficit relative to population norms. The Social Skills Improvement System  - Rating Scales yielded a moderate deficit relative to population norms. Both  scales were highly correlated, suggesting that they are measuring a unitary  construct.  © 2020 Mac Keith Press.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive soft tissue  sarcomas that can arise most frequently in patients with neurofibromatosis type  1 (NF1). Despite an increasing understanding of the molecular mechanisms that  underlie these tumors, there remains limited therapeutic options for this  aggressive disease. One potentially critical finding is that a significant  proportion of MPNSTs exhibit recurrent mutations in the genes EED or SUZ12,  which are key components of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Tumors  harboring these genetic lesions lose the marker of transcriptional repression,  trimethylation of lysine residue 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3) and have  dysregulated oncogenic signaling. Given the recurrence of PRC2 alterations,  intensive research efforts are now underway with a focus on detailing the  epigenetic and transcriptomic consequences of PRC2 loss as well as development  of novel therapeutic strategies for targeting these lesions. In this review  article, we will summarize the recent findings of PRC2 in MPNST tumorigenesis,  including highlighting the functions of PRC2 in normal Schwann cell development  and nerve injury repair, as well as provide commentary on the potential  therapeutic vulnerabilities of a PRC2 deficient tumor cell.

METHODS: We conducted an open-label, phase 2 trial of selumetinib to determine  the objective response rate among patients with plexiform neurofibromas and to  assess clinical benefit. Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 and symptomatic  inoperable plexiform neurofibromas received oral selumetinib twice daily at a  dose of 25 mg per square meter of body-surface area on a continuous dosing  schedule (28-day cycles). Volumetric magnetic resonance imaging and clinical  outcome assessments (pain, quality of life, disfigurement, and function) were  performed at least every four cycles. Children rated tumor pain intensity on a  scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable). RESULTS: A total of 50 children (median age, 10.2 years; range, 3.5 to 17.4)  were enrolled from August 2015 through August 2016. The most frequent  neurofibroma-related symptoms were disfigurement (44 patients), motor  dysfunction (33), and pain (26). A total of 35 patients (70%) had a confirmed  partial response as of March 29, 2019, and 28 of these patients had a durable  response (lasting ≥1 year). After 1 year of treatment, the mean decrease in  child-reported tumor pain-intensity scores was 2 points, considered a clinically  meaningful improvement. In addition, clinically meaningful improvements were  seen in child-reported and parent-reported interference of pain in daily  functioning (38% and 50%, respectively) and overall health-related quality of  life (48% and 58%, respectively) as well as in functional outcomes of strength  (56% of patients) and range of motion (38% of patients). Five patients  discontinued treatment because of toxic effects possibly related to selumetinib,  and 6 patients had disease progression. The most frequent toxic effects were  nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea; an asymptomatic increase in the creatine  phosphokinase level; acneiform rash; and paronychia. CONCLUSIONS: In this phase 2 trial, most children with neurofibromatosis type 1  and inoperable plexiform neurofibromas had durable tumor shrinkage and clinical  benefit from selumetinib.

PMID:32190165,Auditory Brainstem Implantation for Adults With Neurofibromatosis 2 or Severe Inner Ear Abnormalities: A Health Technology Assessment.,"Auditory Brainstem Implantation for Adults With Neurofibromatosis 2 or Severe  Inner Ear Abnormalities: A Health Technology Assessment.  Ontario Health (Quality).  Collaborators: Lee C, Xie X, Falk L, Guo J, Wells D, Walter M.  BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is a rare genetic disorder that causes  vestibular schwannomas to develop in both eighth cranial nerves. Almost all  people with NF2 eventually become completely deaf as a result of progressive  tumour enlargement or following surgical or radiotherapy treatment. Other rare  abnormal conditions in the inner ears can also cause complete deafness. For  people with either indication who are not candidates for cochlear implantation,  auditory brainstem implantation is the only treatment option to restore some  functional hearing. We conducted a health technology assessment of auditory  brainstem implantation for adults with NF2 and severe inner ear abnormalities,  which included an evaluation of effectiveness, safety, cost-effectiveness, the  budget impact of publicly funding auditory brainstem implantation, and patient  preferences and values. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search of the clinical evidence.  We assessed the risk of bias of each included study using the Risk of Bias in  Non-randomized Studies-of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool and the quality of the  body of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment,  Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria. We performed a  systematic economic literature search. We did not conduct a primary economic  evaluation because the outcomes identified in our clinical evidence review were  difficult to translate into measures appropriate for health economic modelling.  We also analyzed the net budget impact of publicly funding auditory brainstem  implantation over the next 5 years in Ontario, including the device, presurgical  assessment, surgical procedure, and postsurgical rehabilitation. To  contextualize the potential value of auditory brainstem implants, we spoke with  six people with lived experience of NF2 and severe inner ear abnormalities. RESULTS: We included 22 publications (16 in NF2, five in severe inner ear  abnormalities, and one in complications of auditory brainstem implantation) in  the clinical evidence review. In adults with NF2, auditory brainstem  implantation when compared with no intervention allows any degree of improvement  in sound recognition (GRADE: High), allows any degree of improvement in speech  perception when used in conjunction with lip-reading (GRADE: High), and provides  subjective benefits of hearing (GRADE: High). It likely allows any degree of  improvement in speech perception when using the implant alone (GRADE: Moderate)  and may improve quality of life (GRADE: Low). In adults with severe inner ear  abnormalities, auditory brainstem implantation when compared with no  intervention likely allows any degree of improvement in sound recognition  (GRADE: Moderate) and in any speech perception when using the implant alone  (GRADE: Moderate). It may allow any degree of improvement in speech perception  when used in conjunction with lip-reading (GRADE: Low), provide subjective  benefits of hearing (GRADE: Low), and improve quality of life (GRADE: Low).We  did not identify any economic studies on auditory brainstem implantation for  adults with NF2 or adults with deafness due to severe inner ear abnormalities.  We estimated that the annual net budget impact of publicly funding auditory  brainstem implantation in Ontario over the next 5 years would range from about  $130,000 in year 1 for two procedures to about $260,000 in year 5 for four  procedures.People with whom we spoke who had received an auditory brainstem  implant reported that it restored some hearing ability and improved their  quality of life, though they also reported ongoing challenges in using the  device or side effects from the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: When compared with no intervention, auditory brainstem implantation  provides some benefit for completely deaf adults with NF2 or severe inner ear  abnormalities who are not candidates for cochlear implantation. Based on  evidence of moderate to high quality, auditory brainstem implants allow any  degree of improvement in sound recognition and in speech perception when used in  conjunction with lip-reading for people with NF2. The quality of evidence on  these outcomes was low to moderate for people with severe inner ear  abnormalities. These functional outcomes lead to subjective benefits of hearing  which are consistently reported in the literature and in interviews with  patients. We were unable to determine the cost-effectiveness of this treatment.  We estimate that publicly funding auditory brainstem implantation in Ontario  would result in additional costs of about $130,000 to $260,000 annually over the  next 5 years.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a rare, autosomal dominant disease with  variable clinical presentations. Large animal models are useful to help dissect  molecular mechanisms, determine relevant biomarkers, and develop effective  therapeutics. Here, we studied a NF1 minipig model (NF1+/ex42del) for the first  12 months of life to evaluate phenotype development, track disease progression,  and provide a comparison to human subjects. Through systematic evaluation, we  have shown that compared to littermate controls, the NF1 model develops  phenotypic characteristics of human NF1: [1] café-au-lait macules, [2]  axillary/inguinal freckling, [3] shortened stature, [4] tibial bone curvature,  and [5] neurofibroma. At 4 months, full body computed tomography imaging  detected significantly smaller long bones in NF1+/ex42del minipigs compared to  controls, indicative of shorter stature. We found quantitative evidence of  tibial bowing in a subpopulation of NF1 minipigs.

BACKGROUND: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are rare  aggressive sarcomas with poor prognosis. More than half of MPNSTs develop from  benign precursor tumors associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) which is  a tumor suppressor gene disorder. Early detection of malignant transformation in  NF1 patients is pivotal to improving survival. The primary aim of this study was  to evaluate the role of immuno-modulators as candidate biomarkers of malignant  transformation in NF1 patients with plexiform neurofibromas as well as  predictors of response to immunotherapeutic approaches. METHODS: Sera from a total of 125 NF1 patients with quantified internal tumor  load were included, and 25 of them had MPNSTs. A total of six immuno-modulatory  factors (IGFBP-1, PD-L1, IFN-α, GM-CSF, PGE-2, and AXL) were measured in these  sera using respective ELISA. RESULTS: NF1 patients with MPNSTs had significantly elevated PD-L1 levels in  their sera compared to NF1 patients without MPNSTs. By contrast, AXL  concentrations were significantly lower in sera of NF1-MPNST patients. IGFBP-1  and PGE2 serum levels did not differ between the two patient groups. IFN-α and  GM-CSF were below the detectable level in most samples. CONCLUSION: The immuno-modulator PD-L1 is upregulated in MPNST patients and  therefore may provide as a potential biomarker of malignant transformation in  patients with NF1 and as a response predictor for immunotherapeutic approaches.

A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 9 (ADAM9) is a member of the transmembrane  ADAM family. It is expressed in different types of solid cancer and promotes  tumor invasiveness. To the best of our knowledge, the present study was the  first to examine ADAM9 expression in vestibular schwannomas (VS) from patients  with and without neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) and to associate the data with  clinical parameters of the patients. The aim of the present study was to  evaluate if ADAM9 could be used as prognostic marker or therapeutic target.  ADAM9 mRNA and protein levels were measured in VS samples (n=60). A total of 30  of them were from patients with neurofibromatosis. Healthy peripheral nerves  from autopsies (n=10) served as controls. ADAM9 mRNA levels were measured by  PCR, and protein levels were determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and  western blotting (WB). The Hannover Classification was used to categorize tumor  extension and hearing loss. ADAM9 mRNA levels were 8.8-fold higher in VS  compared with in controls. The levels were 5.6-fold higher in patients with NF2  and 12-fold higher in patients with sporadic VS. WB revealed two mature isoforms  of the protein, and according to IHC ADAM9 was mainly expressed by S100-positive  Schwann cells. There was a strong correlation between ADAM9 mRNA expression and  the level of functional impairment (r~1, p=0.01). Particularly, the secreted  isoform of ADAM9 was expressed in patients with higher hearing impairment. ADAM9  mRNA was overexpressed in the tumor samples relative to healthy vestibular  nerves, and there was an association between higher ADAM9 expression levels and  greater hearing impairment. Therefore, ADAM9 may be a prognostic marker for VS,  and ADAM9 inhibition might have the potential as a systemic approach for the  treatment of VS.  Copyright: © Breun et al.

BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is  rather challenging due to its divergent morphologic heterogeneity and lack of  specific ancillary test. The emergence of H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) as a  new immunohistochemistry (IHC) marker for MPNST have recently available to  assist pathologists in differentiating MPNST from other histologic mimics. We  aim to study the expression pattern of H3K27me3 in MPNST and its histologic  mimickers and their association with the clinicopathological data. METHODOLOGY: A total of 59 benign and malignant spindle cell tumours (18 MPNST  and 41 of its histologic mimickers which included 10 schwannoma, 13  neurofibroma, 4 synovial sarcoma, 3 fibrosarcoma, 2 gastrointestinal stromal  tumour (GIST), 4 leiomyosarcoma, 1 spindle cell liposarcoma, 1 solitary fibrous  tumour, 2 low grade fibromyxoid sarcoma and 1 unclassified spindle cell  sarcoma), diagnosed from January 1998 to April 2018 in Hospital Universiti Sains  Malaysia (HUSM) were tested for H3K27me3 by IHC. The MPNST histological grade  was assessed based on the French Fe'de' ration Nationale des Centres de  LutteContre le Cancer (FNCLCC) for 3 tiers system (low grade, intermediate grade  and high grade). The clinicopathological data were retrieved from the patients'  record. RESULTS: A total of 61.1% (11/18 MPNST) showed loss of H3K27me3 expression which  is statistically significant as compared to its histologic mimics (p<0.001).  Similar findings (p=0.026) were also observed in high grade MPNST (81.8%),  intermediate grade MPNST (100%) and 0% in low grade MPNST. CONCLUSION: H3K27me3, combined with other panel of markers, is useful in MPNST  diagnosis to differentiate it from the histological mimickers.

Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1)-related Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors  (MPNST) are highly resistant sarcomas that account for significant mortality.  The mechanisms of therapy resistance are not well-understood in MPNSTs,  particularly with respect to kinase inhibition strategies. In this study, we  aimed to quantify the impact of both the genomic context and targeted therapy on  MPNST resistance using reverse phase phosphoproteome array (RPPA) analysis. We  treated tumorgrafts from three genetically engineered mouse models using MET  (capmatinib) and MEK (trametinib) inhibitors and doxorubicin, and assessed  phosphosignaling at 4 h, 2 days, and 21 days. Baseline kinase signaling in our  mouse models recapitulated an MET-addicted state (NF1-MET), P53 mutation  (NF1-P53), and HGF overexpression (NF1). Following perturbation with the drug,  we observed broad and redundant kinome adaptations that extended well beyond  canonical RAS/ERK or PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. MET and MEK inhibition were both  associated with an initial inflammatory response mediated by kinases in the  JAK/STAT pathway and NFkB. Growth signaling predominated at the 2-day and 21-day  time points as a result of broad RTK and intracellular kinase activation.  Interestingly, AXL and NFkB were strongly activated at the 2-day and 21-day time  points, and tightly correlated, regardless of the treatment type or genomic  context. The degree of kinome adaptation observed in innately resistant tumors  was significantly less than the surviving fractions of responsive tumors that  exhibited a latency period before reinitiating growth. Lastly, doxorubicin  resistance was associated with kinome adaptations that strongly favored growth  and survival signaling. These observations confirm that MPNSTs are capable of  profound signaling plasticity in the face of kinase inhibition or DNA damaging  agent administration. It is possible that by targeting AXL or NFkB, therapy  resistance can be mitigated.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an inherited neurological disorder.  Approximately 5-13% of NF1 patients may develop a malignant peripheral nerve  sheath tumor (MPNST), which is a neurofibrosarcoma transformed from the  plexiform neurofibroma or schwannoma. Given the large size and easy metastasis  of MPNST, it remains difficult to be cured by either surgical or conventional  chemotherapy. In this study, we investigated the possibility of combining  photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemotherapy to treat MPNST by using a  dual-effect liposome (named as PL-cDDP-Ce6), in which a chemotherapeutic agent,  cisplatin (cDDP), and photosensitizer, chlorine e6 (Ce6) were encapsulated in  the same carrier. The cytotoxic effect of PL-cDDP-Ce6 against MPNST cells was  significantly higher than cells treated with liposomal cDDP or Ce6 alone or in  combination after light irradiation. Treatment with the dual-effect liposomes in  mice bearing xenograft MPNST tumor reveals a significant increase in survival  rate compared to those treated with liposomal cDDP and Ce6 in combination.  Moreover, there is no weight loss or derangements of serum biochemistry. In  conclusion, this study demonstrates the clinical potential and advantage of  using this liposomal drug for the treatment of MPNST.

The Genomics of Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor (GeM) Consortium is an  international collaboration focusing on multi-omic analysis of malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), the most aggressive tumor associated  with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Here we present a summary of current  knowledge gaps, a description of our consortium and the cohort we have  assembled, and an overview of our plans for multi-omic analysis of these tumors.  We propose that our analysis will lead to a better understanding of the order  and timing of genetic events related to MPNST initiation and progression. Our  ten institutions have assembled 96 fresh frozen NF1-related (63%) and sporadic  MPNST specimens from 86 subjects with corresponding clinical and pathological  data. Clinical data have been collected as part of the International MPNST  Registry. We will characterize these tumors with bulk whole genome sequencing,  RNAseq, and DNA methylation profiling. In addition, we will perform  multiregional analysis and temporal sampling, with the same methodologies, on a  subset of nine subjects with NF1-related MPNSTs to assess tumor heterogeneity  and cancer evolution. Subsequent multi-omic analyses of additional archival  specimens will include deep exome sequencing (500×) and high density copy number  arrays for both validation of results based on fresh frozen tumors, and to  assess further tumor heterogeneity and evolution. Digital pathology images are  being collected in a cloud-based platform for consensus review. The result of  these efforts will be the largest MPNST multi-omic dataset with correlated  clinical and pathological information ever assembled.

Early-phase clinical trials using oral inhibitors of MEK, the mitogen-activated  protein kinase kinase, have demonstrated benefit for patients with  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated tumors, particularly progressive  low-grade gliomas and plexiform neurofibromas. Given this potential of MEK  inhibition as an effective medical therapy, the use of targeted agents in the  NF1 population is likely to increase substantially. For clinicians with limited  experience prescribing MEK inhibitors, concern about managing these treatments  may be a barrier to use. In this manuscript, the Clinical Care Advisory Board of  the Children's Tumor Foundation reviews the published experience with MEK  inhibitors in NF1 and outlines recommendations for side-effect management, as  well as monitoring guidelines. These recommendations can serve as a beginning  framework for NF providers seeking to provide the most effective treatments for  their patients. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)  clinical care is on the cusp of a transformative shift. With the success of  recent clinical trials using MEK inhibitors, an increasing number of NF1  patients are being treated with MEK inhibitors for both plexiform neurofibromas  and low-grade gliomas. The use of MEK inhibitors is likely to increase  substantially in NF1. Given these changes, the Clinical Care Advisory Board of  the Children's Tumor Foundation has identified a need within the NF1 clinical  community for guidance for the safe and effective use of MEK inhibitors for  NF1-related tumors. This article provides a review of the published experience  of MEK inhibitors in NF1 and provides recommendations for monitoring and  management of side effects.  © 2020 The Authors.

BACKGROUND: Schwannomatosis is a late-onset tumor predisposition syndrome  associated with the development of many different types of malignancies. A  relevant genetic mechanism can be explained by three mutational events. The  first-hit mutation is a germline mutation, and the SMARCB1 mutation on  chromosome 22 is the most well-known genetic abnormality in patients with  schwannomatosis. LZTR1 is another major predisposing gene in 22q-related  schwannomatosis that lacks SMARCB1 variants. Although these two variants account  for the occurrence of most familiar schwannomatoses, the genetic causes of  sporadic schwannomatosis for the most part remain unknown. Therefore, current  molecular diagnostic criteria cannot completely explain the basis of this  disease. The common genetic background between schwannomatosis and other related  malignant tumors is also unclear. Moreover, it is not easy to explain various  clinical manifestations by only two known mutations. QUESTION/PURPOSES: (1) Are  there important sequences outside the SMARCB1 or LZTR1 region on chromosome 22  that might carry a first-hit mutational predisposition to sporadic  schwannomatosis? Or are there alternative evolutionarily conserved loci that  might carry a first-hit mutational predisposition? (2) Is the age of disease  onset associated to such genetic variants? METHODS: This study was a retrospective chart review and prospective genetic  study on patients with schwannomatosis who were treated surgically. The clinical  criteria to diagnose schwannomatosis were as follows: (1) histologically proven  nonvestibular schwannomas; (2) no evidence of vestibular schwannomas on 3-mm  brain MRI. A total of 21 patients were treated between March 2006 and June 2015.  Since nine patients did not visit the outpatient clinic during the recruitment  period, we obtained blood samples from 12 patients with schwannomatosis for a  genetic analysis. After two patients were excluded because of their family  history of schwannomatosis, genetic analyses were finally performed on 10  patients. Then, those with NF2, SMARCB1 or LZTR1 variants were screened by whole  exome sequencing. All 10 patients passed our screening strategy. There were  eight men and two women, with a median (range) age of 43 years (24 to 66) at the  time of diagnosis. To select candidate genes, common ethnic variants and  frequent mutations in in-house exome sequencing data were removed to exclude the  population-specific polymorphisms not found in other population and to  generalize the findings. Frameshift, nonsense, and splice-site variants were  deemed pathogenic. Missense variants were classified as potentially pathogenic,  variants of uncertain significance, or benign using in silico (via computer  simulation) prediction algorithms, Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT),  Polymorphism Phenotyping v2 (PolyPhen-2), and Combined Annotation Dependent  Depletion (CADD). A variant was considered potentially pathogenic if two or more  algorithms predicted the variant to be damaging and benign if none considered it  damaging. Then, potentially pathogenic variants only in the genes associated  with cancer-predisposition or DNA damage repair were classified as the  pathogenic candidate variants of sporadic schwannomatosis. The predictions for  pathogenic candidate variants were checked again on Clinical Interpretation of  Genetic Variants (InterVar) based on the American College of Medical Genetics  guidelines and validated against Mendelian clinically applicable pathogenicity  scores (M-CAP scores). RESULTS: We detected 26 variants; 13 variants across 10 genes were predicted to  be pathogenic and found in seven patients, two each in ARID1A, PTCH2, and NOTCH2  and one each in MSH6, ALPK2, MGMT, NOTCH1, CIC, TSC2, and CDKN2A. One frameshift  deletion in PTCH2 met the criteria for pathogenic or likely pathogenic  classification, as recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics  guidelines. Six missense mutations were classified as possibly pathogenic  variants based on M-CAP scores. Four predicted pathogenic missense variants were  detected in DNA damage repair (DDR) genes. Three DDR genes were affected:  ARID1A, MGMT, and MSH6. Among the nine predicted pathogenic mutations detected  in known cancer-predisposing genes, one was a frameshift deletion and the others  were missense mutations. Seven tumor suppressor genes were involved: PTCH2,  ALPK2, CIC, NOTCH1, NOTCH2, TSC2, and CDKN2A. One patient with multiple  pathogenic variants in two DDR genes, ARID1A and MSH6, received a  schwannomatosis diagnosis at 33 years old. Each of the other patients who had  single variants in the DDR gene received their diagnoses at 41 years of age. The  age at diagnosis was 40 years or older in patients with variants in  cancer-predisposing genes, except for one patient who had multiple variants in  TSC2 and CDKN2A. The carrier of those variants received the diagnosis at 24  years old. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified first-hit candidate mutations predisposing  patients to schwannomatosis that were not related to SMARCB1 or LZTR1 variations  in a cohort of patients with sporadic schwannomatosis. Patients with sporadic  schwannomatosis without SMARCB1 or LZTR1 genetic variation may have developed  the disease because of genomic variants related to cancer initiation in areas  other than chromosome 22. Seven of 10 patients had predicted pathogenic germline  mutations in DDR and cancer predisposition genes. We detected multiple  cancer-related mutations in each patient. The age at the time schwannomatosis  was diagnosed might be associated with a combination of variants and  characteristics of the genes containing the variants; however, we did not have  enough patients to confirm this association. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The germline mutations identified in this study and the  ideas related to the age of disease onset may provide potential candidate  variants for future research on sporadic schwannomatosis and help to revise the  current clinical and molecular diagnostic criteria. Further in vivo and in vitro  studies are needed for these variants.

CONTEXT: Up to 20% of children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) develop  low-grade optic pathway gliomas (OPGs) that can result in endocrine dysfunction.  Data on prevalence and type of endocrine disorders in NF1-related OPGs are  scarce. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of endocrine  dysfunctions in patients with NF1 and OPGs and to investigate predictive factors  before oncological treatment. DESIGN: Multicenter retrospective study. SETTINGS AND PATIENTS: Records were reviewed for 116 children (64 females, 52  males) with NF1 and OPGs followed at 4 Italian centers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We evaluated endocrine function and reviewed brain  imaging at the time of OPG diagnosis before radio- and chemotherapy and/or  surgery. OPGs were classified according to the modified Dodge classification. RESULTS: Thirty-two children (27.6%) with a median age of 7.8 years had  endocrine dysfunctions including central precocious puberty in 23 (71.9%),  growth hormone deficiency in 3 (9.4%), diencephalic syndrome in 4 (12.5%), and  growth hormone hypersecretion in 2 (6.2%). In a multivariate cox regression  analysis, hypothalamic involvement was the only independent predictor of  endocrine dysfunctions (hazard ratio 5.02 [1.802-13.983]; P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Endocrine disorders were found in approximately one-third of  patients with Neurofibromatosis type 1 and OPGs before any oncological  treatment, central precocious puberty being the most prevalent. Sign of  diencephalic syndrome and growth hormone hypersecretion, although rare, could be  predictive of optic pathway gliomas in NF1. Tumor location was the most  important predictor of endocrine disorders, particularly hypothalamic  involvement.  © Endocrine Society 2020. All rights reserved.

BACKGROUND: In this review, we describe how the cytoskeletal protein Merlin,  encoded by the Neurofibromin 2 (NF2) gene, orchestrates developmental signaling  to ensure normal ontogeny, and we discuss how Merlin deficiency leads to  aberrant activation of developmental pathways that enable tumor development and  malignant progression. MAIN BODY: Parallels between embryonic development and cancer have underscored  the activation of developmental signaling pathways. Hippo, WNT/β-catenin, TGF-β,  receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), Notch, and Hedgehog pathways are key players in  normal developmental biology. Unrestrained activity or loss of activity of these  pathways causes adverse effects in developing tissues manifesting as  developmental syndromes. Interestingly, these detrimental events also impact  differentiated and functional tissues. By promoting cell proliferation,  migration, and stem-cell like phenotypes, deregulated activity of these pathways  promotes carcinogenesis and cancer progression. The NF2 gene product, Merlin, is  a tumor suppressor classically known for its ability to induce contact-dependent  growth inhibition. Merlin plays a role in different stages of an organism  development, ranging from embryonic to mature states. While homozygous deletion  of Nf2 in murine embryos causes embryonic lethality, Merlin loss in adult tissue  is implicated in Neurofibromatosis type 2 disorder and cancer. These  manifestations, cumulatively, are reminiscent of dysregulated developmental  signaling. CONCLUSION: Understanding the molecular and cellular repercussions of Merlin  loss provides fundamental insights into the etiology of developmental disorders  and cancer and has the potential, in the long term, to identify new therapeutic  strategies.

Its activity as an energy metabolism regulator has important  implications in cancer, neurodegeneration, and ischemia. Selective inhibitors of  TRAP1 could inform on its mechanisms of action and set the stage for targeted  drug development, but their identification was hampered by the similarity among  active sites in HSP90 homologs. We use a dynamics-based approach to identify a  TRAP1 allosteric pocket distal to its active site that can host drug-like  molecules, and we select small molecules with optimal stereochemical features to  target the pocket. These leads inhibit TRAP1, but not HSP90, ATPase activity and  revert TRAP1-dependent downregulation of succinate dehydrogenase activity in  cancer cells and in zebrafish larvae. TRAP1 inhibitors are not toxic per se, but  they abolish tumorigenic growth of neoplastic cells. Our results indicate that  exploiting conformational dynamics can expand the chemical space of chaperone  antagonists to TRAP1-specific inhibitors with wide therapeutic opportunities.

Cancer research has considerably progressed with the improvement of in vitro  study models, helping to understand the key role of the tumor microenvironment  in cancer development and progression. Over the last few years, complex 3D human  cell culture systems have gained much popularity over in vivo models, as they  accurately mimic the tumor microenvironment and allow high-throughput drug  screening. Of particular interest, in vitrohuman 3D tissue constructs, produced  by the self-assembly method of tissue engineering, have been successfully used  to model the tumor microenvironment and now represent a very promising approach  to further develop diverse cancer models. In this review, we describe the  importance of the tumor microenvironment and present the existing in vitro  cancer models generated through the self-assembly method of tissue engineering.  Lastly, we highlight the relevance of this approach to mimic various and complex  tumors, including basal cell carcinoma, cutaneous neurofibroma, skin melanoma,  bladder cancer, and uveal melanoma.

(2)Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.  Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a common genetic disorder and cancer  predisposition syndrome (1:3000 births) caused by mutations in the tumor  suppressor gene NF1. NF1 encodes neurofibromin, a negative regulator of the Ras  signaling pathway. Individuals with NF1 often develop benign tumors of the  peripheral nervous system (neurofibromas), originating from the Schwann cell  linage, some of which progress further to malignant peripheral nerve sheath  tumors (MPNSTs). Treatment options for neurofibromas and MPNSTs are extremely  limited, relying largely on surgical resection and cytotoxic chemotherapy.  Identification of novel therapeutic targets in both benign neurofibromas and  MPNSTs is critical for improved patient outcomes and quality of life. Recent  clinical trials conducted in patients with NF1 for the treatment of symptomatic  plexiform neurofibromas using inhibitors of the mitogen-activated protein kinase  (MEK) have shown very promising results. However, MEK inhibitors do not work in  all patients and have significant side effects. In addition, preliminary  evidence suggests single agent use of MEK inhibitors for MPNST treatment will  fail. Here, we describe the preclinical efforts that led to the identification  of MEK inhibitors as promising therapeutics for the treatment of NF1-related  neoplasia and possible reasons they lack single agent efficacy in the treatment  of MPNSTs. In addition, we describe work to find targets other than MEK for  treatment of MPNST. These have come from studies of RAS biochemistry, in vitro  drug screening, forward genetic screens for Schwann cell tumors, and synthetic  lethal screens in cells with oncogenic RAS gene mutations. Lastly, we discuss  new approaches to exploit drug screening and synthetic lethality with NF1 loss  of function mutations in human Schwann cells using CRISPR/Cas9 technology.

(2)Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, University Hospital  Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany. (3)Department of Neurology, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg,  Germany.  BACKGROUND/AIM: Plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) are benign tumors of the periph  eral nerves sheath, which can damage neighboring organs, impair functions, cause  pain and serious maxillofacial disfigurement, and have a high risk of malignant  transformation. Complete resection is usually not possible since PNFs often  extend through multiple layers of tissue. Therefore, it is necessary and  beneficial to find a reasonable drug treatment for PNFs. Propranolol-treatment  is the first-line therapy for infantile hemangiomas and the side effects are  reversible and mostly benign. The present study aimed to examine the possible  effect of propranolol for suppressing PNFs in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Paired primary Schwann-cell-rich cultures and  fibroblast-rich cultures were obtained from 4 PNFs of unrelated patients. Human  Schwann cells (HSCs) were used as the control. These cultures were treated with  propranolol for 7 days at concentrations up to 150 μM. Cells were then measured  for their viability and immune-stained with S100 to label the tumorous Schwann  cells. RESULTS: Propranolol inhibited the viability of the tumorous Schwann cells in a  dose-dependent manner, while did not substantially suppress viability of the  non-tumorous fibroblasts derived from the same PNFs. CONCLUSION: Propranolol may provide a treatment option for suppressing the  growth of PNFs.  Copyright© 2020, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

PURPOSE: Evaluate the effectiveness of treatment of patients with optic pathway  glioma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Comparison of literature research on neurofibromatosis  and optic pathway glioma with a cohort of pediatric patients treated at the  Childrens Ophthalmology Clinic of the University Hospital in Brno from January  2013 until June 2018. DISCUSSION: The main challenge of this and other retrospective studies is  variable intervals between ophthalmologic examinations. In some pediatric  patients it is also difficult to objectively assess visual functions. The main  risk factors are age at the time of treatment and tumor localization. Tumor  progression itself does not always correlate with worse visual acuity outcomes,  and it remains to be evaluated whether some patients would be better off without  treatment. As of now, there are no clinical biomarkers able to predict impending  visual acuity loss. CONCLUSION: The cohort outcome agrees with literature. Chemotherapy remains  a treatment of choice and its most likely outcome is visual acuity  stabilization. In order to properly evaluate the treatments effectiveness,  better collaboration between medical specialists and regular standardized  ophthalmology examinations are required.

AIM: To evaluate if autism symptoms and diagnoses are more common in children  with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) than in typically developing children, to  which levels, and to determine if co-occurring attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder (ADHD) symptomatology accounts for this increase. METHOD: We searched hospital electronic medical records (EMR) for International  Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision NF1 and co-occurring diagnoses codes.  We recruited a subsample of 45 children (mean age 9y 2mo; SD 2y 7mo; range  5-12y; 22 males, 23 females) and collected parental reports of autism  symptomatology, adaptive behavior, and behavioral problems that were compared to  those of 360 age- and sex-matched controls from the Simons Simplex Collection  (SSC) with autism spectrum disorder (ASD; SSC-ASD) or typically developing  (SSC-TD). RESULTS: The EMR search identified 968 children with NF1; 8.8% had ADHD and 2.1%  had ASD co-occurring diagnoses. In the subsample, the mean autism scale score  for participants with NF1 was below cut-off for significant autism symptoms.  Participants with NF1 had significantly more autism and behavioral symptoms than  SSC-TD participants, and significantly less than SSC-ASD participants, with one  exception: ADHD symptom levels were similar to those of SSC-ASD participants. In  analyses that controlled for internalizing, ADHD, and communication scores, the  difference in autism symptom levels between participants with NF1 and typically  developing controls disappeared almost entirely. INTERPRETATION: Our results do not support an association between NF1 and  autism, both at the symptom and disorder levels. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Diagnoses of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder  (ADHD) were more common in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) than in  the general child population. Diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder were no more  common in children with NF1 than in the general child population. Increases in  autism symptoms did not reach clinically significant thresholds. Co-occurring  ADHD symptoms accounted for increased autism questionnaire scores. Adaptive  behavior in participants with NF1 showed normal socialization but lower  communication proficiency.  Publisher: OBJETIVO: Evaluar si el diagnóstico y los síntomas de autismo son más  frecuentes en niños con neurofibromatosis tipo 1 (NF1) comparado a niños con  desarrollo típico, cuáles son los niveles de severidad, y determinar si la  sintomatología concurrente debido déficit de atención / hiperactividad (TDAH)  explica la frecuencia. MÉTODO: Se realizaron búsquedas en los registros médicos  electrónicos hospitalarios (EMR) para el diagnóstico de NF1 y códigos  concurrentes en la Clasificación Internacional de Enfermedades, 10ma revisión.  Reclutamos una submuestra de 45 niños (edad promedio 9 años 2 meses; DE 2 años 7  meses; rango 5-12 años; 22 varones y 23 mujeres). Recolectamos informes  parentales acerca de la sintomatología del autismo, comportamiento adaptativo y  problemas de conducta que se compararon con los de 360 niños pareados por edad y  sexo provenientes de la Colección Simons Simplex (SSC) de niños con trastorno  del espectro autista (SSC-ASD) o de niños con desarrollo típico (SSC-TD). RESULTADOS: La búsqueda de EMR identificó a 968 niños con NF1; 8,8% tenían TDAH  y 2,1% tenían diagnósticos concurrentes de trastorno del espectro autista. En la  submuestra de participantes con NF1, la media de puntaje de la escala de autismo  fue inferior punto de corte. Los participantes con NF1 tuvieron  significativamente más síntomas de autismo y problemas de conducta que los  participantes de SSC-TD, y significativamente menos que los participantes de  SSC-ASD. Hubo una excepción: los niveles de síntomas de TDAH fueron similares a  los de los participantes de SSC-ASD. En los análisis que controlaron los  síntomas internalizantes, el TDAH y los puntajes de comunicación, la diferencia  en los niveles de síntomas de autismo entre los participantes con NF1 y los  controles con desarrollo típico desaparecieron casi por completo.  INTERPRETACIÓN: Nuestros resultados no respaldan una asociación entre NF1 y  autismo, tanto a nivel de frecuencia de los síntomas, ni con la severidad de los  mismos.

Electronic address: dwallis@uab.edu.  Significant advances in biotechnology have led to the development of a number of  different mutation-directed therapies. Some of these techniques have matured to  a level that has allowed testing in clinical trials, but few have made it to  approval by drug-regulatory bodies for the treatment of specific diseases. While  there are still various hurdles to be overcome, recent success stories have  proven the potential power of mutation-directed therapies and have fueled the  hope of finding therapeutics for other genetic disorders. In this review, we  summarize the state-of-the-art of various therapeutic approaches and assess  their applicability to the genetic disorder neurofibromatosis type I (NF1). NF1  is caused by the loss of function of neurofibromin, a tumor suppressor and  downregulator of the Ras signaling pathway. The condition is characterized by a  variety of phenotypes and includes symptoms such as skin spots, nervous system  tumors, skeletal dysplasia, and others. Hence, depending on the patient,  therapeutics may need to target different tissues and cell types. While we also  discuss the delivery of therapeutics, in particular via viral vectors and  nanoparticles, our main focus is on therapeutic techniques that reconstitute  functional neurofibromin, most notably cDNA replacement, CRISPR-based DNA  repair, RNA repair, antisense oligonucleotide therapeutics including exon  skipping, and nonsense suppression.

(2)Department of Neurosurgery, Songjiang Hospital Affiliated to the First  People's Hospital Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.  Primary brain tumors are a rare occurrence in comparison to other malignancies,  the most predominant form being glioma. Commonly, exposure to ionizing  radiations and inheritance of associated conditions such a neurofibromatosis and  tuberous sclerosis are the most common causes of development of glioma. However,  understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive glioma development is  limited. We explore the role of aberration of microRNA namely miR-494-3p through  long noncoding RNA WT1-AS in the development of gliomas. In this study, we found  that, levels of WT1-AS were significantly reduced in glioma tissues and cell  lines. The miR-494-3p levels were negatively correlated with WT1-AS levels. The  cellular proliferation and invasiveness decreased in WT1-AS transfected cell  lines. Further the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of  chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide was significantly reduced in the presence of  WT1-AS. The cotransfection of WT1-AS and miR-494-3p reduced activation of  phospho-AKT (p-AKT). Expression of miR-494-3p is modulated by binding to long  noncoding RNA WT1-AS. Deregulation of WT1-AS leads to aberrant expression of  miR-494-3p leading to hyperactivation of AKT. This malformation may result in  altering protective immune responses in malignancies. Targeting of WT1-AS,  miR-494-3p, and AKT may be novel therapeutic options in treatment of glioma.

OBJECTIVES: The objective was to explore the effect of the proneuronal  transcription factor neurogenic differentiation 1 (Neurod1, ND1) on Schwann  cells (SC) and schwannoma cell proliferation. METHODS: Using a variety of transgenic mouse lines, we investigated how  expression of Neurod1 effects medulloblastoma (MB) growth, schwannoma tumor  progression, vestibular function, and SC cell proliferation. Primary human  vestibular schwannoma (VS) cell cultures were transduced with adenoviral vectors  expressing Neurod1. Cell proliferation was assessed by 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine  (EdU) uptake. STUDY DESIGN: Basic science investigation. RESULTS: Expression of Neurod1 reduced the growth of slow-growing but not  fast-growing MB models. Gene transfer of Neurod1 in human schwannoma cultures  significantly reduced cell proliferation in dose-dependent way. Deletion of the  neurofibromatosis type 2 (Nf2) tumor-suppressor gene via Cre expression in SCs  led to increased intraganglionic SC proliferation and mildly reduced vestibular  sensory-evoked potentials (VsEP) responses compared to age-matched wild-type  littermates. The effect of Neurod1-induced expression on intraganglionic SC  proliferation in animals lacking Nf2 was mild and highly variable. Sciatic nerve  axotomy significantly increased SC proliferation in wild-type and Nf2-null  animals, and expression of Neurod1 reduced the proliferative capacity of both  wild-type and Nf2-null SCs following nerve injury. CONCLUSION: Expression of Neurod1 reduces slow-growing MB progression and  reduces human SC proliferation in primary VS cultures. In a genetic mouse model  of schwannomas, we find some effects of Neurod1 expression; however, the high  variability indicates that more tightly regulated Neurod1 expression levels that  mimic our in vitro data are needed to fully validate Neurod1 effects on  schwannoma progression.

Aims: TNF receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1), the mitochondrial paralog of  the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) family of molecular chaperones, is required  for neoplastic growth in several tumor cell models, where it inhibits succinate  dehydrogenase (SDH) activity, thus favoring bioenergetic rewiring, maintenance  of redox homeostasis, and orchestration of a hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha  (HIF1α)-mediated pseudohypoxic program. Development of selective TRAP1  inhibitors is instrumental for targeted development of antineoplastic drugs, but  it has been hampered up to now by the high degree of homology among catalytic  pockets of Hsp90 family members. The vegetal derivative honokiol and its  lipophilic bis-dichloroacetate ester, honokiol DCA (HDCA), are small-molecule  compounds with antineoplastic activity. HDCA leads to oxidative stress and  apoptosis in in vivo tumor models and displays an action that is functionally  opposed to that of TRAP1, as it induces both SDH and the mitochondrial  deacetylase sirtuin-3 (SIRT3), which further enhances SDH activity. We  investigated whether HDCA could interact with TRAP1, inhibiting its chaperone  function, and the effects of HDCA on tumor cells harboring TRAP1. Results: An  allosteric binding site in TRAP1 is able to host HDCA, which inhibits TRAP1 but  not Hsp90 ATPase activity. In neoplastic cells, HDCA reverts TRAP1-dependent  downregulation of SDH, decreases proliferation rate, increases mitochondrial  superoxide levels, and abolishes tumorigenic growth. Innovation: HDCA is a  potential lead compound for the generation of antineoplastic approaches based on  the allosteric inhibition of TRAP1 chaperone activity. Conclusions: We have  identified a selective TRAP1 inhibitor that can be used to better dissect TRAP1  biochemical functions and to tailor novel tumor-targeting strategies.

Schwannomatosis is the third form of neurofibromatosis and characterized by the  occurrence of multiple schwannomas. The most prominent symptom is chronic pain.  We aimed to test whether pain in schwannomatosis might be caused by small-fiber  neuropathy. Twenty patients with schwannomatosis underwent neurological  examination and nerve conduction studies. Levels of pain perception as well as  anxiety and depression were assessed by established questionnaires. Quantitative  sensory testing (QST) and laser-evoked potentials (LEP) were performed on  patients and controls. Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (wbMRI) and  magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) were performed to quantify tumors and  fascicular nerve lesions; skin biopsies were performed to determine  intra-epidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD). All patients suffered from chronic  pain without further neurological deficits. The questionnaires indicated  neuropathic symptoms with significant impact on quality of life. Peripheral  nerve tumors were detected in all patients by wbMRI. MRN showed additional  multiple fascicular nerve lesions in 16/18 patients. LEP showed significant  faster latencies compared to normal controls. Finally, IENFD was significantly  reduced in 13/14 patients. Our study therefore indicates the presence of  small-fiber neuropathy, predominantly of unmyelinated C-fibers. Fascicular nerve  lesions are characteristic disease features that are associated with faster LEP  latencies and decreased IENFD. Together these methods may facilitate  differential diagnosis of schwannomatosis.

Author information: (1)Section for Cell Biology and Physiology, Department of Biology, Faculty of  Science, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.  Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a major cause of cancer-related  death, with a 5-year survival of <10% and severely limited treatment options.  PDAC hallmarks include profound metabolic acid production and aggressive local  proliferation and invasiveness. This phenotype is supported by upregulated net  acid extrusion and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), the latter  typically induced by aberrant transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) signaling. It  is, however, unknown whether TGFβ-induced EMT and upregulation of acid extrusion  are causally related. Here, we show that mRNA and protein expression of the net  acid extruding transporters Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1, SLC9A1) and Na+, HCO 3-  cotransporter 1 (NBCn1, SLC4A7) are increased in a panel of human PDAC cell  lines compared to immortalized human pancreatic ductal epithelial (HPDE) cells.  Treatment of Panc-1 cells (which express SMAD4, required for canonical TGFβ  signaling) with TGFβ-1 for 48 h elicited classical EMT with down- and  upregulation of epithelial and mesenchymal markers, respectively, in a manner  inhibited by SMAD4 knockdown. Accordingly, less pronounced EMT was induced in  BxPC-3 cells, which do not express SMAD4. TGFβ-1 treatment elicited a  SMAD4-dependent increase in NHE1 expression, and a smaller, SMAD4-independent  increase in NBCn1 in Panc-1 cells. Consistent with this, TGFβ-1 treatment led to  elevated intracellular pH and increased net acid extrusion capacity in Panc-1  cells, but not in BxPC-3 cells, in an NHE1-dependent manner. Proliferation was  increased in Panc-1 cells and decreased in BxPC-3 cells, upon TGFβ-1 treatment,  and this, as well as EMT per se, was unaffected by NHE1- or NBCn1 inhibition.  TGFβ-1-induced EMT was associated with a 4-fold increase in Panc-1 cell  invasiveness, which further increased ~10-fold upon knockdown of the tumor  suppressor Merlin (Neurofibromatosis type 2). Knockdown of NHE1 or NBCn1  abolished Merlin-induced invasiveness, but not that induced by TGFβ-1 alone. In  conclusion, NHE1 and NBCn1 expression and NHE-dependent acid extrusion are  upregulated during TGFβ-1-induced EMT of Panc-1 cells. NHE1 upregulation is  SMAD4-dependent, and SMAD4-deficient BxPC-3 cells show no change in pHi  regulation. NHE1 and NBCn1 are not required for EMT per se or EMT-associated  proliferation changes, but are essential for the potentiation of invasiveness  induced by Merlin knockdown.

(#)Contributed equally  High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HG-SOC)-often referred to as a ""silent  killer""-is the most lethal gynecological malignancy. The fallopian tube (murine  oviduct) and ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) are considered the main candidate  tissues of origin of this cancer. However, the relative contribution of each  tissue to HG-SOC is not yet clear. Here, we establish organoid-based tumor  progression models of HG-SOC from murine oviductal and OSE tissues. We use  CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to introduce mutations into genes commonly found  mutated in HG-SOC, such as Trp53, Brca1, Nf1 and Pten. Our results support the  dual origin hypothesis of HG-SOC, as we demonstrate that both epithelia can give  rise to ovarian tumors with high-grade pathology. However, the mutated oviductal  organoids expand much faster in vitro and more readily form malignant tumors  upon transplantation. Furthermore, in vitro drug testing reveals distinct  lineage-dependent sensitivities to the common drugs used to treat HG-SOC in  patients.

Erratum in     J Biol Chem. 2020 Nov 13;295(46):15795. doi: 10.1074/jbc.AAC120.016426.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common cancer predisposition syndrome caused  by mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene. NF1 encodes neurofibromin, a  GTPase-activating protein for RAS proto-oncogene GTPase (RAS). Plexiform  neurofibromas are a hallmark of NF1 and result from loss of heterozygosity of  NF1 in Schwann cells, leading to constitutively activated p21RAS. Given the  inability to target p21RAS directly, here we performed an shRNA library screen  of all human kinases and Rho-GTPases in a patient-derived NF1-/- Schwann cell  line to identify novel therapeutic targets to disrupt PN formation and  progression. Rho family members, including Rac family small GTPase 1 (RAC1),  were identified as candidates. Corroborating these findings, we observed that  shRNA-mediated knockdown of RAC1 reduces cell proliferation and phosphorylation  of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in NF1-/- Schwann cells.  Genetically engineered Nf1flox/flox;PostnCre+ mice, which develop multiple PNs,  also exhibited increased RAC1-GTP and phospho-ERK levels compared with  Nf1flox/flox;PostnCre- littermates. Notably, mice in which both Nf1 and Rac1  loci were disrupted (Nf1flox/floxRac1flox/flox;PostnCre+) were completely free  of tumors and had normal phospho-ERK activity compared with Nf1flox/flox  ;PostnCre+ mice. We conclude that the RAC1-GTPase is a key downstream node of  RAS and that genetic disruption of the Rac1 allele completely prevents PN tumor  formation in vivo in mice.  © 2020 Mund et al.

BACKGROUND: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) constitutes the  leading cause of neurofibromatosis type 1-related mortality. MPNSTs contain  highly rearranged hyperploid genomes and exhibit a high division rate and  aggressiveness. We have studied in vitro whether the mitotic kinesins KIF11,  KIF15, and KIF23 have a functional role in maintaining MPNST cell survival and  can represent potential therapeutic vulnerabilities. METHODS: We studied the expression of kinesin mRNAs and proteins in tumors and  cell lines and used several in vitro functional assays to analyze the impact of  kinesin genetic suppression (KIF15, KIF23) and drug inhibition (KIF11) in MPNST  cells. We also performed in vitro combined treatments targeting KIF11 together  with other described MPNST targets. RESULTS: The studied kinesins were overexpressed in MPNST samples. KIF15 and  KIF23 were required for the survival of MPNST cell lines, which were also more  sensitive than benign control fibroblasts to the KIF11 inhibitors ispinesib and  ARRY-520. Co-targeting KIF11 and BRD4 with ARRY-520 and JQ1 reduced MPNST cell  viability, synergistically killing a much higher proportion of MPNST cells than  control fibroblasts. In addition, genetic suppression of KIF15 conferred an  increased sensitivity to KIF11 inhibitors alone or in combination with JQ1. CONCLUSIONS: The mitotic spindle kinesins KIF11 and KIF15 and the cytokinetic  kinesin KIF23 play a clear role in maintaining MPNST cell survival and may  represent potential therapeutic vulnerabilities. Although further in vivo  evidences are still mandatory, we propose a simultaneous suppression of KIF11,  KIF15, and BRD4 as a potential therapy for MPNSTs.  © The Author(s) 2020.

BACKGROUND: Cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs) are the most common tumors in people  with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and are associated with reduced quality of  life. There is currently no widely accepted standardized language for describing  cNFs clinically or histopathologically. The objective of this study was to  evaluate interobserver agreement across pathologists in describing and reporting  of neurofibromas involving the skin. METHODS: Twenty-eight (H&E)-stained slides of cNF were scanned using an Aperio  XT scanner. The digital images were reviewed by 6 pathologists, who entered free  text of up to a 200 word description for each case into a REDcap database.  Responses were analyzed for the most commonly used terms based on frequency, as  well as agreement (reported as concordance) between reviewers. RESULTS: A set of the terms most commonly used by pathologists for the  histological classification of cNF along with areas of agreement and  disagreement have been identified. The study shows that there was strong  agreement across reviewers that not all neurofibromas involving the skin are  cutaneous neurofibromas and regarding the presence or absence of atypical  features and heterologous elements. Areas of less concordance were identified  and include cNF subtypes, definition of extension and pattern of growth, as well  as the distinction of a cNF from a plexiform without an intraneural component  involving skin. CONCLUSIONS: This work is the first step towards development of a robust  classification system and devising ""gold standard"" histopathologic diagnostic  criteria for cutaneous neurofibromas.  © The Author(s) 2019.

Gross AM(1), Widemann BC(1).  Author information: (1)Pediatric Oncology Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of  Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.  Up to 10% of all pediatric cancer patients may have an underlying germline  mutation which predisposed them to develop a malignancy. With more patients  being tested for and diagnosed with genetic tumor predisposition syndromes,  there has been improved characterization of their many nonmalignant  manifestations. However, designing and implementing clinical trials to treat the  nonmalignant tumor and non-tumor manifestations of these syndromes poses many  unique challenges. Unlike trials for malignancies where tumor response and  survival can be used as straightforward trial endpoints, the nonmalignant  manifestations are often chronic, evolve more slowly over time, and may not be  immediately life-threatening. Therefore, they will likely require a different  approach to both testing and treatment with a focus on more functional and  patient-reported outcome trial endpoints. The recent success of treatment trials  for the benign tumors plexiform neurofibromas in the tumor predisposition  syndrome neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) can be used as a model for the  development of clinical trials in other tumor predisposition syndromes. In this  article, we review the unique challenges associated with targeting the  nonmalignant aspects of these conditions as well as some of the lessons learned  from the NF1 experience which may be applied to other syndromes in the future.

BACKGROUND: There is scarce data on the quality of life of people with  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and type 2 (NF2) in Canada. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of adults with NF1 and NF2 attending a tertiary  center. Patients completed generic measures (SF-36, EQ-5D-5L, and PROMIS pain  interference) and disease-specific questionnaires (PedsQL NF1 module and the  NFTI-QOL for NF2). We compared generic scores between NF1 and NF2 individuals  and used regression models to assess factors associated with quality of life. RESULTS: Hundred and eighty-four participants were enrolled. Mean age was 33  years in NF1 and 40 years in NF2. NF1 and NF2 individuals had lower employment  rates and lower scores in all domains of the SF-36 compared to the general  Canadian population (P < .005). Using the EQ-5D-5L, there was a high proportion  of pain (64% in NF1 and 74% in NF2) and anxiety/depression (60% in NF1 and 68%  in NF2). Pain interference correlated with poor quality of life in NF1 and NF2;  perceived physical appearance was the main predictor of mental well-being in  NF1. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with NF1 and NF2 have low quality of life, and this  correlates with pain, anxiety, and depression, which are prevalent in NF1 and  NF2. Perceived physical appearance predicts quality of life in NF1. A  multidisciplinary approach is necessary for patients with NF1 and NF2, including  mental health and pain management.  © The Author(s) 2020.

(#)Contributed equally  Recent characterization of spatiotemporal genomic architecture of IDH-wild-type  multifocal glioblastomas (M-GBMs) suggests a clinically unobserved  common-ancestor (CA) with a less aggressive phenotype, generating highly  genetically divergent malignant gliomas/GBMs in distant brain regions. Using  serial MRI/3D-reconstruction, whole-genome sequencing and spectral  karyotyping-based single-cell phylogenetic tree building, we show two distinct  types of tumor evolution in p53-mutant driven mouse models. Malignant  gliomas/GBMs grow as a single mass (Type 1) and multifocal masses (Type 2),  respectively, despite both exhibiting loss of Pten/chromosome 19 (chr19) and  PI3K/Akt activation with sub-tetraploid/4N genomes. Analysis of early biopsied  and multi-segment tumor tissues reveals no evidence of less proliferative  diploid/2N lesions in Type 1 tumors. Strikingly, CA-derived relatively quiescent  tumor precursors with ancestral diploid/2N genomes and normal Pten/chr19 are  observed in the subventricular zone (SVZ), but are distantly segregated from  multi focal Type 2 tumors. Importantly, PI3K/Akt inhibition by Rictor/mTORC2  deletion blocks distant dispersal, restricting glioma growth in the SVZ.

Neurofibromatosis Type 2- (NF2-) associated vestibular schwannomas (VSs) are  histologically benign tumors. This study aimed to determine disease-related  genes, pathways, and potential therapeutic drugs associated with NF2-VSs using  the bioinformatics method. Microarray data of GSE108524 were downloaded from the  Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and differentially expressed genes  (DEGs) were screened using GEO2R. The functional enrichment and pathway  enrichment of DEGs were performed using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto  Encyclopedia of Genes Genomes (KEGG). Furthermore, the STRING and Cytoscape were  used to analyze the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of all  differentially expressed genes and identify hub genes. Finally, the enriched  gene sets belonging to the identified pathways were queried against the  Drug-Gene Interaction database to find drug candidates for topical use in  NF2-associated VSs. A total of 542 DEGs were identified, including 13  upregulated and 329 downregulated genes, which were mainly enriched in terms of  focal adhesion, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, ECM-receptor interaction, Toll-like  receptor signaling pathway, Rap1 signaling pathway, and regulation of actin  cytoskeleton. 28 hub genes were identified based on the subset of PPI network,  and 31 drugs were selected based on the Drug-Gene Interaction database. Drug  discovery using bioinformatics methods facilitates the identification of  existing or potential therapeutic drugs to improve NF2 treatment.  Copyright © 2020 Qiao Huang et al.

Electronic address: bstansfield@augusta.edu.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a heritable cancer predisposition syndrome  resulting from mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene. Genotype-phenotype  correlations for NF1 are rare due to the large number of NF1 mutations and role  of modifier genes in manifestations of NF1; however, emerging reports suggest  that persons with NF1 display a distinct anthropometric and metabolic phenotype  featuring short stature, low body mass index, increased insulin sensitivity, and  protection from diabetes. Nf1 heterozygous (Nf1+/-) mice accurately reflect the  dominant inheritance of NF1 and are regularly employed as a model of NF1. Here,  we sought to identify whether Nf1+/- mice recapitulate the anthropometric and  metabolic features identified in persons with NF1. Littermate 16-20 week-old  male wildtype (WT) and Nf1+/- C57B/6J mice underwent nuclear magnetic resonance  (NMR), indirect calorimetry, and glucose/insulin/pyruvate tolerance testing. In  some experiments, tissues were harvested for NMR and histologic  characterization. Nf1+/- mice are leaner with significantly reduced visceral and  subcutaneous fat mass, which corresponds with an increased density of small  adipocytes and reduced leptin levels. Additionally, Nf1+/- mice are highly  reliant on carbohydrates as an energy substrate and display increased glucose  clearance and insulin sensitivity, but normal response to pyruvate suggesting  enhanced glucose utilization and preserved gluconeogenesis. Finally, WT and  Nf1+/- mice subjected to high glucose diet were protected from diet-induced  obesity and hyperglycemia. Our data suggest that Nf1+/- mice closely  recapitulate the anthropometric and metabolic phenotype identified in persons  with NF1, which will impact the interpretation of previous and future  translational studies of NF1.

Aronson PJ(1), Ito K, Fukaya T, Hashimoto K, Mehregan AH.  Author information: (1)Department of Dermatology and Syphilology, Wayne State University School of  Medicine, Detroit, Michigan 48201.  The mouse monoclonal antibody AFH1 was produced using formalin-fixed, sham  paraffin-embedded human melanoma cell culture line A375 as immunogen. Reactivity  of this antibody was assessed by immunohistochemical techniques against  formalin- or acid alcohol-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue as well as formalin- or  acid alcohol-fixed unembedded lesions. Ninety-seven nevomelanocytic lesions,  neurofibromas, epithelial lesions, and a plasmacellular infiltrate were  evaluated. AFH1 was immunoreactive on 54 of 55 nevocytic lesions (98.2%), 15 of  16 primary melanomas (93.7%), a lentigo maligna, and nests in 21 of 21  dysplastic nevi (100%). Of 100 consecutive basal melanocytes of intraepidermal  melanoma cells counted in each lesion, mean AFH1 immunoreactivity for nonnested  basal melanocytes in nevocellular nevi was 3.8%; for dysplastic nevi, 13.8%; and  for intraepidermal melanoma cells, 78.0%. When nonnested basal melanocytes were  subdivided into cytologically normal and abnormal cell groups, AFH1  immunoreactivity was 9.4% and 72.6%, respectively. AFH1 recognition of the  lentiginous portion of dysplastic nevi corresponds statistically to the  appearance of abnormal melanocyte cytology, nest formation, or both. Using 50%  immunoreactive nonnested melanocytes as the criterion, AFH1 seems to distinguish  primary melanoma from dysplastic nevi with a sensitivity of 93.8% and a  specificity of 95.8%.

Neurofibromin gene (NF1) mutation causes neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a  disorder in which brain white matter deficits identified by neuroimaging are  common, yet of unknown cellular etiology. In mice, Nf1 loss in adult  oligodendrocytes causes myelin decompaction and increases oligodendrocyte nitric  oxide (NO) levels. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors rescue this pathology.  Whether oligodendrocyte pathology is sufficient to affect brain-wide structure  and account for NF1 imaging findings is unknown. Here we show that Nf1 gene  inactivation in adult oligodendrocytes (Plp-Nf1fl/+ mice) results in a motor  coordination deficit. Magnetic resonance imaging in awake mice showed that  fractional anisotropy is reduced in Plp-Nf1fl/+ corpus callosum and that  interhemispheric functional connectivity in the motor cortex is also reduced,  consistent with disrupted myelin integrity. Furthermore, NOS-specific inhibition  rescued both measures. These results suggest that oligodendrocyte defects  account for aspects of brain dysfunction in NF1 that can be identified by  neuroimaging and ameliorated by NOS inhibition.

Neurofibromatosis type (NF1) is a syndrome characterized by varied symptoms,  ranging from mild to more aggressive phenotypes. The variation is not explained  only by genetic and epigenetic changes in the NF1 gene and the concept of  phenotype-modifier genes in extensively discussed in an attempt to explain this  variability. Many datasets and tools are already available to explore the  relationship between genetic variation and disease, including systems biology  and expression data. To suggest potential NF1 modifier genes, we selected  proteins related to NF1 phenotype and NF1 gene ontologies. Protein-protein  interaction (PPI) networks were assembled, and network statistics were obtained  by using forward and reverse genetics strategies. We also evaluated the  heterogeneous networks comprising the phenotype ontologies selected, gene  expression data, and the PPI network. Finally, the hypothesized  phenotype-modifier genes were verified by a random-walk mathematical model. The  network statistics analyses combined with the forward and reverse genetics  strategies, and the assembly of heterogeneous networks, resulted in ten  potential phenotype-modifier genes: AKT1, BRAF, EGFR, LIMK1, PAK1, PTEN, RAF1,  SDC2, SMARCA4, and VCP. Mathematical models using the random-walk approach  suggested SDC2 and VCP as the main candidate genes for phenotype-modifiers.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a tumor-predisposition disorder  that arises due to pathogenic variants in tumor suppressor NF1. NF1 has variable  expressivity that may be due, at least in part, from heritable elements such as  modifier genes; however, few genetic modifiers have been identified to date. METHODS: In this study, we performed a genome-wide association analysis of the  number of café-au-lait macules (CALM) that are considered a tumor-like trait as  a clinical phenotype modifying NF1. RESULTS: A borderline genome-wide significant association was identified in the  discovery cohort (CALM1, N = 112) between CALM number and rs12190451 (and  rs3799603, r2  = 1.0; p = 7.4 × 10-8 ) in the intronic region of RPS6KA2.  Although, this association was not replicated in the second cohort (CALM2,  N = 59) and a meta-analysis did not show significantly associated variants in  this region, a significant corroboration score (0.72) was obtained for the  RPS6KA2 signal in the discovery cohort (CALM1) using Complementary Pairs  Stability Selection for Genome-Wide Association Studies (ComPaSS-GWAS) analysis,  suggesting that the lack of replication may be due to heterogeneity of the  cohorts rather than type I error. CONCLUSION: rs12190451 is located in a melanocyte-specific enhancer and may  influence RPS6KA2 expression in melanocytes-warranting further functional  studies.  © Published 2020.

BACKGROUND: Anticancer compound 3-bromopyruvate (3-BrPA) suppresses cancer cell  growth via targeting glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism. The malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), a very aggressive, therapy resistant, and  Neurofibromatosis type 1 associated neoplasia, shows a high metabolic activity  and affected patients may therefore benefit from 3-BrPA treatment. To elucidate  the specific mode of action, we used a controlled cell model overexpressing  proteasome activator (PA) 28, subsequently leading to p53 inactivation and  oncogenic transformation and therefore reproducing an important pathway in MPNST  and overall tumor pathogenesis. METHODS: Viability of MPNST cell lines S462, NSF1, and T265 in response to  increasing doses (0-120 μM) of 3-BrPA was analyzed by CellTiter-Blue® assay.  Additionally, we investigated viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS)  production (dihydroethidium assay), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide  dehydrogenase activity (NADH-TR assay) and lactate production (lactate assay) in  mouse B8 fibroblasts overexpressing PA28 in response to 3-BrPA application. For  all experiments normal and nutrient deficient conditions were tested. MPNST cell  lines were furthermore characterized immunohistochemically for Ki67, p53, bcl2,  bcl6, cyclin D1, and p21. RESULTS: MPNST significantly responded dose dependent to 3-BrPA application,  whereby S462 cells were most responsive. Human control cells showed a reduced  sensitivity. In PA28 overexpressing cancer cell model 3-BrPA application harmed  mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase activity mildly and significantly failed to  inhibit lactate production. PA28 overexpression was associated with a functional  glycolysis as well as a partial resistance to stress provoked by nutrient  deprivation. 3-BrPA treatment was not associated with an increase of ROS.  Starvation sensitized MPNST to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive MPNST cells are sensitive to 3-BrPA therapy in-vitro  with and without starvation. In a PA28 overexpression cancer cell model leading  to p53 inactivation, thereby reflecting a key molecular feature in human NF1  associated MPNST, known functions of 3-BrPA to block mitochondrial activity and  glycolysis were reproduced, however oncogenic cells displayed a partial  resistance. To conclude, 3-BrPA was sufficient to reduce NF1 associated MPNST  viability potentially due inhibition of glycolysis which should lead to the  initiation of further studies and promises a potential benefit for NF1 patients.

Loss of the RAS GTPase-activating protein (RAS-GAP) NF1 drives aberrant  activation of RAS/MEK/ERK signaling and other effector pathways in the majority  of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). These dysregulated pathways  represent potential targets for therapeutic intervention. However, studies of  novel single agents including MEK inhibitors (MEKi) have demonstrated limited  efficacy both preclinically and clinically, with little advancement in overall  patient survival. By interrogation of kinome activity through an unbiased screen  and targeted evaluation of the signaling response to MEK inhibition, we have  identified global activation of upstream receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) that  converges on activation of RAS as a mechanism to limit sensitivity to MEK  inhibition. As no direct inhibitors of pan-RAS were available, an inhibitor of  the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, a critical mediator of RAS signal  transduction downstream of multiple RTK, represented an alternate strategy. The  combination of MEKi plus SHP099 was superior to MEKi alone in models of  NF1-MPNST, including those with acquired resistance to MEKi. Our findings have  immediate translational implications and may inform future clinical trials for  patients with MPNST harboring alterations in NF1. SIGNIFICANCE: Combined  inhibition of MEK and SHP2 is effective in models of NF1-MPNST, both those naïve  to and those resistant to MEKi, as well as in the MPNST precursor lesion  plexiform neurofibroma.  ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a multi-organ disease caused by  mutations in neurofibromin 1 (NF1). Amongst other features, NF1 patients  frequently show reduced muscle mass and strength, impairing patients' mobility  and increasing the risk of fall. The role of Nf1 in muscle and the cause for the  NF1-associated myopathy are mostly unknown. METHODS: To dissect the function of Nf1 in muscle, we created muscle-specific  knockout mouse models for NF1, inactivating Nf1 in the prenatal myogenic lineage  either under the Lbx1 promoter or under the Myf5 promoter. Mice were analysed  during prenatal and postnatal myogenesis and muscle growth. RESULTS: Nf1Lbx1 and Nf1Myf5 animals showed only mild defects in prenatal  myogenesis. Nf1Lbx1 animals were perinatally lethal, while Nf1Myf5 animals  survived only up to approximately 25 weeks. A comprehensive phenotypic  characterization of Nf1Myf5 animals showed decreased postnatal growth, reduced  muscle size, and fast fibre atrophy. Proteome and transcriptome analyses of  muscle tissue indicated decreased protein synthesis and increased proteasomal  degradation, and decreased glycolytic and increased oxidative activity in muscle  tissue. High-resolution respirometry confirmed enhanced oxidative metabolism in  Nf1Myf5 muscles, which was concomitant to a fibre type shift from type 2B to  type 2A and type 1. Moreover, Nf1Myf5 muscles showed hallmarks of decreased  activation of mTORC1 and increased expression of atrogenes. Remarkably, loss of  Nf1 promoted a robust activation of AMPK with a gene expression profile  indicative of increased fatty acid catabolism. Additionally, we observed a  strong induction of genes encoding catabolic cytokines in muscle Nf1Myf5  animals, in line with a drastic reduction of white, but not brown adipose  tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate a cell autonomous role for Nf1 in myogenic  cells during postnatal muscle growth required for metabolic and proteostatic  homeostasis. Furthermore, Nf1 deficiency in muscle drives cross-tissue  communication and mobilization of lipid reserves.  © 2020 The Authors.

BACKGROUND: Brain tumors are the most common solid tumors of childhood, but  little is understood about the factors that influence their development.  Pediatric low-grade gliomas in particular display unique temporal and spatial  localization associated with different genetic mutations (eg, BRAF genomic  alterations, mutations in the neurofibromatosis type 1 [NF1] gene) for reasons  that remain unclear. NF1 low-grade gliomas typically arise in the optic pathway  of young children as optic pathway gliomas (OPGs), likely from a cell of origin  that resides within the third ventricular zone (TVZ). However, the factors that  contribute to their distinct temporal patterning and penetrance have not been  adequately explored. METHODS: TVZ neuroglial progenitor cells (NPCs) were analyzed over the course of  mouse brain development. Progenitors isolated by fluorescence-activated cell  sorting (FACS) were assessed for functional and molecular differences. The  impact of different germline Nf1 mutations on TVZ NPC properties was analyzed  using genetically engineered mice. RESULTS: We identify 3 individual factors that could each contribute to Nf1  optic glioma temporal patterning and penetrance. First, there are 3 functionally  and molecularly distinct populations of mouse TVZ NPCs, one of which (""M"" cells)  exhibits the highest clonogenic incidence, proliferation, and abundance during  embryogenesis. Second, TVZ NPC proliferation dramatically decreases after birth.  Third, germline Nf1 mutations differentially increase TVZ NPC proliferation  during embryogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: The unique temporal patterning and penetrance of Nf1 optic glioma  reflects the combined effects of TVZ NPC population composition, time-dependent  changes in progenitor proliferation, and the differential impact of the germline  Nf1 mutation on TVZ NPC expansion.  © The Author(s) 2020.

We assessed the accuracy of semi-automated tumor volume maps of plexiform  neurofibroma (PN) generated by a deep neural network, compared to manual  segmentation using diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data. NF1 Patients were  recruited from a phase II clinical trial for the treatment of PN. Multiple  b-value DWI was imaged over the largest PN. All DWI datasets were registered and  intensity normalized prior to segmentation with a multi-spectral neural network  classifier (MSNN). Manual volumes of PN were performed on 3D-T2 images  registered to diffusion images and compared to MSNN volumes with the  Sørensen-Dice coefficient. Intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) parameters were  calculated from resulting volumes. 35 MRI scans were included from 14 subjects.  Sørensen-Dice coefficient between the semi-automated and manual segmentation was  0.77 ± 0.016. Perfusion fraction (f) was significantly higher for tumor versus  normal tissue (0.47 ± 0.42 vs. 0.30 ± 0.22, p = 0.02), similarly, true diffusion  (D) was significantly higher for PN tumor versus normal (0.0018 ± 0.0003 vs.  0.0012 ± 0.0002, p < 0.0001). By contrast, the pseudodiffusion coefficient (D*)  was significantly lower for PN tumor versus normal (0.024 ± 0.01 vs.  0.031 ± 0.005, p < 0.0001). Volumes generated by a neural network from multiple  diffusion data on PNs demonstrated good correlation with manual volumes. IVIM  analysis of multiple b-value diffusion data demonstrates significant differences  between PN and normal tissue.

BACKGROUND: To develop and validate a patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure of  quality of life (QoL), specific to patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 1  (NF1)-associated plexiform neurofibromas (pNFs), suitable for use in clinical  efficacy trials. The study was conducted in parallel in the UK and US. METHODS: Qualitative interviews were conducted with patients to generate  questionnaire content. Face and content validity of the draft scale was assessed  by cognitive debriefing interviews (CDIs). A postal validation survey was  conducted to identify the final version of the questionnaire (the PlexiQoL),  establish its unidimensionality, and assess its psychometric properties. RESULTS: Thematic analysis was performed on 42 interview transcripts. Thirty-one  CDIs revealed that patients found the draft scale to be comprehensible,  relevant, and easy to complete. The postal validation survey was completed by  273 patients. Rasch analysis identified an 18-item unidimensional scale that  showed excellent internal consistency, reproducibility, and sensitivity to  differences in patient-perceived pNF severity, general health, and the use of  pain medication. CONCLUSIONS: The PlexiQoL is the first disease-specific PRO assessing the  ability of adults with NF-1 associated pNFs to meet their basic human needs.  Clinical trials are planned to assess the sensitivity to change of the PlexiQoL  in people undergoing treatment for pNFs.  © 2020 The Authors.

Plexiform neurofibromas (pNFs) are benign tumors of the peripheral nervous  system (PNS) that can progress towards a deadly soft tissue sarcoma termed  malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). pNFs appear during development  in the context of the genetic disease Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) due to the  complete loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene in a cell of the neural crest  (NC) - Schwann cell (SC) axis of differentiation. NF1(-/-) cells from pNFs can  be reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that exhibit an  increased proliferation rate and maintain full iPSC properties. Efficient  protocols for iPSC differentiation towards NC and SC exist and thus NC cells can  be efficiently obtained from NF1(-/-) iPSCs and further differentiated towards  SCs. In this review, we will focus on the iPSC modeling of pNFs, including the  reprogramming of primary pNF-derived cells, the properties of pNF-derived iPSCs,  the capacity to differentiate towards the NC-SC lineage, and how well  iPSC-derived NF1(-/-) SC spheroids recapitulate pNF-derived primary SCs. The  potential uses of NF1(-/-) iPSCs in pNF modeling and a future outlook are  discussed.  Copyright © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

INTRODUCTION: Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a rare, progressive and  incurable genetic disorder associated with progressive hearing loss and eventual  deafness. As a group, patients with NF report high levels of stress and  depressive symptoms. However, no studies have explored improvement in these  symptoms after psychosocial interventions. We have previously shown that a  mind-body program tailored to adults with NF2 who are deaf (the Relaxation  Response and Resiliency Program for Deaf NF2, d3RP-NF2) improves quality of life  and resiliency over and above a Health Enhancement program when both are  delivered via live-video and assisted by Communication Access Realtime  Translation (CART). Here we tested the effects of the programs on depression and  perceived stress. METHODS: Forty-five patients with NF2 and significant hearing loss were  randomized to the d3RP-NF2 or Health-Enhancement program and completed measures  of depression (PHQ-9) and perceived stress (PSS-10) at baseline,  post-intervention, and six-month follow-up. RESULTS: Patients randomized to the d3RP-NF2 program, but not to the control  condition, experienced significant decreases on both measures from baseline to  post-test, which were maintained at follow-up (within group tests). However,  improvements following the d3RP-NF2 program was not significantly higher than  those observed in the control group (between group tests). CONCLUSION: Results provide the first evidence of improvement in symptoms of  depression and perceived stress among deaf patients living with NF2 who  participate in a virtual mind-body program.

Meningiomas (MNs), arising from the arachnoid/meningeal layer, are nonresponsive  to chemotherapies, with ∼50% showing loss of the Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) tumor  suppressor gene. Previously, we established NF2 loss activates mechanistic  target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and mechanistic target of rapamycin  complex 2 (mTORC2) signaling, leading to clinical trials for NF2 and MN.  Recently our omics studies identified activated ephrin (EPH) receptor and Src  family kinases upon NF2 loss. Here, we report increased expression of several  ligands in NF2-null human arachnoidal cells (ACs) and the MN cell line  Ben-Men-1, particularly neuregulin-1/heregulin (NRG1), and confirm increased  NRG1 secretion and activation of V-ERB-B avian erythroblastic leukemia viral  oncogene homolog 3 (ERBB3) receptor kinase. Conditioned-medium from NF2-null ACs  or exogenous NRG1 stimulated ERBB3, EPHA2, and mTORC1/2 signaling, suggesting  pathway crosstalk. NF2-null cells treated with an ERBB3-neutralizing antibody  partially downregulated mTOR pathway activation but showed no effect on  viability. mTORC1/2 inhibitor treatment decreased NRG1 expression and  downregulated ERBB3 while re-activating pAkt T308, suggesting a mechanism  independent of NRG1-ERBB3 but likely involving activation of another upstream  receptor kinase. Transcriptomics after mTORC1/2 inhibition confirmed decreased  ERBB3/ERBB4 while revealing increased expression of insulin-like growth factor  receptor 1 (IGF1R). Drug treatment co-targeting mTORC1/2 and IGF1R/insulin  receptor attenuated pAkt T308 and showed synergistic effects on viability. Our  findings indicate potential autocrine signaling where NF2 loss leads to  secretion/activation of NRG1-ERBB3 signaling. mTORC1/2 inhibition downregulates  NRG1-ERBB3, while upregulating pAkt T308 through an adaptive response involving  IGF1R/insulin receptor and co-targeting these pathways may prove effective for  treatment of NF2-deficient MN.

The molecular pathogenesis of glioblastoma indicates that RTK/Ras/PI3K, RB and  TP53 pathways are critical for human gliomagenesis. Here, several transgenic  zebrafish lines with single or multiple deletions of nf1, tp53 and rb1 in  astrocytes, were established to genetically induce gliomagenesis in zebrafish.  In the mutant with a single deletion, we found only the nf1 mutation  low-efficiently induced tumour incidence, suggesting that the Nf1 pathway is  critical for the initiation of gliomagenesis in zebrafish. Combination of  mutations, nf1;tp53 and rb1;tp53 combined knockout fish, showed much higher  tumour incidences, high-grade histology, increased invasiveness, and shortened  survival time. Further bioinformatics analyses demonstrated the alterations in  RTK/Ras/PI3K, cell cycle, and focal adhesion pathways, induced by abrogated nf1,  tp53, or rb1, were probably the critical stepwise biological events for the  initiation and development of gliomagenesis in zebrafish. Gene expression  profiling and histological analyses showed the tumours derived from zebrafish  have significant similarities to the subgroups of human gliomas. Furthermore,  temozolomide treatment effectively suppressed gliomagenesis in these glioma  zebrafish models, and the histological responses in temozolomide-treated  zebrafish were similar to those observed in clinically treated glioma patients.  Thus, our findings will offer a potential tool for genetically investigating  gliomagenesis and screening potential targeted anti-tumour compounds for glioma  treatment.  © The Author(s) (2020).

The optic pathway glioma (OPG) is a slow-growing brain tumor that arises along  the optic nerve or its downstream connections and causing vision to gradually  worsen with time. This tumor forms in children with a genetic condition called  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), causing tumors to grow on nerves. In normal  conditions, glial cells are there to support and protect nerve cells but, in  NF1-OPG, glial cells have a genetic defect and grow out of control forming a  tumor called a glioma. There are no rat models of NF1-OPG that can be used to  explore various treatment options, and mouse models make interventional studies  difficult due to their small eye size. We have created a model in which to study  the progression of tumor growth in the optic nerve and establish the anatomical  and functional consequences of the model and determine its suitability to serve  as a surrogate for human disease. C6 rat glioma cells were injected into the  optic nerve of Long-Evans rats and allowed to proliferate for 2 weeks. The eye  clearly showed proptosis and lens opacity was observed, likely due to increased  intraocular pressure caused by growing tumors. Hematoxylin-eosin staining showed  marked cellularity, with hyperchromatism and pleomorphism. There was prominent  area of necrosis with neoplastic cells palisading around the penumbra.  Immunostaining with markers such as S100, β-tubulin III, Foxp3, CD45, Vimentin,  and Ki67 confirmed low-grade tumor formation, with a mild immune response. Our  results show the utility of a surgically induced rat model of OPG that may be  used for exploring various treatment options for NF1 ocular tumors.

Neurofibromatosis Type I (NF1) is a neurocutaneous genetic syndrome  characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, including benign  peripheral nerve sheath tumor called neurofibroma. These tumors originate from  the Schwann cell lineage but other cell types as well as extracellular matrix  (ECM) in the neurofibroma microenvironment constitute the majority of the tumor  mass. In fact, collagen accounts for up to 50% of the neurofibroma's dry weight.  Although the presence of collagens in neurofibroma is indisputable, the exact  repertoire of ECM genes and ECM-associated genes (i.e. the matrisome) and their  functions are unknown. Here, transcriptome profiling by single-cell RNA  sequencing reveals the matrisome of human cutaneous neurofibroma (cNF). We  discovered that classic pro-fibrogenic collagen I myofibroblasts are rare in  neurofibroma. In contrast, collagen VI, a pro-tumorigenic ECM, is abundant and  mainly secreted by neurofibroma fibroblasts. This study also identified  potential cell type-specific markers to further elucidate the biology of the cNF  microenvironment.

Matt.Steensma@vai.org.  Benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors are the clinical hallmark of  Neurofibromatosis Type 1. They account for substantial morbidity and mortality  in NF1. Cutaneous (CNF) and plexiform neurofibromas (PNF) share nearly identical  histology, but maintain different growth rates and risk of malignant conversion.  The reasons for this disparate clinical behavior are not well explained by  recent genome or transcriptome profiling studies. We hypothesized that CNFs and  PNFs are epigenetically distinct tumor types that exhibit differential signaling  due to genome-wide and site-specific methylation events. We interrogated the  methylation profiles of 45 CNFs and 17 PNFs from NF1 subjects with the Illumina  EPIC 850K methylation array. Based on these profiles, we confirm that CNFs and  PNFs are epigenetically distinct tumors with broad differences in higher-order  chromatin states and specific methylation events altering genes involved in key  biological and cellular processes, such as inflammation, RAS/MAPK signaling,  actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, and oxytocin signaling. Based on our  identification of two separate DMRs associated with alternative leading exons in  MAP2K3, we demonstrate differential RAS/MKK3/p38 signaling between CNFs and  PNFs. Epigenetic reinforcement of RAS/MKK/p38 was a defining characteristic of  CNFs leading to pro-inflammatory signaling and chromatin conformational changes,  whereas PNFs signaled predominantly through RAS/MEK. Tumor size also correlated  with specific CpG methylation events. Taken together, these findings confirm  that NF1 deficiency influences the epigenetic regulation of RAS signaling fates,  accounting for observed differences in CNF and PNF clinical behavior. The  extension of these findings is that CNFs may respond differently than PNFs to  RAS-targeted therapeutics raising the possibility of targeting p38-mediated  inflammation for CNF treatment.

(#)Contributed equally  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) are progressive,  multicellular neoplasms that cause morbidity and may transform to sarcoma.  Treatment of Nf1fl/fl;Postn-Cre mice with cabozantinib, an inhibitor of multiple  tyrosine kinases, caused a reduction in PN size and number and differential  modulation of kinases in cell lineages that drive PN growth. Based on these  findings, the Neurofibromatosis Clinical Trials Consortium conducted a phase II,  open-label, nonrandomized Simon two-stage study to assess the safety, efficacy  and biologic activity of cabozantinib in patients ≥16 years of age with NF1 and  progressive or symptomatic, inoperable PN ( NCT02101736 ). The trial met its  primary outcome, defined as ≥25% of patients achieving a partial response (PR,  defined as ≥20% reduction in target lesion volume as assessed by magnetic  resonance imaging (MRI)) after 12 cycles of therapy. Secondary outcomes included  adverse events (AEs), patient-reported outcomes (PROs) assessing pain and  quality of life (QOL), pharmacokinetics (PK) and the levels of circulating  endothelial cells and cytokines. Eight of 19 evaluable (42%) trial participants  achieved a PR. The median change in tumor volume was 15.2% (range, +2.2% to  -36.9%), and no patients had disease progression while on treatment. Nine  patients required dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy due to AEs;  common AEs included gastrointestinal toxicity, hypothyroidism, fatigue and  palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia. A total of 11 grade 3 AEs occurred in eight  patients. Patients with PR had a significant reduction in tumor pain intensity  and pain interference in daily life but no change in global QOL scores. These  data indicate that cabozantinib is active in NF1-associated PN, resulting in  tumor volume reduction and pain improvement.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant syndrome whose  characteristic manifestations include benign neurofibromas, yet NF1 is also  associated with a high risk of cancer. Measurements of circulating free plasma  DNA (cfDNA) are gaining wider applicability in cancer diagnostics, targeting of  therapy, and monitoring of therapeutic response. Individuals with NF1 are likely  to be followed up using this method, but the effects of NF1 and neurofibromas on  cfDNA levels are not known. We studied peripheral blood samples from 19 adults  with NF1 and 12 healthy controls. The cfDNA was isolated from plasma with QIAamp  Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit and quantified using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer. The  cfDNA concentration of each sample was normalized relative to the plasma protein  concentration. The normalized median concentration of cfDNA in plasma was 19.3  ng/ml (range 6.6-78.6) among individuals with NF1 and 15.9 ng/ml (range  4.8-47.0) among controls (p = .369). Individuals with NF1 who also had plexiform  neurofibroma (pNF) showed non-significantly elevated cfDNA concentration  compared to individuals with NF1 and without known pNF (median 25.4 vs.  18.8 ng/ml, p = .122). The effect of NF1 on cfDNA seems to be relatively small  and NF1 is therefore unlikely to hamper the use of cfDNA-based assays.  © 2021 The Authors.

IMPORTANCE: Understanding RAS dependency and mechanisms of RAS activation in  non-V600 BRAF variant cancers has important clinical implications. This is the  first study to date to systematically assess RAS dependency of BRAF alterations  with real-world cancer genomic databases. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate RAS dependency of individual BRAF alterations through  alteration coexistence analysis using cancer genomic databases. DESIGN AND SETTING: A cross-sectional data analysis of 119 538 nonredundant  cancer samples using cancer genomics databases including GENIE (Genomics  Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange) and databases in cBioPortal including  TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) (accessed March 24, 2020), in addition to 2745  cancer samples from Mayo Clinic Genomics Laboratory (January 1, 2015, to July 1,  2020). Frequencies and odds ratios of coexisting alterations of RAS (KRAS, NRAS  and HRAS) and RAS regulatory genes (NF1, PTPN11 and CBL) were calculated for  individual BRAF alterations, and compared according to the current BRAF  alteration classification; cancer type specificity of coexisting alterations of  RAS or RAS regulatory genes was also evaluated. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome measurement is enrichment of RAS  (KRAS, NRAS and HRAS) alterations in BRAF variant cancers. Secondary outcome  measurement is enrichment of RAS regulatory gene (NF1, PTPN11, and CBL) in BRAF  variant cancers. RESULTS: A total of 2745 cancer samples from 2708 patients (female/male ratio:  1.0) tested by Mayo Clinic Genomics Laboratory and 119 538 patients (female/male  ratio: 1.1) from GENIE and cBioPortal database were included in the study. In  119 538 nonredundant cancer samples, class 1 BRAF alterations and BRAF fusions  were found to be mutually exclusive to alterations of RAS or RAS regulatory  genes (odds ratio range 0.03-0.13 and 0.03-0.73 respectively), confirming their  RAS independency. Both class 2 and class 3 BRAF alterations show variable and  overlapping levels of enriched RAS alterations (odds ratio range: 0.03-5.9 and  0.63-2.52 respectively), suggesting heterogeneity in RAS dependency and a need  to revisit BRAF alteration classification. For RAS-dependent BRAF alterations,  the coexisting alterations also involve RAS regulatory genes by enrichment  analysis (for example, S467L shows an odds ratio of 8.26 for NF1, 9.87 for  PTPN11, and 15.23 for CBL) and occur in a variety of cancer types with some  coalterations showing cancer type specificity (for example, HRAS variations  account for 46.7% of all coexisting RAS alterations in BRAF variant bladder  cancers, but 0% in non-small cell lung cancers). Variant-level assessment shows  that BRAF alterations involving the same codon may differ in RAS dependency. In  addition, RAS dependency of previously unclassified BRAF alterations could be  assessed. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Current BRAF alteration classification based on in  vitro assays does not accurately predict RAS dependency in vivo for non-V600  BRAF alterations. RAS-dependent BRAF variant cancers with different mechanisms  of RAS activation suggest the need for different treatment strategies.

PURPOSE: Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) frequently develop  plexiform neurofibromas (PNs), which can cause significant morbidity. We  performed a phase II trial of the MAPK/ERK kinase inhibitor, mirdametinib  (PD-0325901), in patients with NF1 and inoperable PNs. The primary objective was  response rate based on volumetric magnetic resonance imaging analysis. METHODS: Inclusion criteria included age ≥ 16 years and a PN that was either  progressive or causing significant morbidity. First-dose pharmacokinetics were  performed. Patients completed patient-reported outcome measures. Patients  received mirdametinib by mouth twice a day at 2 mg/m2/dose (maximum dose = 4 mg  twice a day) in a 3-week on/1-week off sequence. Each course was 4 weeks in  duration. Evaluations were performed after four courses for the first year and  then after every six courses. Patients could receive a maximum of 24 total  courses. RESULTS: Nineteen patients were enrolled, and all 19 received mirdametinib. The  median age was 24 years (range, 16-39 years); the median baseline tumor volume  was 363.8 mL (range, 3.9-5,161 mL). Eight of the 19 patients (42%) achieved a  partial response of the target PN by course 12, and 10 (53%) had stable disease.  One patient (5%) developed progressive disease at course 8. Significant and  durable decreases were observed in pain ratings. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this analysis represents the first  characterization of the activity and pharmacokinetics of mirdametinib in  patients with NF1 and PNs and is the first published response study for MAPK/ERK  kinase inhibitors in adults with NF1 and PNs. Mirdametinib given at 2 mg/m2/dose  (maximum dose, 4 mg) twice daily in a 3-week on/1-week off sequence resulted in  a 42% partial response rate with preliminary evidence of reduction in pain.

Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a genetic condition affecting approximately  1:3500 persons worldwide. The NF1 gene codes for neurofibromin protein, a GTPase  activating protein (GAP) and a negative regulator of RAS. The NF1 gene undergoes  alternative splicing of exon 23a (E23a) that codes for 21 amino acids placed at  the center of the GAP related domain (GRD). E23a-containing type II  neurofibromin exhibits a weaker Ras-GAP activity compared to E23a-less type I  isoform. Exon E23a has been related with the cognitive impairment present in NF1  individuals. We designed antisense Phosphorodiamidate Morpholino Oligomers  (PMOs) to modulate E23a alternative splicing at physiological conditions of gene  expression and tested their impact during PC12 cell line neuronal  differentiation. Results show that any dynamic modification of the natural ratio  between type I and type II isoforms disturbed neuronal differentiation, altering  the proper formation of neurites and deregulating both the MAPK/ERK and cAMP/PKA  signaling pathways. Our results suggest an opposite regulation of these pathways  by neurofibromin and the possible existence of a feedback loop sensing  neurofibromin-related signaling. The present work illustrates the utility of  PMOs to study alternative splicing that could be applied to other alternatively  spliced genes in vitro and in vivo.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of a brief, transdiagnostic, peer-delivered  intervention for patients with rare diseases in addition to care as usual (CAU)  compared with CAU only. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this 2-group randomized clinical trial  conducted from October 5, 2017, to July 12, 2019, patients were recruited via  specialized clinics and patient organizations across Germany and participated  from home. The study included consecutive adult patients with neurofibromatosis  type 1, Marfan syndrome, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and pulmonary arterial  hypertension who have limited functionality because of the disease. Exclusion  criteria were a life-threatening health status and ongoing psychotherapeutic  treatment. Of 143 patients screened for eligibility with a semistructured  telephone interview, 54 were excluded, and 89 were randomized: 45 patients were  randomly allocated to the peer-delivered intervention group, and 44 to the  control group; 87 patients (98%) completed the 6-month follow-up assessment. The  analysis was performed using an intention-to-treat principle. Data cleansing and  analysis were conducted between April 25, 2019, and February 13, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: The 6-week intervention consisted of a self-help book and  telephone-based peer counseling in addition to CAU. The control group received  CAU alone. Peer counselors received training, structured consultation  guidelines, and supervision. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was acceptance of the disease as  assessed using the Illness Cognition Questionnaire (ICQ; mean sum scores range  from 0 to 18, with higher values representing more acceptance) 6 months after  the intervention. Secondary outcomes included self-reported coping strategies  (Health Education Impact Questionnaire), illness cognition (ICQ and Illness  Perception Questionnaire), depression severity (Patient Health Questionnaire  9-item depression scale), anxiety severity (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale),  quality of life (12-Item Short-Form Health Survey), and social support (Social  Support Questionnaire). Outcomes were assessed before the intervention, after  the intervention, and at a 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of the 89 participating patients was 46.3 (14.9)  years; 59 (66%) were women. There were no group differences regarding baseline  variables. All patients allocated to the intervention group completed the  intervention. Six months after the intervention, but not directly after  completing the program, the intervention group had significantly higher rates of  acceptance (ICQ) of the disease (primary outcome) compared with the CAU group.  Mean (SD) baseline ICQ scores were 9.61 (3.79) in the control group and 9.86  (3.40) in the intervention group. Mean (SE) ICQ scores at 6 months were 10.32  (0.42) for the control group and 11.79 (0.42) for the intervention group, with a  significant mean difference of -1.47 (95% CI, -2.63 to -0.31; P = .01). Several  secondary outcomes, including different coping strategies, social support, and  mental quality of life, were significantly higher after the intervention  compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, a self-help and  peer counseling intervention improved patients' acceptance of their rare chronic  diseases. Self-management and peer support can efficiently address the unique  care needs of patients with rare diseases. TRIAL REGISTRATION: isrctn.org Identifier: ISRCTN13738704.

Although patients are diagnosed according to clinical  criteria and few genotype-phenotype correlations are known, molecular analysis  remains important. NF1 displays allelic heterogeneity, with a high proportion of  variants affecting splicing, including deep intronic alleles and changes outside  the canonical splice sites, making validation problematic. Next Generation  Sequencing (NGS) technologies integrated with multiplex ligation-dependent probe  amplification (MLPA) have largely overcome RNA-based techniques but do not  detect splicing defects. A rapid minigene-based system was set up to test the  effects of NF1 variants on splicing. We investigated 29 intronic and exonic NF1  variants identified in patients during the diagnostic process. The minigene  assay showed the coexistence of multiple mechanisms of splicing alterations for  seven variants. A leaky effect on splicing was documented in one de novo  substitution detected in a sporadic patient with a specific phenotype without  neurofibromas. Our splicing assay proved to be a reliable and fast method to  validate novel NF1 variants potentially affecting splicing and to detect  hypomorphic effects that might have phenotypic consequences, avoiding the  requirement of patient's RNA.

Neurofibromatosis (NF) is an autosomal genetic disorder for which early and  definite clinical diagnoses are difficult. To identify the diagnosis, five  affected probands with suspected NF from unrelated families were included in  this study. Molecular analysis was performed using multigene panel testing and  Sanger sequencing. Ultradeep sequencing was used to analyze the mutation rate in  the tissues from the proband with mosaic mutations. Three different pathogenic  variants of the NF1 gene were found in three probands who mainly complained of  café-au-lait macules (CALMs), including one frameshift variant  c.5072_5073insTATAACTGTAACTCCTGGGTCAGGGAGTACACCAA:p.Tyr1692Ilefs in exon 37, one  missense variant c.3826C > T:p.Arg1276Ter in exon 28, and one splicing variant  c.4110 + 1G > T at the first base downstream of the 3'-end of exon 30. One NF1  gene mosaic variant was found in a proband who complained of cutaneous  neurofibroma with the frameshift variant c.495_498del:p.Thr165fs in exon 5, and  ultradeep sequencing showed the highest mutation rate of 10.81% in cutaneous  neurofibromas. A frameshift variant, c.36_39del:p.Ser12fs in exon 1 of the NF2  gene, was found in a proband who presented with skin plaques and intracranial  neurogenic tumors. All of these pathogenic variants were heterozygous, one was  not reported, and one not in Chinese before.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic  disorder with a prevalence of 1:3000 births and a wide variety of clinical  manifestations. Cutaneous neurofibromas (cNF) are among the most common visible  manifestations of NF1 and present a major clinical burden for patients. NF1  patients with cNF often report decreased quality of life, emotional well-being  and physical comfort. Developing effective medical therapies for cNF has been  identified as a priority for the majority of adults with NF1. METHODS: The study was an open, controlled and prospective proof-of-concept  clinical trial. The topical treatment consisted of two steps: cNF microporation  using a laser device followed by topical application of one drop of diclofenac  25 mg/mL on the surface of the cNF (T neurofibroma = treatment) or physiological  saline (C neurofibroma = control) and reapplied twice daily for 3 days.  Neurofibroma assessments included visual and dermatoscopy observations noting  color and presence of necrosis, presence of flaccidity, measurements in two  dimensions, photographs, and histopathology after excision. The primary efficacy  variable was the presence of tissue necrosis. The primary safety variable was  the occurrence of treatment-related adverse events. RESULTS: Six patients were included in the study. The treatment resulted in  transitory topical changes (healing of the microporation grid with formation of  scintillating tissue layer, hyperemia and desquamation), with no statistically  significant variation in the dimensions of the T and C neurofibromas in relation  to pretreatment measurements. There was no necrosis in the T or C neurofibromas.  In the histopathological analysis, there was no significant difference in the  distribution of chronic (lymphocytic) inflammatory infiltrate in the papillary  reticular dermis (subepithelial), type of infiltrate (diffuse, perivascular, or  both), presence of fibrosis, and presence of atrophy among the T and C  neurofibromas. No adverse events attributable to the use of diclofenac were  reported during the treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment did not result in significant alterations in terms of  presence of tissue necrosis, size, or histopathological features in the T  neurofibromas or in comparison to the C neurofibromas. Topical diclofenac with  laser microporation was well-tolerated, with no adverse events attributable to  diclofenac reported. Whether these observations are due to minimal systemic and  neurofibroma exposure remain to be explored in dosage studies with larger  patient groups.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common hereditary  neurocutaneous disorders. In addition to skin pigmentation and cutaneous  neurofibroma, some patients developed the plexiform neurofibroma since birth.  Plexiform neurofibroma has abundant Schwann cells, fibroblasts, mast cells,  blood vessels, and connective tissues, which increases the risk of developing a  malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). MPNST is a highly invasive  cancer with no effective therapeutic agent. Cordycepin or 3'-deoxyadenosine is  an extract from cordyceps militaris, which has been reported as an  anti-inflammation and anti-tumor agent. Herein, we evaluated cordycepin's  anti-proliferative effect on MPNST cell lines both in vitro and in vivo.  Cordycepin inhibited the MPNST cell growth with an arrest of cell cycle at G2/M  and S phases. The administration of naringin and pentostatin, inhibitors for  adenosine deaminase (ADA), enzyme responsible for cordycepin degradation, did  not show a synergistic effect in MPNST cells treated with cordycepin. However,  the combined treatment enhanced the decrease of tumors in xenograft mouse model.  Immunoblotting showed a decreased level of p53 protein in all MPNST cell lines,  but S462TY cells. After cordycepin treatment, the levels of ERK, survivin, pAKT,  and Sp1 proteins also decreased. The level of tubulin, but not actin or GAPDH,  decreased in a dose-dependent manner. The microtubule network which is composed  of tubulins was markedly decomposed in those treated MPNST cells. To elucidate  the epigenetic control of transcription, ChIP-qPCR assay of the Sp1 and tubulin  promoter regions revealed decreased Sp1 binding. The incorporation of  3'-doexyadenosine is detrimental for the process of poly(A) tail elongation. The  poly(A) tail length assay showed the tail length in Sp1 and tubulin transcripts  decreased in the treated cells. Nevertheless, the administration of SP1 protein  to the treated cells could not rescue them completely. Furthermore, the  p53-knocked-down cells (S462TY) where the expression of both p53 and Sp1 was  suppressed, were vulnerable to cordycepin. The p53 protein could ameliorate the  effect. In summary, cordycepin is effective to inhibit the growth of MPNST,  probably through the pathway of p53/Sp1/tubulin.  AJCR Copyright © 2021.

The aim of this study was to investigate P300  event-related potential (ERP) associated with WM in NF1. Sixteen adolescents  with NF1 were compared with controls on measures of WM and EEG was recorded  during a WM nback task. The NF1 group showed poorer performance on measures of  WM as compared to the control group. No group differences were observed in P300  amplitude at Pz, but P300 latency was shorter in the NF1 group. Topographic  analyses of P300 amplitude showed group differences indicating neural processing  differences in the NF1 group relative to controls, which possibly contribute to  the cognitive deficits seen in this population.  © 2021.

Cognitive dysfunction is among the hallmark symptoms of Neurofibromatosis 1, and  accordingly, loss of the Drosophila melanogaster ortholog of Neurofibromin 1  (dNf1) precipitates associative learning deficits. However, the affected  circuitry in the adult CNS remained unclear and the compromised mechanisms  debatable. Although the main evolutionarily conserved function attributed to Nf1  is to inactivate Ras, decreased cAMP signaling on its loss has been thought to  underlie impaired learning. Using mixed sex populations, we determine that dNf1  loss results in excess GABAergic signaling to the central for associative  learning mushroom body (MB) neurons, apparently suppressing learning. dNf1 is  necessary and sufficient for learning within these non-MB neurons, as a dAlk and  Ras1-dependent, but PKA-independent modulator of GABAergic neurotransmission.  Surprisingly, we also uncovered and discuss a postsynaptic Ras1-dependent, but  dNf1-independnet signaling within the MBs that apparently responds to  presynaptic GABA levels and contributes to the learning deficit of the mutants.

Electronic address:  paradal@mskcc.org.  NF1-associated malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are the major  cause of mortality in neurofibromatosis. MPNSTs arise from benign peripheral  nerve plexiform neurofibromas that originate in the embryonic neural crest cell  lineage. Using reporter transgenes that label early neural crest lineage cells  in multiple NF1 MPNST mouse models, we discover and characterize a rare MPNST  cell population with stem-cell-like properties, including quiescence, that is  essential for tumor initiation and relapse. Following isolation of these cells,  we derive a cancer-stem-cell-specific gene expression signature that includes  consensus embryonic neural crest genes and identify Nestin as a marker for the  MPNST cell of origin. Combined targeting of cancer stem cells along with  antimitotic chemotherapy yields effective tumor inhibition and prolongs  survival. Enrichment of the cancer stem cell signature in cognate human tumors  supports the generality and relevance of cancer stem cells to MPNST therapy  development.  Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

(#)Contributed equally  Neurofibromatosis type 1 is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by  mutation in the neurofibromin 1 (NF1) gene. Its hallmarks are cutaneous findings  including neurofibromas, benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors. We analyzed the  collagen and matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) expression in Neurofibromatosis 1  cutaneous neurofibroma and found excessive expression of collagen and reduced  expression of MMP1. To identify new therapeutic drugs for neurofibroma, we  analyzed phosphorylation of components of the Ras pathway, which underlies NF1  regulation, and applied treatments to block this pathway (PD184352, U0126, and  rapamycin) and lysosomal processes (chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ),  and bafilomycin A (BafA)) in cultured Neurofibromatosis 1 fibroblasts. We found  that downregulation of the MMP1 protein was a key abnormal feature in the  neurofibromatosis 1 fibroblasts and that the decreased MMP1 was restored by the  lysosomal blockers CQ and HCQ, but not by the blockers of the Ras pathway.  Moreover, the MMP1-upregulating activity of those lysosomal blockers was  dependent on aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) activation and ERK phosphorylation.  Our findings suggest that lysosomal blockers are potential candidates for the  treatment of Neurofibromatosis 1 neurofibroma.

Neurons have recently emerged as essential cellular constituents of the tumour  microenvironment, and their activity has been shown to increase the growth of a  diverse number of solid tumours1. Although the role of neurons in tumour  progression has previously been demonstrated2, the importance of neuronal  activity to tumour initiation is less clear-particularly in the setting of  cancer predisposition syndromes. Fifteen per cent of individuals with  the neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) cancer predisposition syndrome (in which tumours  arise in close association with nerves) develop low-grade neoplasms of the optic  pathway (known as optic pathway gliomas (OPGs)) during early childhood3,4,  raising  the possibility that postnatal light-induced activity of the optic  nerve drives tumour initiation. Here we use an authenticated mouse model of OPG  driven by mutations in the neurofibromatosis 1 tumour suppressor gene (Nf1)5 to  demonstrate that stimulation of optic nerve activity increases optic glioma  growth, and that decreasing visual experience via light deprivation prevents  tumour formation and maintenance. We show that the initiation of Nf1-driven OPGs  (Nf1-OPGs) depends on visual experience during a developmental period in which  Nf1-mutant mice are susceptible to tumorigenesis. Germline Nf1 mutation in  retinal neurons results in aberrantly increased shedding of neuroligin 3 (NLGN3)  within the optic nerve in response to retinal neuronal activity. Moreover,  genetic Nlgn3 loss or pharmacological inhibition of NLGN3 shedding blocks the  formation and progression of Nf1-OPGs. Collectively, our studies establish an  obligate role for neuronal activity in the development of some types of brain  tumours, elucidate a therapeutic strategy to reduce OPG incidence or mitigate  tumour progression, and underscore the role of Nf1mutation-mediated  dysregulation of neuronal signalling pathways in mouse models of the NF1 cancer  predisposition syndrome.

BACKGROUND: Emerging insights from numerous laboratories have revealed important  roles for nonneoplastic cells in the development and progression of brain  tumors. One of these nonneoplastic cellular constituents, glioma-associated  microglia (GAM), represents a unique population of brain monocytes within the  tumor microenvironment that have been reported to both promote and inhibit  glioma proliferation. To elucidate the role of GAM in the setting of low-grade  glioma (LGG), we leveraged RNA sequencing meta-analysis, genetically engineered  mouse strains, and human biospecimens. METHODS: Publicly available disease-associated microglia (DAM) RNA-seq datasets  were used, followed by immunohistochemistry and RNAScope validation.  CD11a-deficient mouse microglia were used for in vitro functional studies, while  LGG growth in mice was assessed using anti-CD11a neutralizing antibody treatment  of Neurofibromatosis type 1 (Nf1) optic glioma mice in vivo. RESULTS: We identified Itgal/CD11a enrichment in GAM relative to other DAM  populations, which was confirmed in several independently generated murine  models of Nf1 optic glioma. Moreover, ITGAL/CD11A expression was similarly  increased in human LGG (pilocytic astrocytoma) specimens from several different  datasets, specifically in microglia from these tumors. Using CD11a-knockout  mice, CD11a expression was shown to be critical for murine microglia CX3CL1  receptor (Cx3cr1) expression and CX3CL1-directed motility, as well as glioma  mitogen (Ccl5) production. Consistent with an instructive role for CD11a+  microglia in stromal control of LGG growth, antibody-mediated CD11a inhibition  reduced mouse Nf1 LGG growth in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these findings establish ITGAL/CD11A as a critical  microglia regulator of LGG biology relevant to future stroma-targeted brain  tumor treatment strategies.  © The Author(s) 2021.

(#)Contributed equally  BACKGROUND: Sensory modulation difficulties are common in children with  conditions such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and could contribute to other  social and non-social symptoms. Positing a causal role for sensory processing  differences requires observing atypical sensory reactivity prior to the  emergence of other symptoms, which can be achieved through prospective studies. METHODS: In this longitudinal study, we examined auditory repetition suppression  and change detection at 5 and 10 months in infants with and without  Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1), a condition associated with higher likelihood of  developing ASD. RESULTS: In typically developing infants, suppression to vowel repetition and  enhanced responses to vowel/pitch change decreased with age over posterior  regions, becoming more frontally specific; age-related change was diminished in  the NF1 group. Whilst both groups detected changes in vowel and pitch, the NF1  group were largely slower to show a differentiated neural response. Auditory  responses did not relate to later language, but were related to later ASD  traits. CONCLUSIONS: These findings represent the first demonstration of atypical brain  responses to sounds in infants with NF1 and suggest they may relate to the  likelihood of later ASD.

Schwannomas are benign neoplasms that can cause gain- and loss-of-function  neurological phenotypes, including severe, intractable pain. To investigate the  molecular mechanisms underlying schwannoma-associated pain we compared the RNA  sequencing profile of painful and non-painful schwannomas from NF2 patients.  Distinct segregation of painful and non-painful tumors by gene expression  patterns was observed. Differential expression analysis showed the upregulation  of fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF7) in painful schwannomas. Behavioral support  for this finding was observed using a xenograft human NF2-schwannoma model in  nude mice. In this model, over-expression of FGF7 in intra-sciatically implanted  NF2 tumor cells generated pain behavior compared with controls.  © 2021 The Authors.

Schwann cells are normally quiescent, myelinating glia cells of the peripheral  nervous system. Their aberrant proliferation and transformation underlie the  development of benign tumors (neurofibromas) as well as deadly malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). We discovered a new driver of MPNSTs,  an oncogenic GTPase named RABL6A, that functions in part by inhibiting the RB1  tumor suppressor. RB1 is a key mediator of cellular senescence, a permanent  withdrawal from the cell cycle that protects against cell immortalization and  transformation. Based on the RABL6A-RB1 link in MPNSTs, we explored the  hypothesis that RABL6A promotes Schwann cell proliferation and abrogates their  senescence by inhibiting RB1. Using sequentially passaged normal human Schwann  cells (NHSCs), we found that the induction of replicative senescence was  associated with reduced expression of endogenous RABL6A. Silencing RABL6A in low  passage NHSCs caused premature stress-induced senescence, which was largely  rescued by co-depletion of RB1. Consistent with those findings, Rabl6-deficient  MEFs displayed impaired proliferation and accelerated senescence compared to  wildtype MEFs. These results demonstrate that RABL6A is required for maintenance  of proper Schwann cell proliferation and imply that aberrantly high RABL6A  expression may facilitate malignant transformation.

Neurofibromatosis Type II (NF2) is an autosomal dominant cancer predisposition  syndrome in which germline haploinsufficiency at the NF2 gene confers a greatly  increased propensity for tumor development arising from tissues of neural crest  derived origin. NF2 encodes the tumor suppressor, Merlin, and its biochemical  function is incompletely understood. One well-established function of Merlin is  as a negative regulator of group A serine/threonine p21-activated kinases  (PAKs). In these studies we explore the role of PAK1 and its closely related  paralog, PAK2, both pharmacologically and genetically, in Merlin-deficient  Schwann cells and in a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) that develops  spontaneous vestibular and spinal schwannomas. We demonstrate that PAK1 and PAK2  are both hyper activated in Merlin-deficient murine schwannomas. In preclinical  trials, a pan Group A PAK inhibitor, FRAX-1036, transiently reduced PAK1 and  PAK2 phosphorylation in vitro, but had insignificant efficacy in vivo.  NVS-PAK1-1, a PAK1 selective inhibitor, had a greater but still minimal effect  on our GEMM phenotype. However, genetic ablation of Pak1 but not Pak2 reduced  tumor formation in our NF2 GEMM. Moreover, germline genetic deletion of Pak1 was  well tolerated, while conditional deletion of Pak2 in Schwann cells resulted in  significant morbidity and mortality. These data support the further development  of PAK1-specific small molecule inhibitors and the therapeutic targeting of PAK1  in vestibular schwannomas and argue against PAK1 and PAK2 existing as  functionally redundant protein isoforms in Schwann cells.  © The Author(s) 2021.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are aggressive soft-tissue  sarcomas that cause significant mortality in adults with neurofibromatosis type  1. We compared gene expression of growth factors in normal human nerves to MPNST  and normal human Schwann cells to MPNST cell lines. We identified WNT5A as the  most significantly upregulated ligand-coding gene and verified its protein  expression in MPNST cell lines and tumors. In many contexts WNT5A acts as an  oncogene. However, inhibiting WNT5A expression using shRNA did not alter MPNST  cell proliferation, invasion, migration, or survival in vitro. Rather,  shWNT5A-treated MPNST cells upregulated mRNAs associated with the remodeling of  extracellular matrix and with immune cell communication. In addition, these  cells secreted increased amounts of the proinflammatory cytokines CXCL1, CCL2,  IL6, CXCL8, and ICAM1. Versus controls, shWNT5A-expressing MPNST cells formed  larger tumors in vivo. Grafted tumors contained elevated macrophage/stromal  cells, larger and more numerous blood vessels, and increased levels of Mmp9,  Cxcl13, Lipocalin-1, and Ccl12. In some MPNST settings, these effects were  mimicked by targeting the WNT5A receptor ROR2. These data suggest that the  non-canonical Wnt ligand WNT5A inhibits MPNST tumor formation by modulating the  MPNST microenvironment, so that blocking WNT5A accelerates tumor growth in vivo.

Reduced muscle tone, muscle weakness, and physical fatigue can impact  considerably on quality of life for children with neurofibromatosis type 1  (NF1). Human muscle biopsies and mouse models of NF1 deficiency in muscle show  intramyocellular lipid accumulation, and preclinical data have indicated that  L-carnitine supplementation can ameliorate this phenotype. The aim of this study  is to examine whether daily L-carnitine supplementation is safe and feasible,  and will improve muscle strength and reduce fatigue in children with NF1. A  12-week Phase 2a trial was conducted using 1000 mg daily oral levocarnitine  tartrate supplementation. Recruited children were between 8 and 12 years old  with a clinical diagnosis of NF1, history of muscle weakness and fatigue, and  naïve to L-carnitine. Primary outcomes were safety (self-reporting, biochemical  testing) and compliance. Secondary outcomes included plasma acylcarnitine  profiles, functional measures (muscle strength, long jump, handwriting speed,  6-minute-walk test [6MWT]), and parent-reported questionnaires (PedsQL™,  CBCL/6-18). Six children completed the trial with no self-reported adverse  events. Biochemical tests for kidney and liver function were normal, and the  average compliance was 95%. Plasma acylcarnitine levels were low, but within a  range not clinically linked to carnitine deficiency. For strength measures,  there was a mean 53% increase in dorsiflexion strength (95% confidence interval  [CI] 8.89-60.75; p = 0.02) and mean 66% increase in plantarflexion strength (95%  CI 12.99-134.1; p = 0.03). In terms of muscle performance, there was a mean 10%  increase in long jump distance (95% CI 2.97-16.03; p = 0.01) and 6MWT distance  (95% CI 5.88-75.45; p = 0.03). Comparison with the 1000 Norms Project data  showed a significant improvement in Z-score for all of these measures. Parent  reports showed no negative impact on quality of life, and the perceived benefits  led to the majority of individuals remaining on L-carnitine after the study.  Twelve weeks of L-carnitine supplementation is safe and feasible in children  with NF1, and a Phase 3 trial should confirm the efficacy of treatment.  © 2021 The Authors.

(2)Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Medical  Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.  OBJECTIVE: We aimed at developing a patient-centred self-help programme,  tailored to the needs of patients with rare chronic diseases. DESIGN: Multistage, multimethod development process including a survey with  validated self-report scales and open-ended questions (phase 1) and focus groups  (phase 2) for needs assessment and, consolidating the first phases and the  literature, the intervention development (phase 3). SETTING: Phase 1: nationwide online survey in Germany, phase 2: four separate  and diagnostically homogeneous focus groups. The focus groups took place at a  university medical centre in Germany. PARTICIPANTS: Target group were patients with rare diseases that occur at a  prevalence <1:2000. Phase 1: n=300 participants with different rare diseases.  Phase 2: Individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (n=4), primary sclerosing  cholangitis (n=5), pulmonary arterial hypertension (n=4) and Marfan syndrome  (n=5). RESULTS: The central results of phases 1 and 2 were requests for more  information about the disease and contact with other affected persons. Patients  also expressed support needs in dealing with difficult emotions and identified  acceptance of the disease as a turning point for quality of life. In phase 3, we  identified acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) as a suitable therapeutic  approach and determined details about implementation and execution of  self-management programmes. A 6-week self-help concept led by peer counsellors  was developed, which includes disease-specific information and ACT-based  exercises. CONCLUSION: Based on a multistage needs assessment, we developed a peer-guided  self-help intervention for patients with rare chronic diseases. Combining  self-management, peer-counselling and ACT may help living with a rare condition.  Further research needs to test the programme's efficacy.

BACKGROUND: RASopathies are a group of syndromes showing clinical overlap caused  by mutations in genes affecting the RAS-MAPK pathway. Consequent disruption on  cellular signaling leads and is driven by phosphoproteome remodeling. However,  we still lack a comprehensive picture of the different key players and altered  downstream effectors. METHODS: An in silico interactome of RASopathy proteins was generated using  pathway enrichment analysis/STRING tool, including identification of main hub  proteins. We also integrated phosphoproteomic and immunoblotting studies using  previous published information on RASopathy proteins and their neighbors in the  context of RASopathy syndromes. Data from Phosphosite database (  www.phosphosite.org ) was collected in order to obtain the potential  phosphosites subjected to regulation in the 27 causative RASopathy proteins. We  compiled a dataset of dysregulated phosphosites in RASopathies, searched for  commonalities between syndromes in harmonized data, and analyzed the role of  phosphorylation in the syndromes by the identification of key players between  the causative RASopathy proteins and the associated interactome. RESULTS: In this study, we provide a curated data set of 27 causative RASopathy  genes, identify up to 511 protein-protein associations using pathway enrichment  analysis/STRING tool, and identify 12 nodes as main hub proteins. We found that  a large group of proteins contain tyrosine residues and their biological  processes include but are not limited to the nervous system. Harmonizing  published RASopathy phosphoproteomic and immunoblotting studies we identified a  total of 147 phosphosites with increased phosphorylation, whereas 47 have  reduced phosphorylation. The PKB signaling pathway is the most represented among  the dysregulated phosphoproteins within the RASopathy proteins and their  neighbors, followed by phosphoproteins implicated in the regulation of cell  proliferation and the MAPK pathway. CONCLUSIONS: This work illustrates the complex network underlying the  RASopathies and the potential of phosphoproteomics for dissecting the molecular  mechanisms in these syndromes. A combined study of associated genes, their  interactome and phosphorylation events in RASopathies, elucidates key players  and mechanisms to direct future research, diagnosis and therapeutic windows.

OBJECTIVE: To determine a suitable outcome measure for assessing muscle strength  in neurofibromatosis (NF) type 1 and NF2 clinical trials, we evaluated the  intraobserver reliability of handheld dynamometry (HHD) and developed consensus  recommendations for its use in NF clinical trials. METHODS: Patients ≥5 years of age with weakness in at least 1 muscle group by  manual muscle testing (MMT) were eligible. Maximal isometric muscle strength of  a weak muscle group and the biceps of the dominant arm was measured by HHD. An  average of 3 repetitions per session was used as an observation, and 3 sessions  with rest period between each were performed on the same day by a single  observer. Intrasession and intersession intraclass correlation coefficients  (ICCs) and coefficients of variation (CVs) were calculated to assess reliability  and measurement error. RESULTS: Twenty patients with NF1 and 13 with NF2 were enrolled; median age was  12 years (interquartile range [IQR] 9-17 years) and 29 years (IQR 22-38 years),  respectively. By MMT, weak muscle strength ranged from 2-/5 to 4+/5. Biceps  strength was 5/5 in all patients. Intersession ICCs for the weak muscles were  0.98 and 0.99 in the NF1 and NF2 cohorts, respectively, and for biceps were 0.97  and 0.97, respectively. The median CVs for average session strength were 5.4%  (IQR 2.6%-7.3%) and 2.9% (IQR 2.0%-6.2%) for weak muscles and biceps,  respectively. CONCLUSION: HHD performed by a trained examiner with a well-defined protocol is  a reliable technique to measure muscle strength in NF1 and NF2. Recommendations  for strength testing in NF1 and NF2 trials are provided.  © 2021 American Academy of Neurology.

OBJECTIVE: To review and recommend patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures  assessing multidimensional domains of quality of life (QoL) to use as clinical  endpoints in medical and psychosocial trials for children and adults with  neurofibromatosis (NF) type 1, NF2, and schwannomatosis. METHODS: The PRO working group of the Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis  and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) International Collaboration used systematic methods  to review, rate, and recommend existing self-report and parent-report PRO  measures of generic and disease-specific QoL for NF clinical trials.  Recommendations were based on 4 main criteria: patient characteristics, item  content, psychometric properties, and feasibility. RESULTS: The highest-rated generic measures were (1) the Pediatric Quality of  Life Inventory (PedsQL) Generic Core Scales for NF clinical trials for children  or for children through adults, (2) the Functional Assessment of Cancer  Therapy-General for adult medical trials, and (3) the World Health Organization  Quality of Life-BREF for adult psychosocial trials. The highest-rated  disease-specific measures were (1) the PedsQL NF1 Module for NF1 trials, (2) the  NF2 Impact on Quality of Life Scale for NF2 trials, and (3) the Penn Acoustic  Neuroma Quality of Life Scale for NF2 trials targeting vestibular schwannomas.  To date, there are no disease-specific tools assessing multidimensional domains  of QoL for schwannomatosis. CONCLUSIONS: The REiNS Collaboration currently recommends these generic and  disease-specific PRO measures to assess multidimensional domains of QoL for NF  clinical trials. Additional research is needed to further evaluate the use of  these measures in both medical and psychosocial trials.  © 2021 American Academy of Neurology.

OBJECTIVE: To assess imaging utilization practices across clinical specialists  in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) for the evaluation of symptomatic and  asymptomatic children and adults with or without plexiform neurofibromas (PN). METHODS: An institutional review board-exempt survey was administered to medical  practitioners caring for individuals with NF1 at the Response Evaluation in  Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) meeting in September 2019. The  survey included questions on respondent demographic data (9 questions), type of  imaging obtained for asymptomatic (4 questions) and symptomatic (4 questions)  people with and without PN, and utilization of diffusion-weighted imaging (2  questions). RESULTS: Thirty practitioners participated in the survey. Most were academic  neuro-oncologists at high-volume (>10 patients/week) NF1 centers. Of 30  respondents, 26 had access to whole-body MRI (WB-MRI). The most common approach  to an asymptomatic person without PN was no imaging (adults: 57% [17/30];  children: 50% [15/30]), followed by a screening WB-MRI (adults: 20% [6/30];  children: 26.7% [8/30]). The most common approach to a person with symptoms or  known PN was regional MRI (adults: 90% [27/30]; children: 93% [28/30]), followed  by WB-MRI (adults: 20% [6/30]; children: 36.7% [11/30]). WB-MRI was most often  obtained to evaluate a symptomatic child with PN (37% [11/30]). CONCLUSIONS: More than 90% of practitioners indicated they would obtain a  regional MRI in a symptomatic patient without known or visible PN. Otherwise,  there was little consensus on imaging practices. Given the high prevalence of PN  and risk of malignant conversion in this patient population, there is a need to  define imaging-based guidelines for optimal clinical care and the design of  future clinical trials.  © 2021 American Academy of Neurology.

OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate published patient-reported outcome  measures for the assessment of hearing function and hearing-related quality of  life (QoL) and recommend measures selected by the Response Evaluation in  Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis International Collaboration (REiNS) as  endpoints for clinical trials in neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). METHODS: The REiNS Patient-Reported Outcomes Working Group systematically  evaluated published patient-reported outcome measures of (1) hearing function  and (2) hearing-related QoL for individuals with hearing loss of various  etiologies using previously published REiNS rating procedures. Ten measures of  hearing functioning and 11 measures of hearing-related QoL were reviewed.  Measures were numerically scored and compared primarily on their participant  characteristics (including participant age range and availability of normative  data), item content, psychometric properties, and feasibility for use in  clinical trials. RESULTS: The Self-Assessment of Communication and the Self-Assessment of  Communication-Adolescent were identified as most useful for adult and pediatric  populations with NF2, respectively, for the measurement of both hearing function  and hearing-related QoL. Measures were selected for their strengths in  participant characteristics, item content, psychometric properties, and  feasibility for use in clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: REiNS recommends the Self-Assessment of Communication adult and  adolescent forms for the assessment of patient-reported hearing function and  hearing-related QoL for NF2 clinical trials. Further work is needed to  demonstrate the utility of these measures in evaluating pharmacologic or  behavioral interventions.  © 2021 American Academy of Neurology.

Yemima.berman@health.nsw.gov.au.  OBJECTIVE: In order to explore the use of Skindex scoring in patients with  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) across multiple clinical sites and inform design  of additional quality of life measures, we analyzed correlations between  Skindex, site, and clinical measures for 79 patients with NF1 from specialized  clinics in Sydney, Australia (Royal North Shore Hospital [RNS]) and Minneapolis,  Minnesota (University of Minnesota [UMN]). METHODS: The relationship between clinical factors and Skindex scores were  explored by clinic site and overall. RESULTS: A total of 40 participants were recruited from RNS and 39 from UMN.  Female sex, total number of cutaneous neurofibroma (cNF), and whether cNF were  present on the face correlated highly with Skindex and not Riccardi scores. The  UMN site had lower average scores, but these differences were almost entirely  removed after adjusting for age, sex, facial cNF, and total cNF number. CONCLUSIONS: The development of cNF in adolescence and adulthood in NF1 often  leads to progressive disfigurement and discomfort and is among one of the most  common reasons for patients to seek medical treatment. Skindex has been used to  assess skin-related quality of life in NF1 previously but is not specific to  NF1. These findings highlight the need for a low threshold for referral to  dermatologists for all patients with NF1 regardless of the severity of disease.  The finding that facial cNF and higher total number of cNF correlates with  poorer skin-related quality of life may benefit design of more specific NF1  skin-related quality of life measures.  © 2021 American Academy of Neurology.

OBJECTIVE: To review parent-report social skills measures to identify and  recommend consensus outcomes for use in clinical trials of social deficit in  children and adolescents (ages 6-18 years) with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). METHODS: Searches were conducted via PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov to identity  social skills outcome measures with English language versions used in clinical  trials in the past 5 years with populations with known social skills deficits,  including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder  (ASD). Measures were rated by the Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and  Schwannomatosis (REiNS) Neurocognitive Committee on patient characteristics, use  in published studies, domains assessed, availability of standard scores,  psychometric properties, and feasibility to determine their appropriateness for  use in NF1 clinical trials. RESULTS: Two measures were ultimately recommended by the committee: the Social  Responsiveness Scale-2 (SRS-2) and the Social Skills Improvement System-Rating  Scale (SSIS-RS). CONCLUSIONS: Each of the 2 measures assesses different aspects of social  functioning. The SSIS-RS is appropriate for studies focused on broader social  functioning; the SRS-2 is best for studies targeting problematic social  behaviors associated with ASD. Researchers will need to consider the goals of  their study when choosing a measure, and specific recommendations for their use  are provided.  © 2021 American Academy of Neurology.

OBJECTIVE: As part of an evaluation of the Response Evaluation in  Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) International Collaboration  patient representative program, we surveyed REiNS members to (1) identify  facilitators and barriers to involving patient representatives and (2)  understand whether and how involving patient representatives affected  recommendations for clinical trial outcomes. METHODS: We administered an anonymous online survey to all REiNS members.  Facilitators and barriers to patient representative involvement were solicited  using a modified free listing technique; responses were inductively grouped into  higher-order categories and ranked based on saliency score (Smith s). Open-ended  questions assessed patient representative expectations for engagement, perceived  benefits/costs of patient engagement, and patient representative contributions;  responses were analyzed using conventional content analysis. RESULTS: A total of 63/172 (37%) members responded, including 18/30 (60%)  patient representatives. Providing sufficient opportunities to meaningfully  engage in research tasks and cultivating a respectful, inclusive atmosphere were  key facilitators to patient representatives' satisfaction and ability to make an  impact. Respondents perceived that patient representatives directly (through  their input on research tasks) and indirectly (through effects on other  stakeholders' knowledge and communication style) improved the organization's  research, leading to selection of more meaningful, relevant, and feasible  clinical trial outcome measures. Ongoing challenges to patient engagement  include difficulty scheduling meetings and concerns about the level of  scientific knowledge patient representatives needed to effectively engage. CONCLUSIONS: Involving patient representatives in REiNS improved perceived  quality of neurofibromatosis clinical trial outcome measures. Negotiating  sufficient opportunities to engage, fostering an inclusive atmosphere, and  navigating time pressures are key to effective patient engagement.  © 2021 American Academy of Neurology.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a chronic multisystemic genetic disorder that  results from loss of function in the neurofibromin protein. Neurofibromin may  regulate metabolism, though the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown.  Here we show that neurofibromin regulates metabolic homeostasis in Drosophila  via a discrete neuronal circuit. Loss of neurofibromin increases metabolic rate  via a Ras GAP-related domain-dependent mechanism, increases feeding  homeostatically, and alters lipid stores and turnover kinetics. The increase in  metabolic rate is independent of locomotor activity, and maps to a sparse subset  of neurons. Stimulating these neurons increases metabolic rate, linking their  dynamic activity state to metabolism over short time scales. Our results  indicate that neurofibromin regulates metabolic rate via neuronal mechanisms,  suggest that cellular and systemic metabolic alterations may represent a  pathophysiological mechanism in neurofibromatosis type 1, and provide a platform  for investigating the cellular role of neurofibromin in metabolic homeostasis.  © 2021.

Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant genetic syndrome caused  by mutations in the NF2 tumor suppressor gene resulting in multiple schwannomas  and meningiomas. There are no FDA approved therapies for these tumors and their  relentless progression results in high rates of morbidity and mortality. Through  a combination of high throughput screens, preclinical in vivo modeling, and  evaluation of the kinome en masse, we identified actionable drug targets and  efficacious experimental therapeutics for the treatment of NF2 related  schwannomas and meningiomas. These efforts identified brigatinib (ALUNBRIG®), an  FDA-approved inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinases including ALK, to be a  potent inhibitor of tumor growth in established NF2 deficient xenograft  meningiomas and a genetically engineered murine model of spontaneous NF2  schwannomas. Surprisingly, neither meningioma nor schwannoma cells express ALK.  Instead, we demonstrate that brigatinib inhibited multiple tyrosine kinases,  including EphA2, Fer and focal adhesion kinase 1 (FAK1). These data demonstrate  the power of the de novo unbiased approach for drug discovery and represents a  major step forward in the advancement of therapeutics for the treatment of NF2  related malignancies.

Although most commonly benign, neurofibromas (NFs) can have devastating  functional and cosmetic effects in addition to the possibility of malignant  transformation. Orbitofacial NFs, in particular, may cause progressive,  disfiguring tumors of the lid, brow, temple, face, and orbit, and clinical  evidence suggests that they may have increased local aggressiveness compared to  NFs developing at other sites. The purpose of this study was to identify  biological differences between orbitofacial NFs and those occurring at other  anatomic sites. We performed RNA-sequencing in orbitofacial (n = 10) and  non-orbitofacial (n = 9) NFs. Differential gene expression analysis demonstrated  that a variety of gene sets including genes involved in cell proliferation,  interferon, and immune-related pathways were enriched in orbitofacial NF.  Comparisons with publicly available databases of various Schwann cell tumors and  malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) revealed a significant overlap  of differentially expressed genes between orbitofacial versus non-orbitofacial  NF and plexiform NF versus MPNST. In summary, we identified gene expression  differences between orbitofacial NF and NFs occurring at other locations.  Further investigation may be warranted, given that orbitofacial NF are  notoriously difficult to treat and associated with disproportionate morbidity.  © 2021 The Authors.

Primi MC(1), Rangarajan ES(1), Patil DN(1), Izard T(1).  Author information: (1)Cell Adhesion Laboratory, Department of Integrative Structural and  Computational Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, Jupiter 33458, FL, United  States.  The Neurofibromatosis type 2 gene encodes the Nf2/merlin tumor suppressor  protein that is responsible for the regulation of cell proliferation. Once  activated, Nf2/merlin modulates adhesive signaling pathways and thereby inhibits  cell growth. Nf2/merlin controls oncogenic gene expression by modulating the  Hippo pathway. By responding to several physical and biochemical stimuli, Hippo  signaling determines contact inhibition of proliferation as well as organ size.  The large tumor suppressor (LATS) serine/threonine-protein kinase is the key  enzyme in the highly conserved kinase cascade that negatively regulates the  activity and localization of the transcriptional coactivators Yes-associated  protein (YAP) and its paralogue transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding  motif (TAZ). Nf2/merlin belongs to the band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin (FERM)  gene family that links the actin cytoskeleton to adherens junctions, remodels  adherens junctions during epithelial morphogenesis and maintains organized  apical surfaces on the plasma cell membrane. Nf2/merlin and ERM proteins have a  globular N-terminal cloverleaf head domain, the FERM domain, that binds to the  plasma membrane, a central α-helical domain, and a tail domain that binds to its  head domain. Here we present the high-resolution crystal structure of Nf2/merlin  bound to LATS1 which shows that LATS1 binding to Nf2/merlin displaces the  Nf2/merlin tail domain and causes an allosteric shift in the Nf2/merlin α-helix  that extends from its FERM domain. This is consistent with the fact that  full-length Nf2/merlin binds LATS1 ~10-fold weaker compared to LATS1 binding to  the Nf2/merlin-PIP2 complex. Our data increase our understanding of Nf2/merlin  biology by providing mechanistic insights into the Hippo pathway that are  relevant to several diseases in particular oncogenic features that are  associated with cancers.  © 2021 The Author(s).

The UMi031-A-2 hiPSC line contains a CRISPR-induced homozygous,  Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) mutation (L64P (CTG > CCG)) in the NF2 gene that  encodes a merlin tumor suppressor. This line was generated from an unaffected  iPSC line using CRISPR technology and characterized for pluripotency and  karyotypic stability. The c.191 T > C variant in NF2 is associated with a  syndromic nervous system tumor disorder leading to the development of bilateral  vestibular schwannomas. Once differentiated into Schwann cells, UMi031-A-2 can  serve as a resource for the analysis of signaling pathways deregulated upon  merlin defects and provide a pre-clinical platform for testing therapies for NF2  schwannomas.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated cognitive  impairments carry significant lifelong morbidity. The lack of targeted biologic  treatments remains a significant unmet need. We examine changes in cognition in  patients with NF1 in the first 48 weeks of mitogen-activated protein kinase  inhibitor (MEKi) treatment. METHODS: Fifty-nine patients with NF1 aged 5-27 years on an MEKi clinical trial  treating plexiform neurofibroma underwent pretreatment and follow-up cognitive  assessments over 48 weeks of treatment. Performance tasks (Cogstate) and  observer-reported functioning (BRIEF) were the primary outcomes. Group-level  (paired t tests) and individual-level analyses (Reliable Change Index, RCI) were  used. RESULTS: Analysis showed statistically significant improvements on BRIEF  compared with baseline (24-week Behavioral Regulation Index: t (58) = 3.03, p =  0.004, d = 0.24; 48-week Metacognition Index: t (39) = 2.70, p = 0.01, d =  0.27). RCI indicated that more patients had clinically significant improvement  at 48 weeks than expected by chance (χ2 = 11.95, p = 0.001, odds ratio [OR] =  6.3). Group-level analyses indicated stable performance on Cogstate (p > 0.05).  RCI statistics showed high proportions of improved working memory (24-week χ2 =  8.36, p = 0.004, OR = 4.6, and 48-week χ2 = 9.34, p = 0.004, OR = 5.3) but not  visual learning/memory. Patients with baseline impairments on BRIEF were more  likely to show significant improvement than nonimpaired patients (24 weeks 46%  vs 8%; χ2 = 9.54, p = 0.008, OR = 9.22; 48 weeks 63% vs 16%; χ2 = 7.50, p =  0.02, OR = 9.0). DISCUSSION: Our data show no evidence of neurotoxicity in 48 weeks of treatment  with an MEKi and a potential clinical signal supporting future research of MEKi  as a cognitive intervention.

Since increased clinical benefit of  MAPK inhibitors (MAPKi) is associated with previous immune checkpoint therapy,  we compare the efficacies of sequential and/or combinatorial regimens in  subcutaneous murine models of melanoma driven by BrafV600, Nras, or Nf1  mutations as well as colorectal and pancreatic carcinoma driven by KrasG12C.  Anti-PD-1/L1 lead-in preceding MAPKi combination optimizes response durability  by promoting pro-inflammatory polarization of macrophages and clonal expansion  of interferon-γhi, and CD8+ cytotoxic and proliferative (versus CD4+ regulatory)  T cells that highly express activation genes. Since therapeutic resistance of  melanoma brain metastasis (MBM) limits patient survival, we demonstrate that  sequencing anti-PD-1/L1 therapy before MAPKi combination suppresses MBM and  improves mouse survival with robust T cell clonal expansion in both intracranial  and extracranial metastatic sites. We propose clinically testing brief  anti-PD-1/L1 (± anti-CTLA-4) dosing before MAPKi co-treatment to suppress  therapeutic resistance.  Copyright © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The mechanism of vulnerability to pediatric low-grade gliomas (pLGGs)-the most  common brain tumor in children-during development remains largely unknown. Using  mouse models of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated pLGGs in the optic  pathway (NF1-OPG), we demonstrate that NF1-OPG arose from the vulnerability to  the dependency of Mek-Erk/MAPK signaling during gliogenesis of one of the two  developmentally transient precursor populations in the optic nerve,  brain-derived migrating glial progenitors (GPs), but not local progenitors.  Hyperactive Erk/MAPK signaling by Nf1 loss overproduced GPs by disrupting the  balance between stem-cell maintenance and gliogenesis of hypothalamic  ventricular zone radial glia (RG). Persistence of RG-like GPs initiated NF1-OPG,  causing Bax-dependent apoptosis in retinal ganglion cells. Removal of three  Mek1/Mek2 alleles or transient post-natal treatment with a low-dose MEK  inhibitor normalized differentiation of Nf1-/- RG-like GPs, preventing NF1-OPG  formation and neuronal degeneration. We provide the proof-of-concept evidence  for preventing pLGGs before tumor-associated neurological damage enters an  irreversible phase.  Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

BACKGROUND: The leading cause of mortality for patients with the  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) cancer predisposition syndrome is the development  of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), an aggressive soft tissue  sarcoma. In the setting of NF1, this cancer type frequently arises from within  its common and benign precursor, plexiform neurofibroma (PN). Transformation  from PN to MPNST is challenging to diagnose due to difficulties in  distinguishing cross-sectional imaging results and intralesional heterogeneity  resulting in biopsy sampling errors. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This multi-institutional study from the National Cancer  Institute and Washington University in St. Louis used fragment size analysis and  ultra-low-pass whole genome sequencing (ULP-WGS) of plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA)  to distinguish between MPNST and PN in patients with NF1. Following in silico  enrichment for short cfDNA fragments and copy number analysis to estimate the  fraction of plasma cfDNA originating from tumor (tumor fraction), we developed a  noninvasive classifier that differentiates MPNST from PN with 86% pretreatment  accuracy (91% specificity, 75% sensitivity) and 89% accuracy on serial analysis  (91% specificity, 83% sensitivity). Healthy controls without NF1 (participants =  16, plasma samples = 16), PN (participants = 23, plasma samples = 23), and MPNST  (participants = 14, plasma samples = 46) cohorts showed significant differences  in tumor fraction in plasma (P = 0.001) as well as cfDNA fragment length (P <  0.001) with MPNST samples harboring shorter fragments and being enriched for  tumor-derived cfDNA relative to PN and healthy controls. No other covariates  were significant on multivariate logistic regression. Mutational analysis  demonstrated focal NF1 copy number loss in PN and MPNST patient plasma but not  in healthy controls. Greater genomic instability including alterations  associated with malignant transformation (focal copy number gains in chromosome  arms 1q, 7p, 8q, 9q, and 17q; focal copy number losses in SUZ12, SMARCA2,  CDKN2A/B, and chromosome arms 6p and 9p) was more prominently observed in MPNST  plasma. Furthermore, the sum of longest tumor diameters (SLD) visualized by  cross-sectional imaging correlated significantly with paired tumor fractions in  plasma from MPNST patients (r = 0.39, P = 0.024). On serial analysis, tumor  fraction levels in plasma dynamically correlated with treatment response to  therapy and minimal residual disease (MRD) detection before relapse. Study  limitations include a modest MPNST sample size despite accrual from 2 major  referral centers for this rare malignancy, and lack of uniform treatment and  imaging protocols representing a real-world cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor fraction levels derived from cfDNA fragment size and copy  number alteration analysis of plasma cfDNA using ULP-WGS significantly  correlated with MPNST tumor burden, accurately distinguished MPNST from its  benign PN precursor, and dynamically correlated with treatment response. In the  future, our findings could form the basis for improved early cancer detection  and monitoring in high-risk cancer-predisposed populations.

Comment in     Neuro Oncol. 2022 Apr 1;24(4):610-611. doi: 10.1093/neuonc/noab296.  BACKGROUND: Non-invasive differentiation between schwannomas and neurofibromas  is important for appropriate management, preoperative counseling, and surgical  planning, but has proven difficult using conventional imaging. The objective of  this study was to develop and evaluate machine learning approaches for  differentiating peripheral schwannomas from neurofibromas. METHODS: We assembled a cohort of schwannomas and neurofibromas from 3  independent institutions and extracted high-dimensional radiomic features from  gadolinium-enhanced, T1-weighted MRI using the PyRadiomics package on  Quantitative Imaging Feature Pipeline. Age, sex, neurogenetic syndrome,  spontaneous pain, and motor deficit were recorded. We evaluated the performance  of 6 radiomics-based classifier models with and without clinical features and  compared model performance against human expert evaluators. RESULTS: One hundred and seven schwannomas and 59 neurofibromas were included.  The primary models included both clinical and imaging data. The accuracy of the  human evaluators (0.765) did not significantly exceed the no-information rate  (NIR), whereas the Support Vector Machine (0.929), Logistic Regression (0.929),  and Random Forest (0.905) classifiers exceeded the NIR. Using the method of  DeLong, the AUCs for the Logistic Regression (AUC = 0.923) and K Nearest  Neighbor (AUC = 0.923) classifiers were significantly greater than the human  evaluators (AUC = 0.766; p = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS: The radiomics-based classifiers developed here proved to be more  accurate and had a higher AUC on the ROC curve than expert human evaluators.  This demonstrates that radiomics using routine MRI sequences and clinical  features can aid in differentiation of peripheral schwannomas and neurofibromas.  © The Author(s) 2021.

MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) 1/2 inhibitors (MEKis)  have recently achieved surprising success in treating unresectable plexiform  neurofibromas (PNFs). However, few studies have investigated the mechanisms of  MEKi resistance in patients with PNF. We determined the efficacy of six  different MEKis for treating PNFs, explored drug resistance mechanisms, and  identified potential combination therapies to overcome resistance. By screening  drug efficacy among six MEKis in human NF1-deficient PNF cell lines, TAK-733 was  found to reduce PNF cell viability the most. We then cultured the  TAK-733‒resistant cells and explored the potential targets for further  treatment. Both high-throughput drug screening and RNA sequencing analyses of  MEKi-resistant PNF cells identified cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors as  potential agents for PNFs. Dinaciclib, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor,  showed synergistic effects on MEKi-resistant cells. Coadministration of  dinaciclib and TAK-733 significantly reduced cell viability and inhibited sphere  formation and colony formation. Dinaciclib did not affect MEK signaling but  decreased the expression of several prosurvival proteins, including survivin and  cyclin-dependent kinase 1, to induce apoptosis and inhibit mitosis.  TAK-733/dinaciclib combination therapy induced tumor reduction in PNF  patient‒derived xenografts mouse models. Therefore, the combination of MEKi and  cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor may be promising for treating inoperable PNFs,  especially when drug resistance exists. Our findings provide evidence for future  clinical trials with MEKi-resistant patients with PNF.  Copyright © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Author information: (1)Department of Laboratory Medicine and Genetics, Samsung Medical Center,  Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, 81 Irwon-ro, Gangnam-gu, Seoul  06351, Korea.  Neurofibromatosis type 1, characterized by neurofibromas and café-au-lait  macules, is one of the most common genetic disorders caused by pathogenic NF1  variants. Because of the high proportion of splicing mutations in NF1,  identifying variants that alter splicing may be an essential issue for  laboratories. Here, we investigated the sensitivity and specificity of SpliceAI,  a recently introduced in silico splicing prediction algorithm in conjunction  with other in silico tools. We evaluated 285 NF1 variants identified from 653  patients. The effect on variants on splicing alteration was confirmed by  complementary DNA sequencing followed by genomic DNA sequencing. For in silico  prediction of splicing effects, we used SpliceAI, MaxEntScan (MES), and Splice  Site Finder-like (SSF). The sensitivity and specificity of SpliceAI were 94.5%  and 94.3%, respectively, with a cut-off value of Δ Score > 0.22. The area under  the curve of SpliceAI was 0.975 (p < 0.0001). Combined analysis of MES/SSF  showed a sensitivity of 83.6% and specificity of 82.5%. The concordance rate  between SpliceAI and MES/SSF was 84.2%. SpliceAI showed better performance for  the prediction of splicing alteration for NF1 variants compared with MES/SSF. As  a convenient web-based tool, SpliceAI may be helpful in clinical laboratories  conducting DNA-based NF1 sequencing.

Li Y(1), Zhu M(1), Lin X(1), Li J(1), Yuan Z(1), Liu Y(1), Xu H(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Pediatric Orthopedics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical  Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510623, P.R. China.  Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disease that is  caused by mutations in the NF1 gene. Various studies have previously  demonstrated that the mTOR complex 1 signaling pathway is essential for the  NF1-modulated osteogenic differentiation of bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs).  Additionally, the mTOR signaling pathway plays a notable role in autophagy. The  present study hypothesized that NF1 could modulate the osteogenic  differentiation of BMSCs by regulating the autophagic activities of BMSCs. In  the present study, human BMSCs were cultured in an osteogenic induction medium.  The expression of the NF1 gene was either knocked down or overexpressed by  transfection with a specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting NF1 or the  pcDNA3.0 NF1-overexpression plasmid, respectively. Autophagic activities of  BMSCs (Beclin-1, P62, LC3B I, and LC3B II) were determined using western  blotting, electron microscopy, acridine orange (AO) staining and autophagic  flux/lysosomal detection by fluorescence microscopy. In addition, the autophagy  activator rapamycin (RAPA) and inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) were used to  investigate the effects of autophagy on NF1-modulated osteogenic differentiation  in BMSCs. Inhibiting NF1 with siRNA significantly decreased the expression  levels of autophagy markers Beclin-1 and LC3B-II, in addition to osteogenic  differentiation markers osterix, runt-related transcription factor 2 and  alkaline phosphatase. By contrast, overexpressing NF1 with pcDNA3.0  significantly increased their levels. Transmission electron microscopy, AO  staining and autophagic flux/lysosomal detection assays revealed that the extent  of autophagosome formation was significantly decreased in the NF1-siRNA group  but significantly increased in the NF1-pcDNA3.0 group when compared with the  NC-siRNA and pcDNA3.0 groups, respectively. In addition, the activity of the  PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway [phosphorylated (p)-PI3K, p-AKT, p-mTOR and p-p70S6  kinase] was significantly upregulated in the NF1-siRNA group compared with the  NC-siRNA group, and significantly inhibited in the NF1-pcDNA3.0 group, compared  with the pcDNA3.0 group. The knockdown effects of NF1-siRNA on the autophagy and  osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs were reversed by the autophagy activator  RAPA, while the overexpression effects of NF1-pcDNA3.0 on the autophagy and  osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs were reversed by the autophagy inhibitor  3-MA. In conclusion, results from the present study suggest at the involvement  of autophagy in the NF1-modulated osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs.  Furthermore, NF1 may partially regulate the autophagic activity of BMSCs through  the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.  Copyright: © Li et al.

BACKGROUND: Patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) and plexiform  neurofibromas (PN) often have radiographically diagnosed distinct nodular  lesions (DNL) which can cause pain and weakness. Magnetic resonance-guided high  intensity focused ultrasound (MR-HIFU) can precisely and accurately deliver heat  to thermally ablate target tissue. The aim of this study is to evaluate  whole-body MRIs from patients with NF1 and DNL, applying volumetrics and a  consistent treatment planning approach to determine the feasibility of MR-HIFU  ablation of DNL. METHODS: A retrospective review of whole-body MRI scans from patients with NF1  and PN from CNH and NCI was performed. DNL are defined as lesions >3 cm,  distinct from PN and lacking the ""central dot"" feature. Criteria for MR-HIFU  thermal ablation include target location 1-8 cm from skin surface; >1 cm from  visible plexus, spinal canal, bladder, bowel, physis; and ability to ablate ≥50%  of lesion volume. Lesions in skull and vertebral body were excluded. RESULTS: In 26 patients, 120 DNL were identified. The majority of DNL were  located in an extremity (52.5%). Other sites included head/neck (7%), chest  (13%), and abdomen/pelvis (28%). The predefined HIFU ablation criteria was not  met for 47.5% of lesions (n = 57). The main limitation was proximity to a vital  structure or organ (79%). Complete and partial HIFU ablation was feasible for  25% and 27.5% of lesions, respectively. CONCLUSION: Based on imaging review of lesion location, technical considerations  and ability to target lesions, thermal ablation with MR-HIFU may be a feasible  noninvasive alternative for symptom management in patients with NF1 and  symptomatic DNL.  © The Author(s) 2021.

BACKGROUND: To examine the impact of executive function disorders on  health-related quality of life (QoL) in children with neurofibromatosis type 1  (NF1), we conducted a prospective single-center study among 40 children with NF1  aged 8-12 years (mean = 9.7, SD = 1.4) and their parents, comparing them with 56  healthy control children matched for age, sex, parental education level, and  handedness. We collected children's self-reports and parents' proxy reports of  QoL with the Kidscreen-52 questionnaire, and measured executive functions by  combining seven performance-based tests and a daily life questionnaire completed  by parents and teachers. RESULTS: Several QoL domains were significantly impaired in the children with  NF1, compared with healthy controls, mainly according to their parents' reports  (3 out of 9 scales; Cohen's d: 0.57-0.76), with particularly low scores in the  social support and peers and school environment domains. Executive function  difficulties (Cohen's d: 0.64-1.72) significantly predicted the impairment of  QoL domains as perceived by the children or their parents, regardless of the  indirect indicators of learning disabilities. CONCLUSIONS: Both performance-based executive function scores and behavioral  ratings of executive functions in daily life by parents and teachers were  associated with low QoL levels in the children with NF1. The school environment  and social integration appear to be particularly affected and should therefore  be targeted in the management of the disease.  © 2021. The Author(s).

Genome editing in pigs has been made efficient, practical, and economically  viable by the CRISPR/Cas9 platform, representing a promising new era in  translational modeling of human disease for research and preclinical development  of therapies and devices. Porcine embryo microinjection provides a universally  available, efficient option over somatic-cell nuclear transfer, but requires  that critical considerations be made in genotypic validation of the models that  routinely go unaddressed. Accurate validation of genotypes is especially  important when modeling genetic disorders, such as neurofibromatosis type 1  (NF1) that exhibits complex genotype-phenotypic relationships. NF1, an autosomal  dominant disorder, is particularly hard to model as it manifests very  differently across patients, and even within families, with over 3,000  disease-associated mutations of the neurofibromin 1 (NF1) gene identified. The  precise nature of the mutations plays a role in the complex phenotypic  presentation of the disorder that includes benign and malignant peripheral and  central nervous system tumors, a variety of motor deficits and debilitating  cognitive impairments and musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal  disorders. NF1 can also often involve mutations in passenger genes such as TP53.  In this manuscript, we describe the creation of three novel porcine models of  NF1 and a model additionally harboring a mutation in TP53 by embryo  microinjection of CRISPR/Cas9. We present the challenges encountered in  validation of genotypes and the methodological strategies developed to counter  the hurdles. We present simple options for quantifying level of mosaicism: a  quantitative method (targeted amplicon sequencing) for small edits such as SNPs  and indels and a semiquantitative method (competitive PCR) for large edits.  Characterization of mosaicism allowed for strategic selection of founder pigs  for rapid, economical expansion of genetically defined lines. We also present  commonly observed unexpected DNA repair products (i.e., structural variants or  cryptic alleles) that are refractory to PCR amplification and thus evade  detection. We present the use of copy number variance assays to overcome hurdles  in detecting cryptic alleles. The report provides a framework for genotypic  validation of porcine models created by embryo microinjection and the expansion  of lines in an efficient manner.

OBJECTIVE: Research indicates that children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)  have weaknesses in fine and gross motor development in early childhood; however,  little is known about the stability and developmental trajectory of motor  functioning. We investigated (1) whether motor difficulties are evident and  stable in the preschool period in children with NF1 and (2) whether there are  particular patterns of motor development in this population. METHODS: Participants with NF1 and a control group of unaffected siblings were  enrolled at ages 3-8 years and were assessed yearly. Motor functioning was  assessed longitudinally using the Scales of Independent Behavior-Revised Motor  Scale and the Differential Ability Scales-II Copying subtest. Wilcoxon sign  tests were used to compare motor functioning at 3 or 4 years to 5 or 6 years old  for children with NF1 seen during both time periods (N = 27). Linear mixed model  growth curve analyses were used to compare trajectories for both children with  NF1 (N = 62) and unaffected siblings (N = 37). RESULTS: Children with NF1 made relative gains in raw scores, but not standard  scores, across measures. Growth curve analyses revealed a significant effect of  NF1 status on gross motor, fine motor, and copying scores, as well as an age by  NF1 status effect on fine and gross motor scores. CONCLUSIONS: Motor difficulties are evident early in life in children with NF1.  Though children with NF1 clearly acquire motor skills over time, they continue  to fall behind unaffected siblings, with the gap potentially widening over time.  Further implications are discussed.  © The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the  Society of Pediatric Psychology. All rights reserved.

Patients with germline neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) microdeletions frequently  exhibit hereditary syndromes such as cardiovascular anomalies and have an  increased risk of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). This study  aimed to identify the genes codeleted with SUZ12 that are related to MPNST. We  used differential gene expression and enrichment analyses to analyze the  SUZ12-mutant and SUZ12-wild-type gene expression profiles in the GSE118186 and  GSE66743 datasets in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). PPI network analysis  combined with MPNST patient survival analysis was used to identify ADCY1, which  catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cAMP, as a key gene. Moreover, chromatin  immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) showed that the distribution of  H3K27me3 in the ADCY1 promoter region and gene body was significantly reduced in  SUZ12-mutant cells. To verify the role of ADCY1 in SUZ12 mutation, we used RNA  interference and plasmid transfection to interfere with SUZ12 expression in  plexiform neurofibroma (pNF) and MPNST cell lines and then treated the cells  with forskolin, IBMX and H89. ERK phosphorylation was accelerated and prolonged  after siRNA transfection, especially in ipNF05.5 cells, and the intensity and  duration of ERK activation were reduced after SUZ12 overexpression. Importantly,  the level of p-ERK was consistent with that of Rap1-GTP. Moreover, H89  completely blocked Rap1 activation and the changes in the p-ERK level after  SUZ12 siRNA transfection. In conclusion, our findings suggested that SUZ12 loss  potentiates the effects of NF1 mutations by amplifying Ras signaling through the  ADCY1/cAMP/Rap1/ERK pathway and that SUZ12 may serve as a therapeutic and  prognostic biomarker in NF1-associated neurofibromas.

(#)Contributed equally  The autosomal dominant monogenetic disease neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)  affects approximately one in 3,000 individuals and is caused by mutations in the  NF1 tumour suppressor gene, leading to dysfunction in the protein neurofibromin  (Nf1)1,2. As a GTPase-activating protein, a key function of Nf1 is repression of  the Ras oncogene signalling cascade. We determined the human Nf1 dimer structure  at an overall resolution of 3.3 Å. The cryo-electron microscopy structure  reveals domain organization and structural details of the Nf1 exon 23a splicing3  isoform 2 in a closed, self-inhibited, Zn-stabilized state and an open state. In  the closed conformation, HEAT/ARM core domains shield the GTPase-activating  protein-related domain (GRD) so that Ras binding is sterically inhibited. In a  distinctly different, open conformation of one protomer, a large-scale movement  of the GRD occurs, which is necessary to access Ras, whereas Sec14-PH reorients  to allow interaction with the cellular membrane4. Zn incubation of Nf1 leads to  reduced Ras-GAP activity with both protomers in the self-inhibited, closed  conformation stabilized by a Zn binding site between the N-HEAT/ARM domain and  the GRD-Sec14-PH linker. The transition between closed, self-inhibited states of  Nf1 and open states provides guidance for targeted studies deciphering the  complex molecular mechanism behind the widespread neurofibromatosis syndrome and  Nf1 dysfunction in carcinogenesis.  © 2021.

(#)Contributed equally  Loss of NF2 (merlin) has been suggested as a genetic cause of neurofibromatosis  type 2 and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). Previously, we  demonstrated that NF2 sustained TGFβ receptor 2 (TβR2) expression and reduction  or loss of NF2 activated non-canonical TGFβ signaling, which reduced Raf kinase  inhibitor protein (RKIP) expression via TβR1 kinase activity. Here, we show that  a selective RKIP inducer (novel chemical, Nf18001) inhibits tumor growth and  promotes schwannoma cell differentiation into mature Schwann cells under  NF2-deficient conditions. In addition, Nf18001 is not cytotoxic to cells  expressing NF2 and is not disturb canonical TGFβ signaling. Moreover, the novel  chemical induces expression of SOX10, a marker of differentiated Schwann cells,  and promotes nuclear export and degradation of SOX2, a stem cell factor.  Treatment with Nf18001 inhibited tumor growth in an allograft model with mouse  schwannoma cells. These results strongly suggest that selective RKIP inducers  could be useful for the treatment of neurofibromatosis type 2 as well as  NF2-deficient MPNST. IMPLICATIONS: This study identifies that a selective RKIP inducer inhibits tumor  growth and promotes schwannoma cell differentiation under NF2-deficient  conditions by reducing SOX2 and increasing SOX10 expression.  ©2021 American Association for Cancer Research.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is caused by loss-of-function variants in the NF1  gene. Approximately 10% of these variants affect RNA splicing and are either  missed by conventional DNA diagnostics or are misinterpreted by in silico  splicing predictions. Therefore, a targeted RNAseq-based approach was designed  to detect pathogenic RNA splicing and associated pathogenic DNA variants. For  this method RNA was extracted from lymphocytes, followed by targeted RNAseq.  Next, an in-house developed tool (QURNAs) was used to calculate the enrichment  score (ERS) for each splicing event. This method was thoroughly tested using two  different patient cohorts with known pathogenic splice-variants in NF1. In both  cohorts all 56 normal reference transcript exon splice junctions, 24 previously  described and 45 novel non-reference splicing events were detected.  Additionally, all expected pathogenic splice-variants were detected. Eleven  patients with NF1 symptoms were subsequently tested, three of which have a known  NF1 DNA variant with a putative effect on RNA splicing. This effect could be  confirmed for all 3. The other eight patients were previously without any  molecular confirmation of their NF1-diagnosis. A deep-intronic pathogenic splice  variant could now be identified for two of them (25%). These results suggest  that targeted RNAseq can be successfully used to detect pathogenic RNA splicing  variants in NF1.  © 2021. The Author(s).

To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the reduced incidence of brain tumors in  children with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and asthma, we leverage Nf1 optic  pathway glioma (Nf1OPG) mice, human and mouse RNAseq data, and two different  experimental asthma models. Following ovalbumin or house dust mite asthma  induction at 4-6 weeks of age (WOA), Nf1OPG mouse optic nerve volumes and  proliferation are decreased at 12 and 24 WOA, indicating no tumor development.  This inhibition is accompanied by reduced expression of the microglia-produced  optic glioma mitogen, Ccl5. Human and murine T cell transcriptome analyses  reveal that inhibition of microglia Ccl5 production results from increased T  cell expression of decorin, which blocks Ccl4-mediated microglia Ccl5 expression  through reduced microglia NFκB signaling. Decorin or NFκB inhibitor treatment of  Nf1OPG mice at 4-6 WOA inhibits tumor formation at 12 WOA, thus establishing a  potential mechanistic etiology for the attenuated glioma incidence observed in  children with asthma.  © 2021.

(4)Euler Technology, Beijing, China.  BACKGROUND: Elucidating the mechanism by which biallelic inactivation evolved  could provide a mechanistic understanding for NF2 tumorigenesis and also a  rationale for clinical management. METHODS: A cohort of 60 NF2 patients was recruited. Next-generation sequencing  of tumor and paired control samples was used to explore how NF2 mutations evolve  in determining the clinical phenotypes. RESULTS: In total, 60 blood samples (one from each patient) and 61 (from 35  patients) NF2-associated tumors were collected. Next-generation sequencing of  the blood samples detected ""first hit"" NF2 mutation in 35/60 donors (58.3%),  82.9% of which (29/35) bear heterozygous germline mutations, and 17.1% (6/35) of  which are mosaics with variable allelic frequency (VAF). While a number of NF2  patients were found without germline mutation, most (57/61, 93.4%)  NF2-associated tumors were identified with NF2 somatic mutation. We calculated  the correlation between the onset latency of mosaic and germline NF2 allele  carriers with the mosaicism VAF. The mosaicism VAF is negatively and linearly  correlated to clinical symptom onset latency (R2 = 0.3677, P = .00351),  suggesting biallelic inactivation probability is a linear function of ""first  hit"" prevalence in the body. The second NF2 somatic mutation occurrence time  positively correlates with the onset of clinical symptoms (R2 = 0.4151, P =  .02633), suggesting tumor growth is linearly proportional to the time after  biallelic inactivation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that biallelic inactivation of NF2 evolved  through neutral drift and preexisting first hit NF2 allele determines certain  aspects of the clinical symptoms. Genetic diagnosis should be included in the  diagnostic criteria and treatment consideration of NF2.  © The Author(s) 2021.

Mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene are linked to arteriopathy. Nf1  heterozygosity (Nf1+/-) results in robust neointima formation, similar to  humans, and myeloid-restricted Nf1+/- recapitulates this phenotype via MEK-ERK  activation. Here we define the contribution of myeloid subpopulations to NF1  arteriopathy. Neutrophils from WT and Nf1+/- mice were functionally assessed in  the presence of MEK and farnesylation inhibitors in vitro and neutrophil  recruitment to lipopolysaccharide was assessed in WT and Nf1+/- mice. Littermate  12-15 week-old male wildtype and Nf1+/- mice were subjected to carotid artery  ligation and provided either a neutrophil depleting antibody (1A8), liposomal  clodronate to deplete monocytes/macrophages, or PD0325901 and neointima size was  assessed 28 days after injury. Bone marrow transplant experiments assessed  monocyte/macrophage mobilization during neointima formation. Nf1+/- neutrophils  exhibit enhanced proliferation, migration, and adhesion via p21Ras activation of  MEK in vitro and in vivo. Neutrophil depletion suppresses circulating Ly6Clow  monocytes and enhances neointima size, while monocyte/macrophage depletion and  deletion of CCR2 in bone marrow cells abolish neointima formation in Nf1+/-  mice. Taken together, these findings suggest that neurofibromin-MEK-ERK  activation in circulating neutrophils and monocytes during arterial remodeling  is nuanced and points to important cross-talk between these populations in the  pathogenesis of NF1 arteriopathy.  © 2021.

SIGNIFICANCE: Current methods for analyzing pathological muscle tissue are time  consuming and rarely quantitative, and they involve invasive biopsies. Faster  and less invasive diagnosis of muscle disease may be achievable using  marker-free in vivo optical sensing methods. AIM: It was speculated that changes in the biochemical composition and structure  of muscle associated with pathology could be measured quantitatively using  visible wavelength optical spectroscopy techniques enabling automated  classification. APPROACH: A fiber-optic autofluorescence (AF) and diffuse reflectance (DR)  spectroscopy device was manufactured. The device and data processing techniques  based on principal component analysis were validated using in situ measurements  on healthy skeletal and cardiac muscle. These methods were then applied to two  mouse models of genetic muscle disease: a type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF1)  limb-mesenchyme knockout (Nf1Prx1  -  /  -  ) and a muscular dystrophy mouse  (mdx). RESULTS: Healthy skeletal and cardiac muscle specimens were separable using AF  and DR with receiver operator curve areas (ROC-AUC) of >0.79. AF and DR analyses  showed optically separable changes in Nf1Prx1  -  /  -   quadriceps muscle  (ROC-AUC >0.97) with no differences detected in the heart (ROC-AUC <0.67), which  does not undergo gene deletion in this model. Changes in AF spectra in mdx  muscle were seen between the 3 week and 10 week time points (ROC-AUC = 0.96) and  were not seen in the wild-type controls (ROC-AUC = 0.58). CONCLUSION: These findings support the utility of in vivo fiber-optic AF and DR  spectroscopy for the assessment of muscle tissue. This report highlights that  there is considerable scope to develop this marker-free optical technology for  preclinical muscle research and for diagnostic assessment of clinical myopathies  and dystrophies.

The progression of benign plexiform neurofibromas to malignant peripheral nerve  sheet tumors (MPNSTs) is a major cause of mortality in patients with NF1.  Although elevated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression plays a  crucial role in the pathogenesis of MPNST, the cause of EGFR overexpression  remains unclear. Here, we assessed EGFR expression levels in MPNST tissues of  NF1 patients and NF1 patient-derived MPNST cells. We found that the expression  of EGFR was upregulated in MPNST tissues and MPNST cells, while the expression  of neurofibromin was significantly decreased. Manipulation of NF1 expression by  NF1 siRNA treatment or NF1-GAP-related domain overexpression demonstrated that  EGFR expression levels were closely and inversely correlated with neurofibromin  levels. Notably, knockdown of the NF1 gene by siRNA treatment augmented the  nuclear localization of phosphorylated SP1 (pSP1) and enhanced pSP1 binding to  the EGFR gene promoter region. Our results suggest that neurofibromin deficiency  in NF1-associated MPNSTs enhances the Ras/ERK/SP1 signaling pathway, which in  turn may lead to the upregulation of EGFR expression. This study provides  insight into the progression of benign tumors and novel therapeutic approaches  for treatment of NF1-associated MPNSTs.

BACKGROUND: Existing research has demonstrated elevated autistic behaviours in  children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), but the autistic phenotype and its  relationship to other neurodevelopmental manifestations of NF1 remains unclear.  To address this gap, we performed detailed characterisation of autistic  behaviours in children with NF1 and investigated their association with other  common NF1 child characteristics. METHODS: Participants were drawn from a larger cross-sectional study examining  autism in children with NF1. The population analysed in this study scored above  threshold on the Social Responsiveness Scale-Second Edition (T-score ≥ 60; 51%  larger cohort) and completed the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R)  and/or the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Second Edition (ADOS-2). All  participants underwent evaluation of their intellectual function, and  behavioural data were collected via parent questionnaires. RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 68 children (3-15 years). Sixty-three per  cent met the ADOS-2 'autism spectrum' cut-off, and 34% exceeded the more  stringent threshold for 'autistic disorder' on the ADI-R. Social communication  symptoms were common and wide-ranging, while restricted and repetitive  behaviours (RRBs) were most commonly characterised by 'insistence on sameness'  (IS) behaviours such as circumscribed interests and difficulties with minor  changes. Autistic behaviours were weakly correlated with hyperactive/impulsive  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms but not with  inattentive ADHD or other behavioural characteristics. Language and verbal IQ  were weakly related to social communication behaviours but not to RRBs. LIMITATIONS: Lack of genetic validation of NF1, no clinical diagnosis of autism,  and a retrospective assessment of autistic behaviours in early childhood. CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide strong support for elevated autistic behaviours in  children with NF1. While these behaviours were relatively independent of other  NF1 comorbidities, the importance of taking broader child characteristics into  consideration when interpreting data from autism-specific measures in this  population is highlighted. Social communication deficits appear similar to those  observed in idiopathic autism and are coupled with a unique RRB profile  comprising prominent IS behaviours. This autistic phenotype and its relationship  to common NF1 comorbidities such as anxiety and executive dysfunction will be  important to examine in future research. Current findings have important  implications for the early identification of autism in NF1 and clinical  management.  © 2021. The Author(s).

PMID:35004058,Assessing Psychiatric Comorbidity and Pharmacologic Treatment Patterns Among Patients With Neurofibromatosis Type 1.,"Assessing Psychiatric Comorbidity and Pharmacologic Treatment Patterns Among  Patients With Neurofibromatosis Type 1.  Houpt AC(1), Schwartz SE(1), Coover RA(2).  Author information: (1)Clinical Sciences, High Point University Fred Wilson School of Pharmacy, High  Point, USA. (2)Basic Pharmaceutical Sciences, High Point University Fred Wilson School of  Pharmacy, High Point, USA.  Background and objective Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder that is  accompanied by psychiatric comorbidities such as depression, anxiety, and  attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in more than half of the  patients. However, there are limited data describing optimal treatment  strategies for these conditions. This study aimed to address that gap in  understanding and explore the neurobiological basis of psychiatric comorbidities  in NF1. Materials and methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted among  NF1 patients with a comorbid diagnosis of depression, anxiety, and/or ADHD.  These disease states were chosen based on their relatively high reported  prevalence in NF1 and shared pathophysiological mechanisms via monoaminergic  dysfunction. Information regarding demographics, psychotherapeutic medication  use, and clinical outcomes was gathered from electronic medical records.  Relationships between patient- and medication-related factors and outcome  measures were assessed using statistical analysis. Results The study population  (n = 82) consisted of NF1 patients with a comorbid diagnosis of depression  (76.8%), anxiety (53.7%), and/or ADHD (23.2%). The use of second-generation  antipsychotic agent augmentation therapy or hydroxyzine monotherapy was  associated with significantly more behavioral health (BH)-related emergency  department (ED) visits, admissions, and inpatient days in the study population.  Conversely, the use of bupropion augmentation therapy, buspirone augmentation  therapy, and stimulants was associated with improved clinical outcomes, though  these results were not statistically significant. Conclusions Based on our  findings in this real-world study setting, patients with NF1 and psychiatric  comorbidities appear to experience significant benefits from medications that  enhance dopaminergic neurotransmission (e.g., bupropion, stimulants) when  compared to drugs that oppose it (e.g., second-generation antipsychotics).

Peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) include schwannomas, neurofibromas (NFs),  and plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs), among others. While they are benign tumors,  according to their biological behavior, some have the potential for malignant  degeneration, mainly PNFs. The specific factors contributing to the more  aggressive behavior of some PNSTs compared to others are not precisely known.  Considering that lipid homeostasis plays a crucial role in fibrotic/inflammatory  processes and in several cancers, we hypothesized that the lipid asset was also  unbalanced in this group of nerve tumors. Through untargeted lipidomics, NFs  presented a significant increase in ceramide, phosphatidylcholine, and Vitamin A  ester. PNFs displayed a marked decrease in 34 out of 50 lipid class analyzed. An  increased level of ether- and oxidized-triacylglycerols was observed;  phosphatidylcholines were reduced. After sphingolipidomic analysis, we observed  six sphingolipid classes. Ceramide and dihydroceramides were statistically  increased in NFs. All the glycosylated species appeared reduced in NFs, but  increased in PNFs. Our findings suggested that different subtypes of PNSTs  presented a specific modulation in the lipidic profile. The untargeted and  targeted lipidomic approaches, which were not applied until now, contribute to  better clarifying bioactive lipid roles in PNS natural history to highlight  disease molecular features and pathogenesis.

Retraction in     J Neuroimaging. 2026 Jan-Feb;36(1):e70123. doi: 10.1111/jon.70123.  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to assess the utility of  diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic  resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) to distinguish sporadic vestibular schwannomas (VSs)  from those related to neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 265 patients pathologically diagnosed with  VSs between January 2015 and October 2020 in a single institution. There were 28  patients (male: 19, female: 9; age 11-67 years) including 23 sporadic and five  NF2-related VSs, who had pretreatment DWI and DCE-MRI. Normalized mean apparent  diffusion coefficient (nADCmean) and DCE-MRI parameters along with tumor  characteristics were compared between sporadic and NF2-related VSs as  appropriate. The diagnostic performances were calculated based on the receiver  operating characteristic curve analysis for the values that showed significant  differences. To identify significant modalities, multivariate logistic  regression analysis was performed using nADCmean and the combination of  statistically significant DCE-MRI parameters. RESULTS: NADCmean, fractional volume of extracellular space (Ve), and forward  volume transfer constant (Ktrans) were significantly different between sporadic  and NF2-related VSs (nADCmean: median 1.62 vs. 1.16, P = .002; Ve: median 0.40  vs. 0.66, P = .007; Ktrans: median 0.17 vs. 0.33, P = .007), whereas fractional  plasma volume (Vp), reverse reflux rate constant (Kep), and tumor  characteristics were not. The diagnostic performances of nADCmean, Ve, and  Ktrans were 0.93, 0.90, and 0.90 area under the curves with cutoffs of 1.46,  0.51, and 0.29, respectively. nADCmean and the combination of Ve and Ktrans were  both chosen as significant differentiators by multivariate logistic regression  analysis (P = .027). CONCLUSIONS: DWI and DCE-MRI are both promising modalities to distinguish  sporadic and NF2-related VSs.  © 2022 American Society of Neuroimaging.

Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis,  Missouri, USA. (2)Department of Pathology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis,  Missouri, USA.  BACKGROUND: Brain tumor formation and progression are dictated by cooperative  interactions between neoplastic and non-neoplastic cells. This stromal  dependence is nicely illustrated by tumors arising in the Neurofibromatosis type  1 (NF1) cancer predisposition syndrome, where children develop low-grade optic  pathway gliomas (OPGs). Using several authenticated Nf1-OPG murine models, we  previously demonstrated that murine Nf1-OPG growth is regulated by T cell  function and microglia Ccl5 production, such that their inhibition reduces tumor  proliferation in vivo. While these interactions are critical for established  Nf1-OPG tumor growth, their importance in tumor formation has not been explored. METHODS: A combination of bulk and single-cell RNA mouse optic nerve sequencing,  immunohistochemistry, T cell assays, and pharmacologic and antibody-mediated  inhibition methods were used in these experiments. RESULTS: We show that T cells and microglia are the main non-neoplastic immune  cell populations in both murine and human LGGs. Moreover, we demonstrate that  CD8+ T cells, the predominant LGG-infiltrating lymphocyte population, are  selectively recruited through increased Ccl2 receptor (Ccr4) expression in CD8+,  but not CD4+, T cells, in a NF1/RAS-dependent manner. Finally, we identify the  times during gliomagenesis when microglia Ccl5 production (3-6 weeks of age) and  Ccl2-mediated T cell infiltration (7-10 weeks of age) occur, such that  temporally-restricted Ccl2 or Ccl5 inhibition abrogates tumor formation >3.5  months following the cessation of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these findings provide proof-of-concept  demonstrations that targeting stromal support during early gliomagenesis durably  blocks murine LGG formation.  © The Author(s) 2021.

Mobile element insertions (MEIs) are a major class of structural variants (SVs)  and have been linked to many human genetic disorders, including hemophilia,  neurofibromatosis, and various cancers. However, human MEI resources from  large-scale genome sequencing are still lacking compared to those for SNPs and  SVs. Here, we report a comprehensive map of 36 699 non-reference MEIs  constructed from 5675 genomes, comprising 2998 Chinese samples (∼26.2×, NyuWa)  and 2677 samples from the 1000 Genomes Project (∼7.4×, 1KGP). We discovered that  LINE-1 insertions were highly enriched in centromere regions, implying the role  of chromosome context in retroelement insertion. After functional annotation, we  estimated that MEIs are responsible for about 9.3% of all protein-truncating  events per genome. Finally, we built a companion database named HMEID for public  use. This resource represents the latest and largest genomewide study on MEIs  and will have broad utility for exploration of human MEI findings.  © The Author(s) 2022.

Huang PY(1), Shih IA(1), Liao YC(1), You HL(1), Lee MJ(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, National Taiwan University Hospital, National Taiwan  University College of Medicine Taipei, Taiwan.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous disorder.  Clinically, the hallmarks of NF1 include skin pigmentation and cutaneous  neurofibroma. Some NF1 patients develop plexiform neurofibroma (PN) since early  childhood. Pathologically, PN contains abundant Schwann cells, blood vessels and  connective tissues, which may transform into a malignant peripheral nerve sheath  tumor (MPNST). MPNST is a highly invasive sarcoma without any effective therapy.  Recently, both in vitro and in vivo studies showed that cordycepin can inhibit  the growth of MPNST cells. Cordycepin causes cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and  downregulates the protein levels of α-tubulin, p53 and Sp1. Herein, the present  study revealed that the HDAC11 inhibitor, FT895, can synergistically enhance the  tumoricidal effect of cordycepin against MPNST cells in vitro. Treatment with  the combination of cordycepin and FT895 reduced the size of MPNST in the  xenograft mouse model. The combined treatment decreased the protein levels of  α-tubulin and KIF18A, which may disrupt the microtubule organization leading to  the mis-segregation of chromosomes and aneuploidy. Moreover, the expression  levels of TEAD1 and its co-activator TAZ, the candidate proteins in hippo  signaling pathway, were suppressed after combined treatment. Sequence analysis  found a few binding sites for the transcription factor, TEAD1 in the promoter  regions of TUBA1B, KIF18A, TEAD1, TAZ, YAP, TP53 and SP1 genes. ChIP-qPCR assay  showed that the combined treatment decreases the binding of TEAD1 to the  promoters of TUBA1B, KIF18A, TEAD1, TAZ and YAP genes in STS26T cells. The  reduced binding to TP53 and SP1 promoters was also found in S462TY cells, which  was further confirmed by immunoblotting. The down-regulation of these important  transcriptional factors may contribute to the vulnerability of MPNST. In  summary, HDAC11 inhibitor, FT895 can potentiate the tumoricidal effect of  cordycepin to suppress the MPNST cell growth, which was probably mediated by the  dysfunction of hippo-signaling pathway.

Clinical classification of missense variants often represents a challenge, due  to lack of evidence for pathogenicity and function. This study provides a  summary of NF2 missense variants, with variant classifications based on  currently available evidence. NF2 missense variants were collated from  pathology-associated databases and existing literature. Association for Clinical  Genomic Sciences Best Practice Guidelines (2020) were followed in the  application of evidence for variant interpretation and classification. The  majority of NF2 missense variants remain classified as variants of uncertain  significance. However, NF2 missense variants identified in gnomAD occurred at a  consistent rate across the gene, while variants compiled from  pathology-associated databases displayed differing rates of variation by exon of  NF2. The highest rate of NF2 disease-associated variants was observed in exon 7,  while lower rates were observed toward the C-terminus of the NF2 protein,  merlin. Further phenotypic information associated with variants, alongside  variant-specific functional analysis, is necessary for more definitive variant  interpretation. Our data identified differences in frequency of NF2 missense  variants by exon between gnomAD population data and NF2 disease-associated  variants, suggesting a potential genotype-phenotype correlation; further work is  necessary to substantiate this.  © 2022 The Authors.

Mutations in the NF1 gene cause the familial genetic disease neurofibromatosis  type I, as well as predisposition to cancer. The NF1 gene product,  neurofibromin, is a GTPase-activating protein and acts as a tumor suppressor by  negatively regulating the small GTPase, Ras. However, structural insights into  neurofibromin activation remain incompletely defined. Here, we provide  cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures that reveal an extended  neurofibromin homodimer in two functional states: an auto-inhibited state with  occluded Ras-binding site and an asymmetric open state with an exposed  Ras-binding site. Mechanistically, the transition to the active conformation is  stimulated by nucleotide binding, which releases a lock that tethers the  catalytic domain to an extended helical repeat scaffold in the occluded state.  Structure-guided mutational analysis supports functional relevance of allosteric  control. Disease-causing mutations are mapped and primarily impact neurofibromin  stability. Our findings suggest a role for nucleotides in neurofibromin  regulation and may lead to therapeutic modulation of Ras signaling.  Copyright © 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive, invasive  cancer that comprise around 10% of all soft tissue sarcomas and develop in about  8-13% of patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 1. They are associated with poor  prognosis and are the leading cause of mortality in NF1 patients. MPNSTs can  also develop sporadically or following exposure to radiation. There is currently  no effective targeted therapy to treat MPNSTs and surgical removal remains the  mainstay treatment. Unfortunately, surgery is not always possible due to the  size and location of the tumor, thus, a better understanding of MPNST initiation  and development is required to design novel therapeutics. Here, we provide an  overview of MPNST biology and genetics, discuss findings regarding the  developmental origin of MPNST, and summarize the various model systems employed  to study MPNST. Finally, we discuss current management strategies for MPNST, as  well as recent developments in translating basic research findings into  potential therapies.  © 2022.

BACKGROUND: Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) develop benign (BPNST),  premalignant atypical (ANF), and malignant (MPNST) peripheral nerve sheath  tumors. Radiological differentiation of these entities is challenging.  Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the value of a magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI)-based radiomics machine-learning (ML) classifier for differentiation of  these three entities of internal peripheral nerve sheath tumors in NF1 patients. METHODS: MRI was performed at 3T in 36 NF1 patients (20 male; age: 31 ± 11  years). Segmentation of 117 BPNSTs, 17 MPNSTs, and 8 ANFs was manually performed  using T2w spectral attenuated inversion recovery sequences. One hundred seven  features per lesion were extracted using PyRadiomics and applied for BPNST  versus MPNST differentiation. A 5-feature radiomics signature was defined based  on the most important features and tested for signature-based BPNST versus MPNST  classification (random forest [RF] classification, leave-one-patient-out  evaluation). In a second step, signature feature expressions for BPNSTs, ANFs,  and MPNSTs were evaluated for radiomics-based classification for these three  entities. RESULTS: The mean area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC)  for the radiomics-based BPNST versus MPNST differentiation was 0.94,  corresponding to correct classification of on average 16/17 MPNSTs and 114/117  BPNSTs (sensitivity: 94%, specificity: 97%). Exploratory analysis with the eight  ANFs revealed intermediate radiomic feature characteristics in-between BPNST and  MPNST tumor feature expression. CONCLUSION: In this proof-of-principle study, ML using MRI-based radiomics  characteristics allows sensitive and specific differentiation of BPNSTs and  MPNSTs in NF1 patients. Feature expression of premalignant atypical tumors was  distributed in-between benign and malignant tumor feature expressions, which  illustrates biological plausibility of the considered radiomics characteristics.  © The Author(s) 2022.

Our study reviewed abnormalities in spontaneous, as well as event-related, brain  activity in syndromes with a known genetic underpinning that are associated with  autistic symptomatology. Based on behavioral and neurophysiological evidence, we  tentatively subdivided the syndromes on primarily hyper-sensitive (Fragile X,  Angelman) and hypo-sensitive (Phelan-McDermid, Rett, Tuberous Sclerosis,  Neurofibromatosis 1), pointing to the way of segregation of heterogeneous  idiopathic ASD, that includes both hyper-sensitive and hypo-sensitive  individuals. This segmentation links abnormalities in different genes, such as  FMR1, UBE3A, GABRB3, GABRA5, GABRG3, SHANK3, MECP2, TSC1, TSC2, and NF1, that  are causative to the above-mentioned syndromes and associated with synaptic  transmission and cell growth, as well as with translational and transcriptional  regulation and with sensory sensitivity. Excitation/inhibition imbalance related  to GABAergic signaling, and the interplay of tonic and phasic inhibition in  different brain regions might underlie this relationship. However, more research  is needed. As most genetic syndromes are very rare, future investigations in  this field will benefit from multi-site collaboration with a common protocol for  electrophysiological and event-related potential (EEG/ERP) research that should  include an investigation into all modalities and stages of sensory processing,  as well as potential biomarkers of GABAergic signaling (such as 40-Hz ASSR).

Vestibular schwannoma (VS), one of characteristic tumors of neurofibromatosis  type 2 (NF2), is an intracranial tumor that arises from Schwann cells of the  vestibular nerve. VS results in hearing loss, tinnitus, dizziness, and even  death, but there are currently no FDA-approved drugs for treatment. In this  study, we established a high-throughput screening to discover effective  compounds that could inhibit the viability of VS cells. Among 1019 natural  products from the Korea Chemical Bank screened, we found that celastrol, a  pentacyclic triterpene derived from a Tripterygium Wilfordi plant, exerted  potent inhibitory effect on the viability of VS cells with an IC50 value of  0.5  µM. Celastrol (0.5, 1  µM) dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of  primary VS cells derived from VS patients. Celastrol also inhibited the growth,  and induced apoptosis of two other VS cell lines (HEI-193 and SC4). Aberrant  activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been found in VS isolated from  clinically defined NF2 patients. In HEI-193 and SC4 cells, we demonstrated that  celastrol (0.1, 0.5 μM) dose-dependently inhibited TOPFlash reporter activity  and protein expression of β-catenin, but not mRNA level of β-catenin.  Furthermore, celastrol accelerated the degradation of β-catenin by promoting the  formation of the β-catenin destruction complex. In nude mice bearing VS cell  line SC4 allografts, administration of celastrol (1.25 mg · kg-1 · d-1, i.p.  once every 3 days for 2 weeks) significantly suppressed the tumor growth without  showing toxicity. Collectively, this study demonstrates that celastrol can  inhibit Wnt/β-catenin signaling by promoting the degradation of β-catenin,  consequently inhibiting the growth of VS.  © 2022.

(#)Contributed equally  Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are soft-tissue sarcomas that  are the leading cause of mortality in patients with Neurofibromatosis type 1  (NF1). Single chemotherapeutic agents have shown response rates ranging from 18%  to 44% in clinical trials, so there is still a high medical need to identify  chemotherapeutic combination treatments that improve clinical prognosis and  outcome. We screened a collection of compounds from the NCATS Mechanism  Interrogation PlatE (MIPE) library in three MPNST cell lines, using cell  viability and apoptosis assays. We then tested whether compounds that were  active as single agents were synergistic when screened as pairwise combinations.  Synergistic combinations in vitro were further evaluated in patient-derived  orthotopic xenograft/orthoxenograft (PDOX) athymic models engrafted with primary  MPNST matching with their paired primary-derived cell line where synergism was  observed. The high-throughput screening identified 21 synergistic combinations,  from which four exhibited potent synergies in a broad panel of MPNST cell lines.  One of the combinations, MK-1775 with Doxorubicin, significantly reduced tumor  growth in a sporadic PDOX model (MPNST-SP-01; sevenfold) and in an NF1-PDOX  model (MPNST-NF1-09; fourfold) and presented greater effects in TP53 mutated  MPNST cell lines. The other three combinations, all involving Panobinostat  (combined with NVP-BGT226, Torin 2, or Carfilzomib), did not reduce the tumor  volume in vivo at noncytotoxic doses. Our results support the utility of our  screening platform of in vitro and in vivo models to explore new therapeutic  approaches for MPNSTs and identified that combination MK-1775 with Doxorubicin  could be a good pharmacologic option for the treatment of these tumors.  ©2022 American Association for Cancer Research.

PURPOSE: NF1 variants in tumors are important to recognize, as multiple  mechanisms may give rise to biallelic variants. Both deletions and copy-neutral  loss of heterozygosity (LOH) are potential mechanisms of NF1 loss, distinct from  point mutations, and additional genes altered may drive different tumor types.  This study investigates whether tumors from individuals with neurofibromatosis  type 1 (NF1) demonstrate additional gene variants and detects NF1 second hits  using paired germline and somatic sequencing. In addition, rare tumor types in  NF1 may also be characterized by tumor sequencing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sequences of 529 cancer driver genes were analyzed in  6,381 tumors, yielding 391 NF1-mutated tumors in which NF1 LOH analysis was  performed. Driver genes were evaluated by tumor type including malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumors and gliomas. RESULTS: NF1 LOH was seen in 133 of 391 tumor samples in the cohort. Individuals  with NF1 had more prevalent copy-neutral LOH (P < .0001), suggesting somatic  intrachromosomal recombination. Osteosarcoma in NF1 also had NF1 LOH and  additional p53 alteration. NF1 second hit data from tumors were informative for  inferring deleteriousness of missense variants that were conflicting in ClinVar,  potentially helping to add to NF1 annotation. Although criteria for evaluating  germline and somatic variants are different, deleterious effects on NF1 function  may be shared. CONCLUSION: Sequencing of NF1-associated tumors demonstrated a spectrum of  second hits in NF1 and the prevalence of copy-neutral LOH. Future work may be  aimed at further understanding of LOH mechanisms and strategies to mitigate  tumor risk.

(#)Contributed equally  Neuronal activity is emerging as a driver of central and peripheral nervous  system cancers. Here, we examined neuronal physiology in mouse models of the  tumor predisposition syndrome Neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1), with different  propensities to develop nervous system cancers. We show that central and  peripheral nervous system neurons from mice with tumor-causing Nf1 gene  mutations exhibit hyperexcitability and increased secretion of  activity-dependent tumor-promoting paracrine factors. We discovered a  neurofibroma mitogen (COL1A2) produced by peripheral neurons in an  activity-regulated manner, which increases NF1-deficient Schwann cell  proliferation, establishing that neurofibromas are regulated by neuronal  activity. In contrast, mice with the Arg1809Cys Nf1 mutation, found in NF1  patients lacking neurofibromas or optic gliomas, do not exhibit neuronal  hyperexcitability or develop these NF1-associated tumors. The hyperexcitability  of tumor-prone Nf1-mutant neurons results from reduced NF1-regulated  hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel function, such  that neuronal excitability, activity-regulated paracrine factor production, and  tumor progression are attenuated by HCN channel activation. Collectively, these  findings reveal that NF1 mutations act at the level of neurons to modify tumor  predisposition by increasing neuronal excitability and activity-regulated  paracrine factor production.  © 2022.

Neurofibromin, the main RasGAP in the nervous system, is a 2818 aa protein with  several poorly characterized functional domains. Mutations in the NF1-encoding  gene lead to an autosomal dominant syndrome, neurofibromatosis, with an  incidence of 1 out of 3000 newborns. Missense mutations spread in the  Sec14-PH-encoding sequences as well. Structural data could not highlight the  defect in mutant Sec14-PH functionality. By performing molecular dynamics  simulations at different temperatures, we found that the lid-lock is fundamental  for the structural interdependence of the NF1 bipartite Sec14-PH domain. In  fact, increased flexibility in the lid-lock loop, observed for the K1750Δ  mutant, leads to disconnection of the two subdomains and can affect the  stability of the Sec14 subdomain.

INTRODUCTION: Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a single-gene disorder associated  with cognitive impairments, particularly with deficits in working memory. Prior  research indicates that brain structure is affected in NF1, but it is unclear  how these changes relate to aspects of cognition. METHODS: 29 adolescents aged 11-17 years were compared to age and sex-matched  controls. NF1 subjects were assessed using detailed multimodal measurements of  working memory at baseline followed by a 3T MR scan. A voxel-based morphometry  approach was used to estimate the total and regional gray matter(GM) volumetric  differences between the NF1 and control groups. The working memory metrics were  subjected to a principal component analysis (PCA) approach. RESULTS: The NF1 groups showed increased gray matter volumes in the thalamus,  corpus striatum, dorsal midbrain and cerebellum bilaterally in the NF1 group as  compared to controls. Principal component analysis on the working memory metrics  in the NF1 group yielded three independent factors reflecting high memory load,  low memory load and auditory working memory. Correlation analyses revealed that  increased volume of posterior cingulate cortex, a key component of the default  mode network (DMN) was significantly associated with poorer performance on low  working memory load tasks. CONCLUSION: These results are consistent with prior work showing larger  subcortical brain volumes in the NF1 cohort. The strong association between  posterior cingulate cortex volume and performance on low memory load conditions  supports hypotheses of deficient DMN structural development, which in turn may  contribute to the cognitive impairments in NF1.  © The Author(s) 2022.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a dominant hereditary disease characterized by  the mutation of the NF1 gene, affecting 1/3000 individuals worldwide. Most NF1  patients are predisposed to benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs),  including cutaneous neurofibromas (CNFs) and plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs).  However, 5%-10% of PNFs will ultimately develop into malignant peripheral nerve  sheath tumors (MPNSTs), which have a poor prognosis. Early and reliable  differentiation of benign and malignant tumors in NF1 patients is of great  necessity. Pathological evaluation is the ""gold standard"" for a definite  diagnosis, but the invasive nature of the biopsy procedure restricts it from  applying as a screening tool during the decades-long follow-up of these  patients. Non-invasive image-based diagnostic methods such as CT and MRI are  often considered essential screening tools for multiple types of tumors. For NF1  patients' lifelong regular follow-ups, these radiological methods are currently  used for tumor evaluation. However, no consensus was established on screening  the malignant transformation of benign PNSTs. Moreover, novel technologies like  radiogenomics and PET-MRI have not been well evaluated and fully adopted for NF1  patients. This review summarizes current studies of different imaging methods  for differentiating benign and malignant tumors in NF1. Meanwhile, we discussed  the prospects of the usage of new tools such as radiogenomics and PET-MRI to  distinguish MPNST from benign PNSTs more precisely. Summarizing these findings  will help clarify the directions of future studies in this area and ultimately  contribute to the radiology images-based clinical screening of MPNST in NF1  patients and finally improve the overall survival rates of these patients.

BACKGROUND: A high proportion of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)  present with functional hearing deficiency as a result of neural abnormality in  the late auditory brainstem. METHODS: In this randomized, two-period crossover study, we investigated the  hypothesis that remote-microphone listening devices can ameliorate hearing and  communication deficits in affected school-aged children (7-17 years). Speech  perception ability in background noise was evaluated in device-active and  inactive conditions using the CNC-word test. Participants were then randomized  to one of two treatment sequences: (1) inactive device for two weeks (placebo),  followed by active device use for two weeks, or (2) active device for 2 weeks,  followed by inactive device for 2 weeks. Listening and communication ratings  (LIFE-R Questionnaire) were obtained at baseline and at the end of each  treatment phase. RESULTS: Each participant demonstrated functional hearing benefits with  remote-microphone use. All showed a speech perception in noise increase when the  device was activated with a mean phoneme-score difference of 16.4% (p < 0.001)  and reported improved listening/communication abilities in the school classroom  (mean difference: 23.4%; p = 0.017). DISCUSSION: Conventional hearing aids are typically ineffective as a treatment  for auditory neural dysfunction, making sounds louder, but not clearer for  affected individuals. In this study, we demonstrate that remote-microphone  technologies are acceptable/tolerable in pediatric patients with NF1 and can  ameliorate their hearing deficits. CONCLUSION: Remote-microphone listening systems offer a viable treatment option  for children with auditory deficits associated with NF1.  © 2022. The Author(s).

Experimental tools and resources, such as animal models, cell lines, antibodies,  genetic reagents and biobanks, are key ingredients in biomedical research.  Investigators face multiple challenges when trying to understand the  availability, applicability and accessibility of these tools. A major challenge  is keeping up with current information about the numerous tools available for a  particular research problem. A variety of disease-agnostic projects such as the  Mouse Genome Informatics database and the Resource Identification Initiative  curate a number of types of research tools. Here, we describe our efforts to  build upon these resources to develop a disease-specific research tool resource  for the neurofibromatosis (NF) research community. This resource, the NF  Research Tools Database, is an open-access database that enables the exploration  and discovery of information about NF type 1-relevant animal models, cell lines,  antibodies, genetic reagents and biobanks. Users can search and explore tools,  obtain detailed information about each tool as well as read and contribute their  observations about the performance, reliability and characteristics of tools in  the database. NF researchers will be able to use the NF Research Tools Database  to promote, discover, share, reuse and characterize research tools, with the  goal of advancing NF research.

Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common genetic tumor  predisposition syndromes, affecting up to 1 in 2500 individuals. Up to half of  patients with NF1 develop benign nerve sheath tumors called plexiform  neurofibromas (PNs), characterized by biallelic NF1 loss. PNs can grow to  immense sizes, cause extensive morbidity, and harbor a 15% lifetime risk of  malignant transformation. Increasingly, molecular sequencing and drug screening  data from various preclinical murine and human PN cell lines, murine models, and  human PN tissues are available to help identify salient treatments for PNs.  Despite this, Selumetinib, a MEK inhibitor, is the only currently FDA-approved  pharmacotherapy for symptomatic and inoperable PNs in pediatric NF1 patients.  The discovery of alternative and additional treatments has been hampered by the  rarity of the disease, which makes prioritizing drugs to be tested in future  clinical trials immensely important. Here, we propose a gene regulatory  network-based integrated analysis to mine high-throughput cell line-based drug  data combined with transcriptomes from resected human PN tumors. Conserved  network modules were characterized and served as drug fingerprints reflecting  the biological connections among drug effects and the inherent properties of PN  cell lines and tissue. Drug candidates were ranked, and the therapeutic  potential of drug combinations was evaluated via computational predication.  Auspicious therapeutic agents and drug combinations were proposed for further  investigation in preclinical and clinical trials.

(#)Contributed equally  Schwann cell precursors (SCPs) are nerve-associated progenitors that can  generate myelinating and non-myelinating Schwann cells but also are multipotent  like the neural crest cells from which they originate. SCPs are omnipresent  along outgrowing peripheral nerves throughout the body of vertebrate embryos. By  using single-cell transcriptomics to generate a gene expression atlas of the  entire neural crest lineage, we show that early SCPs and late migratory crest  cells have similar transcriptional profiles characterised by a multipotent ""hub""  state containing cells biased towards traditional neural crest fates. SCPs keep  diverging from the neural crest after being primed towards terminal Schwann  cells and other fates, with different subtypes residing in distinct anatomical  locations. Functional experiments using CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function further  show that knockout of the common ""hub"" gene Sox8 causes defects in neural  crest-derived cells along peripheral nerves by facilitating differentiation of  SCPs towards sympathoadrenal fates. Finally, specific tumour populations found  in melanoma, neurofibroma and neuroblastoma map to different stages of  SCP/Schwann cell development. Overall, SCPs resemble migrating neural crest  cells that maintain multipotency and become transcriptionally primed towards  distinct lineages.  ©2022 The Authors.

Author information: (1)Department of Adult Neurosurgery, National Neuroscience Institute, King Fahad  Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis (NF) is an umbrella term that refers to three  distinct disease entities: NF Type 1, Type 2, and schwannomatosis. Here, we  reviewed the scientific performance and the most influential publications on NF. METHODS: A keyword-based search was performed using the Scopus database. The top  100 articles were grouped based on NF types and the studied entities. The  differences between the articles, authors, and journals were quantified based on  certain parameters. Other parameters were collected for the complete citational  analysis. RESULTS: The top 100 articles were published between 1961 and 2020. The most  trending period of research was in the 1990s and articles studying the clinical  aspect and the underlying genetic correlation made up 84% of all articles from  the list. The United States of America (USA) had the highest number of  contributions (69 articles, 69%). The top institute of contribution to the list  was the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, USA (14 articles, 14%). Author-based  analysis reveals that the neurologist D. H. Gutmann from St. Louis Children's  Hospital, USA, was the most active and authored 11 articles (11%) on the list. CONCLUSION: The publication trends show that articles studying medical and  surgical management were of little interest. The top 100 articles did not  include any randomized control trials, and the highest level of evidence was  obtained from reviews of pooled knowledge as well as population-based and  longitudinal studies.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant genetic  disease characterized by development of schwannomas on the VIIIth (vestibular)  cranial nerves. Bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) proteins regulate  gene transcription and their activity is required in a variety of cancers  including malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. The use of BET inhibitors as  a therapeutic option to treat NF2 schwannomas has not been explored and is the  focus of this study. METHODS: A panel of normal and NF2-null Schwann and schwannoma cell lines were  used to characterize the impact of the BET inhibitor JQ1 in vitro and in vivo.  The mechanism of action was explored by chromatin immunoprecipitation of the BET  BRD4, phospho-kinase arrays and immunohistochemistry (IHC) of BRD4 in vestibular  schwannomas. RESULTS: JQ1 inhibited proliferation of NF2-null schwannoma and Schwann cell  lines in vitro and in vivo. Further, loss of NF2 by CRISPR deletion or siRNA  knockdown increased sensitivity of cells to JQ1. Loss of function experiments  identified BRD4, and to a lesser extent BRD2, as BET family members mediating  the majority of JQ1 effects. IHC demonstrated elevated levels of BRD4 protein in  human vestibular schwannomas. Analysis of signaling pathways effected by JQ1  treatment suggests that the effects of JQ1 treatment are mediated, at least in  part, via inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling. CONCLUSIONS: NF2-deficient Schwann and schwannoma cells are sensitive to BET  inhibition, primarily mediated by BRD4, which is overexpressed in human  vestibular schwannomas. Our results suggest BRD4 regulates PI3K signaling and  likely impedes NF2 schwannoma growth via this inhibition. These findings  implicate BET inhibition as a therapeutic option for NF2-deficient schwannomas.  © The Author(s) 2022.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are rare soft-tissue sarcomas  refractory to standard therapies. Inactivation of NF1 and subsequent  upregulation of RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling exist in the majority of MPNSTs.  However, the lack of preclinical assessment of MEK inhibitors in MPNSTs hinders  the clinical application as well as the development of combination therapy. To  guide further clinical studies, we evaluated different MEK inhibitors in terms  of efficacy, safety, and mechanism of adaptive response in treating MPNSTs.  Using a MPNST tissue microarray, we found that p-ERK could serve as a biomarker  for predicting the prognosis of MPNST patients as well as an effective  therapeutic target. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, we identified  trametinib as the most potent MEK inhibitor for the treatment of MPNSTs.  Mechanistically, reduced reactivation of the MAPK pathway and compensatory  activation of the parallel pathways contributed to better efficacy. Our results  provide a basis for the further clinical application of MEK inhibitors as single  agents or combinational therapies.

Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) is a rare tumor disorder caused by pathogenic  variants of the merlin tumor suppressor encoded by NF2. Patients develop  vestibular schwannomas (VS), peripheral schwannomas, meningiomas, and  ependymomas. There are no approved drug therapies for NF2. Previous work  identified phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) as a druggable target. Here we  screened PI3K pathway inhibitors for efficacy in reducing viability of human  schwannoma cells. The lead compound, CUDC907, a dual histone deacetylase  (HDAC)/PI3K inhibitor, was further evaluated for its effects on isolated and  nerve-grafted schwannoma model cells, and primary VS cells. CUDC907 (3 nM IG50)  reduced human merlin deficient Schwann cell (MD-SC) viability and was 5-100 fold  selective for MD over WT-SCs. CUDC907 (10 nM) promoted cell cycle arrest and  caspase-3/7 activation within 24 h in human MD-SCs. Western blots confirmed a  dose-dependent increase in acetylated lysine and decreases in pAKT and YAP.  CUDC907 decreased tumor growth rate by 44% in a 14-day treatment regimen,  modulated phospho-target levels, and decreased YAP levels. In five primary VS,  CUDC907 decreased viability, induced caspase-3/7 cleavage, and reduced YAP  levels. Its efficacy correlated with basal phospho-HDAC2 levels. CUDC907 has  cytotoxic activity in NF2 schwannoma models and primary VS cells and is a  candidate for clinical trials.  Copyright: © 2022 Huegel et al.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by  skin pigmentary lesions and multiple cutaneous neurofibromas, is caused by  neurofibromin 1 (NF1) loss of function variants. Currently, a molecular  diagnosis is frequently established using a multistep protocol based on cDNA and  gDNA sequence analysis and/or Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification  (MLPA) assay on genomic DNA, providing an overall detection rate of about  95-97%. The small proportion of clinically diagnosed patients, which at present  do not obtain a molecular confirmation likely are mosaic, as their pathogenic  variant may remain undetected due to low sensitivity of low coverage NGS  approaches, or they may carry a type of pathogenic variant refractory to  currently used technologies. Here, we report two unrelated patients presenting  with two different inversions that disrupt the NF1 coding sequence, resulting in  an NF1 phenotype. In one subject, the inversion was associated with  microdeletions spanning a few NF1 exons at both breakpoints, while in the other  the rearrangement did not cause exon loss, thus testing negative by MLPA assay.  Considering the high proportion of repeated regions within the NF1 sequence, we  propose that intragenic structural rearrangements should be considered as  possible pathogenic mechanisms in patients fulfilling the NIH diagnostic  criteria of NF1 but lacking of molecular confirmation and in patients with NF1  intragenic microdeletions.  © 2022.

Author information: (1)Department of Basic Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fred Wilson School of Pharmacy,  High Point University, High Point, NC 27268, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is among the most common neurogenic disorders,  characterized by loss of function mutations in the neurofibromin gene (NF1). NF1  patients are extremely susceptible to developing neurofibromas, which can  transform into deadly malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). At the  center of these tumors are NF1-null Schwann cells. Here, we found that  nanomedicine shows promise in the treatment of NF1-associated MPNSTs. We  assessed the cytotoxicity of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in NF1-null  NF1-associated MPNSTs, NF1-wildtype sporadic MPNST, and normal Schwann cells.  Our data show that AgNP are selectivity cytotoxic to NF1-associated MPNSTs  relative to sporadic MPNST and Schwann cells. Furthermore, we found that  sensitivity to AgNPs is correlated with the expression levels of functional  neurofibromin. The restoration of functional neurofibromin in NF1-associated  MPNSTs reduces AgNP sensitivity, and the knockdown of neurofibromin in Schwann  cells increases AgNP sensitivity. This finding is unique to AgNPs, as NF1  restoration does not alter sensitivity to standard of care chemotherapy  doxorubicin in NF1-associated MPNSTs. Using an in vitro model system, we then  found that AgNP can selectively eradicate NF1-associated MPNSTs in co-culture  with Schwann cells at doses tolerable to normal cells. AgNP represents a novel  therapy for the treatment of NF1-associated MPNSTs and addresses significant  unmet clinical need.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are aggressive soft-tissue  sarcomas which lack effective drugs. Loss of the RAS GTPase-activating protein  NF1 and subsequent overactivation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase  (MAPK) signaling exist nearly uniformly in MPNST, making MAPK inhibition a  promising therapeutic intervention. However, the efficacy of MEK inhibitor  (MEKi) monotherapy was limited in MPNST and the relative mechanisms remained  largely unexplored. In this study, we generated three MEKi-resistant cell models  and investigated the mechanisms of MEKi resistance using high-throughput  transcriptomic sequencing. We discovered that cell apoptosis and cell cycle  arrest induced by MEKi were rescued in MEKi-resistant cells and the upregulation  of LAMA4/ITGB1/FAK/SRC signaling conferred resistance to MEKi. In addition,  concurrent inhibition of MAPK signaling and FAK/SRC cascade could sensitize  MPNST cells to MEKi.

Nerve sheath tumors (NSTs) are characterized by neoplastic proliferation of  Schwann cells, perineurial cells, endoneurial and/or epineurial fibroblasts.  Diagnosis of NST is often challenging, particularly in distinguishing malignant  NST (MNST) from other soft tissue sarcomas, or sometimes between low-grade MNST  and benign NST. Recent studies in human pathology have demonstrated loss of  trimethylation at lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27me3) in a subset of MNSTs using  immunohistochemistry. Loss of H3K27me3 expression is rare in other high-grade  sarcomas and also appears to be useful in distinguishing benign and low-grade  MNSTs from high-grade subsets. In our retrospective study, we performed H3K27me3  immunohistochemistry in 68 canine tumors previously diagnosed as NST. We  detected loss of H3K27me3 expression in 25% (n = 17) of all canine NST,  including one neurofibroma, whereas 49% (n = 33) of tumors had mosaic loss of  expression and 26% (n = 18) retained expression. No statistically significant  differences were found between H3K27me3 expression, histopathological features  of tumors, and their immunoreactivity for Sox10, claudin-1, GFAP, and Ki67.  Because the classification of canine NST is not yet fully established and its  correlation with the prognosis and clinical course of the disease is lacking,  prospective studies with possible genetic analyses are needed to assess the true  diagnostic value of H3K27me3 loss in canine NST.

(#)Contributed equally  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is associated with GABAergic dysfunction which  has been suggested as the underlying cause of cognitive impairments. Previous  intervention trials investigated the statins' effects using cognitive outcome  measures. However, available outcome measures have led to inconclusive results  and there is a need to identify other options. Here, we aimed at investigating  alternative outcome measures in a feasibility trial targeting cortical  inhibition mechanisms known to be altered in NF1. We explored the neurochemical  and physiological changes elicited by lovastatin, with magnetic resonance  spectroscopy and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Fifteen NF1 adults  participated in this randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled crossover  trial (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT03826940) composed of one baseline and two  reassessment visits after lovastatin/placebo intake (60 mg/day, 3-days). Motor  cortex GABA+ and Glx concentrations were measured using HERMES and PRESS  sequences, respectively. Cortical inhibition was investigated by paired-pulse,  input-output curve, and cortical silent period (CSP) TMS protocols. CSP ratios  were significantly increased by lovastatin (relative: p = 0.027; absolute:  p = 0.034) but not by placebo. CSP durations showed a negative correlation with  the LICI 50 ms amplitude ratio. Lovastatin was able to modulate cortical  inhibition in NF1, as assessed by TMS CSP ratios. The link between this  modulation of cortical inhibition and clinical improvements should be addressed  by future large-scale studies.  © 2022. The Author(s).

Neurofibromin is engaged in many cellular processes and when the proper protein  functioning is impaired, it causes neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the  most common inherited neurological disorders. Recent advances in sequencing and  screening of the NF1 gene have increased the number of detected variants.  However, the correlation of these variants with the clinic remains poorly  understood. In this study, we analyzed 4610 germinal NF1 variants annotated in  ClinVar and determined on exon level the mutational spectrum and potential  pathogenic regions. Then, a binomial and sliding windows test using 783 benign  and 938 pathogenic NF1 variants were analyzed against functional and structural  regions of neurofibromin. The distribution of synonymous, missense, and  frameshift variants are statistically significant in certain regions of  neurofibromin suggesting that the type of variant and its associated phenotype  may depend on protein disorder. Indeed, there is a negative correlation between  the pathogenic fraction prediction and the disorder data, suggesting that the  higher an intrinsically disordered region is, the lower the pathogenic fraction  is and vice versa. Most pathogenic variants are associated to NF1 and our  analysis suggests that GRD, CSRD, TBD, and Armadillo1 domains are hotspots in  neurofibromin. Knowledge about NF1 genotype-phenotype correlations can provide  prognostic guidance and aid in organ-specific surveillance.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal-dominant neurogenetic disorder  caused by mutations in the gene neurofibromin 1 (NF1). NF1 predisposes  individuals to a variety of symptoms, including peripheral nerve tumors, brain  tumors and cognitive dysfunction. Cognitive deficits can negatively impact  patient quality of life, especially the social and academic development of  children. The neurofibromin protein influences neural circuits via diverse  cellular signaling pathways, including through RAS, cAMP and dopamine signaling.  Although animal models have been useful in identifying cellular and molecular  mechanisms that regulate NF1-dependent behaviors, translating these discoveries  into effective treatments has proven difficult. Clinical trials measuring  cognitive outcomes in patients with NF1 have mainly targeted RAS signaling but,  unfortunately, resulted in limited success. In this Review, we provide an  overview of the structure and function of neurofibromin, and evaluate several  cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying neurofibromin-dependent cognitive  function, which have recently been delineated in animal models. A better  understanding of neurofibromin roles in the development and function of the  nervous system will be crucial for identifying new therapeutic targets for the  various cognitive domains affected by NF1.  © 2022.

Background: Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a rare genetic syndrome that  predisposes individuals to develop bilateral vestibular schwannomas (VSs)  causing a high risk of life-threatening neurological complications. Traditional  treatment options for NF2-associated VS usually cause neurological damage, and  to date, there are no FDA-approved pharmacotherapies for NF2. The aim of this  study was to evaluate the antitumor efficacy of Qu-Du-San-Jie (QDSJ) decoction,  a traditional Chinese medicine formula, on NF2-associated VS and to investigate  the potential underlying mechanisms. Methods: Ultra high-performance liquid  chromatography-mass spectroscopy (UHPLC-MS) analysis was performed to identify  the components of QDSJ and their targets. To determine the relationships between  the putative targets of QDSJ and the differential genes of NF2-associated VS,  the drug-disease crossover genes were screened using the UHPLC-MS data combined  with our previous gene expression profiling data. The differentially expressed  genes were imported into the STRING database to generate a PPI network.  Differentially expressed gene targets and pathways were identified using GO and  KEGG pathway enrichment analyses. The in vitro and in vivo drug efficacy of QDSJ  decoction was tested using a patient-derived schwannoma cell line and a  patient-derived xenograft mouse model, respectively. H&E staining,  immunochemistry, and immunofluorescence staining were used to evaluate the cell  proliferation and tumor vessels. Results: A total of 133 compounds were  identified in QDSJ decoction using UHPLC-MS analysis. Network pharmacology  showed that the regulation of necroptosis, apoptosis, cell cycle, angiogenesis,  adherens junction, and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction could be  associated with the efficacy of QDSJ in treating NF2-associated VS. Treatment  with QDSJ induced necrotic cell death and apoptosis of schwannoma cells in vitro  and suppressed the tumor growth in vivo. Histopathological analysis revealed  areas of cell necrosis and enlarged tumor blood vessels in the QDSJ-treated  tumors. The numbers of cells positive for Cyclin D1 and Ki-67 were significantly  reduced in QDSJ-treated tumors compared to control tumors. Immunofluorescence  staining of CD31 and αSMA showed a decreased number and density of tumor vessels  and normalized vessel structure in QDSJ-treated tumors. Conclusion: Our study  demonstrates that QDSJ decoction shows significant antitumor activity against  NF2-associated schwannoma and is a possible candidate for future clinical  trials.

BACKGROUND: Anisotropic topologies are known to regulate cell-oriented growth  and induce cell differentiation, which is conducive to accelerating nerve  regeneration, while co-culture of endothelial cells (ECs) and Schwann cells  (SCs) can significantly promote the axon growth of dorsal root ganglion (DRG).  However, the synergistic regulation of EC and SC co-culture of DRG behavior on  anisotropic topologies is still rarely reported. The study aims to investigate  the effect of anisotropic topology co-cultured with Schwann cells and  endothelial cells on dorsal root ganglion behavior for promoting peripheral  nerve regeneration. METHODS: Chitosan/artemisia sphaerocephala (CS/AS) scaffolds with anisotropic  topology were first prepared using micro-molding technology, and then the  surface was modified with dopamine to facilitate cell adhesion and growth. The  physical and chemical properties of the scaffolds were characterized through  morphology, wettability, surface roughness and component variation. SCs and ECs  were co-cultured with DRG cells on anisotropic topology scaffolds to evaluate  the axon growth behavior. RESULTS: Dopamine-modified topological CS/AS scaffolds had good hydrophilicity  and provided an appropriate environment for cell growth. Cellular  immunofluorescence showed that in contrast to DRG growth alone, co-culture of  SCs and ECs could not only promote the growth of DRG axons, but also offered a  stronger guidance for orientation growth of neurons, which could effectively  prevent axons from tangling and knotting, and thus may significantly inhibit  neurofibroma formation. Moreover, the co-culture of SCs and ECs could promote  the release of nerve growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor, and  up-regulate genes relevant to cell proliferation, myelination and skeletal  development via the PI3K-Akt, MAPK and cytokine and receptor chemokine pathways. CONCLUSIONS: The co-culture of SCs and ECs significantly improved the growth  behavior of DRG on anisotropic topological scaffolds, which may provide an  important basis for the development of nerve grafts in peripheral nerve  regeneration.  © The Author(s) 2022.

Based on animal  studies, the cause of cognitive disabilities in NF1 is hypothesized to arise  from decreased synaptic plasticity. Visual cortical plasticity in humans can be  investigated by studying visual evoked potentials (VEPs) in response to visual  stimulation. METHODS: VEP plasticity was assessed by measuring the increase of the peak  amplitudes C1, P1, and N1 induced by 10-min modulation of checkerboard reversals  in 22 adult NF1 patients and 30 controls. VEP signals were recorded  pre-modulation, during modulation, and at 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, 27 min  post-modulation. RESULTS: The P1 amplitude increased significantly comparing post-modulation to  pre-modulation in the control group. This potentiation was not observed in the  NF1 group. CONCLUSIONS: Visual cortical plasticity could be measured using VEPs in response  to visual stimulation in the control group. Individuals with NF1 may have  reduced visual cortical plasticity, as indicated by their non-potentiated  response to VEP induction. These findings should be interpreted with caution due  to high inter-subject variability. SIGNIFICANCE: The present study contributes to an improved assessment of the  feasibility for using neurophysiological outcome measures in intervention  studies of cognitive deficits among patients with NF1.

PURPOSE: The Danish neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) cohort was initiated to study  health-related, socioeconomic and psychological consequences of living with the  monogenetic disorder NF1 using a nationwide and population-based approach. PARTICIPANTS: The cohort includes all 2467 individuals in Denmark who were  hospitalised with or due to NF1 from 1977 to 2013 or registered in the RAREDIS  Database (1995-2013), a national clinical database for rare diseases, or both. A  comparison cohort matched to individuals with NF1 on sex and date of birth was  identified in the Civil Registration System (n=20 132). FINDINGS TO DATE: All cohort members were linked to the unique Danish registries  to obtain information on hospital contacts, birth outcomes, education and  partnership. A questionnaire was completed by 244 of the 629 adult cohort  members with NF1 registered in the RAREDIS Database to evaluate the psychosocial  and emotional burden. Further, neuropsychological tests were performed on 103  adult cohort members with NF1 and 38 adult population comparisons. To date, six  studies have been published. Individuals with NF1 had an increased risk for (1)  hospitalisation for disorders affecting all organ systems of the body throughout  all decades of life, (2) psychiatric disorders, (3) attaining a short or medium  long education and (4) not forming a life partner. Women with NF1 had an  increased risk for spontaneous abortions and stillbirths. Finally, adults with  NF1 had an impaired quality of life and a high need for professional support for  physical, psychological and work-related problems, which was partly associated  with disease severity and visibility. FUTURE PLANS: The cohort will regularly be updated with newly diagnosed patients  in the RAREDIS Database as well as with outcome information in the Danish  registries. New studies are in progress to assess other medical and  socioeconomic dimensions of living with NF1.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No  commercial re-use.

Loss-of-function mutations in the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) occur  frequently in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, an aggressive sarcoma  that arises from NF1-deficient Schwann cells. To define the oncogenic mechanisms  underlying PRC2 loss, we use engineered cells that dynamically reassemble a  competent PRC2 coupled with single-cell sequencing from clinical samples. We  discover a two-pronged oncogenic process: first, PRC2 loss leads to remodeling  of the bivalent chromatin and enhancer landscape, causing the upregulation of  developmentally regulated transcription factors that enforce a transcriptional  circuit serving as the cell's core vulnerability. Second, PRC2 loss reduces type  I interferon signaling and antigen presentation as downstream consequences of  hyperactivated Ras and its cross talk with STAT/IRF transcription factors.  Mapping of the transcriptional program of these PRC2-deficient tumor cells onto  a constructed developmental trajectory of normal Schwann cells reveals that  changes induced by PRC2 loss enforce a cellular profile characteristic of a  primitive mesenchymal neural crest stem cell.

To define alterations early in tumor formation, we studied nerve tumors in  neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), a tumor predisposition syndrome. Affected individuals  develop neurofibromas, benign tumors driven by NF1 loss in Schwann cells (SCs).  By comparing normal nerve cells to plexiform neurofibroma (PN) cells using  single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing, we identified changes in 5 SC populations,  including a de novo SC progenitor-like (SCP-like) population. Long after Nf1  loss, SC populations developed PN-specific expression of Dcn, Postn, and Cd74,  with sustained expression of the injury response gene Postn and showed dramatic  expansion of immune and stromal cell populations; in corresponding human PNs,  the immune and stromal cells comprised 90% of cells. Comparisons between  injury-related and tumor monocytes/macrophages support early monocyte  recruitment and aberrant macrophage differentiation. Cross-species analysis  verified each SC population and unique conserved patterns of predicted cell-cell  communication in each SC population. This analysis identified PROS1-AXL,  FGF-FGFR, and MIF-CD74 and its effector pathway NF-κB as deregulated in NF1 SC  populations, including SCP-like cells predicted to influence other types of SCs,  stromal cells, and/or immune cells in mouse and human. These findings highlight  remarkable changes in multiple types of SCs and identify therapeutic targets for  PN.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a genetic tumor predisposition  syndrome that affects about 1 in 3000 newborns, is caused by mutations in the  NF1 gene and subsequent inactivation of its encoded neurofibromin. Neurofibromin  is a tumor suppressor protein involved in the downregulation of Ras signaling.  Despite a diverse clinical spectrum, one of several hallmarks of NF1 is a  peripheral nerve sheath tumor (PNST), which comprises mixed nervous and fibrous  components. The distinct spatiotemporal characteristics of plexiform and  cutaneous neurofibromas have prompted hypotheses about the origin and  developmental features of these tumors, involving various cellular transition  processes. METHODS: We retrieved published literature from PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of  Science up to 21 June 2022 and searched references cited in the selected studies  to identify other relevant papers. Original articles reporting the pathogenesis  of PNSTs during development were included in this review. We highlighted the  Schwann cell (SC) lineage shift to better present the evolution of its  corresponding cellular origin hypothesis and its important effects on the  progression and malignant transformation of neurofibromas. CONCLUSIONS: In this review, we summarized the vast array of evidence obtained  on the full range of neurofibroma development based on cellular and molecular  pathogenesis. By integrating findings relating to tumor formation, growth, and  malignancy, we hope to reveal the role of SC lineage shift as well as the  combined impact of additional determinants in the natural history of PNSTs.

(#)Contributed equally  The poor survival and low efficiency of neuronal differentiation limits the  therapeutic effects of transplanted neural stem cells in the treatment of spinal  cord injury. Neurofibromatosis-1 (NF-1) is a tumor suppressor gene that  restricts the rapid and abnormal growth and differentiation of neural cells. In  the present study, lentiviral vectors were used to knock out NF-1, Ricotr (the  core member of mTORC2) or NF-1+Ricotr in neural stem cells in vitro, and the  NF-1, Ricotr or NF-1+Ricotr knockout neural stem cells were transplanted at the  lesion site in a rat model of spinal cord injury (SCI). We first demonstrated  that targeted knockout of NF-1 had an antiapoptotic effect and improved neuronal  differentiation by enhancing the mTORC2/Rictor pathway of neural stem cells in  vitro. Subsequently, transplanting NF-1 knockout neural stem cells into the  injured site sufficiently promoted the tissue repair and functional recovery of  rats with spinal cord injury by enhancing the survival and neuronal  differentiation of grafted neural stem cells. Collectively, these findings  reveal a prominent role of NF-1 in neural stem cell biology, which is an  invaluable step forward in enhancing the benefit of neural stem cell-mediated  regenerative cell therapy for spinal cord injury and identifies the  transplantation of NF-1 knockout neural stem cells as a promising strategy for  spinal cord injury.  © 2022.

Neurofibromatosis type 2 is an autosomal dominant multiple neoplasia syndrome  and is usually caused by mutations in the neurofibromin 2 (NF2) gene, which  encodes a tumor suppressor and initiates the Hippo pathway. However, the  mechanism by which NF2 functions in the Hippo pathway isn't fully understood.  Here we identified a NF2 c.770-784del mutation from a neurofibromatosis type 2  family. MD simulations showed that this mutation significantly changed the  structure of the F3 module of the NF2-FERM domain. Functional assays indicated  that the NF2 c.770-784del variant formed LLPS in the cytoplasm with LATS to  restrain LATS plasma membrane localization and inactivated the Hippo pathway.  Besides, this deletion partly caused a skipping of exon 8 and reduced the  protein level of NF2, collectively promoting proliferation and tumorigenesis of  meningeal cells. We identified an unrecognized mechanism of LLPS and splicing  skipping for the NF2-induced Hippo pathway, which provided new insight into the  pathogenesis of neurofibromatosis type 2.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a single-gene disorder associated with cognitive  phenotypes common to neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism. GABAergic  dysregulation underlies working memory impairments seen in NF1. This mechanistic  experimental study investigates whether application of anodal transcranial  direct current stimulation (atDCS) can modulate GABA and working memory in NF1.  Thirty-one NF1 adolescents 11-18 years, were recruited to this single-blind  sham-controlled cross-over randomized trial. AtDCS or sham stimulation was  applied to the left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) and MR Spectroscopy  was collected before and after intervention in the left DLPFC and occipital  cortex. Task-related functional MRI was collected before, during, and after  stimulation. Higher baseline GABA+ in the left DLPFC was associated with faster  response times on baseline working memory measures. AtDCS was seen to  significantly reduced GABA+ and increase brain activation in the left DLPFC as  compared to sham stimulation. Task performance was worse in the aTDCS group  during stimulation but no group differences in behavioural outcomes were  observed at the end of stimulation. Although our study suggests aTDCS modulates  inhibitory activity in the DLPFC, further work is needed to determine whether  repeated sessions of atDCS and strategies such as alternating current  stimulation offer a better therapeutic approach.  © 2022.

(2)The Medical Scientist Training Program, Medical University of South Carolina,  Charleston, South Carolina, USA.  Schwann cell-derived neoplasms known as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors  (MPNSTs) are the most common malignancy and the leading cause of death in  individuals with neurofibromatosis Type 1. Using genome-scale shRNA screens, we  have previously found evidence suggesting that lysophosphatidic acid receptors  (LPARs) are essential for MPNST proliferation and/or survival. Here, we examine  the expression and mutational status of all six LPA receptors in MPNSTs, assess  the role that individual LPA receptors play in MPNST physiology and examine  their ability to activate key neurofibromin-regulated signaling cascades. We  found that human Schwann cells express LPAR1 and LPAR6, while MPNST cells  express predominantly LPAR1 and LPAR3. Whole exome sequencing of 16 MPNST cell  lines showed no evidence of mutations in any LPAR genes or ENPP2, a gene  encoding a major LPA biosynthetic enzyme. Oleoyl-LPA, an LPA variant with an  unsaturated side chain, promoted MPNST cell proliferation and migration. LPAR1  knockdown ablated the promigratory effect of LPA, while LPAR3 knockdown  decreased proliferation. Inhibition of R-Ras signaling with a  doxycycline-inducible dominant negative (DN) R-Ras mutant, which inhibits both  R-Ras and R-Ras2, blocked LPA's promigratory effect. In contrast, DN R-Ras did  not affect migration induced by neuregulin-1β (NRG1β), suggesting that LPA and  NRG1β promote MPNST migration via distinct pathways. LPA-induced migration was  also inhibited by Y27632, an inhibitor of the ROCK1/2 kinases that mediate R-Ras  effects in MPNSTs. Thus, LPAR1 and aberrantly expressed LPAR3 mediate distinct  effects in MPNSTs. These receptors and the signaling pathways that they regulate  are potentially useful therapeutic targets in MPNSTs.  © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

NF2-related schwannomatosis (NF2-related SWN) is an autosomal dominant condition  caused by loss of function variants in the NF2 gene, which codes for the protein  Merlin and is characterized by the development of multiple tumors of the nervous  system. The clinical presentation of the disease is variable and related to the  type of the inherited germline variant. Here, we tested if phosphorodiamidate  morpholino oligomers (PMOs) could be used to correct the splice signaling caused  by variants at ±13 within the intron-exon boundary region and showed that the  PMOs designed for these variants do not constitute a therapeutic approach.  Furthermore, we evaluated the use of PMOs to decrease the severity of the  effects of NF2 truncating variants with the aim of generating milder hypomorphic  isoforms in vitro through the induction of the in-frame deletion of the  exon-carrying variant. We were able to specifically induce the skipping of exons  4, 8, and 11 maintaining the NF2 gene reading frame at cDNA level. Only the  skipping of exon 11 produced a hypomorphic Merlin (Merlin-e11), which is able to  partially rescue the observed phenotype in primary fibroblast cultures from  NF2-related SWN patients, being encouraging for the treatment of patients  harboring truncating variants located in exon 11.  © 2022 The Author(s).

(#)Contributed equally  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a tumor predisposition syndrome caused by  heterozygous NF1 gene mutations. Patients with NF1 present with pleiotropic  somatic secondary manifestations, including development of bone pseudarthrosis  after fracture. Somatic NF1 gene mutations were reproducibly identified in  patient-derived pseudarthrosis specimens, suggesting a local mosaic cell  population including somatic pathologic cells. The somatic cellular pathogenesis  of NF1 pseudarthroses remains unclear, though defects in osteogenesis have been  posited. Here, we applied time-series single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to  patient-matched control and pseudarthrosis-derived primary bone stromal cells  (BSCs). We show that osteogenic specification to an osteoblast progenitor cell  population was evident for control bone-derived cells and haploinsufficient  pseudarthrosis-derived cells. Similar results were observed for somatic patient  fracture-derived NF1-/- cells; however, expression of genetic pathways  associated with skeletal mineralization were significantly reduced in NF1-/-  cells compared with fracture-derived NF1+/- cells. In mice, we show that Nf1  expressed in bone marrow osteoprogenitors is required for the maintenance of the  adult skeleton.

Previous studies  have shown that nuclear receptor corepressor 2 (NCOR2) plays a vital role in  neurodevelopment and in various tumours. However, the impact of NCOR2 on the  progression of MPNST remains unclear. (2) Methods: by GEO database, MPNST tissue  microarray, and NF1-related tumour tissues and cell lines were used to explore  NCOR2 expression level in the MPNSTs. The role and mechanism of NCOR2 in  NF1-derived MPNSTs were explored by experiments in vivo and in vitro and by  transcriptome high-throughput sequencing. (3) Results: NCOR2 expression is  significantly elevated in NF1-derived MPNSTs and is associated with patient  10-year survival time. Knockdown of NCOR2 suppressed NF1-derived MPNST cell  proliferation by blocking the cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase. Moreover, decreased  NCOR2 expression could down-regulate MAPK signal activity through the BDNF/TrkB  pathway.

NCOR2 knockdown can inhibit  NF1-derived MPNST cell proliferation by weakened BDNF/TrkB/ERK signalling.  Targeting NF1-derived MPNSTs with TrkB inhibitors, or in combination with ERK  inhibitors, may be a novel therapeutic strategy for clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a rare genetic disease that causes  a wide range of disabilities leading to compromised quality of life (QOL). There  is clear need for a validated disease-specific tool to assess quality of life  among German-speaking patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). The NFTI-QOL  questionnaire has produced useful results in English-speaking cohorts. The aim  of this study was to produce and validate a German version of the NFTI-QOL  (NFTI-QOL-D) and to correlate QOL scores with a depression score (PHQ-9) and  clinical disease severity. METHODS: The original English-language NFTI-QOL was translated into German and  then back-translated in order to preserve the questionnaire's original concepts  and intentions. A link to an online survey encompassing the NFTI-QOL-D and the  PHQ-9 depression questionnaire was then sent to 97 patients with NF2 by email.  The respondents' scores were compared to clinician-reported disease severity  scores. RESULTS: 77 patients completed the online survey in full. Internal reliability  among NFTI-QOL-D responses was strong (Cronbach's alpha: 0.74). Both PHQ-9 and  clinician disease severity scores correlated with NFTI-QOL-D scores (Pearson's  rho 0.63 and 0.62, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The NFTI-QOL-D is a reliable and useful tool to assess  patient-reported QOL in German-speaking patients with NF2. The correlation of  QOL with both psychological and physical disease parameters underlines the  importance of individualized interdisciplinary patient care for NF2 patients,  with attention paid to mental well-being as well as to somatic disease  manifestations.  © 2023.

Background: Targeted therapy of Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) related plexiform  neurofibroma (pNF) aiming at MEK molecule has not demonstrated a convincing  result for complete disease inhibition, probably due to other signal pathways  crosstalk. Our previous study revealed an increased nuclear translocation of YAP  molecule in NF1 related pNF. Herein, we decided to further investigate the  therapeutic relations of YAP interference during the MEK treatment against NF1  related pNF. Methods: By means of selumetinib (MEK-inhibitor), RNA-sequencing  was firstly performed to identify the changes of signal pathways in pNF Schwann  cells, which was probably related to YAP regulation. Nuclear-cytoplasmic  fractionation and western blotting were performed to show the intracellular YAP  changes under selumetinib treatment. Thirdly, a series of in vitro assays were  performed including flow cytometry, CCK-8, and colony/sphere formation under  dual treatment of selumetinib and verteporfin (YAP-inhibitor). In addition,  Chou-Talalay method was adopted to evaluate the synergistic inhibiting effects  of such drug combination. Xenograft study was also used to detect the combining  effects in vivo. Results: RNA-sequencing revealed that selumetinib treatment  might be associated with the undesirable activation of Hippo pathway in NF1  related pNF tumor cells, which might reduce its pharmaceutic effects. Next,  nuclear-cytoplasmic fractionation and further studies demonstrated that  selumetinib could promote the nuclear translocation and transcriptional  activation of YAP in vitro, which might cause the aforementioned resistance to  selumetinib treatment. Additionally, when combined treatments were performed  based on verteporfin and selumetinib, synergistic effects were observed on  cytotoxicity of NF1 related pNF tumor cells in vitro and in vivo xenograft  models. Conclusion: YAP inhibition can effectively sensitize NF1 related pNF  tumor cells to selumetinib. Dual targeting of YAP and MEK might be a promising  therapeutic strategy for treating NF1 related pNF.  © The author(s).

The majority of pathogenic mutations in the neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) gene  reduce total neurofibromin protein expression through premature truncation or  microdeletion, but it is less well understood how loss-of-function missense  variants drive NF1 disease. We have found that patient variants in codons 844 to  848, which correlate with a severe phenotype, cause protein instability and  exert an additional dominant-negative action whereby wild-type neurofibromin  also becomes destabilized through protein dimerization. We have used our  neurofibromin cryogenic electron microscopy structure to predict and validate  other patient variants that act through a similar mechanism. This provides a  foundation for understanding genotype-phenotype correlations and has important  implications for patient counseling, disease management, and therapeutics.

Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) patients develop an array of benign and malignant  tumors, of which Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors (MPNST) and High Grade  Gliomas (HGG) have a dismal prognosis. About 15-20% of individuals with NF1  develop brain tumors and one third of these occur outside of the optic pathway.  These non-optic pathway gliomas are more likely to progress to malignancy,  especially in adults. Despite their low frequency, high grade gliomas have a  disproportional effect on the morbidity of NF1 patients. In vitro drug  combination screens have not been performed on NF1-associated HGG, hindering our  ability to develop informed clinical trials. Here we present the first in vitro  drug combination screen (21 compounds alone or in combination with MEK or PI3K  inhibitors) on the only human NF1 patient derived HGG cell line available and on  three mouse glioma cell lines derived from the NF1-P53 genetically engineered  mouse model, which sporadically develop HGG. These mouse glioma cell lines were  never exposed to serum, grow as spheres and express markers that are consistent  with an Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cell (OPC) lineage origin. Importantly, even  though the true cell of origin for HGG remains elusive, they are thought to  arise from the OPC lineage. We evaluated drug sensitivities of the three murine  glioma cell lines in a 3D spheroid growth assay, which more accurately reflects  drug sensitivities in vivo. Excitingly, we identified six compounds targeting  HDACs, BRD4, CHEK1, BMI-1, CDK1/2/5/9, and the proteasome that potently induced  cell death in our NF1-associated HGG. Moreover, several of these inhibitors work  synergistically with either MEK or PI3K inhibitors. This study forms the basis  for further pre-clinical evaluation of promising targets, with an eventual hope  to translate these to the clinic.  Copyright: © 2023 Dougherty et al.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients are predisposed to develop plexiform  neurofibromas (PNFs). Three endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response pathways  restore cellular homeostasis. The unfolded protein response (UPR) sensors  contribute to tumor initiation in many cancers. We found that all three UPR  pathways were activated in mouse and human PNFs, with protein kinase RNA  [PKR]-like ER kinase (PERK) the most highly expressed. We tested if neurofibroma  cells adapt to ER stress, leading to their growth. Pharmacological or genetic  inhibition of PERK reduced mouse neurofibroma-sphere number, and genetic  inhibition in PERK in Schwann cell precursors (SCPs) decreased tumor-like lesion  numbers in a cell transplantation model. Further, in a PNF mouse model, deletion  of PERK in Schwann cells (SCs) and SCPs reduced tumor size, number, and  increased survival. Mechanistically, loss of Nf1 activated PERK-eIF2α-ATF4  signaling and increased ATF4 downstream target gene p21 translocation from  nucleus to cytoplasm. This nucleus-cytoplasm translocation was mediated by  exportin-1. Runx transcriptionally activated ribosome gene expression and  increased protein synthesis to allow SCs to adapt to ER stress and tumor  formation. We propose that targeting proteostasis might provide cytotoxic and/or  potentially durable novel therapy for PNFs.  © 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is an inherited disorder caused by  bi-allelic inactivation of the NF2 tumor suppressor gene. NF2-associated tumors,  including schwannoma and meningioma, are resistant to chemotherapy, often  recurring despite surgery and/or radiation, and have generally shown cytostatic  response to signal transduction pathway inhibitors, highlighting the need for  improved cytotoxic therapies. METHODS: Leveraging data from our previous high-throughput drug screening in NF2  preclinical models, we identified a class of compounds targeting the  ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP), and undertook studies using candidate UPP  inhibitors, ixazomib/MLN9708, pevonedistat/MLN4924, and TAK-243/MLN7243.  Employing human primary and immortalized meningioma (MN) cell lines,  CRISPR-modified Schwann cells (SCs), and mouse Nf2-/- SCs, we performed dose  response testing, flow cytometry-based Annexin V and cell cycle analyses, and  RNA-sequencing to identify potential underlying mechanisms of apoptosis. In vivo  efficacy was also assessed in orthotopic NF2-deficient meningioma and schwannoma  tumor models. RESULTS: Testing of three UPP inhibitors demonstrated potent reduction in cell  viability and induction of apoptosis for ixazomib or TAK-243, but not  pevonedistat. In vitro analyses revealed that ixazomib or TAK-243 downregulates  expression of c-KIT and PDGFRα, as well as the E3 ubiquitin ligase SKP2 while  upregulating genes associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated  activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). In vivo treatment of mouse  models revealed delayed tumor growth, suggesting a therapeutic potential. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the efficacy of proteasomal pathway  inhibitors in meningioma and schwannoma preclinical models and lays the  groundwork for use of these drugs as a promising novel treatment strategy for  NF2 patients.  © The Author(s) 2023.

Hennigan RF(1), Thomson CS(1), Stachowski K(1), Nassar N(1), Ratner N(1).  Author information: (1)Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's  Hospital Medical Center, Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati,  Cincinnati, OH, United States of America.  Neurofibromatosis Type 2 is an inherited disease characterized by Schwann cell  tumors of cranial and peripheral nerves. The NF2 gene encodes Merlin, a member  of the ERM family consisting of an N-terminal FERM domain, a central α-helical  region, and a C-terminal domain. Changes in the intermolecular FERM-CTD  interaction allow Merlin to transition between an open, FERM accessible  conformation and a closed, FERM-inaccessible conformation, modulating Merlin  activity. Merlin has been shown to dimerize, but the regulation and function  Merlin dimerization is not clear. We used a nanobody based binding assay to show  that Merlin dimerizes via a FERM-FERM interaction, orientated with each  C-terminus close to each other. Patient derived and structural mutants show that  dimerization controls interactions with specific binding partners, including  HIPPO pathway components, and correlates with tumor suppressor activity. Gel  filtration experiments showed that dimerization occurs after a PIP2 mediated  transition from closed to open conformation monomers. This process requires the  first 18 amino acids of the FERM domain and is inhibited by phosphorylation at  serine 518. The discovery that active, open conformation Merlin is a dimer  represents a new paradigm for Merlin function with implications for the  development of therapies designed to compensate for Merlin loss.

Despite the increasing diagnosis of sporadic VS over the past decade, the  use of traditional microsurgeries to treat VS has decreased. This is likely a  result of the adoption of serial imaging as the most common initial evaluation  and treatment strategy, especially for small-sized VS. However, the pathobiology  of VSs remains unclear, and elucidating the genetic information of tumor tissue  may reveal novel insights. The present study performed a comprehensive genomic  analysis of all exons in the key tumor suppressor and oncogenes from 10 small  (<15 mm) sporadic VS samples. The evaluations identified NF2, SYNE1, IRS2, APC,  CIC, SDHC, BRAF, NUMA1, EXT2, HRAS, BCL11B, MAGI1, RNF123, NLRP1, ASXL1,  ADAMTS20, TAF1L, XPC, DDB2 and ETS1 as mutated genes. The current study could  not draw any new conclusions about the relationship between VS-related hearing  loss and gene mutations; however, it did reveal that NF2 was the most frequently  mutated gene in small sporadic VS.

Individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 develop rat sarcoma virus  (RAS)-mitogen-activated protein kinase-mitogen-activated and extracellular  signal-regulated kinase (RAS-MAPK-MEK)-driven nerve tumors called neurofibromas.  Although MEK inhibitors transiently reduce volumes of most plexiform  neurofibromas in mouse models and in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients,  therapies that increase the efficacy of MEK inhibitors are needed. BI-3406 is a  small molecule that prevents Son of Sevenless (SOS)1 interaction with Kirsten  rat sarcoma viral oncoprotein (KRAS)-GDP, interfering with the RAS-MAPK cascade  upstream of MEK. Single agent SOS1 inhibition had no significant effect in the  DhhCre;Nf1 fl/fl mouse model of plexiform neurofibroma, but pharmacokinetics  (PK)-driven combination of selumetinib with BI-3406 significantly improved tumor  parameters. Tumor volumes and neurofibroma cell proliferation, reduced by MEK  inhibition, were further reduced by the combination. Neurofibromas are rich in  ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1)+ macrophages; combination  treatment resulted in small and round macrophages, with altered cytokine  expression indicative of altered activation. The significant effects of MEK  inhibitor plus SOS1 inhibition in this preclinical study suggest potential  clinical benefit of dual targeting of the RAS-MAPK pathway in neurofibromas.  SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Interfering with the RAS-mitogen-activated protein  kinase (RAS-MAPK) cascade upstream of mitogen activated protein kinase kinase  (MEK), together with MEK inhibition, augment effects of MEK inhibition on  neurofibroma volume and tumor macrophages in a preclinical model system. This  study emphasizes the critical role of the RAS-MAPK pathway in controlling tumor  cell proliferation and the tumor microenvironment in benign neurofibromas.

Nervous system cancers are the 10th leading cause of death worldwide, many of  which are difficult to diagnose and exhibit varying degrees of treatment  resistance. The limitations of existing cancer models, such as patient-derived  xenograft (PDX) models and genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models, call for  the development of novel preclinical cancer models to more faithfully mimic the  patient's cancer and offer additional insights. Recent advances in human stem  cell biology, organoid, and genome-editing techniques allow us to model nervous  system tumors in three types of next-generation tumor models: cell-of-origin  models, tumor organoids, and 3D multicellular coculture models. In this review,  we introduced and compared different human stem cell/organoid-derived models,  and comprehensively summarized and discussed the recently developed models for  various primary tumors in the central and peripheral nervous systems, including  glioblastoma (GBM), H3K27M-mutant Diffuse Midline Glioma (DMG) and H3G34R-mutant  High-grade Glioma (HGG), Low-grade Glioma (LGG), Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1),  Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2), Medulloblastoma (MB), Atypical Teratoid/rhabdoid  Tumor (AT/RT), and meningioma. We further compared these models with PDX and GEM  models, and discussed the opportunities and challenges of precision nervous  cancer modeling with human stem cells and organoids.  © 2023.

BACKGROUND: Plexiform neurofibromas can transform into atypical neurofibromas  (ANF) and then further progress to aggressive malignant peripheral nerve sheath  tumors (MPNST). ANF have been described to harbor distinct histological features  and frequent loss of CDKN2A/B. However, histological evaluation may be  rater-dependent, and detailed knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of  malignant transformation is scarce. In general, malignant transformation can be  accompanied by significant epigenetic changes, and global DNA methylation  profiling is able to differentiate relevant tumor subgroups. Therefore,  epigenetic profiling might provide a valuable tool to distinguish and  characterize ANF with differing extent of histopathological atypia from  neurofibromas and MPNST. METHODS: We investigated 40 tumors histologically diagnosed as ANF and compared  their global methylation profile to other peripheral nerve sheath tumors. RESULTS: Unsupervised class discovery and t-SNE analysis indicated that 36/40  ANF cluster with benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors with clear separation  from MPNST. 21 ANF formed a molecularly distinct cluster in proximity to  schwannomas. Tumors in this cluster had a frequent heterozygous or homozygous  loss of CDKN2A/B and significantly more lymphocyte infiltration than MPNST,  schwannomas, and NF. Few ANF clustered closely with neurofibromas, schwannomas,  or MPNST, raising the question, whether diagnosis based on histological features  alone might pose a risk to both over- and underestimate the aggressiveness of  these lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that ANF with varying histological morphology show  distinct epigenetic similarities and cluster in proximity to benign peripheral  nerve sheath tumor entities. Future investigations should pay special respect to  correlating this methylation pattern to clinical outcomes.  © The Author(s) 2023.

Neurofibromas (NFs), Bowen disease (BD), and seborrheic keratosis (SK) are  common skin tumors. Pathologic examination is the gold standard for diagnosis of  these tumors. Current pathologic diagnosis is primarily based on microscopic  observation, which is laborious and time-consuming. With digitization,  artificial intelligence can be used to improve the efficiency of pathologic  diagnosis. This research aims to develop an end-to-end extendable framework for  the diagnosis of skin tumor based on pathologic slide images. NF, BD, and SK  were selected as target skin tumors. A two-stage skin cancer diagnosis framework  is proposed in this article, which consists of two parts: patches-wise  diagnosis, and slide-wise diagnosis. Patches-wise diagnosis compares different  convolutional neural networks to extract features and distinguish categories  from patches generated in whole slide images. Slide-wise diagnosis combines  attention graph gated network model prediction with post-processing algorithm.  This approach can fuse information from feature-embedding learning and domain  knowledge to draw conclusions. Training, validation, and testing were performed  on NF, BD, SK, and negative samples. Accuracy and receiver operating  characteristic curves were used to evaluate the classification performance. This  study investigated the feasibility of skin tumor diagnosis from pathologic  images and may be the first instance of applying deep learning to address these  three types of tumor diagnoses in skin pathology.

We previously discovered a sex-by-genotype defect in microglia function using a  heterozygous germline knockout mouse model of Neurofibromatosis type 1  (Nf1 ± mice), in which only microglia from male Nf1 ± mice exhibited defects in  purinergic signaling. Herein, we leveraged an unbiased proteomic approach to  demonstrate that male, but not female, heterozygous Nf1 ± microglia exhibit  differences in protein expression, which largely reflect pathways involved in  cytoskeletal organization. In keeping with these predicted defects in  cytoskeletal function, only male Nf1 ± microglia had reduced process  arborization and surveillance capacity. To determine whether these microglial  defects were cell autonomous or reflected adaptive responses to Nf1  heterozygosity in other cells in the brain, we generated conditional microglia  Nf1-mutant knockout mice by intercrossing Nf1flox/flox with Cx3cr1-CreER mice  (Nf1flox/wt; Cx3cr1-CreER mice, Nf1MG ± mice). Surprisingly, neither male nor  female Nf1MG ± mouse microglia had impaired process arborization or surveillance  capacity. In contrast, when Nf1 heterozygosity was generated in neurons,  astrocytes and oligodendrocytes by intercrossing Nf1flox/flox with hGFAP-Cre  mice (Nf1flox/wt; hGFAP-Cre mice, Nf1GFAP ± mice), the microglia defects found  in Nf1 ± mice were recapitulated. Collectively, these data reveal that  Nf1 ± sexually dimorphic microglia abnormalities are likely not cell-intrinsic  properties, but rather reflect a response to Nf1 heterozygosity in other brain  cells.  © 2023.

However, these inhibitors alone do not lead to tumor regression in  vivo, indicating the need for combination therapy. METHODS AND RESULTS: Via high-throughput combination screening, we identified  that the MEK inhibitor trametinib can be combined with BCL-2 family member  inhibitors, to efficiently inhibit growth of neuroblastoma cell lines with  RAS-MAPK mutations. Suppressing the RAS-MAPK pathway with trametinib led to an  increase in pro-apoptotic BIM, resulting in more BIM binding to anti-apoptotic  BCL-2 family members. By favoring the formation of these complexes, trametinib  treatment enhances sensitivity to compounds targeting anti-apoptotic BCL-2  family members. In vitro validation studies confirmed that this sensitizing  effect is dependent on an active RAS-MAPK pathway. In vivo combination of  trametinib with BCL-2 inhibitors led to tumor inhibition in NRAS-mutant and  NF1-deleted xenografts. CONCLUSION: Together, these results show that combining MEK inhibition with  BCL-2 family member inhibition could potentially improve therapeutic outcomes  for RAS-MAPK-mutated neuroblastoma patients.

Schwannomas are common sporadic tumors and hallmarks of familial  neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) that develop predominantly on cranial and spinal  nerves. Virtually all schwannomas result from inactivation of the NF2 tumor  suppressor gene with few, if any, cooperating mutations. Despite their genetic  uniformity schwannomas exhibit remarkable clinical and therapeutic  heterogeneity, which has impeded successful treatment. How heterogeneity  develops in NF2-mutant schwannomas is unknown. We have found that loss of the  membrane:cytoskeleton-associated NF2 tumor suppressor, merlin, yields unstable  intrinsic polarity and enables Nf2-/- Schwann cells to adopt distinct programs  of ErbB ligand production and polarized signaling, suggesting a self-generated  model of schwannoma heterogeneity. We validated the heterogeneous distribution  of biomarkers of these programs in human schwannoma and exploited the  synchronous development of lesions in a mouse model to establish a quantitative  pipeline for studying how schwannoma heterogeneity evolves. Our studies  highlight the importance of intrinsic mechanisms of heterogeneity across human  cancers.  © 2023. The Author(s).

The advancement of CRISPR mediated gene engineering provides an opportunity to  improve upon preclinical human cell line models of cancer predisposing  syndromes. This review focuses on using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tools to  model various human cancer predisposition syndromes. We examine the genetic  mutations associated with neurofibromatosis type 1, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Gorlin  syndrome, BRCA mutant breast and ovarian cancers, and APC mutant cancers.  Furthermore, we discuss the possibilities of using next-generation  CRISPR-derived precision gene editing tools to introduce a variety of genetic  lesions into human cell lines. The goal is to improve the quality of preclinical  models surrounding these cancer predisposition syndromes through dissecting the  effects of these mutations on the development of cancer and to provide new  insights into the underlying mechanisms of these cancer predisposition  syndromes. These studies demonstrate the continued utility and improvement of  CRISPR/Cas9-induced human cell line models in studying the genetic basis of  cancer.  © 2023 The Authors.

We describe a protocol to generate neurofibromaspheres by differentiating  NF1(-/-) Schwann cells from induced pluripotent stem cells and combining them  with neurofibroma primary fibroblasts. We also describe the development of  neurofibroma-like tumors when neurofibromaspheres are engrafted in the sciatic  nerve of nude mice.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common tumor-predisposing  genetic disorders. Neurofibromas are NF1-associated benign tumors. A hallmark  feature of neurofibromas is an abundant collagen-rich extracellular matrix (ECM)  that constitutes more than 50% of the tumor dry weight. However, little is known  about the mechanism underlying ECM deposition during neurofibroma development  and treatment response. We performed a systematic investigation of ECM  enrichment during plexiform neurofibroma (pNF) development and identified  basement membrane (BM) proteins, rather than major collagen isoforms, as the  most upregulated ECM component. Following MEK inhibitor treatment, the ECM  profile displayed an overall downregulation signature, suggesting ECM reduction  as a therapeutic benefit of MEK inhibition. Through these proteomic studies,  TGF-β1 signaling was identified as playing a role in ECM dynamics. Indeed,  TGF-β1 overexpression promoted pNF progression in vivo. Furthermore, by  integrating single-cell RNA sequencing, we found that immune cells including  macrophages and T cells produce TGF-β1 to induce Schwann cells to produce and  deposit BM proteins for ECM remodeling. Following Nf1 loss, neoplastic Schwann  cells further increased BM protein deposition in response to TGF-β1. Our data  delineate the regulation governing ECM dynamics in pNF and suggest that BM  proteins could serve as biomarkers for disease diagnosis and treatment response.

(#)Contributed equally  BACKGROUND: Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is the most prevalent and invasive biliary  tract malignancy. As a GTPase-activating protein, Neurofibromin 1 (NF1) is a  tumor suppressor that negatively regulates the RAS signaling pathway, and its  abnormality leads to neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) disease. However, the role  of NF1 playing in GBC and the underlying molecular mechanism has not been  defined yet. METHODS: A combination of NOZ and EH-GB1 cell lines as well as nude mice, were  utilized in this study. mRNA expression and protein levels of NF1 and YAP1 were  evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), western blot (WB), and  immunohistochemistry (IHC). In vitro and in vivo assays were performed to  explore the biological effects of NF1 in NOZ and EH-GB1 cells via siRNA or  lv-shRNA mediated knockdown. Direct interaction between NF1 and YAP1 was  detected by confocal microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), and further  confirmed by GST pull-down assay and isothermal titration calorimetry assay  (ITC). The stability of proteins was measured by western blot (WB) in the  presence of cycloheximide. RESULTS: This study showed that a higher level of NF1 and YAP1 was found in GBC  samples than in normal tissues and associated with worse prognoses. The NF1  knockdown impaired the proliferation and migration of NOZ in vivo and in vitro  by downregulating YAP1 expression. Moreover, NF1 co-localized with YAP1 in NOZ  and EH-GB1 cells, and the WW domains of YAP1 specifically recognized the PPQY  motif of NF1. The structural modeling also indicated the hydrophobic  interactions between YAP1 and NF1. On the other hand, YAP1 knockdown also  impaired the proliferation of NOZ in vitro, phenocopying the effects of NF1  knockdown. Overexpression of YAP1 can partially rescue the impaired  proliferation in NF1 stably knockdown cells. In mechanism, NF1 interacted with  YAP1 and increased the stability of YAP1 by preventing ubiquitination. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings discovered a novel oncogenic function of NF1 by  directly interacting with YAP1 protein and stabilizing YAP1 to protect it from  proteasome degradation in NOZ cells. NF1 may serve as a potential therapeutic  target in GBC.  © 2023. The Author(s).

(#)Contributed equally  Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a highly aggressive sarcoma,  and a lethal neurofibromatosis type 1-related malignancy, with little progress  made on treatment strategies. Here, we apply a multiplatform integrated  molecular analysis on 108 tumors spanning the spectrum of peripheral nerve  sheath tumors to identify candidate drivers of MPNST that can serve as  therapeutic targets. Unsupervised analyses of methylome and transcriptome  profiles identify two distinct subgroups of MPNSTs with unique targetable  oncogenic programs. We establish two subgroups of MPNSTs: SHH pathway activation  in MPNST-G1 and WNT/ß-catenin/CCND1 pathway activation in MPNST-G2. Single  nuclei RNA sequencing characterizes the complex cellular architecture and  demonstrate that malignant cells from MPNST-G1 and MPNST-G2 have neural  crest-like and Schwann cell precursor-like cell characteristics, respectively.  Further, in pre-clinical models of MPNST we confirm that inhibiting SHH pathway  in MPNST-G1 prevent growth and malignant progression, providing the rational for  investigating these treatments in clinical trials.  © 2023.

(#)Contributed equally  Neurofibromatosis type 1 results from loss-of-function NF1 pathogenic variants  (PVs). Up to 30% of all NF1 PVs disrupt mRNA splicing, including deep intronic  variants. Here, we retrospectively investigated the spectrum of NF1 deep  intronic PVs in a cohort of 8,090 unrelated individuals from the University of  Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) dataset with a molecularly confirmed  neurofibromatosis type 1. All variants were identified through their effect on  the NF1 transcript, followed by variant characterization at the DNA-level. A  total of 68 distinct variants, which were ≥ 20 nucleotides away from the closest  exon-intron junction, were identified in 2.5% unrelated individuals with NF1  (200/8,090). Nine different pathogenic splice variants, identified in 20  probands, led to exonization of different parts of intron 30 [23.2] or 31 [23a].  The two major NF1 transcript isoforms, distinguished by the absence (type I) or  presence (type II) of the alternatively spliced cassette exon 31 [23a], are  equally expressed in blood in control individuals without NF1 or NF1-affected  individuals carrying their PV not in the introns flanking exon 31 [23a]. By  fragment and cloning analysis we demonstrated that the exonization of intron 31  [23a] sequences due to deep intronic PV predominantly affects the NF1 isoform  II. Seven additional (likely) pathogenic NF1 deep intronic variants not observed  in the UAB dataset were found by classification of 36 variants identified by a  literature search. Hence, the unique list of these 75 deep intronic (likely) PVs  should be included in any comprehensive NF1 testing strategy.  © 2023. The Author(s).

(#)Contributed equally  Spinal neurofibromatosis (SNF) is a form of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)  characterized by bilateral neurofibromas involving all spinal roots. The  pathogenic mechanisms determining the SNF form are currently unknown. To verify  the presence of genetic variants possibly related to SNF or classic NF1, we  studied 106 sporadic NF1 and 75 SNF patients using an NGS panel of 286 genes  encoding RAS pathway effectors and neurofibromin interactors and evaluated the  expression of syndecans (SDC1, SDC2, SDC3, SDC4), the NF1 3' tertile  interactors, by quantitative real-time PCR. We previously identified 75 and 106  NF1 variants in SNF and NF1 cohorts, respectively. The analysis of the  distribution of pathogenic NF1 variants in the three NF1 tertiles showed a  significantly higher prevalence of NF1 3' tertile mutations in SNF than in the  NF1 cohort. We hypothesized a potential pathogenic significance of the 3'  tertile NF1 variants in SNF. The analysis of syndecan expression on PBMCs RNAs  from 16 SNF, 16 classic NF1 patients and 16 healthy controls showed that the  expression levels of SDC2 and SDC3 were higher in SNF and NF1 patients than in  controls; moreover, SDC2, SDC3 and SDC4 were significantly over expressed in  patients mutated in the 3' tertile compared to controls. Two different  mutational NF1 spectra seem to characterize SNF and classic NF1, suggesting a  pathogenic role of NF1 3' tertile and its interactors, syndecans, in SNF. Our  study, providing new insights on a possible role of neurofibromin C-terminal in  SNF, could address effective personalized patient management and treatments.  © 2023.

The most common tumors  associated with NF2 are bilateral vestibular schwannoma, meningioma, and  ependymoma. The clinical manifestations of NF2 depend on the site of  involvement. Vestibular schwannoma can present with hearing loss, dizziness, and  tinnitus, while spinal tumor leads to debilitating pain, muscle weakness, or  paresthesias. Clinical diagnosis of NF2 is based on the Manchester criteria,  which have been updated in the last decade. NF2 is caused by loss-of-function  mutations in the NF2 gene on chromosome 22, leading the merlin protein to  malfunction. Over half of NF2 patients have de novo mutations, and half of this  group are mosaic. NF2 can be managed by surgery, stereotactic radiosurgery,  monoclonal antibody bevacizumab, and close observation. However, the nature of  multiple tumors and the necessity of multiple surgeries over the lifetime,  inoperable tumors like meningiomatosis with infiltration of the sinus or in the  area of the lower cranial nerves, the complications caused by the operation, the  malignancies induced by radiotherapy, and inefficiency of cytotoxic chemotherapy  due to the benign nature of NF-related tumors have led a march toward exploring  targeted therapies. Recent advances in genetics and molecular biology have  allowed identifying and targeting of underlying pathways in the pathogenesis of  NF2. In this review, we explain the clinicopathological characteristics of NF2,  its genetic and molecular background, and the current knowledge and challenges  of implementing genetics to develop efficient therapies.  © 2023.

Cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs) are the most common tumor in people with the  rasopathy neurofibromatosis type 1. They number in hundreds or even thousands  throughout the body, and currently, there are no effective interventions to  prevent or treat these skin tumors. To facilitate the identification of novel  and effective therapies, essential studies including a more refined  understanding of cNF biology and the role of RAS signaling and downstream  effector pathways responsible for cNF initiation, growth, and maintenance are  needed. This review highlights the current state of knowledge of RAS signaling  in cNF pathogenesis and therapeutic development for cNF treatment.  Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

BACKGROUND: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are aggressive soft  tissue sarcomas that often develop in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1  (NF1). To address the critical need for novel therapeutics in MPNST, we aimed to  establish an ex vivo 3D platform that accurately captured the genomic diversity  of MPNST and could be utilized in a medium-throughput manner for drug screening  studies to be validated in vivo using patient-derived xenografts (PDX). METHODS: Genomic analysis was performed on all PDX-tumor pairs. Selected PDX  were harvested for assembly into 3D microtissues. Based on prior work in our  labs, we evaluated drugs (trabectedin, olaparib, and mirdametinib) ex vivo and  in vivo. For 3D microtissue studies, cell viability was the endpoint as assessed  by Zeiss Axio Observer. For PDX drug studies, tumor volume was measured twice  weekly. Bulk RNA sequencing was performed to identify pathways enriched in  cells. RESULTS: We developed 13 NF1-associated MPNST-PDX and identified mutations or  structural abnormalities in NF1 (100%), SUZ12 (85%), EED (15%), TP53 (15%),  CDKN2A (85%), and chromosome 8 gain (77%). We successfully assembled PDX into 3D  microtissues, categorized as robust (>90% viability at 48 h), good (>50%), or  unusable (<50%). We evaluated drug response to ""robust"" or ""good"" microtissues,  namely MN-2, JH-2-002, JH-2-079-c, and WU-225. Drug response ex vivo predicted  drug response in vivo, and enhanced drug effects were observed in select models. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the successful establishment of a novel 3D  platform for drug discovery and MPNST biology exploration in a system  representative of the human condition.  © The Author(s) 2023.

This study aims to (1) investigate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in  children with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) using the Pediatric Quality of Life  inventory (PedsQL) and the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ); and (2) compare the  psychometric properties and content of these questionnaires in NF1 patients.  PedsQL and CHQ proxy-reports were administered to parents/caregivers of 160  patients with NF1 aged 5-12 years. HRQoL scores were compared with Dutch  population norms using independent t-tests. Psychometric properties (feasibility  and reliability) were assessed by floor/ceiling effects and Cronbach's alpha  coefficient. A principal component analysis (PCA) with varimax rotation was  performed to identify the data's internal structure. By content mapping, we  identified unique constructs of each questionnaire. Proxy-reported HRQoL was  significantly lower on all PedsQL subscales for children aged 5-7 years, and on  4/6 subscales for children aged 8-12 years compared to norms. Significantly  lower HRQoL was reported on 6/14 CHQ subscales (children 5-7 years) and 9/14  subscales (children 8-12 years). The PedsQL showed slightly better feasibility  and reliability. The PCA identified two components, representing psychosocial  and physical aspects of HRQoL, explaining 63% of total variance. Both  questionnaires showed relevant loadings on both components. The CHQ subscales  concerning parents and family were considered unique contributions.  Proxy-reported HRQoL of children with NF1 is significantly lower compared to  norms on multiple domains. Both questionnaires adequately measure HRQoL in  children with NF1. However, the PedsQL has slightly better psychometric  properties, while the CHQ covers a unique dimension of HRQoL associated with  disease impact on parents and family.  © 2023 The Authors.

Electronic address:  mkaneda@sahs.med.osaka-u.ac.jp.  Neurofibromatosis 1 is a prevalent hereditary neurocutaneous disorder. Among the  clinical phenotypes of neurofibromatosis 1, cutaneous neurofibroma (cNF) and  plexiform neurofibroma (pNF) have distinct clinical manifestations, and pNF  should be closely monitored owing to its malignant potential. However, the  detailed distinct features of neurofibromatosis 1 phenotypes remain unknown. To  determine whether the transcriptional features and microenvironment of cNF and  pNF differ, single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on isolated cNF and pNF  cells from the same patient. Six cNF and five pNF specimens from different  subjects were also immunohistochemically analyzed. Our findings revealed that  cNF and pNF had distinct transcriptional profiles even within the same subject.  pNF is enriched in Schwann cells with characteristics similar to those of their  malignant counterpart, fibroblasts, with a cancer-associated fibroblast-like  phenotype, angiogenic endothelial cells, and M2-like macrophages, whereas cNF is  enriched in CD8 T cells with tissue residency markers. The results of  immunohistochemical analyses performed on different subjects agreed with those  of single-cell RNA sequencing. This study found that cNF and pNF, the different  neurofibromatosis phenotypes in neurofibromatosis 1, from the same subject are  transcriptionally distinct in terms of the cell types involved, including T  cells.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is caused by a nonfunctional copy of the NF1  tumor suppressor gene that predisposes patients to the development of cutaneous  neurofibromas (cNFs), the skin tumor that is the hallmark of this condition.  Innumerable benign cNFs, each appearing by an independent somatic inactivation  of the remaining functional NF1 allele, form in nearly all patients with NF1.  One of the limitations in developing a treatment for cNFs is an incomplete  understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and limitations in experimental  modeling. Recent advances in preclinical in vitro and in vivo modeling have  substantially enhanced our understanding of cNF biology and created  unprecedented opportunities for therapeutic discovery. We discuss the current  state of cNF preclinical in vitro and in vivo model systems, including two- and  three-dimensional cell cultures, organoids, genetically engineered mice,  patient-derived xenografts, and porcine models. We highlight the models'  relationship to human cNFs and how they can be used to gain insight into cNF  development and therapeutic discovery.  Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

BACKGROUND: The notion of ""burden"" has taken a key place in the evaluation of  care, particularly in the case of rare diseases. The aim of this study was to  evaluate the psychometric properties of the burden of neurofibromatosis 1  questionnaire (BoN) and to determine the perceived disease burden. RESULTS: The 15-item BoN was translated into Persian, and no items were removed  based on content validity. The adequacy of the sample was acceptable  (KMO = 0.902), and Bartlett's test of sphericity revealed statistically  significant results (P < 0.001). Exploratory factor analysis revealed three  factors. The reliability of the scale was good (Cronbach's alpha: 0.90), and the  intraclass coefficient was 0.85. The severity of the burden of neurofibromatosis  was moderate, and the total mean burden score was 33.12 ± 16.12. CONCLUSIONS: The Persian version of the BoN is an acceptable tool in terms of  structure and content, and it specifically assesses the practical aspects of  daily activities for patients with neurofibromatosis.  © 2023.

IMPORTANCE: Neurofibromatoses (NF; NF1, NF2, and schwannomatosis) are hereditary  tumor predisposition syndromes with a risk for poor quality of life (QOL) and no  evidence-based treatments. OBJECTIVE: To compare a mind-body skills training program, the Relaxation  Response Resiliency Program for NF (3RP-NF), with a health education program  (Health Enhancement Program for NF; HEP-NF) for improvement of quality of life  among adults with NF. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This single-blind, remote randomized clinical  trial randomly assigned 228 English-speaking adults with NF from around the  world on a 1:1 basis, stratified by NF type, between October 1, 2017, and  January 31, 2021, with the last follow-up February 28, 2022. INTERVENTIONS: Eight 90-minute group virtual sessions of 3RP-NF or HEP-NF. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes were collected at baseline, after  treatment, and at 6-month and 1-year follow-up. The primary outcomes were  physical health and psychological domain scores of the World Health Organization  Quality of Life Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF). Secondary outcomes were the social  relationships and environment domain scores of the WHOQOL-BREF. Scores are  reported as transformed domain scores (range, 0-100, with higher scores  indicating higher QOL). Analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: Of 371 participants who underwent screening, 228 were randomized (mean  [SD] age, 42.7 [14.5] years; 170 women [75%]), and 217 attended 6 or more of 8  sessions and provided posttest data. Participants in both programs improved from  baseline to after treatment in primary outcomes of physical health QOL score  (3RP-NF, 5.1; 95% CI, 3.2-7.0; P < .001; HEP-NF, 6.4; 95% CI, 4.6-8.3; P < .001)  and psychological QOL score (3RP-NF, 8.5; 95% CI, 6.4-10.7; P < .001; HEP-NF,  9.2; 95% CI, 7.1-11.2; P < .001). Participants in the 3RP-NF group showed  sustained improvements after treatment to 12 months; posttreatment improvements  for the HEP-NF group diminished (between-group difference for physical health  QOL score, 4.9; 95% CI, 2.1-7.7; P = .001; effect size [ES] = 0.3; and  psychological QOL score, 3.7; 95% CI, 0.2-7.6; P = .06; ES = 0.2). Results were  similar for secondary outcomes of social relationships and environmental QOL.  There were significant between-group differences from baseline to 12 months in  favor of the 3RP-NF for physical health QOL score (3.6; 95% CI, 0.5-6.6;  P = .02; ES = 0.2), social relationships QOL score (6.9; 95% CI, 1.2-12.7;  P = .02; ES = 0.3), and environmental QOL score (3.5; 95% CI, 0.4-6.5; P = .02;  ES = 0.2). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial of 3RP-NF vs  HEP-NF, benefits from 3RP-NF and HEP-NF were comparable after treatment, but at  12 months from baseline, 3RP-NF was superior to HEP-NF on all primary and  secondary outcomes. Results support the implementation of 3RP-NF in routine  care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03406208.

(3)Department of Health and Biomedical Sciences, University of Texas Rio Grande  Valley, Brownsville, Texas, USA.  Evidence for myelin regulating higher-order brain function and disease is  rapidly accumulating; however, defining cellular/molecular mechanisms remains  challenging partially due to the dynamic brain physiology involving deep changes  during development, aging, and in response to learning and disease. Furthermore,  as the etiology of most neurological conditions remains obscure, most research  models focus on mimicking symptoms, which limits understanding of their  molecular onset and progression. Studying diseases caused by single gene  mutations represents an opportunity to understand brain dys/function, including  those regulated by myelin. Here, we discuss known and potential repercussions of  abnormal central myelin on the neuropathophysiology of Neurofibromatosis Type 1  (NF1). Most patients with this monogenic disease present with neurological  symptoms diverse in kind, severity, and onset/decline, including learning  disabilities, autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit and hyperactivity  disorder, motor coordination issues, and increased risk for depression and  dementia. Coincidentally, most NF1 patients show diverse white matter/myelin  abnormalities. Although myelin-behavior links were proposed decades ago, no  solid data can prove or refute this idea yet. A recent upsurge in myelin biology  understanding and research/therapeutic tools provides opportunities to address  this debate. As precision medicine moves forward, an integrative understanding  of all cell types disrupted in neurological conditions becomes a priority.  Hence, this review aims to serve as a bridge between fundamental  cellular/molecular myelin biology and clinical research in NF1.  © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

PURPOSE: Plexiform neurofibromas (PNF) are peripheral nerve sheath tumors that  cause significant morbidity in persons with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), yet  treatment options remain limited. To identify novel therapeutic targets for PNF,  we applied an integrated multi-omic approach to quantitatively profile kinome  enrichment in a mouse model that has predicted therapeutic responses in clinical  trials for NF1-associated PNF with high fidelity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Utilizing RNA sequencing combined with chemical proteomic  profiling of the functionally enriched kinome using multiplexed inhibitor beads  coupled with mass spectrometry, we identified molecular signatures predictive of  response to CDK4/6 and RAS/MAPK pathway inhibition in PNF. Informed by these  results, we evaluated the efficacy of the CDK4/6 inhibitor, abemaciclib, and the  ERK1/2 inhibitor, LY3214996, alone and in combination in reducing PNF tumor  burden in Nf1flox/flox;PostnCre mice. RESULTS: Converging signatures of CDK4/6 and RAS/MAPK pathway activation were  identified within the transcriptome and kinome that were conserved in both  murine and human PNF. We observed robust additivity of the CDK4/6 inhibitor,  abemaciclib, in combination with the ERK1/2 inhibitor, LY3214996, in murine and  human NF1(Nf1) mutant Schwann cells. Consistent with these findings, the  combination of abemaciclib (CDK4/6i) and LY3214996 (ERK1/2i) synergized to  suppress molecular signatures of MAPK activation and exhibited enhanced  antitumor activity in Nf1flox/flox;PostnCre mice in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide rationale for the clinical translation of  CDK4/6 inhibitors alone and in combination with therapies targeting the RAS/MAPK  pathway for the treatment of PNF and other peripheral nerve sheath tumors in  persons with NF1.  ©2023 American Association for Cancer Research.

Bewley AF(1), Akinwe TM(1), Turner TN(1), Gutmann DH(1).  Author information: (1)From the Departments of Medicine (A.F.B.), Genetics (T.M.A., T.N.T.), and  Neurology (D.H.G.), Washington University, St. Louis, MO.  OBJECTIVES: Variants in the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene are not only  responsible for the NF1 cancer predisposition syndrome, but also frequently  identified in cancers arising in the general population. While germline variants  are pathogenic, it is not known whether those that arise in cancer (somatic  variants) are passenger or driver variants. To address this question, we sought  to define the landscape of NF1 variants in sporadic cancers. METHODS: NF1 variants in sporadic cancers were compiled using data curated on  the c-Bio database and compared with published germline variants and Genome  Aggregation Database data. Pathogenicity was determined using Polyphen and  Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant prediction tools. RESULTS: The spectrum of NF1 variants in sporadic tumors differ from those most  commonly seen in individuals with NF1. In addition, the type and location of the  variants in sporadic cancer differ from germline variants, where a high  proportion of missense variants were found. Finally, many of the sporadic cancer  NF1 variants were not predicted to be pathogenic. DISCUSSION: Taken together, these findings suggest that a significant proportion  of NF1 variants in sporadic cancer may be passenger variants or hypomorphic  alleles. Further mechanistic studies are warranted to define their unique roles  in nonsyndromic cancer pathobiology.  Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

PURPOSE: To test the effects of the Relaxation Response Resiliency Program -  Neurofibromatosis (3RP-NF), a mind-body resilience program for people with NF,  on resilience factors from baseline to post-treatment and 6- and 12-month  follow-up. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a fully powered randomized clinical  trial (RCT) of 3RP-NF and health education control (HEP-NF). We recruited adults  with NF1, NF2, or schwannomatosis who reported stress or difficulty coping with  NF symptoms. Both conditions received 8 weekly 90-minute group sessions; 3RP-NF  focused on building resilience skills. We measured resilience factors via the  Measure of Current Status-A (adaptive coping), Cognitive and Affective  Mindfulness Scale-Revised (mindfulness), Gratitude Questionnaire-6 (gratitude),  Life Orientation Test Optimism Scale (optimism), and Medical Outcomes Study  Social Support Survey (perceived social support) at baseline, post-intervention,  and 6- and 12-month follow-up. We used linear mixed models with completely  unstructured covariance across up to four repeated measurements (baseline,  post-treatment, and 6- and 12-month follow-up) to investigate treatment effects  on resilience factors. RESULTS: We enrolled 228 individuals (Mage=42.7, SD = 14.6; 74.5% female; 87.7%  White; 72.8% NF1, 14.0% NF2, 13.2% schwannomatosis). Within groups, both 3RP-NF  and HEP-NF showed statistically significant improvements in all outcomes across  timepoints. 3RP-NF showed significantly greater improvement in adaptive coping  compared to HEP-NF from baseline to post-intervention and baseline to 6 months  (Mdifference= 0.29; 95% CI 0.13-0.46; p < 0.001; Mdifference= 0.25; 95% CI  0.07-0.33; p = 0.005); there were no other between-group differences amongst the  remaining resilience factors. CONCLUSION: 3RP-NF showed promise in sustainably improving coping abilities  amongst people with NF. TRIAL REGISTRATION INFORMATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03406208.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder, with up  to 50% of patients clinically displaying skeletal defects. Currently, the  pathogenesis of bone disorders in NF1 patients is unclear, and there are no  effective preventive and treatment measures. In this study, we found that  knockout of the NF1 gene reduced cAMP levels and osteogenic differentiation in  an osteoblast model, and icariin activated the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway to promote  osteoblast differentiation of the NF1 gene knockout cell model by increasing  intracellular cAMP levels. The PKA selective inhibitor H89 significantly  impaired the stimulatory effect of icariin on osteogenesis in the NF1 cell  model. In this study, an osteoblast model of NF1 was successfully constructed,  and icariin was applied to the cell model for the first time. The results will  help to elucidate the molecular mechanism of NF1 bone disease and provide new  ideas for the clinical prevention and treatment of NF1 bone disease and drug  development in the future.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) results from germline mutations in the  tumor-suppressor gene NF1 and predisposes patients to developing nervous system  tumors. Twenty percent of NF1 patients harbor nonsense mutations resulting in  premature termination codons (PTCs). Nonsense suppression therapies can  facilitate ribosomal readthrough of PTCs to restore full-length protein, but  their potential in NF1 is underexplored. We developed a minipig model of NF1  carrying a PTC to test whether nonsense suppression could restore expression of  the NF1-encoded protein neurofibromin in vitro and in vivo. Nonsense suppression  did not reliably increase neurofibromin in primary NF1-/- Schwann cells isolated  from minipig neurofibromas but could reduce phosphorylated ERK. Gentamicin  in vivo produced a similar plasma pharmacokinetic profile to humans and was  detectable in clinically relevant tissues, including cerebral cortex, sciatic  nerve, optic nerve, and skin. In gentamicin-treated animals, increased  neurofibromin expression was seen in the optic nerve. Nonsense-mediated decay  (NMD) causes degradation of transcripts with PTCs, which could impede nonsense  suppression therapies. Nonsense suppression in combination with NMD inhibition  restored neurofibromin protein expression in primary NF1-/- Schwann cells  isolated from minipig neurofibromas. Thus, the effectiveness of nonsense  suppression therapies can be improved in NF1 by the concurrent use of NMD  inhibitors.  © 2023 The Authors.

Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) is a tumor predisposition syndrome caused by  germline inactivating mutations in the NF2 gene encoding the merlin tumor  suppressor. Patients develop multiple benign tumor types in the nervous system  including bilateral vestibular schwannomas (VS). Standard treatments include  surgery and radiation therapy, which may lead to loss of hearing, impaired  facial nerve function, and other complications. Kinase inhibitor monotherapies  have been evaluated clinically for NF2 patients with limited success, and more  effective nonsurgical therapies are urgently needed. Schwannoma model cells  treated with PI3K inhibitors upregulate activity of the focal adhesion kinase  (FAK) family as a compensatory survival pathway. We screened combinations of 13  clinically relevant PI3K and FAK inhibitors using human isogenic normal and  merlin-deficient Schwann cell lines. The most efficacious combination was  PI3K/mTOR inhibitor omipalisib with SRC/FAK inhibitor dasatinib. Sub-GI50 doses  of the single drugs blocked phosphorylation of their major target proteins. The  combination was superior to either single agent in promoting a G1 cell-cycle  arrest and produced a 44% decrease in tumor growth over a 2-week period in a  pilot orthotopic allograft model. Evaluation of single and combination drugs in  six human primary VS cell models revealed the combination was superior to the  monotherapies in 3 of 6 VS samples, highlighting inter-tumor variability between  patients consistent with observations from clinical trials with other molecular  targeted agents. Dasatinib alone performed as well as the combination in the  remaining three samples. Preclinically validated combination therapies hold  promise for NF2 patients and warrants further study in clinical trials.  ©2023 American Association for Cancer Research.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic neurodevelopmental  disorder commonly associated with impaired cognitive function. Despite the  well-explored functional roles of neural oscillations in neurotypical  populations, only a limited number of studies have investigated oscillatory  activity in the NF1 population. METHODS: We compared oscillatory spectral power and theta phase coherence in a  paediatric sample with NF1 (N = 16; mean age: 13.03 years; female: n = 7) to an  age/sex-matched typically developing control group (N = 16; mean age:  13.34 years; female: n = 7) using electroencephalography measured during rest  and during working memory task performance. RESULTS: Relative to typically developing children, the NF1 group displayed  higher resting state slow wave power and a lower peak alpha frequency. Moreover,  higher theta power and frontoparietal theta phase coherence were observed in the  NF1 group during working memory task performance, but these differences  disappeared when controlling for baseline (resting state) activity. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, results suggest that NF1 is characterised by aberrant  resting state oscillatory activity that may contribute towards the cognitive  impairments experienced in this population.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are highly aggressive  soft-tissue sarcomas that arise from neural tissues and carry a poor prognosis.  Previously, we found that the glutamine amidotransferase inhibitor JHU395  partially impeded tumor growth in preclinical models of MPNST. JHU395 inhibits  de novo purine synthesis in human MPNST cells and murine tumors with partial  decreases in purine monophosphates. On the basis of prior studies showing  enhanced efficacy when glutamine amidotransferase inhibition was combined with  the antimetabolite 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), we hypothesized that such a  combination would be efficacious in MPNST. Given the known toxicity associated  with 6-MP, we set out to develop a more efficient and well-tolerated drug that  targets the purine salvage pathway. Here, we report the discovery of Pro-905, a  phosphoramidate protide that delivered the active nucleotide antimetabolite  thioguanosine monophosphate (TGMP) to tumors over 2.5 times better than  equimolar 6-MP. Pro-905 effectively prevented the incorporation of purine  salvage substrates into nucleic acids and inhibited colony formation of human  MPNST cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, Pro-905 inhibited MPNST  growth and was well-tolerated in both human patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and  murine flank MPNST models. When combined with JHU395, Pro-905 enhanced the  colony formation inhibitory potency of JHU395 in human MPNST cells and augmented  the antitumor efficacy of JHU395 in mice. In summary, the dual inhibition of the  de novo and purine salvage pathways in preclinical models may safely be used to  enhance therapeutic efficacy against MPNST.  ©2023 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.

Author information: (1)Department of Neurosurgery, Keio University School of Medicine, 35  Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.  Drug repositioning (DR) is the process of identifying novel therapeutic  potentials for already-approved drugs and discovering new therapies for  untreated diseases. DR can play an important role in optimizing the pre-clinical  process of developing novel drugs by saving time and cost compared with the  process of de novo drug discovery. Although the number of publications related  to DR has rapidly increased, most therapeutic approaches were reported for  malignant tumors. Surgical resection represents the definitive treatment for  benign tumors of the central nervous system (BTCNS). However, treatment options  remain limited for surgery-, chemotherapy- and radiation-refractory BTCNS, as  well as malignant tumors. Meningioma, pituitary neuroendocrine tumor (PitNET),  and schwannoma are the most common BTCNS. The treatment strategy using DR may be  applied for refractory BTCNS, such as Grade 2 meningiomas, neurofibromatosis  type 2-related schwannomatosis, and PitNETs with cavernous sinus invasion. In  the setting of BTCNS, stable disease can provide significant benefit to the  patient. DR may provide a longer duration of survival without disease  progression for patients with refractory BTCNS. This article reviews the utility  of DR for refractory BTCNS.

OBJECTIVE: In auditory brainstem implant (ABI) surgery, array placement may be  optimized by electrophysiological information of adequate brainstem activation  gained from electrically evoked auditory brainstem responses (EABR). This study  aims 1) to characterize in detail the EABR from ABI implantation, 2) to  introduce an EABR Classification Scheme, and 3) to analyze data for their  correlation with individual patients' findings. METHODS: Out of a continuous series of 54 patients who received an ABI between  2005 and 2019, 23 Neurofibromatosis Type 2 patients with complete documentation  of 154 recordings were selected for offline analysis and for development and  evaluation of a new EABR Classification Scheme comprising Class A: three vertex  positive peaks, Class B:two peaks, Class C: a combination of one peak and a  second melted double peak, Class D: one sole vertex positive peak and Class E:  no peaks. RESULTS: All 23 subjects showed EABR at final ABI position and experienced  auditory sensations at first activation. The most frequent morphology consisted  of two peaks, Classes B and C. Identified mean latencies were for P1 0.42 ms  (±0.095), P2 1.42 ms (±0.244) and P3 2.41 ms (±0.329). Peak latencies correlated  positively with tumor extensions (p < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides clear instructions on optimal EABR performance  and evaluation. SIGNIFICANCE: The new EABR Classification Scheme relies on a fast ""online""  identification of vertex positive peaks at the estimated post-artifact phase.  The variability in EABR morphology provides an individual snapshot of the actual  structural and functional status of the brainstem.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are deadly sarcomas, which  desperately need effective therapies. Half of all MPNSTs arise in patients with  neurofibromatosis type I (NF1), a common inherited disease. NF1 patients can  develop benign lesions called plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs), often in  adolescence, and over time, some PNFs, but not all, will transform into MPNSTs.  A deeper understanding of the molecular and genetic alterations driving  PNF-MPNST transformation will guide development of more targeted and effective  treatments for these patients. This review focuses on an oncogenic transcription  factor, FOXM1, which is a powerful oncogene in other cancers but little studied  in MPNSTs. Elevated expression of FOXM1 was seen in patient MPNSTs and  correlated with poor survival, but otherwise, its role in the disease is  unknown. We discuss what is known about FOXM1 in MPNSTs relative to other  cancers and how FOXM1 may be regulated by and/or regulate the most commonly  altered players in MPNSTs, particularly in the MEK and CDK4/6 kinase pathways.  We conclude by considering FOXM1, MEK, and CDK4/6 as new, clinically relevant  targets for MPNST therapy.

Single nucleotide variants in the general population are common genomic  alterations, where the majority are presumed to be silent polymorphisms without  known clinical significance. Using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)  cerebral organoid modeling of the 1.4 megabase Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)  deletion syndrome, we previously discovered that the cytokine receptor-like  factor-3 (CRLF3) gene, which is co-deleted with the NF1 gene, functions as a  major regulator of neuronal maturation. Moreover, children with NF1 and the  CRLF3L389P variant have greater autism burden, suggesting that this gene might  be important for neurologic function. To explore the functional consequences of  this variant, we generated CRLF3L389P-mutant hiPSC lines and Crlf3L389P-mutant  genetically engineered mice. While this variant does not impair protein  expression, brain structure, or mouse behavior, CRLF3L389P-mutant human cerebral  organoids and mouse brains exhibit impaired neuronal maturation and dendrite  formation. In addition, Crlf3L389P-mutant mouse neurons have reduced dendrite  lengths and branching, without any axonal deficits. Moreover, Crlf3L389P-mutant  mouse hippocampal neurons have decreased firing rates and synaptic current  amplitudes relative to wild type controls. Taken together, these findings  establish the CRLF3L389P variant as functionally deleterious and suggest that it  may be a neurodevelopmental disease modifier.  © The Author(s) 2023.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (Nf1) is a neurodevelopmental disorder and tumor  syndrome caused by loss of function mutations in the neurofibromin gene (Nf1)  and is estimated to affect 100,000 people in the US. Behavioral alterations and  cognitive deficits have been found in 50-70% of children with Nf1 and include  specific problems with attention, visual perception, language, learning,  attention, and executive function. These behavioral alterations and cognitive  deficits are observed in the absence of tumors or macroscopic structural  abnormalities in the central nervous system. No effective treatments for the  behavioral and cognitive disabilities of Nf1 exist. Inhibition of the anaplastic  lymphoma kinase (Alk), a kinase which is negatively regulated by neurofibromin,  allows for testing the hypothesis that this inhibition may be therapeutically  beneficial in Nf1. In this review, we discuss this area of research and  directions for the development of alternative therapeutic strategies to inhibit  Alk. Even if the incidence of adverse reactions of currently available Alk  inhibitors was reduced to half the dose, we anticipate that a long-term  treatment would pose challenges for efficacy, safety, and tolerability.  Therefore, future efforts are warranted to investigate alternative, potentially  less toxic and more specific strategies to inhibit Alk function.

(#)Contributed equally  Plexiform neurofibroma (PN) is a leading cause of morbidity in children with the  genetic condition Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1), often disfiguring or  threatening vital structures. During formation of PN, a complex tumor  microenvironment (TME) develops, with recruitment of neoplastic and  non-neoplastic cell types being critical for growth and progression. Due to the  cohesive cellularity of PN, single-cell RNA-sequencing is difficult and may  result in a loss of detection of critical cellular subpopulations. To bypass  this barrier, we performed single-nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) on 8 frozen  PN samples, and integrated this with spatial transcriptomics (ST) in 4 PN  samples and immunohistochemistry to provide morphological context to  transcriptomic data. SnRNA-seq analysis definitively charted the heterogeneous  cellular subpopulations in the PN TME, with the predominant fraction being  fibroblast subtypes. PN showed a remarkable amount of inter-sample homogeneity  regarding cellular subpopulation proportions despite being resected from a  variety of anatomical locations. ST analysis identified distinct cellular  subpopulations which were annotated using snRNA-seq data and correlated with  histological features. Schwann cell/fibroblast interactions were identified by  receptor/ligand interaction analysis demonstrating a high probability of  Neurexin 1/Neuroligin 1 (NRXN1/NLGN1) receptor-ligand cross-talk predicted  between fibroblasts and non-myelinated Schwann cells (NM-SC) and subtypes,  respectively. We observed aberrant expression of NRXN1 and NLGN1 in our PN  snRNA-seq data compared to a normal mouse sciatic nerve single-cell RNA-seq  dataset. This pathway has never been described in PN and may indicate a clear  and direct communication pathway between putative NM-SC cells of origin and  surrounding fibroblasts, potentially driving disease progression. SnRNA-seq  integrated with spatial transcriptomics advances our understanding of the  complex cellular heterogeneity of PN TME and identify potential novel  communication pathways that may drive disease progression, a finding that could  provide translational therapy options for patients with these devastating tumors  of childhood and early adulthood.  © 2023.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a genetic syndrome characterized by a wide variety  of tumor and non-tumor manifestations. Bone-related issues, such as scoliosis,  tibial dysplasia, and low bone mineral density, are a significant source of  morbidity for this population with limited treatment options. Some of the  challenges to developing such treatments include the lack of consensus regarding  the optimal methods to assess bone health in neurofibromatosis type 1 and  limited data regarding the natural history of these manifestations. In this  review, the Functional Committee of the Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis  and Schwannomatosis International Collaboration: (1) presents the available  techniques for measuring overall bone health and metabolism in persons with  neurofibromatosis type 1, (2) reviews data for use of each of these measures in  the neurofibromatosis type 1 population, and (3) describes the strengths and  limitations for each method as they might be used in clinical trials targeting  neurofibromatosis type 1 bone manifestations. The Response Evaluation in  Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis International Collaboration supports the  development of a prospective, longitudinal natural history study focusing on the  bone-related manifestations and relevant biomarkers of neurofibromatosis type 1.  In addition, we suggest that the neurofibromatosis type 1 research community  consider adding the less burdensome measurements of bone health as exploratory  endpoints in ongoing or planned clinical trials for other neurofibromatosis type  1 manifestations to expand knowledge in the field.

Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common genetically inherited  disorders that affects 1 in 3000 children annually. Clinical manifestations vary  widely but nearly always include the development of cutaneous, plexiform and  diffuse neurofibromas that are managed over many years. Recent single-cell  transcriptomics profiling efforts of neurofibromas have begun to reveal cell  signaling processes. However, the cell signaling networks in mature,  non-cutaneous neurofibromas remain unexplored. Here, we present insights into  the cellular composition and signaling within mature neurofibromas, contrasting  with normal adjacent tissue, in a porcine model of NF1 using single-cell RNA  sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis and histopathological characterization. These  neurofibromas exhibited classic diffuse-type histologic morphology and expected  patterns of S100, SOX10, GFAP, and CD34 immunohistochemistry. The porcine mature  neurofibromas closely resemble human neurofibromas histologically and contain  all known cellular components of their human counterparts. The scRNA-seq  confirmed the presence of all expected cell types within these neurofibromas and  identified novel populations of fibroblasts and immune cells, which may  contribute to the tumor microenvironment by suppressing inflammation, promoting  M2 macrophage polarization, increasing fibrosis, and driving the proliferation  of Schwann cells. Notably, we identified tumor-associated IDO1 +/CD274+ (PD-L1)  + dendritic cells, which represent the first such observation in any NF1 animal  model and suggest the role of the upregulation of immune checkpoints in mature  neurofibromas. Finally, we observed that cell types in the tumor  microenvironment are poised to promote immune evasion, extracellular matrix  reconstruction, and nerve regeneration.

Cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs) are characteristic of neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1),  yet their immune microenvironment is incompletely known. A total of 61 cNFs from  10 patients with NF1 were immunolabeled for different types of T cells and  macrophages, and the cell densities were correlated with clinical  characteristics. Eight cNFs and their overlying skin were analyzed for T cell  receptor CDR domain sequences, and mass spectrometry of 15 cNFs and the  overlying skin was performed to study immune-related processes. Intratumoral T  cells were detected in all cNFs. Tumors from individuals younger than the median  age of the study participants (33 years), growing tumors, and tumors smaller  than the data set median showed increased T cell density. Most samples displayed  intratumoral or peritumoral aggregations of CD3-positive cells. T cell receptor  sequencing demonstrated that the skin and cNFs host distinct T cell populations,  whereas no dominant cNF-specific T cell clones were detected. Unique T cell  clones were fewer in cNFs than in skin, and mass spectrometry suggested lower  expression of proteins related to T cell-mediated immunity in cNFs than in skin.  CD163-positive cells, suggestive of M2 macrophages, were abundant in cNFs. Human  cNFs have substantial T cell and macrophage populations that may be  tumor-specific.  Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant condition caused by  germline mutations in the neurofibromin 1 (NF1) gene. Children with NF1 are  prone to the development of multiple nervous system abnormalities, including  autism and brain tumors, which could reflect the effect of NF1 mutation on  microglia function. Using heterozygous Nf1-mutant mice, we previously  demonstrated that impaired purinergic signaling underlies deficits in microglia  process extension and phagocytosis in situ. To determine whether these  abnormalities are also observed in human microglia in the setting of NF1, we  leveraged an engineered isogenic series of human induced pluripotent stem cells  to generate human microglia-like (hiMGL) cells heterozygous for three different  NF1 gene mutations found in patients with NF1. Whereas all NF1-mutant and  isogenic control hiMGL cells expressed classical microglia markers and exhibited  similar transcriptomes and cytokine/chemokine release profiles, only NF1-mutant  hiMGL cells had defects in P2X receptor activation, phagocytosis and motility.  Taken together, these findings indicate that heterozygous NF1 mutations impair a  subset of the functional properties of human microglia, which could contribute  to the neurological abnormalities seen in children with NF1.  © 2023.

Electronic address: eric.pasmant@inserm.fr.  Neurofibromatosis type-1 is a genetic disorder caused by loss-of-function  variants in the tumor-suppressor NF1. Approximately 4% to 11% of  neurofibromatosis type-1 patients have a NF1 locus complete deletion resulting  from nonallelic homologous recombination between low copy repeats. Codeleted  genes probably account for the more severe phenotype observed in NF1-deleted  patients. This genotype-phenotype correlation highlights the need for a detailed  molecular description. A droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) set along the NF1 locus was  designed to delimitate the three recurrent NF1 deletion breakpoints. The ddPCR  was tested in 121 samples from nonrelated NF1-deleted patients. Classification  based on ddPCR versus multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA)  was compared. In addition, microsatellites were analyzed to identify parental  origin of deletions. ddPCR identified 77 type-1 (64%), 20 type-2 (16%), 7 type-3  (6%), and 17 atypical deletions (14%). The results were comparable with MLPA,  except for three atypical deletions misclassified as type-2 using MLPA, for  which the SUZ12 gene was not deleted. A significant maternal bias (25 of 30) in  the origin of deletions was identified. This study proposes a fast and efficient  ddPCR quantification to allow fine NF1 deletion classification. It indicates  that ddPCR can be implemented easily into routine diagnosis to complement the  techniques dedicated to NF1 point variant identification. This new tool may help  unravel the genetic basis conditioning phenotypic variability in NF1-deleted  patients and offer tailored genetic counseling.

They develop in the dermis and  can number in the thousands. cNFs can be itchy and painful and negatively impact  self-esteem. There is no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug for  their treatment. Here, we screen a library of FDA-approved drugs using a cNF  cell model derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) generated  from an NF1 patient. We engineer an NF1 mutation in the second allele to mimic  loss of heterozygosity, differentiate the NF1+/- and NF1-/- hiPSCs into Schwann  cell precursors (SCPs), and use them to screen a drug library to assess for  inhibition of NF1-/- but not NF1+/- cell proliferation. We identify econazole  nitrate as being effective against NF1-/- hiPSC-SCPs. Econazole cream  selectively induces apoptosis in Nf1-/- murine nerve root neurosphere cells and  human cNF xenografts. This study supports further testing of econazole for cNF  treatment.  Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

PMID:38115252,Identification of hub genes and drug candidates for NF2-related vestibular schwannoma by bioinformatics tools.,"Identification of hub genes and drug candidates for NF2-related vestibular  schwannoma by bioinformatics tools.  Yuan J(1), Fu Y, Liu Y.  Author information: (1)Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, The Second  Affiliated Hospital, Jiangxi Medical College, Nanchang University, Nanchang,  Jiangxi, China.  Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2)-related vestibular schwannoma (NF2-VS) is a rare  genetic disorder that results in bilateral acoustic neuromas. However, the exact  pathogenesis of the disease is still unclear. This study aims to use  bioinformatics analyses to identify potential hub genes and therapeutic. We  retrieved the mRNA expression profiles (GSE108524 and GSE141801) of NF2-VS from  the database, and selected the leading 25% genes with the most variance across  samples for weighted correlation network analysis. Subsequently, we conducted  gene ontology term and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes signaling network  enrichment analyses. The STRING database was employed for protein-protein  interaction (PPI) axis construction. The mRNA-miRNA modulatory network was  generated via the miRTarBase database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs)  were identified via the R package ""limma"" in both datasets, and hub genes were  screened via intersection of common DEGs, candidate hub genes from the PPI axis,  and candidate hub genes from the key module. Finally, common DEGs were uploaded  onto the connectivity map database to determine drug candidates. Based on our  observations, the blue module exhibited the most significant relation to NF2-VS,  and it included the NF2 gene. Using enrichment analysis, we demonstrated that  the blue modules were intricately linked to modulations of cell proliferation,  migration, adhesion, junction, and actin skeleton. Overall, 356 common DEGs were  screened in both datasets, and 33 genes carrying a degree > 15 were chosen as  candidate hub genes in the PPI axis. Subsequently, 4 genes, namely, GLUL, CAV1,  MYH11, and CCND1 were recognized as real hub genes. In addition, 10 drugs with  enrichment scores < -0.7 were identified as drug candidates. Our conclusions  offered a novel insight into the potential underlying mechanisms behind NF2-VS.  These findings may facilitate the identification of novel therapeutic targets in  the future.

(#)Contributed equally  PURPOSE: Plexiform neurofibromas (PNF) are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors  (PNST) associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Despite similar  histologic appearance, these neoplasms exhibit diverse evolutionary  trajectories, with a subset progressing to malignant peripheral nerve sheath  tumor (MPNST), the leading cause of premature death in individuals with NF1.  Malignant transformation of PNF often occurs through the development of atypical  neurofibroma (ANF) precursor lesions characterized by distinct histopathologic  features and CDKN2A copy-number loss. Although genomic studies have uncovered  key driver events promoting tumor progression, the transcriptional changes  preceding malignant transformation remain poorly defined. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Here we resolve gene-expression profiles in PNST across the  neurofibroma-to-MPNST continuum in NF1 patients and mouse models, revealing  early molecular features associated with neurofibroma evolution and  transformation. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrate that ANF exhibit enhanced signatures of  antigen presentation and immune response, which are suppressed as malignant  transformation ensues. MPNST further displayed deregulated survival and mitotic  fidelity pathways, and targeting key mediators of these pathways, CENPF and  BIRC5, disrupted the growth and viability of human MPNST cell lines and primary  murine Nf1-Cdkn2a-mutant Schwann cell precursors. Finally, neurofibromas  contiguous with MPNST manifested distinct alterations in core oncogenic and  immune surveillance programs, suggesting that early molecular events driving  disease progression may precede histopathologic evidence of malignancy. CONCLUSIONS: If validated prospectively in future studies, these signatures may  serve as molecular diagnostic tools to augment conventional histopathologic  diagnosis by identifying neurofibromas at high risk of undergoing malignant  transformation, facilitating risk-adapted care.  ©2023 American Association for Cancer Research.

Background: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder characterized  by heterozygous germline NF1 gene mutations that predispose patients to  developing plexiform neurofibromas, which are benign but often disfiguring  tumors of the peripheral nerve sheath induced by loss of heterozygosity at the  NF1 locus. These can progress to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors  (MPNSTs). There are no approved drug treatments for adults with NF1-related  inoperable plexiform neurofibromas, and only one drug (selumetinib), which is an  FDA-approved targeted therapy for the treatment of symptomatic pediatric  plexiform neurofibromas, highlighting the need for additional drug screening and  development. In high-throughput screening, the effectiveness of drugs against  cell lines is often assessed by measuring in vitro potency (AC50) or the area  under the curve (AUC). However, the variability of dose-response curves across  drugs and cell lines and the frequency of partial effectiveness suggest that  these measures alone fail to provide a full picture of overall efficacy.  Methods: Using concentration-response data, we combined response effectiveness  (EFF) and potency (AC50) into (a) a score characterizing the effect of a  compound on a single cell line, S = log[EFF/AC50], and (b) a relative score, ΔS,  characterizing the relative difference between a reference (e.g., non-tumor) and  test (tumor) cell line. ΔS was applied to data from high-throughput screening  (HTS) of a drug panel tested on NF1-/- tumor cells, using immortalized non-tumor  NF1+/- cells as a reference. Results: We identified drugs with sensitivity,  targeting expected pathways, such as MAPK-ERK and PI3K-AKT, as well as  serotonin-related targets, among others. The ΔS technique used here, in tandem  with a supplemental ΔS web tool, simplifies HTS analysis and may provide a  springboard for further investigations into drug response in NF1-related  cancers. The tool may also prove useful for drug development in a variety of  other cancers.  DOI: 10.3390/cancers15245811 PMCID: PMC10742026 PMID: 38136356  Conflict of interest statement: Authors Paul O.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Individuals with neurofibromatosis 1 may experience changes in  their appearance due to physical manifestations of the disorders and/or  treatment sequelae. Appearance concerns related to these physical changes can  lead to psychological distress and poorer quality of life. While many  neurofibromatosis 1 clinical trials focus on assessing changes in tumor volume,  evaluating patients' perspectives on corresponding changes in symptoms such as  physical appearance can be key secondary outcomes. We aimed to determine whether  any existing patient-reported outcome measures are appropriate for evaluating  changes in appearance concerns within neurofibromatosis 1 clinical trials. METHODS: After updating our previously published systematic review process, we  used it to identify and rate existing patient-reported outcome measures related  to disfigurement and appearance. Using a systematic literature search and  initial triage process, we focused on identifying patient-reported outcome  measures that could be used to evaluate changes in appearance concerns in  plexiform or cutaneous neurofibroma clinical trials in neurofibromatosis 1. Our  revised Patient-Reported Outcome Rating and Acceptance Tool for Endpoints then  was used to evaluate each published patient-reported outcome measures in five  domains, including (1) respondent characteristics, (2) content validity, (3)  scoring format and interpretability, (4) psychometric data, and (5) feasibility.  The highest-rated patient-reported outcome measures were then re-reviewed in a  side-by-side comparison to generate a final consensus recommendation. RESULTS: Eleven measures assessing appearance concerns were reviewed and rated;  no measures were explicitly designed to assess appearance concerns related to  neurofibromatosis 1. The FACE-Q Craniofacial Module-Appearance Distress scale  was the top-rated measure for potential use in neurofibromatosis 1 clinical  trials. Strengths of the measure included that it was rigorously developed,  included individuals with neurofibromatosis 1 in the validation sample, was  applicable to children and adults, covered item topics deemed important by  neurofibromatosis 1 patient representatives, exhibited good psychometric  properties, and was feasible for use in neurofibromatosis 1 trials. Limitations  included a lack of validation in older adults, no published information  regarding sensitivity to change in clinical trials, and limited availability in  languages other than English. CONCLUSION: The Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis  patient-reported outcome working group currently recommends the FACE-Q  Craniofacial Module Appearance Distress scale to evaluate patient-reported  changes in appearance concerns in clinical trials for neurofibromatosis  1-related plexiform or cutaneous neurofibromas. Additional research is needed to  validate this measure in people with neurofibromatosis 1, including older adults  and those with tumors in various body locations, and explore the effects of  nontumor manifestations on appearance concerns in people with neurofibromatosis  1 and schwannomatosis.

PURPOSE: To develop the PROMIS Pediatric Stigma (PPS) and Skin (PPS-Skin) by  constructing a common metric for measuring stigma in children with various  conditions, while capturing the unique features of each condition. METHODS: Data from 860 children, ages 8-17, with a diagnosis of epilepsy, pNF  (neurofibromatosis type 1 associated neurofibroma plexform), MD (muscular  dystrophy), cancer, or skin conditions recruited from three projects were  analyzed. Children with epilepsy, pNF and MD (sample-1) completed the original  18-item Neuro-QoL Stigma, while children with cancer and skin conditions (e.g.,  atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and genetic skin disorders; sample-2) completed a  16-item version and 6 additional skin related items. Exploratory factor analysis  (EFA) and confirmatory analysis (CFA) were used to evaluate unidimensionality of  24 stigma items. Differential item functioning (DIF) was used to evaluate  measurement equivalence on group, gender, age, and conditions. Item response  theory model (IRT) was used to construct the final measure. RESULTS: Sufficient unidimensionality was supported by both EFA and CFA. No  items showed significant DIF indicating stable measurement properties across  groups of comparison. All items fit the IRT model and were able to be calibrated  together to form the PPS which consists of 18 core items. The PPS-Skin (18 cores  items + 6 skin items) was developed by calibrating 6 skin items onto the common  metric as the PPS. CONCLUSIONS: We used IRT techniques to successfully develop the PPS and the  PPS-Skin, which share a common metric and account for unique and common concerns  related to chronic conditions.  © 2024.

RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) are peripheral nerve  tumors that occur in 25-50 % of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. PNs may  have complex, diffused, and irregular shapes. The objective of this work was to  develop a volumetric quantification method for PNs as clinical assessment is  currently based on unidimensional measurement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A semi-automatic segmentation technique based on mean  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) intensity thresholding (SSTMean) was developed  and compared to a similar and previously published technique based on minimum  image intensity thresholding (SSTMini). The performance (volume and computation  time) of the two techniques was compared to manual tracings of 15 tumors of  different locations, shapes, and sizes. Performance was also assessed using  different MRI sequences. Reproducibility was assessed by inter-observer  analysis. RESULTS: When compared to manual tracing, quantification performed with SSTMean  was not significantly different (mean difference: 1.2 %), while volumes computed  by SSTMini were significantly different (p < .0001, mean difference: 13.4 %).  Volumes quantified by SSTMean were also significantly different than the ones  assessed by SSTMini (p < .0001). Using SSTMean, volumes quantified with short TI  inversion recovery, T1-, and T2-weighted imaging were not significantly  different. Computation times used by SSTMean and SSTMini were significantly  lower than for manual segmentation (p < .0001). The highest difference measured  by two users was 8 cm3. CONCLUSION: Our method showed accuracy compared to a current gold standard  (manual tracing) and reproducibility between users. The refined segmentation  threshold and the possibility to define multiple regions-of-interest to initiate  segmentation may have contributed to its performance. The versatility and speed  of our method may prove useful to better monitor volumetric changes in lesions  of patients enrolled in clinical trials to assessing response to therapy.  © 2023 The Authors.

Cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs) are benign Schwann cell (SC) tumors arising from  subepidermal glia. Individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) may develop  thousands of cNFs, which greatly affect their quality of life. cNF growth is  driven by the proliferation of NF1-/- SCs and their interaction with the NF1+/-  microenvironment. We analyzed the crosstalk between human cNF-derived SCs and  fibroblasts (FBs), identifying an expression signature specific to the SC-FB  interaction. We validated the secretion of proteins involved in immune cell  migration, suggesting a role of SC-FB crosstalk in immune cell recruitment. The  signature also captured components of developmental signaling pathways,  including the cAMP elevator G protein-coupled receptor 68 (GPR68). Activation of  Gpr68 by ogerin in combination with the MEK inhibitor (MEKi) selumetinib reduced  viability and induced differentiation and death of human cNF-derived primary  SCs, a result corroborated using an induced pluripotent stem cell-derived 3D  neurofibromasphere model. Similar results were obtained using other Gpr68  activators or cAMP analogs/adenylyl cyclase activators in combination with  selumetinib. Interestingly, whereas primary SC cultures restarted their  proliferation after treatment with selumetinib alone was stopped, the  combination of ogerin-selumetinib elicited a permanent halt on SC expansion that  persisted after drug removal. These results indicate that unbalancing the Ras  and cAMP pathways by combining MEKi and cAMP elevators could be used as a  potential treatment for cNFs.

There is a demonstrated need for new chemotherapy options in pediatric oncology,  as pediatric solid tumors continue to plateau at 60% with event-free survival.  Imipridones, a novel class of small molecules, represent a potential new  therapeutic option, with promising pre-clinical data and emerging clinical trial  data in adult malignancies. ONC201, ONC206, and ONC212 are imipridones showing  pro-apoptotic anti-cancer response. Using cell viability assays, and protein  immunoblotting, we were able to demonstrate single-agent efficacy of all 3  imipridones inducing cell death in pediatric solid tumor cell lines, including  osteosarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, Ewing sarcoma (EWS), and  neuroblastoma. ONC201 displayed IC50 values for non-H3K27M-mutated EWS cell  lines ranging from 0.86 µM (SK-N-MC) to 2.76 µM (RD-ES), which were comparable  to the range of IC50 values for H3K27M-mutated DIPG cells lines (range 1.06 to  1.56 µM). ONC212 demonstrated the highest potency in single-agent cell killing,  followed by ONC206, and ONC201. Additionally, pediatric solid tumor cells were  treated with single-agent therapy with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi)  vorinostat, entinostat, and panobinostat, showing cell killing with all 3 HDACi  drugs, with panobinostat showing the greatest potency. We demonstrate that  dual-agent therapy with combinations of imipridones and HDACi lead to  synergistic cell killing and apoptosis in all pediatric solid tumor cell lines  tested, with ONC212 and panobinostat combinations demonstrating maximal potency.  The imipridones induced the integrated stress response with ATF4 and TRAIL  receptor upregulation, as well as reduced expression of ClpX. Hyperacetylation  of H3K27 was associated with synergistic killing of tumor cells following  exposure to imipridone plus HDAC inhibitor therapies. Our results introduce a  novel class of small molecules to treat pediatric solid tumors in a precision  medicine framework. Use of impridones in pediatric oncology is novel and shows  promising pre-clinical efficacy in pediatric solid tumors, including in  combination with HDAC inhibitors.  AJCR Copyright © 2023.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a disorder in which RAS is constitutively  activated due to the loss of the Ras-GTPase-activating activity of  neurofibromin. RAS must be prenylated (i.e., farnesylated or geranylgeranylated)  to traffic and function properly. Previous studies showed that the anti-growth  properties of farnesyl monophosphate prodrug farnesyltransferase inhibitors  (FTIs) on human NF1 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) cells are  potentiated by co-treatment with lovastatin. Unfortunately, such prodrug FTIs  have poor aqueous solubility. In this study, we synthesized a series of prodrug  FTI polyamidoamine generation 4 (PAMAM G4) dendrimers that compete with farnesyl  pyrophosphate for farnesyltransferase (Ftase) and assessed their effects on  human NF1 MPNST S462TY cells. The prodrug 3-tert-butylfarnesyl monophosphate  FTI-dendrimer (i.e., IG 2) exhibited improved aqueous solubility. Concentrations  of IG 2 and lovastatin (as low as 0.1 μM) having little to no effect when used  singularly synergistically suppressed cell proliferation, colony formation, and  induced N-RAS, RAP1A, and RAB5A deprenylation when used in combination.  Combinational treatment had no additive or synergistic effects on the  proliferation/viability of immortalized normal rat Schwann cells, primary rat  hepatocytes, or normal human mammary epithelial MCF10A cells. Combinational, but  not singular, in vivo treatment markedly suppressed the growth of S462TY  xenografts established in the sciatic nerves of immune-deficient mice. Hence,  prodrug farnesyl monophosphate FTIs can be rendered water-soluble by conjugation  to PAMAM G4 dendrimers and exhibit potent anti-tumor activity when combined with  clinically achievable statin concentrations.

Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, National Taiwan University Hospital, No. 7,  Chung-Shan South Road, Taipei 10012, Taiwan. (2)Department of Medical Genetics, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei  10012, Taiwan.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) stands as a prevalent neurocutaneous disorder.  Approximately a quarter of NF1 patients experience the development of plexiform  neurofibromas, potentially progressing into malignant peripheral nerve sheath  tumors (MPNST). FT895, an HDAC11 inhibitor, exhibits potent anti-tumor effects  on MPNST cells and enhances the cytotoxicity of cordycepin against MPNST. The  study aims to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying FT895's efficacy  against MPNST cells. Initially, our study unveiled that FT895 disrupts  mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Post-FT895 treatment, reactive oxygen  species (ROS) in MPNST notably increased, while mitochondrial DNA copy numbers  decreased significantly. Seahorse analysis indicated a considerable decrease in  basal, maximal, and ATP-production-coupled respiration following FT895  treatment. Immunostaining highlighted FT895's role in promoting mitochondrial  aggregation without triggering mitophagy, possibly due to reduced levels of  XBP1, Parkin, and PINK1 proteins. Moreover, the study using CHIP-qPCR analysis  revealed a significant reduction in the copy numbers of promoters of the  MPV17L2, POLG, TFAM, PINK1, and Parkin genes. The RNA-seq analysis underscored  the prominent role of the HIF-1α signaling pathway post-FT895 treatment,  aligning with the observed impairment in mitochondrial respiration.

Electronic address: Matt.Steensma@vai.org.  OBJECTIVE: NF1 is a tumor suppressor gene and its protein product,  neurofibromin, is a negative regulator of the RAS pathway. NF1 is one of the top  driver mutations in sporadic breast cancer such that 27 % of breast cancers  exhibit damaging NF1 alterations. NF1 loss-of-function is a frequent event in  the genomic evolution of estrogen receptor (ER)+ breast cancer metastasis and  endocrine resistance. Individuals with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF) - a  disorder caused by germline NF1 mutations - have an increased risk of dying from  breast cancer [1-4]. NF-related breast cancers are associated with decreased  overall survival compared to sporadic breast cancer. Despite numerous studies  interrogating the role of RAS mutations in tumor metabolism, no study has  comprehensively profiled the NF1-deficient breast cancer metabolome to define  patterns of energetic and metabolic reprogramming. The goals of this  investigation were (1) to define the role of NF1 deficiency in estrogen  receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer metabolic reprogramming and (2) to  identify potential targeted pathway and metabolic inhibitor combination  therapies for NF1-deficient ER + breast cancer. METHODS: We employed two ER+ NF1-deficient breast cancer models: (1) an  NF1-deficient MCF7 breast cancer cell line to model sporadic breast cancer, and  (2) three distinct, Nf1-deficient rat models to model NF-related breast cancer  [1]. IncuCyte proliferation analysis was used to measure the effect of NF1  deficiency on cell proliferation and drug response. Protein quantity was  assessed by Western Blot analysis. We then used RNAseq to investigate the  transcriptional effect of NF1 deficiency on global and metabolism-related  transcription. We measured cellular energetics using Agilent Seahorse XF-96  Glyco Stress Test and Mito Stress Test assays. We performed stable isotope  labeling and measured [U-13C]-glucose and [U-13C]-glutamine metabolite  incorporation and measured total metabolite pools using mass spectrometry.  Lastly, we used a Bliss synergy model to investigate NF1-driven changes in  targeted and metabolic inhibitor synergy. RESULTS: Our results revealed that NF1 deficiency enhanced cell proliferation,  altered neurofibromin expression, and increased RAS and PI3K/AKT pathway  signaling while constraining oxidative ATP production and restricting energetic  flexibility. Neurofibromin deficiency also increased glutamine influx into TCA  intermediates and dramatically increased lipid pools, especially triglycerides  (TG). Lastly, NF1 deficiency alters the synergy between metabolic inhibitors and  traditional targeted inhibitors. This includes increased synergy with inhibitors  targeting glycolysis, glutamine metabolism, mitochondrial fatty acid transport,  and TG synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: NF1 deficiency drives metabolic reprogramming in ER+ breast cancer.  This reprogramming is characterized by oxidative ATP constraints, glutamine TCA  influx, and lipid pool expansion, and these metabolic changes introduce novel  metabolic-to-targeted inhibitor synergies.

Optic pathway gliomas (OPGs) arising in children with neurofibromatosis type 1  (NF1) can cause retinal ganglion cell (RGC) dysfunction and vision loss, which  occurs more frequently in girls. While our previous studies demonstrated that  estrogen was partly responsible for this sexually dimorphic visual impairment,  herein we elucidate the underlying mechanism. In contrast to their male  counterparts, female Nf1OPG mice have increased expression of glial  interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which is neurotoxic to RGCs in vitro. Importantly, both  IL-1β neutralization and leuprolide-mediated estrogen suppression decrease IL-1β  expression and ameliorate RGC dysfunction, providing preclinical  proof-of-concept evidence supporting novel neuroprotective strategies for  NF1-OPG-induced vision loss.  © 2024 The Authors.

Pain of unknown etiology is frequent in individuals with the tumor  predisposition syndrome neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), even when tumors are absent.  Nerve Schwann cells (SCs) were recently shown to play roles in nociceptive  processing, and we find that chemogenetic activation of SCs is sufficient to  induce afferent and behavioral mechanical hypersensitivity in wild-type mice. In  mouse models, animals showed afferent and behavioral hypersensitivity when SCs,  but not neurons, lacked Nf1. Importantly, hypersensitivity corresponded with  SC-specific upregulation of mRNA encoding glial cell line-derived neurotrophic  factor (GDNF), independently of the presence of tumors. Neuropathic pain-like  behaviors in the NF1 mice were inhibited by either chemogenetic silencing of SC  calcium or by systemic delivery of GDNF-targeting antibodies. Together, these  findings suggest that alterations in SCs directly modulate mechanical pain and  suggest cell-specific treatment strategies to ameliorate pain in individuals  with NF1.

Tissue injury and tumorigenesis share many cellular and molecular features,  including immune cell (T cells, monocytes) infiltration and inflammatory factor  (cytokines, chemokines) elaboration. Their common pathobiology raises the  intriguing possibility that brain injury could create a tissue microenvironment  permissive for tumor formation. Leveraging several murine models of the  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) cancer predisposition syndrome and two  experimental methods of brain injury, we demonstrate that both optic nerve crush  and diffuse traumatic brain injury induce optic glioma (OPG) formation in mice  harboring Nf1-deficient preneoplastic progenitors. We further elucidate the  underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms, whereby glutamate released from  damaged neurons stimulates IL-1β release by oligodendrocytes to induce microglia  expression of Ccl5, a growth factor critical for Nf1-OPG formation. Interruption  of this cellular circuit using glutamate receptor, IL-1β or Ccl5 inhibitors  abrogates injury-induced glioma progression, thus establishing a causative  relationship between injury and tumorigenesis.  © 2024.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 2-related schwannomatosis is a genetic  disease characterized by the development of bilateral vestibular schwannomas,  ependymomas, meningiomas, and cataracts. Mild to profound hearing loss and  tinnitus are common symptoms reported by individuals with neurofibromatosis type  2. While tinnitus is known to have a significant and negative impact on the  quality of life of individuals from the general population, the impact on  individuals with neurofibromatosis type 2 is unknown. Consensus regarding the  selection of suitable patient-reported outcome measures for assessment could  advance further research into tinnitus in neurofibromatosis type 2 patients. The  purpose of this work is to achieve a consensus recommendation by the Response  Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis International Collaboration  for patient-reported outcome measures used to evaluate quality of life in the  domain of tinnitus for neurofibromatosis type 2 clinical trials. METHODS: The Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis  Patient-Reported Outcomes Communication Subgroup systematically evaluated  patient-reported outcome measures of quality of life in the domain of tinnitus  for individuals with neurofibromatosis type 2 using previously published  Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis rating procedures.  Of the 19 identified patient-reported outcome measures, 3 measures were excluded  because they were not validated as an outcome measure or could not have been  used as a single outcome measure for a clinical trial. Sixteen published  patient-reported outcome measures for the domain of tinnitus were scored and  compared on their participant characteristics, item content, psychometric  properties, and feasibility for use in clinical trials. RESULTS: The Tinnitus Functional Index was identified as the most highly rated  measure for the assessment of tinnitus in populations with neurofibromatosis  type 2, due to strengths in the areas of item content, psychometric properties,  feasibility, and available scores. DISCUSSION: Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis  currently recommends the Tinnitus Functional Index for the assessment of  tinnitus in neurofibromatosis type 2 clinical trials.

Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2)-related schwannomatosis is a genetic disorder  that causes development of multiple types of nervous system tumors. The primary  and diagnostic tumor type is bilateral vestibular schwannoma. There is no cure  or drug therapy for NF2. Recommended treatments include surgical resection and  radiation, both of which can leave patients with severe neurological deficits or  increase the risk of future malignant tumors. Results of our previous pilot  high-throughput drug screen identified phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)  inhibitors as strong candidates based on loss of viability of mouse  merlin-deficient Schwann cells (MD-SCs). Here we used novel human schwannoma  model cells to conduct combination drug screens. We identified a class I PI3K  inhibitor, pictilisib and p21 activated kinase (PAK) inhibitor, PF-3758309 as  the top combination due to high synergy in cell viability assays. Both single  and combination therapies significantly reduced growth of mouse MD-SCs in an  orthotopic allograft mouse model. The inhibitor combination promoted cell cycle  arrest and apoptosis in mouse merlin-deficient Schwann (MD-SCs) cells and cell  cycle arrest in human MD-SCs. This study identifies the PI3K and PAK pathways as  potential targets for combination drug treatment of NF2-related schwannomatosis.  © 2024. The Author(s).

The  clinical presentation of NF1 includes diverse neurological issues in pediatric  and adult patients, ranging from learning disabilities, motor skill issues, and  attention deficit disorder, to increased risk of depression and dementia.  Preclinical research suggests that abnormal neuronal signaling mediates spatial  learning and attention issues in NF1; however, drugs that improve phenotypes in  models show inconclusive results in clinical trials, highlighting the need for a  better understanding of NF1 pathophysiology and broader therapeutic options.  Most NF1 patients show abnormalities in their brain white matter (WM) and  myelin, and links with NF1 neuropathophysiology have been suggested; however, no  current data can clearly support or refute this idea. We reported that  myelin-targeted Nf1 mutation impacts oligodendrocyte signaling, myelin  ultrastructure, WM connectivity, and sensory-motor behaviors in mice; however,  any impact on learning and memory remains unknown. Here, we adapted a voluntary  running test-the complex wheel (CW; a wheel with unevenly spaced rungs)-to  delineate fine motor skill learning curves following induction of an Nf1  mutation in pre-existing myelinating cells (pNf1 mice). We found that pNf1  mutant females experience delayed or impaired learning in the CW, while proper  learning in pNf1 males is predominantly disrupted; these phenotypes add  complexity to the gender-dependent learning differences in the mouse strain  used. No broad differences in memory of acquired CW skills were detected in any  gender, but gene-dose effects were observed at the studied time points. Finally,  nitric oxide signaling regulation differentially impacted learning in wild type  (WT)/pNf1, male/female mice. Our results provide evidence for fine motor skill  learning issues upon induction of an Nf1 mutation in mature myelinating cells.  Together with previous connectivity, cellular, and molecular analyses, these  results diversify the potential treatments for neurological issues in NF1.

Patients affected by neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) frequently show muscle  weakness with unknown etiology. Here we show that, in mice, Neurofibromin 1  (Nf1) is not required in muscle fibers, but specifically in early postnatal  myogenic progenitors (MPs), where Nf1 loss led to cell cycle exit and  differentiation blockade, depleting the MP pool resulting in reduced myonuclear  accretion as well as reduced muscle stem cell numbers. This was caused by  precocious induction of stem cell quiescence coupled to metabolic reprogramming  of MPs impinging on glycolytic shutdown, which was conserved in muscle fibers.  We show that a Mek/Erk/NOS pathway hypersensitizes Nf1-deficient MPs to Notch  signaling, consequently, early postnatal Notch pathway inhibition ameliorated  premature quiescence, metabolic reprogramming and muscle growth. This reveals an  unexpected role of Ras/Mek/Erk signaling supporting postnatal MP quiescence in  concert with Notch signaling, which is controlled by Nf1 safeguarding  coordinated muscle growth and muscle stem cell pool establishment. Furthermore,  our data suggest transmission of metabolic reprogramming across cellular  differentiation, affecting fiber metabolism and function in NF1.  © 2024. The Author(s).

PURPOSE: NF2-related schwannomatosis (NF2) is characterized by bilateral  vestibular schwannomas (VS) often causing hearing and neurologic deficits, with  currently no FDA-approved drug treatment. Pre-clinical studies highlighted the  potential of mTORC1 inhibition in delaying schwannoma progression. We conducted  a prospective open-label, phase II study of everolimus for progressive VS in NF2  patients and investigated imaging as a potential biomarker predicting effects on  growth trajectory. METHODS: The trial enrolled 12 NF2 patients with progressive VS. Participants  received oral everolimus daily for 52 weeks. Brain imaging was obtained  quarterly. As primary endpoint, radiographic response (RR) was defined as ≥ 20%  decrease in target VS volume. Secondary endpoints included other tumors RR,  hearing outcomes, drug safety and quality of life (QOL). RESULTS: Eight participants completed the trial and four discontinued the drug  early due to significant volumetric VS progression. After 52 weeks of treatment,  the median annual VS growth rate decreased from 77.2% at baseline to 29.4%.  There was no VS RR and 3 of 8 (37.5%) participants had stable disease. Decreased  or unchanged VS volume after 3 months of treatment was predictive of  stabilization at 12 months. Seven of eight participants had stable hearing  during treatment except one with a decline in word recognition score. Ten of  twelve participants reported only minimal changes to their QOL scores. CONCLUSIONS: Volumetric imaging at 3 months can serve as an early biomarker to  predict long-term sensitivity to everolimus treatment. Everolimus may represent  a safe treatment option to decrease the growth of NF2-related VS in patients who  have stable hearing and neurological condition.

BACKGROUND: Our goal was to develop a 3D tumor slice model, replicating the  individual tumor microenvironment and for individual pharmaceutical testing in  vestibular schwannomas with and without relation to NF2. METHODS: Tissue samples from 16 VS patients (14 sporadic, 2 NF2-related) were  prospectively analyzed. Slices of 350 µm thickness were cultured in vitro, and  the 3D tumor slice model underwent thorough evaluation for culturing time,  microenvironment characteristics, morphology, apoptosis, and proliferation  rates. Common drugs - Lapatinib (10 µM), Nilotinib (20 µM), and Bevacizumab  (10 µg/ml) - known for their responses in VS were used for treatment. Treatment  responses were assessed using CC3 as an apoptosis marker and Ki67 as a  proliferation marker. Standard 2D cell culture models of the same tumors served  as controls. RESULTS: The 3D tumor slice model accurately mimicked VS ex vivo, maintaining  stability for three months. Cell count within the model was approximately  tenfold higher than in standard cell culture, and the tumor microenvironment  remained stable for 46 days. Pharmacological testing was feasible for up to  three weeks, revealing interindividual differences in treatment response to  Lapatinib and intraindividual variability in response to Lapatinib and  Nilotinib. The observed effects were less pronounced in tumor slices than in  standard cell culture, indicating the model's proximity to in vivo tumor biology  and enhanced realism. Bevacizumab had limited impact in both models. CONCLUSION: This study introduces a 3D tumor slice model for sporadic and  NF2-related VS, demonstrating stability for up to 3 months, replication of the  schwannoma microenvironment, and utility for individualized pharmacological  testing.

Plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) are nerve tumors caused by loss of NF1 and  dysregulation of RAS-MAPK signaling in Schwann cells. Most PNFs shrink in  response to MEK inhibition, but targets with increased and durable effects are  needed. We identified the anaphylatoxin C5a as increased in PNFs and expressed  largely by PNF m acrophages. We defined pharmacokinetic and immunomodulatory  properties of a C5aR1/2 antagonist and tested if peptide antagonists augment the  effects of MEK inhibition. MEK inhibition recruited C5AR1 to the macrophage  surface; short-term inhibition of C5aR elevated macrophage apoptosis and Schwann  cell death, without affecting MEK-induced tumor shrinkage. PNF macrophages  lacking C5aR1 increased the engulfment of dying Schwann cells, allowing their  visualization. Halting combination therapy resulted in altered T-cell  distribution, elevated Iba1+ and CD169+ immunoreactivity, and profoundly altered  cytokine expression, but not sustained trumor shrinkage. Thus, C5aRA inhibition  independently induces macrophage cell death and causes sustained and durable  effects on the PNF microenvironment.  © 2024 Perrino et al.

Cherra SJ 3rd(1), Lamb R(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Neuroscience, University of Kentucky College of Medicine,  Lexington, KY, United States.  The Ras family of small GTPases coordinates tissue development by modulating  cell proliferation, cell-cell adhesion, and cellular morphology. Perturbations  of any of these key steps alter nervous system development and are associated  with neurological disorders. While the underlying causes are not known, genetic  mutations in Ras and Rap GTPase signaling pathways have been identified in  numerous neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum,  neurofibromatosis, intellectual disability, epilepsy, and schizophrenia. Despite  diverse clinical presentations, intersections between these two signaling  pathways may provide a better understanding of how deviations in  neurodevelopment give rise to neurological disorders. In this review, we focus  on presynaptic and postsynaptic functions of Ras and Rap GTPases. We highlight  various roles of these small GTPases during synapse formation and plasticity.  Based on genomic analyses, we discuss how disease-related mutations in Ras and  Rap signaling proteins may underlie human disorders. Finally, we discuss how  recent observations have identified molecular interactions between these  pathways and how these findings may provide insights into the mechanisms that  underlie neurodevelopmental disorders.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are chemotherapy resistant  sarcomas that are a leading cause of death in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).  Although NF1-related MPNSTs derive from neural crest cell origin, they also  exhibit intratumoral heterogeneity. TP53 mutations are associated with  significantly decreased survival in MPNSTs, however the mechanisms underlying  TP53-mediated therapy responses are unclear in the context of NF1-deficiency. We  evaluated the role of two commonly altered genes, MET and TP53, in kinome  reprograming and cellular differentiation in preclinical MPNST mouse models. We  previously showed that MET amplification occurs early in human MPNST progression  and that Trp53 loss abrogated MET-addiction resulting in MET inhibitor  resistance. Here we demonstrate a novel mechanism of therapy resistance whereby  p53 alters MET stability, localization, and downstream signaling leading to  kinome reprogramming and lineage plasticity. Trp53 loss also resulted in a shift  from RAS/ERK to AKT signaling and enhanced sensitivity to MEK and mTOR  inhibition. In response to MET, MEK and mTOR inhibition, we observed broad and  heterogeneous activation of key differentiation genes in Trp53-deficient lines  suggesting Trp53 loss also impacts lineage plasticity in MPNSTs. These results  demonstrate the mechanisms by which p53 loss alters MET dependency and therapy  resistance in MPNSTS through kinome reprogramming and phenotypic flexibility.  © 2024. The Author(s).

(#)Contributed equally  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common genetic disorders  caused by heterozygous germline NF1 mutations. NF1 affects many systems,  including the skeletal system. To date, no curative therapies are available for  skeletal manifestations such as scoliosis and tibial dysplasia, mainly due to  the lack of knowledge about the mechanisms that underlie this process. By using  CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in human-induced pluripotent stem cells  (hiPSCs) to minimize the variability due to genetic background and epigenetic  factors, we generated isogenic heterozygous and homozygous NF1-deficient hiPSC  lines to investigate the consequences of neurofibromin inactivation on  osteoblastic differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that loss of one or both  copies of NF1 does not alter the potential of isogenic hiPSCs to differentiate  into mesenchymal stem cells (hiPSC-MSCs). However, NF1 (+/-) and NF1 (-/-)  hiPSC-MSCs show a defect in osteogenic differentiation and mineralization. In  addition, we show that a mono-allelic deletion in NF1 in an isogenic context is  sufficient to impair cell differentiation into osteoblasts. Overall, this study  highlights the relevance of generating isogenic lines, which may help in  genotype-phenotype correlation and provide a human cellular model to understand  the molecular mechanisms underlying NF1 and, thus, discover new therapeutic  strategies.

BACKGROUND: Half of the patients with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) develop one  or more tumours called plexiform neurofibromas, which can have a significant  impact on Quality of Life (QoL). The PlexiQoL questionnaire is a  disease-specific QoL measure for adults with NF1-associated plexiform  neurofibromas. The aim of this study was to adapt and validate a Dutch version  of the PlexiQoL for the Netherlands. METHODS: The PlexiQoL was translated using the dual-panel methodology, followed  by cognitive debriefing interviews to assess face and content validity. The  psychometric properties were evaluated by administering the questionnaire on two  separate occasions to a sample of adults with NF1 and plexiform neurofibromas.  Feasibility was evaluated by the presence of floor/ceiling effects. Reliability  was assessed by evaluating Cronbach's alpha coefficient and test-retest  reliability, using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. Mann-Whitney U  tests were used to check for known group validity. The Nottingham Health Profile  (NHP) questionnaire was used as comparator questionnaire to evaluate convergent  validity. RESULTS: The translation and cognitive debriefing interviews resulted in a Dutch  version of the PlexiQoL that reflected the original concept and underlying  semantic meanings of the UK English version. Forty participants completed the  validation survey. The Dutch PlexiQoL demonstrated excellent internal  consistency (Cronbach's α 0.825) and test-retest reliability (Spearman  correlation coefficient 0.928). The questionnaire detected differences in  PlexiQoL scores between participants based on self-reported general health and  disease severity. Convergent validity was confirmed for relevant NHP  subsections. CONCLUSIONS: The Dutch PlexiQoL demonstrated excellent psychometric properties  and can be reliably used to measure plexiform neurofibroma-related QoL in adults  with NF1 in the Netherlands.  © 2024.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene that  encodes neurofibromin, a RAS GTPase-activating protein. Inactivating NF1  mutations cause hyperactivation of RAS-mediated signaling, resulting in the  development of multiple neoplasms, including malignant peripheral nerve sheath  tumors (MPNSTs). MPNSTs are an aggressive tumor and the main cause of mortality  in patients with NF1. MPNSTs are difficult to resect and refractory to chemo-  and radiotherapy, and no molecular therapies currently exist. Immune checkpoint  blockade (ICB) is an approach to treat inoperable, undruggable cancers like  MPNST, but successful outcomes require an immune cell-rich tumor  microenvironment. While MPNSTs are noninflamed ""cold"" tumors, here, we converted  MPNSTs into T cell-inflamed ""hot"" tumors by activating stimulator of IFN genes  (STING) signaling. Mouse genetic and human xenograft MPNST models treated with a  STING agonist plus ICB exhibited growth delay via increased apoptotic cell  death. This strategy offers a potential treatment regimen for MPNSTs.

Oncolytic adenoviruses (Ads) stand out as a promising strategy for the targeted  infection and lysis of tumor cells, with well-established clinical utility  across various malignancies. This study delves into the therapeutic potential of  oncolytic Ads in the context of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated  malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). Specifically, we evaluate  conditionally replicative adenoviruses (CRAds) driven by the cyclooxygenase 2  (COX2) promoter, as selective agents against MPNSTs, demonstrating their  preferential targeting of MPNST cells compared with non-malignant Schwann cell  control. COX2-driven CRAds, particularly those with modified fiber-knobs exhibit  superior binding affinity toward MPNST cells and demonstrate efficient and  preferential replication and lysis of MPNST cells, with minimal impact on  non-malignant control cells. In vivo experiments involving intratumoral CRAd  injections in immunocompromised mice with human MPNST xenografts significantly  extend survival and reduce tumor growth rate compared with controls. Moreover,  in immunocompetent mouse models with MPNST-like allografts, CRAd injections  induce a robust infiltration of CD8+ T cells into the tumor microenvironment  (TME), indicating the potential to promote a pro-inflammatory response. These  findings underscore oncolytic Ads as promising, selective, and minimally toxic  agents for MPNST therapy, warranting further exploration.

In Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), peripheral nerve sheaths tumors are common,  with cutaneous neurofibromas resulting in significant aesthetic, painful and  functional problems requiring surgical removal. To date, determination of  adequate surgical resection margins-complete tumor removal while attempting to  preserve viable tissue-remains largely subjective. Thus, residual tumor  extension beyond surgical margins or recurrence of the disease may frequently be  observed. Here, we introduce Shifted-Excitation Raman Spectroscopy in  combination with deep neural networks for the future perspective of objective,  real-time diagnosis, and guided surgical ablation. The obtained results are  validated through established histological methods. In this study, we evaluated  the discrimination between cutaneous neurofibroma (n = 9) and adjacent  physiological tissues (n = 25) in 34 surgical pathological specimens ex vivo at  a total of 82 distinct measurement loci. Based on a convolutional neural network  (U-Net), the mean raw Raman spectra (n = 8,200) were processed and refined, and  afterwards the spectral peaks were assigned to their respective molecular  origin. Principal component and linear discriminant analysis was used to  discriminate cutaneous neurofibromas from physiological tissues with a  sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 97.3%, and overall classification accuracy  of 97.6%. The results enable the presented optical, non-invasive technique in  combination with artificial intelligence as a promising candidate to ameliorate  both, diagnosis and treatment of patients affected by cutaneous neurofibroma and  NF1.

BACKGROUND: With the recognition that noncancerous cells function as critical  regulators of brain tumor growth, we recently demonstrated that neurons drive  low-grade glioma initiation and progression. Using mouse models of  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated optic pathway glioma (OPG), we showed  that Nf1 mutation induces neuronal hyperexcitability and midkine expression,  which activates an immune axis to support tumor growth, such that high-dose  lamotrigine treatment reduces Nf1-OPG proliferation. Herein, we execute a series  of complementary experiments to address several key knowledge gaps relevant to  future clinical translation. METHODS: We leverage a collection of Nf1-mutant mice that spontaneously develop  OPGs to alter both germline and retinal neuron-specific midkine expression.  Nf1-mutant mice harboring several different NF1 patient-derived germline  mutations were employed to evaluate neuronal excitability and midkine  expression. Two distinct Nf1-OPG preclinical mouse models were used to assess  lamotrigine effects on tumor progression and growth in vivo. RESULTS: We establish that neuronal midkine is both necessary and sufficient for  Nf1-OPG growth, demonstrating an obligate relationship between germline Nf1  mutation, neuronal excitability, midkine production, and Nf1-OPG proliferation.  We show anti-epileptic drug (lamotrigine) specificity in suppressing neuronal  midkine production. Relevant to clinical translation, lamotrigine prevents  Nf1-OPG progression and suppresses the growth of existing tumors for months  following drug cessation. Importantly, lamotrigine abrogates tumor growth in two  Nf1-OPG strains using pediatric epilepsy clinical dosing. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings establish midkine and neuronal  hyperexcitability as targetable drivers of Nf1-OPG growth and support the use of  lamotrigine as a potential chemoprevention or chemotherapy agent for children  with NF1-OPG.  © The Author(s) 2024.

This phase 2a trial investigated the efficacy of NFX-179 Topical Gel, a  metabolically labile MEK inhibitor, in the treatment of cutaneous neurofibromas  (cNFs) in neurofibromatosis type 1. Forty-eight participants were randomized to  four treatment arms: NFX-179 Topical Gel 0.05%, 0.15%, and 0.5% or vehicle  applied once daily to five target cNFs for 28 days. Treatment with NFX-179  Topical Gel resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in p-ERK levels in cNFs at  day 28, with a 47% decrease in the 0.5% NFX-179 group compared to the vehicle (P  = 0.0001). No local or systemic toxicities were observed during the treatment  period, and systemic concentrations of NFX-179 remained below 1 ng/ml. In  addition, 20% of cNFs treated with 0.5% NFX-179 Topical Gel showed a ≥50%  reduction in volume compared to 6% in the vehicle group by ruler measurement  with calculated volume (P = 0.021). Thus, NFX-179 Topical Gel demonstrated  significant inhibition of MEK in cNF with excellent safety and potential  therapeutic benefit.

Individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1, an autosomal dominant neurogenetic  and tumor predisposition syndrome, are susceptible to developing low-grade  glioma and less commonly high-grade glioma. These gliomas exhibit loss of the  neurofibromin gene [neurofibromin type 1 (NF1)], and 10% to 15% of sporadic  high-grade gliomas have somatic NF1 alterations. Loss of NF1 leads to  hyperactive RAS signaling, creating opportunity given the established efficacy  of MEK inhibitors in plexiform neurofibromas and some individuals with low-grade  glioma. We observed that NF1-deficient glioblastoma neurospheres were sensitive  to the combination of an MEK inhibitor (mirdametinib) with irradiation, as  evidenced by synergistic inhibition of cell growth, colony formation, and  increased cell death. In contrast, NF1-intact neurospheres were not sensitive to  the combination, despite complete ERK pathway inhibition. No neurosphere lines  exhibited enhanced sensitivity to temozolomide combined with mirdametinib.  Mirdametinib decreased transcription of homologous recombination genes and RAD51  foci, associated with DNA damage repair, in sensitive models. Heterotopic  xenograft models displayed synergistic growth inhibition to mirdametinib  combined with irradiation in NF1-deficient glioma xenografts but not in those  with intact NF1.

Human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) is an oncogenic virus whose  infection can cause diverse diseases, most notably adult T-cell  leukemia/lymphoma (ATL or ATLL), an aggressive and fatal malignancy of CD4 T  cells. The oncogenic ability of HTLV-I is mostly attributed to the viral  transcriptional transactivator Tax. Tax alone is sufficient to induce specific  tumors in mice depending on the promotor used to drive Tax expression, thereby  being used to understand HTLV-I tumorigenesis and model the tumor types  developed in Tax transgenic mice. Tax exerts its oncogenic role predominantly by  activating the cellular transcription factor NF-κB. Here, we report that genetic  deletion of NF-κB1, the prototypic member of the NF-κB family, promotes adrenal  medullary tumors but suppresses neurofibromas in mice with transgenic Tax driven  by the HTLV-I Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) promoter. The adrenal tumors are  derived from macrophages. Neoplastic macrophages also infiltrate the spleen and  lymph nodes, causing splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy in mice. Nevertheless, the  findings could be human relevant, because macrophages are important target cells  of HTLV-I infection and serve as a virus reservoir in vivo. Moreover, the  spleen, lymph nodes and adrenal glands are the most common sites of tumor cell  infiltration in HTLV-I-infected patients. These data provide new mechanistic  insights into the complex interaction between Tax and NF-κB, therefore improving  our understanding of HTLV-I oncogenic pathogenesis. They also expand our  knowledge and establish a new animal model of macrophage neoplasms and adrenal  tumors.  Copyright: © 2024 Song, Qu.

In the spectrum of colorectal tumors, microsatellite-stable (MSS) tumors with  DNA polymerase ε (POLE) mutations exhibit a hypermutated profile, holding the  potential to respond to immunotherapy similarly to their microsatellite-instable  (MSI) counterparts. Yet, due to their rarity and the associated testing costs,  systematic screening for these mutations is not commonly pursued. Notably, the  histopathological phenotype resulting from POLE mutations is theorized to  resemble that of MSI. This resemblance not only could facilitate their detection  by a transformer-based Deep Learning (DL) system trained on MSI pathology  slides, but also indicates the possibility for MSS patients with POLE mutations  to access enhanced treatment options, which might otherwise be overlooked. To  harness this potential, we trained a Deep Learning classifier on a large dataset  with the ground truth for microsatellite status and subsequently validated its  capabilities for MSI and POLE detection across three external cohorts. Our model  accurately identified MSI status in both the internal and external resection  cohorts using pathology images alone. Notably, with a classification threshold  of 0.5, over 75% of POLE driver mutant patients in the external resection  cohorts were flagged as ""positive"" by a DL system trained on MSI status. In a  clinical setting, deploying this DL model as a preliminary screening tool could  facilitate the efficient identification of clinically relevant MSI and POLE  mutations in colorectal tumors, in one go.  © 2024.

BACKGROUND: Almost all patients with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) develop  cutaneous neurofibroma (cNF), benign dermal tumours that have a large impact on  the patient's Quality of Life (QoL). The French cNF-Skindex is the first  questionnaire to specifically assess cNF-related QoL in patients with NF1. We  aimed to adapt and validate a Dutch version of the cNF-Skindex. METHODS: The questionnaire was translated using forward and backwards  translation, and subsequently administered to a sample of 59 patients on two  separate occasions. Feasibility was evaluated by the presence of floor/ceiling  effects. Reliability was assessed by evaluating internal consistency and  test-retest reliability, by calculating Cronbach's alpha and Spearman's rank  correlation coefficients. The EQ-5D-5L and SF-36 were used to evaluate  convergent validity, using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. An  exploratory factor analysis was performed to study the data's internal  structure. Multivariable linear regression was used to model the relationship  between patient characteristics and the cNF-Skindex. RESULTS: The Dutch cNF-Skindex demonstrated excellent feasibility and  reliability (Cronbach's alpha 0.96, test-retest correlation coefficient 0.88).  Convergent validity was confirmed for the EQ-5D-5L and relevant SF-36 scales.  All items and subdomains from the original questionnaire were confirmed  following exploratory factor analysis. The patient characteristics included in  the multivariable linear regression were not significantly associated with the  cNF-Skindex score. CONCLUSIONS: The Dutch cNF-Skindex displayed excellent psychometric properties,  enabling use in the Netherlands.  © 2024. The Author(s).

(#)Contributed equally  Neurogenetic disorders, such as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), can cause  cognitive and motor impairments, traditionally attributed to intrinsic neuronal  defects such as disruption of synaptic function. Activity-regulated  oligodendroglial plasticity also contributes to cognitive and motor functions by  tuning neural circuit dynamics. However, the relevance of oligodendroglial  plasticity to neurological dysfunction in NF1 is unclear. Here we explore the  contribution of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) to pathological features  of the NF1 syndrome in mice. Both male and female littermates (4-24 weeks of  age) were used equally in this study. We demonstrate that mice with global or  OPC-specific Nf1 heterozygosity exhibit defects in activity-dependent  oligodendrogenesis and harbor focal OPC hyperdensities with disrupted  homeostatic OPC territorial boundaries. These OPC hyperdensities develop in a  cell-intrinsic Nf1 mutation-specific manner due to differential PI3K/AKT  activation. OPC-specific Nf1 loss impairs oligodendroglial differentiation and  abrogates the normal oligodendroglial response to neuronal activity, leading to  impaired motor learning performance. Collectively, these findings show that Nf1  mutation delays oligodendroglial development and disrupts activity-dependent OPC  function essential for normal motor learning in mice.  © 2024.

INTRODUCTION: Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression is an immune evasion  mechanism that has been demonstrated in many tumors and is commonly associated  with a poor prognosis. Over the years, anti-PD-L1 agents have gained attention  as novel anticancer therapeutics that induce durable tumor regression in  numerous malignancies. They may be a new treatment choice for neurofibromatosis  type 2 (NF2) patients. AIMS: The aims of this study were to detect the expression of PD-L1 in  NF2-associated meningiomas, explore the effect of PD-L1 downregulation on tumor  cell characteristics and T-cell functions, and investigate the possible pathways  that regulate PD-L1 expression to further dissect the possible mechanism of  immune suppression in NF2 tumors and to provide new treatment options for NF2  patients. RESULTS: PD-L1 is heterogeneously expressed in NF2-associated meningiomas. After  PD-L1 knockdown in NF2-associated meningioma cells, tumor cell proliferation was  significantly inhibited, and the apoptosis rate was elevated. When T cells were  cocultured with siPD-L1-transfected NF2-associated meningioma cells, the  expression of CD69 on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was partly reversed, and the  capacity of CD8+ T cells to kill siPD-L1-transfected tumor cells was partly  restored. Results also showed that the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway regulates PD-L1  expression, and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin rapidly and persistently suppresses  PD-L1 expression. In vivo experimental results suggested that anti-PD-L1  antibody may have a synergetic effect with the mTOR inhibitor in reducing tumor  cell proliferation and that reduced PD-L1 expression could contribute to  antitumor efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting PD-L1 could be helpful for restoring the function of  tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and inducing apoptosis to inhibit tumor  proliferation in NF2-associated meningiomas. Dissecting the mechanisms of the  PD-L1-driven tumorigenesis of NF2-associated meningioma will help to improve our  understanding of the mechanisms underlying tumor progression and could  facilitate further refinement of current therapies to improve the treatment of  NF2 patients.  © 2024 The Author(s).

(#)Contributed equally  NF1 microdeletion syndrome, accounting for 5-11% of NF1 patients, is caused by a  deletion in the NF1 region and it is generally characterized by a severe  phenotype. Although 70% of NF1 microdeletion patients presents the same 1.4 Mb  type-I deletion, some patients may show additional clinical features. Therefore,  the contribution of several pathogenic mechanisms, besides haploinsufficiency of  some genes within the deletion interval, is expected and needs to be defined. We  investigated an altered expression of deletion flanking genes by qPCR in  patients with type-1 NF1 deletion, compared to healthy donors, possibly  contributing to the clinical traits of NF1 microdeletion syndrome. In addition,  the 1.4-Mb deletion leads to changes in the 3D chromatin structure in the  17q11.2 region. Specifically, this deletion alters DNA-DNA interactions in the  regions flanking the breakpoints, as demonstrated by our 4C-seq analysis. This  alteration likely causes position effect on the expression of deletion flanking  genes.Interestingly, 4C-seq analysis revealed that in microdeletion patients, an  interaction was established between the RHOT1 promoter and the SLC6A4 gene,  which showed increased expression. We performed NGS on putative modifier genes,  and identified two ""likely pathogenic"" rare variants in RAS pathway, possibly  contributing to incidental phenotypic features.This study provides new insights  into understanding the pathogenesis of NF1 microdeletion syndrome and suggests a  novel pathomechanism that contributes to the expression phenotype in addition to  haploinsufficiency of genes located within the deletion.This is a pivotal  approach that can be applied to unravel microdeletion syndromes, improving  precision medicine, prognosis and patients' follow-up.  © 2024.

Neurofibromatosis Type II (NFII) is a genetic condition caused by loss of the  NF2 gene, resulting in activation of the YAP/TAZ pathway and recurrent Schwann  cell tumors, as well as meningiomas and ependymomas. Unfortunately, few  pharmacological options are available for NFII. Here, we undertake a genome-wide  CRISPR/Cas9 screen to search for synthetic-lethal genes that, when inhibited,  cause death of NF2 mutant Schwann cells but not NF2 wildtype cells. We identify  ACSL3 and G6PD as two synthetic-lethal partners for NF2, both involved in lipid  biogenesis and cellular redox. We find that NF2 mutant Schwann cells are more  oxidized than control cells, in part due to reduced expression of genes involved  in NADPH generation such as ME1. Since G6PD and ME1 redundantly generate  cytosolic NADPH, lack of either one is compatible with cell viability, but not  down-regulation of both. Since genetic deficiency for G6PD is tolerated in the  human population, G6PD could be a good pharmacological target for NFII.  © 2024. The Author(s).

INTRODUCTION: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive  sarcomas with unacceptably low cure rates occurring often in patients with  neurofibromatosis 1 defects. To investigate oncolytic Herpes Simplex Virus  (oHSV) as an immunotherapeutic approach, we compared viral replication,  functional activity, and immune response between unarmed and interleukin 12  (IL-12)-armed oncolytic viruses in virus-permissive (B109) and -resistant  (67C-4) murine MPNSTs. METHODS: This study compared two attenuated IL-12-oHSVs with γ134.5 gene  deletions (Δγ134.5) and the same transgene expression cassette. The primary  difference in the IL-12-oHSVs was in their ability to counter the translational  arrest response in infected cells. Unlike M002 (Δγ134.5, mIL-12), C002 (Δγ134.5,  mIL-12, IRS1) expresses an HCMV IRS1 gene and evades dsRNA activated  translational arrest in infected cells. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Our results show that oHSV replication and gene  expression results in vitro were not predictive of oHSV direct oncolytic  activity in vivo. Tumors that supported viral replication in cell culture  studies resisted viral replication by both oHSVs and restricted M002 transgene  expression in vivo. Furthermore, two IL-12-oHSVs with equivalent transcriptional  activity differed in IL-12 protein production in vivo, and the differences in  IL-12 protein levels were reflected in immune infiltrate activity changes as  well as tumor growth suppression differences between the IL-12-oHSVs.  C002-treated tumors exhibited sustained IL-12 production with improved dendritic  cells, monocyte-macrophage activity (MHCII, CD80/CD86 upregulation) and a  polyfunctional Th1-cell response in the tumor infiltrates. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that transgene protein production differences  between oHSVs in vivo, in addition to replication differences, can impact  OV-therapeutic activity.

NF1 patients  frequently develop a benign tumor in peripheral nerve plexuses called plexiform  neurofibroma. In the past two decades, tissue-specific Nf1 knockout mouse models  were developed using commercially available tissue-specific Cre recombinase and  the Nf1 flox mice to mimic neurofibroma development. However, these models  develop para-spinal neurofibroma, recapitulating a rare type of neurofibroma  found in NF1 patients. The NPcis mouse model developed a malignant version of  neurofibroma called malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) within 3 to  6 months but intriguingly without apparent benign precursor lesion. Here, we  revisited the NPcis model and discovered that about 20% display clinical signs  similar to Nf1 tissue-specific knockout mice models. However, a systematic  histological analysis could not explain the clinical signs we observed although  we noticed lesions reminiscent of a neurofibroma in a peripheral nerve, a  cutaneous neurofibroma, and para-spinal neurofibroma on rare occasions in NPcis  mice. We also observed that 10% of the mice developed a malignant peripheral  nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) spontaneously, coinciding with their earring tag  identification. Strikingly, half of the sciatic nerves from NPcis mice developed  plexiform neurofibroma within 1-6 months when intentionally injured. Thus, we  provided a procedure to turn the widely used NPcis sarcoma model into a model  recapitulating plexiform neurofibroma.  Copyright: © 2024 Plante et al.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a complex genetic disorder that affects a  range of tissues including muscle and bone. Recent preclinical and clinical  studies have shown that Nf1 deficiency in muscle causes metabolic changes  resulting in intramyocellular lipid accumulation and muscle weakness. These can  be subsequently rescued by dietary interventions aimed at modulating lipid  availability and metabolism. It was speculated that the modified diet may rescue  defects in cortical bone as NF1 deficiency has been reported to affect genes  involved with lipid metabolism. Bone specimens were analyzed from wild type  control mice as well as Nf1Prx1-/- (limb-targeted Nf1 knockout mice) fed  standard chow versus a range of modified chows hypothesized to influence lipid  metabolism. Mice were fed from 4 weeks to 12 weeks of age. MicroCT analysis was  performed on the cortical bone to examine standard parameters (bone volume,  tissue mineral density, cortical thickness) and specific porosity measures  (closed pores corresponding to osteocyte lacunae, and larger open pores).  Nf1Prx1-/- bones were found to have inferior bone properties to wild type bones,  with a 4-fold increase in the porosity attributed to open pores. These measures  were rescued by dietary interventions including a L-carnitine + medium-chain  fatty acid supplemented chow previously shown to improve muscle histology  function. Histological staining visualized these changes in bone porosity. These  data support the concept that lipid metabolism may have a mechanistic impact on  bone porosity and quality in NF1.

Congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia (CPT) is a severe pathology marked by  spontaneous bone fractures that fail to heal, leading to fibrous nonunion. Half  of patients with CPT are affected by the multisystemic genetic disorder  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) caused by mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor  gene, a negative regulator of RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)  signaling pathway. Here, we analyzed patients with CPT and Prss56-Nf1 knockout  mice to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms of CPT-related fibrous nonunion and  explored a pharmacological approach to treat CPT. We identified NF1-deficient  Schwann cells and skeletal stem/progenitor cells (SSPCs) in pathological  periosteum as affected cell types driving fibrosis. Whereas NF1-deficient SSPCs  adopted a fibrotic fate, NF1-deficient Schwann cells produced critical paracrine  factors including transforming growth factor-β and induced fibrotic  differentiation of wild-type SSPCs. To counteract the elevated RAS-MAPK  signaling in both NF1-deficient Schwann cells and SSPCs, we used MAPK kinase  (MEK) and Src homology 2 containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2)  inhibitors. Combined MEK-SHP2 inhibition in vivo prevented fibrous nonunion in  the Prss56-Nf1 knockout mouse model, providing a promising therapeutic strategy  for the treatment of fibrous nonunion in CPT.

Plexiform  neurofibromas (PNFs) are benign tumors commonly formed in patients with NF1.  PNFs have a high incidence of developing into malignant peripheral nerve sheath  tumors (MPNSTs) with a 5-year survival rate of only 30%. Therefore, the accurate  diagnosis and differentiation of MPNSTs from benign PNFs are critical to patient  management. We studied a fluorine-18 labeled tryptophan positron emission  tomography (PET) radiotracer, 1-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tryptophan  (L-[18F]FETrp), to detect NF1-associated tumors in an animal model. An ex vivo  biodistribution study of L-[18F]FETrp showed a similar tracer distribution and  kinetics between the wild-type and triple mutant mice with the highest uptake in  the pancreas. Bone uptake was stable. Brain uptake was low during the 90-min  uptake period. Static PET imaging at 60 min post-injection showed L-[18F]FETrp  had a comparable tumor uptake with [1⁸F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). However,  L-[18F]FETrp showed a significantly higher tumor-to-brain ratio than FDG (n = 4,  p < 0.05). Sixty-minute-long dynamic PET scans using the two radiotracers showed  similar kidney, liver, and lung kinetics. A dysregulated tryptophan metabolism  in NF1 mice was further confirmed using immunohistostaining. L-[18F]FETrp is  warranted to further investigate differentiating malignant NF1 tumors from  benign PNFs. The study may reveal the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway as a  therapeutic target for treating NF1.

Electronic address: marfranc@fiu.edu.  Tumors develop in an oxidative environment characterized by peroxynitrite  production and downstream protein tyrosine (Y) nitration. We showed that  tyrosine nitration supports schwannoma cell proliferation and regulates cell  metabolism in the inheritable tumor disorder NF2-related Schwannomatosis  (NF2-SWN). Here, we identified the chaperone Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) as  the first nitrated protein that acts as a metabolic switch to promote schwannoma  cell proliferation. Doubling the endogenous levels of nitrated Hsp90 in  schwannoma cells or supplementing nitrated Hsp90 into normal Schwann cells  increased their proliferation. Metabolically, nitration on either Y33 or Y56  conferred Hsp90 distinct functions; nitration at Y33 (Hsp90NY33) down-regulated  mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, while nitration at Y56 (Hsp90NY56)  increased glycolysis by activating the purinergic receptor P2X7 in both  schwannoma and normal Schwann cells. Hsp90NY33 and Hsp90NY56 showed differential  subcellular and spatial distribution corresponding with their metabolic and  proliferative functions in schwannoma three-dimensional cell culture models.  Collectively, these results underscore the role of tyrosine nitration as a  post-translational modification regulating critical cellular processes. Nitrated  proteins, particularly nitrated Hsp90, emerge as a novel category of  tumor-directed therapeutic targets.  Copyright © 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

BACKGROUND: Optic pathway glioma (OPG) is a feared complication to  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) since it can cause visual impairment in young  children. The main goal of screening is to detect symptomatic OPGs that require  treatment. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been suggested as a tool for  detection of neuro-retinal damage. AIMS: To investigate whether the ganglion cell layer assessed by OCT is a  reliable measure to identify and detect relapses of symptomatic OPGs in children  with NF1. METHODS: Children (3-6 years) with NF1, with and without known OPG and children  with sporadic OPG (S-OPG) resident in the Stockholm area, were invited and  followed in a prospective study during a three-year period. Brain magnetic  resonance tomography (MRI) had been performed in children with symptoms of OPG.  Outcome measures were VA in logMAR, visual field index (VFI), average  thicknesses of the ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL), and  peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL). RESULTS: There were 25 children with MRI-verified OPG and 52 with NF1 without  symptomatic OPG. Eyes from NF1 patients without symptoms of OPG showed  significantly better results in all four analyzed parameters compared to eyes  with NF1-associated OPG. Mean GC-IPL measurements seemed stable and reliable,  significantly correlated to pRNFL (correlation coefficient (r) = 0.662,  confidence interval (CI) = .507 to .773 p<0.001), VA (r = -0.661, CI = -7.45 to  -.551, p<0.001) and VFI (r = 0.644, CI = .452 to .774, p<0.001). GC-IPL  measurements were easy to obtain and acquired at considerably younger age than  pRNFL (5.6±1.5 vs 6.8±1.3; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The mean GC-IPL thickness could distinguish well between eyes with  OPG and eyes without symptomatic OPG in children with NF1. As thinning of GC-IPL  assessed with OCT could indicate underlying OPG, it should be included in the  screening protocol of children with questionable VA measurements and in  particular in children with NF1.

Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive sarcomas that  can arise both sporadically and in patients with the genetic syndrome  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Prognosis is dismal, as large dimensions, risk  of relapse, and anatomical localization make surgery poorly effective, and no  therapy is known. Hence, the identification of MPNST molecular features that  could be hit in an efficient and selective way is mandatory to envision  treatment options. Here, we find that MPNSTs express high levels of the  glycolytic enzyme Hexokinase 2 (HK2), which is known to shield cancer cells from  noxious stimuli when it localizes at MAMs (mitochondria-associated membranes),  contact sites between mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. A HK2-targeting  peptide that dislodges HK2 from MAMs rapidly induces a massive death of MPNST  cells. After identifying different matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) expressed in  the MPNST microenvironment, we have designed HK2-targeting peptide variants that  harbor cleavage sites for these MMPs, making such peptides activatable in the  proximity of cancer cells. We find that the peptide carrying the MMP2/9 cleavage  site is the most effective, both in inhibiting the in vitro tumorigenicity of  MPNST cells and in hampering their growth in mice. Our data indicate that  detaching HK2 from MAMs could pave the way for a novel anti-MPNST therapeutic  strategy, which could be flexibly adapted to the protease expression features of  the tumor microenvironment.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous disorder  caused by loss-of-function variants in the NF1 gene. As of 20 November 2023,  over 5000 distinct pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants have been reported  in public databases. However, only a few NF1 genotype-phenotype correlations  have been established so far. In this study, we present findings on 40  individuals with NF1, comprising 26 unrelated probands and 14 affected  relatives, who carry one of nine NF1 heterozygous pathogenic splicing variants,  all of which result in the in-frame skipping of exon 24 [19a]  (NM_000267.3:r.3114_3197del, p.Asn1039_Arg1066del). These variants include  c.3114-2A>G, c.3114-1G>A, c.3196A>G, c.3197G>A, c.3197G>T, c.3197+1G>A,  c.3197+1G>T, c.3197+2T>C, and c.3197+3A>T. Among individuals with these  variants, none exhibit externally visible plexiform neurofibromas,  histopathologically confirmed cutaneous or subcutaneous neurofibromas,  symptomatic spinal neurofibromas, or symptomatic optic pathway gliomas. The most  prevalent, and sometimes sole, clinical feature observed in this cohort is  multiple café-au-lait macules, with or without skinfold freckles: 85% and 60.5%  of the individuals display six or more café-au-lait macules and freckles,  respectively. In comparison to established NF1 genotype-phenotype correlations,  these patients demonstrate highly similar clinical presentations to those  associated with the NF1 pathogenic variant c.2970_2972del (p.Met992del), known  for resulting in the mildest clinical features. Despite the generally mild  phenotype, cognitive impairment, developmental delay, and/or learning  difficulties are still observed in 33.3% of these patients, suggesting that  learning challenges remain a prominent aspect of the phenotypic presentation in  these individuals and necessitate specialized care. This newly established  genotype-phenotype correlation will assist clinicians in improving the  management of patients harboring NF1 exon 24 [19a] skipping variants and provide  a new therapeutic target for NF1 treatment.

Neurofibromatosis type 1, a genetic disorder caused by pathogenic germline  variations in NF1, predisposes individuals to the development of tumors,  including cutaneous and plexiform neurofibromas (CNs and PNs), optic gliomas,  astrocytomas, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, high-grade gliomas and malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), which are chemotherapy- and  radiation-resistant sarcomas with poor survival. Loss of NF1 also occurs in  sporadic tumors, such as glioblastoma (GBM), melanoma, breast, ovarian and lung  cancers. We performed a high-throughput screen for compounds that were synthetic  lethal with NF1 loss, which identified several leads, including the small  molecule Y102. Treatment of cells with Y102 perturbed autophagy, mitophagy and  lysosome positioning in NF1-deficient cells. A dual proteomics approach  identified BLOC-one-related complex (BORC), which is required for lysosome  positioning and trafficking, as a potential target of Y102. Knockdown of a BORC  subunit using siRNA recapitulated the phenotypes observed with Y102 treatment.  Our findings demonstrate that BORC might be a promising therapeutic target for  NF1-deficient tumors.  © 2024. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

The aim of our study was to characterize a large cohort  of individuals with NF-1 microdeletion syndrome and expand its natural history.  We conducted a retrospective chart review from 1994 to 2024 of individuals with  NF-1 microdeletion syndrome followed at two large Neurofibromatosis Clinics.  This cohort consists of 57 individuals with NF-1 microdeletion syndrome (28  type-1, 4 type-2, 2 type-3, 9 atypical deletions, and 14 indeterminate). We note  38/56 (67.9%) with describable facial features, 25/57 (43.8%) with plexiform  neurofibromas, and 3/57 (5.2%) with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors  within the observed period. The most reported neurodevelopmental manifestations  from school-age or older individuals included 39/49 (79.6%) with developmental  delays, 35/49 (71.4%) with expressive and/or receptive speech delays, 33/41  (80.5%) with learning difficulties, and 23/42 (54.8%) with  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Full-scale IQ testing data was  available for 22 individuals (range: 50-96). Of the 21 adults in this cohort,  14/21 (66.7%) graduated from high school, and 4/21 (19.0%) had some college  experience. Many individuals received academic support (i.e., special education,  individual education plan). In this cohort, neurocognitive outcomes in adults  varied more than typically reported in the literature.  © 2024 The Author(s).

BACKGROUND: Pediatric low-grade glioma incidence has been rising in the United  States, mirroring the rising rates of pediatric and maternal obesity. Recently,  children of obese mothers were demonstrated to develop brain tumors at higher  rates. Importantly, obesity in the United States is largely driven by diet,  given the prevalence of high-fat and high-sugar (HFHS) food choices. Since  high-fat diet exposure can increase embryonic neuroglial progenitor cell (NPC)  proliferation, the potential cells of origin for a low-grade glioma, we  hypothesized that in utero exposure to an obesogenic diet would modify pediatric  brain penetrance and latency by affecting the tumor cell of origin. METHODS: We employed several murine models of the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)  pediatric brain tumor predisposition syndrome, in which optic pathway gliomas  (Nf1-OPGs) arise from neuroglial progenitor cells in the embryonic third  ventricular zone (TVZ). We exposed dams and offspring to an obesogenic HFHS diet  or control chow and analyzed fetal neurodevelopment at E19.5 and tumor formation  at 6 weeks-3 months. RESULTS: Progeny from HFHS diet-exposed dams demonstrated increased TVZ NPC  proliferation and glial differentiation. Dietary switch cohorts confirmed that  these effects were dependent upon maternal diet, rather than maternal weight.  Obesogenic diet (Ob) similarly accelerated glioma formation in a high-penetrance  Nf1-OPG strain and increased glioma penetrance in 2 low-penetrance Nf1-OPG  strains. In contrast, Ob exposure in the postnatal period alone did not  recapitulate these effects. CONCLUSIONS: These findings establish maternal obesogenic diet as a risk factor  for murine Nf1-OPG formation, acting in part through in utero effects on the  tumor cell of origin.  © The Author(s) 2024.

Photopic negative response (PhNR), an index of retinal ganglion cell (RGC)  function, is impaired in patients with optic pathway gliomas (OPGs). The aim of  this longitudinal study was to evaluate whether PhNR deteriorates over time in  OPG patients. Fourteen pediatric patients affected by OPG (4 males and 10  females, mean age 12.4 ± 5.7 years, 8 with neurofibromatosis type 1 [NF1]) with  ≥12 months of follow-up and ≥2 evaluations, were included in this retrospective  study. All patients had received chemotherapy, with or without OPG surgical  resection, at least 5 years prior to the study. At baseline, all patients  underwent a complete ophthalmological examination. Follow-up included clinical  examination and PhNR measurement as well as brain MRI (according to pediatric  oncologist indications) every 6 or 12 months. Mean follow-up duration was  16.7 ± 7.5 months (range 12-36 months). Photopic electroretinograms were  elicited by 2.0 cd-s/m2 Ganzfeld white flashes presented on a steady 20 cd/m2  white background. The PhNR amplitude was measured as the difference between  baseline and the maximal negative amplitude (minimum) of the negative wave,  following the photopic b-wave. Compared to baseline, mean PhNR amplitude was  significantly decreased at the end of follow-up (p = 0.008). NF1-related OPGs  exhibited a decline in PhNR amplitude (p = 0.005) and an increase in PhNR  peak-time during the follow-up (p = 0.013), whereas sporadic OPGs showed no  significant changes. Tumor size remained stable in all patients on MRI. PhNR  amplitude decreased over the observation period, suggesting progressive RGC  dysfunction in NF1-related pediatric OPGs, despite stable size on MRI imaging.  PhNR could serve as a non-invasive objective tool for assessing longitudinal  changes in RGC function in the clinical management of childhood OPG.  Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

Plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) occur in about a half of neurofibromatosis type 1  (NF1) patients and have garnered significant research attention due to their  capacity for growth and potential for malignant transformation. NF1 plexiform  neurofibroma (pNF1) is a complex tumor composed of Schwann cell-derived tumor  cells (Nf1-/-) and the tumor microenvironment (TME). Although it has been widely  demonstrated that the TME is involved in the formation of neurofibromas, little  is known about the effects of the TME on the subsequent progression of human  pNF1. Elucidating the molecular interactions between tumor cells and the TME may  provide new therapeutic targets to reduce the progression of pNF1. In the  present study, we focused on the contributions of fibroblasts, the most abundant  cell types in the TME, to the growth of pNF1. To simulate the TME, we used a  three-dimensional (3D) coculture model of immortalized pNF1 tumor cells (Nf1-/-)  and primary fibroblasts (Nf1+/-) derived from pNF1 patients. We performed  live-cell imaging of 3D/4D (3D in real-time) cultures through confocal  microscopy followed by 3D quantitative analyses using advanced imaging software.  The growth of pNF1 spheroids in 3D cocultures with fibroblasts was significantly  greater than that of pNF1 spheroids in 3D monocultures. An increase in the  growth of pNF1 spheroids also occurred when they were cultured with conditioned  media (CM) from fibroblasts. Moreover, fibroblast-derived CM increased the  invasive outgrowth and further local invasion of pNF1 spheroids. Interestingly,  when small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) were depleted from the  fibroblast-derived CM, the stimulation of the growth of pNF1 spheroids was lost.  Our results suggest that fibroblast-derived sEVs are a therapeutic target for  reducing the growth of pNF1.

Neurofibromatosis type 2 is a genetic disorder that results in the formation and  progressive growth of schwannomas, ependymomas, and/or meningiomas. The NF2 gene  encodes the Merlin protein, which links cell cortical elements to the actin  cytoskeleton and regulates a number of key enzymes including Group I  p21-activated kinases (PAKs), the Hippo-pathway kinase LATS, and mTORC. While  PAK1 and PAK2 directly bind Merlin and transmit proliferation and survival  signals when Merlin is mutated or absent, inhibition of Group 1 PAKs alone has  not proven sufficient to completely stop the growth of NF2-deficient meningiomas  or schwannomas in vivo, suggesting the need for a second pathway inhibitor. As  the Hippo pathway is also activated in NF2-deficient cells, several inhibitors  of the Hippo pathway have recently been developed in the form of YAP-TEAD  binding inhibitors. These inhibitors prevent activation of pro-proliferation and  anti-apoptotic Hippo pathway effectors. In this study, we show that PAK  inhibition slows cell proliferation while TEAD inhibition promotes apoptotic  cell death. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of PAK and TEAD inhibitor  combinations in several NF2-deficient Schwannoma cell lines.  Copyright: © 2024 Benton et al.

Plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) are a prevalent and severe phenotype associated  with NF1, characterized by a high teratogenic rate and potential for malignant  transformation. The growth and recurrence of PNFs are attributed to aberrant  proliferation and migration of Nf1-deficient Schwann cells. Protein tyrosine  phosphatase receptor S (PTPRS) is believed to modulate cell migration and  invasion by inhibiting the EMT process in NF1-derived malignant peripheral nerve  sheath tumors. Nevertheless, the specific role of PTPRS in NF1-derived PNFs  remains to be elucidated. The study utilized the GEO database and tissue  microarray to illustrate a decrease in PTPRS expression in PNF tissues, linked  to tumor recurrence. Furthermore, the down- and over-expression of PTPRS in  Nf1-deficient Schwann cell lines resulted in the changes of cell migration and  EMT processes. Additionally, RTK assay and WB showed that PTPRS knockdown can  promote EGFR expression and phosphorylation. The restoration of EMT processes  disrupted by alterations in PTPRS levels in Schwann cells can be achieved  through EGFR knockdown and EGFR inhibitor. Moreover, high EGFR expression has  been significantly correlated with poor prognosis. These findings underscore the  potential role of PTPRS as a tumor suppressor in the recurrence of PNF via the  regulation of EGFR-mediated EMT processes, suggesting potential targets for  future clinical interventions.

The blood-nerve-barrier (BNB) that regulates peripheral nerve homeostasis is  formed by endoneurial capillaries and perineurial cells surrounding the Schwann  cell (SC)-rich endoneurium. Barrier dysfunction is common in human  tumorigenesis, including in some nerve tumors. We identify barrier disruption in  human NF1 deficient neurofibromas, which were characterized by reduced  perineurial cell glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) expression and increased  endoneurial fibrin(ogen) deposition. Conditional Nf1 loss in murine SCs  recapitulated these alterations and revealed decreased tight junctions and  decreased caveolin-1 (Cav1) expression in mutant nerves and in tumors,  implicating reduced Cav1-mediated transcytosis in barrier disruption and  tumorigenesis. Additionally, elevated receptor tyrosine kinase activity and  genetic deletion of Cav1 increased endoneurial fibrin(ogen), and promoted SC  tumor formation. Finally, when SC lacked Nf1, genetic loss or pharmacological  inhibition of P2RY14 rescued Cav1 expression and barrier function. Thus, loss of  Nf1 in SC causes dysfunction of the BNB via P2RY14-mediated G-protein coupled  receptor (GPCR) signaling.  © 2024 The Authors.

Plexiform neurofibromas, one of many NF1 manifestations, are  benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors occurring in up to 50% of NF1 patients. A  substantial fraction of NF1 pathogenetic variants are nonsense mutations, which  result in the synthesis of truncated non-functional NF1 protein (neurofibromin).  To date, no therapeutics have restored neurofibromin expression or addressed the  consequences of this protein's absence in NF1 nonsense mutation patients, but  nonsense suppression is a potential approach to the problem. Ataluren is a small  molecule drug that has been shown to stimulate functional nonsense codon  readthrough in several models of nonsense mutation diseases, as well as in  Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients. To test ataluren's potential applicability  in nonsense mutation NF1 patients, we evaluated its therapeutic effects using  three treatment regimens in a previously established NF1 patient-derived  (c.2041C > T; p.Arg681X) nonsense mutation mouse model. Collectively, our  experiments indicate that: i) ataluren appeared to slow the growth of  neurofibromas and alleviate some paralysis phenotypes, ii) female Nf1-nonsense  mutation mice manifested more severe paralysis and neurofibroma phenotypes than  male mice, iii) ataluren doses with apparent effectiveness were lower in female  mice than in male mice, and iv) age factors also influenced ataluren's  effectiveness.

Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a complex genetic disorder characterized by  the development of benign neurofibromas, which can cause significant morbidity  in affected individuals. While the molecular mechanisms underlying NF1  pathogenesis have been extensively studied, the development of effective  therapeutic strategies remains a challenge. This paper presents the development  and validation of a novel biomaterial testing model to enhance our understanding  of NF1 pathophysiology, disease mechanisms and evaluate potential therapeutic  interventions. Our long-term goal is to develop an invitro model of NF1 to  evaluate drug targets. We have developed an in vitro system to test the cellular  behavior of NF1 patient derived cells on electroconductive aligned nanofibrous  biomaterials with electrical stimulatory cues. We hypothesized that cells  cultured on electroconductive biomaterial will undergo morphological changes and  variations in cell proliferation that could be further enhanced with the  combination of exogenous electrical stimulation (ES). In this study, we  developed electrospun Hyaluronic Acid-Carbon Nanotube (HA-CNT) nanofiber  scaffolds to mimic the axon's topographical and bioelectrical cues that  influence neurofibroma growth and development. The cellular behavior was  qualitatively and quantitively analyzed through immunofluorescent stains, Alamar  blue assays and ELISA assays. Schwann cells from NF1 patients appear to have  lost their ability to respond to electrical stimulation in the development and  regeneration range, which was seen through changes in morphology, proliferation  and NGF release. Without stimulation, the conductive material enhances NF1 SC  behavior. Wild-type SC respond to electrical stimulation with increased cell  proliferation and NGF release. Using this system, we can better understand the  interaction between axons and SC that lead to tumor formation, homeostasis and  regeneration.  Copyright: © 2024 Senanayake et al.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder caused by mutation of the  NF1 gene that is associated with various symptoms, including the formation of  benign tumors, called neurofibromas, within nerves. Drug treatments are  currently limited. The mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor  selumetinib is used for a subset of plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) but is not  always effective and can cause side effects. Therefore, there is a clear need to  discover new drugs to target NF1-deficient tumor cells. Using a Drosophila cell  model of NF1, we performed synthetic lethal screens to identify novel drug  targets. We identified 54 gene candidates, which were validated with variable  dose analysis as a secondary screen. Pathways associated with five candidates  could be targeted using existing drugs. Among these, chloroquine (CQ) and  bafilomycin A1, known to target the autophagy pathway, showed the greatest  potential for selectively killing NF1-deficient Drosophila cells. When further  investigating autophagy-related genes, we found that 14 out of 30 genes tested  had a synthetic lethal interaction with NF1. These 14 genes are involved in  multiple aspects of the autophagy pathway and can be targeted with additional  drugs that mediate the autophagy pathway, although CQ was the most effective.  The lethal effect of autophagy inhibitors was conserved in a panel of human  NF1-deficient Schwann cell lines, highlighting their translational potential.  The effect of CQ was also conserved in a Drosophila NF1 in vivo model and in a  xenografted NF1-deficient tumor cell line grown in mice, with CQ treatment  resulting in a more significant reduction in tumor growth than selumetinib  treatment. Furthermore, combined treatment with CQ and selumetinib resulted in a  further reduction in NF1-deficient cell viability. In conclusion, NF1-deficient  cells are vulnerable to disruption of the autophagy pathway. This pathway  represents a promising target for the treatment of NF1-associated tumors, and we  identified CQ as a candidate drug for the treatment of NF1 tumors.  © 2024 The Author(s).

PURPOSE: Pathogenic LZTR1 variants cause schwannomatosis and dominant/recessive  Noonan syndrome (NS). We aim to establish an association between heterozygous  loss-of-function LZTR1 alleles and isolated multiple café-au-lait macules  (CaLMs). METHODS: A total of 849 unrelated participants with multiple CaLMs, lacking  pathogenic/likely pathogenic NF1 and SPRED1 variants, underwent RASopathy gene  panel sequencing. Data on 125 individuals with heterozygous LZTR1 variants were  collected for characterizing their clinical features and the associated  molecular spectrum. In vitro functional assessment was performed on a  representative panel of missense variants and small in-frame deletions. RESULTS: Analysis revealed heterozygous LZTR1 variants in 6.0% (51/849) of  participants, exceeding the general population prevalence. LZTR1-related CaLMs  varied in number, displayed sharp or irregular borders, and were generally  isolated but occasionally associated with features recurring in RASopathies. In  2 families, CaLMs and schwannomas co-occurred. The molecular spectrum mainly  consisted of truncating variants, indicating loss-of-function. These variants  substantially overlapped with those occurring in schwannomatosis and recessive  NS. Functional characterization showed accelerated protein degradation or  mislocalization, and failure to downregulate mitogen-activated protein kinase  signaling. CONCLUSION: Our findings expand the phenotypic variability associated with LZTR1  variants, which, in addition to conferring susceptibility to schwannomatosis and  causing dominant and recessive NS, occur in individuals with isolated multiple  CaLMs.  Copyright © 2024 American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics.

They occur  sporadically or as part of the hereditary NF2-related schwannomatosis syndrome.  There is an unmet need for new effective drug treatments for both tumour types.  In this paper, we demonstrate overexpression/activation of TAM (TYRO3/AXL/MERTK)  receptors (TAMs) and overexpression/release of ligand GAS6 in patient-derived  meningioma tumour cells and tissue. For the first time, we reveal the formation  of MERTK/TYRO3 heterocomplexes in meningioma and schwannoma tissue. We  demonstrate the dependence of AXL and TYRO3 expression on MERTK in both tumour  types, as well as interdependency of MERTK and AXL expression in meningioma. We  show that MERTK and AXL contribute to increased proliferation and survival of  meningioma and schwannoma cells, which we inhibited in vitro using the  MERTK/FLT3 inhibitor UNC2025 and the AXL inhibitor BGB324. UNC2025 was effective  in both tumour types with superior efficacy over BGB324. Finally, we found that  TAMs are expressed by tumour-associated macrophages in meningioma and schwannoma  tumours and that UNC2025 strongly depleted macrophages in both tumour types.  © 2024. he Authors.

(#)Contributed equally  OBJECTIVE: To integrate pharmacovigilance and network toxicology methods to  explore the potential adverse drug events (ADEs) and toxic mechanisms of  selumetinib, and to provide a reference for quickly understanding the safety and  toxicological mechanisms of newly marketed drugs. METHODS: Taking selumetinib as an example, this study integrated  pharmacovigilance methods based on real-world data and network toxicology  methods to analyze its ADE and its potential toxicological mechanism. First, the  ADE reports of selumetinib were extracted from the US Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) adverse event reporting system (FAERS), and the ADE signals  were detected by reporting odds ratio (ROR) and UK medicines and healthcare  products regulatory agency (MHRA) methods. The ADE signals were classified and  described according to the preferred terms (PTs) and system organ class (SOC)  derived from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The  network toxicology method was used to analyze the toxicological mechanism of the  interested SOCs. The specific steps included predicting the potential targets of  selumetinib using TOXRIC, STITCH, ChEMBL, CTD, SwissTargetPreditcion, and  Super-PRED databases, collecting the targets of SOC using GeneCards database,  conducting protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis through STRING database,  conducting gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG)  analysis through DAVID database, and testing the molecular affinity using  AutoDock software. RESULTS: A total of 1388 ADE reports related to selumetinib were extracted, and  53 positive signals were detected by ROR and MHRA methods, of which 20 signals  were not mentioned in the package insert, including ingrowing nail,  hyperphosphatemia, cardiac valve disease, hematuria, neutropenia, etc. Analysis  of the toxicological mechanism of six SOCs involved in positive ADE signals  revealed that the key targets included EGFR, STAT3, AKT1, IL6, BCL2, etc., and  the key pathways included PI3K/Akt pathway, apoptosis, ErbB signaling pathway,  and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, etc. Molecular docking assays  showed spontaneous binding of selumetinib to key targets in these pathways. CONCLUSION: The pharmacovigilance analysis identified some new potential ADEs of  selumetinib, and the network toxicology analysis showed that the toxic effects  of selumetinib may be related to PI3K/Akt pathway, apoptosis, ErbB signaling  pathway, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance and other pathways.

(2)Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine,  Baltimore, Maryland.  IMPORTANCE: There is a burgeoning interest in therapeutic development for  cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs), a major cause of morbidity in persons with  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). To determine meaningful clinical trial outcomes,  deeper understanding is needed regarding how cNFs are associated with quality of  life (QoL). However, this understanding has been hampered by challenges in  recruiting participants with this rare genetic disease. OBJECTIVE: To develop a large, crowdsourced validated registry of persons with  NF1 and determine the association of specific cNF features with QoL, pain, and  itch. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: From May 2021 to December 2023, a  decentralized platform was developed and recruited persons 40 years or older  with NF1 and at least 1 cNF from 49 states and 12 countries, who provided  clinical survey data, detailed photographs, and genetic sequencing data.  Photographs from 583 participants were scored on 12 features of cNFs, including  general severity, number, size, facial severity, color, and subtypes. EXPOSURE: cNF features derived from participant-supplied photographs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Total Skindex scores and subdomain scores (symptoms,  emotion, function, pain, and itch). RESULTS: Of 583 participants, 384 (65.9%) were female, and the mean (range) age  was 51.7 (40.0-83.0) years. Female sex, general severity, number, size, and  facial severity of cNFs were negatively associated with QoL, as demonstrated by  increased total Skindex scores. QoL had the largest association with the number  of cNFs and presence of facial cNFs. Increasing number of cNFs was associated  with worse QoL, and even individuals with a low cNF burden (<10 total cNFs)  experienced a decrease in QoL. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this study suggest that reducing cNF  number, particularly on the face, may be associated with improved QoL in  individuals with NF1. In addition, early intervention before the development of  numerous tumors may lead to the highest benefit in QoL. These data potentially  provide insight into which individuals and cNF tumors may benefit most from  therapy and highlights the utility of a completely decentralized,  photograph-validated and age-controlled study for rare genetic disease. This  cohort will allow analysis of disease and tumor heterogeneity after full  phenotypic expression is achieved in NF1 and potentially serves as an example in  its design for other rare diseases that struggle from poor recruitment.

Yamauchi T(1), Suka M(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Public Health and Environmental Medicine, The Jikei University  School of Medicine.  BACKGROUND: This study examined the association between neurological symptoms  and quality of life (QoL) in patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) using  a national database of all patients who newly claimed for medical expense  subsidies in Japan from 2015 to 2019. METHODS: The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare provided access to  the ""National Database of Designated Intractable Diseases of Japan"" containing  the ""Medical Certificates of Designated Intractable Diseases"" of all patients  with NF2. The database included information on five items of QoL: ""mobility,""  ""self-care,"" ""usual activities,"" ""pain/discomfort,"" and ""anxiety/depression."" To  examine the association between the presence/absence of neurological symptoms  and QoL, multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed, adjusted for  potential confounders. RESULTS: Data from 187 patients (97 females and 90 males; mean (standard  deviation) age, 43.1 (17.9) years) were analyzed. Overall, 31% to 55% of  patients were recorded as having moderate/severe impairment of QoL. Spinal  dysfunction was significantly associated with deterioration of all components of  QoL, whereas speech dysfunction and hemiparesis were specifically associated  with physical health-related components of QoL. Spinal dysfunction, facial nerve  palsy, and age 25-64 years were significantly associated with  ""anxiety/depression."" CONCLUSIONS: In the present epidemiological study using a national database of  NF2 in Japan, spinal dysfunction was significantly associated with deterioration  of all components of QoL, including subjective and mental health-related  components of QoL, whereas speech dysfunction and hemiparesis were specifically  associated with physical health-related components of QoL.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder that affects  multiple systems in the body, often leading to physical disfigurements and a  wide range of clinical symptoms. This study aims to investigate the relationship  between NF1 severity and visibility and the quality of life (QoL) in children. METHODS: The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) and a modified version  of the Ablon scale were used to assess QoL and NF1 severity and visibility,  respectively. Self-reported and parent-reported QoL scores were compared, and  the associations between NF1 severity/visibility and QoL were explored. RESULTS: Thirty-eight pediatric NF1 patients and their parents were enrolled.  QoL scores did not differ significantly between patient self-reports and parent  reports. However, correlational analyses revealed that higher NF1 severity was  associated with lower physical QoL in patients, and greater NF1 visibility was  linked to lower physical and social QoL. For parents, higher NF1 severity  correlated with lower school functioning, whereas NF1 visibility did not show a  significant correlation with QoL. CONCLUSION: The severity and visibility of NF1 have distinct impacts on various  aspects of QoL in children, highlighting the need for tailored interventions  that address both physical and psychological challenges. These findings  underscore the importance of comprehensive care approaches in managing NF1 in  pediatric populations.

Noonan syndrome and neurofibromatosis type 1 are genetic conditions linked to  pathogenic variants in genes of the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase  signalling pathway. Both conditions hyper-activate signalling of the  Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and exhibit a high prevalence of  neuropsychiatric disorders. Further, animal models of Noonan syndrome and  neurofibromatosis type 1 and human imaging studies show white matter  abnormalities in both conditions. While these findings suggest  Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinas pathway hyper-activation effects on white  matter, it is unknown whether these effects are syndrome-specific or  pathway-specific. To characterize the effect of Noonan syndrome and  neurofibromatosis type 1 on human white matter's microstructural integrity and  discern potential syndrome-specific influences on microstructural integrity of  individual tracts, we collected diffusion-weighted imaging data from children  with Noonan syndrome (n = 24), neurofibromatosis type 1 (n = 28) and age- and  sex-matched controls (n = 31). We contrasted the clinical groups (Noonan  syndrome or neurofibromatosis type 1) and controls using voxel-wise, tract-based  and along-tract analyses. Outcomes included voxel-wise, tract-based and  along-tract fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity and  mean diffusivity. Noonan syndrome and neurofibromatosis type 1 showed similar  patterns of reduced fractional anisotropy and increased axial diffusivity,  radial diffusivity, and mean diffusivity on white matter relative to controls  and different spatial patterns. Noonan syndrome presented a more extensive  spatial effect than neurofibromatosis type 1 on white matter integrity as  measured by fractional anisotropy. Tract-based analysis also demonstrated  differences in effect magnitude with overall lower fractional anisotropy in  Noonan syndrome compared to neurofibromatosis type 1 (d = 0.4). At the tract  level, Noonan syndrome-specific effects on fractional anisotropy were detected  in association tracts (superior longitudinal, uncinate and arcuate fasciculi; P  < 0.012), and neurofibromatosis type 1-specific effects were detected in the  corpus callosum (P < 0.037) compared to controls. Results from along-tract  analyses aligned with results from tract-based analyses and indicated that  effects are pervasive along the affected tracts. In conclusion, we find that  pathogenic variants in the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway are  associated with white matter abnormalities as measured by diffusion in the  developing brain. Overall, Noonan syndrome and neurofibromatosis type 1 show  common effects on fractional anisotropy and diffusion scalars, as well as  specific unique effects, namely, on temporoparietal-frontal tracts  (intra-hemispheric) in Noonan syndrome and on the corpus callosum  (inter-hemispheric) in neurofibromatosis type 1. The observed specific effects  not only confirm prior observations from independent cohorts of Noonan syndrome  and neurofibromatosis type 1 but also inform on syndrome-specific susceptibility  of individual tracts. Thus, these findings suggest potential targets for  precise, brain-focused outcome measures for existing medications, such as MEK  inhibitors, that act on the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.

Neurofibromin (Nf1) is a giant multidomain protein encoded by the  tumour-suppressor gene NF1. NF1 is mutated in a common genetic disease,  neurofibromatosis type I (NF1), and in various cancers. The protein has a  Ras-GAP (GTPase activating protein) activity but is also connected to diverse  signalling pathways through its SecPH domain, which interacts with lipids and  different protein partners. We previously showed that Nf1 partially colocalized  with the ProMyelocytic Leukemia (PML) protein in PML nuclear bodies, hotspots of  SUMOylation, thereby suggesting the potential SUMOylation of Nf1. Here, we  demonstrate that the full-length isoform 2 and a SecPH fragment of Nf1 are  substrates of the SUMO pathway and identify a well-defined SUMOylation profile  of SecPH with two main modified lysines. One of these sites, K1731, is highly  conserved and surface-exposed. Despite the presence of an inverted SUMO  consensus motif surrounding K1731, and a potential SUMO-interacting motif (SIM)  within SecPH, we show that neither of these elements is necessary for K1731  SUMOylation, which is also independent of Ubc9 SUMOylation on K14. A 3D model of  an interaction between SecPH and Ubc9 centred on K1731, combined with  site-directed mutagenesis, identifies specific structural elements of SecPH  required for K1731 SUMOylation, some of which are affected in reported NF1  pathogenic variants. This work provides a new example of SUMOylation dependent  on the tertiary rather than primary protein structure surrounding the modified  site, expanding our knowledge of mechanisms governing SUMOylation site  selection.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (OMIM 162200) affects ~ 1 in 3,000 individuals  worldwide and is one of the most common monogenetic neurogenetic disorders that  impacts brain function. The disorder affects various organ systems, including  the central nervous system, resulting in a spectrum of clinical manifestations.  Significant progress has been made in understanding the disorder's  pathophysiology, yet gaps persist in understanding how the complex signaling and  systemic interactions affect the disorder. Two features of the disorder are  alterations in neuronal function and metabolism, and emerging evidence suggests  a potential relationship between them. This review summarizes neurofibromatosis  type 1 features and recent research findings on disease mechanisms, with an  emphasis on neuronal and metabolic features.  © 2024. The Author(s).

BACKGROUND: Cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs) are a major cause of disfigurement in  patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1). However, clinical trials  investigating cNF treatments lack standardised outcome measures to objectively  evaluate changes in cNF size and appearance. 3D imaging has been proposed as an  objective standardised outcome measure however various systems exist with  different features that affect useability in clinical settings. The aim of this  study was to compare the accuracy, precision, feasibility, reliability and  accessibility of three imaging systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared the Vectra-H1, LifeViz-Micro and  Cherry-Imaging systems. A total of 58 cNFs from 13 participants with NF1 were  selected for imaging and analysis. The primary endpoint was accuracy as measured  by comparison of measurements between imaging systems. Secondary endpoints  included reliability between two operators, precision as measured with the  average coefficient of variation, feasibility as determined by time to capture  and analyse an image and accessibility as determined by cost. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in accuracy between the three  devices for length or surface area measurements (p > 0.05), and reliability and  precision were similar. Volume measurements demonstrated the most variability  compared to other measurements; LifeViz-Micro demonstrated the least measurement  variability for surface area and image capture and analysis were fastest with  LifeViz-Micro. LifeViz-Micro was better for imaging smaller number of cNFs  (1-3), Vectra-H1 better for larger areas and Cherry for uneven surfaces. CONCLUSIONS: All systems demonstrated excellent reliability but possess distinct  advantages and limitations. Surface area is the most consistent and reliable  parameter for measuring cNF size in clinical trials.  © 2024 The Author(s). Skin Research and Technology published by John Wiley &  Sons Ltd.

INTRODUCTION: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a rare genetic disorder, with  lack of evidence of disease burden in China. We aimed to describe the economic  burden, health-related quality of life (HRQL), and caregiver burden of NF1  patients in China. METHODS: We conducted an online cross-sectional survey employing the China Cloud  Platform for Rare Diseases, with 223 caregivers of NF1 pediatric patients  (patients under 18), and 226 adult patients. Economic burden was estimated using  direct and indirect costs related to NF1 in 2021, and the Work Productivity and  Activity Impairment Questionnaire: General Health V2.0 (WPAI-GH). HRQL measures  included EQ-5D-Y proxy version and PedsQL™ 4.0 Generic Core Scales (PedsQL GCS)  proxy version for pediatric patients, and EQ-5D-5L and PedsQL™ 3.0  Neurofibromatosis Module (PedsQL NFM) for adult patients. Caregiver burden was  estimated by Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). RESULTS: For pediatric patients, the average direct cost in 2021 was CNY 33,614  (USD 4,879), and employed caregivers' annual productivity loss was 81 days.  EQ-5D-Y utility was 0.880 ± 0.13 and VAS score was 75.38 ± 20.67, with 52.6%  patients reporting having problems in ""pain/discomfort"" and 42.9% in  ""anxiety/depression."" PedsQL GCS total score was 68.47 ± 19.42. ZBI score  demonstrated that 39.5% of caregivers had moderate-to-severe or severe burden.  For adult patients, average direct cost in 2021 was CNY 24,531 (USD 3,560).  Patients in employment reported an absenteeism of 8.5% and presenteeism of 21.6%  according to the results of WPAI-GH. EQ-5D-5L utility was 0.843 ± 0.17 and VAS  score was 72.32 ± 23.49, with more than half of patients reporting having  problems in ""pain/discomfort"" and ""anxiety/depression"" dimensions. PedsQL NFM  total score was 68.40 ± 15.57. CONCLUSION: Both pediatric and adult NF1 patients in China had a wide-ranging  economic burden and low HRQL, especially in the psychological dimension.  Caregivers for NF1 pediatric patients experienced considerable caregiver burden.  More attention and support from policymakers and stakeholders are required to  relieve NF1 patients' and caregivers' distress.

Pathogenic variants in the leucine zipper-like transcriptional regulator 1 gene  (LZTR1) have been identified in schwannomatosis and Noonan syndrome. Here, we  expand the phenotype spectrum of LZTR1 variants. We identified four  loss-of-function heterozygous LZTR1 variants in five children with multiple café  au lait macules and one adult with multiple café au lait macules and axillar  freckling, by applying gene panel analysis in four families. The three LZTR1  variants, namely, c.184del/p.Glu62Serfs*39, c.1927C < T/p.Gln643*, and  c.857_858delinsT/p.Gly286Valfs*65, were novel, whereas the variant c.1018C > T/  p.Arg340* had been previously reported in a patient with schwannomatosis.  Similar to what is known from other LZTR1-associated conditions, penetrance of  the skin manifestations was reduced in two carriers of the familial variants.  Our study expands the LZTR1 phenotype to the presence of isolated café au lait  macules with or without freckling. Thus, variants in the LZTR1 gene should be  considered in patients with multiple café au lait macules.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), an autosomal dominant genetic disorder, is  caused by mutations in the NF1 gene, which encodes the GTPase-activating protein  neurofibromin. The pathogenesis of the tumor progression of benign plexiform  neurofibromas (PNs) and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) remain  unclear. Here, we found that interferon-induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1)  was downregulated in MPNST tissues compared to those in PN tissues from patients  with NF1. Overexpression of IFITM1 in NF1-associated MPNST cells resulted in a  significant decrease in Ras activation (GTP-Ras) and downstream extracellular  regulatory kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation, whereas downregulation of IFITM1  via treatment with small interfering RNA in normal Schwann cells had the  opposite result, indicating that expression levels of IFITM1 are closely  associated with tumor progression in NF1. Treatment of MPNST cells with  interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) significantly augmented the expression of IFITM1,  thereby leading to a decrease in Ras and ERK1/2 activation. Despite the small  number of patient samples, these findings may potentially provide a new target  for chemotherapy in patients with NF1-associated MPNSTs. In xenograft mice  injected with MPNST cells, IFN-γ treatment successfully suppressed tumor  progression with increased IFITM1 expression and decreased Ras and ERK1/2  activation in tumor tissues. Collectively, these results suggest that IFITM1 is  closely involved in MPNST pathogenesis and that IFN-γ is a good candidate for  the therapeutic treatment of MPNSTs in NF1.

PURPOSE: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are aggressive  soft-tissue sarcomas and the leading cause of mortality in individuals with  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Despite many clinical trials, outcomes for  patients with MPNST have remained stagnant, and most succumb to their disease;  thus, novel therapeutic approaches are needed. A better understanding of the  MPNST immune ecosystem will aid in the development of strategies to activate the  immune system against the tumor. In this study, we profile the tumor immune  microenvironment (TIME) in NF1-associated peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNST)  to discover insights on the role played by tumor-infiltrating immune cells in  malignant transformation. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using fresh and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue  from patients diagnosed with NF1-PNST, we dissected the TIME through IHC,  multiparameter flow cytometry, and comparative transcriptomic studies. RESULTS: Immunophenotyping confirmed increased immune cell infiltration during  malignant progression, with a predominance of infiltrating myeloid cells,  particularly CD163+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). The T cells within MPNST  exhibited signs of tumor activation, characterized by high programmed cell death  1 expression. Additionally, MPNST specimens demonstrated elevated levels of  immunosuppressive TAM, with heightened PD-L1 expression. The proportion of  CD163+ myeloid cells within the TIME correlated with poorer progression-free  survival. Notably, loss of H3K27 trimethylation correlated with low immune cell  infiltration in MPNST. CONCLUSIONS: Malignant transformation of NF1-PNST is characterized by an  immunosuppressive microenvironment comprising TAM with high expression of PD-L1,  which is associated with inferior outcomes. These findings suggest the clinical  potential of immune-modulating therapeutics that can unleash an antitumor immune  response.  ©2024 American Association for Cancer Research.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from  mutations in the NF1 gene. Patients harboring these mutations are predisposed to  a spectrum of peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) originating from Schwann  cells, of which malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are the  deadliest, with limited treatment options. Therefore, an unmet need still exists  for more effective therapies directed at these aggressive malignancies. Cold  atmospheric plasma (CAP) is a reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive  nitrogen species (RNS) generating ionized gas that has been proposed to be a  potential therapeutic modality for cancer. In this study, we sought to determine  the effects of CAP on NF1-associated PNSTs. Utilizing established mouse and  human cell lines to interrogate the effects of CAP in both in vitro and in vivo  settings, we found that NF1-associated PNSTs were highly sensitive to CAP  exposure, resulting in cell death. To our knowledge, this is the first  application of CAP to NF1-associated PNSTs and provides a unique opportunity to  study the complex biology of NF1-associated tumors.

BACKGROUND: RASopathies, which include neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), are  defined by Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (Ras/MAPK) pathway activation.  They represent a group of clinically related disorders often characterised by  multiple Café au Lait Macules (CALMs). OBJECTIVES: To determine, using in depth transcriptomic analysis of NF1  melanocytes from CALM and unaffected skin, (1) the gene(s) responsible for  melanocyte proliferation and migration, and (2) the activated signalling  pathway(s) in NF1 melanoma. METHODS: Classical NF1 (n = 2, who develop tumours) and 3bp deletion NF1 (p.  Met992del, who do not develop tumours) (n = 3) patients underwent skin biopsies  from CALM and unaffected skin. Melanocytes were isolated and propagated, with  five replicates from each tissue sample. DNA and RNA were extracted for  mutational analysis and transcriptomic profiling with six replicates per sample.  Mechanistic determination was undertaken using melanocyte and melanoma cell  lines. RESULTS: All CALMs in NF1 were associated with biallelic NF1 loss, resulting in  amplification of Ras/MAPK and Wnt pathway signalling. CALMs were also associated  with reduced SERPINF1 gene expression (and pigment epithelium-derived factor  (PEDF) levels, the reciprocal protein), a known downstream target of the master  regulator of melanocyte differentiation microphthalmia-associated transcription  factor (MITF), leading to increased melanocyte proliferation, migration and  invasion. In classical NF1 and melanoma, but not 3bp deletion NF1, there was  also activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Pigment epithelium-derived factor was  found to reduce cell proliferation and invasion of NF1 melanoma. CONCLUSIONS: Melanocyte proliferation and migration leading to CALMs in NF1  arises from biallelic NF1 loss, resulting in RAS/MAPK pathway activation, and  reduced expression of the tumour suppressor PEDF. Activation of the PI3K/AKT  pathway in classical NF1 and NF1 melanoma may facilitate tumour growth.  © 2024 The Authors.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a prevalent autosomal dominant disorder caused  by mutations in the NF1 gene, leading to multisystem disorders. Given the  critical role of cysteine residues in protein stability and function, we aimed  to identify key NF1 mutations affecting cysteine residues that significantly  contribute to neurofibromatosis pathology. To identify the most critical  mutations in the NF1 gene that contribute to the pathology of neurofibromatosis,  we employed a sophisticated computational pipeline specifically designed to  detect significant mutations affecting the NF1 gene. Our approach involved an  exhaustive search of databases such as the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD),  UniProt, and ClinVar for information on missense mutations associated with NF1.  Our search yielded a total of 204 unique cysteine missense mutations. We then  employed in silico prediction tools, including PredictSNP, iStable, and Align  GVGD, to assess the impact of these mutations. Among the mutations, C379R,  R1000C, and C1016Y stood out due to their deleterious effects on the biophysical  properties of the neurofibromin protein, significantly destabilizing its  structure. These mutations were subjected to further phenotyping analysis using  SNPeffect 4.0, which predicted disturbances in the protein's chaperone binding  sites and overall structural stability. Furthermore, to directly visualize the  impact of these mutations on protein structure, we utilized AlphaFold3 to  simulate both the wild-type and mutant NF1 structures, revealing the significant  effects of the R1000C mutation on the protein's conformation. In conclusion, the  identification of these mutations can play a pivotal role in advancing the field  of precision medicine and aid in the development of effective drugs for  associated diseases.  © 2024.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder  characterized by the predisposition to develop tumors such as malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) which represents the primary cause of  death for NF1-affected patients. Regardless of the high incidence and mortality,  the molecular mechanisms underneath MPNST growth and metastatic progression  remain poorly understood. In this proof-of-concept study, we performed somatic  whole-exome sequencing (WES) to profile the genomic alterations in four samples  from a patient with NF1-associated MPNST, consisting of a benign plexiform  neurofibroma, a primary MPNST, and metastases from lung and skin tissues. By  comparing genomic patterns, we identified a high level of variability across  samples with distinctive genetic changes which allow for the definition of  profiles of the early phase with respect to the late metastatic stages.  Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants were abundant in the primary tumor,  whereas the metastatic samples exhibited a high level of copy-number variations  (CNVs), highlighting a possible genomic instability in the late phases. The most  known MPNST-related genes, such as TP53 and SUZ12, were identified in CNVs  observed within the primary tumor. Pathway analysis of altered early genes in  MPNST pointed to a potential role in cell motility, division and metabolism.  Moreover, we employed survival analysis with the TCGA sarcoma genomic dataset on  262 affected patients, in order to corroborate the predictive significance of  the identified early and metastatic MPNST driver genes. Specifically, the  expression changes related to the mutated genes, such as in RBMX, PNPLA6 and  AGAP2, were associated with reduced patient survival, distinguishing them as  potential prognostic biomarkers. This study underlines the relevance of  integrating genomic results with clinical information for early diagnosis and  prognostic understanding of tumor aggressiveness.

Plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) are benign nerve tumors driven by loss of the NF1  tumor suppressor in Schwann cells. PNFs are rich in immune cells, but whether  immune cells are necessary for tumorigenesis is unknown. We show that inhibition  of stimulator of interferon gene (STING) reduces plasma CXCL10, tumor T cell and  dendritic cell (DC) recruitment, and tumor formation. Further, mice lacking  XCR-1+ DCs showed reduced tumor-infiltrating T cells and PNF tumors.  Antigen-presenting cells from tumor-bearing mice promoted CD8+ T cell  proliferation in vitro, and PNF T cells expressed high levels of CCL5,  implicating T cell activation. Notably, tumors and nerve-associated macrophages  were absent in Rag1-/-; Nf1f/f; DhhCre mice and adoptive transfer of CD8+ T  cells from tumor-bearing mice restored PNF initiation. In this setting, PNF  shrunk upon subsequent T cell removal. Thus, STING pathway activation  contributes to CD8+ T cell-dependent inflammatory responses required for PNF  initiation and maintenance.

Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF-2) is a dominantly inherited genetic disorder that  results from variants in the tumor suppressor gene, neurofibromin 2 (NF2). Here,  we report the generation of a conditional zebrafish model of neurofibromatosis  established by inducible genetic knockout of nf2a/b, the zebrafish homologs of  human NF2. Analysis of nf2a and nf2b expression revealed ubiquitous expression  of nf2b in the early embryo, with overlapping expression in the neural crest and  its derivatives and in the cranial mesenchyme. In contrast, nf2a displayed lower  expression levels. Induction of nf2a/b knockout at early stages increased the  proliferation of larval Schwann cells and meningeal fibroblasts. Subsequently,  in adult zebrafish, nf2a/b knockout triggered the development of a spectrum of  tumors, including vestibular Schwannomas, spinal Schwannomas, meningiomas and  retinal hamartomas, mirroring the tumor manifestations observed in patients with  NF-2. Collectively, these findings highlight the generation of a novel zebrafish  model that mimics the complexities of the human NF-2 disorder. Consequently,  this model holds significant potential for facilitating therapeutic screening  and elucidating key driver genes implicated in NF-2 onset.  © 2024.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are highly aggressive Schwann  cell-derived sarcomas that are sporadic or associated with Neurofibromatosis 1  (NF1) gene mutations. Traditional therapies are usually ineffective for treating  MPNSTs, so new targets need to be identified for the treatment of MPNSTs. In the  present study, the role of the mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO) in the  regulation of cell proliferation and the cell cycle in MPNSTs was investigated.  TSPO expression was lower in MPNSTs than in NFs. Loss-of-function experiments  revealed that TSPO deficiency promoted MPNST cell growth, migration, and  invasion and influenced the cell cycle in vitro and in vivo. In addition, TSPO  depletion suppressed cell apoptosis by downregulating the expression of  caspase-3, caspase-8, HSP60, p27, p53, and BCL-2 and suppressed the cell cycle  by upregulating CDK1, CDK2, CCNB1 and CCNA2. Furthermore, CDK1 was determined to  be an upstream target of TSPO-mediated regulation via RNA-seq, qPCR, and Western  blotting. Specifically, depletion of CDK1 weakened the effect of TSPO deficiency  on cell proliferation and migration. More importantly, CDK1 knockdown induced  significant cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. In summary, TSPO deficiency  regulates the cell cycle in MPNSTs by targeting CDK1, which may be an effective  molecular target for prognosis evaluation and treatment.  © 2024. The Author(s).

To study telomere maintenance mechanism (TMM) activation during malignant  transformation, we compared neurofibroma (NF) and malignant peripheral nerve  sheath tumor (MPNST) in the same patient with type-1 neurofibromatosis (NF1), a  total of 20 NF-MPNST pairs in 20 NF1 patients. These comparisons minimized  genetic bias and contrasted only changes associated with malignant  transformation, while subtracting changes that developed upon the transformation  of normal cells to the benign tumor. TGF-β superfamily genes were found to  activate the PAX and SOX transcription factors, leading to TMM activation. BMPER  activates PAX6 through BMP2 and PAX7 through BMP4; BMP15 activates SOX14; and  INHBC activates PAX9 and SOX14. The activated PAX and SOX genes sequentially  establish the core architecture of the RAD52-dependent alternative lengthening  of telomeres (ALT). Specifically, PAX7 activates the recombinase (RAD52) and a  negative regulator (SLX4IP). PAX6 and SOX14 activate positive regulators (BLM  and BRCA2, respectively). PAX9 and SOX14 activate RAD9B and FEN1, which are  responsible for the stability of homologous recombination intermediates and  increase, together with RAD52, the telomere length. Telomere elongation achieved  by the activation of PAX7 and PAX9 is associated with a poor prognosis. We  demonstrated that TGF-β superfamily-induced transcriptional activation pathways  activated the RAD52-dependent ALT during malignant transformation of MPNSTs.  © 2024. The Author(s).

PURPOSE: Pharmacologic therapies for neurofibromatosis type 1-associated  plexiform neurofibromas (NF1-PNs) are limited; currently, none are US Food and  Drug Administration-approved for adults. METHODS: ReNeu is an open-label, multicenter, pivotal, phase IIb trial of  mirdametinib in 58 adults (≥18 years of age) and 56 children (2 to 17 years of  age) with NF1-PN causing significant morbidities. Patients received mirdametinib  capsules or tablets for oral suspension (2 mg/m2 twice daily, maximum 4 mg twice  daily), regardless of food intake, in 3 weeks on/1 week off 28-day cycles. The  primary end point was confirmed objective response rate (ORR; proportion of  patients with a ≥20% reduction of target PN volume from baseline on consecutive  scans during the 24-cycle treatment phase) assessed by blinded independent  central review (BICR) of volumetric magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Twenty-four of 58 adults (41%) and 29 of 56 children (52%) had a  BICR-confirmed objective response during the 24-cycle treatment phase; in  addition, two adults and one child had confirmed responses during long-term  follow-up. Median (range) target PN volumetric best response was -41% (-90 to  13) in adults and -42% (-91 to 48) in children. Both cohorts reported  significant and clinically meaningful improvement in patient- or parent  proxy-reported outcome measures of worst tumor pain severity, pain interference,  and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) that began early and were sustained  during treatment. The most commonly reported treatment-related adverse events  were dermatitis acneiform, diarrhea, and nausea in adults and dermatitis  acneiform, diarrhea, and paronychia in children. CONCLUSION: In ReNeu, the largest multicenter NF1-PN trial reported to date,  mirdametinib treatment demonstrated significant confirmed ORRs by BICR, deep and  durable PN volume reductions, and early, sustained, and clinically meaningful  improvement in pain and HRQOL. Mirdametinib was well-tolerated in adults and  children.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder that predisposes  individuals to develop benign and malignant tumors of the nerve sheath.  Understanding the signatures of cancer stem cells (CSCs) for NF1-associated  tumors may facilitate the early detection of tumor progression. Background:  Neural crest cells, the cell of origin of NF1-associated tumors, can initiate  multiple tumor types, including melanoma, neuroblastoma, and schwannoma. CSCs  within these tumors have been reported; however, identifying and targeting CSC  populations remains a challenge. Results: This study aims to leverage existing  studies on neural crest-derived CSCs to explore markers pertinent to NF1  tumorigenesis. By focusing on the molecular and cellular dynamics within these  tumors, we summarize CSC signatures in tumor maintenance, progression, and  treatment resistance. Conclusion: A review of these signatures in the context of  NF1 will provide insights into NF1 tumor biology and pave the way for developing  targeted therapies and improving treatment outcomes for NF1 patients.

Petri nets are commonly applied in modeling biological systems. However,  construction of a Petri net model for complex biological systems is often time  consuming, and requires expertise in the research area, limiting their  application. To address this challenge, we developed GINtoSPN, an R package that  automates the conversion of multi-omics molecular interaction network extracted  from the Global Integrative Network (GIN) into Petri nets in GraphML format.  These GraphML files can be directly used for Signaling Petri Net (SPN)  simulation. To demonstrate the utility of this tool, we built a Petri net model  for neurofibromatosis type I. Simulation of NF1 gene knockout, compared to  normal skin fibroblast cells, revealed persistent accumulation of Ras-GTPs as  expected. Additionally, we identified several other genes substantially affected  by the loss of NF1's function, exhibiting individual-specific variability. These  results highlight the effectiveness of GINtoSPN in streamlining the modeling and  simulation of complex biological systems.  © 2024. The Author(s).

INTRODUCTION: Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a chronic neurocutaneous disease  known to profoundly affect quality of life (QoL). We have performed an analysis  of disease severity, mental and physical QoL and compare the different  subclasses among patients with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective analysis of 89 NF1 patients  between January 2016 and March 2018. Data sourced from local records including  demographic information, employment status, education level, and marital status.  All patients completed 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and additionally  the numerical pain rating scale (NPS). Patients were stratified based on  severity of NF1, visibility and disease severity. RESULTS: Among 89 patients, severity was classified as grade 4 was identified in  42 (47.2%), moderate in 17 (19.1%), mild in 23 (25.8%) and minimal in 7 (7.9%)  cases. According to visibility scale, severe grade 3 was found in 28 (31.5%),  moderate grade 2 in 26 (29.2%) and mild grade in 35 (39.3%) cases. SF-36 data,  except for pain, showed significantly lower values, if compared to the standard  German population (P < 0.001, physical component summary P = 0.045). Sex,  marital status and education level did not significantly influence results.  Employment was significantly associated with better mental and physical status  (P = 0.028 and P = 0.01 respectively) and age >40 was linked to lower physical  (P = 0.027) but not mental component scores (P = 0.362). The numerical pain  rating scale indicated pain levels of 7-10 in 9 cases (10,1%), 5-6 in 10  patients (11.2%), 1-4 in 26 patients (29.2%) and no pain in 44 cases (49.4%).  Physical component scores significantly differed across different NPS grades (P  < 0.001) but not in mental component scores (P = 0.06). Finally, no significant  differences were found in mental component scores across severity or visibility  grades. CONCLUSION: Severity and visibility grades of patients with NF1 may not  necessarily result in poor mental health. Symptomatic treatment should be  considered even for severely disabled patients as they may have comparable QoL  to less severely affected patients with NF1. Employment was linked to better  quality of life outcomes in our findings.  Copyright © 2024 Bäzner, Stauss, Kapapa, Wirtz and Pala.

Fatty acid binding protein 7 (FABP7) is a multifunctional chaperone involved in  lipid metabolism and signaling. It is primarily expressed in astrocytes and  neural stem cells (NSCs), as well as their derived malignant glioma cells within  the central nervous system. Despite growing evidence for FABP7's tumor-intrinsic  onco-metabolic functions, its mechanistic role in regulating the brain tumor  immune microenvironment (TIME) and its impact on prognosis at the molecular  level remain incompletely understood. Utilizing combined transcriptome profiling  and pan-cancer analysis approaches, we report that FABP7 mediates the expression  of multiple onco-immune drivers, collectively impacting tumor immunity and  clinical outcomes across brain cancer subtypes. An analysis of a single-cell  expression atlas revealed that FABP7 is predominantly expressed in the glial  lineage and malignant cell populations in gliomas, with nuclear localization in  their parental NSCs. Pathway and gene enrichment analysis of RNA sequencing data  from wild-type (WT) and Fabp7-knockout (KO) mouse brains, alongside control  (CTL) and FABP7-overexpressing (FABP7 OV) human astrocytes, revealed a more  pronounced effect of FABP7 levels on multiple cancer-associated pathways.  Notably, genes linked to brain cancer progression and tumor immunity (ENO1,  MUC1, COL5A1, and IL11) were significantly downregulated (>2-fold) in KO brain  tissue but were upregulated in FABP7 OV astrocytes. Furthermore, an analysis of  data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) showed robust correlations between the  expression of these factors, as well as FABP7, and established glioma oncogenes  (EGFR, BRAF, NF1, PDGFRA, IDH1), with stronger associations seen in low-grade  glioma (LGG) than in glioblastoma (GBM). TIME profiling also revealed that the  expression of FABP7 and the genes that it modulates was significantly associated  with prognosis and survival, particularly in LGG patients, by influencing the  infiltration of immunosuppressive cell populations within tumors. Overall, our  findings suggest that FABP7 acts as an intracellular regulator of pro-tumor  immunomodulatory genes, exerting a synergistic effect on the TIME and clinical  outcomes in brain cancer subtypes.

Neurofibromatosis (NF) is identified as genetic disorder characterized by  multiple tumors on nerve tissues. NF1 is the most prevalent form, identified by  neurofibromas and skin changes. NF1 is the most prevalent neurofibromatosis  disorder, distinct from the rarer NF2 and schwannomatosis (SWN) conditions. NF2,  including NF2-related SWN (NF2-SWN), predominantly involves schwannoma formation  and differs from NF1 in its genetic basis and clinical presentation. Despite the  established genetic basis of NF, effective treatments remain scarce. Long  non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as important regulators of gene  expression, impacting pathways vital to tumor biology. This review explores the  lncRNAs role in NF pathogenesis along with their potential as therapeutic  targets. LncRNAs such as ANRIL and H19 show dysregulated expression in NF,  influencing signaling pathways like Ras/MAPK and JAK/STAT, thereby contributing  to tumor development. Understanding these interactions sheds light on the  molecular mechanisms underlying NF and highlights lncRNAs as potential  biomarkers of diagnosis and prognosis of NF. Additionally, therapeutic  strategies targeting lncRNAs with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) or  CRISPR-Cas9 offer promising treatment options. The present review emphasizes  crucial role of lncRNAs in NF pathogenesis and their promise to create  innovative treatments, aiming to improve patient outcomes and meet the urgent  need for effective NF therapies.  Plain Language Summary: Neurofibromatosis (NF) is identified as genetic  condition that causes tumors to grow on the nerve tissues. NF1 is a subtype and  more common and causes changes in the skin along with tumors, while NF2 is  related to schwannomatosis (NF2 SWN) involve tumors from nerve cells and can  lead to hearing loss and severe pain. Currently, there are limited effective  treatments for NF. In our review, we focus on long non coding RNAs (lncRNAs),  which help control gene expression. These molecules are important because they  can affect how tumors grow. We found that certain lncRNAs, like ANRIL and H19,  are not working correctly in NF. They influence important cell pathways that are  involved in tumor development. Understanding how these lncRNAs work could help  us find new ways to diagnose and treat NF. We also discuss new treatment  approaches that target these lncRNAs using special techniques like antisense  oligonucleotides (ASOs) and CRISPR Cas9. These methods show promise for creating  more effective treatments. However, there are challenges in delivering  Information Classification: General Information Classification: General these  treatments safely and effectively. Our review highlights the potential of  targeting lncRNAs to develop better diagnostic tools and treatments for NF. We  hope that this understanding will leads to improved outcomes of patient centric  treatments and encourage further research into these promising new therapies.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic condition characterized  by various somatic manifestations and cognitive impairments, but the latter are  sparsely described in adults. This study aimed at characterizing potential  impairments of neurocognitive functions using neuropsychological tests as well  as a self-report questionnaire. METHODS: In a nationwide, population-based study including 103 adults with NF1  and 38 age- and gender-matched NF1-free comparisons, we used a comprehensive  neurocognitive test battery to assess intelligence and visual short-term memory,  immediate visuospatial recall, reaction time, sustained attention, motor speed,  planning, planning time, working memory as well as multitasking and a  questionnaire to assess executive functions. Descriptive statistics,  multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), and general linear models with  repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used. RESULTS: We observed a statistically significant difference in overall  performance-based cognitive functioning. Adults with NF1 showed significant,  moderate-to-severe impairments in intelligence, visual short-term memory,  immediate visuospatial recall, sustained attention (p < 0.0001-0.002), and some  executive functions (p = 0.008 - 0.001), whereas other cognitive functions  (multitasking, reaction time, motor speed, spatial working memory, planning  time, and planning efficacy as well as some self-reported executive functions)  were unimpaired. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study with a population-based sample of persons  with NF1 and the results show impairments of intelligence and other cognitive  functions. The pattern of both significant cognitive impairments and  non-significantly different cognitive functions suggests a cognitive profile of  selective rather than generalized cognitive deficits in NF1.  © 2024.

BACKGROUND: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) can arise from  atypical neurofibromas (ANF). Loss of the polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) is  a common event. Previous studies on PRC2-regulated genes in MPNST used genetic  add-back experiments in highly aneuploid MPNST cell lines which may miss  PRC2-regulated genes in NF1-mutant ANF-like precursor cells. A set of  PRC2-regulated genes in human Schwann cells (SCs) has not been defined. We  hypothesized that PRC2 loss has direct and indirect effects on gene expression  resulting in MPNST, so we sought to identify PRC2-regulated genes in  immortalized human Schwann cells (iHSCs). METHODS: We engineered NF1-deficient iHSCs with loss of function SUZ12 or EED  mutations. RNA sequencing revealed 1327 differentially expressed genes to define  PRC2-regulated genes. To investigate MPNST pathogenesis, we compared genes in  iHSCs to consistent gene expression differences between ANF and MPNSTs.  Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing was used to further define targets.  Methylome and proteomic analyses were performed to further identify enriched  pathways. RESULTS: We identified potential PRC2-regulated drivers of MPNST progression.  Pathway analysis indicates many upregulated cancer-related pathways. We found  transcriptional evidence for activated Notch and Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling  in PRC2-deficient iHSCs. Functional studies confirm that Notch signaling is  active in MPNST cell lines, patient-derived xenografts, and transient cell  models of PRC2 deficiency. A combination of MEK and γ-secretase inhibition shows  synergy in MPNST cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: We identified PRC2-regulated genes and potential drivers of MPNSTs.  Our findings support the Notch pathway as a druggable target in MPNSTs. Our  identification of PRC2-regulated genes and pathways could result in more novel  therapeutic approaches.  © The Author(s) 2024.

Based on clinical phenotypes, exome sequencing for small-nucleotide  variations or array-based methods for copy-number variations (CNVs) are commonly  offered to identify the underlying causative genetic variants. In this study, we  investigated whether data from a standard ES test could be used to additionally  identify pathogenic CNVs and increase diagnostic yield. METHODS: Prospectively, 134 patients presenting with a skin condition suspected  of being genetic in origin were offered the next-generation variant exon  screening (ngVES) test. Sequencing data were analyzed for both single-nucleotide  variants and CNVs using established algorithms. RESULTS: The positive detection rate for skin diseases using ngVES was 66%  (88/134) with the most common diagnoses being neurofibromatosis type1 (n = 48)  and tuberous sclerosis type2 (n = 12). The diagnostic increased yield from 58%  to 66% was the result of additional detection of pathogenic CNVs. Each of the 9  CNVs were verified by independent genetic tests. CONCLUSION: The advances in the ngVES bioinformatics pipeline are proofs of  concept, which improved identification of genetic variants associated with skin  disease. Simultaneous single-nucleotide variants/INDEL and CNV detection by this  approach demonstrates ngVES potential as a first-tier screen for any suspected  genetic disease.  © 2024 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American College of Medical  Genetics and Genomics.

Comment in     Neuro Oncol. 2025 Jun 21;27(5):1256-1257. doi: 10.1093/neuonc/noaf054.  BACKGROUND: NF2-related schwannomatosis (NF2-SWN) is associated with multiple  benign tumors in the nervous system. NF2-SWN, caused by mutations in the NF2  gene, has developed into intracranial and spinal schwannomas. Because of the  high surgical risk and frequent recurrence of multiple tumors, targeted therapy  is necessary. However, there are no approved drugs. METHODS: We examined the action mechanism of PRG-N-01, a candidate molecule for  NF2-SWN, through the direct binding assay and mass spectrometry. For in vitro  anti-proliferative experiments, primary cells derived from the NF2 mouse model  and patient tumors were treated with PRG-N-01. The in vivo therapeutic and  preventive efficacy was validated via intraperitoneal and oral administration in  the NF2 mouse model (Postn-Cre; Nf2f/f). Gene expression profile in the DRG of  the mouse model was explored by RNA sequencing. The pharmacological properties  of PRG-N-01 were analyzed through the preclinical study. RESULTS: PRG-N-01 binds to the N-terminal extremity of TGFβR1 (TβR1) kinase  domain, where TβR1 and RKIP interact, inhibiting the binding and preventing  degradation of RKIP. In vivo administration in the mouse model suppressed  schwannoma progression in the DRG. Early oral administration of the PRG-N-01  also demonstrated preventive effects on NF2-SWN. PRG-N-01 treatment suppressed  tumor growth genes while upregulating genes related to for normal cell  metabolism and Schwann cell differentiation in DRG. PRG-N-01 showed druggable  properties through the preclinical study, including ADME, pharmacodynamics,  pharmacokinetics, and toxicology. CONCLUSIONS: Together, our study provides the rationale and critical data for a  prospective clinical trial of PRG-N-01 in NF2-SWN patients indicating PRG-N-01  as a promising candidate for the treatment.  © The Author(s) 2024.

Author information: (1)Department of Burn and Plastic Surgery, Shandong Provincial Hospital, Cheeloo  College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250021, P.R. China. (2)Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Shanghai Ninth People's  Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200011,  P.R. China.  Plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) are benign tumors that affect 20‑50% of patients  with type I neurofibromatosis (NF1). PNF carries a risk of malignancy. There is  no effective cure for PNF. Its onset may be associated with genetic and  metabolic abnormalities, but the exact mechanisms remain unclear. Succinate‑CoA  ligase GDP/ADP‑Forming Subunit α(SUCLG1), a catalytic enzyme in the  tricarboxylic acid cycle, is highly expressed in PNF. The present study aimed to  explore the role of SUCLG1 in function and metabolism of PNF cells. SUCLG1  expression was verified using western blotting and immunofluorescence. After  inducing SUCLG1 knockdown and overexpression, functional changes in PNF cells  were assessed, as well as effects of SUCLG1 on cell respiration and glucose  metabolism. Quantitative PCR, WB, electron microscopy and Flow cytometry  demonstrated that SUCLG1 enhanced mitochondrial quality and promoted  mitochondrial fusion, thereby driving proliferation and migration of tumor  cells, inhibiting apoptosis and altering the cell cycle. A Seahorse assay showed  that elevated SUCLG1 expression enhanced cell aerobic respiration without  affecting the glycolytic process. This suggests that SUCLG1 upregulation in PNF  does not trigger the Warburg effect associated with malignant tumors. This study  also demonstrated the positive regulation of cellular function by promoting the  expression level of the SLC25A1 gene when SUCLG1 expression was elevated. In  conclusion, SUCLG1 altered the mechanism of mitochondrial quality control to  enhance cell aerobic respiration, thereby driving the pathogenesis of PNF. Thus,  SUCLG1 can serve as a potential target in future therapeutic strategies.

(#)Contributed equally  The MEK inhibitor selumetinib induces objective responses and provides clinical  benefit in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and inoperable plexiform  neurofibromas (PNs). To evaluate whether similar outcomes were possible in adult  patients, in whom PN growth is generally slower than in pediatric patients, we  conducted an open-label phase 2 study of selumetinib in adults with NF1 PNs. The  study was designed to evaluate objective response rate (primary objective),  tumor volumetric responses, patient-reported outcomes and pharmacodynamic  effects in PN biopsies. The objective response rate was 63.6% (21/33  participants). Median maximal PN volume decrease was 23.6% (range: -48.1% to  5.5%). No disease progression relative to baseline PN volumes occurred before  data cutoff, with a median of 28 cycles completed (range: 1-78, 28 d per cycle).  Participants experienced decreased tumor pain intensity and pain interference.  Adverse events (AEs) were similar to those of the pediatric trial; acneiform  rash was the most prevalent AE. Phosphorylation ratios of ERK1/2 decreased  significantly (ERK1 median change: -64.6% (range: -99.5% to 90.7%), ERK2 median  change: -57.3% (range: -99.9% to 84.4%)) in paired PN biopsies (P ≤ 0.001 for  both isoforms) without compensatory phosphorylation of AKT1/2/3. The sustained  PN volume decreases, associated improvement in pain and manageable AE profile  indicate that selumetinib provides benefit to adults with NF1 and inoperable  PNs.

(#)Contributed equally  PURPOSE: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is an aggressive  soft-tissue sarcoma that develops sporadically or in patients with  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Its development is marked by the inactivation of  specific tumor suppressor genes (TSG): NF1, CDKN2A, and SUZ12/EED (polycomb  repressor complex 2). Each TSG loss can be targeted by particular drug  inhibitors, and we aimed to systematically combine these inhibitors, guided by  TSG inactivation status, to test their precision medicine potential for MPNSTs. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We performed a high-throughput screening in 3 MPNST cell  lines testing 14 MEK inhibitors (MEKi), 11 cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6  inhibitors (CDKi), and 3 bromodomain inhibitors (BETi) as single agents and 147  pairwise co-treatments. Best combinations were validated in nine MPNST cell  lines, and three were tested in one sporadic and one NF1-associated  patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) MPNST mouse model. A final  combination of the three inhibitor classes was tested in the same PDOX models. RESULTS: A high degree of redundancy was observed in the effect of compounds of  the same inhibitory class, individually or in combination, and responses matched  with TSG inactivation status. The MEKi-BETi (ARRY-162 + I-BET151) co-treatment  triggered a reduction in half of the NF1-related MPNST PDOXs and all the  sporadic tumors, reaching 65% reduction in tumor volume in the latter.  Remarkably, this reduction was further increased in both models combining the  three inhibitor classes, reaching 85% shrinkage on average in the sporadic  MPNST. CONCLUSIONS: Our results strongly support precision therapies for MPNSTs guided  by TSG inactivation status. MEKi-BETi CDKi triple treatment elicits a  significant reduction of human MPNST PDOXs.  ©2024 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.

(#)Contributed equally  Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive sarcomas and  the primary cause of mortality in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).  These malignancies develop within preexisting benign lesions called plexiform  neurofibromas (PNs). PNs are solely driven by biallelic NF1 loss eliciting RAS  pathway activation, and they respond favorably to MEK inhibitor therapy. MPNSTs  harbor additional mutations and respond poorly to MEK inhibition. Our analysis  of genetically engineered and orthotopic patient-derived xenograft MPNST models  indicates that MEK inhibition has poor antitumor efficacy. By contrast, upstream  inhibition of RAS through the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 reduced  downstream signaling and suppressed NF1 MPNST growth, although resistance  eventually emerged. To investigate possible mechanisms of acquired resistance,  kinomic analyses of resistant tumors were performed, and data analysis  identified enrichment of activated autophagy pathway protein kinases. Combining  SHP2 inhibition with hydroxychloroquine (HQ) resulted in durable responses in  NF1 MPNSTs in both genetic and orthotopic xenograft mouse models. Our studies  could be rapidly translated into a clinical trial to evaluate SHP2 inhibition in  conjunction with HQ as a unique treatment approach for NF1 MPNSTs.

Author information: (1)Department of Medical Genetics, Life Sciences Institute, University of  British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.  ABSTRACT: NF1 encodes the multifunctional tumor suppressor protein,  neurofibromin, which is best known for its causative role in neurofibromatosis  type 1 and in regulating MAPK signaling. Neurofibromin, in a context-specific  manner, is involved in various tumorigenic processes, including those in  melanocytes. This study investigated whether NF1 loss can collaborate with  oncogenic GNAQ to promote melanoma in the dermis or eyes, in which the Gαq  pathway is almost always activated. We found that heterozygous 17q11.2 loss that  includes the NF1 locus is a recurrent phenomenon in human intradermal and uveal  melanomas described in the literature. We studied the effects of Nf1  haploinsufficiency in mice expressing oncogenic GNAQQ209L in melanocytes and  Schwann cells of peripheral nerves using the Plp1-creERT transgene with  tamoxifen at 5 weeks of age. Nf1 haploinsufficiency accelerated melanoma  formation and/or growth. RNA sequencing analysis found significant pathways  related to cAMP signaling and myogenesis. In addition, 20% of the differentially  expressed genes were homologous to genes for which expression correlates with  prognosis in human uveal melanoma. Unexpectedly, we found that GNAQQ209L alone  was sufficient to drive cutaneous nerve sheath tumors, with one  GNAQQ209L-expressing Nf1 haploinsufficient mouse also developing a plexiform  variant. These tumors strongly resembled neurofibromas. We searched the  cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics database and found plexiform neurofibromas with  the GNAQT96S hotspot mutation. The Plp1-creERT; GNAQQ209L model with tamoxifen  at 5 weeks may be useful as a preclinical model for neurofibroma. Our studies  emphasize the importance of GNAQ and NF1 in regulating neural crest–derived  cells existing in a dermal-like environment. SIGNIFICANCE: These results indicate that NF1 loss in intradermal and uveal  melanomas is a potentially significant finding. They emphasize the importance of  neurofibromin in cAMP signaling. They show for the first time that oncogenic  GNAQ can transform Schwann cells in mice. The Plp1-creERT transgene with  tamoxifen given at 5 weeks may be a particularly good strategy for modeling  cutaneous neurofibroma and plexiform neurofibroma.  ©2025 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.

To compare 1D (linear) tumor volume calculations and classification systems with  3D-segmented volumetric analysis (SVA), focusing specifically on their  effectiveness in the evaluation and management of NF2-associated vestibular  schwannomas (VS). VS were clinically followed every 6 months with cranial,  thin-sliced (< 3 mm) MRI. We retrospectively reviewed and used T1-weighted  post-contrast enhanced (gadolinium) images for both SVA and linear measurements.  3D-SVA was performed manually or combined with semiautomated segmentation by  using axial planes. The maximum linear dimensions (MLD) were determined in three  dimensions (anteroposterior, transverse, and craniocaudal planes) using axial  and coronal planes. The MLD was cubed (MLD3), and orthogonal analysis (OA) was  derived to establish comparability with the SVA. The Hannover and Koos  classification was used to depict the size ratio in each MRI and tumor. A linear  regression model was performed to compare 1D/classification systems to SVA, and  the percentage deviation change of MLD3 and OA to SVA was established using a  one-way multivariate variance analysis. 2586 SVA and 10344 linear measurements  were performed in a cohort of 149 NF2 patients and 292 associated VS. All  measurement techniques (MLD3, OA, KOOS, and Hannover) significantly (and  strongly, r2 > 0.5) correlated with SVA (p < 0.001). The OA showed an even  stronger positive correlation than the MLD3 to SVA. Smaller classified tumors  (T1/T2, K1/K2) exhibited a low-moderate positive correlation (r2 = 0.23-0.44)  compared to medium-sized (T3, K2/3) and large tumors (T4, K4; r2 = 0.54-0.76).  Pre- and postoperative MLD3 and OA statistically significantly predict SVA  (p < 0.001), but the postoperative correlation was weaker, particularly for MLD3  to SVA values. All analyses showed a large scatter range. In the percentage  deviation analysis of MLD3 and OA from SVA, small tumors (K1/K2, T1/T2) were  overestimated. Compared to the SVA, the MLD3 and especially the OA are a  time-saving alternative for monitoring the tumor volume of NF2-associated VS.  However, the scatter range in small/surgically reduced tumors is enormous. For  this reason, they are not recommended for monitoring off-label therapy with  Bevacizumab or for treatment decisions depending on a precise assessment of  tumor volume and growth. Developing deep learning-based volume determinations in  the future is essential to reduce SVA's time intensity.  © 2025. The Author(s).

(3)Head of the 3rd Neuropsychiatric Department of the Research Clinical  Institute of Childhood of the Moscow Region, Moscow, Russia.  WHAT IS THIS SUMMARY ABOUT? Neurofibromatosis type 1 (also called NF1) is a rare  genetic condition. It causes a range of symptoms that develop from childhood  onwards and worsen over time. Some children with NF1 develop non-cancerous nerve  tumors called plexiform neurofibromas. Plexiform neurofibromas can grow large  and compress nearby tissues. This can cause severe pain, reduced movement,  vision and hearing loss, and other medical problems. Some children can have  plexiform neurofibromas removed surgically. Most children have tumors that  cannot be removed by surgery (known as inoperable tumors). Children with  inoperable plexiform neurofibromas can receive a medicine called selumetinib.  This plain language summary includes important findings from two selumetinib  studies in children with NF1 and inoperable plexiform neurofibromas: The SPRINT  selumetinib studies are part of a clinical study program that looked at how well  selumetinib works in treating children with symptomatic, inoperable plexiform  neurofibromas. The SPRINT studies program included the first studies of this  medicine done in children, called phase 1 and phase 2 studies. For the phase 2  study, some children had severe symptoms and some children did not. The group of  children with severe symptoms is called group 1, and their results are included  in this summary. The researchers monitored the participating children for up to  5 years in a long-term study to better understand how the treatment works over  time. The NF1 caregivers experience study is a related study where caregivers  shared their experiences of caring for children with NF1and plexiform  neurofibromas. WHAT WERE THE RESULTS? A total of 74 children took part in the SPRINT phase 1  and phase 2 (group 1) study. Their ages ranged from 3 to 18.5 years, and their  average age was 10.3 years. After more than 4 years of treatment, around 70% of  the children (52 out of 74) had smaller tumors. For most children, the responses  lasted beyond 1 year. There was a significant and lasting reduction in the  intensity of the children';s tumor pain, noticeable as early as 2 months after  starting the treatment. After 12 months, children reported their pain dropped  from an average score of 2.2 to 0.6 and stayed low at 0.58 over 4 years. There  was also an improvement in how much their pain affected the children's ability  to do daily tasks. Some children had side effects related to selumetinib,  although these were generally manageable. Results from the NF1 caregivers  experience study showed caregivers of children with plexiform neurofibromas face  significant impacts in physical, psychological, economic, and social aspects.  These effects often result in a loss of productivity and difficulties with daily  activity. WHAT DO THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY MEAN? Children with NF1 who have symptomatic,  inoperable plexiform neurofibromas can benefit from selumetinib treatment.  Selumetinib is generally well-tolerated, but it is important to monitor side  effects during treatment. Caring for a child with NF1 and symptomatic,  inoperable plexiform neurofibromas has a significant impact on family members  and others providing daily care. This highlights the importance of improving  treatment and quality of life for both children with the condition and their  caregivers.

Li L(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Oncology, Zibo Municipal Hospital, Zibo, ShanDong, China.  BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a rare neurogenetic disorder with  limited treatment options. Selumetinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, has emerged as a  promising therapy for inoperable NF1-related plexiform neurofibromas. METHODS: Our retrospective pharmacovigilance study utilized the FDA Adverse  Event Reporting System (FAERS) to comprehensively evaluate Selumetinib's safety  profile in real-world settings. Data from the third quarter of 2020 to the  fourth quarter of 2023 were analyzed, identifying 498 adverse event reports with  Selumetinib as the primary suspect drug. RESULTS: Statistical analysis revealed disproportionate signals for skin and  subcutaneous tissue disorders, eye disorders, and various congenital, familial,  and genetic disorders. The most common adverse events were elevated blood  creatine phosphokinase, rash, and acneiform dermatitis. Notably, several adverse  events, including rhabdomyolysis, were identified but not listed on the  Selumetinib product label, based on a comparison with the FDA drug labeling. CONCLUSION: The study underscores the importance of early detection and  management of adverse reactions associated with Selumetinib, particularly within  the initial month of treatment. These findings provide valuable insights for  clinicians and regulators to ensure the safe and effective use of Selumetinib in  NF1 patients.  Copyright © 2025 Li.

Neurofibromin (NF1), a Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP), catalyzes  Ras-mediated GTP hydrolysis and thereby negatively regulates the Ras/MAPK  pathway. NF1 mutations can cause neurofibromatosis type 1 manifesting tumors,  and neurodevelopmental disorders. Exactly how the missense mutations in the  GAP-related domain of NF1 (NF1GRD) allosterically impact NF1 GAP to promote  these distinct pathologies is unclear. Especially tantalizing is the question of  how same-domain, same-residue NF1GRD variants exhibit distinct clinical  phenotypes. Guided by clinical data, we take up this dilemma. We sampled the  conformational ensembles of NF1GRD in complex with GTP-bound K-Ras4B by  performing molecular dynamics simulations. Our results show that mutations in  NF1GRD retain the active conformation of K-Ras4B but with biased propensities of  the catalytically competent populations of K-Ras4B-NF1GRD complex. In agreement  with clinical depiction and experimental tagging, compared to the wild type,  NF1GRD E1356A and E1356V mutants effectively act through loss-of-function and  gain-of-function mechanisms, leading to neurofibromatosis and developmental  disorders, respectively. Allosteric modulation of NF1GRD GAP activity through  biasing the conformational ensembles in the different states is further  demonstrated by the diminished GAP activity by NF1GRD isoform 2, further  manifesting propensities of conformational ensembles as powerful predictors of  protein function. Taken together, our work identifies a NF1GRD hotspot that  could allosterically tune GAP function, suggests targeting Ras oncogenic  mutations by restoring NF1 catalytic activity, and offers a molecular mechanism  for NF1 phenotypes determined by their distinct conformational propensities.  © 2025 The Author(s).

NF2-related schwannomatosis, previously known as neurofibromatosis type 2, is a  genetic disorder characterized by nerve tumors due to NF2 gene mutations. Mice  with Nf2 deletion develop schwannomas slowly with low penetrance, hence  inconvenient for preclinical studies. Here, we show that NF2, by recruiting E3  ubiquitin ligases β-TrCP1/2, promotes WWC1-3 ubiquitination and degradation. In  NF2 mutated cells, WWC1-3 accumulation is a compensatory mechanism to prevent  YAP/TAZ hyperactivation and rapid tumorigenesis. Accordingly, we generate a  synthetic mouse model with complete penetrance and short latency by concurrently  deleting Nf2 and Wwc1/2 in Schwann cells. This model closely resembles  NF2-related schwannomatosis in patients, as confirmed by histological and  single-cell transcriptome analysis. Moreover, a cell line from mouse schwannomas  and a syngeneic tumor model in immune-competent mice are established.  Furthermore, a screen using established models has identified candidate drugs  that effectively suppress schwannoma progression. Hence, this work has developed  rapid and transplantable models that will facilitate both basic and  translational research on NF2-related schwannomatosis.

BACKGROUND: Individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) frequently report  psychosocial problems, among which internalizing and externalizing symptoms are  the most poorly understood due to limited research and inconsistent evidence.  This hinders the overall attendance of their psychosocial needs and has a major  impact on their quality of life. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis  was conducted to synthesize existing findings on the degree to which individuals  with NF1 experience internalizing and externalizing symptoms, compared with the  unaffected population, and explore moderators of the group disparities. METHODS: Scopus, PsycINFO, Web of Science, PubMed, and ProQuest were searched  from inception to March 26th, 2024, which identified 59 eligible studies (N of  NF1 = 3182, mean ages 2.38 to 46.4 years). Hedges' g was calculated for  differences in internalizing and externalizing symptoms between the NF1 group  and the unaffected controls. Study effect sizes were pooled using robust  variance estimation and random-effects models. Moderators of group differences  were tested using meta-regression. RESULTS: Random-effects meta-analyses indicated that compared with unaffected  controls, individuals with NF1 showed more severe depressive (k = 21; g = 0.43;  95% CI [0.21, 0.65]), anxiety (k = 24; g = 0.27; 95% CI [0.01, 0.54]), somatic  (k = 27; g = 0.56; 95% CI [0.30, 0.83]), total internalizing (k = 75; g = 0.50;  95% CI [0.33, 0.67]), aggression (k = 33; g = 0.33; 95% CI [0.08, 0.58]),  delinquency, (k = 37; g = 0.43; 95% CI [0.26, 0.60]), and total externalizing  symptoms (k = 47; g = 0.24; 95% CI [0.13, 0.35]). Studies that included more  participants with NF1 who had ADHD or a lower verbal IQ reported greater group  disparities in total internalizing symptoms or aggression. CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight the importance of promptly recognizing  internalizing and externalizing symptoms in individuals with NF1 for timely  interventions. Future research should identify predictors of internalizing and  externalizing symptoms within the NF1 population to inform our knowledge and  intervention development. Other implications for future research were also  discussed. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: The study protocol of this meta-analysis was  registered at PROSPERO (CRD42023478258).  © 2025.

(3)Department of Neurology, School of Medicine, Washington University, Saint  Louis, MO 63110, United States.  OBJECTIVE: Dimensionality reduction techniques aim to enhance the performance of  machine learning (ML) models by reducing noise and mitigating overfitting. We  sought to compare the effect of different dimensionality reduction methods for  comorbidity features extracted from electronic health records (EHRs) on the  performance of ML models for predicting the development of various  sub-phenotypes in children with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). MATERIALS AND METHODS: EHR-derived data from pediatric subjects with a confirmed  clinical diagnosis of NF1 were used to create 10 unique comorbidities  code-derived feature sets by incorporating dimensionality reduction techniques  using raw International Classification of Diseases codes, Clinical  Classifications Software Refined, and Phecode mapping schemes. We compared the  performance of logistic regression, XGBoost, and random forest models utilizing  each feature set. RESULTS: XGBoost-based predictive models were most successful at predicting NF1  sub-phenotypes. Overall, features based on domain knowledge-informed mapping  schema performed better than unsupervised feature reduction methods. High-level  features exhibited the worst performance across models and outcomes, suggesting  excessive information loss with over-aggregation of features. DISCUSSION: Model performance is significantly impacted by dimensionality  reduction techniques and varies by specific ML algorithm and outcome being  predicted. Automated methods using existing knowledge and ontology databases can  effectively aggregate features extracted from EHRs. CONCLUSION: Dimensionality reduction through feature aggregation can enhance the  performance of ML models, particularly in high-dimensional datasets with small  sample sizes, commonly found in EHRs health applications. However, if not  carefully optimized, it can lead to information loss and data  oversimplification, potentially adversely affecting model performance.  © The Author(s) 2025.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a rare but aggressive  soft-tissue sarcoma characterized by poor response to therapy. The primary  treatment remains surgical resection with negative margins. Nonetheless, in the  setting of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), the five-year survival rate is at  20-50%, with recurrence occurring in up to 50% of individuals. For patients with  metastatic and unresectable disease, current treatment options include cytotoxic  chemotherapy, which offers minimal benefit, and most patients die within five  years of diagnosis. Despite advances in targeted therapy focusing on inhibiting  Ras signaling and its downstream effectors, clinical trials report minimal  clinical benefit, highlighting the need to explore alternative pathways in MPNST  pathogenesis. Here, we discuss the role of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, UBR5, in  cancer progression and immune modulation across various malignancies, including  breast, lung, and ovarian cancer. We focus on mechanisms by which UBR5  contributes to tumorigenesis, focusing on its influence on tumor  microenvironment and immune modulation. Additionally, we explore UBR5's roles in  normal tissue function, DNA damage response, metastasis, and therapeutic  resistance, illustrating its multifaceted contribution to cancer biology. We  discuss evidence implicating UBR5 in immune evasion and highlight its potential  as a therapeutic target to enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade  (ICB) therapy in MPNST, a tumor typically characterized by an immune cold  microenvironment. We outline current immune-based strategies and challenges in  MPNST management, ongoing efforts to shift the immune landscape in MPNST, and  ultimately, we suggest that targeting UBR5 could be a novel strategy to  potentiate ICB therapy-mediated anti-tumor immune response and clinical  outcomes, particularly in MPNST patients with inoperable or metastatic disease.

(#)Contributed equally  Deep-learning models have shown promise in differentiating between benign and  malignant lesions. Previous studies have primarily focused on specific  anatomical regions, overlooking tumors occurring throughout the body with highly  heterogeneous whole-body backgrounds. Using neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) as an  example, this study developed highly accurate MRI-based deep-learning models for  the early automated screening of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors  (MPNSTs) against complex whole-body background. In a Chinese seven-center  cohort, data from 347 subjects were analyzed. Our one-step model incorporated  normal tissue/organ labels to provide contextual information, offering a  solution for tumors with complex backgrounds. To address privacy concerns, we  utilized a lightweight deep neural network suitable for hospital deployment. The  final model achieved an accuracy of 85.71% for MPNST diagnosis in the validation  cohort and 84.75% accuracy in the independent test set, outperforming another  classic two-step model. This success suggests potential for AI models in  screening other whole-body primary/metastatic tumors.  © 2025. The Author(s).

Comment in     Neuro Oncol. 2025 Jul 30;27(6):1594-1596. doi: 10.1093/neuonc/noaf094.  BACKGROUND: The intestinal microbiota regulates normal brain physiology and the  pathogenesis of several neurological disorders. While prior studies suggested  that this operates through immune cells, the underlying mechanisms remain  unclear. Leveraging 2 well-characterized murine models of low-grade glioma  occurring in the setting of the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) cancer  predisposition syndrome, we sought to determine the impact of the gut microbiome  on optic glioma progression. METHODS: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (Nf1)-mutant mice genetically engineered to  develop optic pathway gliomas (Nf1OPG mice) by 3 months of age were reared under  germ-free (GF) conditions, treated with specific cocktails of antibiotics, or  given fecal matter transplants (FMTs). Intestinal microbial species were  identified by 16S genotyping. Neutralizing transforming growth factor-beta  (TGFβ) antibodies were delivered systemically, while in vitro experiments used  isolated murine microglia and T cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis was  performed using established methods. RESULTS: Nf1 OPG mice raised in a GF environment or postnatally treated with  vancomycin did not harbor optic gliomas or exhibit OPG-induced retinal nerve  fiber layer thinning, which was reversed following conventionally raised mouse  FMT or colonization with Bacteroides species. Moreover, this intestinal  microbiota-regulated gliomagenesis was mediated by circulating TGFβ, such that  systemic TGFβ neutralization reduced Nf1-OPG growth. TGFβ was shown to act on  tumor-associated monocytes to induce Ccl3 expression and recruit CD8+ T cells  necessary for glioma growth. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these findings establish, for the first time, a  mechanistic relationship between Bacteroides in the intestinal microbiome and  NF1-LGG pathobiology, suggesting both future predictive risk assessment  strategies and therapeutic opportunities.  © The Author(s) 2025.

For paediatric patients suffering from neurofibromatosis, Selumetinib (SEL) is  the only approved drug. Here an original ecofriendly and high pace method is  introduced using 96- microwell spectrophotometric assay (MW-SPA) to measure SEL  content in bulk and commercial pharmaceutical formulation (Koselugo® capsules).  This assay was relied on in-microwell formation of a coloured charge transfer  complex (CTC) upon interaction of SEL with  2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ). The complex was fully  characterized by spectrophotometric and computational studies. The CTC exhibited  an absorbance maximum (λmax) at 440 nm. The ease of reaction occurrence, complex  stability and its high absorptivity were proved by measuring its association  constant (0.63 × 102 L/ mol), standard free energy change (-10.31 KJ/mol), molar  absorptivity (ε) (3.78 × 103 L/mol/cm), and the SEL: DDQ stoichiometric ratio  (1:1). Establishments of the optimum values of the applied conditions in 96-well  assay plate were refined regarding DDQ concentration, reaction time,  temperature, and solvents. Validation of the assay was according to the ICH  guidelines. The assay was linear in SEL' concentrations ranged from 10 to  200 µg/well, with limits of detection and quantitation of 4.1 and 12.5 µg/well,  respectively. Then, the assay was efficaciously adapted to accurately and  precisely determine SEL content in bulk form and Koselugo® capsules. The assay  environmental safety was documented by three different comprehensive metric  tools. Additionally, assessment of the assay's rate demonstrated its high  throughput, enabling the processing of large number of samples in pharmaceutical  quality control laboratories. The successful development of this assay provides  a valuable fast and green analytical tool for ensuring the quality control of  SEL's bulk form and capsules.  © 2024. The Author(s).

In efforts to evaluate potential biomarkers and drug targets for  Neurofibromatosis Type I (NF1) we utilized affinity mass spectrometry and global  proteomics to investigate how variation within and loss of NF1 affect  immortalized human Schwann cells. We used Strep tagged mNf1 cDNAs (both wild  type (WT) and variant) to affinity purity NF1 Protein-Protein interactors (PPIs)  from the Schwann cells. We were able to identify 98 PPIs and show that some of  these PPIs bind differentially to variant proteins. Next, we evaluated global  proteomes. We identified over 1900 proteins in immortalized human Schwann cells  both with and without NF1 expression. We identified 148 proteins with  differential expression levels based on genotype. Following Ingenuity Pathway  analysis (IPA) we found multiple pathways were altered including decreases in  ""oxidative phosphorylation,"" increases in ""mitochondrial dysfunction"", and  ""glycolysis"", as well as changes in ""Myelination Signaling Pathway."" When we  evaluated the proteome of NF1 null cells stably transfected with tagged mNf1  cDNAs we again identified an overall trend of metabolic differences pertaining  to ""oxidative phosphorylation"", ""mitochondria dysfunction"", and ""glycolysis"" in  the variant cDNA expressing cells. We then validated differential expression of  the following proteins: LAMC1, CYB5R3, and SOD2 that are observed in the altered  pathways. Finally, consistent with our proteomics findings, we show that NF1 is  required to maintain mitochondrial respiratory function in Schwann cells by  stabilizing NADH-linked oxidative phosphorylation and electron transfer. Taken  together, these data indicate that NF1 plays a significant role in mitochondrial  metabolism that results in proteomic changes in Schwann cells and may serve as a  future drug target.  © 2025.

Vertebrate embryogenesis requires the precisely timed specification of 3 germ  cell layers- ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm- which give rise to tissues and  organs in the developing organism. The tumor suppressor gene NF2,  moesin-ezrin-radixin like (MERLIN) tumor suppressor (Nf2) is expressed in all 3  germ layers during mouse development and its homozygous deletion causes  embryonic lethality. People with heterozygous NF2 mutations typically develop  Schwann cell tumors, especially vestibular schwannoma, but the specific role of  NF2 in human embryonic development is unclear. Here, human induced pluripotent  stem cells (hiPSCs) are used to demonstrate that NF2 is essential for endoderm  specification and formation in humans. Although endoderm differentiation is not  impaired in hiPSCs with heterozygous NF2 mutation, NF2 knockout (NF2-/-)  abolished the capacity to form endoderm in vitro, confirmed by loss of  expression of endoderm-related genes and proteins, or teratomas in vivo. This  defect is mediated by the nuclear translocation of yes-associated protein 1  (YAP1), a transcription co-activator regulating lineage fate via the Hippo  pathway and subsequent YAP1-mediated shutdown of Activin/Nodal signaling.  Endoderm formation can be rescued via YAP1 knockdown or forced re-expression of  NF2 in NF2-/- cells. Taken together, the essential role of NF2 during endoderm  specification in human embryogenesis as a regulator of YAP1 is reported.  © 2025 The Author(s).

BACKGROUND: EQ-5D-Y is a pediatric preference-based health-related quality of  life (HRQL) measure that is recommended in health economic evaluation according  to China's guidelines. However, there is limited evidence regarding how the  EQ-5D-Y perform in patients with rare diseases in the country. Neurofibromatosis  type 1 (NF1) is a rare disease that affects the growth and development of  underage patients. This study aimed to examine the performance of EQ-5D-Y proxy  version among underage NF1 patients in China. METHODS: Data from a nationwide cross-sectional survey from Nov 2022 to Jan 2023  was used. A total of 154 caregivers for underage NF1 patients who completed the  EQ-5D-Y proxy version, PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales (PedsQL GCS) proxy  version, and Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI-22) were included. The performance of  the EQ-5D-Y was assessed by response pattern (ceiling and floor effects),  convergent validity against the PedsQL GCS, known-groups validity, and Shannon  (H') and Shannon evenness (J') indices. RESULT: Data from 154 caregivers were analyzed. The mean age of caregivers was  38.23 (6.02) years, and 78.57% of them were mothers of NF1 patients. The mean  age of NF1 patients was 8.38 (3.34) years, with 51.30% being females. The  ceiling effect of EQ-5D-Y was 30.52%, and floor effect was 0%. Moderate to  strong correlations were found between EQ-5D-Y and PedsQL GCS dimensions that  share similar constructs (rho - 0.42 to -0.60, all p values < 0.001). The  hypotheses of known-groups defined by different PedsQL GCS and ZBI scores were  validated. The EQ-5D-Y exhibited the strongest informativity and discriminatory  power of the ""feeling worried, sad or unhappy"" dimension and weakest for the  ""mobility"" dimension (H'(mobility) = 0.60, J'(mobility) = 0.38; H'(feeling  worried, sad or unhappy) = 1.23, J'(feeling worried, sad or unhappy) = 0.78). CONCLUSIONS: EQ-5D-Y is acceptable for measuring HRQL of underage NF1 patients  in China. More evidence for using EQ-5D-Y in rare diseases is awaited.  © 2025. The Author(s).

We aimed to characterize the structure and function of the early visual system  of the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) mouse model, a syndromic model of autism  spectrum disorders (ASD). We used Nf1+/- mice and WT littermates and performed  retinal structural analysis by optical coherence tomography (OCT), and  functional assessment by electrophysiological recordings. We then performed  behavioral visual tests using optomotor response (OMR) and sensitivity to visual  stimulus familiarity. From the structural analysis, we found increased thickness  for ganglion cell layer-inner plexiform layer (GCL-IPL) and outer nuclear layer  (ONL) in male Nf1+/- mice compared with WT littermates. Regarding retinal  electrophysiology, female Nf1+/- mice exhibited increased amplitudes for the  second oscillatory potential (OP2) compared with WT littermates. Nevertheless,  both Nf1+/- and WT mice presented normal visual acuity as measured by OMR and  were able to exhibit regular visual stimulus familiarity responses. While  structural sex-dependent changes are in line with previous results for brain  anatomic measures, the subtle sex-dependent changes in oscillatory activity may  relate to GABAergic neurotransmission changes found in NF1. Overall, these  structural and functional changes do not seem to translate into visual  behavioral alterations.  Copyright © 2025 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.

Genetic disorders such as neurofibromatosis type 1 (Nf1) increase vulnerability  to cognitive and behavioral disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder and  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Nf1 results from mutations in the  neurofibromin gene that can reduce levels of the neurofibromin protein. While  the mechanisms have yet to be fully elucidated, loss of Nf1 may alter neuronal  circuit activity leading to changes in behavior and susceptibility to cognitive  and behavioral comorbidities. Here we show that mutations decreasing Nf1  expression alter motor behaviors, impacting the patterning, prioritization, and  behavioral state dependence in a Drosophila model of Nf1. Loss of Nf1 increased  spontaneous grooming in male and female flies. This followed a nonlinear spatial  pattern, with Nf1 deficiency increasing grooming of certain body parts  differentially, including the abdomen, head, and wings. The increase in grooming  could be overridden by hunger in foraging animals, demonstrating that the Nf1  effect is plastic and internal state dependent. Stimulus-evoked grooming  patterns were altered as well, suggesting that hierarchical recruitment of  grooming command circuits was altered. Yet loss of Nf1 in sensory neurons and/or  grooming command neurons did not alter grooming frequency, suggesting that Nf1  affects grooming via higher-order circuit alterations. Changes in grooming  coincided with alterations in walking. Flies lacking Nf1 walked with increased  forward velocity on a spherical treadmill, yet there was no detectable change in  leg kinematics or gait. These results demonstrate that loss of Nf1 alters the  patterning and prioritization of repetitive behaviors, in a state-dependent  manner, without affecting low-level motor functions.

Linear and volumetric analysis are the typical methods to measure tumor size. 3D  volumetric analysis has risen in popularity; however, this is very time and  labor intensive limiting its implementation in clinical practice. This study  aims to show that an AI-led approach can shorten the length of time required to  conduct 3D volumetric analysis of VS tumors and improve image processing  accuracy. From Yale New Haven Hospital and public patient recruitment, 143 MRIs  were included in the ground truth dataset. To create the tumor models for the  ground truth dataset, an image processing software (Simpleware ScanIP, Synopsys)  was used. The helper (DPP V1.0) was trained using proprietary AI- and ML-based  algorithms and information. A proof-of-concept AI model achieved a mean DICE  score of 0.76 (standard deviation 0.21). After the final testing stage, the  model improved to a final mean DICE score of 0.88 (range 0.74-0.93, standard  deviation 0.04). Our study has demonstrated an efficient, accurate AI for 3D  volumetric analysis of vestibular schwannomas. The use of this AI will enable  faster 3D volumetric analysis compared to manual segmentation. Additionally, the  overlay function would allow visualization of growth patterns. The tool will be  a method of assessing tumor growth and allow clinicians to make more informed  decisions.  © 2025. The Author(s).

INTRODUCTION: Neurofibromatosis type 2 (Nf2) gene inactivation is common in  sporadic and Nf2-related meningioma. There is currently scant literature  describing the development of an intracranial meningioma model in animals. Given  the role of Nf2 and other gene inactivation in meningeal cells, we used Cas9  mice here as the background host to establish a new animal model of skull base  meningioma in this study. AIMS: Cas9 transgenic mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory and raised in  our institution. Subsequently, meningeal cells were obtained from the Cas9  transgenic mice, cultured in medium, and passaged in vitro. We then prepared  lentivirus vector pLentiCre/gRNA, which could express the elements blocking the  function of four genes: Nf2, P15Ink4b, P16Ink4a, and P19Arf. We infected the  meningeal cells with the lentivirus vector pLentiCre/gRNA and tested the  expression of these four genes in those infected meningeal cells. Next,  adeno-associated virus vector pAAVCre/gRNA was injected in vivo into the skull  base meningeal cells of the neonate Cas9 transgenic mice. These mice were  observed once a week and killed 10 months later for brain inspection and  pathological analysis. RESULTS: Twenty Cas9 transgenic mice were successfully bred. Five mice were  killed so that meningeal cells could be extracted, cultured, and infected with  the lentivirus vector pLentiCre/gRNA for 72 h in vitro. The gene function test  showed that Nf2, P15Ink4b, P16Ink4a, and P19Arf were all blocked in the infected  meningeal cells, which indicated that the lentivirus vector pLentiCre/gRNA could  effectively block the expression of the four genes in targeted cells. Then  pAAVCre/gRNA was injected into the skull base meningeal cells of 15 mice  in vivo, and nine mice were observed for 10 months so that the intracranial  tumor growth could be assessed. Among these nine mice, pathological analysis  showed that six mice had benign meningioma subtypes similar to human meningioma,  one mouse had atypical meningioma, one mouse had malignant meningioma, and one  mouse had sarcoma. CONCLUSIONS: The Cas9 mouse model of skull base meningioma generated with the  Nf2 genetic defect and the combinational loss of P15Ink4b, P16Ink4a, and P19Arf  could provide a new tool for investigating the pathogenesis of meningioma and  the development of chemical interventions for this disease.  © 2025 The Author(s).

(#)Contributed equally  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and schwannomatosis (SWN) are rare genetic  disorders with distinct genetic etiologies. Both syndromes are predominantly  characterized by the development of multiple benign nerve sheath tumors, which  typically arise from cranial/peripheral nerves. The management of  NF1/SWN-associated benign nerve sheath tumors pose a substantial clinical  challenge. In recent years, immunotherapy has demonstrated significant efficacy  in treating various tumors, but its application to NF1/SWN has not been  explored. In this study, we first evaluated the feasibility of chimeric antigen  receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy for the treatment of benign NF1/SWN-related nerve  sheath tumor by analyzing the expression of multiple antigens in 85 tumor  samples. Our findings revealed that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/HER1)  was highly expressed in most samples, indicating its potential as an ideal  target for CAR-T cell therapy. Additionally, TGFβ1 and PDL1, key inhibitory  regulators of T cell function within solid tumor microenvironment (TME), were  universally overexpressed in these samples, highlighting the immunosuppressive  nature of NF1/SWN tumors. To target HER1, we constructed CARs using three  distinct scFvs (806, E2 and NEC). All three types of CAR-T cells demonstrated  significant tumor-eliminating capability against NF1/SWN tumor cell lines, with  806 CAR-T cells showing the highest efficacy. Considering the immunosuppressive  TME, we knocked out TGFBR2 and/or PDCD1 in 806 CAR-T cells using CRISPR/Cas9.  Their anti-tumor efficacy was further evaluated using a 3D tumor spheroid model,  and the gene-edited 806 CAR-T cells exhibited superior anti-tumor efficacy. In  conclusion, we identified HER1 as a target for CAR-T cell therapy in  NF1/SWN-related nerve sheath tumors, and developed anti-HER1 CAR-T cells that  effectively eliminated NF1/SWN tumor cells, providing a promising therapeutic  strategy for patients with these conditions.  © 2025.

Erratum in     G3 (Bethesda). 2025 Nov 12;15(11):jkaf211. doi: 10.1093/g3journal/jkaf211.  Porcine biomedical models have emerged as valuable tools in biomedical research  due to their physiological, anatomical, metabolic, immunological, and genetic  similarities to humans. As a result, they offer greater relevance for  translational studies than rodent models. Moreover, compared to nonhuman  primates, porcine models are more cost-effective, easier to manipulate  genetically, and raise fewer ethical concerns. However, the conventional breeds  of swine most commonly used in research have rapid growth rates, which lead to  logistical challenges such as increased space requirements, making them  impractical as biomedical models. The Wisconsin Miniature SwineTM (WMSTM) was  developed to address these shortcomings. The WMSTM porcine model grows slower,  reaching and maintaining human sizes at adulthood. The model was also  specifically designed to possess more human-like physiology that allows for easy  modeling of comorbidities like obesity and metabolic syndrome that affect a  large portion of the human population affected by chronic diseases. Thus, WMS™  is an ideal porcine gene editing platform for modeling complex multifactorial  diseases. Here, we present the first draft genome assembly representative of the  WMSTM line. The primary assembly was generated with ∼20× coverage of long reads  from Oxford Nanopore Technologies and independently error-corrected using 23×  Pacific Biosciences reads. Arima Genomics Hi-C data were used to improve  contiguity. Largely congruent with the existing Sus scrofa genome, we also show  the utility of WMSTM as a model through comparisons between 2 WMSTM genes and  human homologs. Finally, we show the utility of genotyping by sequencing across  WMSTM herds. The WMSTM genome generated here is highly complete and supports  investigators utilizing WMSTM in biomedical research.  © The Author(s) 2025.

(#)Contributed equally  BACKGROUND: Schwannomas are nerve sheath tumors arising at cranial and  peripheral nerves, either sporadically or in patients with a  schwannomatosis-predisposition syndrome. There is limited understanding of the  transcriptional heterogeneity of schwannomas across genetic backgrounds and  anatomic locations. METHODS: Here, we prospectively profile by single-cell full-length  transcriptomics tumors from 22 patients with NF2-related schwannomatosis,  non-NF2-related schwannomatosis, and sporadic schwannomas, resected from cranial  and peripheral nerves. We profiled 11,373 cells (after QC), including neoplastic  cells, fibroblasts, T cells, endothelial cells, myeloid cells, and pericytes. RESULTS: We characterize the intra-tumoral genetic and transcriptional  heterogeneity of schwannoma, identifying six distinct transcriptional  metaprograms, with gene signatures related to stress, myelin production, antigen  presentation, interferon signaling, glycolysis, and extracellular matrix. We  demonstrate the robustness of our findings with analysis of an independent  cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our atlas describes the spectrum of gene expression across  schwannoma entities at the single-cell level and will serve as an important  resource for the community.  © 2025.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and Legius syndrome (LS) are caused by  inactivating variants in NF1 and SPRED1. NF1 encodes neurofibromin (NF), a  GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for RAS that interacts with the SPRED1 product,  Sprouty-related protein with an EVH (Ena/Vasp homology) domain 1 (SPRED1).  Obtaining a clinical and molecular diagnosis of NF1 or LS can be challenging due  to the phenotypic diversity, the size and complexity of the NF1 and SPRED1 loci,  and uncertainty over the effects of some NF1 and SPRED1 variants on pre-mRNA  splicing and/or protein expression and function. To improve NF1 and SPRED1  variant classification and establish pathogenicity for NF1 and SPRED1 variants  identified in individuals with NF1 or LS, we analyzed patient RNA by RT-PCR and  performed in vitro exon trap experiments and estimated NF and SPRED1 protein  expression, RAS GAP activity, and interaction. We obtained evidence to support  pathogenicity according to American College of Medical Genetics guidelines for  73/114 variants tested, demonstrating the utility of functional approaches for  NF1 and SPRED1 variant classification and NF and LS diagnostics.

Introduction: Sleep is a fundamental biological function critical for physical  and mental health. Chronic sleep disturbances can significantly impair  cognitive, emotional, and social functioning, leading to deficits in attention,  alertness, and executive function, alongside increased irritability, anxiety,  and depression. For pediatric patients, such disturbances pose additional  concerns, potentially disrupting developmental processes and quality of life for  both children and their families. Objectives: Emerging evidence suggests a  correlation between neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and an increased prevalence  of sleep disorders in children. NF1, a genetic condition affecting multiple body  systems, including the nervous system, may predispose children to sleep  disturbances due to its neurodevelopmental and behavioral impacts. This  observational case-control study aimed to explore the association between NF1  and sleep disorders in pediatric patients, comparing the prevalence and patterns  of sleep disturbances between NF1 patients and healthy controls. Patients and  Methods: The study included 100 children aged 2-12 years, divided into two  groups: 50 with NF1 (case group) and 50 children belonging to the control group.  NF1 patients were recruited from the Unit of Rare Diseases of the Nervous System  in Childhood at the Policlinico ""G. Rodolico-San Marco"" University Hospital in  Catania. Data were collected using a questionnaire completed by parents,  assessing parasomnias, breathing-related sleep disorders, and other behavioral  and physiological disturbances; these data were compared to a sleep assessment  performed using an Apple Watch Ultra. Results: NF1 patients exhibited a  significantly higher prevalence of sleep disorders than controls. Notable  differences included increased nocturnal hyperhidrosis (48% vs. 10%), bruxism  (48% vs. 28%), restless legs syndrome (22% vs. 4%), frequent nighttime  awakenings (22% vs. 8%), and sleep paralysis (12% vs. 0%). A finding of poorer  sleep quality also emerged from the results of sleep analysis using an Apple  Watch Ultra. Conclusions: These findings confirm an elevated risk of sleep  disorders in children with NF1, emphasizing the importance of early  identification and management to improve quality of life and mitigate cognitive  and behavioral impacts. Further research is essential to understand the  mechanisms underlying these associations and develop targeted interventions for  this population.

(#)Contributed equally  BACKGROUND: Pain is a common symptom in individuals with neurofibromatosis type  1 (NF1) that often is associated with plexiform neurofibroma (pNF) tumors. To  date, no patient-reported outcome measures have been validated specifically to  assess pNF-related pain intensity or pain interference in this population. Such  measures are sorely needed since pain is being considered as an outcome in  clinical trials targeting reduction of pNF. The study aims were to: (1) obtain  qualitative information from individuals with NF1 and pNFs about their pain and  its measurement and (2) modify existing scales to assess pNF-related pain  intensity and pain interference for NF1 clinical trials. METHODS: For this multi-site, qualitative study, 56 individuals (26 children,  6-16 years; 30 adults, 18-68 years) with NF1 and pNF participated in a focus  group and/or individual interview about pain intensity and pain interference  (concept elicitation) and also provided feedback about existing pain measures  (Numeric Rating Scale-11 and Pain Interference Index) assessing these domains  (cognitive debriefing). Four additional waves of cognitive debriefing interviews  further refined the measures. Qualitative concept elicitation data from  transcripts were coded, analyzed using NVivo software, and thematic analysis was  conducted using both deductive and inductive techniques. Additional themes and  systematic problems and suggestions regarding the measures were gleaned from  reviewing the field notes and interview transcriptions generated by the  cognitive debriefing sessions. RESULTS: Concept elicitation themes included descriptions of two types of  pNF-related pain (chronic and episodic), variability of pain over time, varying  ability to recall pain, lack of knowledge of pNFs, and the ways pain interferes  with daily activities. Cognitive debriefing themes included information on how  to rate pNF-related pain intensity apart from other pain; problems and  suggestions regarding the measures included difficulty comprehending some items  and preferences for alternative wording and formatting. Based on these  qualitative results, the measures' instructions, items, and formatting were  modified to create the PAin INtensity Scale for plexiform neurofibromas  (PAINS-pNF) and the Pain Interference Index for plexiform neurofibromas  (PII-pNF) for administration on a mobile app or web-based platform. CONCLUSIONS: The PAINS-pNF and PII-pNF are promising self-report measures  developed using patient engagement to evaluate tumor pain intensity and pain  interference in NF1 clinical trials. The second phase of the study to provide  reliability, validity, and normative data for individuals with NF1 and pNFs ages  8 years and older is underway.  © 2025.

Objective Meningiomas commonly recur following gross total resection (GTR), and  the risk of recurrence is difficult to predict using current classification  schemes such as the World Health Organization (WHO) tumor grade. This study  aimed to create a predictive model of recurrence risk following GTR of WHO grade  1 meningiomas based on histopathological and epidemiological factors.  Methods A  retrospective chart review was completed for all patients at our institution who  underwent their first surgery for a WHO grade 1 meningioma between 2017 and  2022. Those with genetic predispositions, such as neurofibromatosis type 2, were  excluded. Baseline characteristics, including histopathology findings, were  obtained, and we used a Risk-calibrated Superspase Linear Integer Model  (Risk-SLIM) with a five-fold cross-validation (CV) to create a predictive model  of recurrence over an average follow-up of three years.  Results Univariate  analysis of our selected variables revealed a significant predictive association  between WHO grade 1 meningioma recurrence and subtotal resection but not with  any other variable. However, the meningioma recurrence score (MRS) generated by  our machine learning algorithm revealed multiple predictive factors of  recurrence, including age, female gender, and various histopathologic features,  including the Ki-67/MIB-1 index. Conclusions Machine learning algorithms like  the one we present here may help identify patients at high risk of recurrence of  their WHO grade 1 meningioma, and they are more likely to benefit from closer  postoperative surveillance or adjuvant treatment, even when GTR is achieved.

BACKGROUND: Cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs) are the hallmark of the  tumor-predisposition syndrome neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1). While cNFs are always  benign, they markedly decrease quality of life in individuals with NF1.  Understanding the differences between cNFs and the skin is essential for  developing treatments for cNFs. METHODS: We collected 15 cNFs from four NF1 individuals and used mass  spectrometry to compare the tumor tissue with the skin overlying each tumor.  Data were analyzed based on Gene Ontology (GO) terms. RESULTS: The expression patterns of the Schwann cell marker S100B and several  keratins confirmed successful dissection of cNF tissue from the overlying skin.  Hierarchical clustering showed extensive overlap between the tumor and skin  samples in three out of four individuals, suggesting high overall similarity  between the two tissue types. Based on the analysis of the GO terms, cNFs were  associated with decreased expression of proteins related to cell proliferation,  extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis and cellular metabolism. CONCLUSION: The cNFs are relatively quiescent, consistent with their benign  nature and limited growth potential. The development of pharmacological therapy  for cNFs requires overcoming the high similarity between cNFs and the overlying  skin. The present dataset can serve as a resource for future research on cNFs.  © 2025. The Author(s).

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder characterised  by skin and nervous system anomalies, primarily involving glial cells and nerve  tumours. Pain, particularly chronic pain, is a significant but often overlooked  symptom in NF1 patients, affecting their health-related quality of life. The  dorsal root ganglion (DRG) is essential for pain signal transmission, yet in  vivo studies of DRG in NF1 patients are lacking. METHODS: This prospective study included 20 NF1 patients (8 with neuropathic  pain) and 28 healthy controls. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of  lumbosacral DRG (L5 + S1) were performed using a 3-T scanner. Quantitative MRI  techniques were applied to assess DRG volume, T2 relaxation time, and proton  density (PD). Statistical analyses compared NF1 patients and controls, and NF1  patients with and without pain. RESULTS: NF1 patients had a significantly larger DRG volume and higher  quantitative T2 and PD values compared to controls. Furthermore, DRG PD was  significantly higher in NF1 patients with neuropathic pain than in those without  pain. Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis identified DRG PD as the  best discriminator of pain in NF1 patients, with an area under the curve of  0.84, indicating relevant and useful discriminatory power. CONCLUSION: NF1 patients showed objective macrostructural and microstructural  DRG injury changes using dedicated DRG MRI, discriminating neuropathic pain  status from non-pain status at the disease-symptom group level. These findings  highlight the potential of DRG MRI to quantify DRG pathology in vivo and to  determine the risk of functional pain status by imaging. RELEVANCE STATEMENT: The identification of structural and microstructural  changes of the DRG by quantitative MRI provides a novel in vivo biomarker for  understanding neuropathic pain mechanisms, pain risk assessment and treatment  monitoring in NF1. KEY POINTS: Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in NF1 are enlarged by 176.3% in MRI. In  quantitative MRI of DRG NF1, T2 relaxation time is increased by 22.9% and PD by  8.4%. DRG PD can distinguish a painful from a non-painful NF1 phenotype.  © 2025. The Author(s).

Alrubia S(1), Alshehri WA(1), Alzoman NZ(1), Darwish IA(1).  Author information: (1)1Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy King Saud  University, Riyadh Saudi Arabia.  Selumetinib (SEL) is a recently approved medication for paediatric patients who  have neurofibromatosis type 1. It is the first approved therapy for this rare,  debilitating, and disfiguring disease. Development of proper analytical  platforms for SEL analysis in its marketed pharmaceutical formulation (Koselugo®  capsules) and blood plasma is highly warranted. Availability of such analytical  tools would ensure SEL capsules' quality and effective therapy. This study  introduces, for the first time, the development of two label-free and sensitive  platforms for SEL quantification in capsules and human plasma. These platforms  are microwave-assisted with an ultraviolet absorbance microplate reader (MW-UV)  and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with a photodiode-array  detector (HPLC-PDA). Both platforms employed the SEL native UV absorption as an  analytical signal. The MW-UV measured the UV absorption in 96-well transparent  plates at 255 nm. The HPLC-PDA involved chromatographic separation of SEL and  tozasertib (TOZ), internal standard, on a C18 column both were detected at 255  nm. The optimum procedures of both platforms were established and validated  following the ICH guidelines. The linearity ranges were 15-500 µg mL-1 and  0.8-100 µg mL-1, with limits of quantification of 15.3 and 3.5 µg mL-1, for  MW-UV and HPLC-PDA, resp. Both platforms displayed high precision with relative  standard deviation values ≤ 1.8 %, and high accuracy with recovery ranging from  98.3 to 102.3 %. The platforms were successfully applied to quantify SEL in bulk  form, Koselugo® capsules, and were preliminarily applied to human plasma  analysis. Eco-friendliness assessment confirmed the adherence of both platforms  to green analytical approaches. MW-UV and HPLC-PDA are simple and fast, enabling  high-throughput analysis, thus introducing valuable tools for routine use in  quality control and clinical laboratories for SEL quantification.  © 2025 Sarah Alrubia et al.

One of the hallmarks of cancer cells is their failure to respond to the cellular  mechanism of apoptosis. The B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) family of proteins  regulate apoptosis. Their ability to do so can be measured using several methods  that in turn anticipate the fate of the cancer cell in response to  apoptosis-inducing treatment. These assays ultimately identify the readiness of  the cancer cell to undergo apoptosis, which is referred to as the mitochondrial  priming state. These metrics, however, have been challenging to implement in the  clinic. Methods: Here, we describe a unique method that relies on a panel of  novel conformation-specific antibodies (termed PRIMAB) that can directly measure  the mitochondrial priming state. These reagents are highly specific for  complexes of their corresponding pro-survival protein interactions with the  pro-apoptotic protein BIM. These BIM-containing heterodimeric complexes have  long been established as hallmarks of primed cancer cells. Results: Using  clinically amenable assay formats, PRIMABs were shown to detect the presence of  these anti-apoptotic-pro-apoptotic complexes and their disruption by BH3-mimetic  drugs. Moreover, PRIMABs were able to detect a shift in priming status following  BH3-mimetic treatment, a factor associated with resistance to these drugs. In a  panel of AML patient samples, we report a wide range of priming levels for each  PRIMAB complex, demonstrating the potential for heterogeneity in responses. We  also show that PRIMABs could be predictive of outcomes for AML patients  following cytarabine-based treatment. Conclusions: PRIMABs provide novel and  useful tools for cancer research and for clinical implementation as reagents  providing predictive tests for treatment response.

Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 develop multiple cutaneous neurofibromas  (cNFs) for which no effective drug therapy exists; mainstay treatment remains  physical removal. However, clinical trials testing new drugs are ongoing, and  quantitative techniques based on cNF biology are needed to measure changes in  cNF after treatment. cNF tumor bulk is composed of extracellular matrix and  inflammatory cells that dictate their stiffness. No studies have reported  measuring the stiffness change in neurofibromas, which would indicate shrinking  of the tumor bulk. The goal of this study was to evaluate 2 different  instruments-the Rex Gauge durometer (denoted as REX) and the Delfin  SkinFibroMeter (denoted as DELFIN)-in reproducibly measuring cNF stiffness.  Ninety-seven neurofibromas from patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 on  different skin areas were measured at each of 2 visits about 2 weeks apart. The  DELFIN had moderate within-tumor agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient =  0.607, 95% confidence interval = 0.512-0.691) and moderate within-visit  agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.732, 95% confidence interval =  0.665-0.786), and the REX had moderate within-tumor agreement (intraclass  correlation coefficient = 0.740, 95% confidence interval = 0.631-0.816) and  excellent within-visit agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.937,  95% confidence interval = 0.913-0.953), while accounting for repeated visits and  tumor measurements clustered within each patient. We found that both the DELFIN  and REX are easy to use and reliable, providing consistent quantification of cNF  stiffness.  © 2025 The Authors.

Background/Objectives: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a prevalent inherited  disorder, with approximately 50% of affected individuals developing plexiform  neurofibromas (PNFs), which can progress to highly aggressive malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). While selumetinib is FDA-approved for  PNFs, its efficacy in MPNSTs is limited and associated with dose-limiting  toxicities. NF1 deficiency drives tumorigenesis and alters immune dynamics via  RAS hyperactivation. Given the substantial macrophage infiltration in NF1  lesions and its association with disease progression, we hypothesized that  targeting tumor-promoting immune cells with the retinoid X receptor (RXR)  agonist MSU-42011 could be an alternative therapeutic strategy, as it has shown  promise in KRAS-driven cancers by decreasing pERK levels and reducing  tumor-promoting immune cells. Methods: We examined the effects of MSU-42011 and  selumetinib, alone and in combination, on NF1-deficient cells and in a syngeneic  MPNST model. Results: In vivo, the combination of MSU-42011 and selumetinib  significantly reduced tumor growth, pERK levels, and tumor-promoting macrophages  and increased activated CD8+ T cells in syngeneic MPNST models. In NF1-deficient  cells, MSU-42011 or selumetinib reduced pERK levels, with combination treatment  achieving greater reductions. Conditioned media (CM) from NF1-deficient cells  increased the protein and mRNA levels of several cytokines and chemokines in  human THP1 cells and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). MSU-42011 and  selumetinib, alone or in combination, partially reversed this induction.  Conclusions: These findings suggest RXR agonists may have therapeutic potential  against NF1, and their combination with MEK inhibitors could represent a  promising strategy for NF1-associated tumors. Further studies are needed to  validate these results and assess their translational relevance.

The NF1 tumor suppressor gene is recurrently mutated in human cancers and is  associated with the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) cancer predisposition  syndrome. NF1 encodes neurofibromin, a Ras guanosine triphosphate (GTPase)  activating protein that negatively regulates Ras signaling. NF1 mutation  accordingly leads to Ras misactivation and downstream activation of RAF/MEK/ERK  signaling, leading to the approval of the MEK inhibitor selumetinib for NF-1  associated peripheral nervous system (PNS) tumors. However, how NF1 loss  modifies response to selumetinib and the utility of targeting additional  upstream inputs or downstream outputs of Ras these tumors remain unclear. Here,  we perform RNA-sequencing, phosphoproteomic, pharmacologic, and proximal  proteomic analysis across a panel of CRISPR interference immortalized peripheral  nerve (iPN) cells to systematically dissect the function of neurofibromin loss.  Small guide NF1 (sgNF1) repression is sufficient to increase Ras GTP levels and  alter gene expression to promote cell proliferation and dedifferentiation, with  sgNF1 iPNs showing decreased sensitivity to selumetinib due to altered feedback  regulation to Ras/RAF/MEK/ERK. Upstream small guide PTPN11 (sgPTPN11) repression  leads to the inverse gene expression signature, decreasing cell proliferation  and promoting differentiation, and sgPTPN11 iPNs are more sensitive to  selumetinib. However, upstream sonof sevenless 1 inhibition shows limited  efficacy in iPNs due to compensation by SOS2. Finally, proximal proteomics  reveals Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (KRAS), but not Harvey rat sarcoma virus  (HRAS) or neuroblastoma Ras viral oncogene homolog (NRAS), associates with  neurofibromin in iPN cells, and pan-KRAS inhibition is sufficient to block ERK  activation and CDK1/2 activation in NF1 mutant cells, suggesting blocking KRAS  may be a therapeutic approach for NF1 mutant PNS tumors.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations of the  NF1 tumor suppressor gene resulting in the loss of function of neurofibromin, a  GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Ras. While the malignant manifestations of  NF1 are associated with loss of heterozygosity of the residual WT allele, the  nonmalignant neurodevelopmental sequelae, including autism spectrum disorder  (ASD) and/or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are prevalent  morbidities that occur in the setting of neurofibromin haploinsufficiency. We  reasoned that augmenting endogenous levels of WT neurofibromin could serve as a  potential therapeutic strategy to correct the neurodevelopmental manifestations  of NF1. Here, we used a combination of genetic screening and genetically  engineered murine models to identify a role for the F-box protein FBXW11 as a  regulator of neurofibromin degradation. Disruption of Fbxw11, through germline  mutation or targeted genetic manipulation in the nucleus accumbens, increased  neurofibromin levels, suppressed Ras-dependent ERK phosphorylation, and  corrected social learning deficits and impulsive behaviors in male Nf1+/- mice.  Our results demonstrate that preventing the degradation of neurofibromin is a  feasible and effective approach to ameliorate the neurodevelopmental phenotypes  in a haploinsufficient disease model.

BACKGROUND: Accurate monitoring of tumor progression is crucial for optimizing  outcomes in neurofibromatosis type 2-related schwannomatosis. Standard 2D linear  analysis on magnetic resonance imaging is less accurate than 3D volumetric  analysis, but since 3D volumetric analysis is time-consuming, it is not widely  used. To shorten the time required for 3D volumetric analysis, our lab has been  developing an automated artificial intelligence-driven 3D volumetric tool. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to survey and interview clinicians  treating neurofibromatosis type 2-related schwannomatosis to understand their  views on current 2D analysis and to gather insights for the design of an  artificial intelligence-driven 3D volumetric analysis tool. METHODS: Interviews examined for the following themes: (1) shortcomings of the  currently used linear analysis, (2) utility of 3D visualizations, (3) features  of an interactive 3D modeling software, and (4) lack of a gold standard to  assess the accuracy of 3D volumetric analysis. A Likert scale questionnaire was  used to survey clinicians' levels of agreement with 25 statements related to 2D  and 3D tumor analyses. RESULTS: A total of 14 clinicians completed a survey, and 12 clinicians were  interviewed. Specialties ranged across neurosurgery, neuroradiology, neurology,  oncology, and pediatrics. Overall, clinicians expressed concerns with current  linear techniques, with clinicians agreeing that linear measurements can be  variable with the possibility of two different clinicians calculating 2  different tumor sizes (mean 4.64, SD 0.49) and that volumetric measurements  would be more helpful for determining clearer thresholds of tumor growth (mean  4.50, SD 0.52). For statements discussing the capabilities of a 3D volumetric  analysis and visualization software, clinicians expressed strong interest in  being able to visualize tumors with respect to critical brain structures (mean  4.36, SD 0.74) and in forecasting tumor growth (mean 4.77, SD 0.44). CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians were overall in favor of the adoption of 3D volumetric  analysis techniques for measuring vestibular schwannoma tumors but expressed  concerns regarding the novelty and inexperience surrounding these techniques.  However, clinicians felt that the ability to visualize tumors with reference to  critical structures, to overlay structures, to interact with 3D models, and to  visualize areas of slow versus rapid growth in 3D would be valuable  contributions to clinical practice. Overall, clinicians provided valuable  insights for designing a 3D volumetric analysis tool for vestibular schwannoma  tumor growth. These findings may also apply to other central nervous system  tumors, offering broader utility in tumor growth assessments.  © Shelby T Desroches, Alice Huang, Rithvik Ghankot, Steven M Tommasini, Daniel H  Wiznia, Frank D Buono.

OBJECTIVE: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a neurocutaneous genetic disorder  caused by dominant mutations in the NF1 gene and characterized by increased  susceptibility to develop benign and malignant tumors. The type of NF1 mutation,  the expression of gene modifiers as well as epigenetic factors correlate with  the clinical heterogeneity. In this regard microRNAs (miRNAs) play a role in  post-transcriptional gene regulation. Compelling evidence shows that circulating  miRNAs mirror pathophysiological conditions, thus emerging as potential  biomarkers for human diseases. To date, the role of circulating miRNAs in NF1  has been poorly investigated. We aimed to study serum miRNA profiling as novel  non-invasive diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for NF1 disease. METHODS: The profile of circulating miRNAs in a monocentric cohort of 126 NF1  patients was carried out by a pooling approach of small non-coding RNA  sequencing and validation analysis by Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR. RESULTS: sncRNA-seq analysis of pooled serum samples identified 87  differentially expressed miRNAs in NF1 patients compared to healthy controls.  qRT-PCR validation confirmed a distinctive circulating miRNA signature in NF1,  with significant upregulation of miR-100-5p, miR-16-2-3p, miR-4508, and  miR-885-5p and downregulation of miR-107 and miR-4433b-5p. Hierarchical  clustering based on these six miRNAs effectively discriminated NF1 subjects from  controls, and network analysis revealed their involvement in key cancer-related  pathways, including ERK/MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and mTOR signaling. INTERPRETATION: Our study identified a distinct circulating miRNA signature of  six miRNAs that reliably differentiates NF1 patients from non-affected  individuals. These miRNAs are implicated in regulating NF1 downstream pathways  and signaling processes involved in tumorigenesis.  Copyright © 2025 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

INTRODUCTION: Neurofibromatosis type 2 related Schwannomatosis (NF2-SWN) is a  genetic disorder characterized by the growth of vestibular schwannomas (VS),  which often leads to progressive hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction.  Accurate volumetric assessment of VS tumors is crucial for effective monitoring  and treatment planning. Since tumor growth dynamics are often subtle, the  resolution of MRI scans plays a critical role in detecting small volumetric  changes that inform clinical decisions. This study evaluates the impact of MRI  voxel resolution on the accuracy of manual and AI-driven volumetric segmentation  of VS in NF2-SWN patients. METHODS: Ten patients with NF2-SWN, totaling 17 tumors, underwent  high-resolution MRI scans with varying voxel sizes on different MRI machines at  Yale New Haven Hospital. Tumors were segmented using both manual and AI-based  methods, and the effect of voxel size on segmentation precision was quantified  through volume measurements, Dice similarity coefficients, and Hausdorff  distances. RESULTS: Results indicate that larger voxel sizes (1.2 × 0.9 × 4.0 mm)  significantly reduced segmentation accuracy when compared to smaller voxel sizes  (0.5 × 0.5 × 0.8 mm). In addition, AI-based segmentation outperformed manual  methods, particularly at larger voxel sizes. DISCUSSION: These findings highlight the importance of optimizing voxel  resolution for accurate tumor monitoring and suggest that AI-driven segmentation  may improve consistency and precision in NF2-SWN tumor surveillance.  © 2025 Ghankot, Singh, Desroches, Jester, Mahajan, Lorr, Buono, Wiznia, Johnson  and Tommasini.

(2)Department of Pharmacology, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.  Plexiform neurofibromas (hereafter called pNF1) are often diagnosed in early  childhood and occur in about 30% of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients.  pNF1 exhibits aggressive growth along a nerve in the body and has substantial  potential for progression to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors that are  rarely curable. There are two recently FDA-approved drugs, selumetinib and  mirdametinib, for pNF1 patients who have symptomatic and inoperable plexiform  neurofibromas; however, these treatments achieve only approximately 30% tumor  shrinkage. Fibroblasts, the most abundant cell types within the pNF1 tumor  microenvironment, are implicated in pNF1 growth and invasion; however, how  fibroblasts affect a drug response of pNF1 remains poorly understood. In the  present study, we focused on contributions of fibroblasts to the drug resistance  in pNF1 via their secretome. We employed our established three-dimensional (3D)  culture system incorporating human pNF1 tumor cells (Nf1-/-) and primary  fibroblasts (Nf1+/-) grown in our patented microfluidic culture chips for  monocultures and parallel cocultures in which 3D pNF1 structures and fibroblasts  share their secretome without direct cell-to-cell contact. Three-dimensional  pNF1 structures in 3D parallel cocultures with fibroblasts exhibited greater  drug resistance than ones in monocultures. We found that pNF1 tumor cells showed  increased P-glycoprotein expression when incubated with fibroblast-derived  conditioned media or parallel cocultured with fibroblasts, compared to control  conditions. Pharmacological inhibition of P-glycoprotein partially restored drug  sensitivity. Additionally, fibroblasts showed higher resistance to selumetinib  and mirdametinib than pNF1 tumor structures, likely due to elevated  P-glycoprotein levels. This study is the first to define precise roles of  fibroblasts in pNF1 drug resistance, emphasizing the potential of  fibroblast-targeted therapies as a promising approach to improve pNF1 treatment  outcomes.

Identification of a pathogenic variant in NF1 is diagnostic for  neurofibromatosis, but is often impossible at the moment of variant detection  due to many factors including allelic heterogeneity, sequence homology, and the  lack of functional assays. Computational tools may aid in interpretation but are  not established for NF1. Here, we optimized our random forest-based predictor  RENOVO for NF1 variant interpretation. RENOVO was developed using an approach of  ""database archaeology"": by comparing versions of ClinVar over the years, we  defined ""stable"" variants that maintained the same pathogenic/likely  pathogenic/benign/likely benign (P/LP/B/LB) classification over time (n = 3579,  the training set), and ""unstable"" variants that were initially classified as  Variants of Unknown Significance (VUS) but were subsequently reclassified as  P/LP/B/LB (n = 57, the test set). This approach allows to retrospectively  measure accuracy on prediction with insufficient information, reproducing the  scenario of maximal clinical utility. We further validated performance on: (i)  validation set 1: 100 NF1 variants classified as VUS at the time of RENOVO  development and subsequently reclassified as P/LP/B/LB in ClinVar; (ii)  validation set 2: 15 de novo variants discovered in a prospective clinical  cohort and subsequently reclassified per ACMG criteria. RENOVO obtained  consistently high accuracy on all datasets: 98.6% on the training test, 96.5% in  the test set, 82% in validation set 1 (but 96.2% for missense variants) and  93.7% on validation set 2. In conclusion, RENOVO-NF1 accurately interprets NF1  variants for which information at the time of detection is insufficient for ACMG  classification and may overcome diagnostic challenges in neurofibromatosis.  © 2025.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the value of high resolution nerve ultrasound (HRUS)3 and  nerve conduction studies (NCS)4 in screening for plexiform neurofibromas (PNs)5  in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).6 METHODS: Adult patients with NF1 were  eligible. Patients were divided into two groups: with peripheral nervous system  related symptoms (PNS7 group) and without PNS-related symptoms (non-PNS group).  Study visit included neurological examination, NCS and HRUS. RESULTS: Sixty patients were enrolled, 37 in the PNS group and 23 in the non-PNS  group. HRUS was abnormal in 52 patients (87 %), 34 in the PNS group (92 %) and  18 in the non-PNS group (78 %, p = 0.24). Patients with continuous nerve  enlargements (high PN tumor load) were easily distinguished with HRUS. 85 % of  patients with normal NCS have nerve enlargements on HRUS. CONCLUSIONS: HRUS helps to assess PN tumor burden in NF1. NCS did not have  additional value. SIGNIFICANCE: HRUS might be useful as a screening tool for PN in NF1, especially  in settings with less MRI availability.  Copyright © 2025 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragmentomics has emerged as a powerful and noninvasive  approach for cancer detection, characterization, and monitoring. By analyzing  genome-wide fragmentation patterns - including fragment length distributions,  end motifs, nucleosome footprints, and copy number variations - cfDNA  fragmentomics provides high-resolution insights into tumor-specific biological  signals even at low tumor burden. This technology offers advantages over  conventional mutation-based assays by capturing aggregate structural and  epigenomic alterations without requiring prior knowledge of driver mutations. In  non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), cfDNA fragmentomics enables early detection,  discrimination of malignant pulmonary nodules, and post-surgical monitoring of  minimal residual disease. Recent studies have demonstrated that fragmentomic  risk scores can accurately stratify recurrence risk and improve prognostic  sensitivity beyond traditional genomic assays. In hepatocellular carcinoma  (HCC), integration of fragment size selection, CNV profiling, and end-motif  analysis has led to high-performing models for early diagnosis, particularly in  high-risk populations. Moreover, cfDNA fragmentomics has proven effective in  detecting malignant transformation in patients with neurofibromatosis-associated  peripheral nerve sheath tumors, distinguishing benign from premalignant or  malignant lesions with high precision. Expanding beyond these major cancers,  fragmentomic approaches have demonstrated diagnostic potential in gastric,  urological, hematologic, and pediatric malignancies. Notably, the DELFI-TF (DNA  Evaluation of Fragments for early Interception-Tumor Fraction) framework has  shown prognostic relevance by correlating pre-treatment cfDNA features with  survival outcomes in colorectal and lung cancer patients, outperforming  conventional imaging. All of these results highlight the translational  importance of cfDNA fragmentomics as a cutting-edge precision oncology tool. Its  continued integration into clinical workflows may redefine early cancer  detection, facilitate subtype-specific interventions, and enable real-time,  individualized treatment monitoring.

Schwann cells are classically known as the constituent supporting cells of the  peripheral nervous system. Beyond the scope of merely myelinating axons of the  more saliently known neurons, Schwann cells comprise the majority of peripheral  nervous system tissue. Through the lens of the inner ear, additional properties  of Schwann cells are becoming elucidated. Therein, the process of myelin  formation in development is more aptly understood as a homeostatic oscillation  of differentiation status. Perpetual interaction between neural and non-neural  cells of the inner ear maintains an intricate balance of guidance, growth, and  maturation during development. In disease, aberration to Schwann cell  myelination contributes to sensorineural hearing loss in conditions such as  Guillain-Barre Syndrome and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and tumorigenic over  proliferation of Schwann cells defines vestibular schwannomas seen in  neurofibromatosis type 2. Schwann cells demonstrate plasticity during  oscillations between differentiation and dedifferentiation, a property that is  now being leveraged in efforts to regenerate lost neurons. Emerging strategies  of reprogramming, small molecule modulation, and gene therapy suggest that  Schwann cells could serve as progenitor cells for regenerated neurons.  Understanding the duality of Schwann cells in pathology and repair could  transform the approach to treating sensorineural hearing loss.  Copyright © 2025 Montigny and Kempfle.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant tumor syndrome caused by  pathogenic variants in the NF1 gene. Beside tumor formation, patients often have  sleep disturbances, suggesting circadian involvement. Previous NF1 studies have  implicated MAPK pathway, cAMP-PKA, calcium signaling, and ALK in circadian  regulation, and shown disrupted rhythms in murine astrocytes lacking NF1.  However, whether human Schwann cells show rhythmic gene expression remains  unknown, although impaired rhythms may contribute to tumorigenesis. In this  study, we analyzed normal human Schwann cells and NF1-derived malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) for rhythmic gene expression. Cultured  cells were synchronized via serum shock, and mRNA levels of core clock and  associated genes (e.g. ARNTL, JUN, TGFA, CLOCK, VEGFA, MYC) were quantified at  defined intervals. We observed rhythmic core clock gene expression in normal  Schwann cells, demonstrating intrinsic circadian oscillations in peripheral  glia. In contrast, MPNST lacked rhythmicity in core clock genes, instead showing  de novo rhythmic expression of oncogenes and growth factors like MYC and VEGFA.  Thus, loss of clock gene rhythmicity (desynchronization) and emergence of  rhythmic oncogene expression (synchronization) in NF1-associated MPNST further  our understanding of peripheral glial physiology and tumorigenesis. These  insights suggest that chronotherapeutic strategies may be beneficial for  NF1-associated MPNST.  © 2025 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a tumor predisposition syndrome caused by  alterations in NF1 gene that lead to tumor growth throughout the nervous system,  which can cause morbidity and mortality, and transform to malignancy. NF1 gene  replacement therapy, though promising, is hindered by NF1 gene's large size and  delivery challenges. We introduced a membrane-targeted, truncated neurofibromin  comprising the GAP-related domain (GRD) fused to the KRAS4B C-terminal domain,  which effectively inhibits the RAS signaling pathway and restores Schwann cell  differentiation in an NF1 iPSC-derived model. For systemic application, we  engineered an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector using in vivo capsid evolution  through sequential DNA shuffling and peptide library screening in a NF1  xenograft mouse model. This tailored vector, AAV-NF, exhibits greatly reduced  liver uptake, enhanced tumor targeting across various NF1-related MPNST,  neurofibromas and glioma models, and therapeutic efficacy in xenografts of  MPNST. This study not only advances a viable AAV vector for NF1 treatment but  also outlines a replicable strategy for vector and payload development in other  monogenic and tumor-associated disease manifestations.  © 2025.

BACKGROUND: Treatment for patients with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors  (MPNST) is an unmet clinical need. Loss of NF1 in MPNST leads to hyperactivation  of RAS, however little is known about relevant downstream oncogenic signaling  through RAF paralogs and effective targeted therapies in MPNST are still  lacking. METHODS: Conditional gene expression, CRISPR-CAS9, and shRNA-mediated knockdown  were used to perform gain/loss-of-function experiments to explore the effect of  reconstituting the GTPase-activating protein-related domain of NF1 or knockdown  of A/B/CRAF kinases on ERK signaling output and MPNST cell growth. Colony  formation, cell proliferation and live cells imaging assays were performed to  assess cell growth in response to genetic manipulations or drug treatments.  Pathway enrichment analysis on RNA sequencing following drug perturbation,  efficacy studies in cell-line-derived and patient-derived xenograft models, and  immunoblotting/immunohistochemistry were conducted to assess tumor growth and  ERK pathway activity in cells or in pharmacodynamic analyses of tumor  xenografts. RESULTS: NF1 loss activates RAS/ERK signaling through B/CRAF, and cell growth  and ERK signaling of NF1-MPNST are dependent on B/CRAF, but not ARAF. Genetic or  pharmacological inhibition of B/CRAF using a paralog-selective RAF inhibitor  (RAFi) significantly potentiates MEK inhibitor (MEKi) treatment through more  effective suppression of ERK signaling and proliferation. This is shown in  multiple traditional and patient-derived cell line and xenograft models,  including those with acquired resistance to MEKi. CONCLUSIONS: These findings contribute preclinical evidence that the combination  of paralog-selective B/CRAFi and MEKi is effective in NF1-MPNST and can overcome  resistance to single agent MEKi.

Update of     bioRxiv. 2024 Nov 01:2024.03.25.585959. doi: 10.1101/2024.03.25.585959.  Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is a common cancer predisposition syndrome caused  by heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene NF1.  Individuals with NF1 develop benign tumors of the peripheral nervous system  (neurofibromas), originating from the Schwann cell (SC) lineage after somatic  loss of the wild-type NF1 allele, some of which progress further to malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). There is only one FDA-approved targeted  therapy for symptomatic plexiform neurofibromas and none approved for MPNSTs.  The genetic basis of NF1 syndrome makes associated tumors ideal for using  synthetic drug sensitivity approaches to uncover therapeutic vulnerabilities. We  developed a drug discovery pipeline to identify therapeutics for NF1-related  tumors using isogeneic pairs of NF1-proficient and NF1-deficient immortalized  human SCs. We utilized these in a large-scale high-throughput screen for drugs  that preferentially kill NF1-deficient cells, through which we identified 23  compounds capable of killing NF1-deficient SCs with selectivity. Multiple hits  from this screen clustered into classes defined by the method of action. Four  clinically interesting drugs from these classes were tested in vivo using both a  genetically engineered mouse model of high-grade PNSTs and human MPNST  xenografts. All drugs tested showed single-agent efficacy in these models as  well as significant synergy when used in combination with the MEK inhibitor  selumetinib. This high-throughput screen platform yielded novel therapeutically  relevant compounds for the treatment of NF1-associated tumors and can serve as a  tool to rapidly evaluate new compounds and combinations in the future.  ©2025 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.

In-depth exploration of tumor immune suppression mechanisms may provide new  therapeutic options for NF2-associated tumors. In this study, we found that sEVs  secreted by NF2-associated schwannomas (NF2-EVs) facilitate the conversion of  CD14+ monocytes into an MDSC-like phenotype, showcasing MDSC-like inhibitory  functions. Moreover, these NF2-EVs are capable of enhancing tumor cell  proliferation. Through proteomic analysis and subsequent validation of the  NF2-EVs, we identified elevated levels of HSP90. When we knocked down HSP90  expression in tumor cells, the sEVs secreted showed diminished capacity to  convert monocytes into MDSCs and a reduced ability to promote tumor cell  proliferation. Conversely, sEVs secreted by tumor cells that overexpress HSP90  displayed the opposite effects. Further mechanistic studies revealed that HSP90  could influence the expression of AKT/p-AKT and ERK/p-ERK. Our results suggest  that NF2 tumor cells could regulate the AKT/p-AKT and ERK/p-ERK pathways to  promote tumor cell proliferation and the formation of an immunosuppressive  microenvironment by secreting sEVs' HSP90, offering valuable insights into the  involvement of HSP90 in exosome-mediated communication within the context of  NF2-related schwannomatosis (NF2-SWN). This information has the potential to  inform the design of effective immunotherapeutic protocols and offer new  treatment options for NF2-SWN patients.

Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated its effectiveness by  achieving human-level performance in various complex tasks, including the  biomedical field. Cancer research, adapting to a fast-changing world, is  leveraging AI as a promising framework to better understand tumor development.  Moreover, current AI methods can help predict more suitable and personalized  treatment strategies for specific types of tumors. We explored AI methods  applied to Neurofibromatosis Type 1, focusing on glial tumors. Additionally, we  have reviewed all publicly available datasets to date. Discussion of future  challenges is highly desirable since Neurofibromatosis Type 1 is one of the most  common hereditary tumor syndromes and is associated with an increased rate of  glial tumors as well as a reduced life expectancy due to malignancy.

Radiation therapy is now well tolerated and associated with few side effects.  However, people with certain germline genetic variants may be more sensitive to  radiation, increasing their risk of experiencing adverse effects from treatment.  Increased sensitivity to radiation can be tested in various ways; chromosomal  aberrations, which are mutations, are particularly useful for this purpose. Many  genetic variants only cause a slight increase in radiation sensitivity such as  heterozygous pathogenic variants in the breast cancer risk genes BRCA1 and  BRCA2. Variants of tumour suppressor genes, such as TP53, neurofibromatosis  (NF1, PTCH1) and retinoblastoma (RB1), cause a slightly higher increase in  radiation sensitivity. However, these also carry a high risk of secondary  cancers for only a slightly increased level of risk for therapy-related side  effects. Some patients with variants have significantly higher levels of  radiation sensitivity - up to double the normal level - while others are even  more sensitive. Nevertheless, significant variations exist within each specific  genetic disorder. This means that radiosensitivity testing should be considered  for all patients with a genetic disorder suspected to markedly increase their  radiosensitivity, before they undergo radiotherapy. It implies that patients at  risk of germline variants, such as children, young people and others at risk  with a tumour, should be carefully evaluated and testing for genetic variants  should be performed.  © 2025 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.

Author information: (1)Department of Chemistry, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA.  Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, and with  ongoing population growth and aging, its annual incidence continues to rise.  Glioma is a malignant tumor of the brain and central nervous system (CNS).  Neurosurgical tumor resection is a critical component of glioma treatment,  significantly affecting patient prognosis. However, due to the diffuse nature of  gliomas, achieving gross total resection is challenging, and residual tumor  cells often lead to recurrence and disease progression following surgery.  Intraoperative cancer diagnosis using rapid and sensitive techniques, such as  ambient ionization mass spectrometry (AIMS), can provide crucial molecular  insights to guide surgical decision-making and potentially improve patient  outcomes. AIMS techniques, including desorption electrospray ionization-mass  spectrometry (DESI-MS), require minimal or no sample pretreatment, making them  particularly advantageous for intraoperative applications where time efficiency  is essential. Several AIMS methods have been investigated in brain cancer  studies, either intraoperatively or offline, to analyze molecular alterations in  cancerous tissues. Among these, DESI-MS is the most extensively reported AIMS  technique in brain cancer research. This review focuses on the developments and  applications of DESI-MS in both offline and intraoperative brain cancer  diagnosis. Additionally, other AIMS methods employed in brain cancer research  are discussed. The potential impact of AIMS techniques on glioma diagnosis is  also explored.

There is currently no effective treatment for malignant peripheral nerve sheath  tumors (MPNSTs), half of which result from malignant progression of  neurofibromas (NFs) in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). NFs are due  to biallelic loss-of-function of NF1, which negatively regulates the RAS  pathway, in the Schwann cell lineage. We generated a conditional Nf1-mutant  mouse model where NFs spontaneously transform into MPNSTs, faithfully  recapitulating the human situation. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling  demonstrated progression of NFs into MPNSTs, with a glial-to-mesenchymal  transition. Sox9 was identified as a marker of this transition and key player in  tumor growth. The transition is followed by a loss of the tumor suppressor gene  (TSG) Cdkn2a and acquisition of pathogenic variants of other TSGs. Finally, a  proof-of-concept drug screen aimed at reducing Sox9 expression in tumor cells  identified 12 FDA-approved drugs. Notably, several of these agents target the  RAS signaling cascade, suggesting that multi-targeted inhibition of this pathway  may represent a promising therapeutic strategy against MPNSTs.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a complex, multisystem, genetic disorder  caused by germline NF1 variants that predispose affected individuals to tumors  of the nervous system. With the identification of the NF1 gene in the late 1980s  and the elucidation of the role of the encoded protein, neurofibromin, in  regulating RAS signaling, considerable research effort has been invested to  identify therapeutic treatments for NF1 tumors. Over the past two decades,  high-throughput drug screening approaches have been a significant component of  these endeavors. However, considerable variability exists among studies in terms  of disease models, symptom targets, screening libraries, methods, and outcomes.  In this review, we present an overall summary of efforts toward discovering new  therapeutic strategies for NF1-related tumors using high-throughput screening  and how such findings can be employed for prospective research in the NF1 field.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder affecting 1 in 3 000 people  due to heterozygous mutations in the NF1 gene. Patients with NF1 can develop  multiple symptoms, such as neurofibromas, skin hyperpigmentation, and bone  abnormalities, including tibial pseudarthrosis and spine deformity. Here, we  aimed to elucidate the cellular origin and pathogenic mechanism of NF1 spine  deformity. We explored the Prss56-Nf1 knockout (KO) mouse model that  recapitulates neurofibromas and pseudarthrosis by carrying Nf1 gene inactivation  in Prss56-expressing boundary cap cells, a neural crest subset, and their  derivatives. Micro-CT analyses showed that Prss56-Nf1 KO mice exhibit spine  deformity from 12 months of age, associated with vertebral anomalies reminiscent  of patients with NF1. Fate mapping revealed a significant increase in OSX+  osteoblasts of the Prss56 lineage in vertebrae of Prss56-Nf1 KO mice. Increased  traced Nf1-deficient cells correlated with increased vertebral bone volume and  kyphosis spine curvature. Finally, we showed that treating Prss56-Nf1 KO mice  with RAS-MAPK pathway inhibitors prevented spine deformity. Overall, the  Prss56-Nf1 KO mouse model unravels the role of osteoblasts from the Prss56  lineage as the cellular origin of NF1 spine deformity and highlights RAS-MAPK  pathway inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy for preventing NF1 spine  deformity.  © 2025.

(2)Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Nephrology, Yale School of  Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, United States of America.  Identifying genes associated with rare diseases remains challenging due to the  scarcity of patients and the limited statistical power of traditional  association methods. Here, we introduce PERADIGM ( Phenotype Embedding  similarity-based RAre DIsease Gene Mapping), a novel framework that leverages  natural language processing techniques to integrate comprehensive phenotype  information from electronic health records for rare disease gene discovery.  PERADIGM employs an embedding model to capture relationships between ICD-10  codes, providing a nuanced representation of individual phenotypes. By utilizing  patient similarity scores, it enhances the identification of candidate genes  associated with disease-specific phenotypes, surpassing conventional methods  that rely on binary disease status. We applied PERADIGM to the UK Biobank  dataset for three rare diseases: autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease  (ADPKD), Marfan syndrome, and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). PERADIGM  identified additional candidate genes associated with ADPKD-related and Marfan  syndrome-related phenotypes, some of which are supported by existing literature,  and demonstrated enhanced signal detection for NF1-specific phenotypes beyond  traditional methods. Our findings demonstrate the potential of PERADIGM to  identify genes associated with rare diseases and related phenotypes by  incorporating phenotype embeddings and patient similarity, providing a powerful  tool for precision medicine and a deeper understanding of rare disease genetics  and clinical manifestations.

Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2)-related schwannomatosis is an autosomal dominant  genetic disorder characterized by the development of cranial and peripheral  nerve schwannomas, including bilateral vestibular schwannomas which are  associated with substantial morbidity. Current therapeutic strategies comprise  surgical resection, radiotherapy, and systemic administration of bevacizumab;  however, these approaches are frequently limited by high recurrence rates and  morbidity. In this study, a transgenic murine model (Postn-Cre;Nf2flox/flox) was  employed to investigate the combined effect of intraperitoneally administered  human bevacizumab (5 mg/kg b. w.) and focused ultrasound (FUS) on drug delivery  and tumor growth in DRG schwannomas. ELISA-based analysis demonstrated a  3.8-fold increase in intratumoral bevacizumab concentration following the  combined application of human bevacizumab and FUS, compared to bevacizumab  alone. Tumor growth was assessed using 7-T MRI of the spine with intravenous  gadolinium contrast, and outcomes were compared across five experimental groups:  (1) human bevacizumab alone, (2) murine bevacizumab alone, (3) human bevacizumab  combined with FUS, (4) FUS alone, and (5) untreated controls. Treatments,  including drug administration and FUS exposure, were performed three times at  two-week intervals. Notably, the combined treatment group (human  bevacizumab + FUS) exhibited a trend toward tumor size reduction.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Macrocephaly is among the most common findings in  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and may be associated with other clinical  manifestations of the genetic syndrome. NF1-specific growth charts that account  for expected macrocephaly may increase sensitivity for detecting atypical  growth. We aimed to produce NF1-specific growth charts of head circumference for  the age range of 0-3 years and to assess their potential clinical impact. METHODS: Using electronic health records from the Children's Hospital of  Philadelphia, we collected head circumference measurements from children with  NF1 and a community control cohort seen at scheduled well-child visits. We  compared head circumference normalized using Centers for Disease Control (CDC)  growth charts between these groups over time. We constructed NF1-specific growth  charts using 2 independent methods. Finally, we used mixed-effects models to  relate the resulting centile scores to developmental delay assessed with the  Survey of Well-being of Young Children. RESULTS: Our data set contained 2,180 observations from 305 individuals (167  male) with NF1 and 104,750 observations from 16,742 individuals (8,809 male) in  the community control cohort, all aged 0-3 years. Head circumference was  significantly elevated in the NF1 cohort across the age range (p-adjusted  <0.05), but the Cohen effect size d varied nonlinearly with age, starting  moderate at 1 month (d = 0.56), then small at 4 months (d = 0.28), moderate  again at 15 months (d = 0.58), and finally large at 28 months (d = 0.80).  NF1-specific growth curves demonstrated slower increases in head circumference  in the first 2 months of life, yet more sustained growth over time. Although  none of the children with NF1 met the standard for microcephaly according to CDC  charts, smaller head circumference benchmarked against NF1-specific charts was  correlated with developmental delay (standardized β = 0.24; p < 0.02). DISCUSSION: We present the first NF1-specific growth charts for head  circumference covering the age range of 0-3 years. Macrocephaly in NF1 becomes  more exaggerated over time as rate of growth is sustained compared with  controls. Smaller head size relative to NF1 growth expectations is not captured  by CDC charts yet it nevertheless relates to developmental delay, suggesting  that NF1-specific charts may increase sensitivity to clinically concerning  patterns of growth in children with NF1.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) occurs as a complex, multifaceted event  driven by the interplay of tumor-permissive genetic mutations, the nature of the  cellular origin, and microenvironmental stress. In this study, using primary  human pancreatic acinar 3D organoids, we performed a CRISPR-KO screen targeting  199 potential tumor suppressors curated from clinical PDAC samples. Our data  revealed significant enrichment of a list of candidate genes, with  neurofibromatosis type 2 associated gene (NF2) emerging as the top target.  Functional validation confirmed that loss of NF2 promoted the transition of PDAC  to an invasive state, potentially through extracellular matrix modulation. NF2  inactivation was found to enhance PDAC cell fitness under nutrient starvation.  This adaptation not only reinforced the oncogenic state but also conferred  therapeutic resistance. Additionally, we found that NF2 loss was associated with  fibroblast heterogeneity and cancer-stroma communication in tumor evolution.  These findings establish NF2 as a critical tumor suppressor in PDAC and uncover  its role in mediating nutrient adaptation and drug resistance. Importantly, this  study provides additional insights into drug resistance mechanisms and potential  therapeutic targets in PDAC.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that  affects ∼ 1: 2700 individuals (Lee et al., 2023) however the underlying  pathogenic mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we performed  simultaneous reprogramming and CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to generate  pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs) lines and their respective isogenic controls from  six individuals with different pathogenic NF1 variants. All iPSC lines had a  normal karyotype, were pluripotent and able to differentiate into the three  embryonic germ layers. These iPSC lines are valuable pre-clinical models to  investigate the pathomechanisms of NF1 and can be used for future screening to  identify new therapeutic treatments for NF1.

Optic glioma, a slow-growing tumor, is associated with Neurofibromatosis type 1  (NF1) mutations and increased midkine (MDK) production. A connection between  asthma and optic glioma has previously been observed, but the mechanisms are  unclear. To elucidate the role of asthma in the regulation of glioma formation,  we investigated the role of T cells and the subsequent pathways in the  regulation of microglia, a key player in the glioma tumor microenvironment  (TME). While asthma is often linked to chronic inflammation, our mathematical  analysis and experimental evidence suggest that inflammation can play a key role  in suppressing the proliferation of optic glioma cells via immune reprogramming  of T cells and the delicate control of signaling networks in microglia. Our  mathematical model unveils the complex interactions between tumor and immune  cells in optic glioma. Our results indicate that asthma-induced T cell  reprogramming inhibits tumor growth by promoting the release of decorin and a  subsequent suppression of CCR8 and the intercellular binding kinetics in  microglia, followed by blocking of CCL5 production in TME via suppression of  NFκB. We developed anti-cancer strategies by leveraging this asthma-induced  immune regulation.  © 2026. The Author(s).

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant condition in which  patients are heterozygous for a disruptive pathogenic variant in the NF1 gene.  The most characteristic feature of the condition NF1 is the neurofibroma, a  benign, multi-cellular tumor which initiates when a cell of the Schwann cell  lineage gains a somatic pathogenic variant of the other NF1 allele.  Neurofibromas developing at nerve termini in the skin are termed ""cutaneous""  neurofibromas (cNFs), while those developing within larger nerves are termed  ""plexiform."" Most patients develop cNFs beginning in late childhood or early  adulthood, continuing throughout life at variable rates. Some patients may  develop only a few cNFs, while others suffer from thousands. There are no  reliably effective physical or pharmaceutical therapies besides surgical  removal. Although these are not life-threatening, they are disfiguring and can  interfere with normal life functions. To provide a resource for research, we  developed short-term cNF Schwann cell cultures from NF1 patients, from which we  subsequently established the first semi-immortalized cNF cell lines through  transduction with wild-type human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and  murine cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (mCdk4) genes. Here we present molecular,  cellular, and functional characterization of these cell lines, which will be of  utility for investigating and developing NF1 cNF therapies.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a neurogenetic disorder caused by loss of  function mutations in the gene neurofibromin 1 (NF1). NF1 encodes neurofibromin,  a multifunctional tumor suppressing protein that regulates Ras, cAMP, and  dopamine signaling. NF1 predisposes patients to a wide range of symptoms,  including peripheral nerve tumors, brain tumors, and cognitive dysfunction.  Despite considerable work using animal models to investigate the role of  neurofibromin in behavior, translating research into treatment for  NF1-associated cognitive dysfunction has not yet been successful. Here, we  provide evidence that Cxcr4 chemokine receptor signaling is a regulator of  habituation learning and modulator of cAMP-PKA signaling in nf1 mutant larval  zebrafish. Combining a small-molecule drug screen and RNAseq analysis, we show  that cxcr4b expression is increased in nf1 mutants and that pharmacological  inhibition of Cxcr4 with AMD3100 (Plerixafor) improves habituation learning. We  further demonstrate that Plerixafor activates cAMP-PKA pathway signaling but has  limited effects on Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway signaling in the nf1 mutant brain.  CXCR4 was previously identified as a potential therapeutic target for  neurofibromin-deficient tumorigenesis. Our results suggest that Cxcr4 signaling  also regulates neurofibromin-dependent cognitive function.  © 2026. Published by The Company of Biologists.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive sarcomas and a  major cause of mortality in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1). Distinguishing  MPNSTs from benign neurofibromas remains challenging. We investigated fibroblast  activation protein alpha (FAP) as a malignancy biomarker and theranostic target  in peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Therefore, we integrated publicly available  bulk transcriptomics, spatial transcriptomics, and single-cell RNA sequencing  with immunohistochemistry (IHC) on independent archival samples. We further  directly assessed clinical translatability using FAP-targeted PET/CT in an NF-1  patient undergoing work-up for suspected malignant transformation. Across  independent bulk datasets, FAP was consistently up-regulated in MPNSTs compared  with neurofibromas. In the TCGA sarcoma dataset, FAP varied by histotype but was  clearly expressed in MPNSTs. Spatial transcriptomics revealed enrichment of  FAP-high regions in MPNSTs and co-localization with tumor cell markers.  Single-cell analysis showed FAP expression in MPNST tumor cells and  cancer-associated fibroblasts, with the highest levels in neural crest-like  tumor subpopulations previously linked to adverse prognosis; pseudotime analysis  indicated decreasing FAP expression along trajectories toward Schwann cell  precursor-like states linking FAP expression to a more primitive,  dedifferentiated tumor cell state. IHC confirmed strong, predominantly tumor  cell-intrinsic FAP expression in MPNSTs, with minimal staining in neurofibromas  and normal tissues. Plexiform neurofibromas exhibited intermediate FAP  expression. In clinical imaging, FAP-PET demonstrated higher tracer uptake in  histologically proven MPNSTs than in benign lesions within the same patient,  including a neurofibroma that was FDG-avid but FAP-negative, supporting added  diagnostic specificity over FDG-PET/CT. In summary, FAP is robustly  overexpressed in MPNSTs at transcript and protein levels, potentially  concentrates in high-risk tumor cell states, and is detectable by targeted PET  imaging. These findings identify FAP as a clinically relevant biomarker for  malignancy in NF-1-associated tumors and support implementation of FAP-directed  diagnostics and therapeutics in peripheral nerve sheath tumor work-up.  © 2026.

Background: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder  characterized by cutaneous and subcutaneous neurofibromas, which impact quality  of life. Dermoscopy-guided high-frequency ultrasound (DG-HFUS) integrates  dermoscopy with 33 MHz ultrasound, enabling precise lesion localization and  reproducible measurements. Objective: To characterize neurofibromas in NF1  patients using DG-HFUS and identify imaging parameters for diagnosis,  monitoring, and treatment planning. Methods: 14 genetically confirmed NF1  patients underwent DG-HFUS imaging (Dermus SkinScanner). 100 neurofibromas were  assessed for size, location, shape, contours, surface, echogenicity, global  echogenicity, and posterior acoustic features. Results: Lesions were dermal  (79%) or subcutaneous (21%), round (28%), ovoid (63%), or spiked (9%). Mean  vertical and lateral diameters were 5.37 ± 2.66 mm and 2.28 ± 1.39 mm. All were  hypoechoic; 62% homogeneous, 38% heterogeneous. Margins were well-defined in 57%  and poorly defined in 43%. Posterior enhancement occurred in 3% and shadowing in  10%. Conclusions: DG-HFUS provides a detailed, reproducible assessment of  neurofibromas, supporting differential diagnosis, surgical planning, and  longitudinal monitoring. The evaluated imaging parameters offer objective  insights for optimizing NF1 management. Future developments, including 3D  reconstruction and AI-assisted analysis, may further enhance its clinical  utility.

Background and objective Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) typically presents with  physical symptoms, neurocognitive impairments, and chronic pain (CP). Existing  pain measures, originally developed for cancer pain or other diseases, do not  address the specific healthcare needs of NF1 patients. Hence, this study aimed  to examine how individuals with NF1-associated CP and their providers  characterize the physical and emotional experiences of pain, as well as their  perceived needs in assessing NF1-associated CP. Methods We performed a  qualitative study, employing thematic analysis of data collected from six focus  groups with 37 patients with NF1 and 16 one-on-one interviews with clinicians  involved in NF1 care Results We identified three themes: Describing the Pain  Experience, Treating and Dealing With NF1-Associated CP, and Attitudes About  Current Pain Measures. Participants perceived certain shortcomings in current  pain measures, emphasizing that pain tolerance, adaptation of goals and  activities, and the presence of multiple concurrent pain sites are intrinsic to  NF1. Patients expressed frustration with the need to quantify a highly  subjective and individualized experience using existing measures. Similarly,  providers reported frustration that current tools inadequately capture the  impact of chronic pain on patients' daily lives, with some preferring more open,  conversational approaches to pain assessment. Conclusions The data indicated  that pain duration, frequency, regularity, and quality need to be clearly  defined and operationalized for patients and providers to similarly understand  these domains. Incorporating open-ended items that allow patients to describe  their pain in their own words or through images may enhance patients' sense of  being understood by their providers. There is a clear need for a standardized  pain assessment tool that specifically captures the pain experiences of  individuals with NF1.  Copyright © 2025, Grau et al.

NF2 (neurofibromatosis type 2)-related schwannomatosis (NF2-SWN) is a cancer  predisposition syndrome characterized by the development of bilateral vestibular  (VS) and spinal schwannomas. While benign, these tumors can cause substantial  morbidity, and effective pharmacological treatments remain limited. Here, we  demonstrate that genetic ablation of focal adhesion kinase (Fak/Ptk2) impairs  tumor formation and preserves hearing in a murine model of NF2. Mechanistically,  we show that Fak deletion decreases macrophage infiltration, attenuates  nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2-, leucine rich  repeats (LRR)- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 inflammasome activation,  and suppresses the hepatocyte growth factor-MET axis. Pharmacological inhibition  of FAK with single agent VS-4718 did not significantly reduce macroscopic tumor  volume; however, its use in combination with the mitogen-activated protein  kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor selumetinib resulted in both a significant  reduction in tumor volume and the preservation of dorsal root ganglion  architecture. Our findings establish a critical role for FAK in schwannoma  development and provide rationale for evaluation of combination FAK plus MEK  inhibition in future clinical trials for NF2-associated SWN.

(#)Contributed equally  Neurofibromatosis type I is a rare neurocutaneous syndrome characterized by the  development of disfiguring neurofibroma tumors with unmet clinical needs. As  Neurofibromatosis Type I is a monogenic disease, the development of gene therapy  is highly attractive, but it is currently unknown if rescuing the NF1 gene in  established neurofibroma is sufficient for tumor regression. Here, we test this  hypothesis by building two novel NF1 mouse models with reversible NF1  expression. In the first model, the human NF1 -/- Schwann cells named ipNF95.11b  C/T are genetically modified with a doxycycline-inducible full-length mouse Nf1  gene. One month after cells implantation in the sciatic nerve, mice are split  into two treatment groups and received either doxycycline or control water.  Strikingly, most sciatic nerves from mice allowed to drink doxycycline water for  one month do not display neurofibroma histologically (2 out of 16 sciatic  nerves, 13%) whereas 75% (12 out of 16 sciatic nerves) develop or maintain a  neurofibroma when drinking control water. In the second model, the human NF1 +/-  Schwann cells named ipNF95.11 C are genetically modified with a  doxycycline-inducible potent shRNA against the NF1 mRNA transcript. Strikingly,  doxycycline withdrawal after neurofibroma establishment allowed limited  neurofibroma maintenance (3 out of 14 sciatic nerves, 21%), whereas most sciatic  nerves showed evidence of neurofibroma when kept on doxycycline (12 out of 14  sciatic nerves, 86%). Finally, intrathecal injection of the full-length Nf1  lentivirus in established 1-month ipNF95.11b C/T xenograft pNF significantly  reduced tumor burden. All mice are female. Thus, we provide proof-of-principle  of the efficacy of NF1 Gene Therapy in plexiform neurofibroma mice models,  paving the way to the development of therapeutic gene therapy solutions for NF1  patients.  © 2026.

Tumours of the nervous system of animals are not as rare as has been commonly  believed. In dogs, especially the brachycephalic breeds, these tumours occur as  frequently as in man. The tumours are grouped according to tissue of origin as  follows: nerve cells, neuroepithelium, glia, peripheral nerves and nerve  sheaths, meninges and vessels, the pineal and pituitary glands, and the  craniopharyngeal duct. Tumours of the glia are relatively common and are divided  into the following types: astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, glioblastoma,  spongioblastoma, medulloblastoma, and unclassified gliomas.

Primary mediastinal tumours. A review of 28 patients with primary mediastinal  tumours seen over a five-year period is presented. Clinical and pathological  features of a heterogeneous group of tumours are emphasized. Since a number of  patients presented with mild symptoms or were asymptomatic (especially adults),  the importance of routine chest radiographs is stressed. Complete excision was  accomplished in all patients with benign lesions. Malignant lesions were usually  partially resectable and carried a poor prognosis.

PMID:4622580,Recent advances in neuroblastoma.,"Recent advances in neuroblastoma.  Finklestein JZ, Gilchrist GS.  Neuroblastoma is one of the commoner tumors of infancy and childhood. There is  great variation in the histological picture and even within one tumor. One  unique feature is the apparently high rate of spontaneous regression,  particularly during the first year of life. There is also a tendency for  neuroblastoma to mature to the more benign ganglioneuroma and recent in vitro  studies suggest that a serum factor may influence this process. Approximately 90  percent of patients with neuroblastoma excrete abnormally high quantities of  various catecholamines, thus providing a useful diagnostic tool and a means for  evaluating the effect of therapy. Treatment requires a multidisciplinary team  approach involving a surgeon, radiotherapist and chemotherapist. Prognosis is  influenced by a number of host factors and the most important of these seem to  be the patient's age at diagnosis and the extent of the disease, although some  children with widespread disease appear to have a particularly good prognosis.  It is difficult to evaluate the influence of chemotherapy on survival in  patients with neuroblastoma but it has not been of great significance. The  unique biologic characteristics of this tumor require further study in the hope  of providing more effective therapy.

PMID:5003511,Neurofibromatosis and leprosy.,"Neurofibromatosis and leprosy.  Swift TR.  Two patients with neurofibromatosis and leprosy are reported. Both had active  lepromatous leprosy and generalized neurofibromata. The bacilli appear in huge  numbers within the cytoplasm of the cells making up the neurofibromata, which  become distended and resemble lepra cells. Since these cells are believed to  derive from Schwann cells, the findings in these patients support the idea that  leprosy affects nerves initially by proliferating in Schwann cells and producing  changes within them.

Ross AH, Grob P, Bothwell M, Elder DE, Ernst CS, Marano N, Ghrist BF, Slemp CC,  Herlyn M, Atkinson B, et al.  The nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor was characterized by using a new series  of anti-receptor monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). These MAbs (i) showed  significantly greater reactivity with a melanoma cell line expressing higher  levels of NGF receptor, (ii) inhibited the binding of 125I-labeled NGF to its  receptor, and (iii) immunoprecipitated both metabolically labeled and  125I-labeled NGF affinity-labeled receptor. These experiments defined the  receptor as a 75-kDa cell-surface protein. The NGF receptor was visualized by  immunoperoxidase staining in tissue sections of human nevi, melanomas,  neurofibromas, a pheochromocytoma, and peripheral nerves. Uniform staining of  the cytoplasm suggests that, in addition to cell-surface NGF receptors, there is  a population of intracellular receptors.

PMID:6139138,Multiple endocrine neoplasia associated with von Recklinghausen's disease.,"Multiple endocrine neoplasia associated with von Recklinghausen's disease.

Details were studied of three patients with duodenal carcinoid tumour in  association with neurofibromatosis and phaeochromocytoma, and of four patients  with duodenal carcinoid and either von Recklinghausen's disease or  phaeochromocytoma. The rarity of these endocrine tumours, together with the  unusual morphological features and somatostatin content of the two duodenal  carcinoids examined, suggest that this combination of tumours is not a chance  association. It is suggested that this linkage of neurofibromatosis,  phaeochromocytoma, and duodenal carcinoid is a specific multiple endocrine  neoplasia syndrome.

The clinical experimental model of HLI application in the therapy of skin and  mucosal cancers of the head and neck has opened new prospects in HLI  utilization. Based on clinical observations and research it may be concluded  that HLI, if applied topically in the area of the tumor, may induce its  disappearance or regression. If applied presurgically, it blocks the dispersion  of neocytes during surgery. Also, HLI inhibits metastatic dissemination of  malignant tumors and therefore might reduce the percentage of patients with  recurrence, decreasing the chance of survival of any other primary tumor.

PMID:6203987,Neurofibromatosis of von Recklinghausen: a quantitative study of the epidermal keratinocyte and melanocyte populations.,"Neurofibromatosis of von Recklinghausen: a quantitative study of the epidermal  keratinocyte and melanocyte populations.  Frenk E, Marazzi A.  The numerical keratinocyte to melanocyte relation was studied in café au lait  spots and adjacent normally pigmented skin of 9 patients with classical  neurofibromatosis. Compared to normal skin of healthy individuals, the  keratinocyte:melanocyte ratio distributions obtained in neurofibromatosis  indicated a shift to lower values in the biopsies of café au lait spots and  normally pigmented skin. These results are evidence in favor of an impaired  tissue organization of the epidermis in neurofibromatosis with regard to the  keratinocyte-melanocyte interrelation.

Stefansson K, Wollmann R, Jerkovic M.  In soft tissues outside the central nervous system, S-100 protein is found  normally only in Schwann cells. Using the peroxidase-antiperoxidase  immunohistochemical method S-100 was also found in tumors derived from Schwann  cells and melanocytes, including neurofibromas, neurilemomas, granular cell  myoblastomas, cutaneous nevi, and malignant melanomas. S-100 was not detected in  malignant Schwannomas, neuroblastomas, oat cell carcinomas, medullary carcinomas  of the thyroid, paragangliomas, or meningiomas. S-100 was also absent from  neoplasms of soft tissues not usually considered to arise from cells of neural  crest origin. S-100 appears to be a useful marker for identifying neoplasms  derived from Schwann cells and melanocytes.

PMID:6413007,Tumors of the peripheral nervous system.,"Tumors of the peripheral nervous system.  Ariel IM.  Most tumors (benign and malignant) do not arise from the nerves per se, but from  the supporting cells; tumors arising from the cells of Schwann are termed  schwannoma or neurilemoma--benign or malignant. Surgical extirpation is the only  way of treating these tumors. Radiation therapy can offer significant palliation  and prolongation of life, but no cures have been observed. Other forms of  therapy (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, etc.) have little to offer at this time.  Benign tumors can be treated by local surgical extirpation; malignant tumors  must be radically resected, including major amputations where indicated. Certain  dermatomes have a proclivity to produce tumors, and new growths (benign and  malignant) proximal to the one clinically apparent can be expected in certain  patients. Neurofibromatosis (von Recklinghausen's disease) is a genetic error of  metabolism with a proclivity to produce multiple neurofibrosarcomas, and in  about 10 percent of the patients, malignant neurilemomas. Of 100 patients with  malignant neurilemomas treated by the author, 74 were considered determinate;  among them, the 10-year ""cure"" rate was 32 percent. Patients with von  Recklinghausen's disease had almost as good a 10-year survival rate as those  with solitary malignant schwannoma (30 percent vs 39 percent).

Spence MA, Bader JL, Parry DM, Field LL, Funderburk SJ, Rubenstein AE, Gilman  PA, Sparkes RS.  Linkage analysis of 28 genetic markers was undertaken in 108 subjects from 11  families with well-documented, classic, peripheral neurofibromatosis. Fifty-four  persons were affected in one four-generation family, seven three-generation  families, and three two-generation families. Lod scores were calculated using  the standard LIPED programme for 49 combinations of theta male and theta female  from 0.01 to 0.50. Lod scores excluded close linkage with 16 markers, including  most tested on chromosome 1 and HLA on chromosome 6, and were inconclusive for  12 markers, including the secretor locus, closely linked to myotonic dystrophy.  Analysis of five informative families resulted in a lod score of +2.2 for close  linkage with GC on chromosome 4. However, the lod score for GC in the one  additional informative family was negative, so that the final interpolated  maximum was Z = 0.89 for theta male = 0.03, theta female = 0.28. Further studies  are needed to evaluate this suggestion of linkage and possible genetic  heterogeneity.

PMID:6432917,The nature and origin of the melanin macroglobule.,"The nature and origin of the melanin macroglobule.  Nakagawa H, Hori Y, Sato S, Fitzpatrick TB, Martuza RL.  The melanin macroglobule (MMG), formerly called ""macromelanosome,"" is a  cytoplasmic spherical granule formed in the melanocyte, varying in size from one  to several microns, much larger than normal ellipsoidal melanosomes. Although  ultrastructural features of MMG have been adequately described in the past,  there has been a disagreement about the formation process of MMG. In order to  further elucidate the nature and origin of MMG, electron microscopic studies  were conducted in several pigmentary disorders. Our findings included: (1) The  most remarkable characteristics of MMG are (a) the pleomorphism of their  internal structure and (b) the variation of their size. (2) MMG do not represent  true melanosomes but unique forms of autolysosomes resulting from the fusion of  autophagosomes (containing various numbers of melanosomes) with primary and/or  secondary lysosomes. (3) MMG are retained within melanocytes or transferred to  keratinocytes and to Langerhans cells in the epidermis, and to macrophages in  the dermis in any of their developmental stages. After transfer, MMG can fuse  with other heterolysosomes and probably increase in size in these cells. We  regard melanosome complexes as but one step in an autophagic process within  melanocytes which can, on occasion, produce MMG as residual bodies.

An enzyme that enhances the activity of DNA polymerase I (EC 2.7.7.7) for  gamma-irradiated calf thymus DNA was demonstrated in cellular extracts of normal  human fibroblasts and lymphoid-cell lines. This enzyme was found to be deficient  in all cellular extracts of fibroblasts and lymphoid-cell lines examined from  patients with the autosomal recessive disease ataxia telangiectasia. The  activity in cellular extracts from normal fibroblasts was removed when heated to  100 degrees C for 2 min or when the assay was performed at 4 degrees C. No  significant deficiency in primer-activating enzyme activity was observed in  cell-free extracts of lymphoid lines from patients with xeroderma pigmentosum,  Huntington's chorea or neurofibromatosis, or from an ataxia telangiectasia  heterozygote.

PMID:6490532,The effects of mesencephalic neural crest cell extirpation on the development of chicken embryos.,"The effects of mesencephalic neural crest cell extirpation on the development of  chicken embryos.  McKee GJ, Ferguson MW.  The mesencephalic neural crest cells of Hamburger-Hamilton Stage 9-Stage 11  chick embryos were surgically extirpated unilaterally in 148 embryos and  bilaterally in 8 embryos. Sham operations were performed unilaterally on 16  control embryos and bilaterally on one control embryo. Embryos were fixed at  various time intervals after operation, studied macroscopically, and by light  and scanning electron microscopy, and their development compared with that of 47  normal embryos. The extirpated mesencephalic region was repopulated by crest  cells within 6-8 hours after operation. These 'new' crest cells migrated from  adjacent neuraxial levels (principally the metencephalon and prosencephalon)  along the basement membrane of the neural tube and the regenerating ectoderm. At  prosencephalic and metencephalic levels, both intrinsic hyperplasia of migrating  cells and prolonged migration of crest cells from the dorsomedian part of the  neural tube contributed the additional cells required to repopulate the  mesencephalic region. Morphogenesis and differentiation of all crest cell  derivatives were normal and craniofacial malformations were absent. Thus the  neural crest and neural tube can compensate for an extensive regional loss,  premigratory crest cells are neither regionally patterned nor determined (as  prosencephalic and metencephalic cells give rise to normal mesencephalic  derivatives) and regional failure of crest cell formation is an unlikely facial  pathogenetic mechanism. Previous workers who observed facial malformations  following crest cell extirpations performed the latter by removing the lips of  the neural tube which not only removed the crest cells but also the compensatory  mechanism. Cervical scoliosis was observed in extirpated embryos but not in  controls. The pathogenesis of this scoliosis may be related to the process of  compensation, which could disturb the sequential differentiation of the neural  tube and so disorganise the mechanisms of normal axial flexion. These  observations may be relevant to the pathogenesis of some forms of congenital and  infantile idiopathic scoliosis; such scoliosis in man is frequently present in  neurofibromatosis--a neural crest lesion.

A review of employment records and tissue specimens of seven workers, reported  previously as having occupational dioxin exposure and soft tissue sarcomas,  confirms that four workers had employment of 2 to 19 years in the production of  2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) or trichlorophenol, products  contaminated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin, the most toxic dioxin  isomer. Of these individuals, two have confirmed soft tissue sarcomas. In  addition three individuals who worked for companies which made 2,4,5-T also have  confirmed soft tissue sarcomas. Their employment records do not show specific  assignment to 2,4,5-T or trichlorophenol departments; however, one individual  worked for 10 d in the production of pentachlorophenol, which is contaminated  with different isomers of dioxin. Methodological problems are discussed which  must be addressed in the epidemiologic evaluation of the outcome of soft tissue  sarcoma.

Author information: (1)Mammalian Genetics Laboratory, ABL-Basic Research Program, NCI-Frederick  Cancer Research and Development Center, Maryland 21702, USA.  Evi-2, a common site of viral integration in BXH-2 myeloid lymphomas, is located  within a large intron of the Nf1 tumor suppressor gene. Viral integration at  Evi-2 appears to induce disease by disrupting normal Nf1 expression. During our  attempts to characterize the nature of the proviruses located at Evi-2, we found  that approximately half of the proviruses were defective nonecotropic proviruses  (A. M. Buchberg, H. G. Bedigian, N. A. Jenkins, and N. G. Copeland, Mol. Cell.  Biol. 10:4658-4666, 1990). This was surprising, since most proviruses  characterized at other BXH-2 common integration sites are full-length ecotropic  viruses. In the studies described here, we found that this defective provirus  carries two large deletions, one in pol and one in env, and is structurally  related to another murine retrovirus, the murine AIDS retrovirus. By using  oligonucleotide probes specific for this defective provirus, designated MRV, we  showed that MRV-related proviruses are carried as endogenous germ line  proviruses in most inbred strains. In addition, we identified the endogenous MRV  provirus that gives rise to the defective proviruses identified at Evi-2. We  present a model that accounts for the positive selection of MRV proviruses at  Evi-2, which may allow selective identification of common viral integration  sites harboring tumor suppressor genes.

Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands.  The product of the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene is a  595-amino-acid protein bearing resemblance to a family of band-4.1-related  proteins. These proteins, including ezrin, radixin, and moesin, probably  function as molecular linking proteins, connecting the cytoskeleton to the cell  membrane. On the grounds of the homology to the ezrin, radixin, and moesin  proteins and on the basis of its predicted secondary structure, the NF2 protein  is also thought to act as a cytoskeleton-cell membrane linking protein. Using  monoclonal antibodies to amino- and carboxyl-terminal synthetic NF2 peptides we  demonstrate the co-localization of the NF2 protein with elements of the  cytoskeleton in a COS cell model system and in cultured human cells.  Furthermore, the presence of the NF2 protein in tissue sections is shown. The  monoclonal antibodies specifically stain smooth muscle cells and the stratum  granulosum of the human epidermis. In cultured smooth muscle cells the NF2  protein co-localizes with actin stress fibers. Immunoelectron microscopy  demonstrates the presence of the NF2 protein associated with keratohyalin  granules and to a lesser extent with intermediate filaments in the human  epidermis. We conclude that the NF2 protein is indeed associated with multiple  elements of the cytoskeleton.  PMCID: PMC1869530 PMID: 7485397 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",True,Parse error - defaulted to include

Author information: (1)Molecular Neuro-Oncology Laboratory, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston,  USA.  The histogenesis of dural-based or ""central"" hemangiopericytomas (cHPCs) remains  controversial. Some authors consider these tumors variants of meningiomas while  others consider them akin to peripheral hemangiopericytomas (pHPCs). Meningiomas  frequently have mutations in the neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) gene, providing a  molecular marker for meningiomas and other NF2-related tumors. We therefore  analyzed the NF2 gene in cHPCs, pHPCs, and meningiomas to determine whether  cHPCs are more similar at the molecular genetic level to meningiomas or pHPCs.  Using paraffin-embedded archival material from 28 cHPCs (including three primary  and recurrent tumors), 10 pHPCs, and 26 meningiomas, we scanned all 17 exons of  the NF2 gene and flanking intronic sequences for mutations with single strand  conformation polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing. No NF2 mutations were  found in either cHPCs or pHPCs, whereas 35% of meningiomas had NF2 gene  alterations (P < 0.001). The NF2 gene mutations in meningiomas were all  truncating mutations, consistent with previous studies. Our findings suggest  that cHPCs are distinct from meningiomas at the molecular genetic level and  support prior clinico-pathological data that distinguish these tumor-entities.

Mori S(1), Satoh T, Koide H, Nakafuku M, Villafranca E, Kaziro Y.  Author information: (1)Faculty of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Tokyo Institute of Technology,  Yokohama, Japan.  The neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene encodes a protein, neurofibromin,  containing GTPase-activating protein-related domain (GRD) that stimulates  intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras protein. By screening a randomly mutagenized  NF1-GRD library in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we isolated two NF1-GRD mutants  (NF201 and NF204) with single amino acid substitutions, which suppress the heat  shock-sensitive phenotype of the RAS2(G19V) mutant. The NF1-GRD mutants also  suppress the oncogenic Ras-induced transformation of NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts  (Nakafuku, M., Nagamine, M., Ohtoshi, A., Tanaka, K., Toh-e, A., and Kaziro, Y.  (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90, 6706-6710). In this paper, we  investigated the molecular mechanism of inhibition of the transforming  Ras-specific function by the NF1-GRD mutants in mammalian cells. In human  embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, the mutant NF1-GRDs attenuated the stimulation  of mitogen-activated protein kinase by Ras(G12V), but not by platelet-derived  growth factor. In cell-free systems, purified recombinant NF1-GRD mutants showed  an inhibitory effect on the association of Ras.guanosine  5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) with Raf at several times lower  concentrations than the wild type. Furthermore, it was revealed that the binding  affinity of the mutant NF1-GRDs toward Ras.GTP gamma S is approximately 5-10  times higher than the wild type. These results suggest that the mutant NF1-GRDs  tightly bind to an oncogenic Ras in its GTP-bound active conformation and block  the interaction between Ras and its effector, Raf.

Gutmann DH(1), Tennekoon GI, Cole JL, Collins FS, Rutkowski JL.  Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor.  Neurofibromin, the product of the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene, is a  approximately 250 kDa protein expressed predominantly in cortical neurons and  oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) and sensory neurons and  Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). To gain insight into the  biological role of neurofibromin in Schwann cells, the modulation of NF1 gene  expression in a Schwann cell line (MT4H1) stimulated to either proliferate or  differentiate in response to agents that elevate intracellular cAMP was  examined. Untreated cells and cells exposed to mitogenic doses of forskolin  (1-10 microM) or 8-bromo-cAMP (0.1 mM) expressed low levels of NF1 mRNA and the  protein was barely detectable. High doses of forskolin (100 microM) or  8-bromo-cAMP (1 mM) induced the expression of both myelin P0 protein and  neurofibromin with an identical time course. Although NF1 mRNA levels peaked  within 1-6 hr, the rise in neurofibromin was not apparent until 24-48 hr and  peaked 72 hr after treatment. P0 and neurofibromin were also coinduced by  cell-cell contact in high density, untreated cultures. Moreover, differentiation  initiated by either cAMP stimulation or high density culture conditions was  associated with predominant expression of the type 2 NF1 mRNA isoform. In  contrast, type 1 NF1 mRNA isoform expression was observed in untreated Schwann  cells or those stimulated with mitogenic doses of forskolin or 8-bromo-cAMP. A  switch from the type 1 neurofibromin that can efficiently downregulate p21-ras  to the type 2 isoform with reduced activity may facilitate a p21-ras signaling  pathway associated with Schwann cell differentiation.

Suzuki H(1), Takahashi K, Shibahara S.  Author information: (1)Department of Applied Physiology and Molecular Biology, Tohoku University  School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant disorder,  primarily affecting cells of neural crest origin, and is characterized by  café-au-lait skin spots, multiple neurofibromas, and higher incidence of  malignancy. A gene linked to NF1 encodes neurofibromin, an established function  of which is to stimulate intrinsic GTPase activity of ras protein. The  neurofibromin gene gives rise to multiple transcripts generated by alternative  splicing, that encode various neurofibromin isoforms. In this study, we have  cloned a cDNA encoding a newly identified species of a putative amino-terminal  isoform which lacks a large portion of neurofibromin, including the domain  related to GTPase-activating protein. This clone carries the insert of 2.7 kb,  coding for a protein of 593 amino acid residues, tentatively termed N-isoform  11, whose amino-terminal 574 residues are identical to those of authentic  neurofibromin encoded by the eleven exons located at the 5' portion of the gene.  Previously, we cloned a cDNA coding for a similar isoform of 551 amino acid  residues, termed N-isoform 10, whose amino-terminal portion is encoded by the  first ten exons. The molecular weights of these two deduced N-isoforms are  consistent with the values determined by in vitro translation of the mRNA  transcribed from each N-isoform cDNA. The presence of the amino-terminal  isoform(s) suggests the physiological significance of the amino-terminal portion  of neurofibromin.

Largaespada DA(1), Shaughnessy JD Jr, Jenkins NA, Copeland NG.  Author information: (1)Mammalian Genetics Laboratory, NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development  Center, Maryland 21702, USA.  Approximately 15% of BXH-2 myeloid leukemias harbor proviral integrations at the  Evi-2 common viral integration site. Evi-2 is located within a large intron of  the Nf1 tumor suppressor gene, raising the possibility that proviral integration  at Evi-2 predisposes mice to myeloid tumor development by disrupting Nf1  expression. This hypothesis is supported by data suggesting that mutations in  the human NF1 gene are causally associated with the development of juvenile  chronic myelogenous leukemia (K. M. Shannon, P. O'Connell, G. A. Martin, D.  Paderanga, K. Olson, P. Dinndorf, and F. McCormick, N. Engl. J. Med.  330:597-601, 1994) and mouse studies showing that aged mice, heterozygous for a  germ line Nf1 mutation, develop myeloid leukemia with loss of the wild-type Nf1  allele (T. Jacks, T. S. Shih, E. M. Schmitt, R. T. Bronson, A. Bernards, and R.  A. Weinberg, Nat. Genet. 7:353-361, 1994). To determine if viral integration at  Evi-2 disrupts Nf1 expression, we derived a series of BXH-2 myeloid leukemia  cell lines with or without viral integrations at Evi-2. In all cell lines  examined, viral integration at Evi-2 resulted in the production of only  truncated Nf1 transcripts and no stable, full-length neurofibromin. Although  neurofibromin is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for p21ras proteins, its loss  in the BXH-2 leukemic cell lines was not correlated with an increased  steady-state level of p21ras bound to GTP. These data suggest that neurofibromin  is not the sole mediator of Ras-GAP activity in myeloid cells and may have a  GAP-independent function in myeloid cells.

Vogel KS(1), Brannan CI, Jenkins NA, Copeland NG, Parada LF.  Author information: (1)Center for Developmental Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical  Center, Dallas 75235-9133, USA.  Mutations at the neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) locus in humans and mice result in  abnormal growth of neural crest-derived cells, including melanocytes and Schwann  cells. We have exploited a targeted disruption of the NF1 gene in mice to  examine the role of neurofibromin in the acquisition of neurotrophin dependence  in embryonic neurons. We show that both neural crest- and placode-derived  sensory neurons isolated from NF1(-/-) embryos develop, extend neurites, and  survive in the absence of neurotrophins, whereas their wild-type counterparts  die rapidly unless nerve growth factor (NGF) or brain-derived neurotrophic  factor (BDNF) is added to the culture medium. Moreover, NF1 (-/-) sympathetic  neurons survive for extended periods and acquire mature morphology in the  presence of NGF-blocking antibodies. Our results are consistent with a model  wherein neurofibromin acts as a negative regulator of neurotrophin-mediated  signaling for survival of embryonic peripheral neurons.

Author information: (1)Laboratory of Molecular Growth Regulation, National Institute of Child Health  and Human Development, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.  Alu repeats are short interspersed elements (SINEs) of dimeric structure whose  transposition sometimes leads to heritable disorders in humans. Human cells  contain a poly(A)- small cytoplasmic transcript of -120 nucleotides (nt)  homologous to the left Alu monomer. Although its monomeric size indicates that  small cytoplasmic Alu (scAlu) RNA is not an intermediary of human Alu  transpositions, a less abundant poly(A)-containing Alu transcript of dimeric  size and specificity expected of a transposition intermediary is also detectable  in HeLa cells (A. G. Matera, U. Hellmann, M. F. Hintz, and C. W. Schmid, Mol.  Cell. Biol. 10:5424-5432, 1990). Although its function is unknown, the  accumulation of Alu RNA and its ability to interact with a conserved protein  suggest a role in cell biology (D.-Y. Chang and R. J. Maraia, J. Biol. Chem.  268:6423-28, 1993). The relationship between the -120- and -300-nt Alu  transcripts had not been determined. However, a B1 SINE produces scB1 RNA by  posttranscriptional processing, suggesting a similar pathway for scAlu. An Alu  SINE which recently transposed into the neurofibromatosis 1 locus was expressed  in microinjected frog oocytes. This neurofibromatosis 1 Alu produced a primary  transcript followed by the appearance of the scAlu species. 3' processing of a  synthetic -300-nt Alu RNA by HeLa nuclear extract in vitro also produced scAlu  RNA. Primer extension of scAlu RNA indicates synthesis by RNA polymerase III.  HeLa-derived scAlu cDNAs were cloned so as to preserve their 5'-terminal  sequences and were found to correspond to polymerase III transcripts of the left  monomeric components of three previously identified Alu SINE subfamilies. Rodent  x human somatic cell hybrids express Alu RNAs whose size, heterogeneous length,  and chromosomal distribution indicate their derivation from SINEs. The  coexpression of dimeric and monomeric Alu RNA in several hybrids suggests a  precursor-product relationship.

The analysis revealed  the splicing out of exon 8 in the various tissues, and the transcript missing  exon 8 should thus be considered as a product of normal alternative splicing.  Our results further support the possibility that the NF2 gene expresses multiple  alternatively-spliced transcripts variantly in different tissue types.

Author information: (1)Department of Neuropathology, University of Bonn, Germany.  There is evidence from cytogenetic and loss of heterozygosity studies for the  involvement of a tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 22 in the formation of  meningiomas. Recently, the NF2 gene, which causes neurofibromatosis type 2 and  which is located in the affected region on chromosome 22, has been identified. A  previous study on 8 of the 17 exons of the NF2 gene described mutations in 16%  of meningiomas. We have analyzed the entire coding region of the NF2 gene in 70  sporadic meningiomas and identified 43 mutations in 41 patients. These resulted  predominantly in immediate truncation, splicing abnormalities, or an altered  reading frame of the predicted protein product. Although there was no evidence  for distinct hotspots, all mutations occurred in the first 13 exons, the region  of homology with the filopodial proteins moesin, ezrin, and radixin. The  association of loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 22 with mutations in the NF2  gene was significant. These data suggest that NF2 represents the meningioma  locus on chromosome 22. NF2 mutations occurred significantly more frequently in  fibroblastic meningioma (70%) and transitional meningioma (83%) than in  meningiothelial meningioma (25%), thus indicating a differential molecular  pathogenesis of these meningioma variants.

Armendariz-Borunda J(1), Simkevich CP, Roy N, Raghow R, Kang AH, Seyer JM.  Author information: (1)VA Medical Center Research Service, Memphis, TN 28104.  Activation of liver Ito cells is characterized by increased proliferation,  fibrogenesis, loss of cellular retinoid and change of cell-shape. Here, we have  described fundamental differences between freshly isolated Ito cells (FIC) and  long-term cultured Ito cells (LTIC). This process of activation correlates with  the absence of expression of Pro alpha 1(I) gene in FIC. LTIC expressed abundant  transcripts of Pro alpha 1(I) gene. Nuclear run-off experiments showed the  inability of FIC to support Pro alpha 1(I) RNA transcription while LTIC  transcribed it greater than 5-fold as compared with FIC. Transforming growth  factor beta (TGF beta)-treated LTIC had a preferential increase in the rate of  Pro alpha 1(I) gene transcription as compared with control LTIC. A human  collagen type I promoter-enhancer construct (pCOL-KT) [Thompson, Simkevich,  Holness, Kang and Raghow (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 2549-2556] was readily  expressed in LTIC but failed to be expressed in FIC. Furthermore, TGF beta  treatment of LTIC resulted in an increased expression of pCOL-KT. The deletion  of an activator protein-1 (AP-1) binding site (+598 to +604) in the 360 bp  enhancer region of pCOL-KT (S360) caused decreased expression of the CAT  reporter gene, suggesting that this bonafide AP-1 site can, at least in part,  mediate the transactivation effect of TGF beta. Using DNAase I protection, we  demonstrate a single foot-print located at +590 to +625 in the S360 fragment;  nuclear extracts prepared from TGF beta-treated LTIC exhibited greater activity  of these AP-1 binding proteins. Gel mobility assays corroborated and extended  the footprinting observation. No AP-1-binding activity was found in the nuclear  extracts of FIC. Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the consensus AP-1  motif were able to compete out the binding; consensus NF-1 motif  oligonucleotides failed to do so. The preincubation of nuclear extracts from  control and TGF beta-treated LTIC with antibodies against c-jun and c-fos  rendered a reduced binding of AP-1 proteins to the target S360 fragment.

Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.  The gene for the hereditary disorder neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), which  predisposes for benign CNS tumors such as vestibular schwannomas and  meningiomas, has been assigned to chromosome 22 and recently has been isolated.  Mutations in the NF2 gene were found in both sporadic meningiomas and vestibular  schwannomas. However, so far only 6 of the 16 exons of the gene have been  analyzed. In order to extend the analysis of an involvement of the NF2 gene in  the sporadic counterparts of these NF2-related tumors, we have used reverse  transcriptase-PCR amplification followed by SSCP and DNA sequence analysis to  screen for mutations in the coding region of the NF2 gene. Analysis of the NF2  gene transcript in 53 unrelated patients with meningiomas and vestibular  schwannomas revealed mutations in 32% of the sporadic meningiomas (n = 44), in  50% of the sporadic vestibular schwannomas (n = 4), in 100% of the tumors found  in NF2 patients (n = 2), and in one of three tumors from multiple-meningioma  patients. Of the 18 tumors in which a mutation in the NF2 gene transcript was  observed and the copy number of chromosome 22 could be established, 14 also  showed loss of (parts of) chromosome 22. This suggests that in sporadic  meningiomas and NF2-associated tumors the NF2 gene functions as a recessive  tumor-suppressor gene. The mutations detected resulted mostly in frameshifts,  predicting truncations starting within the N-terminal half of the putative  protein.

We report here the use of multiplex fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (PCR)  for quantitative allele loss detection using microsatellites with 2-5 base pair  repeat motifs. Allele loss of APC, DCC, p53 and RB1 in colorectal tumours has  been reported previously using a variety of methods. However, not all workers  used intragenic markers. We have used microsatellite polymorphisms which map  within, or are closely linked to, these tumour-suppressor gene loci in order to  determine whether these loci are indeed the targets for alteration in colorectal  cancer. In addition, we have assayed two other tumour-suppressor genes, WT1 and  NF1, to see whether they play a role in colorectal carcinogenesis. The putative  metastasis-suppressor gene, NM23, was also investigated since there have been  conflicting reports about its involvement in colorectal carcinogenesis. Allele  loss was detected at the DCC (29%), p53 (66%), RB1 (50%) and NF1 (14%) loci and  in the APC/MCC region (50%), but not at the WT1 or NM23 loci. These rapid, and  mostly gene-specific, fluorescent multiplex PCR assays for allele loss detection  could be modified to devise a single molecular diagnostic test for the important  lesions in colorectal cancer.

PMID:7949098,Genetic analysis is consistent with the hypothesis that NF1 limits myeloid cell growth through p21ras.,"Genetic analysis is consistent with the hypothesis that NF1 limits myeloid cell  growth through p21ras.  Kalra R(1), Paderanga DC, Olson K, Shannon KM.  Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco.  Children with neurofibromatosis, type 1 (NF-1) are at increased risk of  developing malignant myeloid disorders and their bone marrows frequently show  loss of the normal allele of the NF1 tumor-suppressor gene. NF1 encodes a  protein called neurofibromin, which accelerates guanosine triphosphate (GTP)  hydrolysis on the p21ras (Ras) family of signaling proteins. We used a genetic  approach to test the hypothesis that NF1 negatively regulates myeloid cell  growth through its effect on Ras. This model predicts that, if RAS mutations and  loss of NF1 function deregulate myeloid growth by the same biomechanical  mechanism, then activating RAS mutations will be restricted to children with  malignant myeloid disorders who do not have NF-1. We studied 71 children,  including 28 with bone marrow monosomy 7 syndrome (Mo7), 35with juvenile chronic  myelogenous leukemia (JCML), three with other forms of preleukemia, and five  with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), for activating mutations of KRAS and  NRAS. The incidence of RAS mutations was 21% (12 of 55) in patients without NF-1  and 0% (zero of 16) in children with NF-1 (P = .04). Among the 55 patients who  did not have NF-1, we found RAS mutations in four of 27 with Mo 7, in five of 24  with JCML, in two of 3 with AML, and in a patient with myeloproliferative  syndrome (MPS). These data from primary human cancer cells provide strong  genetic evidence that NF1 limits the growth of myeloid cells by regulating Ras.

Hajra A(1), Martin-Gallardo A, Tarlé SA, Freedman M, Wilson-Gunn S, Bernards A,  Collins FS.  Author information: (1)Department of Human Genetics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of  Michigan, Ann Arbor 48109-0650.  The gene for type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF1) is most highly expressed in brain  and spinal cord, although low levels of mRNA can be found in nearly all tissues.  As a first step in investigating the regulation of NF1 gene expression, we have  cloned and sequenced the promoter regions of the human and mouse NF1 genes and  mapped the transcriptional start sites in both species. We report here that the  5' ends of the human and murine NF1 genes are highly conserved. While no  discernable TATA or CCAAT box sequences are seen, transcription initiates at  identical sites in both species, 484 nucleotides upstream of the ATG initiation  codon in the human gene. The human and mouse NF1 genes share particularly high  sequence homology (95%) between nucleotides -33 and +261 and contain several  perfectly conserved transcription factor binding site motifs, including a cAMP  response element, several AP2 consensus binding sites, and a serum response  element. The high conservation of these sequences indicates that they are likely  to be significant in the regulation of NF1 gene expression.

A disorder resembling neurofibromatosis type 1 in humans.  Sartin EA(1), Doran SE, Riddell MG, Herrera GA, Tennyson GS, D'Andrea G, Whitley  RD, Collins FS.  Author information: (1)Department of Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Auburn  University, AL 36849-5519.  Neurofibromatosis in cattle is typically a noncutaneous disease. A small group  of cows in a Holstein dairy herd developed cutaneous neurofibromatosis. This  unique condition was investigated and compared with neurofibromatosis type 1  (NF1) in humans. All cutaneous lesions but one were consistent with  neurofibromas in noncutaneous sites in cattle and neurofibromas in patients with  NF1. One bovine lesion was classified as a neurofibrosarcoma.  Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy supported Schwannian  differentiation in benign and malignant lesions. Linkage analysis with a  polymorphism in the bovine NF1 gene confirmed that two affected animals from the  same sire inherited the same paternal NF1 allele. Bovine cutaneous  neurofibromatosis is a naturally occurring disease in this group of animals,  characterized by skin tumors morphologically identical to those of NF1. An  informative polymorphism at the NF1 locus of two animals and their sire suggests  this disorder may be caused by hereditary mutations at the bovine NF1 locus.

Itoh T(1), Magnaldi S, White RM, Denckla MB, Hofman K, Naidu S, Bryan RN.  Author information: (1)Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Division of Neuroradiology,  Baltimore, MD 21205.  PURPOSE: To investigate the evolution of deeply located high-signal-intensity  abnormalities of the brain on T2-weighted MR images of patients with  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1). METHODS: The study consists of two patient groups: 1) retrospective evaluation  of MR scans of 24 symptomatic NF-1 patients, 10 of whom were sequentially  studied, and 2) prospective MR evaluations of 20 asymptomatic NF-1 subjects from  14 families; 2 of these families were sequentially studied. RESULTS: Deeply located, high-signal-intensity abnormalities on T2-weighted  images were noted in 34 of 44 NF-1 subjects (77%). If NF-1 patients are grouped  according to age, 28 of 30 subjects (93%) younger than 15 years had the lesions,  whereas 4 of 7 subjects (57%) between 16 and 30 years, and 2 of 7 subjects (29%)  older than 31 years had lesions. High-signal lesions in basal ganglia and brain  stem were demonstrated in all decades with relatively high frequency. Lesions in  the cerebellar white matter and dentate nuclei were mainly found in the patients  younger than 10 years, and never found after the third decade. In 13 sequential  studies (mean interval, 24 months), lesions appeared to increase in size in 3,  remain unchanged in size in 2, and decrease in size in 7. One subject showed a  mixed pattern of lesion size change. CONCLUSIONS: Deeply located high-signal-intensity lesions on T2-weighted MR  images are more evident in young NF-1 patients. The underlying brain  abnormality, while pathologically unproved, is probably transient.  PMCID: PMC8334401 PMID: 7985572 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",True,Parse error - defaulted to include
PMID:7996175,Hepatocyte growth factor is a mitogen for Schwann cells and is present in neurofibromas.,"Hepatocyte growth factor is a mitogen for Schwann cells and is present in  neurofibromas.  Krasnoselsky A(1), Massay MJ, DeFrances MC, Michalopoulos G, Zarnegar R, Ratner  N.  Author information: (1)Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of Cincinnati School of  Medicine, Ohio 45267-0521.  To characterize mitogens that might contribute to Schwann cell proliferation  during development or in tumors, we tested the ability of hepatocyte growth  factor (HGF) to stimulate Schwann cell division in vitro. HGF is a potent  mitogen for purified rat Schwann cells; DNA synthesis in rat Schwann cells was  stimulated 20-40-fold by 3-10 ng/ml HGF. Rat Schwann cells express c-met mRNA,  encoding the HGF receptor, but not HGF mRNA, implying that HGF might act as a  paracrine Schwann cell growth factor. HGF-stimulated Schwann cell proliferation  differs from that of previously described Schwann cell mitogens in that its  activity is abolished by forskolin and is not inhibited or potentiated by  addition of transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) or fibroblast growth  factor (FGF). HGF is probably not a component of the axonal signal thought to  cause Schwann cell division during development, as anti-HGF neutralizing  antibodies failed to block neuron-stimulated Schwann cell proliferation. In  contrast, mitogenic activity present in normal human adult nerves and in  neurofibromas from patients with type 1 neurofibromatosis analyzed in the  absence of forskolin is largely inhibitable by anti-HGF. Thus, HGF is a novel  mitogen for Schwann cells in vitro and it is present in Schwann cell tumors,  suggesting a potential role for HGF after wounding of peripheral nerves or in  tumor growth.

PMID:803743,Vascular manifestations of von Recklinghausen's disease.,"Vascular manifestations of von Recklinghausen's disease.  Fye KH, Jacobs RP, Roe RL.  A casual relationship between von Recklinghausen's disease, or  neurofibromatosis, and arteriolar abnormalities has been reported in the  European literature. A patient was seen who had biopsy-proved neurofibromatosis  and renovascular hypertension and retroperitoneal bleeding. An arteriographic  study showed multiple small aneurysms throughout the coeliac axis, the superior  mesenteric artery and in several small intrarenal vessels. Renal vein renin  levels were elevated particularly in the right renal vein, supporting the  diagnosis of renovascular hypertension. Both the aneurysms seen in angiographic  studies and the retroperitoneal hemorrhage are probably vascular manifestations  of von Recklinghausen's disease. Support for this conclusion is enhanced by the  absence of clinical, laboratory or histologic data supporting the only tenable  differential diagnosis, periarteritis nodosa.

Schroeder WT(1), Stewart-Galetka S, Mandavilli S, Parry DA, Goldsmith L, Duvic  M.  Author information: (1)Department of Dermatology, University of Texas Medical School, Houston 77030.  We report here the isolation and characterization of a cDNA that encodes a novel  extracellular epidermal molecule, epidermal surface antigen (ESA), which is  thought to play a role in intercellular epidermal adhesion. Sequence analysis  reveals that the 379 amino acid ESA has a molecular mass of about 41.7 kDa and  an alpha-helix-rich secondary conformation. Much of this also has an heptad  substructure, consistent with the formation of several bundles of alpha-helices  in a compact globular structure. The ESA protein appears to consist of an  NH2-terminal hydrophobic region with mixed alpha and beta structure followed by  a more hydrophilic COOH-terminal region which is very rich in alpha-helix. The  2.5-kilobase ESA mRNA is expressed in cultured keratinocytes, melanocytes,  fibroblasts, carcinoma, and melanoma cell lines. The ESA gene is conserved in  all mammalian species examined and has been localized to human chromosome 17  (M17S1) in the same region as the gene for von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis.  The high level of expression of the ESA mRNA in human skin and in cultured cells  derived from the epidermis, the appearance of ESA protein early in human  development, and conservation of the ESA gene throughout mammalian evolution  suggest that the novel ESA protein plays a vital role in epidermal structure and  maintenance.

Tikoo A(1), Varga M, Ramesh V, Gusella J, Maruta H.  Author information: (1)Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria,  Australia.  Previously, we have cloned a candidate for the 595-amino acid neurofibromatosis  type 2 tumor suppressor called NF2 or Merlin, with striking sequence similarity  in its N-terminal half to an F-actin-binding protein family called TERM, which  includes talin, ezrin, radixin, and moesin (Trofatter, J. A., MacCollin, M. M.,  Rutter, J. L., Murrell, J. R., Duyao, M. P., Parry, D. M., Eldridge, R., Kley,  N., Menon, A. G., Pulaski, K., Haase, V. H., Ambrose, C. M., Munro, D., Bove,  C., Haines, J. L., Martuza, R. L., MacDonald, M. E., Seizinger, B. R., Short, M.  P., Buckler, A. J., and Gusella, J. F. (1993) Cell 72, 791-800). In an attempt  to determine whether NF2 serves as a tumor suppressor and if so whether its  N-terminal half is involved in its anti-oncogenicity, both full-length NF2 and  its N-terminal half (NF2-N, residues 9-359) have been expressed in  v-Ha-Ras-transformed NIH/3T3 cells. Like neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)  fragments (Nur-E-Kamal, M. S. A., Varga, M., and Maruta, H. (1993) J. Biol.  Chem. 268, 22331-22337), full-length NF2 can reverse the Ras-induced malignant  phenotype, i.e. anchorage-independent growth in a soft agar, and restore contact  inhibition of cell growth, indicating that NF2 is indeed a tumor suppressor.  Furthermore, NF2-N also suppresses the Ras-induced malignant phenotype, although  it appears to be less effective than the full-length NF2. These observations  indicate that the anti-Ras function of NF2 resides in part in its N-terminal  half. Thus, NF2 appears to be a new member of the tumor suppressor family of  actin-cytoskeleton-associated proteins, which includes vinculin, alpha-actinin,  tropomyosin-1, gelsolin, and tensin.

PMID:8105688,Linkage disequilibrium in the neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) region: implications for gene mapping.,"Linkage disequilibrium in the neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) region: implications for  gene mapping.  Jorde LB(1), Watkins WS, Viskochil D, O'Connell P, Ward K.  Author information: (1)Department of Human Genetics, University of Utah Health Sciences Center, Salt  Lake City 84112.  To test the usefulness of linkage disequilibrium for gene mapping, we compared  physical distances and linkage disequilibrium among eight RFLPs in the  neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) region. Seven of the polymorphisms span most of the  NF1 gene, while the remaining polymorphism lies approximately 70 kb 3' to a stop  codon in exon 49. By using Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH)  kindreds, 91-110 unrelated parents were genotyped. A high degree of  disequilibrium is maintained among the seven intragenic polymorphisms (r > .82,  P < 10(-7)), even though they are separated by as much as 340 kb. The 3'  polymorphism is only 68 kb distal to the next polymorphism, but disequilibrium  between the 3' polymorphism and all others is comparatively low (magnitude of 4  < .33, P values .27-.001). This result was replicated in three sets of unrelated  kindreds: the Utah CEPH families, the non-Utah CEPH families, and an independent  set of NF1 families. Trigenic, quadrigenic, three-locus, and four-locus  disequilibrium measures were also estimated. There was little evidence of  higher-order linkage disequilibrium. As expected for a disease with multiple  mutations, no disequilibrium was observed between the disease gene and any of  the RFLPs. The observed pattern of high disequilibrium within the gene and a  loss of disequilibrium 3' to the stop codon could have implications for gene  mapping studies. These are discussed, and guidelines for linkage disequilibrium  studies are suggested.  PMCID: PMC1682302 PMID: 8105688 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",True,Parse error - defaulted to include

Malhotra R(1), Ratner N.  Author information: (1)Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of Cincinnati College of  Medicine, Ohio 45267-0521.  Pigmentation defects are common in the inherited disease type 1  neurofibromatosis (NF1), predicting a role for the NF1 gene product,  neurofibromin, in the skin. We used immunohistochemistry to determine the  distribution of neurofibromin in normal developing and adult rat skin, normal  neonatal and adult human skin, and skin from patients affected with NF1. The  distribution of NF1 mRNA in the epidermis was also analyzed by in situ  hybridization. NF1 mRNA and neurofibromin are highly enriched in the  keratinocytes in the stratum spinosum of the epidermis in the embryonic, but not  adult, rat and in both neonatal and adult humans. Immunoelectron microscopic  analysis confirmed that neurofibromin is associated with the keratinocyte plasma  membrane, particularly adjacent to desmosomes. Neurofibromin is also detectable  in human melanocytes. Analysis of skin from NF1 patients showed normal  neurofibromin expression in nine of ten hyperpigmented cafe-au-lait macules and  in adjacent unaffected skin. We conclude that 1) neurofibromin expression in the  perinatal rat closely parallels expression in the human; 2) reduction in  detectable neurofibromin cannot be used to distinguish NF1 and normal human  skin; and 3) neurofibromin might function in keratinocytes, as well as  melanocytes.

Gutmann DH(1), Cole JL, Collins FS.  Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor.  Neurofibromin, the protein product of the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene,  has two alternate isoforms which are generated by alternative splicing of two  exons. One of these isoforms containing exon 48a is expressed at highest levels  in muscle. Since neurofibromin is a p21-ras regulator and has been recently  shown to be modulated during Schwann cell differentiation, we examined the  expression of the NF1 gene product during in vitro muscle differentiation.  Previous work demonstrated that C2C12 murine myoblast cell differentiation could  be blocked by the introduction of an activated p21-ras protein. Using this model  system, we demonstrate that differentiating C2C12 cells upregulate the  expression of NF1 mRNA by 2 days of serum starvation concomitant with increased  expression of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor mRNA. This upregulation of mRNA  expression paralleled an increase in neurofibromin and N-ras levels, but no  change in the relative abundance of the isoforms containing exon 23a or exon 48a  was observed during in vitro myoblast differentiation. The increase in  neurofibromin levels paralleled a decrease in the levels of activated p21-ras as  assayed by in vivo 32P-orthophosphate incorporation into p21-ras. These results  suggest that in vitro C2C12 cell differentiation is associated with a  concomitant increase in NF1 gene expression and decrease in the proportion of  activated p21-ras.

PMID:8226742,The GTPase-activating NF1 fragment of 91 amino acids reverses v-Ha-Ras-induced malignant phenotype.,"The GTPase-activating NF1 fragment of 91 amino acids reverses v-Ha-Ras-induced  malignant phenotype.  Nur-E-Kamal MS(1), Varga M, Maruta H.  Author information: (1)Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Post Office Royal Melbourne Hospital,  Victoria, Australia.  The human neurofibromatosis type 1 gene encodes a Ras GAP (GTPase-activating  protein) of 2818 amino acids called NF1. This GAP contains a domain of 338 amino  acids (residues 1194-1531) called NF1-GRD, which shares 26% sequence identity  with the C-terminal domain (GAP1C, residues 709-1044) of another Ras GAP called  GAP1. Both NF1-GRD and GAP1C activate normal Ras GTPases but not oncogenic  mutants such as v-Ha-Ras. Any attempt to reverse the v-Ha-Ras-induced malignant  transformation by the GAP1C has, so far, been unsuccessful. However, we have  found that when the NF1-GRD is overexpressed in v-Ha-Ras-transformed NIH/3T3  cells, it greatly reduces their ability to form colonies in a soft agar, the  property tightly associated with their malignancy. This is, so far, the first  demonstration that a Ras-binding protein can act as a potent antagonist of the  oncogenic Ras mutants in mammalian cells. In an attempt to further screen the  smallest anti-oncogenic fragment derived from the NF1-GRD, we have prepared a  series of its deletion mutants and examined their interaction with Ras first by  monitoring their GAP activity (ability to activate the normal Ras GTPase). The  deletion analysis has revealed that the N-terminal 247 amino acids (residues  1194-1440) of NF1-GRD are not required for its GAP activity, suggesting that its  remaining domain of 91 amino acids (NF91, residues 1441-1531) is sufficient to  bind the v-Ha-Ras, although its GAP activity is 20 times lower than the NF1-GRD.  The NF91 is indeed able to reverse the v-Ha-Ras-induced malignant transformation  as the NF1-GRD. The NF91 is, so far, the smallest among the tumor suppressor  proteins that show the anti-v-Ha-Ras action in vivo. Thus, the NF91 appears to  be a good starting material from which a smaller and more potent v-Ha-Ras  antagonist could be devised to be used as a potential cure for the human cancers  caused by the Ras mutants.

Author information: (1)Division of Biochemistry and Cellular Biology, National Institute of  Neuroscience, National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry, Tokyo, Japan.  GTPase-activating protein (GAP) and neurofibromin, a gene product of  neurofibromatosis type I gene, have been identified as factors that stimulate  GTPase activity of ras p21. We have previously suggested the presence of novel  GAP activity that is immunologically distinguishable from GAP or neurofibromin  in both the cytosolic and the particulate fractions of rat brain (Hattori, S.,  Maekawa, M., and Nakamura, S. (1992) Oncogene 7, 481-485). We have purified this  novel GAP molecule from the cytosolic fraction of rat brain by more than  200,000-fold by five successive column chromatographies with a recovery of 6%.  Apparent molecular mass of this molecule was estimated to be 100 kDa  (p100GAPras). The same p100GAPras was purified from the particulate fraction  after extraction with high salt. The activation of GTPase was observed with  normal ras p21 but not with oncogenic ras p21, Rap1B/smg21B, or Ram25K. The  dissociation constant of p100GAPras toward ras p21 estimated by competitive  inhibition using ras p21 in complex with nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP was two  times higher than that of neurofibromin and was lower than that of GAP by 2  orders of magnitude. These results clearly indicate that p100GAPras is a novel  ras GAP molecule.  PMID: 8226805 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",False,"Protein purification technique, no specific research tool"

Stone JC(1), Colleton M, Bottorff D.  Author information: (1)Department of Biochemistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.  The GTPase activity of p21ras is stimulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs)  such as p120GAP and the product of the neurofibromatosis 1 gene, which may  negatively regulate p21 function. GAPs are also proposed effectors of ras. We  have sought activating substitutions in c-H-ras in the region encoding the  effector domain, on the rationale that such mutations would dissociate effector  function from negative regulation by GAP. One such activating mutation,  Pro-34-->Arg, encodes protein that is substantially bound to GTP in vivo. In  vitro, this protein is not stimulated by GAPs, and its binding to p120GAP is  grossly impaired. The results support the idea that the p21 structural  requirements for effector function and GAP interaction are quite different and  suggest that some molecule(s) other than p120GAP serves as the ras effector. In  contrast to the results obtained with p120GAP, the Pro-34-->Arg p21 species is  effectively coupled to the raf-1 product, as judged from electrophoretic  mobility shifts of the Raf-1 phosphoprotein.

Johnson MR(1), DeClue JE, Felzmann S, Vass WC, Xu G, White R, Lowy DR.  Author information: (1)Laboratory of Cellular Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda,  Maryland 20892.  The NF1 gene, which is altered in patients with type 1 neurofibromatosis, has  been postulated to function as a tumor suppressor gene. The NF1 protein product  neurofibromin stimulates the intrinsic GTPase activity of active GTP-bound Ras,  thereby inactivating it. Consistent with a tumor suppressor function, we have  found that the introduction of NF1 in melanoma cell lines that are deficient in  neurofibromin inhibited their growth and induced their differentiation. In  addition, overexpression of neurofibromin in NIH 3T3 cells was growth inhibitory  but did not alter the level of GTP.Ras in the cells. Transformation by v-ras,  whose protein product is resistant to GTPase stimulation by neurofibromin, was  inhibited in a cell line overexpressing neurofibromin, while transformation by  v-raf was not altered. The results demonstrate that NF1 is a tumor suppressor  gene that can inhibit Ras-dependent growth by a regulatory mechanism that is  independent of neurofibromin's ability to stimulate Ras GTPase.

Author information: (1)Molecular Medical Genetics Program, Children's Hospital of Western Ontario,  London, Canada.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common, autosomal dominant genetic disorder  with a variety of highly variable symptoms including cutaneous manifestations  (such as café au lait spots), Lisch nodules, plexiform neurofibromas, skeletal  abnormalities, an increased risk for malignancy, and the development of learning  disabilities. The wide clinical variability of expression of the disease  phenotype and high (spontaneous) mutation rate of the NF1 gene indicate that  careful clinical examination of patients and family members is necessary to  provide an accurate diagnosis of the disease. Since very few NF1 mutations have  been identified, and with the apparent lack of a predominant mutation in this  large, highly mutable gene, molecular diagnosis of NF1 will continue to be based  on haplotypes using linkage analysis. Here we report our experiences while  providing a molecular diagnostic service for NF1 in the ethnically diverse  region of south-western Ontario. Molecular diagnoses with at least one  informative probe/enzyme combination are reported for 19 families including two  families requesting prenatal diagnosis for NF1. We have augmented the classical  Southern based approach to linkage analysis with the use of PCR based assays for  molecular linkage. Furthermore, criteria have been established in our laboratory  for executing molecular linkage based on heterozygosity values, recombination  fractions, and the use of intragenic probes/markers.

Easton DF(1), Ponder MA, Huson SM, Ponder BA.  Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, England.  Neurofibromatosis (NF) type 1 (NF1) is notable for its variable expression. To  determine whether variation in expression has an inherited component, we  examined 175 individuals in 48 NF families, including six MZ twin pairs. Three  quantitative traits were scored--number of café-au-lait patches, number of  cutaneous neurofibromas, and head circumference; and five binary traits were  scored--the presence or absence of plexiform neurofibromas, optic gliomas,  scoliosis, epilepsy, and referral for remedial education. For café-au-lait  patches and neurofibromas, correlation was highest between MZ twins, less high  between first-degree relatives, and lower still between more distant relatives.  The high correlation between MZ twins suggests a strong genetic component in  variation of expression, but the low correlation between distant relatives  suggests that the type of mutation at the NF1 locus itself plays only a minor  role. All of the five binary traits, with the exception of plexiform  neurofibromas, also showed significant familial clustering. The familial effects  for these traits were consistent with polygenic effects, but there were  insufficient data to rule out other models, including a significant effect of  different NF1 mutations. There was no evidence of any association between the  different traits in affected individuals. We conclude that the phenotypic  expression of NF1 is to a large extent determined by the genotype at other  ""modifying"" loci and that these modifying genes are trait specific.

Gregory PE(1), Gutmann DH, Mitchell A, Park S, Boguski M, Jacks T, Wood DL, Jove  R, Collins FS.  Author information: (1)Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann  Arbor 48109.  The neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene was recently identified by positional  cloning and found to encode a protein with structural and functional homology to  mammalian and yeast GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Using antibodies directed  against the NF1 gene product, a protein of approximately 250 kDa was identified  and termed neurofibromin. Double-indirect immunofluorescent labeling with  anti-neurofibromin and anti-tubulin antibodies demonstrates that neurofibromin  associates with cytoplasmic microtubules. Immunoblotting of microtubule-enriched  cytoplasmic fractions, using antibodies generated against neurofibromin, shows  that neurofibromin copurifies with microtubules. When portions of neurofibromin  are expressed in Sf9 insect cells they associate with polymerized microtubules;  furthermore, the critical residues for this interaction reside within the  GAP-related domain of neurofibromin.

Kobayashi M(1), Hashimoto N, Hoshino M, Hattori S, Iwashita S.  Author information: (1)Mitsubishi Kasei Institute of Life Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.  Using octyl glucoside-solubilized cell extracts from human fibroblasts during  growth phase to G0/G1 arrest state, we found that while the number of M(r) 120  kDa rasGTPase-activating protein (p120GAP) molecules per cell decreases to half  its original levels, the amount of neurofibromatosis type 1 gene product (NF1, a  neurofibromin) remains constant during the transition. The contribution of  p120GAP to the total rasGTPase-activating (rasGA) activity in growing cells was  found to be larger than that observed in arrested cells (84% vs 53%). On the  other hand, NF1 contributes less than 15% of the total rasGA activity in either  extract. These results indicate that the qualitative changes occur in the  contributors to rasGA activity during transition. They also suggest that a  unique rasGA activity exists in the arrested cells, which was obtained  separately from both p120GAP and NF1 by heparin-Sepharose column chromatography.

Nakafuku M(1), Nagamine M, Ohtoshi A, Tanaka K, Toh-e A, Kaziro Y.  Author information: (1)DNAX Research Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Palo Alto, CA  94304-1104.  NF1 was first identified as the gene responsible for the pathogenesis of the  human genetic disorder neurofibromatosis type 1. cDNA cloning revealed that its  putative protein product has a domain showing significant sequence homology with  the mammalian Ras GTPase activating protein and two yeast Saccharomyces  cerevisiae proteins, Ira1 and Ira2. The Ras GTPase activating protein-related  domain of the NF1 gene product (NF1-GRD) stimulates GTPase activity of normal  Ras proteins but not of oncogenic mutant Ras from both mammalian and yeast  cells. Thus, in yeast, NF1-GRD can suppress the heat-shock-sensitive phenotype  of ira- cells but not the same phenotype of activated RAS such as RAS2Val19 and  RAS2Leu68. We have screened a pool of mutagenized NF1 expression plasmids and  obtained two mutant NF1 cDNA clones that can suppress the heat-shock-sensitive  phenotype of RAS2Val19 cells. One clone (NF201) suppressed RAS2Leu68, RAS2Ser41,  and RAS2Val19, whereas another clone (NF204) preferentially suppressed  RAS2Val19. When expressed in mammalian cells, these mutant NF1-GRDs were able to  induce the morphological reversion of v-ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells. Both  wild-type and mutant NF1-GRDs can stimulate the GTPase activity of normal but  not transforming Ras. We suggest that mutant NF1-GRDs may bind tightly to  transforming Ras, which stays in GTP-bound conformation, thus preventing the  interaction with the putative effector molecule. On the other hand, normal Ras  cannot be sequestered since the bound GTP is rapidly hydrolyzed upon interaction  with mutant NF1-GRD to yield Ras-GDP, which is readily released from the NF1-GRD  and recycled.

Andersen LB(1), Ballester R, Marchuk DA, Chang E, Gutmann DH, Saulino AM,  Camonis J, Wigler M, Collins FS.  Author information: (1)Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan  48109.  Sequence analysis has shown significant homology between the catalytic regions  of the mammalian ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP), yeast Ira1p and Ira2p  (inhibitory regulators of the RAS-cyclic AMP pathway), and neurofibromin, the  protein encoded by the NF1 gene. Yeast expression experiments have confirmed  that a 381-amino-acid segment of neurofibromin, dubbed the GAP-related domain  (GRD), can function as a GAP. Using the RNA polymerase chain reaction with  primers flanking the NF1-GRD, we have identified evidence for alternative  splicing in this region of the NF1 gene. In addition to the already published  sequence (type I), an alternative RNA carrying a 63-nucleotide insertion (type  II) is present in all tissues examined, although the relative amounts of types I  and II vary. The insertion is conserved across species but is not present in  GAP, IRA1, or IRA2. GenBank searches have failed to identify significant  similarity between the inserted sequence and known DNA or protein sequences,  although the basic amino acid composition of the insertion shares features with  nuclear targeting sequences. Expression studies in yeasts show that despite the  partial disruption of the neurofibromin-IRA-GAP homology by this insertion, both  forms of the NF1-GRD can complement loss of IRA function. In vivo assays  designed to compare the GAP activity of the two alternatively spliced forms of  the NF1-GRD show that both can increase the conversion of GTP-bound ras to its  GDP-bound form, although the insertion of the 21 amino acids weakens this  effect. The strong conservation of this alternative splicing suggests that both  type I and II isoforms mediate important biological functions of neurofibromin.

Author information: (1)Department of Medicine and Pharmacology, UCSD Cancer Center, La Jolla 92093.  The regulation of the GTPase activity of the Ras proteins is thought to be a key  element of signal transduction. Ras proteins have intrinsic GTPase activity and  are active in signal transduction when bound to GTP but not following hydrolysis  of GTP to GDP. Three cellular Ras GTPase-activating proteins (Ras-gaps) which  increase the GTPase activity of wild-type (wt) Ras but not activated Ras in  vitro have been identified: type I and type II GAP and type I NF1. Mutations of  wt Ras resulting in lowered intrinsic GTPase activity or loss of response to  cellular Ras-gap proteins are thought to be the primary reason for the  transforming properties of the Ras proteins. In vitro assays show type I and  type II GAP and the GAP-related domain of type I NF1 to have similar biochemical  properties with respect to activation of the wt Ras GTPase, and it appears as  though both type I GAP and NF1 can modulate the GTPase function of Ras in cells.  Here we report the assembling of a full-length coding clone for type I NF1 and  the biological effects of microinjection of Ras and Ras-gap proteins into  fibroblasts. We have found that type I GAP, type II GAP, and type I NF1 show  markedly different biological activities in vivo. Coinjection of type I GAP or  type I NF1, but not type II GAP, with wt Ras abolished the ability of wt Ras to  induce expression from an AP-1-controlled reporter gene. We also found that  serum-stimulated DNA synthesis was reduced by prior injection of cells with type  I GAP but not type II GAP or type I NF1. These results suggest that type I GAP,  type II GAP, and type I NF1 may have different activities in vivo and support  the hypothesis that while type I forms of GAP and NF1 may act as negative  regulators of wt Ras, they may do so with differential efficiencies.

Upadhyaya M(1), Maynard J, Osborn M, Huson SM, Ponder M, Ponder BA, Harper PS.  Author information: (1)Institute of Medical Genetics, University of Wales, College of Medicine,  Health Park, Cardiff, UK.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 is one of the most common inherited disorders with an  incidence of 1 in 3000. The search for NF1 mutations has been hampered by the  overall size of the gene, the large number of exons, and the high mutation rate.  To date, fewer than 90 mutations have been reported to the NF1 mutation analysis  consortium and the details on 76 mutations have been published. We have  identified five new mutations using single strand conformation polymorphism  (SSCP) and heteroduplex analysis (HA) and three intragenic deletions with the  microsatellite markers. Of the five new mutations, two were in exon 27a, two in  exon 45, and one in exon 49 and these include 4630delA, 4572delC, R7846X,  T7828A, and one in the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR). The two nucleotide  alterations in exon 27a and the one in exon 45 are predicted to produce a  truncated protein.

Author information: (1)Department of Cell Biology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine,  Ohio 45267-0521, USA.  To identify cell type(s) that might contribute to nerve sheath tumors  (neurofibromas) in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1, we generated cell  cultures containing neurons. Schwann cells and fibroblasts from transgenic mouse  embryos in which the type 1 neurofibromatosis gene was disrupted by homologous  recombination (Brannan et al. (1994) Genes Development, 8,1019-1029). Normal  fascicle formation by perineurial cells failed to occur in the absence of  neurofibromin. Fascicles were reduced in number and showed abnormal morphology  when normal neurons and Schwann cells were cultured up to 37 days with  fibroblasts lacking neurofibromin. Proliferation was increased in a majority of  fibroblast cell strains analyzed from embryos lacking neurofibromin. These  observations suggest that mutations in the neurofibromatosis type I gene affect  fibroblast behavior that might contribute to neurofibroma formation in patients  with neurofibromatosis type 1.

A functional mooring sequence, known to be required for apolipoprotein B (apoB)  mRNA editing, exists in the mRNA encoding the neurofibromatosis type I (NF1)  tumor suppressor. Editing of NF1 mRNA modifies cytidine in an arginine codon  (CGA) at nucleotide 2914 to a uridine (UGA), creating an in frame translation  stop codon. NF1 editing occurs in normal tissue but was several-fold higher in  tumors. In vitro editing and transfection assays demonstrated that apoB and NF1  RNA editing will take place in both neural tumor and hepatoma cells. Unlike  apoB, NF1 editing did not demonstrate dependence on rate-limiting quantities of  APOBEC-1 (the apoB editing catalytic subunit) suggesting that different  trans-acting factors may be involved in the two editing processes.

Izawa I(1), Tamaki N, Saya H.  Author information: (1)Department of Neurosurgery, Kobe University School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.  The critical function of the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene product  (neurofibromin) is not well defined except that neurofibromin has homology with  a family of the GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). In this study, we confirmed  that neurofibromin is constitutively phosphorylated and detected kinase  activities which specifically phosphorylate the cysteine/serine-rich domain and  the C-terminal domain of the neurofibromin in cell lysate. In vitro and in-gel  kinase assays strongly indicated that cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is a  candidate for the neurofibromin kinase. THe biological significance of the  phosphorylation of neurofibromin is unclear at present, but we speculate that  neurofibromin plays a crucial role in cellular function since it links the two  major cellular pathways which are the GAP-ras and PKA-associated signals.

Englander EW(1), Howard BH.  Author information: (1)Laboratory of Molecular Growth Regulation, NICHD, National Institutes of  Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-2753, USA.  The nature of chromatin organization over Alu repetitive elements is of interest  with respect to the maintenance of their transcriptional silencing as well as  their potential to influence local chromatin structure. We previously  demonstrated that the pattern of nucleosomal organization over Alu elements in  native chromatin is specific and similar to the pattern observed with an in  vitro reconstituted Alu template. This pattern, distinguished by a nucleosome  centered over the 5 -end of the Alu element, is associated with repression of  polymerase III-dependent transcription in vitro (Englander, E. W., Wolffe, A.  P., and Howard, B. H. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 19565-19573; Englander, E. W.,  and Howard, B. H. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 10091-10096). In the current study,  additional templates representing both evolutionarily old and young Alu  subfamilies were found to direct a similar pattern of nucleosome assembly,  consistent with the view that nucleosome positioning in vitro is shared by a  majority of Alus. We discovered however, that the specific nucleosome  positioning pattern was disrupted over one member of a young Alu subfamily,  which recently transposed immediately downstream to a T14A11 sequence in the  neurofibromatosis type 1 locus (Wallace, M. R., Andersen, L. B., Saulino, A. M.,  Gregory, P. E., Glover, T. W., and Collins, F. S. (1991) Nature 353, 864-866).  Upon removal of this sequence motif, the expected pattern of assembly was  restored to the neurofibromatosis type 1-Alu template. This finding indicates  that, at least in vitro, certain sequences can override the propensity for  positioning nucleosomes that is inherent to Alu elements. The finding also  raises the possibility that a similar situation may occur in vivo, with  potential implications for understanding mechanisms by which certain Alu  elements may evade chromatin-mediated transcriptional silencing.

Feigenbaum L(1), Fujita K, Collins FS, Jay G.  Author information: (1)Department of Virology, Jerome H. Holland Laboratory, Rockville, Maryland  20855, USA.  In familial neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), individuals with a germ  line-transmitted NF1 mutation develop multiple neurofibromas. To explain the  observation that transgenic mice expressing the human T-lymphotropic virus type  1 (HTLV-1) tax gene under the control of the viral regulatory element also  develop multiple neurofibromas, we demonstrate that the Tax trans-regulator can  functionally repress NF1 gene expression through a cis-acting element located  immediately upstream of its transcriptional start site, thereby allowing the  development of benign neurofibromas without the need for direct mutations in  NF1. We propose that such a mechanism would suffice to epigenetically alter NF1  gene expression. The fact that transgenic animals have localized rather than  diffuse neurofibroma formation, however, suggests that additional genetic or  epigenetic events may be required for neurofibroma formation.

Three exon-based polymorphisms--at positions  702, 2034, and 10647 in the NF1 cDNA--were genotyped by mutagenically separated  PCR (MS-PCR). A fourth polymorphism, DV1.9, is an L1 insertion element in intron  30, and the other two polymorphisms, GXAlu and EVI-20, are short tandem repeats  in intron 27b. All the polymorphisms were evaluated in a cohort of 110 CEPH  individuals who previously had been analyzed by use of eight RFLPs at the NF1  locus. Pairwise linkage-disequilibrium analyses with the six PCR-based  polymorphisms and their flanking markers demonstrated disequilibrium between all  tested loci. Genotypes of the four diallelic polymorphisms (702, 2034, 10647,  and DV1.9) were also evaluated in cohorts from the CEPH, African, and Japanese  populations.

McCartney BM(1), Fehon RG.  Author information: (1)Department of Zoology, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27708-1000,  USA.  Interest in members of the protein 4.1 super-family, which includes the  ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) group, has been stimulated recently by the discovery  that the human neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene encodes an  ERM-like protein, merlin. Although many proteins in this family are thought to  act by linking the actin-based cytoskeleton to transmembrane proteins, the  cellular functions of merlin have not been defined. To investigate the cellular  and developmental functions of these proteins, we have identified and  characterized Drosophila homologues of moesin (Dmoesin) and of the NF2 tumor  suppressor merlin (Dmerlin). Using specific antibodies, we show that although  these proteins are frequently coexpressed in developing tissues, they display  distinct subcellular localizations. While Dmoesin is observed in continuous  association with the plasma membrane, as is typical for an ERM family protein,  Dmerlin is found in punctuate structures at the membrane and in the cytoplasm.  Investigation of Dmerlin cultured cells demonstrates that it is associated with  endocytic compartments. As a result of these studies, we propose that the merlin  protein has unique functions in the cell which differ from those of other ERM  family members.

Author information: (1)Genetic Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD  20892-7360, USA.  Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) features bilateral vestibular schwannomas, other  benign neural tumors, and cataracts. Patients in some families develop many  tumors at an early age and have rapid clinical progression, whereas in other  families, patients may not have symptoms until much later and vestibular  schwannomas may be the only tumors. The NF2 gene has been cloned from chromosome  22q; most identified germ-line mutations result in a truncated protein and  severe NF2. To look for additional mutations and clinical correlations, we used  SSCP analysis to screen DNA from 32 unrelated patients. We identified 20  different mutations in 21 patients (66%): 10 nonsense mutations, 2 frameshifts,  7 splice-site mutations, and 1 large in-frame deletion. Clinical information on  47 patients from the 21 families included ages at onset and at diagnosis,  numbers of meningiomas, spinal and skin tumors, and presence of cataracts and  retinal abnormalities. We compared clinical findings in patients with nonsense  or frameshift mutations to those with splice-site mutations. When each patient  was considered as an independent random event, the two groups differed (P < or =  .05) for nearly every variable. Patients with nonsense or frameshift mutations  were younger at onset and at diagnosis and had a higher frequency and mean  number of tumors, supporting the correlation between nonsense and frameshift  mutations and severe NF2. When each family was considered as an independent  random event, statistically significant differences between the two groups were  observed only for mean ages at onset and at diagnosis. A larger data set is  needed to resolve these discrepancies. We observed retinal hamartomas and/or  epiretinal membranes in nine patients from five families with four different  nonsense mutations. This finding, which may represent a new genotype-phenotype  correlation, merits further study.

Author information: (1)Department of Medicine, University of Rochester School of Medicine and  Dentistry, New York 14642, USA.  The rat neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) gene expresses several transcript  isoforms which differ by the alternative splicing of exons 23a and 23b in the  region encoding the GTPase-activating protein-related domain. The significance  of this alternative splicing event is unclear and the factors which influence  isoform expression are largely unknown. Here we show that a variety of factors  can modulate the expression of these isoforms in PC12 cells. Nerve growth factor  and dexamethasone lead to an increase in the type I isoform concurrent with a  decrease in cellular proliferation. Upregulation of the type I isoform by  dexamethasone occurs in an RNA synthesis-dependent manner. Cycloheximide  treatment leads to the detection of an additional species identified as the  murine type III transcript. These results suggest that the NF1 alternative  splicing event can respond to environmental cues. The changes in the type of NF1  transcript expressed may be important in the normal physiological regulation of  neurofibromin and may modulate its role in differentiation and proliferation.

We have cloned the full-length cDNA encoding the rat homolog of type I  neurofibromin isoform, a protein product of a gene linked to neurofibromatosis  type 1. Rat type I neurofibromin isoform is composed of 2,820 amino acid  residues and shares about 98.5% amino acid identity with the human counterpart.  By S1 nuclease mapping analysis of the alternatively spliced neurofibromin mRNAs  in adult rat tissues, we showed that type I isoform mRNA was predominantly  expressed in the brain, pituitary, and testis, while type II mRNA, carrying a  63-nucleotide insertion in the region coding for the domain related to  GTPase-activating protein, was predominantly expressed in most other tissues,  such as heart, kidney, and ovary. Furthermore, type II mRNA is predominant in  the testis at age 1 week, while type I mRNA becomes predominant at 3 weeks and  is subsequently expressed at higher levels, as seen in the adult testis. In  contrast, type I mRNA is the predominant form in the brain throughout the  postnatal development. Thus, the relative expression levels of type I and type  II mRNAs may be specific to the tissues and to the developmental stage of  certain tissues.

Kim HA(1), Ling B, Ratner N.  Author information: (1)Department of Cell Biology, Neurobiology and Anatomy, University of  Cincinnati College of Medicine, Ohio 45267-0521, USA.  We have developed a potential model of Schwann cell tumor formation in  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). We show that mouse Schwann cells heterozygous or  null at Nf1 display angiogenic and invasive properties, mimicking the behavior  of Schwann cells from human neurofibromas. Mutations at Nf1 are insufficient to  promote Schwann cell hyperplasia. Here we show that Schwann cell hyperplasia can  be induced by protein kinase A activation in mutant cells. Removal of serum from  the culture medium also stimulates hyperplasia, but only in some mutant cells.  After serum removal, clones of hyperproliferating Schwann cells lose contact  with axons in vitro, develop growth factor-independent proliferation, and  exhibit decreased expression of the cell differentiation marker P0 protein;  hyperproliferating cells develop after a 1-week lag in Schwann cells  heterozygous at Nf1. The experiments suggest that events subsequent to Nf1  mutations are required for development of Schwann cell hyperplasia. Finally, an  anti-Ras farnesyl protein transferase inhibitor greatly diminished both clone  formation and hyperproliferation of null mutant cells, but not invasion;  farnesyl transferase inhibitors could be useful in treating benign  manifestations of NF1.

Griesser J(1), Kaufmann D, Maier B, Mailhammer R, Kuehl P, Krone W.  Author information: (1)Department of Human Genetics, University of Ulm, Germany.  Among the symptoms that characterize neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are  pigmentation anomalies such as cafe au lait spots. It has been suggested that  the reduction of the neurofibromin level in the epidermis of NF1 patients is  responsible for the observed signs such as altered melanogenesis and altered  density of melanocytes. Our studies show that in cultured normal human  melanocytes, the neurofibromin level can be varied in vitro over a wide range by  using different culture conditions. The influence of factors that control  differentiation and proliferation of melanocytes on neurofibromin levels was  studied. Immunoprecipitation followed by western blotting showed a 3- to 4-fold  increase of neurofibromin after stimulation by PMA or bFGF, respectively, and a  1.5-fold increase in cells stimulated with steel factor. The increase of  neurofibromin was not paralleled by a higher NF1 mRNA level as proved by  northern blotting. Pulse-chase experiments with 35S-labeled melanocytes revealed  an approximately 3-fold increase in the half-life of neurofibromin in bFGF- or  PMA-stimulated cells compared to controls. These results indicate that the  neurofibromin level of cultured melanocytes can be regulated by a mechanism  independent of NF1 gene transcription and translation, which might influence the  degradation rate of the protein.

Mazarakis ND(1), Yannoutsos N, el-Jabbour JN, Hatton W, Fletcher R, Grosveld F.  Author information: (1)Norman and Sadie Lee Research Centre, Division of Neurobiology, National  Institute for Medical Research, London, UK.  BACKGROUND: Animal models of carcinogenesis have been produced in transgenic  mice by directing the expression of oncogenes such as SV40 T antigen and myc to  different tissues by creating fusions with promoter/enhancer elements of various  mammalian or viral genes. RESULTS: A transgenic mouse line was created in which SV40 T antigen is under  the control of the mouse nerve growth factor (NGF) promoter. While the oncogene  is expressed in a wide range of NGF producing tissues, it specifically causes  the development of either neurofibromas or neurofibrosarcomas similar to those  found in the human disease neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). These tumours are  completely penetrant and appear after a mean latency of about 8 months. In  contrast to the previously reported neurofibromatosis mouse model HTLV-1 tax,  the tumours in these transgenic mice arise in Schwann cells rather than  perineural fibroblasts and have a very restricted tissue distribution. In a cell  line cloned from a neurofibroma from these mice, NGF was detected in the culture  medium at levels similar to those produced by cultured primary Schwann cells. CONCLUSION: As all animal model for a heritable neurocristopathy resembling NF1,  this mouse should allow study of the pathology and treatment of this disease.

Author information: (1)Department of Zoology, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27708-1000,  USA. rfehon@acpub.duke.edu  Reverse genetic analysis in Drosophila has been greatly aided by a growing  collection of lethal P transposable element insertions that provide molecular  tags for the identification of essential genetic loci. However, because the  screens performed to date primarily have generated autosomal P-element  insertions, this collection has not been as useful for performing reverse  genetic analysis of X-linked genes. We have designed a reverse genetic screen  that takes advantage of the hemizygosity of the X chromosome in males together  with a cosmid-based transgene that serves as an autosomally linked duplication  of a small region of the X chromosome. The efficacy and efficiency of this  method is demonstrated by the isolation of mutations in Drosophila homologues of  two well-studied genes, the human Neurofibromatosis 2 tumor suppressor and the  yeast CDC42 gene. The method we describe should be of general utility for the  isolation of mutations in other X-linked genes, and should also provide an  efficient method for the isolation of new allcles of existing X-linked or  autosomal mutations in Drosophila.

Colman SD(1), Abernathy CR, Ho VT, Wallace MR.  Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, University of Florida College of Medicine,  Gainesville 32610-0296, USA.  We have been using heteroduplex analysis to assay individual exons within the  NF1 gene in an effort to identify disease causing constitutional mutations in  neurofibromatosis type 1 patients. Here we report the identification and  characterisation of four insertional NF1 frameshift mutations in an analysis of  exons 28-39 in a set of 78 patients. These include three 1 base pair insertions  and one 2 base pair insertion. Three of these mutations can be attributed to  replication slippage errors, while the mechanism behind the fourth may be  related to formation of secondary structure during replication. It may be of  significance that a majority of the previously reported small insertions in NF1  also lie within exons 28-39.

Jacoby LB(1), Jones D, Davis K, Kronn D, Short MP, Gusella J, MacCollin M.  Author information: (1)Neurosurgical Service, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown 02129,  USA.  Patients with multiple schwannomas without vestibular schwannomas have been  postulated to compose a distinct subclass of neurofibromatosis (NF), termed  ""schwannomatosis."" To compare the molecular-genetic basis of schwannomatosis  with NF2, we examined the NF2 locus in 20 unrelated schwannomatosis patients and  their affected relatives. Tumors from these patients frequently harbored typical  truncating mutations of the NF2 gene and loss of heterozygosity of the  surrounding region of chromosome 22. Surprisingly, unlike patients with NF2, no  heterozygous NF2-gene changes were seen in normal tissues. Examination of  multiple tumors from the same patient revealed that some schwannomatosis  patients are somatic mosaics for NF2-gene changes. By contrast, other  individuals, particularly those with a positive family history, appear to have  an inherited predisposition to formation of tumors that carry somatic  alterations of the NF2 gene. Further work is needed to define the pathogenetics  of this unusual disease mechanism.

Murthy A(1), Gonzalez-Agosti C, Cordero E, Pinney D, Candia C, Solomon F,  Gusella J, Ramesh V.  Author information: (1)Molecular Neurogenetics Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown  02129, USA.  We have identified the human homologue of a regulatory cofactor of Na(+)-H+  exchanger (NHE-RF) as a novel interactor for merlin, the neurofibromatosis 2  tumor suppressor protein. NHE-RF mediates protein kinase A regulation of  Na(+)-H+ exchanger NHE3 to which it is thought to bind via one of its two PDZ  domains. The carboxyl-terminal region of NHE-RF, downstream of the PDZ domains,  interacts with the amino-terminal protein 4.1 domain-containing segment of  merlin in yeast two-hybrid assays. This interaction also occurs in affinity  binding assays with full-length NHE-RF expressed in COS-7 cells. NHE-RF binds to  the related ERM proteins, moesin and radixin. We have localized human NHE-RF to  actin-rich structures such as membrane ruffles, microvilli, and filopodia in  HeLa and COS-7 cells, where it co-localizes with merlin and moesin. These  findings suggest that hNHE-RF and its binding partners may participate in a  larger complex (one component of which might be a Na(+)-H+ exchanger) that could  be crucial for the actin filament assembly activated by the ERM proteins and for  the tumor suppressor function of merlin.

Author information: (1)Institut für Neuropathologie, Universitätsklinikum Bonn, Germany.  umt907@ibm.rhrz.uni-bonn.de  The specific analysis of gene transcripts is of increasing importance for  studies in molecular pathology. Competitive RT-PCR with mutagenized exogenous  competitor templates has evolved as an attractive approach to quantify  individual mRNA levels. The generation of exogenous competitor RNAs usually  requires mutagenesis and cloning of the mutant fragment into plasmids followed  by in vitro transcription. In contrast to primer directed mutagenesis and in  vitro transcription, preparation of the mutant fragments is a time consuming  procedure. Here we report on a modified semi-quantitative RT-PCR protocol to  circumvent the laborious cloning of mutant exogenous competitors. Templates for  the in vitro transcription are generated in a single PCR reaction with  simultaneous addition of a promoter sequence 5'of the forward primer and  deletion of 10-20 nucleotides at the opposite end just ahead of the reverse  primer binding site. The product of this PCR step serves as template for in  vitro transcription to yield exogenous competitor RNA of equal quality and  amount as conventional cloning strategies. Total RNA amounts are corrected for  by analyzing the expression of different housekeeping genes in the same manner.  One of the primers used in the following competitive RT-PCR reaction is labeled  with a fluorescent dye for the analysis of target and exogenous competitor  product on an semiautomated sequencer. In the present study, this protocol was  employed to analyze the expression of the PTCH, Fas-receptor, NF-1,  beta2-microglobulin and GAPD genes in human brain tumors. It will, however, be  widely applicable to studies on cellular transcripts in biological specimens.

PMID:9516485,"Regulation of the neurofibromatosis type 2 tumor suppressor protein, merlin, by adhesion and growth arrest stimuli.","Regulation of the neurofibromatosis type 2 tumor suppressor protein, merlin, by  adhesion and growth arrest stimuli.  Shaw RJ(1), McClatchey AI, Jacks T.  Author information: (1)Center for Cancer Research and Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute  of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA.  The neurofibromatosis type 2 tumor suppressor gene is inactivated in the  development of familial and sporadic schwannomas and meningiomas. The encoded  protein, Merlin, is closely related to the Ezrin, Radixin, and Moesin family of  membrane/cytoskeletal linker proteins. Examination of Merlin in several cell  lines revealed that the protein migrates as two distinct species near 70 kDa.  Phosphatase treatment and orthophosphate labeling demonstrated that the species  with decreased mobility is phosphorylated. Given Merlin's localization to  cortical actin structures, we examined the effect of cell-cell contact or other  forms of growth arrest on Merlin expression and post-translational modification.  Under conditions of confluency or serum deprivation, the levels of  phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Merlin species increased significantly.  Cells arrested in G1 by other methods or other phases of the cell cycle did not  show changes in Merlin levels. Furthermore, loss of adhesion resulted in a  nearly complete dephosphorylation of Merlin, which was reversed upon re-plating  of cells, suggesting Merlin phosphorylation may be responsive to cell spreading  or changes in cell shape. Thus, the tumor suppressor function of Merlin may  involve the regulation of cellular responses to cues such as cell-cell contact,  growth factor microenvironment, or changes in cell shape.

PMID:9560242,A role for Pak protein kinases in Schwann cell transformation.,"A role for Pak protein kinases in Schwann cell transformation.  Tang Y(1), Marwaha S, Rutkowski JL, Tennekoon GI, Phillips PC, Field J.  Author information: (1)Department of Pharmacology, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine,  Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a common autosomal dominant disorder caused by  loss of the NF1 gene, is characterized clinically by neurofibromas and more  rarely by neurofibrosarcomas. Neurofibromin, the protein encoded by NF1,  possesses an intrinsic GTPase accelerating activity for the Ras proto-oncogene.  Through this activity, it is a negative regulator of Ras. The Pak protein kinase  is a candidate for a downstream signaling protein that may mediate Ras signals  because it is activated by Rac and Cdc42, two small G proteins required for Ras  signaling. Here, we use Pak mutants to explore the role of Pak in Ras signaling  in Schwann cells, the cells affected in NF1. Whereas an activated Pak mutant  does not transform cells, dominant negative Pak mutants are potent inhibitors of  Ras transformation of rat Schwann cells and of a neurofibrosarcoma cell line  from an NF1 patient. Although activated Pak stimulated jun-N-terminal kinase,  inhibition of Ras transformation by dominant negative Pak did not require  inhibition of jun-N-terminal kinase. Instead, the Pak mutants appeared to  inhibit transformation by preventing Ras activation of the ERK/mitogen-activated  protein kinase cascade. These results have implications for our understanding of  NF1 because a neurofibrosarcoma cell line derived from a patient with NF1 was  reverted by stable expression of the Pak dominant negative mutants.

PMID:9607929,Nf1 regulates hematopoietic progenitor cell growth and ras signaling in response to multiple cytokines.,"Nf1 regulates hematopoietic progenitor cell growth and ras signaling in response  to multiple cytokines.  Zhang YY(1), Vik TA, Ryder JW, Srour EF, Jacks T, Shannon K, Clapp DW.  Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine,  Indianapolis, Indiana 46202, USA.  Neurofibromin, the protein encoded by the NF1 tumor-suppressor gene, negatively  regulates the output of p21(ras) (Ras) proteins by accelerating the hydrolysis  of active Ras-guanosine triphosphate to inactive Ras-guanosine diphosphate.  Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are predisposed to juvenile chronic  myelogenous leukemia (JCML) and other malignant myeloid disorders, and  heterozygous Nf1 knockout mice spontaneously develop a myeloid disorder that  resembles JCML. Both human and murine leukemias show loss of the normal allele.  JCML cells and Nf1-/- hematopoietic cells isolated from fetal livers selectively  form abnormally high numbers of colonies derived from granulocyte-macrophage  progenitors in cultures supplemented with low concentrations of  granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Taken together, these  data suggest that neurofibromin is required to downregulate Ras activation in  myeloid cells exposed to GM-CSF. We have investigated the growth and  proliferation of purified populations of hematopoietic progenitor cells isolated  from Nf1 knockout mice in response to the cytokines interleukin (IL)-3 and stem  cell factor (SCF), as well as to GM-CSF. We found abnormal proliferation of both  immature and lineage-restricted progenitor populations, and we observed  increased synergy between SCF and either IL-3 or GM-CSF in Nf1-/- progenitors.  Nf1-/- fetal livers also showed an absolute increase in the numbers of immature  progenitors. We further demonstrate constitutive activation of the Ras-Raf-MAP  (mitogen-activated protein) kinase signaling pathway in primary c-kit+ Nf1-/-  progenitors and hyperactivation of MAP kinase after growth factor stimulation.  The results of these experiments in primary hematopoietic cells implicate Nf1 as  playing a central role in regulating the proliferation and survival of primitive  and lineage-restricted myeloid progenitors in response to multiple cytokines by  modulating Ras output.

Scheffzek K(1), Ahmadian MR, Wiesmüller L, Kabsch W, Stege P, Schmitz F,  Wittinghofer A.  Author information: (1)Max-Planck-Institut für molekulare Physiologie, Dortmund, Germany.  Klas.Scheffzek@mpi-dortmund.mpg.de  Neurofibromin is the product of the NF1 gene, whose alteration is responsible  for the pathogenesis of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most frequent  genetic disorders in man. It acts as a GTPase activating protein (GAP) on Ras;  based on homology to p120GAP, a segment spanning 250-400 aa and termed  GAP-related domain (NF1GRD; 25-40 kDa) has been shown to be responsible for GAP  activity and represents the only functionally defined segment of neurofibromin.  Missense mutations found in NF1 patients map to NF1GRD, underscoring its  importance for pathogenesis. X-ray crystallographic analysis of a  proteolytically treated catalytic fragment of NF1GRD comprising residues  1198-1530 (NF1-333) of human neurofibromin reveals NF1GRD as a helical protein  that resembles the corresponding fragment derived from p120GAP (GAP-334). A  central domain (NF1c) containing all residues conserved among RasGAPs is coupled  to an extra domain (NF1ex), which despite very limited sequence homology is  surprisingly similar to the corresponding part of GAP-334. Numerous point  mutations found in NF1 patients or derived from genetic screening protocols can  be analysed on the basis of the three-dimensional structural model, which also  allows identification of the site where structural changes in a differentially  spliced isoform are to be expected. Based on the structure of the complex  between Ras and GAP-334 described earlier, a model of the NF1GRD-Ras complex is  proposed which is used to discuss the strikingly different properties of the  Ras-p120GAP and Ras-neurofibromin interactions.

Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, California  94305-5324, USA.  The neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene encodes merlin, a  protein with homology to the cell membrane/F-actin linking proteins, moesin,  ezrin and radixin. Unlike these closely related proteins, merlin lacks a  C-terminal F-actin binding site detectable by actin blot overlays, and the  GFP-tagged merlin C-terminal domain co-distributes with neither stress fibers  nor cortical actin in NIH3T3 cells. Merlin also differs from the other three  proteins in its inter- and intramolecular domain interactions, as shown by in  vitro binding and yeast two-hybrid assays. As is true for ezrin, moesin and  radixin, the N- and C-terminal domains of merlin type 1 bind to each other.  However, full-length merlin and its N- and C-terminal domains, as well as the  C-terminal domain of ezrin, interact with other full-length merlin type 1  molecules, and its C-terminal domain interacts with itself. Merlin 1 function in  cells may thus depend on intra- and intermolecular interactions and their  modulation, which include interactions with other members of this protein  family.

Author information: (1)Department of Cell Biology, Neurobiology and Anatomy, University of  Cincinnati College of Medicine, 231 Bethesda Avenue, Cincinnati, OH, 45267-0521,  USA.  Brains from human neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients show increased  expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), consistent with activation  of astrocytes (M.L. Nordlund, T.A. Rizvi, C.I. Brannan, N. Ratner, Neurofibromin  expression and astrogliosis in neurofibromatosis (type 1) brains, J.  Neuropathol. Exp. Neurology 54 (1995) 588-600). We analyzed brains from  transgenic mice in which the Nf1 gene was targeted by homologous recombination.  We show here that, in all heterozygous mice analyzed, there are increased  numbers of astrocytes expressing high levels of GFAP in medial regions of the  periaqueductal gray and in the nucleus accumbens. More subtle, but significant,  changes in the number of GFAP positive astrocytes were observed in the  hippocampus in 60% of mutant mice analyzed. Astrocytes with elevated GFAP were  present at 1 month, 2 months, 6 months and 12 months after birth. Most brain  regions, including the cerebellum, basal ganglia, cerebral cortex, hypothalamus,  thalamus, cortical amygdaloid area, and white matter tracts did not show any  gliotic changes. No evidence of degenerating neurons was found using de Olmos'  cupric silver stain. We conclude that Nf1/nf1 mice provide a model to study  astrogliosis associated with neurofibromatosis type 1.
