PMID:31545171,Optical dopamine monitoring with dLight1 reveals mesolimbic phenotypes in a mouse model of neurofibromatosis type 1.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder whose neurodevelopmental symptoms include impaired executive function, attention, and spatial learning and could be due to perturbed mesolimbic dopaminergic circuitry. However, these circuits have never been directly assayed in vivo. We employed the genetically encoded optical dopamine sensor dLight1 to monitor dopaminergic neurotransmission in the ventral striatum of NF1 mice during motivated behavior. Additionally, we developed novel systemic AAV vectors to facilitate morphological reconstruction of dopaminergic populations in cleared tissue. We found that NF1 mice exhibit reduced spontaneous dopaminergic neurotransmission that was associated with excitation/inhibition imbalance in the ventral tegmental area and abnormal neuronal morphology. NF1 mice also had more robust dopaminergic and behavioral responses to salient visual stimuli, which were independent of learning, and rescued by optogenetic inhibition of non-dopaminergic neurons in the VTA. Overall, these studies provide a first in vivo characterization of dopaminergic circuit function in the context of NF1 and reveal novel pathophysiological mechanisms.","Materials and methods Key resources table Reagent type  (species) or resource Designation Source or reference Identifiers Additional  information Antibody Anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (Rabbit polyclonal) EMD Millipore Cat#: AB152  RRID: AB_390204 IHC (1:1000) Antibody Anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (mouse monoclonal) ImmunoStar Cat#: 22941  RRID: AB_572268 IHC (1:1000) Antibody Anti-GFP (mouse polyclonal) Aves Cat#: GFP-1020  RRID: AB_10000240 IHC (1:1000) Antibody Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-chicken IgY F(ab’)two fragment Jackson ImmunoResearch Cat#: 703-546-155  RRID: AB_2340376 IHC (1:1000) Antibody Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG Fab fragment Jackson ImmunoResearch Cat#: 711-607-003  RRID: AB_2340626 IHC (1:1000) Recombinant DNA reagent pAAV-hSyn-dLight1.2 Addgene Plasmid#: 111068  RRID: Addgene_111068 Gift on Lin Tian; produced by UC Davis Vector Core Recombinant DNA reagent pAAV-hSyn-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP Addgene Plasmid#: 26973  RRID: Addgene_26973 Gift of Karl Deisseroth; produced by UNC Vector Core Recombinant DNA reagent AAV9-Th-PI-Cre-SV40 Addgene Plasmid#: 107788  RRID: Addgene_107788 Addgene viral prep#: 107788-AAV9; gift of James M.

Animals were group housed (3–4 per group) throughout the duration of the experiment in a vivarium on a 12 hr light/dark cycle (lights off at 0600 hr, lights on at 1800 hr) with  ad libitum  access to food and water. Fluid restricted animals were singly housed, and their water access was limited to 1.5 mL/day. These mice were weighed daily and were returned to  ad libitum  water access if their weight decline was >10% of their pre-restriction weight. Animal husbandry and experimental procedures involving animal subjects were conducted in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and by the Office of Laboratory Animal Resources at California Institute of Technology under IACUC protocol 1730. Mice were only excluded from behavioral studies if they could not complete the entire experiment due to health concerns, if there was no dynamic photometry signal 3 weeks after surgery, or if the location of the photometry fiber tip was histologically determined to be outside the LNAc (1 mouse). All behavioral experiments were performed in at least two cohorts to minimize batch effects. All experiments were performed and analyzed blinded to genotype using automated, batched data analysis scripts/software wherever possible to eliminate experimenter bias. Littermate controls were used throughout the study. Patch-clamp electrophysiology Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed as previously described ( Cho et al., 2017 ) in acute brain slices. Acute 250 µm-thick horizontal slices that contained the lateral VTA were prepared on a vibratome (VT-1200, Leica Biosystems) from 8 to 12 week  Nf1 +/+  and  Nf1 +/-  mice that had been transcardially perfused with an ice-cold NMDG cutting solution ( Ting et al., 2014 ) saturated with 95% O 2 /5% CO 2 . Slices were recovered at 32°C in NMDG cutting solution for ten minutes prior to transfer to HEPES recovery artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) ( Ting et al., 2014 ) for an additional 30 min of recovery. During recording, slices were continuously perfused (2.0–3.0 mL/min) with 32°C, 95% O 2 /5% CO 2  -saturated recording ACSF that contained (mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH 2 PO 4 , 1.2 MgCl 2 , 2.4 CaCl 2 , 26 NaHCO 3 , and 11 glucose. The medial terminal nucleus of the accessory optic track (MT) was used as a visual landmark to delineate the most lateral region of the VTA. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were obtained using 3–6 MΩ patch pipettes fabricated from borosilicate capillary glass tubing (World Precision Instruments) and backfilled with a potassium gluconate internal solution that contained (mM): 135 K gluconate, 5 KCl, 5 EGTA, 0.5 CaCl 2 , 10 HEPES, 2 Mg-ATP, and 0.1 GTP. A high-chloride internal solution was used to measure IPSCs and contained (mM): 128 KCl, 20 NaCl, 1 MgCl 2  1 EGTA, 0.3 CaCl 2 , 10 HEPES, 2 Mg-ATP, and 0.3 GTP. Signals were amplified and digitized using a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, LLC) and Digidata 1440 analog-to-digital converter (Molecular Devices, LLC). Series resistance (Rs) was monitored throughout recording, and data were discarded if the uncompensated Rs exceeded 30 MΩ or the holding current at −70 mV was more negative than −200 pA. Rheobase currents were determined via the injection of a 500 pA ramp current over 500 ms from −60 mV in current clamp mode. I h  currents were measured during seven 2 s, −10 mV hyperpolarizing voltage steps from −60 mV in voltage clamp in the presence of 20 µM bicuculline methiodide and 3 mM kynurenic acid + /- 20 µM forskolin. Spontaneous firing was measured over twenty seconds of gap free recording in I = 0 mode. Spontaneous IPSCs and EPSCs were measured at −70 mV in voltage clamp. IPSCs were recorded in the presence of 3 mM kynurenic acid. Electrophysiological data were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz with Clampex 10.4 and analyzed in Clampfit 10.7 (Molecular Devices, LLC). Surgical procedures Stereotaxic viral vector injections were performed in mice anesthetized with isoflurane (1–3% in 95% O 2 /5% CO 2  provided via nose cone at 1 L/min) as previously described ( Cho et al., 2017 ). Following anesthesia, preparation and sterilization of the scalp, and exposure of the skull surface, a craniotomy hole was drilled over the LNAc (antero-posterior: 1.2 mm, medio-lateral: 1.6 mm relative to Bregma). 800 nL of the AAV9-hSyn-dLight1.2 vector (titer:~4 × 10 12  viral genomes/mL, produced at the UC Davis Vision Center Vector Design and Packaging Core facility; Addgene # 111068) was delivered into the LNAc (antero-posterior: 1.2 mm, medio-lateral: 1.6 mm, dorso-ventral: −4.2 mm relative to Bregma) using a blunt 33-gauge microinjection needle within a 10 μL microsyringe (NanoFil, World Precision Instruments), a WPI microsyringe pump (UMP3, World Precision Instruments), and pump controller (Micro4, World Precision Instruments) over 10 min. Following viral injection, a 5 mm long, 400 μm outer diameter mono fiber-optic cannula (MFC_400/430–0.48_5 mm_ZF1.25_FLT, Doric Lenses Inc) was lowered to the same stereotaxic coordinates and affixed to the skull surface with C and B Metabond (Parkel Inc) and dental cement. For optogenetic stimulation of the SC during dLight1.2 recordings, mice received a second stereotaxic injection of AAV5-hSyn-ChR2(H134R)-eYFP (UNC Vector Core) in the SC (antero-posterior: −4.0 mm, medio-lateral: 0.5 mm, dorso-ventral: −1.5 mm relative to Bregma), followed by implantation of a 3 mm long, 300 μm mono fiber-optic cannula (MFC_300/330–0.48_3 mm_ZF1.25_FLT, Doric Lenses Inc; antero-posterior: −4.0 mm, medio-lateral: 0.5 mm, dorso-ventral: −1.3 mm relative to Bregma). For optogenetic inhibition of VTA non-Th  neurons, 500 nL of a 1:4 mixture of AAV9- Th -PI-Cre-SV40 (gift of James M. Wilson, Addgene viral prep # 107788-AAV9) and AAV-DJ-Ef1α-DO-eNpHR3.0-eYFP-WPRE-pA (gift of Bernardo Sabatini, Addgene # 37087) or AAV-DJ-Ef1α-DO-mCherry-WPRE-pA (gift of Bernardo Sabatini, Addgene # 37119) was injected bilaterally into the VTA (antero-posterior: −3.3 mm, medio-lateral: ± 0.5 mm, dorso-ventral: −4.2 mm relative to Bregma), followed by implantation of 5 mm long, 300 μm mono fiber-optic cannulae (MFC_300/330–0.48_5 mm_ZF1.25_FLT; antero-posterior: −3.3 mm, medio-lateral: ± 1.84 mm, dorso-ventral: −3.59 mm relative to Bregma) at angle of twenty degrees. Mice were given 1 mg/kg buprenorphine SR and 5 mg/kg ketoprofen s.c. intraoperatively and received 30 mg/kg ibuprofen p.o. in their home cage water for five days post-operatively for pain. Mice were allowed a minimum of 14 days for surgical recovery prior to participation in behavioral studies. Systemic AAV vector production and administration In order to create  Th -VAST, a PCR fragment containing the 2.5 kb rat tyrosine hydroxylase promoter ( Oh et al., 2009 ) was subcloned into pAAV-ihSyn1-tTA-WPRE (Addgene #99120), replacing the ihSyn promoter through AflII and MluI restriction digest to create pAAV- Th -tTA-WPRE. pAAV-TRE-mRuby-WPRE (Addgene # 99114), pAAV-TRE-mNeonGreen-WPRE, pAAV-TRE-mTurquoise-WPRE (Addgene # 99113), pAAV- Th -GFP-WPRE (Addgene # 99128), pAAV-Ef1α-DO-mCherry-WPRE-pA (Addgene # 37119), and pAAV-Ef1α-DO-NpHR3.0-eYFP-WPRE-pA (Addgene # 37087) constructs were used as previously described ( Chan et al., 2017 ;  Saunders et al., 2012 ). Virus production was performed using a published protocol ( Challis et al., 2019 ). In brief, HEK293T cells were triple transfected using polyethylenimine (PEI) to deliver viral pUCmini-iCAP-PHP.eB (Addgene #103005) or pAAV-DJ-Rep-Cap (VPK-420-DK, Cell Biolabs, Inc), pHelper, and transgene plasmids. Viral particles were harvested from the media and cell pellet and purified over 15%, 25%, 40% and 60% iodixanol (OptiPrep, STEMCELL Technologies, Inc) step gradients. Viruses were concentrated using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters (Millipore Sigma), formulated in sterile phosphate buffered saline, and titered with qPCR by measuring the number of DNase I–resistant viral genomes relative to a linearized genome plasmid as a standard. Following viral production and titering, systemic AAV vectors were administered via injection into the retro-orbital sinus during anesthesia with isoflurane (1–3% in 95% O 2 /5% CO 2  provided via nose cone at 1 L/min), followed by administration of 1–2 drops of 0.5% proparacaine to the corneal surface ( Challis et al., 2019 ). Note: we have observed some toxicity with doses of AAV-PHP.eB- Th -tTA≥1×10 11  vg/mouse when allowed to express >3 weeks; therefore, we encourage users to perform dosing and time course studies when beginning experiments with  Th -VAST. Fiber photometry Fiber photometry was used to monitor fluorescent dopamine signals using a custom system as previously described ( Cho et al., 2017 ;  Patriarchi et al., 2018 ), which allowed for dLight1.2 excitation and emission light to be delivered and collected via the same implanted optical fiber. Our system employed a 490 nm LED (M490F1, Thorlabs, Inc; filtered with FF02-472/30-25, Semrock) for fluorophore excitation and a 405 nm LED for isosbestic excitation (M405F1, Thorlabs Inc; filtered with FF01-400/40-25, Semrock), which were modulated at 211 Hz and 531 Hz, respectively, controlled by a real-time processor (RX8-2, Tucker David Technologies), and delivered to the implanted optical fiber via a 0.48 NA, 400 µm diameter mono fiber optic patch cable (MFP_400/430/LWMJ-0.48_2 m_FC-ZF1.25, Doric Lenses Inc). The emission signal from isosbestic excitation, which has previously been shown to be calcium independent for GCaMP sensors ( Kim et al., 2016 ;  Lerner et al., 2015 ), was used as a reference signal to account for motion artifacts and photo-bleaching. Emitted light was collected via the patch cable, collimated, filtered (MF525-39, Thorlabs), and detected by a femto-Watt photoreceiver (Model 2151, Newport Co.) after passing through a focusing lens (62–561, Edmunds Optics). Photoreceiver signals were demodulated into dLight1.2 and control (isosbestic) signals, digitized (sampling rate: 382 Hz), and low-pass filtered at 25 Hz using a second-order Butterworth filter with zero-phase distortion. A least-squares linear fit was applied for the 405 nm signal to be aligned with the 490 nm signal. Then, the fitted 405 nm signal was subtracted from 490 nm channel, and then divided by the fitted 405 nm signal to calculate ΔF/F values. The code to perform this function is available at:  https://github.com/GradinaruLab/dLight1/blob/master/FP_Session_Processing2.m . During behavioral experiments, the ΔF/F time-series trace was normalized using a robust z-score ( ) to account for data variability across animals and sessions. When fiber photometry was performed during behavioral testing, dLight1.2 signals were synchronized to the beginning of the behavioral session by delivery of TTL pulses (via a TTL pulse generator; OTPG_4, Doric Lenses Inc) to the photometry system. s i g n a l - s i g n a l m e d i a n m e d i a n a b s o l u t e d e v i a t i o n Behavioral assays Baseline dLight1.2 Measurements : Mice were tethered to the photometry patch cable, placed in a clean home cage within a sound attenuating box, and allowed to habituate for 5 min (Lafayette Instrument Company). Spontaneous dLight1.2 signals were subsequently recorded for 5 min. This procedure was repeated at least three times per mouse. During pre-treatment experiments, morphine sulfate (5.0 mg/kg s.c.) or saline (s.c.) was administered twenty minutes prior to the onset of each session. Median fluorescence was determined from the processed ΔF/F time-series trace using the median() function in Matlab; peak analysis was performed on the normalized, z-scored trace using a two z-score threshold to minimize contamination by fluorescent noise. Dopamine transients were detected using the findpeaks() function in Matlab, and outputs were averaged within each subject across trials. Reward Consumption and Pavlovian Conditioning:  During the twenty-minute sucrose consumption assay, mice were given access to ten 50 μL sucrose (5% w/v) rewards delivered every 60 s (0.5 mL total) via a lick port in a mouse modular test chamber (Model 80015NS, Lafayette Instrument Company) placed within a sound-attenuating box and controlled by ABET II software (Lafayette Instrument Company). Sucrose consumption was characterized by measuring the timing and number of licks at the lick spout, which was measured with an optical lickometer in the lick port. Lick bouts were defined as licking events that exceeded five licks/second and were at least 3 s removed from a previous lick bout. During the Pavlovian conditioning assay, mice were conditioned to associate the presence of a 10-s conditioned stimulus (CS; illumination of the house-light and delivery of a 60 dB, 3 kHz tone) with delivery of the unconditioned stimulus (US; 50 μL 5% sucrose w/v; 1000 μL total fluid delivery/session) 7 s after the onset of the CS. Each conditioning session consisted of twenty trials with an inter-trial interval randomly drawn from a uniform distribution between 75 and 105 s. On day 11, the sucrose US was omitted to determine dLight1.2 responses to reward omission (Day 11, Trial 1). The number of licks during CS presentation were determined for each trial using ABET II. Because US consumption often occurred during the inter-trial interval, the US timing was determined by identifying the first lick bout after reward presentation during each trial. Cued Fear Conditioning:  During the cued fear conditioning task, a ten-second CS (60 dB, 3 kHz tone and house light illumination) immediately preceded a 1 s, 0.4-mA foot shock delivered via the grid floor of the conditioning chamber (Lafayette Instrument Company). The conditioning procedure was completed during 15 consecutive trials with an inter-trial interval randomly drawn from uniform distribution between 75 and 105 s. Mice were videotaped during the assay under dim red light conditions so that the amount of time freezing (defined as the absence of any body movement) and the latency to freeze during each trial could be quantified post hoc by two blinded reviewers. Audiovisual Stimulus Exposure:  Mice were placed in a clean home cage in the sound attenuating chamber placed underneath the speaker and house light from the modular conditioning chamber. During each trial, mice were randomly presented with either a ten-second 60 dB, 3 kHz tone or house light illumination, which had equal probability of selection. Each session consisted of twenty trials, and the inter-trial interval was randomly drawn from a uniform distribution between 75 and 105 s. Social Interaction and Social Preference Assay:  Test mice were placed in a clean cage and allowed to freely interact with a juvenile, sex-matched, novel, conspecific probe mouse. Social interactions were videotaped, and the onset of recording was synchronized with the photometry signal via delivery of TTL pulses. The onset of each social interaction was defined as the initiation of physical contact between mice and was terminated when mice physically disengaged. The social preference assay was performed in a 50 cm x 50 cm square, white acrylic arena that contained two identical, wire mesh-enclosed social interaction vestibules placed in the center of opposite walls of the arena. During each thirty-minute testing session, a juvenile, sex-matched, novel, conspecific probe mouse was placed in one of the vestibules, and the position of the test mouse was tracked with an overhead camera using EthoVision XT 10 (The Noldus Company). The location of the probe mouse was alternated between trials. Looming Stimulus Assay:  The looming stimulus assay was performed as previously described ( Yilmaz and Meister, 2013 ). Mice were acclimated in an 87 cm x 47.5 cm x 30 cm (h) infrared-transmitting black acrylic arena in the presence of a nest/shelter for at least five minutes. The overhead looming stimulus was presented when the animal was in the center of the arena. The looming stimulus covered 5 degrees of the animal's visual field initially, expanded up to 50 degrees, and was presented five times separated by 1 s pauses on a gray background. For optogenetic manipulations, the looming stimulus was presented as described above in an arena that was optimized for behavioral testing in tethered mice that measured 50 cm x 35 cm x 30 cm (h). In order to accommodate optical patch cables, the arena featured a rectangular opening adjacent to the overhead screen and a triangular nest/shelter with a 2 cm slit at the apex. During testing, laser pulses (532 nm, 5 mW, 20 Hz, 5 ms pulse width) were delivered via the implanted optical fibers, which were coupled to optical patch cables (MFP_300/330/LWMJ0.48_1 m_FC-ZF1.25, Doric Lenses Inc) connected to a 532 nm laser (Changchun New Industries [CNI] Model with PSU-H-LED). Stimulation began 1.5 s prior to looming onset and continued throughout the stimulus presentation. Mice were videotaped throughout so that time to react to the disc, escape location, latency to the first freezing episode, duration of the first freezing episode, and amount of time spent freezing during the first minute after exposure could be quantified by a blinded reviewer. Optogenetic Stimulation of the Superior Colliculus : Mono fiber-optic patch cables were connected to implanted optical fibers for fiber photometry in the LNAc and optogenetic stimulation of the ipsilateral vSC. The vSC patch cable was connected to a 473 nm laser (Changchun New Industries [CNI] Model with PSU-H-LED) and controlled by a Doric Lenses OTPG_4 pulse generator that was triggered by the ABETII software. Mice were allowed to habituate in a clean home cage within the Lafayette sound-attenuating chamber for 5 min prior to the start of the experiment. Following habituation, dLight1.2 signals were recorded during twenty trials in which the vSC was stimulated with 2 s of 20 Hz, 5 ms, 473 nm laser pulses. The inter-trial interval was randomly drawn from a uniform distribution between 75 and 105 s. Histology Free-floating brain sections were blocked for 1 hr in 10% normal donkey serum (Millipore-Sigma, S30-M) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature, then incubated with primary antibody diluted in the blocking buffer overnight at 4°C. Sections were washed three times for 15 min in PBS. Secondary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer, and brain sections were incubated in the secondary antibody solution for 2 hr at room temperature. Sections received three 15 min washes in PBS prior to mounting on glass slides with ProLong Diamond anti-fade mounting medium (ThermoFisher Scientific,  P36965 ) or RIMS (refractive index matching solution; RI = 1.46) ( Yang et al., 2014 ). VAST sections were optically cleared overnight in RIMS prior to mounting. The following antibodies/dilutions were used: rabbit anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (EMD Millipore, AB152, 1:1000; for VAST), monocloncal mouse anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (ImmunoStar, 22941, 1:1000; for TH quantification, somata tracing, and cell counting), polyclonal chicken anti-GFP (Aves, GFP-1020, 1:1000), Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-chicken IgY F(ab’)two fragment (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 703-546-155, 1:1000), Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG Fab fragment (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 711-606-152, 1:1000), and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG Fab fragment (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 711-607-003, 1:1000). Histological images were obtained using either a Keyence BZ-X fluorescence microscope or Zeiss 880 confocal microscope. Images were analyzed using BZ-X Analyzer software (Keyence Corporation), ImageJ, and/or Imaris (Bitplane). VTA and SNc cell counting was performed on 100 mm, coronal histological sections from Bregma −3.2 to −3.6 μm (AP) and averaged across sections within each mouse. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using Matlab (MathWorks, Inc) and GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, Inc). All statistical tests performed on data presented in the manuscript are stated in the figure captions and provided in detail in  Source data 1 . For each experiment, statistical tests were chosen based on the structure of the experiment and data set. No outliers were removed during statistical analysis. Sample sizes estimates were based on published behavioral and electrophysiological literature that utilized the 129T2/SvEmsJ::C57Bl/6NTac  Nf1 +/-  mouse model; this was within a range commonly employed by researchers in our field using similar techniques and that which was determined via the sampsizepwr() function in Matlab. Parametric tests were used throughout the manuscript; for sIPSC and ESPC data, non-parametric Mann Whitney U tests were also reported because sIPSC frequency was non-normally distributed for both genotypes (as determined by the D’Agostino and Pearson normality test). In this case, the results of parametric and non-parametric hypothesis tests were congruent (see  Figure 3  caption). When analysis of variance (ANOVA; one-way, two-way, and/or repeated measures) was performed, multiple comparisons were corrected using the Bonferroni correction. Multiple t-tests were corrected with the two-stage linear step-up procedure of Benjamini, Krieger and Yekutieli with a false discovery rate of 5%.

PMID:41468561,NF1-Specific Growth Charts for Head Circumference Over the First 3 Years of Life.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Macrocephaly is among the most common findings in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and may be associated with other clinical manifestations of the genetic syndrome. NF1-specific growth charts that account for expected macrocephaly may increase sensitivity for detecting atypical growth. We aimed to produce NF1-specific growth charts of head circumference for the age range of 0-3 years and to assess their potential clinical impact. METHODS: Using electronic health records from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, we collected head circumference measurements from children with NF1 and a community control cohort seen at scheduled well-child visits. We compared head circumference normalized using Centers for Disease Control (CDC) growth charts between these groups over time. We constructed NF1-specific growth charts using 2 independent methods. Finally, we used mixed-effects models to relate the resulting centile scores to developmental delay assessed with the Survey of Well-being of Young Children. RESULTS: Our data set contained 2,180 observations from 305 individuals (167 male) with NF1 and 104,750 observations from 16,742 individuals (8,809 male) in the community control cohort, all aged 0-3 years. Head circumference was significantly elevated in the NF1 cohort across the age range ( DISCUSSION: We present the first NF1-specific growth charts for head circumference covering the age range of 0-3 years. Macrocephaly in NF1 becomes more exaggerated over time as rate of growth is sustained compared with controls. Smaller head size relative to NF1 growth expectations is not captured by CDC charts yet it nevertheless relates to developmental delay, suggesting that NF1-specific charts may increase sensitivity to clinically concerning patterns of growth in children with NF1.","Methods: Using electronic health records from the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, we collected head circumference measurements from children with NF1 and a community control cohort seen at scheduled well-child visits. We compared head circumference normed using Centers for Disease Control (CDC) growth charts between these groups over time. We constructed NF1-specific growth charts using two independent methods. Finally, we used mixed-effects models to relate the resulting centile scores with developmental delay assessed with the Survey of Well-being of Young Children. Methods Standard Protocol Approvals, Registration, and Patient Consents This retrospective study was reviewed by the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) institutional review board and was determined to be exempt from institutional review board oversight as relying on secondary analyses of preexisting clinical data. Cohort Selection Using electronic health records from CHOP, we accessed 110,927 head circumference measurements from 17,307 patients aged 0 to 3 years old seen at either a well-child visit (for routine pediatric follow up) or who were NF1 patients seen by the CHOP Neurofibromatosis Multidisciplinary Program. In accordance with the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations, well child visits at CHOP are scheduled at the first week of life, 1 month, 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 9 months, 1 year, 15 months, 18 months, 2 years, 30 months, and 3 years. Head circumference data were taken from a relational database enriched for patients who had received an MRI scan at CHOP.  Head circumference observations were obtained between the years 2003 and 2025. Henceforth, we refer to community control patients seen at well-child visit appointments as “non-NF1” (though we note that this latter cohort could include undiagnosed NF1). 23 Using each participant’s gestational age at birth and age at the time of each observation, we calculated their post-conceptional age (e.g. a 30 day old child born at 38 weeks had a post-conceptional age of 296 days). Gestational age at birth was assumed to be 40 weeks for the 41 NF1 participants and 1719 clinical controls for whom it was not available, which was closely aligned to median observed gestational age at birth for available subjects (39 weeks for both cohorts). We excluded individuals born < 26 weeks of gestation, with birth weight < 1 kg, and/or post-conceptional age < 252 days (36 weeks). These cutoffs were chosen based on minimum weeks of gestational age at birth, birth weight, and post-conceptional age of the NF1 cohort. This resulted in a dataset of 107,999 observations from 16,779 individuals. Next, we sought to remove implausible head circumference measurements that likely reflected data entry errors. To do this, we used an outlier detection approach applied previously by our group  to calculate modified Z-scores for each head circumference observation from the whole pooled study population. This involved first fitting a B-spline with four degrees of freedom to head circumference data using post-conceptional age and sex as predictors. We used residuals of this model as the numerator for the modified Z-score. The denominator included the median of the absolute deviations (MAD, or median of the absolute values of the residuals) multiplied by a scaling factor set to 1.4826 assuming normally distributed data. We visualized modified Z-scores on a histogram ( 10 Supplementary Figure 1 ) and excluded observations where the absolute value exceeded 5. This resulted 107,412 observations from 16,746 individuals. We also sought to remove within-subject outlier head circumference measurements that were also thought to be implausible and likely reflecting data entry error. To that end, we calculated for each observation the difference between the modified Z score and the median modified Z score across observations from the same participant. We plotted these values on a histogram ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) and excluded observations where the absolute value of the difference exceeded 2, removing 442 observations. The resulting number of observations was 106,970 from 16,744 individuals. Finally, we removed data from four individuals where sex was documented as neither male nor female, resulting in a final dataset of 106,950 observations from 16,742 individuals ( Figure 1 ;  Table 1 ). Comparing Head Circumference Z Scores between NF1 and non-NF1 Cohort We used the LMS method from Centers for Disease Control (CDC) growth charts on head circumference to compute Z scores for non-NF1 and NF1 cohorts.  We used CDC charts because they are used in clinical practice at CHOP as well as other pediatric medical centers. Because input to LMS for CDC charts is age in calendar months, we transformed post-conceptional age by subtracting 280 days, dividing by 365.25/12=30.437, rounding down, and adding 0.5. As such, a 7-week-old child born at term would be represented as 1.5 months on CDC charts, as would children between 1.0 and 1.99 months of age corrected for gestational age at birth. 24 Next, we compared CDC head circumference Z scores between NF1 and non-NF1 cohorts at each well-child visit, where head circumference data are most dense. Head circumference observations were grouped into bins based on whether that observation was 10 days plus or minus age corresponding to well-child visit timepoint. If multiple head circumference observations from the same individual appeared within a bin, the observation closest to the well-child visit timepoint was chosen. Unpaired two-sample t tests were conducted between both groups at each age bin, with multiple comparisons corrected using Holm-Bonferroni correction. Given large sample sizes, Cohen’s  d  was also calculated for each comparison to quantify effect sizes. 25 Construction of NF1-Specific Head Circumference Growth Charts using LMSz Next, we implemented a recently described method called “LMSz” to construct NF1-specific head circumference growth charts.  Following procedures described by Low and colleagues, we fit generalized additive models for location, scale, and space (GAMLSS) 26  with the normal distribution family to CDC head circumference Z-scores for NF1 observations using age and sex as covariates. While sex-specific models were computed for CHOP charts described below, LMSz charts were combined across sexes with a sex offset included in candidate models. Head circumference observations were inverse weighted by total number of observations per subject. We iterated through a set of candidate models for mu and sigma formulae within GAMLSS and computed Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) for each ( 27 Supplementary Table 1 ). For final NF1-specific charts, we chose the model that minimized BIC. The resulting model included age as a linear term for mu and only the intercept term for sigma. Sex did not appear in models that maximized BIC or AIC. Using this GAMLSS model, we computed centile lines for 3 rd , 10 th , 50 h th , 90 th , and 97 th  percentiles for CDC head circumference Z score, then transformed these centile lines back into head circumference measurements using CDC LMS values. (Note that we use the terms “centile” and “percentile” synonymously). We also examined rate-of-growth by computing the derivative of the 50 th  centile line of NF1-specific and CDC growth charts respectively. (We use the term “rate-of-growth” to refer simply to this derivative; longitudinal growth over time within individuals is not explicitly modeled). GAMLSS model visualization was performed using customized R functions ( https://github.com/BGDlab/gamlssTools ). Deriving CHOP Growth Charts for NF1 and Community Controls While widely used clinically, CDC growth charts have potential limitations. First, clinical head circumference data (even for well-child visits) may deviate systematically from CDC norms . Second, for neonatal head circumference in premature infants, CDC growth charts start at birth and are not corrected for gestational age. To address these limitations, we also computed separate growth charts using NF1 and non-NF1 data, henceforth referred to as “CHOP growth charts” (which, in contrast to LMSz charts, only use data from CHOP cohorts). Following protocols described by WHO, 15 , 28  we fit natural splines for mu and sigma moments in GAMLSS with degrees of freedom ranging from 5 to 15, and 2 to 10 respectively. Tau and nu were fit with an intercept term, and the Box-Cox Power Exponential (BCPE) distribution was used. In addition, we computed models where P-splines were used for mu and sigma. 29  Age was represented as the logarithm (to base 10) of post-conceptional age measured in days. Head circumference observations were inverse weighted by total number of observations per subject. 30 We computed separate GAMLSS models for non-NF1 (Community Control) males, non non-NF1 females, NF1 males, and NF1 females. For each of these cohorts, we identified the models that produced the lowest AIC and BIC as well as the result of the penalized B-spline model and chose one of the three based on the fit of the worm plot and smoothness of the curves. If these criteria were equal across multiple options, we chose the simplest of the remaining models. Based on this process, a model with five degrees of freedom for mu and two degrees of freedom for sigma was selected for each cohort ( Supplementary Figures 3 – 6 ). We also visualized quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots for each selected model ( Supplementary Figure 7 ). We compared Z scores from the LMSz and CHOP growth charts ( Supplementary Figure 8 ). Finally, we applied both the LMSz and CHOP NF1-specific growth charts to an independent NF1 cohort recruited in Australia to test the generalizability of the charts (see  Supplementary Materials ). Relating Head Circumference Benchmarked Against NF1 Growth Charts to Developmental Delay We examined whether head circumference benchmarked against NF1 growth charts was more sensitive to developmental delay in NF1 patients compared to CDC growth charts. First, we aligned NF1 head circumference data to Survey of Well Being of Young Children (SWYC) surveys conducted on the same days, which assess developmental milestones (gross motor, fine motor, language, cognitive, and social development) at pediatric primary care visits.  SWYC data were converted into developmental quotient (DQs) using previously-described normative models to quantify the extent to which a child has met expected milestones. 31  The DQ is the estimated age of the child based on the number of expected milestones they have achieved divided by their chronological age (e.g. a 12 month old who has met milestones expected of a 9 month old has a DQ of 0.75). Using linear mixed effects models, we evaluated the relationship between DQ and head circumference Z-scores from LMSz NF1 charts where patient ID was used as a random effect. We also plotted histograms of NF1 head circumference benchmarked against CDC and LMSz charts respectively to evaluate prevalence of microcephaly (i.e. head circumference Z score < 2). Finally, we assessed the relationship between DQ and head circumference Z scores derived from CHOP NF1 charts as well. 32 Data availability Participant-level data used to generate growth charts cannot be made publicly available as they contain protected health information.

PMID:25336744,The tumor suppressor Nf2 regulates corpus callosum development by inhibiting the transcriptional coactivator Yap.,"The corpus callosum connects cerebral hemispheres and is the largest axon tract in the mammalian brain. Callosal malformations are among the most common congenital brain anomalies and are associated with a wide range of neuropsychological deficits. Crossing of the midline by callosal axons relies on a proper midline environment that harbors guidepost cells emitting guidance cues to instruct callosal axon navigation. Little is known about what controls the formation of the midline environment. We find that two components of the Hippo pathway, the tumor suppressor Nf2 (Merlin) and the transcriptional coactivator Yap (Yap1), regulate guidepost development and expression of the guidance cue Slit2 in mouse. During normal brain development, Nf2 suppresses Yap activity in neural progenitor cells to promote guidepost cell differentiation and prevent ectopic Slit2 expression. Loss of Nf2 causes malformation of midline guideposts and Slit2 upregulation, resulting in callosal agenesis. Slit2 heterozygosity and Yap deletion both restore callosal formation in Nf2 mutants. Furthermore, selectively elevating Yap activity in midline neural progenitors is sufficient to disrupt guidepost formation, upregulate Slit2 and prevent midline crossing. The Hippo pathway is known for its role in controlling organ growth and tumorigenesis. Our study identifies a novel role of this pathway in axon guidance. Moreover, by linking axon pathfinding and neural progenitor behaviors, our results provide an example of the intricate coordination between growth and wiring during brain development.",,Alfonso Lavado; Michelle Ware; Joshua Paré; Xinwei Cao,"Development (Cambridge, England)",2014-11,10.1242/dev.111260,abstract_only,False
PMID:21478499,Neurofibromin (Nf1) is required for skeletal muscle development.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a multi-system disease caused by mutations in the NF1 gene encoding a Ras-GAP protein, neurofibromin, which negatively regulates Ras signaling. Besides neuroectodermal malformations and tumors, the skeletal system is often affected (e.g. scoliosis and long bone dysplasia) demonstrating the importance of neurofibromin for development and maintenance of the musculoskeletal system. Here, we focus on the role of neurofibromin in skeletal muscle development. Nf1 gene inactivation in the early limb bud mesenchyme using Prx1-cre (Nf1(Prx1)) resulted in muscle dystrophy characterized by fibrosis, reduced number of muscle fibers and reduced muscle force. This was caused by an early defect in myogenesis affecting the terminal differentiation of myoblasts between E12.5 and E14.5. In parallel, the muscle connective tissue cells exhibited increased proliferation at E14.5 and an increase in the amount of connective tissue as early as E16.5. These changes were accompanied by excessive mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation. Satellite cells isolated from Nf1(Prx1) mice showed normal self-renewal, but their differentiation was impaired as indicated by diminished myotube formation. Our results demonstrate a requirement of neurofibromin for muscle formation and maintenance. This previously unrecognized function of neurofibromin may contribute to the musculoskeletal problems in NF1 patients.",,Nadine Kossler; Sigmar Stricker; Christian Rödelsperger; Peter N Robinson; Johnny Kim; Carola Dietrich; Monika Osswald; Jirko Kühnisch; David A Stevenson; Thomas Braun; Stefan Mundlos; Mateusz Kolanczyk,Human molecular genetics,2011-07-15,10.1093/hmg/ddr149,abstract_only,False
PMID:36854987,Modeling nervous system tumors with human stem cells and organoids.,"Nervous system cancers are the 10th leading cause of death worldwide, many of which are difficult to diagnose and exhibit varying degrees of treatment resistance. The limitations of existing cancer models, such as patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models, call for the development of novel preclinical cancer models to more faithfully mimic the patient's cancer and offer additional insights. Recent advances in human stem cell biology, organoid, and genome-editing techniques allow us to model nervous system tumors in three types of next-generation tumor models: cell-of-origin models, tumor organoids, and 3D multicellular coculture models. In this review, we introduced and compared different human stem cell/organoid-derived models, and comprehensively summarized and discussed the recently developed models for various primary tumors in the central and peripheral nervous systems, including glioblastoma (GBM), H3K27M-mutant Diffuse Midline Glioma (DMG) and H3G34R-mutant High-grade Glioma (HGG), Low-grade Glioma (LGG), Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1), Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2), Medulloblastoma (MB), Atypical Teratoid/rhabdoid Tumor (AT/RT), and meningioma.

PMID:24719295,Maximizing bone formation in posterior spine fusion using rhBMP-2 and zoledronic acid in wild type and NF1 deficient mice.,"Spinal pseudarthrosis is a well described complication of spine fusion surgery in NF1 patients. Reduced bone formation and excessive resorption have been described in NF1 and anti-resorptive agents may be advantageous in these individuals. In this study, 16 wild type and 16 Nf1(+/-) mice were subjected to posterolateral fusion using collagen sponges containing 5 µg rhBMP-2 introduced bilaterally. Mice were dosed twice weekly with 0.02 mg/kg zoledronic acid (ZA) or sterile saline. The fusion mass was assessed for bone volume (BV) and bone mineral density (BMD) by microCT. Co-treatment using rhBMP-2 and ZA produced a significant increase (p < 0.01) in BV of the fusion mass compared to rhBMP-2 alone in both wild type mice (+229%) and Nf1(+/-) mice (+174%). Co-treatment also produced a significantly higher total BMD of the fusion mass compared to rhBMP-2 alone in both groups (p < 0.01). Despite these gains with anti-resorptive treatment, Nf1(+/-) deficient mice still generated less bone than wild type controls. TRAP staining on histological sections indicated an increased osteoclast surface/bone surface (Oc.S/BS) in Nf1(+/-) mice relative to wild type mice, and this was reduced with ZA treatment.",,Justin Bobyn; Anton Rasch; Mikulec Kathy; David G Little; Aaron Schindeler,Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society,2014-08,10.1002/jor.22628,abstract_only,False

PMID:40299482,Sleep Disorders in Pediatric Patients Affected by Neurofibromatosis Type 1: Reports of a Questionnaire and an Apple Watch Sleep Assessment.,,"2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Population In the following observational case–control study, 50 children affected by neurofibromatosis type 1 and admitted to the Unit of Rare Diseases of the Nervous System in Childhood at the ’G. Rodolico—San Marco’ University Hospital of Catania and 50 children belonging to the control group, recruited from the pediatrics units of the same hospital, were recruited. All 100 patients who took part in the survey were aged between 6 and 12 years. 2.2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria The criteria for inclusion and exclusion considered in recruiting the 50 patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 were as follows: Being between 2 and 12 years of age. Having a definite diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1. Individuals with non-NF1-related neurological diagnoses (i.e., epilepsy secondary to a known unrelated etiology, neurodegenerative disorders, neuropsychiatric diseases uncommon in NF1 patients) were excluded from the study. Individuals with NF1-related chronic pain and neurofibroma-related disfigurement were excluded. As for the inclusion criteria adopted for the recruitment of the 50 patients in the control group, they were as follows: Being aged between 2 and 12 years. Not having neurofibromatosis type 1 or any other neurological or neuropsychiatric disorder. The coexistence (in the NF1 patients) or the presence (in the healthy subjects) of any other pathology or disorder was therefore not a reason for exclusion. 2.3. Collecting Data For data collection, an anonymous questionnaire consisting of multiple-choice and open-ended questions was designed and administered to all patients recruited in the survey. The questions in the questionnaire were aimed at assessing the presence of one or more sleep disorders and, if disorders were present, an assessment of the frequency of their presentation. In addition, as highlighted above, the questionnaire also aimed to assess the social impact of the disorders on the lives of these children and their families. Regarding the method of administration, the questionnaire was administered and completed either personally by the parents of the children or by telephone. The questionnaire designed and used for this study can be downloaded as a  supplementary file (Supplementary Table S1) . An assessment of sleep parameters (including the total sleep duration; time in bed vs. time asleep; napping frequency and napping duration; sleep stages; heart rate and respiratory metrics; sleep onset and sleep efficiency; and sleep breathing disorders) with an Apple Watch Ultra model 2 (application: Sleep++) was performed in all the patients with a total of three different measurements per patient on three different days. 2.4. Statistical Analysis This study aimed to compare the prevalence of sleep-related behaviors, habits, and disorders in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) versus healthy controls.

PMID:1946460,Identification and characterization of the neurofibromatosis type 1 protein product.,"The neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene responsible for von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis is related to regulators of ras proteins, and a portion of NF1 that is homologous to the ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) encodes a similar GTPase-stimulating activity. We have raised rabbit antisera to a bacterially synthesized 48-kDa peptide corresponding to the GAP-related domain of NF1 (NF1-GRD). These antisera immunoprecipitated the NF1-GRD peptide, and one of them specifically inhibited the GTPase-stimulating activity of NF1-GRD. The sera specifically detected a 280-kDa protein in lysates of mouse NIH 3T3 and human HeLa cells. This protein corresponds to the NF1 gene product, as shown by several criteria, including partial proteolysis. Subcellular fractionation revealed that while GAP is predominantly cytoplasmic, all of the NF1 was recovered in a pellet (100,000 x g) fraction. NF1 was present in a large molecular mass complex in fibroblast and Schwannoma cell lines and appears to associate with a very large (400-500 kDa) protein in both cell types.

PMID:12057013,Complex splicing pattern generates great diversity in human NF1 transcripts.,"BACKGROUND: Mutation analysis of the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene has shown that about 30% of NF1 patients carry a splice mutation resulting in the production of one or several shortened transcripts. Some of these transcripts were also found in fresh lymphocytes of healthy individuals, albeit typically at a very low level. Starting from this initial observation, we were interested to gain further insight into the complex nature of NF1 mRNA processing. RESULTS: We have used a RT-PCR plasmid library based method to identify novel NF1 splice variants. Several transcripts were observed with specific insertions/deletions and a survey was made. This large group of variants detected in one single gene allows to perform a comparative analysis of the factors involved in splice regulation. Exons that are prone to skipping were systematically analysed for 5' and 3' splice site strength, branch point strength and secondary structure. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed a complex splicing pattern, generating a great diversity in NF1 transcripts. We found that, on average, exons that are spliced out in part of the mRNA have significantly weaker acceptor sites. Some variants identified in this study could have distinct roles and might expand our knowledge of neurofibromin.","Materials and methods RNA isolation and cDNA preparation RNA was isolated from fresh blood leukocytes from two normal individuals using TRIzol LS Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA extraction was performed immediately after blood drawing, excluding as far as possible influences due to stress factors. Total RNA (2 μg) was reverse transcribed using SuperScript II Reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamers (Amersham Biosciences). RT-PCR library formation and PCR analysis Primers used for the amplification of the total  NF1  cDNA in 5 overlapping fragments were as described [ 17 ]. Reactions were performed as described [ 13 ]. The PCR products were cloned in the pCR2.1-TOPO-vector (Invitrogen) and transformed into TOP-10F' cells. The colonies were lysed and the subcloned fragments were reamplified with the same primers. The five  NF1  fragments (NF1-F1 to NF1-F5) were digested subsequently with different restriction enzymes:  Scrf I,  Sty I, and  Bsr I for NF1-F1,  Hae III and  Ava II for NF2-F2,  Hae II for NF1-F3 and NF1-F5, and  Ava II for NF1-F4. All transcripts with a different restriction pattern were sequenced (primer sequences available upon request) using the Thermo Sequenase fluorescent labelled primer cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences) and analysed on an ALF-express automated DNA sequencer (Amersham Biosciences). Nomenclature for the description of the different  NF1  transcripts In order to clearly describing the identity (ID) of the transcripts, following nomenclature was used: • The ID of all transcript variants start with 'NF1' followed by '-'. • Sequence changes are all described at the RNA level, with 1 = first base of methionine (ATG) at the start. Numbering system for insertions are based on the  NF1  genomic sequence (Genbank Accession Nr.  AC004526 ). • Deletions are designated with the symbol 'Δ', insertions with 'ins'. • Deletions are described with a '_' separating the first and the last deleted exon. • Skipping of a complete exon is designated by an 'E' preceding the exon number. Two consecutive deleted exons are separated by '/'. When more than two consecutive exons were deleted, the first and the last deleted exon are separated by a '_' character, non-consecutive exons are separated by a ',' character to indicate that intermediate exons are not deleted. • Insertions are described by a '+' or a '-' after the nucleotide flanking the insertion site, followed by the position of the first inserted nucleotide of the intron (beginning of intron = +1, for insertions flanking the acceptor site: end of preceding intron = -1), followed by 'ins' and the length of the inserted sequence. • Insertions of a complete intron are designated by 'IVS' preceding the intron number. • When more than one change was detected, these changes are described between square brackets, separated by a ',' character. Splice site scores The sequence environment of all donor- and acceptor sites was analysed using Splice Site Prediction by Neural Network (SSPNN, URL address:  ). Branch point scores We searched for branch point sequences in a window of -50, -10 with respect to the acceptor site. A program was written in DELPHI to calculate the strength of a branch point. Every 5-nucleotide sequence within the window was evaluated as a potential branch point. The 'standard' branch point sequence weight-table [ 4 ] was used to assign a score at every 5-nucleotide sequence within the window. The computed score reflects how closely it resembles known branch point sequences. The sequence with the highest score was selected as the 'putative' branch point. Secondary structures The mfold computer program version 3.0   was used to predict the RNA secondary structure and to calculate the folding free energy [ 26 , 27 ]. We have computed the minimum-free-energy structures from all the donor- and acceptor sites of the 60 exons of  NF1  within a window of 100 bp. It has been proposed [ 31 ] that there is a window of about 100 nucleotides after transcription where the pre-mRNA is free to fold. The size of this window would be defined by the time taken for the protein complexes to bind as the nascent RNA emerges.

PMID:38216123,NF1 deficiency drives metabolic reprogramming in ER+ breast cancer.,"OBJECTIVE: NF1 is a tumor suppressor gene and its protein product, neurofibromin, is a negative regulator of the RAS pathway. NF1 is one of the top driver mutations in sporadic breast cancer such that 27 % of breast cancers exhibit damaging NF1 alterations. NF1 loss-of-function is a frequent event in the genomic evolution of estrogen receptor (ER)+ breast cancer metastasis and endocrine resistance. Individuals with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF) - a disorder caused by germline NF1 mutations - have an increased risk of dying from breast cancer [1-4]. NF-related breast cancers are associated with decreased overall survival compared to sporadic breast cancer. Despite numerous studies interrogating the role of RAS mutations in tumor metabolism, no study has comprehensively profiled the NF1-deficient breast cancer metabolome to define patterns of energetic and metabolic reprogramming. The goals of this investigation were (1) to define the role of NF1 deficiency in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer metabolic reprogramming and (2) to identify potential targeted pathway and metabolic inhibitor combination therapies for NF1-deficient ER + breast cancer. METHODS: We employed two ER+ NF1-deficient breast cancer models: (1) an NF1-deficient MCF7 breast cancer cell line to model sporadic breast cancer, and (2) three distinct, Nf1-deficient rat models to model NF-related breast cancer [1]. IncuCyte proliferation analysis was used to measure the effect of NF1 deficiency on cell proliferation and drug response. Protein quantity was assessed by Western Blot analysis. We then used RNAseq to investigate the transcriptional effect of NF1 deficiency on global and metabolism-related transcription. We measured cellular energetics using Agilent Seahorse XF-96 Glyco Stress Test and Mito Stress Test assays. We performed stable isotope labeling and measured [U- RESULTS: Our results revealed that NF1 deficiency enhanced cell proliferation, altered neurofibromin expression, and increased RAS and PI3K/AKT pathway signaling while constraining oxidative ATP production and restricting energetic flexibility. Neurofibromin deficiency also increased glutamine influx into TCA intermediates and dramatically increased lipid pools, especially triglycerides (TG). Lastly, NF1 deficiency alters the synergy between metabolic inhibitors and traditional targeted inhibitors. This includes increased synergy with inhibitors targeting glycolysis, glutamine metabolism, mitochondrial fatty acid transport, and TG synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: NF1 deficiency drives metabolic reprogramming in ER+ breast cancer. This reprogramming is characterized by oxidative ATP constraints, glutamine TCA influx, and lipid pool expansion, and these metabolic changes introduce novel metabolic-to-targeted inhibitor synergies.","Methods We employed two ER+  NF1 -deficient breast cancer models: (1) an  NF1 -deficient MCF7 breast cancer cell line to model sporadic breast cancer, and (2) three distinct,  Nf1 -deficient rat models to model NF-related breast cancer [1].

We targeted  NF1 's RASGAP GRD domain with clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) guides to the 21st exon and established multiple  NF1 -deficient cell lines of which one was chosen for this analysis, NF1-45 ( Figure 1 A). The NF1-45 cells have a 5-bp deletion that introduces a premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated protein product after exon 21 ( Figure 1 A).

Figure 1 2.2 NF-related rat breast cancer models To understand the energetic and metabolic effect of  Nf1  deficiency in NF-related breast cancer, we employed our previously developed and described NF-related spontaneous rat mammary adenocarcinoma models [ 1 ]. To generate these models, we targeted  Nf1 's RASGAP GRD domain with CRISPR guides to the 20th exon. We generated three distinct  Nf1  indels in exon 20 that caused either in-frame or premature stop deletions. The  Nf1  inframe indel (Nf1-IF) rats have a 54bp deletion in exon 20 ( Figure 1 B) [ 1 ]. The  Nf1  premature stop indel (Nf1-PS) rats have an 8-bp deletion in exon 20 that introduces a premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated protein product after exon 20 ( Figure 1 B) [ 1 ]. The  Nf1  in-frame premature stop indel (Nf1-IFPS) rats have a 57-bp deletion in exon 20 that results in a unique messenger RNA (mRNA) isoform with an additional 140-bp deletion in exon 21 [ 1 ]. The exon n21 mRNA deletion introduces a premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated protein product after exon 21 ( Figure 1 B) [ 1 ]. The IF, PS, and IFPS indels model “ Nf1  deficiency” and induce aggressive, 100 % penetrant, multi-focal, ER/PR + mammary adenocarcinomas in both female and male rats [ 1 ]. To perform  in vitro  energetic and metabolic experiments using our NF-related rat breast cancer model, we utilized isolated,  ex vivo  rat mammary fat pad fibroblasts from each genetic background: Nf1-WT, Nf1-IF, Nf1-PS, Nf1-IFPS [ 46 ]. We also used isolated,  ex vivo  adenocarcinoma cell lines from each of the  Nf1 -deficient rat models: Nf1-IF, Nf1-PS, Nf1-IFPS [ 46 ]. Although mammary epithelial cells (MECs) are our proposed tumor cell of origin, our isolated MECs do not passage  in vitro , so we used isolated fibroblasts to have a rat  ex vivo Nf1 -WT to  Nf1 -deficient control since the rat tumor cell lines do not have a  Nf1 -WT control. 2.3 Cell culture Human ER + MCF7 breast cancer cells (HTB-22), were grown in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) no phenol red (Gibco, Cat# 21063029), 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS) (VWR, Cat# 1300-500), 5 mL penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco, Cat# 15070063). Rat-derived fibroblast lines were grown in DMEM/F12 no phenol red (Gibco, Cat# 15070063), 10 % FBS, and 5 mL gentamycin (Gibco, Cat# 15750060). Rat adenocarcinoma-derived tumor cell lines were grown in MEC media, which is DMEM/F12 no phenol red (Gibco, Cat# 21041-025), 10 % horse serum (Gibco, Cat# 16050-122), 20 ng/mL EGF (Sigma, Cat# E9644), 0.5ug/mL hydrocortisone (Sigma, Cat# H088), 100 ng/mL cholera toxin (Sigma, Cat# C8052), and 10ug/mL insulin (Sigma, Cat# I6634). All cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5 % CO 2  incubator. Mycoplasma testing (ATCC, Cat# 30-1012-K) every 6 months confirmed cells were not infected. 2.4 IncuCyte proliferation analysis Cells were grown in their respective medias (see section  2.3 ) and treated with 10 nM beta-estradiol (Sigma, Cat# E2758) for 48hr in a Sartorius IncuCyte. Cell proliferation was measured via cell confluency and doublings per day were calculated via the equation: Doublings per day = (final confluency/starting confluency)/assay duration (2 days). 2.5 3-dimensional culture of cells on matrigel MCF7 cells were plated into 8-well chamber slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# 154534) at a density of 2 × 10 4  cells/well in 100uL growth-factor-reduced-Matrigel (GFR-Matrigel) (Corning, Cat# 354230). After Matrigel solidification, overlay MEC media was added (see section  2.3 ). Cells were fed with fresh MEC media every 3 days and imaged on Day 3, 6, and 10. Day 10 is shown. 2.6 RNAseq RNAseq was performed on MCF7 NF1-EV and NF1-45 cell lines using 3 biological replicates. For each technical replicate, 1.2 × 10 5  cells were plated into a well of a 6-well plate (Corning, Cat# 3506). After 24hr. RLT buffer (Rneasy kit, Qiagen, Cat# 74104) was added to each well. The RLT buffer and cells were added to an Mpbio lysing matrix E tube (Mpbio, Cat# 6914100), and cells were homogenized for 20s in an Mpbio homogenizer (Mpbio). The supernatant was transferred to a QIAshredder column (Qiagen, Cat# 79654), and an equal volume of 70 % ethanol (Pharmco, Cat# 111000200) was added to the flow-through. The flow-through and ethanol mixture was transferred to an Rneasy column and the RNA was extracted following the manufacturer's instructions. The Van Andel Genomics Core prepared RNA libraries from 500 ng of total RNA using a KAPA mRNA Hyperprep kit (v4.17, Kapa Biosystems). RNA was sheared to 300-400bp. Before amplification, cDNA fragments were ligated to IDT for Illumina TruSeq UD Indexed adapters (Illumina Inc). Library quality was assessed using Aglient DNA High Sensitivity chip (Agilent Technologies, Inc.), QuantiFluor ® dsDNA System (Promega Corp.), and Kapa Illumina Library Quantification qPCR assays (Kapa Biosystems). Indexed libraries were combined and 100bp, paired-end sequences was performed using an Illumina NovaSeq6000 sequencer using a S4, 200-cycle sequencing kit (Illumina Inc.) to a depth of 70M reads per sample. Illumina RTA3 was used for base-calling, and NCS output was demultiplexed and converted to FastQ with Illumina Bcl2fastq v1.9.0. Trim Galore v0.6.0 was used to trim sequencing adapters from demultiplexed FASTQ files ( https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/ ). GENCODE was used to map FASTQ files to GRCh38 (release 33 with STAR v2.7.8a basic two-pass mode) [ 47 ]. Raw counts were extracted from reverse strand alignments, and principal component analysis was computed using iDEP 9.1. Fold change was calculated using normalized counts per million. Msigdbr [ 48 ] and clusterProfiler [ 49 ] packages were used to perform Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using 10,000 permutations and genes ranked by fold change. For the metabolism-related GSEA analysis, we manually curated a list of metabolism-related Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and REACTOME pathways from a list of all KEGG and REACTOME pathways. The data was then queried for pathways with significantly increased or decreased enrichment across 5 or more comparisons (NF1-45 vs. NF1-EV, Nf1-IF fibroblasts vs. Nf1-WT fibroblasts, Nf1-PS fibroblasts vs. Nf1-WT fibroblasts, Nf1-IFPS fibroblasts vs. Nf1-WT fibroblasts, Nf1-IF tumor vs. Nf1-WT whole mammary fat pad (MFP), Nf1-PS tumor vs. Nf1-WT whole MFP, and Nf1-IFPS tumor vs. Nf1-WT MFP). 2.7 Total protein expression Western blots Cells were grown in their respective medias (see section  2.3 ) and treated with 10 nM beta-estradiol for 48hr before lysate collection. Cells were washed with ice-cold 1X PBS (Gibco, Cat# 10010023), scraped, and lysed in Rb buffer (20 mM TrisHCL, pH 7.6; 5 mM EDTA; 150 mM NaCl; 0.5 % NP-40; 50 mM NaF; 1 mM beta-glycerophosphate) supplemented with PhosSTOP (Roche, Cat# 04906837001) and protease inhibitors (Sigma, Cat# 11873580001). Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was carried out using antibodies against neurofibromin – Bethyl (Bethyl, Cat# A300-140A, primary 1:500, secondary 1:2000), H12 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Cat# sc-376886, primary 1:500, secondary 1:2000), and iNF-07E (gifted by iNFiXion Bioscience, Biointron, Cat# B21900201, primary 1:500, secondary 1:2000) – voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) (Invitrogen, Cat# PA1-954A, primary 1:1000, secondary 1:3000), and β-tubulin (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat#2146, primary 1:500, secondary 1:2000). 2.8 ER, RAS, and PI3K esolute signaling Western blots The MCF7 cells were grown in their aforementioned media (see section  2.3 ) and treated with 10 nM beta-estradiol in DMEM no phenol red, 2 % charcoal-stripped FBS (cFBS) (Sigma, Cat# 12676029, Lot#18A392), and 5 mL penicillin-streptomycin for 24hr before lysate collection. Cells were washed with ice-cold 1X PBS, scraped, and lysed in Rb buffer supplemented with PhosSTOP and protease inhibitors. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was carried out using antibodies against neurofibromin (Bethyl), pERα S118 (Sigma, Cat# SAB450399), Erα E115 (Abcam, Cat# 32063), pERK T202/Y204 (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat#9101L), ERK (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat#4695S), pAKT S473 (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat#9271L), AKT (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat#9272S), and β-tubulin. 2.9 Seahorse XF-96 energetic analysis Cells were grown in their respective medias (see section  2.3 ) and treated with 10 nM beta-estradiol for 48hr before plating for the Seahorse assay. Cells were trypsinized (Gibco, Cat# 25300-054), collected, quenched, and spun down. Cells were counted with an automated BioRad cell counter (BioRad, Cat# TC20) and plated in poly- d -lysine-coated (Gibco, Cat# A38904-01) Seahorse XF-96 assay plates (Agilent, Cat# 101085-004). Cells were plated with the goal of ∼80–90 % final confluency, so MCF7 cells were plated at 30,000 cells per well, fibroblasts at 5,000 cells per well, and tumor cells at 15,000 cells per well. Cells were spun down and allowed to fully adhere to the plates for 4hr at 37 °C in a 5 % CO 2  incubator. After 4hr, growth media was gently removed by pipetting, and 180 μL Seahorse XF DMEM media (Agilent, Cat# 103575-100) was added to each well. Seahorse Mito Stress Test XF DMEM assay media contained 25 mM glucose (Fischer Scientific, Cat#D16-500), 4 mM glutamine (Sigma, Cat#25030-081), and 1 mM pyruvate (Gibco, Cat#11360-070). Seahorse Glyco Stress Test XF DMEM assay media contained 4 mM glutamine. The assay was performed according to Agilent Mito Stress Test and Glyco Stress Test instructions. Extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) shown are per 5000 cells. ATP metrics were calculated following Mookerjee et al., 2017 [ 50 ] and using the CEAS R Package [ 51 ]. 2.10 Stable isotope labeling and metabolomics For stable isotope labeling experiments with  in vitro  MCF7 NF1-EV and NF1-45 cells, cells were grown in DMEM no phenol red, 10 % FBS, 5 mL penicillin-streptomycin, and treated with 10 nM beta-estradiol for 48 h. Cells were washed in PBS and incubated in DMEM no phenol red, no glucose, no glutamine (Gibco, Cat# A1443001), 10 % dialyzed FBS (dFBS) (Dialyzed from VWR, Cat# 1300-500), 5 mL penicillin-streptomycin, and 10 nM beta-estradiol with either 25 mM [U– 13 C]-glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Cat# CLM-1396-PK) and 4 mM [U– 12 C]-glutamine (Gibco, Cat# 21051-040) or 25 mM [U– 12 C]-glucose (Fischer Scientific, Cat#D16-500) and 4 mM [U– 13 C]-glutamine (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Cat# CLM-1822-H-PK) for 2 h. After 2hr, cells were washed 2X with ice-cold NaCl saline (Gibco Cat# S8776), snap-frozen on dry ice, and stored at −80 °C. Metabolites were extracted using a modified Bligh Dyer method [ 52 ]. This modified Bligh Dyer extraction involves the addition of ice-cold methanol (Fisher Chemical, Cat# A456-4) to the cell plate (Corning, Cat# 3506) from which cells are scraped and transferred to an Eppendorf tube containing ice-cold chloroform (Millipore Sigma, Cat# 1024441000) and water (Fisher Chemical, Cat# W6-4), with a final v/v ratio of 2:2:1.8 methanol to chloroform to water. The cell extract was then vortexed for 10 s and incubated on wet ice for 30 min. The samples were then vortexed again for 10 s and spun down at 4 °C for 10 min at 13,000rpm to achieve aqueous and organic phase separation. The aqueous and organic phases were collected and dried down in a speedvac. 2.11 LC-MS method (aqueous) For liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis, the aqueous dry-down was resuspended in 50 μL of 50:50 acetonitrile (Fisher Scientific, Cat# A955) and water. The resuspended metabolite extracts were analyzed on an Orbitrap ID-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a Thermo Vanquish Horizon LC system. Each sample injection was 2 μL. The Van Andel Institute Mass Spectrometry Core performed chromatographic separation using Acquity BEH Amide (1.7 μm, 2.1 mm × 150 mm) analytical columns (Waters, Eschborn, Germany, Cat#176001909). These columns were fitted with a pre-guard column (Waters, 1.7 μm, 2.1 mm × 5 mm; Cat# 186004799) and used an elution gradient with two solvents. Solvent A was LC/MS grade water, and Solvent B was 90 % LC/MS grade acetonitrile. For negative mode analysis, both mobile phases contained 10 mM ammonium acetate (Millipore Sigma, Cat# 73594-100G-F), 0.1 % ammonium hydroxide (Fisher Scientific, Cat# A470-250), and 5 μM medronic acid. For positive mode analysis, both mobile phases included 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1 % formic acid (Fisher Chemical, Cat# A11710X1-AMP). The 20-minute gradient at 400 μL/min consisted of the following phases: 0–1.0 min (100 % B to 90 % B), 1.0–12.5 min (90 % B to 75 % B), 12.5–19 min (75 % B to 60 % B), and 19–20 min (60 % B). After each run, the column was re-equilibrated over 20 min. The column temperature was maintained at 40 °C. The heated electrospray ionization (H-ESI) source used a spray voltage of −2500 V (negative mode) or 3500 V (positive mode). The isotopically labeled experimental replicates were collected in full-scan mode with an MS1 scan range from 70 to 1000  m / z , a mass resolution of 120,000 FWHM, RF lens at 35 %, and automatic gain control. The unlabeled samples were used for data-dependent MS2 (ddMS2) fragmentation and were annotated using AquireX workflow. ddMS2 data was obtained with MS1 resolution set at 60,000, MS2 resolution at 30,000, an intensity threshold of 2.0 x 104, and dynamic exclusion activated after a single trigger for a duration of 10 s. MS2 fragmentation comprised HCD at 20 %, 35 %, and 50 % collision energies, which was followed by CID at 15 %, 30 %, and 45 % with an activation Q of 0.25. Both MS2 scans used standard automatic gain control and a maximum injection time of 54 ms. The total cycle time for MS1 and ddMS2 scans was 0.6 s. 2.12 LC-MS method (organic) The organic dry-down was resuspended in 50 μL of 50:50 isopropanol (Fisher Scientific, Cat# A461-4):water. The resuspended metabolite extracts were analyzed on an Orbitrap ID-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a Thermo Vanquish Horizon LC system. Each sample injection was 2 μL. The Van Andel Institute Mass Spectrometry Core performed chromatographic separation using C30 (2.6 μm, 2.1 mm × 150 mm) analytical columns (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# 27826–152130). These columns were fitted with a pre-guard column (1.7 μm, 2.1 mm × 5 mm; Waters, Cat# 186004799) and used an elution gradient with two solvents. Solvent A was 60 % acetonitrile, 40 % water, 0.1 % formic acid, 10 mM ammonium formate (Fisher Scientific, Cat# A11550), and Solvent B was 90 % isopropanol, 8 % acetonitrile, 2 % water, 0.1 % formic acid, 10 mM ammonium formate. The 30-minute gradient at 400 μL/min consisted of the following phases: 0–1.0 min (75%A), 1.0–3.0 min (75%A to 60%A), 3–19 min (60%A to 25%A), 19–20.5 min (25 % A to 10 % A), 20.5–28 min (10 % A to 5 % A), and 28.1–30 min (5 %–0%A). After each run, the column was re-equilibrated over 15 min. The column temperature was maintained at 50 °C. The heated electrospray ionization (H-ESI) source used a spray voltage of −2800 V (negative mode) or 3250 V (positive mode). The isotopically labeled experimental replicates were collected in full-scan mode with an MS1 scan range from 200 to 1000  m / z , a esoluteion of 240,000 FWHM, RF lens at 45 %, and automatic gain control. The unlabeled samples were used for data dependent MS3 (ddMS3) fragmentation. ddMS2 scans were collected with HCD fragmentation settings (Assisted Collision Energy Mode, Normalized HCD Collision Energies at 15 %, 30 %, 45 %, 75 %, and 110 % energy levels, Orbitrap resolution: 15,000). A  m / z  184 mass trigger, indicative of phosphatidylcholines, was used for CID fragmentation (Collision energy: 35 %, activation time: 10 ms, Orbitrap resolution: 15,000). CID MS3 scans were triggered by specific acyl chain losses for detailed analysis of mono-, di-, and tri-acylglycerides (Collision energy: 35 %, activation time: 10 ms, Ion trap detection at Rapid Scan Rate). 2.13 LC-MS data analysis Lipid identifications were assigned using LipidSearch (v5.0, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Data was analyzed using Compound Discoverer (v 3.2, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Compounds were identified via retention compared external standards and MS2 spectral matching using the mzCloud database (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Mass isotopologue distribution analysis was performed using isotopologue peak area data from labeled and unlabeled samples, natural abundance correction was performed using an internal VAI matrix-based algorithm like those described in Fernandez et al., 1996 and Trefely et al., 2016. PCA analysis was performed using the FactoMineR R package. 2.14 FBS dialysis To deplete glucose and glutamine from the FBS used during stable isotope labeling, we prepared dialyzed FBS. In short, FBS was pipetted into SnakeSkin™ Dialysis Tubing, 10K MWCO, 35 mm, 10.5m (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# 88245). The tubing was clamped closed using SnakeSkin Dialysis clips (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# 68011). The FBS-containing dialysis tubing was suspended in 1X PBS (1:300 ratio of FBS:PBS) using a foam Eppendorf tube holder. The PBS was stirred around the FBS-containing tubing using a magnetic stir bar and stir plate for 2hr at 4 °C, after which the PBS was discarded and replaced. The PBS was then stirred around the FBS-containing tubing for 3hr at 4 °C, after which the PBS was discarded and replaced. Lastly, the PBS was stirred around the FBS-containing tubing for 18–20hr at 4 °C, after which the FBS was pipetted out of the tubing, filtered with a 0.22 μM filter (VWR, Cat# 28145-501), aliquoted, and stored at −20 °C. In total, the FBS was dialyzed against 1X PBS for approximately 24hr. Mass spectrometry was used to confirm metabolite depletion ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). 2.15 Targeted and metabolic inhibitor  in vitro  drug studies MCF7 cells were grown in DMEM no phenol red, 10 % FBS, 5 mL penicillin-streptomycin and treated with 10 nM beta-estradiol and the targeted and/or metabolic inhibitors for 48hr in a Sartorius IncuCyte: Tamoxifen (4OHT) (Sigma, Cat# H7904), Cobimetinib (COB) (Genentech, gifted), Everolimus (EVE) (Selleckchem, Cat# S1120), 2-Deoxy- d -glucose (2DG) (Sigma, Cat# D8375), bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide (BPTES) (Cayman Chemical Company, Cat# 19284), Etomoxir (EX) (Cayman Chemical Company, Cat# 11969), PF-04620110 (Cayman Chemical Company, Cat# 16425), PF-06424439 (Cayman Chemical Company, Cat# 17680). Cell proliferation was measured via cell confluency and doublings per day were calculated via the equation: Doublings per day = (final confluency/starting confluency)/assay duration (2 days). Synergy was calculated using the SynergyFinder R package.",Rachel Rae J House; Elizabeth A Tovar; Luke N Redlon; Curt J Essenburg; Patrick S Dischinger; Abigail E Ellis; Ian Beddows; Ryan D Sheldon; Evan C Lien; Carrie R Graveel; Matthew R Steensma,Molecular metabolism,2024-02,10.1016/j.molmet.2024.101876,minimal,True
PMID:7947085,"Frequency of allele loss of DCC, p53, RBI, WT1, NF1, NM23 and APC/MCC in colorectal cancer assayed by fluorescent multiplex polymerase chain reaction.","We report here the use of multiplex fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for quantitative allele loss detection using microsatellites with 2-5 base pair repeat motifs. Allele loss of APC, DCC, p53 and RB1 in colorectal tumours has been reported previously using a variety of methods. However, not all workers used intragenic markers. We have used microsatellite polymorphisms which map within, or are closely linked to, these tumour-suppressor gene loci in order to determine whether these loci are indeed the targets for alteration in colorectal cancer. In addition, we have assayed two other tumour-suppressor genes, WT1 and NF1, to see whether they play a role in colorectal carcinogenesis. The putative metastasis-suppressor gene, NM23, was also investigated since there have been conflicting reports about its involvement in colorectal carcinogenesis. Allele loss was detected at the DCC (29%), p53 (66%), RB1 (50%) and NF1 (14%) loci and in the APC/MCC region (50%), but not at the WT1 or NM23 loci. These rapid, and mostly gene-specific, fluorescent multiplex PCR assays for allele loss detection could be modified to devise a single molecular diagnostic test for the important lesions in colorectal cancer.",,L Cawkwell; F A Lewis; P Quirke,British journal of cancer,1994-11,10.1038/bjc.1994.404,abstract_only,False
PMID:7686513,An exon-trapping system with a newly constructed trapping vector pEXT2; its application to the proximal region of the human chromosome 21 long arm.,"We have developed an exon-trapping system with a newly constructed trapping vector containing multiple cloning sites (designated pEXT2). The system revealed high sensitivity for trapping a control exon from several hundred kbp of DNA. We have applied the system to the cosmid clones located on human chromosome 21p11-q21, and identified two fragments highly homologous to neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) gene and a clearly transcribed fragment hybridized with approximately 1.6 kb RNA from human brain and human glioblastoma A172 cell.",,N Ozawa; T Kano; C Taga; M Hattori; Y Sakaki; H Suzuki,FEBS letters,1993-07-05,10.1016/0014-5793(93)81094-g,abstract_only,False
PMID:33963966,Cognitive and Electrophysiological Correlates of Working Memory Impairments in Neurofibromatosis Type 1.,"Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a single gene disorder associated with working Memory (WM) impairments. The aim of this study was to investigate P300 event-related potential (ERP) associated with WM in NF1. Sixteen adolescents with NF1 were compared with controls on measures of WM and EEG was recorded during a WM nback task. The NF1 group showed poorer performance on measures of WM as compared to the control group. No group differences were observed in P300 amplitude at Pz, but P300 latency was shorter in the NF1 group. Topographic analyses of P300 amplitude showed group differences indicating neural processing differences in the NF1 group relative to controls, which possibly contribute to the cognitive deficits seen in this population.","Methods Design and Participants The NF1 sample was recruited via the cohort of patients at the Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine and through NF charities newsletters and social media pages. Participants were children aged 12–17 years meeting the National Institute of Health (National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference,  1988 ) diagnostic criteria for NF1. The exclusion criteria were (i) history of epilepsy, (ii) ongoing active treatment for any NF1 related complications (such as chemotherapy for optic glioma), or (iii) other clinically significant unrelated illness. Participants on neuroleptic or stimulant medications were not excluded from this study. All patients that met the eligibility criteria for the study were sent study information packs and were invited to return their indication of interest forms if they wished to participate in the study. A community age and sex matched control sample was recruited through advertisements in the institutional newsletters and approaching local schools in the area. Inclusion criteria for the control group were (i) children aged 12–17 years and (ii) absence of any pre—existing medical conditions or neurodevelopmental disorders. Procedure Once the research team received the ‘Indication of Interest’ form, contact was made with the potential participant family to establish eligibility over the telephone and book the study visit. Oral and written consent from parents and assent from children (where developmentally appropriate) was obtained. Parent rated measure of child adaptive functioning was obtained as a proxy for developmental level. The behavioural assessments were first administered in the lab followed by the EEG session. Clinical notes of the participants were reviewed to confirm comorbid diagnoses of neurodevelopmental disorders.",Gorana Pobric; Jason R Taylor; Hemavathy M Ramalingam; Emily Pye; Louise Robinson; Grace Vassallo; JeYoung Jung; Misty Bhandary; Karolina Szumanska-Ryt; Louise Theodosiou; D Gareth Evans; Judith Eelloo; Emma Burkitt-Wright; Johan Hulleman; Jonathan Green; Shruti Garg,Journal of autism and developmental disorders,2022-04,10.1007/s10803-021-05043-3,minimal,True
PMID:33817379,Clinical assessment of the use of topical liquid diclofenac following laser microporation of cutaneous neurofibromas in individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1.,"BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder with a prevalence of 1:3000 births and a wide variety of clinical manifestations. Cutaneous neurofibromas (cNF) are among the most common visible manifestations of NF1 and present a major clinical burden for patients. NF1 patients with cNF often report decreased quality of life, emotional well-being and physical comfort. Developing effective medical therapies for cNF has been identified as a priority for the majority of adults with NF1. METHODS: The study was an open, controlled and prospective proof-of-concept clinical trial. The topical treatment consisted of two steps: cNF microporation using a laser device followed by topical application of one drop of diclofenac 25 mg/mL on the surface of the cNF (T neurofibroma = treatment) or physiological saline (C neurofibroma = control) and reapplied twice daily for 3 days. Neurofibroma assessments included visual and dermatoscopy observations noting color and presence of necrosis, presence of flaccidity, measurements in two dimensions, photographs, and histopathology after excision. The primary efficacy variable was the presence of tissue necrosis. The primary safety variable was the occurrence of treatment-related adverse events. RESULTS: Six patients were included in the study. The treatment resulted in transitory topical changes (healing of the microporation grid with formation of scintillating tissue layer, hyperemia and desquamation), with no statistically significant variation in the dimensions of the T and C neurofibromas in relation to pretreatment measurements. There was no necrosis in the T or C neurofibromas. In the histopathological analysis, there was no significant difference in the distribution of chronic (lymphocytic) inflammatory infiltrate in the papillary reticular dermis (subepithelial), type of infiltrate (diffuse, perivascular, or both), presence of fibrosis, and presence of atrophy among the T and C neurofibromas. No adverse events attributable to the use of diclofenac were reported during the treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment did not result in significant alterations in terms of presence of tissue necrosis, size, or histopathological features in the T neurofibromas or in comparison to the C neurofibromas. Topical diclofenac with laser microporation was well-tolerated, with no adverse events attributable to diclofenac reported. Whether these observations are due to minimal systemic and neurofibroma exposure remain to be explored in dosage studies with larger patient groups. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03090971) retrospectively registered March 27, 2017.","Methods The study was an open, controlled and prospective proof-of-concept clinical trial. The topical treatment consisted of two steps: cNF microporation using a laser device followed by topical application of one drop of diclofenac 25 mg/mL on the surface of the cNF (T neurofibroma = treatment) or physiological saline (C neurofibroma = control) and reapplied twice daily for 3 days.

The primary efficacy variable was the presence of tissue necrosis. The primary safety variable was the occurrence of treatment-related adverse events. 2 Methods 2.1 Objectives The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of using topical diclofenac 25 mg/ml in the treatment of cutaneous neurofibromas in individuals with NF1. 2.2 Study design and population The study was an open, controlled, prospective, proof-of-concept clinical trial conducted at UNIFESO Medical School in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The study protocol received local ethical committee approval from the institution (approval no. 925.891) and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (ID:  NCT03090971 ). All participants provided written informed consent prior to data collection. The inclusion criteria included patients with a clinical diagnosis of NF1 according to the NIH Consensus Development Conference NF1 diagnostic criteria (NIH, 1998) and had four or more cNFs measuring 0.5–1.2 cm in greatest diameter present on either the thorax, abdomen, and upper or lower limbs (measured in a single plane). In keeping with the previous study [ 22 ], seven patients initially satisfied these inclusion criteria and six were enrolled in the study (one patient was unable to participate due to an unrelated family matter). 2.3 Treatment The study period lasted a total of 37 days and consisted of three treatment visits and three follow-up visits to the study center: Visit 1 (Pretreatment/Day 1), Visit 2 (Day 4), Visit 3 (Day 7), Visit 4 (Day 10), Visit 5 (Day 17) and Visit 6 (Day 37). The schedule of study assessments is shown in  Table 1 . Table 1 Schedule of study assessments.

Each cNF was marked with a subject identification number (001, 002, 003, 004, 005, 006) and neurofibroma number (1, 2) using a marker with black ink. Each cNF was photographed three times at each visit, using a digital camera with a minimum resolution of 800 × 600 and macro capacity with a zoom lens of 35–105mm. Photographs were taken at a 90° angle from the specified cNF. The angle of exposure was maintained in all photographs. During Visits 1, 2 and 3, cNF underwent laser microporation and were treated with diclofenac or saline solution on Day 1, Day 4 and Day 7, respectively. cNFs were laser-porated using the P.L.E.A.S.E.® device with the following user-defined settings: density of 10%, 5 pulses per pore, repetition rate of 300 Hz, pulse duration of 125 μs, pore array size of 10mm and fluence of 36.2 J/cm 2 . After microporation, researchers topically applied one drop of diclofenac 25 mg/ml (Voltaren®) to the surface of the T neurofibromas (T neurofibroma = treatment) or physiological 0.9% saline solution to the surface of C neurofibromas (C neurofibroma = control). Patients were then directed to re-apply the respective study medication twice daily for three days at home following instructions given during Visit 1 on how to locate each neurofibroma and apply the study medication. Subjects were instructed to return to the study center at three-day intervals for another round of laser microporation and topical application, followed again by at-home topical application for three more days. After the treatment period, Visits 4, 5 and 6 solely consisted of the follow-up assessments on Day 10, Day 17 and Day 37, respectively. Therefore, the three follow-up assessments took place 3, 7, and 30 days after the final round of laser microporation. At the researcher's discretion, additional follow-up visits were scheduled to evaluate the neurofibroma healing process. The T and C neurofibromas of all participating subjects were surgically removed at the end of the study (at the end of Visit 6), fixed in 10% buffered-formaldehyde, and sent for histopathological analysis. Samples were handled and processed according to routine histological procedures and a 5-μm hematoxylin & eosin section was used for morphological analysis. The histopathological evaluations were performed by two independent pathologists. 2.4 Measurements & data collection Primary outcome measures indicating clinical efficacy were the presence of an inflammatory process and tissue necrosis in T neurofibromas. Secondary outcome variables included the reduction in T neurofibroma size or detachment of T neurofibromas. The primary endpoint for the study was the presence of necrosis on T neurofibromas. Secondary endpoints included change in color, shape, and structure of the T neurofibromas and occurrence of adverse events (including any significant changes to laboratory exams). At each visit, subjects underwent serial physical examinations, recording of adverse events, and assessment of both T and C neurofibromas. The assessment of T and C neurofibromas included visual and dermatoscopy observations (using the Dermlite DL3 [3Gen, San Jan Capistrano, CA, USA]) noting color and presence of necrosis, presence of flaccidity, and size. The neurofibromas were measured in two axes using a measuring tape: (x [horizontal] and y [vertical]). Patient safety was evaluated by adverse event monitoring and dermatological assessments of local and global skin reactions considered to be associated with topical diclofenac application during the 7-day treatment period and 30-day follow-up period. Adverse event grading followed that of the previous study: Mild (conscious of the event, but easily tolerated); Moderate (sufficient discomfort to interfere with daily activities); Severe (inability to perform daily activities). Primary outcome measures indicating safety of topical use was the occurrence of an adverse event. Secondary outcome measures included data from clinical evaluations (physical examination and vital signs), severity and duration of adverse events, and any changes in laboratory parameters. During Visit 1, a full medical history was obtained, a complete physical examination, including vital signs, were recorded, concomitant medications used within 30 days of inclusion were noted, and laboratory evaluations were performed in order to evaluate the safety of topical diclofenac use in each participating subject. In addition to Visit 1 (pretreatment), laboratory evaluations were also performed during Visits 2, 3, and 6 at the same laboratory (Laboratório Richet, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). The laboratory evaluations included a urinalysis, complete blood count, liver function tests (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], alkaline phosphatase, total and direct bilirubins), basic metabolic profile (urea, creatinine, sodium, and potassium) and magnesium. Throughout the duration of the 37-day study period, concomitant medication use was monitored during each subsequent visit. Adherence to study protocol was evaluated at Visit 2, 3 and 4. 2.5 Statistical analysis Data was collected on a clinical research form and analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 5.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego California USA). Frequency tables were generated and central tendencies (mean, median, mode) were calculated. Overall clinical efficacy and safety were statistically analyzed by comparing the results of Visits 2–6 with in relation to pretreatment values at Visit 1. Categorical variables were analyzed using chi-squared or Fisher's Exact test was used, while continuous variables were analyzed with repeated measures ANOVA or Student's T-test with a significance level of 0.05 and 95%CI.",Lisa Brauer Oliveira; Mauro Geller; Karin Soares Cunha; Alessandra Santos; Allan Bernacchi; Allan E Rubenstein; Sanyu Takirambudde; Spyros Mezitis; Carolina de Almeida Ito Brum; Luiz Guilherme Darrigo; Marcia Gonçalves Ribeiro,Heliyon,2021-03,10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06518,minimal,True
PMID:34075397,PAK1 inhibition reduces tumor size and extends the lifespan of mice in a genetically engineered mouse model of Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2).,"Neurofibromatosis Type II (NF2) is an autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome in which germline haploinsufficiency at the NF2 gene confers a greatly increased propensity for tumor development arising from tissues of neural crest derived origin. NF2 encodes the tumor suppressor, Merlin, and its biochemical function is incompletely understood. One well-established function of Merlin is as a negative regulator of group A serine/threonine p21-activated kinases (PAKs). In these studies we explore the role of PAK1 and its closely related paralog, PAK2, both pharmacologically and genetically, in Merlin-deficient Schwann cells and in a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) that develops spontaneous vestibular and spinal schwannomas. We demonstrate that PAK1 and PAK2 are both hyper activated in Merlin-deficient murine schwannomas. In preclinical trials, a pan Group A PAK inhibitor, FRAX-1036, transiently reduced PAK1 and PAK2 phosphorylation in vitro, but had insignificant efficacy in vivo. NVS-PAK1-1, a PAK1 selective inhibitor, had a greater but still minimal effect on our GEMM phenotype. However, genetic ablation of Pak1 but not Pak2 reduced tumor formation in our NF2 GEMM. Moreover, germline genetic deletion of Pak1 was well tolerated, while conditional deletion of Pak2 in Schwann cells resulted in significant morbidity and mortality. These data support the further development of PAK1-specific small molecule inhibitors and the therapeutic targeting of PAK1 in vestibular schwannomas and argue against PAK1 and PAK2 existing as functionally redundant protein isoforms in Schwann cells.",,Eric Hawley; Jeffrey Gehlhausen; Sofiia Karchugina; Hoi-Yee Chow; Daniela Araiza-Olivera; Maria Radu; Abbi Smith; Ciersten Burks; Li Jiang; Xiaohong Li; Waylan Bessler; Andrea Masters; Donna Edwards; Callie Burgin; David Jones; Charles Yates; D Wade Clapp; Jonathan Chernoff; Su-Jung Park,Human molecular genetics,2021-08-12,10.1093/hmg/ddab106,abstract_only,False
PMID:19846776,PTEN dosage is essential for neurofibroma development and malignant transformation.,"Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) carry approximately a 10% lifetime risk of developing a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). Although the molecular mechanisms underlying NF1 to MPNST malignant transformation remain unclear, alterations of both the RAS/RAF/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways have been implicated. In a series of genetically engineered murine models, we perturbed RAS/RAF/MAPK or/and PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway, individually or simultaneously, via conditional activation of K-ras oncogene or deletion of Nf1 or Pten tumor suppressor genes. Only K-Ras activation in combination with a single Pten allele deletion led to 100% penetrable development of NF lesions and subsequent progression to MPNST. Importantly, loss or decrease in PTEN expression was found in all murine MPNSTs and a majority of human NF1-associated MPNST lesions, suggesting that PTEN dosage and its controlled signaling pathways are critical for transformation of NFs to MPNST. Using noninvasive in vivo PET-CT imaging, we demonstrated that FDG can be used to identify the malignant transformation in both murine and human MPNSTs. Our data suggest that combined inhibition of RAS/RAF/MAPK and PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathways may be beneficial for patients with MPNST.",,Caroline Gregorian; Jonathan Nakashima; Sarah M Dry; P Leia Nghiemphu; Kate Barzan Smith; Yan Ao; Julie Dang; Gregory Lawson; Ingo K Mellinghoff; Paul S Mischel; Michael Phelps; Luis F Parada; Xin Liu; Michael V Sofroniew; Fritz C Eilber; Hong Wu,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2009-11-17,10.1073/pnas.0910398106,abstract_only,False

In this study, we found that sEVs secreted by NF2-associated schwannomas (NF2-EVs) facilitate the conversion of CD14","2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Patients The study protocols received approval from Beijing Tiantan Hospital’s institutional review boards, and written consent was obtained from all participating patients. Patient samples were collected from individuals diagnosed with NF2-SWN, as confirmed by neuropathologists at Beijing Tiantan Hospital. For more details about the NF2-SWN patients, refer to  Table 1 . 2.2. Primary Schwannoma Cells Isolation and Culture Primary cells were isolated using the methods described by Rosenbaum et al. [ 18 ]. Schwannoma tissues were dissected into smaller fragments and enzymatically digested with dispase grade II (1.25 U/mL, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and collagenase type I (160 U/mL, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). The resulting cells were suspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma), Pen/Strep (200 U/mL, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), forskolin (0.5μM, Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK), β1-heregulin (10 nM, R&D System, Minneapolis, MN, USA), and insulin (2.5 μg/mL, Sigma). These cells were then seeded into poly-L-lysine-coated (1 mg/mL, Sigma) and laminin-coated (4 μg/mL, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) 24-well plates. The medium was changed every four days, and the cells were passaged when reaching a confluence level of 70~80%. 2.3. SEVs Isolation The cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS until they reached 80% confluence. Once the desired confluence was achieved, the culture medium was carefully removed, and the cells were rinsed once with PBS. They were then incubated in serum-free medium for 48 h. Following this incubation period, the collected medium underwent a series of centrifugation steps. Initially, it was centrifuged at 300×  g  for 10 min at 4 °C, followed by a second centrifugation at 2000×  g  for 10 min at the same temperature. The supernatant obtained from this step was then subjected to further centrifugation at 10,000×  g  for 10 min at 4 °C. Finally, the resulting supernatant underwent centrifugation at an impressive 110,000×  g  for 2 h at 4 °C, yielding purified sEVs. These sEVs were subsequently resuspended in pre-cooled PBS. 2.4. Transmission Electron Microscopy The morphology and approximate size of the isolated sEVs were assessed using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM, Gatan Inc., Pleasanton, CA, USA). The isolated sEVs were suspended in PBS and carefully applied to Formvar-coated copper grids. The prepared samples were then affixed to metal stubs and gold-coated to a thickness of 15 nm. The exosome sample was analyzed under a TEM microscope. 2.5. Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) The ZetaView (Particle Metrix, version 8.04.02) was utilized to perform a detailed absolute size distribution analysis of the sEVs. Illuminated by a laser, the sEVs scattered light, which was captured by a camera, creating a video file that showcased their Brownian motion. The ZetaView meticulously tracked and analyzed individual particles ranging from 10 to 1000 nm in size. Each sample underwent three recordings to ensure comprehensive analysis. 2.6. Analysis of MDSC Percentages in Co-Culture The CD14 +  monocytes were collected after being exposed for 24 h to NF2-EVs, and then filtered using 70 µm cell strainers (BD Falcon, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). The resulting single-cell suspension was then re-suspended in FACS staining buffer, and stained with anti-HLA-DR Percp-cy5.5 (eBioscience, 0.015 µg/test, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-CD33 APC (eBioscience, 0.125 µg/test), and anti-CD11b FITC antibodies (eBioscience, 0.5 µg/test), along with corresponding isotype controls. Flow cytometry analysis was conducted using a (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), and the data were processed with FlowJo software (version X10.0.7). 2.7. Detection of Intracellular ROS Generation For the detection of intracellular ROS levels, ROS-sensitive probe DCFH-DA is used. Monocytes, both control and NF2 EV-treated, are resuspended in PBS, incubated with 5 µM of DCFH-DA in the dark for 30 min at 37 °C, and immediately analyzed with a flow cytometer. 2.8. Cell Viability Assay Cell viability was evaluated using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8, Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan). In this process, cells were plated at a density of 1 × 10 4  cells per well in 96-well plates and treated with either PBS or NF2-EVs for periods of 0, 24, or 48 h. At the conclusion of each treatment interval, 10 µL of CCK8 solution was added to each well and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The resulting color intensity was then measured at 450 nm using the SpectraMax M5 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). Cell viability was expressed as a percentage relative to control cells cultured in NF2-exosome-free medium, which was designated as 100%. Each assay was conducted in triplicate to ensure reliability and accuracy. 2.9. Luminex Liquid Suspension Chip Detection For the Luminex assay, the conditioned medium from stimulated MDSCs was collected. Wayen Biotechnologies facilitated the Luminex liquid suspension chip detection. We utilized the Bio-Plex Pro Human Cytokine Group I Panel 27-plex, following the manufacturer’s instructions meticulously to ensure optimal results. 2.10. Mass Spectrum Analysis An Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA), paired with the EASY-nLC 1000 liquid chromatography system (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) was employed for a comprehensive analysis of proteins, encompassing both qualitative and quantitative dimensions. The dried samples were rehydrated using 0.1% formic acid (FA) and then separated on a custom-made analytical column measuring 75 μm I.D. × 25 cm, packed with C18 resin (C18, 1.9 μm, 120 Å, Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch, Germany). The flow rate was meticulously set to 300 nL/min. Full scans were conducted over a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) range of 350 to 1800, achieving a remarkable mass resolution of 60,000 (FWHM). Precursor ions were fragmented through high-energy collision dissociation (HCD) at a normalized collision energy (NCE) of 30%, ensuring precise and detailed analysis. 2.11. Western Blot Total proteins from different treated cells were extracted using Radio immunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer. After measuring the protein concentration, 20–40 μg of protein per sample were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were then blocked at room temperature for 2 h with 5% non-fat milk and incubated at 4 °C overnight with diluted (1:1000) primary antibodies against CD9 (Proteintech, 60232-1-Ig, Wuhan, China), CD81 (Proteintech, 66866-1-Ig), TOMM20 (Proteintech, 11802-1-AP), HSP90 (Proteintech, 13171-1-AP), AKT (CST, #9272S, Danvers, MA, USA), p-AKT (CST, #4051S), ERK (CST, #4695), p-ERK (CST, #9101S), following by incubation with appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and detection by Western-Light Chemiluminescent Detection System. The Image J software (version 1.51) was used to analyze the relative density of immunoreactive bands. The densitometry data for all Western results can be found in  Table S1 . 2.12. PPI Regulatory Network Analysis We used the STRING database (version 11.0) ( https://cn.string-db.org/ ) to construct a PPI network to show the relationships of the DeMiRNAs. A comprehensive score over 0.9 was used to indicate statistical significance, and we hid nodes that were not connected with other entities in the network. Cytoscape (version 3.7.2) was used to construct the network, and the hub genes in the PPI network were analyzed using cytohubba in Cytoscape (version 3.7.2). 2.13. Statistical Analysis Differences in quantitative normally distributed variables between 2 groups were tested with Student’s  t -test and  p  values less than 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. Data are expressed as the Mean ± SD, and analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (version 9.5.0).",Ying Wang; Yuan Ren; Qi Zhang; Chao Zhang; Minjun Yan; Xin Ma; Bo Wang; Peng Li; Pinan Liu,"Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2025-10-13,10.3390/curroncol32100569,minimal,True
PMID:20200958,Local low-dose lovastatin delivery improves the bone-healing defect caused by Nf1 loss of function in osteoblasts.,"Postfracture tibial nonunion (pseudoarthrosis) leads to lifelong disability in patients with neurofibromatosis type I (NF1), a disorder caused by mutations in the NF1 gene. To determine the contribution of NF1 in bone healing, we assessed bone healing in the Nf1(ob) (-/-) conditional mouse model lacking Nf1 specifically in osteoblasts. A closed distal tibia fracture protocol and a longitudinal study design were used. During the 21- to 28-day postfracture period, callus volume, as expected, decreased in wild-type but not in Nf1(ob) (-/-) mice, suggesting delayed healing. At these two time points, bone volume (BV/TV) and volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) measured by 3D micro-computed tomography were decreased in Nf1(ob) (-/-) callus-bridging cortices and trabecular compartments compared with wild-type controls. Histomorphometric analyses revealed the presence of cartilaginous remnants, a high amount of osteoid, and increased osteoclast surfaces in Nf1(ob) (-/-) calluses 21 days after fracture, which was accompanied by increased expression of osteopontin, Rankl, and Tgfbeta. Callus strength measured by three-point bending 28 days after fracture was reduced in Nf1(ob) (-/-) versus wild-type calluses. Importantly, from a clinical point of view, this defect of callus maturation and strength could be ameliorated by local delivery of low-dose lovastatin microparticles, which successfully decreased osteoid volume and cartilaginous remnant number and increased callus BV/TV and strength in mutant mice. These results thus indicate that the dysfunctions caused by loss of Nf1 in osteoblasts impair callus maturation and weaken callus mechanical properties and suggest that local delivery of low-dose lovastatin may improve bone healing in NF1 patients.","Materials and Methods Animals and experimental procedures All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. WT and   mice were generated by crossing 2.3-kb  α1(I) collagen -cre  Nf1 flox/flox  mice and  Nf1 flox/flox  mice, as described previously.( 21 ) All fractures were generated in 2-month-old male mice using the three-point bending method described by Bonnarens and Einhorn.( 23 ) Fifteen mice were assigned per group, and 10 to 12 mice per group were analyzed after eliminating mice with improper fractures (see “Results”). Anesthesia of the animals was induced and maintained with 2% inhaled isoflurane in 100% oxygen. After adequate sedation, the surgical site was sterilized with 70% ethanol, and an incision was made below the right knee. A 27-gauge sterile needle was inserted through the patellar tendon to make an entry point in the tibial epiphysis. Then a 0.25-mm-diameter sterile stainless steel insect pin (Fine Science Tools, Foster City, CA, USA) was inserted into the tibia. Distal tibia fractures were produced using a force exerted by a 220-g weight dropped from a height of 195 mm. Proper fracture position and quality were confirmed via radiography obtained using a digital cabinet X-ray system (LX-60, Faxitron X-Ray, LLC, Wheeling, IL, USA). Mice were allowed to recover on a heated pad and then were placed in recovery cages. Then 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg of buprenorphine was administered subcutaneously once after the fracture generation and then every 12 hours as required. Lovastatin microparticles (10 mg/kg of mouse body weight) were locally injected adjacent to the fracture site once at the time of fracture. Fracture healing was monitored by weekly radiographs. At 21 and 28 days after fracture, animals were euthanized, and tibias were collected. Surrounding soft tissue and stainless steel pins were removed prior to further analyses. Samples were either frozen in PBS (for biomechanical studies), snap frozen in liquid N 2  (for molecular studies), or fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 24 hours and then stored in 70% alcohol at 4°C (for µCT and histomorphometric analyses). Lovastatin microparticle generation and release profile Spherical lovastatin microparticles were prepared using an emulsion process. Lovastatin (GMP grade; CNH Technologies, Woburn, MA, USA) was dissolved in reagent-grade methylene chloride. This solution was combined with a chilled aqueous surfactant solution presaturated with methylene chloride using a high-speed mixer. The emulsion so formed was poured into an aqueous extraction bath of chilled water. The organic solvent fully dissolved in the extraction bath, and the insoluble lovastatin particles precipitated. Particles were separated and concentrated by pouring over a series of sieves between 53 and 125 µm in order to achieve the target 70-µm particle size and then rinsed with deionized water. The collected particle suspension then was frozen and lyophilized to yield the free-flowing lovastatin microparticles. Particles were stored at 2 to 8°C until use. Assessment of in vitro release was performed using 10 mg of lovastatin microspheres. The lovastatin microparticles were placed in a round-bottom 14-mL polypropylene test tube. A 3-mL volume of release medium, 1% polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate (Tween 80) in PBS (pH 7.4), then was added. Tubes were capped with serum-separating filters and placed in a water shaker bath at 37°C. At specified times, the supernatant was separated from particles by filtration through the serum filter. All supernatant was removed and a portion retained for analysis. The full supernatant volume was replenished with release medium, the serum filter was replaced, and the tube was returned to the shaker bath. Lovastatin content in supernatant was quantified by HPLC using a stability-indicating method described in  United States Pharmacopoeia : USP 29. Callus evaluation by quantitative µCT Quantitative characteristics of the callus were evaluated using an ex vivo µCT imaging system (Scanco µCT 40, Scanco Medical, Bassersdorf, Switzerland). Immersed in PBS, the tibia was fit into the specimen tube such that the long axis aligned with the scanning axis. After setting the callus as the region of interest, tomographic images were acquired at 55 kV and 145 mA with an isotropic voxel size of 12 µm and at an integration time of 250 ms with 500 projections collected per 180-degree rotation. For 100 slices above and below the fracture line, contours were fit to the outer perimeter of the callus using the autocontouring feature in the Scanco software. Applying the same threshold to each callus, volume of callus bone tissue (TV), callus bone volume (BV), and volumetric density (in mgHA/cm 3 ) of the mineralized tissue (vBMD) were measured as a fraction of mineralized tissue within the callus, excluding the original tibia shaft. Lastly, using a method described by Nyman and colleagues,( 24 ) defects in the outer bridging cortices were quantified, excluding callus trabecular bone and original tibia shaft. Structural strength and stiffness by three-point bending assay Following µCT evaluation, fractured tibias were subjected to biomechanical testing to determine callus structural strength and stiffness. After thawing in PBS, each hydrated tibia was positioned on the bottom two supports (span = 6 mm) such that callus was directly below the top loading point at the end of the actuator (Dynamight 8841, Instron, Canton, OH, USA). An initial preload of 0.5 N was applied to hold the bone in place with the anterior side facing forward. Loading at a rate of 3 mm/min, the data-acquisition software recorded the force from a 100-N load cell and deflection from the linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) at 20 Hz. Callus strength was the maximum force endured by the callus, and callus stiffness was the slope of the linear portion of the resulting force-versus-deflection curve. Histologic analyses Fractured tibias were decalcified in 20% EDTA (pH 7.2) for 1 week at room temperature. Samples then were dehydrated and embedded in paraffin, and 5-µm sagittal sections were cut. Sections were prepared for safranin O/fast green and TRAP staining using standard protocols. Undecalcified samples were processed and embedded in polymethyl methacrylate following standard procedures. Sagittal sections 7 µm thick were obtained through the fracture callus. Sections were stained by the von Kossa/van Gieson methods following standard protocols. Histomorphometric measurements were performed using the Bioquant Analysis System (Nashville, TN, USA). Primary osteoblasts extraction, adenovirus infection, and treatment with lovastatin Calvaria osteoblasts were extracted by multiple collagenase/trypsine digestion from 4-day-old  Nf1 flox/flox  pups and cultured in 10% FBS α-MEM. Cells were deprived of serum for 6 hours before infection with adenovirus Ad5-CMV-Cre or Ad5-CMV-eGFP (2500 viral particles per cell; Vector Development Lab, Houston, TX, USA) using 1.2% Gene Jammer transfection reagent (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA), as described by Fouletier-Dilling and colleagues.( 25 ) This strategy allows one to isolate, plate, and multiply cells that are genetically identical (because they are not yet recombined), thus obtaining a homogeneous pool of cells that can be infected with mock (GFP) or cre adenoviruses just prior to the experimental assay (in this case P-ERK measurement). Cells were treated immediately following adenovirus addition with 20 µM lovastatin or vehicle (PBS) for 12 hours before lysis. Immunoblotting Lysates from primary osteoblasts were prepared in RIPA buffer in the presence of protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane using standard protocols. Western blot analyses were performed using anti-total and anti-phospho Erk1/2 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA) antibodies, and reaction was detected by chemoluminescence. Gene expression assays Total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). cDNAs were synthesized following RNase I treatment using the high-capacity cDNA reverse-transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed using TaqMan gene expression assays. The primers for  Rankl  (Mm00441908_m1),  Opn  (Mm00436767_m1),  Tgfβ  (Mm03024053_m1),  Bmp2  (Mm01340178_m1), and the normalizer 18S rRNA were obtained from Applied Biosystems. Statistical analysis Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical significance was assessed by Student's  t  test. Values were considered statistically significant when  p  < .05. Animals and experimental procedures All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. WT and   mice were generated by crossing 2.3-kb  α1(I) collagen -cre  Nf1 flox/flox  mice and  Nf1 flox/flox  mice, as described previously.( 21 ) All fractures were generated in 2-month-old male mice using the three-point bending method described by Bonnarens and Einhorn.( 23 ) Fifteen mice were assigned per group, and 10 to 12 mice per group were analyzed after eliminating mice with improper fractures (see “Results”). Anesthesia of the animals was induced and maintained with 2% inhaled isoflurane in 100% oxygen. After adequate sedation, the surgical site was sterilized with 70% ethanol, and an incision was made below the right knee. A 27-gauge sterile needle was inserted through the patellar tendon to make an entry point in the tibial epiphysis. Then a 0.25-mm-diameter sterile stainless steel insect pin (Fine Science Tools, Foster City, CA, USA) was inserted into the tibia. Distal tibia fractures were produced using a force exerted by a 220-g weight dropped from a height of 195 mm. Proper fracture position and quality were confirmed via radiography obtained using a digital cabinet X-ray system (LX-60, Faxitron X-Ray, LLC, Wheeling, IL, USA). Mice were allowed to recover on a heated pad and then were placed in recovery cages. Then 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg of buprenorphine was administered subcutaneously once after the fracture generation and then every 12 hours as required. Lovastatin microparticles (10 mg/kg of mouse body weight) were locally injected adjacent to the fracture site once at the time of fracture. Fracture healing was monitored by weekly radiographs. At 21 and 28 days after fracture, animals were euthanized, and tibias were collected. Surrounding soft tissue and stainless steel pins were removed prior to further analyses. Samples were either frozen in PBS (for biomechanical studies), snap frozen in liquid N 2  (for molecular studies), or fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 24 hours and then stored in 70% alcohol at 4°C (for µCT and histomorphometric analyses).",Weixi Wang; Jeffry S Nyman; Heather E Moss; Gloria Gutierrez; Gregory R Mundy; Xiangli Yang; Florent Elefteriou,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,2010-07,10.1002/jbmr.42,minimal,True
PMID:31836666,Biochemical and structural analyses reveal that the tumor suppressor neurofibromin (NF1) forms a high-affinity dimer.,Neurofibromin is a tumor suppressor encoded by the ,"Experimental procedures Cloning of neurofibromin constructs DNA constructs were generated for the various fragments and full-length neurofibromin using Gateway recombinational cloning ( 28 ). Entry clones were produced by PCR amplification of portions of the NF1 gene from Addgene construct 70423, which contains a codon-optimized version of human NF1 isoform 2 ( NM_000267.3 ) to ensure stability of the plasmid in  E. coli . 5′ sequences included Gateway  att B1 sites followed by sequences for protease cleavage by tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease (ENLYFQ/G), whereas 3′ sequences contained stop codons and Gateway  att B2 sites. PCR amplicons were cloned into pDonr255 and fully sequence-verified. Gateway LR recombination was used to generate final expression clones in baculovirus Destination vectors pDest-635 (pFastBac1 with N-terminal His 6  tag) and pDest-636 (pFastBac1 with N-terminal His 6 -MBP tag) or  E. coli  Destination vector pDest-566 (N-terminal His6-MBP tag, Addgene catalog no. 11517). Final baculovirus expression clones were transformed into DH10Bac cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and bacmid clones were verified by PCR ( 29 ).  E. coli  expression clones were transformed into BL21(DE3) for expression. Plasmids for mammalian IP experiments were made by subcloning Entry clones into transient transfection Destination vectors (pCAN-FLAG-DEST, pCAN-HA-DEST, and pEF-DEST51) using Gateway LR recombination per the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmids for RAS–GTP ELISAs were generated by Multisite Gateway LR subcloning of domain and full-length neurofibromin Entry clones into vectors containing an elongation factor 1a (EF1a) promoter along with various N-terminal epitope tags (HA, V5, or FLAG). Protein production Proteins were expressed in  E. coli  as described previously ( 30 ). For insect cell expression, baculoviruses were generated by transfection of bacmid DNA into Sf9 cells, as described previously ( 31 ). Titered viruses were used at a multiplicity of infection of 3 to infect Tni-FNL cells ( 32 ) that were grown at 21 °C for 72 h prior to harvest. Frozen insect cell pellets containing expressed neurofibromin proteins were thawed and homogenized at room temperature in 100 ml of lysis buffer ( Table S2 ) per l of culture volume. Homogenized cell pellets were then lysed by passing through a Microfluidizer M-110EH (Microfluidics Corp.) twice at 7000 p.s.i. Lysate was clarified by ultracentrifugation at 104,600 ×  g  for 40 min at 4 °C. Clarified lysate was filtered through 0.4-μm Whatman PES syringe filters (GE Lifesciences). All proteins were purified on NGC TM  chromatography systems (Bio-Rad). Most proteins were purified as described for proteins with TEV-cleavable His 6 -MBP N-terminal tags ( 33 ) with modifications to buffers as noted in  Table S2 . Lysis buffers were the base buffers used for the initial IMAC step. Full-length neurofibromin was produced with a construct containing an N-terminal His 6  tag that was not removed during the purification. This protein was purified by the same method as described previously ( 33 ) but with only a single IMAC purification step followed by preparative size-exclusion chromatography on Superose-6 Increase (GE Healthcare) in a 16/60 column. For all final proteins, concentrations were determined by measuring sample absorbance at 280 nm (Nanodrop 2000C Spectrophotometer, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and using the extinction coefficient calculated from the amino acid sequence. Size-exclusion chromatography and SEC-MALS For analytical SEC, freshly purified or thawed protein was centrifuged at 9300 ×  g  for 10 min at room temperature in a benchtop centrifuge. Superose-6 Increase (GE Healthcare) or Superdex S-200 (GE Healthcare) in 10/300 GL columns were used on NGC TM  chromatography systems. Columns were equilibrated with final buffers ( Table S2 ); 0.5 ml of protein sample was loaded, and the column was run at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. For SEC-MALS, proteins were centrifuged at 9300 ×  g  for 10 min at room temperature. Superose-6 increase or Superdex S-200 in 10/300 GL columns were used on an Agilent 1200 LC system in-line with Wyatt Heleos (light scattering) and Wyatt Optilab T-Rex (refractive index) detectors to assess the molecular weight of the proteins. BSA (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as a standard. Astra software (Wyatt Technology, version 7.1.3) was used to collect and analyze the SEC-MALS data. Detailed information on buffers, injection rates, and flow rates can be found in  Table S3 . Differential scanning fluorimetry (thermal melting) analysis Melting curves of purified full-length, ABC, DEF, and ABC + DEF complexes were obtained in triplicate on a Bio-Rad C1000 Thermo Cycler, and data were analyzed by Bio-Rad CFX Manager software (version 3.1). Proteins were thawed and centrifuged at 9300 ×  g  for 10 min at room temperature in a benchtop centrifuge. A 50-μl reaction was prepared by mixing proteins at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml with 5 μl of 50× SYPRO Orange dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in the relevant final protein buffer ( Table S2 ). Samples were heated to 25 °C for 10 min and then melt curves were measured from 25 to 95 °C with an increment of 0.2 °C per 0.01 min. Sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out at 30,000 rpm at 20 °C on a Beckman Coulter ProteomeLab XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge and An50-Ti rotor following standard protocols ( 34 ). Samples of full-length neurofibromin at various concentrations (0.05–2.2 μ m ) in 20 m m  HEPES, pH 7.4, 300 m m  NaCl, and 1 m m  TCEP were loaded in 12-mm two-channel Epon centerpiece cells. Sedimentation velocity data were collected using the absorbance (280 or 230 nm depending on the concentration) and interference optical detection systems. Time-corrected ( 35 ) data were analyzed in SEDFIT 16.1 ( 36 ) in terms of a continuous  c ( s ) distribution of sedimenting species using an  s  range of 0–30 with a linear resolution of 300 and a maximum entropy regularization confidence interval of 0.68. The solution density and viscosity were measured experimentally at 20 °C on an Anton Paar DMA5000 density meter and Anton Paar AMVn viscometer, respectively. Protein partial specific volumes were calculated based on their composition in SEDNTERP ( 37 ). Samples of ABCD and CDEF domains were similarly studied at various loading concentrations at 40,000 rpm and 20 °C. ABCD was studied in 500 m m  NaCl, 20 m m  HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.3, and 5 m m  TCEP, whereas CDEF was studied in 300 m m  NaCl, 20 m m  HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.3, and 5 m m  TCEP. Similarly, samples of ABC and DEF were studied at 50,000 rpm at 20 °C in a solution buffer of 300 m m  NaCl, 20 m m  Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and 5 m m  TCEP. In all cases, data were analyzed in SEDFIT 16.1 as described above using a sedimentation coefficient resolution of 0.1 S and regularization confidence interval of 0.68. Equimolar mixtures of ABCD and EF domains, as well as ABC and DEF domains, were studied in 300 m m  NaCl, 20 m m  Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and 5 m m  TCEP at 50,000 rpm at 20 °C. Samples in the 1–5 μ m  concentration range were mixed from stock solutions of the individual domains just before the experiment, and data were analyzed as described above. Sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out to confirm the oligomeric state of full-length neurofibromin. Samples in 20 m m  HEPES, pH 7.4, 300 m m  NaCl, and 1 m m  TCEP were loaded at concentrations of 0.55, 1.1, and 2.2 μ m  in 12-mm six-channel Epon centerpiece cells (130 μl). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were conducted at 20 °C and at 3000, 5000, and 7000 rpm on a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge and An50-Ti rotor following standard protocols ( 34 ), with absorbance data collected at 280 nm. Data were analyzed globally in terms of a single noninteracting species in SEDPHAT 14.0 to obtain the molar mass. Negative stain transmission EM Freshly purified (full-length) or thawed (domains) proteins were centrifuged at 9300 ×  g  for 10 min at 4 °C and diluted to 0.01 mg/ml in 20 m m  Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 300 m m  NaCl, and 5 m m  TCEP. Diluted protein was adsorbed on freshly glow-discharged carbon-film grid (CF200-CU, Electron Microscopy Sciences), washed with dilution buffer, and stained with 0.75% w/v uranyl formate, pH 4.5, for 30 s. Images of full-length neurofibromin were collected at ×67,000 magnification with EPU software from Thermo Fisher Scientific on a Tecnai T12 electron microscope equipped with a Gatan Ultra Scan camera, with images recorded at a pixel size of 1.77 Å. Images of CDEF were collected at ×100,000 magnification with SerialEM on a Tecnai T20 electron microscope equipped with an Eagle CCD camera, with images recorded at a pixel size of 2.19 Å. Images of ABC, ABCD, and DEF domains were collected at ×40,000 magnification on a Hitachi 7650 electron microscope operating at 80 kV with an AMT digital camera (Advanced Microscopy Techniques). 2D classification and 3D reconstruction of neurofibromin proteins Negatively-stained neurofibromin particles were autopicked using EMAN2 e2boxer using a box size of 326 pixels ( 38 ). Reference-free 2D classification was carried out using the Iterative Stable Alignment and Clustering (ISAC) procedure implemented in a Sphire package ( 39 ). 41,951 particles were initially selected. Particles representing disordered NF1 2D class averages were separated, and the remaining particles were reclassified using ISAC. The final 294 class averages representing 30,588 particles were used for  ab initio  model reconstruction. This model was used as a reference for 3D refinement using meridian with C 2  symmetry in Sphire. The final resolution of the reconstructed model was ∼20 Å, as estimated by Fourier shell correlation (criterion of 0.5). All further analyses and visualizations were performed using Chimera ( 40 ). The 3D variability analysis was done on the final refined model in Sphire. The final model data were submitted to wwPDB under the accession code EMD-20667. Approximately 28,800 particles of the NF1-CDEF domain were auto-picked using EMAN e2boxer, and 2D classification was performed with ISAC procedure using the same approach as described above. Particles of complexes of NF1-ABC and NF1-DEF were analyzed in a similar fashion with initial 2D classification using Sphire. Full-length NF1 dimer data were low-pass filtered to 60 Å and used as a reference in Relion for refinement of the model. 384 particles of the complex were used for the final reconstruction. Small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering data collection and analysis SAXS experiments were performed on a Rigaku BioSAXS-2000 equipped with a Pilatus 100 K detector (Rigaku Americas, The Woodlands, TX). A fixed sample–to–detector distance, calibrated with a silver behenate standard, was used to collect scattering profiles of neurofibromin (0.5 and 1.0 mg/ml) at 20 °C. The data were reduced with the instrument software to obtain the scattering intensity,  I ( Q ),  versus  wave vector transfer,  Q  (= 4π sin(θ)/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle), and then buffer background was subtracted. SANS experiments were performed on the Bio-SANS (CG-3) beamline at the High Flux Isotope Reactor located at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Measurements were made using a 15.5-m sample–to–detector distance for the main 1 × 1-m detector and 6 Å wavelength neutrons ( 41 ). The wing detector bank was utilized to capture scattering at high angles. Neurofibromin samples in H 2 O buffer (1 mg/ml) were loaded into 1-mm pathlength circular-shaped quartz cuvettes (Hellma USA, Plainville, NY), and measurements were performed at 20 °C. Data reduction followed standard procedures using MantidPlot ( 42 ). The measured scattering intensity was corrected for the detector sensitivity and scattering contribution from the solvent and empty cells and were then placed on an absolute scale using a calibrated standard ( 43 ). The reduced SAXS and SANS data were analyzed using the ATSAS tools ( 44 ) PRIMUS and GNOM for Guinier and  P ( r ) analysis, respectively. Reported zero-angle scattering intensity,  I (0), and radius of gyration,  R , values were obtained from the  g P ( r ) analysis. The neurofibromin molecular mass was calculated from  I (0) and  R  of the SAXS data using the method of Ref.  g 45 . The neurofibromin mass was determined from  I (0) of the SANS data as shown in  Equation 1 ,
  where  (Eq. 1) M = I ( 0 ) N A / ( c ( Δ ρ ) 2 v ¯ 2 ) N A  = Avogadro's number;  c  = protein concentration (= 1 mg/ml); Δρ = scattering length density contrast between protein and buffer solution (= ρ prot  − ρ buf ); and  v̄  = protein partial specific volume (= 0.74 ml/g). Using the contrast module of MULCh ( 46 ), the NF1 sequence was used to calculate Δρ in H 2 O buffer (= 2.364 × 10 10  cm −2 ). The DAMMIF program within ATSAS was used to generate  ab initio  shape reconstruction models to fit the neurofibromin (0.5 mg/ml) SAXS data. A total of 20 models were generated and compared by the program. A theoretical SAXS curve was generated from the final negatively-stained EM model of neurofibromin holoprotein using the ATSAS tool EM2DAM. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting An NF1-null HEK293T cell line was generated using CRISPR to knock out both alleles of  NF1 . HEK293T and NF1-null 293T cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfections of plasmids into cells were performed using FuGENE 6 (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and the cells were harvested 24 h after transfection. Cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 20 m m  Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 m m  NaCl, 5 m m  MgCl 2 , 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Immunoprecipitation was performed using EZview Red Anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel (Sigma). Beads were incubated with the cell lysates for 2 h at 4 °C and washed three times with cold lysis buffer. Primary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) used for Western blotting were FLAG (rabbit, 14793), V5 (rabbit, 13202), and HA (rabbit, 3724). NIR secondary antibodies (LI-COR Biosciences) were used and images were obtained using a LI-COR Odyssey scanner. Measurement of GAP activity in cells using a RAS–GTP ELISA The NF1-null HEK293T cell line was transfected with a 3×FLAG-tagged KRAS4b plasmid along with a series of NF1 domain plasmids using FuGENE 6 (Promega) and grown in serum-free DMEM for 18 h. Cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 5 min and harvested per manufacturer's instructions for the RAS GTPase Chemi ELISA kit (Active Motif). Lysates were assayed by BCA protein assay prior to the ELISA. The Ras GTPase Chemi ELISA was performed as per the manufacturer's protocol with one exception: the second incubation (after samples and controls were added to the wells) was done at 4 °C instead of room temperature. For samples, 100 μg of cell lysate was added to each well, whereas control wells were filled with 50 μl of Lysis/Binding Buffer. The plate was read in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Envision plate reader and imaged in a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc within 15 min of adding chemiluminescent reagents. Western blots to verify protein expression levels were run on Tris acetate or Bolt gels (30 μg of cell lysate/lane) and probed with a series of antibodies: pEGFR (Cell Signaling 3777), vinculin (Cell Signaling 19301), HA-tag (Cell Signaling 2367), V5-tag (Cell Signaling 1320S), FLAG-tag (Sigma, F1804), KRAS (Sigma/Novus Biologicals WH0003845M1/H0003845M1), and Li-Cor Secondary Antibodies (IRDye® secondary antibodies 800CW and 680RD). Phosphate sensor GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis assay Assays for GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis were set up in 50 m m  Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 m m  NaCl, 1 m m  TCEP, and 1 m m  MgCl 2  with a final concentration of 2.5 μ m  phosphate sensor protein (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 20 μ m  GTP and kept on ice until the assay was started. NF1 proteins were diluted in the same buffer and added to the assay along with controls containing no NF1 proteins or added phosphate. A 96-well black flat-bottom plate (Corning catalog no. 3544) was used in the assay, with 100 μl total volume per well. Reactions were initiated by addition of 3 μ m  KRAS4b(1–169) protein, and readings were taken every 10 s in a BMG Fluostar Omega plate reader with an excitation wavelength of 430 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. Initial rates of activity were calculated from the linear portion of the data ( R 2  >0.95) and compared with the intrinsic hydrolysis rate in the absence of added NF1 proteins.",Mukul Sherekar; Sae-Won Han; Rodolfo Ghirlando; Simon Messing; Matthew Drew; Dana Rabara; Timothy Waybright; Puneet Juneja; Hugh O'Neill; Christopher B Stanley; Debsindhu Bhowmik; Arvind Ramanathan; Sriram Subramaniam; Dwight V Nissley; William Gillette; Frank McCormick; Dominic Esposito,The Journal of biological chemistry,2020-01-24,10.1074/jbc.RA119.010934,minimal,True
PMID:33078583,Cell autonomous requirement of neurofibromin (Nf1) for postnatal muscle hypertrophic growth and metabolic homeostasis.,"BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a multi-organ disease caused by mutations in neurofibromin 1 (NF1). Amongst other features, NF1 patients frequently show reduced muscle mass and strength, impairing patients' mobility and increasing the risk of fall. The role of Nf1 in muscle and the cause for the NF1-associated myopathy are mostly unknown. METHODS: To dissect the function of Nf1 in muscle, we created muscle-specific knockout mouse models for NF1, inactivating Nf1 in the prenatal myogenic lineage either under the Lbx1 promoter or under the Myf5 promoter. Mice were analysed during prenatal and postnatal myogenesis and muscle growth. RESULTS: Nf1 CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate a cell autonomous role for Nf1 in myogenic cells during postnatal muscle growth required for metabolic and proteostatic homeostasis. Furthermore, Nf1 deficiency in muscle drives cross-tissue communication and mobilization of lipid reserves.","Methods To dissect the function of  Nf1  in muscle, we created muscle‐specific knockout mouse models for NF1, inactivating  Nf1  in the prenatal myogenic lineage either under the Lbx1 promoter or under the Myf5 promoter.

  All animal procedures conducted within this study have been approved by the appropriate ethics committee and have therefore been performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. Animal studies were conducted in accordance with FELASA guidelines and were approved by the responsible authority (Landesamt für Gesundheit und Soziales Berlin, LAGeSo) under license numbers ZH120, G0346/13, and G0176/19. Timed matings were set up, and mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation at indicated days of pregnancy; foetuses were sacrificed by decapitation. 26 
 Tissue processing and histology Forelimbs and hindlimbs of mice were dissected, limbs from the right side of the body were embedded in paraffin, and limbs from the other side were snap‐frozen in liquid nitrogen, followed by RNA, gDNA, or protein isolation. Adipose tissue was taken for RNA isolation and paraffin embedding. Muscle tissue was embedded with tragacanth (Sigma‐Aldrich #G1128) on a cork plate into cold isopentane for 10 s; then samples were transferred on dry ice and stored at −80°C. Adipose tissue was embedded with paraffin after using PFA fixation and rounds of dehydration. Cryoembedded samples were sectioned using a microtome (Microm HM355S) with a thickness of 10 μm. For immunostaining, slides were fixed with methanol for 10 min at −20°C. Antigen retrieval was used for Pax7 staining with antigen retrieval solution (2 mM EDTA) for 10 min at 95°C water bath (Julabo). Slides were blocked with blocking buffer (5% BSA in PBX) for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were diluted with blocking buffer and incubated overnight at 4°C. To remove primary antibody, slides were washed four times 10 min each with PBX. Secondary antibody was applied in PBX for 1 h at room temperature followed by washing with PBX for four times. Slides were mounted with Fluoromount‐G (Southern Biotech, #0100‐01). Imaging was performed on a LSM700 confocal microscope (Zeiss) with ZEN imaging software (Zeiss). The primary antibodies and dilutions used were goat anti‐collagen IV (Millipore AB769; 1:500), mouse anti‐MyHC type 1 (DSHB BA‐D5; 1:500), mouse anti‐MyHC type 2A (DSHB SC‐71; 1:200), rabbit anti‐laminin (Sigma‐Aldrich L9393; 1:500), mouse anti‐Pax7 (DSHB Pax7; 1:10), mouse anti‐myosin heavy chain (Sigma‐Aldrich 05‐716; 1:1000), anti‐beta III tubulin antibody (Sigma‐Aldrich AB9354; 1:500), and anti‐perilipin A/B antibody (Sigma‐Aldrich p1873; 1:250). For all the immunostaining analysis, three to five animals were used for each genotype as indicated in the figure legends. Paraffin embedding of adipose tissue from control ( n  = 3) and Nf1 Myf5  ( n  = 3) animals were used for haematoxylin and eosin staining; slides were fixed with 4% PFA at room temperature for 10 min and then incubated with haematoxylin (Carl Roth 3816) for 1 min, followed by eosin (Sigma Aldrich #15086‐94‐9) staining for 30 s. Slides were dehydrated by incubation for 5 min each in 70% EtOH–80% EtOH–90% EtOH–100% EtOH–xylene (Carl Roth #CN80). Slides were mounted with Permount medium (Science Service E17986). Oil Red O staining was performed with control ( n  = 3) and Nf1 Myf5  ( n  = 3) muscle sections from different development stages; slides were rinsed with 60% isopropanol (Carl Roth 6752) for 10 min followed by incubation with Oil Red O (Sigma Aldrich O0625) staining solution (0.5 g Oil Red O in 100 mL isopropanol) for 15 min. Then slides were rinsed with 60% isopropanol for 10 min and washed with PBS before mounting and imaging. Quantitative RT–PCR Total RNA was isolated with RNeasy Micro Kit or RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized using 1 μg of mRNA with SuperScript™ III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen 18080044), Oligo(dT)20 Primer (Invitrogen 18418020), and RNaseOUT Recombinant Ribonuclease Inhibitor (ThermoFisher Scientific 10777019) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturers. In brief, 1:10 cDNA dilution was used for each reaction of quantitative RT–PCR analysis performed on an ABI Prism HT 7900 real‐time PCR detection system (Applied Biosystems) equipped with SDS software version 2.4 (ThermoFisher Scientific) using GoTaq qPCR Master Mix (Promega) or SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Life Technologies). Beta‐actin was used to normalize the expression of each gene. All primers used were purchased from Eurofins Scientific and are listed in the Supporting Information,  Table 
 
 . For all assays, samples from three to four animals per genotype were used in three technical replicates. S1 
 RNA sequencing analysis Total RNA was isolated from tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of two p21 Myf5 Cre ;Nf1 flox/+  and two p21 Myf5 Cre ;Nf1 flox/flox  animals using RNeasy Micro Kit or RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). After initial quality control using Agilent Bioanalyzer, sequencing libraries were prepared from 500 ng of total RNA per sample following Roche's ‘KAPA stranded mRNA Seq’ library preparation protocol for single indexed Illumina libraries: first, the polyA‐RNA fraction was enriched using oligo‐dT‐probed paramagnetic beads. Enriched RNA was heat fragmented and subjected to first‐strand synthesis using random priming. The second strand was synthesized incorporating dUTP instead of dTTP to preserve strand information. After A‐tailing Illumina sequencing compatible adapters were ligated. Following bead‐based clean‐up steps, the libraries were amplified using 11 cycles of PCR. Library quality and size was checked with qBit, Agilent Bioanalyzer, and qPCR. Sequencing was carried out on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 system in PE75bp mode yielding between 45 and 72 million fragments per sample. Mapping was performed using STAR 2.4.2a software with mouse genome (mm9). Read counts were generated with R Studio function Summarize Overlaps and normalized to RPKM based on the number of uniquely mapped reads. Differential expression analysis was performed with DESeq2 using default settings. Genes with an absolute fold change > 2 and adjusted  P ‐value < 0.01 were assessed to be significantly differentially expressed. A table of DESeq2 analysis can be found in the Supporting Information,  
 . Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed with the entire gene list using GSEA software 4.0.1 desktop (Broad Institute). KEGG and gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed using the Signature Database (MSigDB) and DAVID 6.8. RNA‐seq data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus database under the SuperSeries accession number  Data S1 
 GSE147605 . Immunoblotting For protein isolation, tissue homogenization was performed with a TissueLyser (Qiagen) with RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0; 150 mM NaCl; 1% NP‐40; 0.5% sodium deoxycholate; 0.1% SDS). Protein concentration was measured with the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher #23225). Protein concentration from all samples was adjusted to 1.5 or 3 μg/μL. Total protein (30 μg) was separated with SDS‐PAGE gels and transferred to PVDF membrane (GE Healthcare). Membranes were blocked with 5% BSA in TBST for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer and applied overnight at 4°C. Antibodies used were rabbit anti‐PPARG (Cell Signaling Technology 2443), rabbit anti‐phosphor (pThr172) AMPKa (Cell Signaling Technology 2535), rabbit anti‐AMPKα (Cell Signaling Technology 2532), mouse anti‐β‐actin (Cell Signaling Technology 58169), mouse anti‐β‐tubulin (Sigma‐Aldrich T8328), rabbit anti‐phosphor (s235/236) S6 (Cell Signaling Technology 4858), mouse anti‐MyHC type 1 (DSHB BA‐D5), mouse anti‐MyHC type 2B (DSHB BF‐F3), rabbit anti‐phosphor (Ser473) AKT (Cell Signaling, #9271; 1:1000), rabbit anti‐phospho (Ser1101) IRS‐1 (Cell Signaling, #2385; 1:1000), and rabbit anti‐phospho (Ser636/639) IRS‐1 (Cell Signaling, #2388; 1:1000). Secondary antibodies were applied for 1 h at room temperature. Antibodies used were IgG (HRP conjugated) anti‐rabbit (Thermo Fisher; 1:1000) and IgG (HRP conjugated) anti‐mouse (Thermo Fisher; 1:1000). Images were acquired using a Fusion FX spectra gel documentation system (Vilber) with FUSION FX software. Blots images were analysed with ImageJ grey value analysis tool. For quantification, samples from at least three animals per genotype were analysed in at least three technical replicates. Proteomics sample preparation Three biological replicates of Nf1 Myf5  and control (Nf1 flox/+ ;Myf5 Cre  and Nf1 +/+ ;Myf5 Cre ) TA muscles from p21 mice were used for proteome profiling. Proteomics sample preparation was performed according to a published protocol with minor modifications. 
  In brief, about 10 mg frozen tissue per sample were homogenized under denaturing conditions with a FastPrep (two times for 60 s, 4 m/s) in 1 mL of a buffer containing 6 M guanidinium chloride (GdmCl), 5 mM tris(2‐carboxyethyl)phosphine, 20 mM chloroacetamide, and 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.5. Lysates were boiled at 95°C for 15 min in a thermal shaker, followed by sonication for 15 min, and centrifuged at 15 000  27 
 g  for 5 min. The supernatant was transferred into new protein low binding tubes (Eppendorf, Germany). One hundred micrograms of protein per sample were diluted to 1 M GdmCl by adding 10% acetonitrile and 25 mM Tris, 8.5 pH, followed by a Lys‐C digestion (1:50) at 37°C for 2 h. This was followed by another dilution to 0.5 M GdmCl and a tryptic digestion (1:50) at 37°C overnight. Subsequently, peptides were desalted with C18 columns and reconstituted in 1% formic acid in water and further separated into five fractions by strong cation exchange chromatography (SCX, 3M Purification, Meriden, CT). Eluates were first dried in a SpeedVac, then dissolved in 20 μL 5% acetonitrile and 2% formic acid in water, briefly vortexed, and sonicated in a water bath for 30 s prior injection to nano‐LC–MS/MS. Five micrograms of each SCX fraction and a non‐fractioned sample were used for proteome profiling and analysed by MaxQuant (v1.5.3.30). LC–MS/MS instrument settings for shotgun proteome profiling with label‐free quantification and data analysis LC–MS/MS was carried out by nanoflow reverse phase liquid chromatography (Dionex Ultimate 3000, Thermo Scientific) coupled online to a Q‐Exactive HF Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific), as reported previously. 
  Briefly, the LC separation was performed using a PicoFrit analytical column (75 μm ID × 50 cm long, 15 μm Tip ID; New Objectives, Woburn, MA) in‐house packed with 3 μm C18 resin (Reprosil‐AQ Pur, Dr. Maisch, Ammerbuch, Germany). Peptides were eluted using a gradient from 3.8 to 38% solvent B in solvent A over 120 min at 266 nL/min flow rate. Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid, and solvent B was 79.9% acetonitrile, 20% H 28 
 2 O, and 0.1% formic acid. Nanoelectrospray was generated by applying 3.5 kV. A cycle of one full Fourier transformation scan mass spectrum (300–1750 m/z, resolution of 60 000 at m/z 200, automatic gain control target 1 × 10 6 ) was followed by 12 data‐dependent MS/MS scans (resolution of 30 000, automatic gain control target 5 × 10 5 ) with a normalized collision energy of 25 eV. In order to avoid repeated sequencing of the same peptides, a dynamic exclusion window of 30 s was used. In addition, only peptide charge states between two and eight were sequenced. Raw MS data were processed with MaxQuant software (v1.5.3.30) and searched against the mouse proteome database UniProtKB (UP000000589) with 54 416 entries, released in March 2016. Parameters of MaxQuant database searching were a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.01 for proteins and peptides, a minimum peptide length of seven amino acids, a first search mass tolerance for peptides of 20 ppm, and a main search tolerance of 4.5 ppm. A maximum of two missed cleavages was allowed for the tryptic digest. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as fixed modification, while N‐terminal acetylation and methionine oxidation were set as variable modifications. The label‐free quantification algorithm, implemented in MaxQuant, was used for data normalization. The MaxQuant processed output files can be found in the Supporting Information,  
 , showing peptide and protein identification, accession numbers, % sequence coverage of the protein,  Data S2 
 q ‐values, and label‐free quantification intensities. The mass spectrometry data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium ( http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org ) via the PRIDE partner repository 
  with the dataset identifier PXD017958. 29 
 Statistical analysis was performed by a two‐sample  t ‐test with Benjamini–Hochberg (FDR of 0.05) correction for multiple testing. Significantly regulated proteins between Nf1 Myf5  and controls were indicated in the Supporting Information,  
 , and were submitted to DAVID bioinformatics 6.8 for functional annotation analysis. For comprehensive proteome data analyses, GSEA (v2.2.3) Data S3 
 
  was applied in order to see if a priori defined sets of proteins show statistically significant, concordant differences between Nf1 30 
 Myf5  and controls. GSEA standard settings were used, except that the minimum size exclusion was set to 5 and KEGG v5.2 were used as gene set databases. The cut‐off for significantly regulated pathways was set to be ≤0.05  P ‐value and ≤0.05 FDR. High‐resolution respirometry Extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and soleus muscles from 5 weeks control ( n  = 7) and Nf1 Myf5  ( n  = 7) mice were used in this experiment. Briefly, gently dissected muscles were put into ice‐cold biopsy preservation medium (in mM: 2.77 CaK 2 EGTA, 7.23 K 2 EGTA, 20 imidazole, 20 taurine, 6.56 MgCl 2 , 5.77 ATP, 3.95 phosphocreatine, 0.5 dithiothreitol, 50 K‐MES, pH 7.1 at °C) followed by permeabilization with saponin (50 μg/mL) in biopsy preservation medium at 4°C for 30 min. Fibres were washed with mitochondrial respiration medium (MiR05, 110 mM sucrose, 60 mM K‐lactobionate, 0.5 mM EGTA, 3 mM MgCl 2 , 20 mM taurine, 10 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.1, and 0.1% fatty acid‐free BSA) at 4°C for 10 min. All samples were kept on ice before analysis. The basic principle of this method is to analyse the respiratory capacity at 37°C in a hyperoxygenated environment using a multiple substrate‐uncoupler‐inhibitor titration protocol. 
  The following concentrations were used: 2 mM malate + 5 mM pyruvate (LEAK respiration), 5 mM ADP (OXPHOS capacity), 10 μM cytochrome c (integrity of outer mt‐membrane), 10 mM glutamate (OXPHOS capacity), 10 mM succinate (OXPHOS capacity), 0.5 μM FCCP (ETS capacity, ETSCI&CII), 0.5 μM rotenone (ETS capacity, ETSCII), and 2.5 μM antimycin A (residual oxygen consumption, ROX) that were used with high‐resolution Oxygraph‐2k (OROBOROS Instruments). DatLab software (OROBOROS INSTRUMENTS) was used for data acquisition and analysis. All data were normalized to non‐mitochondrial residual oxygen consumption (after complex I and III inhibition by adding rotenone and antimycin A) and muscle fibre wet weight. Student's  31 
 t ‐test (unpaired, two‐tailed) was used to determine differences between genotypes for each respiratory state. Whole mount  in situ  hybridization Embryos at the stage E14.5 were dissected and fixed overnight in 4% PFA/PBS. Embryos were washed twice in PBST for 30 min on ice and dehydrated through 25%, 50%, and 75% methanol in PBST (DEPC‐H 2 O), twice in 100% methanol for 10 min, and were stored in methanol at −20°C. Embryos were rehydrated passing through 75%, 50%, and 25% methanol in PBST (DEPC‐H 2 O) and washed twice with 1× PBS (DEPC‐H 2 O) on ice. Afterwards, embryos were bleached with 6% hydrogen peroxide in PBST for 1 h on ice. After washing three times for 10 min in PBST, embryos were treated with proteinase K (20 μg/mL, Roche) at room temperature for 12 min. Embryos were washed with PBST, PBST/glycine, and RIPA buffer for 10 min each and fixed with 4% PFA/0.2% glutaraldehyde for 20 min followed by washing with PBST, PBST/hybridization buffer, and hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5× SSC pH 4.5, 1% SDS and 0.1% Tween‐20, 0.1 mg/mL tRNA, and 0.05 mg/mL heparin). Embryos were pre‐hybridized in hybridization solution at 65°C for 3 h, followed by incubation in hybridization buffer containing a digoxygenin‐labelled  MyoD  mRNA probe at 65°C overnight. Embryos were washed with hybridization buffer at 65°C for 30 min, followed by digestion with RNase A at 37°C for 30 min. Embryos were washed with formamide buffer (50% formamide, 2× SSC pH 4.5, 0.1% Tween‐20 in DEPC‐water) at 65°C for 30 min, followed by two washing steps with MABT for 15 min each. Embryos were incubated in blocking solution (2% foetal calf serum, 2 mg/mL bovine serum albumin dissolved in TBST) for 1 h and subsequently incubated with anti‐DIG‐Fab antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Roche, 11093274910) in blocking solution (1 in 5000) at 4°C overnight. Embryos were washed with PBST/tetramisol overnight. Embryos were equilibrated to ALP buffer for three times, 20 min each, and then transferred to BM purple AP substrate (Roche, 11442074001). For signal conservation, the embryos were washed three times with ALP buffer and then fixed in 4% PFA/PBS. Imaging was performed using a Zeiss Stereo Discovery V12 and the AxioVision 4.6 software (Zeiss). Measurement and quantification of MyoD +  stained area were performed on three embryos for each genotype with the Autmess function of AxioVision 4.6.",Xiaoyan Wei; Julia Franke; Mario Ost; Kristina Wardelmann; Stefan Börno; Bernd Timmermann; David Meierhofer; Andre Kleinridders; Susanne Klaus; Sigmar Stricker,"Journal of cachexia, sarcopenia and muscle",2020-12,10.1002/jcsm.12632,minimal,True
PMID:38201517,Synergistic Suppression of NF1 Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor Cell Growth in Culture and Orthotopic Xenografts by Combinational Treatment with Statin and Prodrug Farnesyltransferase Inhibitor PAMAM G4 Dendrimers.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a disorder in which RAS is constitutively activated due to the loss of the Ras-GTPase-activating activity of neurofibromin. RAS must be prenylated (i.e., farnesylated or geranylgeranylated) to traffic and function properly. Previous studies showed that the anti-growth properties of farnesyl monophosphate prodrug farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) on human NF1 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) cells are potentiated by co-treatment with lovastatin. Unfortunately, such prodrug FTIs have poor aqueous solubility. In this study, we synthesized a series of prodrug FTI polyamidoamine generation 4 (PAMAM G4) dendrimers that compete with farnesyl pyrophosphate for farnesyltransferase (Ftase) and assessed their effects on human NF1 MPNST S462TY cells. The prodrug 3-tert-butylfarnesyl monophosphate FTI-dendrimer (i.e., ","2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Chemicals Lovastatin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for cell culture experiments and stored at −80 °C. Ac-DEVD-AMC used in caspase assays was purchased from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA, USA). 2.2. Cell Culture The human NF1 MPNST cell line S462TY was the gift of N. Ratner (University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA). It was derived from a xenograft of S462 cells that grew in immune-deficient mice. The immortalized normal rat Schwann cell line iSC was provided by E. M. Shooter (Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA). The human non-small cell carcinoma cell line A549 was obtained from Cell Lines Resource, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, MI. All three cell lines were cultured in DMEM (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT, USA), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). For colony formation assays, single-cell suspensions of 700 S462TY cells, 300 iSC cells, or 1000 A549 cells were plated in 60 mm culture dishes ~18–24 h prior to treatment. The MPNST cell line ST88-14 was obtained from T. Glover (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Adherent cultures of ST88-14 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) with 5% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories). For colony formation and MTT assays, 1000 and 2000 cells, respectively, were plated ~18–24 h prior to use. The human normal breast epithelial MCF10A cell line was obtained from Cell Lines Resource, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, MI, and cultured as previously described [ 25 ]. For MTT assays, 2500 MCF10A cells were plated per well in 96-well plates. Single-cell preparations of hepatocytes were prepared from male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and plated at a density of 50,000 cells per well by Dr. Thomas Kocarek (Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA). Conditions for hepatocyte isolation and culturing have been described [ 26 ]. All cultures were maintained in a humidified incubator under 5% CO 2  at 37 °C. 2.3. DEVDase Activity Assay Lysates of S462TY cultures were prepared and used for analyses of DEVDase activity as described previously [ 23 ]. Changes in fluorescence over time were converted into pmoles of product based upon comparison to a standard curve made with 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin. DEVDase-specific activities are reported as nmoles of product per minute per milligram of protein. 2.4. Western Blot Analyses N-, K-, and H-RAS were detected with a 1:100 dilution of murine monoclonal pan-RAS antibody (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA, product #610002). N-RAS was detected with a 1:400 dilution of a rabbit polyclonal N-RAS antibody (Santa Cruz, CA, USA, product #sc-519). RAB5A was detected with a 1:250 dilution of a rabbit polyclonal RAB5A antibody (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, USA, product #sc-309). Non-prenylated RAP1A was detected with a 1:250 dilution of a goat polyclonal RAP1A antibody (Santa Cruz, product #1482). GAPDH was detected with a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal antibody to GAPDH (Cell Signaling, Boston, MA, USA, product #2118). β-actin was detected with a 1:25,000 dilution of murine monoclonal antibody to β-actin (Sigma, St. Louis, MI, USA, product #A5441). The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies used were goat anti-rabbit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA, product #1858415), donkey anti-rabbit (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA, product #NA934V), or sheep anti-mouse (GE Healthcare, product number #NA931V). Immune complexes were visualized with an ECL detection kit (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) and recorded on X-ray film. 2.5. Colony Formation Assays Suspensions of S462TY, iSC, ST88-14, and A549 cells (plating densities are defined in  Section 2.2 ) were plated in midafternoon. The following day, the plates were washed with PBS, refed, and treated in the late afternoon with control solvent, FTIs, and/or lovastatin. Thereafter, cultures were refed every 3 or 4 days until colonies were easily visible by eye. Colonies were eventually fixed with 95% ethanol, stained with crystal violet, and manually counted. All treatment groups in an experiment were processed on the same day. Colony assays employed 4 to 5 plates per treatment group. 2.6. MTT Assay A slightly modified version of the original procedure described by Mosmann was used for the MTT assay [ 27 ]. Assays were performed on 96-well tissue culture plates. Cultures were generally treated ~18–24 h after plating and analyzed ~48 h after treatment. Six to seven wells were used per treatment group. Cultures were incubated in the dark for 1–3 h with the MTT reagent. The resulting formazan product was solubilized with acidified isopropanol, and the plates were read at 530 and 670 nm. The difference of OD 530  minus OD 670  was used as an assessment of viability. 2.7. Murine Sciatic Nerve Xenograft Tumor Studies and MRI Analyses In all studies, lovastatin was first dissolved in ethanol, then treated with NaOH in order to convert it into its active form, and subsequently neutralized with HCL prior to injection into animals. Dry  IG 2  was dissolved in physiological saline and filtered through 0.45 μm sterile filters before use. Physiological saline was used to dilute both lovastatin and  IG 2  stocks. Initial range-finding studies employed female Balb/c mice (Taconic Laboratories). Following a two-week acclimation period, mice were injected twice a day (~12 h schedule) for 7 days by i.p. injection (0.2 mL of either physiological saline or lovastatin) and/or by i.v. tail vein injection (0.3 mL of physiological saline or  IG 2 ). Treatment groups are noted in the text and the legend of the figure in  Section 3.6 . Mice were weighed daily and euthanized within 6 to 8 h of their last treatment for tissue harvesting. Female NOD SCID (NOD.CB17- Prkdc /NCrCrl) mice from Charles River Laboratories were housed in barrier facilities designed for immune-compromised animals. After a multi-week acclimation period, 25 13-week-old mice were weighed, anesthetized with isoflurane, and the ears were notched or punched to identify individual animals. Thereafter, the left leg was shaved with hair clippers to remove fur and washed sequentially with betadine and 70% alcohol. A 3/4-inch incision was made down the length of the thigh, forceps were used to tease muscle away from the sciatic nerve, and the nerve was injected with 4 microliters of suspended S469TY cells (4 × 10 skid 4  cells total). Following injection, the incision was closed with surgical glue, and the mice were placed on a heating pad and allowed to recover. Injections of the 25 mice occurred on two successive days. On the 21st day post-injection (having set the second day of injection as day 0), 5 mice were processed for an MRI to estimate tumor growth. On the 26th day post-injection, all 25 mice underwent MRI analyses. Thereafter, the mice were randomized and divided into 4 groups, representing treatments with (1) physiological saline by i.p. and tail vein injection, (2) lovastatin by i.p. and saline by tail vein injection, (3)  IG 2  by tail vein injection and saline by i.p. injection, or (4) lovastatin by i.p. injection and  IG 2  by tail vein injection. Doses of lovastatin (10 mg/kg) and  IG 2  (10 μmole/kg) were administered in 0.2 and 0.3 mL of physiological saline, respectively. Mice were weighed daily and treated twice a day, approximately every 12 h, for 13 days. Treatments were terminated at the end of 13 days because of developing complications with the tail vein injections and vascular collapse. MRI analyses were performed during the treatment period and 6 days after the termination of treatment. MRI analyses of sciatic nerve tumors were performed by the Wayne State University MR Core Research Facility on a 7.0-Tesla, 30-cm bore superconducting magnet (ClinScan; Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) interfaced with a Siemens console (Syngo MR B15). A mouse body (transceiver) coil was used. Prior to image acquisition, anesthesia was induced by isoflurane, and the mice were kept under anesthesia throughout the acquisition time. Following a localization scan, a fat-saturation T2-weighted turbo spin echo sequence was performed for anatomical evaluation with the following parameters: Field of view, 32 mm × 32 mm; matrix size, 320 × 320; slice thickness, 0.5 mm; slice number, 20; in-plane resolution, 0.1 × 0.1 mm 2 ; repetition time, 3.53 s; echo time, 56 ms; turbo factor of 7; pixel bandwidth, 130 Hz/pixel; number of average, 4. The tumor was identified by the hyper-intensity area on the T2-weighted images. Internally developed MR software SPIN (Signal Processing in MR (Version SVN Revision 1895);  http://mrc.wayne.edu  (accessed on 15 December 2023)) was used for tumor volume measurement. 2.8. General Synthetic Methods All NMR spectra were recorded using a 300 MHz Bruker spectrometer (Billerica, MA, USA) equipped with a 5 mm multinuclear probe, unless otherwise specified.  1 H chemical shifts are reported in parts per million from tetramethylsilane unless otherwise specified.  31 P NMR spectra were obtained using broadband  1 H decoupling, and chemical shifts are reported in parts per million using 1% triphenylphosphine oxide/benzene- d 6  as the coaxial reference (triphenylphosphine oxide/benzene- d 6  has a chemical shift of +24.7 ppm relative to 85% phosphoric acid). Mass spectral analyses were obtained from the mass spectrometry laboratory at Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN. All anhydrous reactions were carried out under an atmosphere of argon. All organic solvents were distilled prior to use, unless otherwise specified. Flash chromatography using silica gel grade 60 (230–400 mesh) was carried out for all chromatographic separations. Thin layer chromatography was performed using Analtech glass plates precoated with silica gel (250 nm). Visualization of the plates was accomplished using UV and/or Hanessian’s Stain (5.0 g of Ce(SO 4 ) 2 , 25.0 g of (NH 4 ) 6 Mo 7 O 24 ·4H 2 O, 450 mL of H 2 O, and 50 mL of H 2 SO 4 ), followed by heating. Sephadex LH-20 (GE Healthcare) was used for size exclusion-based separations. The syntheses of farnesyl monophophate prodrugs FTI-1 and FTI-2 (labeled as  1  and  2 , respectively;  Figure 1 ) have been previously described [ 23 , 28 ].  Figure 1  also provides the structures of the 6 prodrug FTI PAMAM G4 dendrimers ( IG 1–6 ) examined in our study. The detailed syntheses and chemical characterizations of the prodrug FTIs and prodrug PAMAM G4 dendrimers analyzed in this study are provided in the Synthetic Procedures document in the  Supplementary Materials . This document also includes  Scheme S1 , which outlines the synthesis of the compounds in this study, plus an alternate procedure for the scaled-up synthesis of gram quantities of  IG 2 . 2.9. Analyses of Synergism and Statistical Significance Drug–drug interactions were analyzed with CompuSyn software Version 1.0 (Informer Technologies, Los Angeles, CA, USA; software is available at  https://www.compusyn.software.informer.com  (accessed on 27 September 2023)) using plots of combination index (CI) versus fraction affected (Fa). Effects on cell viability/proliferation as recorded by MTT assays were determined by first establishing concentration–response curves with 5 to 6 concentrations of lovastatin and  IG 2 , followed by analyses of effects with 3 to 5 concentrations of  IG 2  at a fixed concentration of lovastatin. In vivo S462TY sciatic nerve tumor xenograft data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics software version 29.0.1.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). The data were checked for homogeneity of variances using Levine’s test. The combination therapy was then compared to the control using a one-tailed welch  t -test. A  p  value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. 2.8. General Synthetic Methods All NMR spectra were recorded using a 300 MHz Bruker spectrometer (Billerica, MA, USA) equipped with a 5 mm multinuclear probe, unless otherwise specified.  1 H chemical shifts are reported in parts per million from tetramethylsilane unless otherwise specified.  31 P NMR spectra were obtained using broadband  1 H decoupling, and chemical shifts are reported in parts per million using 1% triphenylphosphine oxide/benzene- d 6  as the coaxial reference (triphenylphosphine oxide/benzene- d 6  has a chemical shift of +24.7 ppm relative to 85% phosphoric acid).

PMID:32781282,Nf1 heterozygous mice recapitulate the anthropometric and metabolic features of human neurofibromatosis type 1.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a heritable cancer predisposition syndrome resulting from mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene. Genotype-phenotype correlations for NF1 are rare due to the large number of NF1 mutations and role of modifier genes in manifestations of NF1; however, emerging reports suggest that persons with NF1 display a distinct anthropometric and metabolic phenotype featuring short stature, low body mass index, increased insulin sensitivity, and protection from diabetes. Nf1 heterozygous (Nf1+/-) mice accurately reflect the dominant inheritance of NF1 and are regularly employed as a model of NF1. Here, we sought to identify whether Nf1+/- mice recapitulate the anthropometric and metabolic features identified in persons with NF1. Littermate 16-20 week-old male wildtype (WT) and Nf1+/- C57B/6J mice underwent nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), indirect calorimetry, and glucose/insulin/pyruvate tolerance testing. In some experiments, tissues were harvested for NMR and histologic characterization. Nf1+/- mice are leaner with significantly reduced visceral and subcutaneous fat mass, which corresponds with an increased density of small adipocytes and reduced leptin levels. Additionally, Nf1+/- mice are highly reliant on carbohydrates as an energy substrate and display increased glucose clearance and insulin sensitivity, but normal response to pyruvate suggesting enhanced glucose utilization and preserved gluconeogenesis. Finally, WT and Nf1+/- mice subjected to high glucose diet were protected from diet-induced obesity and hyperglycemia. Our data suggest that Nf1+/- mice closely recapitulate the anthropometric and metabolic phenotype identified in persons with NF1, which will impact the interpretation of previous and future translational studies of NF1.","Materials and Methods Animals Experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Augusta University (Augusta, Ga).  Nf1 +/− mice were obtained from Tyler Jacks, Ph.D., (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA) and backcrossed 13 generations into the C57BL/6J strain( 9 ). Mice were genotyped by PCR as described( 17 ). WT and  Nf1 +/− mice (C57BL/6J) were crossed to generate experimental progeny. Littermate male mice, between 16 and 20 weeks of age, were used for experiments. In some experiments,  Nf1 +/− and WT mice (8 week old) were provided a 30% glucose solution in water and standard chow feed diet for 16 weeks. During the high-glucose diet, body weight, non-fasting blood glucose, and food/water intake were measured each week. At the time of sacrifice, animals were anesthetized with an admixture of 2% isoflurane and 98% oxygen, weighed, and tissue harvested for further analysis. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Littermate WT and  Nf1 +/− male mice were anesthetized using an admixture of 2% isoflurane and 98% oxygen. Total body fat and lean tissue were assessed using a Bruker minispec LF90 TD‐NMR analyzer, which was calibrated prior to each use( 18 ). Following total body composition, mice were sacrificed and whole liver and the left gastrocnemius were harvested. To determine percent fat and lean mass in liver and skeletal muscle, a weighed portion of the right lobe of the liver and intact gastrocnemius were assessed by NMR. Indirect Calorimetry Indirect calorimetry was assessed using the Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring System (CLAMS). Littermate male WT and  Nf1 +/−  mice (16 – 20 weeks old) were housed individually in oxymax cages (Columbus Instruments, Columbus OH) at 27°C for 5 days with a 12 hour light and 12 hour dark cycle( 19 ). Mice were allowed to acclimate to the cages for two days prior to data collection. Food and water intake were measured each day and locomotor activity was measured for 24 hours using triple axis detection, beams set up in the x, y and z-axis as described( 19 ). X and Y breaks are considered locomotor and Z-axis breaks indicate raising up on hind legs. Oxygen consumption (VO 2 ; ml/kg × h) and carbon dioxide production (VCO 2 ; ml/kg × h) were measured each 24 hours. The respiratory exchange ratio (RER) was calculated by volume of CO 2  produced by the volume of O 2  consumed as described( 20 ). Glucose, Insulin and Pyruvate Tolerance For glucose tolerance testing (GTT), WT and  Nf1 +/− mice were fasted for 24 hours in a quiet room with free access to water. Prior to blood sampling, tails were cleaned and provided topical lidocaine (1%). Fasting blood glucose concentrations were measured prior to providing animals with a single intraperitoneal (IP) injection of dextrose (2gm/kg body weight, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Serial blood glucose measurements were made every 10 minutes for 120 minutes using a glucometer (AlphaTrak 2, Zoetis, Parsippany, NJ). For insulin tolerance testing (ITT), WT and  Nf1 +/− were fasted for 5 hours in a quiet room with free access to water and tails were prepped in a similar fashion to GTT. Animals received insulin (0.4U or 0.6U/kg, Novo Nordisk Bagsværd, Denmark) via IP injection and serial blood glucose measurements were performed at 10-minute intervals for 90 minutes. A pyruvate tolerance test (PTT) was performed after overnight fast. Animals were provided an IP injection of pyruvate (2gm/kg body weight, Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO) and serial blood glucose measurements were performed at 10-minute intervals for 90 minutes. Lipoprotein, Cholesterol, and Hormone Analysis Blood was collected from each animal at the time of tissue harvest. For Hemoglobin A1c measurements, blood samples were immediately measured using the A1C Now Diabetes Management HbA1C test kit (PTS Diagnostic, Indianapolis, IN). For lipoprotein, triglyceride, and cholesterol measurements, fresh serum was assayed using LDX Cholestech cartridges (Abbott, Chicago, IL) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For hormone measurements, samples were allowed to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes, centrifuged at 2500 RPM for 10 minutes, and stored at −80°C until analysis using a Pro-diabetes multiplex assay from Bio-Rad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Tissue Histology/ Analysis At sacrifice, gastrocnemius, liver, interscapular fat, inguinal fat, and epidydimal fat pads were drop fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24hrs and then dehydrated in 70% ethanol. Tissues were paraffin embedded, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Separately, samples of liver and gastrocnemius were drop fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and then incubated in 30% sucrose and stained for Oil Red-O. Image Pro Plus was used to quantify the area of lipid accumulation (Oil Red-O stained) in each section from the liver and skeletal muscle. Statistical Analysis Indirect calorimetry and Oil Red-O area analysis were assessed using 1-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc test for multiple comparisons. GTT, ITT, blood measurements and body composition were analyzed using Student’s  t- test. An F-test was performed to identify sample variation and Welch’s test was performed for unequal variance or sample number. Analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 6.0h (La Jolla, CA, USA).  p -value < 0.05 was considered significant. Indirect calorimetry, GTT, ITT, blood measurements, and body composition data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Oil Red-O quantification is presented as mean ± standard error of mean (SEM).",Rebekah Tritz; Tyler Benson; Valerie Harris; Farlyn Z Hudson; James Mintz; Hanfang Zhang; Simone Kennard; Weiqin Chen; David W Stepp; Gabor Csanyi; Eric J Belin de Chantemèle; Neal L Weintraub; Brian K Stansfield,Translational research : the journal of laboratory and clinical medicine,2021-02,10.1016/j.trsl.2020.08.001,minimal,True
PMID:1587809,Expression of the GTPase activating domain of the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene in Escherichia coli and role of the conserved lysine residue.,"A small catalytic domain from the neurofibromatosis type 1 gene, NF1-333, consisting of 333 amino acids between residues 1197 and 1528, including an additional N-terminal methionine, was expressed in Escherichia coli as a soluble protein. Its catalytic activity under non-saturating conditions is similar to the full-length p120-GAP but different from truncated GAP-334. Under saturating conditions its kcat and KM are lower. Lys-1422, which is totally conserved in all GAP proteins, was mutated and the properties of the mutant protein investigated. Lys-1422 seems to be essential for the stability of the proteins and not for its catalytic activity.",,L Wiesmüller; A Wittinghofer,The Journal of biological chemistry,1992-05-25,,abstract_only,False
PMID:41545416,Asthma-mediated control of optic glioma growth via T cell-microglia interactions: A mathematical model.,"Optic glioma, a slow-growing tumor, is associated with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) mutations and increased midkine (MDK) production. A connection between asthma and optic glioma has previously been observed, but the mechanisms are unclear. To elucidate the role of asthma in the regulation of glioma formation, we investigated the role of T cells and the subsequent pathways in the regulation of microglia, a key player in the glioma tumor microenvironment (TME). While asthma is often linked to chronic inflammation, our mathematical analysis and experimental evidence suggest that inflammation can play a key role in suppressing the proliferation of optic glioma cells via immune reprogramming of T cells and the delicate control of signaling networks in microglia. Our mathematical model unveils the complex interactions between tumor and immune cells in optic glioma. Our results indicate that asthma-induced T cell reprogramming inhibits tumor growth by promoting the release of decorin and a subsequent suppression of CCR8 and the intercellular binding kinetics in microglia, followed by blocking of CCL5 production in TME via suppression of NFκB. We developed anti-cancer strategies by leveraging this asthma-induced immune regulation.","Methods In this section, we develop a mathematical model based on asthma-controlled immune–glioma interactions (Fig.  1 ; optic nerve, T cells, microglia, and optic glioma cells). Receptor binding kinetics CCL4 ([ L 4 ]) binds to its receptors, CCR5 ([ R 1 ])  and CCR8 ([ 14 – 17 R 2 ]) , on microglia, forming complexes ( 18 – 20 ) that induce up-regulation of NF \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Therefore, the basal production rate ( 9 , 21 λ 4 ) and natural decay rate ( μ 4 ) determine the basal level of CCL4 in the absence of production from MDK-mediated T cells. This provides a background concentration that allows NF κ B activation dynamics to be sustained in the model. In our modeling framework, the CCL4 is produced from T cells in the presence of MDK activation in a nonlinear manner . While we take the same form of the Hill functions for switches for secretion of CCL4 from T cells, we take the multiplicative form of the Hill functions for both [MDK] and T cells to take into account the activation of the [MDK] action on CCL4 secretion only in the presence of T cells 9 – 11 . Thus, the net production  21 P CCL4  consists of three components, basal production, T cell-mediated production and natural decay, as follows: where  26 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

T cell phenotype change is a fundamental process where T cells undergo molecular changes on surface proteins and functions in response to external stimuli, leading to different cell types like naive effector, or memory T cells . T cells are reprogrammed under an asthma-mediated environment (e.g., decorin), transiting to activated T cells, but removal of the original source (asthma) levels back to glioma-promoting phenotype 129 – 131 . Therefore, we consider two distinct T cell types: one that induces CCL4 production in response to midkine stimulation 26 , 132 , and another that is reprogrammed by asthma-associated signaling to secrete decorin 9 , 21 . 21 Two types of T cells are considered in this framework: (i) regular T cells ( T ) and (ii) reprogrammed T cells induced by asthma ( T a ). The evolution of the densities of both types of T cells follows governing equations similar to those for microglia, but with the following assumptions: (i) The naive T cells maintain their circulating population of carrying capacity  T 0  by following the logistic growth at an intrinsic rate  r T ; (ii) The naive T cells transform into the active re-programmed T cells at the rate  λ T  in response to asthma ( I asthma  = 1); (iii) The active re-programmed T cells transform into the regular T cells at the rate  λ T1  in the absence of asthma ( I asthma  = 0); (iv) The re-programmed T cells disappear from the system at the decay rate  μ a ; (v) External re-programmed T cells can be injected at  u T ( t ) for therapeutic purposes. Thus, two transition parameters  λ T ,  λ T1  control the phenotypic transition between regular T cells and re-programmed T cells in response to asthma symptoms. This leads to following evolution equations: 29 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

PMID:25851896,Preclinical assessment of the anticancer drug response of plexiform neurofibroma tissue using primary cultures.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Individualized drug testing for tumors using a strategy analogous to antibiotic tests for infectious diseases would be highly desirable for personalized and individualized cancer care. METHODS: Primary cultures containing tumor and nontumor stromal cells were utilized in a novel strategy to test drug responses with respect to both efficacy and specificity. The strategy tested in this pilot study was implemented using four primary cultures derived from plexiform neurofibromas. Responses to two cytotoxic drugs (nilotinib and imatinib) were measured by following dose-dependent changes in the proportions of tumor and nontumor cells, determined by staining them with cell-type-specific antibodies. The viability of the cultured cells and the cytotoxic effect of the drugs were also measured using proliferation and cytotoxicity assays. RESULTS: The total number of cells decreased after the drug treatment, in accordance with the observed reduction in proliferation and increased cytotoxic effect upon incubation with the two anticancer drugs. The proportions of Schwann cells and fibroblasts changed dose-dependently, although the patterns of change varied between the tumor samples (from different sources) and between the two drugs. The highly variable in vitro drug responses probably reflect the large variations in the responses of tumors to therapies between individual patients in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results suggest that the concept of assessing in vitro drug responses using primary cultures is feasible, but demands the extensive further development of an application for preclinical drug selection and drug discovery.","Methods Primary cultures containing tumor and nontumor stromal cells were utilized in a novel strategy to test drug responses with respect to both efficacy and specificity. The strategy tested in this pilot study was implemented using four primary cultures derived from plexiform neurofibromas. Responses to two cytotoxic drugs (nilotinib and imatinib) were measured by following dose-dependent changes in the proportions of tumor and nontumor cells, determined by staining them with cell-type-specific antibodies. The viability of the cultured cells and the cytotoxic effect of the drugs were also measured using proliferation and cytotoxicity assays. METHODS Tumor tissues were obtained from four unrelated patients who underwent tumor-resection surgery (tumor nos. 1-4). All patients provided informed written consent for their tissues to be used in this study, which was approved by the Institutional Review Board (approval no. OB-061/05). All of the specimens were anonymized and cultured under conditions enhancing growth of Schwann cell. 16 Briefly, resected tumor tissues were incubated in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (Gibco, Paisleg, UK) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 500 U/mL penicillin and streptomycin (Gibco), 2 mM glutamine (Gibco), and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany), at 37℃ and 5% CO 2 . After 24 h, tissues were cut into 2-3 mm 3  fascicles and digested in the same medium with 0.5 mg/mL collagenase and dispase (Gibco, Tokyo, Japan) at 37℃ and 10% CO 2 . After 24 h, digested tissue fascicles were mechanically dissociated by straining through a 100 µm steel mesh screen (Partec, Münster, Germany). The resulting single cell suspension was used to establish primary Schwann cell and fibroblast cultures under conditions optimized for Schwann cell and standard condition, respectively as previously described. 14 After three to five passages of expansion, cells from each culture were seeded into eight-compartment chamber slides at a density of 10,000 cells/well and treated with nilotinib (0, 5, 10, and 20 µM) or imatinib (0, 10, 20, and 40 µM) over a 5-day period. After the treatment, the slides were double immunostained with antibodies against S100 (specific to Schwann cells) and CD90 (specific to fibroblasts). For Schwann cell staining, cells were incubated with 2 µg/mL rabbit anti-human S100 antibody (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark), 10 µg/mL secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (DAKO). To stain fibroblasts, cells were incubated with 2 µg/mL anti-human CD90 antibody (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany), 2 µg/mL secondary FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (DAKO). The nuclei were counterstained using 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. 14  For each drug concentration, S100-positive and CD90-positive cells were counted on a photograph taken under fluorescence microscopy. More than 200 cells were counted for each drug concentration using ImageJ software (version 1.48; National Institutes of Health, Behesda, MD, USA). The percentages of Schwann cells and fibroblasts were calculated. Cells negative for both S100 and CD90 were not included in the calculation. The viability and drug cytotoxicity for all of the cells in cultures treated as above were measured using 2,3-bis (2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-[(phenylamino) carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium hydroxide and lactate dehydrogenase assays (Roche, Penzberg, Germany), respectively. Cells of the same culture were seeded in wells of a 96-plate at 500 cells/well, and the 2 parameters at each drug concentration were measured in 6 replicates, by calculating the IC 50  and CC 50 , defined as the concentrations of a drug at 50% of maximum viability and cytotoxicity in a culture, respectively, using a Probit analysis.",Wei Jiang; Victor F Mautner; Reinhard E Friedrich; Lan Kluwe,"Journal of clinical neurology (Seoul, Korea)",2015-04,10.3988/jcn.2015.11.2.172,minimal,True
PMID:40769067,Serum miRNAs as biomarkers in Neurofibromatosis 1: New promising findings.,"OBJECTIVE: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a neurocutaneous genetic disorder caused by dominant mutations in the NF1 gene and characterized by increased susceptibility to develop benign and malignant tumors. The type of NF1 mutation, the expression of gene modifiers as well as epigenetic factors correlate with the clinical heterogeneity. In this regard microRNAs (miRNAs) play a role in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Compelling evidence shows that circulating miRNAs mirror pathophysiological conditions, thus emerging as potential biomarkers for human diseases. To date, the role of circulating miRNAs in NF1 has been poorly investigated. We aimed to study serum miRNA profiling as novel non-invasive diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for NF1 disease. METHODS: The profile of circulating miRNAs in a monocentric cohort of 126 NF1 patients was carried out by a pooling approach of small non-coding RNA sequencing and validation analysis by Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR. RESULTS: sncRNA-seq analysis of pooled serum samples identified 87 differentially expressed miRNAs in NF1 patients compared to healthy controls. qRT-PCR validation confirmed a distinctive circulating miRNA signature in NF1, with significant upregulation of miR-100-5p, miR-16-2-3p, miR-4508, and miR-885-5p and downregulation of miR-107 and miR-4433b-5p. Hierarchical clustering based on these six miRNAs effectively discriminated NF1 subjects from controls, and network analysis revealed their involvement in key cancer-related pathways, including ERK/MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and mTOR signaling. INTERPRETATION: Our study identified a distinct circulating miRNA signature of six miRNAs that reliably differentiates NF1 patients from non-affected individuals. These miRNAs are implicated in regulating NF1 downstream pathways and signaling processes involved in tumorigenesis.",,Filomena Napolitano; Gianmarco Abbadessa; Milena Dell'Aquila; Maria Ravo; Giovanna Maria Ventola; Giovanna Marchese; Giuseppina Miele; Giuseppina Franzese; Paolo De Blasiis; Nicole Piera Palomba; Teresa Esposito; Gianfranco Puoti; Simone Sampaolo; Simona Paladino; Mariarosa Anna Beatrice Melone,Journal of the neurological sciences,2025-09-15,10.1016/j.jns.2025.123643,abstract_only,False
PMID:28529006,Validation of a Next-Generation Sequencing Pipeline for the Molecular Diagnosis of Multiple Inherited Cancer Predisposing Syndromes.,"Despite the growing knowledge of the genetic background behind the cancers that occur in a context of hereditary predisposition, personal or family cancer history may not be clear enough to support directional gene testing. Defined targeted next-generation sequencing gene panels allow identification of the causative disease mutations of multigene syndromes and differential diagnosis for syndromes with phenotypically overlapping characteristics. Herein, we established a next-generation sequencing analysis pipeline for the molecular diagnosis of multiple inherited cancer predisposing syndromes using the commercially available target sequencing panel TruSight Cancer. To establish the analysis pipeline, we included 22 control samples with deleterious mutations covering all genes currently analyzed at our institution by standard Sanger sequencing. We tested the pipeline using 51 samples from patients with a clinical diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), 10 of which without previous molecular characterization of the causative NF1 mutations. We propose a thoroughly validated analysis pipeline that combines Isaac Enrichment, Burrows-Wheeler Aligner Enrichment, and NextGENe for the alignment and variant calling, and GeneticistAssistant for variant annotation and prioritization. This pipeline allowed the identification of disease-causing mutations in all 73 patients, including a large duplication of 37 bp in NF1. We show that high sensitivity and specificity can be achieved by using multiple bioinformatic tools for alignment and variant calling and careful variant filtering, having in mind the clinical question.",,Paula Paulo; Pedro Pinto; Ana Peixoto; Catarina Santos; Carla Pinto; Patrícia Rocha; Isabel Veiga; Gabriela Soares; Catarina Machado; Fabiana Ramos; Manuel R Teixeira,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,2017-07,10.1016/j.jmoldx.2017.05.001,abstract_only,False
PMID:6523094,An evaluation of reports of dioxin exposure and soft tissue sarcoma pathology among chemical workers in the United States.,"A review of employment records and tissue specimens of seven workers, reported previously as having occupational dioxin exposure and soft tissue sarcomas, confirms that four workers had employment of 2 to 19 years in the production of 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) or trichlorophenol, products contaminated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin, the most toxic dioxin isomer.

PMID:39110684,Electrical stimulation of Schwann cells on electrospun hyaluronic acid carbon nanotube fibers.,"Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a complex genetic disorder characterized by the development of benign neurofibromas, which can cause significant morbidity in affected individuals. While the molecular mechanisms underlying NF1 pathogenesis have been extensively studied, the development of effective therapeutic strategies remains a challenge. This paper presents the development and validation of a novel biomaterial testing model to enhance our understanding of NF1 pathophysiology, disease mechanisms and evaluate potential therapeutic interventions. Our long-term goal is to develop an invitro model of NF1 to evaluate drug targets. We have developed an in vitro system to test the cellular behavior of NF1 patient derived cells on electroconductive aligned nanofibrous biomaterials with electrical stimulatory cues. We hypothesized that cells cultured on electroconductive biomaterial will undergo morphological changes and variations in cell proliferation that could be further enhanced with the combination of exogenous electrical stimulation (ES). In this study, we developed electrospun Hyaluronic Acid-Carbon Nanotube (HA-CNT) nanofiber scaffolds to mimic the axon's topographical and bioelectrical cues that influence neurofibroma growth and development. The cellular behavior was qualitatively and quantitively analyzed through immunofluorescent stains, Alamar blue assays and ELISA assays. Schwann cells from NF1 patients appear to have lost their ability to respond to electrical stimulation in the development and regeneration range, which was seen through changes in morphology, proliferation and NGF release. Without stimulation, the conductive material enhances NF1 SC behavior. Wild-type SC respond to electrical stimulation with increased cell proliferation and NGF release. Using this system, we can better understand the interaction between axons and SC that lead to tumor formation, homeostasis and regeneration.","Methods HA hydrogels Hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogels were made using previously described methods using 3% methacrylated HA and 0.05% I2959 photoinitiator [ 25 ]. Briefly, hydrogels were prepared by mixing 3% methacrylated HA (~30% methacrylated, tested with NMR, S1 Fig in  S1 File ), 1x PBS and 0.05% irgacure and UV crosslinked for 30 minutes. Electrospinning HA and HA-CNT aligned nanofibers Nanofibers were prepared from the methods adopted from Steel et. al. [ 17 ]. Briefly, the fiber spin solution contains 2% methacrylated hyaluronic acid (HA), 2% polyethylene oxide (PEO, 900kDa), 0.05% I2959 photo-initiator dissolved in deionized water for controls (HA) and 0.01% multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) mixed in saline (HA-CNT). Aligned HA and 0.01% HA-CNT fibers were prepared by electrospinning on a rotating mandrel with a dispense rate (flowrate) of 1.7mL/h and a voltage of 17kV from a blunt 18 gauge needle, 11 cm from a rotating mandrel. All experiments used aligned fibers of HA and HA-CNT spun on methacrylated coverslips (round and square). All fiber samples were UV crosslinked for 30 minutes prior to hydration for experiments. Nanofiber characterization Fibers were characterized using SEM imaging. The samples were placed on a sample holder (6 sample holder) and gold sputtered for 30 seconds. Gold coated samples were loaded into the SEM chamber and vacuum purged. The chamber pressure was below 10 −4 
 Torr  with extraction voltage set to 6 kV. The distance between the sample and bottom of the lens was maintained at 8 mm (Z axis) plus offset (manually performed for each sample). All adjustments for imaging (fine tuning) were made during slow focus to obtain clear images. Images were captured at 10k and 15k magnifications. Fiber diameter and angle were measured using ImageJ (v1.53a) with at least 200 fibers per fiber type. Fiber diameter was measured manually. The angle tool was used to measure the orientation of the fibers. The bottom border was used as the reference 0° plane and all fibers projecting from this reference plane was measured. We calculated the percent of aligned fibers by dividing the among of fibers that deviated less than 20° from the neutral axis [ 26 ]. Schwann cell culture Immortalized NF1 patient derived Schwann cell (NF SC, NF-/-) line, ipNF 95.11b and Wild type Schwann cell (WT SC, NF+/+) line, ipn 02.8 were utilized for all experiments [ 4 ]. The cells were extracted from human patients diagnosed with Plexiform Neurofibroma in peripheral nerves. WT cells are non-tumor nerves while NF cells extracted from tumor sites in peripheral nerve [ 27 ]. All cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco by Life Technologies) with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (Hyclone by Life Science) and sub-cultured using 0.05% Trypsin (Gibco by Life Technologies). Attachment of Schwann cells HA and HA-CNT fibers spun on (12 mm diameter) round coverslips were utilized for attachment experiments. The fibers were tested with and without a collagen coating (Corning by Life science/ Advanced BioMatrix). In this study, we used aligned nanofibers to mimic neurons in the neurofibroma. Our previous work investigated aligned and random fibers for various cell types [ 17 ,  26 ,  28 – 32 ]. The fibers were hydrated in 1x PBS for 48 hours before experiments. All four experimental fiber groups (HA and HA-CNT, with and without collagen) were seeded with 20,000 wild-type Schwann cells (WT SC) and NF SC per well and incubated overnight at 5% CO 2  and 37°C. The cell seeded coverslips were moved to fresh wells 24 hours later for attachment and cell morphology was analyzed through fluorescence staining. Immunofluorescence staining Samples were fixed using 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) and rinsed thrice with warm 1x PBS. The samples are permeabilized by 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1x PBS with FBS (wash buffer) and blocked in 10% goat serum for 1 hour. Schwann cells were incubated with antibody against s-100b (Sigma) as the primary overnight at 1:400 ratio, treated with anti-rabbit IgG as secondary (Alexa Fluro 594, Invitrogen) for 2 hours at 1:1000 ratio, and counterstained with DAPI (Fisher Scientific) for 5 minutes at 1:2500 ratio for nuclei staining. Wash buffer was used as the diluent for all staining components (dyes). The wells were washed thrice in between all staining steps with wash buffer and placed in 500 μl (attachment experiment) to 1000 μl (stimulation experiment) of 1x PBS protected from light until imaging. Stained samples were imaged using inverted Nikon microscope [Eclipse T i -E T i -E/B] with LED light source. Texas Red [s100b] and DAPI [cell nuclei] filters with 200-300ms exposure times were used for the imaging purposes. The images were analyzed using NIH ImageJ (version 1.53a) software. Aspect ratio, which is the longest length of the cell divided by the shortest length of the cell, and cellular spread area, which is the total area of the cell, were measured and statistically analyzed. Conditions were run in triplicate with at least 200 cells measured for each condition. Alamar blue assay Alamar blue assays were conducted at 24, 48 and 72 hours on unstimulated samples to quantify the cellular proliferation on HA, HA-CNT and hydrogels. We also ran Alamar blue cell proliferation assays on stimulated HA-CNT nanofibers 48hrs post electrical stimulation. Briefly, Alamar blue solution was prepared at 10% of the well volume using cell culture media. Each well was treated with 500 μl of Alamar blue solution at the timepoints as indicated in the experiment. The plates were incubated protected from light for 6–7 hours to detect sufficient color gradient. A standard curve was used to calculate cell densities on experimental wells. The samples were pipeetted from the treated plates in triplicates of 100 μl and transferred into a 96-well plate, and read using Thermo Scientific Multiskan GO at 570 and 600nm to obtain the absorption gradient. The data was analyzed in terms of percentage reduction corresponding to the two wave lengths using a standard curve.  Table 1  shows that percentage increase in cell number from 24 hours to 72 hours for all conditions. Percentage increase was calculated by the ratio of the change in cell density between 72 hours and 24 hours post seeding by the final cell density (72 hours). All samples were run in triplicate. 10.1371/journal.pone.0308207.t001 Table 1 Proliferation. Percentage increase in cell number from 24 hours to 72 hours for all conditions.

 Schwann cell stimulation Custom stimulation well plates were prepared using 12-well tissue culture plates as previously described [ 17 ] ( Fig 1 ). Briefly, custom electrical stimulation chambers were fabricated from 12- well cell culture plates by drilling a hole using a 6-mm bit on a Dremel drill press and sandwiching: glass coverslip, electrospun nanofibers, copper tape, Very High Bond tape (3M), and a custom cut well within a standard culture well ( Fig 1 ). Copper electrodes were not in contact with the culturing medium; they are only in contact with the nanofibers. A Function Generator connected to a breadboard with 2 binding posts, 7.25″ × 7.5″ (Jameco) was used as the power source. The applied biphasic stimulus (Voltage In) and the stimulus after it passed through the stimulation chamber (Voltage Out) were captured from Channel 1 and Channel 2 of an oscilloscope (Rigol) connected to a Raspberry Pi running a Python script to store the data in near real time through the USB port connection. The plates were UV sterilized before the hydration to prevent contamination. The inner well of the stimulation plate is approximately 32 mm 2 . The fibers were hydrated using 1x PBS, and coated with collagen (Rat-tail Col1, Advanced BioMatrix). Each well was treated with 50 μl of collagen in acetic acid and left under the laminar flow hood for the acetic acid to evaporate and leave an adsorbed layer of collagen. WT and NF SCs were prepared, and each well was seeded with a cell density of 2,000 cells in 50μl of media initially to incubate the plates for attachment. The incubated plates were treated with 1ml of warm media after 2 hours and left incubated overnight. Before stimulation the media was exchanged to remove any floating cells. 10.1371/journal.pone.0308207.g001 Fig 1 Schematic of the custom electrical stimulation setup. The stimulation wells are drilled within a 12-well plate. Two stimulation rows have 4-wells in series. The middle row of the 12-12ll plate is used the unstimulated control. The wells were stimulated at 20Hz biphasic square wave of 100 and 200mV/mm for 30mins. Unstimulated control group were also exposed to the same conditions during the stimulation of the experimental groups. The custom well plates were incubated for 48 hours, and the supernatants were collected at different three time points: immediately after stimulation (0 time point), 24 hours post stimulation and 48 hours post stimulation. Nerve growth factor (NGF) expression was measured through and ELISA assay. Controls were run with unstimulated wells that were maintained under the same experimental conditions. Alamar blue assay was run 48 hours after stimulation. Conditions were run in triplicated with four samples per trial (n = 12). Immunohistochemical staining was conducted at 48 hours post-stimulation. Conditions run in triplicate with n = 200 cells. NGF ELISA ELISA was used to calculate the concentration of NGF release by stimulated SC in the media as previously described [ 26 ]. The supernatants extracted at different time points (immediately after stimulation, 24 hours and 48 hours) post electrical stimulation were tested for NGF release and compared to a standard curve. Standard curves were prepared with known concentrations of NGF dissolved in DMEM. A linear regression was run on the standard curve and used to calculate concentration of NGF in the supernatant. Statistics Results were analyzed using ANOVA with Tukey’s posthoc tests for all experiments. Significance was set at p<0.01.",Judy Senanayake; Raymond R Mattingly; Harini G Sundararaghavan,PloS one,2024,10.1371/journal.pone.0308207,minimal,True
PMID:19016857,Polypyrimidine tract binding protein regulates alternative splicing of an aberrant pseudoexon in NF1.,"In disease-associated genes, understanding the functional significance of deep intronic nucleotide variants represents a difficult challenge. We previously reported that an NF1 intron 30 exonization event is triggered from a single correct nomenclature is 'c.293-279 A>G' mutation [Raponi M, Upadhyaya M & Baralle D (2006) Hum Mutat 27, 294-295]. In this paper, we investigate which characteristics play a role in regulating inclusion of the aberrant pseudoexon. Our investigation shows that pseudoexon inclusion levels are strongly downregulated by polypyrimidine tract binding protein and its homologue neuronal polypyrimidine tract binding protein. In particular, we provide evidence that the functional effect of polypyrimidine tract binding protein is proportional to its concentration, and map the cis-acting elements that are principally responsible for this negative regulation. These results highlight the importance of evaluating local sequence context for diagnostic purposes, and the utility of developing therapies to turn off activated pseudoexons.",,Michela Raponi; Emanuele Buratti; Miriam Llorian; Cristiana Stuani; Christopher W J Smith; Diana Baralle,The FEBS journal,2008-12,10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06734.x,abstract_only,False
PMID:33197677,Effects of a mind-body program on symptoms of depression and perceived stress among adults with neurofibromatosis type 2 who are deaf: A live-video randomized controlled trial.,"INTRODUCTION: Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a rare, progressive and incurable genetic disorder associated with progressive hearing loss and eventual deafness. As a group, patients with NF report high levels of stress and depressive symptoms. However, no studies have explored improvement in these symptoms after psychosocial interventions. We have previously shown that a mind-body program tailored to adults with NF2 who are deaf (the Relaxation Response and Resiliency Program for Deaf NF2, d3RP-NF2) improves quality of life and resiliency over and above a Health Enhancement program when both are delivered via live-video and assisted by Communication Access Realtime Translation (CART). Here we tested the effects of the programs on depression and perceived stress. METHODS: Forty-five patients with NF2 and significant hearing loss were randomized to the d3RP-NF2 or Health-Enhancement program and completed measures of depression (PHQ-9) and perceived stress (PSS-10) at baseline, post-intervention, and six-month follow-up. RESULTS: Patients randomized to the d3RP-NF2 program, but not to the control condition, experienced significant decreases on both measures from baseline to post-test, which were maintained at follow-up (within group tests). However, improvements following the d3RP-NF2 program was not significantly higher than those observed in the control group (between group tests). CONCLUSION: Results provide the first evidence of improvement in symptoms of depression and perceived stress among deaf patients living with NF2 who participate in a virtual mind-body program.",,Sarah Carter; Jonathan Greenberg; Christopher J Funes; Eric A Macklin; Ana-Maria Vranceanu,Complementary therapies in medicine,2021-01,10.1016/j.ctim.2020.102581,abstract_only,False
PMID:25325900,The use of next-generation sequencing in molecular diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1: a validation study.,"AIMS: We assessed the validity of a next-generation sequencing protocol using in-solution hybridization-based enrichment to identify NF1 mutations for the diagnosis of 86 patients with a prototypic genetic syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1. In addition, other causative genes for classic genetic syndromes were set as the target genes for coverage analysis. RESULTS: The protocol identified 30 nonsense, 19 frameshift, and 8 splice-site mutations, together with 10 nucleotide substitutions that were previously reported to be pathogenic. In the remaining 19 samples, 10 had single-exon or multiple-exon deletions detected by a multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification method and 3 had missense mutations that were not observed in the normal Japanese SNP database and were predicted to be pathogenic. Coverage analysis of the genes other than the NF1 gene included on the same diagnostic panel indicated that the mean coverage was 115-fold, a sufficient depth for mutation detection. CONCLUSIONS: The overall mutation detection rate using the currently reported method in 86 patients who met the clinical diagnostic criteria was 92.1% (70/76) when 10 patients with large deletions were excluded. The results validate the clinical utility of this next-generation sequencing-based method for the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1. Comparable detection rates can be expected for other genetic syndromes, based on the results of the coverage analysis.",,Ryo Maruoka; Toshiki Takenouchi; Chiharu Torii; Atsushi Shimizu; Kumiko Misu; Koichiro Higasa; Fumihiko Matsuda; Arihito Ota; Katsumi Tanito; Akira Kuramochi; Yoshimi Arima; Fujio Otsuka; Yuichi Yoshida; Keiji Moriyama; Michihito Niimura; Hideyuki Saya; Kenjiro Kosaki,Genetic testing and molecular biomarkers,2014-11,10.1089/gtmb.2014.0109,abstract_only,False
PMID:18670322,Vestibular schwannoma quantitative polymerase chain reaction expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors.,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Determine the role of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) expression in sporadic and neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2)-related vestibular schwannomas (VS). Growth and proliferation signaling in human VS tumorigenesis may play a key role in molecular therapeutic targeting. VS carry mutations of the NF2 gene encoding the tumor suppressor, merlin, which interacts with ErbB2 in Schwann cells, implicating ErbB receptors in VS tumorigenesis. ErbB receptor family members are overexpressed or constitutively activated in many human tumors, and are effective therapeutic targets in some human cancers. VS occur more frequently in women and are larger, more vascular, and demonstrate increased growth rates during pregnancy. ER and PR may play a role in ErbB pathway activation and VS progression. STUDY DESIGN: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for ER and PR messenger RNA was performed using greater auricular and vestibular nerve controls (n = 8), sporadic VS (n = 23), and NF2-related VS (n = 16) tissues. METHODS: The qRT-PCR data were normalized with standardization to a single constitutively expressed control gene, human cyclophylin. RESULTS: Reverse transcription of messenger RNA from control and tumor specimens followed by RT Q-PCR demonstrated differences in ER and PR gene expression between sporadic and NF2-related VS. CONCLUSIONS: ER and PR expression in VS might have implications for development of a VS-specific drug delivery system using antihormone and ErbB pathway small molecule inhibitors, due to crosstalk between these receptors. These signals may be critical for re-establishing ErbB-mediated cell density dependent growth inhibition.","Methods The qRT-PCR data were normalized with standardization to a single constitutively expressed control gene, human cyclophylin. PATIENTS AND METHODS To quantify endogenous expression levels of ER and PR in VS tumors, quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (Q-PCR) was used using cDNA previously isolated from VS tissue graciously provided by the House Ear Institute (IRB approval No. 97–157). Tumors or control nerve tissue obtained via this protocol are immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and transferred to the laboratory and stored at −70°C. The diagnosis was verified by conventional histopathologic examination of a part of the tumor. Subsequently, total RNA was extracted from VS and control nerve samples using the Trizol reagent (Gibco Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) per the manufacturer’s instructions. mRNA was selected by running total RNA over oligo-dT columns (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and mRNA (5  μ g per 50  μ L sample) was reverse transcribed using the Gene AMP kit (Perkin-Elmer; Waltham, MA) in a DNA Engine Peltier Thermal cycler (PTC-200; MJ Research, Watertown, MA) at 42°C for 1 minute, followed by 72°C for 2 hours, then held at 4°C until ready for use in Q-PCR. In each Q-PCR reaction, Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix (2× buffer containing polymerase; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was used in a 15  μ L reaction including 2  μ L of cDNA (reverse-transcribed mRNA [0.2  μ g]) and 20× solution of primers and fluorophor-labeled probe (Taqman Gene Expression Assays; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) for both the transcript encoding the receptor of interest (i.e., human ER alpha or human PR) and an internal control (human cyclophyllin, a mitochondrial structure protein) ( Table I ). All expression assays were designed to span exon boundaries, to eliminate the risk of contamination from DNA or unprocessed RNA. Analysis of 39 VS specimens was completed, including 23 sporadic and 16 NF2-related VS. As controls for normal Schwann cell expression levels of ER and PR, Q-PCR analysis was performed using three independent sciatic nerve (SN) and four independent greater auricular nerve (GAN) specimens. Additionally, four vestibular nerve samples obtained from Ménière’s patients undergoing vestibular nerve sectioning at the University of Iowa as a generous gift from Dr. Marlan Hansen were analyzed. An ABI Prism 7,000 Sequence Detection System was used for all reactions with the following cycling parameters: 50°C for 2 minutes, 95°C for 10 minutes, then 50 cycles of (95°C for 10 second, 60°C for 1 minute) for amplification and simultaneous detection. Reactions were all performed in duplicate, and an internal control of human cyclophyllin was amplified within the same sample well using a different fluorophor reporter for detection (VIC; Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). When the gene of interest was undetected, the reactions were repeated with 60 cycles. Results were analyzed using a Microsoft Excel program designed for Q-PCR quantitation based on internal control mRNA levels, to control for differences in mRNA integrity between samples. Additionally, this program calculates mRNA transcript levels as fold-induction of baseline tissue (SN and GAN, designated arbitrarily as “one-fold”) to provide comparative data. Statistical Analysis ER and PR expression levels were considered to be upregulated if they were at least 10-fold greater than controls. Clinical information and Q-PCR data were combined and analyzed statistically using the Fisher’s Exact test (for age, size of tumor in centimeter as measured in largest dimension, NF2 status, and expression data), the Mann-Whitney  U  test (for NF2 vs. sporadic data), and the Spearman R for correlations. A two-tailed  t  test was used to compare Q-PCR expression data means for NF2 and sporadic VS.",Andrew K Patel; Thomas H Alexander; Ali Andalibi; Allen F Ryan; Joni K Doherty,The Laryngoscope,2008-08,10.1097/MLG.0b013e318177e20b,minimal,True
PMID:39966622,The development of an artificial intelligence auto-segmentation tool for 3D volumetric analysis of vestibular schwannomas.,"Linear and volumetric analysis are the typical methods to measure tumor size. 3D volumetric analysis has risen in popularity; however, this is very time and labor intensive limiting its implementation in clinical practice. This study aims to show that an AI-led approach can shorten the length of time required to conduct 3D volumetric analysis of VS tumors and improve image processing accuracy. From Yale New Haven Hospital and public patient recruitment, 143 MRIs were included in the ground truth dataset. To create the tumor models for the ground truth dataset, an image processing software (Simpleware ScanIP, Synopsys) was used. The helper (DPP V1.0) was trained using proprietary AI- and ML-based algorithms and information. A proof-of-concept AI model achieved a mean DICE score of 0.76 (standard deviation 0.21). After the final testing stage, the model improved to a final mean DICE score of 0.88 (range 0.74-0.93, standard deviation 0.04). Our study has demonstrated an efficient, accurate AI for 3D volumetric analysis of vestibular schwannomas. The use of this AI will enable faster 3D volumetric analysis compared to manual segmentation. Additionally, the overlay function would allow visualization of growth patterns. The tool will be a method of assessing tumor growth and allow clinicians to make more informed decisions.","Methods Based on our initial trials with a dataset of 10 images, we determined that 150 MRI images were required for a ground truth data set to achieve the desired AI accuracy. This was determined using statistical power analysis based on previous research in DICE score modeling . 16 , 17 This study was approved by the IRB committee at Yale University under reference number 2000032810. All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations and patients gave informed consent prior to involvement in this study. Patient recruitment 77 patients were identified through the Yale New Haven Hospital medical database (Fig.  1 ). Of these, 24 patients were eligible for inclusion. The patient records of these patients produced 84 MRIs from which VS tumor models could successfully be made. To obtain a diverse set of data and to increase the numbers of patients, the researchers contacted patients through NF-SWN 2 specific Non-Governmental Organisation NF2 BioSolutions. An initial recruitment email was sent out to all members on the mailing list (n = 1000) with a return rate of 7.2% responding with interest. 13 patients were included in the final stage, providing 70 MRIs. Tumor models could be successfully made from 59 MRIs. Fig. 1 Flowchart outlining the patient recruitment process to collect MRI images for segmentation. Inclusion criteria for patients included: patients over the age of 18, patients with a formal diagnosis of NF2-SWN (with either uni- or bilateral vestibular schwannomas) and patients with available MRI scans with the ability to upload these to the server (if recruited from outside of the Yale database). Exclusion criteria included: patients under the age of 18, patients with an undocumented history of NF2-SWN, scans without contrast, scans with large voxel sizes or scan sequences that did not allow for visualization of the inner auditory canal (less than 150 images). Inclusion criteria did not include treatment status or presence of other tumors such as meningiomas, therefore the patient data represented both pre- and posttreatment scans as well as those with meningiomas. From Yale New Haven Hospital and public patient recruitment, 143 MRIs were included in the ground truth dataset. All images used for the POC were T1 weighted, post-contrast MRI scans.  Creation of proof-of-concept data set The quality of images was determined by the researchers and was categorized by voxel size. Scans were categorized into high (less than 0.5 × 0.5 × 1.0), medium (less than 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0) and low quality (greater than 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0). To create the tumor models an image processing software (Simpleware, Synopsys, Mountain View, CA) was used. For the proof-of-concept, 110 3D models were used; 66 high quality, 44 medium quality and 6 low quality scans. 3D tumor masks were created for vestibular schwannomas (unilateral or bilateral) as follows (Fig.  2 ): Fig. 2 A pathway describing the process used to manually segment the VS tumors from MRI images using the imaging processing software Simpleware ScanIP. To highlight the vestibular schwannomas, a thresholding algorithm was used on selected slices containing the tumor mass. A ‘split regions’ algorithm was used to isolate the tumors and remove the non-tumorous voxels. Consideration was taken with voxels lining the border of the mask. Missing and surplus voxels were adjusted to include or exclude as necessary using the paint function. After the initial mask creation, the tumors were re-examined in all three planes (coronal, axial, sagittal views) to correct for any missing or extra voxels. All the models were reviewed by a neuroradiologist, who made necessary adjustments. The ‘volume’ measurement tool was used to calculate the 3D volume (in mm 3 ) of each tumor mask. To visualize the shape, size, and pattern of growth of the masked tumors, a mask was created of the pons at the levels of the tumors. Our segmentation process utilized the Simpleware platform by Synopsys, which integrates proprietary AI-powered auto-segmentation tools. These tools leverage machine learning algorithms trained on large, domain-specific datasets to accurately and efficiently segment complex anatomical structures, including vestibular schwannoma (VS) tumors. To ensure reliability, we validated Simpleware’s output against ground truth annotations using metrics such as the DICE coefficient. Creation of prototype The proof-of-concept (POC) data set used by the engineers at Synopsys consisted of 25 high quality MRIs. The ground truth dataset of 143 MRIs was subdivided into train (80%), validation (10%) and test (10%) groups. The helper (DPP V1.0) was trained using proprietary AI- and ML-based algorithms and information. No tumors identified within the ground truth segmentation were missed by the helper. A final testing stage was completed using 30 new segmentations of MRI scans obtained from NF2 Biosolutions. This stage of training was used for validating the segmentations produced by the tool to verify its ability to identify and segment tumors in previously unseen patient data. Following this testing stage, an additional tool was added to the modeler which corrects the orientation of the images when imported into the software to accommodate different imaging protocols. To compare the accuracy of the AI generated 3D models to the radiologist validated manual segmentation models, a DICE score was calculated. The DICE score calculation was calculated using the equation: DICE Coefficient = 2 * the Area of Overlap / by the total number of pixels in both images. Development of visualization tool To compare the chronological growth of a patient’s tumors, each patient who had multiple scans had their segmented tumor masks imported into a single Simpleware file. An image registration algorithm was used to reformat and align the brain across the DICOM images and the generated 3D tumor models. Accessing the scripting interface in Simpleware, custom code was written to organize bilateral tumors in chronological order and sort them into left and right categories. Plots were generated with a script illustrating the change in size of each tumor over time. Plots indicating percentage change from baseline and volatility were also generated. A color scheme that illustrates chronological tumor growth was developed. The overlapping 3D models of each tumor were displayed in a single color. Models of tumors from earlier scans are displayed in lighter shades whereas models from later scans are displayed in darker shades as seen in Fig.  3 . Fig. 3 An example of a tumor visualization using the tool created showing tumor growth. Recent tumor growth is shown by the darker, shaded areas in the model. Finally, Volume measurements were obtained for ten masses using three approaches: manual segmentation, AI-based segmentation, and ellipsoid volume calculation.

PMID:33507822,NF106: A Neurofibromatosis Clinical Trials Consortium Phase II Trial of the MEK Inhibitor Mirdametinib (PD-0325901) in Adolescents and Adults With NF1-Related Plexiform Neurofibromas.,"PURPOSE: Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) frequently develop plexiform neurofibromas (PNs), which can cause significant morbidity. We performed a phase II trial of the MAPK/ERK kinase inhibitor, mirdametinib (PD-0325901), in patients with NF1 and inoperable PNs. The primary objective was response rate based on volumetric magnetic resonance imaging analysis. METHODS: Inclusion criteria included age ≥ 16 years and a PN that was either progressive or causing significant morbidity. First-dose pharmacokinetics were performed. Patients completed patient-reported outcome measures. Patients received mirdametinib by mouth twice a day at 2 mg/m RESULTS: Nineteen patients were enrolled, and all 19 received mirdametinib. The median age was 24 years (range, 16-39 years); the median baseline tumor volume was 363.8 mL (range, 3.9-5,161 mL). Eight of the 19 patients (42%) achieved a partial response of the target PN by course 12, and 10 (53%) had stable disease. One patient (5%) developed progressive disease at course 8. Significant and durable decreases were observed in pain ratings. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this analysis represents the first characterization of the activity and pharmacokinetics of mirdametinib in patients with NF1 and PNs and is the first published response study for MAPK/ERK kinase inhibitors in adults with NF1 and PNs. Mirdametinib given at 2 mg/m","METHODS Inclusion criteria included age ≥ 16 years and a PN that was either progressive or causing significant morbidity. First-dose pharmacokinetics were performed. Patients completed patient-reported outcome measures. Patients received mirdametinib by mouth twice a day at 2 mg/m 2 /dose (maximum dose = 4 mg twice a day) in a 3-week on/1-week off sequence. Each course was 4 weeks in duration. Evaluations were performed after four courses for the first year and then after every six courses. Patients could receive a maximum of 24 total courses. METHODS Study Design and Population Patients were enrolled at NF Clinical Trials Consortium sites. Inclusion criteria included age ≥ 16 years with NF1 and an unresectable PN either with significant progression in the past year (defined as ≥ 20% increase in the volume, ≥ 13% increase in the product of the two longest perpendicular diameters, or ≥ 6% increase in the longest diameter) or with PN-related significant morbidity (Table  1 ). PNs were at least 3 mL and amenable to volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis; central review was performed in real time. Exclusion criteria included prior therapy with a MEKi. Other eligibility and exclusion criteria are given in Appendix Table A 1  (online only). Patients who had received prior therapy required an adequate washout period. The primary objective was to evaluate the response rate to mirdametinib based on volumetric MRI analysis. TABLE 1. Baseline Demographics Therapy Patients received mirdametinib orally twice a day (BID) at 2 mg/m 2 /dose (maximum dose of 4 mg BID; capsules swallowed whole) in a 3-week on/1-week off sequence because of concerns of musculoskeletal, neurologic, and ocular toxicity seen at doses > 10 mg BID for adults with malignancy  and based on evidence of PN shrinkage even with low doses. 7 , 8  Patients could receive a maximum of 24 four-week courses. Patients were removed from therapy for mirdametinib-related dose limiting toxicity (DLT), progressive disease (PD), or lack of partial response (PR; defined as a ≥ 20% reduction in tumor volume compared with baseline) by the end of 12 courses. Patients without at least 15% reduction in target tumor volume by the end of course 8 were removed from protocol therapy for safety concerns, as it was believed that the likelihood of achieving a response by 12 courses was minimal. 6 DLTs (hematologic or nonhematologic) were defined as either ≥ grade 3 or clinically significant grade 2 toxicities that did not resolve within 72 hours of maximal medical management. Patients who experienced a DLT that was possibly, probably, or definitely related to mirdametinib held drug until the toxicity was completely resolved. If toxicity resolved within 2 weeks, mirdametinib was restarted at a lower dose (Appendix Table A 2 , online only). Toxicities requiring removal from protocol therapy included: any mirdametinib-related DLT that recurred on a reduced dose (ie, no patient could be dose-reduced more than once); any ≥ grade 3 mirdametinib–related toxicity that did not resolve to ≤ grade 1 within 2 weeks; development of retinal vein occlusion; and development of glaucoma, intraocular pressure > 21 mm Hg, or any significant abnormality on ophthalmic examination. Study Evaluations Patients underwent the following study evaluations at enrollment and after courses 4, 8, and 12, and then after courses 18 and 24 for those who continued therapy. Assessment of PN volume. Patients underwent noncontrast axial and coronal short-TI inversion recovery MRI at the designated time points. Response was evaluated centrally at the National Cancer Institute based on changes in tumor volume, as previously reported.  PD was defined as a ≥ 20% increase in volume compared with baseline and PR as ≥ 20% reduction in the volume of the target PN. 9 Safety monitoring. Safety monitoring included physical examination and laboratory studies (including blood counts, comprehensive metabolic panel, and creatine phosphokinase). Patients had an ophthalmology evaluation after courses 1 and 2, then every two courses for the first year, and every three courses in year 2. Adverse events (AEs) were graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0. Participants were considered evaluable for toxicity if they received at least one dose of study drug and were removed from treatment for toxicity or completed one full course of therapy. A priori, we stated that mirdametinib was worthy of further study in this population if ≥ 25% of participants achieved PR after 12 courses without clinically significant toxicity. Patient-reported outcome measures. Patients completed the following patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures at the above time points. The Numerical Rating Scale-11  is a self-report measure of pain intensity that was adapted to assess PN-related pain for NF1 clinical trials. 10  Patients were asked to choose their most important tumor pain and rate it from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain) in the past week. The same tumor pain was to be rated at each evaluation. 11 The Brief Pain Inventory Pain Interference subscale  assesses the impact of pain on daily functioning in seven areas from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interfered) in the past week; it yields a mean total score. 12 The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory NF1 module is a disease-specific health-related quality-of-life (QOL) measure  assessing 16 domains. Responses on a five-point Likert scale are transformed to a scale of 0-100 (higher scores = better QOL); it produces mean domain and total scores. 13 Pharmacokinetic analysis. Whole blood samples were collected before treatment and at 30 minutes and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10 hours after the first dose. Samples were assayed for mirdametinib and the active metabolite, PD-0315209 (only contributes about 3% to total MEK inhibition), by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection (Advion BioSciences, Inc, Ithaca, NY). A noncompartmental analysis was performed to estimate area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to 12 hours (AUC 0-12h ) after a single dose of mirdametinib using Phoenix WinNonlin (Version 8.1; Certara, Princeton, NJ). A population pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis was also performed using nonlinear mixed effect modeling with NONMEM (version 7.2; ICON, Ellicott City, MD) with Perl speaks NONMEM version 3.6.2 and Pirana version 2.7.1 (Certara). Mirdametinib concentration time data were modeled to generate individual PK estimates during steady-state treatment. The apparent clearance and actual dose treated at time point of response assessment were used to estimate total mirdametinib exposure expressed as AUC 0-12h  to evaluate the relationship of exposure with tumor shrinkage. Statistical Analysis This study used an optimal Simon 2-stage design, with a null hypothesis response rate of 0.05 and an alternative of 0.25, a power of 80%, and a type I error of 0.05. This called for a first-stage sample size of nine participants with expansion up to 19 participants (if at least one of the first nine had a PR) to achieve at least 17 participants evaluable for response. The pain and QOL data were summarized with descriptive statistics (means, standard deviation [SD]) via SAS version 9.4 (Cary, NC). Changes over time were evaluated using a mixed model approach via Least Squares Means in the total group (N = 19) and in patients achieving a PR (PR group; n = 8) compared with patients not achieving a PR (no-PR group; n = 11). We fit a final linear mixed model that included time and group as fixed effects (interaction of time and group was not significant and was removed). For random effects, we included only an intercept and assumed exchangeable correlation for the outcomes.",Brian D Weiss; Pamela L Wolters; Scott R Plotkin; Brigitte C Widemann; James H Tonsgard; Jaishri Blakeley; Jeffrey C Allen; Elizabeth Schorry; Bruce Korf; Nathan J Robison; Stewart Goldman; Alexander A Vinks; Chie Emoto; Tsuyoshi Fukuda; Coretta T Robinson; Gary Cutter; Lloyd Edwards; Eva Dombi; Nancy Ratner; Roger Packer; Michael J Fisher,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,2021-03-01,10.1200/JCO.20.02220,minimal,True
PMID:38811427,Quality of life in individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 associated cutaneous neurofibromas: validation of the Dutch cNF-Skindex.,"BACKGROUND: Almost all patients with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) develop cutaneous neurofibroma (cNF), benign dermal tumours that have a large impact on the patient's Quality of Life (QoL). The French cNF-Skindex is the first questionnaire to specifically assess cNF-related QoL in patients with NF1. We aimed to adapt and validate a Dutch version of the cNF-Skindex. METHODS: The questionnaire was translated using forward and backwards translation, and subsequently administered to a sample of 59 patients on two separate occasions. Feasibility was evaluated by the presence of floor/ceiling effects. Reliability was assessed by evaluating internal consistency and test-retest reliability, by calculating Cronbach's alpha and Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. The EQ-5D-5L and SF-36 were used to evaluate convergent validity, using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. An exploratory factor analysis was performed to study the data's internal structure. Multivariable linear regression was used to model the relationship between patient characteristics and the cNF-Skindex. RESULTS: The Dutch cNF-Skindex demonstrated excellent feasibility and reliability (Cronbach's alpha 0.96, test-retest correlation coefficient 0.88). Convergent validity was confirmed for the EQ-5D-5L and relevant SF-36 scales. All items and subdomains from the original questionnaire were confirmed following exploratory factor analysis. The patient characteristics included in the multivariable linear regression were not significantly associated with the cNF-Skindex score. CONCLUSIONS: The Dutch cNF-Skindex displayed excellent psychometric properties, enabling use in the Netherlands.","Methods The questionnaire was translated using forward and backwards translation, and subsequently administered to a sample of 59 patients on two separate occasions. Feasibility was evaluated by the presence of floor/ceiling effects. Reliability was assessed by evaluating internal consistency and test-retest reliability, by calculating Cronbach’s alpha and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients. The EQ-5D-5L and SF-36 were used to evaluate convergent validity, using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients. An exploratory factor analysis was performed to study the data’s internal structure. Multivariable linear regression was used to model the relationship between patient characteristics and the cNF-Skindex. Methods Translation Permission for translation was provided by the original author of the Skindex, Dr. M. Chren. An expert committee was formed, consisting of the principal investigator (PI) of this study, two forwards translators, and one backwards translator. The original French version of the cNF-Skindex was forward translated into the Dutch language by two translators, who were not aware of the content of the original questionnaire. Both translators had French as their native language and were fluent in Dutch. The study PI and forward translators subsequently compared the two translations, evaluating the translation from a clinical perspective and discussing any discrepancies until an agreement was reached. Next, the backward translation was performed by an individual bilingual translator with the Dutch nationality, who was fluent in French. The study PI compared the translation with the original version of the cNF-Skindex and discussed with the translators if any adaptations needed to be made to the Dutch version to retain consistency. This process resulted in the final version of the Dutch cNF-Skindex. It was decided to not perform cognitive debriefing of the Dutch version of the cNF-Skindex, since the Dutch cNF-Skindex was nearly identical to the Dutch version of the Skindex-16 [ 15 ], an already validated instrument in Dutch. To create the cNF-Skindex, only minor changes were made to the original Skindex-16. For each item, the words ‘your skin’ were replaced with ‘your cutaneous neurofibroma’. In addition, two items were added that are relevant to cNF: (1) the influence of cNF on how patients experience touch, warmth, and cold on their skin, and (2) if the cNF get stuck on the patient’s clothing or hairbrush. In addition, patients would not have been allowed to participate in both the cognitive debriefing and psychometric evaluation stage of the study. Given the small pool of possible participants, it would not have been feasible to recruit adequate patient numbers for both stages. Hence, the psychometric evaluation stage was prioritised over cognitive debriefing. Psychometric evaluation This study was performed at the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Erasmus Medical Center, local identifier MEC-2021-0598. All participants provided written consent to participate. Recruitment of participants Patients who met the revised diagnostic criteria for NF1 [ 16 ], aged 18 years or up, who had at least one cNF were recruited when they visited the outpatient Neurology clinic of the Erasmus Medical Centre from July 2022 through September 2023. Patients with severe comorbidities, defined as advanced malignant tumours during the time of the study, were excluded. When interested patients had not completed the questionnaires two weeks after the clinic visit, a reminder email was sent. A final telephone call was made as reminder four weeks after the clinic visit. Every responder was included in the analysis. A digital version of the cNF-Skindex was administered to the participants using the data capture system Castor EDC. At the first administration, participants also completed a general information questionnaire, the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire [ 17 ] and the SF-36 questionnaire [ 18 ]. To study the test-retest reliability, participants were asked to complete the cNF-Skindex for a second time, 14 days after they completed the first administration. Questionnaires used in this study A general information questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic variables of the participants, such as gender, age, marital status, education level, presence of learning problems, employment status, the estimated number of cNF (categories 0–10, 11–50, 51–100, 100+, based on Fertitta et al. [ 8 ]), general health perceptions, and the presence of other health problems. The cNF-Skindex is an 18-item questionnaire, including three domains: “functioning”, “emotions”, and “symptoms” [ 8 ]. Each item is scored on a 7-point Likert scale (0 being never bothered, 6 being always bothered), with a recall period of seven days. The total score of the questionnaire ranges from 0 (no impairment of cNF-related QoL) to 108 (maximal impairment). A higher cNF-Skindex score indicates a poorer cNF-related QoL. The cNF-Skindex has three severity strata: patients with a total score from 0 to 11 can be considered as having non bothersome cNF, patients with a total score of 12 to 48 having moderately bothersome cNF, and patients with a total score of 49 or higher having importantly or very importantly bothersome cNF [ 19 ]. The cNF-Skindex has been validated in a French and US population of patients and showed good to excellent psychometric properties [ 8 ,  19 ]. The EQ-5D-5L is a brief and generic health status measure that comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression [ 17 ]. Each dimension has five Likert response options, ranging from ‘no problems’ to ‘extreme problems’. It has a one-day recall period. The answers given by the patient on the five dimensions are combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient’s health state. The EQ-5D-5L also has a visual analog scale (the EQ-VAS) on which the patients can rate their own health from 0 to 100 (worst to best perceived health). The 36-item Short Form Survey (SF-36) is a generic health-related QoL measure [ 18 ]. It comprises eight domains of health: physical function, limitations because of physical problems, limitations because of emotional problems, social function, mental health, energy, pain, and health perception. The item scores are recoded into percentages, ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a more favourable health state. Items in the same domain are averaged together to create the eight scale scores. The version with the standard (4 weeks) recall period was used in this study. Clinical information from electronic health records Additional clinical information was extracted from the electronic health records of the participants, including the presence of NF1 diagnostic criteria, the presence of other NF1-related disease manifestations (osseous lesions, optic pathway glioma (OPG), other brain glioma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour, pheochromocytoma), and the occurrence of any cNF-related interventions (surgical resection, CO2 laser, photocoagulation, electrodessication or diathermy). Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 28.0. Non-parametric tests were used given the non-normal distribution of the data. The total and subdomain scores of the cNF-Skindex, EQ-5D-5L, and SF-36 were computed according to scoring instructions. The population was described using the mean, standard deviation (SD), and range for continuous variables, and count and frequency for categorical variables. The feasibility of the Dutch version of the cNF-Skindex was analysed by assessing the presence of significant floor and/or ceiling effects for the total score and domain scores. Floor and ceiling effects were considered significant if ≥ 15% of the participants had the lowest or highest score. The internal consistency was evaluated by calculating Cronbach’s α, with a Cronbach’s α of ≥ 0.70 being considered adequate [ 20 ]. The test-retest reliability was determined by calculating the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients between the scores of the first and second administration. A value of ≥ 0.75 indicates adequate test-retest reliability [ 21 ]. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess known-group validity between participants based on the number of cNF (≤ 50 or > 50), and the occurrence of cNF-related interventions. Convergent validity was assessed by calculating the Spearman rank correlation coefficients between the total and subdomain cNF-Skindex scores and the individual item scores of the EQ-5D-5L, the visual analogue scale of the EQ-5D-5L, and the SF-36. An exploratory factor analysis was performed to study if the three domains of the French cNF-Skindex (emotions, symptoms, and functions) were confirmed in the Dutch version. Spearman’s correlation coefficients (r) for all items were computed. The factor analysis was conducted using promax rotation. The Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) test was used to verify the sampling adequacy for the analysis. The scree plot and eigenvalues were used to justify the selection of the number of components. Component loadings of ≥ 0.4 were considered relevant [ 22 ]. Multivariable linear regression was performed to explore the association between the total cNF-Skindex score and the following factors: >50 cNF, age, sex, educational level (ISCED level), and the occurrence of any cNF-related intervention (yes/no). Educational level was included to control for the effect of cognitive impairment, which is present in 40–80% of the patients with NF1 [ 23 – 26 ], to correct for its influence on how patients interpret and complete the cNF-Skindex questionnaire. The cNF-Skindex scores resulting from the present study were compared with the scores from the French population in which the cNF-Skindex was originally validated using independent t-tests [ 8 ].",Britt A E Dhaenens; Sarah A van Dijk; Laura Fertitta; Walter Taal; Pierre Wolkenstein; Rianne Oostenbrink,Journal of patient-reported outcomes,2024-05-29,10.1186/s41687-024-00732-w,minimal,True
PMID:37378983,Effect of Mind-Body Skills Training on Quality of Life for Geographically Diverse Adults With Neurofibromatosis: A Fully Remote Randomized Clinical Trial.,"IMPORTANCE: Neurofibromatoses (NF; NF1, NF2, and schwannomatosis) are hereditary tumor predisposition syndromes with a risk for poor quality of life (QOL) and no evidence-based treatments. OBJECTIVE: To compare a mind-body skills training program, the Relaxation Response Resiliency Program for NF (3RP-NF), with a health education program (Health Enhancement Program for NF; HEP-NF) for improvement of quality of life among adults with NF. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This single-blind, remote randomized clinical trial randomly assigned 228 English-speaking adults with NF from around the world on a 1:1 basis, stratified by NF type, between October 1, 2017, and January 31, 2021, with the last follow-up February 28, 2022. INTERVENTIONS: Eight 90-minute group virtual sessions of 3RP-NF or HEP-NF. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes were collected at baseline, after treatment, and at 6-month and 1-year follow-up. The primary outcomes were physical health and psychological domain scores of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF). Secondary outcomes were the social relationships and environment domain scores of the WHOQOL-BREF. Scores are reported as transformed domain scores (range, 0-100, with higher scores indicating higher QOL). Analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: Of 371 participants who underwent screening, 228 were randomized (mean [SD] age, 42.7 [14.5] years; 170 women [75%]), and 217 attended 6 or more of 8 sessions and provided posttest data. Participants in both programs improved from baseline to after treatment in primary outcomes of physical health QOL score (3RP-NF, 5.1; 95% CI, 3.2-7.0; P < .001; HEP-NF, 6.4; 95% CI, 4.6-8.3; P < .001) and psychological QOL score (3RP-NF, 8.5; 95% CI, 6.4-10.7; P < .001; HEP-NF, 9.2; 95% CI, 7.1-11.2; P < .001). Participants in the 3RP-NF group showed sustained improvements after treatment to 12 months; posttreatment improvements for the HEP-NF group diminished (between-group difference for physical health QOL score, 4.9; 95% CI, 2.1-7.7; P = .001; effect size [ES] = 0.3; and psychological QOL score, 3.7; 95% CI, 0.2-7.6; P = .06; ES = 0.2). Results were similar for secondary outcomes of social relationships and environmental QOL. There were significant between-group differences from baseline to 12 months in favor of the 3RP-NF for physical health QOL score (3.6; 95% CI, 0.5-6.6; P = .02; ES = 0.2), social relationships QOL score (6.9; 95% CI, 1.2-12.7; P = .02; ES = 0.3), and environmental QOL score (3.5; 95% CI, 0.4-6.5; P = .02; ES = 0.2). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial of 3RP-NF vs HEP-NF, benefits from 3RP-NF and HEP-NF were comparable after treatment, but at 12 months from baseline, 3RP-NF was superior to HEP-NF on all primary and secondary outcomes. Results support the implementation of 3RP-NF in routine care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03406208.","Methods Details of the study design have been previously described.  This study follows the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials Extension ( 13 CONSORT Extension ) reporting guideline. The study was ethically reviewed and approved by the institutional review board at Massachusetts General Hospital. The trial protocol is available in  Supplement 1 . Participants provided written informed consent, did not receive compensation, and met virtually with study staff to review eligibility and safety protocols. Recruitment and Participants Advertisements were distributed via listservs through the NF registry within the Children’s Tumor Foundation and global NF centers. A total of 993 patients responded to the flyer, 371 were screened, 286 were eligible, and 228 signed informed consent. Inclusion criteria were (1) diagnoses of NF1, NF2, or schwannomatosis; (2) age 18 years or older; (3) ability to provide informed consent; (4) sixth-grade English reading level or higher; (5) self-reported stress and difficulties coping with NF symptoms; and (6) Perceived Stress Scale score of 6 or higher.  Exclusion criteria were (1) severe psychopathologic conditions that would interfere with study procedures, (2) change in antidepressants in the past 3 months, (3) participation in cognitive behavioral or relaxation therapy in the past 3 months, (4) significant mental health conditions requiring immediate treatment based on self-report and observation during screening, and (5) unwilling or unable to participate in virtual programs. Participants self-reported their race and ethnicity, which was collected to contribute to statistics on the prevalence of NF. Enrollment occurred October 1, 2017, to January 31, 2021, with the last follow-up February 28, 2022. 14 , 15 Measures and Data Collection Primary Outcomes The 2 primary outcomes were the physical health and psychological QOL domain scores of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF),  recommended by the Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) International Collaboration. 16 , 17  The physical health domain (7 items) assesses activities of daily living, dependence on medical substances or aids, energy and fatigue, mobility, pain and discomfort, sleep and rest, and work capacity. The psychological domain (6 items) assesses enjoyment in life, meaningfulness of life, ability to concentrate, completely accepting bodily appearance, satisfaction with self, and frequency of negative feelings. Scores are reported as transformed domain scores (0-100), with higher scores indicating higher QOL. The WHOQOL-BREF is a reliable, valid, and shorter version of the original WHOQOL-100. 18  Because an NF-specific minimal clinically significant difference (MCID) does not exist for NF, we cautiously used the MCID value of 6.26 units established for patients with cancer 17  to depict clinical significance. 19 Secondary Outcomes Secondary outcomes included social relationships QOL and environment QOL as measured by the respective domains of the WHOQOL-BREF.  The social relationships QOL domain (3 items) measures satisfaction with personal relationships, availability of social support, and satisfaction with sexual relationships. The environment QOL domain (8 items) assesses financial resources, physical safety and security, accessibility and quality of health and social care, home environment, opportunities for acquiring skills and information, leisure activities, physical environment, and transportation. 16 , 17 Data Collection Assessments were completed at baseline, after treatment, and at 6- and 12-month follow-up via REDCap.  A research assistant answered any questions. Questionnaires were sent 3 times and followed up with a telephone call, after which unresponsive participants were considered lost to follow-up. 20 Fidelity We followed National Institutes of Health Behavioral Change Consortium guidelines.  Fidelity of the design was ensured through weekly team meetings to review participants’ progression through the study as well as monthly quality control checks. Fidelity of training was ensured by selecting as interventionists PhD-level or advanced doctoral students in clinical psychology with expertise in mind-body therapy who attended weekly supervision. Treatment delivery was ensured by the completion of an adherence checklist after a session; 15% of all sessions were randomly selected to be reviewed for adherence. 21 Intervention and Control Conditions Eight weekly virtual group sessions in each condition lasted 90 minutes per session. The therapists were 5 PhD-level interventionists (including E.L.) trained and supervised by a senior clinical psychologist (A.-M.V.) with expertise in NF and mind-body medicine. Both study treatments included rehearsal, repetition, and review of previously learned skills. Participants in both conditions received a patient manual designed for a sixth-grade comprehension level to accommodate participants with learning disabilities and other cognitive issues. Intervention The 3RP-NF has 3 core components: (1) relaxation response–elicitation (relaxation and mindfulness skills), (2) appraisal and coping (adaptive coping skills), and (3) growth enhancement (acceptance, problem-solving, and positive psychology skills) aimed to improve QOL. Each session included a relaxation exercise, a review of previously taught skills, and an introduction of a new skill, and ended with a short relaxation exercise. The final session reviewed all skills, emphasizing continuing skill practice after the end of the program. Additional information on the intervention is presented in  Supplement 1  and eAppendices 1, 2, and 3 in  Supplement 2 . Active Control The HEP-NF included educational information on NF from the Children’s Tumor Foundation and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention websites. Modules provided education on NF-related stress and symptoms, sleep, nutrition, exercise, communication, and health care management. The last session included information on ways to maintain positive health changes made during the program. Randomization A randomization schedule with a 1:1 ratio of assignment to 3RP-NF and HEP-NF, stratified by NF type using a permuted-block design, was constructed by the unblinded biostatistician (E.M.) and managed with REDCap. A clinical research coordinator randomized up to 16 participants as a cohort and subsequently scheduled a treatment session time. Because not all participants could join the same session time, group sizes were uneven (median, 8 [range, 3-8]). Participants were told that they would participate in 1 of 2 stress and symptom management programs (program 1, intervention; program 2, control) to maintain blinding and scientific rigor. Statistical Analysis The effective SDs for the change in physical health and psychological QOL scores from preliminary data (baseline to after treatment, 14.7 and 10.4 units, respectively ; and after treatment to the 6-month follow-up, 11.4 to 10.0 units, respectively) estimated that 224 participants provided 80% power for primary outcomes of physical health QOL and 96% power for psychological QOL. This assumed an MCID of 6.25 units, allowing up to 5% loss to follow-up after treatment and testing each of the primary outcomes at  12 P  < .025 (2-tailed). Expecting up to 20% of participants to drop out before 6 months, the trial had 99% power to declare noninferiority of 3RP-NF over HEP-NF, assuming genuinely no (zero) difference between treatments in the maintenance of any change from before baseline to after treatment. We used SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc), for analyses. We used intention-to-treat principles. We applied a shared-baseline, linear mixed model with completely unstructured covariance (selected through examination of model fit indices) among up to 4 repeated measurements (baseline, after treatment, and 6- and 12-month follow-up) and unstructured random visit-specific effects by session cohort to examine treatment effects on the primary and secondary outcomes. We ran a series of contrasts to assess the specific hypotheses about the within-group and between-group differences in the outcome variables at different time points. The model included all available data, including data from participants with incomplete evaluations and those lost to follow-up. The estimated covariance among repeated measurements implicitly imputes missing data and yields unbiased estimates under a missing-at-random assumption. The shared-baseline assumption represents the actual state of the population before randomization. It has the advantage of adjusting for chance differences at baseline in the same way as analysis of covariance. 22 Treatment-dependent differences on changes from baseline to after treatment and to 6- and 12-month follow-up, and persistence of a benefit after treatment to the 6- and 12-month follow-up for each outcome were estimated from linear contrasts of least-square means and reported as point estimates and their unadjusted 95% CIs. Superiority of 3RP-NF at baseline to after treatment was based on a 2-tailed  P  < .025 to account for 2 primary outcomes. A noninferiority criterion for the persistence of benefit was prespecified (lower 1-sided 95% confidence bound for a given primary outcome less than the MCID of 6.25 units in favor of HEP-NF). Still, we present those results because the data demonstrated that 3RP-NF was superior to HEP-NF in maintaining benefits. We calculated the model-based effect size (ES) estimate (standardized mean difference for each comparison).  We divided the model-derived mean difference estimates by the pooled within-individual variations of each outcome at baseline. This ES index is equivalent to the Cohen  23 , 24 , 25 d  in RCTs. 23 , 24 , 25 We performed sensitivity analyses. We tested treatment-dependent differences in the change of score from baseline to after treatment and at 6- and 12-month follow-up using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to relax the parametric assumptions of the mixed model. We investigated more parsimonious covariance structures using random participant-specific intercepts, slopes, and quadratic terms (ie, growth curve analysis). Primary inference of efficacy was based on the estimated mean difference between 3RP-NF and HEP-NF in change from baseline to after treatment for primary outcomes of physical health and psychological QOL scores, testing each at a 2-tailed  P  < .025 to maintain an overall type I error rate of 5%. Given the lack of significance for these tests, unadjusted  P  values and 95% CIs are reported for comparisons with other time points and end points without claims of statistical significance.",Ana-Maria Vranceanu; Heena R Manglani; Nathaniel R Choukas; Millan R Kanaya; Ethan Lester; Emily L Zale; Scott R Plotkin; Justin Jordan; Eric Macklin; Jafar Bakhshaie,JAMA network open,2023-06-01,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.20599,minimal,True
PMID:19292874,Low U1 snRNP dependence at the NF1 exon 29 donor splice site.,"Many disease-causing splicing mutations described in the literature produce changes in splice sites (SS) or in exon-regulatory sequences. The delineation of these splice aberrations can provide important insights into novel regulation mechanisms. In this study, we evaluated the effect of patient variations in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) exon 29 and its 5'SS surrounding area on its splicing process. Only two of all nonsense, missense, synonymous and intronic variations analyzed in this study clearly altered exon 29 inclusion/exclusion levels. In particular, the intronic mutation +5g>a had the strongest effect, resulting in total exon exclusion. This finding prompted us to evaluate the exon 29 5'SS in relation to its ability to bind U1 snRNP. This was performed by direct analysis of the ability of U1 to bind to wild-type and mutant donor sites, by engineering an in vitro splicing system to directly evaluate the functional importance of U1 snRNA base pairing with the exon 29 donor site, and by coexpression of mutant U1 snRNP molecules to try to rescue exon 29 inclusion in vivo. The results revealed a low dependency on the presence of U1 snRNP, and suggest that exon 29 donor site definition may depend on alternative mechanisms of 5'SS recognition.",,Michela Raponi; Emanuele Buratti; Elisa Dassie; Meena Upadhyaya; Diana Baralle,The FEBS journal,2009-04,10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.06941.x,abstract_only,False
PMID:17581973,Distinct functional domains of neurofibromatosis type 1 regulate immediate versus long-term memory formation.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a dominant genetic disorder that causes tumors of the peripheral nervous system. In addition, >40% of afflicted children have learning difficulties. The NF1 protein contains a highly conserved GTPase-activating protein domain that inhibits Ras activity, and the C-terminal region regulates cAMP levels via G-protein-dependent activation of adenylyl cyclase. Behavioral analysis indicates that learning is disrupted in both Drosophila and mouse NF1 models. Our previous work has shown that defective cAMP signaling leads to the learning phenotype in Drosophila Nf1 mutants. In the present report, our experiments showed that in addition to learning, long-term memory was also abolished in Nf1 mutants. However, altered NF1-regulated Ras activity is responsible for this defect rather than altered cAMP levels. Furthermore, by expressing clinically relevant human NF1 mutations and deletions in Drosophila Nf1-null mutants, we demonstrated that the GAP-related domain of NF1 was necessary and sufficient for long-term memory, whereas the C-terminal domain of NF1 was essential for immediate memory. Thus, we show that two separate functional domains of the same protein can participate independently in the formation of two distinct memory components.",,Ivan Shun Ho; Frances Hannan; Hui-Fu Guo; Inessa Hakker; Yi Zhong,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2007-06-20,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0933-07.2007,abstract_only,False
PMID:29897904,Traditional and systems biology based drug discovery for the rare tumor syndrome neurofibromatosis type 2.,"Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is a rare tumor suppressor syndrome that manifests with multiple schwannomas and meningiomas. There are no effective drug therapies for these benign tumors and conventional therapies have limited efficacy. Various model systems have been created and several drug targets have been implicated in NF2-driven tumorigenesis based on known effects of the absence of merlin, the product of the NF2 gene. We tested priority compounds based on known biology with traditional dose-concentration studies in meningioma and schwann cell systems. Concurrently, we studied functional kinome and gene expression in these cells pre- and post-treatment to determine merlin deficient molecular phenotypes. Cell viability results showed that three agents (GSK2126458, Panobinostat, CUDC-907) had the greatest activity across schwannoma and meningioma cell systems, but merlin status did not significantly influence response. In vivo, drug effect was tumor specific with meningioma, but not schwannoma, showing response to GSK2126458 and Panobinostat. In culture, changes in both the transcriptome and kinome in response to treatment clustered predominantly based on tumor type. However, there were differences in both gene expression and functional kinome at baseline between meningioma and schwannoma cell systems that may form the basis for future selective therapies. This work has created an openly accessible resource (www.synapse.org/SynodosNF2) of fully characterized isogenic schwannoma and meningioma cell systems as well as a rich data source of kinome and transcriptome data from these assay systems before and after treatment that enables single and combination drug discovery based on molecular phenotype.",Materials and methods Detailed materials and methods can be found in  S5 Text .,Robert Allaway; Steve P Angus; Roberta L Beauchamp; Jaishri O Blakeley; Marga Bott; Sarah S Burns; Annemarie Carlstedt; Long-Sheng Chang; Xin Chen; D Wade Clapp; Patrick A Desouza; Serkan Erdin; Cristina Fernandez-Valle; Justin Guinney; James F Gusella; Stephen J Haggarty; Gary L Johnson; Salvatore La Rosa; Helen Morrison; Alejandra M Petrilli; Scott R Plotkin; Abhishek Pratap; Vijaya Ramesh; Noah Sciaky; Anat Stemmer-Rachamimov; Tim J Stuhlmiller; Michael E Talkowski; D Bradley Welling; Charles W Yates; Jon S Zawistowski; Wen-Ning Zhao,PloS one,2018,10.1371/journal.pone.0197350,minimal,True
PMID:2456020,Expression of nerve growth factor receptor in paraffin-embedded soft tissue tumors.,"Identification of growth factors and receptors in mesenchymal tumors may be crucial to understanding of growth regulation in sarcomas. During an immunohistochemical study of the expression of growth factors and receptors in human soft tissue tumors (STT), only 1 antisera capable of working in paraffin-embedded tissue was noted. A detailed study of 141 STT was undertaken to determine the frequency of expression of nerve growth factor receptor (NGF-R), its specificity and sensitivity for neural tumors, and the effect of fixation on detection. In normal mesenchymal tissue, only nerve sheath and perivascular staining was seen. No immunoreactivity was seen in many tumors including rhabdomyosarcoma, angiosarcoma, liposarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and alveolar soft part sarcoma. Less than 15% of tumors of smooth muscle, fibrous, or fibrohistiocytic origin showed immunoreactivity, usually focal. In contrast, a high frequency of immunoreactivity was noted in tumors of neural origin (74%). This included granular cell tumors (100%), Schwannoma/neurofibroma (91%), malignant Schwannoma (78%), neuroblastoma/neuroepithelioma (60%), and paraganglioma (57%). A high rate of reactivity was also seen in synovial sarcomas (80%), undifferentiated sarcomas (60%), and hemangiopericytomas (43%), suggesting a potential relationship to the neural phenotype. Among the neural tumors, Bouin's fixation was superior to formalin, suggesting that immunoreactivity for NGF-R is affected by fixation.

PMID:30617350,"A cerebellopontine angle mouse model for the investigation of tumor biology, hearing, and neurological function in NF2-related vestibular schwannoma.","Neurofibromatosis type II (NF2) is a disease that lacks effective therapies. NF2 is characterized by bilateral vestibular schwannomas (VSs) that cause progressive and debilitating hearing loss, leading to social isolation and increased rates of depression. A major limitation in NF2 basic and translational research is the lack of animal models that allow the full spectrum of research into the biology and molecular mechanisms of NF2 tumor progression, as well as the effects on neurological function. In this protocol, we describe how to inject schwannoma cells into the mouse brain cerebellopontine angle (CPA) region. We also describe how to apply state-of-the-art intravital imaging and hearing assessment techniques to study tumor growth and hearing loss. In addition, ataxia, angiogenesis, and tumor-stroma interaction assays can be applied, and the model can be used to test the efficacy of novel therapeutic approaches. By studying the disease from every angle, this model offers the potential to unravel the basic biological underpinnings of NF2 and to develop novel therapeutics to control this devastating disease. Our protocol can be adapted to study other diseases within the CPA, including meningiomas, lipomas, vascular malformations, hemangiomas, epidermoid cysts, cerebellar astrocytomas, and metastatic lesions. The entire surgical procedure takes ~45 min per mouse and allows for subsequent longitudinal imaging, as well as neurological and hearing assessment, for up to 2 months.","Experimental design Our protocol involves four major components. First, a surgical procedure is used to implant VS cells into the CPA region. The surgical procedure is easy and straightforward, and involves drilling a hole into the skull (the cranial door technique), and stereotactically injecting tumor cells into the CPA in mice (Steps 1–25) ( Fig. 1 ). We have successfully grown murine NF2 −/−  Schwann cells in syngeneic mice and human HEI-193 schwannoma cells in nude mice to establish schwannomas in the CPA model. Second, tumor growth is measured by blood GLuc assay (Steps 26–30) ( Fig. 2 ). During the development of our model and protocol optimization, we used MRI to confirm tumor formation in the CPA region as early as 7 d post implantation ( Fig. 2a ) . However, MRI is costly and time consuming, and requires frequent anesthesia, making serial tumor size measurements infeasible. Blood GLuc assay can be easily tested by drawing a few microliters of blood 6 . To ensure that blood GLuc activity is a precise surrogate measure for monitoring tumor growth, we performed concomitant blood GLuc assay and measurements of tumor volume using ultrasound. The 3D dynamic contrast-enhanced (3D-DCE) ultrasound imaging allows 3D reconstruction of tumor volume and provides accurate volumetric measurement of tumor size. We demonstrated a strong correlation between ultrasound-measured tumor volume and blood GLuc activity ( 6 , 9 Fig. 2b , c ), indicating that the changes in GLuc activity accurately reflect tumor growth. The use of ultrasound in imaging the brain is limited because of the high acoustic impedance of skull bones. To perform ultrasound measurement of brain tumors, we needed to implant a cranial window with a polyethylene coverslip into the mouse head, which is technically challenging and time consuming. Therefore, during model utilization (after the model development stage), we relied on GLuc activity to monitor tumor growth. The third part of the Procedure is the evaluation of the severity of tumor-induced neurological symptoms and the potential treatment effects on improving neurological function (Steps 31–44). We measure hearing function by DPOAE and ABR tests  ( 6 Figs. 3a ,  4a ), and cerebellar ataxia using behavior tests, including hind-limb clasping, and ledge and gait tests . In the Procedure, we describe how to carry out the hearing function tests. In the CPA model, we found that the ledge test, which evaluates coordination, is the most sensitive test, and can detect changes in mice as early as 2 weeks following tumor implantation. The hind-limb clasping test (a marker of disease progression) and the gait test (measuring muscle function and coordination) showed differences at later time points ( 10 Figs. 3b ,  4b ). Balance, motor strength, and coordination can be assayed by rotarod assay  ( 9 , 10 Fig. 3c ). Finally, the Procedure can be adapted to include application of a cranial window to study the biology and mechanisms of tumor–host interactions in the CPA model ( Fig. 5a ; ref.  ). The use of cranial windows enables high-resolution, dynamic longitudinal imaging studies, including OFDI to detect perfused vessels ( 9 Fig. 5b – d ) and intravital MPLSM to examine tumor vessel morphology, measure blood vessel permeability, and monitor delivery of drugs (Steps 45A and B) ( Fig. 5e – g ) . To optimize the subsequent intravital imaging, we recommend applying the cranial window before embarking on the procedure and waiting for at least 1 week after window implantation for potential inflammation to subside before tumor cell implantation during a second surgery. Most importantly, when implanting the cranial window, the surgical procedure may force serous fluid from the wound into the outer ear canal and cause conductive hearing loss. Therefore, the use of cranial windows should be avoided in studies aiming to test hearing function. 9 Considerations when calculating the number of animals required To obtain a sufficient number of mice with CPA tumors, the survival rate post surgery and tumor cell implantation, as well as the rate of tumor take should be considered. The animal number calculated enables comparison of tumor growth between groups. The expected difference ranges from 0.2-to 3-fold, with standard deviations ranging from 0.5-to 1.5-fold (see the Troubleshooting section). If the true difference is 50% and the standard deviation is 50%, we have >99% power to detect the difference using a two-sided  t  test with 5% type 1 error and  n  = 10. Simulations show that we will have >80% power using the van Elteren test with 5% type 1 error. A sample calculation for a typical experimental treatment study in the CPA model is as follows:
 An experimental group size that usually allows the detection of potential statistically significant differences in tumor growth between different treatments is  n  = 10 mice per group. For example, there could be three treatment groups: a control group (treated with vehicle or placebo), a standard-therapy (e.g., radiation) group, and an experimental therapy group. The overall survival rate after surgery and tumor implantation is 80%. The survival rate may vary with the experience and technical skill level of the scientist performing the surgeries. For the NF2 −/−  mouse Schwann cell line, the tumor take rate is 90%. In this case, 10 mice × 3 groups/0.8 (80% survival rate)/0.9 (90% tumor take rate) = 41 mice. Considerations of cost and time The model described in this protocol has a high cost in terms of reagents; surgical, neurologic, and auditory expertise; and the various techniques and equipment used (including those for specialized imaging and hearing assessment). Cost calculations must also take into account animal housing, as well as the time, effort and expertise needed for animal handling and surgery. Materials Biological materials Mice.

PMID:18371380,Neurofibromatosis-1 regulates neuronal and glial cell differentiation from neuroglial progenitors in vivo by both cAMP- and Ras-dependent mechanisms.,"Individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) develop abnormalities of both neuronal and glial cell lineages, suggesting that the NF1 protein neurofibromin is an essential regulator of neuroglial progenitor function. In this regard, Nf1-deficient embryonic telencephalic neurospheres exhibit increased self-renewal and prolonged survival as explants in vivo. Using a newly developed brain lipid binding protein (BLBP)-Cre mouse strain to study the role of neurofibromin in neural progenitor cell function in the intact animal, we now show that neuroglial progenitor Nf1 inactivation results in increased glial lineage proliferation and abnormal neuronal differentiation in vivo. Whereas the glial cell lineage abnormalities are recapitulated by activated Ras or Akt expression in vivo, the neuronal abnormalities were Ras- and Akt independent and reflected impaired cAMP generation in Nf1-deficient cells in vivo and in vitro. Together, these findings demonstrate that neurofibromin is required for normal glial and neuronal development involving separable Ras-dependent and cAMP-dependent mechanisms.",,Balazs Hegedus; Biplab Dasgupta; Jung Eun Shin; Ryan J Emnett; Elizabeth K Hart-Mahon; Lynda Elghazi; Ernesto Bernal-Mizrachi; David H Gutmann,Cell stem cell,2007-10-11,10.1016/j.stem.2007.07.008,abstract_only,False
PMID:21963267,Choroidal abnormalities detected by near-infrared reflectance imaging as a new diagnostic criterion for neurofibromatosis 1.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate in a large sample of consecutive patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) the possibility of including the presence of choroidal abnormalities detected by near-infrared reflectance (NIR) as a new diagnostic criterion for NF1. DESIGN: Cross-sectional evaluation of a diagnostic test. PARTICIPANTS AND CONTROLS: Ninety-five consecutive adult and pediatric patients (190 eyes) with NF1, diagnosed based on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria. Controls included 100 healthy age- and gender-matched control subjects. METHODS: Confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy was performed for each subject, investigating the presence and the number of choroidal abnormalities. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy for the different cutoff values of the criterion choroidal nodules detected by NIR compared with the NIH criteria. RESULTS: Choroidal nodules detected by NIR imaging were present in 79 (82%) of 95 of the NF1 patients, including 15 (71%) of the 21 NF1 pediatric patients. Similar abnormalities were present in 7 (7%) of 100 healthy subjects, including 2 (8%) of the 25 healthy pediatric subjects. The highest accuracy was obtained at the cutoff value of 1.5 choroidal nodules detected by NIR imagery. Sensitivity and specificity of the examination at the optimal cutoff point were 83% and 96%, respectively. Diagnostic accuracy was 90% in the overall population and 83% in the pediatric population. Both of these values were in line with the most common NIH diagnostic criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Choroidal abnormalities appearing as bright patchy nodules detected by NIR imaging frequently occurred in NF1 patients. The present study shows that NIR examination to detect choroidal involvement should be considered as a new diagnostic criterion for NF1.",,Francesco Viola; Edoardo Villani; Federica Natacci; Angelo Selicorni; Giulia Melloni; Diego Vezzola; Giulio Barteselli; Chiara Mapelli; Cesare Pirondini; Roberto Ratiglia,Ophthalmology,2012-02,10.1016/j.ophtha.2011.07.046,abstract_only,False
PMID:24912773,Structural basis of DDB1-and-Cullin 4-associated Factor 1 (DCAF1) recognition by merlin/NF2 and its implication in tumorigenesis by CD44-mediated inhibition of merlin suppression of DCAF1 function.,"Merlin, a tumor suppressor encoded by the neurofibromatosis type 2 gene, has been shown to suppress tumorigenesis by inhibiting the Cullin 4-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4(DCAF) (1) in the nucleus. This inhibition is mediated by direct binding of merlin to DDB1-and-Cullin 4-associated Factor 1 (DCAF1), yet the binding mode of merlin to DCAF1 is not well defined. Here, we report structural and biophysical studies of the merlin binding to DCAF1 and its interference with CD44 binding. The crystal structure of the merlin FERM domain bound to the DCAF1 C-terminal acidic tail reveals that the hydrophobic IILXLN motif located at the C-terminal end of DCAF1 binds subdomain C of the FERM domain by forming a β-strand. The binding site and mode resemble that of merlin binding to the CD44 cytoplasmic tail. Competition binding assay showed that CD44 and DCAF1 compete for binding to the merlin FERM domain in solution. The CD44 cytoplasmic tail is known to be cleaved for nuclear translocation by regulated intra-membrane proteolysis (RIP). Our structure implies that, in the nucleus, the CD44 cytoplasmic tail cleaved by RIP could release DCAF1 from merlin by competing for binding to the merlin FERM domain, which results in the inhibition of merlin-mediated suppression of tumorigenesis.",,Tomoyuki Mori; Shuhei Gotoh; Maya Shirakawa; Toshio Hakoshima,Genes to cells : devoted to molecular & cellular mechanisms,2014-08,10.1111/gtc.12161,abstract_only,False
PMID:7505343,"Modulation of the neurofibromatosis type 1 gene product, neurofibromin, during Schwann cell differentiation.","Neurofibromin, the product of the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene, is a approximately 250 kDa protein expressed predominantly in cortical neurons and oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) and sensory neurons and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). To gain insight into the biological role of neurofibromin in Schwann cells, the modulation of NF1 gene expression in a Schwann cell line (MT4H1) stimulated to either proliferate or differentiate in response to agents that elevate intracellular cAMP was examined. Untreated cells and cells exposed to mitogenic doses of forskolin (1-10 microM) or 8-bromo-cAMP (0.1 mM) expressed low levels of NF1 mRNA and the protein was barely detectable. High doses of forskolin (100 microM) or 8-bromo-cAMP (1 mM) induced the expression of both myelin P0 protein and neurofibromin with an identical time course. Although NF1 mRNA levels peaked within 1-6 hr, the rise in neurofibromin was not apparent until 24-48 hr and peaked 72 hr after treatment. P0 and neurofibromin were also coinduced by cell-cell contact in high density, untreated cultures. Moreover, differentiation initiated by either cAMP stimulation or high density culture conditions was associated with predominant expression of the type 2 NF1 mRNA isoform. In contrast, type 1 NF1 mRNA isoform expression was observed in untreated Schwann cells or those stimulated with mitogenic doses of forskolin or 8-bromo-cAMP. A switch from the type 1 neurofibromin that can efficiently downregulate p21-ras to the type 2 isoform with reduced activity may facilitate a p21-ras signaling pathway associated with Schwann cell differentiation.",,D H Gutmann; G I Tennekoon; J L Cole; F S Collins; J L Rutkowski,Journal of neuroscience research,1993-10-01,10.1002/jnr.490360212,abstract_only,False
PMID:27956228,Genome-Wide CRISPR Screen Identifies Regulators of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase as Suppressors of Liver Tumors in Mice.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: It has been a challenge to identify liver tumor suppressors or oncogenes due to the genetic heterogeneity of these tumors. We performed a genome-wide screen to identify suppressors of liver tumor formation in mice, using CRISPR-mediated genome editing. METHODS: We performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-based knockout screen of P53-null mouse embryonic liver progenitor cells that overexpressed MYC. We infected p53 RESULTS: We identified 4 candidate liver tumor suppressor genes not previously associated with liver cancer (Nf1, Plxnb1, Flrt2, and B9d1). CRISPR-mediated knockout of Nf1, a negative regulator of RAS, accelerated liver tumor formation in mice. Loss of Nf1 or activation of RAS up-regulated the liver progenitor cell markers HMGA2 and SOX9. RAS pathway inhibitors suppressed the activation of the Hmga2 and Sox9 genes that resulted from loss of Nf1 or oncogenic activation of RAS. Knockdown of HMGA2 delayed formation of xenograft tumors from cells that expressed oncogenic RAS. In human HCCs, low levels of NF1 messenger RNA or high levels of HMGA2 messenger RNA were associated with shorter patient survival time. Liver cancer cells with inactivation of Plxnb1, Flrt2, and B9d1 formed more tumors in mice and had increased levels of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: Using a CRISPR-based strategy, we identified Nf1, Plxnb1, Flrt2, and B9d1 as suppressors of liver tumor formation. We validated the observation that RAS signaling, via mitogen-activated protein kinase, contributes to formation of liver tumors in mice. We associated decreased levels of NF1 and increased levels of its downstream protein HMGA2 with survival times of patients with HCC. Strategies to inhibit or reduce HMGA2 might be developed to treat patients with liver cancer.","METHODS: We performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-based knockout screen of P53-null mouse embryonic liver progenitor cells that overexpressed MYC. We infected  p53 −/− ; Myc ; Cas9  hepatocytes with the mGeCKOa lentiviral library of 67,000 single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs), targeting 20,611 mouse genes, and transplanted the transduced cells subcutaneously into nude mice. Within 1 month, all the mice that received the sgRNA library developed subcutaneous tumors. We performed high-throughput sequencing of tumor DNA and identified sgRNAs increased at least 8-fold compared to the initial cell pool. To validate the top 10 candidate tumor suppressors from this screen, we collected data from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using the Cancer Genome Atlas and COSMIC databases. We used CRISPR to inactivate candidate tumor suppressor genes in  p53 −/− ;Myc;Cas9 cells and transplanted them subcutaneously into nude mice; tumor formation was monitored and tumors were analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry. Mice with liver-specific disruption of p53 were given hydrodynamic tail-vein injections of plasmids encoding Myc and sgRNA/ Cas9  designed to disrupt candidate tumor suppressors; growth of tumors and metastases was monitored. We compared gene expression profiles of liver cells with vs without tumor suppressor gene disrupted by sgRNA/ Cas9 . Genes found to be upregulated following tumor suppressor loss were examined in liver cancer cell lines; their expression was knocked down using small hairpin RNAs, and tumor growth was examined in nude mice. Effects of the MEK inhibitors AZD6244, U0126, and trametinib, or the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib, were examined in human and mouse HCC cell lines. Materials and Methods CRISPR vectors sgRNA sequences ( Supplementary Table S1 ) were from the mGeCKOa library  , or designed as described  24 . sgNf1.1 was from the library and sgNf1.4 was designed to rule out off-target effects. sgRNA oligos (IDT) were annealed and cloned into the pX330 vector (addgene 42230) or lentiV2 (addgene 52961)  52  using standard Bbsl or BsmBI protocols. 24 Cell culture and infection Cell culture conditions were as described  
 53 p53 −/−  fetal hepatocytes were harvested from ED = 18  p53 −/−  fetal liver   and infected with packaged retroviral Myc and lentiviral Cas9 twice and selected for with blasticidin. The cells were then infected with the lentiviral mGeCKOa sgRNA library  54 . Virus was prepared by the UMass shRNA Viral Core. Puromycin-resistant cells were collected. 293fs cells were used to package lentivirus encoding individual sgRNA and Cas9. All data are representative of at least two independent infections. Sorafenib, selumetinib (AZD6244), Trametinib (GSK1120212) and U0126 were purchased from Selleck. 24 Animal experiments All animal protocols were approved by the UMass Medical School Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were humanely euthanized by CO 2  asphyxiation.  p53  mice were crossed with Albumin-Cre mice (Jackson Laboratories)  flox/flox . pX330.sgNf1 (20 μg), pT3-EF1α-Myc (5 μg), and CMV-SB10 transposase (1 μg) plasmids were delivered to ~8 week-old mice by hydrodynamic tail vein injection. Plasmid DNA was purified using an EndoFree Maxiprep DNA Kit (Qiagen). pX330.sgGFP (20 μg) was used as non-targeting control. For multiplexed CRISPR experiments, 10 μg of each pX330 sgRNA vector was injected. For mice livers with too many tumors to count, we defined that they have 20 tumors. For subcutaneous tumor growth, 3 × 10 37 6  ( Figure 1 ) or 1 × 10 6  ( Figure 3A )  p53 −/− ;  Myc ;  Cas9  cells were injected into flanks of 6-8-week old, female, NCI  Nu/Nu  mice (Taconic) and monitored as described  . For  54 p53 −/− ;  HRAS  cells, 50,000 ( G12V Figure 5D ) cells/tumor were injected in  Nu/Nu  mice. Kras G12D ;shp53 mouse cholangiocarcinoma was generated as in   using Kras 41 LSL-G12D/+  liver progenitor cells which express endogenous level of Kras G12D . Histology and Immunohistochemistry Livers were fixed in 4% or 10% (v/v) formalin overnight, and embedded in paraffin. 4 μm liver sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or with antibodies using standard immunohistochemistry protocols. The following antibodies and dilutions were used: 1:400 anti-Hmga2 (Biocheck), 1:100 anti-beta-Catenin (BD bioscience), 1:100 anti-Ck19 (Abcam). Histopathology of mouse liver tumors was evaluated by an experienced pathologist (A.F.). sgRNA deep sequencing processing High-Pure PCR Template Preparation Kit (Roche) was used for genomic DNA purification. sgRNA deep sequencing was performed as described  . All sequencing datasets were evaluated using FastQC (version 0.11.2) to ensure high quality. We built a pipeline in Python (version 2.7.10) to process sgRNA raw sequence reads and derive a ranked list of genes with enriched sgRNAs, and the pipeline is summarized as follows. We first built an index using all sgRNAs in each sample and then used Bowtie (version 1.0.0)  22  to map the sgRNA sequences in the mGeCKOa library to the index in a strand-specific manner allowing up to one mismatch. We then counted mapped reads for each sample and normalized the abundance of each sgRNA to reads per million (RPM). The RPM of each tumor sample was divided by the control sample RPM to calculate a tumor:control ratio for each sgRNA. 55 CRISPR-induced insertion/deletion detection Genomic DNA from tumors or cells was harvested. sgRNA target sites were PCR amplified and subjected to high throughput genomic DNA sequencing  . We mapped the reads to the reference genomic sequence using BWA version 0.7.5 and SAMtools (version 0.1.19). We then used VarScan2 (version 2.3) to identify insertions and deletions with the ‘pileup2indel’ mode and parameters ‘--min-var-freq’, ‘--min-avg-qual', '--p-value’. The software can be found at:  53 https://zlab.umassmed.edu/CIpipe/ RNA-sequencing and bioinformatics analysis RNA-seq was performed as described  . We first trimmed reads and removed PCR primers using Trimmomatic (v 0.30). We aligned RNA-seq reads to the mm10 genome using STAR (version 2.3.0e) with default parameters and selected only uniquely mapping reads. We removed redundant read pairs using SAMtools (version 0.0.19). For all genes annotated in GENCODE M7, we calculated the number of reads per gene using HTSeq. We then determined differential expression using DESeq (version 1.18.0)  56  and accounted for possible batch effects using a generalized linear model. In order to detect differentially expressed genes, we required the change in expression to be greater than two-fold and the false discovery rate (FDR) to be less than 0.05. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was used to identify pathways enriched among differentially expressed genes. 57 Western blot analysis Protein lysates from culture cells were harvested with RIPA buffer including proteinase and phosphatase inhibitors. Proteins were separated on 4-12% NuPage Bis-Tris gels (Life Technologies, NP0321), transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with antibodies. Blots were imaged using an Odyssey system (LICOR). The following antibodies and dilutions were used: 1:1000 anti-Hmga2 (Biocheck); 1:1000 anti-Sox9 (Millipore); 1:10,000 anti-Hsp90 (BD Biosciences); 1:1000 anti-Ck19 (Troma); 1:1000 anti-pErk (Cell Signaling). Real-time PCR Total RNA was purified using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). First-strand cDNA was synthesized using Superscript (ABI) and used as template in TaqMan real-time PCR assays (Life technologies), according to manufacturer’s instructions. TaqMan probes are: HMGA2 Hs04397751_m1, SOX9 Hs01001343_g1, and ACTB (beta-ACTIN) Hs01060665_g1 (as a control). Patient Survival Analysis Expression array data of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and patient clinical information were obtained from the GEO record  GSE1898  (Lee et al. 2004). The TCGA   human liver cancer dataset was downloaded via Firehose from the Broad Institute Genome Analysis Center ( 29 http://qdac.broadinstitute.org ). The TCGA data comprises patient mRNA expression data (RSEM value, i.e., normalized RNA-seq by Expectation-Maximization) and clinical information. For each dataset, we separated patients into two groups, with high and low expression for each gene of interest. We then performed survival analysis and drew related graphs using the R (version 3.2.2) package ‘survival’. The results here are in whole or part based upon data generated by the TCGA Research Network:  http://cancergenome.nih.gov/ .

PMID:32252413,Genomics of MPNST (GeM) Consortium: Rationale and Study Design for Multi-Omic Characterization of NF1-Associated and Sporadic MPNSTs.,"The Genomics of Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor (GeM) Consortium is an international collaboration focusing on multi-omic analysis of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), the most aggressive tumor associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Here we present a summary of current knowledge gaps, a description of our consortium and the cohort we have assembled, and an overview of our plans for multi-omic analysis of these tumors. We propose that our analysis will lead to a better understanding of the order and timing of genetic events related to MPNST initiation and progression. Our ten institutions have assembled 96 fresh frozen NF1-related (63%) and sporadic MPNST specimens from 86 subjects with corresponding clinical and pathological data. Clinical data have been collected as part of the International MPNST Registry. We will characterize these tumors with bulk whole genome sequencing, RNAseq, and DNA methylation profiling. In addition, we will perform multiregional analysis and temporal sampling, with the same methodologies, on a subset of nine subjects with NF1-related MPNSTs to assess tumor heterogeneity and cancer evolution. Subsequent multi-omic analyses of additional archival specimens will include deep exome sequencing (500×) and high density copy number arrays for both validation of results based on fresh frozen tumors, and to assess further tumor heterogeneity and evolution. Digital pathology images are being collected in a cloud-based platform for consensus review.

PMID:24249802,Functional outcome measures for NF1-associated optic pathway glioma clinical trials.,"OBJECTIVE: The goal of the Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis Visual Outcomes Committee is to define the best functional outcome measures for future neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated optic pathway glioma (OPG) clinical trials. METHODS: The committee considered the components of vision, other ophthalmologic parameters affected by OPG, potential biomarkers of visual function, and quality of life measures to arrive at consensus-based, evidence-driven recommendations for objective and measurable functional endpoints for OPG trials. RESULTS: Visual acuity (VA) assessments using consistent quantitative testing methods are recommended as the main functional outcome measure for NF1-OPG clinical trials. Teller acuity cards are recommended for use as the primary VA endpoint, and HOTV as a secondary endpoint once subjects are old enough to complete it. The optic disc should be assessed for pallor, as this appears to be a contributory variable that may affect the interpretation of VA change over time. Given the importance of capturing patient-reported outcomes in clinical trials, evaluating visual quality of life using the Children's Visual Function Questionnaire as a secondary endpoint is also proposed. CONCLUSIONS: The use of these key functional endpoints will be essential for evaluating the efficacy of future OPG clinical trials.",,Michael J Fisher; Robert A Avery; Jeffrey C Allen; Simone L Ardern-Holmes; Larissa T Bilaniuk; Rosalie E Ferner; David H Gutmann; Robert Listernick; Staci Martin; Nicole J Ullrich; Grant T Liu,Neurology,2013-11-19,10.1212/01.wnl.0000435745.95155.b8,abstract_only,False
PMID:41598414,Dermoscopy-Guided High-Frequency Ultrasound Imaging of Subcentimeter Cutaneous and Subcutaneous Neurofibromas in Patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 1.,,"2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria The inclusion criteria for this study involved obtaining informed consent from participants and confirming the diagnosis of NF1 based on the current criteria published by Legius et al. in 2021 [ 10 ], followed by molecular genetic analysis of the NF1 gene in all patients. Exclusion criteria were uncertain NF1 diagnosis (for example, Legius syndrome), lesions inaccessible for imaging due to body contour (skin folds, acral areas, genital region) or hair-covered areas, and lesions >10 mm due to equipment field-of-view limitations. Acral regions were excluded only in cases when they were practically inaccessible for imaging due to the body contour. In patients presenting with a high number of cutaneous neurofibromas, a predefined number (5–10) of lesions per patient was selected for evaluation. These lesions were randomly selected from clinically eligible neurofibromas, aiming to represent different lesion sizes and anatomical locations. In patients presenting with fewer than 5 neurofibromas, all lesions were evaluated. We assessed only localized cutaneous and subcutaneous neurofibromas. Plexiform, diffuse, and intraneural neurofibromas were not included in the present study. 2.2. DG-HFUS Imaging From April 2023 to June 2024, measurements were performed at the Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Dermatooncology, Semmelweis University, using a portable DG-HFUS device (Dermus SkinScanner, Dermus Ltd., Budapest, Hungary). This system combines dermoscopic and HFUS imaging (33 MHz, range 20–40 MHz) to enhance diagnostic accuracy and reproducibility. The device features a silicone-membrane imaging window, gel coupling, and an optical module for precise lesion localization. Dermoscopic and ultrasound images are displayed side-by-side on a connected smartphone, with a 2-s acquisition time. Dermoscopy provides a 12 × 12 mm 2  field of view (10× magnification), while ultrasound images extend 12 mm laterally and penetrate up to 10 mm. A red line marks the cross-sectional plane, and color coding aids structural visualization (the lowest intensities appear in dark shades, followed by green and blue, while the highest intensities are indicated by red and yellow) [ 41 ]. Recorded images were analyzed in SkinAid cloud software, stored under patient ID with demographic and lesion details. DG-HFUS assessments included size, location, shape, contours, surface, echogenicity, global echogenicity, and posterior acoustic features.

PMID:24595234,In vivo functional analysis of the human NF2 tumor suppressor gene in Drosophila.,"The proper control of tissue growth is essential during normal development and an important problem in human disease. Merlin, the product of the Neurofibromatosis 2 tumor suppressor gene, has been extensively studied to understand its functions in growth control. Here we describe experiments in which we used Drosophila as an in vivo system to test the functions of the normal human NF2 gene products and patient-derived mutant alleles. Although the predominant NF2 gene isoform, isoform 1, could functionally replace the Drosophila Merlin gene, a second isoform with a distinct C-terminal tail could not. Immunofluorescence studies show that the two isoforms have distinct subcellular localizations when expressed in the polarized imaginal epithelium, and function in genetic rescue assays correlates with apical localization of the NF2 protein. Interestingly, we found that a patient-derived missense allele, NF2L64P, appears to be temperature sensitive. These studies highlight the utility of Drosophila for in vivo functional analysis of highly conserved human disease genes.","Materials and Methods 
 NF2  transgenes and genetic rescue experiments Transgenes expressing the indicated  NF2  proteins were cloned with N-terminal Flag epitope tags in the pUASt transformation vector. P-element transformation  [18]  was used to generate multiple stable transgenic lines for each  NF2  allele tested. For genetic rescue tests, at least three independent autosomal insertion lines for each allele were crossed to female flies of the following genotype,  y w Mer , and for each of these lines, a sufficient number of offspring was scored to ensure that the predicted rescue class would number at least 40 flies. Percentage genetic rescue was calculated from the ratio of surviving  4 /FM7; T80-Gal4 y w Mer  hemizygous males over half of the total female offspring, thereby avoiding the semi-lethality associated with the  4 FM7  balancer chromosome in males. The  Mer  chromosome was marked with  4 y  to allow us to distinguish between rescued males (with yellow body color) and males (normal body color) generated by patroclinous  X  chromosome inheritance due to meiotic non-disjunction in FM7 females. Immunofluorescence Tissue dissection, fixation and antibody staining were performed as previously described  [19] . Mouse anti-Flag (Sigma-Aldrich) was used at 1∶20,000 and guinea-pig anti-Merlin  [8]  was used at 1∶5000. Secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were diluted 1∶1000 and tissues were mounted in Prolong Antifade (Molecular Probes). Confocal images were taken on either a Zeiss LSM 410 or LSM 510 microscope using Zeiss acquisition software (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging). Analysis of wing phenotypes The effect of ectopic expression of the  NF2  isoforms under the control of the  apterous-Gal4  driver was examined in adult wings. Wings were prepared by incubating flies in 70% EtOH, rinsing in water, and then mounting the dissected wings in Aquamount (BDH Laboratory Supplies). Wings were imaged under brightfield optics on a Zeiss Axioplan 2ie compound microscope and recorded using a Spot digital camera. Quantitative PCR Total RNA was prepared from 20 wing imaginal discs from larvae of the following genotypes –  ApGal4/+  (control),  ApGal4/P[hNF2  - using Trizol (Invitrogen). cDNA was produced using the Taqman kit (ABI) and quantitative PCR performed using the LightCycler FastStart SYBR green system (Roche).

PMID:40394150,Mass spectrometric insights into the protein composition of human cutaneous neurofibromas: comparison of neurofibromas with the overlying skin.,"BACKGROUND: Cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs) are the hallmark of the tumor-predisposition syndrome neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1). While cNFs are always benign, they markedly decrease quality of life in individuals with NF1. Understanding the differences between cNFs and the skin is essential for developing treatments for cNFs. METHODS: We collected 15 cNFs from four NF1 individuals and used mass spectrometry to compare the tumor tissue with the skin overlying each tumor. Data were analyzed based on Gene Ontology (GO) terms. RESULTS: The expression patterns of the Schwann cell marker S100B and several keratins confirmed successful dissection of cNF tissue from the overlying skin. Hierarchical clustering showed extensive overlap between the tumor and skin samples in three out of four individuals, suggesting high overall similarity between the two tissue types. Based on the analysis of the GO terms, cNFs were associated with decreased expression of proteins related to cell proliferation, extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis and cellular metabolism. CONCLUSION: The cNFs are relatively quiescent, consistent with their benign nature and limited growth potential. The development of pharmacological therapy for cNFs requires overcoming the high similarity between cNFs and the overlying skin. The present dataset can serve as a resource for future research on cNFs.","Methods We collected 15 cNFs from four NF1 individuals and used mass spectrometry to compare the tumor tissue with the skin overlying each tumor. Data were analyzed based on Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Materials and methods Patients and samples The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital District of Southwest Finland, and had a research permit from the Turku University Hospital. The study adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from the participants. The tumor samples were obtained from patients visiting the NF1 clinic operative in Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland. All sample donors fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for NF1 [ 22 ,  42 ]. The cNFs for mass spectrometry were 3–10 mm in diameter, and they were excised using CO 2  laser upon the patient’s initiative. The overlying skin was immediately dissected apart from the cNF, and both tissues were snap frozen and stored at −80 °C. Altogether 15 tumors from one male and three females were included in the study, with 3–5 tumors per patient. Eight tumors from two patients were estimated to be growing based on the report given by the patients, whereas there was no evidence of recent growth for seven tumors. The patients were aged 28–74 years at tumor excision, with a mean age of 48.6 years and a median of 40.7 years. For the validation of the mass spectrometry results, 20 cNFs from seven individuals with NF1 (four males and three females) were excised using CO 2  laser, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded and cut into 3 µm sections for immunohistochemistry. Sample preprocessing Tissue pieces of 2 × 2 × 2 mm were sonicated for five cycles of 30 s on, 30 s off in 50 µL of 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer supplemented with Complete Mini protease inhibitors (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Pressure-based cell lysis was performed for 60 cycles of 50 s at 30 °C and 310 MPa using the Barocycler NEP 2320 instrument (Pressure BioSciences, Easton, MA, USA). The samples were sonicated for five cycles of 30 s on, 30 s off to disrupt DNA. After adding sodium dodecyl sulfate to a final concentration of 5%, the samples were incubated at 95 °C for 5 min and cooled to room temperature. The samples were centrifuged at 17,000 g for 20 min and the non-soluble material was discarded. Protein concentration was determined using the Lowry method, and 50 µg of protein was used for trypsin digestion. For the reduction of the proteins, dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 20 mM, and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The proteins were then alkylated by adding iodoacetamide to a final concentration of 40 mM and incubation at room temperature for 30 min. After acidification with phosphoric acid and addition of the S-Trap binding buffer, the samples were applied to S-Trap micro spin columns (ProtiFi, Farmingdale, NY, USA). After washing, 2 µg of trypsin was added in 20 µL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, and at 47 °C for 1 h. The resulting peptides were eluted from the column using 40 µL of a 1:1 mixture of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer with 0.2% formic acid, and acetonitrile with 0.2% formic acid. The peptides were evaporated to dryness. Mass spectrometry A nanoflow high-performance liquid chromatography system Easy-nLC 1200 coupled to the Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a nano-electrospray ionization source was used for liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-MS/MS analyses. A total 600 ng of peptides were first loaded on a trapping column and subsequently separated inline on a 15-cm C18 column (75 μm × 15 cm, ReproSil-Pur 3 μm 120 Å C18-AQ; Dr. Maisch HPLC GmbH, Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany). The flow rate was 300 nL/min. The mobile phase was solvent A: water with 0.1% formic acid; and solvent B: acetonitrile/water 80:20 (v/v) with 0.1% formic acid. A two-step gradient consisted of 90 min from 5% to 23% of solvent B, followed by 30 min from 23% to 36% of solvent B. Data-independent acquisition (DIA) method was used, and the duty cycle contained one full scan (400–1000 m/z) and 40 MS/MS scans covering the mass range 400–1000 with an isolation window of 15 m/z. The data were acquired automatically using Thermo Xcalibur 4.1 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and processed with the Spectronaut Pulsar software (Biognosys, Schlieren, Switzerland). Pulsar is a search engine, integrated into Spectronaut for spectral library generation. A spectral library containing data from all DIA runs was generated with Pulsar, and proteins from individual samples were then identified by comparison against the generated spectral library. The raw dataset covered 3002 different proteins. Data were normalized before analysis. Data processing To exclude low confidence protein identifications, we required for each protein  P  value <0.05 and identification based on at least two peptides in at least one sample. Application of these criteria led to the inclusion of 2461 proteins in the final dataset. The proportion of missing proteins was 0.9–6.4% per sample. Among the cNF samples, an average of 99.4% of proteins (range 99.2% to 99.6%) were observed in at least one sample of a donor, and 93.0% (range 92.2% to 94.4%) in all samples of a donor. The respective numbers were 99.7% (range 99.3% to 99.9%) and 95.1% (range 91.6% to 97.7%) in the skin samples. Protein identification was based on a median of 5 peptides (range 1 to 454) and a median sequence coverage of 19% (range 0.1% to 100%). Any remaining missing values in the dataset were either missing at random due to random failure to detect the protein, unrelated to the nature of the respective peptides or their measured intensity; or missing not at random because of expression level below the limit of detection [ 43 ]. Since missing values caused by low protein expression are informative, they were imputed with the minimum protein quantity value observed in the dataset. We assumed that a maximum of 20% of observations could be missing at random. If a protein could be quantified in ≥80% of samples of one tissue type (cNF or skin), the detection was considered reliable and any missing values in excess of 20% in the other sample type were assumed to be due to an expression level below the limit of detection and therefore imputed. If the protein was detected in less than 80% of samples in both tissue types, no imputation was performed to avoid imputing missing values caused by protein lability or technical issues. As a result, we may have missed proteins whose expression is low in both skin and cNF, yet these were not of our primary interest, as we aimed to characterize proteins differentially expressed in cNF and skin. Application of this procedure led to the imputation of 472 missing values (0.64% of all measurements; 373 values in cNF samples and 99 values in skin samples) in 119 proteins (4.8%). After the imputation, 99.96% of the 2461 proteins had data in both cNF and skin. A total of 1430 missing values in 499 proteins remained, and these were assumed to be missing at random. Statistical analysis The proteins detected in the samples were linked to Gene Ontology (GO) terms (release 2021-07-02) [ 44 ,  45 ], and the GO terms associated with more than four different proteins in the dataset were analyzed. The analysis focused particularly on the GO terms related to extracellular matrix, angiogenesis and cellular metabolism. The cNF and skin were compared using linear mixed effects regression modeling of the log-transformed protein quantities, and a random intercept for each protein and nested random intercepts for each patient and sample were included. In case of model non-convergence, the models were simplified by first omitting the random intercept for each patient and then, if necessary, the random intercept for each sample. In addition, keratins, collagens and the Schwann cell marker S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B) were analyzed at the level of individual proteins to confirm the successful dissection of the cNF from the overlying skin and to further describe the differences between cNFs and the skin. The single-protein analyses were performed similarly to the analyses of the GO terms, yet the random intercept for each protein was not included. The  P  values were Bonferroni corrected to account for the multiple comparisons. Sensitivity analyses encompassing specific subsets of tumors were used to validate the robustness of the results. Correlations between GO terms were assessed using linear mixed effects regression with a random intercept for each patient. In order to do this, the quantity of each protein related to a specific GO term in each sample was normalized relative to the average quantity of the protein observed over all samples. The normalized protein quantities were averaged over the different proteins to obtain a sample-specific index for each process of interest, and log-transformed values were analyzed. The GO terms for angiogenesis (GO:0001525), cell population proliferation (GO:0008283), and positive regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade (GO:0043410) were correlated with the GO terms for extracellular matrix disassembly (GO:0022617), cellular protein metabolic process (GO:0044267), carbohydrate metabolic process (GO:0005975), and lipid metabolic process (GO:0006629). To describe the overall similarity between cNFs and the skin, protein-level data were visualized as heatmaps and hierarchical clustering was performed using the complete linkage method. All analyses were performed using the R software for statistical computing, version 4.0.0, and package lmerTest, version 3.1-2.  P  values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Immunohistochemistry In order to validate the findings from mass spectrometry, 20 samples were labeled for the cell proliferation marker Ki67 and collagens XV and XVIII. The Ki67 immunohistochemistry was performed using the BenchMark Ultra system (Roche). A 36-min pretreatment with the Cell Conditioning Solution CC1 (Roche) was followed by a 12-min incubation with the CONFIRM anti-Ki67 (clone 30-9) rabbit monoclonal primary antibody (Roche) and detection with the UltraView Universal DAB detection kit (Roche). For collagen XV and XVIII immunostainings, epitope retrieval was performed using a heat-mediated method for 15 min with Tris/EDTA buffer (pH 9), followed by an incubation with polyclonal anti-collagen XV (Sigma-Aldrich, HPA017913, 1:1000) or in-house monoclonal anti-collagen XVIII (ref. [ 46 ], DB144-N2, 7 µg/ml) primary antibody. The labeling was carried out using the peroxidase-based Dako EnVision kit (Agilent Dako, Santa Clara, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For negative controls, the primary antibodies were omitted and replaced with phosphate-buffered saline. All sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and imaged using the NanoZoomer S60 digital slide scanner (Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu City, Japan) and Pannoramic Midi FL slide scanner (3DHistech Ltd, Budapest, Hungary).",Roope A Kallionpää; Eija Martikkala; Pekka Haapaniemi; Sanna-Maria Karppinen; Pilvi Riihilä; Anne Rokka; Ilmo Leivo; Taina Pihlajaniemi; Sirkku Peltonen; Juha Peltonen,British journal of cancer,2025-08,10.1038/s41416-025-03055-9,minimal,True
PMID:21726432,MIA is a potential biomarker for tumour load in neurofibromatosis type 1.,"BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a frequent genetic disease characterized by multiple benign tumours with increased risk for malignancy. There is currently no biomarker for tumour load in NF1 patients. METHODS: In situ hybridization and quantitative real-time polymerase reaction were applied to investigate expression of cartilage-specific genes in mice bearing conditional inactivation of NF1 in the developing limbs. These mice do not develop tumours but recapitulate aspects of NF1 bone dysplasia, including deregulation of cartilage differentiation. It has been recently shown that NF1 tumours require for their growth the master regulator of cartilage differentiation SOX9. We thus hypothesized that some of the cartilage-specific genes deregulated in an Nf1Prx1 mouse model might prove to be relevant biomarkers of NF1 tumours. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing expression of the SOX9 target gene product melanoma-inhibitory activity/cd-rap (MIA) in tumour and serum samples of NF1 patients. RESULTS: Increased expression of Mia was found in Nf1-deficient cartilage in mice. In humans, MIA was expressed in all NF1-related tumours and its serum levels were significantly higher in NF1 patients than in healthy controls. Among NF1 patients, MIA serum levels were significantly higher in those with plexiform neurofibromas and in those with large number of cutaneous (> 1,000) or subcutaneous (> 100) neurofibromas than in patients without such tumours. Most notably, MIA serum levels correlated significantly with internal tumour burden. CONCLUSIONS: MIA is a potential serum biomarker of tumour load in NF1 patients which could be useful in following the disease course and monitoring the efficacy of therapies.","Methods In situ  hybridization and quantitative real-time polymerase reaction were applied to investigate expression of cartilage-specific genes in mice bearing conditional inactivation of NF1 in the developing limbs.

We tested this hypothesis by analyzing expression of the SOX9 target gene product melanoma-inhibitory activity/cd-rap (MIA) in tumour and serum samples of NF1 patients. Methods Mouse breeding and tissue processing The mice were continuously back-crossed to wild-type C57BL/6J to minimize the variation of genetic background. The female Nf1flox mice were crossed to male Nf1flox heterozygous Prx1-Cre-positive males and the offspring genotyped as previously described [ 9 ]. Embryos and postnatal tissue samples were fixed overnight at 4°C in 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated through an ethanol/xylol series, and embedded in paraffin blocks. Six-micrometer sections were cut and processed for haematoxylin and eosin/Alcian blue staining and  in situ  hybridization. Patients and samples The study was conducted with a cohort of 42 NF1 patients and 22 healthy individuals. The diagnosis of NF1 was made using National Institutes of Health criteria. The study protocol was approved by the local institutional review board, and all patients gave their informed consent. Cutaneous and subcutaneous tumours were counted or estimated in case the number was larger than 100. Plexiform neurofibromas, including internal ones, were detected by means of whole-body MRI in 30 of the 42 patients. Because of the limited resolution of whole-body MRI, lesions smaller than 3 cm in the longest diameter, which is often the case for spinal tumours, were not included. Tumour sizes were calculated using a semiautomated volumetric method, and the total internal tumour load was obtained subsequently, including PNs (Plexiform Neurofibromas), spinal tumours and internal nodule neurofibromas, but excluding cutaneous and subcutaneous tumours [ 19 ]. An age effect for cutaneous, subcutaneous and internal tumours was examined using a nonparametric Spearman's rank-correlation test. All serum samples were prepared using a standardized protocol in the laboratory of the Department of Maxillofacial Surgery at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf. Whole blood of each patient was kept at room temperature for 30 minutes before being spun down at 4,500 rpm for 10 minutes using a benchtop centrifuge. The supernatant was stored at -80°C in 100-μL aliquots. In situ  hybridization In situ  hybridization was performed on paraffin sections according to standard protocol [ 9 ]. Images were collected using a DMR HC microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with an AxioCam HRc camera (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) and evaluated using AxioVision 4.1 software (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Immunohistochemical detection of MIA Sections of six cutaneous and three plexiform neurofibromas, as well as seven MPNSTs, from a total of sixteen NF1 patients were stained with monoclonal anti-human MIA antibody (R&D Systems, McKinley Place NE, Minneapolis) diluted at 1:40. Sections were boiled in citrate buffer (pH 6.1) for antigen retrieval. The streptavidin-biotin method was performed using an automated staining system TechMate (Dako, Hamburg, Germany) with an implemented counterstaining. Negative controls were carried out with normal serum without the primary antibody or with antibody preincubated in access (25 ng/μl) of recombinant human MIA (Peprotech GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). Stained sections were analyzed using the BX51 microscope (Olimpus, Hamburg, Germany) and analySIS 5.0 software (Soft imaging system GmbH, Münster, Germany). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction RNA was isolated from the knee cartilage of two wild-type and two Nf1Prx1 mice using peqGOLD TriFast (PeqLab Biotechnologie GmbH, Erlangen, Germany) according to the supplied protocol. cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA with MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix was then performed on an ABI PRISM 7900 Cycler (Applied Biosystems) using the SYBR Green method (Invitrogen, Darmstad, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The expression level of  Mia  was determined in Nf1Prx1 and wild-type tissues and was equilibrated against expression of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ). The following primers were used: mGAPDH: 5' GGGAAGCCCATCACCATCTT 3', 5' CGGCCTCACCCCATTTG 3'; mMIA: 5' GGAGGACCTGACTCTGAAACC 3'; 5' ACTGCAGGGATAGCGGTAG 3'. Mia elisa The MIA ELISA kit was purchased from (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and the measurements were conducted in duplicate according to the supplied protocol.

PMID:23124644,Anatomic MR imaging and functional diffusion tensor imaging of peripheral nerve tumors and tumorlike conditions.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A number of benign and malignant peripheral nerve tumor and tumorlike conditions produce similar imaging features on conventional anatomic MR imaging. Functional MR imaging using DTI can increment the diagnostic performance in differentiation of these lesions. Our aim was to evaluate the role of 3T anatomic MR imaging and DTI in the characterization of peripheral nerve tumor and tumorlike conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients (13 men, 16 women; mean age, 41±18 years; range, 11-83 years) with a nerve tumor or tumorlike condition (25 benign, 5 malignant) underwent 3T MR imaging by using anatomic (n=29), functional diffusion, DWI (n=21), and DTI (n=24) techniques. Images were evaluated for image quality (3-point scale), ADC of the lesion, tractography, and fractional anisotropy of nerves with interobserver reliability in ADC and FA measurements. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in age (benign, 40±18 versus malignant, 45±19 years) and sex (benign, male/female=12:12 versus malignant, male/female=3:2) (P>.05). All anatomic (29/29, 100%) MR imaging studies received ""good"" quality; 20/21 (95%) DWI and 21/24 (79%) DTI studies received ""good"" quality. ADC of benign lesions (1.848±0.40×10(-3) mm2/s) differed from that of malignant lesions (0.900±0.25×10(-3) mm2/s, P<.001) with excellent interobserver reliability (ICC=0.988 [95% CI, 0.976-0.994]). There were no FA or ADC differences between men and women (P>.05). FA of involved nerves was lower than that in contralateral healthy nerves (P<.001) with excellent interobserver reliability (ICC=0.970 [95% CI, 0.946-0.991]). ADC on DTI and DWI was not statistically different (P>.05), with excellent intermethod reliability (ICC=0.943 [95% CI, 0.836-0.980]). Tractography differences were observed in benign and malignant lesions. CONCLUSIONS: 3T MR imaging and DTI are valuable methods for anatomic and functional evaluation of peripheral nerve lesions with excellent interobserver reliability. While tractography and low FA provide insight into neural integrity, low diffusivity values indicate malignancy in neural masses.",,A Chhabra; R S Thakkar; G Andreisek; M Chalian; A J Belzberg; J Blakeley; A Hoke; G K Thawait; J Eng; J A Carrino,AJNR.

PMID:17053831,Hyperactivation of p21ras and PI3K cooperate to alter murine and human neurofibromatosis type 1-haploinsufficient osteoclast functions.,"Individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) have a high incidence of osteoporosis and osteopenia. However, understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of these sequelae is incomplete. Osteoclasts are specialized myeloid cells that are the principal bone-resorbing cells of the skeleton. We found that Nf1(+/-) mice contain elevated numbers of multinucleated osteoclasts. Both osteoclasts and osteoclast progenitors from Nf1(+/-) mice were hyperresponsive to limiting concentrations of M-CSF and receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) levels. M-CSF-stimulated p21(ras)-GTP and Akt phosphorylation was elevated in Nf1(+/-) osteoclasts associated with gains of function in survival, proliferation, migration, adhesion, and lytic activity. These gains of function are associated with more severe bone loss following ovariectomy as compared with that in syngeneic WT mice. Intercrossing Nf1(+/-) mice and mice deficient in class 1(A) PI3K (p85alpha) restored elevated PI3K activity and Nf1(+/-) osteoclast functions to WT levels. Furthermore, in vitro-differentiated osteoclasts from NF1 patients also displayed elevated Ras/PI3K activity and increased lytic activity analogous to those in murine Nf1(+/-) osteoclasts. Collectively, our results identify a what we believe to be a novel cellular and biochemical NF1-haploinsufficient phenotype in osteoclasts that has potential implications for the pathogenesis of NF1 bone disease.",,Feng-Chun Yang; Shi Chen; Alexander G Robling; Xijie Yu; Todd D Nebesio; Jincheng Yan; Trent Morgan; Xiaohong Li; Jin Yuan; Janet Hock; David A Ingram; D Wade Clapp,The Journal of clinical investigation,2006-11,10.1172/JCI29092,abstract_only,False
PMID:19191334,Microarray analyses reveal regional astrocyte heterogeneity with implications for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-regulated glial proliferation.,"Numerous studies have suggested that astrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) exhibit molecular and functional heterogeneity. In this regard, astroglia from different CNS locations express distinct immune system, and neurotransmitter proteins, have varying levels of gap junction coupling and respond differently to injury. However, the relevance of these differences to human disease is unclear. As brain tumors in children arise in specific CNS locations, we hypothesized that regional astroglial cell heterogeneity might partly underlie the propensity for gliomas to arise in these areas. In this study, we performed high-density RNA microarray profiling on astrocytes from postnatal day 1 optic nerve, cerebellum, brainstem, and neocortex. We showed that astroglia from each region are molecularly distinct, and we were able to develop gene expression patterns that distinguish astroglia, but not neural stem cells, from these different brain regions. We next used these microarray data to determine whether brain tumor suppressor genes were differentially expressed in these distinct populations of astroglia. Interestingly, neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene expression was decreased at both the RNA and protein levels in neocortical astroglia relative to astroglia from the other brain regions. To determine the functional significance of this finding, we found increased astroglial cell proliferation in optic nerve, brainstem, and cerebellum, but not neocortex, following Nf1 inactivation in vitro and in vivo. These findings provide molecular evidence for CNS astroglial cell heterogeneity, and suggest that differences in tumor suppressor gene expression might contribute to the regional localization of human brain tumors.","Materials and Methods Mice Nf1 flox /  ( flox Zhu et al. 2001 ) and  Nf1 GFAP CKO ( Bajenaru et al. 2002 ) mice were generated as previously described and maintained on a C57Bl/6 background. All mice were used in accordance with approved Animal Studies Protocols. Primary astroglial cultures Murine astroglial cultures were generated from postnatal day 1 or 2 wild-type or  Nf1 flox /  pups as previously described ( flox Sandsmark et al. 2007 ). Briefly, fronto-parietal lobe neocortex (CTX), cerebellar hemispheres (CB) and medulla (brainstem; BS) were isolated, enzymatically digested in 0.05% trypsin for 20 min, and maintained in astrocyte growth medium (DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics). For optic nerve (ON) astroglial cell cultures, each nerve was minced and the resulting cells grown in 6-well plate for 5–7 days prior to seeding in culture flasks containing astrocyte growth medium. The  Nf1  gene was inactivated in passage 1  Nf1 flox /  astrocytes by infection with adenovirus (Ad5) containing Cre recombinase (University of Iowa Gene Transfer Vector Core, Iowa City, IA). Control  flox Nf1 flox /  astrocytes (wild-type) were treated identically with an adenovirus encoding LacZ. Four days after Cre adenovirus treatment, neurofibromin expression was examined by Western blot. In all cases, neurofibromin expression was absent in astroglial cells infected with Ad5-Cre compared to those infected with Ad5-LacZ (data not shown). At least two to three pups were pooled for each culture. flox Neural stem cell cultures As above, CTX, CB and BS were removed from postnatal day 1 (PN1) wild-type mice and processed to obtain single-cell suspension of neural progenitors (neurospheres). Neurospheres were maintained in NSC medium on UltraLow plates (Fisher, St. Louis, MO) as previously described ( Dasgupta and Gutmann 2005 ). RNA isolation and microarray analysis Total RNA was extracted from primary cultured astrocytes from CTX, CB, BS, and ON using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA samples were quantified and RNA integrity was analyzed following the manufacturer’s recommendations (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Target preparation and microarray hybridization were performed by the Siteman Cancer Center Multiplex Gene Analysis Core Facility using Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 GeneChip microarrays. Basic microarray data visualization and data filtering were accomplished as previously described ( Sharma et al. 2007 ). Fold change was calculated by dividing the average values of one region by the average values of the other regions for each probe set. Statistical significance was determined with Student’s  t  test using Spotfire DecisionSite for Functional Genomics (TIBCO Spotfire, Somerville, MA). The  P  values obtained with Student’s  t  test were corrected for multiple testing by the Benjamini-Hochberg method ( Benjamini and Hochberg 1995 ). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed on samples from four brain regions using the following methods: (a) clustering method: unweighted pair group method using arithmetic average (UPGMA), similarity measure: Euclidean distance; (b) clustering method: UPGMA, similarity measure: correlation. Probe sets that were absent across all chips and the Affymetrix control probe sets were filtered from the analysis. Selection of probe sets whose signals were significantly different between one region and another were prioritized for further study by the statistical test and the fold change. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR The expression of specific genes was examined by real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using SYBR Green detection chemistry. Two micrograms of total RNA extracted from each of the samples were used tomake cDNA. Forty nanograms of cDNA were used as template for PCR amplification with primers specific for each of the transcripts examined ( Supplemental Table S1 ). PCR reactions without cDNA samples were used as negative controls. Each reaction was performed in duplicate. SDS system software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was used to convert the fluorescent data into cycle threshold ( C T ) measurements, and the ΔΔ C T  method ( Livak and Schmittgen 2001 ) was used to calculate fold expression, using β-actin as an internal control. For each gene, at least three independent astrocyte cultures, NSC cultures, or brain region specimens were used. Cell proliferation 50,000 astrocytes were plated in 24-well dishes, allowed to adhere, and maintained in serum-free DMEM for 24 h before exposure to [ 3 H]-thymidine (1 μCi/μL) for 20 h. [ 3 H]thymidine incorporation was determined by scintillation counting as previously described ( Sandsmark et al. 2007 ). Each experiment was performed at least three times using independently-generated astroglial cell cultures. Immunocytochemistry Immunofluorescence staining was performed using the following primary antibodies: GFAP (Sigma; St. Louis, MO), AQP4, NG2, O4, LHX2 (Chemicon International; Temecula, CA), APC (Calbiochem; San Diego, CA), FOXG1, FOXP2 (Abcam; Cambridge, MA), HOXB3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Santa Cruz, CA), and GLAST (a gift from Dr. Watanabe; ( Shibata et al. 1997 )). Visualization was accomplished after incubation with either Alexa Fluor 488 or 568 secondary antibodies (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR) using an inverted Eclipse TE300 (Nikon) microscope equipped with an optical camera (Optronics). Cells were counterstained with DAPI. Quantification was performed by counting the number of immunopositive cells as a percentage of the total number of DAPI-stained nuclei in at least five randomly selected fields (>100 cells) in three independently-isolated cultures. Immunohistochemistry Immunohistochemical staining was performed using GFAP (Zymed, San Francisco, CA) or Ki-67 (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) antibodies followed by Vectastain ABC development (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). GFAP-positive and Ki-67(MIB-1)-immunoreactive cells were quantified by direct counting of representative matched areas from each brain region at 20x objective magnification as previously described ( Hegedus et al., 2008 ). For NG2 immunofluorescence staining, the pixel intensity was determined using image analysis software MetaMorph (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA), and the relative intensity calculated using the logarithm of the index value (optic nerve fluorescence signal value/background value). At least four mice were used for each experiment. Western blot analysis Astrocytes were serum-starved overnight, harvested by scraping in ice-cold PBS, and lysed in NP40 lysis buffer with protease inhibitors. Western blotting was performed as previously described ( Dasgupta and Gutmann, 2005 ). Rabbit anti-NF1GRP-D (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was used at a 1:200 dilution to detect neurofibromin expression. Detection was accomplished by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, Pittsburgh, PA). α-tubulin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was employed for normalization and densitometric analysis using Gel-Pro Analyzer 4.0 (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD). Statistical analyses Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 4.0 software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). Student’s two-tailed  t -test was used with significance set at  P <0.05. All  in vitro  experiments were performed at least three times with similar results.",Tu-Hsueh Yeh; Da Yong Lee; Scott M Gianino; David H Gutmann,Glia,2009-08-15,10.1002/glia.20845,minimal,True
PMID:29402968,Integrating Functional Analysis in the Next-Generation Sequencing Diagnostic Pipeline of RASopathies.,"RASopathies are a group of heterogeneous conditions caused by germline mutations in RAS/MAPK signalling pathway genes. With next-generation sequencing (NGS), sequencing capacity is no longer a limitation to molecular diagnosis. Instead, the rising number of variants of unknown significance (VUSs) poses challenges to clinical interpretation and genetic counselling. We investigated the potential of an integrated pipeline combining NGS and the functional assessment of variants for the diagnosis of RASopathies. We included 63 Chinese patients with RASopathies that had previously tested negative for PTPN11 and HRAS mutations. In these patients, we performed a genetic analysis of genes associated with RASopathies using a multigene NGS panel and Sanger sequencing. For the VUSs, we evaluated evidence from genetic, bioinformatic and functional data. Twenty disease-causing mutations were identified in the 63 patients, providing a primary diagnostic yield of 31.7%. Four VUSs were identified in five patients. The functional assessment supported the pathogenicity of the RAF1 and RIT1 VUSs, while the significance of two VUSs in A2ML1 remained unclear. In summary, functional analysis improved the diagnostic yield from 31.7% to 36.5%. Although technically demanding and time-consuming, a functional genetic diagnostic analysis can ease the clinical translation of these findings to aid bedside interpretation.","Materials and Methods Patient recruitment This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong/ Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster (HKU/HA HKW IRB). Sixty-three Chinese patients presenting with clinical suspicion of RASopathies were recruited from the Clinical Genetics Service, Department of Health, Hong Kong, and Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, the University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong. These subjects were evaluated by clinical geneticists from the two centres. Because  PTPN11  and  HRAS  sequencing were available at these clinics, all 63 subjects were tested and were negative for mutations in these two genes. Informed consent was obtained from the parents and/or patients for the participation, and publication of identifying images in this study. Next generation sequencing Genomic DNA was extracted from patient peripheral blood using standard protocols. We designed a gene enrichment panel for 13 genes known to cause RASopathies in 2013, which included  A2ML1  ( NM_144670.4 ) , BRAF  ( NM_004333.4 ) , CBL  ( NM_005188.3 ) , HRAS  ( NM_005343.3 ) , KRAS  ( NM_004985.3 ) , MAP2K1  ( NM_002755.3 ) , MAP2K2  ( NM_030662.3 ) , NRAS  ( NM_002524.4 ) , PTPN11  ( NM_002834.3 ) , RAF1  ( NM_002880.3 ) , SHOC2  ( NM_007373.3 ),  SOS1  ( NM_005633.3 ), and  SPRED1  ( NM_152594.2 ). The panel covered the coding exons (flanked by ±25 bp) of these 13 selected genes (suppl. Figure 1). The size of the final target region was 101.38 kbp with 97.99% coverage of the target region. Target sequencing was performed using the Haloplex custom target enrichment system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) on the MiSeq sequencing platform with the MiSeq reagent kit V2. The average read depth in the regions of interest was >500×, and over 98% of the covered region had a sequencing depth of at least 30× . The data were analysed using NextGENe software v.2.3.4.1 (Softgenetics, PA, USA) with the default settings. Regions with low coverage (<20× read depth) were re-sequenced by Sanger sequencing. Genetic variant pathogenicity was assessed according to the guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants suggested by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) . Disease-causing mutations were Sanger validated. During the study period,  10 RIT1  ( NM_006912.4 ) was identified as a new causative gene for Noonan syndrome . We subsequently designed primers and sequenced the five coding exons of  17 RIT1 . Functional analysis Genetic variants classified as VUSs were selected for functional characterization. The VUSs were  RAF1 : NM_002880.2 :c.1173 G > C:p.(R391S),  A2ML1 : NM_144670.4 :c.256 C > T:p.(P86S),  A2ML1 : NM_144670.4 :c.4261 C > T:p.(Q1421X) and  RIT1 : NM_006912.4 :c.259 G > C:p.(D87H). Expression plasmids for  RAF1  (#RC201983),  A2ML1  (#RC219615) and  RIT1  (#RC220552) were ordered from Origene (MD, USA). We introduced a single-base substitution into the corresponding expression vector using Q5® Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (NEB, UK). The  RAF1 ,  A2ML1  and  RIT1  coding sequences were validated using Sanger sequencing before subsequent analysis. In vitro  dual luciferase reporter assay To evaluate the molecular effect of the VUSs identified in the cohort, mutant transcripts were expressed in HEK-293T cells. The phosphorylation level of ELK1, which is a downstream substrate of the RAS/MAPK pathway, was measured as a reporter of pathway activity . HEK-293T cells were cultured in DMEM and transfected with expression plasmids using Genejuice transfection reagent (EMD Chemicals, NJ, USA). We introduced pGal-LUC (Clontech), pGal-ELK1 and the expression plasmids into HEK-293T cells. The expression plasmids included the mutant constructs of  17 , 35 RAF1 ,  A2ML1  and  RIT1 , or the corresponding wild-type gene vectors for comparison. In each experimental setup, an empty vector was used as the negative control, while a HRAS expression plasmid with p.Q61L mutation was used as a positive control . The cells were harvested 48 hours post-transfection. The luciferase activity was measured using a Dual-Luciferase® Reporter assay system (Promega, WI, USA). Transfection efficiencies were normalised to the control plasmid, which was pSV-RLuc (Promega, WI, USA) expressing  36 Renilla  luciferase. The expression of the DDK-tagged transcript was validated by Western blot using anti-DDK antibodies. In vivo  transient expression in zebrafish embryos To assess the effect of the VUSs on organismal phenotypes, zebrafish were used according to the methods previously described in experiments assessing gene level evidence . Briefly, the in-frame coding sequence of  9 – 11 RAF1 ,  A2ML1  and  RIT1  were subcloned into the pCMV6-AC-GFP vector such that the GFP coding sequence was fused in-frame to the 3′ end of the inserted gene. GFP-tagged RNA transcripts were synthesised using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). RNA transcripts were injected into zebrafish embryos at the single-cell stage. GFP signals in the zebrafish embryos indicated synthetic RNA expression and served as a positive selection marker for morphometric assessment. Phenotypic observation was performed 3 days post-fertilization (dpf), as previously described . The embryos were anesthetised with tricane methanesulfonate and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), and their general body structure and the development of craniofacial and cardiac structure were assessed. Cartilage was stained with 0.1% Alcian Blue in acidic ethanol. The width and length of the cranio-cartilage were measured using ImageJ software. The ratio of the width of the ceratohyal to the tip of Meckel’s cartilage was determined as a measure of craniofacial defects. For cardiac defects, PFA fixed embryos were probed with digoxigenin-labelled  18 cmlc1 , which is a cardiac development marker for zebrafish, by  in situ  hybridization. Total protein from zebrafish embryos was also extracted to examine the correlation between the zebrafish phenotypes and the activation of RAS signals. The study was approved by the Committee of the Use of Live Animals for Teaching and Research in The University of Hong Kong.

PMID:27527646,Neurocognitive outcomes in neurofibromatosis clinical trials: Recommendations for the domain of attention.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is associated with neurocognitive deficits that can impact everyday functioning of children, adolescents, and adults with this disease. However, there is little agreement regarding measures to use as cognitive endpoints in clinical trials. This article describes the work of the Neurocognitive Committee of the Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) International Collaboration. The goal of this committee is to identify standardized and specific cognitive assessment tools for use in NF clinical trials. The committee first identified cognitive domains relevant to NF1 and prioritized attention as the first domain of focus given prior and current trends in NF1 cognitive clinical trials. Performance measures and behavioral rating questionnaires of attention were reviewed by the group using established criteria to assess patient characteristics, psychometric properties, and feasibility. The highest rated tests underwent side-by-side comparison. The Digit Span subtest from the Wechsler scales was given the highest ratings of the performance measures due to its good psychometrics, feasibility, utility across a wide age range, and extensive use in previous research. The Conners scales achieved the highest ratings of the behavioral questionnaires for similar reasons. Future articles will focus on other cognitive domains, with the ultimate goal of achieving agreement for cognitive endpoints that can be used across NF clinical trials.",,Karin S Walsh; Jennifer Janusz; Pamela L Wolters; Staci Martin; Bonita P Klein-Tasman; Mary Anne Toledo-Tamula; Heather L Thompson; Jonathan M Payne; Kristina K Hardy; Peter de Blank; Claire Semerjian; Laura Schaffner Gray; Sondra E Solomon; Nicole Ullrich,Neurology,2016-08-16,10.1212/WNL.0000000000002928,abstract_only,False

Plasmids containing the open reading frames for Epb4.1l3 and Rassf8 from the Human ORFeome V1 were purchased from the DNASU Plasmid Repository at the Arizona State University. pRL-TK was purchased from Promega. The Tet-inducible plasmids, pTRE3G-BI-ZsGreen and pCMV-Tet3G, were purchased from Tanaka Holdings. Cloning Dox-inducible expression plasmids expressing BirA R118G  fusion proteins were generated using standard restriction enzyme-based cloning techniques. Expression vectors for RFP, GFP, and luciferase were fused to StrepTag II in-frame either N-terminal or C-terminal to the RFP, GFP, or NLuc to facilitate affinity purification. Plasmids expressing test proteins and Merlin probes were assembled from high-fidelity polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragments (Tanaka Holdings) using Gibson assembly (InFusion, Tanaka Holdings). All cloning operations were confirmed by sequencing. Mass spectrometry Dox-inducible cell populations were generated by cotransfecting the pTRE3G-inducible expression plasmid with the pCMV-Tet3G regulatory plasmid into Merlin-null Schwann cells. G418-resistant colonies were pooled, expanded, induced Dox, and sorted for the brightest 10% green fluorescence of the population (Beckman Coulter MoFlo XDP). Cells were grown to confluence in two Falcon five-tiered flasks (872 cm 2 ), induced with Dox in the presence of D-biotin, and incubated for 48 hours. Cells were then trypsinized, washed in cold PBS, and pelleted and lysed in 5 ml of radioimmunoprecipitation assay supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (HALT, Pierce) and benzonase (Sigma-Aldrich). Biotinylated proteins were isolated as described by Roux  et al.  ( 109 ), using 250 μl of streptavidin magnetic beads (Streptavidin Dynabeads, Life Technologies), eluted in 50 μl of 1× Laemmli sample incubated at 95°C for 20 min. Samples were run on a 7.5% SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (Bio-Rad), stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue (Life Technologies), excised and sent to the Taplin Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility at Harvard Medical School, and processed for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectroscopy. Mass spectroscopy experiments were performed in triplicate. Peptides that mapped to endogenous biotinylated proteins were used as an internal control to normalize replicates. Simple descriptive statistics were used to evaluate the data. Proteins were considered positive if they averaged at least five mapped peptides and were at least twofold plus an SD above the BirA R118G –A-fos-negative control. GO analysis was performed using g:Profiler ( 110 ). Venn diagrams were generated using BioVenn ( 111 ). Proximity maps were generated using PathVisio software ( 112 ). Interaction assays HEK 293T cells were cotransfected with RFP-target and Merlin-NLuc plasmids, lysed in 0.5 ml of 20 mM tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 0.15 M NaCl [tris-buffered saline (TBS)] and 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0.5% NP-40, 1× HALT protease inhibitor mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and 2.5 U benzonase (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Lysates were diluted 1:2.5 with TBS (pH 7.4) and 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST), and then, NLuc activity was measured using Nano-Glo reagent (Promega, Madison, WI). RFP or GFP fusion proteins were immuno-precipitated using RFP-Trap_MA or GFP-Trap_MA (ChromoTek, Hauppauge, NY), recovered using a magnetic stand, and washed four times with TBST. The beads were transferred to the wells of a white 96-well plate. NLuc luciferase activity was measured on a FlexStation 3 (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA). Immunoprecipitation-associated luciferase was normalized to the activity in the lysates. RFP-Trap_MA beads were recovered, rinsed in TBS, resuspended in 1× Instant-Bands loading dye (EZBiolab, Indianapolis, IN), boiled for 10 min, and run on a 4 to 20% tris-glycine SDS-PAGE gel. Direct binding assays To purify Merlin-NLuc probes, 5 × 10 6  HEK 293T cells were plated into each of two 15-cm dishes and then transfected with 50 μg of pMerlin-NLuc-StrepTag plasmid per plate using polyethylenimine (PEI) using a 3:1 PEI-to-DNA ratio. Cells were harvested in 0.5 ml of TBS (pH 7.4), 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1% CHAPS plus HALT protease inhibitor mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 2.5 U benzonase (Sigma-Aldrich), and cleared lysates were concentrated using Amicon-10 spin concentrators. Washed magnetic Strep-Tactin beads (100 μl; MagStrep type3 XT, IBA Life Sciences) were added and incubated overnight at 4°C with agitation. Beads were recovered by magnet, washed three times each with high-salt buffer [20 mM tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 0.5 M NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.5 mM EDTA], low-salt buffer [20 mM tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% NP-40, and 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.5 mM EDTA], and an isotonic buffer [20 mM tris-Cl (pH 8.0),150 mM NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.5 mM EDTA], and then eluted in 200 μl of 50 mM D-biotin in TBS. Protein concentration and purity of an aliquot was evaluated by 4 to 20% SDS-PAGE against a standard curve of bovine serum albumin (BSA) stained with Instant-Bands fluorescent total protein stain and visualized on an Azure c600 imaging system. For small-scale affinity purification, RFP-bait expressing plasmid was transfected into HEK 293T cells, lysed as described above then affinity purified with RFP-Trap_MA beads, washed as described above, and resuspended in TBST. The bead solution was split; half was evaluated for concentration and purity as described above. The remaining half of the beads was resuspended in a 30-μl reaction mix containing TBST and BSA (0.5 mg/ml) and 30 to 50 nM Merlin-NLuc protein and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Then, RFP-Bait bound beads were then recovered, washed four times with TBST, and NLuc luciferase activity was measured as described above.",Robert F Hennigan; Jonathan S Fletcher; Steven Guard; Nancy Ratner,Science signaling,2019-04-23,10.1126/scisignal.aau8749,minimal,True
PMID:11080503,Neurofibromin GTPase-activating protein-related domains restore normal growth in Nf1-/- cells.,"Members of the Ras superfamily of signaling proteins modulate fundamental cellular processes by cycling between an active GTP-bound conformation and an inactive GDP-bound form. Neurofibromin, the protein product of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene, and p120GAP are GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for p21(Ras) (Ras) and negatively regulate output by accelerating GTP hydrolysis on Ras. Neurofibromin and p120GAP differ markedly outside of their conserved GAP-related domains (GRDs), and it is therefore unknown if the respective GRDs contribute functional specificity. To address this question, we expressed the GRDs of neurofibromin and p120GAP in primary cells from Nf1 mutant mice in vitro and in vivo. Here we show that expression of neurofibromin GRD, but not the p120GAP GRD, restores normal growth and cytokine signaling in three lineages of primary Nf1-deficient cells that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Furthermore, utilizing a GAP-inactive mutant NF1 GRD identified in a family with NF1, we demonstrate that growth restoration is a function of NF1 GRD GAP activity on p21(Ras). Thus, the GRDs of neurofibromin and p120GAP specify nonoverlapping functions in multiple primary cell types.",,K K Hiatt; D A Ingram; Y Zhang; G Bollag; D W Clapp,The Journal of biological chemistry,2001-03-09,10.1074/jbc.M009202200,abstract_only,False
PMID:24249806,Patient-reported outcomes in neurofibromatosis and schwannomatosis clinical trials.,"OBJECTIVES: Neurofibromatosis (NF) is a genetic disease with multiple clinical manifestations that can significantly impact quality of life (QOL). Clinical trials should include patient-reported outcomes (PROs) as endpoints to assess treatment effects on various aspects of QOL, but there is no consensus on the selection and use of such measures in NF. This article describes the PRO Working Group of the Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) Collaboration, its main goals, methods for identifying appropriate PRO measures for NF clinical trials, and recommendations for assessing pain intensity. METHODS: The REiNS PRO group selected core endpoint domains important to assess in NF. The members developed criteria to rate PRO measures, including patient characteristics, psychometric properties, and feasibility, and utilized a systematic process to evaluate PROs for NF clinical trials. Within the subdomain of pain intensity, the group reviewed the Numerical Rating Scale-11 (NRS-11), the Visual Analogue Scale, and the Faces Pain Scale-Revised using this process. RESULTS: Based on the review criteria, each of these pain intensity scales is brief, reliable, valid, and widely used. However, the NRS-11 was given the highest rating for use in NF clinical trials due to recommendations from pain experts and other consensus groups, its extensive use in research, strong psychometric data including sensitivity to change, and excellent feasibility in ages ≥ 8 years. CONCLUSIONS: The systematic review criteria and process are effective for identifying appropriate PRO measures and provide information utilized by the REiNS Collaboration to achieve consensus regarding PROs in NF clinical trials.",,Pamela L Wolters; Staci Martin; Vanessa L Merker; Kathy L Gardner; Cynthia M Hingtgen; James H Tonsgard; Elizabeth K Schorry; Andrea Baldwin,Neurology,2013-11-19,10.1212/01.wnl.0000435747.02780.bf,abstract_only,False
PMID:40225167,Functional Assays Combined with Pre-mRNA-Splicing Analysis Improve Variant Classification and Diagnostics for Individuals with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 and Legius Syndrome.,Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and Legius syndrome (LS) are caused by inactivating variants in ,"2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Editorial Policies and Ethical Considerations Informed consent was provided by all subjects, as required by the institutional review board of the Erasmus Medical Center, and according to standard diagnostic protocols. 2.2. Patient Assessment and Selection of Variants for Testing The Erasmus MC Department of Clinical Genetics NF1/LS cohort consists of >4900 index cases suspected of NF1 or LS based on the international clinical diagnostic criteria [ 25 ] for whom DNA has been submitted for genetic testing of  NF1  and/or  SPRED1 . Variants were classified using the available clinical and genetic data resulting in the identification of >2267 pathogenic or likely pathogenic  NF1  or  SPRED1  variants and >370 VUS ([ 18 ]; unpublished data). Variants were selected for functional testing following requests received from the consultant clinical geneticist. Splice site prediction software (Alamut Visual Plus, version 1.5.1; Sophia Genetics) was used to identify variants likely to affect pre-mRNA splicing and the assay method was determined by the availability of patient RNA and/or the complexity of the predicted/observed splice abnormalities. In cases where a nonsynonymous variant was predicted to disrupt splicing, we first analyzed the putative effects on mRNA synthesis prior to deciding whether to investigate effects on protein function. For assay validation, additional variants, either from our own cohort or from literature, were selected for comparison, as detailed in Supplementary Tables  S1-S3 . We tested 11 variants that have been classified as pathogenic and/or subjected to functional evaluation:  NM_000267.3 (NF1) p.Leu90Pro [ 26 ], p.Met992del [ 17 ,  27 ], p.Met1149Val [ 17 ], p.Asp1217Tyr [ 14 ], p.Arg1276Gly [ 28 ], p.Lys1423Glu [ 17 ,  23 ,  29 ], p.Asp1623Gly [ 17 ], and p.Arg1809Cys [ 17 ];  NM_152594.2 (SPRED1) p.Val44Asp, p.Thr102Met [ 14 ], and p.Ser105Ala [ 16 ]. In addition, we tested 3 likely benign variants from our cohort: p.Asn1229Ser, p.Pro1232Ser, and Ile1478Val. These variants were identified in individuals for whom another pathogenic, germ-line  NF1  variant, was identified (data not shown). Nomenclature for all the reported variants is according to HGVS guidelines [ 30 ]. 2.3. Constructs, Antibodies, and Cell-Lines 
 NF1  minigene exon trap constructs and NF expression plasmids were generated using standard cloning techniques [ 31 ], Gibson assembly [ 32 ], and/or site-directed mutagenesis (see Supplementary Materials for details). All constructs were verified by sequencing of the complete insert and at least 2 independent, verified clones per variant were used to prepare separate plasmid DNA stocks for the functional experiments. Nucleotide and amino acid numbering are according to reference transcripts  NM_000267.3 (NF1) and  NM_152594.2 (SPRED1), unless specified otherwise. Antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, U.S.A.) (rabbit anti-HA; mouse anti-HA; 9B11 mouse anti-myc), Invitrogen (mouse anti-V5), Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, U.S.A.) (mouse and rabbit anti-FLAG), and LI-COR Biosciences (Lincoln, U.S.A.) (goat anti-rabbit 680 nm and goat anti-mouse 800 nm conjugates). Anti-FLAG affinity beads were from Sigma-Aldrich; glutathione-sepharose was from GE Healthcare (Uppsala, Sweden). HEK 293 T and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Lonza, Verviers, Belgium) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 50 U/ml penicillin and 50  μ g/ml streptomycin in a humidified 37°C, 5-10% CO 2  incubator. 2.4. Assessment of the Effects of NF1 Variants on NF1 Pre-mRNA Splicing in Patient Material Reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR was performed on 1-2  μ g total RNA as described in the Supplementary Materials. 2.5. In Vitro Assessment of the Effects of NF1 Variants on NF1 Pre-mRNA Splicing Exon trap experiments were performed as described previously [ 33 ,  34 ]. See Supplementary Materials for details. 2.6. In Vitro Assessment of RAS GAP Activity To estimate RAS GAP activity, HA-H-RAS was expressed together with either wild-type (WT) or variant NF in COS-7 or HEK 293 T cells. GTP-bound RAS was subsequently isolated using glutathione-agarose beads coated with recombinant GST-RAF-RBD [ 35 ]. See Supplementary Materials for details. 2.7. In Vitro Assessment of the NF1-SPRED Interaction To investigate the NF-SPRED interaction, FLAG-SPRED1 (WT or variant) and NF (WT or variant) were coexpressed in HEK 293 T cells. NF-SPRED1 complexes were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG affinity beads (Sigma-Aldrich). See Supplementary Materials for details.

PMID:23225063,Dopamine deficiency underlies learning deficits in neurofibromatosis-1 mice.,"Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are prone to learning and behavioral abnormalities, including problems with spatial learning and attention. The molecular etiology for these deficits is unclear, as previous studies have implicated defective dopamine, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and Ras homeostasis. Using behavioral, electrophysiological, and primary culture, we now demonstrate that reduced dopamine signaling is responsible for cAMP-dependent defects in neuron function and learning. Collectively, these results establish defective dopaminergic function as a contributing factor underlying impaired spatial learning and memory in children and adults with NF1, and support the use of treatments that restore normal dopamine homeostasis for select individuals.","Materials and Methods Methods and relevant references are available in the online version of the paper.

PMID:19103750,"The neurofibromatosis 2 protein, merlin, regulates glial cell growth in an ErbB2- and Src-dependent manner.","Individuals with the inherited cancer predisposition syndrome neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) develop several central nervous system (CNS) malignancies, including glial cell neoplasms (ependymomas). Recent studies have suggested that the NF2 protein, merlin (or schwannomin), may regulate receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, intracellular mitogenic growth control pathways, or adherens junction organization in non-nervous-system cell types. For this report, we used glial fibrillary acidic protein conditional knockout mice and derivative glia to determine how merlin regulates CNS glial cell proliferation. We show that the loss of merlin in glial cells results in increased proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Merlin regulation of glial cell growth reflects deregulated Src activity, such that pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of Src activation reduces Nf2(-/-) glial cell growth to wild-type levels. We further show that Src regulates Nf2(-/-) glial cell growth by sequentially regulating FAK and paxillin phosphorylation/activity. Next, we demonstrate that Src activation results from merlin regulation of ErbB2 activation and that genetic or pharmacologic ErbB2 inhibition reduces Nf2(-/-) glial cell Src/Src effector activation and proliferation to wild-type levels. Lastly, we show that merlin competes with Src for direct binding to ErbB2 and present a novel molecular mechanism for merlin regulation of ErbB2-dependent Src signaling and growth control.",,S Sean Houshmandi; Ryan J Emnett; Marco Giovannini; David H Gutmann,Molecular and cellular biology,2009-03,10.1128/MCB.01392-08,abstract_only,False
PMID:21199799,Dose-dependent effects of focal fractionated irradiation on secondary malignant neoplasms in Nf1 mutant mice.,"Secondary malignant neoplasms (SMN) are increasingly common complications of cancer therapy that have proven difficult to model in mice. Clinical observations suggest that the development of SMN correlates with radiation dose; however, this relationship has not been investigated systematically. We developed a novel procedure for administering fractionated cranial irradiation (CI) and investigated the incidence and spectrum of cancer in control and heterozygous Nf1 mutant mice irradiated to a moderate (15 Gy) or high dose (30 Gy). Heterozygous Nf1 inactivation cooperated with CI to induce solid tumors and myeloid malignancies, with mice developing many of the most common SMNs found in human patients. CI-induced malignancies segregated according to radiation dose as Nf1(+/-) mice developed predominately hematologic abnormalities after 15 Gy, whereas solid tumors predominated at 30 Gy, suggesting that radiation dose thresholds exist for hematologic and nonhematologic cancers. Genetic and biochemical studies revealed discrete patterns of somatic Nf1 and Trp53 inactivation and we observed hyperactive Ras signaling in many radiation-induced solid tumors. This technique for administering focal fractionated irradiation will facilitate mechanistic and translational studies of SMNs.","Materials and Methods Mouse Strains, Breeding and Treatment. Mouse Strains, Breeding and Treatment Nf1 +/  mice were generated as previously described ( − 11 ). In brief,  Nf1 +/  mice maintained in the 129/Sv background ( − 12 ) were crossed with wild-type C57Bl/6 mice. We modified a previously published rat brain irradiation protocol developed at our institution to reproducibly irradiate murine brains  in vivo  ( 13 ). Mice were placed 16.3 cm from a cesium-137 source (J.L. Shepherd & Associates, San Fernando, CA) and shielded with an iron collimator that limited the beam width to a narrow 1 cm wide vertical beam. Six to eight week old mice were given cranial irradiation at a fractionation of either five fractions of 3 Gy or ten fractions of 3 Gy, delivered at a rate of five fractions per week, one fraction per day. All animal procedures were approved by the UCSF IACUC. Pathologic Analysis Animals with signs of systemic illness were euthanized and visible masses/growths, peripheral blood, and bone marrow were collected immediately. The mice were then perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde and the following organs were collected: brain, skin in irradiated region, skin outside irradiated region, skull, heart, lungs, spleen, liver, kidneys, segment of small intestine. Pathologic review was performed on hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections by A.H., S.K., or S.V. Complete blood counts were performed on blood samples obtained at the time of sacrifice by cardiac puncture and analyzed immediately on a Hemavet provided by the UCSF Mouse Pathology Core. Immunohistochemistry Five micrometer sections were obtained through paraffin-embedded tumors. Phosphorylated ERK Thr202/Tyr204 (catalog #4376), phosphorylated Akt Ser473 (#9271) and phosphorylated S6 Ser235/236 (#2211) (all from Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) were assessed on paraffin-embedded sections using immunofluorescent staining as described previously ( 14 ). Slides were visualized on a fluorescent microscope and six independent fields were scored for relative fluorescence at 40X magnification by a blinded reviewer (J.N.). These scores were then averaged to generate the fluorescence score. Images were captured and merged using Openlab (Improvision, Waltham, MA). Genotyping and Mutation Analysis Trp53  loss of heterozygosity was analyzed at the D11Mit29 and D11Mit31 loci by amplifying tumor DNA with the following primers: forward 5′ TTGAGGCATGAGGGGATTAG 3′, reverse 5′ TTTCCGTCATTGCTAAAGGG 3′, 5′ TTTCCCAGTCACGACGTTGGCCTGAATTCACATGGTGG 3′, reverse 5′ AGAATAAGTAAACCCAGCTGCG 3′. D11Mit219 was amplified with the following primers: forward 5′ TTTCCCAGTCACGACGTTGTTGTATGTATAGATGCAT TTGAATGG -3′, reverse 5′ GGTTTGTATAAATTCTCACCTGTGC 3′. PCR fragment analyses were performed by the UCSF Genome Core using Peak Scanner software from Applied Biosystems. SNP rs 13481119 was amplified using the following primers: forward GC CCGCTACATG CTGATGCTG reverse GCTTGTAGGCCTGGTGAGTC. SNP products were sequenced using a commercial sequencing service. Cell Culture Nf1 ,  −/− Nf1 , and wildtype mouse embryo fibroblasts were generated as previously described ( +/− 15 ). Tumor cell lines were generated as previously described ( 11 ). All cell lines were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM, 4500 mg/L glucose, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO-BRL, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), penicillin, and streptomycin. Cells were grown in a humidified incubator containing 5% carbon dioxide at 37°C. Quantitation of γH2AX Foci Formation Cells grown on glass coverslips were irradiated, then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at specified time points. Coverslips were permeabilized and probed with anti- γH2AX Ser139 antibody (Millipore), followed by anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 488 secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). Coverslips were mounted using Vectashield with DAPI (Vector Laboratories), and visualized with a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope. Statistical Analysis Survival curves are calculated from Kaplan-Meier product limit estimators to determine the association of CI on mortality. Interim sacrifices of moribund animals are taken as uncensored events while the terminal, end-of-study sacrifices are necessarily considered censored. Log-rank tests are used to test for differences in survival curves between groups. Fisher-Irwin exact tests are used to make pairwise comparisons of total disease incidence between dosage groups. Cochran-Armitage tests for trend are used to consider all dosage groups together. Disease-specific incidence is compared using both unadjusted and survival-adjusted analyses. Two way ANOVAs were used to assess the effects of genotype and radiation dosage on hemoglobin levels, white blood cell count, and platelet count. Two-tailed t-tests were used to make pairwise comparisons of hemoglobin levels, white blood cell counts, and platelet counts.

PMID:7717450,Analysis of the neurofibromatosis 2 gene reveals molecular variants of meningioma.,"There is evidence from cytogenetic and loss of heterozygosity studies for the involvement of a tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 22 in the formation of meningiomas. Recently, the NF2 gene, which causes neurofibromatosis type 2 and which is located in the affected region on chromosome 22, has been identified. A previous study on 8 of the 17 exons of the NF2 gene described mutations in 16% of meningiomas. We have analyzed the entire coding region of the NF2 gene in 70 sporadic meningiomas and identified 43 mutations in 41 patients. These resulted predominantly in immediate truncation, splicing abnormalities, or an altered reading frame of the predicted protein product. Although there was no evidence for distinct hotspots, all mutations occurred in the first 13 exons, the region of homology with the filopodial proteins moesin, ezrin, and radixin. The association of loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 22 with mutations in the NF2 gene was significant. These data suggest that NF2 represents the meningioma locus on chromosome 22. NF2 mutations occurred significantly more frequently in fibroblastic meningioma (70%) and transitional meningioma (83%) than in meningiothelial meningioma (25%), thus indicating a differential molecular pathogenesis of these meningioma variants.",,R Wellenreuther; J A Kraus; D Lenartz; A G Menon; J Schramm; D N Louis; V Ramesh; J F Gusella; O D Wiestler; A von Deimling,The American journal of pathology,1995-04,,abstract_only,False
PMID:24824755,BNIP3 regulates AT101 [(-)-gossypol] induced death in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor cells.,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive Schwann cell-derived sarcomas and are the leading cause of mortality in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Current treatment modalities have been largely ineffective, resulting in a high rate of MPNST recurrence and poor five-year patient survival. This necessitates the exploration of alternative chemotherapeutic options for MPNST patients. This study sought to assess the cytotoxic effect of the BH3-mimetic AT101 [(-)-gossypol] on MPNST cells in vitro and to identify key regulators of AT101-induced MPNST cell death. We found that AT101 caused caspase-independent, non-apoptotic MPNST cell death, which was accompanied by autophagy and was mediated through HIF-1α induced expression of the atypical BH3-only protein BNIP3. These effects were mediated by intracellular iron chelation, a previously unreported mechanism of AT101 cytotoxicity.","Materials and Methods Antibodies and Other Reagents Primary antibodies were obtained from the following sources: HIF-1α, BECLIN1, BIM, BCL-xL, β-tubulin, Ferritin HC and transferrin receptor-1 (TfR1/CD71; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); BNIP3 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO); Lamin A/C (BD Transduction Laboratories, Franklin Lakes, NJ); GAPDH, BCL-2 and PUMA (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA); LC3 (Abgent, San Diego, CA). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and horse anti-mouse antibodies were obtained from Biorad (Hercules, CA) and Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA), respectively. AT101 was provided by Ascenta Therapeutics (Malvern, PA). BOC-aspartyl (Ome)-fluoromethyl ketone (BAF) and ferric citrate were purchased from MP Biomedicals (Aurora, OH), Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) was from A.G. Scientific (San Diego, CA) and 3-methyladenine (3MA), Staurosporine (STS), Deferoxamine Mesylate (DFO), Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). ABT-737 was purchased from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX). Cell Culture We have previously described the source of T265-2c cells, ST88-14 cells and 90-8 cells, the human NF1-associated MPNST lines used in this study  [25] . The identity of these cell lines was routinely verified according to the specifications outlined in the ATCC Technical Bulletin 8. Briefly, morphology and doubling times of cells were routinely assessed and the identity of cells was verified by short tandem repeat analyses. Cells were also regularly tested for Mycoplasma infection. All cell lines were cultured in DMEM10 [DMEM (Sigma, St. Louis, MO)] containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 1% L-glutamine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone, Logan, UT) and incubated at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO 2 , 95% air atmosphere. Cells were plated on uncoated 48 well plates at a density of 20,000/well and in 100 mm dishes at a density of 10 6  cells/dish. Cultures were used in experiments 24 hours post-plating. Drug treatments were performed in media supplemented with 5% FBS. Concentrated stocks of AT101 (5 mM) were prepared in DMSO. Cell Viability, Cytotoxicity, Apoptosis and In Vitro Caspase Cleavage Assays The calcein-AM (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) conversion assay was used to measure cell viability. Caspase activation was assessed with an  in vitro  caspase-3 cleavage assay utilizing the chemical substrate DEVD-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) (Enzo Life Sciences, Framingdale, NY). Both of these assays were performed as described previously  [26] . Cytotoxicity and apoptosis were assessed using the  LIVE/DEAD  Viability/Cytotoxicity kit for mammalian cells and the Dead Cell Apoptosis kit with Annexin V Alexa Fluor 488 and Propidium Iodide from Molecular Probes Inc (Eugene, OR). Manufacturers' instructions were followed and ethidium homodimer-1, Alexa Fluor 488 and Propidium Iodide fluorescence were measured using a BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Western Blotting Whole cell lysates were prepared by removing the media, washing the cells with PBS, scraping the cells free with a cell lifter and then pelleting them by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails 1 and 3 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Lysates were clarified and stored at −80°C. 30 µg of protein was immunoblotted per our previously described protocol  [27] . All primary antibodies were diluted to a final concentration of 1∶1000 except GAPDH and LAMIN (1∶5000). Immunoreactive species were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce ECL; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were extracted using the NE-PER extraction kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) following the manufacturers' instructions. Immunocytochemistry Primary antibodies were used at the following working concentrations: LC3 (Abgent; 1∶1000), BNIP3 (Sigma; 1∶100). HRP–conjugated anti-rabbit Super Picture (Invitrogen; used for LC3), and anti-mouse ImmPRESS (Vector Laboratories; used for BNIP3) were both used at 1∶100 dilutions. Immunoreactivity was detected using a tyramide signal amplification system using Cy3 (Perkin-Elmer Life Science Products). Bisbenzimide (1 µg/mL; Hoechst 33258; Sigma) was used for nuclear counterstaining. Samples were examined using a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescent microscope equipped with an AxioCam digital camera. Images were captured and analyzed using Axio Vision Rel. 4.8 software (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging). Reverse transcription and real-time quantitative PCR RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plus mini kit (Qiagen). cDNA was subsequently synthesized using a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). Real-time quantitative PCR assays were performed using the Maxima SYBR Green/ROX qPCR master mix (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) and the probes were obtained from Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA). Amplifications were run in a Stepone Plus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The following sense/antisense primers and probes were selected from the Harvard PrimerBank and used for detecting human  BNIP3  ( 5′-TGAGTCTGGACGGAGTAGCTC-3′  and  5′-CCCTGTTGGTATCTTGTGGTGT-3′ ),  HIF-1α  ( 5′-GAACGTCGAAAAGAAAAGTCTCG-3′  and  5′-CCTTATCAAGATGCGAACTCACA-3′ ) and  ACTIN  ( 5′-GTCTGCCTTGGTAGTGGATAATG-3′  and  5′-TCGAGGACGCCCTATCATGG-3′ ). Analysis was done using the ΔΔC T  method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001) and values were adjusted using  ACTIN  RNA levels as reference. RNAi 
 BNIP3  and  HIF-1α  siRNA (siGENOME SMARTPool) was purchased from Thermo Scientific (Waltham, MA) and reconstituted according to the manufacturers' instructions. Cells were plated in DMEM10 and transfected 24 hours post-plating using X-tremeGene siRNA transfection reagent (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) at a ratio of 5∶2 [transfection reagent (µl):oligos (µg)]. The next day, fresh media was added to cells. Transfected cells were replated 48 hours post-transfection and treated 72 hours post-transfection. Iron Binding Assay The iron binding properties of AT101, ABT737 and DFO were assessed in a cell free system using a modified protocol with the Iron/TIBC reagent set from Teco Diagnostics (Anaheim, CA). Briefly, the protocol for measuring unsaturated iron-binding capacity (UIBC) was modified to assess the iron binding capacity of the respective drugs in solution. Equal volumes of the UIBC buffer (Tris buffer 0.5 M, pH 8.0 with surfactant and sodium azide) were added to all wells followed by equal volumes of the iron standard supplied with the kit, except the blank. Various concentrations of AT101, ABT737 and DFO were added to their respective wells and volumes balanced with iron-free water. After the baseline absorbance was read at 560 nm, equal volumes of iron color reagent (Ferrozine 16.6 mM in hydroxylamine hydrochloride) were added to all wells and the plate incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes. Following incubation, absorbance was read again at 560 nm. The amount of iron bound was calculated using the manufacturers' instructions. Statistics All data points represent mean ± S.D. All experiments were repeated at least 3 times unless stated otherwise. Representative data is shown. Statistical significance was determined by ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's posthoc test for multiple comparisons and student's t-test for two groups using Graphpad Prism 6 software.

PMID:20428190,NF-1Score: a prediction score for internal neurofibromas in neurofibromatosis-1.,"NF-1 is associated with a 15-year decrease in life expectancy. Internal neurofibromas are associated with increased morbidity and mortality through malignant transformation and compression of neighboring organs. Our purpose was to develop and to validate a clinical score for predicting internal neurofibromas in adults. The development sample comprised 208 patients and the validation sample 191 patients. The score was developed using logistic regression. Discrimination and calibration of the model were evaluated. Four variables were independently associated with internal neurofibromas: at least two subcutaneous neurofibromas (odds ratio (OR)=4.7, [2.1-10.5]), age < or =30 years (OR=3.1, [1.4-6.8]), absence of cutaneous neurofibromas (OR=2.6, [0.9-7.5]), and fewer than six café-au-lait spots (OR=2.0 [0.9-4.6]). The score computed by linear combination of the rounded coefficients of these four variables ranged from 0 to 40 (mean, 12.8+/-10.8). The probability of internal neurofibromas was computed as exp (-2.93+0.11Score)/exp (1+(-2.93+0.11Score)). Probabilities agreed well with the observed frequencies indicating good calibration, and discrimination was adequate (AUC-ROC, 0.75) in both data sets. The presence of internal neurofibromas can be accurately predicted using a simple clinical score. Further work will establish the score threshold that identifies patients at high risk for complications.",,Emilie Sbidian; Pierre Wolkenstein; Laurence Valeyrie-Allanore; Diana Rodriguez; Smail Hadj-Rabia; Salah Ferkal; Jean-Philippe Lacour; Jean-Claude Leonard; Luc Taillandier; Stéphanie Sportich; Philippe Berbis; Sylvie Bastuji-Garin,The Journal of investigative dermatology,2010-09,10.1038/jid.2010.100,abstract_only,False
PMID:21439418,Primary osteopathy of vertebrae in a neurofibromatosis type 1 murine model.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by mutation of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene. Spinal deformities are common skeletal manifestations in patients with NF1. To date, the mechanism of vertebral abnormalities remains unclear because of the lack of appropriate animal models for the skeletal manifestations of NF1. In the present study, we report a novel murine NF1 model, Nf1(flox/-);Col2.3Cre(+) mice. These mice display short vertebral segments. In addition, a significant reduction in cortical and trabecular bone mass of the vertebrae was observed in Nf1(flox/-);Col2.3Cre(+) mice as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT). Peak stress and peak load were also significantly reduced in Nf1(flox/-);Col2.3Cre(+) mice as compared to controls. Furthermore, the lumbar vertebrae showed enlargement of the inter-vertebral canal, a characteristic feature of lumbar vertebrae in NF1 patients. Finally, histologic analysis demonstrated increased numbers of osteoclasts and decreased numbers of osteoblasts in the vertebrae of Nf1(flox/-);Col2.3Cre(+) mice in comparison to controls. In summary, Nf1(flox/-);Col2.3Cre(+) mice demonstrate multiple structural and functional abnormalities in the lumbar vertebrae which recapitulate the dystrophic vertebral changes in NF1 patients. This novel murine model provides a platform to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of spinal deficits in NF1 patients.","Materials and methods Animals Nf1 +/− mice were obtained from Dr. Tyler Jacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Cambridge, MA) [ 31 ].  Nf1  mice were provided by Dr. Luis Parada at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center [ flox/flox 7 ].  Col2.3Cre  transgenic mice were generated as described elsewhere [ 36 ]. In this model, the 2.3 α1(I) Collagen promoter is used to selectively drive Cre expression in the osteoblast lineage. As further validation of this model,  Col2.3Cre  transgenic mice were crossed with  ROSA26  reporter mice. LacZ staining was performed to assess Cre recombination in skeletal tissues. Abundant β-gal expression was observed in the long bones and vertebrae of  flox/flox ROSA26  mice but absent in  flox/flox ;Col2.3Cre + ROSA26  controls ( flox/flox ;Col2.3Cre − Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Four different genotypes of mice were generated with the intercross. (1)  Nf1  mice (systemically wildtype, WT); (2)  flox/flox ;Col2.3Cre − Nf1  mice ( flox/− ;Col2.3Cre − Nf1 +/− systemically); (3)  Nf1  mice (WT in hematopoietic lineages and  flox/flox ;Col2.3Cre + Nf1 −/− in osteoblasts); and (4)  Nf1  mice ( flox/− ;Col2.3Cre + Nf1 +/− in hematopoietic lineages and  Nf1 −/− in osteoblasts). PCR based genotyping was accomplished utilizing tail DNA and primers as described elsewhere ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ) [ 31 , 37 , 38 ]. The successful deletion of neurofibromin in osteoblasts was confirmed by western blot with optimal exposure (top panel) and overexposure (middle panel) ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). All studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Longitudinal in vivo X-ray and peripheral dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (pDEXA) X-rays were taken using a piXarray 100 DSR System with Biopix Software (Version No: 1.0.6., Bioptics, Inc. Tucson, AZ). The axial bone was dissected after the mice were euthanized. Whole spine anterior–posterior radiographs were taken. To avoid the possible influence of transition of L6 in the lumbosacral region, the height of each L1–L5 vertebral body was measured between the cranial and caudal ends. To evaluate the bone mass in each genotype of mice, bone mineral density (BMD) of the axial bone was evaluated  in vivo  using pDEXA (PIXImus II; GE-Lunar Corp., Madison, WI) [ 39 ]. The mice were placed in a prone position on a specimen tray and scanned. The head was excluded from total body scans. The region of interest included the center of the whole axial bone and the L1–L5 lumbar region. Peripheral quantitative computed tomography Whole axial bone was placed in the gantry of a XCT Research SA + peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) scanner (Stratec Medizintechnik GmbH, Pforzheim, Germany) with Software Version 5.50. A voxel size of 70 μm was used for analysis [ 40 ]. A scout view was obtained and the anatomical reference line was positioned at the midpoint of the rostral/caudal margin of the L5 pedicle. Individual slices were obtained from each vertebra. The centrum of the vertebra was selected as a region of interest (ROI). Volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD; mg/cm 3 ) of the cortical and trabecular bone was measured. The ratio of spinal canal area/vertebral body area was derived by measuring the area of the L5 vertebral body and the spinal intervertebral canal from the pQCT images. Biomechanical testing To evaluate the structural integrity of L5 vertebrae, biomechanical testing was conducted utilizing Testresouse R systems with MtestwR software version: R 1.4.2 (TestResources Inc. Shakopee, MN). After removing all tissue, L5 vertebral bodies were isolated and prepared with flat and parallel cranial and caudal ends by removing only the soft cartilage (intervertebral disk) and exposing the bone surface. These vertebral bodies were subjected to mechanical testing in compression using a servo-controlled mechanical testing machine. All biomechanical tests were conducted at room temperature (RT) and at a rate of 20 mm/min. Peak load was defined as the maximum load that the specimen can withstand before fracturing. The cross sectional area of each vertebra was measured on a medial and lateral (transverse) plane. The peak stress was calculated by the equation: peak stress=peak load/cross sectional area of vertebra. Isolation of osteoblast-like cells from lumbar vertebrae and osteoblast differentiation assays Osteoblast-like cells were cultured from vertebrae as previously reported with minor modifications [ 41 , 42 ]. Briefly, one-month-old mice were sacrificed and vertebrae were harvested by depleting muscle and connective tissue. Individual vertebrae (L1–L5) were collected, minced, and marrow cells were collected by digestion of the minced tissue using type III collagenase (0.1 mg/mL), 2.5% trypsin, and shaking in a hot water bath at 37 °C for 40 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 10 volumes of Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The cells were then washed once with DMEM, and aggregates were removed from the cell suspension by sieving through a 70 μm strainer. Cell number was determined by counting trypan blue negative cells. To examine the frequency of osteoblast progenitors in the marrow of  Nf1  lumbar vertebrae, colony forming units of osteoblasts (CFU-OBL) were assessed following ALP staining as previously described [ flox/− ;Col2.3Cre + 43 ]. To evaluate the osteoblast differentiation in more detail, Alizarin staining was performed on the osteoblast differentiation cultures. In brief, mononuclear cells from lumbar vertebrae were cultured at 2×10 6 /mL in osteogenic differentiation medium (MesenCult PLUS supplemented with 10 −8  mol/L dexamethasone, 5 μg/mL ascorbic acid 2-phosphate, and 10 mmol/L β-glycerophosphate). After two weeks of culture, cells were washed with PBS and stained with 2% Alizarin Red S solution (pH=4.2) for 1 h. Then the cells were washed with distilled water and incubated with 500 μL of 1% hydrochloric acid in 70% ethanol and shaken on a plate rotator for 30 min. The extracted supernatant was collected and the optical density was measured at a wavelength of 450 nm. For each sample, measurements were performed in triplicate. Von Kossa staining was used to evaluate the osteogenic differentiation of marrow cells from the vertebrae [ 44 ]. Briefly, after 4 weeks culture in osteoblast differentiation media in 6-well tissue culture plates, the cells were fixed with 10% neutral formalin. Freshly prepared 5% silver nitrate (2 mL) was added to each well, and then incubated under UV light for 60 min. The dishes were then rinsed with distilled water and fixed with 5% sodium thiosulfate for 2 min. The wells were photographed using a phase-contrast microscope, and the number of mineralized bone nodules was recorded. Histological analysis and biohistochemistry Histological analysis was conducted to evaluate the osteoclast and osteoblast distribution and frequency [ 45 ]. Briefly, 6 month old mice of each genotype were sacrificed. Lumbar vertebrae were harvested from each animal and fixed in 4% formaldehyde buffered solution at RT. The vertebrae were then decalcified in 10% ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA) in 4% formaldehyde buffered solution for 4 days. The tissues were then dehydrated in graded alcohols and embedded in paraffin, and longitudinal sections of the L5 vertebrae were obtained and processed for tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP) staining and MacNeal’s staining. To evaluate the osteoclasts in the vertebral sections, TRACP staining was performed. Briefly, vertebrae were fixed in 10% formaldehyde and processed for paraffin embedding. 5 μm thick sections were cut using a microtome (Nussloch GmbH, Germany) and the slides were incubated in 50 mL 0.2 M acetate buffer for 20 min at RT, transferred from pre-incubation to incubation media which contained 0.2 M acetate buffer (pH=5.0), AS-MX phosphate 0.5 mg/mL, and fast red TR Salt 1.1 mg/mL as previously described [ 46 ]. To evaluate the morphology and number of osteoblasts, the slides were stained in a 2% tetrachrome solution for 10 min. Osteoblasts in the L5 vertebrae were quantified following MacNeal’s staining. The quantification of osteoclast and osteoblast cell number was normalized to the bone surface in millimeters (mm), to control for the total amount of endosteal bone surface (cancellous bone surface + endocortical bone surface) within each histological section. To determine the neurofibromin expression in the osteoblasts at the protein level, western blot was performed [ 43 ]. Statistical analysis Two-tailed Student’s  t  test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to evaluate statistical difference.  P  values less than 0.05 were considered significant.",Wei Zhang; Steven D Rhodes; Liming Zhao; Yongzheng He; Yingze Zhang; Yong Shen; Dalong Yang; Xiaohua Wu; Xiaohong Li; Xianlin Yang; Su-Jung Park; Shi Chen; Charles Turner; Feng-Chun Yang,Bone,2011-06-01,10.1016/j.bone.2011.03.760,minimal,True
PMID:27081657,A randomized placebo-controlled lovastatin trial for neurobehavioral function in neurofibromatosis I.,"OBJECTIVE: Lovastatin has been shown to reverse learning deficits in a mouse model of Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1), a common monogenic disorder caused by a mutation in the Ras-MAPK pathway and associated with learning disabilities. We conducted a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to assess lovastatin's effects on cognition and behavior in patients with NF1. METHOD: Forty-four NF1 patients (mean age 25.7+/-11.6 years; 64% female) were randomly assigned to 14 weeks of lovastatin (N = 23; maximum dose of 80 mg/day for adult participants and 40 mg/day for children) or placebo (N = 21). Based on findings in the mouse model, primary outcome measures were nonverbal learning and working memory. Secondary outcome measures included verbal memory, attention, and self/parent-reported behavioral problems, as well as tolerability of medication. Participants also underwent neuroimaging assessments at baseline and 14 weeks, to determine whether neural biomarkers were associated with treatment response. Linear mixed models assessed for differential treatment effects on outcome measures. RESULTS: Twelve participants dropped from the study prior to completion (8 placebo, 4 lovastatin), resulting in 32 completers (15 placebo, 17 lovastatin). Lovastatin was well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events. Differential improvement favoring lovastatin treatment was observed for one primary (working memory; effect size f (2) = 0.70, P < 0.01) and two secondary outcome measures (verbal memory, f (2) = 0.19, P = 0.02, and adult self-reported internalizing problems, f (2) = 0.26, P = 0.03). Exploratory moderator analyses revealed that higher baseline neural activity in frontal regions was associated with larger treatment effects. INTERPRETATION: These preliminary results suggest beneficial effects of lovastatin on some learning and memory functions, as well as internalizing symptoms in patients with NF1.","Patients and Methods Design A prospective double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, randomized 14‐week clinical trial was conducted in individuals with NF1 between January 2010 and March 2013. The study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov, trial #  NCT00352599 . Participants Participants were recruited from three primary sources: (1) The Children's Hospital Los Angeles Neurofibromatosis Clinic, a major NF1 referral center for the greater Los Angeles region; (2) local Children's Tumor Foundation and NF Network educational symposia; and (3) websites, both NF‐specific and  www.clinicaltrials.gov . Following receipt of thorough verbal and written descriptions of study requirements, and prior to initiation of any study activities, all participants provided written consent or parental permission and child/youth assent following procedures approved by the UCLA Institutional Review Board. Participants were screened and enrolled by a pediatric neurologist (TR), a clinician with experience in caring for individuals with NF1. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Meets the NIH NF1 diagnostic criteria 14  and does not have segmental NF1 ;  (2) 10–50 years of age; (3) Full‐Scale IQ of at least 70, as determined by the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI 15 ); (4) Not currently taking a statin medication; (5) Not suffering from hypercholesterolemia, based on National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) guidelines 16 ; (6) Normal hepatic, muscle enzyme (CPK), hematologic, renal function and cholesterol lab values on initial screening; (7) Not taking any additional medications with potential interactions with lovastatin; (8) No comorbid major neurological or psychiatric disorder (e.g., epilepsy, bipolar disorder, psychotic illness, major depression); (9) No evidence of intracranial pathology (other than asymptomatic optic pathway glioma); (10) Female participants could not be pregnant or lactating; sexually active females were required to use adequate birth control measures during the study and undergo regular urine pregnancy testing; (11) Sufficient English fluency to avoid invalidating research measures. Participants with a clinical diagnosis of ADHD were included, but those subjects on medication for ADHD treatment were required to continue the same medication dose throughout the duration of the study (Table  1 ). Additionally, none of the subjects included in the study had other NF1‐related gliomas. Table 1 Baseline demographics NF1 Participants‐lovastatin ( n  = 21) NF1 Participants‐placebo ( n  = 23)

Separate randomizations were performed for adult ( n  = 30) and child ( n  = 14) study participants to ensure that treatment assignment was balanced by age. Randomization was performed by the UCLA investigational pharmacist, who assigned participants in the order of their enrollment in the trial and dispensed the medication. Study participants, their parents, and all study investigators and personnel were blind to the treatment allocation. The randomization list was only accessible to the senior database programmer and the pharmacist. Participants' treatment allocation and test results remained de‐identified until all follow‐up was completed. Subjects were treated once daily for 14 weeks with lovastatin or placebo. Adults receiving lovastatin were administered doses of 40 mg/day for week 1, 60 mg/day for week 2 and 80 mg/day for weeks 3–14. Children and adolescents (age 10–17) were administered 20 mg/day for week 1, 30 mg for week 2 and 40 mg for weeks 3–14. This dosing schedule was based on guidelines for adults 17  and children 18  with hypercholesterolemia, respectively. The capsules containing placebo or lovastatin were identical in color, shape, and size. Medication safety monitoring and adherence Following enrollment, participants underwent a physical examination, including height, weight, and vital signs, conducted by the study physician (TR) in order to verify the NF1 diagnosis based on NIH NF1 diagnostic criteria 14  and to ensure that there were no medical contraindications to participation. Baseline laboratory studies included: complete blood count (CBC), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), bilirubin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), glucose, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), and lipid panels. Menstruating female participants had urine pregnancy tests. Follow‐up visits occurred at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 14 weeks following treatment initiation and included a comprehensive physical examination, open‐ended adverse event inquiry, documentation of concomitant medications, and repeated laboratory studies. A final study visit occurred at 18 weeks, 1 month after cessation of medication/placebo therapy, and included a final physical examination as well as adverse event monitoring. An independent study physician monitored laboratory results in parallel with study visits to insure ongoing participant safety as well as keeping the treating physician blinded to the treatment condition. Medication compliance was assessed at the week 4, 8, and 14‐week visits. Participants were judged medication‐compliant when they took at least 80% of their study medication during the intervention period of 14 weeks, which was assessed by counting returned capsules and with a pill diary. General lovastatin and placebo toxicity were monitored throughout the trial using standard guidelines ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ), and were rated as being not drug related, possibly drug related, or definitely drug related prior to unblinding. Criteria for study discontinuation included: (1) Noncompliance with administration of lovastatin or placebo tablets, and/or with required follow‐up; (2) development of a medical condition or initiation of another medication with which lovastatin is contra‐indicated; (3) development of significant drug toxicity (defined as grade 2 or higher toxicity which persists after 10 days off lovastatin); (4) pregnancy in a female participant. Outcome measures Outcome measures were assessed at baseline and after 14 weeks of treatment. Parallel versions of tests were applied when available to reduce the impact of practice effects. Primary outcomes were two neuropsychological measures that were most analogous to statin‐responsive tests in  Nf1  mice, specifically: the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test – Revised (BVMT, Immediate and Delayed 19 ; nonverbal declarative memory) and the Letter‐Number Sequencing task (LNS 20 ; working memory). For the secondary outcomes, we selected neuropsychological and behavioral tests to assess domains that are differentially affected in NF1 patients, that is, attention, learning and memory, and social behavior 2 ,  3 : Digit Cancellation (attention/inhibitory control) 21 , Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT; verbal declarative memory 22 ), WISC‐III Object Assembly (visuoconstructive ability) 23 , and Internalizing and Externalizing symptoms, as well as the Attention, Thought and Social Problems subscales from either the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; self‐ and parent‐report) or Young Adult Self Report (YASR) 24 ,  25 . Due to the exploratory nature of this trial, additional tertiary neurocognitive and behavioral measures (deemed less central to the characteristic NF1 cognitive profile) included: the Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB) Mazes 26 , Delis–Kaplan Executive Function Scale (D‐KEFS) verbal fluency (category and letter fluency) 27  and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF; General Executive Composite (GEC) score) 28 . All neuropsychological tests were administered and scored by trained psychometricians blind to treatment condition. Functional imaging measures were also collected at baseline and 14‐week follow‐up to explore its potential both as a predictor of eventual treatment response and as an intermediate marker of treatment‐related change. Image acquisition All scanning was carried out on identical Siemens 3 Tesla Tim Trio (Erlangen, Germany) MRI scanners using identical protocols at either the UCLA Brain Mapping Center or the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience (CCN). Measures of brain structure were obtained using T1‐weighted anatomical images acquired with an MPRAGE sequence with the following acquisition parameters: TR/TE/TI = 2300/2.89/900 ms; flip angle = 9 degrees; slice thickness = 1.20 mm, with a 240 × 256 acquisition matrix. Spatial capacity working memory (SCAP) task A spatial working memory functional MRI paradigm, designed to be analogous to the behavioral tasks used in the mouse model, was also administered. We previously found hypoactivation of fronto‐parietal neural circuitry using this task in untreated NF1 patients 29 . Specifically, subjects were shown a target array of 1, 3, 5, or 7 yellow circles positioned pseudo‐randomly around a central fixation, as detailed in Glahn et al 30 . After a variable delay, subjects were shown a single green circle and asked to indicate whether that circle was in the same position as one of the target circles. Participants took part in a behavioral training session immediately prior to the one‐hour scan. In the scanner, trial events included a 2‐sec target array, 1.5, 3, and 4.5‐sec(s) delay, 3‐sec probe array, and a jittered (average of 2 sec) intertrial interval (ITI) with a fixation. During the task, 291 functional T2*‐weighted echoplanar images (EPIs) were collected with the following parameters: slice thickness = 4 mm, 34 slices, TR = 2 sec, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 90°, matrix 192 × 192, FOV = 192 mm. Functional MRI analysis fMRI data analyses were performed using tools from the FMRIB software library ( www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl ), version 5.0, using the same processing steps as described in our prior publications 29 ,  31 , including spatial smoothing, temporal filtering, and a three‐step registration process in which EPI images were first registered to the matched‐bandwidth high‐resolution scan, then to the structural image, and finally into standard (Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)) space, using nonlinear transformations 32 . Thirty‐seven subjects completed a baseline SCAP fMRI scan (18 statin, 19 placebo), of whom 5 were excluded due to an artifact in structural scan ( n  = 2) or excessive motion (translational motion >2 mm or 3 or more spikes greater than 1 mm in at least one scan;  n  = 3), resulting in 32 subjects (17 lovastatin, 15 placebo) in the baseline fMRI analysis. Thirty subjects (15 statin, 15 placebo) completed a follow‐up fMRI scan, of whom 10 were excluded for the following reasons: artifact in structural scan ( n  = 2), low signal to noise ratio (SNR;  n  = 2), excessive motion ( n  = 3), or poor registration between baseline and follow‐up scans ( n  = 3). Thus, 20 subjects were available for analysis at follow‐up (10 lovastatin, 10 control). Demographics of the subjects with usable MRI data did not differ from those of the overall sample. Further, there were no differences in motion (mean framewise displacement) between treatment groups ( P  = 0.20). Standard model fitting was conducted for all subjects, as in Shilyansky et al. 29 . Briefly, for each subject, first‐level models included contrasts for each individual load and delay condition. Our primary analyses focused on the All‐Loads contrast. The six motion parameters and temporal derivatives of all regressors were included as covariates of no interest to improve statistical sensitivity. Although no differences between scanners were found in any preliminary analyses ( P  > 0.05 for all comparisons), we included scanner as a covariate in subsequent group‐level analyses to ensure that any subtle between‐scanner differences were controlled. Bilateral 8 mm spherical regions of interest (ROIs) were used to extract percent signal change from the following regions at each timepoint: bilateral Brodmann's Area 10, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), frontal eye fields, and parietal cortex, as well as two default mode regions which served as control regions, the ventromedial PFC and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC; Fig.  1 
 ) . ROIs were created in MNI‐152 space and centered on peak voxel activation from the All‐Loads contrast in our previous study 29 . Average percent signal change values corresponding to an 8‐sec stimulus convolved with a gamma hemodynamic response function (HRF) from the All‐Loads contrast were extracted from baseline and follow‐up scans separately 33 . Figure 1 Regions of Interest for Spatial Capacity Working Memory ( SCAP ) Functional  MRI  Task. Statistical analyses Prior to performing the primary tests for treatment effects,  t ‐tests and chi‐squared tests were used to compare the lovastatin and placebo groups on baseline demographic and clinical measures to confirm the success of randomization. Similar tests were used to check for differential dropout between the treatment arms and to identify other correlates of early discontinuation. For each of the primary and secondary outcome measures, we fit a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with group (lovastatin, placebo), time (baseline, 14 weeks), and a group‐by‐time interaction to test for differential treatment effects (primary RCT analyses). Age‐adjusted scores were used for all cognitive and behavioral measures. For the BVMT‐R, age‐appropriate published normative data were only available for participants aged 18 and up; thus, for child participants, we applied norms from our large database of healthy control participants in a multisite project (North American Prodromal Longitudinal Study; U01MH081902 34 ). For outcome measures where a significant treatment effect was established, follow‐up moderator analyses were conducted to determine whether baseline features of the participants influenced response to lovastatin treatment, by adding those factors and their interactions with treatment group and time to the original GLMMs. In particular, we predicted that: (1) younger participants would show stronger treatment effects due to increased malleability, and (2) participants with larger baseline deficits would experience greater treatment benefits. Parallel exploratory analyses were conducted for the neuroimaging measures, to test for differential change over time in brain structure and function in the above‐specified ROIs. For all analyses of neuroimaging measures, we controlled for age, gender and scanner location by including them as covariates in GLMMs. Finally, we examined whether greater brain volume and/or increased neural activity at baseline was associated with increased treatment response by adding them as moderators to primary models. Because child and adult participants were assessed with different versions of the CBCL (i.e., participants aged 10–17 received the parent‐report and child self‐report forms, whereas participants age 18 and up received the YASR form), these measures were analyzed separately. We did not correct for multiple comparisons given that: (1) there were only 2 primary and 4 secondary outcome measures which were specified  a priori ; and (2) the neuropsychological and behavioral outcome measures are potentially intercorrelated. Multiple comparison correction would make it very difficult to detect a possible effect of treatment in this proof‐of‐concept exploratory investigation. Thus, we opted to guard against type II error.",Carrie E Bearden; Gerhard S Hellemann; Tena Rosser; Caroline Montojo; Rachel Jonas; Nicole Enrique; Laura Pacheco; Shaun A Hussain; Joyce Y Wu; Jennifer S Ho; James J McGough; Catherine A Sugar; Alcino J Silva,Annals of clinical and translational neurology,2016-04,10.1002/acn3.288,minimal,True
PMID:34230205,Recommendations for Social Skills End Points for Clinical Trials in Neurofibromatosis Type 1.,"OBJECTIVE: To review parent-report social skills measures to identify and recommend consensus outcomes for use in clinical trials of social deficit in children and adolescents (ages 6-18 years) with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). METHODS: Searches were conducted via PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov to identity social skills outcome measures with English language versions used in clinical trials in the past 5 years with populations with known social skills deficits, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Measures were rated by the Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) Neurocognitive Committee on patient characteristics, use in published studies, domains assessed, availability of standard scores, psychometric properties, and feasibility to determine their appropriateness for use in NF1 clinical trials. RESULTS: Two measures were ultimately recommended by the committee: the Social Responsiveness Scale-2 (SRS-2) and the Social Skills Improvement System-Rating Scale (SSIS-RS). CONCLUSIONS: Each of the 2 measures assesses different aspects of social functioning. The SSIS-RS is appropriate for studies focused on broader social functioning; the SRS-2 is best for studies targeting problematic social behaviors associated with ASD. Researchers will need to consider the goals of their study when choosing a measure, and specific recommendations for their use are provided.",,Jennifer A Janusz; Bonita P Klein-Tasman; Jonathan M Payne; Pamela L Wolters; Heather L Thompson; Staci Martin; Peter de Blank; Nicole Ullrich; Allison Del Castillo; Maureen Hussey; Kristina K Hardy; Kristina Haebich; Tena Rosser; Mary Anne Toledo-Tamula; Karin S Walsh,Neurology,2021-08-17,10.1212/WNL.0000000000012422,abstract_only,False
PMID:8544190,Characterisation of germline mutations in the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 is one of the most common inherited disorders with an incidence of 1 in 3000. The search for NF1 mutations has been hampered by the overall size of the gene, the large number of exons, and the high mutation rate. To date, fewer than 90 mutations have been reported to the NF1 mutation analysis consortium and the details on 76 mutations have been published. We have identified five new mutations using single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and heteroduplex analysis (HA) and three intragenic deletions with the microsatellite markers. Of the five new mutations, two were in exon 27a, two in exon 45, and one in exon 49 and these include 4630delA, 4572delC, R7846X, T7828A, and one in the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR). The two nucleotide alterations in exon 27a and the one in exon 45 are predicted to produce a truncated protein.",,M Upadhyaya; J Maynard; M Osborn; S M Huson; M Ponder; B A Ponder; P S Harper,Journal of medical genetics,1995-09,10.1136/jmg.32.9.706,abstract_only,False
PMID:32699356,Murine models of IDH-wild-type glioblastoma exhibit spatial segregation of tumor initiation and manifestation during evolution.,"Recent characterization of spatiotemporal genomic architecture of IDH-wild-type multifocal glioblastomas (M-GBMs) suggests a clinically unobserved common-ancestor (CA) with a less aggressive phenotype, generating highly genetically divergent malignant gliomas/GBMs in distant brain regions. Using serial MRI/3D-reconstruction, whole-genome sequencing and spectral karyotyping-based single-cell phylogenetic tree building, we show two distinct types of tumor evolution in p53-mutant driven mouse models. Malignant gliomas/GBMs grow as a single mass (Type 1) and multifocal masses (Type 2), respectively, despite both exhibiting loss of Pten/chromosome 19 (chr19) and PI3K/Akt activation with sub-tetraploid/4N genomes. Analysis of early biopsied and multi-segment tumor tissues reveals no evidence of less proliferative diploid/2N lesions in Type 1 tumors. Strikingly, CA-derived relatively quiescent tumor precursors with ancestral diploid/2N genomes and normal Pten/chr19 are observed in the subventricular zone (SVZ), but are distantly segregated from multi focal Type 2 tumors. Importantly, PI3K/Akt inhibition by Rictor/mTORC2 deletion blocks distant dispersal, restricting glioma growth in the SVZ.","Methods Animal studies The floxed  p53  alleles ( p53 floxE2–10 ) and ( p53 LSLR172H ) have been described previously . Most of the  26 , 39 p53 null CKO ( p53 ΔE2–10 CKO, hGFAP-cre+;  p53 floxE2–10/floxE2–10 ) and  p53 R172H CKO (hGFAP-cre+;  p53 LSLR172H/floxE2–10 ) mice analyzed in this study were littermates from the breeding cross of hGFAP-cre+;  p53 LSLR172H/floxE2–10  (♂) ×  p53 floxE2–10/floxE2–10  (♀). All mice were maintained in the mixed backgrounds of C57Bl6 and 129S1/Svj.  p53 ΔE5–6 CKO (hGFAP-cre+;  p53 floxE5–6/floxE5–6 );  p53 ∆E5–6 Rictor ∆/+ CKO (hGFAP-cre+;  p53 floxE5–6/floxE5–6 ; Rictor flox/+ ) and  p53 ∆E5–6 Rictor ∆/∆ CKO (hGFAP-cre+;  p53 floxE5–6/floxE5–6 ; Rictor flox/flox ) mice have been described previously . All mice in this study were cared for according to the guidelines approved by the Animal Care and Use Committees of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and Children’s National Hospital at Washington DC. 21 , 22 MRI scans, image-guided biopsy, and image analysis MRI scans were performed on a 9.4 T, 16 cm horizontal bore (Agilent Technologies, Inc, Santa Clara, CA) Direct Drive system with a mouse head quadrature volume coil (m2m Imaging, Corp., Cleveland, OH) or mouse surface receive coil actively decoupled to a whole-body volume transmit coil (Rapid MR International, LLC., Columbus, OH). Throughout MRI experiments, animals were anesthetized with 1–2% of isoflurane/air mixture, and body temperature was maintained using a heated air system (Air-Therm Heater, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). MR images were acquired bi-monthly prior to tumor formation, weekly until biopsy and weekly thereafter until the animals were sacrificed or became moribund. Delineation of tumor growth from healthy brain tissues was determined using T2-weighted fast-spin-echo images with the following parameters: repetition time (TR)/echo time  = 3010/12 ms, field of view  = 20 × 20 mm 2 , matrix size = 256 × 128, slice thickness = 0.5 mm, 25 slices, and 2 averages. Total acquisition time was 1 min and 48 s. Biopsies were performed using pre-biopsy MRI to target tumor location, as well as post-biopsy MRI to verify accuracy of tissue collection. A fiducial marker filled with contrast agent was fixed to the bed adjacent to the head. A pre-biopsy T2-weighted image was acquired using a surface receive/volume transmit coil (Rapid MR International, LLC., Columbus, OH). X and Z coordinates relative to the fiducial marker, as well as the depth from the skull (Y coordinate) of the tumor, were determined using VnmrJ software (Agilent Technologies, Inc, Santa Clara, CA, version 3.2). The Rapid MRI bed was modified to enable attachment to the base of a bench-top stereotaxic device (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA). Mice were anesthetized just prior to biopsy with an IP injection of ketamine/xylazine. The head was shaved and eye lubricant was applied. Seventy percent of EtOH was used to sterilize the head prior to cutting. A high-speed surgical drill (The Foredom Electric Co., Bethel, CT) was mounted on the stereotaxic device and moved to the position of the fiducial marker. The drill was moved to the intended biopsy location, using the coordinates determined earlier, and a hole was drilled to allow needle insertion. The drill was removed and replaced with a 22-gauge, 3 7/8 in Samplemaster Chiba biopsy needle (Inrad, Kentwood, MI). The needle assembly was moved to the location of the hole and inserted to the top of the bevel. The needle was inserted to the previously determined depth and the needle insert was removed. A 10 ml syringe with valve attachment was fastened to the needle assembly with a section of infusion line. With the syringe plunger at 2.5 ml the valve was closed and the syringe pulled to 5 ml and locked to create a vacuum. The valve was opened for 3 s to allow the biopsy sample to be pulled up into the needle. The infusion line was removed from the syringe valve and pinched off. The needle was slowly retracted and a 10 ml syringe full of air was used to inject the sample into an Eppendorf tube for subsequent tissue culture studies or frozen for further genetic analysis. Volumes of interest were manually contoured around the hyper-intense portion of the tumors on the T2-weighted images for tumor volume measurements using in-house software (The Center for Molecular Imaging, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor) running in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA, version 2016b). In brief, tumor volumes were determined by multiplying the number of tumor voxels by the voxel volume. In each time point, the tumor size was calculated and the tumor location was recorded. 3D representations of the segmentation volume (whole brain, ventricles, or tumor) were generated using Matlab scripts, including generation of an isosurface from the binary mask, followed by curvature flow smoothing of the surface mesh . 40 PCRs and targeted Sanger sequencing For Genotyping PCR of the  p53 floxE2–10  and  p53 LSLR172H  alleles: Taq 2X MeanGreen Master Mix (Empirical Bioscience) was used in PCR experiments along with the primer sets for tail and tumor tissue genotyping. The following primers were used for the genotyping PCR for  p53 floxE2–10  allele: p53 _1F: 5′-CACAAAAAACAGGTTAAACCCAG-3′ p53 _1R: 5′-AGCACATAGGAGGCAGAGAC-3′ p53 _10R: 5′-GAAGACAGAAAAGGGGAGGG-3′ The following primers were used for the genotyping PCR for  p53 LSLR172H  allele: TO34: 5′-AGCCTGCCTAGCTTCCTCAGG-3′ TO35: 5′-CTTGGAGACATAGCCACACTG-3′ TO36: 5′-AGCTAGCCACCATGGCTTGAGTAAGTCTGCA-3′ For targeted Sanger sequencing of  p53 R172H ,  Idh1 ,  Idh2 , and  H3f3a  alleles in tumors. Total DNA and RNA were extracted from snap-frozen brain tumor samples by using Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (80204). Then the first-strand cDNA was synthesized from RNA by using Invitrogen SuperScript ®  III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix (18080-400). Regular PCR was performed to amplify the coding regions of  p53  ( NM_011640.3 ) by using primers  p53 _P1;  p53 _P2;  p53 _P3;  p53 _P4;  p53 _P7; and  p53 _P8.  Idh1  ( NM_001111320.1 ) by  Idh1 _S and  Idh1 _AS.  Idh2  ( NM_173011.2 ) by  Idh2 _S and  Idh2 _AS and  H3f3a  ( NM_008210.4 ) by  H3f3a _S and  H3f3a _AS. Then the gel-recovered PCR fragments for  p53  (the fragment amplified by P1 and P2),  Idh1 ,  Idh2 , and  H3f3a  were sequenced in the DNA sequencing core at University of Michigan by using the same primers used in PCRs (For  p53  sequencing, additional two primers  p53 _P3 and  p53 _P7 were used). Primers used here are: p53 _P1: 5′-AGGTAGCGACTACAGTTAGGGG-3′ p53 _P2: 5′-TGAAGTCATAAGACAGCAAGGAG-3′ p53 _P3: 5′-CCTGCCATCACCTCAC-3′ p53 _P4: 5′-GGAAGCCATAGTTGCC-3′ p53 _P7: 5′-GCCGGCTCTGAGTATA-3′ p53 _P8: 5′-TGTGATGATGGTAAGGA-3′ Idh1 _S: 5′-TTATTGAAGTAAAAATGTCC-3′ Idh1 _AS: 5′-TCTAAGCCCAGGTTTGAC-3′ Idh2 _S: 5′-GCCTAGAGTCCCCACCGC-3′ Idh2 _AS: 5′-CCCACCCTCTGCCATGTA-3′ H3f3a _S: 5′-ATGGCTCTTACAAAGCAG-3′ H3f3a _AS: 5′-TTAAGCACGTTCTCCG-3′ For  t (2;4) detection, targeted Sanger sequencing and real-time PCR. Based on the breakpoints analysis from WGS data, primers of  B4galt5 _S1;  B4galt5 _S2;  B4galt5 _S3;  B4galt5 _AS;  Dab1 _AS1;  Dab1 _AS2;  Dab1 _AS3 were designed and used for amplify the fragment of WT allele of Chromosome 2 and  t (2;4) from the four tumor cell lines in Mouse 2. The reference genome sequences that used to design the primers are: Chromosome 2 ( NC_000068.7 ) and Chromosome 4 ( NC_000070.6 ). Briefly, primer sets  B4galt5 _S2/ B4galt5 _AS were used to amplify the WT allele of Chromosome 2 and primer sets  B4galt5 _S2/ Dab1 _AS3;  B4galt5 _S1/ Dab1 _AS1; and  B4galt5 _S1/ Dab1 _AS2 were used to amplify the  t (2;4) fragments by using Phusion ®  High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (M0530, NEB). Then the PCR products were sent out for sequencing at GENEWIZ, Inc by using the same primers used in PCRs. The primers used here are: B4galt5 _S1: 5′-CGGCAGGTCAGTGATAAGAAAC-3′ B4galt5 _S2: 5′-GAAATTCCTCTAGTCAGAGGGTC-3′ B4galt5 _S3: 5′-AGGACTTCAAGGAAAGGTAGCTCAG-3′ B4galt5 _AS: 5′-TAGGACAGGCTAGTCCCAGAAC-3′ Dab1 _AS1: 5′-CTCCTTGGAACTGCTCTGACT-3′ Dab1 _AS2: 5′-TCCAGAGCAGTCACCAATAGAC-3′ Dab1 _AS3: 5′-ATCCTTCAAATGCCCCTTGTCC-3′ For real-time PCR, depending on the sample concentration, various amounts of template genomic DNAs (average 100 ng/reaction) from early passage tumor cell lines of SVZ L , SVZ R  (from Mouse 2) and a tumor without  t (2;4) as control along with the SYBR Select Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and the following primers sets were used in real-time PCR. See primers information in Supplementary Table  2 . t (2;4) band:  B4galt5 _S1/ Dab1 _AS1 or  B4galt5 _S2/ Dab1 _AS3 WT Chromosome 2 band (wt):  B4galt5 _S3/ B4galt5 _AS GAPDH band:  GAPDH _Forward/ GAPDH _Reverse GAPDH _Forward: 5′-ACCCAGAAGACTGTGGATGG-3′ GAPDH _Reverse: 5′-CACATTGGGGGTAGGAACAC-3′ CT value (CT testGene  − CT reference ) and then [1/CT 2 ] is calculated for each sample using GAPDH as the reference. The ratio of  t (2;4) band with WT Chromosome 2 band in SVZ L  tumor was signed with “1” based on the homogeneous near-2N population observed in SKY analysis which has one copy of  t (2;4) and one copy of WT Chromosome 2, then the ratio of  t (2;4)/wt in other samples was calculated. BrdU assay for the analysis of proliferation in adult brains To label the proliferating cells in adult brains, mice were injected with 50 µg of BrdU per gram of body weight. In all, 5–7-month-old mice were received five injections, with multiple injections applied at 2-h intervals. All of the mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) 2 h after the final BrdU injection. Then the samples were processed as described below for future analysis. Tissue preparation, histopathology, and tumor diagnosis Mice were aged until signs of distress appeared. Then, mice were perfused with 4% PFA and brains were dissected, followed by overnight post-fixation in 4% PFA at 4 °C. Brains were divided into two hemispheres along the midline and each hemisphere was then processed for either paraffin-embedded or cryostat sections. At some conditions, brains were also coronally cut and then processed. Serial sections from the side of brain which has the major tumor mass were sagittally or coronally prepared at 5 μm for paraffin sections. Typically, we began to collect the brain sections when the complete brain structure from middle line was shown as Section 1. For each slide, we collected four continuous brain sections. Total 31 slides were collected for each half brain. Then slides #1, #11, #21, and #31 were stained with H&E for tumor analysis. Stained sections were independently examined under a light microscope by Y.L. and C.Y.H. Tumor grading was first diagnosed by Y.L. by using the same criteria as previously described . Then all the tumors were further diagnosed and confirmed by C.Y.H. based upon the WHO grading system for malignant astrocytic glioma, GBM, and medulloblastoma 21 , 22 . Adjacent sections were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis (see below). 2 Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence Paraffin sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated. Adjacent sections were subjected to immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analysis as previously described . The visualization of primary antibodies was performed with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) system using a diaminobenzidine-based (DAB) peroxidase substrate (Vectastain ABC kit, Vector). The visualization of the primary antibodies in immunofluorescence was performed with the use of the Alexa488, Alexa555, and Alexa647 conjugated secondary antibodies (A11004, A11034 for Alexa488; A21429, A21424 for Alexa555; A31571, A21236, A21247, A21245 for Alexa647; 1:400, Invitrogen, Life Technologies). DAPI was used as a counterstain to label individual cell nuclei. The primary antibodies used in this study were: rabbit anti-p53 (NCL- 21 , 22 p53 -CM5p, 1:1000, Leica Biosystems), mouse anti-Ki67 (550609, 1:500, BD Pharmingen), rabbit anti-Olig2 (AB9610, 1:2000, EMD Millipore), Guinea pig anti-Olig2 (1:10000, a kind gift of home-made antibody from Dr. B. Novitch), mouse anti-GFAP (556330, 1:2000, BD Pharmingen), rabbit anti-Pten (9559S, 1:1000, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-p-S6 (5364S, 1:2000, Cell Signaling), rat anti-BrdU (ab6326, 1:500, Abcam), rabbit anti-p-Erk (9101S, 1:2000, Cell Signaling), mouse anti-Ascl1 (556604, 1:100-1:200, BD PharMingen), rabbit anti-Ezh2 (5246S, 1:1000–1:2000, Cell Signaling), and rabbit anti-BLBP (ab32423, 1:200, Abcam). Sections were examined under a light and fluorescent microscope (Olympus BX-63). Pten expression and pS6 expression were quantified based on the qualitative estimate of the ratio of Pten +  or p-S6 +  cells. High: most of the cells are Pten +  or p-S6 + , the ratio of Pten +  or p-S6 +  cells is estimated >80%; Medium: mixed areas of Pten +  and Pten −  cells or p-S6 +  and p-S6 −  cells; Low: most of the cells are Pten −  or p-S6 − , the ratio of Pten +  or p-S6 +  cells is estimated <10%. Determination of Type 1 and Type 2 brains For MRI study, the location of each tumor was recorded and the number of tumor lesions was quantified for each of the detectable lesions based on MRI. After collection at the end stage, histological analysis was performed on the brains and the tumor location was further recorded and compared to MRI data. For histological analysis, we excluded rare samples that have medulloblastoma in the hindbrain and focused on brains with glioma only. We analyzed these brain samples on four sagittal planes each ~200 μm apart, and documented the locations/size of each tumor foci on H&E stained slides. If we saw multiple tumor foci with clear margins throughout the slides, we then considered that brain as multifocal lesions. Brains with only one core tumor mass throughout the slides analyzed were considered as single lesion. In some cases, tumors appeared multifocal lesions on one slide but were merged on other slide(s). These brains were considered as single lesion as well. Western blotting analysis Snap-frozen tissues from normal brains and tumors were homogenized in 1X SDS loading buffer [50 mM Tris-HCL (pH6.8), 2% SDS, 0.05% bromophenol blue, 10% glycerol, 100 mM β-mercaptoethanol]. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes (EMD Millipore). The blots were then blocked in 5% nonfat milk in TBST, followed by incubation of primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. After washing, the blots were incubated in HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1706515; 1706516, BioRad) at room temperature for 1 h. Signals were detected using ECL or ECL plus (GE healthcare) followed by film development. The primary antibodies used are as follows: rabbit anti-p53 (NCL- p53 -CM5p, 1:1000, Leica Biosystems), rabbit anti-p-Akt(T308) (2965S, 1:1000, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-p-Akt(S473) (4060L, 1:1000, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-Akt (9272S, 1:2000, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-Pten (9559S, 1:1000, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-p-S6 (5364S, 1:2000, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-S6 (2217S, 1:2000, Cell Signaling), mouse anti-p120 (Anti-Ras-GAP, 610040, 1:1000, BD Biosciences), rabbit anti-Nf1 (SC-67, 1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and mouse anti-β-Actin (A5316, 1:20000, Sigma-Aldrich). Establishment of primary tumor and SVZ cell lines Tumor(s) and/or SVZ(s) were carefully dissected from the brains and placed into fresh Opti-MEM medium (Gibco by Life Technologies). Then the cells were centrifuged and dissociated with pre-warmed TrypLE select (1×) solution (Gibco by Life Technologies) for 20 min at 37 °C (a firm shake by hand every few minutes to break up clumps). NSC culture medium was a mixture of DMEM-low glucose: Neurobasal medium (Gibco by Life Technologies, 60.2 and 35.8 mL per 100 mL separately) supplemented with 20 ng/mL human bFGF (Sigma), 20 ng/mL EGF (Sigma), 1% N2 supplement (Gibco by Life Technologies), 2% B27 supplement (Gibco by Life Technologies), 50 μM 2-Mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and 1% penicillin Streptomycin (Gibco by Life Technologies). After incubation, the cells were centrifuged and then gently resuspended into NSC medium and filtered through a 70 µm nylon cell strainer. The cells were centrifuged again and resuspended with NSC medium. After counting, the cells were transferred into ultra-low binding six-well plates (Corning) with the NSC medium which has been prepared and equilibrated in a humidified incubator (5% CO2, balance air) for at least 1 h. In all, 2000–5000 cells were seeded per well and allowed for spheres formation. Fresh medium was added every 3 days during the sphere culture. Cell lines were passaged every 7–10 days. Cell dispersal, fixation, staining, and flow cytometry The procedure to detect the ploidy information from snap-frozen tissues by flow cytometry was based on a published protocol  with some modifications. Briefly, tissue samples, previously snap-frozen in −80 °C, were thawed in cold PBS. Then the samples were mechanically dispersed using pre-cleaned microscope slides (Fisher Scientific #12-550-343) and passed through the 70 µm nylon cell strainers (BD Falcon #352350). After centrifugation, the cell pellet was washed with cold PBS for two times and then suspended in 0.5 ml cold PBS. 5 ml of 70% ethanol stored at −20 °C was added dropwise under constant gentle vortexing. Samples were incubated for 30 min on ice and subsequently overnight at −20 °C before being subject to staining. Samples were centrifuged and washed with cold PBS two times before the cells were suspended in an appropriate volume (0.3–1 ml) of staining solution (PBS which contains 30 µg/ml propidium iodide and 0.3 mg/ml DNase-free RNase A) for 30 min at 37 °C. Then the samples were acquired using BD FACS Canto II and further analyzed by FlowJo software. Normal cerebral cortex was used as control for normal diploid DNA content. 41 Metaphase spread, spectral karyotype (SKY) analysis To prepare metaphase spread, early passage cell lines from primary tumors or SVZ areas were cultured in NSC medium and incubated in 0.1 mg/ml KaryoMAX colcemid solution (Gibco by Life Technologies) for 2–3 h. Cells were collected, washed with PBS and then dissociated to single-cell suspension. The cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 75 mM potassium chloride solution (Gibco by Life Technologies, pre-warmed to 37 °C) and incubated at 37 °C for 18–20 min. Then the cells were fixed with ice-cold fixative solution (3:1 methanol (Fisher Chemical, A454-4): glacial acetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, A6283-500ml)) and dropped onto glass slides. The slides were either stained with DAPI for further chromosome number counting or subjected to SKY analysis. For chromosome number counting, the metaphase images were captured using the fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX-63) and the chromosome number was counted using ImageJ software. SKY analysis was performed by using a mouse SKY probe kit (Applied Spectral Imaging, Vista, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, followed by counterstaining with DAPI. Metaphase images were captured and analyzed by HiSKYV spectral imaging system from Applied Spectral Imaging. For each metaphase, the copy number of each chromosome and all the abnormal chromosomal structural events including translocations and fusions were recorded. Mouse Chromosome 19 fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was performed on dropped metaphase by using mouse Chr19 probe (XMP 19 orange, D-1419-050-OR, MetaSystems) according to the manufacture’s protocol, followed by counterstaining with DAPI. Metaphase images were captured and analyzed by HiSKYV spectral imaging system from Applied Spectral Imaging. Chr19 copy number in each metaphase from Fish assay was counted for further analysis. Determination of whole-genome duplication (WGD) Although focal amplifications could in principle increase tumor ploidy to 2.5, computational analysis suggests that this is rare. Data from pan-cancer analysis showed tumors with versus without WGD were clearly separated at Ploidy 2.5 (Human,  n  = 55 chromosomes) . Furthermore, we investigated the distribution of chromosome numbers in human high-grade gliomas (including Grade III gliomas and Grade IV gliomas/GBMs) using cytogenetic data collected by the Mitelman database (Supplementary Fig.  27 2d ). The data clearly showed the bimodal distribution for WGD and non-WGD tumors with chromosome counts around 55 (ploidy 2.5) as a cutoff. In our cytogenetic data, we confirmed that this bimodal distribution and the same ploidy 2.5 ( n  = 50) were indeed an excellent cutoff value to separate the two modes (Supplementary Fig.  2c ). Thus, we used ploidy 2.5 (50 chromosomes in mouse cells) to separate WGD and non-WGD tumors from our GEM models. NRT sharing matrix The sample-wise NRT sharing matrix is calculated in the following manner: if two samples share NRT, the corresponding entry in the matrix is the positive number of shared NRTs; otherwise it is zero. In order to quantify the likelihood of inter-lineage NRT sharing, we calculate  p  = P (metaphases A and B belong to different lineages A and B share NRT) using bootstrap. We randomly sample 100,000 pairs of metaphases from a total of 722 metaphases pooling 21 lineages analyzed by SKY. Let  n  denote the number of pairs sharing NRT,  r n  denote the number of pares sharing NRT and belong to different animals (lineages), and  d n  denote the number of animals, then  a p  =  n / d n /( r n  − 1) = 0.000036. The factor 1/( a n  − 1) is the normalization constant to ensure that selecting inter-lineage pair has the same probability of selecting intra-lineage pair. a SKY-based single-cell phylogenetic tree building We used copy number of each individual chromosome, copy number of large-scale chromosomal alterations such as translocations/fusions and ploidy in each metaphase obtained from SKY analysis to build NJ trees for each sample, based on the pairwise distance between each two metaphases. We developed R codes and used RStudio (version 1.2.5033), R package “Analyses of Phylogenetics and Evolution” (APE, version 5.2), and MEGAX (version 0.1, for MAC) to generate SKY-based phylogenetic trees. Briefly, we used the following three steps to build SKY-based single-cell phylogenetic tree. Step 1—feature selection: SKY method provides the chromosome profile for each individual cell: copy number of each individual chromosome, copy number of large-scale chromosomal alterations such as translocations/fusions and ploidy. All these chromosomal events will be used for the tree building. Step 2—distance measure selection and distance matrix calculation: to build the tree, we first convert each of the chromosomal events into a distance measurement. We assigned every chromosomal event (e.g., gain or loss) at weight of “1” with two exceptions. First, since the phylogenetic tree is built on the lineage tracing of a FC harboring at least one cNRT 2N (s), we gave a higher weight of “5” for the de novo acquisition of an NRT from one cell without the NRT to become the NRT-bearing cell. The rationale for an NRT with the highest weight is based on the same breakpoint at the single-nucleotide level. This feature makes it highly unlikely to reproduce the exact NRT in different cell lineages, and thus is considered a unique/non-sharing identifier. Second, we considered WGD as a single genetic event and thus gave a weight of “1” instead of “40,” due to duplication of all 40 chromosomes from one genetic process (see the “Methods” section for details). For example, a cell acquiring cNRT 2  (at 2N stage) and subsequently undergoing WGD with two copies of the cNRT 2N  receives a weight of “6” (NRT + WGD = “5 + 1”) instead of “10” (NRT + NRT = “5 + 5”). Then we developed the R code to calculate the distance between each pair of metaphases based on the above principle. See detailed information of distance calculation in the attached R code. Step 3—NJ tree building: from Step 2, we generated the distance matrix of all the metaphases from each sample, then we developed the R code to reconstruct the NJ trees based on the distance matrix by using the R package “APE” (version 5.2) under the minimum evolution principle . To identify the direction of evolution requires an outgroup, which is a normal progenitor cell without any chromosomal aberration. We add one normal euploid cell and assign it to be the ancestry (CONTROL). See detailed information of NJ tree building in the attached R code. 42 We built the NJ tree for tumor cells derived from each site of all Type 2 cases in which each dot in the tree represents a single proliferating cell/clone. The distance between any two cells on the tree is the consequence of minimal numbers of chromosomal events. The distance between every tumor cell and the normal 2N cell (germline) represents the number of somatic chromosomal events accumulated during tumor evolution. Thus, the cell carrying the fewest chromosomal event(s) is located at the distance closest to the normal 2N cell, representing the earliest evolutionary stage. Conversely, the cell carrying the most chromosomal events is most distant to the normal 2N cell, representing the latest stage of tumor evolution. Clonal evolution interpretation from SKY-based trees To illustrate the clonal evolution from different samples in each animal, we first illustrated the clonal evolution for each sample based on its single-cell phylogenetic tree built above. Briefly, we delineated tumor evolution for each sample by identifying a small number of clonally related cNRT 2N -bearing FCs, which gradually accumulated one or more chromosomal events. Once the genotypes of all FCs were identified for each tumor site, we used two criteria to determine the evolutionary direction of FCs carrying the same cNRT(s): (1) an irreversible transition by WGD followed by random loss of chromosomes (from a near-2N to sub-4N clone) and (2) the transition from simple to more complex genomes defined by accumulation of additional chromosomal events, including the universal loss of Pten/chr19 in parenchymal tumors in all Type 1 and Type 2 cases. Lastly, we compared the genotypes of all the FCs from each sample in each animal, and illustrated their clonal relationship/evolution order based on the most parsimonious order of their occurrences. Gene expression analysis RNA extracted from 11  p53 null CKO glioma samples and 11  p53 R172H CKO primary tumors (of which each paired with a primary tumor-derived cell line), 2 early biopsies and 5 normal dorsal cortical tissues from control mice (3 from hGFAP-Cre+;  p53 floxE2–10/+  mice and 2 from hGFAP-Cre−;  p53 floxE5–6/floxE5–6  mice) were sent out for gene expression analysis in the DNA sequencing core at the University of Michigan. mRNA expression was profiled using Affymetrix GeneChip mouse genome 430 2.0 array, including 45K probes genome-wide. Dr. Johnson from University of Michigan DNA sequencing core, performed background correction, quantile normalization and gene expression robust multi-array average calculation for the 40 arrays using IVT Express kit and customized R codes. To define the subtypes of the malignant gliomas and GBMs from out GEM models, we used the classification system established by Verhaak et al. , which defined four signatures with a total of 840 discriminative genes (210 genes for each signature), classifying GBMs into four subtypes, proneural, neural, classical, and mesenchymal. We used a Pearson correlation by comparing the expression pattern of these 840 feature genes between our GEM gliomas/glioma-derived cell lines and individual human GBMs with the known subtypes in the TCGA data sets. A positive correlation suggests that a given GEM tumor most resembles the GBM subtype based on its expression of the feature genes. 43 Alternatively, we further applied an enrichment-based method using the same feature genes. This method, called single sample gene set enrichment analysis, was used to predict GBM subtypes from >500 human GBMs in a recent TCGA study (Brennan et al.  cell). Primarily, this method serves to aggregate the expression of the feature genes into a score, which reflects the overall activity of the feature genes and thus the represents a specific subtype. 1 The human proneural subtype GBMs can be further divided into  IDH1/2 -WT non-G-CIMP GBMs and  IDH1/2- mutant G-CIMP + GBMs. A recent study defined a set of best gene expression classifiers for these two groups in human GBMs . We used the top 200 genes (89 found in mouse genes) to study the relationship between mouse and human GBM methylation subtypes. Similarity between samples was measured using Pearson correlation. 24 Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on bulk tumor samples Total 31 samples (including tails, paired tumor and SVZ cell lines, and/or primary tumors) from six Type 2 cases were performed whole-genome DNA sequencing analysis. Briefly, genomic DNA was extracted with Allprep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The library preparation and sequencing were done by the company. Among them, total of ten samples from two mice (Mice 2 and 3) were performed using Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform in the DNA sequencing core, University of Michigan. The sequencing coverage ranges from 8 to 13×, with an average of 10×. The remaining 21 samples from 4 mice (Mice 4, 5, 6 and 10) were performed using Illumina HiSeq X Ten platform from Novogene, with average of 30X sequencing coverage. Raw sequencing reads are first filtered to remove contaminated and low-quality reads. Burrows–Wheeler Aligner  (version 0.7.8) was utilized to map the paired-end clean reads to the mouse reference genome (mm9). SAMtools 44  (version 1.0) is used for sorting the BAM file, and Picard (version 1.111) is utilized to mark duplicate reads. Single-nucleotide variant is then identified using GATK 45  (version 3.8), and is subsequently annotated using ANNOVAR 46  (version 2015Dec). CNV is detected by control-FREEC 47  (version 9.9). 48 CNV analysis and comparison with SKY data Genomic CNV profiles of WGS data are identified by control-FREEC software, and then comparison of whole-chromosome CNV estimation (measured in log2 ratio) in Mice 1–4 between SKY and WGS is performed. For each chromosome in each mouse, the median log2 ratio is calculated for all 10-kb bins from WGS. For SKY, the log2 ratio is calculated as log2( ci /median( c )), where  ci  is the average count for chromosome  i , and  c  is the median of  ci  for all chromosomes ( i  = 1–19;X). Single-cell cloning preparation with subsequent WGS The early passage SVZ R  tumor cell line (P1) from Mouse 2 was dissociated and single cells were seeded into 96-well plate. Total 31 single spheres were formed and then progressively expanded. The DNA content (ploidy) of each single clone was determined by Flow Cytometry. Then eight clones with near-2N genome and seven clones with sub-4N genome were further chosen based on  t (2;4) status. Among them, four clones with near-2N genome (two with  t (2;4) and two without  t (2;4)) and three clones with sub-4N genome (two with  t (2;4) and one without  t (2;4)) were subjected to subsequent WGS at Novogene as described above. CNV tree reconstruction from WGS data on single clones We built NJ trees from WGS data on single clones, based on the pairwise distance matrix estimated from CNV profiles. Briefly, control-FREEC provides the average copy number estimation (measured by log2 ratio) for every 10-kb sliding window in the chromosome, and the distance between two clones  a  and  b  is calculated as  , where  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The NJ tree is then built similar with the tree built from SKY data (see the section “SKY-based single-cell phylogenetic tree building” above). Manual CNV tree reconstruction from WGS data on bulk cells The genomic CNV profiles of WGS data were used to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree. Briefly, we first identified specific CNV events, defined as events whose boundaries can be identified precisely within the resolution of Control-FREEC CNV detection (10 kb). Then, shared specific events were identified, defined as events with identical boundaries, in at least two samples. Whole-chromosome gain or loss was excluded as they were considered nonspecific events. We then determined the possible temporal order of these events. Known oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes  were also marked if these genes fall within the boundary of the CNV events. Finally, a manual tree was drawn, with the length of the trunk (or branch) proportional to the number of shared (or private) events between samples, respectively. The events used for reconstructing the tree were listed in the Source Data file. 49 Image processing and figure assembling Adobe photoshop (version CS6) and ImageJ (version 1.52q) were used for image processing. Adobe illustrator (version CS6) was used for figure assembling. Quantification methods and statistical analyses We used GraphPad 6 and 8 for all the statistical analyses. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were used to compare the survivorship of the mice sacrificed due to brain tumors, soft tissue sarcomas, and/or other health concerns and the Mantel–Cox (Log-rank) test was used to statistically compare the overall survival (Fig.  1b ). Unpaired, two-tailed Student’s  t  test was used to compare the statistical difference of  Pdgfrα  mRNA level from microarray data (Supplementary Fig.  1n ); the NRT/fusion frequency (Fig.  2d  and Supplementary Fig.  2i ); the dominant NRT/fusion frequency (Fig.  2e  and Supplementary Fig.  2h ); the proliferation index (Fig.  3f ); the frequency of non-cNRTs and NRTs in Type 1 and Type 2 tumors (Fig.  3g, h ); the number of BrdU +  cells; the number of p-Erk +  cells and the ratio of p-Erk + BrdU + /p-Erk +  cells (Fig.  7d ); and the number of p-Erk + Olig2 +  cells (Fig.  7i ). Fisher’s exact test was used to compare the statistical difference of the frequency of human GBMs with WGD (Supplementary Fig.  2c ); the frequency of brains with early tumor cluster(s) (Fig.  8e ); the frequency of mouse brains with multifocal lesions (Fig.  8h ) and the frequency of mouse brains with tumors directly associated with the SVZ only (Fig.  8i ). Data were presented as standard error of the mean (SEM), and  p  < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant in all of the statistical analyses.

PMID:32461556,Assessing the origin of high-grade serous ovarian cancer using CRISPR-modification of mouse organoids.,"High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HG-SOC)-often referred to as a ""silent killer""-is the most lethal gynecological malignancy. The fallopian tube (murine oviduct) and ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) are considered the main candidate tissues of origin of this cancer. However, the relative contribution of each tissue to HG-SOC is not yet clear. Here, we establish organoid-based tumor progression models of HG-SOC from murine oviductal and OSE tissues. We use CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to introduce mutations into genes commonly found mutated in HG-SOC, such as Trp53, Brca1, Nf1 and Pten. Our results support the dual origin hypothesis of HG-SOC, as we demonstrate that both epithelia can give rise to ovarian tumors with high-grade pathology. However, the mutated oviductal organoids expand much faster in vitro and more readily form malignant tumors upon transplantation. Furthermore, in vitro drug testing reveals distinct lineage-dependent sensitivities to the common drugs used to treat HG-SOC in patients.","Methods Mice Wild-type  C57BL/6  and  B6J.129(B6N)-Gt(ROSA)26Sor  (JAX stock #026175) tm1(CAG-cas9*,-EGFP)Fezh/J  mice strains were used for derivation of wild-type and  36 Cas9/GFP -expressing organoids, respectively. For mutant organoid transplantations, NOD scid gamma ( NSG; NOD.Cg-Prkdc 
 scid Il2rg tm1Wjl /SzJ  mice were used. Transplantation experiments were performed after institutional review by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW) with project license of AVD8010020151 and research protocol HI17.1001. Human specimens The patient tumor material was collected from consenting patients undergoing surgical resection at the University Medical Center (UMC) Utrecht Hospital. Tissue collection was approved by the medical ethical committee UMC Utrecht under the biobanking protocol: 14-472 HUB-OVI. All patients participating in this study signed the informed consent forms. Derivation of oviductal organoids For organoid derivation, ovaries and oviducts were dissected from mice and carefully separated under the stereo microscope. Oviducts were first placed into a collagenase solution (1 mg/mL of collagenase from  Clostridium histolyticum , Sigma, C9407) in AdDF+++ (advanced DMEM/F12 supplemented with 1x Glutamax, 10 mM HEPES and penicillin-streptomycin, all from Invitrogen) with ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632, 10 µM). The tissue was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h while shaking followed by vigorous mechanical sharing using a fire-polished glass pipette and centrifugation for 5 min at 450 ×  g . The material was further digested with TrypLE (Gibco, Cat. 12605-010) for 5 min at 37 °C, washed several times with ice-cold AdDF+++ and embedded in Basement Membrane Extract (Cultrex ®  BME RGF type 2, Amsbio, Cat. 3533-005-02). The cell-BME suspension was plated on a pre-warmed suspension culture plate (Greiner) and allowed to solidify at 37 °C for 30 min before addition of medium. The basal culture medium for oviductal organoids includes 20% R-spondin conditioned medium (made in-house), 1% Noggin conditioned medium (U Protein Express), 1x B27 (Gibco), 1.25 mM n-Acetylcystein (Sigma), 50 ng/ml EGF (Peprotech), and 500 nM A83-01 (Tocris). WNT inhibitor IWP2 (3 μM, Stemgent) was used for showing WNT-independency of oviductal organoids. For induction of ciliogenesis, DAPT (10 µM, Tocris) was added to the WNT-deprived culture medium and analysis was performed 2 weeks after the start of the treatment. The organoids could be reproducibly derived from over four independent isolations. Derivation of OSE organoids Ovaries were subjected to more gentle treatment with pronase solution (1 mg/ml of Pronase E, Sigma) in AdDF+++ with ROCK inhibitor at 37 °C for 30 min while shaking. This method allows removal of OSE cells from the surface of the ovaries while leaving rest of the tissue intact. After digestion the ovaries were gently sheared a few hundred times by using an adjusted 1-ml pipette tip (tip hole needs to be cut large enough for the ovaries to enter without breaking them) to detach the loosened OSE sheets from the surface of the ovaries. Next, the supernatant containing epithelial fragments was transferred to another tube, pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 450 ×  g  and further digested with TrypLE for 5 min at 37 °C. After several washes with ice-cold AdDF+++, the cells were embedded in BME and plated on pre-warmed culture plates as described above. The minimal required medium for OSE organoids contains all the factors present in the oviductal organoid medium (see above), but is additionally supplemented with 50% conditioned WNT3a (made in-house) and 0.1 μM β-Estradiol (Sigma). Addition of FGF2 during initial passages can improve the organoid outgrowth. WNT inhibitor IWP2 was used for demonstrating WNT-dependency of OSE organoids. For ciliogenesis assay, cultures were grown in the presence of DAPT for 2 weeks until analysis. The organoids could be reproducibly derived from over four independent isolations. Organoid growth assay Organoids were removed from BME and trypsinized with TrypLE. Cells were washed in medium and passed through a 40 μm cell strainer to ensure a single-cell suspension. Cells were diluted in trypan blue to exclude dead cells and counted using a haemocytometer. One-thousand cells were plated with 5-μl BME drops into 48-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, 677102) and overlaid with 250-μl medium. Images of the organoids were taken every day for a week, organoid sizes were measured (12 organoids per line) using ImageJ software (version 1.51j8). Subsequently, from the resulting data, the growth curves were constructed in Microsoft Excel 2019. Experiment was repeated twice. Flow cytometry To assess the apoptosis in organoids, the cells were stained and analyzed by flow cytometry. Organoids were collected and dissociated into single-cell suspension via trypsinization. The cells were stained with Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit (88-8007-72, eBioscience) according to the manufacturer′s instructions. A BD FACSCanto II system was used to analyze the samples. The assay was performed twice. The gating strategy is provided in the Supplementary Fig.  5 . Immunohistochemistry Tissues were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C followed by dehydration and paraffin embedding. To prepare organoids for histological stainings, intact BME drops containing organoids were collected from the culture plates and incubated in Cell Recovery Solution (Corning, Cat. 354253) on ice for 30 min, occasionally inverting the tube, to dissolve BME. Organoids were then allowed to settle to the bottom of the tube by free gravitation, supernatant removed and the material fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 1 h. After fixation, the organoids were washed in PBS, and embedded into paraffin blocks. Sections were cut and hydrated before staining. Sections were subjected to H&E staining or immunohistochemistry by using antibodies listed in the Table  2 . The images were acquired on Leica DM4000 microscope and processed using Leica LAS X software. Table 2 Antibody specifications.

About 16 h later, organoids were harvested and fixed in 4% formalin overnight at 4 °C. Prior to the whole-mount staining, the fixed organoids were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton-X (Sigma), 2% donkey serum (BioRad) in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C and blocked with 0.1% Tween-20 (Sigma) and 2% donkey serum in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Subsequently, organoids were stained with mouse anti-γH2A.X primary antibody (1:500, Millipore, clone JBW301) overnight at 4 °C, followed by four washes with PBS and incubation with secondary goat anti-mouse AF-647 antibody (1:250, Thermo Fisher, catalog number A-21235) for 2 h at room temperature in the dark and washed again with PBS. DAPI was used to counterstain nuclei. Organoids were mounted and imaged on an SP8 confocal microscope (Leica). Fluorescent microscopic images of γH2A.X were quantified as follows: Based on the staining, the nuclei were classified as γH2A.X-positive or -negative. The fraction of positively stained nuclei over all nuclei is displayed as one datapoint per organoid. At least 10 organoids were quantified per line over two independent experiments. Karyotyping About 2–3 days after splitting of the organoids, the cultures were treated with 0.1 μg/mL colcemid (Gibco, Cat. 15210-040) added to the culture media for 6 h. Organoids were then collected and dissociated into single cells using TrypLE. Single cells were swollen by addition of pre-warmed 75 mM KCl and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Cells were fixed by slow drop-wise addition of ice-cold methanol:acetic acid (3:1) while gently tapping the cell suspension. Slides were mounted with DAPI-containing Vectashield, imaged on a DM6000 Leica microscope with a ×100 objective, and quantified by manual chromosome counting. At least 15 spreads per clone were analyzed. Organoid transfection and genotyping For generating mutant organoid lines for selected genes ( Trp53 ,  Brca1 ,  Nf1 , and  Pten ), the CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing was used. The single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were designed by using the CRISPR Design tool (Zhang Lab, MIT). For all the genes two separate sgRNAs were designed, and, based on the in vitro screening assay, the better performing sgRNA was chosen for each gene for the following organoid experiments. The sequences of the final sgRNAs are shown in the Table  3 . Table 3 Sequences targeted by designed sgRNAs. Gene Exon (F—forward, R—reverse) Targeted sequence Trp53 Exon 3, F AAGTCACAGCACATGACGG Brca1 Exon 6, F GCGTCGATCATCCAGAGCGT Nf1 Exon 8, F CCAGGACATCTCCAAGGATG Pten Exon 6, R ATATACATAGCGCCTCTGAC For organoid transfection experiments about 640 μl of BME with  Cas9 -expressing oviductal or OSE organoids were collected from the plate (about 4/12-wells) and dissociated into single cells using TrypLE, washed with AdDF++ (without antibiotics), resuspended in high-density in 500 μl of growth medium with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor (without antibiotics) and transferred to a well on a 24-well culture plate. The sgRNA transfection was performed by using the Stemfect RNA Transfection Kit (Stemgent) according to the manufacturer′s instructions. Briefly, 12.5 μl of transfection buffer was mixed together with 1 μl of transfection reagent and incubated at room temperature for 10 min followed by addition of the sgRNA mixture containing 12.5 μl of transfection buffer and 5 μg of appropriate sgRNAs. The total volume of transfection mixture (ca 25 μl) was incubated at room temperature for 15 min before adding it to the cell suspension and the plate was placed in a humidified incubator at 37 °C for 4–5 h. After incubation, cells were collected and plated according to the standard protocol and covered with full medium containing 10 μM ROCK inhibitor. Around 2–3 days post transfection, the medium was exchanged with the growth medium containing 10 µM Nutlin-3a (Cayman Chemical) to select for p53 mutant organoids. Within two weeks clonal organoid outgrowth could be readily observed, the organoids were picked, expanded and screened for mutations in targeted genes. If the triple mutants were not obtained after the first round of transfection, an additional transfection was performed. For genotyping, genomic DNA was isolated using DirectPCR lysis reagent (Viagen). Primers for the PCR amplification using GoTaq Flexi DNA polymerase (Promega) were as follows: Trp53_for, 5′-CAGGAAGCCAAAGGGTGAAGA-3′, Trp53_rev, 5′-CCCATCTACAGTCCCCCTTG-3′; Brca1_for, 5′-TGGAGTGCAAGTGAAAGCCT-3′, Brca1_rev, 5′-ACCGACAATTAAGATGGAGTGCT-3′; Nf1_for, 5′- CCCGGGAAACTATCAGCCTT-3′, Nf1_rev, 5′-CTGTTTGACCTAGCATGGACA-3′; Pten_for, 5′- TGCAGTACAGAGACCATTGACT-3′, Pten_rev, 5′-CGACACACAGACAGCTAAGAA-3′. Products were cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector system I (Promega) and subsequently Sanger sequenced by Macrogen Europe (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) using universal T7 sequencing primer. Western blot Organoids were treated with 10 µM Nutlin-3a to activate p53 pathway 24 h prior to the harvesting. Samples were lysed using RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% Na-Deoxycholate, 1% NP-40) containing Complete protease inhibitors (Roche). Protein content was quantified using standard Bradford assay (BioRad) and equal amounts of protein (a′ 20 µg) were run on gradient polyacrylamide gel (4–15%; BioRad) and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked and probed with antibodies directed against p53 (sc-6243, 1:250, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and GAPDH (LN2100751, 1:1000, Labned). Uncropped versions of the western blots are provided in the Supplementary Fig.  6 . The results were confirmed twice. RNA isolation, cDNA preparation, and qRT-PCR For qPCR analysis, RNA was isolated from organoids and tissues using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Cat. 74104) following the manufacturer′s instructions including DNaseI treatment. For qPCR, RNA was reverse transcribed from 500 ng of total RNA using GoScript and random primer (both Promega). qPCR was performed with three biological replicates in duplicates using the indicated primers, SYBR Green Mixture (BioRad) and BioRad CFX Manager Version 3.1. Gene expression was quantified using the delta-delta-Ct method and normalized against β-Actin housekeeping gene. qPCR primers used in this study were as follows: β-Actin_for, 5′-GTCGAGTCGCGTCCACC-3′, β-Actin_rev, 5′-GTCATCCATGGCGAACTGGT-3′; Pax8_for, 5′-GATGCCTCACAACTCGATCA-3′, Pax8_rev, 5′-AAGGATCTTGCTTACACAGC-3′; Foxj1_for, 5′-ACCAAGATCACTCTGTCGG-3′, Foxj1_rev, 5′-GATGGAATTCTGCCAGGTG-3′; Dnah5_for, 5′-ATGGACTGACTTCTCGCCTC-3′, Dnah5_rev, 5′-GTCGTTGCGTCAGAACTCG-3′; Trp73_for, 5′-GGGAGCAACAGGCTCTGAAT-3′; Trp73_rev, 5′-GCTCTGCTTGAATGCACGTT-3′. Library preparation and RNA-seq analysis For RNA-seq analysis, RNA was isolated from the organoids and tissues using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions or standard Tryzol extraction protocol, respectively. In both cases DNaseI treatment was included. In vitro transcription was performed using 1–5 ng cDNA as template and RNA was reverse transcribed into a sequencing library. After preparation, the quality and quantity of the libraries were checked with Bioanalyzer2100 DNA High Sensitivity chips (Cat. 5067-4626) and Qubit (Qubit ®  dsDNA HS Assay Kit, Cat. Q32854); all samples had a RIN value of 10. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina NextSeq500 by using 75-bp paired-end sequencing. Paired-end reads from Illumina sequencing were aligned to the mouse genome (GRCm38 assembly) with BWA . The raw data file consists of a total number of reads for each gene (without UMI correction) that were uniquely mapped to the transcriptome (with a mapping quality above 60), and that had the appropriate transcription direction. DESeq2 (v1.18.0) package was used to normalize count data and for differential gene expression analysis in program R (R version 3.5.1, Bioconductor version 3.8 (BiocManager 1.30.4)). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed using GSEA software v3.0 beta2. 55 In vitro drug screen Two days prior to the start of the assay, organoids were disrupted into single cells using TrypLE and filtered using a 70-μm nylon cell strainer (BD Falcon). The cells were subsequently counted, and resuspended in 5% BME/growth medium (25,000 cells/mL) prior plating in 40 μl volume (Multi-drop Combi Reagent Dispenser, Thermo Scientific, catalog no. 5840300) in 384-well plates (Corning, catalog no. 4588). The drugs were added 2 days after plating the cells using the Tecan D300e Digital Dispenser (Tecan). Nutlin-3a (Cayman Chemical, catalog no. 10004372), niraparib (Selleckchem, catalog no. S2741), and paclitaxel (Sigma, catalog no. T7402) were dissolved in DMSO. Cisplatin (Sigma, catalog no. C2210000) was dissolved in PBS containing 0.3% Tween-20, which was required to dispense the drug using the HP printer. All wells were normalized for the solvent used. DMSO percentage never exceeded 1% and PBS/Tween-20 percentage never exceeded 2%. Drug exposure was performed in quadruplicates for each concentration shown. Five days (120 h) after the addition of the drugs, ATP levels were measured using the CellTiter-Glo 3-D Reagent (Promega, catalog no. G9681) according to the manufacturer′s instructions, and luminescence was measured using a Spark multimode microplate reader (Tecan). Results were normalized to vehicle (100%) and baseline control (Staurosporine 1 μmol/L; 0%). Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software (version 7.04) and lines were fitted using the option “log(inhibitor) vs normalized response–variable slope”. Drug screening results were confirmed in quadruplicates ( n  = 4) over two independent experiments. In vivo transplantation assays Before transplantations, wild-type or mutant oviductal and OSE organoids were harvested and broken into smaller injectable fragments via mechanical shearing with a fire-polished glass pipette. Cells were then resuspended in 10% BME in PBS and ~100,000 cells were injected per location. Both subcutaneous and orthotopic injections were performed. For each mutation combination, two separate clones were transplanted. At least two mice were used for orthotopic and one mouse for subcutaneous transplantations per clone. Ear clipping was used for animal recognition. The mice were sacrificed up to 4 months (ca 120 days) after injections. Tumor volumes were measured and estimated by formula: Tumor volume = (length × width 2 )/2, where length represents the largest tumor diameter and width the perpendicular tumor diameter. Tumor volume was measured on all the OSE-derived tumors and randomly selected oviductal-derived tumors. All the tumors were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis. KI67- and cleaved Caspase-3-positive cells were quantified using ImageJ software. From  n  = 4 tumors also organoids were derived. Establishment of tumor-derived organoids A small piece of a tumor tissue was dissected, mechanically dissociated and cells were extracted by collagenase treatment as described in the Methods above (same protocol as under Derivation of oviductal organoids). Cultures were grown under Nutlin-3a selection to specifically promote the outgrowth of the tumor cells and inhibit the growth of host cells.

PMID:24040940,Molecular-guided therapy predictions reveal drug resistance phenotypes and treatment alternatives in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.,"BACKGROUND: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are rare highly aggressive sarcomas that affect 8-13% of people with neurofibromatosis type 1. The prognosis for patients with MPNST is very poor. Despite TOP2A overexpression in these tumors, doxorubicin resistance is common, and the mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance in MPNST are poorly understood. Molecular-guided therapy prediction is an emerging strategy for treatment refractory sarcomas that involves identification of therapy response and resistance mechanisms in individual tumors. Here, we report the results from a personalized, molecular-guided therapy analysis of MPNST samples. METHODS: Established molecular-guided therapy prediction software algorithms were used to analyze published microarray data from human MPNST samples and cell lines, with benign neurofibroma tissue controls. MPNST and benign neurofibroma-derived cell lines were used for confirmatory in vitro experimentation using quantitative real-time PCR and growth inhibition assays. Microarray data was analyzed using Affymetrix expression console MAS 5.0 method. Significance was calculated with Welch's t-test with non-corrected p-value < 0.05 and validated using permutation testing across samples. Paired Student's t-tests were used to compare relative EC50 values from independent growth inhibition experiments. RESULTS: Molecular guided therapy predictions highlight substantial variability amongst human MPNST samples in expression of drug target and drug resistance pathways, as well as some similarities amongst samples, including common up-regulation of DNA repair mechanisms. In a subset of MPNSTs, high expression of ABCC1 is observed, serving as a predicted contra-indication for doxorubicin and related therapeutics in these patients. These microarray-based results are confirmed with quantitative, real-time PCR and immunofluorescence. The functional effect of drug efflux in MPNST-derived cells is confirmed using in vitro growth inhibition assays. Alternative therapeutics supported by the molecular-guided therapy predictions are reported and tested in MPNST-derived cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the substantial molecular heterogeneity of MPNSTs and validate molecular-guided therapy predictions in vitro. The observed molecular heterogeneity in MPNSTs influences therapy prediction. Also, mechanisms involving drug transport and DNA damage repair are primary mediators of MPNST chemotherapy resistance. Together, these findings support the utility of individualized therapy in MPNST as in other sarcomas, and provide initial proof-of concept that individualized therapy prediction can be accomplished.","Methods Established molecular-guided therapy prediction software algorithms were used to analyze published microarray data from human MPNST samples and cell lines, with benign neurofibroma tissue controls. MPNST and benign neurofibroma-derived cell lines were used for confirmatory in vitro experimentation using quantitative real-time PCR and growth inhibition assays. Microarray data was analyzed using Affymetrix expression console MAS 5.0 method. Significance was calculated with Welch’s t-test with non-corrected p-value < 0.05 and validated using permutation testing across samples. Paired Student’s t-tests were used to compare relative EC50 values from independent growth inhibition experiments. Methods Microarray data Microarray data on MPNST samples, neurofibromas, and MPNST-derived cell lines were accessed via NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository [ 36 ] as indicated in text. Additional benign neurofibroma samples were acquired through an established tissue collection initiative in collaboration with Spectrum Health. All specimens were obtained according to an IRB approved protocol within Spectrum Health. Affymetrix U133 2.0 plus chip arrays were performed at Clinical Research Laboratories (CRL, Lenexa, KS). Purified RNA was used for the preparation of amplified cDNA (NuGen Ovation Pico WTA System). Amplified cDNA was then fragmentated and labelled (NuGen Encore Biotin Module) and hybridized to GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array (GeneChip® Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit, Affymetrix). The arrays were scanned by using GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G and the intensity files were analyzed by Expression Console Software. Array data was normalized using Affymetrix expression console MAS 5.0 method and further filtered to remove probes with absent calls and expression intensities less than 100 in over 40% of samples. Differentially expressed genes were identified using Welch’s t-test with non-corrected p-value < 0.05 and validated using permutation testing across samples. Most significant probe sets of top 100 and top 200 probes were submitted to GeneGo for extensive network and pathway enrichment analysis. Heat maps were generated using XenoBase® version 3.5 from Affymetrix array data using MAS 5.0 normalization. Clustering was performed in both sample and probe dimensions using average linkages with a Pearson correlation distance metric. Molecular-guided personalized medicine (PMED) analysis For each individual tumor sample tested, microarray data from a single sample was compared to pooled benign controls. This process was performed for a total of 15 samples including MPNST and MPNST-derived cell lines (public dataset), and neurofibroma tissue samples. Microarray data processed as above was analyzed using XenoBase-based analysis software, a molecular-guided therapy prediction methodology and reporting tool developed at the Van Andel Research Institute [ 34 , 35 ]. Tumor gene expression levels from Affymetrix U133 2.0 plus chip were normalized using MAS 5.0 Affymetrix expression console and compared to a benign tumor reference set. Relative expression intensities were converted to Z-score values and the gene list with significant expression deviation from the reference set are supplied directly to the Gene Targeted Therapy Map [ 37 ] as well as to the GeneGo Topology tools [ 34 ] that identify additional significant genes implied by topological analysis. Topologically identified genes were also supplied to the Gene Targeted Therapy Map. Z-score expression values were also supplied to two drug response pattern evaluation methods, PGSEA [ 38 ] and CMAP [ 39 ]. PGSEA and CMAP score the expression pattern against known response to therapy and suggest possible effective therapies. The final method to supply therapy choices is driven by expression levels and applied to specific biomarker rules based on strong evidence from clinical trial work that validates the biomarkers for both indicated and contra-indicated therapies [ 32 , 40 ]. All MPNST and MPNST-derived sample data, in addition to data from benign samples for which paired tumor-derived cell lines, RNA, and histology were available for future use were individually analyzed using this process. Finally, results from these analyses are integrated and ranked according to summary scores. A diagram of this process is provided in Figure  1 A, and a more thorough description is provided as Additional file  1 . Figure 1 Molecular-guided therapy prediction process.

Consolidated reports include individual rankings of therapeutics for each sample (see Table  1  and Additional file  2 ).  B)  Summary graph depicting microarray signal intensity for transcripts contributing to molecular-guided therapy predictions in MPNST samples in comparison with benign neurofibromas. Additional graphs for increased visibility of individual results are also provided in Additional file  4 . Quantitative real-time PCR Microarray data was confirmed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Total RNA was extracted from cultured MPNST cell lines and benign neurofibroma-derived cell lines during logarithmic cell growth using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Neurofibroma cell lines were derived from benign neurofibromas using established protocols [ 41 ]. Synthesis of cDNA was performed using 500 ng of RNA according to manufacturer’s instructions (High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit, Invitrogen). Primers used for qRT-PCR were as follows  ABCC1 -Forward (F), GAGGAAGGGAGTTCAGTCTT;  ABCC1 -Reverse (R), ACAAGACGAGCTGAATGAGT;  ABCC3 -F, CACACGGATCTGACAGACAATGA;  ABCC3 -R, ACAGGGCACTCAGCTGTCTCA;  ABCC4 -F, TGTGCTTTTTAAGGCTTCACTCAAT;  ABCC4 -R, TTGTCCTTCGTATAGCAAGTTTTTTG;  ABCC5 -F, GAGAACCAGCACTTCTGGGA;  ABCC5 -R, TGAGCTGAGAATGCATGGAG;  ABCC6 -F, AAAGTACACACAGCATGGCAGTTC;  ABCC6 -R64, GCTCCCGGCTAGACCCTTAA;  ABCG5 -R232, GTTCACATACACCTCCCCCA;  ABCG5 -F101, TCCTTGTACGTGGAGAGCG;  GAPDHF , TGGTATCGTGGAAGGACTCATGAC;  GAPDHR , TGCCAGTGAGCTTCCCGTTCAGC. Reactions were performed in duplicate at 10 μl volume using Sybr Select master mix (Applied Biosystems) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Melt curve analyses are performed following all reactions to ensure detection of a single product based upon single and consistent melting temperatures for each primer set using StepOne Software v2.3 (Applied Biosystems) standard parameters. Data is normalized using  GAPDH  expression and represented as fold change relative to a control sample (2^ΔΔC T ) as indicated in the respective results. Immunofluorescence Cells grown on 8-well chamber slides (Nunc) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, blocked in PBS with 10% goat serum, and incubated in primary antibodies against ABCC1 (Abcam ab24102) and S100 (Dako Z0311) at 1:50 and 1:400 dilution, respectively, overnight at 4°C. Cells were washed in PBS, and secondary incubations were conducted for 45 minutes at room temperature with respective Alexa Fluor-488 Donkey anti-Mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor-568 Donkey anti-Rabbit IgG secondary antibodies at 1:400 dilution. Slides were mounted in Vectashield with DAPI (Vector Labs) for nuclear counterstaining. All images were obtained using identical acquisition settings with 60× objective on an A1 confocal Ti microscope (Nikon). Growth inhibition experiments MPNST-derived cell lines NF96.2, NF02.2, and NF94.3 (ATCC) and benign neurofibroma cell lines were maintained in 5% CO 2  at 37C, in modified DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Growth inhibition experiments were carried out in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS in 96-well plate format. Cells were seeded at 2×10 3  cells per well and allowed to attach for 24 hours prior to drug treatment for 96 hours. Doxorubicin (LC Laboratories) dosages included 5 μg/ml, 2.5 μg/ml, 1.25 μg/ml, 625 ng/ml, 312 ng/ml, 156 ng/ml, 78 ng/ml, 40 ng/ml, 20 ng/ml, and 10 ng/ml. Vorinostat, rapamycin, and etoposide (LC Laboratories), as well as thalidomide (Sigma), were used at doses ranging from 2 mM to 100 nM. Freshly prepared verapamil (Sigma) was added at 100 μM where indicated. Trichloroacetic acid fixation and sulforhodamine B (SRB) staining was performed as described [ 42 ] as a surrogate cell count measurement. EC 50  was defined as the drug concentration causing a 50% reduction in net signal versus untreated controls as interpolated from line of best fit. An EC 50  was calculated for each individual experiment (n = 5) and Student’s t-test was used to compare EC 50  from doxorubicin only treatments to verapamil (100 μM) plus doxorubicin.",Jacqueline D Peacock; David Cherba; Kevin Kampfschulte; Mallory K Smith; Noel R Monks; Craig P Webb; Matthew Steensma,Journal of translational medicine,2013-09-17,10.1186/1479-5876-11-213,minimal,True
PMID:15446585,Gene expression profiling reveals unique molecular subtypes of Neurofibromatosis Type I-associated and sporadic malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are highly aggressive Schwann cell neoplasms that are frequently associated with Type I Neurofibromatosis (NF1) and respond poorly to current therapeutic regimens. To better understand the molecular heterogeneity of these tumors, we performed gene expression profiling on 25 NF1-associated and 17 sporadic MPNSTs using oligonucleotide microarrays representing approximately 8100 unique human gene transcripts. Using several previously reported statistical approaches, we were unable to identify a molecular signature that could reliably distinguish between NF1-associated and sporadic MPNSTs in independent training and test sample sets. However, using an unsupervised clustering approach, we identified an extensive gene expression signature that distinguished 9 of the 42 tumors analyzed. This signature corresponded to relative overexpression of transcripts associated with neuroglial differentiation (NCAM, MBP, L1CAM, P1P) and relative down-regulation of proliferation and growth factor associated transcripts (IGF2, FGFR1, MDK, Ki67). All tumors with this gene expression signature lacked expression of EGFR and all but one tumor were derived from patients with NF1. However, there were no other obvious associations with histological grade, tumor site, metastasis, recurrence, age, or patient survival. We conclude that distinct molecular classes of MPNST exist and that the ability to stratify these tumors based on unique and biologically relevant gene expression profiles may be important for future targeted therapeutics.",,Mark A Watson; Arie Perry; Tarik Tihan; Richard A Prayson; Abhijit Guha; Julia Bridge; Rosalie Ferner; David H Gutmann,"Brain pathology (Zurich, Switzerland)",2004-07,10.1111/j.1750-3639.2004.tb00067.x,abstract_only,False

PMID:39824854,Comparison of 1D and 3D volume measurement techniques in NF2-associated vestibular schwannoma monitoring.,"To compare 1D (linear) tumor volume calculations and classification systems with 3D-segmented volumetric analysis (SVA), focusing specifically on their effectiveness in the evaluation and management of NF2-associated vestibular schwannomas (VS). VS were clinically followed every 6 months with cranial, thin-sliced (< 3 mm) MRI. We retrospectively reviewed and used T1-weighted post-contrast enhanced (gadolinium) images for both SVA and linear measurements. 3D-SVA was performed manually or combined with semiautomated segmentation by using axial planes. The maximum linear dimensions (MLD) were determined in three dimensions (anteroposterior, transverse, and craniocaudal planes) using axial and coronal planes. The MLD was cubed (MLD","Materials and methods Patients and methods The diagnosis of NF2-related schwannomatosis was confirmed in all patients by clinical evaluation using the updated diagnostic criteria . A total of 149 NF2 patients and 292 tumors were included in this retrospective analysis and were followed up between 2004 and 2021 at the Department of Neurosurgery and Centre of Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis in Tübingen. All procedures and methods performed in this study were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. Informed consent was obtained from all participants or their parents/legal guardians included in the study. Ethical approval was obtained from the ethics board of the Medical Faculty and the University Hospital of Tübingen (No 018/2019BO2, final approval date 17/01/2019). 13 Five patients exhibited unilateral VS (no contralateral VS visible in the thin-layered MRI at any time point), whereas the remaining 144 patients had bilateral lesions. All included patients had at least two MRI scans and one year of routine radiological follow-up. Both internally and externally performed MRI data sets were used. All patient data and imaging were located on a secure server that is accessible to the clinical staff of the University Hospital Tübingen. MRIs at any treatment timepoint (observation, before and after surgery, with neoadjuvant or adjuvant (postop) off-label treatment with Bevacizumab and after radiation treatment) were included. The analysis explicitly did not address hearing outcomes or growth behavior or examine the outcome of undergone treatment modalities (surgery, off-label treatment with Bevacizumab, radiosurgery). However, volume changes and the challenges related to measurement methods should be explicitly assessed postoperatively, as (partial) resection often leads to significant alterations in the configuration of the residual tumor, unlike radiation or bevacizumab therapy. The entire tumor, including its extension inside and outside the internal auditory canals, was measured in all measurement procedures. MRI data sets with implants (cochlea or auditory brainstem implant) were excluded. Tumor size was classified by the Hannover  and Koos classification systems 12 . 14 For the 3D-based segmented volumetric analysis (SVA), postcontrast thin-sliced (≤ 3 mm) T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) sequences were uploaded into the iPlan Net software (Brainlab, Feldkirchen, Germany), and volumes were measured manually or in combination with semiautomated segmentation according to our previous studies . 15 For the 1D-based linear measurements, the MRIs were first carefully analyzed to visualize the most ideal and most considerable tumor extension (VS width) in axial and coronal sequences. Subsequently, the maximum linear (tumor) diameter (MLD) in axial and coronal (medial to lateral and caudal to rostral/cranial, in total four measurements per MRI) planes were measured according to the RECIST guidelines . 16 To compare tumor volumes using one-dimensional (1D) and three-dimensional (3D) methods, we employed the cubed maximum linear diameter (MLD³), as previously described . Additionally, to give a second volumetric impression, the maximum linear diameters in the anteroposterior, craniocaudal, and transverse planes were multiplied (orthogonal analysis, OA) according to previous studies 6 , 7 . 7 These represent the tumor’s full extent and are comparable with other studies. The measurement techniques included are illustrated in Fig.  1 .

Tumor diameters were measured in anteroposterior, transverse, and craniocaudal dimensions in axial and coronal planes (defined as “T1 ax width” = anteroposterior and “T1 ax width” = transverse tumor diameter in the axial plane, and “T1 cor width” = craniocaudal tumor diameter in the coronal plane). The greatest linear measurement was defined as the Maximum Linear Diameter (MLD), which was additionally cubed for the volumetric analysis. The maximum linear measurements in the anteroposterior (transverse), cranio-caudal (coronal), and transverse (axial plane) were multiplied to give a second volumetric estimate in the Orthogonal Analysis (OA). The MLD and OA were defined and calculated similarly to previous studies for better comparison. In addition, we have included a fourth dimension (defined as “T1 cor length” = transverse tumor diameter in coronal planes) separately to gain a comprehensive impression. Statistical analysis Statistical evaluation was performed using the Statistical Package for Social Studies (SPSS 10.0 for Windows, SPSS Inc.). The significance level was set to a  p-value ≤ 0.05  for all analyses. To obtain a size reference for the measured and calculated volumes, these were (sub)grouped using the Hannover and Koos classification systems. A linear regression model was performed to investigate the following aspects/comparisons: 
 
 Comparison between linear-based diameter assessments (maximum linear diameter, MLD) and their 1D-based volume calculations (orthogonal analysis, OA; cubed maximum linear dimensions, MLD 3 ) for segmented (3D) volume (segmented volumetric analysis, SVA). The percentage deviation of the linear-based methods compared to segmented volumetric analysis. The effect and the comparability of OA and MLD 3  versus SVA methods in terms of postoperative volume reduction through partial resection dimensions. The validity of the classification systems (Hannover and Koos) compared to the linear-based and 3D-based methods. A graphical analysis of the scattering widths and comparisons of all measurement methods was carried out using plots. A one-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was run to determine the deviation of MLD 3 , OA, and SVA on classification systems Koos and Hannover (estimation grade). The three measurement techniques, MLD 3 , OA, and SVA, were used. Patients and methods The diagnosis of NF2-related schwannomatosis was confirmed in all patients by clinical evaluation using the updated diagnostic criteria . A total of 149 NF2 patients and 292 tumors were included in this retrospective analysis and were followed up between 2004 and 2021 at the Department of Neurosurgery and Centre of Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis in Tübingen. All procedures and methods performed in this study were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. Informed consent was obtained from all participants or their parents/legal guardians included in the study. Ethical approval was obtained from the ethics board of the Medical Faculty and the University Hospital of Tübingen (No 018/2019BO2, final approval date 17/01/2019). 13 Five patients exhibited unilateral VS (no contralateral VS visible in the thin-layered MRI at any time point), whereas the remaining 144 patients had bilateral lesions. All included patients had at least two MRI scans and one year of routine radiological follow-up. Both internally and externally performed MRI data sets were used. All patient data and imaging were located on a secure server that is accessible to the clinical staff of the University Hospital Tübingen. MRIs at any treatment timepoint (observation, before and after surgery, with neoadjuvant or adjuvant (postop) off-label treatment with Bevacizumab and after radiation treatment) were included. The analysis explicitly did not address hearing outcomes or growth behavior or examine the outcome of undergone treatment modalities (surgery, off-label treatment with Bevacizumab, radiosurgery). However, volume changes and the challenges related to measurement methods should be explicitly assessed postoperatively, as (partial) resection often leads to significant alterations in the configuration of the residual tumor, unlike radiation or bevacizumab therapy. The entire tumor, including its extension inside and outside the internal auditory canals, was measured in all measurement procedures. MRI data sets with implants (cochlea or auditory brainstem implant) were excluded. Tumor size was classified by the Hannover  and Koos classification systems 12 . 14 For the 3D-based segmented volumetric analysis (SVA), postcontrast thin-sliced (≤ 3 mm) T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) sequences were uploaded into the iPlan Net software (Brainlab, Feldkirchen, Germany), and volumes were measured manually or in combination with semiautomated segmentation according to our previous studies . 15 For the 1D-based linear measurements, the MRIs were first carefully analyzed to visualize the most ideal and most considerable tumor extension (VS width) in axial and coronal sequences. Subsequently, the maximum linear (tumor) diameter (MLD) in axial and coronal (medial to lateral and caudal to rostral/cranial, in total four measurements per MRI) planes were measured according to the RECIST guidelines . 16 To compare tumor volumes using one-dimensional (1D) and three-dimensional (3D) methods, we employed the cubed maximum linear diameter (MLD³), as previously described . Additionally, to give a second volumetric impression, the maximum linear diameters in the anteroposterior, craniocaudal, and transverse planes were multiplied (orthogonal analysis, OA) according to previous studies 6 , 7 . 7 These represent the tumor’s full extent and are comparable with other studies. The measurement techniques included are illustrated in Fig.  1 .

PMID:33673681,Hybrid Minigene Assay: An Efficient Tool to Characterize mRNA Splicing Profiles of ,Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is caused by heterozygous loss of function mutations in the ,"4. Materials and Methods  4.1. Patients We analyzed a series of 29 germinal variants in the  NF1  gene identified in patients referred to our center between 2005 and 2019 for a clinical diagnosis/suspicion of neurofibromatosis type 1 according to the NIH criteria [ 10 , 65 ]. Informed consent was obtained for each patient. Family history and relevant clinical data were analyzed from medical records.  Table 1  reports the set of  NF1  variants that were examined in this work in familial or sporadic patients with NF1; their clinical features are described in  Supplementary Table S1 . 4.2. Molecular Analysis of the NF1 Gene DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leucocytes using standard protocols. For RNA analysis, blood was collected in PAXgene whole blood samples (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and extraction was carried out with the PAXgene™ Blood RNA System (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Over the years, different methods were employed for  NF1  molecular analysis that include: (i) mutation screening approaches (HRM analysis, as previously described [ 38 ]); (ii) cDNA analysis, which was performed by amplifying, after retrotranscription of 1 µg of total RNA, the whole coding region of  NF1  into five overlapping 2 kb amplicons [ 29 , 66 ] that were then directly sequenced through Sanger (Abi Prism 3700, ThermoFisher Scientific, Watham, MA, USA); (iii) finally, a NGS-based sequencing protocol consisting of library preparation with a Haloplex HS or SureSelect kits (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), which includes  NF1  and  SPRED1  genes, was employed and libraries were run on a MiniSeq apparatus (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis was carried out for the screening of single/multiexon intragenic deletions/duplications using the SALSA MLPA kits P081/P082 (MRC Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) according to manufacturer’s protocol. When DNA was available from other family members, segregation analysis was carried out through bidirectional Sanger sequencing or MLPA analysis depending on the variation ( Table 1 ).  In the patient carrying the c.1722-3C > T variant, DNA was extracted also from other tissues (saliva, buccal brushing, and urine cells) using the Gentra Puregene kit (Puregene Cell and Tissue kit plus Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). The presence of the c.1722-3C > T variant in  NF1  intron 11 (intron 15) abolishes a naturally occurring  PstI  site and it was validated by a specific PCR-RFLP assay in different tissues: a 500 bp long fragment including exon 12a (exon 16) was amplified using specific primers and digested with  PstI  (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) one hour at 37 °C; restriction products were visualized on a 2.5% agarose gel. 4.3. Bioinformatic Analysis of Variants Different complementary online software for splicing prediction were employed: Human Splicing Finder (HSF) Version 2.4.1 ( http://www.umd.be/HSF/  Assessing on 21 December 2020), Mutation taster ( http://www.mutationtaster.org/  Assessing on 21 December 2020), and Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) v1.6 ( https://cadd.gs.washington.edu/  Assessing on 21 December 2020).  For mutation nomenclature,  NM_000267.3  was used as reference sequence and  NF1  exons were numbered according to the historical numbering used by the NF1 community [ 26 ] (followed by the NCBI numbering in brackets). Protein sequence alignments were performed using Multalin ( http://multalin.toulouse.inra.fr/multalin/  Assessing on 28 December 2020). The following population or disease databases were examined to check allele frequencies: the Genome Aggregation Database gnomAD ( https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/  Assessing on 28 December 2020), dbSNP ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/  Assessing on 28 December 2020), TOPMed ( https://www.nhlbiwgs.org/  Assessing on 28 December 2020), Human Mutation Database ( http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk  Assessing on 28 December 2020), ClinVar ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/  Assessing on 28 December 2020), LOVD ( https://www.lovd.nl/  Assessing on 28 December 2020). Variant interpretation was based on ACMG criteria and a detailed information on classification is reported in supplementary  Table S2  [ 44 ]. 4.4. Construction and Expression of the Minigenes PCR fragments including the exon adjacent to each  NF1  variant and at least 100 bp of the upstream and downstream introns were amplified from patients’ genomic DNA and cloned into the  beta -globin vector, as previously described [ 40 ]. In presence of short introns, a bigger portion of sequence including two adjacent exons was amplified and cloned in the minigene construct. One clone with the wild-type allele and one with the variant to test were retained for expression experiments and the correctness of each vector was verified by direct sequencing. HEK293 cells (6 × 10 5 ) were transfected with 1 µg of the wild type or the mutated minigene using Lipofectamine 2000 (ThermoFisher Scientific, Watham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. After 24 h total RNA was extracted with TRIzolTM (ThermoFisher Scientific, Watham, MA, USA), retrotranscribed using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (ThermoFisher Scientific, Watham, MA, USA). The resulting cDNA was then amplified using specific primers for the  beta -globin gene, designed on exon 2 (forward) and exon 3 (reverse), in order to avoid the amplification of eventual ectopically expressed  NF1  transcripts. PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel and individual bands were excised and sequenced using amplification primers (Sanger electropherograms of all  NF1  variants tested by minigene assay are reported in  Supplementary Figure S1 ). When required, purified bands were subcloned using the TOPO TA Cloning kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Watham, MA, USA) and single clones were sequenced as previously described [ 67 ]. A schematic representation of the minigene construct is depicted in  Supplementary Figure S4 . Densitometric analyses were performed using the ImageJ (Image Processing and analysis in Java) software ( https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/  Assessing on 28 December 2020).",Valeria Morbidoni; Elisa Baschiera; Monica Forzan; Valentina Fumini; Dario Seif Ali; Gianpietro Giorgi; Lisa Buson; Maria Andrea Desbats; Matteo Cassina; Maurizio Clementi; Leonardo Salviati; Eva Trevisson,Cancers,2021-02-27,10.3390/cancers13050999,minimal,True
PMID:34630515,Assessment of Mosaicism and Detection of Cryptic Alleles in CRISPR/Cas9-Engineered Neurofibromatosis Type 1 and ,"Genome editing in pigs has been made efficient, practical, and economically viable by the CRISPR/Cas9 platform, representing a promising new era in translational modeling of human disease for research and preclinical development of therapies and devices. Porcine embryo microinjection provides a universally available, efficient option over somatic-cell nuclear transfer, but requires that critical considerations be made in genotypic validation of the models that routinely go unaddressed. Accurate validation of genotypes is especially important when modeling genetic disorders, such as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) that exhibits complex genotype-phenotypic relationships. NF1, an autosomal dominant disorder, is particularly hard to model as it manifests very differently across patients, and even within families, with over 3,000 disease-associated mutations of the neurofibromin 1 (","Materials and Methods CRISPR Design, Synthesis, and Validation In the conduct of research utilizing recombinant DNA, the investigator adhered to NIH Guidelines for research involving recombinant DNA molecules. Target sites within the genes of interest were selected using Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s CRISPR design tool (now unavailable, previously: crispr.mit.edu, ), or later, CRISPOR ( 1 Concordet and Haeussler, 2018 ). All gRNAs were synthesized through  in vitro  transcription ( Barnett et al., 2019 ;  Niemi et al., 2019 ;  Wilson et al., 2021 ). Briefly, we used Phusion polymerase (M0530S; New England Biolabs, Inc., Ipswitch, MA) to synthesize a gRNA  in vitro  transcription template using overlap extension PCR with one primer carrying the T7 sequence, target sequence, and the invariant portion (20bp) of the gRNA sequence for overhang, and another antisense primer carrying the invariant portion of the gRNA sequence ( Supplementary Table 1 ). The  in vitro  template was purified (NucleoSpin Gel & PCR Cleanup, Macherey-Nagel) and used for  in vitro  transcription of gRNA according to the manufacturer instructions (MEGAshortscript T7 Transcription Kit (AM1354); ThermoFisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY).  In vitro  transcription reactions were cleaned up according to manufacturer instructions (MEGAclear Transcription Cleanup Kit (AM1908); ThermoFisher Scientific), with an additional ammonium acetate precipitation and wash with 70% ethanol. Abundance of gRNA was determined by Qubit Fluorometric Quantification (ThermoFisher Scientific). In vitro  design validation was performed using a porcine kidney epithelial cell line (LLC-PK1 ATCC CL-101 ™ ; American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA) grown in Medium 199 with 3% FBS (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Complexes of tracrRNA (Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT), Coralville, IA) and target-specific crRNA (IDT) were generated by heating 1:1 crRNA/tracrRNA by mole to 95°C and cooled to 25°C at 0.1°C/s. A total of 0.2×10 6  cells were mixed with a final concentration of 2μm crRNA/tracrRNA, 1.95μm Cas9 (Cas9 Nuclease V3; IDT), 2μm electroporation enhancer (IDT), and 1μm single-stranded DNA donor (Ultramer; IDT) using the SF Cell Line 4D-Nucleofector ™  X Kit S (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) and the EN-150 protocol of a 4D Nucleofector ™  (Lonza). Subsequently, cells were recovered in complete growth media for 48h, lysed, and the targeted region was PCR amplified with the hotstart PrimeSTAR GXL DNA polymerase (Takara Bio Inc., Mountain View, CA) and sequenced using the MiSeq platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA; see “ Genotyping ” subsection below). Estrus Synchronization, Superovulation, Artificial Insemination, and Embryo Retrieval From Donor Pigs Experiments involving animals were conducted under protocols approved by the University of Wisconsin–Madison Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with published National Institutes of Health and United States Department of Agriculture guidelines. The segments of the methodology utilizing animals were conducted at the UW Swine Research and Teaching Center (SRTC), a specific pathogen-free (SPF) breeding, housing and surgical facility with the capacity to house up to 1,600 pigs, and the capability to raise piglets to maturity. Our process for creating genetically engineered NF1 porcine models is summarized in  Figure 1 . Initial estrus was induced (Day -4) in female pigs by intramuscular (i.m.) administration of 5ml of P.G. 600® (Intervet Inc (Merck Animal Health), Madison, NJ); a mixture of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)). Estrus detection (once daily), using “detection of standing heat” methodology commonly used in swine breeding ( Worwood, 2007 ), was started three days after induction. Pigs exhibiting synchronized estrus were designated as “embryo donors” (Day 0). Thirteen days following estrus detection, the follicular phase of the donors was synchronized by i.m. administration of 20mg prostaglandin F 2α  (Lutalyse ® ; Zoetis Inc., Kalamazoo, MI). Prostaglandin F 2α  regresses the corpora lutea responsible for the maintenance of the luteal phase, thereby synchronizing the follicular phase of estrus. The use of Lutalyse ®  significantly increases ovulation rate and one-cell embryo recovery ( Sommer et al., 2011 ). Sixteen hours after prostaglandin F 2α  administration, superovulation was induced by administration of prostaglandin F 2α  (20mg, i.m.) and P.G. 600 ®  (7.5ml, i.m.) and then hCG [1,000IU, subcutaneous; 72h after Lutalyse and P.G. 600 ®  administration; Chorulon, Intervet Inc (Merck Animal Health, Summit, NJ)]. Second estrus detection (twice daily) and artificial insemination (twice daily) occurred on Days 18 and 19. On Day 20, the embryo donors were euthanized and their reproductive tracts were exposed  via  abdominal incision and oviducts ligated at the uterotubal junction. Each ovary and oviduct were aseptically dissected out and transported in a portable incubator to the laboratory where oviducts were dissected from the ovaries. Oviducts were flushed with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1% newborn calf serum (1% NBCS PBS). Single-cell presumptive zygotes were identified under a dissecting microscope and moved into pre-equilibrated modified porcine zygote medium (PZM3-MUI;  Whitworth et al., 2014 ). Figure 1 Genetic engineering of pigs by embryo microinjection. Estrus synchronization of potential embryo recipient (surrogate pigs) and donor pigs is achieved by a refined hormone regimen. A variation in the regimen is utilized in the embryo donors to increase ovulation rate and the potential for higher yield of one-cell embryos (zygotes). The embryo donors are artificially inseminated on second estrus detection and euthanized shortly thereafter for collection of single-cell presumptive zygotes. The isolated zygotes are microinjected with the CRISPR/Cas9 components and implanted into the oviducts of surrogate pigs by surgical access usually within 4–6h of initial embryo collection. Transabdominal ultrasound is used to confirm pregnancy and to track fetal development. Shortly after parturition, genomic DNA is obtained from the neonatal piglets for genotypic validation and identification of genetically engineered “founders” for subsequent breeding and expansion of the novel swine line. Embryo Microinjection of CRISPR/Cas9 Up to 50 zygotes were moved into HEPES-buffered media for cytoplasmic microinjection of the CRISPR/Cas9 editing components. Each zygote was held in place with a holding pipette while the microinjection pipette delivered reagents into the cytoplasm. The injection solution contained gRNAs,  S. pyogenes  Cas9 mRNA (PNA Bio Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA or Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA), and single-stranded donors (when necessary) to create the  NF1  or  TP53  mutations. The microinjected presumptive zygotes were maintained at 39°C in a 5% CO 2  and 95% air mixture, when not being manipulated. The microinjections were performed by the Animal Models core within the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center. Estrus Synchronization, Embryo Transfer, Pregnancy, and Parturition in Surrogate Pigs Initial estrus was induced (Day -6) in female pigs by intramuscular (i.m.) administration of 5ml of P.G. 600 ® . Estrus detection (once daily) was performed and animals showing signs of estrus were retained as potential surrogates (“embryo recipients”). Heat detection was performed twice daily for the second cycle, and pigs displaying estrus 18 to 24h after embryo donors were designated as the ideal surrogates. Within hours of microinjection, presumptive zygotes were implanted into the oviduct of the surrogates  via  laparotomy. Briefly, under surgical anesthesia, the reproductive tracts of the surrogates were accessed  via  a midline abdominal incision. Up to 150 presumptive zygotes were transferred into each surrogate in one oviduct, minimizing culture media volume. On recovery, appropriate post-operative [antibiotic and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID)] care was provided. Transabdominal ultrasound was used to confirm pregnancy and to track fetal development as appropriate. Pregnant surrogates were transferred into farrowing pens one week prior to expected parturition (115–117days after estrus). Four days after parturition, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drug was administered to the neonatal piglets and tail biopsies were obtained for genotypic validation. Genotyping Genomic DNA from tail biopsies of newborn piglets was extracted using an overnight 55°C incubation in genomic lysis buffer (20mm Tris–HCl, pH8; 150mm NaCl; 100mm EDTA, 1% SDS) with 100μg/ml proteinase K (Promega, Madison, WI) digestion, followed by protein precipitation (Protein Precipitation solution, Promega). The supernatant was then precipitated in isopropanol; the pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and resuspended in sterile ddH 2 O. PCR was performed using Q5® Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs, Inc.) according to manufacturer’s suggestions ( Supplementary Table 2 ). Sanger sequencing was performed on PCR amplicons using primers that generated the amplicons on a 3730xl Genetic Analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Targeted amplicon sequencing (TAm-Seq) was performed by amplifying targeted genomic regions with primers carrying indexing adapters, followed by 0.7X bead purification (Axygen AxyPrep Magnetic Bead Purification Kit, Corning). An 8-cycle indexing reaction was performed using custom combinatorial dual indexing primers, followed by another 0.7X bead purification and sample pooling. TAm-Seq of pooled samples was performed on a MiSeq v2 Nano 2×250 flow cell (Illumina). Sequencing data were demultiplexed and analyzed using CRISPResso or CRISPResso2 ( Pinello et al., 2016 ;  Clement et al., 2019 ). Read depths of at least 2,000X were acquired, providing sensitivity to reliably detect rare alleles at <0.1% abundance ( Hendel et al., 2015 ). Sanger sequencing was used to characterize breakpoints of excisions, while TAm-Seq was used to detect indels and SNPs. The sequencing was performed by the University of Wisconsin-Madison DNA Sequencing Facility. Statistical Analysis Logistic regressions were performed in JMP (JMP Pro 15.0.0, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) using the presence or absence of germline transmission in progeny as the dependent categorical response and allelic abundance of the edited allele (pixel density or Illumina read representation) as the independent continuous regressor. Droplet Digital PCR Copy number variation (CNV) analysis was performed using digital PCR (dPCR; QX200 Droplet Digital PCR System, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). Purified genomic DNA was digested using BamH1 (New England Biolabs, Inc.) and then further diluted 1:10 using sterile ddH 2 O. dPCR reactions were performed according to the manufacturer’s suggestions such that the final concentrations of primers and probes were 900nM and 250nM, respectively. PCR conditions were used according to manufacturer recommendations, except for a 50°C annealing temperature for 10s ( Supplementary Table 2 ). Droplets were analyzed on a QX200 droplet reader (Bio-Rad), and CNV was calculated using RPP30 as a reference gene.",Clifford Dustin Rubinstein; Dalton T McLean; Brent P Lehman; Jennifer J Meudt; Dominic T Schomberg; Kathy J Krentz; Jamie L Reichert; Mark B Meyer; Marie Adams; Charles M Konsitzke; Dhanansayan Shanmuganayagam,Frontiers in genetics,2021,10.3389/fgene.2021.721045,minimal,True
PMID:7570581,"Evidence for the presence of two amino-terminal isoforms of neurofibromin, a gene product responsible for neurofibromatosis type 1.","Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant disorder, primarily affecting cells of neural crest origin, and is characterized by café-au-lait skin spots, multiple neurofibromas, and higher incidence of malignancy. A gene linked to NF1 encodes neurofibromin, an established function of which is to stimulate intrinsic GTPase activity of ras protein. The neurofibromin gene gives rise to multiple transcripts generated by alternative splicing, that encode various neurofibromin isoforms. In this study, we have cloned a cDNA encoding a newly identified species of a putative amino-terminal isoform which lacks a large portion of neurofibromin, including the domain related to GTPase-activating protein. This clone carries the insert of 2.7 kb, coding for a protein of 593 amino acid residues, tentatively termed N-isoform 11, whose amino-terminal 574 residues are identical to those of authentic neurofibromin encoded by the eleven exons located at the 5' portion of the gene. Previously, we cloned a cDNA coding for a similar isoform of 551 amino acid residues, termed N-isoform 10, whose amino-terminal portion is encoded by the first ten exons. The molecular weights of these two deduced N-isoforms are consistent with the values determined by in vitro translation of the mRNA transcribed from each N-isoform cDNA. The presence of the amino-terminal isoform(s) suggests the physiological significance of the amino-terminal portion of neurofibromin.",,H Suzuki; K Takahashi; S Shibahara,The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,1995-04,10.1620/tjem.175.225,abstract_only,False

RT-qPCR Analysis Total RNA was isolated using NucleoSpin® RNA II (Macherey-Nagel, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions, reverse-transcribed using Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and cDNA transcripts were amplified by qPCR using the SYBR Green technique (Applied Biosystems, Cheshire, UK). Amplification was performed in triplicate in an ABI7900 qPCR machine, using 40 cycles of (95°C for 30 s, 60°C for 1 min, 72°C for 30 s). Primer sequences were: NHE1-fw: 5′-CACACCACCATCAAATACTTCC-3′, NHE1-rv: 5′-GAACTTGTTGATGAACCAGGTC-3′; NHE2-fw: TTGGAGAGTCCCTGCTGAATGATG, NHE2-rv: tcagctgtgatgtaggacaaataactg, NBCn1-fw: 5′-GCAAGAAACATTCTGACCCTCA-3′, NBCn1-rv: 5′-GCTTCCACCACTTCCATTACzCT, NBCe2-fw: atcttcatggaccagcagatcac, NBCe2-rv: tgcttggctggcatcaggaag. mRNA expression was quantified using the comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method, using β-actin as reference gene (fw 5′- AGCGAGCATCCCCCAAAGTT-3′, rv 5′-GGGCACGAAGGCTCATCATT-3′), and is given relative to that in HPDE cells. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting Cells were seeded to 60–70% confluency in 6-well culture dishes, lysed in lysis buffer [1% SDS, 10 mM Tris-pH 7.5, Na 3 VO 4  1 mM, and complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)] and homogenized by sonication. SDS-PAGE was performed using Bio-Rad Criterion TM  TGX TM  precast 10% gels in Tris/Glycine buffer. Gels were run for 1 h at 150 V, followed by transfer to Trans-Blot® Turbo TM  0.2 μm nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Protein transfer was evaluated by Ponceau red staining, followed by blocking in 5% dry milk in TBST (0.01 M Tris/HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 30 min at room temperature, incubation with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C, and finally washing in TBST and incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. Blots were developed using the FUSION-Fx chemiluminescence system (Vilber Lourmat). Images were processed in Adobe Photoshop and band intensities were quantified using UN-SCAN-IT gel 6.1 software. Immunofluorescence Microscopy Analysis Cells were grown on glass coverslips in 6-well culture dishes, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, washed in icecold PBS, and permeabilized for 12 min in permeabilization buffer (0.2 % Triton X-100, 1% BSA in PBS). Unspecific fluorescence was blocked by a 30 min incubation in PBS plus 2% BSA, followed by incubation with primary antibody for 1  h at room temperature, three washes in 2% BSA blocking buffer, and incubation with secondary antibodies diluted in 2% BSA blocking buffer) for 45 min, washing in PBS containing 2% BSA, a 5 min incubation with (4',6-Diamidino-2-Phenylindole, Dihydrochloride) (DAPI) for nuclear staining, extensive washing in PBS and mounting in N-propyl-gallate mounting media (2% w/v in PBS/glycerin). Fluorescence images were captured on a fully motorized Olympus BX63 upright microscope with an Olympus DP72 color, 12.8-megapixel, 4.140 × 3.096-resolution camera and with a fully motorized and automated Olympus IX83 Inverted microscope with a Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash 4.0 camera (C11440-22CU). The software used was Olympus CellSens dimension, which is able to do deconvolution on captured z stacks, and images were processed for publication using Adobe Photoshop CS6. 1 2 Real-Time Imaging of Intracellular pH Measurements of pH i  were carried out essentially as described previously ( 21 ). Briefly, cells seeded in WillCo glass-bottom dishes (WillCo Wells, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) were loaded with 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM, 1.6 μM) in growth medium for 30 min at 37°C. Cells were washed once in HCO  containing Ringer solution [118 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaHCO 3 - 3 , 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO 4 , 1 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 1 mM CaCl 2 , 3.3 mM 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS), 3.3 mM 2-[Tris(hydroxymethyl)-methylamino]-ethanesulfonic acid (TES), 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4], placed in a 37°C imaging chamber equipped with gas and solute perfusion, at the stage of a Nikon Eclipse T i  microscope, and imaged using a 40X/1.4 NA objective and EasyRatioPro imaging software (PTI, NJ, USA). Emission was measured at 520 nm after excitation at 440 and 485 nm. Acidification was induced by exposure to 20 mM NH 4 Cl for 10 min. Calibration to pH i  values was performed using the high K + /nigericin technique and a 4-point linear calibration curve. BrdU Proliferation Assay Eighty percentage confluent Panc-1 and BxPC3 cells were trypsinized and resuspended in growth medium. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates (Celllstar®, cat # 655090). After 24 h incubation at 37°C/5% CO 2 , plates were washed in PBS and 200 μl serum free medium was added. After 24 h, the cells were incubated with 10 ng/mL TGFβ, and/or 10 μM of the NHE1 inhibitor cariporide. Forty-eight hours later, a Cell Proliferation ELISA, BrdU (chemiluminescent) kit (Roche, cat # 11 669 915 001) was used for determining the proliferation status of the cells, according to the manufacturer's instructions. 20 μl BrdU labeling solution was added to each well and the plates were incubated for 4 h, followed by a fixation/denaturing step, and incubation with a peroxidase-coupled mouse monoclonal anti-BrdU antibody. The plates were washed extensively, incubated with substrate solution containing luminol, 4-iodophenol and peroxide for 4 min on a shaker, and luminescence measured using a BMG FLUOstar OPTIMA Microplate Reader. Invasion Assay Cell invasion was assessed using growth factor reduced corning® Matrigel® invasion chambers, 24-well plate and 8.0 μm pore size (Corning, BioCoat, MA, USA). Prior to the experiment, invasion chambers containing Matrigel were rehydrated by adding 500 μl serum free medium for 2 h at 37°C. Forty-eight hours after transfection with the indicated siRNAs, cells were serum starved, and 24 h later, treated or not with TGFβ for 48 h, before being washed with sterile PBS, trypsinized, washed 3 x in serum free medium, and 50,000 cells in this medium seeded into the upper chamber. Experiments were always done in duplicate. The lower chamber was filled with 10% serum containing medium. Chambers were incubated for 22 h at 37°C/5% CO 2  to allow cells to invade through the Matrigel. Non-invaded cells from the upper surface of the chamber were removed with a cotton swab. Invaded cells on the lower surface of the chamber were fixed for 30 min in ice-cold absolute methanol, and filters were stained with 30% Giemsa solution (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min and mounted on glass slides. Invaded cells (four images per filter per condition) were counted using bright-field microscopy. Data Analysis and Statistics Data are shown as individual representative experiments or as means of at least three independent experiments, with standard error of mean (SEM) error bars. Statistical significance was tested using Student  t -test or one- or two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparison tests as appropriate, using GraphPad prism 6.",Raj R Malinda; Katrine Zeeberg; Patricia C Sharku; Mette Q Ludwig; Lotte B Pedersen; Søren T Christensen; Stine F Pedersen,Frontiers in oncology,2020,10.3389/fonc.2020.00687,minimal,True
PMID:33273014,mTOR kinase inhibition disrupts neuregulin 1-ERBB3 autocrine signaling and sensitizes NF2-deficient meningioma cellular models to IGF1R inhibition.,"Meningiomas (MNs), arising from the arachnoid/meningeal layer, are nonresponsive to chemotherapies, with ∼50% showing loss of the Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene. Previously, we established NF2 loss activates mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) signaling, leading to clinical trials for NF2 and MN. Recently our omics studies identified activated ephrin (EPH) receptor and Src family kinases upon NF2 loss. Here, we report increased expression of several ligands in NF2-null human arachnoidal cells (ACs) and the MN cell line Ben-Men-1, particularly neuregulin-1/heregulin (NRG1), and confirm increased NRG1 secretion and activation of V-ERB-B avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 3 (ERBB3) receptor kinase. Conditioned-medium from NF2-null ACs or exogenous NRG1 stimulated ERBB3, EPHA2, and mTORC1/2 signaling, suggesting pathway crosstalk. NF2-null cells treated with an ERBB3-neutralizing antibody partially downregulated mTOR pathway activation but showed no effect on viability. mTORC1/2 inhibitor treatment decreased NRG1 expression and downregulated ERBB3 while re-activating pAkt T308, suggesting a mechanism independent of NRG1-ERBB3 but likely involving activation of another upstream receptor kinase. Transcriptomics after mTORC1/2 inhibition confirmed decreased ERBB3/ERBB4 while revealing increased expression of insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF1R). Drug treatment co-targeting mTORC1/2 and IGF1R/insulin receptor attenuated pAkt T308 and showed synergistic effects on viability. Our findings indicate potential autocrine signaling where NF2 loss leads to secretion/activation of NRG1-ERBB3 signaling. mTORC1/2 inhibition downregulates NRG1-ERBB3, while upregulating pAkt T308 through an adaptive response involving IGF1R/insulin receptor and co-targeting these pathways may prove effective for treatment of NF2-deficient MN.","Experimental procedures Cell lines and reagents Human cell lines included an  NF2 -null immortalized MN line Ben-Men-1,  NF2  AC-CRISPR, and two independent human primary MN for which cell line establishment and growth conditions have been previously described ( 15 ,  54 ). All primary cultures were collected following Massachusetts General Hospital Human Subjects protocols for tumor acquisition after informed consent. In addition, we generated an immortalized human MN line, MN1-LF from an independent  NF2 -null human primary MN cell line derived from a surgical resection. Immortalization methods and confirmation was carried out on a fee-for-service basis by Alstem, Inc. Briefly, 1 × 10 5  cells were transduced with lentivirus encoding SV40 large T antigen and a puromycin resistance gene. Cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 2. Following selection with 1.5 μg/ml puromycin for 3 days, cells underwent an additional three passages. PCR amplification of SV40 was performed to confirm immortalization followed by expansion and freezing of cells. Reagents included exogenous heregulin/NRG1 (Sigma); inhibitor drugs lapatinib, erlotinib, INK128/TAK-228, and BMS-754807 (Selleck Chemicals); rapamycin (EMD Millipore); AZD2014 (obtained from AstraZeneca); and MM-121 (generously provided by Merrimack Pharmaceuticals). Drug treatment concentrations and times are described in the figure legends. Re-expression of  NF2  in Ben-Men-1 cells Re-introduction of  NF2  was performed using the full length cDNA coding sequence of  NF2  (isoform 1, NCBI accession # NM_000268 ) cloned into the lentiviral vector CSCW2 followed by packaging as previously reported ( 16 ). For re-expression, Ben-Men-1 cells were transduced with either NF2-CSCW2 or V-CSCW2 at a multiplicity of infection of 50 along with 8 μg/ml polybrene by spin-infection as previously described ( 15 ). Cells were then expanded and harvested for RNA/cDNA synthesis for quantitative RT-PCR, and protein lysates were generated for immunoblotting. Transcriptome/RNA-seq and analysis Baseline transcriptome analyses between  NF2 (−)  versus NF2 (+) ACs and Ben-Men-1 were previously described ( 21 ). For analysis of transcriptome in posttreated cells,  NF2 -null AC-CRISPR cells were first treated for 24 h with 200 nM INK128 or DMSO control (final concentration of 0.1% on cells) followed by harvesting on ice by scraping in ice-cold PBS. For transcriptome analyses, RNA was isolated from all MN-relevant lines using TRIzol reagent (15596026, ThermoFisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Pelleted cells were resuspended TRIzol reagent using microdounce homogenization then extracted with chloroform, followed by isopropanol precipitation of RNA from the aqueous phase and an 80% ethanol wash. RNA pellets were solubilized in 30 to 50 μl of RNase-free water (Ambion, AM9937). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent Bioanalyzer Tapestation 2200 (Agilent Technologies). For INK128 and DMSO-treated cell lines, mRNA libraries for RNA-seq were made in triplicate and sextuplicate, respectively, using TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Preparation Kits (RS-122-2101, RS-122-2102, or RS-122-2103; Illumina). Libraries were analyzed using D1000 tape on Agilent Tapestation 2200 and/or by qPCR using the KAPA Library Quantification Kits (KK4854, KAPABiosystems) on a LightCycler480 (Roche Life Science). These libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2500 platform, generating paired-end sequencing reads of 75 bp. Quality checking of sequence reads was assessed by fastQC (v.0.10.1) ( http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/ ). Libraries concentration was determined by Qubit, and quality assessment and average fragment length was determined by Agilent Tapestation. Equimolar 8- or 9-plex pools were run on a NextSeq 500 using a v2 high output 75 cycle kit. Sequence reads were aligned to human reference genome Ensembl GRCh37 (v.75), using STAR (v. 2.5.2a) ( 55 ) with parameters ‘–outSAMunmapped Within –outFilterMultimapNmax 1 –outFilterMismatchNoverLmax 0.1 –alignIntronMin 21 –alignIntronMax 0 –alignEndsType Local –quantMode GeneCounts –twopassMode Basic’. In this step, STAR also generated gene level counts for all libraries relying on the gene annotation provided for Ensembl GRCh37 (v. 75). Quality checking of alignments was assessed by a custom script utilizing Picard Tools ( http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/ ), RNASeQC ( 56 ), RSeQC ( 57 ), and samTools ( 58 ). Differentially expressed genes in pair-wise comparisons were identified by edgeR's quasi-likelihood F test (v. 3.18.1) ( 59 ), which was run at the R platform (v. 3.4) on genes with greater than 10 counts across replicates per condition in pair-wise comparisons. Quantitative RT-PCR RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis were carried out as previously described ( 15 ). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed in three biological replicates (in triplicate) on a Roche Lightcycler 480 (software version 1.5.0. SP3) employing iQ-SYBER Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Human primers included the following: for  NRG1 , one previously reported primer set ( 39 ) and a second primer set,  hNRG1 -F: 5ʹ-ATGTGTCTTCAGAGTCTCCCAT-3ʹ and  hNRG1 -R: 5ʹ-TGGACGTACTGTAGAAGCTGG-3ʹ (PrimerBank ID 408411a1,  http://pga.mgh.harvard.edu/primerbank/index.html ); for  HBEGF , one previously reported primer set ( 60 ) and a second primer set,  hHBEGF -F: 5ʹ-ATCGTGGGGCTTCTCATGTTT-3ʹ and  hHBEGF -R: 5ʹ-TTAGTCATGCCCAACTTCACTTT-3ʹ (PrimerBank ID 194018480c1); for  APLN , primer set  hAPLN -F: 5ʹ- GTCTCCTCCATAGATTGGTCTGC-3ʹ and  hAPLN -R: 5ʹ-GGAATCATCCAAACTACAGCCAG-3ʹ (PrimerBank ID 21314668a1); and for  TGFA , one previously reported primer set ( 60 ) and a second primer set,  hTGFA -F: 5ʹ-AGGTCCGAAAACACTGTGAGT-3ʹ and  hTGFA-R : 5ʹ-AGCAAGCGGTTCTTCCCTTC-3ʹ (PrimerBank ID 345842399c1). Controls included human  18S :  h18S -F, 5ʹ-ACCCGTTGAACCCCATTCGTGA-3ʹ and  h18S -R, 5ʹ-GCCTCACTAAACCATCCAATCGG-3ʹ as well as human  GAPDH :  hGAPDH -F, 5ʹ- CCCCGGTTTCTATAAATTGAGC-3ʹ and  hGAPDH -R, 5ʹ- CACCTTCCCCATGGTGTCT-3ʹ. Melt curves showed single peak specificity for each qRT-PCR primer set. Fold changes in gene expression were calculated using the comparative  CT  (threshold cycle) method, and expression levels were quantitated relative to control (normalized to 1.0). Column scatter plots were generated using Graphpad Prism 8, and data values are represented as mean ± SD. Within each group, Student  t  test was performed with a value of  p  < 0.05 considered significant. Immunoblotting and antibodies SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were carried out as previously described ( 10 ). Cells were lysed with either radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer as previously described ( 10 ) or 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer as described ( 46 ). Antibodies recognizing ERRB3 Y1197, ERBB3, EPHA2 S897, NDRG1 T346, Akt S473, Akt T308, Akt, p70S6K T389, p70S6K, ribosomal S6 S240/244, S6, IGF1R Y1135/36/IR Y1150/51, IGF1R, FOXO1/3a T24/T32, and FOXO3 were from Cell Signaling. Other antibodies included EPHA2 (Santa Cruz), secreted form of NRG1 (R&D Systems), NDRG1 (Abcam), and GAPDH (EMD Millipore). Anti-NF2/merlin polyclonal antibody has been previously described ( 61 ). NRG1 secretion and conditioned media experiments Experiments to examine secreted NRG1 were performed following previous reported methods with minor modifications ( 39 ). Briefly, AC-CRISPR or Ben-Men-1 cells were seeded at 1 × 10 6  cells/10 cm plate in full growth medium. The next day, cells were rinsed twice with PBS and once in serum-free DMEM (SF-DMEM), followed by addition of 10 ml SF-DMEM per plate. Cells were then incubated for 48 h. As a control, 10 ml of SF-DMEM was also added to cells and immediately collected (0 h). Next, 0 h- or 48 h-incubated medium was collected, briefly spun to remove debris, and then applied to an Amicon Ultra-15 3K filtration unit (EMD Millipore) followed by centrifugation at 3000 g  for ∼45 to 50 min. When total retentate volume was ∼700 μl, retentate was then transferred to an Amicon Ultra-0.5 ml 3K filtration unit (EMD Millipore), in two additions, and spun at 14,000 rpm until retentate reached a final volume of ∼200 μl. The resulting 0 h- or 48 h-concentrated media (0 h-CM or 48 h-CM) was collected, protease inhibitor cocktail (P8340, Sigma) was added (1 × final concentration), followed by immunoblotting of 40 μl for each sample. For conditioned medium experiments, isogenic  NF2 -expressing and  NF2 -null AC-CRISPR cell lines were seeded in full growth medium. The next day, cells were rinsed twice with PBS followed by addition of SF-DMEM to each cell line, which served as the source of conditioned medium. Cells were then incubated for 48 h, and then conditioned medium was harvested. For treatment,  NF2 -expressing AC-CRISPR cells were seeded in full growth medium and incubated until ∼70% confluency. The growth medium was then removed, and cells were rinsed twice in PBS followed by 6 h treatment using respective conditioned medium harvested above. Treated cells were then lysed, followed by immunoblotting. Cell viability and combination drug screening Drug screening assays for all cell lines were carried out in a 384-well format using the CellTiter-Glo cell viability kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Relative luminescence units were measured using the EnVision 2103 Multilabel Reader (Perkin Elmer). For single drug DRCs, cells were seeded 24 h before drug treatment at 400 cells/well. Treatments using MM-121, INK128, and BMS-754807 were performed in full growth conditions for 72 h, and treatment dosage is outlined in the figure legends. Percent viability was calculated (relative luminescence units of drug treated  versus  vehicle treated), and DRCs and drug concentrations inhibiting cell growth by 50% (IC50) were calculated using GraphPad Prism 8 by nonlinear regression (curve fit) analysis with ± standard error of the mean determined (at least three replicates/cell line). For drug synergy testing, INK128 and BMS-754807 were arrayed in a standard 10 × 10 dose matrix (three replicates/cell line). Cells were seeded as above and treated for 72 h, and percent viability was calculated for each treatment dosage point. Synergy scores were generated using the web-based SynergyFinder application ( https://synergyfinder.fimm.fi/ ) ( 33 ).",Roberta L Beauchamp; Serkan Erdin; Luke Witt; Justin T Jordan; Scott R Plotkin; James F Gusella; Vijaya Ramesh,The Journal of biological chemistry,2021,10.1074/jbc.RA120.014960,minimal,True
PMID:20176786,Bioluminescent approaches for measuring tumor growth in a mouse model of neurofibromatosis.,"Neurofibomatosis (NF1) patients are susceptible to multiple tumors of the nervous system including neurofibromas, optic glioma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), and astrocytoma. The Nf1+/-;Trp53+/- (NPcis) mouse model of NF1 spontaneously develops astrocytoma and MPNSTs that are very similar to human NF1 tumors. To use this model for testing potential therapeutics, we have developed systems that take advantage of bioluminescent reporters of tumor growth. We have generated E2F1 promoter-driving luciferase (ELUX) reporter mice to detect proliferating tumors in NPcis mice in vivo using bioluminescence. The power of this system is that it enables looking at tumor evolution and detecting spontaneous tumors at early stages of development as they evolve within their natural haploinsufficient microenvironment. This system can be used to identify tumors at different stages of tumorigenesis and to examine where spontaneous NF1 tumors initiate. The ability to rapidly screen multiple animals at a time increases the potential for use of this model in preclinical trials. This model will be valuable for the characterization of spontaneous NF1 tumors and will be important for studying the treatment and prevention of NF1 tumors in vivo.",,Jessica J Hawes; Karlyne M Reilly,Toxicologic pathology,2010-01,10.1177/0192623309357075,abstract_only,False
PMID:38321701,Patient-reported measures of tinnitus for individuals with neurofibromatosis type 2-related schwannomatosis: Recommendations for clinical trials.,"BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 2-related schwannomatosis is a genetic disease characterized by the development of bilateral vestibular schwannomas, ependymomas, meningiomas, and cataracts. Mild to profound hearing loss and tinnitus are common symptoms reported by individuals with neurofibromatosis type 2. While tinnitus is known to have a significant and negative impact on the quality of life of individuals from the general population, the impact on individuals with neurofibromatosis type 2 is unknown. Consensus regarding the selection of suitable patient-reported outcome measures for assessment could advance further research into tinnitus in neurofibromatosis type 2 patients. The purpose of this work is to achieve a consensus recommendation by the Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis International Collaboration for patient-reported outcome measures used to evaluate quality of life in the domain of tinnitus for neurofibromatosis type 2 clinical trials. METHODS: The Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis Patient-Reported Outcomes Communication Subgroup systematically evaluated patient-reported outcome measures of quality of life in the domain of tinnitus for individuals with neurofibromatosis type 2 using previously published Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis rating procedures. Of the 19 identified patient-reported outcome measures, 3 measures were excluded because they were not validated as an outcome measure or could not have been used as a single outcome measure for a clinical trial. Sixteen published patient-reported outcome measures for the domain of tinnitus were scored and compared on their participant characteristics, item content, psychometric properties, and feasibility for use in clinical trials. RESULTS: The Tinnitus Functional Index was identified as the most highly rated measure for the assessment of tinnitus in populations with neurofibromatosis type 2, due to strengths in the areas of item content, psychometric properties, feasibility, and available scores. DISCUSSION: Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis currently recommends the Tinnitus Functional Index for the assessment of tinnitus in neurofibromatosis type 2 clinical trials.","Methods The Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis Patient-Reported Outcomes Communication Subgroup systematically evaluated patient-reported outcome measures of quality of life in the domain of tinnitus for individuals with neurofibromatosis type 2 using previously published Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis rating procedures. Of the 19 identified patient-reported outcome measures, 3 measures were excluded because they were not validated as an outcome measure or could not have been used as a single outcome measure for a clinical trial. Sixteen published patient-reported outcome measures for the domain of tinnitus were scored and compared on their participant characteristics, item content, psychometric properties, and feasibility for use in clinical trials. Methods The REiNS International Collaboration is composed of more than 140 researchers, clinicians, and patient representatives who collaborate with the goal of achieving consensus on outcomes for clinical trials. For this work, REiNS clinician-researchers representing the disciplines of otology, otorhinolaryngology—head and neck surgery, audiology, speech-language pathology, as well as patient representatives, formed the PRO Communication subgroup. Following discussion by clinicians, researchers, and REiNS patient representatives, the PRO Communication subgroup sought to focus on identifying preferred PROMs used to assess tinnitus severity and associated QoL for use in clinical trials for NF2-related schwannomatosis. Members of the PRO Communication Subgroup met monthly via videoconferencing from March 2020 to February 2022 to identify and prioritize PROMs for review. Methods used to identify and select PROM measures for tinnitus have been described previously by Wolters et al. 
  The bibliographic databases PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar were searched for PROMs in April of 2020 using the keywords  27 
 tinnitus questionnaire ,  patient-reported outcome ,  neurofibromatosis type 2 , and  tinnitus outcome measure . No time frame for publication was limiting. Additional terms identified by these searches were added to identify potential inventories. Articles were also manually reviewed for other measures, resulting in two additional measures that were explored further and ultimately determined to be measures to be excluded from the review. After compiling a list of measures, clinicians/researchers within REiNS with expertise in tinnitus and hearing health reviewed and provided input on the list of measures to ensure that no measures were missing from the list. Measures were subsequently evaluated for inclusion criteria, where included measures were required to be (1) a PROM, (2) published and validated in English, and (3) used to assess tinnitus. A total of 19 PROMs for tinnitus were identified. Descriptions of identified PROMs were aggregated and provided to group members for initial review. Of the 19 identified PROMs, 2 were excluded because the measures were not validated as outcomes and/or had different items among forms translated into different languages. 
  One measure was excluded (i.e. the Client Oriented Scale of Improvement-Tinnitus) 28 
 
  because while it would be very useful for clinical settings as outcomes are selected by clinicians and patients collaboratively based on the patient’s individual needs, this measure would not be feasible in the context of a clinical trial because theoretically there could be a unique outcome measure for each study participant, limiting the researcher’s ability to draw conclusions from the entire sample of study participants on a single specific domain of interest. 29 
 The remaining 16 PROMs were submitted to a formal group review process using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Rating Acceptance Tool for Endpoints (PRO-RATE) form described and published previously. 
  The PRO-RATE form allowed for the numerical scoring and consequent comparison of the PROMs under evaluation. To summarize, PRO-RATE form scoring criteria includes (1) patient characteristics (age range assessed, availability of child self-report and/or parent proxy forms, published normative data from health and population of interest), (2) use in published studies (clinical trials and validation studies), (3) domains assessed and item content (thorough domain assessment, relevant to patients with NF, systematic item development), (4) scores available (response format, scoring, and standardization of scores), (5) psychometric properties (reliability, validity, sensitivity to change, factor analysis), and (6) feasibility for implementation (cost, length in terms of time required for completion, ease of administration, and language availability). 27 
 A score for each PRO-RATE form domain area was assigned for each PROM by individual reviews. Domain and total scores were then aggregated and averaged across all reviewers for inter-scale comparisons. Final meetings included re-reviews with side-by-side comparisons with group discussion on the strengths and limitations of top-rated measures. Throughout the process, clinician-researchers provided domain-specific knowledge, and patient representatives contextualized the relative importance and feasibility of completing tinnitus-specific PROMs during clinical trial participation.",Heather L Thompson; Jane Grabowski; Barbara Franklin; Kimberley S Koetsier; D Bradley Welling,"Clinical trials (London, England)",2024-02,10.1177/17407745231217279,minimal,True

PMID:6432917,The nature and origin of the melanin macroglobule.,"The melanin macroglobule (MMG), formerly called ""macromelanosome,"" is a cytoplasmic spherical granule formed in the melanocyte, varying in size from one to several microns, much larger than normal ellipsoidal melanosomes. Although ultrastructural features of MMG have been adequately described in the past, there has been a disagreement about the formation process of MMG. In order to further elucidate the nature and origin of MMG, electron microscopic studies were conducted in several pigmentary disorders. Our findings included: (1) The most remarkable characteristics of MMG are (a) the pleomorphism of their internal structure and (b) the variation of their size. (2) MMG do not represent true melanosomes but unique forms of autolysosomes resulting from the fusion of autophagosomes (containing various numbers of melanosomes) with primary and/or secondary lysosomes. (3) MMG are retained within melanocytes or transferred to keratinocytes and to Langerhans cells in the epidermis, and to macrophages in the dermis in any of their developmental stages. After transfer, MMG can fuse with other heterolysosomes and probably increase in size in these cells. We regard melanosome complexes as but one step in an autophagic process within melanocytes which can, on occasion, produce MMG as residual bodies.",,H Nakagawa; Y Hori; S Sato; T B Fitzpatrick; R L Martuza,The Journal of investigative dermatology,1984-08,10.1111/1523-1747.ep12263325,abstract_only,False
PMID:8320697,A genetic study of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) in south-western Ontario. II. A PCR based approach to molecular and prenatal diagnosis using linkage.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common, autosomal dominant genetic disorder with a variety of highly variable symptoms including cutaneous manifestations (such as café au lait spots), Lisch nodules, plexiform neurofibromas, skeletal abnormalities, an increased risk for malignancy, and the development of learning disabilities. The wide clinical variability of expression of the disease phenotype and high (spontaneous) mutation rate of the NF1 gene indicate that careful clinical examination of patients and family members is necessary to provide an accurate diagnosis of the disease. Since very few NF1 mutations have been identified, and with the apparent lack of a predominant mutation in this large, highly mutable gene, molecular diagnosis of NF1 will continue to be based on haplotypes using linkage analysis. Here we report our experiences while providing a molecular diagnostic service for NF1 in the ethnically diverse region of south-western Ontario. Molecular diagnoses with at least one informative probe/enzyme combination are reported for 19 families including two families requesting prenatal diagnosis for NF1. We have augmented the classical Southern based approach to linkage analysis with the use of PCR based assays for molecular linkage. Furthermore, criteria have been established in our laboratory for executing molecular linkage based on heterozygosity values, recombination fractions, and the use of intragenic probes/markers.",,D I Rodenhiser; P J Ainsworth; M B Coulter-Mackie; S M Singh; J H Jung,Journal of medical genetics,1993-05,10.1136/jmg.30.5.363,abstract_only,False
PMID:41022755,Development of an adeno-associated virus vector for gene replacement therapy of NF1-related tumors.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a tumor predisposition syndrome caused by alterations in NF1 gene that lead to tumor growth throughout the nervous system, which can cause morbidity and mortality, and transform to malignancy. NF1 gene replacement therapy, though promising, is hindered by NF1 gene's large size and delivery challenges. We introduced a membrane-targeted, truncated neurofibromin comprising the GAP-related domain (GRD) fused to the KRAS4B C-terminal domain, which effectively inhibits the RAS signaling pathway and restores Schwann cell differentiation in an NF1 iPSC-derived model. For systemic application, we engineered an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector using in vivo capsid evolution through sequential DNA shuffling and peptide library screening in a NF1 xenograft mouse model. This tailored vector, AAV-NF, exhibits greatly reduced liver uptake, enhanced tumor targeting across various NF1-related MPNST, neurofibromas and glioma models, and therapeutic efficacy in xenografts of MPNST. This study not only advances a viable AAV vector for NF1 treatment but also outlines a replicable strategy for vector and payload development in other monogenic and tumor-associated disease manifestations.","Methods Ethics Methods used in all experiments including the animal studies were in accordance with standards set by the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and the Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) at JHU.

IVIS Imaging was used to monitor the tumor growth. Two or three weeks after the ST88-14 or RHT92 implantation, respectively, 10 12  vg (viral genome) AAV-GRDC24 were injected via the tail vein. To mitigate potential side effects associated with high-dose AAV, in the treatment group with two 10 12  vg doses or one 2 × 10 12  vg dose of AAV-K55-GRDC24, dexamethasone (Dex) was injected IP shortly before AAV and 3 days per week at 5 mg/kg. In the treatment group with 10 12  vg of AAV9-GRDC24, Dex was injected IP in the same regime. To grow human plexiform NF (pNF) xenograft in mice, neurofibromaspheres were obtained by 3D culture of differentiating pNF iPSC-derived Schwann cells (SC) with pNF patient-derived  NF1  fibroblasts following the protocol established by Mazuelas et al. +/-  The neurofibromaspheres were implanted in the sciatic nerve of NSG mice. 29 JH-2-002 and JH-2-031 patient-derived xenografts (PDX) were obtained from the Johns Hopkins NF1 biospecimen repository, and were passaged as subcutaneous tumors in NSG mice .

After two weeks, tissues and tumors were harvested and vector genome was quantified by q-PCR using primers targeting CMV enhancer. Tumor size is permitted up to 2000 mm³ under the animal protocol approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) at the Johns Hopkins University. At no time did the tumor sizes exceed this limit. Mice were housed with a 12 h/12 h dark/light cycle, 20–23 °C ambient temperature and 40–60% humidity. AAV plasmids All the recombinant AAV vectors included the AAV2 Rep. The pscAAV plasmid was purchased from Cell Biolabs, Inc. and modified to include a CBh promoter containing CMV enhancer-chicken β-actin promoter-hybrid intron. pscAAV-GFP and pscAAV-GRDC24 (2163 bp between ITRs) were used to generate AAV-GFP and AAV-GRDC24. We obtained 13 hybrid pAAV-Rep-Cap (pAAV-RC) vectors, which encode the rep of AAV2 and variable cap genes of different serotypes. pAAV-RC3B, pAAV-RC4, pAAV-RC6 and pAAV-DJ were purchased from Cell Biolabs, pAAV2-RC was purchased from Stratagene, and pAAV2/1, pAAV2/5 JC, pAAV2/7, pAAV2/8, pAAV9n, pAAV2/rh10, pAAV2/hu11 and pAAV2/rh32.33 were obtained from Penn Vector Core of the University of Pennsylvania. The pHelper plasmid (Stratagene) and AAVpro-293T cells (Clontech) were used for AAV packaging. AAV production and purification The AAV production and purification followed the published protocol . The plasmid with transgene, pAAV-Rep-Cap, and pHelper were transfected in AAVpro-293T cells by Lipofectamine 2000 in DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS. Supernatant was collected on day 3 and 4 post-transfection and cells were harvested on day 4, and AAV was purified by iodixanol density gradients in an Optima XE-90 ultracentrifuge. Titers were determined by Q-PCR with primers targeted on Rep2 (5’ACAAATGTTCTCGTCACGTGGG3’, 5’-GACACGGGAAAGCACTCTAAAC-3’), GRD (5’ACCAGCGGAACCTCCTTCAGA3’, 5’GGCACTTCCTACTGCACCGA3’), EGFP (5’TTCAAGGAGGACGGCAACAT3’, 5’TCGATGTTGTGGCGGATCTT3’) or the promoters (CMV promoter: CAGTACATCAATGGGCGTGGAT, 5’GTCAATGGGGCGGAGTTGTTA3’; CBh promoter: 5’GGTAAACTGCCCACTTGGCAG3’, 5’CCCATAAGGTCATGTACTGGGC3’) with the linearized ITR-containing plasmids as standard. 48 AAV capsid DNA shuffling and in vivo selection The DNA shuffling procedure followed the previously published method with modifications . Twelve capsid DNA AAV 1-11 and 32/33 were cloned into the pBluescript II SK plasmid between the SpeI and XbaI sites and amplified by PCR. A total 1 µg of the 12 capsid DNA was digested by 0.1 µl DNAse I (Roche, #04716728001) at 25 °C for 75, 90 or 115 sec, after which the reaction was stopped by adding 10 mM EDTA and heating at 75 °C for 10 min. The sample with the best digestion time was determined by running a 1% agarose gel, which showed fragments predominantly around 200-300 bp. The fragments between 100 and 500 bp were harvested and subject to the primerless 1st PCR using Phusion polymerase (NEB). After the 2nd PCR using the flanking primers, the product was cloned into pITR-Rep2 vector containing AAV ITR and AAV2 Rep (Rep2) sequences between PacI and AscI sites using the Rapid DNA Ligation Kit (Roche). The ligation product was then transformed in MegaX DH10B Competent  20 , 21 E.coli  (Thermo Fisher) via electroporation and DNA was isolated with a QIAGEN Maxiprep kit. Colonies were counted on a dilution plate and the diversity of the shuffling library was estimated. AAV libraries were produced with AAVpro-293T production cells and purified with iodixanol density gradients. Two ST88-14-luc tumor-bearing NSG mice were injected IV with 5 × 10 11  vg of AAV library and after two weeks, animals were perfused and tumors were harvested and capsid DNA from both mice was recovered by PCR and pooled together to create the next round library. In vivo biopanning of random peptide library The creation of the 7mer random peptide followed the previously established procedure with modifications . The REP_AAP plasmid containing AAV2 Rep (Rep2) and AAP from AAV9, and the Acceptor plasmid containing ITRs, a modified AAV9 construct for library creation, and the SV40-polyA sequence flanked by lox71 and lox66 (LXSV) were kindly provided by Viviana Gradinaru at California Institute of Technology. The plasmid pITR-Rep2-LXSV was created to include ITRs, Rep2 and LXSV. The 557-2 capsid sequence was cloned in the pITR-Rep2-LXSV plasmid with PacI and AscI, and an AgeI site was introduced to AA 588-589 with site-directed mutagenesis. The 7mer random peptide library DNA was constructed by PCR using a primer with randomized 21mer nucleotides and by NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly (NEB). In the AAV library production, 100 ng of library DNA, 15 µg REP_AAP and 25 µg pHelper were used in each 15 cm plate of AAVpro-293T cells. AAV library was purified by iodixanol density gradients. 26 Two ST88-14-luc-cre tumor-bearing NSG mice were injected IV with 2.5 × 10 11  vg of AAV library and after 2 weeks, animals were perfused and tumors were harvested and capsid DNA from both mice was recovered by PCR and pooled together to create the next round library. The AAV libraries before, after first-round and second-round selection, were subject to NGS sequencing. The frequencies of unique 7mer peptide inserts were compared and an enrichment score of (second round/first round) * (first round/before) was calculated. From the mutants that had zero counts in the 1st round, resulting in infinite enrichment scores, we selected and tested 4. Altogether, 12 candidates were further validated by testing in ST88-14-luc tumor-bearing mice with AAVs packaged with GFP (Supplementary Data  1 - 3 ). Transmission electron microscopy Recombinant AAVs were stained with uranyl formate and analyzed with a Thermo-Fisher Talos L120C G2 transmission electron microscope by Barbara Smith at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Microscope Facility. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining The immunofluorescence staining followed the procedure described previously . Cells were grown in medium on chamber slides (Nunc) and washed with PBS and fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde solution and permeated with methanol for 2 min with three washes in PBS. The slides were first blocked by 10% goat serum in PBS for 30 min at room temperature and incubated with the first antibody and subsequently with goat or donkey AlexaFluor 488 (Green), goat AlexaFluor 594 (Red), or donkey AlexaFluor 555 (Red) secondary antibodis (Invitrogen) in 10% goat or donkey serum in PBS at room temperature. They were then washed three times in PBS and the nuclei were stained with DAPI. After staining, the slides were covered with mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and examined on a fluorescence microscope. 49 For IHC staining, tumors were preserved in 10% formalin and paraffin sections were obtained. Paraffin sections of tumors were deparaffinized, rehydrated, quenching in 1.875% H 2 O 2  in methanol and antigen-retrieved using the Citra buffer (Biogenex) as described . Briefly, following antigen-retrieval, the sections were blocked by 10% goat serum (Sigma, G9023) for 30 min at room temperature (RT), and incubated with the rabbit anti-GFP antibody (Cell Signaling, #2555) at 1:200 dilution in 10% goat serum solution in PBS with 0.2% Brij 35 overnight. Following the wash, the sections were incubated for 25 min with biotin-conjugated goat F(ab’)2 anti-rabbit IgG (JacksonImmunoResearch, 111-066-144) at 1:500 in 10% goat serum solution. After wash, the sections were incubated with streptavidin peroxidase (Biogenex, HK330-9KT) for 15 min. The staining was visualized with 3, 3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB, BioGenex) and counterstained with hematoxylin. 50 Cell viability assay The viable cells were measured with Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo Laboratories, Japan) containing WST-8 tetrazolium salt at 450 nm on a PerkinElmer NIVO plate reader. Three biological samples were measured in each experiment. Flow cytometry For apoptosis assay, ST88-14 cells were treated with AAVDJ-EGFP or AAVDJ-GRDC24 for 24 h at MOI 2000 in a six-well plate. Supernatant was collected and cells were washed by 1 ml PBS and treated by 200 µl accutase at 37 °C for 3–5 min. Cells were stained by Annexin V (FITC) following the procedure of the FITC Annexin Vi Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Pharmingen, #556547) and analyzed with a Beckman Coulter CytoFLEX flow cytometer. For quantification of AAV-GFP transduced xenograft tumor cells, we followed the procedure below. A dose of 10 12  vg of AAV-GFP was injected IV in a tumor-bearing mouse and after 2 weeks, the animal was euthanized and perfused. The tumor was cut into small pieces and processed by first vortexing and then shaking in a mixture of collagenase (Sigma, C7657, 10 mg/ml in PBS) and hyaluronidase (Sigma, H3506, 1.25 mg/ml in PBS) at 1:2 ratio at 37 °C/200-300 rpm for 8–12 min. The sample was then passed through a 70 µm cell strainer and rinsed with 3–5 ml PBS. If trace amount of blood was discernable, the sample would be further treated with ACK Lysing Buffer (Thermo Fisher). Tumor cells were then centrifuged and resuspended in 300–400 µl of 2% PFA and analyzed for GFP-positive cells with a Beckman Coulter CytoFLEX flow cytometer. An untreated xenograft tumor was used as negative control. Ten thousand cells were analyzed in one sample. AAV binding and neutralizing antibody assays Serum samples from healthy adults were purchased from Medix Biochemica (Maryland Heights, MO, USA) and Precision Biospecimen Solutions, Inc. (Bethesda, MD, USA). The AAV-binding antibody (B-Ab) assay was modified from the previous published methods . 10 51 , 52 10  vg AAV was coated in a 96-well ELISA plate (NEST, #504201) overnight at 4 °C in coating buffer (ThermoFisher, #CB01100). After five washes in PBS-T buffer (PBS with 0.1% Tween 20), the plate was blocked by incubating with 5% skim milk in PBS-T at RT. After three rinses in PBS-T, human serum samples diluted in 5% milk in PBS-T at the dilution factors 12.5, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, and 6400 were added and incubated at RT for 1 h. After three washes in PBS-T, wells were incubated with goat anti-human IgG conjugated with peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch, #109-035-088) for 1 h at RT and washed subsequently three times. Next, the wells were incubated with 1-Step TMB ELISA Substrate Solutions (Thermo Scientific, #34028), when color reaction was observed, stopped by the stop solution, and scanned in a plate reader at 450 nm. The wells with serum without AAV were used as control. The AAV-neutralizing antibody (N-Ab) assay followed the detailed method reported previously , using 2 × 10 53 4  2V6.11 cells and 4 × 10 7  vg AAV-K55-luc per well for the assay. Statistics and reproducibility The results are presented as a mean value plus or minus the standard deviation. Data were analyzed by GraphPad Prism 8.0. The  p -values were determined by a Student’s  t  test. A  p -value under 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. Sample sizes were chosen to achieve statistical significance. Western blotting, microscopic and TEM results were reproduced twice independently.

PMID:9458162,A rapid and sensitive protocol for competitive reverse transcriptase (cRT) PCR analysis of cellular genes.,"The specific analysis of gene transcripts is of increasing importance for studies in molecular pathology. Competitive RT-PCR with mutagenized exogenous competitor templates has evolved as an attractive approach to quantify individual mRNA levels. The generation of exogenous competitor RNAs usually requires mutagenesis and cloning of the mutant fragment into plasmids followed by in vitro transcription. In contrast to primer directed mutagenesis and in vitro transcription, preparation of the mutant fragments is a time consuming procedure. Here we report on a modified semi-quantitative RT-PCR protocol to circumvent the laborious cloning of mutant exogenous competitors. Templates for the in vitro transcription are generated in a single PCR reaction with simultaneous addition of a promoter sequence 5'of the forward primer and deletion of 10-20 nucleotides at the opposite end just ahead of the reverse primer binding site. The product of this PCR step serves as template for in vitro transcription to yield exogenous competitor RNA of equal quality and amount as conventional cloning strategies. Total RNA amounts are corrected for by analyzing the expression of different housekeeping genes in the same manner. One of the primers used in the following competitive RT-PCR reaction is labeled with a fluorescent dye for the analysis of target and exogenous competitor product on an semiautomated sequencer. In the present study, this protocol was employed to analyze the expression of the PTCH, Fas-receptor, NF-1, beta2-microglobulin and GAPD genes in human brain tumors. It will, however, be widely applicable to studies on cellular transcripts in biological specimens.",,A Waha; M Watzka; A Koch; T Pietsch; R Przkora; N Peters; O D Wiestler; A von Deimling,"Brain pathology (Zurich, Switzerland)",1998-01,10.1111/j.1750-3639.1998.tb00129.x,abstract_only,False
PMID:30571760,Neurofibromin haploinsufficiency results in altered spermatogenesis in a mouse model of neurofibromatosis type 1.,"The fertility of men with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is reduced. Despite this observation, gonadal function has not been examined in patients with NF1. In order to assess the role of reduced neurofibromin in the testes, we examined testicular morphology and function in an Nf1+/- mouse model. We found that although Nf1+/- male mice are able to reproduce, they have significantly fewer pups per litter than Nf1+/+ control males. Reduced fertility in Nf1+/- male mice is associated with disorganization of the seminiferous epithelium, with exfoliation of germ cells and immature spermatids into the tubule lumen. Morphometric analysis shows that these alterations are associated with decreased Leydig cell numbers and increased spermatid cell numbers. We hypothesized that hyper-activation of Ras in Nf1+/- males affects ectoplasmic specialization, a Sertoli-spermatid adherens junction involved in spermiation. Consistent with this idea, we found increased expression of phosphorylated ERK, a downstream effector of Ras that has been shown to alter ectoplasmic specialization, in Nf1+/- males in comparison to control Nf1+/+ littermates. These data demonstrate that neurofibromin haploinsufficiency impairs spermatogenesis and fertility in a mouse model of NF1.","Materials & methods Experimental animals The NF1 mouse model used in this study has been described elsewhere [ 29 ].  Dsk9  is a missense mutation in the GTPase-activating protein related domain of neurofibromin.  Nf1 Dsk9/+  (subsequently referred to as “ Nf1 +/- ”) mice were maintained on a mixed (C3HeB/FeJ x C57bl/6) background. All surgical and animal care procedures were approved by the University of British Columbia Committee on Ethics of Animal Experiments (IACUC Approval # A11-0117), and were conducted in accordance to the University’s Guidelines for Animal Experiments ( https://animalcare.ubc.ca/animal-care-committee/policies-and-guidelines ). For the breeding studies, male or female  Nf1 +/-  mice were bred with  Nf1  control littermates. For breeding studies, we used three haremed cages in which female  +/+ Nf1 +/-  mice were crossed to male  Nf1  control littermates and three haremed cages in which male  +/+ Nf1 +/-  mice were crossed to female  Nf1  control littermate. We also examined breeding records from additional six cages using the same crosses that were not haremed. +/+ Tissue isolation procedure Nf1 +/-  and  Nf1 control littermate mice were weighed prior to surgical procedures. Animals were sacrificed using isoflurane followed by cervical dislocation at 6 to 7 months of age. The testes and epididymis were isolated from the lower abdominal cavity and placed in ice-cold HEPES-PSS buffer (PH 7.4) containing 10mM HEPES, 6mM glucose, 1.8mM CaCl, 130mM NaCl, 4mM KCl, 4mM NaHCO +/+ 3 , 1.2mM MgSO 4 , 1.2mM KH 2 PO 4 , and 0.03mM EDTA. The testes were cleaned of fat, weighed, and either fixed in 10% formalin or flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C for histological staining and Western blotting, respectively. Within 30 minutes of isolation, the cauda epididymis, where mature sperm are stored, was cleaned of fat and dissected from the corpus epididymis and the vas deferens. The cauda epididymis was minced and placed into 500 μL of HEPES-PSS buffer for 30 minutes in order to release spermatozoa into the buffer. Spermatozoa were centrifuged at 15000 rpm for 1 minute and re-suspended in 500 μL of HEPES-PSS buffer. Sperm were counted in a hemocytometer using 10 μL of the sperm suspension. A minimum of 100 sperms per chamber were counted to reduce statistical dispersion. Histology Following fixation in 10% formalin, testis samples were dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. Five-micrometer transverse sections were stained using standard hematoxylin and eosin or Masson trichrome staining protocols (Sigma Aldrich, ON, Canada). Sections were viewed and imaged using an Olympus BX61 upright light microscope and Q imaging Retiga Exi camera with  InVivo  3.2.0 software (Media Cybernetics). Computerized quantitative morphometric analysis was performed using Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics). Testicular morphometric analysis Testicular volume was measured using the formula for a prolate (elongated) ellipsoid ( ) [ 4 3 π a b 2 30 ], where  “a”  is the major axis (polar diameter) and  “b”  is the minor axis (equatorial radius). The width and equatorial length of the testes were measured on testicular histological images using Image J1.45s, version 1.44p (NIH, Bethesda, MD). We found that testicular volume was significantly correlated with mouse size (R2 = 0.5, p = 0.02). Therefore, we divided testicular volume by the body weight of each mouse to yield volume per unit weight to normalize for mouse size. Seminiferous tubule size was measured at a final magnification of 200X using Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Rockville, MD). To ensure comprehensive coverage of the testes, five rectangles of equal dimensions were randomly placed on the image. Within each of five grids placed on the histology image, 400 equidistant points were counted by manually tagging the cell type on which the point fell. A total of 2000 points were counted in each testis. If the point fell on white space within the seminiferous tubule, it was characterized as ‘intratubular space’, and if the point fell on white space outside the tubules, it was characterized as ‘interstitial space’. The lumen of the tubules was included as part of the spermatid count. Distinction was not made between a round or elongating spermatid. Germ cell count included both spermatogonia and spermatocytes. Sertoli cells, germ cells, and round and elongated spermatids in the seminiferous tubules were expressed as a percentage of the total cell population of the tubule. The cross section of the tubule in which cells were enumerated also included intracellular space. The density and distribution of Sertoli cells, germ cells, spermatids and Leydig cells within the testis were measured on a complete section at a final magnification of 200X using Image-Pro Plus software. Within each of the five rectangles, five tubules were randomly selected and the diameter of each axis (i.e. the lengths and widths) were measured. The five rectangles covered over 70% of the section and each rectangle had between 15–25 tubules within it so five tubules covered at least 20% of the tubules present. Tubules with a length-to-width ratio less than or equal to 1.5 were considered to be round or nearly round and were included in the analysis of seminiferous tubule size. At least 25 tubules were measured per testis (50 tubules per mouse) for both  Nf1  control and  +/+ Nf1  mice. +/- Western blotting Flash-frozen isolated testes from  Nf1 and  +/+ Nf1 +/-  mice were homogenized in a pre-chilled stainless-steel mortar and pestle. The resulting tissue powder was mixed in 50 μL of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50mM pyrophosphate, 50mM NaF, 50mM NaCl, 5mM EDTA, 5mM EGTA, 100μM Na 3 VO 4 , 10mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/mL leupeptin, and 1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride.

PMID:25377441,Development and validation of the English Pain Interference Index and Pain Interference Index-Parent report.,"OBJECTIVE: Measurement of pain interference in children is challenged by a lack of validated measures with a parent proxy report. This study investigated the psychometric properties of the Pain Interference Index (PII), a six-item questionnaire originally developed in Swedish, in chronically ill youth. METHODS: We adapted the PII for English-speaking participants and created a parallel parent proxy measure. Respondents indicate how much pain has interfered with the child's life in the past 2 weeks (0-6 scale); higher scores indicate more pain interference. Eligible participants included individuals 6-25 years with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and cancer. Internal consistency was assessed; validity was examined by correlating PII scores with existing measures of pain interference (Modified Brief Pain Inventory [MBPI]) and pain intensity (visual analogue scale [VAS]), and with measures of disease severity. RESULTS: Among 60 participants (mean age 14.7 years, range 6-24) and their parents, PII internal consistency was 0.84 and 0.96, respectively. PII scores correlated with MBPI (r = 0.81, P < 0.0001) and VAS (r = 0.55, P < 0.0001) scores and differentiated between patients with mild vs moderate/severe NF1 disease severity (P < 0.05). The PII-Parent was significantly correlated with the mothers' and fathers' VAS rating of the child's pain intensity (Ps < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Internal consistency of the English PII is high; validity is supported by the PII's correlations with other measures of pain interference and pain intensity, and with disease severity in patients with NF1. Preliminary data indicate that the English PII is a reliable, valid, feasible pain interference measure for youth with NF1 and cancer.","Methods. We adapted the PII for English-speaking participants and created a parallel parent proxy measure. Respondents indicate how much pain has interfered with the child’s life in the past 2 weeks (0–6 scale); higher scores indicate more pain interference. Eligible participants included individuals 6–25 years with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and cancer. Internal consistency was assessed; validity was examined by correlating PII scores with existing measures of pain interference (Modified Brief Pain Inventory [MBPI]) and pain intensity (visual analogue scale [VAS]), and with measures of disease severity. Materials and Methods Eligible patients included children, adolescents, and young adults (6–25 years of age) with NF1 or cancer (solid tumor or leukemia) who were enrolled on a medical research protocol at a government research institute. (We included participants up to 25 years as measures that span from childhood to young adulthood are preferable for longitudinal research.) Next, patients must have been accompanied by at least one parent who was willing to participate. If more than one parent was present, both were invited to participate. Sixty-three families who were identified as eligible were approached during routine out-patient clinic visits (92%) or in their room on the inpatient unit (8%). Of these, three chose not to participate due to lack of interest or time (response rate = 95.2%). Patients were administered a battery of four questionnaires in randomized order. In addition to the PII, patients completed previously validated measures of pain interference (Modified Brief Pain Inventory [MBPI] [ 23 ]) and pain intensity (Faces Pain Scale-Revised [FPS-R] [ 24 ]; Pain Rating Scale [PRS] [ 25 ]). Parents completed the PII-P and the parent version of the PRS in random order to assess their child’s pain interference and pain intensity, respectively. Parent report versions of the PII and PRS were administered in random order as well. Demographic and medical information were obtained through medical chart review. Additionally, a nurse practitioner (A. B.) rated all patients with NF1 in terms of symptom severity (mild, moderate, or severe) and number of NF1-related disease complications. Due to a smaller number of patients with NF1 who were rated as moderate or severe compared with mild, the moderate and severe ratings were combined into one category (moderate/severe). Measures PII The original PII measure is a six-item self-report questionnaire that assesses pain interference using the past 2 weeks as a recall period [ 22 ]. Respondents rate items on a 0–6 scale to indicate how much pain has interfered with various activities, and the total score is the mean of the six items. Preliminary reliability of the Swedish version is good (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.84). Initial translation of the items into English was performed by the Swedish research group that developed the instrument (R.W.), consisting of bilingual (i.e., Swedish and English) psychologists. The English translation was analyzed by the first and third authors (American psychologists familiar with the topic). A few adjustments were made to improve the precision (adding examples) and flow (replacing “manage” with “do”) of the text. Next, the English version was translated back to ascertain that it reflected the same item content as the original version. No further adjustments were required, and the questionnaire was considered adequate by both the originator of the instrument and the American authors. The final English version is presented in  Appendix 1 . PII-Parent The six-item PII-P is formatted and scored in the same manner as the self-report PII, with total scores ranging from 0 to 6. The authors changed the items on the PII to reflect the parent’s point of view, such that the parents respond about the extent to which pain interferes with their child’s daily life. MBPI The MBPI, adapted from the adult Brief Pain Inventory [ 26 ], is a 12-item self-report questionnaire that measures pain interference and has been used with children and adolescents ages 8–20 years [ 23 , 27 ]. Patients are asked to indicate the extent to which pain interfered with various activities in the past week, with scores ranging from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes). A total score is obtained by taking the mean of the scores for all 12 items; thus, the total score can range from 0 to 10. Cronbach’s alpha reliability estimates range from 0.77 to 0.91 [ 23 , 27 ], and construct validity is strong as demonstrated through its association with concurrent pain intensity [ 27 ]. FPS-R The FPS-R is a one-item tool designed to provide an overall indicator of pain intensity at the time of the assessment [ 24 ]. Respondents choose one of six faces with varying expressions to indicate how much pain they feel. The faces are scored as 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 points, so 0 = no pain and 10 = very much pain. The FPS-R has been validated in children as young as 4 years [ 28 ]. PRS The PRS is a two-item visual analogue scale (VAS) developed by the authors (P. W. and S. M.) that assesses pain intensity by asking the respondent to draw a mark on a 100-mm line to indicate his or her 1) current level of pain and 2) most important pain in the past week. Only the second item was included in analyses for this study. The phrase “most important pain” was used to enable patients to identify the pain that was most important to them as many of them have pain in multiple locations. The PRS includes verbal descriptors (low, medium, high, extreme) and a face at each anchor to help patients orient their position on the line, as recommended by Averbuch and Katzper [ 29 ]. The distance in millimeters from the beginning of the line to the patient’s mark is the score. VAS scales are commonly used to assess pain in pediatric populations, and evidence exists to support their reliability and validity [ 30 ]. The PRS has been used in children with medical conditions involving chronic pain [ 25 ]. PRS-Parent The Pain Rating Scale-Parent version (PRS-P) is similar to the VAS self-report PRS in terms of item content and format. Parents are asked to draw a mark on a 100-mm line to indicate their child’s level of pain currently, and on another line, they indicate their child’s most important pain in the past week; the second item was included in the current analyses. Like the self-report PRS, the PRS-P lines also include verbal descriptors (low, medium, high, extreme) and a face at each anchor to help orient the respondent’s position on the line. Scores for each item can range from 0 to 100. NF1 Disease Severity The nurse practitioner who typically conducts physical examinations with the patients with NF1 completed two measures of disease severity based on the results of her examination and retrospective chart review. First, the NF Disease Severity Scale, adapted by our group from Ablon [ 31 ], asks the medical professional to rate the patient’s symptoms as mild, moderate, or severe. Verbal descriptions for each category are provided and ask the rater to consider how the patient’s symptoms affect their overall physical well-being and daily functioning. The second indicator of disease severity, the NF1 Disease Complications Scale, is a checklist designed by a multi-disciplinary team of medical experts in NF1 at the National Institutes of Health. A medical professional notes the presence/absence of 18 diagnoses and physical complications related to NF1 (e.g., scoliosis, chronic headaches, pseudoarthrosis). The total severity score is the sum of the endorsed diagnoses. Inter-rater reliability and construct validity of this measure have been supported [ 32 ]. Statistical Analyses Cronbach’s coefficient alphas were calculated for the PII and for the PII-P, with mothers’ and fathers’ data examined separately. Pearson correlations between the two PII scales and the other pain scales (MBPI, FPS-R, PRS) were computed to assess concurrent validity. Analyses of variance (ANOVAs) and chi-square tests of independence were used to compare disease type (cancer and NF1) on demographic variables (patient age, gender, race, parent education). No differences were significant, except that patients with cancer were slightly older ( M  age = 15.9 ± 4.0) than patients with NF1 ( M  age = 13.6 ± 4.4;  F  = 4.65,  P  < 0.05). Thus, age was entered as a covariate in the analyses that examine differences between disease groups on pain scores. We also categorized patients by age to further examine differences between younger and older children in PII scores; we first separated children into groups of 6–12 years vs 13 years and older, and then into groups of 6–9 years vs 10 years and older to assess the validity of the PII in young children. Separate analyses were conducted using data from the NF1 patient group to investigate construct validity; specifically, Pearson correlations and ANOVAs were used to explore relationships between PII scores and disease severity. ANOVAs with post hoc Tukey comparisons and correlations were used to determine differences on the pain measures across pain medication status (yes or no) and demographic variables. Alpha was set at 0.05.",Staci Martin; Shawn Nelson Schmitt; Pamela L Wolters; Brittany Abel; Mary Anne Toledo-Tamula; Andrea Baldwin; Rikard K Wicksell; Melinda Merchant; Brigitte Widemann,"Pain medicine (Malden, Mass.)",2015-02,10.1111/pme.12620,minimal,True
PMID:29408605,Nf2 Mutation in Schwann Cells Delays Functional Neural Recovery Following Injury.,"Merlin is the protein product of the NF2 tumor suppressor gene. Germline NF2 mutation leads to neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), characterized by multiple intracranial and spinal schwannomas. Patients with NF2 also frequently develop peripheral neuropathies. While the role of merlin in SC neoplasia is well established, its role in SC homeostasis is less defined. Here we explore the role of merlin in SC responses to nerve injury and their ability to support axon regeneration. We performed sciatic nerve crush in wild-type (WT) and in P0SchΔ39-121 transgenic mice that express a dominant negative Nf2 isoform in SCs. Recovery of nerve function was assessed by measuring mean contact paw area on a pressure pad 7, 21, 60, and 90 days following nerve injury and by nerve conduction assays at 90 days following injury. After 90 days, the nerves were harvested and axon regeneration was quantified stereologically. Myelin ultrastructure was analyzed by electron microscopy. Functional studies showed delayed nerve regeneration in Nf2 mutant mice compared to the WT mice. Delayed neural recovery correlated with a reduced density of regenerated axons and increased endoneurial space in mutants compared to WT mice. Nevertheless, functional and nerve conduction measures ultimately recovered to similar levels in WT and Nf2 mutant mice, while there was a small (∼17%) reduction in the percent of regenerated axons in the Nf2 mutant mice. The data suggest that merlin function in SCs regulates neural ultrastructure and facilitates neural regeneration, in addition to its role in SC neoplasia.","Experimental procedures Mice The total number of animals used in our study was 20. P0SchΔ39-121 transgenic mice were obtained from Riken Bioresource Center (Tsukuba, Japan). P0SchΔ39-121 heterozygous mice express a dominant negative form of merlin with an in-frame deletion of exons 2 and 3, mimicking pathological mutations found in NF2 patients ( Giovannini et al., 1999 ,  Giovannini et al., 2000 ). The expression of the transgene is limited to SCs since the gene is expressed under the control of a SC-specific P0 promoter. WT FVB mice were obtained from Jackson Labs (Bar Harbor, ME). Surgery Adult mice (3 months old) were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (40mg/kg; 5mg/kg, IP). A short incision was made overlying the quadriceps muscle in the right hind limb. Blunt dissection was performed to expose the sciatic nerve. Once isolated, the nerve was crushed for 30 seconds using a flat hemostatic forcep. The contralateral (left) nerves were uncrushed serving as controls. The use of animals and procedures performed were approved by the University of Iowa Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Sciatic functional recovery The animals (n=9 WT, n=11 P0SchΔ(39-121)) were followed for 90 days and functional recovery of sciatic nerve function prior to surgery at 7, 21, 60 and 90 days was assessed. We used the CatWalk XT (ver. 8, Noldus Information Technology, Wageningen, The Netherlands) system to study the functional recovery of the nerve. The method for conducting the CatWalk gain analysis has been described ( Yang et al., 2012 ). Transit time and transit path parameters were set in the software and the mice were put on the walkway containing a pressure pad. The more pressure exerted, the larger the total area of skin-floor contact and thus the brighter the pixel. All areas containing pixels brighter than a pre-set threshold value were analyzed. The mean paw contact area and mean print area were determined for each step from each hind paw print (right and left side) and averaged for each run. Data were collected from three runs for each animal at each time point and averaged. The examiner was blind to genotype. Nerve conduction testing After exposing the affected nerve and prior to sacrifice 90 days after operation, nerve conduction velocity and amplitude testing were performed. A Grass neurostimulator was used to deliver stimuli starting with ten single electrical pulses followed by trains of pulses from 2 to 10 Hz. Stimulation electrodes were placed at the proximal end of the nerve and recording electrodes were placed at the distal end. Amplitude was kept constant during the testing and was the minimal current needed to induce a full action potential. Digital recordings at 50 kHz (using Windaq DI-720 hardware with Pro+ software) were made. The amplitude of the stimulation potential and the resultant distal nerve ending action potential was measured using the root mean square algorithm. The time from the beginning of the stimulation potential to the beginning of the distal action potential representing the conduction velocity across the exposed nerve fiber was measured in microseconds. Histology and Stereology After completion of the electrophysiology, the sciatic nerves were dissected and 2-3 mm segments distal to the crush site on the injured side and an equivalent level on the uninjured mice were placed in freshly made 4% paraformaldehyde for at least 24 h. Samples were post-fixed in OsO4, dehydrated in an ethanol series, and embedded in Spurr’s resin. For unbiased stereological analysis, a series of semithin sections (0.5μm) were stained with toluidine blue and images captured with a Leica DMR III microscope and CCD camera running Metamorph software (Molecular Devices, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Nerve fibers were counted using the 2D dissector method as described by Raimondo et al ( Raimondo et al., 2009 ). A sampling grid containing multiple 1120 μm 2  circular counting frames was used. Counts were averaged from >5 sections per nerve. For morphometric analyses, ultrathin sections (80-100 nm) were cut and placed on copper grids after verifying correct (transverse) orientation. Samples were then stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Sections were viewed on a Jeol JEM 1230 transmission electron microscope (EM). Ten fields of view per nerve sample were selected randomly and digital electron micrographs were taken at 1000X. Using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD), g-ratios were calculated on the EM micrographs as ratios of internal to external perimeters of the myelin sheath, creating a measure of myelin thickness. The examiner was blind to genotype. Statistics Differences among means for each group were analyzed by using t-tests and one way ANOVA using SigmaPlot software (Systat, San Jose, CA). We tested for and found normal distrubutions and equal variances in all sampled distrubutions with the exception of the data comparing percentage of endoneurial space. In this case, Mann Whitney Rank Sum Test was employed. A  p  value < 0.05 was considered significant.",Kristy Truong; Iram Ahmad; J Jason Clark; Alison Seline; Tyler Bertroche; Brian Mostaert; Douglas J Van Daele; Marlan R Hansen,Neuroscience,2018-03-15,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2018.01.054,minimal,True
PMID:38387803,Development of a vestibular schwannoma tumor slice model for pharmacological testing.,"BACKGROUND: Our goal was to develop a 3D tumor slice model, replicating the individual tumor microenvironment and for individual pharmaceutical testing in vestibular schwannomas with and without relation to NF2. METHODS: Tissue samples from 16 VS patients (14 sporadic, 2 NF2-related) were prospectively analyzed. Slices of 350 µm thickness were cultured in vitro, and the 3D tumor slice model underwent thorough evaluation for culturing time, microenvironment characteristics, morphology, apoptosis, and proliferation rates. Common drugs - Lapatinib (10 µM), Nilotinib (20 µM), and Bevacizumab (10 µg/ml) - known for their responses in VS were used for treatment. Treatment responses were assessed using CC3 as an apoptosis marker and Ki67 as a proliferation marker. Standard 2D cell culture models of the same tumors served as controls. RESULTS: The 3D tumor slice model accurately mimicked VS ex vivo, maintaining stability for three months. Cell count within the model was approximately tenfold higher than in standard cell culture, and the tumor microenvironment remained stable for 46 days. Pharmacological testing was feasible for up to three weeks, revealing interindividual differences in treatment response to Lapatinib and intraindividual variability in response to Lapatinib and Nilotinib. The observed effects were less pronounced in tumor slices than in standard cell culture, indicating the model's proximity to in vivo tumor biology and enhanced realism. Bevacizumab had limited impact in both models. CONCLUSION: This study introduces a 3D tumor slice model for sporadic and NF2-related VS, demonstrating stability for up to 3 months, replication of the schwannoma microenvironment, and utility for individualized pharmacological testing.",,Vera Nickl; Jonathan Fakler; David Ziebolz; Charlotte Rumpel; Linus Stabenow; Johanna Bernhagen; Eva Rampeltshammer; Ralf-Ingo Ernestus; Mario Löhr; Isabel Gugel; Cordula Matthies; Camelia M Monoranu; Carsten Hagemann; Maria Breun,Journal of neuroscience methods,2024-05,10.1016/j.jneumeth.2024.110082,abstract_only,False
PMID:21111000,A novel imaging-compatible sciatic nerve schwannoma model.,"Benign schwannomas are common tumors of the cranial and peripheral nerves, causing pain and loss of function. The development of effective therapy for these tumors has been hampered by the lack of relevant experimental in vivo models for convenient testing. Here, we describe a novel schwannoma model in which an immortalized human schwannoma cell line, HEI-193, established from an neurofibromatosis type 2 patient, has been stably transduced with fluorescent protein and luciferase reporters and implanted within the sciatic nerve of nude mice. These cells reliably formed a tumor within several weeks which had pathologic characteristics of schwannoma tumors. This model system will be useful for investigation of schwannoma biology and for preclinical assessment of therapeutic agents.","3. Methods Human schwannoma cell line HEI-193 was established from a benign schwannoma tumor from an NF2 patient immortalized with retroviral mediated HPV E6-E7 gene expression and obtained from the House Ear Institute ( Hung et al., 2002 ). These cell lines have been transduced with lentivirus expressing Fluc and mCherry genes as described previously ( Saydam et al., 2009 ) and were cultured as described previously ( Hung et al., 2002 ). 3.1 Tumor implantation and bioluminescence imaging HEI-193 cells were trypsinized, rinsed, and implanted in 1 µl culture medium into the sciatic nerve of athymic mice (nu/nu, 5-week-old females; Cox 7 breeding facility, MGH).  In vivo  bioluminescence imaging was performed, as described previously ( Saydam et al., 2009 ). 3.2 HC staining Immunohistochemistry with immunofluorescent staining was conducted, as previously described ( Brenner et al., 2004 ). mCherry was visualized directly.

Specimens were photographed under optical microscope and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) with ultra-high accuracy of detail, including depth of field. Patients were followed up for a minimum of 4 years and up to a maximum of 12 years, postsurgery. While all nonrecurring lesions showed intense fluorescence, six of the seven lesions with absence of fluorescence under CLSM recurred at a mean of 5.5 years after surgical excision. Among the re-excised lesions, 3 were diagnosed as malignant at the subsequent removal.

PMID:24958239,SVA retrotransposon insertion-associated deletion represents a novel mutational mechanism underlying large genomic copy number changes with non-recurrent breakpoints.,"BACKGROUND: Genomic disorders are caused by copy number changes that may exhibit recurrent breakpoints processed by nonallelic homologous recombination. However, region-specific disease-associated copy number changes have also been observed which exhibit non-recurrent breakpoints. The mechanisms underlying these non-recurrent copy number changes have not yet been fully elucidated. RESULTS: We analyze large NF1 deletions with non-recurrent breakpoints as a model to investigate the full spectrum of causative mechanisms, and observe that they are mediated by various DNA double strand break repair mechanisms, as well as aberrant replication. Further, two of the 17 NF1 deletions with non-recurrent breakpoints, identified in unrelated patients, occur in association with the concomitant insertion of SINE/variable number of tandem repeats/Alu (SVA) retrotransposons at the deletion breakpoints. The respective breakpoints are refractory to analysis by standard breakpoint-spanning PCRs and are only identified by means of optimized PCR protocols designed to amplify across GC-rich sequences. The SVA elements are integrated within SUZ12P intron 8 in both patients, and were mediated by target-primed reverse transcription of SVA mRNA intermediates derived from retrotranspositionally active source elements. Both SVA insertions occurred during early postzygotic development and are uniquely associated with large deletions of 1 Mb and 867 kb, respectively, at the insertion sites. CONCLUSIONS: Since active SVA elements are abundant in the human genome and the retrotranspositional activity of many SVA source elements is high, SVA insertion-associated large genomic deletions encompassing many hundreds of kilobases could constitute a novel and as yet under-appreciated mechanism underlying large-scale copy number changes in the human genome.","Materials and methods Patients The deletions analyzed in this study were identified by MLPA analysis (P122-C1 NF1-area kit, MRC-Holland, The Netherlands) in 17 unrelated NF1 patients who were referred for molecular diagnostics to the participating institutions (Tables S23 and S24 in Additional file  1 ). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Ulm University (application number 129/09) and the Hamburg Medical Association (PV3291) and we adhered to their rules. Either the patients or their parents gave their informed consent to the molecular characterization of the deletions. High-molecular-weight DNA samples extracted from blood of the patients were analyzed in order to identify the breakpoint locations. Custom-designed MLPA and array CGH To determine the positions of the deletion breakpoints more precisely, we performed custom-designed MLPA analysis with probes established previously (Table S25 in Additional file  1 ) [ 23 ]. By means of this analysis, the breakpoint regions could be assigned to intervals of a few tens of kilobases (Table S26 in Additional file  1 ). Next, we performed targeted array CGH using 8 × 15 K arrays (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with probes located within the deletion breakpoint regions as predicted by the MLPA analyses. This array CGH probe-set included 4,891 control probes as well as 10,853 test probes. The details of probe design, as well as the analysis of the array, are described in Figure S24 (Additional file  1 ). Breakpoint identification by PCR Breakpoint-spanning PCRs were performed using the Expand Long Template PCR system (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The locations of the PCR primers were selected on the basis of the array CGH results (Table S27 in Additional file  1 ). The resulting PCR products were gel-purified (Zymoclean™ Gel DNA Recovery Kit, Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA) and sequenced with the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Life Technologies, Darmstadt, Germany). Sequence alignments of the breakpoint-spanning PCR products against the reference sequence of the human genome (hg19) indicated the precise locations of the respective deletion breakpoints. Somatic cell hybrids and PCR analysis Hybrid cell lines harboring only the chromosome 17 with the deletion were established for patients 659, 619, 1106, DA-77 and ASB4-55 using Epstein-Barr virus-transformed cell lines according to the procedure described previously [ 8 ]. Using DNA isolated from the hybrid cell lines, we performed PCR and sequence analysis of the respective products in order to narrow down the locations of the deletion breakpoints. Identification of large insertions at the deletion breakpoints in two patients Inverse PCR, semi-specific PCR, as well as GenomeWalker™ analysis were employed to investigate the insertions at the deletion breakpoints of patients DA-77 and ASB4-55. Inverse PCR, as schematically described in Figure S25 (Additional file  1 ), was performed with the restriction enzymes and PCR primers listed in Tables S28 and S29 (Additional file  1 ). Semi-specific PCRs, employed according to the principle described in Figure S26 (Additional file  1 ), were performed with primers summarized in Tables S30 and S31 (Additional file  1 ). PCR products obtained from these assays were then investigated by sequence analysis. To perform GenomeWalker™ analysis (Clontech, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France), genomic DNA (2.5 μg per experiment) was restriction digested and adaptors were ligated to the DNA fragments. Subsequently, PCR was performed with an adaptor-specific primer in combination with a primer located close to the breakpoint regions (Figure S27 in Additional file  1 ). PCRs were performed with the Advantage® 2 PCR Kit (Clontech). The corresponding PCR products were gel-purified (S.N.A.P.™ UV-Free Gel Purification Kit, Invitrogen, USA) and cloned for sequence analyses. The restriction enzymes used for each experiment, together with the region-specific primers, are listed in Tables S32 and S33 (Additional file  1 ). Analysis of the breakpoint-flanking sequences Two datasets of sequences were analyzed in order to investigate whether non-B DNA-forming sequences, direct and inverted repeats ≥ 6 bp, or retrotransposons were overrepresented in the regions flanking the atypical  NF1  deletion breakpoints. The dataset of deletion breakpoint-flanking sequences included 150 bp located centromeric and 150 bp located telomeric to each deletion breakpoint (Table S3 in Additional file  1 ). The control dataset included sequences that did not flank any known atypical  NF1  deletion breakpoints; these control sequences were located within 17q11.2, telomeric to  SUZ12P  (genomic region: 29,118,000-29,148,000; hg19) and between  RAB11FIP4  and  COPRS  (30,020,000-30,050,000; hg19). In total, the control dataset encompassed 60 kb of genomic DNA subdivided into 200 fragments of 300 bp each. Within each 300 bp fragment, a hypothetical breakpoint was assigned a location between nucleotides 150 and 151 (Table S4 in Additional file  1 ). This control dataset, as well as the breakpoint-flanking sequences of the  NF1  deletions, were screened for the presence of non-B DNA sequence motifs (Tables S3 and S4 in Additional file  1 ). To this end, we used the non-B DNA database and the non-B DNA Motif Search Tool under preset search criteria for direct repeats (length: 10 to 150 bp, separated by < 10 bp) and inverted repeats (length: 6 to 150 bp, separated by <100 bp) [ 88 ]. In addition, we screened both datasets for the presence of direct and inverted repeats using the MEME suite software [ 89 ], which detects repeats irrespective of whether or not they are capable of forming non-B DNA structures. The repeats considered had a minimum length of 6 bp with no restriction being placed upon the number of nucleotides between the repeats. Both datasets were also investigated for the presence of retrotransposons by means of the UCSC Repeat Masker track [ 90 ] (Tables S3 and S4 in Additional file  1 ). In order to search for direct and inverted repeats >150 bp exhibiting ≥ 87% sequence homology within 2 kb regions flanking the deletion breakpoint regions, we performed BLASTN [ 91 ] self-alignments of the respective regions. The number of such repeats was also determined in a control dataset of sequences derived from two genomic regions: one located telomeric to  SUZ12P  (genomic position: 29,118,000-29,210,000; 92 kb), the other between  RAB11FIP4  and  COPRS  (genomic position: 30,020,000-30,048,000; 28 kb). In total, these two regions comprised 120 kb of genomic DNA, which were subdivided into 30 fragments of 4 kb each. Hypothetical breakpoints were assigned locations between nucleotides at positions 2,000 and 2,001 of each of these 4 kb fragments. BLASTN alignments of 20 kb regions flanking the deletion breakpoints were performed to determine the occurrence of direct and inverted repeats ≥ 1 kb exhibiting ≥ 87% sequence homology. Somatic mosaicism Mosaicism of normal cells and cells harboring the  NF1  deletion was sought in eight NF1 patients by FISH analysis of blood lymphocytes cultivated for 72 h in the presence of phytohaemagglutinin. In each case, at least 200 interphase nuclei were analyzed. When buccal cells were available for FISH analysis, approximately 100 interphase nuclei were evaluated. Mosaicism was also investigated by microsatellite marker analysis of DNA isolated from peripheral blood samples as described previously [ 8 ] and by PCR and sequence analysis of the insertion/deletion polymorphism rs17884042.

PMID:29982664,EPH receptor signaling as a novel therapeutic target in NF2-deficient meningioma.,"BACKGROUND: Meningiomas are the most common primary brain tumor in adults, and somatic loss of the neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene is a frequent genetic event. There is no effective treatment for tumors that recur or continue to grow despite surgery and/or radiation. Therefore, targeted therapies that either delay tumor progression or cause tumor shrinkage are much needed. Our earlier work established mammalian target of rapamycin complex mTORC1/mTORC2 activation in NF2-deficient meningiomas. METHODS: High-throughput kinome analyses were performed in NF2-null human arachnoidal and meningioma cell lines to identify functional kinome changes upon NF2 loss. Immunoblotting confirmed the activation of kinases and demonstrated effectiveness of drugs to block the activation. Drugs, singly and in combination, were screened in cells for their growth inhibitory activity. Antitumor drug efficacy was tested in an orthotopic meningioma model. RESULTS: Erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular receptor tyrosine kinases (EPH RTKs), c-KIT, and Src family kinase (SFK) members, which are biological targets of dasatinib, were among the top candidates activated in NF2-null cells. Dasatinib significantly inhibited phospho-EPH receptor A2 (pEPHA2), pEPHB1, c-KIT, and Src/SFK in NF2-null cells, showing no cross-talk with mTORC1/2 signaling. Posttreatment kinome analyses showed minimal adaptive changes. While dasatinib treatment showed some activity, dual mTORC1/2 inhibitor and its combination with dasatinib elicited stronger growth inhibition in meningiomas. CONCLUSION: Co-targeting mTORC1/2 and EPH RTK/SFK pathways could be a novel effective treatment strategy for NF2-deficient meningiomas.",,Steven P Angus; Janet L Oblinger; Timothy J Stuhlmiller; Patrick A DeSouza; Roberta L Beauchamp; Luke Witt; Xin Chen; Justin T Jordan; Thomas S K Gilbert; Anat Stemmer-Rachamimov; James F Gusella; Scott R Plotkin; Stephen J Haggarty; Long-Sheng Chang; Gary L Johnson; Vijaya Ramesh,Neuro-oncology,2018-08-02,10.1093/neuonc/noy046,abstract_only,False
PMID:32642737,Assessing interobserver variability and accuracy in the histological diagnosis and classification of cutaneous neurofibromass.,"BACKGROUND: Cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs) are the most common tumors in people with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and are associated with reduced quality of life. There is currently no widely accepted standardized language for describing cNFs clinically or histopathologically. The objective of this study was to evaluate interobserver agreement across pathologists in describing and reporting of neurofibromas involving the skin. METHODS: Twenty-eight (H&E)-stained slides of cNF were scanned using an Aperio XT scanner. The digital images were reviewed by 6 pathologists, who entered free text of up to a 200 word description for each case into a REDcap database. Responses were analyzed for the most commonly used terms based on frequency, as well as agreement (reported as concordance) between reviewers. RESULTS: A set of the terms most commonly used by pathologists for the histological classification of cNF along with areas of agreement and disagreement have been identified. The study shows that there was strong agreement across reviewers that not all neurofibromas involving the skin are cutaneous neurofibromas and regarding the presence or absence of atypical features and heterologous elements. Areas of less concordance were identified and include cNF subtypes, definition of extension and pattern of growth, as well as the distinction of a cNF from a plexiform without an intraneural component involving skin. CONCLUSIONS: This work is the first step towards development of a robust classification system and devising ""gold standard"" histopathologic diagnostic criteria for cutaneous neurofibromas.","Methods Twenty-eight (H&E)-stained slides of cNF were scanned using an Aperio XT scanner. The digital images were reviewed by 6 pathologists, who entered free text of up to a 200 word description for each case into a REDcap database. Responses were analyzed for the most commonly used terms based on frequency, as well as agreement (reported as concordance) between reviewers. Methods The study was approved by the appropriate institutional review boards. Deidentified histopathology pictures of neurofibromas involving the skin from patients diagnosed with NF1 were obtained from the French national referral center (NF1 Ile de France). Samples were biopsied or resected between 01 April 2014 and 31 April 2017 and analyzed in the Department of Pathology of Henri Mondor hospital. Tumors were removed by surgery and/or laser. Tumors with morphological artifacts hampering interpretation were excluded from this study. All samples were paraffin-embedded sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Samples analyzed ( N  = 28) were from 12 women and 5 men (age range of 15–62, mean age 44) at the time of biopsy or resection. The lesions ranged from 0.2 to 3.0 cm (mean size 1.2 cm and median size 0.9 cm, measured by soft ruler). The samples were resected from skin from the scalp, fingers, shoulder, arm, cheek, foot, ankle, and back and processed routinely for histopathology. The hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained slides were scanned using an Aperio XT scanner. Digital slides were downloaded using the native image format, Aperio SVS files and analyzed using the CaloPix viewer (TRIBVN-HEALTHCARE, Chatillon, France), and digital images were shared with the reviewers through the internet. Individual reviews were conducted by 4 neuropathologists and 2 dermatopathologists, who evaluated each image and entered free text of up to a 200 word description for each case into a REDcap database.  A total of 168 reviews were received for the 28 slides assessed by the 6 reviewers. Concordance by reviewers was evaluated as % agreement, defined as 100% = 6 of 6 reviewers agree, 83% = 5 of 6 reviewers agree, 67% = 4 of 6 reviewers agree, 50% = 3 of 6 reviewers agree, 33% = 2 of 6 reviewers agree, and 17% = comment made by one reviewer only. Concordance was considered “strong” when >50% of reviewers (i.e., at least 4 reviewers) were in agreement for >50% of the slides evaluated. Responses were analyzed for the most commonly used terms based on frequency, as well as agreement (reported as concordance) between reviewers. Concordance was considered “weak” when agreement from a majority of reviewers (at least 4 of 6) was not ever observed, and 3 or less of 6 reviewers (≤50%) were in agreement for a majority of the slides. All other scenarios were considered to have “mixed” concordance. 21",Nicolas Ortonne; Steven L Carroll; Fausto J Rodriguez; Douglas C Miller; Rosalynn M Nazarian; Jaishri O Blakeley; Zachary B Madaj; Sharad K Verma; Anat Stemmer-Rachamimov,Neuro-oncology advances,2020-07,10.1093/noajnl/vdz050,minimal,True
PMID:2551169,Transplacental induction of peripheral nervous tumor in the Syrian golden hamster by N-nitroso-N-ethylurea. A new animal model for von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis.,"Multiple peripheral nervous tumors were induced in 45 of 60 (75.0%) Syrian golden hamsters by transplacental administration of N-ethyl-N-nitro-sourea. Moreover, melanomas, pheochromocytomas, and Wilms' tumors developed in six (10.0%), three (5.0%), and 13 (21.7%) animals, respectively. The histologic, immunohistochemical, and electron microscopic findings of the peripheral nervous tumors were similar to those of human neurofibroma, and their growth pattern and distribution resembled those of human von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis (VRNF). The occurrence of melanoma, pheochromocytoma, and proliferative foci of melanin-containing cells in neurofibroma suggests that the targets of ENU in hamsters are the neural crest-derived cells. With its high incidence of Wilms' tumor, the hamster with ENU-induced tumors is considered to be a good animal model for human neurocristopathy, including VRNF.",,T Nakamura; M Hara; T Kasuga,The American journal of pathology,1989-08,,abstract_only,False

PMID:26478990,A novel diagnostic method to detect truncated neurofibromin in neurofibromatosis 1.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic condition caused by dominant loss-of-function mutations of the tumor suppressor gene NF1 that encodes neurofibromin, a negative regulator of RAS activity. Mutation analysis of NF1 located at 17q11.2 has been hampered by the large size of the gene, the high rate of new mutations, the lack of mutational clustering, and the presence of several homologous loci. To date, about 80% of the reported NF1 mutations are predicted to result in protein truncation, but very few studies have correlated the causative NF1 mutation with its effect at the protein level. We evaluated a novel diagnostic method to detect truncated forms of neurofibromin in a large cohort of unrelated subjects suspected of having NF1, according to the NIH consensus criteria. Western blot analysis was carried out on protein extracts from patients' leukocytes to highlight the possible presence of altered neurofibromin as a result of mutations in NF1. Truncated neurofibromin was identified in 274/336 patients (81%), confirming the usefulness and reproducibility of the proposed diagnostic approach. Our methodology can be routinely applied in the diagnostic setting, thanks to its simplicity and reliability. Combined with molecular approaches, it may increase the accuracy and efficiency of NF1 genetic testing. We evaluated a novel diagnostic method to detect truncated forms of neurofibromin in patients fulfilling the clinical criteria for Neurofibromatosis 1.

PMID:38931352,PET Imaging of Neurofibromatosis Type 1 with a Fluorine-18 Labeled Tryptophan Radiotracer.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a neurocutaneous disorder. Plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) are benign tumors commonly formed in patients with NF1. PNFs have a high incidence of developing into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) with a 5-year survival rate of only 30%. Therefore, the accurate diagnosis and differentiation of MPNSTs from benign PNFs are critical to patient management. We studied a fluorine-18 labeled tryptophan positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer, 1-(2-[","4. Materials and Methods The materials and methods section describes the radiosynthesis and quality control of L-[ 18 F]FETrp, the in vitro evaluation of [ 18 F]FETrp in a biodistribution study, and the in vivo validation of L-[ 18 F]FETrp through static and dynamic PET scans, comparing the imaging results with FDG. We also performed immunohistostaining (IHC) studies to examine the enzyme expression levels for tryptophan metabolism.  4.1. Materials for Radiosynthesis of L-[ 18 F]FETrp The chemicals and supplies were purchased from vendors as reported. L-[ 18 F]FETrp was purified according to published procedures [ 22 ]. In brief, a semi-preparative chiral HPLC column equipped with a chiral HPLC guard column and a short C18 column was integrated into the PETCHEM module to facilitate the purification. Quality control of L-[ 18 F]FETrp was performed in an Agilent Infinity 1260 HPLC system. An Agilent ChemStation software (version C.01.07) was used for data analysis. The identity of the target radiotracer was authenticated by comparing the retention time of L-[ 18 F]FETrp with the non-radiolabeled reference standard L-FETrp. D-FETrp was used to determine the enantiomeric excess value of the radiotracer.  4.2. Radiolabeling Hardware and Software L-[ 18 F]FETrp was radiosynthesized in a custom-manufactured module purchased from PETCHEM Solutions Inc. (Pinckney, MI, USA). The module consists of four major components: (1) an input multiple vial positioner (MVP) for adding and drying aqueous [ 18 F]fluoride solution and transferring reaction reagents during radiolabeling, (2) an output MVP for venting the reaction vessel and rinsing the reaction mixture, (3) a purification compartment consisting of a semi-preparative chiral HPLC column and a short C18 column, and (4) a formulation MVP for L-[ 18 F]FETrp fraction collection and reformulation. The module features a small reaction vessel (1.5 mL) that allows flexible temperature control, multiple radioactivity detectors to monitor [ 18 F]fluoride transfer and elution, a reaction vessel, and mixture loading and purification. In addition, the system includes a six-position switching valve, a 5-mL sample loop, an isocratic HPLC pump, and an ultraviolet (UV) detector.  4.3. Radiosynthesis and Quality Control of L-[ 18 F]FETrp The radiosynthesis of L-[ 18 F]FETrp followed the reported procedures with minor modifications [ 22 ]. In brief, [ 18 F]fluoride (12–18 GBq) from a commercial source was trapped and released to a 1.5 mL reaction vessel, and the radiolabeling precursor (1–2 mg) in anhydrous acetonitrile (0.5 mL) was added to the reaction vessel containing dried [ 18 F]fluoride. The mixture was heated at 100 °C for 10 min. Upon completion of [ 18 F]fluoride incorporation, hydrochloric acid (aqueous solution, 2 M) in acetonitrile (0.5 mL, 1/1,  v / v ) was added to acidolyze the  tert -butyloxycarbonyl and  tert -butyl groups at 100 °C for 10 min. Then, the reaction mixture was neutralized with a basic solution (2 M NaOH, 0.25 mL) and passed through an Alumina N Sep-Pak and a C8 Sep-Pak for HPLC purification using the same mobile phase and conditions as we reported [ 22 ]. Quality control of the final radiopharmaceutical was performed in an Agilent 1260 Infinity system equipped with a Carroll-Ramsey radiation detector and an analytical chiral HPLC column. The analytical HPLC was used to determine the chemical purity, radiochemical purity, and enantiomeric excess. The isocratic mobile phase for analyzing the quality control samples consisted of 30% water and 70% USP ethanol at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The detection wavelength was set at 230 nm. An optically pure and non-radiolabeled L-FETrp standard reference at a concentration of 1 µg/mL and a racemic mixture of L,D-FETrp at a concentration of 5 µg/mL were run in the analytical HPLC column to validate the system, according to our reported procedure [ 22 ]. The enantiomeric purity was determined using the ratio of the peak area differences to the summed areas of L- and D-[ 18 F]FETrp. An enantiomeric purity of no less than 90% was used for imaging studies. The L-[ 18 F]FETrp identity was authenticated by comparing the retention time between the radioactivity peak and optically pure non-radiolabeled reference standard. The retention time of the L-[ 18 F]FETrp radiometric peak within ±10% compared with the retention time of the L-FETrp UV peak is considered acceptable.  4.4. Biodistribution Study and PET Imaging All animal experiments followed applicable institutional and national guidelines for the care and use of animals. The study was approved by the Nemours Institutional Committee for the Care and Use of Animals. The NF1 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and bred at Nemours. The triple mutant line from the vendor carries Trp53, Nf1, Suz12 mutations on chromosome 11 and develops tumors at approximately four months, which is similar to conditions found in human NF1 patients [ 25 , 48 ]. Genotyping was performed to determine Trp53, Nf1, and Suz12 triple mutant and wild-type mice [ 49 ]. The following polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers were used for the genotyping: Trp53, TGGATGGTGGTATACTCAGAGC (common), CAGCCTCTGTTCCACATACACT (mutant forward), AGGCTTAGAGGTGCAAGCTG (wild-type forward); Nf1, GGTATTGAATTGAAGCAC (wild-type forward), TTCAATACCTGCCCAAGG (common), ATTCGCCAATGACAAGAC (mutant forward); Suz12, CAGGTCTTCGAATGCTGAGTC (common), AGAGAGGGAGAAGGAGAAGCA (wild- type reverse), CTTCACATCCATGCTGAGGA (mutant reverse). For biodistribution studies, two groups were included (Trp53, Nf1, and Suz12 triple mutant group and wild-type group). The mice were injected with L-[ 18 F]FETrp (0.7–2.2 MBq, 100 µL) via tail vein ( n  = 3–6 per study group) under 3–5% isoflurane in oxygen at 5, 30, 60, and 90 min post-injection, and euthanized. Heart, lung, liver, muscle, fat, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, stomach, blood, bone, and brain for both groups were harvested. All samples were weighed, and the radioactivity in these organs was assayed using an automated PerkinElmer 2480 gamma counter (Downers Grove, IL, USA) with a standard radiotracer dilution. Data were plotted to examine the biodistribution of L-[ 18 F]FETrp in the peripheral organs, tissues, and brains by normalizing the body weight and injected dose. The percentage of the injected dose per gram of tissue (ID%/g) was used to calculate the radiotracer uptake. The statistical analysis was performed with a two-tailed paired Student’s  t -test. The statistics were considered significant if the  p -value was less than 0.05.  Static and dynamic PET imaging in wild-type and NF1 tumor mice was performed in a PerkinElmer G4 microPET scanner. The animals were anesthetized using isoflurane in oxygen (3–5% isoflurane) five minutes before imaging. The mice were checked for lack of response to toe pinch before initiating the injection procedure; then, mice were injected with L-[ 18 F]FETrp in sodium acetate solution or FDG (0.8–2.2 MBq in 100 µL) via the tail vein. The mice were immediately placed onto the temperature-controlled imaging bed under 0.5–2% isoflurane/oxygen anesthesia for imaging duration. The respiration rate was closely monitored through a built-in scanner camera to prevent animals from moving in the chamber. Dynamic PET scans were performed for one hour in list mode immediately after injection of the radiotracer. Then, the animals were euthanized before regaining consciousness from deep isoflurane anesthesia, followed by cervical dislocation.  4.5. Image Reconstruction and Data Analysis Images were reconstructed on the G4 PET scanner with defined parameters. For 60-min dynamic scans, the list mode data were binned into six frames (10 min × 6). For the PET quantification, regions of interest (ROIs), including tumor, heart, brain, lungs, liver, kidney, and muscle, were defined manually on the six 10 min frames post-injection of L-[ 18 F]FETrp or FDG and applied to all other frames. ROIs were manually drawn with VivoQuant software version 4.0 (Invicro, Needham, MA, USA) following image normalization based on weight and injected dose, and PET imaging data analysis was performed using VivoQuant. The ROIs were drawn by a team member and validated by a nuclear medicine technologist to avoid any bias. The resulting quantitative data were reported in standardized uptake values (SUVs). SUVs were calculated as the ratio of regional averaged radioactivity (becquerel per cubic centimeter) to the injected radioactivity (becquerel per gram body weight). 4.6. Immunohistochemistry After PET imaging, the mice were euthanized. Tumors and other organs of interest were dissected and fixed with formalin. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples were created from our core lab following standard histological processing. The samples were cut at 5 µm on a Leica RM2255 microtome (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA) and floated onto Superfrost ®  Plus slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Fremont, CA, USA). The sections were heat immobilized for 60 min at 60 °C and stored at −20 °C until ready to stain. Slides were equilibrated to room temperature. The slides were then placed on the Leica Bond RX Stainer (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA), where they were dewaxed using Bond Dewax Solution (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA), then rinsed with Bond Wash Solution (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA). Heat retrieval was performed using the following conditions: ER 1 Citrate Buffer (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA) for 20 min at 100° for IDO staining, ER 2 EDTA (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA) for 20 min at 100° for TDO2 staining, ER 2-EDTA Buffer (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA) for 20 min at 100° for AHR staining. Then, the slides were stained using the Bond Polymer Refine Detection Kit (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA). The slides were incubated in their prospective antibodies for 30 min: indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase rabbit monoclonal (1:100, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), AHR antibody mouse monoclonal (1:50, Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA), antibody-TDO2, rabbit/IgG polyclonal (1:100, Proteintech, Rosemont, IL, USA), and then rinsed using Bond Wash Solution, followed by the Post Primary for 8 min and incubated in the Peroxide Block for 5 min. After additional rinses of Bond Wash Solution, the slides were developed in the 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) kits for 10 min, rinsed, and then counter-stained with hematoxylin from the kit. The slides were rinsed in deionized water, then removed from the Bond RX and placed on the Sakura Tissue-Tek ®  Prisma™ Automated Stainer (Sakura, Torrance, CA, USA), where they were dehydrated, cleared, and then mounted in Permount ®  (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Fremont, CA, USA). 4.7. Statistical Analysis  Continuous variables were summarized by means and standard deviations (means ± SD). Biodistribution data were summarized to present the radioactivity uptake in each organ over time for the two groups: wild-type control mice and Trp53, Nf1, and Suz12 triple mutant mice. Three-dimensional ROIs were manually drawn within PET images using VivoQuant 4.0 software. PET studies included static scans in NF1 tumor mice with L-[ 18 F]FETrp and FDG, dynamic PET scans in wild-type mice, and NF1 tumor mice with L-[ 18 F]FETrp and FDG. The statistical analysis was performed with a two-tailed paired Student’s  t -test with a significance level of <0.05 and a confidence level of 95%. 4.1.

PMID:28126595,Global Proteome and Phospho-proteome Analysis of Merlin-deficient Meningioma and Schwannoma Identifies PDLIM2 as a Novel Therapeutic Target.,"Loss or mutation of the tumour suppressor Merlin predisposes individuals to develop multiple nervous system tumours, including schwannomas and meningiomas, sporadically or as part of the autosomal dominant inherited condition Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2). These tumours display largely low grade features but their presence can lead to significant morbidity. Surgery and radiotherapy remain the only treatment options despite years of research, therefore an effective therapeutic is required. Unbiased omics studies have become pivotal in the identification of differentially expressed genes and proteins that may act as drug targets or biomarkers. Here we analysed the proteome and phospho-proteome of these genetically defined tumours using primary human tumour cells to identify upregulated/activated proteins and/or pathways. We identified over 2000 proteins in comparative experiments between Merlin-deficient schwannoma and meningioma compared to human Schwann and meningeal cells respectively. Using functional enrichment analysis we highlighted several dysregulated pathways and Gene Ontology terms. We identified several proteins and phospho-proteins that are more highly expressed in tumours compared to controls. Among proteins jointly dysregulated in both tumours we focused in particular on PDZ and LIM domain protein 2 (PDLIM2) and validated its overexpression in several tumour samples, while not detecting it in normal cells. We showed that shRNA mediated knockdown of PDLIM2 in both primary meningioma and schwannoma leads to significant reductions in cellular proliferation. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive assessment of the NF2-related meningioma and schwannoma proteome and phospho-proteome. Taken together, our data highlight several commonly deregulated factors, and indicate that PDLIM2 may represent a novel, common target for meningioma and schwannoma.","2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Clinical Samples Meningioma and schwannoma specimens were collected after patients consented to the study and given a unique MOT identification number. This study was granted full national ethics approval by the South West research ethics committee (REC No: 14/SW/0119; IRAS project ID: 153,351) and local research and development approval (Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust: R&D No: 14/P/056 and North Bristol NHS Trust: R&D No: 3458). Normal human Schwann cells were collected after ethical approval under the REC number REC6/Q2103/123. The brain tumour material was obtained from the Imperial brain tumour bank and this sub-collection is covered by Imperial College Tissue bank ethics. All meningioma samples used in this study were grade I. 2.2 Cell Culture Human meningeal cells (HMC) were obtained from Sciencell™ and maintained in the manufacturer's recommended media at 5% CO 2 . Human primary Schwann/schwannoma cells were maintained as described previously (Rosenbaum 2000). Ben-Men-1 cells and primary meningioma cells were routinely grown in DMEM, 10% FBS and 100 U/ml Penicillin/Streptomycin, and were kept at 5% CO 2 /37 °C. 2.3 Phospho-protein Purification Phospho-proteins were isolated from cell lysates using the commercially available phospho-protein purification kit from Qiagen®. The manufacturers reported an enrichment of over 80% with less than 5% phosphorylation in the flow-through fraction. Similarly Meimoun et al. reported an enrichment of 88% using this kit ( Meimoun et al., 2007 ). The protocol was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions using 2.5 mg of starting material. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA protein assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. 2.4 In-gel Digestion Cells were lysed in the buffer provided with the phospho-protein purification kit. 50 μg of protein and corresponding isolated phospho-protein were separated  via  SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with colloidal coomassie blue stain (Life Technologies) for 3 h at room temperature (RT). Destaining was performed using MS grade water (Fisher) overnight at RT. Individual lanes were cut into small 1 mm × 1 mm pieces before in-gel digestion as described previously ( Lasonder et al., 2002 ). The protocol was performed as follow per slice: equilibration in 200 μl of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) for 5 min at 37 °C, destaining in 200 μl of 50% acetonitrile (ACN)/50% H 2 O for 5 min at 37 °C then 200 μl of 100% ACN for 5 min at 37 °C. These steps were performed in triplicate. 200 μl of reduction buffer (10 mM dithiothreitol in ABC) was added to the gel slices and incubated for 20 min at 56 °C. Slices were then shrunk using 100% ACN for 5 min at RT and alkylated using 200 μl of alkylation buffer (23.35 mg 2-choloroacetamide, 5 ml 50 mM ABC) for 20 min at RT in the dark. The gel pieces were incubated with digestion buffer (12.5 ng/μl trypsin in ABC) overnight at 37 °C. Digested peptides were extracted by the addition of 2% Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to the digestion buffer incubated for 20 min on a shaker at 37 °C. Peptide solutions were transferred to fresh tubes, and 100 μl of buffer B (80% ACN, 0.5% acetic acid, 1% TFA) was added to the gel pieces and incubated for a further 20 min on a shaker at 37 °C. The buffer B solution was then combined with the solution from the first peptide extraction, and samples were concentrated in a DNA centrifuge (Labconco CentriVap®) until less than 40 μl of sample was left. Samples were then dissolved in buffer A (0.5% acetic acid, 1% TFA) prior to MS analysis. 2.5 Peptide Purification With Stage Tips Stage tips were assembled by placing high performance C18 extraction disks into pipette tips as described ( Rappsilber et al., 2003 ). 50 μl of methanol was added to the prepared stage tips and centrifuged until the whole volume passed through. This was repeated with buffer B (80% acetonitrile, 0.5% acetic acid) and then twice with buffer A (0.5% acetic acid). Samples were added to stage tips and centrifuged (1 min; 10,000 ×  g  at RT). 50 μl of buffer A was then added and centrifuged until all the volume had passed through. Peptides were eluted by addition of 20 μl of buffer B and centrifugation. The samples were concentrated using a speed vac before resuspension in buffer A to give a final volume of approximately 25 μl ( Rappsilber et al., 2003 ). 2.6 Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry MS was carried out using an Ultimate 3000 UPLC system (Thermo Fisher, Germany) connected to an Orbitrap Velos Pro mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, Bremen, Germany). The prepared peptides were loaded on to a 2 cm Acclaim™ PepMap™ 100 Nano-Trap Column (Thermo Fisher, Germany) and separated by a 25 cm Acclaim™ PepMap™ 100 Nano LC column (Thermo Fisher, Germany) packed with C18 beads of 3 μm and running a 120 min gradient of 95% buffer A/5% buffer B (buffer A contains 0.5% acetic acid and buffer B contains 0.5% acetic acid in 100% acetonitrile) to 65% buffer A/35% buffer B and a flow rate of 300 nl/min. Eluted peptides were electrosprayed into the mass spectrometer at a spray voltage of 2.5 kV. The Orbitrap instrument performs data acquisition in a data dependent mode to switch between MS and MS2. The Orbitrap cell with a resolution of 60,000 acquires a full-scan MS spectrum of intact peptides ( m / z  350–1500) with an automated gain control accumulation target value of 1000,0000 ions. In the linear ion trap the ten most abundant ions are isolated and fragmented by applying collision induced dissociation using an accumulation target value of 10,000, a capillary temperature of 275 °C, and normalized collision energy of 30%. A dynamic exclusion of ions previously sequenced within 45 s was applied. Any singly charged ions and unassigned charged states were excluded from sequencing and a minimum of 10,000 counts was required for MS2 selection. Dynamic exclusion is a widely used tool in mass spectrometry data acquisition software enabling more proteins to be identified and increase proteome coverage ( Zhang et al., 2009 ). 2.7 Protein Identification Andromeda search engine integrated in MaxQuant version 1.3.05 programme was used to identify the proteins in the Uniprot database ( www.uniprot.org/downloads , November 2015) and supplemented with sequences of frequently observed contaminants. A mass tolerance of 6 ppm for the parental peptide and 0.5 Da for fragmentation spectra and a trypsin specificity allowing up to 2 mis-cleaved sites were set as the Andromeda search parameters. Fixed modifications of carboxyamidomethylation of cysteines and variable modifications of oxidation of methionine, deamidation of glutamine and asparagine were set. A minimal peptide length of 7 amino acids was set. MaxQuant performed an internal mass calibration of measured ions and peptide validation by the target decoy approach as described. Proteins and peptides with a better than 1% false discovery rate (FDR) were accepted if they had been identified by at least 2 peptides in one of the samples. Shared peptide sequences (razor peptides) were mapped to proteins by the principle of maximum parsimony in MaxQuant. Proteins were quantified by normalized summed peptide intensities computed as label free quantification (LFQ) values in MaxQuant 1.3.05 ￼ ( Cox et al., 2014 ) LFQ data was generated in triplicate for all samples. LFQ data was generated in triplicate for all samples. 2.8 Quantification Analysis LFQ data generated by Maxquant were processed using Microsoft Excel and specially developed proteomics software, Perseus ( Tyanova et al., 2016 ). LFQ values for proteins and phospho-proteins were Log 2  transformed and fold change (FC) was calculated based on the equation: Average Log 2  LFQ tumour - Average Log 2  LFQ control. Entries with 0 for LFQ were kept and included in the fold change calculations. A 2 sample  t -test was performed generating  p -values for each identified protein/phospho-protein. The proteins with a  p -value < 0.05 were considered differentially expressed and included in further analysis. Significantly changed phospho-proteins were compared against respective protein changes to identify those that are relatively highly upregulated  i.e.  displaying a large significant change in phosphorylation and a smaller increase or a decrease in protein abundance. 2.9 Functional Enrichment Analysis Functional enrichment analysis was performed using Benjamini-Hochberg multiple correction testing integrated in to the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery (DAVID) software ( Huang da et al., 2009 ) for Gene Ontology (GO) annotations and for KEGG pathways annotations. Functional enrichment analysis compares coverage of GO and pathway terms from significantly differentially expressed proteins with coverage of these terms in a defined control background – in this case the entire human proteome. This allows pathways, biological processes, molecular functions and proteins of particular cellular components to be identified that are proportionally over represented in the experimental dataset than they are in the background dataset and calculated as fold enrichment. We accepted enriched GO and pathway terms with  p  adjusted < 0.05 and Fold Enrichment > 2. The representative steps involved in target identification are presented in  Fig. S1 . 2.10 Western Blotting Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer consisting of (150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton-X, 0.5% Sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS and 50 mM Tris pH 8.0) before protein concentration was determined using a colorimetric BCA protein assay (Pierce), and immunoblotting proceeded as described previously ( Kaempchen et al., 2003 ). Samples intended for MS measurement were separated using 4–15% gradient pre-cast gels (Bio-rad). The antibodies used in the study included: Merlin (1:1000), pMerlin (1:500), HDAC1 (1:1000) and PDLIM2 (1:500) from Cell Signaling Technology; PDLIM2 (1:500) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and GAPDH (1:50.000) from Millipore. 2.11 Immunofluorescence Microscopy For immunofluorescence, cells were grown O/N on glass slides. The following day slides were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA)/PBS for 10 min. Slides were then washed twice with PBS and cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min at RT. Slides were washed three times with PBS and blocked for 1 h in 10% BSA/PBS at RT. Primary antibodies were diluted in 5% BSA/PBS and incubated O/N at 4 °C. Slides were then washed thrice in PBS for 5 min each and incubated with secondary antibodies (1:200, Alexa Fluor®, Life Technologies), nuclear counterstained (DAPI, 4 μg/ml) and mounted with ProLong Diamond antifade mountant (Life Technologies). Confocal microscopy was performed using a Leica DMI6000B microscope. 2.12 shRNA Mediated Gene Silencing Cultured cells were seeded at 80% confluency before transfection with lentiviral particles (10 μl/6 well, 2 μl labtek) directed towards PDLIM2 (Sigma) in the presence of 5 μg/ml polybrene (Santa Cruz biotechnology). Lentivirus was applied for 24 h, at which point medium was removed and replaced with normal medium for a further 24 h. Puromycin was then applied to cells at a concentration of 5 μg/ml for cell selection. Selection took place over 4–5 days, at which point cells were lysed for Western blot analysis, or fixed and stained for Ki-67 expression. Five different shRNA clones were tested (sequence clone 1: CCGGCTCGGAAGTCTTCAAGATGCTCTCGAGAGCATCTTGAAGACTTCCGAGTTTTTTG; sequence clone 2: CCGGGCTCTTACATGAGCTAAGTTTCTCGAGAAACTTAGCTCATGTAAGAGCTTTTTTG; sequence clone 3: CCGGGAGGACATACACTGAGAGTCACTCGAGTGACTCTCAGTGTATGTCCTCTTTTTTG; sequence clone 4: CCGGCCACTGCCTTTGATCAACCTTCTCGAGAAGGTTGATCAAAGGCAGTGGTTTTTTG; sequence clone 5: CCGGGAGCTGTACTGTGAGAAGCATCTCGAGATGCTTCTCACA GTACAGCTCTTTTTTG), cloned into the plasmid pLKO.1-puro. Clone 5 was the most successful in knocking down PDLIM2. 2.13 λ-Phosphatase Treatment and Cytoplasmic-nuclear Extraction Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors but not phosphatase inhibitors. Protein dephosphorylation was achieved by treating 20 μg of protein lysate with λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs) following the instructions of the supplier. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 30 °C. Non treated sample was incubated in the same buffer and for the same amount of time at 30 °C but water was added in place of λ-phosphatase. To ascertain the cellular location of PDLIM2, a cytoplasmic and nuclear extraction assay (Thermo Scientific) was performed. Primary adherent meningioma cells were harvested with trypsin and centrifuged at 500  g  for 5 min. The cell pellet was then washed once in PBS, transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged for 3 min at 500  g . Ice cold CER I reagent (Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagent, provided with the kit) was added to the pellet, vortexed vigorously for 15 s and incubated on ice for 10 min. Ice cold CER II was then added to the tube and vortexed for 5 s on the highest setting before incubation on ice for 1 min. The tube was then centrifuged for 5 min at 16,000  g  and the supernatant immediately transferred to a pre-chilled tube (the cytoplasmic fraction). Ice cold NER (Nuclear Extraction Reagent, provided with kit) was added to the remaining pellet and vortexed for 15 s. After incubation on ice for 40 min with rigorous vortexing every 10 min, the tube was centrifuged at maximum speed for 10 min. The supernatant (nuclear fraction) was transferred to a clean tube and both extracts were stored at − 80 °C until analysis by Western blot. The experiment was repeated in triplicate on three different meningioma cell populations. Total HDAC1 and GAPDH were included as reference proteins for the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions respectively.",Kayleigh Bassiri; Sara Ferluga; Vikram Sharma; Nelofer Syed; Claire L Adams; Edwin Lasonder; C Oliver Hanemann,EBioMedicine,2017-02,10.1016/j.ebiom.2017.01.020,minimal,True
PMID:39996452,Cas9 Mouse Model of Skull Base Meningioma Driven by Combinational Gene Inactivation in Meningeal Cells.,"INTRODUCTION: Neurofibromatosis type 2 (Nf2) gene inactivation is common in sporadic and Nf2-related meningioma. There is currently scant literature describing the development of an intracranial meningioma model in animals. Given the role of Nf2 and other gene inactivation in meningeal cells, we used Cas9 mice here as the background host to establish a new animal model of skull base meningioma in this study. AIMS: Cas9 transgenic mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory and raised in our institution. Subsequently, meningeal cells were obtained from the Cas9 transgenic mice, cultured in medium, and passaged in vitro. We then prepared lentivirus vector pLentiCre/gRNA, which could express the elements blocking the function of four genes: Nf2, P15 RESULTS: Twenty Cas9 transgenic mice were successfully bred. Five mice were killed so that meningeal cells could be extracted, cultured, and infected with the lentivirus vector pLentiCre/gRNA for 72 h in vitro. The gene function test showed that Nf2, P15 CONCLUSIONS: The Cas9 mouse model of skull base meningioma generated with the Nf2 genetic defect and the combinational loss of P15","2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Preparation of Meningeal Cells From Cas9 Transgenic Mice Twenty mice of Rosa26‐LSL‐Cas9 knockin were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Strain #:024857, USA) and successfully bred in our lab. All of the protocols were approved by the Experimental Animals Ethics Committee of Fudan University (2022JS‐318). Five neonatal mice (postnatal day 2) were killed, meningeal tissues were isolated, and single‐cell primary cultures were obtained via mechanical and enzymatic methods. Primary meningeal cells were passaged for four to five generations. 2.2 Transfection of Meningeal Cells From Cas9 Transgenic Mice The lentiviral vector pLentiCre/gRNA was packaged, and the viral expression strategy was as follows: CMV‐NLS‐Cre‐3FLAG‐polyA‐U6‐gRNA1‐U6‐gRNA2‐U6‐gRNA3‐U6‐gRNA4. From this, four gRNAs were screened and separately directed to the  Nf2, P15

  genes. Arf 
 The titer of the packaged virus was greater than 10 8 /ml. According to a virus: cell ratio of 200:1, the primary meningeal cells were infected, cultured, and passaged. The green fluorescent protein (GDP) signal was observed after 3 days of infection with the pLentiCre/gRNA virus, while no signal was observed in the control group. This indicated that the virus could infect the cells and express Cre, which in turn would activate Cas9 expression. In addition, we found that primary meningeal cells infected with the no‐load virus could no longer be propagated after four passages, while the cells infected with pLentiCre/gRNA exhibited a vigorous growth trend, requiring passaging every 2 days, with no slowing in growth for more than 10 generations. 2.3 Target Gene Expression After Viral Infection in Meningeal Cells After being infected with the pLentiCre/gRNA virus, the meningeal cells were passaged for 10 generations, and some meningeal cells were used for DNA extraction. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing were performed on the site to be edited and revealed that the editing sites set in the meningeal cells for the four target genes ( Nf2, P15

 ) were all mutated. This indicated that our strategy can indeed simultaneously achieve mutations in the four genes in meningeal cells. Arf 
 2.4 Viral Injection Into the Meningeal Site of Neonatal Mice Usually, AAV has a high packaging titer and has a long‐lasting effect in vivo [ 7 ]. Therefore, according to the pLentiCre/gRNA strategy, we constructed an AAV vector of pAAVCre/gRNA, which could import Cre and the four gRNAs. After the above‐mentioned primary meningeal cells were infected with AAV in vivo, the fluorescence expression was observed as well, indicating that the AAV could activate Cas9 expression as the pLentiCre/gRNA virus. The structure of the pAAVCre/gRNA was as follows: ITR‐U6‐sgRNA(Nf2)‐U6‐sgRNA(p16Ink4a)‐U6‐sgRNA(p15Ink4b)‐U6‐sgRNA(p19Arf)‐pEFS‐Rluc‐2A‐Cre‐shortPA‐ITR. The prepared pAAVCre/gRNA was injected into the skull base at the subdural position of 2‐day‐old Cas9 transgenic mice, with each mouse being injected with about 10 8  VG/ml of virus. The mice that survived the injection continued to be observed (one mouse died of viral injection). Two months after injection, five mice were killed, and the expressions of GFP in the injection site at the skull base were observed under microscopy. 2.5 Observation of Meningioma Formation by Brain  MRI  Scan After 10 months' observation, five mice were sent for a brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) scan in order to detect intracranial tumor growth. This study was conducted on a Bruker 7.0 T scanner (Bruker BioSpin GmbH). The specific method is as follows: Inhale 1%–2% isoflurane (IsoFlo, USA) into mice, and after anesthesia, the mice were placed in a magnetic resonance room for scanning. First, we performed rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement echo scans in three directions and then performed conventional spin echo sequence, T1‐weighted, and T2‐weighted scans on the entire brain. The scanning parameters are as follows: relaxation time 4000 milliseconds, echo time 15 milliseconds, field of view 25.6 × 25.6 mm, matrix 256 × 256, slice thickness 0.8 mm, scan time 3 min 20 s. After that, Gd‐DTPA (Magnevist, Germany) magnetic resonance enhancer was injected intraperitoneally into mice; the dose was 0.8 mL/kg for enhanced scanning. 2.6 Histological and Immunohistochemical Analysis After 10 months' observation, finally, nine mice tumor specimens were processed for histological examination via standard hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and also examined for EMA, vimentin, and Ki‐67 (as detected by MIB‐1 antibody) via immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. The primary antibodies were all obtained from Abcam.",Hailiang Tang; Feng Xu; Dan Sun; Lingyang Hua; Ji Xiong; Ming Xu; Jian Xu; Ping Zhong,CNS neuroscience & therapeutics,2025-02,10.1111/cns.70287,minimal,True
PMID:24431436,Neurofibromin is the major ras inactivator in dendritic spines.,"In dendritic spines, Ras plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity but its regulation mechanism is not fully understood. Here, using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer/fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy-based Ras imaging technique in combination with 2-photon glutamate uncaging, we show that neurofibromin, in which loss-of-function mutations cause Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1), contributes to the majority (∼90%) of Ras inactivation in dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus. Loss of neurofibromin causes sustained Ras activation in spines, which leads to impairment of spine structural plasticity and loss of spines in an activity-dependent manner. Therefore, deregulation of postsynaptic Ras signaling may explain, at least in part, learning disabilities associated with NF1.",,Ana F Oliveira; Ryohei Yasuda,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2014-01-15,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3096-13.2014,abstract_only,False
PMID:41168866,Artificial intelligence-based tools for precision diagnosis and treatment of neurofibromatosis type 1 associated peripheral and central glial tumors.,"Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated its effectiveness by achieving human-level performance in various complex tasks, including the biomedical field. Cancer research, adapting to a fast-changing world, is leveraging AI as a promising framework to better understand tumor development. Moreover, current AI methods can help predict more suitable and personalized treatment strategies for specific types of tumors. We explored AI methods applied to Neurofibromatosis Type 1, focusing on glial tumors. Additionally, we have reviewed all publicly available datasets to date. Discussion of future challenges is highly desirable since Neurofibromatosis Type 1 is one of the most common hereditary tumor syndromes and is associated with an increased rate of glial tumors as well as a reduced life expectancy due to malignancy.

PMID:34935315,Analysis of muscle tissue in vivo using fiber-optic autofluorescence and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy.,"SIGNIFICANCE: Current methods for analyzing pathological muscle tissue are time consuming and rarely quantitative, and they involve invasive biopsies. Faster and less invasive diagnosis of muscle disease may be achievable using marker-free in vivo optical sensing methods. AIM: It was speculated that changes in the biochemical composition and structure of muscle associated with pathology could be measured quantitatively using visible wavelength optical spectroscopy techniques enabling automated classification. APPROACH: A fiber-optic autofluorescence (AF) and diffuse reflectance (DR) spectroscopy device was manufactured. The device and data processing techniques based on principal component analysis were validated using in situ measurements on healthy skeletal and cardiac muscle. These methods were then applied to two mouse models of genetic muscle disease: a type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF1) limb-mesenchyme knockout (Nf1Prx1  -  /  -  ) and a muscular dystrophy mouse (mdx). RESULTS: Healthy skeletal and cardiac muscle specimens were separable using AF and DR with receiver operator curve areas (ROC-AUC) of >0.79. AF and DR analyses showed optically separable changes in Nf1Prx1  -  /  -   quadriceps muscle (ROC-AUC >0.97) with no differences detected in the heart (ROC-AUC <0.67), which does not undergo gene deletion in this model. Changes in AF spectra in mdx muscle were seen between the 3 week and 10 week time points (ROC-AUC = 0.96) and were not seen in the wild-type controls (ROC-AUC = 0.58). CONCLUSION: These findings support the utility of in vivo fiber-optic AF and DR spectroscopy for the assessment of muscle tissue. This report highlights that there is considerable scope to develop this marker-free optical technology for preclinical muscle research and for diagnostic assessment of clinical myopathies and dystrophies.","2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Optical System A custom AF/DR system was built using commercially available components. A 200-mW 405-nm laser diode (LD) was used for AF measurements, coupled via a servo-actuated shutter, bandpass filter (FB405-10, Thorlabs), and microscope lens into one of seven multimode optical fibers (  core diameter and 0.39 NA) within a fan-out style bundle (BF72HS01, Thorlabs) terminating distally in a six-around-one configuration [ 200 - μ m Fig. 1(a) ]. The shutter allowed the laser power to ramp-up and stabilize before each measurement, while illumination power, set to 20 mW, was controlled by adjusting the coupling between the fiber and LD. Tissue AF emission was collected using the bundle’s central fiber and long pass filtered at 425 nm (DMLP425, Thorlabs) to remove the illumination wavelength before detection by a USB spectrometer with a wavelength range of 345 to 1041 nm (USB 4000, Ocean Optics). Fig. 1 (a) Schematic of the fiber-optic AF/DR system. 405-nm laser (violet) and halogen lamp (yellow) light sources were coupled into proximal ends of two multimode (MM) optical fibers via servo-mechanical shutters and a bandpass (BP) filter to further narrow the AF excitation wavelength range. Tissue DR and AF light was collected via a central fiber at the probe’s distal end (red) and passed through a 425-nm long-pass (LP) filter before detection at the spectrometer. Additional fibers within the fiber-optic probe (white) were unused. (b) The fiber-optic probe head was positioned directly onto the muscle surface during optical measurements, here showing a DR measurement on the murine gastrocnemius. A stabilized tungsten–halogen light source (SLS201L/M, Thorlabs) was used for DR measurements, coupled via a servo-actuated shutter and microscope lens into a fiber adjacent to the 405-nm LD [ Fig. 1(a) ]. Diffusely reflected light was collected using the same central fiber as for AF measurement and returned to the same spectrometer via the same optical path. The four remaining fibers within the bundle were unused. System control and data collection were performed on a PC laptop using MATLAB (Mathworks) via direct USB connection to the filter wheel and spectrometer. An Arduino was used for transistor–transistor logic and pulse-width modulation signals for control of the LD and shutter servos, respectively. 2.2 Animal Ethics and Husbandry C57BL/6 mice (B6) and   mice (NF1) were bred in-house at the Transgenic Facility at The Children’s Hospital at Westmead. B6 mice were originally sourced from the Animal Resources Centre (ARC, Perth), and the NF1 mice bred from the  N f 1 P r x 1 − / − Prx1-Cre  transgenic mice  and the  42  mice. N f 1 f l o x / f l o x 
 43  were bred on a B6 background. The  N f 1 P r x 1 − / − mdx  mice (B10 mdx ) were sourced from Australian Bioresources (ABR, Moss Vale). As these mice are on a C57BL/10 background, wild-type mice (B10WT) of this strain were also sourced from ABR. These studies were approved by the local Animal Ethics Committee under protocol K319. 2.3 In-Vivo  Measurements Measurements were made across six groups of mice defined by their genetic strain and age: B6 at 10 weeks of age, NF1 at 10 weeks, B10WT at 3 and 10 weeks (B10WT-3 weeks/10 weeks), and B10 mdx  at 3 and 10 weeks (B10 mdx -3 weeks/10 weeks). Each group comprised five mice, from which multiple measurements were taken across different muscle groups and the left and right sides. Mice were euthanized immediately prior to measurement by   asphyxiation. The quadriceps (Quad), tibialis anterior (TA), and gastrocnemius (Gastr) of both hind limbs were exposed using surgical scissors, removing outer connective tissues including the superficial fascia. The distal tip of the optical fiber bundle was positioned in the center of and in direct contact with each muscle [ CO 2 Fig. 1(b) ], and AF/DR measurements, including background measurements without illumination for calibration, were made successively. Measurements were made on each muscle in triplicate, lifting and repositioning the probe on the same muscle for each repetition. Following a sternotomy, the heart was exposed for a further set of measurements on the lateral edge of the left and right ventricles. 2.4 Histology Muscle tissues were harvested from all mice following optical measurement. These tissues were surface coated in Tissue-Tek ®  O.C.T. Compound (Sakura Finetek), frozen in liquid nitrogen supercooled isopentane (2-methyl butane), and stored at  .  − 80 ° C  sections were cut on a Leica CM1950 Clinical Cryostat, captured on Superfrost™ Plus Microscope Slides (Fisher Scientific), and stored at 4°C prior to staining. H&E and Oil Red O staining were performed as previously published. 8 - μ m 18 2.5 Optical Data Preprocessing All data processing and analysis were performed in MATLAB (Mathworks). All spectra were calibrated by subtraction of corresponding background spectra to remove the influence of ambient room light. DR spectra were further calibrated to account for the broadband source spectrum as measured from a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) block, such that  , where  X = ( X R − B ) / W  is the calibrated spectrum,  X  is the measured tissue spectrum,  X R  is the background spectrum taken from the tissue without illumination, and  B  is the PTFE spectrum. PTFE is known to have a flat reflectance spectrum across the visible and near-infrared region and is hence highly suitable as a white reference material. W  Calibrated spectra with 3648-data points corresponding to each detection wavelength of the spectrometer were then smoothed using a moving average filter with a window size of 10 nm. AF and DR spectra were then windowed between 435 to 900 nm and 450 to 900 nm, respectively, to remove artifacts and noise at the spectral extremes. An analysis based on spectral shape rather than original calibrated intensities was speculated to be less affected by probe contact quality and light source intensity fluctuations. Calibrated spectral data were normalized to the wavelength of maximum intensity such that  44 , where  X N = X / max ( X )  is the normalized spectrum. Spectra were then grouped into matrices according to their animal- or muscle-group class labels, enabling the comparison of any combination of genotype, muscle group, and age as required for subsequent analyses. X N 2.6 Optical Feature Extraction Dimensionality reduction of spectral matrices was achieved using principal component analysis (PCA)  similar to other studies 45 46 ,  as detailed in  47 Supplemental Methods 1 . This method removes noise from the dataset and allows the visualization of important spectral regions that account for variance in the original dataset. Manual feature extraction methods, e.g., calculating intensities at specific wavelengths of interest, ratios of intensities at different wavelengths, 32 ,  integrated spectral intensity, 48  or analyzing derivatives, 32  were avoided to prevent significant loss of variance and potential nonorthogonality between features. For each dataset, spectral features known as principal components (PCs) were extracted, with each being a linear combination of the detection wavelengths. Low variance-explaining PCs were discarded to leave the first three PCs onto which each original observation was projected to give a score matrix with three variables per observation. A preliminary investigation indicated that the first three PCs explained a sufficient percentage of total variance ( 49 ) when applied to normalized AF and DR measurements across each muscle type in the B6 mouse group ( > 97 % Supplemental Methods 2 ). Normalization of calibrated spectral data provided improved separation of measurement scores enabling better classification accuracy, as has been demonstrated in other studies. 46 2.7 Classification Model A quadratic discriminant classifier (QDC)  was then used for classification of the PC score matrices. For each classification task, a QDC was trained using fivefold cross validation as described in  50 Supplemental Methods 1 . The area under the curve of the model’s receiver operator curve (ROC-AUC) was used as a general measure of prediction accuracy. 51",Christopher J Davey; Emily R Vasiljevski; Alexandra K O'Donohue; Simon C Fleming; Aaron Schindeler,Journal of biomedical optics,2021-12,10.1117/1.JBO.26.12.125001,minimal,True
PMID:8582272,Neurofibromin-deficient fibroblasts fail to form perineurium in vitro.,"To identify cell type(s) that might contribute to nerve sheath tumors (neurofibromas) in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1, we generated cell cultures containing neurons. Schwann cells and fibroblasts from transgenic mouse embryos in which the type 1 neurofibromatosis gene was disrupted by homologous recombination (Brannan et al. (1994) Genes Development, 8,1019-1029). Normal fascicle formation by perineurial cells failed to occur in the absence of neurofibromin. Fascicles were reduced in number and showed abnormal morphology when normal neurons and Schwann cells were cultured up to 37 days with fibroblasts lacking neurofibromin. Proliferation was increased in a majority of fibroblast cell strains analyzed from embryos lacking neurofibromin. These observations suggest that mutations in the neurofibromatosis type I gene affect fibroblast behavior that might contribute to neurofibroma formation in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1.","MATERIALS AND METHODS Transgenic  Nf1  mice C57BL/6J mice in which one allele of the  NF1  gene has been targeted were generated as described elsewhere ( Brannan et al., 1994 ). In order to obtain  Nf1  (−/−) embryos, male and female  Nf1  (+/−) mice were mated for 12–16 hours, then separated and female mice checked for the presence of a copulatory plug. Pregnant mice were killed to obtain embryos after 12.5 days, with the day the plug was observed being day 0.5. PCR conditions For genotyping, embryo heads were removed, lysed in lysis buffer ( Laird et al., 1991 ) overnight at 55°C and DNA isolated. One μl of head DNA was added to 25 μl of PCR reaction mixture containing 2.5 μl 10× reaction buffer (Perkin-Elmer Cetus), 200 ng of each oligonucleotide primer (NeoTkp, NF31a, NF31b) ( Brannan et al., 1994 ), 0.25 units of  Taq  polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Cetus) and a mixture of dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP each at a final concentration of 0.2 mM. PCR was performed for 40 cycles using the following conditions: 94°C for 1 minute, 55°C for 1 minute, 72°C for 2 minutes. 8 μl of each amplication product was used for electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. A 194 bp band indicated a wild-type allele, a 340 bp band the mutant allele as described previously ( Brannan et al., 1994 ). Tissue preparation from  Nf1  mice and embryonic rats Tissue cultures were obtained from E12.5 mouse embryos and from E15 rat embryos essentially as described ( Bunge et al., 1983 ;  Wood, 1976 ). Pregnant females were anaesthesized, using methoxyflurane (Metofane ™ , Pitman-More), a hysterectomy performed and embryos dissected out of amniotic sacs. Embryos were decapitated in Leibovitz’s L15 medium (Gibco). The spinal cord with dorsal root ganglia (DRG) attached was removed and DRG enzymatically dissociated in 0.25% trypsin in Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution (Gibco) at 37°C on an orbital shaker at 40 revs/minute for 40 minutes. Ganglia were transferred to approximately 10 ml of Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco) and centrifuged at 800 revs/minute for 5 minutes. The pellet was resuspended in approximately 0.5 ml of ‘C medium’ (DMEM containing 10% human placental serum [provided by the delivery room of a local hospital] and 50 ng/ml nerve growth factor [2.5S NGF, Harlan Bio-products]) and mechanically dissociated using a narrowed bore Pasteur pipette. This cell suspension (containing neurons, Schwann cell precursors and fibroblasts) was plated in single drops onto collagen-coated glass coverslips in 24-well plates, or on 35 mm dishes (Falcon), coated with ammoniated rat tail collagen. 5–6 individual drops of cell suspension were separately placed onto the hydrophobic collagen substratum so that drops did not flow together. Cells were allowed to attach overnight at 35°C and 7.5% CO 2 . The following day dishes/wells were flooded with ‘C’ medium. Medium was replaced at least twice per week. Purified neuronal cultures In order to obtain purified neuronal cell populations, rat cultures were treated with the antimitotics 5′-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine and uridine (Sigma) added to ‘C’ medium at 10 −5  M final concentration (‘CF’ medium) ( Bunge et al., 1983 ). Cultures were cycled through two-three passages of C/CF; each medium was replaced after 3 days. Preparation of rat primary Schwann cells Primary Schwann cells were purified from sciatic nerve from postnatal day 1 rats as described previously ( Brockes et al., 1979 ). Following isolation of Schwann cells by antimitotic treatment and complement-mediated lysis of residual fibroblasts, cells were maintained in DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum until plating onto neurons. In some experiments, Schwann cells were amplified for 1 week in recombinant human glial growth factor (rhGGF2, Cambridge Neuroscience) and 2 μM forskolin prior to addition to neurons. Preparation of  Nf1  mouse fibroblasts Fibroblasts from E12.5 mouse embryos were obtained when embryos were dissected for DRG preparation. After removal of internal organs, head and spinal cord, remaining tissue of each embryo was transferred to a tube containing 2 ml of ice-cold 0.05% trypsin in 0.6 mM EDTA in Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution and incubated overnight at 4°C. The following day, tubes were incubated for 20 minutes at 37°C, approximately 10 ml of DMEM containing 10% FBS added and the cell suspension centrifuged for 5 minutes at 800 revs/minute. Cells were resuspended in 1 ml DMEM with 10% FBS then mechanically dissociated with a narrowed bore Pasteur pipette. The whole cell suspension was plated onto one 100 mm tissue culture plastic dish containing 10–15 ml of DMEM, 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin and maintained at 35°C and 7.5% CO 2  for several days until the cells were nearly confluent. Fibroblasts were used immediately or at up to 3 passages for experiments. Preparation of neuron, Schwann cell and fibroblast co-cultures 2-week-old purified rat neuronal cultures on a collagen-coated 35 mm dish were seeded with 0.3–0.5×10 6  rat Schwann cells in ‘C medium’ and kept at 35°C and 7.5% CO 2  overnight. After 24 hours, cultures were switched to a defined ‘N2’-medium ( Bottenstein and Sato, 1979 ) which stimulates Schwann cell proliferation but not myelination ( Moya et al., 1980 ) and maintained at 37°C and 10% CO 2 . After 3–7 days, Schwann cells were distributed evenly over the whole neurite outgrowth. At this time, medium was shifted to ‘C’ supplemented with 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma) to enhance Schwann cell differentiation ( Eldridge et al., 1987 ). At the same time 0.3–0.5×10 6   Nf1  mouse fibroblasts per dish were added; cultures were maintained at 35°C and 7.5% CO 2 . Preparation of semithin sections Cultures were fixed for 30 minutes at room temperature in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer pH 7.4 containing 2% paraformaldehyde, 1.25% glutaraldehyde and 100 mM sucrose. After 3 washes for 5 minutes each with 0.2 M cacodylate buffer, cultures were postfixed for 60 minutes at room temperature with 0.1 M cacodylate buffer containing 1% OsO 4  and 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide, washed again and kept overnight at 4°C in 0.2 M cacodylate buffer. Cultures were dehydrated through 30%, 50% and 70% ethanol (5 minutes each), stained en bloc for 30 minutes in 0.5% uranylacetate in 75% ethanol, further dehydrated in 85%, 95% and 100% ethanol, and embedded in Epon. Culture analysis For EM analysis, ultrathin sections were stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate and photographed on a JOEL-10 CX electron microscope at 1000–50,000 magnification. Organotypic cultures derived from 4 wild-type, 14  Nf1  (+/−) and 7  Nf1  (−/−) embryos were evaluated; 1–2 areas/culture were analyzed. For experiments in which fibroblasts of different genotype were added to normal neurons and Schwann cells for quantitative analysis, 3–8 different areas of each culture were evaluated. Cultures from a total of 4 different embryos were analyzed for each genotype. For all cultures, each block was selected 2 mm outside areas containing neuronal cell bodies, areas that are maximally differentiated ( Obremski et al., 1993a ). Semithin plastic sections were analyzed at 400× magnification for fascicle number. A fascicle was defined as a group of axons and Schwann cells encircled for at least 75% of its circumference by one or more elongated fibroblasts.",T Rosenbaum; Y L Boissy; K Kombrinck; C I Brannan; N A Jenkins; N G Copeland; N Ratner,"Development (Cambridge, England)",1995-11,10.1242/dev.121.11.3583,minimal,True
PMID:25329635,Genetic modifiers of neurofibromatosis type 1-associated café-au-lait macule count identified using multi-platform analysis.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant, monogenic disorder of dysregulated neurocutaneous tissue growth. Pleiotropy, variable expressivity and few NF1 genotype-phenotype correlates limit clinical prognostication in NF1. Phenotype complexity in NF1 is hypothesized to derive in part from genetic modifiers unlinked to the NF1 locus. In this study, we hypothesized that normal variation in germline gene expression confers risk for certain phenotypes in NF1. In a set of 79 individuals with NF1, we examined the association between gene expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines with NF1-associated phenotypes and sequenced select genes with significant phenotype/expression correlations. In a discovery cohort of 89 self-reported European-Americans with NF1 we examined the association between germline sequence variants of these genes with café-au-lait macule (CALM) count, a tractable, tumor-like phenotype in NF1. Two correlated, common SNPs (rs4660761 and rs7161) between DPH2 and ATP6V0B were significantly associated with the CALM count. Analysis with tiled regression also identified SNP rs4660761 as significantly associated with CALM count. SNP rs1800934 and 12 rare variants in the mismatch repair gene MSH6 were also associated with CALM count. Both SNPs rs7161 and rs4660761 (DPH2 and ATP6V0B) were highly significant in a mega-analysis in a combined cohort of 180 self-reported European-Americans; SNP rs1800934 (MSH6) was near-significant in a meta-analysis assuming dominant effect of the minor allele. SNP rs4660761 is predicted to regulate ATP6V0B, a gene associated with melanosome biology. Individuals with homozygous mutations in MSH6 can develop an NF1-like phenotype, including multiple CALMs. Through a multi-platform approach, we identified variants that influence NF1 CALM count.","Materials and Methods Patient recruitment The DISC and REP1 cohorts were comprised of adults meeting the consensus criteria for the diagnosis of NF1  [63] ,  [64]  who were willing to travel to the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland and who had both living biological parents willing to donate a blood sample. The parents did not need to be affected with NF1. Exclusion criteria for probands included: 1) any past or present history of radiation therapy, chemotherapy or biologic agents that might be expected to alter the natural history of neurofibroma growth, 2) any history of surgery to remove multiple neurofibromas or spinal neurofibromas, 3) cognitive delay that would preclude sedation to obtain an MRI, 4) presence or suspected presence of surgical hardware ( e.g. , Harrington rods) or metallic objects that would preclude MRI imaging and 5) inability or unwillingness to tolerate an extended (one hour or more) MRI protocol. Study participants were recruited via a variety of means ( e.g. , Google advertising, letters to NF1 clinics) from throughout the United States. Travel and lodging costs were covered by the protocol. Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from the first 79 participants (“EXPR”) were used in the gene expression screen to identify putative modifiers. For tests of association of variants in putative modifiers identified in the EXPR screen, 99 participants were used as a discovery cohort (DISC) where 70 samples of the EXPR cohort were included in the DISC sample. An additional independent 33 and 81 participants were used as validation cohorts (REP1 and REP2, respectively). This study was approved by the National Human Genome Research Institute and National Cancer Institute institutional review boards and all participants provided written, informed consent. NF1 quantitative phenotyping and biospecimen collection: DISC and REP1 cohorts We sought to quantify the NF1 phenotype in a comprehensive two-day visit to the NIH Clinical Center. A single observer (DRS) performed a history and physical exam (with measurements), Wood's lamp exam, slit-lamp exam, and collected photographs of the skin. NF1-specific abnormalities were noted ( e.g. , presence/absence of intertriginous freckling, bony abnormalities, dysmorphic features) and a clinical assessment of the probability of mosaic NF1 was made. Whole-body cutaneous neurofibroma burden (lesions projecting above the skin) was estimated within a set of ranges (0, 1–10, 11–50, 51–100, 101–500, 500+). In addition, a paper frame with a 100 cm 2  cut-out at the center was placed on the mid-back, abdomen and left thigh of each participant and a photograph was taken. Within the 100 cm 2 , all protruding cutaneous neurofibromas greater than 2 mm were counted, marked with water-soluble ink and re-photographed. The number of cherry hemangiomas, an under-recognized feature associated with NF1  [65] ,  [66] , was also counted within each frame at the three different sites. The number, size and distribution of CALM and other dermatologic abnormalities were counted, measured and mapped with a Wood's lamp and ruler in a darkened room. The CALM count was defined as the total number of café-au-late spots greater than 5 mm in any dimension. A slit-lamp exam was used to enumerate and photograph Lisch nodules in the eye, as previously described  [58] . From the physical exam we measured height, weight and head circumference. Growth charts specific for the NF1 population (recruited at an Italian center) were used to determine centile rankings of height and weight  [67] . Centile charts for adult head circumference (adjusting for gender and height) were also used for NF1-affected individuals  [68] . We obtained demographic and self-reported ethnicity data, a pedigree and associated data (parity, presence of consanguinity, age of parents at birth), subject and parental heights, an MRI of the spine and clinical photographs, and referred participants to the dental clinic at the NIH Clinical Center for a cephalogram, panograph, and intra-oral photography. All participants received genetic counseling. Blood samples for DNA extraction, RNA extraction (PaxGene tubes) and for LCL production were drawn on morning of the second day of the evaluation. Patient recruitment and phenotyping: REP2 cohort Patients with NF1 were enrolled in the “Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Natural History Study” ( NCT00924196 ), approved by the NCI Institutional Review Board. Patients or their guardians were provided written informed consent. Eligibility criteria included a clinical diagnosis of NF1 or presence of an  NF1  germline mutation. A detailed skin evaluation at the time of enrollment by a single observer (AMB) was used. The number, size and distribution of CALM >5 mm in any dimension were recorded. They were measured with a ruler and documented on a standard form utilized on the natural history study. Establishment and culture of LCLs for EXPR screen All LCLs were established from peripheral white blood cells at the Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown University, using standard procedures. Cells were stored in liquid nitrogen until needed for an experiment. To minimize batch effects, 79 cell lines were thawed on the same day and seeded at initial density of 500,000 cells per mL in 12-well plates. The cultures were maintained in an incubator at 37°C with 5% CO 2  in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 Units/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin and 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. The cells were fed every other day and harvested on the same day after 10 days of culturing. The cell densities in the fastest and slowest growing cultures were 1.9 and 1.1 million cells/mL on the day of harvesting, respectively. The majority of LCLs exhibited similar growth rates and were at density of 1.3 to 1.7 million cells/mL at the time of harvesting. For harvesting, the cells were transferred into 15 mL tubes, spun at 400 g for 5 min at room temperature, washed once with PBS (no Ca ++  or Mg ++ ), spun again, and the pellets were lysed in 1 mL of Trizol reagent. The lysates were stored at −80°C prior to RNA extraction. All reagents were from Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY, USA). RNA extraction and Illumina microarray expression profiling For RNA isolation, Trizol cell lysates were mixed with chloroform (1/5 of lysate volume), vortexed for one minute and centrifuged in a table-top centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C. The aqueous phase containing RNA was mixed with an equal volume of 70% ethanol and immediately loaded onto RNeasy mini columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), with subsequent steps performed as per the manufacturer's protocol. The RNA quality was estimated on a 2100 Bioanalyzer, RNA 6000 Nano Chips (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Samples with RNA integrity number (RIN) of 8.0 and above were used for further analysis. For microarray analysis of RNA, all reagents, consumables, lab-ware, instruments, and software were obtained from Illumina, Inc (San Diego, CA, USA) unless otherwise indicated. RNA amplification/labeling, microarray hybridization, and microarray washing/staining and scanning procedures were done according to the Illumina protocols without modifications. Amplified biotinylated cRNA (1.5 µg) was hybridized to HumanRef-8_v2 Sentrix BeadChips. Samples were hybridized to microarrays at 55°C for 16–17 hours. Microarrays were washed to remove non-specifically bound cRNA, stained with 1 mg/mL Streptavidin-Cy3 (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA), dried, and scanned in an Illumina BeadStation 500 scanner. Image acquisition and initial image analysis were done with Illumina BeadScan and BeadStudio applications. Raw expression data were quintile normalized, background subtracted, floored to remove negative values and transformed by calculating logarithm, base 2, for each value (for better approximation to a normal distribution). Regression analysis and data filtering Simple linear regression analyses between specific NF1 quantitative phenotypes (height, head circumference, total number of CALM count, cutaneous neurofibroma burden, Lisch nodule count and cherry hemangioma count) and expression values obtained for each individual in the EXPR set ( Table 1 ) were performed for each of the 22,177 transcripts on the microarray. The FDR calculation procedure was applied to correct for multiple testing  [69] . All phenotype-transcript regression pairs with an FDR below 0.3 were considered significant. The output was further filtered by subtracting phenotype-transcript pairs with expression level of transcripts below 6 (mean log 2 ), expression range (difference between maximum and minimum expression) below 2 and considering biological significance of the candidate genes. In some cases, genes with an expression level below 6 and an expression range below 2 were still considered for validation because of their biological importance. Quantitative PCR verification of significant transcripts Filtered transcripts with putative phenotype/expression correlates ( Table S1 : “Set of 80”) were investigated for outliers by generating scatter plots of quantitative phenotype  vs.  transcript expression values. Twenty-one select transcripts ( Table S1 : “Set of 21”) plus an endogenous control ( GAPDH ) were interrogated by qPCR in all 79 samples that were analyzed on microarrays on 384-well microfluidic cards (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The microfluidic cards were processed and analyzed per the manufacturer's instructions without modifications. Relative expression of each gene was calculated using the standard “double delta Ct” method, per the manufacturer's protocol. Simple linear regression analysis of the qPCR expression values and corresponding quantitative phenotypes was performed as described above. For a given transcript, correlation of qPCR expression with phenotype with a nominal  p  value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Candidate gene sequencing in the discovery (DISC) sample set Coding and limited evolutionarily conserved non-coding sequences of  MSH6 ,  MSH2 ,  MLH1 ,  MED21  and  DPH2  were sequenced from germline DNA using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (Sanger). The genes  MSH6  and  MED21  were sequenced because of prior validation by qPCR. We included  MSH2  and  MLH1  because the protein products of these genes are known to associate with  MSH6  in functional MMR complexes. Despite not being verified by qPCR,  DPH2  was included because of its biological significance. The concentration of genomic DNA (gDNA) used in sequencing was determined using a DyNA Quant 200 fluorometer (Hoefer, Holliston, MA USA) and dsDNA-specific Hoechst Dye 22358 according to the manufacturer's protocol. The gDNA sample was then tested for functionality in PCR reactions with positive and negative control primers: Pos_For:  TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTATCCCACTGTTAGGAGAACTGC 
 Pos_Rev:  CAGGAAACAGCTATGACCGGTCAGGAAAGGGACACAGATA 
 Negative control primers are the forward and reverse sequencing primers to lac-Z of M13: M13_For:  TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT 
 M13_Rev:  CAGGAAACAGCTATGACC 
 To each gDNA sample, a trace amount of a plasmid with a unique non-human insert was added to serve as a biological barcode; the identifying inserts were amplified and checked using the universal sequencing primers above. The gDNAs were diluted to a working concentration of 2.5 ng/µL. To amplify gDNA, primers were obtained from Eurofins MWG Operon (Huntsville, AL, USA) in individual tubes and reconstituted to 100 µM in 10 mM TRIS, pH 8.0, 0.1 mM EDTA. The primers pairs were tested at a concentration of 0.16 µM each in 10 µL PCR reactions containing KAPA 2G Fast HS ReadyMix PCR Kit (KAPA Biosystems, Woburn, MA, USA) and 5 ng of control human DNA (Coriell Institute, Camden, NJ, USA). Cycling conditions: 1) activate enzyme at 95°C for 3 min, 2) 40 cycles at 95°C for 10 sec, 60°C for 10 sec and then 72°C for 30 sec and, 3) hold at 10°C. A 5 µL aliquot of the PCR reaction was examined by agarose gel to assess multiple or missing bands. The PCR products were then diluted to 0.4 ng/µL and sequenced in 6 µL reactions using M13 universal forward and reverse primers and BDT version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems) using standard ABI protocols. The reactions were then analyzed on 3730 DNA Sequencers (Applied Biosystems). The sequence traces were individually inspected for quality. Primer pairs that did not lead to high-quality traces were retested using one additional control DNA. Primers failing both rounds were redesigned. PCR amplification of amplimers was performed in 10 µL reactions in 384-well plates, as described above. Prior to sequencing, the PCR products were diluted to 0.4 ng/µL. Sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystem 3730 Sequencer using BigDye Terminator version 3.1. Three µL of diluted PCR products were used in sequencing reaction volumes of 6 µL. Sequencing primer sequences are as above. Reaction cleanup was accomplished through alcohol precipitation. Reaction precipitates are dissolved in 10 µL water immediately before sequencing. All genomic coordinates reference the hg18 (March 2006) build. Candidate SNP genotyping in the REP1 sample set 1) PCR and sequencing For genotyping  MSH6  SNP rs1800934 in an independent set of germline DNA from 33 samples, a 632 bp amplimer was generated from gDNA using:  5′-GTAGTCCGCCCACCTAAGC  (forward) and  5′-CCCTAGCTCTCTACTTCTTACCAAAA  (reverse). The primers were appended with universal sequences at their 5′-ends:  5′-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT  (forward),  5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGACC  (reverse). PCR and sequencing was performed as described above. 2) Illumina Human OmniQuad-1M SNP-arrays For genotyping  DPH2  SNPs rs4660761 and rs7161, we used genotyping calls obtained from Illumina Human OmniQuad-1M SNP-arrays. SNP-array analysis was done according to the manufacturer's protocol using GenomeStudio (v. 2010.2) software (Illumina). Candidate SNP genotyping in the REP2 sample set A targeted, multiplex PCR primer panel was designed using the custom Ion Ampliseq Designer v3.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The primer panel covered 11 kb of sequence that includes the specific variants of interest in the  MSH6  and  DPH2  loci. Each site was 100% covered in the design. Average amplicon size was 225 bp. Sample DNA was amplified using this custom Ampliseq primer pool, and libraries were prepared following the manufacturer's Ion Ampliseq Library Preparation protocol (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Individual samples were barcoded, pooled, templated, and sequenced on the Ion Torrent PGM Sequencer using the Ion PGM Template OT2 200 and Ion PGM Sequencing 200v2 kits per manufacturer's instructions. Mean read length after sequencing was 159 bp. Statistical analysis of SNPs putatively associated with café-au-lait macule count in the DISC sample set Data preparation The CALM count trait was used both as the untransformed (unt) and as the log-transformed trait (log) by log 10 (x+10). Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) from the five selected candidate genes ( MSH6 ,  MSH2 ,  MLH1 ,  MED21  and  DPH2 ) were filtered based on the with the following: 1) if the polyphred score for an SNV was less than 99, the genotype was deemed “missing”; 2) if a sample had greater than 30% of its SNVs “missing” then the sample was excluded; 3) if an SNV had a greater than 20% “missing” rate in all of the samples, the SNV was excluded; and 4) all monomorphic SNVs were excluded. In those cases in which family data were available, SNVs were checked for Mendelian segregation with PedCheck  [70] . Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) proportions were tested with PEDSTATS  [71]  on 70 unrelated individuals. Two SNVs not in HWE ( P  value<0.03) were flagged but retained for analysis since removing SNVs not in HWE in highly-ascertained samples may remove causative SNVs. Self-reported European-American samples were included for further analyses. After filtering, there were a total of 91 individuals with 118 SNVs. Simple linear regression and tiled regression Simple linear regression was performed on each SNV after adjusting for age and sex. “Tiled Regression” as implemented in TRAP (Tiled Regression Analysis Package)  [72]  was used to identify the set of independent significant variants considering all the SNVs in the sample that affected the number of CALM after pre-adjusting for age and sex. Both simple linear regression and tiled regression were performed under two models, additive and dominant for both the untransformed and log-transformed traits. Briefly, in tiled regression, the genome is divided into independent segments based on predefined regions called tiles. In this study, tiles were defined by hotspot-based regions, delimited by the location of recombination hotspots in Human Genome Sequence build 36, yielding 5 independent tiles. Each tile was first analyzed with multiple linear regression of the trait on all SNVs in the tile and by simple linear regression of the trait on each SNV separately. Only those tiles for which the overall multiple linear regression showed a significant relationship to trait variation at the level of 0.2, or in which simple linear regression on any single SNV was significant at the level of 0.05, were retained for subsequent analyses. A forward stepwise regression with backward look then was performed within each tile to select the important individual independent SNVs identified with a critical level of 0.05 for entry and for retention in the model. Thereafter, the SNVs retained from each tile were combined across tiles for higher order stepwise regressions at chromosome and then whole genome levels using the same critical values. The end result was a multiple linear regression model that included the set of variants independently contributing to trait variation. Variant coding Genotypes for 118 SVs, including both 58 common and 60 rare variants (defined by minor allele frequency <0.05), were used as provided (un-collapsed), and with the rare variants (RVs) collapsed. Several coding schemes were considered: 1) the number of minor alleles (add) for each common variant (CV) and for each un-collapsed RV, 2) the presence or absence of the minor allele (dom) for each SNV and for each un-collapsed RV, 3) the number of minor alleles (add) for each CV and, with a new collapsed variant that was coded as proportion of a minor allele at any RV; in other words, collapsing multiple RVs into a single region-wide variant within hotspot-based region definition. Validation of SNVs significant in the DISC sample set associated with café-au-lait macule count in independent sets REP1 and REP2 To confirm the association of SNVs in the DISC sample set with CALM count, we genotyped the variants in germline DNA in an independent set of 33 samples (REP1) and an additional independent set of 81 samples (REP2). Since none of the significant SNVs in the DISC set were significantly associated with CALM count by simple linear regression at the level of 0.05 based on 29 and 62 European-American samples in REP1 and REP2, respectively ( Table 2 ), we performed additional analyses. In the meta-analysis, p-values of these three (DISC, REP1, REP2) datasets were combined using Liptak's method  [73]  by weighting each p-value by its square root of the sample size ( Table 2 ). In the mega-analysis, three (DISC, REP1, REP2) datasets including 180 samples were combined and simple linear regression was performed on each SNV by adjusting for age, sex and each dataset ( Table 2 ). Tiled regression was not performed in the replication study since the method requires genotyping all variants, not just markers of interest. We did not attempt to validate rare variants due to limited size of the additional set. Bioinformatic exploration of  DPH2  and  ATPV0B  SNP function To explore whether SNPs rs4660761 and rs7161 might have potential regulatory functions in skin cells (including melanocytes), we used custom tracks on the UCSC Genome browser ( http://genome.ucsc.edu ) to screen Roadmap and ENCODE data containing the implicated SNP regions for evidence for regulatory relevance  [74] – [76] , such as overlapping with chromatin marks and interactions, CpG-site methylation and transcription factor binding motifs. We also used the online tools HaploReg ( http://www.broadinstitute.org/mammals/haploreg/haploreg.php ) and RegulomeDB ( http://regulome.stanford.edu ) as a complementary analysis and to confirm the location of each SNP in relation to annotated protein-coding genes and/or non-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes.

PMID:33442015,Cabozantinib for neurofibromatosis type 1-related plexiform neurofibromas: a phase 2 trial.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) are progressive, multicellular neoplasms that cause morbidity and may transform to sarcoma. Treatment of Nf1","Online Methods METHODS Clinical Trial Study Population Inclusion criteria included patients aged 16 years or older with a diagnosis of NF1 and an unresectable PN that was measurable by volumetric analysis  and either progressive (defined as ≥20% increase in the volume, ≥13% increase in the product of the two longest perpendicular diameters, or ≥6% increase in the longest diameter in the prior year) or causing significant morbidity, such as (but not limited to) head and neck lesions compromising the airway or great vessels, brachial or lumbar plexus lesions causing nerve compression and loss of function, lesions causing major deformity or significant disfigurement, lesions of the extremity causing limb hypertrophy or loss of function, and painful lesions. Histologic confirmation of tumor was not necessary in the presence of consistent clinical and imaging findings. Previous treatment for a PN was allowed but participants must have recovered from the acute toxic effects of all therapy. Other eligibility criteria included (a) adequate performance status (Karnofsky score ≥ 50); (b) normal hematologic, hepatic, renal, and cardiovascular function; and (c) signed informed consent from the patient (≥18 years of age) or their legal guardians (<18 years of age), according to institutional review board guidelines. 35 Participants were excluded if they (a) had an active optic glioma or other low-grade glioma requiring treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy; (b) required treatment for a malignancy in the prior 12 months; (c) had dental braces or prosthesis that interfere with volumetric analysis; (d) were unable to swallow tablets; (e) were post-pubertal males/females who would not agree to use effective contraception, or were pregnant/breast-feeding females; (f) had a known history of HIV or immunodeficiency; (g) had impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that significantly alters the absorption of cabozantinib; (h) had concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease; (i) required therapeutic treatment with anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents with the exception of low dose aspirin, low-dose warfarin, and prophylactic low molecular weight heparin; or (j) had undergone major surgery within 3 months or minor surgery within one month of first dose of cabozantinib. In participants who had received therapy prior to study enrollment, 2 weeks – 6 months must have elapsed, depending on the specific prior therapy. The use of strong CYP3A4 inducers/inhibitors was not allowed while on study. A complete list of the inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in  Supplementary Table 2 . Ethics oversight was provided by both the local IRB’s (Children’s Hospital Boston/Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Massachusetts General Hospital, Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Children’s National Medical Center, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, Indiana University, Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago, National Cancer Institute, New York University, University of Alabama at Birmingham, University of Chicago, University of Utah, The Washington University in St. Louis) and the U.S. Army Medical Research and Material Command (USAMRMC) Human Research Protections Office (HRPO). Each participating center’s local IRB reviewed and approved the study. Once local approval was obtained, this was submitted to the USAMRMC HRPO for review and approval. No study related activities could commence without approval of both the local IRB and the USAMRMC HRPO. In addition, the study was also approved by the FDA. Study Design This prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized phase 2 trial was performed by the NF Clinical Trials Consortium. The primary measure of efficacy was volumetric response of the target PN determined by central review of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as per the recommendations from REiNS (Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis), an international effort to develop standardized outcome measures for clinical trials . Secondary endpoints included safety and tolerability, patient-reported outcomes (PRO) assessing tumor pain intensity (Numeric Rating Scale-11; NRS-11), pain interference in daily life (Brief Pain Inventory-Pain Interference Scale; BPI-PI), and disease-specific quality of life (PedsQL NF1 module), PK, and circulating endothelial cells and cytokines. Additional planned secondary outcomes not reported in this manuscript included estimating the overall response rate for non-target PN (there were 5 non-target PN identified in a total of 4 participants), a determination of whether patients who respond to cabozantinib maintained that response for one year off therapy (not reported because the protocol did not require that off-treatment MRI scans be performed, so that information was unavailable), assessing the activity of cabozantinib on mast cell activity by mast cell culture and FACS (not performed as samples were limited and other aims were prioritized), and assessing the PedsQL NF1 QOL Module, a disease specific QOL scale, for use in this patient population (a planned future analysis will combine this data with data from other PN trials using the PedsQL NF1 QOL Module). Cabozantinib was given daily on a continuous dosing schedule for up to 24 cycles. Each treatment cycle was 28 days. The starting cabozantinib dose was 40 mg daily with planned dose escalation to 60 mg daily after 2 cycles if tolerated ( 35 Figure 3a ). For participants who experienced dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), up to two dose reductions were allowed (40 mg and 20 mg). Participants were removed from therapy if they experienced a cabozantinib-related toxicity requiring removal, for progressive disease, or if they had not achieved a partial response (PR; defined as a ≥20% reduction in tumor volume compared with pre-treatment baseline) by the end of 12 cycle. In addition, participants who had not achieved at least 15% reduction in tumor volume at cycle 8 were removed from study for safety reasons, as it was believed that the likelihood of achieving PR by 12 months was minimal. Participants were considered evaluable for toxicity if they received at least one dose of the study drug and evaluable for response if they completed at least two cycles of therapy and had their first follow-up MRI evaluation. Baseline MRI was required within 4 weeks prior to study entry. Tumor response by MRI was determined after cycle 4, 8, and 12, and then after cycle 18 and 24 for those who continued therapy. Axial and coronal STIR images were obtained to cover the entire PN with 5–10 mm slice thickness. Imaging response was evaluated centrally at the Pediatric Oncology Branch of the National Cancer Institute using volumetric MRI analysis . Disease progression was defined as a ≥20% increase, and partial response as ≥20% reduction in the volume of the target PN, confirmed by a follow-up MRI. Safety evaluations including laboratory monitoring, electrocardiograms, physical exams, and vital signs were performed at regular intervals as outlined in  53 Supplementary Table 3 . Adverse events were graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. Participants were considered evaluable for toxicity if they received at least 1 dose of the study drug. Success was defined as ≥25% of participants achieving PR after 12 cycles without significant toxicity. Patient Reported Outcome Measures All participants completed the following patient-reported outcomes (PROs) prior to study entry, at cycle 4, 8, and 12, and then after cycle 18 and 24 if they continued therapy. Pain Intensity and Pain Interference Measures Numerical Rating Scale-11 (NRS-11): The  NRS-11  is a self-report 11-point numeric scale that assesses pain intensity . It consists of a horizontal line with 0 representing “no pain” at the left end of the line and 10 representing “worst pain you can imagine” at the right end. Participants were asked to circle the one number from 0 to 10 that best described their “most important tumor pain” at its worst during the past week. 54 Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)-Pain Interference (PI) Scale: The  BPI-PI Scale  is a 7-item self-report questionnaire that measures the extent to which pain interferes with daily functioning . Participants were asked to indicate how much pain interfered with various activities (general activity, mood, walking, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life) in the past week, with scores ranging from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes). The total score is the mean of all 7 items. 55 NF1 Disease-Specific Quality of Life Measures PedsQL™ NF1 Module: This scale is a self-report measure assessing NF1 disease-specific QOL . Participants who were ages 21 years and older completed the 74-item self-report adult questionnaire. It is comprised of 16 scales (physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning, cognitive functioning, communication, worry, perceived physical appearance, pain and hurt, paresthesias, skin irritation, sensation, movement and balance, fatigue, daily activities, treatment anxiety, and sexual functioning). Participants 16–20 years of age completed the self-report  37 teen version . It is comprised of 16 scales (physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning, cognitive functioning, communication, worry, perceived physical appearance, pain and hurt, paresthesias, skin irritation, sensation, movement and balance, fatigue, daily activities, treatment anxiety, and school activities). Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale (0 – 4) and transformed to a 0 – 100 scale, with higher domain and total mean raw scores indicating better QOL. Pharmacokinetic Analysis Blood samples were collected at 6 time-points for cabozantinib plasma concentration measurement: Cycle 1 Day 1 (pre, 4 hours after first dose), Cycle 1 Day 15 (pre, 4 hours after dose), and Cycle 1 Day 28 (pre, 4 hours after dose) and were shipped to Alturas Analytics (Moscow, ID) for analysis. Cabozantinib concentrations in human plasma matrix were quantified using a validated liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometry assay with 0.5 ng/mL as the lower limit of quantification. Cytokine Analysis Plasma samples were received from all 19 participants who were evaluable for response, but only 14 had multiple usable time points. Samples were stored at −80°C in the Translational Research Integrated Biology Laboratory (TRIB) in Riley Hospital for Children until collection and analysis of all samples. Samples were thawed, centrifuged to remove particulates (16,300 g for 10 min) and analyzed for 44 biomarkers by Luminex xMAP technology. Targets were detected using premixed kits from MilliporeSigma. The biomarkers measured included SCF (using a 1-Plex human Cytokine/Chemokine Magnetic Bead Panel); TGF-B1, TGFB2, TGFB3 (using a TGFβ−3 Plex Magnetic bead panel); sCD40L, EGF, Eotaxin/CCL11, FGF-2, Flt-3 ligand, Fractalkine, G-CSF, GM-CSF, GRO, IFN-α2, IFN-γ, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-1RA, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12 (p40), IL-12 (p70), IL-13, IL-15, IL-17A, IP-10, MCP-1, MCP-3, MDC (CCL22), MIP-1α, MIP-1β,TGF-α, TNF-α, TNF-β (using a Human Cytokine/Chemokine 37-Plex Magnetic Bead Panel), and VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGF-D (using a Human Angiogenesis/Growth Factor 3-Plex Magnetic Bead Panel). Samples were diluted according to manufacturer’s recommendations, assayed in duplicate using a Bio-Plex 200 System with high-throughput fluidics (HTF) multiplex array system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, California, US), and analyzed using Bio-Plex Manager software (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Biomarker assays were run by the Multiplex Analysis Core at the Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center, Indiana University. Levels of circulating sAXL were measured in human plasma using the Human AXL DuoSet ELISA kit (R&D Systems, DY154) and accompanying DuoSet ELISA Ancillary Reagent Kit 2 (R&D Systems, DY008) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Human plasma samples were assayed in duplicate at dilution of 1:200 in Reagent Diluent. Optical density of each well was measured using a VERSAmax Tunable Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices) with SOFmax PRO software. Optical density readings at 540 nm were subtracted from the readings at 450 nm for wavelength correction. Investigators were blind to patients’ clinical response during data collection and analysis. Circulating Progenitor Cell Analysis The flow cytometry assay was performed in real time within 24 hours of peripheral blood collection. Peripheral blood collected off-site was shipped overnight. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and incubated with Fc blocking reagent and stained as previously described . Briefly, following Fc block, mononuclear cells were stained with anti-human CD31 (FITC, BD), anti-human CD34 (PE, BD), anti-human AC133 (APC, Miltenyi Biotec), anti-human CD14 (PECy5.5, Abcam), anti-human CD45 (APC-AG740, Invitrogen), and the fixable amine reactive viability dye LiveDead (violet, Invitrogen). Fluorescent minus one (FMO) gating was used to properly delineate positive events. Circulating hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (CHSPCs) have the phenotype: CD31 56 + CD34 bright CD45 dim CD14 − LIVEDEAD − . The proangiogenic fraction of the CHSPCs additionally stain positive for Ac133 +  and have the phenotype: CD31 + CD34 bright CD45 dim− Ac133 + CD14 − LIVEDEAD − . Following staining, cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde (Tousimis) and run within 72 hours of fixation on a BD LSRII flow cytometry equipped with a 405nm violet laser, 488nm blue laser, and a 633nm red laser. Data were acquired uncompensated and exported as FCS 3.0 files for analysis using FlowJo Software (version 9.9.6,Tree Star Inc). Investigators were blind to patients’ clinical response during the data aquistition and analysis. Statistical Analysis The study used an optimal Simon 2-stage design , with a null hypothesis response rate of 0.05 and an alternative of 0.25, power of 80% and type I error of 0.05. This called for a first stage sample size of 9 with expansion of up to 24 participants (if at least one of the first 9 participants had a PR) to achieve at least 17 participants evaluable for response. The initial participant enrolled on 9/4/2014, and the last participant was enrolled on 2/24/2016. All participants in this stratum have been off treatment since 1/29/2018; however, on the basis of the promising results of these particpants, the study was amended to include a pediatric stratum (enrollment restricted to those age 3–15 years), which enrolled its first participant on 11/21/18 and is in the last stages of enrollment. Descriptive statistics including means, percentage, etc. were used to summarize the pain and QOL data. The primary analyses were done comparing proportions to the null hypothesized proportion response. The changes were assessed in the total group (n=19) as well as between the volumetric responders (n=8) and non-responders (n=11). We analyzed changes over time in the tumor size response and other parameters using a linear mixed model approach with an unstructured correlation matrix and compared differences using Least Square Means (LSM) from SAS PROC MIXED (version 9.4). This method accommodates missing values, although it assumes that data are missing at random, which was technically violated because the protocol required removal from treatment if sufficient responses were not achieved. Nevertheless, the technique was used to summarize the responses over time. 57 For biomarker analysis of circulating proangiogenic CHSPCs and cytokines, participants were stratified by clinical response (PR vs SD). Due to the limited sample size and missing data across multiple timepoints, cell and cytokine levels measured at C0 and C1D15 were merged as an early time point, and C2 and C4 as a later time point. If two values were observed at either C0/C1D15 or C2/C4, the mean of the two values was utilized to represent the measure at the early (C0/C1D15) or late time (C2/C4) point. If only one data point was measured at either C0/C1D15 or C2/C4, that value was directly used in subsequent computational analysis. Applying these criteria, CHSPC features from 6 SD patients and 7 PR patients, and cytokine features from 6 SD patients and 8 PR patients were used in the analysis (see  Supplementary Materials: CHSPC-and- Cytokine-Data.xlsx ). To identify associations between CHSPC and cytokines levels with long term clinical response, changes in CHSPC and cytokine levels between in early (C0/C1D15) and late (C2/C4) cycles were computed and evaluated by the Mann Whitney test in participants with SD vs PR. Preclinical Study Experimental animals Genetically engineered  Nf1 flox/flox ;PostnCre  mice on a mixed C57BL/6 × 129/SV background were utilized for  in vivo  studies, with genotypes confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as previously described . Animal care and experiments were conducted according to the guidelines established by the Indiana University Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), protocol # 11405. The experimental mice were housed in the Laboratory Animal Research Facility (LARC) at Indiana University at an ambient temperature of 22 ± 2 °C, relative humidity of 30 to 70%, and a 12 hour light-dark cycle from 7:00 AM EST. 23 Drug treatment in experimental mice Cohorts of 4–5 month old, male and female (age and sex matched)  Nf1 flox/flox ;PostnCre  mice were treated with either 15mg/kg cabozantinib daily or the vehicle, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) as the control administered by oral gavage for a duration of 12 weeks. The number of mice per group was determined by a power analysis conducted at the outset of the study as per the preclinical statistical analysis section. Mice were then euthanized to evaluate the extent of tumor burden as outlined below. Investigators were blinded to the treatment groups during drug treatment and response evaluation. Pharmacokinetic analysis of cabozantinib 1. Plasma Sample Analysis Cabozantinib was quantified from plasma using temazepam as the internal standard and High Performance Liquid Chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) (5500 QTRAP ®  AB Sciex, Framingham, MA). In brief, cabozantinib and temazepam were separated by a gradient mobile phase (acetonitrile: 0.1% formic acid) with a Restek C8 150X4.6 mm 5 μm column. The mass spectrometer utilized an electrospray ionization probe run in positive mode. The multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) Q1/Q3 (m/z) transitions for cabozantinib and temazepam were 502.3/323.3 and 301.1/254.9 respectively. For the plasma samples, 20μL were transferred to a polypropylene tube, temazepam was added as the internal standard (20μL of 0.01ng/μL), and the extraction was performed by the addition of 0.1M citric acid buffer (pH=3.0) followed by the addition of hexane:ethyl acetate; 50:50; v/v. The samples were then vortexed, centrifuged, the organic layer was transferred to a clean polypropylene tube, and evaporated to dryness. The samples were then reconstituted with mobile phase (50μL) and an aliquot (10μL) injected to the HPLC-MS/MS. 2. Tissue Sample Analysis Cabozantinib was quantified from tissue samples using a slightly modified method from the plasma sample analysis. Briefly, the tissue was weighed then transferred to a polypropylene tube. Phosphate buffered saline was added to the tissue to bring the total volume to 0.5mL (assumption 1g=1mL). The tissue was homogenized using a TissueRuptor ®  with a single use disposable probe. An aliquot (0.4mL) was transferred to a clean polypropylene tube and temazepam was added as the internal standard, (20μL of 0.1ng/μL). The extraction procedure and HPLC-MS/MS conditions were the same as for the plasma samples. Non-compartmental analysis of the data was performed using pharmacokinetic (PK) Solver add-ins in Excel®. Pharmacokinetic parameters obtained included: C max  (the maximal plasma concentration), t max  (the time of maximal plasma concentration), AUC 0−∞  (area under the plasma concentration time curve from zero to infinity), k el  (the elimination rate constant), and t 1/2  (half-life, t 1/2 =0.693/k el ). The AUC 0−∞  was calculated from the AUC 0-t  (time zero to the last quantifiable concentration C last ) and the AUC from C last  to infinity (C last /k el ). The systemic clearance (Cl/F, where F is the bioavailability) was calculated from the dose and AUC 0−∞. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss/F) was calculated by the Cl and k el . Parallel studies were conducted using tumor specimens. Nerve tree microdissection and measurement of tumor volume Immediately postmortem, fresh blood and select tissues were harvested and mice were perfused and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. The bodies were decalcified in 5% formic acid. The proximal spinal nerve trees, brachial, and trigeminal nerves were dissected microscopically. The volume of proximal peripheral nerves was determined using calipers to measure the length and width of dissected tumors (or equivalent region in absence of tumor) in maximal dimension. Volume was then approximated using the formula for the volume of a spheroid = 0.52 × (width) 2  × length. Histopathology Paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson’s trichrome to examine tumor histomorphology. Infiltrating mast cells were enumerated on toluidine blue stained sections by three independent investigators who were blinded to the treatment group. Ten randomly selected 40x high power fields were scored on each slide. Five micron-thick paraffin sections were deparaffinized, hydrated and transferred to 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for antigen retrieval in a pressure cooker. Sections were incubated in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes, rinsed, and blocked in 5% normal goat serum in TBST (TBS buffer + 0.1% tween 20). Sections were incubated overnight at 4°C in primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer; CD31 (ab28364, 1:50, Abcam) and AXL (ab227871, 1:500, Abcam). Sections were then incubated in a biotinylated secondary antibody for 1 hr at room temperature; goat anti-rabbit (B8895, 1:800, Sigma). Vectastain Elite ABC reagent was applied for 30 min at room temperature. Color development with Vectastain DAB was observed under the microscope and the reaction was terminated by rinsing in distilled water. Sections were counterstained with modified Mayer’s Hematoxylin (Vector), dehydrated, cleared and coverslipped. Slide images were acquired either on an Aperio ScanScope CS or a QImaging Retiga 2000R camera on a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope. CD31 immunohistochemical staining was performed to evaluate neoangiogenesis in cabozantinib and vehicle treated animals. CD31+ staining blood vessels were counted manually on 10 randomly selected high power fields per slide. Investigators were again blinded to the treatment groups. AXL immunohistochemistry was analyzed using the IHC Profiler plugin for ImageJ (version 1.47), and the percentage of high positive pixels was analyzed by ANOVA using Graphpad Prism. TUNEL Staining The FragEL™ DNA Fragmentation Detection Kit (Sigma Aldrich #QIA21) was used according to manufacturer’s instructions as follows. Tissue slides and the kit-provided positive control slide were deparaffinized with xylenes and rehydrated through graded alcohols. Tissue was encircled with an ImmEdge hydrophobic marker, covered with distilled water, and placed into a humidified slide tray. Proteinase K was applied at room temperature for 20 minutes to permeablize the tissue. Slides were rinsed in tris-buffered saline (TBS) between each subsequent step unless otherwise noted. Three percent hydrogen peroxide was applied to the slides for 5 minutes at room temperature to quench endogenous peroxidase. Slides were incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes with Klenow Equilibration Buffer. Without rinsing, excess buffer was suctioned from the slide and fresh Klenow Labeling Reaction mixture was made and applied to each tissue section. Parafilm® coverslips were applied to each tissue section to prevent evaporation of the reaction mixture during the incubation. The humidified slide tray was incubated at 37°C for 1.5 hours. The slide chamber was then brought back to room temperature. Coverslips were removed and Stop Solution was added to terminate the reaction. Slides were then incubated in Blocking Buffer for 10 minutes at room temperature. Without rinsing, the Blocking Buffer was suctioned from the slide and the Conjugate solution was applied to the tissue. Slides were incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. DAB solution was applied to the slides for 10 minutes, and the positive control slide was checked to ensure positive staining was achieved. Slides were incubated in methyl green solution for 5 minutes then quickly dipped in 2 changes of ethanol and 3 changes of xylenes, then coverslipped using glass coverslips and Cytoseal XYL mounting medium. Whole slide images were generated with an Aperio CS2 Scanscope and representative image were generated using HALO Image Analysis Software (version 2.3, Indica Labs). Preclinical Kinome Analysis Multiplexed inhibitor bead (MIB) chromatography and mass spectrometry (MS) MIB and MS was performed on snap-frozen sciatic nerve tissue from tumor bearing mice treated with vehicle or 1 day, 3 days, or 7 days of cabozantinib. Tissue was crushed by mortar and pestle in ice-cold MIB lysis buffer (50mM HEPES, 150mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1mM EDTA, 1mM EGTA, pH 7.5) supplemented with cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and 1% phosphatase inhibitor cocktails 2 and 3 Sigma). Extracts were sonicated 3 × 10s, clarified by centrifugation, and syringe-filtered (0.22μm) prior to Bradford assay quantitation of concentration. Equal amounts of total protein were gravity-flowed over multiplexed inhibitor bead (MIB) columns in high salt MIB lysis buffer (1M NaCl). The MIB columns consisted of 125μL mixture of five Type I kinase inhibitors: VI-16832, PP58, Purvalanol B, UNC-21474, and BKM-120 were custom-synthesized with hydrocarbon linkers and covalently linked to ECH-Sepharose and Purvalanol B was linked to EAH-Sepharose beads as previously described . For  32 in vitro  MIB competition assays to demonstrate quantitatively the direct binding of cabozantinib to kinases within the tumor, lysates were incubated with beads (125 μL equal amounts of inhibitors above plus CTx0294885) at 4°C with DMSO or 10, 100, or 1000nM cabozantinib for 1 h prior to flowing them over the MIB columns. Columns were washed with 5mL of high salt (1M NaCl), 5mL of low salt (150mM NaCl) MIB lysis buffer, and 0.5mL low-salt lysis buffer with 0.1%SDS. Bound protein was eluted twice with 0.5% SDS, 1% beta-mercaptoethanol, 100mM Tris-HCl, pH6.8 for 15 min at 100°C. Eluate was treated with DTT (5mM) for 25 min at 60C and 20mM iodoacetamide for 30 min in the dark. Following spin concentration using Amicon Ultra-4 (10k cut-off) to ~100 μL, samples were precipitated by methanol/chloroform, dried in a speed-vac and resuspended in 50mM HEPES (pH8.0). Tryptic digests were performed overnight at 37°C, extracted four times with 1mL ethyl acetate to remove detergent, dried in a speed-vac, and peptides further cleaned using C-18 spin columns according to manufacturer’s protocol (Pierce). Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry Peptides were resuspended in 5% ACN and 0.1% formic acid. Approximately 40% of the final peptide suspension was injected onto a Thermo Easy-Spray 75μm × 25cm C-18 column and separated on a 180min gradient (5–40% ACN) using an Easy nLC-1000. The Thermo Q Exactive mass spectrometry ESI parameters were as follows: 3e6 AGC MS1, 80ms MS1 max inject time, 1e5 AGC MS2, 100ms MS2 max inject time, 20 loop count, 1.8 m/z isolation window, 45s dynamic exclusion. Raw files were processed for label-free quantification by MaxQuant (version 1.6.10.43) LFQ using the Uniprot/Swiss-Prot mouse database, fixed carbidomethyl (C) and variable phospho (STY), oxidation (M), and acetyl (Protein N-term) modifications. LFQ intensities for kinases with at least two peptides were imported into Perseus (version 1.6.10.50). Western blot Isolated proteins were fractionated using NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris Gels (Invitrogen Cat#NP0322BOX) and electro-transferred to PVDF membranes. Immunoblots were carried out using antibodies specific to pAXL (Cat#5724, 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), AXL (Cat#ab215205, 1:1000, Abcam), pAKT (Cat #9271, 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), pGSK-3β (Cat#9323, 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), pMEK1/2 (Cat#9121, 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), and GAPDH (#CST-5174, 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology). After incubation with appropriate HRP conjugated secondary antibodies (Anti-rabbit (#NA934V, 1:5000, GE Healthcare), Anti-Rat(#AP-136P, 1:5000, EMD), signals were detected using ECL chemoluminescence substrate (ECL Prime, GE Healthcare). Schwann cell culture Mouse embryos were harvested at embryonic day 13.5 and dorsa root ganglia (DRG) were isolated under a dissecting microscope. The DRGs were digested in 0.05% trypsin-EDTA and dissociate with syringes. The resulting suspensions were plated on PDL/laminin coated plates in Schwann Cell Media I (SCM-I) consisting of Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 50 U/mL penicillin, 50 μg/mL streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1X N2 supplement, and 250 ng/mL nerve growth factor (NGF). The following day, the medium was changed to Schwann Cell Media II (SCM-II), which was identical to SCM-I except for the substitution of 10 ng/mL neuregulin in exchange for NGF and the addition of 2 μM forskolin to suppress fibroblast growth. Cells were used for experiments after approximately 10–14 days of culture. Apoptosis assays Human immortalized  NF1 −/−  Schwann cells (iPNF95.6) were plated in triplicate at a density of 5,000 cells/well in 96 well plates, allowed to adhere overnight, and then treated with either DMSO or increasing concentrations of cabozatninib from 39 nM to 5 μM. Navitoclax 1 μM was also used as a positive control. Caspase 3/7 Glo activity (#G8093, Promega) was measured by luminescence after 24 hours of treatment according to the manufacturer’s instructions using SynergyH4 microplate reader. Murine embryonic fibroblast culture Mouse embryos were harvested at 18.5 days post-coitus and dissected under a low-power microscope. After removal of the heads and internal organs, embryos were minced and trypsinized for 20 min. The resultant suspension was seeded onto culture dishes in Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco Medium (IMDM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% L-glutamine. Upon reaching confluence, cells were split at 1:2 ratios until a morphologically homogeneous culture was obtained. The cells were then frozen or expanded for further studies. Cells at passage 2–3 were used for experiments. Endothelial Colony Forming Cell Assays Umbilical cord blood derived endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs) were obtained from the Angio BioCore (Indiana University) and passaged once before plating for a proliferation assay via cell counting. ECFCs were plated on rat tail collagen and were allowed to set down overnight before starting 200ng of GAS6 and/or 100nM cabozantinib treatments. ECFCs were trypsinized and counted manually using a glass hemocytometer after 48 hours with an n=3 independent experiments performed. Mouse sAXL ELISA Levels of circulating sAXL were measured in mouse plasma using the Mouse AXL DuoSet ELISA kit (R&D Systems, DY854) and accompanying DuoSet ELISA Ancillary Reagent Kit 2 (R&D Systems, DY008) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Mouse plasma samples were assayed in duplicate at dilution of 1:200 in Reagent Diluent. Optical density of each well was measured using a VERSAmax Tunable Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices) with SOFmax PRO software. Optical density readings at 540 nm were subtracted from the readings at 450 nm for wavelength correction. Preclinical Statistical Analysis For the  in vivo  therapeutics studies in  Nf1 flox/flox ;PostnCre  mice treated with either vehicle vs cabozantinb, a preliminary power analysis was conducted to determine the appropriate sample size, assuming a 5% type I error rate. Our preliminary data suggested a coefficient of variation of 48% for tumor number. Thus, we determined that 16 animals per group would allow detection of a 57% reduction in tumor number with an 81.3% power. In addition, our preliminary data indicated that the coefficient of variation for proximal nerve root size was less than 38%. Thus, 16 animals per group would allow us to detect a 40% difference in tumor size with greater than 82.1% power. Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 8.0 software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Student’s t-tests with post-hoc correction for multiple comparisons were used to evaluate for statistically significant differences between samples as described in detail within the figure legends. For MIB/MS analysis from  in vivo  drug treatments, log 2  transformed LFQ intensities were filtered to include only kinases with at least three valid values in at least one treatment group and missing values were imputed from the total matrix in Perseus. Student’s t-tests were performed in Perseus with Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple hypothesis testing. For  in vitro  MIB competition assays done in duplicate, missing log 2  LFQ intensities were imputed for each column separately.

METHODS Clinical Trial Study Population Inclusion criteria included patients aged 16 years or older with a diagnosis of NF1 and an unresectable PN that was measurable by volumetric analysis  and either progressive (defined as ≥20% increase in the volume, ≥13% increase in the product of the two longest perpendicular diameters, or ≥6% increase in the longest diameter in the prior year) or causing significant morbidity, such as (but not limited to) head and neck lesions compromising the airway or great vessels, brachial or lumbar plexus lesions causing nerve compression and loss of function, lesions causing major deformity or significant disfigurement, lesions of the extremity causing limb hypertrophy or loss of function, and painful lesions. Histologic confirmation of tumor was not necessary in the presence of consistent clinical and imaging findings. Previous treatment for a PN was allowed but participants must have recovered from the acute toxic effects of all therapy. Other eligibility criteria included (a) adequate performance status (Karnofsky score ≥ 50); (b) normal hematologic, hepatic, renal, and cardiovascular function; and (c) signed informed consent from the patient (≥18 years of age) or their legal guardians (<18 years of age), according to institutional review board guidelines. 35 Participants were excluded if they (a) had an active optic glioma or other low-grade glioma requiring treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy; (b) required treatment for a malignancy in the prior 12 months; (c) had dental braces or prosthesis that interfere with volumetric analysis; (d) were unable to swallow tablets; (e) were post-pubertal males/females who would not agree to use effective contraception, or were pregnant/breast-feeding females; (f) had a known history of HIV or immunodeficiency; (g) had impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that significantly alters the absorption of cabozantinib; (h) had concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease; (i) required therapeutic treatment with anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents with the exception of low dose aspirin, low-dose warfarin, and prophylactic low molecular weight heparin; or (j) had undergone major surgery within 3 months or minor surgery within one month of first dose of cabozantinib. In participants who had received therapy prior to study enrollment, 2 weeks – 6 months must have elapsed, depending on the specific prior therapy. The use of strong CYP3A4 inducers/inhibitors was not allowed while on study. A complete list of the inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in  Supplementary Table 2 . Ethics oversight was provided by both the local IRB’s (Children’s Hospital Boston/Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Massachusetts General Hospital, Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Children’s National Medical Center, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, Indiana University, Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago, National Cancer Institute, New York University, University of Alabama at Birmingham, University of Chicago, University of Utah, The Washington University in St. Louis) and the U.S. Army Medical Research and Material Command (USAMRMC) Human Research Protections Office (HRPO). Each participating center’s local IRB reviewed and approved the study. Once local approval was obtained, this was submitted to the USAMRMC HRPO for review and approval. No study related activities could commence without approval of both the local IRB and the USAMRMC HRPO. In addition, the study was also approved by the FDA. Study Design This prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized phase 2 trial was performed by the NF Clinical Trials Consortium. The primary measure of efficacy was volumetric response of the target PN determined by central review of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as per the recommendations from REiNS (Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis), an international effort to develop standardized outcome measures for clinical trials . Secondary endpoints included safety and tolerability, patient-reported outcomes (PRO) assessing tumor pain intensity (Numeric Rating Scale-11; NRS-11), pain interference in daily life (Brief Pain Inventory-Pain Interference Scale; BPI-PI), and disease-specific quality of life (PedsQL NF1 module), PK, and circulating endothelial cells and cytokines. Additional planned secondary outcomes not reported in this manuscript included estimating the overall response rate for non-target PN (there were 5 non-target PN identified in a total of 4 participants), a determination of whether patients who respond to cabozantinib maintained that response for one year off therapy (not reported because the protocol did not require that off-treatment MRI scans be performed, so that information was unavailable), assessing the activity of cabozantinib on mast cell activity by mast cell culture and FACS (not performed as samples were limited and other aims were prioritized), and assessing the PedsQL NF1 QOL Module, a disease specific QOL scale, for use in this patient population (a planned future analysis will combine this data with data from other PN trials using the PedsQL NF1 QOL Module). Cabozantinib was given daily on a continuous dosing schedule for up to 24 cycles. Each treatment cycle was 28 days. The starting cabozantinib dose was 40 mg daily with planned dose escalation to 60 mg daily after 2 cycles if tolerated ( 35 Figure 3a ). For participants who experienced dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), up to two dose reductions were allowed (40 mg and 20 mg). Participants were removed from therapy if they experienced a cabozantinib-related toxicity requiring removal, for progressive disease, or if they had not achieved a partial response (PR; defined as a ≥20% reduction in tumor volume compared with pre-treatment baseline) by the end of 12 cycle. In addition, participants who had not achieved at least 15% reduction in tumor volume at cycle 8 were removed from study for safety reasons, as it was believed that the likelihood of achieving PR by 12 months was minimal. Participants were considered evaluable for toxicity if they received at least one dose of the study drug and evaluable for response if they completed at least two cycles of therapy and had their first follow-up MRI evaluation. Baseline MRI was required within 4 weeks prior to study entry. Tumor response by MRI was determined after cycle 4, 8, and 12, and then after cycle 18 and 24 for those who continued therapy. Axial and coronal STIR images were obtained to cover the entire PN with 5–10 mm slice thickness. Imaging response was evaluated centrally at the Pediatric Oncology Branch of the National Cancer Institute using volumetric MRI analysis . Disease progression was defined as a ≥20% increase, and partial response as ≥20% reduction in the volume of the target PN, confirmed by a follow-up MRI. Safety evaluations including laboratory monitoring, electrocardiograms, physical exams, and vital signs were performed at regular intervals as outlined in  53 Supplementary Table 3 . Adverse events were graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. Participants were considered evaluable for toxicity if they received at least 1 dose of the study drug. Success was defined as ≥25% of participants achieving PR after 12 cycles without significant toxicity. Patient Reported Outcome Measures All participants completed the following patient-reported outcomes (PROs) prior to study entry, at cycle 4, 8, and 12, and then after cycle 18 and 24 if they continued therapy. Pain Intensity and Pain Interference Measures Numerical Rating Scale-11 (NRS-11): The  NRS-11  is a self-report 11-point numeric scale that assesses pain intensity . It consists of a horizontal line with 0 representing “no pain” at the left end of the line and 10 representing “worst pain you can imagine” at the right end. Participants were asked to circle the one number from 0 to 10 that best described their “most important tumor pain” at its worst during the past week. 54 Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)-Pain Interference (PI) Scale: The  BPI-PI Scale  is a 7-item self-report questionnaire that measures the extent to which pain interferes with daily functioning . Participants were asked to indicate how much pain interfered with various activities (general activity, mood, walking, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life) in the past week, with scores ranging from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes). The total score is the mean of all 7 items. 55 NF1 Disease-Specific Quality of Life Measures PedsQL™ NF1 Module: This scale is a self-report measure assessing NF1 disease-specific QOL . Participants who were ages 21 years and older completed the 74-item self-report adult questionnaire. It is comprised of 16 scales (physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning, cognitive functioning, communication, worry, perceived physical appearance, pain and hurt, paresthesias, skin irritation, sensation, movement and balance, fatigue, daily activities, treatment anxiety, and sexual functioning). Participants 16–20 years of age completed the self-report  37 teen version . It is comprised of 16 scales (physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning, cognitive functioning, communication, worry, perceived physical appearance, pain and hurt, paresthesias, skin irritation, sensation, movement and balance, fatigue, daily activities, treatment anxiety, and school activities). Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale (0 – 4) and transformed to a 0 – 100 scale, with higher domain and total mean raw scores indicating better QOL. Pharmacokinetic Analysis Blood samples were collected at 6 time-points for cabozantinib plasma concentration measurement: Cycle 1 Day 1 (pre, 4 hours after first dose), Cycle 1 Day 15 (pre, 4 hours after dose), and Cycle 1 Day 28 (pre, 4 hours after dose) and were shipped to Alturas Analytics (Moscow, ID) for analysis. Cabozantinib concentrations in human plasma matrix were quantified using a validated liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometry assay with 0.5 ng/mL as the lower limit of quantification. Cytokine Analysis Plasma samples were received from all 19 participants who were evaluable for response, but only 14 had multiple usable time points. Samples were stored at −80°C in the Translational Research Integrated Biology Laboratory (TRIB) in Riley Hospital for Children until collection and analysis of all samples. Samples were thawed, centrifuged to remove particulates (16,300 g for 10 min) and analyzed for 44 biomarkers by Luminex xMAP technology. Targets were detected using premixed kits from MilliporeSigma. The biomarkers measured included SCF (using a 1-Plex human Cytokine/Chemokine Magnetic Bead Panel); TGF-B1, TGFB2, TGFB3 (using a TGFβ−3 Plex Magnetic bead panel); sCD40L, EGF, Eotaxin/CCL11, FGF-2, Flt-3 ligand, Fractalkine, G-CSF, GM-CSF, GRO, IFN-α2, IFN-γ, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-1RA, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12 (p40), IL-12 (p70), IL-13, IL-15, IL-17A, IP-10, MCP-1, MCP-3, MDC (CCL22), MIP-1α, MIP-1β,TGF-α, TNF-α, TNF-β (using a Human Cytokine/Chemokine 37-Plex Magnetic Bead Panel), and VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGF-D (using a Human Angiogenesis/Growth Factor 3-Plex Magnetic Bead Panel). Samples were diluted according to manufacturer’s recommendations, assayed in duplicate using a Bio-Plex 200 System with high-throughput fluidics (HTF) multiplex array system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, California, US), and analyzed using Bio-Plex Manager software (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Biomarker assays were run by the Multiplex Analysis Core at the Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center, Indiana University. Levels of circulating sAXL were measured in human plasma using the Human AXL DuoSet ELISA kit (R&D Systems, DY154) and accompanying DuoSet ELISA Ancillary Reagent Kit 2 (R&D Systems, DY008) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Human plasma samples were assayed in duplicate at dilution of 1:200 in Reagent Diluent. Optical density of each well was measured using a VERSAmax Tunable Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices) with SOFmax PRO software. Optical density readings at 540 nm were subtracted from the readings at 450 nm for wavelength correction. Investigators were blind to patients’ clinical response during data collection and analysis. Circulating Progenitor Cell Analysis The flow cytometry assay was performed in real time within 24 hours of peripheral blood collection. Peripheral blood collected off-site was shipped overnight. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and incubated with Fc blocking reagent and stained as previously described . Briefly, following Fc block, mononuclear cells were stained with anti-human CD31 (FITC, BD), anti-human CD34 (PE, BD), anti-human AC133 (APC, Miltenyi Biotec), anti-human CD14 (PECy5.5, Abcam), anti-human CD45 (APC-AG740, Invitrogen), and the fixable amine reactive viability dye LiveDead (violet, Invitrogen). Fluorescent minus one (FMO) gating was used to properly delineate positive events. Circulating hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (CHSPCs) have the phenotype: CD31 56 + CD34 bright CD45 dim CD14 − LIVEDEAD − . The proangiogenic fraction of the CHSPCs additionally stain positive for Ac133 +  and have the phenotype: CD31 + CD34 bright CD45 dim− Ac133 + CD14 − LIVEDEAD − . Following staining, cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde (Tousimis) and run within 72 hours of fixation on a BD LSRII flow cytometry equipped with a 405nm violet laser, 488nm blue laser, and a 633nm red laser. Data were acquired uncompensated and exported as FCS 3.0 files for analysis using FlowJo Software (version 9.9.6,Tree Star Inc). Investigators were blind to patients’ clinical response during the data aquistition and analysis. Statistical Analysis The study used an optimal Simon 2-stage design , with a null hypothesis response rate of 0.05 and an alternative of 0.25, power of 80% and type I error of 0.05. This called for a first stage sample size of 9 with expansion of up to 24 participants (if at least one of the first 9 participants had a PR) to achieve at least 17 participants evaluable for response. The initial participant enrolled on 9/4/2014, and the last participant was enrolled on 2/24/2016. All participants in this stratum have been off treatment since 1/29/2018; however, on the basis of the promising results of these particpants, the study was amended to include a pediatric stratum (enrollment restricted to those age 3–15 years), which enrolled its first participant on 11/21/18 and is in the last stages of enrollment. Descriptive statistics including means, percentage, etc. were used to summarize the pain and QOL data. The primary analyses were done comparing proportions to the null hypothesized proportion response. The changes were assessed in the total group (n=19) as well as between the volumetric responders (n=8) and non-responders (n=11). We analyzed changes over time in the tumor size response and other parameters using a linear mixed model approach with an unstructured correlation matrix and compared differences using Least Square Means (LSM) from SAS PROC MIXED (version 9.4). This method accommodates missing values, although it assumes that data are missing at random, which was technically violated because the protocol required removal from treatment if sufficient responses were not achieved. Nevertheless, the technique was used to summarize the responses over time. 57 For biomarker analysis of circulating proangiogenic CHSPCs and cytokines, participants were stratified by clinical response (PR vs SD). Due to the limited sample size and missing data across multiple timepoints, cell and cytokine levels measured at C0 and C1D15 were merged as an early time point, and C2 and C4 as a later time point. If two values were observed at either C0/C1D15 or C2/C4, the mean of the two values was utilized to represent the measure at the early (C0/C1D15) or late time (C2/C4) point. If only one data point was measured at either C0/C1D15 or C2/C4, that value was directly used in subsequent computational analysis. Applying these criteria, CHSPC features from 6 SD patients and 7 PR patients, and cytokine features from 6 SD patients and 8 PR patients were used in the analysis (see  Supplementary Materials: CHSPC-and- Cytokine-Data.xlsx ). To identify associations between CHSPC and cytokines levels with long term clinical response, changes in CHSPC and cytokine levels between in early (C0/C1D15) and late (C2/C4) cycles were computed and evaluated by the Mann Whitney test in participants with SD vs PR. Preclinical Study Experimental animals Genetically engineered  Nf1 flox/flox ;PostnCre  mice on a mixed C57BL/6 × 129/SV background were utilized for  in vivo  studies, with genotypes confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as previously described . Animal care and experiments were conducted according to the guidelines established by the Indiana University Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), protocol # 11405. The experimental mice were housed in the Laboratory Animal Research Facility (LARC) at Indiana University at an ambient temperature of 22 ± 2 °C, relative humidity of 30 to 70%, and a 12 hour light-dark cycle from 7:00 AM EST. 23 Drug treatment in experimental mice Cohorts of 4–5 month old, male and female (age and sex matched)  Nf1 flox/flox ;PostnCre  mice were treated with either 15mg/kg cabozantinib daily or the vehicle, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) as the control administered by oral gavage for a duration of 12 weeks. The number of mice per group was determined by a power analysis conducted at the outset of the study as per the preclinical statistical analysis section. Mice were then euthanized to evaluate the extent of tumor burden as outlined below. Investigators were blinded to the treatment groups during drug treatment and response evaluation. Pharmacokinetic analysis of cabozantinib 1. Plasma Sample Analysis Cabozantinib was quantified from plasma using temazepam as the internal standard and High Performance Liquid Chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) (5500 QTRAP ®  AB Sciex, Framingham, MA). In brief, cabozantinib and temazepam were separated by a gradient mobile phase (acetonitrile: 0.1% formic acid) with a Restek C8 150X4.6 mm 5 μm column. The mass spectrometer utilized an electrospray ionization probe run in positive mode. The multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) Q1/Q3 (m/z) transitions for cabozantinib and temazepam were 502.3/323.3 and 301.1/254.9 respectively. For the plasma samples, 20μL were transferred to a polypropylene tube, temazepam was added as the internal standard (20μL of 0.01ng/μL), and the extraction was performed by the addition of 0.1M citric acid buffer (pH=3.0) followed by the addition of hexane:ethyl acetate; 50:50; v/v. The samples were then vortexed, centrifuged, the organic layer was transferred to a clean polypropylene tube, and evaporated to dryness. The samples were then reconstituted with mobile phase (50μL) and an aliquot (10μL) injected to the HPLC-MS/MS. 2. Tissue Sample Analysis Cabozantinib was quantified from tissue samples using a slightly modified method from the plasma sample analysis. Briefly, the tissue was weighed then transferred to a polypropylene tube. Phosphate buffered saline was added to the tissue to bring the total volume to 0.5mL (assumption 1g=1mL). The tissue was homogenized using a TissueRuptor ®  with a single use disposable probe. An aliquot (0.4mL) was transferred to a clean polypropylene tube and temazepam was added as the internal standard, (20μL of 0.1ng/μL). The extraction procedure and HPLC-MS/MS conditions were the same as for the plasma samples. Non-compartmental analysis of the data was performed using pharmacokinetic (PK) Solver add-ins in Excel®. Pharmacokinetic parameters obtained included: C max  (the maximal plasma concentration), t max  (the time of maximal plasma concentration), AUC 0−∞  (area under the plasma concentration time curve from zero to infinity), k el  (the elimination rate constant), and t 1/2  (half-life, t 1/2 =0.693/k el ). The AUC 0−∞  was calculated from the AUC 0-t  (time zero to the last quantifiable concentration C last ) and the AUC from C last  to infinity (C last /k el ). The systemic clearance (Cl/F, where F is the bioavailability) was calculated from the dose and AUC 0−∞. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss/F) was calculated by the Cl and k el . Parallel studies were conducted using tumor specimens. Nerve tree microdissection and measurement of tumor volume Immediately postmortem, fresh blood and select tissues were harvested and mice were perfused and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. The bodies were decalcified in 5% formic acid. The proximal spinal nerve trees, brachial, and trigeminal nerves were dissected microscopically. The volume of proximal peripheral nerves was determined using calipers to measure the length and width of dissected tumors (or equivalent region in absence of tumor) in maximal dimension. Volume was then approximated using the formula for the volume of a spheroid = 0.52 × (width) 2  × length. Histopathology Paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson’s trichrome to examine tumor histomorphology. Infiltrating mast cells were enumerated on toluidine blue stained sections by three independent investigators who were blinded to the treatment group. Ten randomly selected 40x high power fields were scored on each slide. Five micron-thick paraffin sections were deparaffinized, hydrated and transferred to 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for antigen retrieval in a pressure cooker. Sections were incubated in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes, rinsed, and blocked in 5% normal goat serum in TBST (TBS buffer + 0.1% tween 20). Sections were incubated overnight at 4°C in primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer; CD31 (ab28364, 1:50, Abcam) and AXL (ab227871, 1:500, Abcam). Sections were then incubated in a biotinylated secondary antibody for 1 hr at room temperature; goat anti-rabbit (B8895, 1:800, Sigma). Vectastain Elite ABC reagent was applied for 30 min at room temperature. Color development with Vectastain DAB was observed under the microscope and the reaction was terminated by rinsing in distilled water. Sections were counterstained with modified Mayer’s Hematoxylin (Vector), dehydrated, cleared and coverslipped. Slide images were acquired either on an Aperio ScanScope CS or a QImaging Retiga 2000R camera on a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope. CD31 immunohistochemical staining was performed to evaluate neoangiogenesis in cabozantinib and vehicle treated animals. CD31+ staining blood vessels were counted manually on 10 randomly selected high power fields per slide. Investigators were again blinded to the treatment groups. AXL immunohistochemistry was analyzed using the IHC Profiler plugin for ImageJ (version 1.47), and the percentage of high positive pixels was analyzed by ANOVA using Graphpad Prism. TUNEL Staining The FragEL™ DNA Fragmentation Detection Kit (Sigma Aldrich #QIA21) was used according to manufacturer’s instructions as follows. Tissue slides and the kit-provided positive control slide were deparaffinized with xylenes and rehydrated through graded alcohols. Tissue was encircled with an ImmEdge hydrophobic marker, covered with distilled water, and placed into a humidified slide tray. Proteinase K was applied at room temperature for 20 minutes to permeablize the tissue. Slides were rinsed in tris-buffered saline (TBS) between each subsequent step unless otherwise noted. Three percent hydrogen peroxide was applied to the slides for 5 minutes at room temperature to quench endogenous peroxidase. Slides were incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes with Klenow Equilibration Buffer. Without rinsing, excess buffer was suctioned from the slide and fresh Klenow Labeling Reaction mixture was made and applied to each tissue section. Parafilm® coverslips were applied to each tissue section to prevent evaporation of the reaction mixture during the incubation. The humidified slide tray was incubated at 37°C for 1.5 hours. The slide chamber was then brought back to room temperature. Coverslips were removed and Stop Solution was added to terminate the reaction. Slides were then incubated in Blocking Buffer for 10 minutes at room temperature. Without rinsing, the Blocking Buffer was suctioned from the slide and the Conjugate solution was applied to the tissue. Slides were incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. DAB solution was applied to the slides for 10 minutes, and the positive control slide was checked to ensure positive staining was achieved. Slides were incubated in methyl green solution for 5 minutes then quickly dipped in 2 changes of ethanol and 3 changes of xylenes, then coverslipped using glass coverslips and Cytoseal XYL mounting medium. Whole slide images were generated with an Aperio CS2 Scanscope and representative image were generated using HALO Image Analysis Software (version 2.3, Indica Labs). Preclinical Kinome Analysis Multiplexed inhibitor bead (MIB) chromatography and mass spectrometry (MS) MIB and MS was performed on snap-frozen sciatic nerve tissue from tumor bearing mice treated with vehicle or 1 day, 3 days, or 7 days of cabozantinib. Tissue was crushed by mortar and pestle in ice-cold MIB lysis buffer (50mM HEPES, 150mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1mM EDTA, 1mM EGTA, pH 7.5) supplemented with cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and 1% phosphatase inhibitor cocktails 2 and 3 Sigma). Extracts were sonicated 3 × 10s, clarified by centrifugation, and syringe-filtered (0.22μm) prior to Bradford assay quantitation of concentration. Equal amounts of total protein were gravity-flowed over multiplexed inhibitor bead (MIB) columns in high salt MIB lysis buffer (1M NaCl). The MIB columns consisted of 125μL mixture of five Type I kinase inhibitors: VI-16832, PP58, Purvalanol B, UNC-21474, and BKM-120 were custom-synthesized with hydrocarbon linkers and covalently linked to ECH-Sepharose and Purvalanol B was linked to EAH-Sepharose beads as previously described . For  32 in vitro  MIB competition assays to demonstrate quantitatively the direct binding of cabozantinib to kinases within the tumor, lysates were incubated with beads (125 μL equal amounts of inhibitors above plus CTx0294885) at 4°C with DMSO or 10, 100, or 1000nM cabozantinib for 1 h prior to flowing them over the MIB columns. Columns were washed with 5mL of high salt (1M NaCl), 5mL of low salt (150mM NaCl) MIB lysis buffer, and 0.5mL low-salt lysis buffer with 0.1%SDS. Bound protein was eluted twice with 0.5% SDS, 1% beta-mercaptoethanol, 100mM Tris-HCl, pH6.8 for 15 min at 100°C. Eluate was treated with DTT (5mM) for 25 min at 60C and 20mM iodoacetamide for 30 min in the dark. Following spin concentration using Amicon Ultra-4 (10k cut-off) to ~100 μL, samples were precipitated by methanol/chloroform, dried in a speed-vac and resuspended in 50mM HEPES (pH8.0). Tryptic digests were performed overnight at 37°C, extracted four times with 1mL ethyl acetate to remove detergent, dried in a speed-vac, and peptides further cleaned using C-18 spin columns according to manufacturer’s protocol (Pierce). Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry Peptides were resuspended in 5% ACN and 0.1% formic acid. Approximately 40% of the final peptide suspension was injected onto a Thermo Easy-Spray 75μm × 25cm C-18 column and separated on a 180min gradient (5–40% ACN) using an Easy nLC-1000. The Thermo Q Exactive mass spectrometry ESI parameters were as follows: 3e6 AGC MS1, 80ms MS1 max inject time, 1e5 AGC MS2, 100ms MS2 max inject time, 20 loop count, 1.8 m/z isolation window, 45s dynamic exclusion. Raw files were processed for label-free quantification by MaxQuant (version 1.6.10.43) LFQ using the Uniprot/Swiss-Prot mouse database, fixed carbidomethyl (C) and variable phospho (STY), oxidation (M), and acetyl (Protein N-term) modifications. LFQ intensities for kinases with at least two peptides were imported into Perseus (version 1.6.10.50). Western blot Isolated proteins were fractionated using NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris Gels (Invitrogen Cat#NP0322BOX) and electro-transferred to PVDF membranes. Immunoblots were carried out using antibodies specific to pAXL (Cat#5724, 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), AXL (Cat#ab215205, 1:1000, Abcam), pAKT (Cat #9271, 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), pGSK-3β (Cat#9323, 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), pMEK1/2 (Cat#9121, 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), and GAPDH (#CST-5174, 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology). After incubation with appropriate HRP conjugated secondary antibodies (Anti-rabbit (#NA934V, 1:5000, GE Healthcare), Anti-Rat(#AP-136P, 1:5000, EMD), signals were detected using ECL chemoluminescence substrate (ECL Prime, GE Healthcare). Schwann cell culture Mouse embryos were harvested at embryonic day 13.5 and dorsa root ganglia (DRG) were isolated under a dissecting microscope. The DRGs were digested in 0.05% trypsin-EDTA and dissociate with syringes. The resulting suspensions were plated on PDL/laminin coated plates in Schwann Cell Media I (SCM-I) consisting of Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 50 U/mL penicillin, 50 μg/mL streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1X N2 supplement, and 250 ng/mL nerve growth factor (NGF). The following day, the medium was changed to Schwann Cell Media II (SCM-II), which was identical to SCM-I except for the substitution of 10 ng/mL neuregulin in exchange for NGF and the addition of 2 μM forskolin to suppress fibroblast growth. Cells were used for experiments after approximately 10–14 days of culture. Apoptosis assays Human immortalized  NF1 −/−  Schwann cells (iPNF95.6) were plated in triplicate at a density of 5,000 cells/well in 96 well plates, allowed to adhere overnight, and then treated with either DMSO or increasing concentrations of cabozatninib from 39 nM to 5 μM. Navitoclax 1 μM was also used as a positive control. Caspase 3/7 Glo activity (#G8093, Promega) was measured by luminescence after 24 hours of treatment according to the manufacturer’s instructions using SynergyH4 microplate reader. Murine embryonic fibroblast culture Mouse embryos were harvested at 18.5 days post-coitus and dissected under a low-power microscope. After removal of the heads and internal organs, embryos were minced and trypsinized for 20 min. The resultant suspension was seeded onto culture dishes in Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco Medium (IMDM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% L-glutamine. Upon reaching confluence, cells were split at 1:2 ratios until a morphologically homogeneous culture was obtained. The cells were then frozen or expanded for further studies. Cells at passage 2–3 were used for experiments. Endothelial Colony Forming Cell Assays Umbilical cord blood derived endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs) were obtained from the Angio BioCore (Indiana University) and passaged once before plating for a proliferation assay via cell counting. ECFCs were plated on rat tail collagen and were allowed to set down overnight before starting 200ng of GAS6 and/or 100nM cabozantinib treatments. ECFCs were trypsinized and counted manually using a glass hemocytometer after 48 hours with an n=3 independent experiments performed. Mouse sAXL ELISA Levels of circulating sAXL were measured in mouse plasma using the Mouse AXL DuoSet ELISA kit (R&D Systems, DY854) and accompanying DuoSet ELISA Ancillary Reagent Kit 2 (R&D Systems, DY008) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Mouse plasma samples were assayed in duplicate at dilution of 1:200 in Reagent Diluent. Optical density of each well was measured using a VERSAmax Tunable Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices) with SOFmax PRO software. Optical density readings at 540 nm were subtracted from the readings at 450 nm for wavelength correction. Preclinical Statistical Analysis For the  in vivo  therapeutics studies in  Nf1 flox/flox ;PostnCre  mice treated with either vehicle vs cabozantinb, a preliminary power analysis was conducted to determine the appropriate sample size, assuming a 5% type I error rate. Our preliminary data suggested a coefficient of variation of 48% for tumor number. Thus, we determined that 16 animals per group would allow detection of a 57% reduction in tumor number with an 81.3% power. In addition, our preliminary data indicated that the coefficient of variation for proximal nerve root size was less than 38%. Thus, 16 animals per group would allow us to detect a 40% difference in tumor size with greater than 82.1% power. Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 8.0 software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Student’s t-tests with post-hoc correction for multiple comparisons were used to evaluate for statistically significant differences between samples as described in detail within the figure legends. For MIB/MS analysis from  in vivo  drug treatments, log 2  transformed LFQ intensities were filtered to include only kinases with at least three valid values in at least one treatment group and missing values were imputed from the total matrix in Perseus. Student’s t-tests were performed in Perseus with Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple hypothesis testing. For  in vitro  MIB competition assays done in duplicate, missing log 2  LFQ intensities were imputed for each column separately.",Michael J Fisher; Chie-Schin Shih; Steven D Rhodes; Amy E Armstrong; Pamela L Wolters; Eva Dombi; Chi Zhang; Steven P Angus; Gary L Johnson; Roger J Packer; Jeffrey C Allen; Nicole J Ullrich; Stewart Goldman; David H Gutmann; Scott R Plotkin; Tena Rosser; Kent A Robertson; Brigitte C Widemann; Abbi E Smith; Waylan K Bessler; Yongzheng He; Su-Jung Park; Julie A Mund; Li Jiang; Khadijeh Bijangi-Vishehsaraei; Coretta Thomas Robinson; Gary R Cutter; Bruce R Korf; Jaishri O Blakeley; D Wade Clapp,Nature medicine,2021-01,10.1038/s41591-020-01193-6,minimal,True
PMID:29715273,Neurofibromatosis type 2 tumor suppressor protein is expressed in oligodendrocytes and regulates cell proliferation and process formation.,"The neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor protein Merlin functions as a negative regulator of cell growth and actin dynamics in different cell types amongst which Schwann cells have been extensively studied. In contrast, the presence and the role of Merlin in oligodendrocytes, the myelin forming cells within the CNS, have not been elucidated. In this work, we demonstrate that Merlin immunoreactivity was broadly distributed in the white matter throughout the central nervous system. Following Merlin expression during development in the cerebellum, Merlin could be detected in the cerebellar white matter tract at early postnatal stages as shown by its co-localization with Olig2-positive cells as well as in adult brain sections where it was aligned with myelin basic protein containing fibers. This suggests that Merlin is expressed in immature and mature oligodendrocytes. Expression levels of Merlin were low in oligodendrocytes as compared to astrocytes and neurons throughout development. Expression of Merlin in oligodendroglia was further supported by its identification in either immortalized cell lines of oligodendroglial origin or in primary oligodendrocyte cultures. In these cultures, the two main splice variants of Nf2 could be detected. Merlin was localized in clusters within the nuclei and in the cytoplasm. Overexpressing Merlin in oligodendrocyte cell lines strengthened reduced impedance in XCELLigence measurements and Ki67 stainings in cultures over time. In addition, the initiation and elongation of cellular projections were reduced by Merlin overexpression. Consistently, cell migration was retarded in scratch assays done on Nf2-transfected oligodendrocyte cell lines. These data suggest that Merlin actively modulates process outgrowth and migration in oligodendrocytes.","Materials and methods Animals All animals used in this work were housed under constant temperature and humidity conditions on a 12 h light/dark cycle, with access to food and water  ad libitum . Animals older than six weeks were classified as adults. NG2-EYFP mice, which carry a YFP fluorescent protein gene instead of a NG2 gene, are healthy and fertile and do not show any obvious phenotype [ 32 ]. They were kindly provided by Dr. J. Trotter (Institute of Molecular Biology, Mainz, Germany). Mice for cell cultures were obtained from breedings of C57Bl6/J mice (Janvier Labs, France). All mice were handled in strict adherence to local governmental and institutional animal care regulations and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz Nordrhein-Westfalen) under the permission number Az 84–02.05.20.13.121. For mouse anesthesia, a mixture of Ketamin/Rompun was intraperitoneally injected, and mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation after anesthesia. Immunohistochemistry To assess Merlin localization on nervous tissue, adult and nine day old mice (P9 mice) were transcardially perfused using Ringer´s solution, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Brains were dissected and postfixed for 6 hours. Sagittal sections were performed using a vibratome (VT1000 S; Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Sections were heated in 10 mM sodium-citrate buffer pH 9, at 80°C for 30 minutes, for antigen retrieval. After cooling, sections were incubated in 2% nonfat dry milk for 30 minutes and then in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 20 minutes. Blocking of unspecific sites was done by incubation in 0.2% gelatin, 2% goat serum in PBS, at room temperature for 2 hours. Primary antibodies were incubated at 4°C overnight. The following antibodies were used: anti-CalbindinD-28K (rabbit polyclonal, 1:2000 Swant CB-38a, Marly, Switzerland and mouse monoclonal 1:1000 Sigma-Aldrich (clone CB-955), Munich, Germany), anti-Merlin (rabbit polyclonal antibody, A-19 (sc-331) and C-18 (sc-332), 1:50; Santa Cruz, Heidelberg, Germany), anti-Olig2 (mouse monoclonal antibody, 1:500; Millipore (AB9610), Darmstadt, Germany), anti-MBP (mouse monoclonal antibody, 1:500; Chemikon (MAB384), Schwalbach, Germany). After three PBS washes, sections were incubated in the secondary antibody solution (Alexa Fluor 488 and 546 conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies A-11001, A-11008, A-10036, A-10040, 1:500, Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany) at room temperature for 2 hours. After PBS washing, sections were embedded in Mowiol. Cell culture OLN93 mouse oligodendrocyte cell line was kindly provided by Dr. C. Richter-Landsberg (Oldenburg University, Germany). This permanent cell line is derived from spontaneous transformation of rat glial cultures and represents typical oligodendrocyte protein expression such as myelin basic protein, myelin associated protein [ 33 ] and Olig-2 (as shown here). SC4-immortalized  Nf2 -/-  primary Schwann cells were derived from Nf2 -/-  deficient mice [ 19 , 34 ]. They thus contain a  Nf2  gene missing exon 2 and 3 which results in an unstable and, if at all, truncated and non-functional protein version [ 35 , 19 ]. The RT4-D6PT2 schwannoma cell line was obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures (Salisbury, United Kingdom). This cell line was originally derived from a N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) induced rat peripheral neurotumor and was used as a model cell line for Schwannoma [ 36 , 37 ]. The TC620 human oligodendroglioma cell line was a gift from Dr. A. Glassmann (Life Science Incubators, EPN-Technology, Germany). TC620 cells were cultured from human oligodendroglioma tissue and show oligodendroglial like ganglioside expression levels and pattern [ 38 , 39 ]. All cell lines were maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FCS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The extraction of primary oligodendrocytes (CG4) was performed according to the protocol of Bottenstein and Sato, 1979, modified by Louis et al., 1992 [ 40 , 41 ]. Briefly, cells were harvested by dissecting 4–6 forebrains from newborn heterozygous NG2-EYFP mice [ 32 ]. Animals were decapitated, the hemispheres dissected and dissociated in 0.25% trypsin-EDTA. The cell suspension was plated on poly-L-lysine (PLL) coated dishes, using standard DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. After one week of incubation, the cultured primary oligodendrocytes were rinsed off from the underlying astrocyte layer and plated on fibronectin-PLL-coated dishes filled with N1-medium containing glutamate (2 mM), transferrin (50 μg/ml), insulin (5 μg/ml), putrescine (100 μM), progesterone (20 nM), selenium (30 nM), biotin (10 ng/ml), Pen/Strep (100x) dissolved in DMEM and supplemented with a conditioned supernatant of B104 neuroblastoma cells. After a further 5 days of incubation, cultured primary oligodendrocytes were fixed or harvested for Western blot. All reagents were obtained from Life Technologies (Darmstadt, Germany) or Sigma-Aldrich (Munich, Germany). Immunocytochemistry For immunocytochemistry, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 minutes at 37°C. Plates used for Ki67 stainings were then incubated in 10 mM Na-citrate (pH 9.5) at 80°C for antigen retrieval. All cultures were then processed the same way: they were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 3 minutes, non-specific antibody binding sites were blocked using a mixture of 1% bovine serum albumin and 10% goat serum for two hours, incubations with the primary antibodies were done in blocking solution at 4°C, and carried out overnight. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-Merlin (clone A-19 and C-18, 1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany; or HPA003097, 1:100, Atlas Antibodies, Bromma, Sweden), anti-Olig2 (1:500; Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), anti-GFP (A11122, 1:500, Thermo Fisher, Schwerte, Germany), anti Ki67 (15580, 1:500, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and anti phospho-Histone H3 (pH3-Ser10, 06–570, 1:1000, Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). After extensive rinsing in PBS, cells were incubated with goat anti mouse or anti rabbit secondary antibodies linked to Alexa Fluor-488 and 546 (1:500; Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany) for 1 hour. Afterwards, cells were washed in PBS and counterstained with DRAQ 5 (1:1000 in PBS, Biostatus, UK), or phalloidin conjugated to Alexa 546 (1:100 in PBS, Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany) and Hoechst 34580 (1μg/ml in PBS, Invitrogen) for 20 min. Slides were mounted in Mowiol. Quantification of proliferating cells Proliferation of oligodendroglial cells was analyzed in 24 well plates in which cells were seeded at a concentration of 2x10 4  cells per well when cultured for up to 48 hours, and at a density of 1x10 4  cells per well when incubated for more than 48 hours. After seeding, cells were grown for 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours, fixed, stained for Ki67 or pH3 and counterstained with Hoechst 34580. Images were taken with a Leica DMIRE2 inverted microscope equipped with a DFC350 camera using defined imaging parameters for each fluorophore. In order to avoid bias by the experimentators, six images were taken along the diameter of each well only selecting for regions which showed comparable cell densities (subconfluent at the beginning of culturing and confluent after 96 hours in culture). Then background was subtracted in ImageJ using a rolling ball radius of 50 pixels. Frequencies of pixels with intensities larger than 20 (out of 255) were recorded for all images and summed up to get numbers of pixels positive for Ki67 or Hoechst, respectively. Ki67 positive pixels were then related to Hoechst positive pixels and thus serves as a measure of Ki67 expressing cells. Each experiment was done in triplicate. We thus obtained a total of 12 images per time point and cell line. In order to demonstrate a time dependent effect of Merlin overexpression on cell proliferation, we combined data obtained on days two to four and compared them to data obtained at day 1. Equal variances of ratios were demonstrated by Levene’s test. Significance was tested by one-way ANOVA (for day 1) and two-way ANOVA for days 2–4 (ns not significant, *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001). Data analysis was done using R [ 42 ]. Western-blot Subconfluent cell line cultures were trypsinized, washed in PBS and lysed in RIPA (Radio-Immunoprecipitation Assay) buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (Pefabloc, Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany). Protein concentrations were determined with BCA TM  kit (Thermo Scientific, Darmstadt, Germany). Samples were loaded and separated by SDS-PAGE in a 10% polyacrylamide gel, before being transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) with a semidry transfer system (Nova Blot, GE Healthcare, Munich, Germany). Unspecific binding sites on the membrane were blocked with 5% milk resuspended in 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS for two hours. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution and incubated overnight at 4°C (anti-NF2 clone C-18, 1:500, Santa Cruz, Heidelberg, Germany; anti-phospho S518-Merlin 1:1000, and anti-cyclophilin B 1:4000, Abcam, Cambridge, UK). After three 10 minutes’ washes in 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS, membranes were incubated with the secondary antibody diluted in blocking solution for two hours at room temperature (goat anti-mouse or rabbit HRP, 1:8000, Dako, Hamburg, Germany). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using SuperSignal® West Pico chemoluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific, Darmstadt, Germany). Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Optical density measurements of whole bands were performed using the Image J (NIH) Gel analysis plugin. Results were normalized using cyclophilin B. Results are shown as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical analysis was completed using Student t-test, *p < 0.1, **p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001. Reverse transcription PCR analysis Total RNA was isolated from adult mouse brains and from cell lines by homogenization in Trizol (Life Technologies, Darmstadt, Germany). cDNA was synthesized from 1–2 μg of RNA by reverse transcription using Superscript III polymerase (Life Technologies, Darmstadt, Germany), in accordance with the suppliers’ instructions. Merlin isoforms were amplified using the primers listed in  Table 1 . 10.1371/journal.pone.0196726.t001 Table 1 Primer sequences.

The calculated amplicon length is given in base pairs. Cell transfection For stable transfection of Merlin in cell lines, the plasmid pcNf2hflag containing a CMV promoter and a neomycin resistance cassette was used [ 19 ]. An empty vector pcDNA3.1 was used as a control. Cell lines were transfected using Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany), again as per manufacturer´s instructions. For preparation of stable cell lines the neomycin resistant gene of the vectors was used, and cells were selected with Geneticin (G418, 600–1000 μg/ml, Life Technologies, Darmstadt, Germany). Measurement of cell impedance by XCELLigence The microelectronic biosensor  XCELLigence  Real Time Cell Analysis System (RTCA, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) was used to measure the resistance introduced to an electric field by growing cells over time. This is performed by microelectrodes attached to the bottom of the 96 well plates which measure impedance as a dimension-less cell index through the plate, which is proportional to the number and pattern of attached cells. First, the background impedance was measured according to manufacturer´s instructions with 100μl of standard medium. To determine the optimal seeding density of cells on the RTCA system, different cell numbers (5 x 10 3 , 1 x 10 4 , 2 x 10 4 , and 4 x 10 4 ) were plated with 100μl of culture medium. Impedance was measured every 5 minutes during the first 5 hours (adhesion phase) and every 15 minutes for 100 hours (proliferation phase). The impedance was expressed as an instrument intrinsic parameter—the cell Index (CI). Based on the slope of the CI curves obtained and the time when impedance reached maximum values, we have selected 4 x 10 4 
 control- transfected and  Nf2- transfected cells for further experiments. Having measured the impedance curves of these cell lines, we calculated the slope of the curves starting from the minimum CI value after an initial cell adhesion phase, to the maximum of the CI curve. The slopes obtained from growth curves of  control - and  Nf2- transfected cells were compared and significance was evaluated using the non-parametric Wilcoxon Rank test. Experiments were conducted in duplicates or triplicates and repeated at least three times. Measurement of process outgrowth Numbers of processes were counted per cell. Only isolated cells and aggregates with less than four cells were evaluated. Measurements were performed on epifluorescent images using Image J (NIH). Process length was evaluated independent of the aggregate size, starting from the cell surface to the tip of a process. Data are presented as mean ± SEM and analyzed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Significance was set at p < 0.05. P values: * < 0.05, ** < 0.01, *** < 0.001. Scratch assay Cells of various cell lines were plated on poly-L-lysine coated plates at high density, enabling the attainment of confluence overnight. Cell-free regions were generated after cell confluence using a sterile pipette tip. Dying or dead cells were removed by changing culture media. Refilling of the scratched area was followed by time lapse imaging taking images every 60 min during the first 10 hours, then every 30 min during the next ten hours (this applies for OLN93 and TC620 cells) and again every 60 min during hours 20 to 30. Since RT4 cells migrated much faster, images were taken every 10 minutes during the 10 to 20 hour phase. For refilling of scratches the cell-free area was measured at six different spots within a 3 cm well plate every 4 hours up to 24 hours using the ImageJ MRI Wound healing tool. Experiments were repeated four times. Results are shown as mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis was achieved using Two-Way ANOVA and Bonferroni post-hoc-test, *p < 0.1, **p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001. To compare mitotic activity during the initial time frame, cells were fixed after 16 hours of the scratch assay and stained for phospho-Histone H3. The staining procedure was done as described above. As a measure of proliferation, phospho-H3 positive cells were related to the total cell number in an area covering 400 μm next to the edge of the scratch to get the mitotic index. In addition, we used time lapse imaging to track single cells. In each view of the time lapse images, we selected up to ten cells and tracked them from the beginning up to the end of the run. Only those cells were chosen which were not encased by other cells during the first 10 hours, and which ran for at least 25 hours. Dividing cells were included by following the path of only one of the daughter cells. Total lengths of paths were compared by Wilcoxon’s rank test. Microscopy, image acquisition and statistical analysis Confocal images of brain sections were acquired with a Leica TCS SP2 laser scanning microscope using 40x 1,25NA and 63x 1,4NA lenses. Epifluorescent and time lapse images were obtained in a Zeiss Axioskop 2 and Leica DMIRE2, equipped with a DFC350Fx camera. Adobe Photoshop (CS and Elements 15, Adobe Systems) and ImageJ (Fiji 1.51, NIH) were used for digital processing of images (linear adjustments of brightness and contrast). Statistical analysis was performed with R [ 42 ].",Andrea Toledo; Elena Grieger; Khalad Karram; Helen Morrison; Stephan L Baader,PloS one,2018,10.1371/journal.pone.0196726,minimal,True
PMID:19282654,"Tranilast, an anti-allergic drug, down-regulates the growth of cultured neurofibroma cells derived from neurofibromatosis type 1.","Neurofibromas are benign tumors that comprise primarily of Schwann cells and fibroblasts. Mast cells have been found scattered in the tumor tissue, and their role in promoting the proliferation of neurofibroma has been suggested. Tranilast (N-[3,4-dimethoxycinnamolyl]anthranilic acid) is an anti-allergic drug that inhibits release of the chemical mediators from mast cells and it used for the treatment of keloids and hypertrophic scars by its inhibition of growth-promoting transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta(1) from fibroblasts. We assumed that tranilast would suppress neurofibroma cell growth. In order to prove this hypothesis, we investigated the effectiveness of tranilast in inhibiting the tumor growth using a new cell culture system obtained from patients with neurofibromas. We called this culture system with the mixture of Schwann cells and fibroblasts ""NF1 cells culture"". Mast cells were differentiated from CD34(+) peripheral blood mononuclear cells of normal healthy subjects, and were co-cultured with NF1 cells. Three days after tranilast (10 approximately 100 microM) added to the culture dishes, we counted viable cell numbers and measured the concentrations of TGF-beta(1), stem cell factor (SCF) and tryptase, which exists in the histamine granule, in the culture medium. Tranilast significantly suppressed proliferation of the NF1 cells and lowered the levels of TGF-beta(1), SCF and tryptase. These results suggest that tranilast retards tumor proliferation through not only suppression of cell growth factor, but also the inhibition of a chemical mediator released from mast cells. Thus, tranilast can be a potent therapeutic agent to inhibit the growth of neurofibromas.",,Misa Yamamoto; Toshihiko Yamauchi; Kozue Okano; Mutsuo Takahashi; Shoji Watabe; Yoshimi Yamamoto,The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,2009-03,10.1620/tjem.217.193,abstract_only,False
PMID:7485407,NF2 gene analysis distinguishes hemangiopericytoma from meningioma.,"The histogenesis of dural-based or ""central"" hemangiopericytomas (cHPCs) remains controversial. Some authors consider these tumors variants of meningiomas while others consider them akin to peripheral hemangiopericytomas (pHPCs). Meningiomas frequently have mutations in the neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) gene, providing a molecular marker for meningiomas and other NF2-related tumors. We therefore analyzed the NF2 gene in cHPCs, pHPCs, and meningiomas to determine whether cHPCs are more similar at the molecular genetic level to meningiomas or pHPCs. Using paraffin-embedded archival material from 28 cHPCs (including three primary and recurrent tumors), 10 pHPCs, and 26 meningiomas, we scanned all 17 exons of the NF2 gene and flanking intronic sequences for mutations with single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing. No NF2 mutations were found in either cHPCs or pHPCs, whereas 35% of meningiomas had NF2 gene alterations (P < 0.001). The NF2 gene mutations in meningiomas were all truncating mutations, consistent with previous studies. Our findings suggest that cHPCs are distinct from meningiomas at the molecular genetic level and support prior clinico-pathological data that distinguish these tumor-entities.",,J T Joseph; D K Lisle; L B Jacoby; W Paulus; R Barone; M L Cohen; W H Roggendorf; J M Bruner; J F Gusella; D N Louis,The American journal of pathology,1995-11,,abstract_only,False
PMID:7818486,Activation of Ito cells involves regulation of AP-1 binding proteins and induction of type I collagen gene expression.,"Activation of liver Ito cells is characterized by increased proliferation, fibrogenesis, loss of cellular retinoid and change of cell-shape. Here, we have described fundamental differences between freshly isolated Ito cells (FIC) and long-term cultured Ito cells (LTIC). This process of activation correlates with the absence of expression of Pro alpha 1(I) gene in FIC. LTIC expressed abundant transcripts of Pro alpha 1(I) gene. Nuclear run-off experiments showed the inability of FIC to support Pro alpha 1(I) RNA transcription while LTIC transcribed it greater than 5-fold as compared with FIC. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta)-treated LTIC had a preferential increase in the rate of Pro alpha 1(I) gene transcription as compared with control LTIC. A human collagen type I promoter-enhancer construct (pCOL-KT) [Thompson, Simkevich, Holness, Kang and Raghow (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 2549-2556] was readily expressed in LTIC but failed to be expressed in FIC. Furthermore, TGF beta treatment of LTIC resulted in an increased expression of pCOL-KT. The deletion of an activator protein-1 (AP-1) binding site (+598 to +604) in the 360 bp enhancer region of pCOL-KT (S360) caused decreased expression of the CAT reporter gene, suggesting that this bonafide AP-1 site can, at least in part, mediate the transactivation effect of TGF beta. Using DNAase I protection, we demonstrate a single foot-print located at +590 to +625 in the S360 fragment; nuclear extracts prepared from TGF beta-treated LTIC exhibited greater activity of these AP-1 binding proteins. Gel mobility assays corroborated and extended the footprinting observation. No AP-1-binding activity was found in the nuclear extracts of FIC. Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the consensus AP-1 motif were able to compete out the binding; consensus NF-1 motif oligonucleotides failed to do so. The preincubation of nuclear extracts from control and TGF beta-treated LTIC with antibodies against c-jun and c-fos rendered a reduced binding of AP-1 proteins to the target S360 fragment.",,J Armendariz-Borunda; C P Simkevich; N Roy; R Raghow; A H Kang; J M Seyer,The Biochemical journal,1994-12-15,10.1042/bj3040817,abstract_only,False
PMID:24509877,MAF mediates crosstalk between Ras-MAPK and mTOR signaling in NF1.,"Mutations in the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor gene are common in cancer and can cause resistance to therapy. Using transcriptome analysis we identified MAF as an NF1- regulated transcription factor and verified MAF regulation through RAS/MAPK/AP-1 signaling in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) cell lines. MAF was also downregulated in human MPNST. Acute re-expression of MAF promoted expression of glial differentiation markers in MPNST cells in vitro, decreased self-renewal of embryonic precursors and transiently affected tumor cell phenotypes in vitro by increasing MPNST cell death and reducing metabolic activity and anchorage-independent growth. Paradoxically, chronic MAF overexpression enhanced MPNST cell tumor growth in vivo, correlating with elevated pS6 in vitro and in vivo. RAD001 blocked MAF-mediated tumor growth, and MAF regulated the mTOR pathway through DEPTOR. MAPK inhibition with NF1 loss of function is predicted to show limited efficacy due to reactivation of mTOR signaling via MAF.","Materials & Methods Microarray analyses Collection of samples, RNA isolation, probe generation, Affymetrix HU133 Plus 2.0 microarray hybridization and data normalization were described ( 24 ). To compare MPNST cells infected with adenovirus, we normalized gene expression to average expression in three independent NHSC samples. Statistical analyses (analysis of variance; FDR=0.001) identified gene expression changes between uninfected MPNST cells, MPNST cells infected with control (GFP) virus and MPNST cells infected with NF1-GRD virus as described ( 33 ). Cell culture Normal human Schwann cells (NHSC) from trauma victims and MPNST cell lines were cultured as described ( 24 ). For cells transduced with doxycycline inducible lentivirus, we used certified Tet-free FBS (Hyclone). Viral Infection For microarray analysis, MPNST cells were infected with purified Ad-NF1-GRD or control Ad-GFP, in triplicate, for 2 h in serum-free medium at 200pfu/cell. Viruses were removed and cells cultured in normal medium for 30h, then RNA isolated for analysis of gene expression by RT–PCR analysis as described ( 24 ). MPNST cells were transduced with lentiviral particles at 70 – 90% confluence. Constitutive expression used mCherry tagged MAF (EX-Y2046-Lv111, GeneCopoeia) and mCherry control lentivirus. Inducible expression used lentiviral vectors containing the MAF ORF or empty pLVX-Tight-Puro vector (GeneCopoeia) in a modified pTight backbone (Clonetech) with pLVX-Tet-On doxycycline inducible vector (Clonetech). CCHMC Viral Vector Core produced virus with 4-plasmid packaging  http://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/research/div/exphematology/translational/vpf/vvc/default.htm . Lentiviral particles were incubated with MPNST cells (MOI of 10) in 8 µg/mL polybrene (Sigma) for 24h followed by selection in 2 µg/mL puromycin, which killed uninfected cells within three days. Luciferase reporter assays MPNST cells (5×10 4 / well) in 96-well plates were serum starved (0.1 % FBS) overnight. Cells were transfected using FuGENE HD (Roche) with 100ng per well of an AP-1 luciferase (Stratagene) reporter vector, 5ng of a renilla luciferase reference control, and 50ng of plasmid DNA expressing full length NF1, N-term and C-term constructs lacking the GRD (gifts of Frank McCormick), RasN17, the GRD, RasV12, aFos, and empty control ( 49 ). Cells were stimulated in 10% FBS for 24 h and lysed for luciferase assay (Promega). The MAF reporter was described ( 37 ). Realtime-PCR Total RNA was isolated from cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and used as a template for cDNA synthesis (ABI High capacity archive kit) and RT-PCR (ABI 7500 Sequence Detection System) as described ( 24 ). Data were normalized to β-Actin or Gapdh. Human primers included: MAF f-cgagtgggctcagttatgaa and r-cgagtgggctcagttatgaa, SOX9 f-gtaatccgggtggtccttct and r-gacgctgggcaagctct, S100β f-tccacaacctcctgctcttt and r-ggagacaagcacaagctgaa, MBP f-ggagccgtagtgagcagttc and r-gagccctctgccctctcat, BLBP f-aacagcaaccacatcaccaa and r-acagaaatgggatggcaaag, DEPTOR f-cgacaaaacagtttgggtagg and r-atggctgaggtcttggtcac, β-Actin f-gttgtcgacgacgagcg and r-gcacagagcctcgcctt. Mouse primers included: Maf f-tctcctgcttgaggtggtct and r-aaggaggaggtgatccgact, Sox9 f-tccacgaagggtctcttctc and r-aggaagctggcagaccagta, Gapdh f-ttgatggcaacaatctccac and r-cgtcccgtagacaaaatggt. Immunocytochemistry Cultured cells were fixed, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X 100 and blocked with 10% normal serum for 1h at room temperature ( 19 ). Primary antibodies used were S100β (Dako), MBP (Chemicon), and BLBP (Millipore). Secondary incubations used host-appropriate TRITC conjugated antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch). Nuclei were labeled with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich) and microscopic images acquired with ImageJ software (NIH) on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M. Tumor paraffin sections stained for MAF (Imgenex), pS6, pERK (Cell Signaling), and DEPTOR (Novus) were visualized with DAB. Immunoblot Cell lysates were created and Western blotting conducted as described ( 24 ), blocking without detergent. Membranes were probed with antibodies for MAF (Imgenex), SOX9 (Santa Cruz), S100β (Dako), MBP (Chemicon), BLBP (Millipore), DEPTOR (Novus), cleaved-caspase 3, pS6, S6, p4E-BP1, 4E-BP1, p473AKT, AKT, and β-ACTIN (Cell Signaling) as a loading control. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (BioRad) were used with ECL Plus developing system (Amersham Biosciences). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) MPNST 88-14 cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 minutes on ice. Glycine was added to 0.125 M. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and washed 3X with ice-cold PBS with 1× Complete inhibitor (Roche). Cells were lysed 1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1× Complete inhibitor. A Bioruptor generated soluble chromatin (Cosmo Bio USA, Carlsbad, CA) with DNA fragment sizes of 200 to 800 bp. We precleared cell lysates with protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz). Anti-MAF (Imgenex) and control mouse IgG (Santa Cruz) immunoprecipitated chromatin-protein complexes, and cross-linking reversed with 0.3 M NaCl at 65°C for 12 hours. RNaseA and proteinase K were added for 1h at 37°C. We purified DNA fragments with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Input chromatin was used as a positive control in RT-PCR with the primers: GPH1005991(-)01A for MAF binding sites on SOX9 promoter and GPH100001C(-)01A for a chromosome 12 promoter desert as a negative control (SABiosciences). Sphere progenitor and Schwann cell culture DRG from E12.5–13.5 embryos were dissociated with 0.25% Trypsin (Mediatech) for 20 min. at 37°C; single-cell suspensions were obtained with a narrow-bore pipette and 40 µm strainer (BD-Falcon). Live cells (500/well) in 24-well plates in sphere medium were counted after 7 days as described ( 19 ). To passage, spheres were pelleted, treated with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA for 3 minutes, dissociated, and plated at clonal density. Schwann cells were derived from DRG single cell suspensions as described ( 19 ). MTS assay Transduced MPNST cells (500 cells/well) were seeded in triplicate and incubated overnight in 96-well plates in the presence or absence of puromycin (2µg/ml). Doxycycline, RAD001, PD0325901 or selection media was added the next day and subsequently daily. Absorbance was read day 4 post-infection or doxycycline induction using the CellTiter 96® Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega). Flow cytometry Approximately 100,000 MPNST cells transduced with MAF or vector control were induced with doxycycline for 24h and fixed in 0.5% paraformaldehyde. Cells were stained with propidium iodide and annexin according to Apoptosis kit instructions (Invitrogen). Flow cytometry was performed on a FACSCanto (Becton Dickinson) and analyzed using FlowJo software. Soft agar Agar (6% in DMEM, 10% FBS) was plated in 35 mm dishes. 5x10 3  MPNST cells were mixed with 3.6% agar and overlaid on solidified agar. Cells were cultured at 37°C in 7.5% CO 2  in puromycin or doxycycline. Colonies were counted after 10 days. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Mouse xenograft Mouse xenografts of NF1 patient derived MPNST cells were conducted as described ( 13 ). 1.5 ×10 6  MPNST S462-TY cells suspended in Matrigel (BD) and expressing pLVX control or inducible-MAF were injected subcutaneously into the right flanks of 6 to 8-week-old female athymic nude (nu/nu) mice (Harlan). Mice were maintained on 2000 ppm doxycycline feed. Tumor volumes were measured twice weekly and mice were sacrificed before tumor volume reached 10% of total body weight.",M E Brundage; P Tandon; D W Eaves; J P Williams; S J Miller; R H Hennigan; A Jegga; T P Cripe; N Ratner,Oncogene,2014-12-04,10.1038/onc.2013.506,minimal,True
PMID:22942771,Secretome survey of human plexiform neurofibroma derived Schwann Cells reveals a secreted form of the RARRES1 protein.,"To bring insights into neurofibroma biochemistry, a comprehensive secretome analysis was performed on cultured human primary Schwann cells isolated from surgically resected plexiform neurofibroma and from normal nerve tissue. Using a combination of SDS-PAGE and high precision LC-MS/MS, 907 proteins were confidently identified in the conditioned media of Schwann cell cultures combined. Label free proteome profiling revealed consistent release of high levels of 22 proteins by the four biological replicates of NF1 Schwann cell cultures relative to the two normal Schwann cell cultures. Inversely, 9 proteins displayed decreased levels in the conditioned media of NF1 relative to normal Schwann cells. The proteins with increased levels included proteins involved in cell growth, angiogenesis and complement pathway while proteins with decreased levels included those involved in cell adhesion, plasminogen pathway and extracellular matrix remodeling. Retinoic acid receptor responder protein-1 (RARRES1), previously described as an integral membrane tumor suppressor, was found exclusively secreted by NF1 Schwann cells but not by normal Schwann cells. All-trans retinoic acid modulated secretion of RARRES1 in a dose dependent manner. This study shows altered secretion of key proteins in NF1 derived Schwann cells. The potential implication of these proteins in neurofibroma biology is discussed.",,Hui-Ling Chen; Haeri Seol; Kristy Jean Brown; Heather Gordish-Dressman; Ashley Hill; Vittorio Gallo; Roger Packer; Yetrib Hathout,International journal of molecular sciences,2012,10.3390/ijms13079380,abstract_only,False
PMID:24506781,Exon-skipping antisense oligonucleotides to correct missplicing in neurogenetic diseases.,"Alternative splicing is an important regulator of the transcriptome. However, mutations may cause alteration of splicing patterns, which in turn leads to disease. During the past 10 years, exon skipping has been looked upon as a powerful tool for correction of missplicing in disease and progress has been made towards clinical trials. In this review, we discuss the use of antisense oligonucleotides to correct splicing defects through exon skipping, with a special focus on diseases affecting the nervous system, and the latest stage achieved in its progress.",,Kavitha Siva; Giuseppina Covello; Michela A Denti,Nucleic acid therapeutics,2014-02,10.1089/nat.2013.0461,abstract_only,False
PMID:33767727,Molecular Diagnosis of Neurofibromatosis by Multigene Panel Testing.,"Neurofibromatosis (NF) is an autosomal genetic disorder for which early and definite clinical diagnoses are difficult. To identify the diagnosis, five affected probands with suspected NF from unrelated families were included in this study. Molecular analysis was performed using multigene panel testing and Sanger sequencing. Ultradeep sequencing was used to analyze the mutation rate in the tissues from the proband with mosaic mutations. Three different pathogenic variants of the ","Materials and Methods Study Subjects Five probands suspected of having NF and nine relatives were from the outpatient department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University. Clinical samples were collected, including peripheral blood, skin lesions, hair, oral mucosa, and cutaneous tissue. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of our hospital. Informed consent was obtained from all participants or their guardians for the collection of data and samples. The samples collected from the probands’ families are shown in  Supplementary Table 1 . There were six patients in five families ( Supplementary Figure 1 ). Three probands, including a 3-year-old girl (III-1) from family 1, a 2-year-old girl (II-1) from family 2, and a 2.8-year-old boy (II-1) from family 3, presented with scattered CALMs throughout the body ( Figures 1A,C,D ), and the father (III-1) of the proband from family 1 exhibited CALMs in the trunk area ( Figure 1B ). These patients were born with CALMs that gradually increased with age. These patients showed no other abnormalities. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) ( Supplementary Figure 2A ) and dermoscopy ( Supplementary Figure 2B ) of the probands from family 2 and family 3 revealed significantly increased pigment contents in the stratum basal and regular sepia grid-like pigmentation with clear boundaries. FIGURE 1 Clinical features of the patients with neurofibromatosis (NF). Multiple cafeÌ-au-lait macules were scattered on the left lateral chest of the proband  (A)  and the back of the proband’s father in family 1  (B) , the back of the proband in family 2  (C) , and the right side of the face of the proband in family 3  (D) .  (E)  Cutaneous neurofibroma on the back of the proband in family 4.  (F)  Skin pigmented plaques on the left foot back of the proband in family 5. A 62-year-old man in family 4 (II-4) presented with cutaneous neurofibromas of the left back, chest, and abdomen at the age of 58 years ( Figure 1E ). No other abnormalities were found. Histological evaluation of the cutaneous neurofibromas showed a large and isolated tumoral nodule that presented wavy spindle cell changes ( Supplementary Figures 3A,D ). Immunohistochemical analysis showed scattered S100 positivity in tumor cell nuclei ( Supplementary Figures 3C,F ) and strong and diffuse CD34 positivity in the tumor cell cytoplasm ( Supplementary Figures 3B,E ). No abnormalities were found in the rest of the family members. A 4-year-old female proband in family 5 (II-1) mainly presented with skin plaques, amblyopia in her right eye, and an intracranial neurogenic tumor by MRI. The skin plaque was present on her right foot when she was born and developed into six skin lesions as she grew up ( Figure 1F ). These lesions were distributed in the trunk area, left hip, right calf front knee, right ankle, and left foot back and consisted of well-circumscribed and slightly pigmented plaques. There were no obvious differences in learning ability and intelligence between her and her peers during her growth. Cranial MRI examination showed an intracranial neurogenic tumor located in the cerebellum medulla oblongata pool of the right side. Histological evaluation of the skin plaques showed multiple nodules forming well-circumscribed interconnected masses of different sizes ( Supplementary Figure 4A ). These multiple nodules presented swirly spindle cell changes ( Supplementary Figure 4D ). Immunohistochemical analysis showed strong and diffuse S100 positivity in the tumor cell nuclei ( Supplementary Figures 4C,F ) and weak and scattered CD34 positivity in the tumor cell cytoplasm ( Supplementary Figures 4B,E ). Other family members did not show similar symptoms. All clinical manifestations in the NF families are shown in  Table 1 . TABLE 1 Clinical characteristics of the neurofibromatosis proband study.

DNA Isolation of Samples Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood, skin lesions, hair, oral mucosa, and tumor tissues separately using the AxyPrep Blood Genomic DNA Miniprep Kit (Axygen, Corning, Jiangsu, China) and DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Germany). The DNA purity was determined using a NanoDrop one spectrophotometer and quantified with a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. DNA samples were then preserved at −20°C for further experiments. Multigene Panel Testing To explore the genetic properties of the patients, the capture probe from the Roche NimbleGen Sequence Capture SeqCap EZ Library was used to capture a total of 569 genes associated with hereditary dermatosis. Firstly, DNA was cropped into approximately 300-bp fragments using focused ultrasonicators (Covaris M220, United States) and used to construct the DNA library. Then, streptavidin-coated magnetic beads by NimbleGen (Roche NimbleGen, Inc.) were bound to an avidin-labeled probe after the probe had captured the target exons. Next, a hybridization reaction between the DNA library with various index marks and probes with biotin was performed. After linear PCR amplification, the quality of the library was determined. Sequencing was carried out on an Illumina HiSeq X Ten System (Illumina, San Diego, CA, United States) under sequencing efficiency with an average sequencing depth > 200× and Q30 > 90% according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA from all of the probands’ blood samples and tumor tissues from the proband in family 4 were subjected to multigene panel testing. Sanger Sequencing Sanger sequencing was used to confirm the mutations found by multigene panel testing, which were analyzed to determine whether the variants co-segregated with the disease phenotype in their families. Primers were designed based on the mutation sites found using Primer 3.0. An ABI PRISM 3730XL analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, United States) was used for Sanger sequencing. The DNA from blood samples of all the probands and their relatives was assessed separately, and the mutation sites of the genes were detected by multigene panel testing. Ultradeep Sequencing When multigene panel testing could detect mutations in the probands’ tumor tissues but not in the peripheral blood, ultradeep sequencing was applied to determine the mutation percentage in the peripheral blood, skin lesions, hair, oral mucosa, and tumor tissues. This was performed using the Illumina HiSeq X Ten System (Illumina, San Diego, CA, United States) after DNA quantification and library quality control. The variant allele frequency (VAF) was defined as the number of reads that mapped to whole exons of causal genes, including untranslated and splicing regions. A mutation was considered present when the mutation site VAF was >1.0%.",Zeng-Yun-Ou Zhang; Yuan-Yuan Wu; Xin-Ying Cai; Wen-Liang Fang; Feng-Li Xiao,Frontiers in genetics,2021,10.3389/fgene.2021.603195,minimal,True
PMID:36127120,Cohort profile: life with neurofibromatosis 1 - the Danish NF1 cohort.,"PURPOSE: The Danish neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) cohort was initiated to study health-related, socioeconomic and psychological consequences of living with the monogenetic disorder NF1 using a nationwide and population-based approach. PARTICIPANTS: The cohort includes all 2467 individuals in Denmark who were hospitalised with or due to NF1 from 1977 to 2013 or registered in the RAREDIS Database (1995-2013), a national clinical database for rare diseases, or both. A comparison cohort matched to individuals with NF1 on sex and date of birth was identified in the Civil Registration System (n=20 132). FINDINGS TO DATE: All cohort members were linked to the unique Danish registries to obtain information on hospital contacts, birth outcomes, education and partnership. A questionnaire was completed by 244 of the 629 adult cohort members with NF1 registered in the RAREDIS Database to evaluate the psychosocial and emotional burden. Further, neuropsychological tests were performed on 103 adult cohort members with NF1 and 38 adult population comparisons. To date, six studies have been published. Individuals with NF1 had an increased risk for (1) hospitalisation for disorders affecting all organ systems of the body throughout all decades of life, (2) psychiatric disorders, (3) attaining a short or medium long education and (4) not forming a life partner. Women with NF1 had an increased risk for spontaneous abortions and stillbirths. Finally, adults with NF1 had an impaired quality of life and a high need for professional support for physical, psychological and work-related problems, which was partly associated with disease severity and visibility. FUTURE PLANS: The cohort will regularly be updated with newly diagnosed patients in the RAREDIS Database as well as with outcome information in the Danish registries. New studies are in progress to assess other medical and socioeconomic dimensions of living with NF1.",,Karoline Doser; Hanne Hove; John R Østergaard; Pernille E Bidstrup; Susanne O Dalton; Mette Møller Handrup; Cecilie Ejerskov; Anja Krøyer; Mia Aagaard Doherty; Jens Richardt Møllegaard Jepsen; John J Mulvihill; Jeanette F Winther; Line Kenborg,BMJ open,2022-09-20,10.1136/bmjopen-2022-065340,abstract_only,False
PMID:23328114,Genomic imbalance of HMMR/RHAMM regulates the sensitivity and response of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour cells to aurora kinase inhibition.,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNST) are rare, hereditary cancers associated with neurofibromatosis type I. MPNSTs lack effective treatment options as they often resist chemotherapies and have high rates of disease recurrence. Aurora kinase A (AURKA) is an emerging target in cancer and an aurora kinase inhibitor (AKI), termed MLN8237, shows promise against MPNST cell lines in vitro and in vivo. Here, we test MLN8237 against two primary human MPNST grown in vivo as xenotransplants and find that treatment results in tumour cells exiting the cell cycle and undergoing endoreduplication, which cumulates in stabilized disease. Targeted therapies can often fail in the clinic due to insufficient knowledge about factors that determine tumour susceptibilities, so we turned to three MPNST cell-lines to further study and modulate the cellular responses to AKI. We find that the sensitivity of cell-lines with amplification of AURKA depends upon the activity of the kinase, which correlates with the expression of the regulatory gene products TPX2 and HMMR/RHAMM. Silencing of HMMR/RHAMM, but not TPX2, augments AURKA activity and sensitizes MPNST cells to AKI. Furthermore, we find that AURKA activity is critical to the propagation and self-renewal of sphere-enriched MPNST cancer stem-like cells. AKI treatment significantly reduces the formation of spheroids, attenuates the self-renewal of spheroid forming cells, and promotes their differentiation. Moreover, silencing of HMMR/RHAMM is sufficient to endow MPNST cells with an ability to form and maintain sphere culture. Collectively, our data indicate that AURKA is a rationale therapeutic target for MPNST and tumour cell responses to AKI, which include differentiation, are modulated by the abundance of HMMR/RHAMM.","MATERIALS AND METHODS In vivo  animal models Four-month-old male  NOD/SCID  mice were anesthetized with isofluorane and orthotopically implanted with 1 mm 3  piece of explant tumour in both legs, near the sciatic nerve (Castellsagué et al. manuscript under preparation). Tumour volume was calculated at V= (W 2 *L (π/6)), where L is the longest diameter and W is the width. Mice were randomly assigned to treatment or control groups. Dosage of MLN8237 in mice was previously determined (31). Mice were treated by gavage once daily with 30mg/kg MLN8237 or vehicle (10% 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin and 1% sodium bicarbonate) for 28 days. Tumours were measured every 3 days. At the end of the treatment period, mice were euthanized and harvested tumours were fixed in formalin. Adherent culture and culture as spheres Cell-lines were obtained from Drs. VF Mautner and L Kluwe (University Hospital Eppendorf, Germany) or the ATCC and were cultured as recommended. Unless noted otherwise, cells were seeded at 1.0 × 10 4  (S462 cell-line) or 3.0 × 10 4  (2884 and 2885 cell-lines) cells/well in 24-well culture plates and allowed to adhere for 24 hours prior to the denoted treatment. These seeding densities resulted in equivalent growth kinetics for S462 and 2884 cells. The culture of S462 spheres followed the protocol in [ 22 ]. siRNA and small molecule reagents siRNA (Qiagen,  Table S1 ) were transfected at 10 pmol/well using Lipofectamine2000™ according to manufacturer's protocols (Invitrogen). AURKA knockdown was confirmed at 48 hours post transfection. Small-molecule AKIs were dissolved and diluted in DMSO/DMEM and included the pan-aurora inhibitors C1368 (Sigma) and VX680 (Selleck Chemicals), and the AURKA specific inhibitor MLN8237 (Selleck Chemicals). Lentivirus mediated shRNA knockdown and generation of sub-lines Lentivirus packaging, envelope and control non-hairpin (NHP) pLKO.1 plasmids (Addgene) were used with shRNA against RHAMM and TPX2 (Sigma) as described in [ 11 ] ( Table S1 ). Transfected cells were selected with 0.5μg/ml puromycin (GIBCO) and maintained with 0.3μg/ml puromycin. Immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and immunoblot analyses Antibodies were sourced as follows: RHAMM (Epitomics), TPX2 (Novus), nestin (Covance), Tuj1 (Covance), β-actin (Sigma), AURKA, phospho (p)-AURKA (Thr288), p-histone H3 (Ser10), and caspase 9 (Cell Signalling). The p-RHAMM (Thr703) polyclonal antibody is characterized in [ 11 ]. Cell-lines were fixed and permeabilized in methanol. Antibodies were diluted in PBS-0.1% Tween and 3% BSA (Sigma). Coverslips were mounted in 90% glycerol/PBS with DAPI (Invitrogen) and images were acquired and analyzed using an Olympus FV10i confocal microscope. For immunofluorescence of spheres, coverslips were coated with 2% geltrex (Invitrogen) in Neurocult media (StemCell Technologies) before cells were plated. Cells were fixed with 4% PFA and then stained. Immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections was done as in [ 11 ]. Secondary antibody staining was done with the relevant antibodies for 30 minutes at room temperature. Staining was visualized by 3,3-diaminobenzidine, with Hematoxylin as a counter-stain. Western blot analyses were performed on lysates collected from sub-confluent MPNST cells lysed in modified RIPA buffer, as described [ 39 ]. Levels of protein were detected and quantified with the Odyssey infra-red imaging system (LI-COR) using IRDye 800- or IRDye 680-conjugated secondary antibodies (Rockland) or through chemiluminescence detection of HRP-conjugated antibodies (Sigma). Genomic and reverse-transcriptase PCR and real-time PCR Genomic DNA was extracted with the DNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen) and preparations were measured with a NanoDrop (Thermo-Fisher). For real-time, genomic PCR, reactions were run in triplicate with an Applied Biosystems 7000 series machine (Invitrogen). RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen), quantified with NanoDrop and converted to cDNA using AccessQuick (VWR) as per manufacturer's protocols. For primers and PCR conditions see  Table S1 . Results were analyzed using the ΔΔCt method. Expression of transcript/gene was normalized to TATA box binding protein levels, which was then normalized to levels of transcript/gene in 2885 cells. Array comparative genomic hybridization (a-CGH) Genomic DNA was isolated using the Gentra Puregene Cell Kit (Qiagen). Purified DNA was digested with Bovine DNase I (Ambion). Test and control samples were labelled with Alexa5 and Alexa3 dyes respectively using the BioPrime Total Genomic Labeling Kit (Invitrogen). Labeled samples were competitively hybridized to 2 × 400k Human CGH Arrays (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by the manufacturer. Copy number estimates were extracted from the microarray image files using Feature Extraction 10.5 (Agilent) and the data were analyzed in Agilent Genomic Workbench 6.5 (Agilent) after centralization and fuzzy zero normalization matrixes were applied. Copy number abnormalities were identified using the ADM-2 algorithm with a threshold setting of 5.5 and regions were only considered significant if they were defined by a minimum of 3 probes and the average log 2  value exceeded a threshold of 0.2 (grey shaded regions). Cell based assays For cell viability assays, MPNST cell-lines were plated and after 24 hours were treated with carrier alone (0.1% DMSO) or AKIs at indicated concentrations. Viability was quantified after 72 hours by addition of 5 mg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2 H -tetrazolium (MTT, Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Each condition was done in triplicate and repeated three times. For growth curves, MTT assays were conducted at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after plating. For nuclear content analysis by FACS, cells were harvested, fixed and stained as in [ 40 ] and analyzed with FACS Calibur and CellQuestPro software (BD Biosciences), respectively. For polyploidy analysis, AKI treated cells were stained with DAPI. Nuclei area was measured using Image J software. Annexin V (BD Biosciences) staining followed manufacturer's protocol. Images were collected with a High Content Analyzer (ArrayScan VTI, Cellomics). Cellular senescence was measured by detection of senescence-activated β-Galactosidase activity. Cells were plated, treated with AKIs for 72 hours, fixed and stained as described in [ 21 ]. Statistics Statistical significance was evaluated by unpaired two-tailed Student's t-tests with p>0.05. Two way ANOVA was used to determine significance between treatments for  in vivo  tumour volumes using GraphPad Prism.",Pooja Mohan; Joan Castellsague; Jihong Jiang; Kristi Allen; Helen Chen; Oksana Nemirovsky; Melanie Spyra; Kaiji Hu; Lan Kluwe; Miguel Angel Pujana; Alberto Villanueva; Victor F Mautner; Jonathan J Keats; Sandra E Dunn; Conxi Lazaro; Christopher A Maxwell,Oncotarget,2013-01,10.18632/oncotarget.793,minimal,True
PMID:29704429,Insights into optic pathway glioma vision loss from mouse models of neurofibromatosis type 1.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common cancer predisposition syndrome caused by mutations in the NF1 gene. The NF1-encoded protein (neurofibromin) is an inhibitor of the oncoprotein RAS and controls cell growth and survival. Individuals with NF1 are prone to developing low-grade tumors of the optic nerves, chiasm, tracts, and radiations, termed optic pathway gliomas (OPGs), which can cause vision loss. A paucity of surgical tumor specimens and of patient-derived xenografts for investigative studies has limited our understanding of human NF1-associated OPG (NF1-OPG). However, mice genetically engineered to harbor Nf1 gene mutations develop optic gliomas that share many features of their human counterparts. These genetically engineered mouse (GEM) strains have provided important insights into the cellular and molecular determinants that underlie mouse Nf1 optic glioma development, maintenance, and associated vision loss, with relevance by extension to human NF1-OPG disease. Herein, we review our current understanding of NF1-OPG pathobiology and describe the mechanisms responsible for tumor initiation, growth, and associated vision loss in Nf1 GEM models. We also discuss how Nf1 GEM and other preclinical models can be deployed to identify and evaluate molecularly targeted therapies for OPG, particularly as they pertain to future strategies aimed at preventing or improving tumor-associated vision loss in children with NF1.",,Morgan E Freret; David H Gutmann,Journal of neuroscience research,2019-01,10.1002/jnr.24250,abstract_only,False
PMID:4371739,Tumours of the nervous system.,"Tumours of the nervous system of animals are not as rare as has been commonly believed. In dogs, especially the brachycephalic breeds, these tumours occur as frequently as in man. The tumours are grouped according to tissue of origin as follows: nerve cells, neuroepithelium, glia, peripheral nerves and nerve sheaths, meninges and vessels, the pineal and pituitary glands, and the craniopharyngeal duct. Tumours of the glia are relatively common and are divided into the following types: astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, glioblastoma, spongioblastoma, medulloblastoma, and unclassified gliomas.",,R Fankhauser; H Luginbühl; J T McGrath,Bulletin of the World Health Organization,1974,,abstract_only,False
PMID:21551250,Susceptible stages in Schwann cells for NF1-associated plexiform neurofibroma development.,"Stem cells are under strict regulation by both intrinsic factors and the microenvironment. There is increasing evidence that many cancers initiate through acquisition of genetic mutations (loss of intrinsic control) in stem cells or their progenitors, followed by alterations of the surrounding microenvironment (loss of extrinsic control). In neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), deregulation of Ras signaling results in development of multiple neurofibromas, complex tumors of the peripheral nerves. Neurofibromas arise from the Schwann cell lineage following loss of function at the NF1 locus, which initiates a cascade of interactions with other cell types in the microenvironment and additional cell autonomous modifications. In this study, we sought to identify whether a temporal ""window of opportunity"" exists during which cells of the Schwann cell lineage can give rise to neurofibromas following loss of NF1. We showed that acute loss of NF1 in both embryonic and adult Schwann cells can lead to neurofibroma formation. However, the embryonic period when Schwann cell precursors and immature Schwann cells are most abundant coincides with enhanced susceptibility to plexiform neurofibroma tumorigenesis. This model has important implications for understanding early cellular events that dictate neurofibroma development, as well as for the development of novel therapies targeting these tumors.","Materials and Methods Mice All mice were housed in the animal facility at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas (UTSW). Animal care and use were in compliance with regulations of the Institutional Animal Care and Research Advisory Committee at UTSW. The  NF1 flox/−  mice are in a mixed genetic background of C57BL/6/Sv129 and have been described previously ( 9 ). For conditional ablation of  NF1 , we used a tamoxifen-inducible Cre line, the  PLPCre-ERT2  transgenic mice ( 27 ). The LacZ reporter mice,  ROSA26R  ( 28 ), were obtained from the Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Tamoxifen Induction Tamoxifen (TM, Sigma) was dissolved in a sunflower oil/ethanol (10:1) mixture at 10 mg/ml. For embryonic induction, the pregnant mice were gavaged orally with 1 mg of tamoxifen twice a day for one day during embryogenesis (E12.5). We were unable to give tamoxifen earlier because it resulted in spontaneous abortion. For perinatal induction, 2 mg of tamoxifen were gavaged orally twice a day for five days to lactating mothers of newborn animals during perinatal period (P0-P5). To activate Cre activity in adulthood, adult mice were gavaged orally with 4 mg of tamoxifen a day for five days. Histology, Immunostaining and X-gal Staining For hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) histology analysis, tissue specimens were harvested and fixed with 10% formalin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 day and subsequently embedded in paraffin. Sections (5 μm thick) were stained with H&E per manufacturer’s protocol (StatLab, Lewisville, Texas). For immunohistochemistry, paraffin sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated and subjected to antigen retrieval prior to incubation with the primary antibodies. The primary antibodies were visualized by treating the sections with biotinylated secondary antibody and followed by amplification with peroxidase-conjugated avidin and DAB substrate per manufacturer’s protocol (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). The dilutions of primary antibodies used in this study are as follows: GAP43 (rabbit, 1:1000, Abcam) and S100β (rabbit, 1:5000, DAKO). For X-gal staining, mice were anesthetized with ketamine (1.5 mg/mouse) and subjected to total body perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Tissues were harvested, equilibrated in 30% sucrose in PBS overnight at 4°C, washed three times with 1X PBS and stained with X-gal at 30°C overnight. The tissues were then postfixed with 10% formalin overnight, paraffin embedded, sectioned and counterstained with nuclear fast red. The X-gal reaction mixture is comprised of 1 mg/ml 4-chloro-5-bromo-3-indolyl-β-galactoside (X-gal), 4 mM potassium ferrocyanide, 4 mM potassium ferricyanide, and 2 mM magnesium chloride in PBS. Leder Stain for Mast Cells Leder staining, an enzymatic stain for Naphthol AS-D (3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid-O-toluidine) chloroacetate esterase to detect tissue mast cells was performed as previously described ( 29 ). Briefly, paraffin sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated and placed in pararosaniline veronal acetate esterase solution for 30 minutes, rinsed in distilled water for 2 minutes and counter-stained with hematoxylin solution. The tissue slides were then rinsed again in distilled water, dehydrated and mounted using xylene base medium.",Lu Q Le; Chiachi Liu; Tracey Shipman; Zhiguo Chen; Ueli Suter; Luis F Parada,Cancer research,2011-07-01,10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-4577,minimal,True
PMID:20668197,A distinct set of Drosophila brain neurons required for neurofibromatosis type 1-dependent learning and memory.,"Nonspecific cognitive impairments are one of the many manifestations of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). A learning phenotype is also present in Drosophila melanogaster that lack a functional neurofibromin gene (nf1). Multiple studies have indicated that Nf1-dependent learning in Drosophila involves the cAMP pathway, including the demonstration of a genetic interaction between Nf1 and the rutabaga-encoded adenylyl cyclase (Rut-AC). Olfactory classical conditioning experiments have previously demonstrated a requirement for Rut-AC activity and downstream cAMP pathway signaling in neurons of the mushroom bodies. However, Nf1 expression in adult mushroom body neurons has not been observed. Here, we address this discrepancy by demonstrating (1) that Rut-AC is required for the acquisition and stability of olfactory memories, whereas Nf1 is only required for acquisition, (2) that expression of nf1 RNA can be detected in the cell bodies of mushroom body neurons, and (3) that expression of an nf1 transgene only in the alpha/beta subset of mushroom body neurons is sufficient to restore both protein synthesis-independent and protein synthesis-dependent memory. Our observations indicate that memory-related functions of Rut-AC are both Nf1-dependent and -independent, that Nf1 mediates the formation of two distinct memory components within a single neuron population, and that our understanding of Nf1 function in memory processes may be dissected from its role in other brain functions by specifically studying the alpha/beta mushroom body neurons.",,Monica E Buchanan; Ronald L Davis,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2010-07-28,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0283-10.2010,abstract_only,False
PMID:39890807,Global proteomics and affinity mass spectrometry analysis of human Schwann cells indicates that variation in and loss of neurofibromin (NF1) alters protein expression and cellular and mitochondrial metabolism.,"In efforts to evaluate potential biomarkers and drug targets for Neurofibromatosis Type I (NF1) we utilized affinity mass spectrometry and global proteomics to investigate how variation within and loss of NF1 affect immortalized human Schwann cells. We used Strep tagged mNf1 cDNAs (both wild type (WT) and variant) to affinity purity NF1 Protein-Protein interactors (PPIs) from the Schwann cells. We were able to identify 98 PPIs and show that some of these PPIs bind differentially to variant proteins. Next, we evaluated global proteomes. We identified over 1900 proteins in immortalized human Schwann cells both with and without NF1 expression. We identified 148 proteins with differential expression levels based on genotype. Following Ingenuity Pathway analysis (IPA) we found multiple pathways were altered including decreases in ""oxidative phosphorylation,"" increases in ""mitochondrial dysfunction"", and ""glycolysis"", as well as changes in ""Myelination Signaling Pathway."" When we evaluated the proteome of NF1 null cells stably transfected with tagged mNf1 cDNAs we again identified an overall trend of metabolic differences pertaining to ""oxidative phosphorylation"", ""mitochondria dysfunction"", and ""glycolysis"" in the variant cDNA expressing cells. We then validated differential expression of the following proteins: LAMC1, CYB5R3, and SOD2 that are observed in the altered pathways. Finally, consistent with our proteomics findings, we show that NF1 is required to maintain mitochondrial respiratory function in Schwann cells by stabilizing NADH-linked oxidative phosphorylation and electron transfer. Taken together, these data indicate that NF1 plays a significant role in mitochondrial metabolism that results in proteomic changes in Schwann cells and may serve as a future drug target.","Materials and methods Cell lines : ipn97.4 immortalized human Schwann cells were obtained from Peggy Wallace . To create an isogenic  28 NF1  null cell line, we utilized CRISPR Cas9 targeting of  NF1 exon 2  to create inactivating indels in  46 NF1  on both alleles  (Supplemental Fig. 1 ) and created the following two variants: c.101delT and c.102delC. These cells do not express NF1 and show increased Ras activity in relation to WT parental cells ( Supplemental Fig. 1) . ipn97.4 NF1 -/- and +/+ cells were grown in DMEM (Gibco # 11995-065) with 10% serum and 1x P/S. Whole genome sequencing data analysis : DNA from both NF1 +/+ and -/- ipn97.4 cell lines was whole genome sequenced as paired end 150 bp using Illumina’s NovaSeq 6000. The raw sequence reads were first trimmed using Trim Galore (version 0.6.10) to remove any primer adapter contamination (parameters used: --paired --trim-n --nextseq 20). The trimmed sequence reads were further analyzed using Broad’s Genome Analysis ToolKit (version 4.6.0) following their Best Practices Guidelines . In brief, BWA (version 0.7.17-r1188) was used to align the trimmed sequences to GATKs hg38 genome from their Resource Bundle. Duplicate reads were removed with Picard tools (version 3.2.0) and Base Quality Score Recalibration (BQSR) was then applied to get more accurate base quality scores, which will in turn improve the accuracy of the variant calls. Both Delly and Manta were used to identify structural variants from these alignments to identify any type of off-target effects 47 . 48 , 49 Nf1 cDNA and creation of stably transfected cell lines.  We have developed and validated an m Nf1  cDNA expression system that allows us to examine the biochemical effects of any  NF1 genetic variant . The wild type (WT) m 46 Nf1  cDNA plasmid was developed by GeneCopoeia and is commercially available. The full-length, endogenous mouse cDNA ( mNf1)  containing  Nf1 isoform 2 which includes the alternatively spliced exon 31 within the GRD produces a > 250 kDa neurofibromin protein that is capable of modulating Ras signaling .  46 mNf1  cDNA is appropriate for study because the full-length cDNA sequences of endogenous  hNF1  and  mNf1  have 92% sequence identity and amino acid sequences share 98% identity. Previously, we added an affinity tag to the 3’ end of the m Nf1 cDNA . We used traditional subcloning to replace the BlpI and NotI restriction fragment in m 26 Nf1  cDNA (GeneCopoeia  NM_010897.2 ) with a similar fragment containing an in-frame insertion of ENLYFQSGAWSHPQFELGSSASHHHHHHVX amino acids between the penultimate valine and final stop codon. These code for a TEV cleavage site, a StrepII tag, and a 6X His tag. We refer to this as “tagged” m Nf1 or WT. We also introduced variants of clinical relevance and associated with genotype phenotype correlations . Variants were introduced into shuttle vectors by utilization of synthetic DNA fragments and then cloned into the full-length vector using standard enzymes. Each variant plasmid was confirmed by sequencing the entire  1 , 50 – 53 Nf1  cDNA insert, and all subsequent DNA preparations were validated by spot checking for the variant of interest. The tagged constructs were transfected into the  NF1  -/- ipn97.4 cells as follows. Cells were seeded at 7.5 × 10 5  cells per well in a 6 well plate. The following day cells were transfected with 2.5 ug of DNA and 5 uL of Lipo 3000 reagent for 24 h. The following day transfection with an additional 1 ug of DNA using LipoD while Lipo3000 mix is still in the wells. On the third day, media was replaced with fresh media without transfection reagents or plasmids and cells rested overnight. On the fourth day we began selection with 500 ug/ml G418 for 14–21 days until there were enough cells to pick colonies for single-cell selection. Cells remained under continuous selection while they were picked and harvested to test for NF1 protein expression via Western blot. Once confirmed, we continued to grow the cells in 10 cm dish with selection media (DMEM (Gibco # 11995-065) with 10% FBS, 1x P/S, and 500 ug/ml G418) until confluent and frozen back. Strep tag affinity purification : We utilized a StepTactin XT System from IBA Lifesciences (Gottingen, Germany). Whole cell lysates were generated by collecting cells and lysing them with five freeze–thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen and a 37 °C water bath. 10 µL of biotin blocking solution (iba Cat. #: 2–0205-050) was added to each sample before centrifuging the samples at 10,000 g for 20 min to clear lysates. Mag Strep  “type3” XT beads (iba Cat. #: 2–4090-002) for  Strep -tag purification were washed in 1X Buffer W (iba Cat. #: 2–1003-100). The supernatant from the cleared lysates was added to the tubes containing the beads and incubated on ice with vortexing every 10 min. After 30 min, the samples were placed on the magnetic separator (iba Cat. #: 2–1602-000). The supernatant was removed and the beads were washed three times with 1× Buffer W (iba Cat. #: 2–1003-100; Göttingen, Germany) before either being submitted to the UAB School of Medicine Mass Spectrometry/Proteomics Shared Facility or used for immediate Western blot analysis. Sample preparation Proteomics analysis were carried out as previously referenced with minor changes  (Ludwig et al., under Sect. 2.5 nLC-ESI-MS2 under Protein IDs for GeLC). Global protein extracts were attained using M-PER™ Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat.# 78501), and quantified using Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat.# PI23225). As were experimentally determined, 40ug of protein per sample were diluted to 35µL using NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (1x final conc., Invitrogen, Cat.# NP0007). Protein-protein interaction (PPI) experiments contained enriched fractions of ~ 5ug and treated similarly, for both studies the samples were then reduced with DTT and denatured at 70 °C for 10 min prior to loading everything onto Novex NuPAGE 10% Bis-Tris Protein gels (Invitrogen, Cat.# NP0315BOX) and separated (35 min at 200 constant V). The gels were stained overnight with Novex Colloidal Blue Staining kit (Invitrogen, Cat.# LC6025). Following de-staining, each entire lane were cut into multiple MW fractions (4 fractions each run on different LCMS systems as was experimentally determined to be optimal as indicated below) and equilibrated in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (AmBc), each gel plug was then digested overnight with Trypsin Gold, Mass Spectrometry Grade (Promega, Cat.# V5280) following manufacturer’s instruction. Peptide extracts were reconstituted in 0.1% Formic Acid/ ddH2O at 0.1 µg/µL. 54 Mass spectrometry : For both global PPI experiments, peptide digests (8µL each) were injected onto a 1260 Infinity nHPLC stack (Agilent Technologies) and separated using a 75 micron I.D. x 15 cm pulled tip C-18 column (Jupiter C-18 300 Å, 5 micron, Phenomenex). The nHPLC was configured with binary mobile phases that includes solvent A (0.1%FA in ddH2O), and solvent B (0.1%FA in 15% ddH2O / 85% ACN), programmed as follows; 10 min @ 5%B (2µL/ min, load), [35 min for global & 90 min for PPI experiments] @ 5–40%B (linear: 0.5nL/ min, analyze), 5 min @ 70%B (2µL/ min, wash), 10 min @ 0%B (2µL/ min, equilibrate). For the global proteomics studies this system ran in-line with a Thermo Q Exactive HFx mass spectrometer, equipped with a Nanospray FlexTM ion source (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and all data were collected in CID/HCD mode, and for the PPI experiments, the same model of HPLC ran in-line with a Thermo Velos Pro Orbitrap mass spectrometer, equipped with a Nanospray ion source (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and all data were collected in CID mode. In both cases following each parent ion scan (300–1200 m/z @ 60k resolution), fragmentation data (MS2) were collected on the top-most intense 18 ions (@7.5 K resolution for the global study & normal scan mode for the PPI study). For data dependent scans, charge state screening and dynamic exclusion were enabled with a repeat count of 2, repeat duration of 30s, and exclusion duration of 90s. MS Data Conversion and Searches The XCalibur RAW files were collected in profile mode, centroided and converted to MzXML using ReAdW v. 3.5.1. The mgf files were then created using MzXML2Search (included in TPP v. 3.5) for all scans. The data were searched using MACOT for the global studies, and SEQUEST (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for the PPI studies, both searches were set for three maximum missed cleavages, a precursor mass window of 20ppm, trypsin digestion, variable modification C @ 57.0293, and M @ 15.9949. Searches were performed with a species-specific subset of the UniProtKB database. Peptide filtering, grouping, and quantification The list of peptide IDs generated based on SEQUEST or MASCOT search results were filtered separately using Scaffold (Protein Sciences, Portland Oregon). Scaffold filters and groups all peptides to generate and retain only high confidence IDs while also generating normalized spectral counts (N-SC’s) across all samples for the purpose of relative quantification. The filter cut-off values were set with minimum peptide length of > 5 AA’s, with no MH + 1 charge states, with peptide probabilities of > 80% C.I., and with the number of peptides per protein ≥ 2. The protein probabilities were set to a > 99.0% C.I., and an FDR < 1.0. Scaffold incorporates the two most common methods for statistical validation of large proteome datasets, the false discovery rate (FDR) and protein probability . Relative quantification across experiments will then be performed via spectral counting, and when relevant, spectral count abundances will then be normalized between samples 55 – 57 . 58 – 60 Statistical Analysis for PPI : We performed 3 replicates of each affinity purification using wildtype tagged m Nf1  cDNA (WT) and variant tagged m Nf1  (G848R, R1276Q, R1809C, and delM992) in  NF1 null ipn97.4 human Schwann cells. Using previously generated data in HEK293 cells, we used empty vector (EV) controls to filter out non-specific PPIs . All lists from each individual pull down were compiled ( 29 Supplemental Tables 17–18 ). Each variant cDNA was compared to WT cDNA individually. First, we filtered for proteins that were seen to pull down within each of the replicates for a given group (WT, G848R, R1276Q, R1809C, and delM992). Next, we filtered for proteins that are seen in all replicates of each comparison (WT to each of the four variants). For the affinity purification studies, two separate non-parametric statistical analyses were performed between each pair-wise comparison. These non-parametric analyses include 1) the calculation of weight values by significance analysis of microarray (SAM; cut off >|0.6|combined with 2) T-Test (single tail, unequal variance, cut off of  p  < 0.05), which then were sorted according to the highest statistical relevance in each comparison. For SAM, whereby the weight value (W) is a statistically derived function that approaches significance as the distance between the means (µ1–µ2) for each group increases, and the SD (δ1–δ2) decreases using the formula, W = (µ1–µ2)/(δ1–δ2). For protein abundance ratios determined with N-SC’s, we set a 1.5-fold change as the threshold for significance. In each case, all three tests (SAM, t-test, or fold change) had to pass as detailed above for final inclusion. To filter the final dataset to eliminate potential non-specific binding proteins we used untransfected ipn97.4  NF1  -/- cells for Strep Tag Affinity Purification and subsequent mass spectrometry analysis. Due to different pipelines between datasets, we utilized the sum of all spectral counts for each identified protein in the non-specific binding dataset ( Supplemental Table 20 ) and the ipn97.4 -/- stable transfected data set ( Supplemental Table 18 ). The ratio between the pull down with the non-specific analysis and the ipn97.4 -/- stable transfected data set was computed, and the final dataset was filtered for confidence with either 0%, 5%, 10%, or 20% pulled down ratio in the non-specific dataset. Subcellular localization was assessed for the PPI’s using the Human Protein Atlas (proteinatlas.org) Subcellular section (Protein Atlas version 23.0, Release date: 2023.06.19, Ensembl version: 109) . 61 Analysis of global proteomics : We preformed two separate global proteomics analyses including: ipn97.4  NF1  -/- compared to ipn97.4  NF1  +/+ cells, and ipn97.4  NF1  -/- cells stably transfected with WT m Nf1  cDNA compared to ipn97.4  NF1  -/- cells stably transfected with one of four variant m Nf1  cDNA’s (G848R, R1276Q, R1809C, or delM992). In each comparison the data were prefiltered to look at proteins that are seen to be in all 3 of each sample’s replicates. The data were then filtered to contain proteins that are seen to be in both the control group for each comparison (ipn97.4  NF1  +/+ cells or ipn97.4  NF1  -/- cells stably transfected with WT m Nf1  cDNA) and each experimental group (ipn97.4  NF1  -/- or ipn97.4  NF1  -/- stably transfected with variant cDNA’s). Raw data for spectral counts and filtered datasets for statistical measurements can be found in  Supplemental Tables 1–10 . To obtain the final sorted lists of high confidence proteins with differential abundances we used the same statistical measurements used for the PPI (SAM > |0.6|, T Test < 0.05, and fold change > or = |1.5|). Systems analysis : Gene Ontology Enrichment analysis was conducted using significantly altered protein abundances as described in previous sections. The GO Ontology database (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.6799722Released 2022-07-01) was used for determining biological processes associated with the proteins with significantly altered abundance . Further Pathway analysis was conducted using QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) 62 – 64 . Canonical pathways analysis identified the pathways from the QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis library of canonical pathways that were most significant to the data set. All proteins observed in each comparison were uploaded to IPA and molecules present in IPA that were associated with a canonical pathway in the QIAGEN Knowledge Base were considered for the analysis. The significance of the association between the data set and the canonical pathway was measured in two ways: (1) A ratio of the number of molecules from the data set that map to the pathway divided by the total number of molecules that map to the canonical pathway; and (2) A right-tailed Fisher’s Exact Test was used to calculate a p-value determining the probability that the association between the genes in the dataset and the canonical pathway is explained by chance alone. IPA was used with default setting parameters with modification to the species parameter set to only  65 homo sapiens . The z-score represents the activation or inhibition state of a canonical pathway. A z-score greater than 2.0 was considered as significantly activated. A z-score smaller than − 2.0 was considered as significantly inhibited. Western blots : Protein lysates were harvested and quantified using a Bradford assay. Protein was utilized for Western blot and denatured at 70 °C for 10 min. Samples were loaded on Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA, USA) 4–20% gradient gels (Cat. #: 4568094) and run at 100 V for 2 h. The gels were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane at 85 V for 2 h. Blots were probed overnight at 4 °C with either the neurofibromin antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies Cat. #: 14623 S; Danvers, MA, USA), or one of the selected antibodies for validation (details in  Supplemental Table 22 ). The next morning, the blots were washed, and then probed with the respective secondary (They were washed three more times before imaging using chemiluminescent substrate from BioRad (Cat. #: 170–5061; Hercules, California) per the manufacturer’s protocols. For specific antibodies used for validation in Fig.  2 E-F and Fig.  4 A-B refer to  Supplemental Table 17 . Mitochondrial respiratory function : OXPHOS and electron transfer capacity was measured in permeabilized cell suspensions by high-resolution respirometry as described previously . In brief, passage 15  66 NF1  +/+ and -/- cells were collected in trypsin-EDTA, transferred into conical tubes of serum-supplemented PBS, and centrifuged at 800 g for 10 min at 25 °C. The cell pellet was then resuspended in MiR05 medium and 750 K cells/ml were added into each chamber of an O2K system (Oroboros Instruments). Cells were permeabilized by addition of digitonin (5–10 µg/ml). Respiratory function was determined using the following concentrations of substrates, uncouplers, and inhibitors: malate (2 mM), pyruvate (2.5 mM), ADP (2.5 mM), glutamate (10 mM), succinate (10 mM), glycerol-3-phosphate (15 mM), tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD, 1 mM) in the presence of ascorbate (2 mM), carbonylcyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP, 1 µM increment), rotenone (150 nM), Atpenin 5 (1 mM), antimycin A (125 nM), and sodium azide (200 mM) as indicated. NADH- and succinate-linked OXPHOS and ET capacity were corrected for residual oxygen consumption by the antimycin A sensitive rate. Oxidation of reduced TMPD was corrected as the sodium azide sensitive rate. Data are expressed as the oxygen flow per second per million cells (O 2  Flow; pmol/sec/10 6  cells).",Christian X Fay; Elizabeth R M Zunica; Elias Awad; William Bradley; Cameron Church; Jian Liu; Hui Liu; David K Crossman; James A Mobley; John P Kirwan; Christopher L Axelrod; Erik Westin; Robert A Kesterson; Deeann Wallis,Scientific reports,2025-01-31,10.1038/s41598-024-84493-y,minimal,True
PMID:2500456,"Type 1 neurofibromatosis: selective expression of extracellular matrix genes by Schwann cells, perineurial cells, and fibroblasts in mixed cultures.","Cutaneous neurofibromas, characteristic lesions of neurofibromatosis 1, are composed of an abundant extracellular matrix and nerve connective tissue-derived cell types: Schwann cells, perineurial cells, and fibroblasts. In this study, the extracellular matrix gene expression by these cells was examined under culture conditions that allowed them to be metabolically active and readily identifiable by morphologic and immunocytochemical criteria. Northern hybridizations demonstrated expression of genes for type I, III, IV, and VI collagens, as well as for fibronectin, laminin, and elastin. In situ hybridizations revealed that all three cell types expressed pro alpha 1 (I), pro alpha 2 (VI), and laminin B1 chain genes. However, fibroblasts did not contain [35S]cDNA-mRNA hybrids specific for type IV collagen, whereas both Schwann cells and perineurial cells expressed these genes. Perineurial cells and fibroblasts readily expressed the fibronectin gene whereas Schwann cells were essentially devoid of the corresponding mRNA. Perineurial cells also expressed the gene for laminin A chain. The results indicate that the extracellular matrix gene expression profiles of Schwann cells, perineurial cells, and fibroblasts are distinct: all three cell types are capable of expressing some of the genes for extracellular matrix components, such as type I and VI collagens, whereas Schwann cells and perineurial cells may have the primary role in synthesizing basement membrane zone components, type IV collagen and laminin. These observations potentially relate to the mechanisms of growth and development of human neurofibromas. The results attest to the applicability of the methodology utilized here to study other human tumors with mixed cell populations.",,S Jaakkola; J Peltonen; V Riccardi; M L Chu; J Uitto,The Journal of clinical investigation,1989-07,10.1172/JCI114148,abstract_only,False
PMID:37520682,Combining nonsense mutation suppression therapy with nonsense-mediated decay inhibition in neurofibromatosis type 1.,Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) results from germline mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene ,"Materials and methods Generation of NF1 NS/+  minipigs Generation of a swine nonsense mutation model of NF1 followed a similar strategy as previously described.  Recurrent nonsense mutation  9 NF1  is located within exon 41 of the swine  NS NF1  gene, which shares 100% amino acid homology with exon 39 in the human  NF1  gene (Ensembl accession number: ENSSSCG00000017748.4, ENSG00000196712.18). TALENs were designed to flank the region of  NF1  in exon 41. Ossabaw minipig fetal fibroblasts isolated from day 38 embryos were transfected with TALENs and a 90-mer homology-directed repair (HDR) template containing the  R1947 NF1  mutation, as well as three silent mutations to prevent TALEN rebinding. Transfection reactions included 0.6 × 10 R1497∗ 6  fibroblasts, 0.5 μg of RNA from each TALEN, and 0.2 nmol of HDR were pulsed for 20 ms at 1,800 V using the Neon Transfection System (Thermo). Resulting cells were plated at low density for 10 days at 38.5°C. Colonies derived from single cells were isolated, and gene editing was detected by DNA sequencing. Heterozygous clones were used to produce filial 0 (F0) generation  NF1  minipigs using somatic cell nuclear transfer.  R1947/+ NF1  F0 minipigs were sequence validated and bred with WT sows to produce offspring that exhibited germline transmission of the  R1947/+ NF1  allele mutation with Mendelian frequencies. Animal husbandry All animal work was performed in Recombinetics facilities under its animal welfare assurance A4728-01. All animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and performed with appropriate veterinary oversight. Sequence validation Validation of gene modification was performed after fibroblast transfection. Cells were lysed in PCR-safe lysis buffer (10 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.0; 2 mM EDTA; 2.5% (vol/vol) Tween 20; 2.5% (vol/vol) Triton X-100; 100 μg/mL proteinase K) and incubated for 1 h at 55°C and 15 min at 95°C. PCR used 1 μL of prepared lysate in Accustart II PCR Supermix (QuantaBio) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Gene editing in colonies was detected by direct Sanger sequencing of PCR amplicons. DNA was isolated from harvested tissues using DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Schwann cell culture Schwann cells were isolated as previously described. 9 ,  Sciatic nerve or cutaneous neurofibroma were biopsied from WT or NF1 18 R1947/+  minipigs and transported in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM; Thermo) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Thermo) and 1% Antibiotic/Antimycotic (AA; Thermo). In a laminar flow hood, specimens were rinsed in 70% ethanol and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; VWR 16750-078) by briefly dipping into each solution 10 times. Tissues were minced and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO 2  in dissociation media containing DMEM with 10% FBS, 1% AA, 1x collagenase A (Thermo), and 1x dispase II (Roche) overnight in a Petri dish, then transferred to a conical and centrifuged at 270 ×  g  for 5 min. Cells were plated onto a poly-L-lysine (0.05 mg/mL) and laminin-coated (10 μg/mL) six-well plate and cultured in complete media containing DMEM with high-glucose (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% FBS (GIBCO), forskolin (2 μM) (Calbiochem), 1% N2 supplement (Thermo), recombinant human neuregulin-b1 (NRG1) (10 ng/mL) (R&D Systems), and 1% AA. Media was replaced every 2 days. Schwann cells were separated from contaminating fibroblasts via magnetic cell selection, as described. 9 ,  Purified Schwann cells were expanded and stored in liquid nitrogen at low passage and vials were thawed immediately prior to use in experiments to maintain low-passage cells. 18 Flow cytometry Schwann cells were isolated from contaminating fibroblasts via p75 NGFR antibody-mediated magnetic cell selection, according to the manufacturer’s protocol (MACS, Miltenyi Biotec).  Positive (Schwann cells) and negative (fibroblasts) fractions were incubated with anti-p75 NGFR antibody ( 7 Table S5 ) for 15 min, then washed for 5 min with PBS +2% FBS. Unstained Schwann cells were used as a negative control after initial testing with an isotype control antibody showed no background staining. Cells were run through a CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) using the Cytexpert software according to the manufacturer’s protocol. FlowJo software was used to determine cell purity. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR Total RNA was extracted from cells and tissues using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration and quality was measured using a NanoDrop One (Thermo). RT-qPCR was performed using the Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time System (Bio-Rad) using technical replicates and Beta-actin as a housekeeping gene. Data were then normalized to the average of the control group and fold change was calculated as 2 −ΔΔCt . Primers used for this study are listed in  Table S6 . RNA sequencing RNA was extracted from cells using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 using a 150 paired end flow cell. For comparisons of transcript expression between fibroblasts and Schwann cells ( Figures S2 A and S2B), data were pooled from WT fibroblasts from skin (n = 1) and sciatic nerve (n = 1) to obtain n = 2, and data in the form of Fragmnets Per Kilobase of Transcript Per Million Mapped Reads (FPKM) were pooled from all Schwann cell cultures to obtain n = 15. For comparisons between Schwann cells, data were separated as follows: WT Schwann cells (n = 2),  NF1  Schwann cells (n = 8), and  NS/+ NF1  (pooled data from  −/− NF1  and  NS/− NF1 FS/− )  Schwann cells (n = 5). The RNA sequencing data were mapped to the Ensembl Sus Scrofa genome 11.1, release 103  using HISAT2 36  and quantified with StringTie. 37  All graphs were generated using R 38  and tidyverse. 39 40 Protein extraction from cells and tissues For extraction of protein from cells, snap frozen pellets were briefly thawed on ice and resuspended in RIPA buffer (Sigma) containing protease (Sigma) and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma), then vortexed at 2,000 rpm at 4°C for 20 min, then centrifuged at 4°C for 15 min at 20,000 ×  g . For extraction of protein from tissues, snap frozen tissues were thawed briefly on ice, then 50 to 80 mg of tissue was transferred to a 2-mL microtube containing ceramic homogenizers (Agilent Technologies) and homogenized using a Bead Blaster (Benchmark Scientific) at 4,260 rpm, 7 m/s linear speed, 3 cycles of 30 s at 4°C. Homogenates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 3 min at 4°C, then supernatants were transferred to new tubes and sonicated at an amplitude of 20A for 10 s at 4°C, vortexed at 2,000 rpm at 4°C for 20 min, then centrifuged at 20,000 ×  g  at 4°C for 15 min. Western blotting Protein lysates from cells or tissues were quantified using a BCA assay (Thermo). Twenty to 30 μg of protein was denatured at 95°C for 5 min and separated by electrophoresis using SDS on 1.5-mm NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris protein gels (Thermo). Protein was transferred to Immun-Blot PVDF Membrane (Bio-Rad) overnight (16–20 h) at 18 V, 4°C. Membranes were cut according to target molecular weights and blocked at room temperature (RT) for 1 h using 5% blocking grade buffer (Bio-Rad) in TBST (Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20) (Sigma). Membranes were incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4°C and washed with TBST three times for 5 min at RT, then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at RT and washed again as described above. All washes and incubations were performed on a rocking platform. Blots were developed with the WesternBright Quantum Kit (Advansta). All washes and incubations were performed on a rocking platform. Bands were imaged using the Li-Cor Odyssey Fc Imaging System, quantified by densitometry, and normalized to HSP90. Antibodies used for this study are listed in  Table S5 . Immunofluorescence Schwann cells or fibroblasts were seeded on 8-well chamber slides (Ibidi) coated with poly-L-lysine and laminin, as described.  Cells were harvested 24 to 48 h later and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (EM Sciences) for 15 min at RT. Fixed cells were permeabilized in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% Triton X-100 for 30 min at RT, and further incubated with anti-p75 NGFR overnight at 4°C in the dark. The next day, cells were washed in PBS containing 1% BSA two times for 5 min at RT, incubated with anti-phalloidin for 1 h in the dark at RT, and washed again as described above. Cells were mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Thermo) and coverslipped using Gold Seal Cover Glass (EM Sciences). Images were acquired using a Cytation 5 cell imaging reader (BioTek). 9 Proliferation assay Schwann cells were seeded in triplicate at 1,200 cells per well in poly-L-lysine and laminin-coated 96-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight in complete media. Media was added to empty wells as a background control. Proliferation was evaluated by the alamarBlue TM  cell viability assay (Invitrogen) after indicated days in culture. Reagent was added to cells for 3 h, then fluorescence was detected using a Cytation 5 microplate reader (BioTek) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Nonsense mutation suppression treatment of Schwann cells Gentamicin (Sigma) and G418 (Corning) were reconstituted in sterile deionized water to a stock concentration of 50 mg/mL and 500 mg/mL, respectively, and stored at −20°C. Ataluren (MedChem Express) was reconstituted in sterile dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a stock concentration of 10 mM and stored at −80°C. Cells were seeded in complete media at a density of 0.3 × 10 6  cells/plate in 10-cm plates. Media was changed 24 h later to complete media without AA and containing vehicle or drugs at indicated concentrations. Cells were harvested 24, 48, and 72 h after drug treatment and divided for protein and/or RNA extraction. In vivo  drug formulation and dosing Gentamicin was purchased from Fresenius Kabi LLC and formulated in sterile isotonic saline to a concentration of 40 mg/mL. Human equivalent doses (HED) were determined by allometric scaling using the standard conversion coefficient (K m ), where K m  = 1.1 for minipig and HED determination. Consequently, a 7.5-mg/kg human equivalent dose was 8.25 mg/kg. The required volume of drug for each animal was then based on individual body weight and determined on the day of administration. Trial design The PK of gentamicin in plasma was assessed at baseline and at a steady state, and the PD of gentamicin was assessed by measuring neurofibromin and p-ERK protein levels at steady state. For baseline evaluation, five NF1 minipigs at 2 to 3 months of age received a single subcutaneous injection of 8.25 mg/kg gentamicin. Whole blood was collected immediately before drug administration and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after gentamicin administration. For steady-state PK analysis, five NF1 pigs received a subcutaneous injection of 8.25 mg/kg gentamicin daily for 14 days alongside four untreated age-matched controls. On day 14, blood was collected immediately prior to gentamicin administration and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after gentamicin administration. For tissue analyses, a final dose of gentamicin was administered on day 15 and animals were euthanized 30 min after administration. Tissue samples (skin, sciatic nerve, optic nerve, and cortex) were collected from each animal at the same approximate locations and divided for analysis. Quantification of gentamicin in plasma and tissues Plasma isolations were performed as described in a previous study.  Briefly, serial whole blood samples (1.5 mL) were collected from the jugular vein into lithium heparin vacutainer tubes. Samples were immediately transferred to a 1.7-mL microfuge tube and centrifuged at 2,000 ×  10 g  for 10 min at 4°C. Supernatant (plasma) was transferred to a cryovial and stored at −80°C until analysis. For plasma specimens, gentamicin was measured with a standard immunoassay (Siemens Dimension Vista System and Flex reagent cartridge). Assay analytical measurement ranged from 0.2 to 12 mg/L, and samples with results higher than 12 mg/L were diluted appropriately and re-analyzed. Within-run precision is 0.3% CV, between-day precision is 0.4% CV, and accuracy is 99.8% (correlation coefficient). For each tissue type (skin, sciatic nerve, optic nerve, and cerebral cortex), samples were analyzed commercially using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS; BioAgilytix, San Diego, CA). Gentamicin sulfate salt (Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc.) was used to prepare stock standard and working standard solutions. Gentamicin-d 35  in its propyl derivative form (Sigma Aldrich, derivatized at BioAgilytix) was prepared as an internal standard. Standard curves and quality controls were prepared with untreated tissues. Tissues were prepared with a homogenization solution containing collagenase. Homogenates were mixed with internal standard (Gentamicin-d35), and derivatized with propyl chloroformate. The analysis of gentamicin isoforms C1, C1 a , and C2 + C2 a  (combined) was conducted via LC-MS/MS. The LC-MS/MS system consisted of a Waters Acquity UPLC (Milford, MA) coupled with a Waters Xevo TQ-S Micro Triple Quad mass spectrometer (Milford, MA). Mass transition data were acquired in electrospray positive ion (ESI + ) mode and captured using MassLynx 4.1 (Waters, Milford, MA). The method is applicable for measuring total gentamicin concentrations ranging from 2.00 to 5,000 ng/mL. The mean percent deviations of quality control samples from the theoretical values did not exceed 5.46% from theoretical values. Plasma PK analysis Gentamicin plasma concentration-time data from subcutaneous administration were analyzed with noncompartmental methods as implemented in R (version 4.0.1) and R Studio PKNCA package (version 0.9.4). Pharmacokinetic parameters and measures of systemic exposure included area under the concentration-time curve (AUC; linear up, log down), maximum concentration (C max ), time to C max  (T max ), and half-life (t 1/2 ). DLR assay The  NF1  DLR plasmid was kindly provided by David Bedwell at University of Alabama. The  R1497X Renilla -NF1-R1947X-Firefly insert contains 30 nucleotides surrounding the premature termination codon in NF1-R1947X inserted between the  Renilla  and Firefly genes. The 30-base pair readthrough cassette contains  NF1  ( R1497X G TCG AC G GAT GCC AAA TGA CAA AGA GTT  GGA TCC ). Plasmids were amplified in DH5a  E. coli  using ampicillin selection and purified using a Qiagen miniprep kit, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. To produce stable cell cultures, we used Gateway cloning to transfer the DLR insert to a hygromycin-resistant PiggyBac Sleeping Beauty (PBSB) transposon vector. Briefly, a GBlock containing the DLR insert sequence and attB sites was cloned into the pDONR221 vector using BP clonase to produce pENTR-Renilla-NF1-R1947X-Firefly. This was cloned into the PBSB vector using LR clonase to produce pPBSB-CG-Renilla-NF1-R1947X-Firefly-PGK-Hygro, which was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Schwann cells were grown to 80% confluency and transfected with the PBSB transposon and PB7 (PiggyBac transposase) (5 μg each/ 1million cells) using the Neon electroporation system (Invitrogen #MPK10096). Media was changed after 24 h, and cells were allowed to recover in complete media for 24 h. Hygromycin was added to the media for 5 days and stable transfectants were confirmed by  Renilla  luciferase activity. Cells were treated with nonsense suppression drugs for 48 h. The DLR assay system (Promega) was used to detect readthrough, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Luminescence was measured using the Cytation 5 plate reader. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to  Renilla  luciferase activity and reported as a fold change over vehicle-treated cells. siRNA transfection Schwann cells were seeded at 0.15 × 10 6  cells in 10-cm plates. Twenty-four hours later, cells were transfected with 50 nm of siRNA targeting  UPF1 . In a pilot experiment, three custom and non-overlapping UPF1 duplexes were tested ( Figure S6 ): (1) Sense: 5′-CUGUAAUGGACGUGGAAAUUU-3′ Antisense: 5′-AUUUCCACGUCCAUUACAGUU-3' (2) Sense: 5′-GCAACAUAGCUGUGGAUCAUU-3′ Antisense: 5′-UGAUCCACAGCUAUGUUGCUU-3′ (3) Custom UPF1 duplex, 3 of 3: Sense: 5′-GGGUCAUUAUUGUGGGCAAUU-3′ Antisense: 5′-UUGCCCACAAUAAUGACCCUU-3′ Construct number 1 was chosen for further experiments, as it was the only construct that gave consistent and prolonged UPF1 inhibition. Increase in neurofibromin using siRNA treatment in combination with nonsense suppression therapy could not be replicated using siRNA constructs 2 or 3. Media was changed to fresh complete media 24 h later, and cells were harvested for protein at 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h post-transfection. Positive control Lamin A/C Control siRNA (Human/Mouse/Rat) (siGENOME #D-001050-01) used for the pilot experiment did not result in knockdown of minipig Lamin A/C, suggesting lack of sequence specificity with minipig and was therefore not used in subsequent experiments. Subsequent experiments utilized custom UPF1 duplex 1 of 3. Non-targeting siRNA (siGENOME #D-001210-01) and DharmaFECT 1 reagent (Horizon Discovery #T-2001-03) were used for all experiments according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For dual siUPF1 knockdown/nonsense suppression experiments, on day 3 post-transfection, cells were treated with vehicle or nonsense suppression drugs for 24 or 48 h, then harvested for RNA and protein extraction. Statistical analysis All graphs and statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism V9 with the exception of RNA sequencing analysis, which was performed using R. Specific analyses were used as indicated in figure legends to generate p values with α = 0.05 (ns, not significant with p value >0.05; ∗p value ≤ 0.05; ∗∗p value ≤ 0.01; ∗∗∗p value ≤ 0.001; ∗∗∗∗p value < 0.0001).",Sara H Osum; Eunice I Oribamise; Stanislas M A S Corbière; Mandy Taisto; Tyler Jubenville; Alex Coutts; Mark N Kirstein; James Fisher; Christopher Moertel; Ming Du; David Bedwell; David A Largaespada; Adrienne L Watson,Molecular therapy.

PMID:34040258,NF1 mutation drives neuronal activity-dependent initiation of optic glioma.,"Neurons have recently emerged as essential cellular constituents of the tumour microenvironment, and their activity has been shown to increase the growth of a diverse number of solid tumours","Methods Mice All mice were used in accordance with an approved Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol at Stanford University and Washington University. Mice were housed with free access to water and food according to the university’s guidelines in a 12-h light/12-h dark cycles unless otherwise noted. Mice were dark-reared in a dark room (24 h dark with dim red light) with routine care from the animal facility. The housing rooms are kept at a set point of 20–26 °C, with humidity ranging from 30 to 70%.  Nf1 ,  OPG Nf1  ( fl/mut Nf1 +/− ) and  Nf1  (wild-type) mice were previously generated fl/fl .  5 , 29 – 31 Thy1::ChR2-YFP  (line 20) and  Nlgn3 mice were acquired from the Jackson Laboratory (012350 and 008394, respectively). All mice were maintained on a C57/BL6 background (backcrossed for at least four generations) before analysis. Mice at 9, 16 or 24 weeks of age were analysed. Both male and female mice were used, as there is no difference in  KO Nf1 -OPG volume and proliferation between female and male mice . Because low-grade gliomas of the optic nerve do not grow to a size that causes animal morbidity beyond vision loss, a maximal tumour size end point was not required. Mice were routinely monitored for signs of morbidity such as weight loss and poor grooming. Sample sizes were chosen on the basis of prior power calculations and previously published experiments to achieve 80% power and significance level of 0.05. Mice were randomized to experimental groups. Investigators were blinded to group allocation during data collection and analyses. 13 Optogenetic stimulation Nf1 OPG ;Thy1::ChR2-YFP  mice (5 weeks old) were anaesthetized with 1–4% is oflurane and placed in a stereotactic apparatus. A fibre optic ferrule (Doric Lenses) was placed above the right optic nerve (0.5 mm right to midline, 0.5 mm anterior to bregma, 5 mm deep to cranial surface). The mice recovered for 7 days after surgery, followed by optogenetic stimulation from 6 to 12 weeks of age (1 stimulation session per 2 days). The stimulation was conducted as previously descrived . In brief, the mice were connected to a 100-mW 473-nm DPSS laser system with a mono fibre patch cord. Pulses of light (about 15 mW per mm 9 2  measured at the end of the patch cord) were administered at a frequency of 20 Hz for periods of 15 s, followed by 45-s recovery periods, for a total session duration of 15 min. Mice were killed at 16 weeks of age for histological analyses. Cell culture Optic glioma cells were isolated from the optic nerves of three-month-old  Nf1  mice OPG . Single cells were dissociated from the OPG with a digestion medium containing 0.01% sodium bicarbonate, 15 mM HEPES, 0.5% glucose, 0.2% BSA, 0.004% DNase I and 0.01% trypsin in HBSS. The reaction was quenched using 10% fetal bovine serum, followed by two washes in HBSS. The cell pellets were suspended and grown in low-attachment dishes (Millipore Sigma CLS3262) supplemented with neural stem cell (NSC) medium containing 61% DMEM low glucose medium, 35% neurobasal-A (Invitrogen 10888-022), 2 mM GlutaMAX (Invitrogen 35050-061), 1% penicillin–streptomycin, 1% N2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific 17502001), 2% B27-A (Thermo Fisher Scientific 12587-010), 20 ng ml 18 , 32 −1  mouse FGF (PeproTech 450-33), and 20 ng ml −1  mouse EGF (PeproTech 315-09). Cells were authenticated by staining for OPG markers (SOX2, nestin and CD133) and neurosphere-forming assays . Glioma neurospheres were passaged using Accutase (STEMCELL Technologies 07920, 15-min incubation at room temperature) to achieve single-cell suspension. Mycoplasma testing was performed periodically. For the  18 , 32 Nlgn3  qRT–PCR experiment, optic glioma cells were incubated with 30 nM NLGN3 in the NSC medium supplemented with 2% B27-A for 24 h. EdU incorporation assay Ten thousand optic glioma cells were seeded to fibronectin (10 μg ml −1 )-coated 8-chamber slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 154534PK), and grown in NSC medium without N2, FGF and EGF for 48 h, supplemented with vehicle (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 100 mM glycine and 10% glycerol), NLGN3 (70 nM unless otherwise noted, OriGene TP307955), or BDNF (70 nM, PeproTech 450-02). EdU proliferation assay was performed using the Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 594 imaging kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific  C10339 ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. EdU was added 8 h before fixing the cells in 4% paraformaldehyde. Images were taken using a Zeiss Axio Imager M2 and the Stereo Investigator software (mbfbioscience v2019). Cell proliferation was determined by dividing the number of EdU +  cells by the number of DAPI +  cells using Cell Profiler (v.3.1.9). All experiments were repeated three times with similar results. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence Mice were anaesthetized and transcardially perfused with 30 ml cold PBS. Optic nerves were fixed in 10% formalin (Thermo Fisher Scientific SF100-4) overnight at 4 °C, then transferred to 70% ethanol for paraffin embedding. Paraffin blocks were sectioned at 10 μm. Optic nerve paraffin sections were deparaffinized, and underwent antigen retrieval in boiling citric antigen retrieval buffer (Sigma-Aldrich C9999) for 15 min. For DAB staining, tissue sections were processed using the VECTASTAIN Elite ABC Universal PLUS Kit (Vector Laboratories PK-8200) according to the manufacturer’s instructions using mouse anti-Ki67 (1:2,000, BD Biosciences 556003 lot 8239549), rabbit anti-CD8 (1:500, Cell Signaling Technology 98941T lot 5), or goat anti-PDGFRα (1:2,000, R&D Systems AF1062 RRID: AB_2236897) as the primary antibody. For immunofluorescence staining, tissue sections were permeabilized and incubated in blocking solution (3% normal donkey serum, 0.3% Triton X-100 in TBS) at room temperature for 1 h, incubated with primary antibodies, rabbit anti-S100β (1:2,000, Abcam ab52642 lot GR3215095-1), rabbit anti-IBA1 (1:1,000, Abcam ab178846 lot GR3185035-4), or mouse anti-BRN3A (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-8429 lot H1718), at 4 °C overnight, washed in TBS, incubated with secondary antibodies (donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594, 1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch 711-585-152) and DAPI, washed in TBS and then mounted with prolong gold (Invitrogen  P36930 ). Images were taken using a Zeiss Axio Imager M2 and quantified using ImageJ (v.2.0.0). Optic nerve volume measurements Optic nerves were photographed and diameters were measured at 0, 150, 300 and 450 μm (anterior to the chiasm) to generate optic nerve volumes, as previously described . 33 Conditioned medium experiments Mice at six weeks of age were briefly exposed to CO 2  and immediately decapitated. Eyeballs with the optic nerves attached were isolated, and microdissected to expose the retina. The resulting retina and optic nerve tissues were then placed in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) and allowed to recover for at least 30 min. After recovery, tissues were transferred into fresh aCSF in a 96-well plate (one retina and optic nerve preparation per well). For the stimulated group, retina and optic nerve preparations were stimulated using a blue-light LED from a microscope objective at 20-Hz pulses for a 30-s-on, 90-s-off phase for 30 min, and then left in ambient light for 1.5 h. For the unstimulated group, tissues were incubated with 1 nM TTX (Abcam ab120055) and kept in the dark for 2 h. Conditioned medium was collected, supplemented with 1× phosphatase inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific 78428) and 1× protease inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific 87786), and stored at −80 °C for western blotting. Western blotting Optic nerves were lysed in RIPA buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-24948) supplemented with 1× phosphatase inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific 78428) and 1× protease inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific 87786). Protein concentrations were determined using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific 23225). Twenty μg of optic nerve lysate or 5 μg of conditioned medium was used for SDS–PAGE. PVDF membranes were subsequently blocked in 5% BSA and Tris buffered saline with 1% Triton X-100 (TBST), followed by primary antibody (rabbit anti-NLGN3, 1:500, Novus NBP1-90080 lot B118108; rabbit anti-β-actin, 1:10,000, Cell Signaling 4970 lot 15; rabbit anti-ADAM10, 1:250, Abcam ab124695 lot GR3244660-5; rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-3, 1:500, R&D Systems MAB835 lot KHK051810A; and rabbit anti-caspase-3, 1:1,000, Cell Signaling 9662 lot 19) incubation overnight at 4 °C and secondary antibody (1:10,000 anti-rabbit IgG-HRP, Cell Signaling 7074) incubation for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were developed using the SuperSignal West Femto Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific 34095), imaged on a Bio-Rad Gel Doc imager using Image Lab software (v.6) and analysed using Image Studio Lite (v.5.0.21). The intense overexposed full-length NLGN3 band was cropped out to allow for easy identification of shed NLGN3. Pharmacological studies For ADAM10 inhibition, mice were injected with 100 mg kg −1  GI254023X (Sigma-Aldrich SML0798), or the same volume of vehicle (10% DMSO in 01.M carbonate buffer), intraperitoneally, 5 days per week.  Nf1 +/−  mice were dosed from 6 to 7 weeks of age.  Nf1  mice were dosed from 6 to 16, or 12 to 16, weeks of age. OPG For BDNF and TrkB inhibition,  Nf1  mice were gavaged with 120 mg kg OPC −1  entrectinib (MedChem Express HY-12678), or the same volume of vehicle (7% DMSO and 10% Tween 80), from 6 to 16 weeks of age (1 dose every 2 days to minimize toxicity). For TTX injection, 3 pl of 1 mM TTX (Tocris 1069) or the same volume of vehicle (PBS) was injected into the vitreal chamber of the eyes of 6-week-old  Nf1 +/−  mice, once per day for 2 days, followed by euthanizing the mice on day 3. Human pilocytic astrocytoma samples The pilocytic astrocytoma and non-neoplastic brain tissue samples were obtained from the paediatric tumour banks at St. Louis Children’s Hospital, University of California Los Angeles and Stanford University in accordance with protocols approved by their respective Institutional Review Boards and with informed consent. Information about the samples is included in  Extended Data Tables 1 ,  2 . Pattern electroretinography recording Nf1  mice were either raised in 12-h light/12-h dark cycles, or reared in complete darkness from 6 to 12 weeks of age. All mice were dark-adapted overnight before pattern electroretinography (PERG) were performed. PERGs were recorded and analysed at 12 weeks of age using the Celeris ERG stimulator (Diagnosys) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, mice were anaesthetized with avertin (0.3 mg g OPG −1 ), with eyes dilated before placing a PERG electrode on the corneal surface. A visual stimulus generated by black and white alternating contrast-reversing bars was aligned with the projection of the pupil. PERGs were measured between the first positive peak (P1) and second negative peak (N2), and adjacent trough of the waveform. Three mice per group and 600 reads per eye were recorded. Mass spectrometry Proteins within the conditioned medium preparations were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, followed by selecting potential spots for BDNF and NLGN3 for MALDI–TOF MS and TOF/TOF tandem MS using previously described methods . 9 RNA isolation and qRT–PCR RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit per manufacturer’s instructions. qRT–PCR was performed using the SYBR-Green PCR master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific 4309155) using the following primers, as previously described :  9 NLCN3  forward: GGGAGTCCCCTTTCTGAAGC;  NLCN3  reverse: CCTTCATGGCCACACTGACT;  ACTB  forward: TGAAGTGTGACGTGGACATC;  ACTB  reverse: GGAGGAGCAATGATCTTGAT. Relative expression was quantified using the Δ C t  method. RNA-seq and transcriptomic analysis For RNA-seq library construction, the NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina was used and mRNA enriched using oligo(dT) beads. Constructed cDNA libraries that passed a library quality-control test (comprising Qubit, LabChip fragment analysis and qPCR steps) were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 PE150 platform. The analysis for this Article was generated using Partek Flow software, v.9.0. RNA-seq reads were aligned to the Ensembl release 100 top-level assembly with STAR v.2.7.3a . Gene counts and isoform expression were derived from Ensembl output. Sequencing performance was assessed for the total number of aligned reads, total number of uniquely aligned reads and features detected. Normalization size factors were calculated for all gene counts by median ratio. Differentially expressed gene analysis was then performed using DESeq2 34  method to analyse differences between conditions and the results were filtered for only those genes with  35 P  values ≤ 0.01 and log-transformed fold changes more extreme or equal to ± 2. Gene set enrichment analysis Gene set enrichment analysis  was used to assess differentially expressed Gene Ontologies (GOs) enriched in high- 36 , 37 NLGN3 -expressing tumours compared to low- NLGN3 -expressing tumours. GO classification and enrichment analysis were performed for biological process, cellular component and molecular function ontologies. Statistics and reproducibility Data analyses were performed using Prism GraphPad (v.8.4.1). The normality of each group was determined by Shapiro–Wilk test. Comparisons between two normally distributed groups were analysed using unpaired  t -tests with Welch’s correction. Multiple comparisons among normally distributed groups were analysed using Brown–Forsythe and Welch ANOVA tests with Dunnett’s T3 correction for multiple comparison. Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s correction for multiple comparison was used for comparisons involving data that do not pass the Shapiro–Wilk test. Statistical tests used were indicated in the figure legends with  F  (Brown–Forsythe ANOVA tests) and  P  values. All tests are two-sided, statistical significance was set at  P  ≤ 0.05. All data are presented as mean values with s.e.m. All in vitro experiments have been performed in at least three independent wells for each experiment, and performed at least two independent experiments. The number of biological replicates (mice for in vivo experiments and retina + optic nerve preparations for ex vivo experiments) is indicated in the figure legends, and was always three or greater. For each in vivo result, the experiment was performed independently in at least three litters of mice.

PMID:7985572,Neurofibromatosis type 1: the evolution of deep gray and white matter MR abnormalities.,"PURPOSE: To investigate the evolution of deeply located high-signal-intensity abnormalities of the brain on T2-weighted MR images of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1). METHODS: The study consists of two patient groups: 1) retrospective evaluation of MR scans of 24 symptomatic NF-1 patients, 10 of whom were sequentially studied, and 2) prospective MR evaluations of 20 asymptomatic NF-1 subjects from 14 families; 2 of these families were sequentially studied. RESULTS: Deeply located, high-signal-intensity abnormalities on T2-weighted images were noted in 34 of 44 NF-1 subjects (77%). If NF-1 patients are grouped according to age, 28 of 30 subjects (93%) younger than 15 years had the lesions, whereas 4 of 7 subjects (57%) between 16 and 30 years, and 2 of 7 subjects (29%) older than 31 years had lesions. High-signal lesions in basal ganglia and brain stem were demonstrated in all decades with relatively high frequency. Lesions in the cerebellar white matter and dentate nuclei were mainly found in the patients younger than 10 years, and never found after the third decade. In 13 sequential studies (mean interval, 24 months), lesions appeared to increase in size in 3, remain unchanged in size in 2, and decrease in size in 7. One subject showed a mixed pattern of lesion size change. CONCLUSIONS: Deeply located high-signal-intensity lesions on T2-weighted MR images are more evident in young NF-1 patients. The underlying brain abnormality, while pathologically unproved, is probably transient.",,T Itoh; S Magnaldi; R M White; M B Denckla; K Hofman; S Naidu; R N Bryan,AJNR.

PMID:21949590,ALTERED CALCIUM CURRENTS AND AXONAL GROWTH IN Nf1 HAPLOINSUFFICIENT MICE.,"Mutations of the neurofibromin gene (NF1) cause neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a disease in which learning disabilities are common. Learning deficits also are observed in mice with a heterozygous mutation of Nf1 (Nf1(+/-)). Dysregulation of regulated neurotransmitter release has been observed in Nf1(+/-) mice. However, the role of presynaptic voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels mediating this release has not been investigated. We investigated whether Ca(2+) currents and transmitter release were affected by reduced neurofibromin in Nf1(+/-) mice. Hippocampal Ca(2+) current density was greater in neurons from Nf1(+/-) mice and a greater fraction of Ca(2+) currents was activated at less depolarized potentials. In addition, release of the excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate, was increased in neuronal cortical cultures from Nf1(+/-) mice. Dendritic complexity and axonal length were also increased in neurons Nf1(+/-) mice compared to wild-type neurons, linking loss of neurofibromin to developmental changes in hippocampal axonal/cytoskeletal dynamics. Collectively, these results show that altered Ca(2+) channel density and transmitter release, along with increased axonal growth may account for the abnormal nervous system functioning in NF1.","2. Experimental Procedures 2.1 Primary hippocampal neuronal cultures Procedures involving animals and their care were in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health publication 85-23, Bethesda, MD, USA) and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Indiana University School of Medicine. Mice heterozygous for the  Nf1  mutation on a background of C57BL/6J were originally developed by Dr. Tyler Jacks [ 2 ]. Wildtype C57BL/6J and  Nf1  mice littermates were housed and bred in the Indiana University Laboratory Animal Research Center. Mouse hippocampal neuron cultures were prepared from hippocampi dissected from postnatal day 1 (PN1) wild-type or  +/− Nf1 +/−  mice as described previously [ 14 , 15 ]. Cells were cultured in growth media which consisted of Neurobasal medium containing 2% NuSerum, 5% NS21 [ 16 ], supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin (100 U/ml; 50 μg/ml), 0.1 mM L-Glutamine and 0.4 mML-glutamax (Invitrogen). The antimitotic agent Cytosine β-Darabinofuranoside (5 μM; Sigma) was added 24–36 h after plating to reduce the number of non-neuronal cells. 2.2 Primary cortical neuronal cultures Primary cortical cultures containing both glia and neurons were prepared from PN1 wildtype and  Nf1  mice as described [ +/− 15 ]. Following an aseptic dissection of cerebral cortices, the olfactory bulb and meninges were removed, and cortices were minced and incubated for 20–25 min at 37°C in Papain solution as described above. The enzymatically dissociated tissue was then rinsed twice with Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS) lacking Ca 2+  and Mg 2+ . Cells were dissociated by trituration and isolated as described above for hippocampal neurons. Cells were plated at a density of ~2 hemispheres per three 24-well plates or approximately 250,000 to 300,000 cells. Cells were fed twice a week with growth media (500 μl/well) and at 3–5 days  in vitro  (DIV) they were treated with cytosine β-D-arabinofuranoside (5 μM) to eliminate the dividing glia from the cultures. The cultures were used for release experiments at 7–10 DIV. 2.3 Synaptosome isolation from wild-type and  Nf1  mice +/− Synaptosomes were prepared from brains of juvenile wild-type and  Nf1  mice [ +/− 14 ] and were lysed in NF1 lysis buffer [ 17 ] containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (NP-40/Igepal), and supplemented with freshly added protease and phosphatase inhibitors: 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM PMSF together with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science) and 2 mM sodium orthovanadate. Protein concentration was determined using a BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Shelbyville, IN) and fractions were stored at −80°C until use. 2.4 Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings Whole-cell voltage recordings were performed at room temperature on primary cultured hippocampal neurons using an EPC 10 Amplifier (HEKA Electronics, Germany) as described before [ 14 ]. Electrodes were pulled from thin-walled borosilicate glass capillaries (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) with a P-97 electrode puller (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA) such that final electrode resistances were 2–3 MΩ when filled with internal solutions. The internal solution for recording total Ca 2+  currents contained (in mM): 110 CsCl, 5 MgSO 4 , 10 EGTA, 4 ATP Na 2 -ATP, and 25 HEPES (pH 7.2, 290–310 mOsm/l). The external solution contained (in mM): 128 NaCl, 5 KCl, 10 TEA-Cl, 10 BaCl 2 , 1 MgCl 2 , 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 310–315 mOsm/l). For recording N-type and P/Q-type Ca 2+  currents, 1 μM TTX and 10 μM nifedipine were added just to this solution before use to block voltage-gated Na +  and L-type Ca 2+  channels, respectively. Whole-cell capacitance and series resistance were compensated with the amplifier. Series resistances compensation (70–80%) was routinely applied. Cells were considered only when the seal resistance was more than 1GΩ and the series resistance was less than 10 MΩ. Linear leak currents were digitally subtracted by P/4. Statistical differences between the recordings from the two genotypes were determined by using either a Student’s  t -test or an ANOVA. When a significant difference was obtained with an ANOVA, post hoc analyses were performed using a Tukey test. Values of  p <0.05 were judged to be statistically significant. 2.5 Data acquisition and analysis Signals were filtered at 10 kHz and digitized at 10–20 kHz. Analysis was performed using Fitmaster and origin8.1 (OriginLab Corporation, MA). For activation curves, conductance ( G ) through ion (Na +  and Ca 2+ ) channels was calculated using the equation  G= I/(V , where V m  −V rev ) rev  is the reversal potential, V m  is the membrane potential at which the current was recorded, and  I  is the peak current. Activation and inactivation curves were fitted to a Boltzmann function G/G max  = 1/{1+exp[(V−V 50 /k]}, where G is the peak conductance, G max  is the fitted maximal G, V 50  is the half-activation voltage, and  k  is the slope factor. Additional details of specific pulse protocols are 8 described in the results text or figure legends. The electrophysiologist was blinded to the genotype of the neurons. 2.6 Glutamate release Glutamate released from wild-type and  Nf1  cortical neurons was measured using the Amplex Red glutamic acid/glutsamate oxidase assay kit (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. In this assay, L-glutamic acid is oxidized by glutamate oxidase to produce α-ketoglutarate, NH +/− 3  and H 2 O 2 . H 2 O 2  reacts with the Amplex Red reagent in a 1:1 stoichiometry in a reaction catalyzed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to generate the highly fluorescent product resorufin. After 30 minutes, fluorescence of resorufin was measured in a Victor 3  V multilabel plate reader (Perkin Elmer, Shelton, CT) using excitation at 530 nm and emission at 590 nm. To generate samples, neurons growing in 12-well plates were washed three times (300 μl each) with non-depolarizing buffer (119 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 25 mM HEPES, and 30 mM D-Glucose). A 100 μl sample was collected after the third wash for basal samples. After a 15 minute stimulation with depolarizing buffer (32 mM NaCl, 90 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 25 mM HEPES, and 30 mM D-Glucose), 100 μl of culture supernatant was collected and stored at −20°C. Finally, neurons were bathed in non-depolarizing buffer for 15 min to reestablish resting levels. The non-transportable glutamate transporter inhibitor DL-threo-β-benzyloxyaspartate (DL-TBOA; 500 μM) was present during the stimulation to prevent reuptake of released glutamate [ 18 ]. The remaining glutamate content in each well was determined by exposing the cells to 2% Triton X-100 in non-depolarizing buffer. The glutamate released during the 15 min stimulation period is expressed as percent of the total content. Standard curves for the assay with known concentrations of exogenous glutamate demonstrated high reproducibility and sensitivity of the assay, up to concentrations of 15 fmol glutamate. Standard curves were constructed for each assay. The concentrations of K +  and time period for stimulation were chosen because they lie on the middle of the sloped portion of the concentration response curve for KCl-stimulated glutamate release. In additional control experiments, the general Ca 2+  channel blocker CdCl 2  (500 μM) blocked basal and K + -stimulated glutamate release  (not shown) . A minimum of seven different animals were used for each genotype. 2.7 Morphology analysis: neurite/dendrite outgrowth and Sholl analysis of dendritic complexity Neurite outgrowth was determined from low-density hippocampal neurons transfected with EGFP using Lipofectamine as described [ 14 ]. The morphometric analysis of neurite lengths of transfected green fluorescent cells was performed with Nikon Elements software by measuring neurites from neurons with a process longer than one neuronal cell body diameter [ 19 ]. In hippocampal cultures at 7 DIV, axons extending processes >20 μm at orthogonal angles to the axon were characterized as branches. Additionally, axons were identified by immunolabeling with tau 1 antibodies  (not shown).  Over-expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) facilitated these analyses as EGFP expressing neurons could be optically identified and their axonal arborization could be easily assessed (see  Figure 4A ). Sholl analysis [ 20 ] was performed with ImageJ using an automated Sholl analysis plugin, in which the soma boundary is approximated by an ellipsoid and dendrite intersections are assessed at radial distances from the soma [ 19 ]. This technique measures the number of neurites crossing concentric circles (denoted as intersections or branch points) at various radial distances from the cell soma. This consecutive-circles (cumulative intersection) analysis specifies dendritic geometry, ramification richness, and dendritic branching patterns. The dendritic tree was examined in 10 μm increments. Processes arising from the soma or from higher-order dendritic segments that were shorter than 3 μm were rejected because they could not be distinguished from filopodia. Each neuron that fit these criteria was imaged and analyzed by an investigator blind to the genotype conditions. At least 18 neurons and at least 300 intersections (from ≥4 separate animals) were analyzed, in a blinded manner for each condition. All statistical analysis was performed via parametric and/or nonparametric analyses, as appropriate, with a minimum significance level set at  P <0.05.",Yuying Wang; Joel M Brittain; Sarah M Wilson; Cynthia M Hingtgen; Rajesh Khanna,Translational neuroscience,2010-06,10.2478/v10134-010-0025-8,minimal,True
PMID:37164978,Multiplatform molecular profiling uncovers two subgroups of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors with distinct therapeutic vulnerabilities.,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a highly aggressive sarcoma, and a lethal neurofibromatosis type 1-related malignancy, with little progress made on treatment strategies. Here, we apply a multiplatform integrated molecular analysis on 108 tumors spanning the spectrum of peripheral nerve sheath tumors to identify candidate drivers of MPNST that can serve as therapeutic targets. Unsupervised analyses of methylome and transcriptome profiles identify two distinct subgroups of MPNSTs with unique targetable oncogenic programs. We establish two subgroups of MPNSTs: SHH pathway activation in MPNST-G1 and WNT/ß-catenin/CCND1 pathway activation in MPNST-G2. Single nuclei RNA sequencing characterizes the complex cellular architecture and demonstrate that malignant cells from MPNST-G1 and MPNST-G2 have neural crest-like and Schwann cell precursor-like cell characteristics, respectively. Further, in pre-clinical models of MPNST we confirm that inhibiting SHH pathway in MPNST-G1 prevent growth and malignant progression, providing the rational for investigating these treatments in clinical trials.","Methods Patient samples and clinical annotation Tumor samples and peripheral blood of patients were collected from the University Health Network Brain Tumor Bank (Toronto) and the Mount Sinai Hospital Sarcoma Tumor Bank (Toronto, Canada) under institutional review board (IRB)-approved protocols with patient informed consent. Samples were collected fresh from the patients at the time of surgical resection and stored at −80 °C. Additional samples were obtained from the Children’s Tumor Foundation (CTF, New York, USA). In summary, we used 108 samples in this study (19 MPNSTs, 22 premalignant neurofibromas, 34 plexiform neurofibromas and 33 cutaneous neurofibromas). Pathologic diagnosis was confirmed by at least two experienced pathologists using diagnostic formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded blocks to confirm diagnosis of peripheral nerve sheath tumors and to subtype tumors according to recognized histopathological classifications. Given the tendency for local recurrence and distant metastasis in MPNSTs, PFS was used as the primary outcome of interest in this study. PFS was defined as local tumor growth after gross total resection, tumor progression following subtotal resection, or distant metastasis. Time to recurrence was determined by calculating the elapsed time from the date of index surgery to first postoperative imaging documenting tumor recurrence. DNA and RNA processing DNA was extracted from fresh-frozen tumor tissue and normal tissue using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, USA). Total RNA was isolated from tumor using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, USA). DNA and RNA were quantified using Nanodrop 1000 instrument (Thermo Scientific, USA) and integrity assessed by either agarose gel electrophoresis (DNA) or Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (RNA; Agilent, USA) at the Princess Margaret Cancer Genomics Centre (PMGC, Toronto, Canada). DNA (0.5-1μg) was used for bisulfite treatment (Zymo Research, Irvine, USA). Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis Methylation profiling was performed on bisulfite-treated DNA using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip array (Illumina, San Diego, USA) at the PMGC (Toronto, Canada). Generated raw methylation files were imported and preprocessed with the statistical programming language R using the minfi package (Bioconductor). Data was normalized and failed probes with a detection  P -value threshold > 0.01 were removed from further downstream analysis. Further filtering of the data was performed, as previously described, by removing all probes that fit one of these criteria: (1) probes that overlapped with known single nucleotide polymorphisms, (2) probes located on X and Y chromosomes, or (3) cross-reactive probes. Unsupervised consensus hierarchical clustering was performed with ConsensusClusterPlus package (Bioconductor) on beta values using Euclidean distance and Ward’s linkage method with 1000 resampling steps (epsilon = 0.8). We selected the top 20,000 probes that showed the highest median absolute deviation (MAD) across the ß-values for clustering. The unscaled methylation levels were shown in a heatmap from unmethylated state (purple color) to methylated state (red color). Differentially methylated probes were identified using  limma  based modeling approach (Bioconductor) for the methylation subclasses. Absolute mean β-value difference > 0.1 and adjusted  p -value (FDR-corrected) < 0.05 were considered to be significant. Whole exome sequencing Whole-exome sequencing of 54 PNSTs and 20 matched blood samples was performed by The Centre for Applied Genomics (TCAG, Toronto). Genomic DNA libraries were prepared using Agilent SureSelect Human Exome Library Preparation V5 kit with the Agilent Bravo Automation System and paired end sequencing on a HiSeq 2500 platform to a median of 60X. In brief, read pairs were aligned to the hg19 reference genome using BWA-MEM v 0.7.12  with default parameters. PCR duplicate marking, indel realignment and base quality score recalibration were performed using Picard v1.72 and GATK v3.6.0 40 . We obtained germline variant calls by joint genotyping and variant quality score recalibration on 20 peripheral blood controls, in adherence to the GATK Best Practices framework 41 . Data quality assessment was performed using Picard tool CalculateHSMetrics. We identified somatic mutations using Mutect V1.1.6 42  and Strelka v1.0.13 43  for 20 tumors with matched peripheral blood controls and Mutect2 V1.1 44  for 35 unmatched tumor samples. Variants with allele fractions <10% were removed to control for potential sequencing artifacts. Since we lacked normal control for a subset of samples, putative somatic variants were retained by filtering likely germline variants with GnomAD 43  population frequency >0.01% (r2.0.1). TGL frequency database of variants of <1% were retained to filter out initial passenger events. We annotated variants using Variant Effect Predictor v.92.0 45 , OncoKB Precision Oncology Knowledge Base 46 , CancerHotspots.org 47  and dbNSFP database 48 . Tumor mutational burden is calculated as the fraction of total number of nonsynonymous (protein altering) somatic mutations across the whole exome capture space in Mb. 49 RNA sequencing and analysis The isolated RNA was processed using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA kit with Ribo-Zero Gold Prep kit according to manufacturer’s protocol. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq500 platform with 75-cycle paired-end protocol to obtain minimum 40 million reads. Sequence data was processed and aligned to human reference genome (hg38) using STAR aligner (v.2.6.0) . Next, duplicate reads were removed. Reads were sorted using SamTools (v.1.3) 50 . Gene expression in raw counts for each sample was calculated by the algorithm “featureCounts” in the package Rsubread (v.1.5.0). Data was normalized by counts-per-million (CPM) and then subjected to trimmed means of M (TMM) using edgeR 51  (v.3.22.3). CPM cutoff values were determined empirically by identifying the minimum value required to achieve the best normalization across samples. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) was determined using Quasi-likelihood F-test in EdgeR 52 . Pathway analysis was performed on the DEG from the indicated pairwise analysis using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) package (Broad Institute). 52 Computational FDA drug mapping In order to discover potential therapeutic agents, we used the Enrichment Map App in Cytoscape to perform post-analysis with FDA approved drug targets. A scoring system was formulated to first select drugs by the number of target genes in the leading edge of significant GSEA pathways for indicated comparison. Then each drug was ranked by the number of pathways targeted. Finally, the number of significant genes targeted were divided by the total number of target genes of the drug to assess the specificity. This scoring system selected the drugs targeting the greatest number of driving genes in significant biological pathways with high specificity. The resulting list of drugs were grouped by common targets to produce a high-level summary of the class of drugs with the highest possibility of effective treatment. Fusion calls Fusion genes for cohort of PNSTs were identified using FusionCatcher v1.1.0  with default parameters, which aligns reads to the human reference genome (GRCh38) using Bowtie 53 , 54  (v1.2), Bowtie2 55  (v2.3), Star 56  (v2.7) and BLAT 57  (v0.35). Adjacent and read-through fusions were filtered out from analyses. To reduce false positive detection of genes with similar sequence homology, gene fusions with Counts_of_common_mapping_reads = 0 were selected. 58 Droplet-based single nuclear RNA sequencing and analysis Flash frozen archived tumor specimens were minced with sterile scalpel and mechanically dissociated with a dounce tissue grinder (size A and B, Sigma Aldrich) in ice cold lysis buffer (0.32 M sucrose, 5 mM CaCl2, 3 mM MgAc2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 40U/ml RNase inhibitor and 0.1% Triton X-100 in DEPC-treated water). Homogenized tissues was centrifuged at 800 ×  g  for 10 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 1 m of wash buffer (1× PBS, 1% BSA and 0.2 U/μl RNase Inhibitor). Nuclei were filtered twice in 40 μm strainers (Flowmi cell strainer, Sigma Aldrich). Isolated nuclei were stained with DAPI at concentrations suggested by the manufacturer and sorted by FACS (BD Influx BRV, Becton Dickinson Biosciences). Nuclei were collected, washed and resuspended in wash buffer. Nuclei were counted and appropriate volume for each sample was calculated for a target capture of 6000 nuclei. Samples were loaded onto a 10× Chromium controller using the Chromium Single Cell 3’ Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10× Genomics). After droplet generation, Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq (10x specific protocol) with >50, 000 reads per cell. CellRanger (10× Genomics) analysis pipeline was used for library demultiplexing, read alignment to human genome GRCh38 and UMI quantification per gene per cell. High-quality cells with >1500 unique genes detected and <1.5% reads attributed to mitochondrial transcripts were retained. Genes detected in less than three cells were removed. The raw gene expression matrix was normalized, and variance stabilized by SCTransform in Suerat version 3.0 using UMI count and percent reads aligned to mitochondrial transcripts as covariates (Stuart et al. 2018). Principal component analysis was performed using highly variable genes (FDR < 0.001) identified by scran and the number of significant principal components (PC,10) were determined based on the inflection point of the “scree” plot. Principle components were corrected for batch effect using Harmony (v.01) . The first 10 PC spaces were used to build a shared-nearest-neighbor graph. Clusters were identified by optimizing the modularity function within its space with a resolution set to 0.1 and clustering results were visualized using t-SNE of the selected principal components. 59 scRNA-seq pseudotime analysis Pseudotime analysis was performed as previously described  using Monocle2 60 . Briefly, raw UMI counts from the cleaned and processed Seurat objects was used to generate CellDataSet objects by normalizing the data using a negative binomial distribution with fixed variance. The CellDataSet object was processed to estimate sequencing depth (estimateSizeFactors), gene dispersions (estimateDispersions) and per-cell coverage. The data was further filtered to keep high-quality cells with >500 genes. In addition, genes were filtered to retain genes present in greater than 10 cells. The DDRTree algorithm included with Monocle2 was used to reduce the dataset two dimensions and the marker genes that differentiated the clusters were used to guide the trajectory inference. Relative pseudotime was generated through a linear transformation relative to the cells with the lowest and highest pseudotimes. 61 Cell type classification Cells were assigned to different cell types based on a consensus of (1) similarity of expression profiles, (2) copy number profiles and (3) expression of canonical markers. First, unsupervised hierarchical Pearson clustering with Ward linkages on the matrix of correlation was performed to correlate the expression profile of each cell to every other cell. Two major clusters of putative neoplastic and non-neoplastic cells were identified. Second, CNAs of neoplastic and non-neoplastic cells were inferred from the snRNA-seq data using inferCNV (v.1.1.1) . After the genes were ordered according to the human GRCh38 assembly, a heatmap illustrating relative expression intensities of neoplastic nuclei to reference population across the genome was generated for visualization. Almost all neoplastic clusters harbored multiple CNAs throughout the genome, while the non-neoplastic cells were generally lacking CNAs. Finally, FindAllMarkers in Seurat was used to identify differentially expressed genes in each cluster, which were then inspected for canonical immune and stromal cell markers. 62 Cell viability assay Immortalized human Schwann cell (HSC1λ) and immortalized neurofibroma cell (ipNF06.2A ) were obtained from Dr. Margaret Wallace’s laboratory at the University of Florida. MPNST cell lines (STS-26T 30 , S462 63 , S462TY, T265 64 ) were obtained from Dr. David Largaespada’s laboratory at the University of Minnesota. All cell lines were cultured with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Wisent Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Wisent Technologies) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO 65 2 . For direct cell counting, 1 × 10 5  cells were plated in triplicates into 6 well plates in 2 ml of medium. After incubation times (days 1–5), cells were collected and analyzed for cell count and cell viability. Cells were directly counted using Trypan blue and the Beckman Coulter Vi-CELL (12-sample carousel) Cell Viability Analyzer (Beckman Coulter). IC50 assays were performed in 96 wells by seeding 5000 cells in triplicate overnight. Cells were treated with sonidegib (NVP-LDE225, Selleck Chemicals) the following day with increasing drug concentrations and read by CellTitre-Glo luminescent cell viability assay in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega, G7570) on a 96-well plate reader (GloMax-96 microplate luminometer; Promega). CRISPR/Cas9 knockout cell line preparation Guide RNA oligo sequences were generated using CRISPR-Cas9 Design Tool ( www.crispr.mit.edu/ ). The guide RNA sequences chosen had the least number of potential off-target sites predicted by the CRISPR-Cas9 Design Tool. To generate CRISPR/Cas9-modified ipNF06.2A cell lines, sequences were subcloned into pX330: gGFP;5’-GGATACTTCTTCGAACGTTT, gPTCH1;5’-TGCTTTTAATCCCACCGCGA. Cells were co-transfected with one pX330 construct and pRNAT-H1.3 (Hygro) control plasmid expressing GFP and hygromycin resistance genes. ipNF06.2A-gPTCH1 and ipNF06.2A-gCTRL cells were selected with hygromycin and monoclonal lines were screened. CRISPR/Cas9-modified HSC1λ cell lines were generated using lentiviral transduction of  Cas9  and a guide RNA: gGFP; 5’- CACCGAGCTGGACGGCGACGTAAAG, gPTCH1;5’- GCCTATGGCGCGGCAGACCACCCAC, gAPC;5’CACCGAACAGCATCGAGCCAACCTCACCGCCGAGCAGCGGCTAGGCTTCCACCGAAGCCTAGCCGCTGCTCGGCACCGCCGGAAGCCTAGCCGCTGCT. Lentiviral particles were produced in 293T cells with viral packaging plasmids. After 24 h, the viral supernatant was collected and added to adherent HSC1λ cells, supplemented with 6 μg/ml polybrene. After lentiviral transduction, cells with the correct construct were selected with 2 μg/ml puromycin. Genotype was confirmed with PCR and sequencing. These cells were grown in media with puromycin supplemented through all downstream applications. Western blot Traditional western blots were performed using standard protocols. Primary antibodies for B-Actin(1:1000, Cat #8457S, Cell Signaling Technologies), Vinculin(1:30000, Cat #V9264, Sigma Aldrich), PTCH1(1:500,Cat#MAB41051, R&D systems) and APC(1:500, Cat #15270, Abcam) were used. Knock out HSC1λ cell line genotypes were confirmed with capillary electrophoresis-western blot using a WES capillary electrophoresis device (ProteinSimple, San Jose, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Primary antibodies against B-Actin (Cell Signaling Technologies #8457S, 1:10), PTCH1 (Cell Signaling Technologies #2468, 1:10), GLI1 (Cell Signaling Technologies #3538, 1:10). Anchorage independent growth assay 6-well plates (Corning) were prepared with bottom agar (3.2%) and top agar (0.48%) composed of low melting point agarose in DMEM full media. The bottom agar was allowed to solidify before 10,000 cells in top agar were plated and allowed to solidify. DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS and 2 ug/ml puromycin was plated over the cells in the 6-well plates and incubated under standard conditions. After 14 days, top media were removed, and cells were fixed in 10% formalin (Fisher Scientific) containing 0.0005% crystal violet (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. Colonies were imaged on Leica S8 AP0 microscope with 12 images per cell line. Automated colony counts were done using ImageJ software  using TKS Batch Count Colonies macro (courtesy of StarrLab). Results shown are a representative example of at least 3 independent experiments. 66 Transwell migration assay Cell migration assays were performed using Transwell inserts with 8 μm pore size polycarbonate membranes (Corning). Briefly, cells were resuspended in serum free media and 1000 cells were seeded into inserts. The lower chamber for each well was set up with 500 μl of media supplemented with 10% FBS as a chemoattractant. After 24 h, the cells on upper membrane surface were removed mechanically. The membranes were then fixed with 0.1% crystal violet for 15 min and then mounted on slides. The number of migrating cells were observed with brightfield microscope, and manually counted. Xenograft models All animal procedures were carried out according to animal use protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care Committee. Immunodeficient NOD- Rag1 
 null IL2rg  mice (The Jackson Laboratory) received approximately 3 million cells via subcutaneous flank injection. Cells were in media and Matrigel in a 1:1 ratio. Mice were injected with HSC1λ gGFP ( null n  = 4), HSC1λ gPTCH1 ( n  = 4), HSC1λ NF1 −/−  gPTCH1 ( n  = 4), HSC1λ NF1 −/−  ( n  = 12), HSC1λ gGFP ( n  = 4), HSC1λ gAPC ( n  = 4). Mice were monitored daily. Mice were sacrificed 4 months post-injection and tumors were harvested. For the sonidegib drug treatment, non-obese diabetic severe combined immune deficiency spontaneous male mice (NOD-SCID-Prkdc scid ) received 5 × 10 6  cells via subcutaneous flank injection. Mice were randomly selected to receive S462TY (10 mice) or STS-26T cells (10 mice). Cells were in a 1:1 media and Matrigel suspension. On day 14, mice were treated with sonidegib (Sellekchem) dissolved in vehicle (PEG 400/5% dextrose in water), at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day, or with vehicle alone. Mice were monitored daily, and tumor size was measured with calipers. Mice were sacrificed when they reached end point (tumor size >1.5 cm in any one dimension).

PMID:25772366,Mouse low-grade gliomas contain cancer stem cells with unique molecular and functional properties.,"The availability of adult malignant glioma stem cells (GSCs) has provided unprecedented opportunities to identify the mechanisms underlying treatment resistance. Unfortunately, there is a lack of comparable reagents for the study of pediatric low-grade glioma (LGG). Leveraging a neurofibromatosis 1 (Nf1) genetically engineered mouse LGG model, we report the isolation of CD133(+) multi-potent low-grade glioma stem cells (LG-GSCs), which generate glioma-like lesions histologically similar to the parent tumor following injection into immunocompetent hosts. In addition, we demonstrate that these LG-GSCs harbor selective resistance to currently employed conventional and biologically targeted anti-cancer agents, which reflect the acquisition of new targetable signaling pathway abnormalities. Using transcriptomic analysis to identify additional molecular properties, we discovered that mouse and human LG-GSCs harbor high levels of Abcg1 expression critical for protecting against ER-stress-induced mouse LG-GSC apoptosis. Collectively, these findings establish that LGG cancer stem cells have unique molecular and functional properties relevant to brain cancer treatment.","Experimental Procedures Mice All strains were generated ( Supplemental Experimental Procedures ), maintained on a C57BL/6 background, and used in accordance with an approved Animal Studies protocol at Washington University. Athymic (B6.Cg/NTac- Foxn1nu  NE10) mice were purchased from Taconic Laboratories. Primary NSC isolation and culture Optic chiasm was microdissected from 3-month-old  Nf1 flox/flox ,  Nf1 +/− and  Nf1 +/− GFAP CKO mice to generate primary optic nerve neurospheres. TVZ NSCs were established from the third ventricle of 3-month-old  Nf1 flox/flox  and  Nf1+/−  mice. NSC cultures and proliferation assays were performed as previously described ( Lee da et al., 2010 ). Wild-type and  Nf1 −/− NSCs were generated from  Nf1 flox/flox  mouse brains following infection with Ad5-LacZ and Ad5-Cre adenovirus (University of Iowa Gene Transfer Core, Iowa City, IA), respectively. Loss of neurofibromin protein was confirmed by Western blotting. All  in vitro  experiments were performed at least three times using primary NSC generated using mice from different litters, and independently transduced with the respective constructs ( Table S3 ). Human tumor spheres Human PA and GBM specimens were obtained from the Children’s Discovery Institute Tumor Bank at the Washington University School of Medicine, and used under an approved Human Studies Protocol. Fresh human tumor specimens were minced into small pieces and dissociated in accutase at 37°C. Single cells were obtained and cultured in tumor sphere media (TSM) containing Neurobasal-A media supplemented with Glutamax, EGF (20ng/ml), FGF (20ng/ml), leukemia inhibitory factor (20ng/ml), N2, B-27, and heparin (20ng/ml). Additional human PA and GBM paraffin sections were used from available clinical materials under an approved Human Studies Protocol. Multi-lineage differentiation Neurospheres were trypsinized and plated onto 24 well plates coated with poly-D-lysine (50 μg/ml) and fibronectin (10 μg/ml) in defined NSC medium containing N2, B27 and 1% FBS without growth factors. After 6 days, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with antibodies against Tuj-1 (neuron), O4 (oligodendrocyte) and GFAP (astrocyte). The primary antibodies used are listed in  Table S4 . Lentivirus infections Abcg1  shRNA or control shGFP-containing pLKO.1 plasmid was co-transfected with pMDLg/pRRE, pRSV-REV and pCMV-VSV-G into HEK293T cells using the FuGENEHD transfection reagent (Roche). o-GSCs were dissociated into single cells by trypsin and transduced with viral supernatants from HEK293T cells. The knockdown efficiency of the  Abcg1  shRNA constructs was evaluated by Western blotting. Western blotting Western blotting was performed as previously reported ( Lee da et al., 2010 ) using the primary antibodies listed in  Table S4 . Intracranial injections Injections were performed as previously described ( Kaul et al., 2012 ). 2.5 to 3-week-old  Nf1 +/− and athymic ( nu/nu ) mice were used for these experiments. o-GSCs were implanted intracranially into the right side brainstem using a stereotactic device (coordinates = posterior 4.8 mm from the bregma, lateral 0.7 mm (right), and depth 4.5 from dura mater). Mice were euthanized 6 months later. Immunostaining Paraffin or frozen sections were processed ( Dasgupta and Gutmann, 2005 ) prior to staining with appropriate antibodies ( Table S4 ). Microarray analysis Mouse optic glioma neurospheres,  Nf1−/−  TVZ NSCs (TVZ_Cre) and wild-type TVZ NSCs (TVZ_LacZ) RNA was subjected to Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array hybridization, and the resulting data analyzed using Partex Genomics Suite Version 6.6 beta. These data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ ; accession number=  GSE58260 ). Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) Real-time qRT-PCR was performed as previously described ( Yeh et al., 2009 ) using the primers listed in  Table S5 . For each gene, the ΔΔCT values were calculated for each gene.  H3f3a  was used as an internal control. Statistical analysis Each experiment was performed with samples from at least three independent groups. Statistical significance was set at P<0.05 using the Student’s  t -test.",Yi-Hsien Chen; Lucy D'Agostino McGowan; Patrick J Cimino; Sonika Dahiya; Jeffrey R Leonard; Da Yong Lee; David H Gutmann,Cell reports,2015-03-24,10.1016/j.celrep.2015.02.041,minimal,True
PMID:11433044,Quantification of splice variants using real-time PCR.,"A reliable and robust method for measuring the expression of alternatively spliced transcripts is an important step in investigating the significance of each variant. So far, accurate quantification of splice variants has been laborious and difficult due to the intrinsic limitations of conventional methods. The many advantages of real-time PCR have made this technique attractive to study its application in quantification of splice isoforms. We use skipping of exon 37 in the NF1 gene as a model to compare and evaluate the different strategies for quantitating splice variants using real-time PCR. An overview of three different possibilities for detecting alternative transcripts is given. We propose the use of a boundary-spanning primer to quantify isoforms that differ greatly in abundance. We describe here a novel method for creating a reliable standard curve using one plasmid containing both alternative transcripts. In addition, we validate the use of an absolute standard curve based on a dilution series of fluorometrically quantified PCR products.",,I I Vandenbroucke; J Vandesompele; A D Paepe; L Messiaen,Nucleic acids research,2001-07-01,10.1093/nar/29.13.e68,abstract_only,False
PMID:18800150,Mechanisms of loss of heterozygosity in neurofibromatosis type 1-associated plexiform neurofibromas.,"Plexiform neurofibromas constitute a serious burden for patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a common autosomal dominant disorder characterized by pigmentary changes and tumorous skin lesions (neurofibromas). Despite the prominence of these benign tumors in NF1 patients, the mechanisms underlying the tumor-associated loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in plexiform neurofibromas have not been extensively studied. We performed LOH analysis on 43 plexiform neurofibromas from 31 NF1 patients, the largest study of its kind to date. A total of 13 (30%) plexiform neurofibromas exhibited LOH involving 17q markers. In three tumors, LOH was found to be confined to the NF1 gene region. However, in none of the tumors was a somatic NF1 microdeletion, mediated by non-allelic homologous recombination between either NF1-REPs or SUZ12 genes, detected. Thus, NF1 microdeletions do not appear to be frequent somatic events in plexiform neurofibromas. Determination of NF1 gene copy number by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification indicated that although tumors with smaller regions of LOH were characterized by 17q deletions, no NF1 gene copy number changes were detected in six plexiform neurofibromas with more extensive LOH. To our knowledge, mitotic recombination has not previously been reported to be a frequent cause of LOH in plexiform neurofibromas.",,Katharina Steinmann; Lan Kluwe; Reinhard E Friedrich; Victor-Felix Mautner; David N Cooper; Hildegard Kehrer-Sawatzki,The Journal of investigative dermatology,2009-03,10.1038/jid.2008.274,abstract_only,False
PMID:18953429,"The neurofibromatosis 2 tumor suppressor gene product, merlin, regulates human meningioma cell growth by signaling through YAP.","Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the occurrence of schwannomas and meningiomas. Several studies have examined the ability of the NF2 gene product, merlin, to function as a tumor suppressor in diverse cell types; however, little is known about merlin growth regulation in meningiomas. In Drosophila, merlin controls cell proliferation and apoptosis by signaling through the Hippo pathway to inhibit the function of the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie. The Hippo pathway is conserved in mammals. On the basis of these observations, we developed human meningioma cell lines matched for merlin expression to evaluate merlin growth regulation and investigate the relationship between NF2 status and Yes-associated protein (YAP), the mammalian homolog of Yorkie. NF2 loss in meningioma cells was associated with loss of contact-dependent growth inhibition, enhanced anchorage-independent growth and increased cell proliferation due to increased S-phase entry. In addition, merlin loss in both meningioma cell lines and primary tumors resulted in increased YAP expression and nuclear localization. Finally, siRNA-mediated reduction of YAP in NF2-deficient meningioma cells rescued the effects of merlin loss on cell proliferation and S-phase entry. Collectively, these results represent the first demonstration that merlin regulates cell growth in human cancer cells by suppressing YAP.",,Katherine Striedinger; Scott R VandenBerg; Gilson S Baia; Michael W McDermott; David H Gutmann; Anita Lal,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",2008-11,10.1593/neo.08642,abstract_only,False
PMID:23535903,"Canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling drives human schwann cell transformation, progression, and tumor maintenance.","Genetic changes required for the formation and progression of human Schwann cell tumors remain elusive. Using a Sleeping Beauty forward genetic screen, we identified several genes involved in canonical Wnt signaling as potential drivers of benign neurofibromas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). In human neurofibromas and MPNSTs, activation of Wnt signaling increased with tumor grade and was associated with downregulation of β-catenin destruction complex members or overexpression of a ligand that potentiates Wnt signaling, R-spondin 2 (RSPO2). Induction of Wnt signaling was sufficient to induce transformed properties in immortalized human Schwann cells, and downregulation of this pathway was sufficient to reduce the tumorigenic phenotype of human MPNST cell lines. Small-molecule inhibition of Wnt signaling effectively reduced the viability of MPNST cell lines and synergistically induced apoptosis when combined with an mTOR inhibitor, RAD-001, suggesting that Wnt inhibition represents a novel target for therapeutic intervention in Schwann cell tumors.","Methods Mouse Tumor Immunohistochemistry (IHC) Formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissues were sectioned at 5 microns, mounted, and heat-fixed onto glass slides to be used for IHC analyses. Briefly, the glass section slides were de-waxed and rehydrated through a gradual decrease in ethanol concentration. The antigen epitopes on the tissue sections were then unmasked using a commercially available unmasking solution (Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The tissue section slides were then treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide to remove endogenous peroxidases. Blocking was performed at room temperature in normal goat serum (5% serum in PBS) in a humidified chamber for one hour. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4°C in a humidified chamber with primary antibody (β-catenin, 1:100, Cell Signaling). After primary incubation, sections were washed thoroughly in PBS before incubating with goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugated-secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After 3 washes with PBS, the sections were treated with freshly prepared DAB substrate (Vector Laboratories) and allowed to develop before stopping the reaction in water once adequate signal was obtained. Finally, sections were then lightly counter-stained with hematoxylin, dehydrated through gradual increase in ethanol concentration, cleared in Citrosol (Fisher Scientific) and mounted in Permount (Fisher Scientific). Tissue culture reagents and cell lines Cultured immortalized Schwann cells (iHSC1λ and iHSC2λ) were both derived from a patient’s normal sciatic nerve, are  NF1  wild-type, and were immortalized by  hTERT  and  CDK4  to allow  R24C in vitro  studies (Dr. Margaret Wallace, manuscript in preparation). Immortalized human Schwann cell and MPNST cell lines (S462 ( 45 ), S462-TY ( 35 ), ST8814 ( 46 ), T265 ( 47 ), and STS-26T ( 36 )) were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modification of Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin (Cellgro) and cultured on tissue culture-treated plates under standard conditions of 37 degrees Celsius and 5% CO2. No authentication of cell lines were done by the authors. Immunofluorescence and TUNEL staining For immunofluorescence assays, cells were grown to 80% confluency on 8 chambered slides (Lab-TekII). Cells were fixed in 10% formalin and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST). Cells were incubated in β-catenin primary antibody (1:100, Cell Signaling) at 4 degrees Celsius overnight, followed by 1 hour room temperature incubation in anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 488 secondary antibody (Invitrogen). TUNEL staining was performed using the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, POD (Roche). Slides were mounted using Prolong Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen) and images using a Zeiss Axiovert 25 inverted microscope. For analysis of cell death, total cells and TUNEL positive cells were counted and averaged over three independent frames with 50–100 cells per frame. Western blot analysis 1 million cells were lysed using an NP-40 buffer (50mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 150mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 5mM NaF, 1mM EDTA) containing a protease inhibitor (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma). Whole cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation. Protein samples were prepared in an SDS solution with reducing agent (Invitrogen) and run on 10% Bis-Tris pre-made gels (NuPage, Invitrogen). Gels were transferred onto PVDF membranes using the iBlot system (Invitrogen) and activated in 100% methanol. Membranes were blocked in filtered 5% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) for 2 hours at room temp followed by a 4 degrees Celsius overnight incubation in primary antibody. The primary antibodies used in this study were activated β-catenin (1:1000), total β-catenin (1:100), GSK3B (1:1000), AXIN1 (1:1000), and GAPDH (1:2000) (Cell Signaling). Following primary antibody incubation, membranes were thoroughly washed in TBS with 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) and incubated in goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz, 1:4000 in 0.5% BSA, 1 hour at room temperature). Blots were thoroughly washed in TBST and developed using the SuperSignal WestPico Chemiluminescence Detection Kit (Thermo Scientific). Densitometry quantification was done using ImageJ software and normalized to GAPDH ( 48 )( 48 ). Microarray gene expression analysis We used the published data (GEO accession #: GSE14038 , Affymetrix GeneChip HU133 Plus 2.0) [ 38 ] for gene microarray analysis. This dataset used custom CDF (custom GeneChip library file) based on RefSeq target definitions (Hs133P REFSEQ Version 8) for accurate interpretation of GeneChip data ( 49 ). The dataset in  Figure 2  includes 86 microarrays on purified human Schwann cells and primary tissues taken from a normal sciatic nerve, dermal neurofibromas, plexiform neurofibromas, and MPNST cell lines. The heatmap was generated using CRAN's pheatmap package ( http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pheatmap/index.html ) and Refseq IDs were replaced with corresponding HGNC official gene symbols. Statistical comparisons were done using R/Bioconductor's Limma package ( http://www.bioconductor.org ) and GeneSpring GXv7.3.1 (Agilent Technologies). Differentially expressed (DE)-genes were defined as genes with expression levels at least three-fold higher or lower in target groups (MPNST) compared to NHSC after applying Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate correction (FDR/BH p ≤ 0.05). Tumor microarray (TMA) construction and immunohistochemistry Representative areas of disease were identified on hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections for 30 neurofibromas, 32 plexiform neurofibromas, and 31 MPNSTs. TMA blocks consisting of duplicate 1.0 mm core samples were constructed with a manual tissue arrayer (MTA-1, Beecher Inc, WI) and limited to 64 cores per recipient block. Immunohistochemistry for CCND1 (SP4) monoclonal antibody (Neomarkers, Thermo Scientific, 1:50) and β-catenin (6B3) monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling; 1:200) was performed utilizing an automated immunohistochemical staining platform (Nemesis 7200, Biocare) following standard IHC protocols ( 50 ). Digital images of IHC stained TMA slides were obtained as previously described by Rizzardi et al. 2012 ( 51 )( 51 ). P-values were determined using a 3×2 (staining positivity) or 3×3 (staining intensity or localization) Fisher’s Exact Test to determine differences in staining between the three tumor types. Gene knockdown and overexpression GSK3B  and  Luciferase  cDNA (Invitrogen) were each cloned into a vector containing a  CAGGS  promoter to drive cDNA expression followed by an  IRES-GFP . These plasmid vectors were transfected into cells using the NEON transfection system, according to manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen). Three independent shRNAs targeting  AXIN1, GSK3B, CTNNB1, TNKS ,  RSPO2,  and a non-silencing (NS) control shRNA were purchased from OpenBiosystems. Lentiviral particles containing the shRNAs were produced in 293T cells using the Trans-Lentiviral Packaging Kit (Thermo Scientific). A  dsRed  control and  CTNNB1  were cloned into a vector containing a  S33Y CAGGS  promoter to drive cDNA expression followed by an  IRES-GFP  and also transduced into cells using lentiviral particles. Viral supernatant was collected after 24 hours of viral production, cleared, and applied directly to the cells for 6 hours. Following viral transduction, cells underwent selection in 4ug/mL puromycin (Invitrogen). shRNA expression was validated by GFP expression, western blot and QPCR. Data is shown for the one shRNA construct that gave the greatest knockdown as determined by western blot analysis and/or QPCR. Quantitative Real-Time PCR (QPCR) RNA was extracted from 1 million cells using the High Pure RNA Isolation Kit (Roche). RNA was analyzed by nanodrop (Thermo Scientific) and by agarose gel electrophoresis for quantification and quality control. 1ug of RNA was used to synthesize cDNA using the Transcriptor First Strand Synthesis (Roche) with both random hexamer and oligo dT primers. QPCR reactions were conducted using LightCycler 480 SYBR I Green (Roche) and run on an Eppendorf Mastercycler ep gradient S. Primer sequences can be found in  Supplementary Table 2  ( 21 , 52 , 53 ). Data were analyzed using RealPlex software, calibrated to  ACTB  levels and normalized to either over-expression control cells (expressing  CAGGS>Luciferase-IRES-GFP or dsRed ) or NS shRNA expressing cells and averaged over three experimental replicates. Cellular Viability assays Cellular viability assays were set up in a 96-well format with 100 cells plated per well in DMEM full media containing 4ug/mL puromycin (Invitrogen). Readings were taken every 24 hours over 6 days by the MTS assay (Promega). Absorbance was read at 490nm to determine viability and 650nm to account for cellular debris on a BioTek Synergy Mx automated plate reader. Anchorage-independent growth assay 6-well plates were prepared with bottom agar composed of 3.2% SeaPlaque Agar (Lonza) in DMEM full media) and allowed to solidify before 10,000 cells in top agar (0.8% SeaPlaque Agar in DMEM full media) were plated and allowed to solidify. DMEM full media with 4ug/mL puromycin (Invitrogen) was plated over the cells and cells were incubated under standard conditions (5% CO2, 37 degrees Celsius) for 14 days. Top media was removed and cells were fixed in 10% formalin (Fisher Scientific) containing 0.005% crystal violet (Sigma) for 1 hour at room temperature. Formalin was removed and colonies were imaged on a Leica S8 AP0 microscope. 12 images per cell line were taken and automated colony counts were done using ImageJ software ( 48 )( 48 ). Results shown are a representative example of at least three independent experiments. Xenografts 1.5 million cells in serum-free DMEM with 33% Matrigel Basement Membrane (BD Biosciences) were injected into the back flanks of athymic  Foxn1  mice (Charles Rivers Laboratory). Each mouse was injected on the right flank with cells expressing a specific shRNA or a cDNA and on the left flank with control cell lines expressing a non-silencing (NS) shRNA or a  nu/nu Luciferase  cDNA with at least 4 mice per experiment. Tumor volume was measured bi-weekly using calipers and mice were sacrificed when the tumor reached approximately 10% of the total body weight or 40 days post injection. Tumors were harvested for immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. All animal work was conducted according to the University of Minnesota’s approved animal welfare protocol. In Vitro Drug Studies to Determine IC50 RAD-001, IWR-1, and XAV-939 were solubilized in DMSO and then subsequently diluted in sterile PBS. 1,200 cells per well of a 96-well plate were treated with varying concentration of drug in quadruplicate and assayed for cell viability using the MTS assay (Promega) to determine the IC50 values. All data analysis was done using Calcusyn software (CalcuSyn Version 2.1, BioSoft).",Adrienne L Watson; Eric P Rahrmann; Branden S Moriarity; Kwangmin Choi; Caitlin B Conboy; Andrew D Greeley; Amanda L Halfond; Leah K Anderson; Brian R Wahl; Vincent W Keng; Anthony E Rizzardi; Colleen L Forster; Margaret H Collins; Aaron L Sarver; Margaret R Wallace; Stephen C Schmechel; Nancy Ratner; David A Largaespada,Cancer discovery,2013-06,10.1158/2159-8290.CD-13-0081,minimal,True
PMID:38173515,Development of a semi-automatic segmentation technique based on mean magnetic resonance imaging intensity thresholding for volumetric quantification of plexiform neurofibromas.,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) are peripheral nerve tumors that occur in 25-50 % of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. PNs may have complex, diffused, and irregular shapes. The objective of this work was to develop a volumetric quantification method for PNs as clinical assessment is currently based on unidimensional measurement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A semi-automatic segmentation technique based on mean magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) intensity thresholding (SSTMean) was developed and compared to a similar and previously published technique based on minimum image intensity thresholding (SSTMini). The performance (volume and computation time) of the two techniques was compared to manual tracings of 15 tumors of different locations, shapes, and sizes. Performance was also assessed using different MRI sequences. Reproducibility was assessed by inter-observer analysis. RESULTS: When compared to manual tracing, quantification performed with SSTMean was not significantly different (mean difference: 1.2 %), while volumes computed by SSTMini were significantly different (p < .0001, mean difference: 13.4 %). Volumes quantified by SSTMean were also significantly different than the ones assessed by SSTMini (p < .0001). Using SSTMean, volumes quantified with short TI inversion recovery, T1-, and T2-weighted imaging were not significantly different. Computation times used by SSTMean and SSTMini were significantly lower than for manual segmentation (p < .0001). The highest difference measured by two users was 8 cm CONCLUSION: Our method showed accuracy compared to a current gold standard (manual tracing) and reproducibility between users. The refined segmentation threshold and the possibility to define multiple regions-of-interest to initiate segmentation may have contributed to its performance. The versatility and speed of our method may prove useful to better monitor volumetric changes in lesions of patients enrolled in clinical trials to assessing response to therapy.","Materials and methods A semi-automatic segmentation technique based on mean magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) intensity thresholding (SSTMean) was developed and compared to a similar and previously published technique based on minimum image intensity thresholding (SSTMini). The performance (volume and computation time) of the two techniques was compared to manual tracings of 15 tumors of different locations, shapes, and sizes. Performance was also assessed using different MRI sequences. Reproducibility was assessed by inter-observer analysis. 2 Material and methods 2.1 Patients Fifteen patients diagnosed with PNs were selected to assess the performance of the SSTMean and SSTMini methods. These patients were enrolled as part of an ongoing clinical trial with trametinib (NIH clinical trial # NCT03363217 ) [ 23 ]. The study (#MP-21-2018-1742) was approved by the institutional review board of our institution. Parental written informed consent was obtained for each patient. For this study, patients were selected based on the shape, location, and size of their tumors to represent a heterogeneous set of lesions in different organs, representative of a variety of clinical scenarios.  Supplementary Fig. 1  shows each tumor in the three orientations using either T1-weighted, T2-weighted, or short TI inversion recovery (STIR) images (except for Patients 6, 8 and 12 where MRI images were not prescribed in the sagittal plane). MRI imaging may have been performed with gadolinium. 2.2 Data acquisition Based on the clinical MRI protocol, PNs were imaged with STIR, T1-and T2-weighted imaging sequences. Imaging parameters and sequences depended on the location, shape and size of the tumor and were not identical for all patients. Imaging parameters for STIR were: repetition time (TR, ms) = [2681–5716], echo time (TE, ms) = [23–65], inversion time (TI, ms) = [120−170], and slice number = [18–78]. For T1-weighted imaging, TR = [5–3000] ms, TE = [1–107] ms, and slice number = [20–75]. For T2-weighted imaging, TR = [1328–5880] ms, TE = [60−221] ms, and slice number = [34–83]. 2.3 Segmentation technique The SSTMean method consisted of 4 main steps that were implemented in a Matlab script (Version 9.9.0, Natick, MA). (1) Selection of the region-of-interest (ROI): This process was initiated by loading MRI image files (in PNG format) and selecting the sequence of interest (STIR, T1-or T2-weighted) and the orientation (axial, coronal, or sagittal). For each slice, a region was drawn by the operator using a drawing tool, which further generated a circular ROI around the lesion. This tracing allowed the algorithm to exclude healthy tissue surrounding the tumor as in previous works [ 8 , 17 ] To optimize the segmentation performance, the ROI was defined to maximize the lesion areas and minimize the healthy tissue content. For images with no tumoral tissue, no ROI was necessary. The tool also allowed the operator to trace multiple overlapping or separate ROIs when tumors appeared in multiple disconnected locations on the same slice (see an example in  Supplementary Fig. 2 ), which was not specified in previous tools [ 8 , 17 ]. (2) Smoothing of the lesion boundaries: In the ROI, a filtering method was applied to detect the edges (boundaries) of the lesion. As in previous studies [ 8 , 17 ], a Gaussian smoothing filter with standard deviation σ = 0.5 was used and applied in both the horizontal and vertical directions to reduce the noise level of the image. (3) Automatic calculation of the intensity threshold: As in previous algorithms [ 8 , 17 ], a histogram of the ROI signal intensity was performed to delineate pixels corresponding to the tumor and pixels associated with healthy tissue (see an example in  Supplementary Fig. 2 ). On STIR and T2-weighted images, pixels corresponding to the tumor were typically hyperintense while for T1-weighted, they were hypointense [ 24 ]. The algorithm performed the following steps to determine the image intensity threshold to differentiate healthy and tumoral tissues: 1) plot the ROI signal intensity histogram using 256 intensity bins, 2) calculate the mean of the ROI signal intensity histogram and divide it by two, 3) ensure that this value is located between the two local maxima of the image (associated with healthy and tumoral tissues, respectively), and 4) assign this value as the image intensity threshold for this slice and ROI (e.g., see the red threshold in  Supplementary Fig. 2A  and its corresponding segmentation in  Supplementary Fig. 2D ). Except for the segmentation threshold based on the mean image intensity (step 2), these steps were similar to previous tools [ 8 , 17 ]. (4) Generation of the lesion mask: A binary mask was generated with pixels corresponding to values above the threshold [ 8 , 17 ]. This step also allowed the generation of a mask that included multiple tumors. For granular tumors, the mask may include healthy tissues distributed and diffused between the tumoral aggregate. For multiple ROIs, individual masks were subsequently merged to yield a global binary mask, which was not described in previous works [ 8 , 17 ]. To segment the tumors with the SSTMini method, the image intensity threshold defined in step 3 was modified by the local minimum located between the two maxima of the image (see magenta threshold in  Supplementary Fig. 2A  and corresponding segmentation in  Supplementary Fig. 2E ). This thresholding method was similar to a previous approach [ 8 , 17 ]. 2.4 Volumetric quantification To determine the tumor volume, the boundaries of two consecutive slices were linearly interpolated and the tumor was reconstructed as a 3D volume. This reconstruction was based on the slice spacing, slice thickness, and spatial resolution in the slice plane. Total volume corresponded to the sum of volumes from all merged slices. 2.5 Manual tumor tracing There is no gold standard for the volumetric quantification of PNs. Tumor volumes generated by SSTMean and SSTMini methods were then compared with manual tracing of the tumors (e.g.,  Supplementary Fig. 2F ). For each MRI slice, the tumor was identified by drawing its contour(s) using the pencil tool from FSLeyes [ 25 ]. The voxels included into the contour regions and corresponding to the tumor were identified and a mask was generated using the FSLeyes mask saving tool. After completing the entire MRI dataset, the masks were opened in the Matlab script, where only the volumetric quantification was performed. 2.6 Statistical analysis Bland-Altman plots with 90 % two-sided confidence intervals were used to visualize the differences between volumes generated by the semi-automatic segmentation methods (SSTMean and SSTMini) and manual tracing. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were also used to statistically compare the volumetric quantification of the semi-automatic segmentation methods with manual tracing. Computations times were compared between the three techniques using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. For a subset of four patients, an inter-observer analysis was performed using the SSTMean method and differences between volumes generated by the two observers were reported in a Bland-Altman plot with 90 % two-sided confidence intervals.",Dorsa Sadat Kiaei; Ramy El-Jalbout; Jean-Claude Décarie; Sébastien Perreault; Mathieu Dehaes,Heliyon,2024-01-15,10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e23445,minimal,True
PMID:22901811,ERK inhibition rescues defects in fate specification of Nf1-deficient neural progenitors and brain abnormalities.,"Germline mutations in the RAS/ERK signaling pathway underlie several related developmental disorders collectively termed neuro-cardio-facial-cutaneous (NCFC) syndromes. NCFC patients manifest varying degrees of cognitive impairment, but the developmental basis of their brain abnormalities remains largely unknown. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), an NCFC syndrome, is caused by loss-of-function heterozygous mutations in the NF1 gene, which encodes neurofibromin, a RAS GTPase-activating protein. Here, we show that biallelic Nf1 inactivation promotes Erk-dependent, ectopic Olig2 expression specifically in transit-amplifying progenitors, leading to increased gliogenesis at the expense of neurogenesis in neonatal and adult subventricular zone (SVZ). Nf1-deficient brains exhibit enlarged corpus callosum, a structural defect linked to severe learning deficits in NF1 patients. Strikingly, these NF1-associated developmental defects are rescued by transient treatment with an MEK/ERK inhibitor during neonatal stages. This study reveals a critical role for Nf1 in maintaining postnatal SVZ-derived neurogenesis and identifies a potential therapeutic window for treating NF1-associated brain abnormalities.","EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Control and Mutant Mice The control mice used in this study are a pool of phenotypically indistinguishable mice with genotypes of hGFAP-cre-; Nf1 flox/flox , hGFAP-cre-; Nf1 flox/+ , hGFAP-cre+; Nf1 flox/+  and hGFAP-cre±; Nf1 KO/+ . The mutant mice ( Nf1 hGFAP CKO) used were of the genotypes, hGFAP-cre+; Nf1 flox/KO  and hGFAP-cre+; Nf1 flox/flox . For inducible experiments, Nestin-cre ER +; Nf1 flox/+  (tamoxifen+) mice were used as controls while Nestin-cre ER +; Nf1 flox/flox  (tamoxifen+) mice were used as mutants ( Nf1 NcreER CKO). Both of inducible strains carry R26 LacZR  allele as a reporter.  Nf1 hGFAP CKO and control mice were maintained in the mixed backgrounds of C57Bl6, 129Svj and FVB, which improve overall health and lifespan of the mutant mice. Nestin-cre ER +; Nf1 flox/flox  and control mice were maintained on the mixed C57Bl6 and 129Svj backgrounds. Age- and littermate-matched control and mutant mice were used for analysis to minimize the impact of modifier genes. All mice in this study were cared for according to the guidelines that were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committees of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. MEK Inhibitor Treatment MEK inhibitor (PD0325901, Sigma) was dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 25mg/ml and resuspended in vehicle (0.5% hydroxypropyl methyl-cellulose with 0.2% Tween80, Sigma) at a concentration of 1mg/ml. The solution was administered by oral gavage at the dosage of 5 mg/kg (body weight) daily to lactating females for the treatment of P0.5-P18 mice. MEK inhibitor treated mice were collected and compared to littermate control and  Nf1 hGFAP CKO mice treated with vehicle.

PMID:34464388,Cell-free DNA ultra-low-pass whole genome sequencing to distinguish malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) from its benign precursor lesion: A cross-sectional study.,"BACKGROUND: The leading cause of mortality for patients with the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) cancer predisposition syndrome is the development of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), an aggressive soft tissue sarcoma. In the setting of NF1, this cancer type frequently arises from within its common and benign precursor, plexiform neurofibroma (PN). Transformation from PN to MPNST is challenging to diagnose due to difficulties in distinguishing cross-sectional imaging results and intralesional heterogeneity resulting in biopsy sampling errors. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This multi-institutional study from the National Cancer Institute and Washington University in St. Louis used fragment size analysis and ultra-low-pass whole genome sequencing (ULP-WGS) of plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) to distinguish between MPNST and PN in patients with NF1. Following in silico enrichment for short cfDNA fragments and copy number analysis to estimate the fraction of plasma cfDNA originating from tumor (tumor fraction), we developed a noninvasive classifier that differentiates MPNST from PN with 86% pretreatment accuracy (91% specificity, 75% sensitivity) and 89% accuracy on serial analysis (91% specificity, 83% sensitivity). Healthy controls without NF1 (participants = 16, plasma samples = 16), PN (participants = 23, plasma samples = 23), and MPNST (participants = 14, plasma samples = 46) cohorts showed significant differences in tumor fraction in plasma (P = 0.001) as well as cfDNA fragment length (P < 0.001) with MPNST samples harboring shorter fragments and being enriched for tumor-derived cfDNA relative to PN and healthy controls. No other covariates were significant on multivariate logistic regression. Mutational analysis demonstrated focal NF1 copy number loss in PN and MPNST patient plasma but not in healthy controls. Greater genomic instability including alterations associated with malignant transformation (focal copy number gains in chromosome arms 1q, 7p, 8q, 9q, and 17q; focal copy number losses in SUZ12, SMARCA2, CDKN2A/B, and chromosome arms 6p and 9p) was more prominently observed in MPNST plasma. Furthermore, the sum of longest tumor diameters (SLD) visualized by cross-sectional imaging correlated significantly with paired tumor fractions in plasma from MPNST patients (r = 0.39, P = 0.024). On serial analysis, tumor fraction levels in plasma dynamically correlated with treatment response to therapy and minimal residual disease (MRD) detection before relapse. Study limitations include a modest MPNST sample size despite accrual from 2 major referral centers for this rare malignancy, and lack of uniform treatment and imaging protocols representing a real-world cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor fraction levels derived from cfDNA fragment size and copy number alteration analysis of plasma cfDNA using ULP-WGS significantly correlated with MPNST tumor burden, accurately distinguished MPNST from its benign PN precursor, and dynamically correlated with treatment response. In the future, our findings could form the basis for improved early cancer detection and monitoring in high-risk cancer-predisposed populations.","Methods and findings This multi-institutional study from the National Cancer Institute and Washington University in St. Louis used fragment size analysis and ultra-low-pass whole genome sequencing (ULP-WGS) of plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) to distinguish between MPNST and PN in patients with NF1.

Methods Study design This study used blood samples prospectively collected from NF1 patients with MPNST and PN tumors with the aim of distinguishing these different tumor types by plasma cfDNA analysis ( ). Patients from the NCI and Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL) with clinically and radiographically diagnosed PN or biopsy-proven MPNST were enrolled onto this multi-institutional cross-sectional study with written informed consent (NCI protocol  Fig 1 NCT01109394 , NIH Intramural IRB identifier 10C0086; NCI protocol  NCT00924196 , NIH Intramural IRB identifier 08C0079; WUSTL protocol  NCT04354064 , Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine Human Research Protection Office IRB identifiers 201903142 and 201203042) between 2016 and 2020. NF1 status was determined clinically by consensus criteria [ 33 ]. Five participants with MPNST who did not meet NF1 consensus criteria were also included in the analysis. A total of 14 MPNST and 23 PN patients were enrolled with peripheral blood collected at the time of enrollment ( ). MPNST patients had serial plasma samples collected for a total of 46 MPNST plasma samples (average 3, maximum 6 per participant,  S1 – S3  Tables ). When available, tissue was also collected at a single time point ( S1 Table n =  4 participants). When peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from whole blood, these were sequenced as germline DNA ( n  = 16 participants). All patients underwent clinical management and follow-up by board-certified physicians per the standard-of-care. All samples were collected with informed consent for research and institutional review board approval in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Protocols are available on  ClinicalTrials.gov . A STROBE checklist was completed to ensure accurate and complete reporting of the study (see  Supplement ) [ 34 ]. 10.1371/journal.pmed.1003734.g001 Fig 1 Study schema. Patients with imaging- and biopsy-proven MPNST and established PN along with healthy donors were enrolled onto this multi-institutional prospective cohort, with plasma collected for tumor fraction analysis at the time of study enrollment. Tumor fraction was assessed in all collected plasma samples by ULP-WGS followed by in silico size selection for short cfDNA fragments, which was used to train a noninvasive MPNST vs. PN classifier. During subsequent treatment and follow-up, MPNST patients underwent further serial imaging (analyzed by RECIST) and plasma sample collection (analyzed by ULP-WGS and in silico fragment size selection), with results correlated with each other and with clinical outcomes. cfDNA, cell-free DNA; MPNST, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor; PN, plexiform neurofibroma; RECIST, response evaluation criteria in solid tumors, version 1.1; SLD, sum of longest tumor diameters; ULP-WGS, ultra-low-pass whole genome sequencing. Healthy controls After obtaining written consent, healthy donor blood samples were obtained at a single time point from appropriately consented donors at the NIH Department of Transfusion medicine (NIH protocol  NCT00001846 , NIH Intramural IRB identifier 99-CC-0168) and WUSTL Clinical Translational Research Unit (WUSTL protocol  NCT04354064 , Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine Human Research Protection Office IRB identifiers 201903142 and 201203042) ( ). Eligibility for healthy controls included age greater than 18 years old and no known history of neoplastic or hematological disorders. Protocols are available on  S4 Table ClinicalTrials.gov . Clinical specimens After obtaining written informed consent for genomic analysis, serial peripheral blood samples were collected throughout the clinical course for consenting MPNST patients or at a single time point for PN patients and healthy controls. Treatment regimen for MPNST was determined by the primary treating clinicians and included radiotherapy, surgery, and cytotoxic chemotherapy ( ). S2 Table Venous blood samples (10 to 30 mL) were collected in EDTA (BD Biosciences, San Jose, California) or Cell-Free DNA BCT (Streck Laboratories, La Vista, Nebraska) tubes. EDTA tubes were processed within 4 hours of collection, while Cell-Free DNA BCT tubes were processed within 7 days of collection. Whole blood samples were centrifuged at room temperature (NCI: 1,900 ×  g  for 10 minutes, WUSTL: 1,200 ×  g  for 10 minutes). Isolated plasma was centrifuged a second time at room temperature (NCI: 15,000 ×  g  for 10 minutes, WUSTL: 1,800 ×  g  for 5 minutes) in low-bind Eppendorf tubes to remove residual cells. Purified plasma was frozen at −80°C until cfDNA isolation. Plasma cell-free DNA isolation Purified plasma was thawed at room temperature, and cfDNA was extracted from 2 to 8 mL of plasma using the QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Extracted DNA concentration was measured using the Qubit dsDNA High-Sensitivity assay (ThermoFisher, Waltham, Massachusetts), and cfDNA concentration and quality were assessed using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California) or Tapestation (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California). Isolated cfDNA was stored at −20°C until library preparation. Germline DNA isolation and processing After centrifuging clinical venous blood samples and removing plasma supernatant per above, the red blood cells and buffy coat were resuspended in PBS for germline DNA extraction using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). For a subset of samples, germline DNA from PBMCs was collected in and extracted using PAXgene Blood DNA tubes and kit (PreAnalytix, Germantown, Maryland). DNA was stored at −20°C until further processing. Germline DNA was then fragmented using a LE220 focused ultrasonicator (Covaris, Woburn, Massachusetts) or a  Q800R3  sonicator (Qsonica LLC, Newtown, Connecticut) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and previously published methods [ 35 ] to a target length of 200 bp. DNA lengths were assessed using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California). Tumor DNA isolation and processing Tumor tissue was not procured for research unless clinically indicated and available following the standard clinical pathology workflow. When available, tumor tissue was snap-frozen and stored at −80°C or stored in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedding (FFPE). Nucleic acids were isolated from tumor FFPE samples using the manufacturer’s protocol with the AllPrep DNA/RNA FFPE kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). DNA was extracted from snap-frozen tumor tissue samples using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Extracted DNA was stored at −20°C until further processing. Tissue DNA was subsequently fragmented using a LE220 focused ultrasonicator (Covaris, Woburn, Massachusetts) or  Q800R3  sonicator (Qsonica LLC, Newtown, Connecticut) and analyzed using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California) as described above. DNA library construction and sequencing Sequencing libraries were constructed from cfDNA (NCI 5 to 15 ng, WUSTL 10 to 60 ng) or germline/tumor DNA (NCI 100 ng, WUSTL 32 ng) using commercial kits per the manufacturers’ instructions: TruSeq Nano (Illumina, San Diego, California) for NCI samples and Kapa HyperPrep (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) for WUSTL samples. Constructed libraries were balanced, pooled, and sequenced using 150 bp paired-end reads on a NovaSeq (Illumina, San Diego, California) or HiSeq 4000 (Illumina, San Diego, California). Data were then quality filtered and pooled for analysis. Copy number alteration and tumor fraction analysis Sequencing data were demultiplexed, and raw reads were quality filtered using fastp v.0.2. Quality-filtered reads were then aligned to the hg19 human genome assembly using BWA v.0.7.17. Aligned reads were deduplicated with Samtools v.1.7, then downsampled to 10 million read pairs (WGS coverage approximately 0.6×), or separately for comparison purposes to 5 million read pairs (WGS coverage approximately 0.3×). Genomic coverage was estimated using MosDepth [ 36 ]. To enrich for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) fragments, in silico size selection was applied to all cfDNA samples [ 28 ]. Only quality-filtered reads between fragment lengths of 90 and 150 bp were considered for copy number and tumor fraction analysis for cfDNA samples, while such size selection was not performed for tumor and germline samples. GC content and mappability bias correction, depth-based local copy number estimates, and copy number–based estimation of tumor fraction were then performed using the ichorCNA tool (Broad v.0.2.0) [ 37 ]. Briefly, reads were summed in nonoverlapping windows of 10 6  bases; local read depth was corrected for GC bias and known regions of low mappability, and artifacts were removed by comparison to ichorCNA’s built-in healthy control reference. CNAs were predicted using recommended low tumor fraction parameters for cfDNA samples and default parameters for tumor and germline samples. X and Y chromosomes were not considered in copy number ratios. ichorCNA then used these binned, bias-corrected copy number values to model a two-component mixture of tumor-derived and nontumor-derived fragments, from which it inferred the fraction of reads in each sample originating from tumor (tumor fraction) [ 37 ]. Visualization of genome-wide CNAs at specific loci ( ) was generated from compiled log Fig 3 2  ratios of copy number for all study plasma specimens ( n =  85 samples). Reads were classified as copy number gain if log 2  of the copy number ratio was >0.58 (log 2  (3/2)) and loss if log 2  of the copy number ratio was <−1.0 (log 2  (1/2)). Bin CNA plots ( ) reflect copy number changes from baseline in the tumor-only fraction of each sample. Both copy number state and tumor fraction were determined by ichorCNA [ S1 Fig 37 ]. Fragment size analysis Following the sequencing quality control, deduplication, alignment, and downsampling steps described above, read-pair fragment sizes for cfDNA samples were calculated using deepTools bamPEFragmentSize [ 38 ]. The distribution of each sample’s fragment sizes was estimated by kernel density. cfDNA fragment size distributions were compared between the 3 clinical states (healthy control, PN, and MPNST) and between high and low tumor fraction samples by two-sided Kolmogorov–Smirnov testing. Comparisons of cfDNA tumor fraction to imaging Patients with MPNST and PN were monitored by CT, MRI, and/or FDG-PET imaging at the treating institution at the managing clinicians’ discretion. For patients with MPNST, radiographic tumor burden was quantified by sum of the longest tumor diameters (SLD) per RECIST 1.1 criteria [ 39 ]. For comparison to serial time point cfDNA tumor fractions, each plasma sample was matched to the nearest SLD value at the primary institution within 30 days and without any interceding change of therapy. SLDs and plasma tumor fraction levels were then assessed using Pearson correlation coefficient. For comparisons of plasma tumor fraction to clinical status by RECIST, tumor fraction values were first normalized per patient to the lowest value detected on serial analysis, and then log 2  transformed to generate the final plotted values in  . Changes in clinical status were assessed and categorized as complete response, partial response, stable disease, or progressive disease per RECIST 1.1 criteria [ Fig 5B 39 ]. RECIST 1.1 scoring was performed on serial imaging studies relative to a patient’s baseline scan. Power and statistical analyses Previous tissue-based studies have shown that PN harbor few genome-wide CNAs [ 40 , 41 ] but acquire significant genomic instability during malignant transformation to MPNST [ 32 , 41 , 42 ]. Based on these known significant CNA differences between MPNST and PN tumors, we assumed a large effect size would also be evident comparing MPNST plasma tumor fraction to plasma from PN patients or healthy controls. Using Cohen’s  f  = 0.6 with an α = 0.05 and power = 0.80, we projected that the sample size needed to detect differences between these 3 categories would be  n =  10 per group. Our category group sizes met or exceeded this estimate for all comparisons ( ). S1 – S4  Tables When testing associations between plasma tumor fraction and clinical status ( ), we limited MPNST plasma samples to those collected either prior to all treatments or after a washout period of at least 21 days after completion of chemotherapy or radiotherapy (designated as pretreatment or baseline MPNST samples below). The distributions of plasma tumor fraction for each clinical status were compared by Kruskal–Wallis H test with pairwise comparisons by Dunn test. To further compare pretreatment MPNST to benign PN patients, we generated a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of plasma tumor fraction. Tumor fraction values derived from ctDNA-enriched 90 to 150 bp fragments were compared to tumor fractions derived from all cfDNA fragment lengths. For ctDNA-enriched tumor fraction, an optimized cutpoint was determined by Youden’s index (the point on the ROC curve that maximizes sensitivity + specificity– 1), and high and low plasma tumor fraction groups by cutpoint were compared to clinical status by Fisher exact test. A logistic regression was also performed for the MPNST versus PN groups using the glm function in  Fig 4 R , evaluating the effects of age, sex, and institution in addition to pretreatment plasma tumor fraction. Leave-one-out cross-validation was performed in  R  using the caret package. The reverse Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate follow-up times. Statistical analyses were performed using  R  v.3.6.1 or Prism 9 (GraphPad Software).",Jeffrey J Szymanski; R Taylor Sundby; Paul A Jones; Divya Srihari; Noah Earland; Peter K Harris; Wenjia Feng; Faridi Qaium; Haiyan Lei; David Roberts; Michele Landeau; Jamie Bell; Yi Huang; Leah Hoffman; Melissa Spencer; Matthew B Spraker; Li Ding; Brigitte C Widemann; Jack F Shern; Angela C Hirbe; Aadel A Chaudhuri,PLoS medicine,2021-08,10.1371/journal.pmed.1003734,minimal,True
PMID:29925695,A porcine model of neurofibromatosis type 1 that mimics the human disease.,"Loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene causes the autosomal dominant condition, neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Children and adults with NF1 suffer from pathologies including benign and malignant tumors to cognitive deficits, seizures, growth abnormalities, and peripheral neuropathies. NF1 encodes neurofibromin, a Ras-GTPase activating protein, and NF1 mutations result in hyperactivated Ras signaling in patients. Existing NF1 mutant mice mimic individual aspects of NF1, but none comprehensively models the disease. We describe a potentially novel Yucatan miniswine model bearing a heterozygotic mutation in NF1 (exon 42 deletion) orthologous to a mutation found in NF1 patients. NF1+/ex42del miniswine phenocopy the wide range of manifestations seen in NF1 patients, including café au lait spots, neurofibromas, axillary freckling, and neurological defects in learning and memory. Molecular analyses verified reduced neurofibromin expression in swine NF1+/ex42del fibroblasts, as well as hyperactivation of Ras, as measured by increased expression of its downstream effectors, phosphorylated ERK1/2, SIAH, and the checkpoint regulators p53 and p21. Consistent with altered pain signaling in NF1, dysregulation of calcium and sodium channels was observed in dorsal root ganglia expressing mutant NF1. Thus, these NF1+/ex42del miniswine recapitulate the disease and provide a unique, much-needed tool to advance the study and treatment of NF1.",,Katherine A White; Vicki J Swier; Jacob T Cain; Jordan L Kohlmeyer; David K Meyerholz; Munir R Tanas; Johanna Uthoff; Emily Hammond; Hua Li; Frank A Rohret; Adam Goeken; Chun-Hung Chan; Mariah R Leidinger; Shaikamjad Umesalma; Margaret R Wallace; Rebecca D Dodd; Karin Panzer; Amy H Tang; Benjamin W Darbro; Aubin Moutal; Song Cai; Wennan Li; Shreya S Bellampalli; Rajesh Khanna; Christopher S Rogers; Jessica C Sieren; Dawn E Quelle; Jill M Weimer,JCI insight,2018-06-21,10.1172/jci.insight.120402,abstract_only,False
PMID:38481529,Generation of heterozygous and homozygous NF1 lines from human-induced pluripotent stem cells using CRISPR/Cas9 to investigate bone defects associated with neurofibromatosis type 1.,Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common genetic disorders caused by heterozygous germline ,"2 Materials and methods 2.1 Pluripotent stem cell reprogramming and culture 
 NF1 -1 and  NF1 -2 hiPSC lines were reprogrammed using OSKM episomal technique by Phenocell from two patient-derived fibroblasts carrying  NF1  mutations. Approval was received from the local committee of the Ile de France (Declaration DC-2010-1101/CPP dossier n° Am6136-2-COL2828), and written informed consent was received from patients.  NF1 -1 and  NF1 -2 hiPSC lines carry the nonsense heterozygous mutation c.1721 + 3A>G located at intron 15 in the  NF1  gene and c.2412del at exon 21, respectively, leading to the formation of a premature stop codon resulting in the expression of a truncated neurofibromin. Two control  NF1  (+/+) hiPSC lines ( WT -1 and  WT -2) purchased from Phenocell were also generated from control donors. The parental (+/+) control hiPSC line used for Crispr/Cas9 engineering corresponds to the  WT -1 line. HiPSCs were maintained and expanded with the StemMACS™ iPS-Brew XF medium (Miltenyi Biotec) on Matrigel ®  hESC-qualified Matrix (Corning)-coated culture dishes. Cultures were changed every 2 days and passaged every 5–7 days with StemPro Accutase Cell Dissociation Reagent (Gibco). 2.2 Mesenchymal stem cell differentiation HiPSCs were differentiated into mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) using protocols for differentiation published by  Denis et al. (2011) . Briefly, 1.10 4  to 4.10 4  hiPSCs/cm 2  were seeded on 0.1% gelatin (Sigma)-coated dishes with knockout™ DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 1% non-essential amino acids (Gibco), 1% Glutamax™ (Gibco), 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol (Gibco), 1 mM ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (Sigma), and 10 ng/mL FGF2 (Tocris). The medium was changed every 2–3 days. MSCs were passaged with Trypsin-EDTA 1× (Gibco) each time they reached 80% confluence until they showed a characteristic fibroblastic spindle shape. 2.3 Adipocytic differentiation MSCs were seeded at 20,000 cells/cm 2  on 0.1% gelatin (Sigma)-coated dishes and cultured in the MSC medium previously described. At 80% of confluence, the medium was switched to StemMACS™ AdipoDiff Media, human (Miltenyi Biotec) for 10 days with medium changes every 2–3 days. 2.4 Osteogenic differentiation MSC seeded at 10,000 cells/cm 2  on Collagen I (100 μg/mL, Gibco)-coated plates were cultured in MSC medium, as previously described. At confluence, the medium was switched to osteogenic differentiation medium containing modified Eagle medium alpha (Gibco), 16.5% FBS, 100 nM dexamethasone (Sigma), 200 µM ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (Sigma), and 10 mM  β -glycerophosphate (Sigma) for 14–20 days with medium changes every 2–3 days. 2.5  NF1  (+/−) and  NF1  (−/−)-knockout isogenic hiPSC line generation by CRISPR/Cas9 Single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were designed using CRISPOR software ( http://crispor.tefor.net ) and synthesized by IDT™ (Integrated DNA Technologies). sgRNA1 (5′-TAACTGCGCAACCTTCTTTA-3′) and sgRNA2 (5′-GTTAGCAGTTATAAATAGCC-3′) target the exon 6 of  NF1  gene. Target-specific crispr RNA (crRNA) and trans-activating crispr RNA (tracrRNA) were synthesized by IDT. We electroporated 2.10 5  control  NF1  (+/+) hiPSCs with 120 pmol of each sgRNA (obtained by duplexing crRNA and tracrRNA) and 100 pmol of  Streptococcus pyogenes  Cas9 protein (gift from Jean-Paul Concordet, MNHN/CNRS UMR 7196/INSERM U1154) using the P3 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector ®  X Kit (Lonza) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Transfected hiPSCs were then seeded in StemMACS™ iPS-Brew XF medium supplemented with Clone R ®  (STEMCELL Technologies) in 24-well plates coated with Matrigel ®  hESC qualified Matrix (Corning). After 48 h from transfection, the hiPSCs were harvested for high-resolution melting analysis and seeded back to obtain isolated clones using limiting dilution cloning in a 96-well plate. After 10–14 days of expansion, clones were analyzed for editing. 2.6 Identification of edited clones The genomic DNA of single colonies was extracted using QuickExtract DNA extraction solution (Lucigen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Targeted locus was amplified by PCR using MeltDoctor™ HRM Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and primers (5′-TGC​TCT​GAG​TTG​TAT​TTG​TGT​TAA​C-3′, 5′-GAG​AGG​TTG​TAA​CTT​ACC​TTT​TCC​A-3′) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR reactions were analyzed using a QuantStudio 12K Flex Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The protocol was 95°C for 10 min, then 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min, followed by 95°C for 10 s and 60°C for 1 min; then, the temperature was increased by 0.025°C/s until 95°C 15 s, followed by cooling to 60°C. Curves were analyzed using QuantStudio™ 12K Flex software. Clones showing editing were selected, and corresponding PCR products were sequenced by Sanger sequencing (Eurofins). To ensure the purity of each edited clone, corresponding PCR products were subcloned using a TOPO™ TA Cloning™ Kit for Sequencing, with One Shot™ TOP10 Chemically Competent  E. coli  (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufacturer’s instructions. At least 30 TA clones for each CRISPR cell line were analyzed by Sanger sequencing (Eurofins). 2.7 Surface antigen flow cytometry analysis Expression of cell surface antigens on hiPSCs or mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) was analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells were dissociated into single-cell suspension with Accutase (Invitrogen) and Tryple Express enzyme (Gibco) for hiPSCs and MSCs, respectively. Cells were incubated in PBS containing 2% fetal bovine serum with fluorescent dye-conjugated antibodies (listed in  Supplementary Table S1 ) for 30 min on ice. Staining with the isotypic antibody was performed as a control. Analysis was performed on a MACSQuant ®  system (Miltenyi Biotec). Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (FlowJo LLC). 2.8 Protein extraction and Western blot analysis Total proteins were extracted in RIPA lysis buffer (Sigma) containing 1% protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) and 10% phosphatase inhibitor (Roche). Proteins were quantified using the Pierce BCA Protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and loaded using NuPAGE™ 3%–8% and Tris - acetate (Invitrogen). Total proteins were then transferred to PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad) with a Trans-Blot Turbo Transfert system (Bio-Rad), blocked with Odyssey blocking buffer (OBB) containing 0.1% Tween-20, and incubated overnight with the primary anti-neurofibromin antibody (abcam, ab17963, 1/1000) diluted in the OBB containing 0.1% Tween-20. The membrane was then incubated for 1 h with the corresponding IRDye secondary antibodies (LI-COR). Immunoreactive protein bands were revealed using an Odyssey CLx Imager (LI-COR) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Anti-beta-Actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, sc4778, 1/10,000) or anti-vinculin (abcam, ab129002, 1/1000) was used to verify equal protein loading. 2.9 BODIPY staining Adipocytic differentiation was monitored after staining lipid droplets. Briefly, cells were permeabilized with FCM permeabilization buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), stained with BODIPY™ 493/503 (Invitrogen, 1/100 in PBS) and Hoechst (Invitrogen, 1/3000 in PBS) for 20 min, and rinsed. 2.10 Alkaline phosphatase staining and quantification Osteogenic differentiation was tested on day 14 for staining of alkaline phosphatase activity. Cells were washed, fixed with ethanol 95%, and stained with the SIGMA FAST ™ BCIP/NBT kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The quantification of ALP activity was performed using 1-Step™ PNPP Substrate Solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The results were normalized with the total viable cell number monitored with the CellTiter-Glo assay ®  (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 2.11 Alizarin red staining Calcium deposition was detected with alizarin red staining solution (Merck Millipore) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, after 20 days of culture, cells were washed, fixed with ethanol 70%, incubated for 20 min with alizarin red solution, and rinsed before microscopy observation. 2.12 RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR Total RNAs were extracted using the RNeasy Micro/Mini Kit (Qiagen) and were reverse transcribed (RT) using the Superscript™ III reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen) with a mix of random hexamers and oligo dT according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was carried out with the primers listed in  Supplementary Table S2  and Luminaris Color HiGreen qPCR Master Mix, low ROX (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a QuantStudio 12K Flex Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The amplification was performed using 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min. The relative gene expression level was calculated with the 2-delta delta Ct method and normalized to 18S expression. 2.13 Statistical analysis All data were processed using GraphPad Prism 9 ® . Data were analyzed using the non-parametric Mann–Whitney test for side-by-side comparison.  p- values ≤0.05 were considered significant.",Annabelle Darle; Thibault Mahiet; Déborah Aubin; Manon Doyen; Lina El Kassar; Béatrice Parfait; Gilles Lemaitre; Christine Baldeschi; Jennifer Allouche; Nathalie Holic,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,2024,10.3389/fcell.2024.1359561,minimal,True
PMID:40590220,A haploinsufficiency restoration strategy corrects neurobehavioral deficits in Nf1+/- mice.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene resulting in the loss of function of neurofibromin, a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Ras. While the malignant manifestations of NF1 are associated with loss of heterozygosity of the residual WT allele, the nonmalignant neurodevelopmental sequelae, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and/or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are prevalent morbidities that occur in the setting of neurofibromin haploinsufficiency. We reasoned that augmenting endogenous levels of WT neurofibromin could serve as a potential therapeutic strategy to correct the neurodevelopmental manifestations of NF1. Here, we used a combination of genetic screening and genetically engineered murine models to identify a role for the F-box protein FBXW11 as a regulator of neurofibromin degradation. Disruption of Fbxw11, through germline mutation or targeted genetic manipulation in the nucleus accumbens, increased neurofibromin levels, suppressed Ras-dependent ERK phosphorylation, and corrected social learning deficits and impulsive behaviors in male Nf1+/- mice. Our results demonstrate that preventing the degradation of neurofibromin is a feasible and effective approach to ameliorate the neurodevelopmental phenotypes in a haploinsufficient disease model.","Methods Sex as a biological variable Male  Nf1  mice were utilized for these studies due to their well-documented neurobehavioral phenotype ( +/– 15 ). While our findings are likely applicable to female mice as well, recent evidence suggests sexual dimorphism in  Nf1  mice, and alternative assays may need to be performed in future studies ( +/– 87 ). Animals Nf1  heterozygous ( Nf1 , C57BL/6) mice have been previously described ( +/– 82 ,  88 ).  Fbxw11  heterozygous ( Fbxw11 , C57BL/6NTac) mice were from Knockout Mouse Project (KOMP) (strain ID:  +/– Fbxw11 , design ID: 49846, project ID:  tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi CSD25672 , MGI ID: 4363386).  Fbxw11  (exon 4 targeted) mice were generated from the  fl/fl Fbxw11  strain by FLP-FRT recombination and subsequently crossed with  tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi Nf1  mice. +/– Genotyping Nf1  genotyping was performed as previously described ( 88 ).  Fbxw11  was genotyped by PCR using forward primer F (5′-GAATCTGTGTTACCAGGCACTCAGC-3′) and reverse primer ttR (5′-GCCTTAGCTCACTATTCCCCATTGC-3′) for WT (631 bp) and primer neoF (5′-GGGATCTCATGCTGGAGTTCTTCG-3′) as the reverse primer ttR for KO (633 bp). The annealing temperatures were 56°C and 59°C, respectively. For  Fbxw11  genotyping, primer F and reverse primer ttR were used (826 bp). fl/fl Cell culture HEK293T cells (American Type Culture Collection [ATCC], CRL-3216), HeLa cells (ATCC CCL-2), MEFs (generated in our laboratory), and human fibroblasts (ATCC, PCS-201-012) were grown in DMEM containing 10%–12% FBS (Atlanta Biologics) and penicillin/streptomycin solution (1:100; MilliporeSigma).

Transfection complexes were prepared in Opti-MEM serum-free medium (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific) by mixing 0.3 μL siPORT NeoFX Transfection Reagent (Ambion, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 10 nM siRNA (individual siRNA members of the F-boxes, Ambion) ( 90 ). Human fibroblasts (2 × 10 5  cells/well) and LUVA (5 × 10 5  cells/well) were plated in a 6-well format simultaneously with addition of transfection complexes. Cells were incubated for 72 hours and subsequently analyzed by Western blotting. Confirmation was performed with a second siRNA targeting FBXW11 or FBXO3 using 3 siRNA constructs and scrambled siRNA in HeLa or HEK293T cells. The transfection method was the same as described above. After siRNA constructs were tested for 72 hours of transfection, 1 was chosen for further experimentation. CHX chase analysis Neurofibromin stability was assessed using CHX chase in HeLa cells ( 91 ). After 48–72 hours of transfection, cells were treated with 20 μg/mL CHX (MilliporeSigma) for the indicated durations. The cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting. Construction of GFP (or Flag) fusions with domains of neurofibromin Full-length human neurofibromin cDNA was purchased from Origene. Neurofibromin gene fragments were synthesized using various 5′ primers and 3′ primers and subcloned into the SgfI/MluI sites of pCMV-AC-GFP (or pCMV6-ENTRY, Origene).

PEI (1 mg/mL in sterile water) was neutralized with HCl and filtered at 0.2 μm (MilliporeSigma), and PEI solution and plasmids were mixed at a 5:1 ratio. Co-IP Cell extracts were prepared in IP lysis buffer of (1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, and 1 mM PMSF, supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors. Flag-tagged FBXW11 or FBXO3 cDNA plasmids and GFP-tagged truncated NF1 cDNA plasmids were cotransfected into HEK293T cells. Sixty-eight to 72 hours after transfection, HEK293T cells were incubated with MG132 (15 mM) for 6 hours and lysed, sonicated, and centrifuged for 25 minutes at 16,000 g . Supernatants were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel at 4°C overnight. Immunoprecipitated proteins were washed 3 times with 250 mM NaCl/IP lysis buffer and eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and anti-GFP immunoblotting. Western blotting Whole-cell or tissue extracts were prepared with xTractor lysis buffer (Clontech) including a protease inhibitor (Complete Mini EDTA-free, Roche) and a phosphatase inhibitor (PhosSTOP, Roche). After sonication and centrifugation for 5 minutes at 10,000 g , the supernatants were collected. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (4%–12% gradient gels), transferred onto PVDF membranes, incubated with a blocking buffer, the primary and appropriate secondary antibodies, and developed with ECL (catalog 32134, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The following primary antibodies were used: neurofibromin/NF1 (sc-67, sc-376886, Santa Cruz Biotechnology and ab238142, Abcam); Flag (F7425, MilliporeSigma); GFP (ab1218, Abcam, Western blotting and Invitrogen, IP); turboGFP (AB513, Evrogen); FBXW11/bTrCP2 (GTX33193, GeneTex and PA5-109715, Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific); ERK1/2 (9102, Cell Signaling Technology); anti-pERK Thr202/Tyr204 (4377, Cell Signaling Technology); IκBα (9242 Cell Signaling Technology); β-catenin (8480, Cell Signaling Technology); ubiquitin (3933, Cell Signaling Technology); CUL1 (17775, Cell Signaling Technology); SKP1 (2156, Cell Signaling Technology); Rbx1 (4397, Cell Signaling Technology); and GAPDH (2118, Cell Signaling Technology).

Purification of the SCF-FBXW11 complex Thirty 150 mm plates of HEK293T cells were transfected using PEI with the indicated constructs (Flag-FBXW11, CUL1, SKP1, and RBX1). Seventy-two hours later, cells were washed twice with PBS, flash-frozen, and lysed in 50 mL IP lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 25 mM HEPES, pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 2 mM sodium fluoride, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF and proteinase inhibitor) by sonication. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 g  for 20 minutes at 4°C and incubated with 150 μL anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel resin (MilliporeSigma) overnight at 4°C, washed 7 times with 500 μL wash buffer (10 mM Tris, pH = 7.4, 100 mM KCl and 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and eluted with 500 μL elution buffer I (100 μg/mL 3X FLAG peptide [MilliporeSigma], 0.4 μg/mL, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 20% glycerol, 100 mM KCl, and 1 mM DTT) for 30 minutes at 4°C with gentle rocking. The supernatant was collected and stored at –20°C until further analysis. Site-directed mutagenesis Plasmid pEGFP-C1 containing the NF1-GRD gene fragment ( 92 ) was used as a mutagenesis template. Plasmids were propagated in TOP10  E .  coli  (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and isolated using Qiagen Miniprep kits (Qiagen). Primers were synthesized by Invitrogen and purified by SePOP desalting. The melting temperature of the DNA duplex was calculated as Tm = 81.5 + 0.41 (percentage GC [guanine (G) and cytosine (C) bases in the DNA sequence]) – (675/N [total number of nucleotides in the DNA sequence]) – percentage mismatch. PCR reactions of 50 μL contained 50–100 ng template, 1 μM primer pair, 200 μM deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate, and 3 units of pfu DNA polymerase were used according to the manufacturers’ protocol for the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). Mutations were verified by Sanger sequencing. The following mutagenic oligonucleotide primers were used: S1159A-GRD, forward, 5′-GCCAACGTAGACGCTGGTCTCATGCAC-3′; S1159A-GRD, reverse, 5′-GTGCATGAGACCAGCGTCTACGTTGGC-3′; S1164A-GRD, forward, 5′-GGTCTCATGCACGCCATAGGCTTAGG-3′; S1164A-GRD, reverse, 5′-CCTAAGCCTATGGCGTGCATGAGACC-3′; S1159A-S1164A, forward, 5′-GCCAACGTAGACGCTGGTCTCATGCACGCCATAGGCTTAGG-3′; S1159A-S1164A, reverse: 5′-CCTAAGCCTATGGCGTGCATGAGACCAGCGTCTACGTTGGC-3′. In vitro ubiquitination assay The GRD iso1 ubiquitination assay (Enzo Life Sciences) was carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions with purified SCF FBXW11  complex (E3), purified GRD iso1 (substrate), and His-UbcH3/Cdc34 (E2) ( 42 ), in vitro. Ubiquitin ligase activity was determined by Western blotting with anti-Ub antibody (3933, Cell Signaling Technology). LC-MS/MS and proteomics analysis HEK293T cells were plated 1 day prior to transfection at 3.0 × 10 6  cells per 15 cm tissue culture plate and transfected by PEI with GFP-tagged GRD1 plasmid. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were treated with 15 μM MG132 for 4–6 hours, washed once in PBS, and lysed in IP lysis buffer. Clarified lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody overnight at 4°C and collected with protein A/G beads as described above. GFP-GRD fusion proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE utilizing Coomassie blue staining, and gel bands were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Tryptic peptides from GFP-GRD1 were injected onto the NanoAcquity UPLC column 1.7 μm BEH130 C18 (100 μm × 100 mm) with a NanoAcquity UPLC Trap column (5 μm Symmetry C18, 180 μm × 20 mm). Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient (3%–40% acetonitrile in water with 0.1% FA) over 65 minutes using the Waters Nano UPLC system (room temperature, flow rate 500 nL/min), and effluent was electrosprayed into a LTQ mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For the database search (Sequest), human Uniprot and NF1 protein sequences (variable modifications: phosphorylation [S, T, Y]) were used. Individual probability values for each putatively phosphorylated site were generated by Proteome Discoverer, version 1.3, equipped with the phosphoRS 2.0 node. TUBEs Lysates from cells treated with si FBXW11  or siControl were incubated with TUBEs-agarose (displays equivalent affinities for both K63 and K48 tetra-ubiquitin, TUBE 2) for 1 hour at room temperature (LifeSensors). TUBEs-agarose was washed after ubiquitin capture, and the bound material was eluted with Laemmi sample buffer. The relative levels of ubiquitylated neurofibromin were determined by immunoblotting with neurofibromin antibody (ab238142, Abcam) or ubiquitin antibody (no. 3933, Cell Signaling Technology). NanoBiT luciferase assays for GRDiso1/GRD1so2-FBXW11 interactions GRD1/GRD2 and FBXW11 were amplified from cDNA of D3iso1/D3iso2 and then inserted into pFN33KLgBit-TK-neo Flexi, pFC34KLgBit-TK-neo Flexi, pFN35KSmBit-TK-neo Flexi, and pFC36KSmBit-TK-neo Flexi plasmids (Promega). HEK293T cells were transfected with the plasmids of NanoBiT fusion GRD1/GRD2 and FBXW11 constructs using FuGENE HD Transfection Reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Forty-eight hours after transfection in a 96-well plate, Nano-Glo Live Cell Substrate (Promega) was added to each well, incubated for 5 minutes, and an equal amount of reaction medium from each well was measured by Glo-MAX luminometer (Promega). Luciferase activities are shown as the mean value of triplicate wells ± SD. Ras activation assay Brain tissues were homogenized in xTractor buffer (catalog 635671, TakaRa), and the protein lysates were collected after centrifugation at 13,000 g  for 10 minutes. Active Ras was pulled down with Raf-1 RBD agarose (catalog 14-278, EMDMillipore) overnight at 4°C with gentle agitation. After washing the beads with TBS, 3X NuPAGE LDS Sample buffer (catalog NP0007, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added, and samples were boiled for 5 minutes. The supernatan was collected after brief centrifugation for immunoblotting to detect vinculin (catalog ab219649, Abcam) or Ras (catalog 05-516, EMDMillipore). Behavioral experiments Once weaned on P28, all mice were group-housed (3–4/cage by litter containing mixed genotypes), given food and water ad libitum, and maintained on a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle (7 am/7 pm) at 72°F. Animals were single-housed either 1 week before the SP task or after surgery. For all behavioral tasks, the experimenters performing the behavioral task test and scoring the behavioral data were blinded to the genotype and treatment conditions. SP task The 3-chamber SP task occurred over 2 days as described previously ( 15 ). After being single-housed for at least 1 week, testing began on day 1 when the mouse was placed in the center of the 3-chamber apparatus with 2 empty wire cups for 10 minutes of habituation (HAB). The mouse was blocked using clear Plexiglass in the center of the apparatus during the inter-trial interval of 5 minutes. The examiner placed a partner mouse under one of the wire cups before allowing the test mouse to investigate the partner mouse for 10 minutes of familiarization (FAM). During the inter-trial interval, the examiner placed another partner mouse under the second cup (novel 1 [NOV1]). For 10 minutes (NOV1), the test mouse was permitted to investigate the familiar mouse and NOV1 mouse. The examiner removed NOV1 during the inter-trial interval. To ensure familiarity, the test mouse then spent 45 minutes with the familiar mouse (FAM45) under the cup. Twenty-four hours later, the same familiar mouse was placed under the same wire cup, and a new novel mouse (NOV2) was placed under the other wire cup. The test mouse was introduced to the apparatus and given 10 minutes to investigate (NOV2). The time spent near each wire cup was recorded and scored with the automated AnyMaze software during the NOV1 and NOV2 time blocks. OF tests Based on methods described previously, mice were placed in the dark in an open chamber (40 × 40 cm, 30 cm height) for 60 minutes while activity was recorded using AnyMaze software ( 14 ). DDT tests Based on methods described previously, mice were trained to identify which side of a T maze (each arm measured 36 cm length, 8 cm width, and 12.5 cm height) had a large reward (4 Cocoa Krispies) compared with the small reward (1 Cocoa Krispie) ( 14 ). Training was completed daily with 6 trials per day with no delay until each mouse found the large reward correctly 10 out of 12 times over 2 consecutive days. After this, the delay was initiated. Testing consisted of 6 days with 6 trials per day, and teaching occurred on the first 2 days. The mouse was placed in the T maze with the small reward in place and no reward on the large reward side. The mouse would go to the large side as trained and would be blocked in this arm for teaching of the 10-second delay, and then the large reward would be given. After the first 2 days, which allowed for these teaching trials, the mice performed the task without being blocked in the large reward arm. Data were analyzed for the last 2 days for a total of 12 trials. For each testing trial, they could make 3 choices: directly go to small reward side, go to large reward side and then switch to the small reward side, or go to the large reward side and wait for the large reward ( Figure 4A ). A direct small choice or a switch choice would result in receiving a small reward (graphed in  Figure 4C  and  Figure 5D ). Mice were food-restricted during this time to increase food motivation, with daily measurement of weight and careful inspection of the health of each mouse. CAR tests Based on previously described methods, a round, plastic platform (diameter, 20 cm; thickness, 2 cm) supported by a plastic rod (height, 50 cm) was used to assess the CAR ( 14 ). The platform was stabilized in a kiddie pool with a rubber bottom for cushion if the animal fell. Mice were placed in the center of the platform, and behavior was recorded for 60 minutes. If a mouse fell from the platform, it was immediately placed back on the platform, and the test continued up to 60 minutes. A mouse was considered to have an intact CAR if it did not fall off the platform. The CAR was calculated as a percentage of mice that demonstrated an intact CAR for each group: percentage of mice with an intact CAR = (the number of mice that did not fall from the platform/total number of mice) × 100. Head time in each zone was recorded and scored with the automated AnyMaze software. The edge zone was defined by outlining the outer 1 inch of the round platform with 1 inner circle and 1 outer circle in the AnyMaze software. The over-the-edge zone was defined by outlining an outer circle that was 2 inches from the edge of the platform in the AnyMaze software. Brain stereotaxic surgery To excise  Fbxw11  in the tissue of interest, utilizing  Nf1  and  +/+  Fbxw11 fl/fl Nf1  genetically engineered mice, the experimenter performed stereotaxic surgery to inject either control (GFP; AAV5-CMV-GFP, UNC) or Cre-recombinase fused to GFP (CRE; AAV5-CMV-Cre-GFP, UNC) into brain tissue. Prior to all surgeries, mice were deeply anesthetized in an induction chamber using an isoflurane system (MGX Research Machine, Vetamic). Mice were then placed in a nose cone connected to the isoflurane system in the 900 series Ultraprecise Kopf Instruments stereotaxic apparatus for rodents. After ensuring flatness of the skull through measurement of lambda and bregma, bilateral viral transduction of the nucleus accumbens was performed ( +/–  Fbxw11 fl/fl Figure 5A ). Immediately following all stereotaxic surgeries, all mice received carprofen (5 mg/kg) and were observed over time, with carprofen (5 mg/kg) given at regular intervals until fully recovered. On the basis of data from previous studies ( 14 ,  15 ), we tested behavioral phenotypes before surgery and 8 weeks after surgery. Brain IHC Mice were perfused transcardially with PBS, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde, and the brains were removed and coronally sectioned at 35 μm. After washes with PBS, H 2 O 2 , and PBS with Triton X-100 (PBST), the primary antibody diluted in PBST was applied to sections overnight. The next day, after washing 3 times with PBS, sections were placed with a secondary antibody in PBST for 90 minute and then amplified by avidin-biotin complex (ABC) (1:500, Vector Laboratories) in PBST for 90 minutes. After washing, Vector SG Substrate Kit (Vector Laboratories) was used to identify immunoreactivity. Sections were stored in phosphate buffer and mounted on slides with DAPI (Vectashield). Photomicrographs were taken (×200), and neurofibromin-immunoreactive (NF1-ir) cells and pERK-immunoreactive (pERK-ir) cells were counted by a blinded observer using ImageJ software (NIH). GFP-ir cells were used to quantify the injection targets. Neurofibromin staining. The primary antibody used was rabbit anti–neurofibromin polyclonal antibody (1:400, LSBio, LS-B8110), and the secondary antibody used was biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody (1:200, Vector Laboratories, BA-1000). pERK staining. The primary antibody used was rabbit anti-pERK polyclonal antibody (1:200, Cell Signaling Technology, no. 4695), and the secondary antibody used was biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody (1:200, Vector Laboratories, BA-1000). GFP staining. The primary antibody used was mouse anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (1:100, Life Sciences Technology, AB3080), and the secondary antibody used was anti–mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (1:200, Life Sciences Technology, A-11001). Statistics All values are presented as the mean or percentage ± SEM unless otherwise indicated. All Western blot and in vitro assay experiments were performed at least in triplicate, and representative results are shown. Analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 5.0d (GraphPad Software). A  P  value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant unless stated otherwise. Baseline behavioral data for mice before surgical intervention was analyzed by 2-way ANOVA to ensure randomization. All behavioral tasks were analyzed in GraphPad Prism using 1- or 2-way ANOVA with genotype with or without treatment as the main factors, and the dependent variable being head time (s) near each partner mouse cup (3-chamber SP task), total distance traveled (cm, OF), zone time (s) or entries (CAR), and the number of small impulsive choices made (DDT). For brain IHC, neuron counts were analyzed by 2-tailed  t  test or 1-way ANOVA with viral genotype with or without treatment as the main factors. If a factor or interaction was significant, we ran a Tukey’s or Dunnett’s multiple-comparison post hoc test as indicated in the figure legends.

PMID:23432799,"Development of the adult PedsQL™ neurofibromatosis type 1 module: initial feasibility, reliability and validity.","BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant genetic disorder with significant impact on health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Research in understanding the pathogenetic mechanisms of neurofibroma development has led to the use of new clinical trials for the treatment of NF1. One of the most important outcomes of a trial is improvement in quality of life, however, no condition specific HRQOL instrument for NF1 exists. The objective of this study was to develop an NF1 HRQOL instrument as a module of PedsQL™ and to test for its initial feasibility, internal consistency reliability and validity in adults with NF1. METHODS: The NF1 specific HRQOL instrument was developed using a standard method of PedsQL™ module development - literature review, focus group/semi-structured interviews, cognitive interviews and experts' review of initial draft, pilot testing and field testing. Field testing involved 134 adults with NF1. Feasibility was measured by the percentage of missing responses, internal consistency reliability was measured with Cronbach's alpha and validity was measured by the known-groups method. RESULTS: Feasibility, measured by the percentage of missing responses was 4.8% for all subscales on the adult version of the NF1-specific instrument. Internal consistency reliability for the Total Score (alpha =0.97) and subscale reliabilities ranging from 0.72 to 0.96 were acceptable for group comparisons. The PedsQL™ NF1 module distinguished between NF1 adults with excellent to very good, good, and fair to poor health status. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the initial feasibility, reliability and validity of the PedsQL™ NF1 module in adult patients. The PedsQL™ NF1 Module can be used to understand the multidimensional nature of NF1 on the HRQOL patients with this disorder.","Methods The NF1 specific HRQOL instrument was developed using a standard method of PedsQL™ module development – literature review, focus group/semi-structured interviews, cognitive interviews and experts’ review of initial draft, pilot testing and field testing. Field testing involved 134 adults with NF1. Feasibility was measured by the percentage of missing responses, internal consistency reliability was measured with Cronbach’s alpha and validity was measured by the known-groups method. Methods Human subjects ethics for this study was reviewed and approved by the Indiana University Institutional Review Board and in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration. In accordance with HRQOL instrument development protocols, the PedsQL™ NF1 Module was designed through the following five phases – 1) literature review; 2) outline of the instrument; 3) pilot instrument development – a) focus group/semi-structured interviews, b) cognitive interviews, c) experts’ review; 4) pilot testing and 5) field testing. Phase 1 – literature review We conducted an extensive literature search in Pub Med database for symptoms and signs of NF1 [ 5 - 9 , 23 - 34 ] (complete search methods and table of references available on request). The HRQOL literature was reviewed for measures pertinent to NF1 [ 35 - 39 ]. Phase 2 – outline of the instrument Clinicians taking care of patients with NF1 at Indiana University Hospitals, Indianapolis, IN, were interviewed to learn about their experiences with NF1. An initial outline of the instrument was developed based on literature review and clinicians’ experiences. Pertinent questions were drawn from the existing PedsQL™ Arthritis, Cancer, Cerebral Palsy and Family Impact Modules [ 36 - 39 ]. Instrument domains were designed to address HRQOL issues specific to NF1. Phase 3 – pilot instrument development The initial instrument was modified after conducting a focus group or semi-structured interview, cognitive interviews and experts’ review. a) Focus group/Semi-structured interview: Information about the focus group was advertised in the NF clinic at Indiana University Hospitals. Individuals were enrolled into the focus group if they had NF1 and were willing to talk about their disorder and its effect on their health and well-being. Written-informed consent was obtained from all participants. We conducted one focus group of three individuals and 2 semi-structured interviews with two adults with NF1. Participants were encouraged to speak about how NF1 affected their health and well-being. All interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed and de-identified for research purposes. By interpretative phenomenological analysis [ 40 , 41 ], new domains were identified from the focus group/semi-structured interviews, specifically, Skin Irritation, Sensation, Movement and Balance and Sexual Functioning. b) Cognitive interviews: An initial draft instrument was administered at the NF clinic. Cognitive interviewing of the participants was done to find out problems with wording of items, interpretation of instructions and to estimate the time required to complete the surveys. The items were revised after receiving the participants’ feedback. c) Experts’ review: The modified instrument was further reviewed by NF1 researchers and clinicians. After cognitive interviews and expert reviews, additional changes were made which included rewording “sensitive skin” to “rough skin” in the Skin Irritation domain and adding “not applicable” as a choice in the Sexual Functioning domain. The pilot instrument developed as a result has 16 domains and 74 items. The 74-item PedsQL™ NF1 Module: Adult self- report instrument comprises 16 domains/subscales: 1) Physical Functioning (8 items), 2) Emotional Functioning (5 items), 3) Social Functioning (3 items), 4) Cognitive Functioning (5 items), 5) Communication (3 items), 6) Worry (7 items), 7) Perceived Physical Appearance (3 items), 8) Pain and Hurt (3 items), 9) Paresthesias (2 items), 10) Skin Irritation (5 items), 11) Sensation (4 items), 12) Movement and Balance (4 items), 13) Daily Activities (12 items), 14) Fatigue (3 items), 15) Treatment Anxiety (4 items) and 16) Sexual Functioning (3 items). The NF1 HRQOL format, instructions, and Likert response scale are similar to the PedsQL™ 4.0 Generic Core Scales and other PedsQL™ Disease-Specific Modules. Although originally developed for use in children, the PedsQL™ format has been extended to adults with a generic instrument as well as several disease specific instruments [ 35 ]. The instructions ask how much of a problem each item has been during the past one month. A 5-point response scale is used for all items (0 = never a problem, 1 = almost never a problem, 2 = sometimes a problem, 3 = often a problem, 4 = almost always a problem). Items are reverse scored and linearly transformed to a scale of 0–100 similar to PedsQL™ 4.0 Generic Core Scales (0 = 100, 1 = 75, 2 = 50, 3 = 25, 4 = 0) [ 35 ]. Hence, higher scores signify better HRQOL [ 42 , 43 ] and fewer symptoms or problems. The Total Score is computed as the sum of all items on the PedsQL™ NF1 Module divided by the number of items answered (this accounts for missing data). Subscale scores are computed as the sum of the items divided by the number of items that were answered in that subscale. If more than 50% of the items in the subscale are missing, the subscale score is not computed [ 44 ]. Information about demographics is not included in the instrument except for age of the participant. In addition, participants were asked to rate their health status on a Likert scale as – excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor. Phase 4 – pilot testing The PedsQL™ NF1 pilot instrument was tested at the Children’s Tumor Foundation sponsored NF forum in July 2011 in Minnesota, to check for the initial feasibility and internal consistency reliability. All participants with NF1 who were not involved in prior phases of instrument development, were encouraged to fill out the surveys. A sample of 10 adults with NF1 completed the surveys. The mean age of the participants was 40.5 y (range 20 to 62 y). Feasibility was measured by the average time taken to complete the survey and by the percentage of missing responses [ 44 ]. Internal consistency reliability was measured by computing Cronbach’s coefficient alpha [ 45 ]. Pilot testing showed that, on an average, participants took 6 minutes to complete the survey (range 4 to 8 min). The missing response rate was 2.3% (n = 17), with the Sexual Functioning domain having the highest number of missing responses (n = 10). Two participants were missing 1 response in Physical Functioning, one participant was missing 3 responses in Perceived Physical Appearance, one participant was missing 1 response and three participants were missing all 3 responses in the Sexual Functioning domain. The Worry and Movement & Balance domains each had 1 missing response. Total scale internal consistency reliability was 0.82, showing adequate initial internal consistency of the instrument. Pilot testing provided initial support with adequate feasibility and internal consistency to proceed to the next phase of instrument development. Phase 5 – field testing This final phase consisted of a larger NF1 sample across the country to determine feasibility, reliability and validity of PedsQL™ NF1 Module scales. Sample & setting Participants were recruited from the NF clinic at Indiana University hospitals and national NF1 conferences from July 2011 to February 2012. In addition, the NF1 module for adults was placed online and web-links were advertised through NF organizations by publishing information about the study in their newsletters and websites (NF Midwest and Texas NF foundation). A sample of 124 adults completed the surveys. Pilot surveys (n = 10) are included in this sample since they showed no significant difference in mean subscale scores by independent samples t-test ( p  > 0.05). Mean age of the participants was 40.2 years, ranging from 20 to 71 years. Statistical analysis Scale internal consistency reliability was determined by calculating Cronbach’s coefficient alpha [ 45 ]. For each subscale, “Cronbach’s alpha if item deleted” was determined to see if subscale reliability improves with the removal of the item. Subscale reliabilities of 0.70 or more are recommended for comparing patient groups, whereas reliability of 0.90 is recommended for analyzing individual patient scale scores [ 46 , 47 ]. Considering the small sample size, the Sexual Functioning domain was excluded from the analyses as it had the highest missing responses. Exploratory factor analysis using Promax rotation was conducted for the remaining 71 items. Item loadings were assessed using a cut-off value of 0.30 to see whether items loaded high on one and only one factor (i.e., ‘simple structure’) and whether the collection of items that loaded high on each factor formed a conceptually relevant subscale. Feasibility was measured by the percentage of missing values [ 44 ]. Multitrait scaling analysis was performed to find out the extent to which individual items correlated with the hypothesized subscale construct rather than with other subscales [ 48 ]. We also examined the item-hypothesized subscale correlations (corrected by removing the item from the Total Score) and we used a cutoff of 0.40 or higher for indicating good item discrimination [ 44 , 45 ]. Multitrait scaling analyses were summarized via tests of individual item scaling success, defined as the number of times an item correlated higher with its hypothesized subscale construct rather than with another subscale by ≥ 2 standard errors [ 44 ], which provided an approximation of scaling success. The percentage of item scaling successes relative to the total number of item scaling tests was calculated for each subscale [ 44 , 49 ]. Construct validity of the instrument was determined using the known-groups method, which compares subscale scores across groups known to differ in the health construct being investigated [ 44 , 50 ]. NF1 participants were divided into 3 groups based on their self-reported health status – ‘excellent to very good’ (n = 47), ‘good’ (n = 46), and ‘fair to poor’ (n = 41). Mean subscale scores were compared among these 3 groups using one-way ANOVA. Effect sizes were calculated for the subscale scores to estimate the magnitude of differences. Effect sizes are designated as small (.20), medium (.50) and large (.80) in magnitude [ 51 ]. Statistical analyses were done using SPSS 18 version for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago IL, USA) and SAS 9.3 version for Windows (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).",Kavitha Nutakki; Cynthia M Hingtgen; Patrick Monahan; James W Varni; Nancy L Swigonski,Health and quality of life outcomes,2013-02-21,10.1186/1477-7525-11-21,minimal,True
PMID:29409008,"Targeted next-generation sequencing for differential diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 2, schwannomatosis, and meningiomatosis.","BACKGROUND: Clinical overlap between neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), schwannomatosis, and meningiomatosis can make clinical diagnosis difficult. Hence, molecular investigation of germline and tumor tissues may improve the diagnosis. METHODS: We present the targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of NF2, SMARCB1, LZTR1, SMARCE1, and SUFU tumor suppressor genes, using an amplicon-based approach. We analyzed blood DNA from a cohort of 196 patients, including patients with NF2 (N = 79), schwannomatosis (N = 40), meningiomatosis (N = 12), and no clearly established diagnosis (N = 65). Matched tumor DNA was analyzed when available. Forty-seven NF2-/SMARCB1-negative schwannomatosis patients and 27 NF2-negative meningiomatosis patients were also evaluated. RESULTS: A NF2 variant was found in 41/79 (52%) NF2 patients. SMARCB1 or LZTR1 variants were identified in 5/40 (12.5%) and 13/40 (∼32%) patients in the schwannomatosis cohort. Potentially pathogenic variants were found in 12/65 (18.5%) patients with no clearly established diagnosis. A LZTR1 variant was identified in 16/47 (34%) NF2/SMARCB1-negative schwannomatosis patients. A SMARCE1 variant was found in 3/39 (∼8%) meningiomatosis patients. No SUFU variant was found in the cohort. NGS was an effective and sensitive method to detect mutant alleles in blood or tumor DNA of mosaic NF2 patients. Interestingly, we identified a 4-hit mechanism resulting in the complete NF2 loss-of-function combined with SMARCB1 and LZTR1 haploinsufficiency in two-thirds of tumors from NF2 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous investigation of NF2, SMARCB1, LZTR1, and SMARCE1 is a key element in the differential diagnosis of NF2, schwannomatosis, and meningiomatosis. The targeted NGS strategy is suitable for the identification of NF2 mosaicism in blood and for the investigation of tumors from these patients.",,Camille Louvrier; Eric Pasmant; Audrey Briand-Suleau; Joëlle Cohen; Patrick Nitschké; Juliette Nectoux; Lucie Orhant; Cécile Zordan; Cyril Goizet; Stéphane Goutagny; Dominique Lallemand; Michel Vidaud; Dominique Vidaud; Michel Kalamarides; Béatrice Parfait,Neuro-oncology,2018-06-18,10.1093/neuonc/noy009,abstract_only,False
PMID:18055911,Deletions of NF1 gene and exons detected by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification.,"To estimate the contribution of single and multi-exon NF1 gene copy-number changes to the NF1 mutation spectrum, we analysed a series of 201 Italian patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Of these, 138 had previously been found, using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography or protein truncation test, to be heterozygous for intragenic NF1 point mutations/deletions/insertions, and were excluded from this analysis. The remaining 63 patients were analysed using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), which allows detection of deletions or duplications encompassing >or=1 NF1 exons, as well as entire gene deletions. MLPA results were validated using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) or fluorescent in situ hybridisation. MLPA screening followed by real-time qPCR detected a total of 23 deletions. Of these deletions, six were single exon, eight were multi-exon, and nine were of the entire NF1 gene. In our series, deletions encompassing >or=1 NF1 exons accounted for approximately 7% (14/201) of the NF1 gene mutation spectrum, suggesting that screening for these should now be systematically included in genetic testing of patients with NF1.",,A De Luca; I Bottillo; M C Dasdia; A Morella; V Lanari; L Bernardini; L Divona; S Giustini; L Sinibaldi; A Novelli; I Torrente; A Schirinzi; B Dallapiccola,Journal of medical genetics,2007-12,10.1136/jmg.2007.053785,abstract_only,False
PMID:21681782,Nf1 mutant mice with p19ARF gene loss develop accelerated hematopoietic disease resembling acute leukemia with a variable phenotype.,"Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia (JMML) is a relentlessly progressive myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic (MPD/MDS) hematopoietic disorder more common in patients with any one of at least three distinct genetic lesions, specifically NF1 gene loss and PTPN11 and NRAS mutations. NF1 and PTPN11 are molecular lesions associated with Neurofibromatosis Syndrome Type I (NF1 Syndrome) and Noonan's Syndrome, respectively. The occurrence of JMML is rare; even among those predisposed with these syndromes to development of disease, and secondary genetic events likely contribute to the development and progression of disease. In NF1 syndrome, loss of p53 function is a common event in solid tumors, but uncommon in JMML, suggesting that the p53 pathway may be modified by other events in this hematopoietic disorder. The work presented here investigates the possible role of the p19(Arf) (p19) tumor suppressor in development of MPD associated with Nf1 gene loss in mice. We find that Nf1 mutant hematopoietic cells with loss of p19 develop accelerated hematopoietic disease similar to acute leukemia with a variable phenotype. This suggests that p19 may play a role in development of JMML and evaluation of the human p19 homolog (p14(ARF)) in JMML may be informative.","Materials and Methods Mouse strains Mice with the  p19  mutation were a kind gift from Dr. Martine Roussel at St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital, Memphis, TN.  Mx1-Cre ,  Nf1 flox , and  Nf1 fcr  ( Nf1  knockout) mice have been described previously [ 23 – 25 ]. To initiate generation of experimental groups,  Mx1-Cre  mice on a C57BL/6 × C3H background were crossed to the  Nf1 flox  mice on a C57BL/6 background to generate  Nf1 flox;Mx1-Cre  animals. The  p19  knock-out mice on a C57BL/6 × 129/Sv background were crossed to  Nf1 fcr  mice on a C57BL/6 background to generate  Nf1 fcr /+; p19 −/+ animals. Subsequently,  Mx1-Cre;p19 −/+ mice were crossed to  Nf1 flox;p19 −/+ mice to generate the required  Mx1-Cre;p19  knock-out recombinant. Once the recombinant was generated,  Nf1 fcr/ + ;p19 −/+ mice were crossed to  Nf1  + /flox;Mx1-Cre;p19 −/+ mice to generate both  Nf1 fcr/flox;Mx1-Cre;p19 −/− and  Nf1  + /flox;Mx1-Cre;p19 −/− donor animals. Separately,  Nf1 fcr/ + ;p19 −/+ mice were crossed to  Nf1 flox/ + ;Mx1-Cre  mice to generate donors with the following genotypes:  Nf1 fcr/flox;Mx1-Cre;p19 +/+,  Nf1 fcr/flox;Mx1-Cre;p19 −/+, and  Nf1  + /flox;Mx1-Cre;p19 −/. To establish an Ly5.1/Ly5.2 mismatch, recipient animals were generated by crossing 129/Sv mice to C57BL/6J mice. The recipient offspring therefore are congenic at the  Ly5.1  locus, providing a mechanism by which to distinguish recipient Ly5.1 + , Ly5.2 +  cells from donor Ly5.1 − , Ly5.2 +  cells. Treatment of mice Recipient C57BL/6J × 129/Sv F1 mice were sublethally irradiated in a Mark 1 Model 30 Cs137 irradiator (J.L. Shepherd & Associates, San Fernando, CA) with 900 rads gamma radiation. Bone marrow was flushed from the long bones of the hind legs of donor animals, washed and resuspended in PBS. Viable cells were counted by trypan blue exclusion and the concentration adjusted for injection. Twenty-four hours post irradiation, 5 × 10 6  freshly isolated nucleated cells were injected via the tail vein. One week post transplant, recipient animals were given a series of three 250 μL intraperitoneal injections in five days of polyinosinc-polycytidylic acid (pIpC, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at a concentration of 1 μg/μL suspended in sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS). All animals were housed under specific pathogen free conditions. Peripheral blood was obtained by retro-orbital puncture. The eye was anesthetized with a 0.5% ophthalmic solution of proparacaine hydrochloride (Falcon Pharmaceuticals, Fort Worth, TX), blood was collected in EDTA coated 50 μL capillary tubes (Drummond Scientific, Broomall, PA) and transferred to a mini capillary blood collection tube (Ram Scientific, Needham, MA) for later analysis. Upon completion of the collection, neocidin ophthalmic ointment (Major Pharmaceuticals, Livonia MI) was applied to the eye to prevent infection. Affected animals were humanely killed by CO 2  asphyxiation for the harvest of the required tissues. Irradiated animals were maintained on antibiotics (amoxicillin or trimethoprim/sulfa) 3 weeks post irradiation to prevent opportunistic infection. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Minnesota approved all procedures. PCR PCR was performed on gDNA for the  Nf1 fcr  and  flox  alleles as described previously [ 24 , 25 ].  Mx1-Cre  genotyping was performed using 0.2 mM of dNTPs, 3.0 mM of MgCl 2 , 0.5 μM of primers, and 0.5 units of polymerase. PCR entailed an initial denaturation of 94° C for 10 min, then 30 cycles of 94° C for 1 min, 60° C for 1min and 72° C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72° C for 5 min. Two primers (Cre-1 and Cre-2) were used to amplify a 200-bp band from the transgene. Primers used were (5′ to 3′) Cre-1, CTGTTACGTATAGCCGAAAT and Cre-2, CTACACCAGAGACGGAAATC. PCR to amplify the  p19  allele was performed under the following conditions: 0.25 mM of dNTPs, 0.5 μM of primers and 1.0 unit of Taq polymerase (QIAGEN); and the program: 94° C for 3 min, 30 cycles of 94° C for 1 min, 66° C for 1min and 72° C for 2 min, and then a hold at 72° C for 5 min. Two primers (ARF-1 and ARF-2) were used to amplify a 415-bp band from endogenous wild type allele. A third primer (ARF-NEO) was used with ARF-2 to amplify a 250-bp band from the knock out allele. The sequence for the primers (5′ to 3′) are: ARF-1, GTA CAGCAGCGGGAGCATGG; ARF-2, TTGAGGAGGACCGTGAAGCCG; and ARF-NEO, ACCACACTGCTCGACATTGGG. Flow cytometry Nucleated cells from total bone marrow were flushed from the long bones of the leg or single cell suspensions made from spleen tissue. Red cells in the spleen and peripheral blood were lysed by suspension in red cell lysis buffer (0.15M NH 4 Cl, 1.0M NaHCO 3 , 0.1M Na 2 EDTA) for 3 min, then an equal volume of PBS was added to stabilize the remaining cells. Cells were pelleted and nucleated cells were washed once in FACS buffer (PBS, 2% fetal bovine serum, 0.1% sodium azide), counted, and resuspended in FACS buffer. Blocking antibody (anti-CD16/CD32) was added to the cell suspensions and incubated 15 min. Specific antibodies were added, the cells incubated 25 min and then washed. All incubations were performed on ice protected from light to prevent capping. Stained cells were resuspended and stored in 1% formaldehyde in PBS until analysis. All phenotyping antibodies were obtained from Becton-Dickenson (BD). All flow cytometry was performed on a FACS Calibur (BD). Acquisition and data analysis was performed using CellQuest Pro software (BD). Peripheral blood analysis Peripheral blood was analyzed using a HemaVet Mascot 800 hematology analyzer (CDC Technologies, Oxford, CT). Commercial controls were run each day the instrument was used and the instrument was calibrated semiannually or as control results indicated. Peripheral blood smears obtained during retro-orbital puncture were fixed within 2 hr of collection in absolute methanol. For staining, fixed slides were immersed in Modified Wright-Giemsa Stain (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 30 min. Slides were then transferred to a solution of 20% v/v stain in 1X Wright-Giemsa Buffer (from a 5× solution containing 0.25M KH 2 PO 4  and 0.3M Na 2 HPO 4 (7H 2 O, pH 6.4). Slides were rinsed three times in distilled water and allowed to air dry before mounting.

PMID:23175151,MicroRNA profiling of peripheral nerve sheath tumours identifies miR-29c as a tumour suppressor gene involved in tumour progression.,"BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 is one of the most common familial diseases, the hallmark of which is the development of multiple neurofibromas. These are benign nerve sheath tumours, which can transform into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNST). METHODS: The aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed microRNA (miRNA) in neurofibromas and MPNST obtained from patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 using microarray analysis. Differential expression was validated by reverse transcription quantitative-PCR, and functional studies were performed after transfection of miRNA oligonucleotide mimics into MPNST cells. RESULTS: Sixteen miRNA were significantly differentially expressed in MPNST compared with NF, and of these fourteen were downregulated in MPNST: these included miR-30e*, miR-29c*, miR-29c, miR-340*, miR-30c, miR-139-5p, miR-195, miR-151-5p, miR-342-5p, miR-146a, miR-150, miR-223, let-7 a and let-7 g with a false discovery rate of q=8.48E-03 for the least significant miRNA. In contrast, miR-210 and miR-339-5p were upregulated in MPNST compared with neurofibromas. Prediction softwares/algorithms identified a list of genes targeted by miR-29c including extracellular matrix genes and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, all of which are reported to be involved in cell migration and invasion. Functional studies in a MPNST cell line, sNF96.2, using a mimic of the mature miR-29c showed reduced invasion, whereas there was no change in proliferation. Zymography of the manipulated cells showed that MMP2 activity was also reduced when miR-29c expression was forced in sNF96.2. CONCLUSION: We provide evidence that reduction of miR-29c has a pivotal role in the progression of nerve sheath tumours and results by increasing the invasive/migratory properties of nerve sheath tumours.","Methods: The aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed microRNA (miRNA) in neurofibromas and MPNST obtained from patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 using microarray analysis. Differential expression was validated by reverse transcription quantitative–PCR, and functional studies were performed after transfection of miRNA oligonucleotide mimics into MPNST cells. Materials and methods Clinical samples This study was approved by the Central Office for Research Ethics Committee (REC 07/Q0506/8). The material was obtained from the histopathology department of The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital and three cases from Department of Clinical Genetics were kindly provided by Dr Fredrik Mertens, Lund University Hospital, Lund, Sweden. The pathology slides were reviewed, diagnosed and graded according to WHO guidelines ( Kleihues and Cavenee, 2000 ;  Fletcher  ). The material for the study included frozen material obtained from 10 neurofibromas (four female, six male) and 10 high-grade MPNSTs (five female, five male) from patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. Analysis of the same 10 neurofibromas and 10 MPNST individually by reverse transcription quantitative–PCR (RT–qPCR) for  et al , 2002 neurofibromin 1  expression confirmed very-low expression of the gene in both the neurofibromas and MPNST cases compared with HEK293T cells, which are  neurofibromin 1  wildtype (WT) ( Supplementary Figure S1A ,  Supplementary Table S1  for primers sequences). This finding along with loss of heterozygosity of the  neurofibromin 1  locus, as recently reported by SNP genotyping analysis on the pooled samples from the same 10 neurofibromas and 10 MPNST ( Feber  ), is consistent with functionally biallelic inactivation of  et al , 2011 neurofibromin 1  in these tumours ( Legius  ;  et al , 1993 Colman  ). et al , 1995 An additional 116 tumours (56 neurofibromas and 60 MPNST) obtained from patients with and without neurofibromatosis type 1 were used for validation purposes. Cell culture The human MPNST cell line sNF96.2, was kindly provided by Dr Abhijit Guha (The hospital for Sick Children MaRS, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). We confirmed the reported germline mutation in exon 21 (3683delC) and loss of the remaining WT allele in the cell line before use in our study compared with HT1080 WT for  neurofibromin 1  ( Supplementary Figure 1B ,  Supplementary Table S1  for primers sequences) ( Perrin  ). The cell line was grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin and streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO et al , 2007 2  incubator. Nucleic acid isolation Between 20 and 30 frozen sections (20  μ m) from sampled neoplasms comprising at least 60% tumour cells were used for nucleic acid extraction. Total RNA, including miRNA was extracted using the miRNAeasy kit (Qiagen Ltd, Crawley, West Sussex, UK). Agilent Human miRNA Microarray V2 and data analysis The small RNA fraction was assessed using the Agilent small RNA Kit Lab-on-Chip (Agilent Technologies UK Ltd, Wokingham, UK). Quality and integrity of the RNA fraction, between 6 and 150 nucleotides, was quantified using the Agilent 2100 bioanalyser (Agilent Technologies). Hundred nanogram of total RNA per sample was labelled and hybridised to the Agilent Human miRNA microarray V2 (Agilent Technologies). Microarray slides were scanned using an Agilent microarray scanner G2 505B (Agilent Technologies) and microarray images were automatically analysed using Feature extractionTM software, version 9.5.1.1 (Agilent Technologies). microRNA analysis was carried out using Bioconductor packages for the R statistical programming language ( Gentleman  ). The median (gMedianSignal) was background subtracted (gBGUsed) and then the arrays normalised to each other using the ‘normexp' function ( et al , 2004 Ritchie  ) of the  et al , 2007 limma  package. The  limma  package was also used for differential expression and multiple testing was controlled using the false discovery rate ( q -value). Quantitation of miRNA by TaqMan assay MicroRNA expression in each sample, and the cell line, was measured using TaqMan miRNA assays technology (Applied Biosystems Inc., Life Technologies, Foster City, CA, USA) on a Mastercycler realplex Eppendorf detection system (Eppendorf, Histon, Cambs., UK). This RT–qPCR method specifically detects mature miRNA, but not precursor miRNA (pre and pri-miRNA). The TaqMan assay was performed using the same amount of total RNA (5 ng) that was transcribed into cDNA (Applied Biosystems Inc.), and Ct-values were recorded. The mean of three independent analyses was calculated and an internal control small RNA, RNU66 was used to normalise the miRNA expression data for each sample (Applied Biosystems). Detection of the target genes by RT–qPCR Approximately 150–200 ng of the total RNA extracted from each sample was reverse transcribed using Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis kit (Invitrogen Ltd/Life Technologies Ltd, Paisley, Scotland, UK). Specific gene primers were designed with Primer 3 ( http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/ ) and real-time PCR was performed with a SYBR green mix from Applied Biosystems ( Supplementary Table S1  for primer sequences). The average of three independent analyses for each target gene and sample was calculated and was normalised to the endogenous reference control gene,  GAPDH . Mimic miR-29c transient transfection The MPNST cell line, sNF96.2, was transfected in six-well plates using oligofectamine (Invitrogen) giving a final concentration of 100 nM of miRNA mimics (Dharmacon Inc., Lafayette, CO, USA). Cells were harvested after 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h following exposure to the mimics, after which total RNA including miRNA were extracted (Qiagen). Functional studies Migration assay After 2 days of transfection with miR-29c, and scrambled-miR, sNF96.2 cells were harvested and ∼25 000 cells were plated in transwell plates with a polycarbonate membrane (8.5 mm diameter, 8.0  μ m pore size) (Corning distributed by Appleton Woods, Birmingham, UK) and incubated for 6 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde, permeabilised with 0.1% Triton X-100 and stained with GelRed (Cambridge Bioscience, Cambridge, Cambs., UK). The number of cells that migrated across the filters was counted in 4 high-power fields per experiment, and the values averaged. Scratch/wound healing assay Two days after transfection with miR-29c and scrambled miRNA, the sNF96.2 cells were harvested and re-plated in six-well plates. On reaching confluency, a scratch was made through the central axis of the plate using a 10  μ l pipette tip. The live-cell imaging system, IncuCyte (Essen BioScience Ltd, Herts., UK) was used to monitor the migration of cells across the scratch for 60 h. Gelatin zymography Two days after siRNA transfection of sNF96.2 cells the medium was changed to serum-free medium (350  μ l (Optimem; Invitrogen Ltd) for overnight incubation after which the supernatant was collected and spun to remove floating cells. At the same time, the cells were lysed using lysis buffer (0.1% Triton x-100 in 0.05 Trizma base, 0.2 M NaCl, 0.005 CaCl 2 ) in non-reduced conditions (no heating and no reducing reagents). The supernatants and cell extracts were separated using 10% acrylamide gels containing 0.1% gelatin type A from porcine skin (Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK) with non-reducing conditions. The gels were incubated in a 2.5% Triton X-100 solution at room temperature with gentle agitation for 1 h and then soaked in reaction buffer (50 mℳ Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mℳ NaCl, and 10 mM CaCl 2 ) at 37 °C overnight. The gels were stained with 0.5% Coomassie Blue R250 in 30% methanol/10% in H 2 O for 1 h and then de-stained (staining solution without Coomassie Blue) for 0.5 h after which they were fixed in 0.2% glacial acetic acid. Zones of gelatinolytic activity were revealed by negative staining. Cell viability assay sNF96.2 cells were plated in triplicate at 25 000 cells per well in 96-well plates, and analysed at four time points, over 3 days. Cell proliferation was assessed using the MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2 H-tetrazolium, inner salt) assay (CellTiter 96 AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay; Promega, Southampton, UK). Cell viability was determined by absorbance measurements at 490 nm using a plate reader (Varioskan Flash, Thermo electrone corporation, Vantaa, Finland). Growth curve The rate of cellular proliferation was determined during and after transfection using a live-cell imaging system IncuCyte HD. The kinetic growth curves were calculated using the integrated confluence algorithm and the result was provided as the percentage of confluency. Western blotting Whole-cell lysate preparation and western blot analysis were performed in non-reduced conditions using Radio Immuno Precipitation Assay lysis buffer as described ( Presneau  ). The primary antibodies used included: mouse monoclonal (CA-4001) matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2 and rabbit monoclonal (EP1254) MMP9 (dilution 1 : 1000; incubation overnight at 4 °C, Abcam, Cambridge, Cambs., UK), MMP3 (dilution 1 : 50; incubation overnight at 4 °C, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and GAPDH mouse mAb (6C5) (dilution 1 : 5000; incubation 1 h at room temperature; Advanced Immunochemical Inc., Long Beach, CA, USA). et al , 2009 Statistical analysis All experiments were performed as independent replicates and error bars correspond to the s.d. from the calculated mean.  χ 2 -tests, Fisher exact tests, paired  t -test or Wilcoxon tests were used, where applicable, to analyse differences between independent variants using R console ( http://www.r-project.org/index.html ) or GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). Differences were considered significant if  P <0.05.",N Presneau; M Eskandarpour; T Shemais; S Henderson; D Halai; R Tirabosco; A M Flanagan,British journal of cancer,2013-03-05,10.1038/bjc.2012.518,minimal,True
PMID:40191916,"The draft genome of the Wisconsin Miniature SwineTM, a valuable biomedical research tool.","Porcine biomedical models have emerged as valuable tools in biomedical research due to their physiological, anatomical, metabolic, immunological, and genetic similarities to humans. As a result, they offer greater relevance for translational studies than rodent models. Moreover, compared to nonhuman primates, porcine models are more cost-effective, easier to manipulate genetically, and raise fewer ethical concerns. However, the conventional breeds of swine most commonly used in research have rapid growth rates, which lead to logistical challenges such as increased space requirements, making them impractical as biomedical models. The Wisconsin Miniature SwineTM (WMSTM) was developed to address these shortcomings. The WMSTM porcine model grows slower, reaching and maintaining human sizes at adulthood. The model was also specifically designed to possess more human-like physiology that allows for easy modeling of comorbidities like obesity and metabolic syndrome that affect a large portion of the human population affected by chronic diseases. Thus, WMS™ is an ideal porcine gene editing platform for modeling complex multifactorial diseases. Here, we present the first draft genome assembly representative of the WMSTM line. The primary assembly was generated with ∼20× coverage of long reads from Oxford Nanopore Technologies and independently error-corrected using 23× Pacific Biosciences reads. Arima Genomics Hi-C data were used to improve contiguity. Largely congruent with the existing Sus scrofa genome, we also show the utility of WMSTM as a model through comparisons between 2 WMSTM genes and human homologs. Finally, we show the utility of genotyping by sequencing across WMSTM herds. The WMSTM genome generated here is highly complete and supports investigators utilizing WMSTM in biomedical research.","Materials and methods Herd maintenance The animal protocols related to this work were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in accordance with the  Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals  and the Animal Welfare Act. The WMS TM -WT and WMS TM -FH lines are housed at the University of Wisconsin Swine Research and Teaching Center (Arlington, WI), a specific pathogen-free facility. Both lines receive the same diet, formulated with essential macronutrients and micronutrients to meet their requirements for normal growth and development. Sample preparation A whole blood sample was collected from a representative adult male WMS TM -WT pig (“Benny;” Pig ID: 18-4274-3; Age: 1 yr, 6 months, 25 d) for the purpose of genome assembly. The boar used in this study was frequently used for breeding in the WMS TM -WT herd. Additional blood samples were obtained from both the WMS TM -WT and WMS TM -FH lines to conduct genotyping by sequencing (GBS) analysis. These collected samples were submitted to the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center DNA Sequencing Facility for processing. High molecular weight (HMW) DNA (25 µg) was extracted from leukocytes using the Circulomics Nanobind CBB Big DNA kit (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA). Nucleic acid concentrations were quantified with the Quant-iT TM  PicoGreenTM dsDNA and Qubit TM  dsDNA High Sensitivity kits (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) used for Oxford Nanopore and Pacific biosciences (PacBio) runs, respectively. The concentrations (A260/A280) and purity (A260/A230) of DNA were determined using a NanoDrop TM  One spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Finally, the sizing and quality of diluted samples were assessed using the FemtoPulse System (Agilent Technologies, Madison, WI, USA). The average read size, between 40,000 and 508,400 bp, was 244,172 (bp). Whole genome sequencing Whole genome sequencing was performed using 2 third-generation sequencing platforms and a genome-wide proximity ligation (Hi-C) method, resulting in an error-corrected, chromosome-scale assembly of the WMS™ genome. Oxford nanopore technologies sequencing Oxford nanopore technologies (ONT) sequencing was utilized to generate the initial reads used for assembling the WMS TM  draft genome. Sequencing libraries were prepared from 3 µg of input DNA using the SQK-LSK109 ligation sequencing kit (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) and quantified with the Qubit TM  dsDNA High Sensitivity Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific). The sequencing was performed on 5 MinION flow cells processed on a GridION instrument (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). PacBio sequencing PacBio sequencing was utilized to obtain highly accurate reads to error correct (“polish”) the assembly produced by the ONT reads. A PacBio HiFi SMRTBell library was prepared from 5 µg of input DNA according to PN 101-693-800 Version 01 (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA), with the following modifications: (1) shearing with gTUBES (Covaris, LLC, Woburn, MA, USA) and (2) size selection with BluePippin (Sage Sciences, Beverly, MA, USA). The quality of the library was determined by the FemtoPulse System (Agilent Technologies, Madison, WI, USA), and the Qubit TM  dsDNA High Sensitivity Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to quantify the library preparation. PacBio sequencing was performed on a Sequel I instrument (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA) with 4 PacBio 4 M SMRT cells. Arima Hi-C sequencing Hi-C sequencing was utilized to scaffold the error-corrected ONT draft genome assembly. Sample processing, crosslinking, and Hi-C library preparation were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions for the Arima HiC v1 kit for Mammalian Blood (Material Part Number: A410030, Document Part Number: A160104 v01; Arima Genomics, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and the KAPA Hyper Prep Kit (Roche, Basel, CH) with the following modifications: during PBMC isolation, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used for the first step as directed but subsequent steps used fetal bovine serum (FBS) and adapter ligation was increased from 15 min to 1 h. Library quality was assessed with an Agilent TapeStation (Agilent Technologies) and quantified with a Qubit TM  dsDNA High Sensitivity (ThermoFisher Scientific) kit. The resulting Illumina TruSeq library was sequenced as paired-end (2 × 150 bp) reads on a NovaSeq6000 (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Genome assembly ONT reads meeting a minimum Q-value of 10 (phred scale) were size- and chimera-filtered (minimum length = 10,000 bp) to approximately 23× coverage with Filtlong v0.2.0 ( https://github.com/rrwick/Filtlong ) and Porechop v0.2.4 ( https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop ). Filtered reads were assembled with Flye v2.5, enforcing a 10,000 bp overlap minimum ( Kolmogorov  ). Assembled sequences <10,000 bp were filtered from the draft assembly. Approximately 20× PacBio subread coverage was used with GCpp v1.0.0-1807624 ( et al . 2019 https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/gcpp ) to independently error-correct the ONT-based Flye assembly. The resulting error-corrected haploid (pseudohaploid) assembly was deduplicated ( i.e.  identification of syntenic elements, keeping only 1 element) with purge_haplotigs commit be7e44b ( https://bitbucket.org/mroachawri/purge_haplotigs/src/master/ ) ( Roach  ). Juicer v1.6.2 ( et al . 2018 https://github.com/aidenlab/juicer ) and 3D-DNA v180114 ( https://github.com/aidenlab/3d-dna ) were used to scaffold the deduplicated, error-corrected assembly with the Hi-C data ( Durand  ;  et al . 2016 Dudchenko  ). We assessed the quality of our genome assembly using BUSCO v5.7.0 with mammalia_odb10 ( et al . 2017 https://busco.ezlab.org/ ) and QUASTv5.0.2 ( https://quast.sourceforge.net/ ) ( Gurevich  ;  et al . 2013 Manni  ). et al . 2021 Gene identification Putative genes in the WMS TM  draft genome were identified using Liftoff v1.6.3 ( https://github.com/agshumate/Liftoff ) with default parameters against the reference  S. scrofa  Ensembl  a nnotation for Sscrofa11.1 (The Swine Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2017, Genome assembly Sscrofa11.1, NCBI, GCF_000003025.6), genebuild 2022-02 ( Shumate and Salzberg 2021 ). Gene diversity analysis The draft WMS TM  genome and annotation files produced here were interrogated for the  NF1  (neurofibromin) and  AHR  (aryl hydrocarbon receptor) genes. For each putative WMS TM  gene, we extracted the entire annotated gene sequence and aligned it to the  S. scrofa  reference coding sequence (CDS) using the align sequences feature in SnapGene TM  Version 7.2.1 (GSL Biotech, Boston, MA, USA). The reference sequence was selected based on Ensembl's canonical distinction. The aligned CDS from the WMS TM  gene were translated and aligned to the respective translated CDS in  S. scrofa  as well as the canonical human CDS using SnapGene TM  software. The BLOSUM62 similarity matrix was used to delineate similar amino acids. The WMS TM  and human amino acid sequences were then input into AlphaFold 3 for structural predictions using the same seed sequence ( Abramson  ). The structural predictions from WMS et al . 2024 TM  and human proteins were aligned using PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 3.0.5 Schrödinger, LLC.) Genotype by sequencing Genetic variation across the WMS TM -WT and WMS TM -FH herds was assessed using genotype-by-sequencing (GBS), a method licensed to the UW-Madison Biotechnology Center by KeyGene N.V. (Wageningen, NL). GBS libraries were prepared as previously described with minimal modification ( Elshire  ). Whole blood was collected from individuals across both herds, and DNA was isolated with a QIAamp 96 DNA QIAcube HT Kit. One hundred-fifty nanograms of purified DNA was then digested by the restriction enzymes NsiI and MspI. Barcoded adaptors compatible with Illumina sequencers were added to restricted-DNA by ligation using T4 ligase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, Mass.). Three plates, each containing up to 96 adapter-ligated samples, were each pooled and amplified to generate a sufficient sequencing template. Adapter dimers were removed by SPRI bead purification. The quality and quantity of the finished libraries were assessed using the Agilent TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, Calif.) and Qubit et al . 2011 TM  dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Life Technologies, Grand Island, N.Y.), respectively. Libraries were sequenced on a NovaSeq6000 S2 platform (Illumina, Inc., San Diego). The University of Wisconsin Bioinformatics Resource Center (UWBRC) completed quality control, sequence alignment, and SNP calling on GBS data. Adapters, low-quality bases, and primers were trimmed from reads to obtain a Phred score of 20 via the trimming software Skewer (v0.2.2.b). Reads that were too short to be used were also discarded. ( Jiang  ). The Tassel pipeline (version 2) was used to process sequence reads to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes ( et al . 2014 Glaubitz  ). Briefly, demultiplexed reads were aligned to the WMS et al . 2014 TM  draft genome using Bowtie2 ( Langmead and Salzberg 2012 ). The Tassel pipeline was then used to identify potential tags in the aligned SAM files compared to the WMS TM  reference genome, outputting a VCF file. Filtering was performed on VCF files to include only biallelic sites and a minor allele frequency (MAF) ≥ 0.05. SNP coverage and coverage per sample were then calculated. The population-wide inbreeding coefficient F was calculated with VCFtools (v.0.1.16) ( Danecek  ). et al . 2011 Sample relationships were assessed using principal component analysis (PCA), and a bifurcating topology was generated using maximum likelihood. Briefly, for PCA analysis, SNPs were filtered by those with information at ≥60% of samples, and samples with ≤80% of pre-filtered single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were excluded. Beagle v4.1 was used to perform whole genome phasing and to impute missing data ( Browning and Browning 2007 ,  2016 ). A mid-point rooted topology was created from the VCF data using RAxML and visualized with itol v6.9.1 ( https://itol.embl.de/ ) ( Stamatakis 2014 ;  Huerta-Cepas  ;  et al . 2016 Ortiz 2019 ;  Letunic and Bork 2024 ).",Alex C Veith; Jennifer J Meudt; Jamie L Reichert; Jennifer M Frank; Derek M Pavelec; Bridget Ladell; James Speers; Molly Zeller; Taeyoung Shin; Joshua R Hyman; Christopher A Bradfield; Charles M Konsitzke; Dhanansayan Shanmuganayagam; C Dustin Rubinstein; Mark E Berres,"G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",2025-06-04,10.1093/g3journal/jkaf067,minimal,True
PMID:34230208,Enhancing Neurofibromatosis Clinical Trial Outcome Measures Through Patient Engagement: Lessons From REiNS.,"OBJECTIVE: As part of an evaluation of the Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) International Collaboration patient representative program, we surveyed REiNS members to (1) identify facilitators and barriers to involving patient representatives and (2) understand whether and how involving patient representatives affected recommendations for clinical trial outcomes. METHODS: We administered an anonymous online survey to all REiNS members. Facilitators and barriers to patient representative involvement were solicited using a modified free listing technique; responses were inductively grouped into higher-order categories and ranked based on saliency score (Smith  RESULTS: A total of 63/172 (37%) members responded, including 18/30 (60%) patient representatives. Providing sufficient opportunities to meaningfully engage in research tasks and cultivating a respectful, inclusive atmosphere were key facilitators to patient representatives' satisfaction and ability to make an impact. Respondents perceived that patient representatives directly (through their input on research tasks) and indirectly (through effects on other stakeholders' knowledge and communication style) improved the organization's research, leading to selection of more meaningful, relevant, and feasible clinical trial outcome measures. Ongoing challenges to patient engagement include difficulty scheduling meetings and concerns about the level of scientific knowledge patient representatives needed to effectively engage. CONCLUSIONS: Involving patient representatives in REiNS improved perceived quality of neurofibromatosis clinical trial outcome measures. Negotiating sufficient opportunities to engage, fostering an inclusive atmosphere, and navigating time pressures are key to effective patient engagement.",,Vanessa L Merker; Andrés J Lessing; Irene Moss; Maureen Hussey; Beverly Oberlander; Traceann Rose; Raquel Thalheimer; Tracy Wirtanen; Pamela L Wolters; Andrea M Gross; Scott R Plotkin,Neurology,2021-08-17,10.1212/WNL.0000000000012430,abstract_only,False
PMID:40217315,A single-cell atlas of Schwannoma across genetic backgrounds and anatomic locations.,"BACKGROUND: Schwannomas are nerve sheath tumors arising at cranial and peripheral nerves, either sporadically or in patients with a schwannomatosis-predisposition syndrome. There is limited understanding of the transcriptional heterogeneity of schwannomas across genetic backgrounds and anatomic locations. METHODS: Here, we prospectively profile by single-cell full-length transcriptomics tumors from 22 patients with NF2-related schwannomatosis, non-NF2-related schwannomatosis, and sporadic schwannomas, resected from cranial and peripheral nerves. We profiled 11,373 cells (after QC), including neoplastic cells, fibroblasts, T cells, endothelial cells, myeloid cells, and pericytes. RESULTS: We characterize the intra-tumoral genetic and transcriptional heterogeneity of schwannoma, identifying six distinct transcriptional metaprograms, with gene signatures related to stress, myelin production, antigen presentation, interferon signaling, glycolysis, and extracellular matrix. We demonstrate the robustness of our findings with analysis of an independent cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our atlas describes the spectrum of gene expression across schwannoma entities at the single-cell level and will serve as an important resource for the community.","Methods Here, we prospectively profile by single-cell full-length transcriptomics tumors from 22 patients with  NF2 -related schwannomatosis, non- NF2 -related schwannomatosis, and sporadic schwannomas, resected from cranial and peripheral nerves. We profiled 11,373 cells (after QC), including neoplastic cells, fibroblasts, T cells, endothelial cells, myeloid cells, and pericytes. Methods Human subjects Adult patients at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) with radiographic evidence of schwannoma provided preoperative informed consent to take part in the study in all cases on Institutional Review Board Protocol DF/HCC 10–417. Among our cohort were patients followed at the Massachusetts General Hospital Neurofibromatosis Clinic, that had received a diagnosis of  NF2 -related schwannomatosis or non- NF2 -related schwannomatosis based on current clinical diagnostic criteria [ 8 ]. We profiled cells from 22 freshly resected cranial and peripheral schwannomas that developed sporadically or in patients with a known history of NF2 or schwannomatosis. Anatomic and genetic background allocation of the tumors is presented in Fig.  1 A. Patients were males and females. Clinical characteristics are summarized in Additional file  1 : Table S1. For immunohistochemistry experiments, archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were obtained for a subset of samples processed for scRNA-seq (SCHW1, SCHW5, SCHW10, and SCHW23) as well as for four cases (two with melanoma brain metastases, one with breast cancer brain metastases, and one with supratentorial ependymoma, Grade 3) used for comparison. All these patients were consented under Institutional Review Board Protocol DF/HCC 10- 417. Sample processing and single-cell RNA-seq data generation Fresh tumors were collected at the time of surgery and the presence of schwannoma was confirmed by frozen section. Tumors were mechanically and enzymatically dissociated using a papain-based tumor dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec). Tumor cells were blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin in Hanks buffered saline solution (BSA/HBSS). Tumors were stained first with CD45-Vioblue direct antibody conjugate (clone REA747, Miltenyi Biotec) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed with cold PBS, and then re-suspended in 1 mL of BSA/HBSS containing 1 mM calcein AM (Life Technologies) and 0.33 mM TO-PRO-3 iodide (Life Technologies) to co-stain for 30 min before sorting. CD45 negative cells were stained with calcein AM (Life Technologies) for viability and CD24-APC (human antibody, clone REA832, Miltenyi Biotec) and CD44-VioBlue (human antibody, clone REA690, Miltenyi Biotec) to sort subpopulations of viable non-immune cells. Sorting was performed with the FACS Aria Fusion Special Order System (Becton Dickinson) using 488 nm (calcein AM, 530/30 filter), 640 nm (TO-PRO-3 or CD24-APC, 670/14 filter), and 405 nm (CD45-VioBlue or CD44-VioBlue, 450/50 filter) lasers. Standard, strict forward scatter height versus area criteria were used to discriminate doublets and gate-only singleton cells. Viable single cells were identified as calcein AM positive and TO-PRO-3 negative. We sorted individual, viable, immune, and non-immune single cells into 96-well plates containing TCL buffer (QIAGEN) with 1% beta-mercaptoethanol. Plates were frozen on dry ice immediately after sorting and stored at − 80 °C prior to whole transcriptome amplification, library preparation, and sequencing. Smart-seq2 whole transcriptome amplification, library construction, and sequencing were performed as previously published [ 14 ,  16 – 20 ]. Data pre-processing The following preprocessing steps were performed before conducting downstream analysis: (i) Cell filtering: We excluded cells with a low number of detected genes (#genes), using a cutoff of #genes > 1000. (ii) Gene filtering: Given an expression matrix   with n genes (rows) and m cells (columns), the mean expression of gene  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Centering was done across all samples, or per sample, depending on the analysis (see specifications below). Cell annotations and copy number alterations  We performed Louvain clustering on the centered matrix with the top 7000 genes using the “igraph” package with default parameters. Clusters were then annotated based on their top differentially expressed 50 genes and known cell-type markers (Additional file  2 : Table S2). Two clusters were annotated as “low quality” (LQ) based on the abundance of unannotated genes or antisense genes. We did not use CNA inference for distinguishing neoplastic from non-neoplastic Schwann cells, since not all neoplastic Schwann cells harbor loss of chromosome 22 or any other canonical deletion or amplification [ 1 ]. Hence, cells belonging to any of the Schwann clusters were referred to as neoplastic. We inferred CNAs using the package available at [ 21 ] and used fibroblasts, pericytes, and endothelial cells as a reference (Fig.  2 A). Fig. 2 Chromosome 22 deletion in neoplastic and TME cells.  a  CNA plot for all neoplastic (SCHW) cells, using fibroblasts, pericytes, and endothelial cells as reference cells. Neoplastic cells were sorted within each sample by mean CNA on chromosome 22. Reference cells were sorted similarly. Interestingly, 22 deletion was seen in some fibroblasts and pericytes. See Additional file  3 : Fig. S1 for computational validation that the fibroblasts and pericytes harboring chromosome 22 deletion are unlikely to represent doublets.  b  UMAP (same coordinates as in Fig.  1 ) colored by mean CNA on chromosome 22. Inferred deletion is observed also in the fibroblast and pericyte clusters Doublet inference Doublets were identified by combining the results of two methods that were published recently and implemented in R packages—scdDblFinder [ 22 ] and the doubletCells algorithm from scran [ 23 ]. Setting the expected doublet rate at 1%, per 500 cells per sample yielded no doublets in both methods. To investigate whether chromosome 22 deletion identified in certain fibroblasts and pericytes (Fig.  2 B) might correlate with an elevated doublet score, we assigned an expected doublet rate of 5% (which is much higher than the typical rate). Using this criterion, only one fibroblast and two pericytes, each with a chromosome 22 mean copy number alteration (CNA) below − 0.15, were classified as doublets according to both methods (Additional file  3 : Fig. S1). Pseudo-bulk analyses In our pseudo-bulk analyses, we first averaged the TPM values across neoplastic cells in each sample, using the top 7000 genes. We then performed log2 normalization as described above, and centered the averaged gene values across samples. Using hierarchical clustering, we manually defined 3 clusters (Fig.  3 ). For the functional enrichment analysis, we primarily utilized the following gene-set collections from MsigDB: Gene Ontology (C5.GOBP, C5.GOCC, C5.GOMF) and Hallmark (H). These gene signatures were compared to the set of differentially expressed genes within each cluster. Differentially expressed genes were defined as those showing a fold-change greater than 1 and an FDR-adjusted  p -value less than 0.05, as determined by a two-sample  t -test (Additional file  4 : Table S3). We identified overlapping signatures with an FDR-adjusted  p -value less than 0.05, using a hypergeometric test, and kept them as putative annotations for each gene list (Additional file  4 : Table S3). Fig. 3 Inter-tumor transcriptional variability is mainly driven by factors other than etiology or location.  a  Top 7000 genes were averaged across cancer cells in each sample and then clustered. Black broken rectangles demarcate 3 clusters. Cluster 2 is mostly composed of NF2 mutant tumors.  b  Volcano plots comparing differentially expressed genes between clusters. See Table S2 for the full list of differentially expressed genes.  P -values were calculated using a two-sided t-test and corrected for multiple comparisons using FDR. Volcano plots that were similarly obtained by comparing samples in different locations or with different etiologies did now show any significantly differentiated genes after correction for multiple comparisons Defining patterns of intra-tumor heterogeneity Patterns of intra-tumor heterogeneity were defined as previously described [ 24 ]. In brief, we performed non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) for the neoplastic cells in each sample separately using different “ K ” values ( K  = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), thereby generating 54 programs for each sample. We then selected the top 50 genes in each NMF program, based on NMF coefficients. Next, we retained for each sample the NMF programs that were: (i) Robust within the sample—programs with an overlap of at least 35 out of 50 genes with another program from that sample. (ii) Robust across other samples—programs with an overlap of at least 10 out of 50 genes with a program from another sample. (iii) Non-redundant within the sample—programs within each sample were ranked according to similarity with programs from other samples and selected in decreasing order. After a program was selected, other programs within the sample with a gene overlap of 10 or more were removed. Finally, we used a custom approach for clustering the selected NMF programs from all samples, summarizing each cluster by 50 consensus genes that represent a heterogeneity pattern shared across samples [ 24 ]. After removing 3 signatures that were suspected to reflect low-quality data or other technical confounders, with a strong enrichment of either ribosomal protein genes or unannotated genes, we retained 6 signatures (Fig.  4 ) and assessed their enrichment in functionally annotated gene-sets from MsigDB as described above (Additional file  5 : Table S4). Fig. 4 Schwannoma patterns of intra-tumor heterogeneity and decoupling of Interferon and MHC-II signaling.  a  Gene expression metaprograms (MPs) were derived using NMF with ranks 2–10 and subsequent extraction of robust programs and clustering, as previously described. Six heterogeneity MPs were recovered (highlighted).  b  UMAP (same coordinates as in Fig.  1 ) colored by expression of the myelin marker PRX provides further evidence that myelination varies across SCHW cells.  c  Decoupling of MHC-I from Interferon signaling in SCHW. Cells were scored to selected MHC-II genes (shown to the upper left) in samples that participated in the major published MHC-II MP in the pan-cancer study and in the SCHW samples. Gene expression was then compared per sample between cells that scored > 1 and cells that scored < 0. MHC-I and MHC-II showed weaker coupling in SCHW samples compared to other cancer types. Interestingly, decoupling of MHC-I (and also complement) and interferon was especially apparent in vestibular samples Coupling and decoupling of interferon and MHC signaling We focused on samples that contributed at least one NMF program to the previously published MP17 interferon/MHC-II (I) [ 24 ], which encompassed multiple cancer types. Malignant cells in these samples, and neoplastic cells in the Schwannoma samples, were scored to a curated list of interferon genes (Fig.  4 , using the “sigScores” function from [ 25 ]). Normalized and centered expression levels of MHC class I, class II, interferon, and complement genes were compared, per sample, between all cells with upregulation of MHC-related genes (score > 1) and all cells without such upregulation (score < 0). The average differential expression values (log2 fold change), per sample, were then centered across samples. Additional file  6 : Fig. S2 presents these values after hierarchical clustering of both rows (genes) and columns (samples). Genes were grouped into three clusters (gene modules), while samples were clustered into four clusters, as indicated by the horizontal and vertical dashed black lines. The first cluster of samples (leftmost) was significantly enriched with SCHW samples ( p  = 8.32 × 10 −12 , hypergeometric test) and exhibited high expression of gene modules 1 and 2 (corresponding to only MHC-II genes and MHC-II plus complement genes, respectively), along with low expression of gene module 3 (which contains interferon-response and MHC-I genes). To further evaluate decoupling of MHC-II and MHC-I genes in schwannoma, we stained schwannoma samples (SCHW1, SCHW5, SCHW10, SCHW23) and control tumor samples (supratentorial ependymoma, breast cancer and melanoma brain metastases) for MHC class I and MHC class II proteins with relevant transcripts detected in our scRNA-seq analyses (HLA-B (anti-HLA Class I ABC antibody, ab225636, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for MHC I, and DPB1 (anti-MHC Class II antibody, ab55152, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for MHC II) (Additional file  7 : Fig. S3A). Quantification of staining intensity was performed in QuPath [ 26 ]. Nuclei were detected in tumor-rich regions of interest using the “Positive Cell Detection” function. Cell segmentation was then performed by expansion in a 2-micron radius. The mean DAB optical density was calculated within each cell in the given region of interest. Subsequently, these values were averaged across all cells for a given tumor. For each tumor, quantification was performed on at least two stained slide levels. Staining intensity for MHC class I and class II were compared for schwannoma and control samples via 2-way ANOVA with Tukey’s correction for multiple comparisons test (Additional file  7 : Fig. S3B). Analyses of the tumor microenvironment of schwannoma We selected samples that have at least 20 T-cells or 20 macrophages profiled (respectively, for each analysis) and generated pseudo-bulk profiles. We next score the T-cell pseudo-bulk profiles against the CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell metaprograms published in our pan-cancer study [ 24 ], and score the macrophage pseudo-bulk profiles against the macrophage metaprograms published in our pan-cancer study [ 24 ] and against the myeloid signatures published by Barrett et al. [ 27 ]. Using a two-sided  t -test, we next tested whether any of the following subgroups significantly differed from the other samples in score values: (i) NF2 vs all other samples, (ii) schwannomatosis vs all other samples, (iii) vestibular vs all other samples. To assess correlations between pseudo-bulk scores of the T-cell and macrophage signatures mentioned above, and our neoplastic signatures that we generated, we also rely only on samples that have at least 20 cells of each type for each respective analysis. Ligand-receptor interaction analyses Here we tested potential interactions between neoplastic cells and T-cells, macrophages, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and pericytes. Similar to before, we focus on samples that have at least 20 neoplastic cells and 20 cells of the respective other cell type for each analysis. We tested the existence of known ligands or receptors in the top 4,000 ranked genes in each sample, using the resource published by Ramilowski et al. [ 28 ] Additional file  8 : Table S5 contains the ligand-receptor couples for each cell type. The last sheet in the table contains the robust interactions: interactions that came up in at least 50% of the samples tested. Next, for each cell type, using the hypergeometric test with false-discovery rate correction, we tested whether there is a difference in abundance per interaction between the following sample subgroups: (i) vestibular vs non-vestibular, (ii) NF2 vs non-NF2, (iii) schwannomatosis vs non-schwannomatosis. The results are reported in Additional file  9 : Table S6.",L Nicolas Gonzalez Castro; Avishai Gavish; Lillian Bussema; Christopher W Mount; Cyril Neftel; Masashi Nomura; E Antonio Chiocca; Wenya Linda Bi; Omar Arnaout; Fred G Barker; Justin M Brown; Justin T Jordan; Tracy T Batchelor; Anat Stemmer-Rachamimov; Scott R Plotkin; Itay Tirosh; Mario L Suvà,Genome medicine,2025-04-11,10.1186/s13073-025-01462-4,minimal,True
PMID:33507258,Assessment of RAS Dependency for BRAF Alterations Using Cancer Genomic Databases.,"IMPORTANCE: Understanding RAS dependency and mechanisms of RAS activation in non-V600 BRAF variant cancers has important clinical implications. This is the first study to date to systematically assess RAS dependency of BRAF alterations with real-world cancer genomic databases. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate RAS dependency of individual BRAF alterations through alteration coexistence analysis using cancer genomic databases. DESIGN AND SETTING: A cross-sectional data analysis of 119 538 nonredundant cancer samples using cancer genomics databases including GENIE (Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange) and databases in cBioPortal including TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) (accessed March 24, 2020), in addition to 2745 cancer samples from Mayo Clinic Genomics Laboratory (January 1, 2015, to July 1, 2020). Frequencies and odds ratios of coexisting alterations of RAS (KRAS, NRAS and HRAS) and RAS regulatory genes (NF1, PTPN11 and CBL) were calculated for individual BRAF alterations, and compared according to the current BRAF alteration classification; cancer type specificity of coexisting alterations of RAS or RAS regulatory genes was also evaluated. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome measurement is enrichment of RAS (KRAS, NRAS and HRAS) alterations in BRAF variant cancers. Secondary outcome measurement is enrichment of RAS regulatory gene (NF1, PTPN11, and CBL) in BRAF variant cancers. RESULTS: A total of 2745 cancer samples from 2708 patients (female/male ratio: 1.0) tested by Mayo Clinic Genomics Laboratory and 119 538 patients (female/male ratio: 1.1) from GENIE and cBioPortal database were included in the study. In 119 538 nonredundant cancer samples, class 1 BRAF alterations and BRAF fusions were found to be mutually exclusive to alterations of RAS or RAS regulatory genes (odds ratio range 0.03-0.13 and 0.03-0.73 respectively), confirming their RAS independency. Both class 2 and class 3 BRAF alterations show variable and overlapping levels of enriched RAS alterations (odds ratio range: 0.03-5.9 and 0.63-2.52 respectively), suggesting heterogeneity in RAS dependency and a need to revisit BRAF alteration classification. For RAS-dependent BRAF alterations, the coexisting alterations also involve RAS regulatory genes by enrichment analysis (for example, S467L shows an odds ratio of 8.26 for NF1, 9.87 for PTPN11, and 15.23 for CBL) and occur in a variety of cancer types with some coalterations showing cancer type specificity (for example, HRAS variations account for 46.7% of all coexisting RAS alterations in BRAF variant bladder cancers, but 0% in non-small cell lung cancers). Variant-level assessment shows that BRAF alterations involving the same codon may differ in RAS dependency. In addition, RAS dependency of previously unclassified BRAF alterations could be assessed. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Current BRAF alteration classification based on in vitro assays does not accurately predict RAS dependency in vivo for non-V600 BRAF alterations. RAS-dependent BRAF variant cancers with different mechanisms of RAS activation suggest the need for different treatment strategies.","Methods Targeted next generation sequencing data from 2745 cancer samples (lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and melanoma) that have undergone clinical testing at Mayo Clinic Genomics Laboratory from January 1, 2015, to July 1, 2020, were collected with ACE (Advanced Cohort Explorer). This study was approved by the institutional review board at Mayo Clinic Rochester. A waiver was granted by the institutional review board at Mayo Clinic Rochester because the study is a retrospective data analysis with deidentified data. In addition, targeted next generation sequencing data from 79 720 samples from 75 191 patients in GENIE database (v.7.0, public release: January 2020, access date: March 24, 2020), and 176 nonduplicate studies available in cBioPortal (access date: March 24, 2020)  including 46 697 samples from 44 347 patients were also collected. Both GENIE and cBioPortal databases are publicly available to the entire scientific community. We removed duplicated patients and only kept their earliest record, resulting in a total number of 119 538 non-Mayo samples. We removed duplicate records and kept only the earliest record, resulting in a total number of 119 538 non-Mayo samples. 9 , 10 Statistical Analysis To analyze the coexistence pattern of genes of interest ( KRAS ,  NRAS ,  HRAS ,  NF1 ,  PTPN11 ,  CBL ), distributions of samples based on  BRAF  alteration status ( BRAF altered  and  BRAF unaltered ) and alteration status of genes of interest were summarized in 2 × 2 contingency tables. The SNVs and indels, fusions (for  BRAF ), and copy number alterations ( RAS  amplification and  NF1  loss) were included in the analysis. Variants with less than 2 Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer counts were excluded as passenger alterations. Odds ratios (ORs) and frequencies of coalterations were calculated for individual  BRAF  alterations.  BRAF  alteration classification was based on previous studies.  The χ 1 , 2 2  test was used with the 2 × 2 contingency tables to test whether alterations coexist or are mutually exclusive to each other. The 95% CIs of ORs were calculated as exp(ln(OR)±1.96*SE(ln(OR))). Standard error SE(ln(OR)) was calculated as [(1/ A ) + (1/ B ) + (1/ C ) + (1/ D )] 1/2 , where A, B, C, D are 4 numbers in the 2 × 2 contingency table. For contingency table with a value of 0, we applied Haldane-Anscombe correction by adding 0.05 to each cell and then calculated OR and its CI.  P  value was calculated through χ 2  test for each contingency table. A  P  < .05 was considered statistically significant.

PMID:27999334,Hybridization Capture-Based Next-Generation Sequencing to Evaluate Coding Sequence and Deep Intronic Mutations in the NF1 Gene.,Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is one of the most common genetic disorders and is caused by mutations in the ,"2. Materials and Methods This study was approved by the ethical committee of Antônio Pedro University Hospital of Universidade Federal Fluminense, Niterói, Brazil (#121/11). 2.1. Patients Some clinical features of the participants of this study are shown in  Table 1 . NGS samples were obtained from 12 individuals with NF1: 11 unrelated NF1 patients and one relative with NF1 (NF.85; son of the patient NF.84). For the Sanger methodology (see  Section 2.6 ), we have also included another three relatives with NF1, as follows: NF.14 (cousin of patient NF.84), NF.87 (son of patient NF.91), and NF.27 (sister of patient NF.26). All the individuals had NF1 according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical criteria [ 11 ]. Extraction of DNA from leukocytes and purification were performed with QIAamp DNA Blood Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Purity of DNA was assessed by spectrophotometry using NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). DNA yields were determined using a double stranded DNA (dsDNA) broad range (BR) kit on a Qubit ®  fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Integrity of DNA was evaluated by agarose-gel electrophoresis. 2.2. Capture Probe Set Design Capture probe set was designed and synthesized by Thermo Fisher Scientific for the Ion TargetSeq Custom Enrichment kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to target all the coding exons, UTRs, as well as the intronic regions of the  NF1  gene. The designed nonoverlapping probe set covered 90.5% of the targeted region (chr17: 29421944-29704695). 2.3. Targeted Capture Library Construction and Next-Generation Sequencing Libraries were constructed from 2–3 µg of DNA. DNA was sheared into 200 bp fragments on a Bioruptor ®  sonicator (Diagenode, Denville, NJ, USA), using two cycles of 15 min. Then, DNA fragments were end-repaired, nick repaired, and the barcodes and adaptors were ligated to fragmented DNA. After, we size-selected and amplified the library using the IonXpress Plus gDNA Fragment Library kit, Ion Xpress Barcode Adapters and E-Gel Size Select 2% agarose gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The amplified library was then hybridized to the  NF1  capture probe set for two days (two hybridizations). Libraries were quantified in Qubit ®  fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with dsDNA high sensitivity (HS) kit. The quantity and quality of the library were also verified with Agilent Bioanalyzer DNA High Sensitivity kit (Agilent, Richardson, TX, USA). Libraries were then pooled in equimolar concentrations and diluted to 26 pM, prior to clonal amplification onto Ion Sphere Particles using the Ion One Touch 2 System and the Ion OneTouch 200 Template kit v2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Coated spheres were enriched on the Ion Torrent ES (Thermo Fisher Scientific) before loading onto Ion 316 or 318 sequencing chips (Thermo Fisher Scientific). NGS was performed on Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine—Ion Torrent PGM™ (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 2.4. Bioinformatic Analysis of Next-Generation Sequencing Data Primary analyses of NGS data were performed using Torrent Suite software on the Ion Torrent Browser (Thermo Fisher Scientific): base calling, quality score assignment, adapter trimming, and demultiplexing. Reads were generated using Ion Torrent platform pipeline software, which includes standard control of the read quality. Using the same software, reads were aligned against human whole genome (hg19). Only high-quality reads (Q ≥ 20) were aligned to the reference sequence using TMAP (Torrent Mapping Alignment Program). Germline variants in the targeted regions were detected using the variant caller plug-in of the Ion Torrent Suite software. Variant caller was run with default germline low stringency settings. For each sample, all variants were exported through a vcf (Variant Call Format) file. Variants were filtered following the criteria of a minimum coverage of 30×, and a sample variant frequency between 30%–70%. For variant interpretation, Ingenuity ®  Variant Analysis™ software (Qiagen) and SNPnexus web server were used. Variants were also viewed manually on Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV—version 2.3.40; Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA) and on Alamut ®  Visual (version 2.6.1e; Interactive Biosoftware, Rouen, France) to eliminate strand bias and reduce false positive calls. 2.5. In Silico Predictions To predict the potential effect of the mutation on the structure and function of the protein codified by the  NF1  gene (neurofibromin), PolyPhen2 and SIFT were applied through Ingenuity ®  Variant Analysis™ software and SNPnexus web server. In silico splicing predictions were investigated with Alamut ®  Visual, which uses the following prediction methods: SpliceSiteFinder-like; MaxEntScan; NNSPLICE; GeneSplicer; Human Splicing Finder; Known Constitutive Signals; ESEFinder; RESCUE-ESE. Because Alamut ®  Visual integrates only Human Splicing Finder’s prediction capabilities on donor and acceptor splice sites, and does not investigate the mechanisms of the splicing abnormalities caused by mutations at the nonconsensus splice sites, we also used the online Human Splicing Finder ( http://www.umd.be/HSF/ ). 2.6. Confirmatory Sanger Sequencing All variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing in an AB3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Primers were designed using NCBI’s Primer BLAST tool ( Table 2 ) and the sequences were analyzed with the Sequencing Analysis software (version 5.4; Applied Biosystems).",Karin Soares Cunha; Nathalia Silva Oliveira; Anna Karoline Fausto; Carolina Cruz de Souza; Audrey Gros; Thomas Bandres; Yamina Idrissi; Jean-Philippe Merlio; Rodrigo Soares de Moura Neto; Rosane Silva; Mauro Geller; David Cappellen,Genes,2016-12-17,10.3390/genes7120133,minimal,True
PMID:29941005,Increased extracellular matrix deposition during chondrogenic differentiation of dental pulp stem cells from individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1: an in vitro 2D and 3D study.,"BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) presents a wide range of clinical manifestations, including bone alterations. Studies that seek to understand cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying NF1 orthopedic problems are of great importance to better understand the pathogenesis and the development of new therapies. Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) are being used as an in vitro model for several diseases and appear as a suitable model for NF1. The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro chondrogenic differentiation of DPSCs from individuals with NF1 using two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) cultures. RESULTS: To fulfill the criteria of the International Society for Cellular Therapy, DPSCs were characterized by surface antigen expression and by their multipotentiality, being induced to differentiate towards adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic lineages in 2D cultures. Both DPSCs from individuals with NF1 (NF1 DPSCs) and control cultures were positive for CD90, CD105, CD146 and negative for CD13, CD14, CD45 and CD271, and successfully differentiated after the protocols. Chondrogenic differentiation was evaluated in 2D and in 3D (pellet) cultures, which were further evaluated by optical microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). 2D cultures showed greater extracellular matrix deposition in NF1 DPSCs comparing with controls during chondrogenic differentiation. In semithin sections, control pellets hadhomogenous-sized intra and extracelullar matrix vesicles, whereas NF1 cultures had matrix vesicles of different sizes. TEM analysis showed higher amount of collagen fibers in NF1 cultures compared with control cultures. CONCLUSION: NF1 DPSCs presented increased extracellular matrix deposition during chondrogenic differentiation, which could be related to skeletal changes in individuals with NF1.","Methods Subject selection This study was conducted at Antônio Pedro University Hospital of Universidade Federal Fluminense, Niterói, Brazil, between 2013 and 2016, and was approved by the institution’s Ethics Committee (No.519.858/2014). All participants signed a consent form. DPSCs were obtained from human third molars, which were extracted following clinical recommendation. Two primary cell cultures were obtained from individuals with NF1 (NF1 group; NF37 and NF87) and three from individuals without NF1 (control group; CT10, CT11 and CT12). Participants were both men and women with ages ranging from 19 to 38 years. Isolation and cell culture Immediately after extraction, each tooth was washed with sterile saline solution. Using a cylindrical Zekrya drill (Microdont, SP, BR), a groove was made at the amelocemental junction to facilitate the cleavage of the tooth with an orthodontic wire cutter. The pulp tissue was removed and transported to the culture laboratory in a conical tube containing 5 mL of DMEM-F12 medium (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium Nutrient Mixture F-12; Invitrogen, CA, USA), supplemented with 15% ( v /v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone™, Utah, USA), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen). Pulp cell cultures were established by explant culture technique. The pulp tissue was placed in a 35 × 10 mm cell culture dish (Corning, NY, USA) containing 2 mL of DPSCs culture medium composed of DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 12% ( v /v) FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen) and 0,01 mM non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen). Medium was changed every two days. At each passage, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and released from culture surface using trypsin-EDTA 0,25% (Gibco, NY, USA) for 5 min at 37 °C. DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 12% (v/v) FBS was added to the cell suspension, and the cell number was determined using Countess II FL Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher Scientific, MA, USA). The cell suspension was then centrifuged and the pellet suspended in DPSCs culture medium. Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 10 4  cells/cm 2 . Dental pulp stem cells characterization In 2006, the International Society for Cellular Therapy proposed the minimum criteria to define mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), as follows: plastic adherence, specific surface antigen expression, and multipotent differentiation potential, including adipogenesis, osteogenesis and chondrogenesis [ 20 ]. These criteria were fulfilled in this study as follows. Surface antigens expression At passage 3–4, 3 × 10 5  cells were washed with PBS containing 0,1% sodium azide and 3% FBS and then incubated for 30 min in ice and in the dark with the following mouse anti-human monoclonal antibodies directly conjugated with fluorochromes: CD13/FITC (22A5, Caltag Medsystems, UK), CD14/PE (M5E2, BD Biosciences, CA, USA), CD34/FITC (581, BD Biosciences), CD45/ALexa405 (HI30, Caltag Medsystems), CD90/PECy5 (5E10, BioLegend, CA, USA), CD105/APC (45A5A3, BioLegend), CD146/PE (P1H12, BD Biosciences), CD271/APC (C401457, BD Biosciences). Unstained cells were used as controls. Data was acquired using FACSCanto II (BD Bioscienses) flow cytometer and at least 20.000 events were analyzed with FACSDiva (BD Biosciences) or FlowJo 7.6.5 ( FlowJo.com ; Tree Star, OR, USA) software. Adipogenic differentiation For adipogenic differentiation, a triplicate of 5 × 10 3  cells (passage 3) were plated in a 6-well culture dish and cultivated in DPSCs culture medium for two days. Medium was replaced by DMEM-High Glucose medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% ( v /v) FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 0,5 mM isobutyl methyl xanthine (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA), 10 − 6  M dexamethasone, 10 μM insulin (Biobras, MG, BR) and 200 μM indomethacin (Sigma-Aldrich). Culture was kept for 21 days and medium was changed every three days. To demonstrate the potential of adipogenic differentiation, cultures were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 30 min and stained with Oil Red O. Plates were washed twice with distilled water, and 1 mL of propylene glycol PA was added for two minutes. After removing propylene glycol, plates were incubated with Oil Red O for 20 min at room temperature. Oil Red O was removed and 1 mL propylene glycol 85% was added for a minute. Plates were washed twice in distilled water and kept open until dry. Osteogenic differentiation To induce osteogenic differentiation, a triplicate of 5 × 10 3  cells (passage 3) were plated in a 6-well culture dish and cultivated in DPSCs culture medium for two days. Medium was then replaced by DMEM-High Glucose medium supplemented with 10% ( v /v) FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 50 μM ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA), 10 − 8  M dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) and 10 mM β-glycerophosphate (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA). Culture was kept for 21 days and medium was changed every three days. To demonstrate the potential of osteogenic differentiation, cultures were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 30 min and stained with von Kossa method. Plates were washed twice with distilled water and incubated with 2% AgNO3 solution for one hour at room temperature in the dark. Dye excess was removed, and plates were rinsed with distilled water and exposed to ultraviolet light for 40 min. Chondrogenic differentiation The induction of chondrogenic differentiation was performed following two protocols: 2D cell culture and 3D cell culture (pellet). For the 2D cell culture, 10 4  cells (at passage 3; in quadruplicate) were plated with10 μL DMEM-High glucose medium in the center of a 24-well culture dish (Corning, NY, USA) and left in incubator for two hours at 37 °C. Following, 500 μL of DMEM-High glucose medium supplemented with 10% ( v /v) FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin was added and the plate was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. This medium was then supplemented with 6.25 μg/mL insulin and transferrin (Invitrogen, NY, USA), 10 − 8  M dexamethasone,50 μM ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (added to medium only after the sixth day) and 10 μg/mL transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ-1; Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA). Culture was kept for 21 days and medium was changed every three days. To demonstrate the potential of chondrogenic differentiation, cultures were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 30 min, washed twice with distilled water and incubated with Alcian blue (pH 2.5) for 30 min at room temperature. Dye excess was removed and plates were rinsed with distilled water and kept open until dry. For the 3Dcell culture, 5 × 10 5  cells (at passage 3; in duplicate) were centrifuged in 15 mL polypropylene conical tubes at 1500 rpm (201,24 g) for five minutes. The resulting pellets were maintained in DMEM-High glucose medium supplemented with 10% ( v /v) FBS and 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. After 24 h, 6.25 μg/mL insulin and transferrin, 10 − 8  M dexamethasone, 50 μM ascorbic acid 2-phosphate and 10 μg/mL TGFβ-1 were added to the culture medium. Cultures were kept for 21 days and medium was changed every three days. At the end of chondrogenic differentiation, all pellets were washed with PBS and fixed either with paraformaldehyde 4% (v/v) overnight for light microscopic analysis or with 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution with 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Quantitative analysis of chondrogenic differentiation in bidimensional cultures After chondrogenic differentiation, one picture (20× magnification) was obtained per quadruplicate at the center of the culture dish. Images were analyzed using ImageJ software v.1.49 (NIH, USA), and the percentage of stained area in each picture was obtained. Pellet analysis after chondrogenic differentiation For the analysis of chondrogenic differentiation in 3D pellet culture, paraffin sections with 3 μm thickness were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) to evaluate pellet morphology, as well as with Alcian blue (pH 2.5) to evaluate glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) deposition. Expression of Ki-67 was evaluated immunohistochemically using mouse monoclonal antibody anti-Ki-67 (1:80; M7240; Dako Corporation, CA, USA). Glass slides were scanned with Aperio System (Leica Biosystems, CA, USA) at 40× and the results were descriptive. For TEM, pellets were fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h, dehydrated in ascending concentration of acetone and embedded in epoxy resin. Semithin sections with 0.5 μm were stained with 1% toluidine blue and scanned with Aperio System at 40× for descriptive analysis. Ultrathin sections (70 nm) were collected on copper grids and counterstained with 2% uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Images were obtained using JEM-1011 (JEOL, MA, USA). In the ultrastructure analysis, production of extracellular matrix was evaluated through the presence of collagen fibers and intra and extracellular vesicles. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences software (SPSS v. 20.0; Chicago, IL, USA) at 5% significance level. Proliferation and senescence assays were analyzed using repeated measure ANOVA with Bonferroni Correction, for comparison within groups. Student’s  t  test for independent groups was used for analyzing PDT and clonogenic assay results. For chondrogenic bidimensional differentiation analysis, Man-Whitney test was used.

PMID:7686619,Multiple dispersed loci produce small cytoplasmic Alu RNA.,"Alu repeats are short interspersed elements (SINEs) of dimeric structure whose transposition sometimes leads to heritable disorders in humans. Human cells contain a poly(A)- small cytoplasmic transcript of -120 nucleotides (nt) homologous to the left Alu monomer. Although its monomeric size indicates that small cytoplasmic Alu (scAlu) RNA is not an intermediary of human Alu transpositions, a less abundant poly(A)-containing Alu transcript of dimeric size and specificity expected of a transposition intermediary is also detectable in HeLa cells (A. G. Matera, U. Hellmann, M. F. Hintz, and C. W. Schmid, Mol. Cell. Biol. 10:5424-5432, 1990). Although its function is unknown, the accumulation of Alu RNA and its ability to interact with a conserved protein suggest a role in cell biology (D.-Y. Chang and R. J. Maraia, J. Biol. Chem. 268:6423-28, 1993). The relationship between the -120- and -300-nt Alu transcripts had not been determined. However, a B1 SINE produces scB1 RNA by posttranscriptional processing, suggesting a similar pathway for scAlu. An Alu SINE which recently transposed into the neurofibromatosis 1 locus was expressed in microinjected frog oocytes. This neurofibromatosis 1 Alu produced a primary transcript followed by the appearance of the scAlu species. 3' processing of a synthetic -300-nt Alu RNA by HeLa nuclear extract in vitro also produced scAlu RNA. Primer extension of scAlu RNA indicates synthesis by RNA polymerase III. HeLa-derived scAlu cDNAs were cloned so as to preserve their 5'-terminal sequences and were found to correspond to polymerase III transcripts of the left monomeric components of three previously identified Alu SINE subfamilies. Rodent x human somatic cell hybrids express Alu RNAs whose size, heterogeneous length, and chromosomal distribution indicate their derivation from SINEs. The coexpression of dimeric and monomeric Alu RNA in several hybrids suggests a precursor-product relationship.",,R J Maraia; C T Driscoll; T Bilyeu; K Hsu; G J Darlington,Molecular and cellular biology,1993-07,10.1128/mcb.13.7.4233-4241.1993,abstract_only,False
PMID:34230198,Current Recommendations for Patient-Reported Outcome Measures Assessing Domains of Quality of Life in Neurofibromatosis Clinical Trials.,"OBJECTIVE: To review and recommend patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures assessing multidimensional domains of quality of life (QoL) to use as clinical endpoints in medical and psychosocial trials for children and adults with neurofibromatosis (NF) type 1, NF2, and schwannomatosis. METHODS: The PRO working group of the Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) International Collaboration used systematic methods to review, rate, and recommend existing self-report and parent-report PRO measures of generic and disease-specific QoL for NF clinical trials. Recommendations were based on 4 main criteria: patient characteristics, item content, psychometric properties, and feasibility. RESULTS: The highest-rated generic measures were (1) the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Generic Core Scales for NF clinical trials for children or for children through adults, (2) the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General for adult medical trials, and (3) the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF for adult psychosocial trials. The highest-rated disease-specific measures were (1) the PedsQL NF1 Module for NF1 trials, (2) the NF2 Impact on Quality of Life Scale for NF2 trials, and (3) the Penn Acoustic Neuroma Quality of Life Scale for NF2 trials targeting vestibular schwannomas. To date, there are no disease-specific tools assessing multidimensional domains of QoL for schwannomatosis. CONCLUSIONS: The REiNS Collaboration currently recommends these generic and disease-specific PRO measures to assess multidimensional domains of QoL for NF clinical trials. Additional research is needed to further evaluate the use of these measures in both medical and psychosocial trials.",,Pamela L Wolters; Ana-Maria Vranceanu; Heather L Thompson; Staci Martin; Vanessa L Merker; Andrea Baldwin; Carolina Barnett; Kimberley S Koetsier; Cynthia M Hingtgen; Christopher J Funes; James H Tonsgard; Elizabeth K Schorry; Taryn Allen; Taylor Smith; Barbara Franklin; Stephanie Reeve,Neurology,2021-08-17,10.1212/WNL.0000000000012421,abstract_only,False
PMID:3102622,A computed image analyzing system for quantitation of melanocyte morphology in café-au-lait macules of neurofibromatosis.,"Split-dopa preparation is a commonly used technique to visualize the epidermal melanocytes. It can characterize the number of melanocytes and their tyrosinase (dopa-oxidase) activities. There is not, however, any method to quantitate the morphologic changes of dopa-positive melanocytes in the split preparation. This study designed a computed image analyzing system and evaluated the structure of epidermal melanocytes in café-au-lait macules with comparison to normally pigmented skin in 5 patients with neurofibromatosis. By this method we were able to delineate the melanocyte structure with melanocyte population and coloration of the macules. We found that the population and structure of melanocytes differ greatly depending on the coloration of the café-au-lait macules. The light brown and brown macules showed the normal population of melanocytes with an increase in the area and perimeter of whole cell; the area, perimeter, and diameter of cytoplasm; and the area, length, and breadth of dendrites. In contrast, the dark brown macules revealed a significant increase of the epidermal melanocytes with a decrease in all of these parameters. Thus, the methodologic design presented here may enable a quantitative, two-dimensional analysis of melanocyte structure at the light microscopic level in the normal skin and in various pigmentary disorders.",,O Ishida; K Jimbow,The Journal of investigative dermatology,1987-03,10.1111/1523-1747.ep12466155,abstract_only,False
PMID:37990867,Neurofibromin 1 mutations impair the function of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant condition caused by germline mutations in the neurofibromin 1 (NF1) gene. Children with NF1 are prone to the development of multiple nervous system abnormalities, including autism and brain tumors, which could reflect the effect of NF1 mutation on microglia function. Using heterozygous Nf1-mutant mice, we previously demonstrated that impaired purinergic signaling underlies deficits in microglia process extension and phagocytosis in situ. To determine whether these abnormalities are also observed in human microglia in the setting of NF1, we leveraged an engineered isogenic series of human induced pluripotent stem cells to generate human microglia-like (hiMGL) cells heterozygous for three different NF1 gene mutations found in patients with NF1. Whereas all NF1-mutant and isogenic control hiMGL cells expressed classical microglia markers and exhibited similar transcriptomes and cytokine/chemokine release profiles, only NF1-mutant hiMGL cells had defects in P2X receptor activation, phagocytosis and motility. Taken together, these findings indicate that heterozygous NF1 mutations impair a subset of the functional properties of human microglia, which could contribute to the neurological abnormalities seen in children with NF1.","MATERIALS AND METHODS hiPSC quality control The original CTL BJFF.6 hiPSCs were generated from commercially available human foreskin fibroblasts (Stemgent, Reprocell, MD, USA). All NF1-mutant hiPSC lines were derived from the CTL BJFF.6 hiPSC line as previously described ( Anastasaki et al., 2020 ). All hiPSC lines used in this project underwent extensive quality control before being used for microglial differentiation. Sterility for microorganisms was assessed first by antibiotic-free culture for a week. Cells were checked daily under the microscope and showed no signs of microbiological contamination. Next, cells were tested for mycoplasma using the Promokine Mycoplasma Test Kit I/C (Minerva Biolabs, Berlin, Germany). All cell lines used tested negative for contamination with mycoplasma, bacteria, yeast or fungi. Viability appeared normal, and growth to confluence was typical of that of hiPSCs. Pluripotency of hiPSCs was confirmed through immunocytochemistry for pluripotency markers (OCT3/4, NANOG, TRA-1-60 and SSEA-4) ( Fig. S1 ). hiPSCs were karyotyped using the iScan machine (Illumina, CA, USA) and the Illumina platform OMNI-Express-8v1.6 Chip (coverage of 958,497 markers spanning the whole human genome). The analysis was performed using the Karyostudio 1.3 software (Illumina) based on the information of the GRCh36/hg18 dataset. All cell lines had an inconspicuous karyotype showing no larger areas of deletions or insertions ( Fig. S1 ). All alterations that were detected were well below the 5 megabase pair (Mbp) threshold detectable by regular G-banding. A 1.7 Mbp gain (chromosome 20) in the CTL hiPSC line was the largest gain found. A similar gain was found in all  NF1 -mutant lines ( Fig. S1 ). Cell line identity (short tandem repeat analysis) was performed using the GenePrint 10 System (Promega). The analysis confirmed that all hiPSC lines were derived from the same donor. hiPSC culture hiPSCs were grown on Geltrex-coated vessels (0.12-0.18 mg/ml, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA), incubated in StemMACS iPS-Brew XF medium (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), passaged weekly using StemPro Accutase (Life Technologies), and supplemented with 0.5 μM thiazovivin (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) for the first 24 h after passaging. hiPSCs were frozen in Bambanker (GC Lymphotec, Tokyo, Japan) for long-term liquid nitrogen storage. hiPSCs used for microglial differentiation were kept in culture for a maximum of 3 weeks. See  Table S5  for details of materials used. Microglial differentiation hiMGL cells were generated from hiPSCs as previously described ( McQuade et al., 2018 ) with minor modifications. On day −1, about 60-100 hiPSC clusters were seeded onto a Geltrex-coated six-well plate (Falcon, Corning, Glendale, AZ, USA) ( Fig. 1A ) with fresh StemMACS medium. On day 0 (induction), wells containing approximately 50 clusters at a diameter of 100-200 μm each were used for hematopoietic differentiation. HPCs were generated using the STEMdiff hematopoietic kit (STEMCELL Technologies). On day 0, the medium was changed to Medium A (included in the STEMdiff kit) for the initial 3 days of the protocol. On day 3, Medium A was exchanged for Medium B (included in the STEMdiff kit) and cells were cultured for an additional 9 days. The first HPCs arose on day 7. On day 12, HPCs, which have been reported to be CD43 +  ( McQuade et al., 2018 ), were harvested and replated (1.2×10 5  cells per six-well plate) into DMEM/F12 (no Phenol Red) (Life Technologies)-based serum-free microglia differentiation medium with B27 (2×) (Life Technologies), insulin-transferrin-selenite (2×) (Life Technologies), N-2 (0.5×) (Life Technologies), GlutaMAX (1×) (Life Technologies), MEM non-essential amino acids solution (1×) (Life Technologies), insulin (5 μg/ml; PromoCell, Heidelberg, Germany) and α-thioglycerol (400 μM; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The microglia differentiation medium was supplemented with IL-34 (100 ng/ml; Peprotech, Cranbury, NJ, USA), TGF-β1 (50 ng/ml; Peprotech,) and M-CSF (25 ng/ml; Peprotech). Medium with fresh supplements (IL-34, TGF-β1 and M-CSF) was added every other day. On days 12 and 25 after replating the HPCs, excess medium was carefully removed, leaving 3 ml/well behind. On day 25 and again on day 27 post replating, CD200 (100 ng/ml; Novoprotein America, Fremont, CA, USA) and fractalkine (100 ng/ml; Peprotech) were additionally added to the medium to support microglial maturation. hiMGL cells were harvested between days 40 and 43 post induction (days 28 and 31 post replating, respectively). Immunocytochemistry hiMGL cells were seeded onto 12 mm glass cover­slips in 24-well plates (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany). Cells were fixed, washed with PBS, and treated with blocking solution [5% normal donkey serum (Merck) and 0.1% Triton X-100 (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany)] for 1 h. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C ( Table S1 ). Subsequently, they were washed three times with PBS and incubated with an appropriate secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature ( Table S1 ). Nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) solution (Merck) for 20 min. Cells were washed three times with PBS and coverslips were attached onto glass slides using one drop of Aqua-Poly/Mount (Polysciences Europe, Hirschberg an der Bergstraße, Germany). Images were acquired using a Leica DMi8 Thunder Imager 3D microscope with a Leica DMC 2900 camera or a Leica DMi8 microscope with a Leica DFC450 C camera (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Quantitative reverse transcription PCR For gene expression analysis, cells were harvested and RNA was isolated with the ReliaPrep RNA tissue kit (Promega, Fitchburg, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA purity and concentration were measured using a NanoDrop 8000 spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Schwerte, Germany) and RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the PrimeScript RT reagent kit (Takara Bio, Kusatsu, Japan). Duplicate quantitative PCR was performed using a 7500 Fast Real-Time thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, USA) with the SYBR Green Master Mix (Life Technologies). TATA box-binding protein ( TBP ) was used as the housekeeping gene ( Table S2 ). Cycle threshold (Ct) values were recorded for each sample for the target gene and the housekeeping gene and ΔCt values were calculated. Expression is shown relative to the expression of the housekeeping gene in CTL hiMGL cells. Scratch wound assay Cell motility was assessed using the IncuCyte cell migration kit (Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany) and an Incucyte Zoom live cell analysis system (Sartorius). 100,000 hiMGL cells were seeded onto a 96-well ImageLock plate (Sartorius) and incubated for 4 h in serum-free microglia maturation medium supplemented with IL-34, TGF-β1, M-CSF, CD200 and fractalkine. Scratches were then made in all wells simultaneously using the IncuCyte cell migration kit (Sartorius). Inhibitors and agonists were added according to the respective experimental conditions: 5-BDBD (100 μM; P2RX4 inhibitor), ARC-69931 (10 μM; P2RY12 inhibitor), A 740003 (100 μM; P2RX7 inhibitor), ATP (10 μM/1000 μM), PAM2CSK4 (100 ng/ml; TLR2 agonist) and 506 (100 ng/ml; TLR8 agonist) ( Table S5 ). Plates were then placed into the IncuCyte Zoom live cell analysis system, where hourly images were taken for 48 h at 4× magnification. Data were acquired using the scratch wound analysis tool from the IncuCyte Zoom software (Sartorius) and presented as RWD as a percentage. For each experiment, a new processing definition was set by adjusting segmentation bias and setting a minimal object area of 500 µm 2 . Confluency was measured and expressed as the percentage of scratch wound surface covered by the migrating cells. Confluency was normalized to 0% confluency at t=0. Electrophysiological recordings An Axioskop FS2plus (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), a conventional patch-clamp amplifier (EPC9, HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany) and TIDA 5.23 software (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany) were used. Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass with resistances of 3–8 MΩ. The intracellular solution used contained 130 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0.5 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM Na-ATP, 5 mM EGTA and 10 mM HEPES and had an osmolarity of 310-320 mOsm/l adjusted to a pH of 7.3 with KOH. The extracellular solution contained 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 10 mM HEPES and 10 mM D-glucose, with pH 7.4 and osmolarity 270-290 mOsm/l. Experiments with series resistances less than 100 MΩ were used for data analysis. All experiments were performed in the voltage-clamp configuration. To obtain current-voltage curves during continuous recordings, the membrane was clamped every for 5 s from a holding potential of either −70 mV (membrane properties;  Fig. S6 ) or −20 mV (ATP responses;  Figs 4  and  5 ) to a series of 50 ms depolarizing and hyperpolarizing voltages ranging from −140 to 60 mV with 10 or 20 mV increments. Membrane currents were averaged for quantification between 30 and 45 ms after clamping the membrane to a given value from the resting potential. Membrane capacitance was quantified based on an exponential fit of the current decay in response to a −10 mV test pulse. The same pulse was used to quantify series resistance from the peak amplitude of the membrane capacitance currents. Comparisons of membrane currents between different groups were normalized to the membrane capacitance. In vitro  phagocytosis assay The phagocytosis assays were performed as previously described ( Pannell et al., 2016 ) with some adaptations. hiMGL cells were seeded onto glass coverslips in 24-well plates (2.5×10 5  cells/well), incubated in serum-free microglia maturation medium supplemented with IL-34, TGF-β1, M-CSF, CD200 and fractalkine for 4 h, and were stimulated with or without 1 μg/ml LPS (Merck). Yellow-green-fluorescent Fluoresbrite carboxylated microbeads (3.00 µm diameter, Polysciences Europe) were pre-opsonized with fetal calf serum (FCS, Life Technologies) by shaking at 1000 rpm for 30 min at room temperature. After centrifugation for 2 min at 900  , the supernatant was discarded and microbeads were washed and resuspended in HBSS (Life Technologies). hiMGL cells were incubated with the microbead suspension (approximately 4.8×10 g 6  microbeads/well) containing either no stimulant (basal), UDP (100 µM; Abcam, ab120383) or LPS (1 μg/ml) for 45 min. Cells were then washed with PBS (Life Technologies). Coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed and blocked in TBS containing 5% donkey serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h. Cells were next stained with anti-IBA1 antibody ( Table S1 ) in TBS containing 5% donkey serum overnight. After washing, cells were incubated with a secondary Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated antibody ( Table S1 ) and DAPI before mounting with Aqua-Poly/Mount. Three z-stack images per coverslip were acquired using a Leica TCS SPE confocal laser microscope (Leica Microsystems). Images were 3D-rendered using Imaris software (Imaris 9, Oxford Instruments, Abingdon, UK). IBA1 surfaces and spots for DAPI and microbeads were created. To represent the hiMGL cell number per image, DAPI spots within IBA1 surfaces were assessed using the ‘split into object’ function. To represent the phagocytosed beads, the numbers of beads within IBA1 surfaces were counted. Using in-house developed Python software, cells were grouped as having 0, 0 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 3, or >3 beads per cell. The percentage of cells in each group was multiplied by the corresponding grade of phagocytosis: 0, grade 1; 0 to 1, grade 2; 1 to 2, grade 3; 2 to 3, grade 4; and >3, grade 5. The sum of the products in each group was then defined as the phagocytosis index. cAMP ELISA cAMP levels in hiMGL cells were determined using the cAMP ELISA kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, hiMGL cells were resuspended in 100 μl of 0.1 M HCl and centrifuged for 10 min at 1000  . Supernatants were neutralized with ELISA buffer at a ratio of 1:2. Next, sample acetylation was performed by adding 60 μl of 4 M KOH and 15 μl acetic anhydride, vortexing for 15 s, followed by the addition of 15 μl of 4 M KOH. Samples and standards were pipetted into the ELISA plates and incubated for 18 h at 4°C before the plate was developed with Ellmann's reagent (included in the cAMP ELISA kit). Fluorescence was measured at 420 nm using a Tecan Infinite M200 plate reader (Tecan Group, Männedorf, Switzerland) g Multiplex ELISA The cell supernatant (25 μl) was analyzed using the MagPix System (Luminex/Merck). The MILLIPLEX MAP human cytokine/chemokine/growth factor panel A – immunology multiplex assay (HCYTA-60K, Merck) was used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The following analytes were included in the analysis: GM-CSF, GRO, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IP-10, MCP-1, MCP-3, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, RANTES and TNF-α. Xponent (Luminex) and Milliplex Analyst (Merck) software was used for data acquisition. Background intensity (pure medium) was subtracted from the mean fluorescent intensity. Concentration (pg/ml) was determined using an 8-point calibration curve including the matrix (cell culture medium). The standards were measured twice. Samples were measured only once. To determine the instrumental variance, pooled samples were used as quality control. RNA sequencing and analysis RNA was extracted from four independently generated hiMGL cell cultures for each genotype (CTL, M1 and M3) and subjected to sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq platform. RNA sequencing analysis was generated using Partek Flow software, v10.0 ( https://www.partek.com/partek-flow/ ). RNA sequencing reads were aligned to the hg38 Ensembl release 105 assembly with STAR v2.7.8a ( Dobin et al., 2013 ). Gene counts and isoform expression were derived from the Ensembl output. Sequencing performance was assessed for the total number of aligned reads, total number of uniquely aligned reads and features detected. Normalization size factors were calculated for all gene counts by median ratio. Differential genetic analysis was then performed using DESeq2 ( Love et al., 2014 ) to analyze for differences between conditions. Results were filtered for only those genes with FDR≤0.05 and fold changes more than ±5. Additional analyses were performed with cutoff criteria of >2 or >3 fold change. These data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (accession number  GSE203647 ). Statistics Data are expressed as mean±s.e.m. A combination of one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's post hoc test or Tukey's multiple comparisons test was employed to compare data between more than two experimental groups. Two-tailed unpaired Student's  t -test was used to compare data between two experimental conditions.

PMID:33436083,Distinctive epigenomic alterations in NF1-deficient cutaneous and plexiform neurofibromas drive differential MKK/p38 signaling.,"Benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors are the clinical hallmark of Neurofibromatosis Type 1. They account for substantial morbidity and mortality in NF1. Cutaneous (CNF) and plexiform neurofibromas (PNF) share nearly identical histology, but maintain different growth rates and risk of malignant conversion. The reasons for this disparate clinical behavior are not well explained by recent genome or transcriptome profiling studies. We hypothesized that CNFs and PNFs are epigenetically distinct tumor types that exhibit differential signaling due to genome-wide and site-specific methylation events. We interrogated the methylation profiles of 45 CNFs and 17 PNFs from NF1 subjects with the Illumina EPIC 850K methylation array. Based on these profiles, we confirm that CNFs and PNFs are epigenetically distinct tumors with broad differences in higher-order chromatin states and specific methylation events altering genes involved in key biological and cellular processes, such as inflammation, RAS/MAPK signaling, actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, and oxytocin signaling. Based on our identification of two separate DMRs associated with alternative leading exons in MAP2K3, we demonstrate differential RAS/MKK3/p38 signaling between CNFs and PNFs. Epigenetic reinforcement of RAS/MKK/p38 was a defining characteristic of CNFs leading to pro-inflammatory signaling and chromatin conformational changes, whereas PNFs signaled predominantly through RAS/MEK. Tumor size also correlated with specific CpG methylation events. Taken together, these findings confirm that NF1 deficiency influences the epigenetic regulation of RAS signaling fates, accounting for observed differences in CNF and PNF clinical behavior. The extension of these findings is that CNFs may respond differently than PNFs to RAS-targeted therapeutics raising the possibility of targeting p38-mediated inflammation for CNF treatment.","Methods Trial participants and sample collection 45 cutaneous neurofibromas, 17 plexiform neurofibromas, and 9 normal skin and nerve samples were collected from individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of Neurofibromatosis Type 1. These samples were collected prospectively under an approved Spectrum Health/Van Andel Research Institute IRB protocol (SH/VAI IRB#2014–295) ( NCT02777775 ). Additional specimens were analyzed according to ethical standards and under a Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) institutional review board (IRB)-approved protocol (JH IRB # J1649, PI Pratilas). The JH NF1 biospecimen repository is supported by a grant from the Neurofibromatosis Therapeutic Acceleration Program (NTAP, n-tap.org), to C.A.P. Analysis by Sage Bionetworks is supported through the Neurofibromatosis Therapeutic Acceleration Program (NTAP, n-tap.org). Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Tumor samples were isolated by microdissection to remove adjacent normal tissue then snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80 °C. Quality parameters included assessment of percent content (> 95%) and viability (> 90% nuclear viability) by H/E staining. Biospecimen handling was performed according to BRISQ guidelines. 5mC interrogation by Infinium MethylationEPIC array To extract DNA, frozen tissue was manually dissected into small pieces and homogenized by bead beating (Lysing Matrix D; MP Biomedicals) in UltraPure phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (ThermoFisher) according to the manufacture’s protocol. DNA was quantified by Qubit fluorometry (Life Technologies) and 500 ng of DNA from each sample was bisulfite converted using the Zymo EZ DNA Methylation Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol using the specified modifications for the Illumina Infinium Methylation Assay. After conversion, all bisulfite reactions were cleaned using the Zymo-Spin binding columns and eluted in 12 uL of Tris buffer. Following elution, BS converted DNA was processed through the EPIC array protocol. The EPIC array contains > 850 K probes querying methylation sites including CpG islands and non-island regions, RefSeq genes, ENCODE open chromatin, ENCODE transcription factor binding sites, and FANTOM5 enhancers. To perform the assay, 7uL of converted DNA was denatured with 1ul 0.4 N sodium hydroxide. DNA was then amplified, hybridized to the EPIC bead chip, and an extension reaction was performed using fluorophore-labeled nucleotides per the manufacturer’s protocol. Array beadchips were scanned on the Illumina iScan platform and probe specific calls were made using Illumina Genome Studio software. EPIC methylation array data pre-processing Data were analyzed using a modified workflow that is similar to the ChAMP methylation array analysis procedure in R (v3.5.1). Briefly, samples were filtered for probes with poor or skewed intensities (detection  p -value < 0.01) and entire samples were removed from the dataset if they contained > 10% failed probes. One sample exceeded the aforementioned filtering criteria and was removed from the dataset resulting in 70 total samples. Next, probes that have previously been identified to skew downstream differential methylation analyses (SNP probes, cross-reactive probes with other genomic regions, etc.) were removed in addition to probes that target sex chromosomes [ 48 ]. Next, a single-sample normalization method (ssNOOB) was applied to each sample to normalize and remove background signal from the data prior to downstream analyses (Supplemental Fig.  4 ) [ 49 ]. Sources of technical variation were found to significantly ( p  < 0.05) contribute to the variation explained in the first couple principle components in addition to tissue effects based on SVD analysis as implemented in ChAMP (v2.18.3) and corrected using the sva (v3.30.1) package in R for visualization purposes only. The results of this procedure for the first 11 PCs can be found in Supplemental Fig.  5 . Technical variation was modeled as either fixed or random effects on the uncorrected data in the differential methylation analysis described below. Further, prior to differential methylation calling, additional SNP and CpH probes were removed using ChAMP (v2.18.3) using the default parameters for the function rmSNPandCH. In total, 717,148 probes were analyzed for differential methylation across tissue types. Differential methylation analysis Differentially methylated loci between cutaneous and plexiform neurofibromas were identified using a hierarchical generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) approach with a logit link function as implemented in glmmTMB (v0.2.2) on the pre-processed beta-values. Partially repeated tissue sampling was modeled as a random effect with patient nested within methylation array slide unless specified otherwise. Group-level differences were determined using a likelihood ratio test (LRT) with a significance threshold of  q  < 0.05. False discovery rate adjustment was done using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure. Models were filtered out for downstream analysis if they failed to converge. In total, 31,201 probes were found to be differentially methylated between cutaneous and plexiform neurofibromas. Differentially methylated regions were called using DMRcate (v1.18.0). Results from glmmTMB were wrangled into a suitable data structure as input for DMRcate by using the Wald statistic as the stat and a quasi-beta fold-change using the exponentiated model estimates for each probe. Default parameters were used for DMRcate with the bandwidth scaling factor (C parameter) set to 2. To identify differentially methylated loci associated with cutaneous neurofibroma size, a GLMM with a logit link was fitted, adjusting for age and sex differences and a random intercept term for partially repeated tissue sampling. Significant associations ( q  < 0.05) between CNF size in millimeters and probe-level methylation were determined as described above. A total of 188 loci were found to be significant. Positive or negative correlations were computed on significant probes using Kendall’s Tau. False discovery rate was controlled using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure and significant correlations were determined at a  q  < 0.05 threshold. Significantly correlated probes were filtered on a delta Beta-value (maximum Beta-value minus the minimum Beta-value) of 0.2, resulting in 34 loci. Inference of chromatin conformation from EPIC methylation arrays Chromatin compartments were computed at 100 kb resolution as previously described and implemented in compartmap (v1.65.71). Briefly, pre-processed M-values were subset to “open sea” CpG probes (at least 4 kb away from annotated CpG island) and masked probes that were found in at least 50% of samples were imputed using k-nearest neighbor via the impute (v1.59.0) R package. Next, loci were median summarized in 100 kb bins. Group-level compartments were inferred by computing Pearson correlations of summarized bins and the first principal component of the correlation matrix. A/B compartments correspond to positive (open chromatin) and negative (closed chromatin) eigenvalues, respectively. Genome-wide discordant compartments were identified by comparing the sign of the eigenvalue for overlapping genomic bins and filtering out those with small absolute eigenvalues (> 0.02). In total, we identified 2937 discordant chromatin compartments between plexiform and cutaneous neurofibromas. Results were plotted using circlize (v0.4.8). Pathway and GO term enrichment Enrichment of pathways and gene ontology (GO) terms was performed using the gometh function within the missMethyl (v1.16.0) package in R. Briefly, gometh considers the relatively uneven density of loci covered on the Infinium methylation arrays and utilizes this information when computing enrichment, similar to the approach goseq uses for RNA-seq. Significant CpGs were identified as described above and the background probe set was derived following pre-processing. Significant GO terms and KEGG pathways were determined using a  q  < 0.05 threshold. Results were plotted using ggplot2 (v3.2.1). Tissue purity estimates Tissue purity was estimated by PAMES (v0.2.3) and annotations built for computing informative sites using IlluminaHumanMethylationEPICanno.ilm10b2.hg19 (v0.6.0). Cutaneous neurofibromas were compared against normal skin samples and plexiform neurofibromas were compared against normal nerve. Results were plotted using ggplot2 (v3.2.1). Copy number estimation from EPIC methylation arrays Copy number alterations were computed using SeSAMe (v1.3.2) with minor modifications for plotting functionality [ 50 ]. Briefly, raw data were processed using the “open SeSAMe” procedure, producing a signal set object. Next, samples were segmented (50 kb bins) and called for copy number differences, comparing CNFs to normal skin and PNFs to normal nerve using the cnSegmentation function with default parameters in SeSAMe. The genome annotation used was hg19 and relevant annotations are pulled in automatically from the sesameData package by the cnSegmentation function. Data were visualized using the log2 ratio of per-sample signal over the reference. RNA-sequencing data analysis Paired-end, raw neurofibroma and plexiform neurofibroma RNA-seq data were downloaded from syn4939902. Sequencing lanes were merged, followed by alignment with STAR (v2.7.0f) to b37 (downloaded from the GATK resource bundle— https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/download/bundle ), using the Gencode v19 annotations). Alignment was performed using default parameters with the following modifications: -twopassMode Basic, -outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate, and -quantMode GeneCounts. Reverse-stranded gene counts were read into R (v3.6.1) using edgeR (v3.27.14), excluding sample 2-025 due to sample quality. Gene counts were restricted to known, protein coding genes and lincRNA. Samples were further filtered to genes that had greater than 1 count per million (CPM) in at least 3 samples. Libraries were normalized using the trimmed mean of M-values method. Dimensionality reduction was performed using the prcomp function (v3.6.1) on the filtered log2 CPM and plotted using ggplot2 (v3.2.1). Western blotting For protein analysis, samples were divided into methylation high, methylation intermediate, and methylation low groups based on the beta-values across MAP2K3 DMR1 and samples from each group were randomly chosen as a representative subset of the discovery cohort. Protein lysates were prepared by manually homogenizing frozen tissue in RIPA buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Roche). Proteins were separated on a 4–20% TGX SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Invitrogen). Blots were blocked in 5% dry milk in TBST buffer (20 mmol/L Tris–HCl pH 7.4, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) and incubated at 4 °C overnight in primary antibody; MKK3 (Cell Signaling #5674), p38 (Cell Signaling #9219), phospho-p38 (Cell Signaling # 4511), phospho-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling #9101), and β-Actin (Cell Signaling #3700). Densitometry was done in ImageJ. Data availability Raw and processed EPIC array data are available from Synapse: syn4939910. Raw RNA-seq fastq data were downloaded from syn4939902. Statistical methods Pairwise comparisons of beta-regressions calculated by betareg (v3.1–2) were done using emmeans (v1.4.2). For correlation analysis, normality was first assessed by a Shapiro–Wilk normality test. Data following a normal distribution were analyzed by Pearson’s product–moment correlation, while non-normally distributed data were analyzed by Spearman’s rank correlation rho. For all correlation plots, data were fit by stat_smooth using loess with span = 1 using ggplot2 (v3.2.1). All analyses were done using R (v3.6.1).

PMID:28193237,Evaluation of quality of life in adults with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) using the Impact of NF1 on Quality Of Life (INF1-QOL) questionnaire.,"BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is an inherited, multi-system, tumour suppressor disorder with variable complications that cause psychological distress and social isolation. The study aim was to develop and validate a disease-specific questionnaire to measure quality of life (QOL) in NF1 that is suitable both as an assessment tool in clinical practice and in clinical trials of novel therapy. METHODS: The Impact of NF1 on Quality of Life (INF1-QOL) questionnaire was developed by a literature search for common terms, focus group (n = 6), semi-structured interviews (n = 21), initial drafts (n =50) and final 14 item questionnaire (n = 50). Bivariate correlations between items, exploratory factor analysis, correlations with severity and EuroQol were employed. RESULTS: INF1-QOL showed good internal reliability (Cronbach's alpha 0.87), mean total INF1-QOL score was 8.64 (SD 6.3), median 7.00, range 0-30 (possible range 0-42); no significant correlations with age or gender. The mean total EuroQol score was 7.38 (SD 2.87), median 6.5, mean global EuroQol score was 76.34 (SD 16.56), median 80. Total INF1-QOL score correlated with total EuroQol r = 0.82, p < 0.0001. The highest impact on QOL was moderate or severe problems with anxiety and depression (32%) and negative effects of NF1 on role and outlook on life (42%). The mean inter-relater reliability for grading of clinical severity scores was 0.71 (range 0.65-0.79), and intra-class correlation was 0.92. The mean clinical severity score was 1.95 (SD 0.65) correlating r = 0.34 with total INF1-QOL score p < 0.05 and correlated 0.37 with total EuroQol score p < 0.01. The clinical severity score was mild in 17 (34%), moderate in 16 (32%) and 17 (34%) individuals had severe disease. CONCLUSIONS: INF1-QOL is a validated, reliable disease specific questionnaire that is easy and quick to complete. Role and outlook on life and anxiety and depression have the highest impact on QOL indicating the variability, severity and unpredictability of NF1. INFI-QOL correlates moderately with clinical severity. The moderate relationship between INF1-QOL and physician rated severity emphasizes the difference between clinical and patient perception. INFI-QOL will be useful in individual patient assessment and as an outcome measure for clinical trials.","Methods The Impact of NF1 on Quality of Life (INF1-QOL) questionnaire was developed by a literature search for common terms, focus group ( n  = 6), semi-structured interviews ( n  = 21), initial drafts ( n  =50) and final 14 item questionnaire ( n  = 50). Bivariate correlations between items, exploratory factor analysis, correlations with severity and EuroQol were employed. Methods Guy’s and St. Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust (GSTT) and Central Manchester University Hospitals Foundation Trust (CMFT) are national centres for the diagnosis, management and support of approximately 1000 people with mild and severe NF1 in each centre. Adults with NF1 were approached when they attended the clinic and given information sheets identifying the aims of the projects and inviting them to participate in the study. Adults (18 years or older) who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for NF1 (NIH Consensus Development Conference 1987) [ 15 ] and attended the National NF1 service at GSTT or CMFT were included. NF1 individuals under 18 years, people who did not fulfil the diagnostic criteria for NF1 and patients who were unable to give informed consent were excluded. Interpreters were available and support was offered by the clinical nurse specialist to patients with cognitive and literacy problems, visual impairment, upper limb weakness, numbness or incoordination. Ethical Committee approval for the study was obtained from County Durham and Tees Valley Research and Ethics Committee. Written informed consent was obtained from every participant. Disease severity was determined using the Riccardi NF severity grade classification 1 to 4 [ 16 ]. Grades 1 and 2 were amalgamated to ensure adequate numbers in each group. Grades 1 and 2 were deemed mild, grade 3 moderate and grade 4 severe. Four clinicians (three neurology consultants and a clinical nurse specialist) with expertise in NF1 rated the patient clinical problem list independently. Development of INF1-QOL questionnaire The impact of neurofibromatosis one on quality of life questionnaire was named INF1-QOL and the questionnaire was developed using sequential stages to ensure robust construction. A comprehensive list of symptoms, social and emotional difficulties related to NF1 was produced using a literature review, qualitative interviews and advice from clinicians and nurses with expertise in NF1. As part of routine care, six sequential patients attending the NF1 service were invited to a focus group session to discuss symptoms and concerns that could impact on NF1 QOL. The session was manually recorded and coded and identifying data were removed. GSTT and CMFT recruited 21 individuals to participate in qualitative interviews and they were representative of the general NF1 population as regards age, gender and disease severity. The in-depth interview was semi-structured and conducted in a secure private environment [ 17 ]. All interviews were recorded and transcribed, identifying data were removed and analysis was carried out using a framework approach [ 17 ]. A list of 55 items was generated by these processes and analysed by a multi-disciplinary panel of NF1 specialists and a psychologist to produce a pilot questionnaire using the previously proven systematic approach [ 13 ]. The 16 item pilot questionnaire was completed by 50 NF1 participants. The pilot questionnaire was analysed by the following: bivariate correlations between items, exploratory factor analysis and correlations with physician severity scoring. The pilot questionnaire comprised 16 items that the participant rated as no problem, mild, moderate or severe. After completion of the 16 item pilot questionnaire, the questions on interactions with health services and other people’s attitudes to NF1 were removed due to redundancy with other items. The final questionnaire was completed by a further 50 patients. It comprised 14 items that were rated by the participant in the same way as the pilot questionnaire. The maximum potential score for the 14 item questionnaire was 42, each item was scored from zero to three, and the highest score denoted the worst function. A free text section was included at the end for participants to provide an explanation and expanded information on any item that impacted on QOL. The final 14 item INF1-QOL questionnaire was administered with a generic measure of QOL. The EuroQol questionnaires were completed by the 50 NF1 participants who did the final 14 item INF1-QOL questionnaire. The EuroQol (EQ 5D) contains a global health score and covers Mobility, Self-care, Usual Activities, Pain/Discomfort, Anxiety and Depression [ 10 ]. Physician rated severity score and EuroQol provided some estimate of external validity in the 14 item pilot questionnaire. Participants were offered long-term follow-up in GSTT or CMFT national NF1 centres as part of routine clinical care for people with neurofibromatosis 1.

PMID:27021207,Acceptance and commitment therapy in youth with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and chronic pain and their parents: A pilot study of feasibility and preliminary efficacy.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder affecting about 1 in 3,500 individuals. Chronic pain is commonly reported among individuals with NF1 and plexiform neurofibroma tumors (PNs). Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), an empirically supported method for addressing chronic pain, helps individuals re-focus on valued relationships and activities. This pilot study investigated the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a brief ACT workshop in the NF1 population. Eligible participants included adolescents and young adults (AYA; 12-21 years) with NF1 and chronic pain that interfered with daily functioning and their parents. Patients and parents completed baseline measures of pain interference, pain intensity, functional disability, pain acceptance, depression, and anxiety. Then, AYA and parents participated separately in a 2-day small-group ACT workshop. A telephone booster session occurred 1 month post-intervention. Three-month post-treatment measures were completed by mail. Ten adolescents (4 males; M age = 16.9 years) and seven parents provided baseline and 3-month data. Mean satisfaction with the study was moderate to high (3.9 for patients and 4.6 for parents on a 1-5 scales). Patients and parents reported significant declines in patients' pain interference at 3 months post-treatment. Patient-reported pain intensity significantly declined from baseline to 3 months. Parents reported marginally greater acceptance of their child's pain. No changes emerged in functional ability or mood. Preliminary findings suggest that a brief ACT group intervention is feasible and may help AYA with NF1 and PNs cope with their chronic pain, although larger randomized studies are needed to confirm treatment efficacy. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","MATERIALS AND METHODS Eligibility Criteria Eligible AYA participants were between 12 and 21 years of age and were enrolled on an NF1 natural history or treatment study at a government research institute. All patients must have had a diagnosis of NF1 according to the NIH Consensus Conference criteria [ Stumpf et al., 1988 ] or have had a confirmed germline  NF1  mutation with analysis performed in a CLIA-certified laboratory. Patients also must have had a response of three or higher on a pain interference item (1–5 scales) from a self-report or parent-report QOL measure (Impact of Pediatric Illness Scale [ Wolters et al., 2010 ]) assessing the extent to which pain interfered with the patient’s daily functioning over the past month. They could not be participating in other medical or behavioral treatment studies for pain management or scheduled to begin a new treatment protocol for their NF1 during the 3 months on the current study. Finally, patients also had to be living with a primary caregiver who was willing to participate in the parent intervention. In total, 20 eligible patient–parent pairs were identified (see  Fig. 1 ). Of these pairs, 14 (70%) agreed to participate and were enrolled. The primary reason cited for non-participation was difficulty traveling to the research facility from distant locations. The majority of enrolled patients (86%) took part in all three workshop sessions, and 83% of patients and 56% of parents who completed the workshop provided complete follow-up data. Measures Questionnaires were administered to patients and parents at baseline and at the 3-month follow-up assessment. These validated measures assessed domains of pain interference, pain intensity, functional disability, pain acceptance, pain-related anxiety, depression, health-related quality of life, parent psychological distress, and disease severity (completed by a nurse practitioner). In addition, two scales developed by the authors for the current study assessed pain management techniques used by the patients (Pain Management Inventory) and treatment adherence and study satisfaction (Post-Treatment Questionnaire). Details on these measures are in  Table I . Procedures The research site’s Institutional Review Board approved study procedures (registered with  clinicaltrials.gov , # ). Adult patients, or parents of patients younger than 18 years, were contacted by phone if they had indicated the presence of chronic pain to a nurse practitioner during a physical examination at their most recent visit (typically within the past year). If eligible, interested families were scheduled to attend a small group workshop (3–5 patients per group) with approximately same-aged peers. When possible, this visit was scheduled to coincide with a previously scheduled medical visit. A nurse practitioner conducted a history and physical exam, including a thorough pain assessment, and baseline questionnaires were completed. Following baseline procedures, the ACT intervention was implemented in three 2-hr sessions occurring over 2 days. The 2-day workshop format was chosen since most families are referred to our NF1 program from around the United States. Thus, weekly sessions were not practical. One month after the workshop, patients and parents were contacted by telephone for a “booster” session. Three months post-intervention, participants were asked to complete follow-up questionnaires by mail. If forms were not returned within 2 weeks, a researcher called the participant to confirm receipt and to encourage the participant to return them as soon as possible. ACT Intervention The ACT workshops consisted of a patient program and corresponding parent program, each focused on helping participants cope with the patient’s pain more effectively. Two therapists conducted each group. Workshop content was adapted from manualized ACT interventions outlined in books [ Hayes et al., 1999 ;  Dahl et al., 2005 ] and articles [ Wicksell et al., 2007 ;  Vowles et al., 2009 ;  Masuda et al., 2011 ]. We modified some techniques to make them more appropriate for teenagers. While the manual content did not differ for younger versus older adolescents, some specific examples of ACT concepts varied. For example, when discussing values, the younger patients were more focused on sports and friends, while the older adolescents often brought up values related to academics, career, and romantic relationships. During the first workshop session with the AYA, the nurse practitioner briefly discussed physiological aspects of pain in NF1. Patients were informed that if they had any new pain or a significant increase in pain while on study, they should contact their physician. The remainder of the sessions focused on ACT-specific techniques and discussion. Briefly, content included an overview and practice of mindfulness techniques, such as mindful breathing. We also discussed how pain has interfered with the patients’ daily lives, specifically with respect to achieving values-consistent goals. Patients were encouraged to try defusion techniques, such as physicalizing their pain (i.e., picturing their pain as a separate form or shape) [ Hayes et al., 1999 ] and verbalizing fused thought content using a silly or different voice. Acceptance was practiced by engaging in imagery whereby patients visualized their pain inside their body and imagined making space for it instead of trying to get rid of it [ Harris, 2008 ]. Finally, workshop facilitators helped patients outline short- and long-term goals consistent with their identified values, and worked to increase willingness to commit to these goals while living with their pain. The parent workshop focused on using ACT techniques to support their child in living more consistently with his or her values, and to help themselves cope with feelings about their child’s pain. Parents were encouraged to practice mindfulness, to increase their acceptance of their child’s condition, and to establish goals consistent with their identified parenting values. All participants were assigned ACT exercises to practice on their own between each session. Patients and parents were also given a workbook to take home that included a summary of the topics discussed and exercises for continuing to work on ACT techniques at home. One-Month Telephone “Booster” Session Four to six weeks after the baseline visit, a therapist called all patients and parents individually for a “booster” session. During these 15–20 min calls, participants were asked about the progress they had made toward their goals. The core ACT principles and techniques were reviewed, including strategies for overcoming barriers or challenges the participants reported experiencing. The therapist encouraged them to continue working on their goals. Parents were asked about their child’s progress and their own use of ACT strategies to help them in their parenting goals. Statistical Analyses Descriptive statistics were computed on the variables of interest (means, standard deviations). Due to the small sample size, the Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to assess changes on the outcome measures from baseline to 3 months. Spearman correlations were conducted to assess the relationships between primary and secondary measures.",Staci Martin; Pamela L Wolters; Mary Anne Toledo-Tamula; Shawn Nelson Schmitt; Andrea Baldwin; Amy Starosta; Andrea Gillespie; Brigitte Widemann,American journal of medical genetics.

PMID:40437318,Quantitative MRI of dorsal root ganglion alterations in neurofibromatosis type 1 patients with or without pain.,"BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder characterised by skin and nervous system anomalies, primarily involving glial cells and nerve tumours. Pain, particularly chronic pain, is a significant but often overlooked symptom in NF1 patients, affecting their health-related quality of life. The dorsal root ganglion (DRG) is essential for pain signal transmission, yet in vivo studies of DRG in NF1 patients are lacking. METHODS: This prospective study included 20 NF1 patients (8 with neuropathic pain) and 28 healthy controls. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of lumbosacral DRG (L5 + S1) were performed using a 3-T scanner. Quantitative MRI techniques were applied to assess DRG volume, T2 relaxation time, and proton density (PD). Statistical analyses compared NF1 patients and controls, and NF1 patients with and without pain. RESULTS: NF1 patients had a significantly larger DRG volume and higher quantitative T2 and PD values compared to controls. Furthermore, DRG PD was significantly higher in NF1 patients with neuropathic pain than in those without pain. Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis identified DRG PD as the best discriminator of pain in NF1 patients, with an area under the curve of 0.84, indicating relevant and useful discriminatory power. CONCLUSION: NF1 patients showed objective macrostructural and microstructural DRG injury changes using dedicated DRG MRI, discriminating neuropathic pain status from non-pain status at the disease-symptom group level. These findings highlight the potential of DRG MRI to quantify DRG pathology in vivo and to determine the risk of functional pain status by imaging. RELEVANCE STATEMENT: The identification of structural and microstructural changes of the DRG by quantitative MRI provides a novel in vivo biomarker for understanding neuropathic pain mechanisms, pain risk assessment and treatment monitoring in NF1. KEY POINTS: Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in NF1 are enlarged by 176.3% in MRI. In quantitative MRI of DRG NF1, T2 relaxation time is increased by 22.9% and PD by 8.4%. DRG PD can distinguish a painful from a non-painful NF1 phenotype.","Methods This prospective study included 20 NF1 patients (8 with neuropathic pain) and 28 healthy controls. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of lumbosacral DRG (L5 + S1) were performed using a 3-T scanner. Quantitative MRI techniques were applied to assess DRG volume, T2 relaxation time, and proton density (PD). Statistical analyses compared NF1 patients and controls, and NF1 patients with and without pain. Methods Study population From May 2022 to November 2023, 48 consecutive subjects were included in this study. All of them provided written informed consent beforehand. An ethics approval was obtained from the responsible Ethics Committee of the University of Würzburg (Institutional Review Board #136/20). The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study cohort was composed as follows: 20 consecutive NF1 patients were included in the study and divided into groups according to the presence of neuropathic pain (NF1p,  n  = 8) or absence of neuropathic pain (NF1n,  n  = 12). The allocation to one of the two groups was made by two neurosurgeons with experience in the clinical management of NF1 patients (E.M. and C.M.) based on medical history and clinical examination (Supplementary Table  S1 ). The inclusion criteria for the pain group were an average pain score of ≥ 3 on the visual analogue 0–10 scale over the previous 10 weeks. All pain cases included were chronic, had been present for more than one year, and were in stable condition at the time of the study. Other causes of neuropathic pain and polyneuropathy were excluded by detailed medical history and electrophysiological studies. In addition, severe psychiatric disorders were predefined exclusion criteria. Further exclusion criteria for subjects were minority, pregnancy, ongoing infectious disease, substance abuse, history of back surgery, and insufficient physical fitness to participate in the studies. Twenty-eight consecutive healthy subjects without a pain syndrome or any form of neurological or metabolic disease served as the healthy control group. The study design is summarised in Fig.  1 .

The acquisition protocol included a multiecho spin-echo sequence for quantitative evaluation, with the following technical parameters: echo train length 10; Δ echo time range 15 ms; repetition time: 4,800 ms; flip angle 180°; in plane resolution 1.5 × 1.5 mm; slice thickness 1.8 mm; interslice gap 1.8 mm). The slice orientation was aligned paracoronal through the DRG of the lumbar 5 (L5) and sacral 1 (S1) levels. Image postprocessing was performed via MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc., 2024: MATLAB, version R2024a Update 3, retrieved from  https://www.mathworks.com/ ) using a custom-built script [ 25 ,  26 ]. Maps were fitted for T2 relaxation time and initial magnitude of magnetisation as an indicator of proton spin density (PD), taking into account B 1  field inhomogeneities. Quality control was performed, including checking the statistics of the fitting routine for plausibility and possible outliers. In addition, once the quantitative maps had been generated, a visual check was carried out to check for any artefacts or irregularities in the maps. To quantify DRG PD, the initial magnetisation magnitude (equilibrium magnetisation) of the DRG was normalised to the internal reference of the cerebrospinal fluid. Image analysis and feature extraction Image analysis was performed by two independent readers with 5 and 6 years of experience in neuroimaging (S.W. and M.S.). The two readers were blinded to each other, to diagnosis, and to demographic characteristics of the analysed subjects. The two readers independently performed three-dimensional selection of the volume of interest by manual segmentation of the DRG of levels L5 and S1 via 3D Slicer (The Slicer Community 2024: 3D Slicer, version 5.6.2, retrieved from:  https://www.slicer.org/ ). In this way, a total of 192 DRGs were analysed (48 subjects × 4 DRGs each). Subsequently, a three-dimensional model of every DRG was created, and DRG volume was calculated (number of voxels within the volume of interest x voxel size). From the segmentations, mask images were generated and multiplied by the calculated T2 and PD maps. From this, the features of DRG T2 and DRG PD were extracted for each DRG. DRG features were calculated independently for both readers to estimate the inter-rater reliability. For the statistical analyses, the mean of the values from the two readers was calculated. Statistical analysis Statistical analyses and visualisations were performed with R (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing 2024: R: A language for Data Analysis and Graphics, version 4.4.1, retrieved from:  https://www.r-project.org/ ) and GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Prism version 9.4.0, GraphPad Software). For descriptive statistics, all data is given as median (interquartile range) or number ( n ) (percentage), respectively. For comparisons of paired or unpaired groups, the Mann–Whitney  U -test or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for continuous variables. For the dichotomous variable sex, the χ 2  test or Fisher’s exact test was used. Spearman correlation coefficient ρ was calculated between demographic parameters and DRG features to estimate their impact. The inter-rater reliability of DRG features was estimated via the intraclass correlation coefficient (two-way, agreement). Testing each DRG feature as a discriminator between pain and no pain phenotype in NF1 was performed using receiver operating characteristic analysis and logistic regression analysis. Its area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to estimate its performance. An appropriate cutoff value for DRG PD to discriminate between a painful and a nonpainful NF1 phenotype was determined based on the Youden index (= sensitivity + specificity - 1). Model fit was assessed using McFadden’s  R 2 , indicating explanatory power, and the Akaike Information Criterion, reflecting model quality with a penalty for complexity. Lower AIC values and higher McFadden’s  R 2  suggest better model performance. Probability values of ≤ 0.05 were estimated as statistically significant. Due to the exploratory nature of the study and the fact that data for each subject were aggregated as means of DRG characteristics per subject, correction for multiple comparisons was not applied.",Magnus Schindehütte; Eva Meller; Thomas Kampf; Florian Hessenauer; Nurcan Üçeyler; György Homola; Heike L Rittner; Cordula Matthies; Mirko Pham; Simon Weiner,European radiology experimental,2025-05-28,10.1186/s41747-025-00594-x,minimal,True
PMID:29847659,Neurofibromin Deficiency Induces Endothelial Cell Proliferation and Retinal Neovascularization.,"PURPOSE: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the result of inherited mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene, which encodes the protein neurofibromin. Eye manifestations are common in NF1 with recent reports describing a vascular dysplasia in the retina and choroid. Common features of NF1 retinopathy include tortuous and dilated feeder vessels that terminate in capillary tufts, increased endothelial permeability, and neovascularization. Given the retinal vascular phenotype observed in persons with NF1, we hypothesize that preserving neurofibromin may be a novel strategy to control pathologic retinal neovascularization. METHODS: Nf1 expression in human endothelial cells (EC) was reduced using small hairpin (sh) RNA and EC proliferation, migration, and capacity to form vessel-like networks were assessed in response to VEGF and hypoxia. Wild-type (WT), Nf1 heterozygous (Nf1+/-), and Nf1flox/+;Tie2cre pups were subjected to hyperoxia/hypoxia using the oxygen-induced retinopathy model. Retinas were analyzed quantitatively for extent of retinal vessel dropout, neovascularization, and capillary branching. RESULTS: Neurofibromin expression was suppressed in response to VEGF, which corresponded with activation of Mek-Erk and PI3-K-Akt signaling. Neurofibromin-deficient EC exhibited enhanced proliferation and network formation in response to VEGF and hypoxia via an Akt-dependent mechanism. In response to hyperoxia/hypoxia, Nf1+/- retinas exhibited increased vessel dropout and neovascularization when compared with WT retinas. Neovascularization was similar between Nf1+/- and Nf1flox/+;Tie2cre retinas, but capillary drop out in Nf1flox/+;Tie2cre retinas was significantly reduced when compared with Nf1+/- retinas. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that neurofibromin expression is essential for controlling endothelial cell proliferation and retinal neovascularization and therapies targeting neurofibromin-deficient EC may be beneficial.","Methods Nf1  expression in human endothelial cells (EC) was reduced using small hairpin (sh) RNA and EC proliferation, migration, and capacity to form vessel-like networks were assessed in response to VEGF and hypoxia. Wild-type (WT),  Nf1  heterozygous ( Nf1 +/− ), and  Nf1 ;Tie2cre pups were subjected to hyperoxia/hypoxia using the oxygen-induced retinopathy model. Retinas were analyzed quantitatively for extent of retinal vessel dropout, neovascularization, and capillary branching. flox/+ Methods Human Endothelial Cell Culture Pooled human endothelial colony forming cells (ECFC, endothelial outgrowth cells) were purchased from the Angio BioCore at Indiana University (Principal Investigator: Karen Pollock, PhD).  Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) were purchased from Lonza (Allendale, NJ, USA). ECFC and HMVEC were maintained in Endothelial Basal Medium-2 (EBM2; Lonza) with additives (bullet kit) provided by the manufacturer. The media was supplemented with 10% Hyclone FBS (Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) and 2% penicillin/streptomycin. All cells were maintained 37°C, 5% CO 15 2  at normoxia unless otherwise stated. NF1  Gene Silencing Lentiviral vectors expressing  NF1  small hairpin (sh) RNA and shCtr were purchased from Sigma (CAT# TRCN000023878, TRCN0000039713, and SHC202; St. Louis, MO, USA). To generate lentiviral supernatant, 293FT packaging cells were plated onto tissue culture plates and transfected the following day using Lipotectamine 3000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. The transfected cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM; Thermo, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS. Viral stocks were harvested 24 hours after transfection, with collection at 48 and 72 hours, clarified by centrifugation, filtered through a 0.45-μm filter and stored at −80C. Human ECFC were seeded onto tissue culture plates coated with collagen and transduced with lentiviral stock diluted at 1:3 to 1:5 with EOC culture medium in the presence of 8 μg/mL polybrene (Sigma) for 8 hours. Fresh medium was replaced. At 48 hours posttransduction fresh medium with 0.5 μg/mL puromycin (Thermo) was replaced for 3 days. Selected cells were subcultured and  NF1  knockdown was confirmed by Western blot. Reagents The following antibodies were used: anti-neurofibromin (#A300; Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX, USA); anti-phospho-Akt XP (#4060), anti-Akt (#2938S), anti-phospho-Erk XP (#4370), anti-Erk (#4695S; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA); anti-phospho-endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) (612392) and FITC-anti-CD31 (BD Laboratories, San Jose, CA, USA); and anti-GAPDH (Novus, Littleton, CO, USA). Recombinant human and murine VEGF were purchased from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ, USA). Wortmannin was purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI, USA). BrdU Incorporation BrdU incorporation into ECFC was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA). Briefly, ECFC were progressively serum starved (5% FBS for 24 hours, 1% FBS for 7 hours, 0.125% for experiments) prior to the addition of VEGF (25 ng/mL). Two hours after the addition of VEGF, media was supplemented with BrdU and cells were fixed 24 or 48 hours following VEGF stimulation. Fixed cells were labeled with anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody followed by a goat anti-mouse IgG Peroxidase Conjugate. Signal intensity was measured using a spectrophotometer at 450/550 nm (BMG Labtech, Cary, NC, USA). In some experiments, ECFC were cultured in sealed chamber with an environmental oxygen concentration of 1% (ProOx 110; BioSpherix, Parish, NY, USA). Vessel-Like Network Formation The formation of closed vessel-like networks was assessed in  NF1 KD and Scr ECFC in response to VEGF as previously described.  Briefly, 96-well plates were coated with 30 μL Matrigel (Corning, NY, USA) and ECFC were seeded at a density of 10,000 cells per well. Cells were observed every 4 hours using an inverted microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY, USA). and three uniform ×40 high-power images were captured for each well. The number of intact vessel-like networks were counted and averaged per ×20 high-power field. 16 Animals All experiments were approved by the Institutional Committee for Animal Use in Research and Education and conformed to the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research.  Nf1  mice were obtained from Tyler Jacks (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA) and backcrossed 13 generations into the C57BL/6J strain.  +/– Nf1  mice were obtained from Luis Parada (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA) and maintained on C57BL/6J background. Tie2cre (4128) and VE-cadherin cre (VEcre, 6137) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and maintained on C57BL/6J background.  flox/flox Nf1  mice were crossed with Tie2cre or VEcre mice to generate  flox/flox Nf1 ;Tie2cre or  flox/+ Nf1 ;VEcre and  flox/+ Nf1  (control) mice.  flox /+ Cre -mediated recombination was confirmed by PCR as previously described. 17 Matrigel Plug Assay Matrigel plugs were incubated with VEGF in the presence or absence of wortmannin and inserted into wild-type (WT) and  Nf1 +/−  mice as previously described.  Concentrated Matrigel (Corning) was diluted and mixed with VEGF (100 ng/mL) 18 +/−  wortmannin (25 nM) on ice. WT and  Nf1 +/−  mice were anesthetized via inhalation of isoflurane (2%)/oxygen (98%) mixture. An equal volume of Matrigel was then injected slowly into the subcutaneous layer on the abdomen of WT and  Nf1 +/−  mice. Ten days after Matrigel insertion, animals were killed and Matrigel plugs were harvested for analysis. Matrigel plugs were photographed using a digital camera (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), fixed in paraformaldehyde, and labeled with FITC anti-CD31 antibody. Digital images were obtained using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 Imaging System. Six mice per condition were used. Endothelial Cell Outgrowth From Aortic Rings Thoracic aortas were isolated from WT and  Nf1 +/−  mice, removed of periadventicial fat, and cut into 1-mm rings. Three aortic rings from each animal were transferred to 24-well collagen-coated plate and maintained in optimized HMVEC growth media. Culture media was supplemented with 100 ng/mL of VEGF (Sigma) and endothelial cell outgrowth was monitored every other day for 12 days. Aortic rings were photographed using an inverted microscope with non–phase contrast optics at day 12 and the number of cells per image was quantified by a blinded observer and averaged for each animal. For some experiments, wortmannin (25 nM) was added to the aortic rings. Aortic rings from three animals per condition were used. Oxygen-Induced Retinopathy Retinopathy was induced in newborn C57Bl/6 mice as previously described by Smith et al.  On postnatal day 7 (P7), dams and pups were placed in a sealed chamber in which the oxygen concentration was maintained at 75% oxygen. At P12, animals were transferred back to cages maintained in normoxia (21%). Room temperature was maintained on a 12-hour light/dark cycle. Newborn pups and dams were provided standard chow and water ad libitum. Six to seven pups per litter were used for all experiments. 19 Analysis of Vessel Dropout and Neovascularization Animals were killed on P17 and eyeballs were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for analysis. Following fixation, retinas were isolated, washed in PBS, and retinal flatmounts prepared. Retinal tissue was permeablized in 10% Triton X-100 (Sigma) and incubated with isolectin GS-1B 4  Alexa Fluor 594 (Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) in the dark overnight at 4°C. Retinas were placed on glass slides, incubated in Vectashield mounting media (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA, USA) and digital images were acquired using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 Imaging System. Digital images were assembled using Photoshop (Adobe Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) for further analysis. Central vessel dropout area was quantified from the digital images using the ImageJ software ( http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/ ; provided in the public domain by the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) and neovascular area was determined using the Swift_NV macro for ImageJ.  Branching was also determined by counting terminal cells proximal to the central vessel dropout zone. 20 Statistical Analysis The results of cell culture experiments are presented as mean ± SEM. Vessel dropout, neovascular area, and branching are presented as mean ± SD. Endothelial cell BrdU incorporation, vessel-like network formation, vessel dropout, neovascular area, and branching were compared by two-way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test for multiple comparisons.

PMID:15623944,DNA ploidy and chromosome (FISH) pattern analysis of peripheral nerve sheath tumors.,"BACKGROUND AND METHODS: 44 peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNST) (27 schwannomas, 9 neurofibromas and 8 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST)) were analyzed to determine DNA ploidy pattern and to clarify the conflicting data in the literature concerning this topic (whether benign PNSTs are aneuploid or not). For further insight we analyzed 6 schwannomas, one atypical neurofibroma and five MPNSTs by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique using centromeric chromosome probes (7, 17 and 18) and automatic image analysis station, Metafer 4. RESULTS: Benign schwannomas (including the problematic variants as ancient, cellular, neuroblastoma like and multiplex schwannomas) could be characterized by euploid-polyploidisation and by their 4c peak height value which was usually more than 10% of total cell number measured. These characters were not found among neurofibromas and MPNST-s. FISH analysis revealed and confirmed that the 'normal' euploid-polyploid cells are mainly eusomic-polysomic containing two, four, eight or sixteen signals for each chromosomes examined, but in a small proportion aneusomy was found among tumor cells of benign schwannomas (average: 2.58; range 1.33-3.44). In contrast, the atypical neurofibroma displayed marked aneusomy (18.44%) but it contained normal eusomic and polysomic cells too. Two diploid MPNSTs proved to be clearly aneusomic with trisomy of chromosome 17 and monosomy of chromosome 18. CONCLUSIONS: All these data suggest that ploidy pattern determination combined with FISH analysis may be a very useful supplementary tool for making a right diagnosis (to differentiate benign versus malignant schwannomas in problematic variants) and to understand better the malignant transformation in PNSTs.",,Anett Hruska; Reinhard Bollmann; Rita Beáta Kovács; Magdolna Bollmann; Miklós Bodó; Zoltán Sápi,Cellular oncology : the official journal of the International Society for Cellular Oncology,2004,10.1155/2004/406591,abstract_only,False
PMID:26822862,Capturing the wide variety of impaired fracture healing phenotypes in Neurofibromatosis Type 1 with eight key factors: a computational study.,"Congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia (CPT) is a rare disease which normally presents itself during early childhood by anterolateral bowing of the tibia and spontaneous tibial fractures. Although the exact etiology of CPT is highly debated, 40-80% of CPT patients are carriers of a mutation in the Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) gene, which can potentially result in an altered phenotype of the skeletal cells and impaired bone healing. In this study we use a computational model of bone regeneration to examine the effect of the Nf1 mutation on bone fracture healing by altering the parameter values of eight key factors which describe the aberrant cellular behaviour of Nf1 haploinsufficient and Nf1 bi-allelically inactivated cells. We show that the computational model is able to predict the formation of a hamartoma as well as a wide variety of CPT phenotypes through different combinations of altered parameter values. A sensitivity analysis by ""Design of Experiments"" identified the impaired endochondral ossification process and increased infiltration of fibroblastic cells as key contributors to the degree of severity of CPT. Hence, the computational model results have added credibility to the experimental hypothesis of a genetic cause (i.e. Nf1 mutation) for CPT.","Materials and Methods The multiscale computational model of bone regeneration was established previously and has been described in detail elsewhere 14 17 . In brief, at the tissue level the various key processes of bone regeneration are captured with 10 partial differential equations (PDEs) of the taxis-reaction-diffusion type which describe the evolution in time and space of the mesenchymal stem cell density ( c ), fibroblast density ( m c ), chondrocyte density ( f c ), osteoblast density ( c c ), fibrous matrix density ( b m ), cartilaginous matrix density ( f m ), bone matrix density ( c m ), generic osteochondrogenic growth factor concentration ( b g ), vascular growth factor concentration ( bc g ) and oxygen tension ( v n ). Note that only one generic osteochondrogenic growth factor ( g ) is included, which represents the effect of multiple growth factors present in the fracture callus. The influence of this generic growth factor on differentiation is either chondrogenic or osteogenic depending on the local oxygen tension. bc The formation of the blood vessel network is modelled at the level of the individual endothelial cell with a discrete agent-based approach. The computational model includes three different processes that determine the development of the discrete vascular tree, i.e. sprouting (the formation of a new branch, headed by a “tip cell” or “leader cell”), vascular growth (the extension of the branch due to the growth of “stalk cells” or “follower cells”) and anastomosis (the fusion of two branches). The sprouting behaviour of the endothelial cells is derived from the agent-based model of Bentley  et al. 18  and is captured with eight intracellular variables, which are unique to every endothelial cell ( Fig. 1B ). The growth of a blood vessel is modelled by computing the movement of the corresponding tip cell where the tip cell speed depends on the active VEGFR-2 concentration and the tip cell direction is influenced by chemotactic (angiogenic growth factor) and haptotactic (collagen fibres in the extracellular matrix) signals. When a tip cell encounters another blood vessel or when it migrates outside the geometrical domain (illustrated in  Fig. 1C–D ), an anastomosis is formed during which the leading endothelial cell loses its tip cell phenotype. The newly established connection between the vessels allows for blood flow and the delivery of oxygen and nutrients. Only the endothelial cells that are part of a vascular loop are sources of oxygen. The geometrical domain of the computational model is deduced from the real callus geometry at three weeks post-fracture in a standardised femoral rat fracture model 19 . We assume a simplified axisymmetrical representation of the geometry so that only a quarter of the domain is simulated ( Fig. 1C–D ). The parameter values are derived from extensive literature reviews where possible and estimated if no relevant data was available 13 14 15 16 . Both the model variables and the parameter values were non-dimensionalised using proper scaling factors and will be described in their non-dimensionalised form throughout this work 13 14 15 16 . After non-dimensionalisation, the system was also complemented by suitable initial and boundary conditions to ensure the existence, uniqueness and non-negativity of the solution ( Fig. 1D ). To examine the effect of the  Nf1  mutation on bone fracture healing, the parameter values of the factors describing the aberrant cellular behaviour of  Nf1  haploinsufficient and  Nf1  bi-allelically inactivated cells were altered ( Table 1 ). A wide range of parameter values (Nf1 range) was investigated to account for the variable proportion of  Nf1  haploinsufficient and  Nf1  bi-allelically inactivated cells in the pseudarthrosis region. In particular, a larger deviation of the parameter values from the normal case represents a higher proportion of bi-allelically inactivated cells. In the current study we have investigated the influence of eight factors described in the literature as contributors to the poor fracture healing outcome in CPT. These factors include the increased invasion of fibrous lesion cells ( c ) f,BC 1 , increased fibroblastic proliferation ( A ) f 0 1 , increased fibroblastic differentiation ( F 4 ) 23 , reduced osteogenic differentiation ( Y 11 ) 1 9 , reduced endochondral ossification ( Y 3 ) ,cb 1 , reduced cartilage formation ( P ) mc 1 , increased fibrous tissue formation ( P ) mf 23  and increased angiogenic growth factor production ( G ) gvc 1 10 . In order to determine the (relative) importance of the eight factors listed in  Table 1 , a large sensitivity analysis using “Design of Experiments” (DOE) was conducted 24 25 . DOE (or experimental design) is a statistical tool that generates an array of combinations of different parameter values within a predefined parameter space. Next, the computer simulations were performed with these parameter combinations, utilizing high-performance computational resources provided by the VSC (Flemish Supercomputer Center). Finally the results were statistically analysed. Since the computational model of bone regeneration is highly non-linear and uniform designs also cope well with the addition and removal of runs, a uniform design was chosen for the sensitivity analysis. The parameter space ( Table 1 , Nf1 range) was determined by varying the parameter values of the eight factors mostly in one direction with respect to the normal case, in this way biasing the DOE design to a CPT phenotype. Using the parameter ranges listed in  Table 1  (Nf1 range), a uniform design with 200 runs, i.e. 200 parameter combinations, was generated (see also  supplementary material ). The space-filling design evenly spreads out the parameter combinations over the eight-dimensional parameter space which can be checked with scatterplots and histograms ( Fig. 2 ). The responses (i.e. model outcomes) that were studied in the sensitivity analysis are listed in  Table 2  (see also  supplementary material ). In order to calculate the tissue fractions, the spatial images were first made binary using tissue-specific thresholds (0 means that the tissue is not present and 1 means that the tissue is present in a grid cell). Subsequently, an equal weight was assigned to the different tissues, i.e. if a grid cell contained three tissues, the area of that grid cell was divided by three in the final calculations of the tissue (area) fractions. Since a pseudarthrosis is defined by the tissues present in the fracture gap area (1a-2-3a in  Fig. 1D ), all the responses were calculated for this area. An additional response “CI” (complication index) was introduced to assess the degree of severity of CPT (Equation  1 ). More specifically, the CI ( ) combines two continuous responses (i.e. the amount of fibrous tissue   and fibroblasts  , each varying between 0 and 1 for a low and high amount respectively) with a Boolean response   (i.e. bony union or non-union represented by 0 or 1 respectively): A typical parameter combination for which the value of the CI is small is one or which the degree of severity of CPT is small, or in other words, when the fracture healing proceeds fairly normally. Conversely, a typical parameter combination for which the value of the CI is large, is one for which the degree of severity of CPT is large, or in other words, when the fracture healing is severely impaired. The uniform designs were generated and analysed with JMP (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA) using a Gaussian process with a Gaussian covariance function. Unlike an ANOVA-type of analysis, Gaussian processes do not only estimate the importance of individual parameters, but also the influence of the parameters on the outcome of a model. Hence, a Gaussian process will determine the best-fitting statistical model that can predict the model outcome for a certain combination of input parameters ( Figs 3 ,  4 ,  5 ). Since the result of a Gaussian process is a statistical model, care should be taken when interpreting the predictions. In order to assess the accuracy of the statistical predictions an actual versus predicted plot generated by JMP is helpful. In this plot the actual results, i.e. the outcomes calculated by the computational model, are compared with those predicted by the statistical model ( Fig. 3 ). In a perfect statistical fit, all the points would be located on a 45-degree line.  Fig. 3  (left) shows that the statistical model predicts a good fit for the CI response on Day 7. However, the Gaussian model does not capture the number of fibroblasts on Day 7 well, as illustrated by the large deviations from the 45-degree line in  Fig. 3  (right). Since the statistical predictions are accurate for all outcomes except the number of fibroblasts on Day 7 and Day 21 (results not shown), the results on the number of fibroblasts on Day 7 and Day 21 will not be used for further interpretation.",A Carlier; H Brems; J M A Ashbourn; I Nica; E Legius; L Geris,Scientific reports,2016-01-29,10.1038/srep20010,minimal,True
PMID:36890585,Neurofibromatosis type 1-dependent alterations in mouse microglia function are not cell-intrinsic.,"We previously discovered a sex-by-genotype defect in microglia function using a heterozygous germline knockout mouse model of Neurofibromatosis type 1 (Nf1 ± mice), in which only microglia from male Nf1 ± mice exhibited defects in purinergic signaling. Herein, we leveraged an unbiased proteomic approach to demonstrate that male, but not female, heterozygous Nf1 ± microglia exhibit differences in protein expression, which largely reflect pathways involved in cytoskeletal organization. In keeping with these predicted defects in cytoskeletal function, only male Nf1 ± microglia had reduced process arborization and surveillance capacity. To determine whether these microglial defects were cell autonomous or reflected adaptive responses to Nf1 heterozygosity in other cells in the brain, we generated conditional microglia Nf1-mutant knockout mice by intercrossing Nf1","Materials and methods Ethics statement All procedures involving the handling of living mice were performed in strict accordance with the German Animal Protection Law, and were approved by the Regional Office for Health and Social Services in Berlin (Landesamt für Gesundheit und Soziales, Berlin, Germany, Permit Number G0164/19, X9005/18, A0376/17). Adult mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation or by transcardial perfusion of PBS or PFA after intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (Narcoren, Merial GmbH, Hallbergmoos, Germany). All efforts were made to minimize suffering. Similarly, all mice used at Washington University were performed under an approved Animal Studies protocol. Mice Wild type and  Nf1  ± [ 5 ] mice used in this study were either bred onto a wild type or MacGreen (Csf1r-eGFP; [ 58 ] C57/BL6 background. Conditional microglia-specific  Nf1  ± mice: CX3CR1-Cre ER  [ 71 ] were intercrossed with  Nf1 flox/flox  [ 1 ] and R26R-EYFP mice [ 63 ] to generate litters heterozygous for Cre ER  expression from the CX3CR1 locus, a conditional (flox)  Nf1  allele and a conditional (LoxP-stop-LoxP; LSL) eYFP transgene in the Rosa26 locus ( Nf1 flox/wt ; Cx3cr1-Cre ER ; LSL-eYFP mice; termed  Nf1 flox/wt CX3CR1-Cre ER  mice).

Wild type ( Nf1 wt/wt ; Cx3cr1-Cre ER ; LSL-eYFP mice; termed WT) mice had the same genotype with the exception that they had no  Nf1 flox  allele. Conditional non-microglia-specific  Nf1  ± mice: hGFAP-Cre +/+  were intercrossed with  Nf1 flox/flox  [ 1 ] to generate litters heterozygous for Cre ER  expression from the GFAP locus and a conditional (flox)  Nf1  allele ( Nf1 flox/wt ; hGFAP-Cre; termed  Nf1 flox/wt ; hGFAP-Cre mice). Wild type ( Nf1 wt/wt ; hGFAP-Cre; termed WT) mice had the same genotype with the exception that they had no  Nf1 flox  allele. All mice were maintained under a 12 h/12 h dark–light cycle with food and water supply ad libitum, in accordance with German laws and IACUC recommendations (U.S.A.) for animal protection. All data in the current study are from 12–16 week old mice. Sexes and genotypes are indicated. Immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy Mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital (Narcoren, Merial Hallbergmoos, Germany) and transcardially perfused with phosphate buffered salt solution (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, decapitated and sectioned in the sagittal plane at 40 μm thickness using a sliding microtome (Leica SM2000 R, Leica Biosystems GmbH, Nussloch, Germany). Free-floating 40 μm sections were incubated in 5% donkey serum (EMD Millipore Corp., Burlington, Massachusetts, USA) and 0.1% Triton-X (Carl Roth®, Karlsruhe, Germany) in Tris-buffered saline solution (TBSplus) together with the primary antibodies over-night at 4 °C. The following primary antibodies were used: goat monoclonal Iba-1 antibody targeting microglia (1:300; Abcam, Cambridge, UK); chicken polyclonal GFP antibody targeting eYFP (1:250; Abcam, Cambridge, UK); mouse anti-NeuN targeting neurons (1:00; Synaptic Systems). After washing, secondary antibodies were prepared in TBSplus. Iba-1 was visualized with donkey anti-goat IgG conjugated with Cy5 or Alexa488 fluorophores (both 1:200; Dianova, Hamburg, Germany); eYFP was visualized with donkey anti-chicken IgY conjugated with Alexa488 or Cy5 (both 1:200; Dianova), NeuN with donkey anti-mouse IgG (H + L) conjugated with Cy3 (1:200; Dianova). Sections were incubated with secondary antibodies at room temperature for 2 h and then mounted on glass slides with Aqua Polymount mounting medium (Polysciences Europe GmbH, Hirschberg an der Bergstraße, Germany). Cell nuclei were stained using 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1:500; Dianova) before mounting. Images were acquired with either a Zeiss LSM700 (inverse) or a Leica SPE (upright; Leica Biosystems GmbH, Nussloch, Germany) using 40X oil immersion objectives. Z-stacks were taken at 1 μm z-step size, 35 steps to cover the whole thickness of the slice. Morphological analysis Morphological analysis of microglia was performed on 3-dimensional fluorescence images using Imaris × 64 version 9.6–9.9 (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland) algorithms. Microglial cells in which the nucleus was at least 15 µm away from the image border were selected for analysis. The modules ""Filament tracer"" and ""Surface"" were used for microglia reconstruction. A total of 50 cells from 3 different mice were analyzed for each group. The background was minimized with an appropriate filter width (20–40 µm) and the region of the analyzed cell was selected manually. The parameters Filament Length, Filament No, Dendrite Branch Pts, Filament No, Sholl Intersections, and Soma Volume were obtained from the specific values calculated by Imaris. Although tracing was performed automatically by the algorithm, we individually verified that processes originated from one defined cell. False connections were removed manually which were commonly less than 1%. The number of Sholl intersections was defined as the number of process intersecting concentric spheres, defining the spatial distribution of segments as a function of distance from the soma (Sholl analysis). All spheres have their center at the soma (beginning point) with a 5 µm step resolution for the spheres. Acute brain slice preparation Acute cortical brain slices were prepared as previously described [ 4 ]. In brief, mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation, and their brains removed and cooled in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing (in mM): 230 Sucrose, 2.5 KCl, 10 MgSO 4 , 0.5 CaCl 2 , 1.25 NaH 2 PO 4 , 26 NaHCO 3 , and 10 D-glucose, pH 7.4; gassed with 95% O 2 / 5% CO 2 . Brains were then mounted on a vibratome (HM650V, Thermo Scientific, Massachusetts, USA), and 250 µm thick coronal brain slices were generated and kept at room temperature for experiments for up to 5 h in gassed ACSF containing (in mM): 134 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.3 MgCl 2 , 2 CaCl 2 , 1.26 K 2 HPO 4 , 26 NaHCO 3 , and 10 D-glucose (pH 7.4). Acute brain slices were used for patch clamp recordings and in situ 2-photon live-cell imaging. Two-photon imaging and laser lesioning Live imaging of microglial processes was performed on 250 µm coronal brain slices from  Nf1  ± or  Nf1 flox/wt mice and their WT littermates using a custom-built two-photon laser-scanning microscope (Till Photonics, Gräfelfing, Germany). EGFP or eYFP was excited by a Chameleon Ultra II laser (Coherent, Dieburg, Germany) at a wavelength of 940 nm. A 40X water-immersion objective (NA 0.8, Olympus, Hamburg, Germany) was used, with scanned 60 µm thick z-stacks and a step size of 3 µm covering a field of 320 × 320 µm. Laser lesions were set to 40 µm under the slice surface in the cortex by focusing the laser beam, set to a wavelength of 810 nm and to maximum power in the selected imaging volume, and scanned until autofluorescence of the injured tissue was visible. This procedure resulted in lesions of ~ 20 µm in diameter in the middle of the observed region. For the recording of microglia surveillance, no laser lesion was performed. IGOR Pro 6.37 (Lake Oswego, USA) was used for data analysis as in Davalos et al. [ 13 ] and Madry et al. [ 42 ]. The sequences of 3D image stacks were converted into sequences of 2D images by a maximum intensity projection algorithm. Grayscale images were first converted into binary form using a threshold. For quantification of laser lesion-induced movements, microglial response to focal lesion was defined as EGFP + pixel count in a proximal circular region 45 µm around the lesion site over time (Rx(t)). Distal fluorescence of the first time point was determined within a diameter of 45 µm to 90 µm around the lesion site for normalization (Ry(0)). Microglial responses were represented as R(t) = (Rx(t)-Rx(0))/Ry(0). For the quantification of baseline surveillance, cells of interest were individually selected by manually drawing a region of interest (ROI) around an area including all their process extensions throughout the 20 min movie and erasing data around that ROI. Starting with the second frame, we subtracted from each binarized frame the preceding frame and counted the number of pixels < 0 (retracting = PR) and > 0 (extending = PE). The surveillance index for each frame is then given by the sum of PR ad PE. The surveillance index of a given cell was then calculated by averaging the indices of the first 20 images in the movie. For ramification index (RI), we used the equation RI = (peri/area)/(2*sqrt(pi/area)), where peri and area are respectively the perimeter and area of a given cell in pixels. For the quantification of these two parameters, the ImageAnalyzeParticles operation in IGOR Pro 6.37 was applied on binarized images in which all analyzed microglia were manually examined and, if necessary, somata and processes connected. Electrophysiological recordings A conventional patch-clamp amplifier was used (EPC9, HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany). Acute 250 µm coronal brain slices were prepared from  Nf1 flox/wt  and WT mice, and microglial cells were identified by their transgenic EYFP fluorescence on an epifluorescent microscope. Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glasses and had resistances of 4—6 MOhm. The following intracellular solution was used (in mM): KCl, 130; MgCl 2 , 2; CaCl 2 , 0.5; Na-ATP, 2; EGTA, 5; HEPES, 10 and sulforhodamine 101, 0.01 (Sigma Aldrich,) and had an osmolarity of 280—290 mOsm/L adjusted to a pH of 7.3 with KOH. The extracellular solution contained (in mM): NaCl, 134; KCl, 2.5; MgCl 2 , 1.3; CaCl 2 , 2; K 2 HPO 4 , 1.25; NaHCO 3 , 26; D-glucose, 10; pH 7.4; 310—320 mOsm/L and was gassed with carbogen (95% O 2 / 5% CO 2 ). Experiments with series resistances less than ~ 65 MOhm were used for data analysis. All experiments were performed in the voltage-clamp configuration. To obtain current–voltage curves during continuous recordings, the membrane was clamped every 5 s from a holding potential of -70 or -20 mV (before and during the ATP response, respectively) to a series of de- and hyperpolarizing voltages ranging from -140 mV to 60 mV with 20 mV increment, 100 ms in duration. Membrane currents were averaged for quantification between 30 and 45 ms after clamping the membrane to a given value from the resting potential. Membrane capacitance was quantified based on an exponential fit of the current decay in response to a -10 mV test pulse. The same pulse was used to quantify series resistance from the peak amplitude of the membrane capacitance currents. Comparisons of membrane currents between different groups were always normalized to the membrane capacitance. Microglia isolation by MACS 12–16 week male and female mice were transcardially perfused with ice-cold Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) to harvest the brain. Brains were subsequently homogenized at 0–4 °C in dissection buffer (HBSS, 45% glucose, 1 M HEPES) and cell pellets were resuspended in 25 ml of 22% Percoll (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). 5 ml PBS were added as a layer on top. Centrifugation was performed for 20 min at 950 g with medium acceleration and no brakes to remove myelin and debris. Pellets were resuspended in ice-cold MACS buffer and incubated with anti-mouse CD11b antibodies coupled to magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) for 15 min at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in MACS buffer and passed through medium-sized MACS columns (Miltenyi Biotech) attached to a magnet. The flow-through was discarded and the cells were flushed out of the columns in MACS buffer, collected by centrifugation, and stored at −80 °C for cAMP ELISA. Mass spectrometry and proteomic analysis Global proteome analysis was conducted using isobaric TMTpro 16-plex labeling (Thermo Fisher Scientific) essentially as described in Mertins et al. [ 46 ]. Samples were lysed in urea buffer and digested with trypsin (Promega). Of each sample, 12 µg peptide was assigned to channels 1 through 13 as well as channel 15 in a randomized fashion. Channel 16 was used as a booster channel and loaded with 70 µg of a mix of the remaining peptide material. Channel 14 was kept empty. The combined TMT cassette was deeply fractionated using high-pH HPLC separation into 30 fractions using a 1290 Infinity II LC System (Agilent Technologies). An estimate of 1 µg of each fraction was injected into LC–MS analysis on an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in data-dependent mode using a 110 min gradient on an EASY-nLC 1200 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with an in-house packed column (C18-AQ 1.9 µm beads,Dr. Maisch Reprosil-Pur 120). For database search, MaxQuant version 1.6.10.43 [ 12 ] was used whilst enabling TMTpro 16-plex reporter ion quantitation with a PIF setting of 0.5. Downstream analysis was done in R. For quantitation, a complete data matrix was required for the experimental conditions (14 out of 16 channels). Reporter ion intensities were normalized and scaled using median-MAD normalization.. For significance calling two-sample moderated t-tests were applied (limma R package; [ 56 ]. P-values were adjusted using the Benjamini–Hochberg method. Statistics All data are expressed as mean ± SEM. A combination of one-way ANOVA tests with Bonferroni post hoc tests were employed using Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) to compare data between the four experimental groups.

PMID:25549701,Exome sequencing on malignant meningiomas identified mutations in neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) and meningioma 1 (MN1) genes.,"BACKGROUND: Meningiomas are tumors originating from the membranous layers surrounding the central nervous system, and are generally regarded as ""benign"" tumors of the brain. Malignant meningiomas are rare and are typically associated with a higher risk of local tumor recurrence and a poorer prognosis (median survival time <2 years). Previous genome-wide association studies and exome sequencing studies have identified genes that play a role in susceptibility to meningiomas, but these studies did not focus specifically on malignant tumors. METHODS: We performed exome sequencing on five malignant meningiomas on the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform using Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon kits. We used wANNOVAR web server to annotate and prioritize variants, identified candidate genes with recurrent mutations, and validated selected mutations by Sanger sequencing. We next designed custom NimbleGen targeted region arrays on five candidate genes, and sequenced four additional malignant meningiomas. RESULTS: From exome sequencing data, we identified several frequently mutated genes including NF2, MN1, ARID1B, SEMA4D, and MUC2, with private mutations in tumors. We sequenced these genes in four additional samples and identified potential driver mutations in NF2 (neurofibromatosis type 2) and MN1 (meningioma 1). CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that mutations in NF2 may play a role in progression of meningiomas, and nominated MN1 as a candidate gene for malignant transformation of meningiomas. Our sample size is limited by the extreme rarity of malignant meningiomas, but our study represents one of the first sequencing studies focusing on the malignant subtype.","Methods We performed exome sequencing on five malignant meningiomas on the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform using Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon kits. We used wANNOVAR web server to annotate and prioritize variants, identified candidate genes with recurrent mutations, and validated selected mutations by Sanger sequencing. We next designed custom NimbleGen targeted region arrays on five candidate genes, and sequenced four additional malignant meningiomas. Materials and Methods Patient samples After evaluating detailed history of pathology, availability of tissue specimens, and availability of high-quality DNAs, our study included nine patients with malignant meningiomas, including four males and five females. All enrolled patients in the registry came from Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center with written informed consents. Demographic and baseline clinical characteristics of these patients were examined manually and were shown in  Table 1 . Library preparation DNA samples were extracted from the tumor FFPE slides from these patients using QIAamp DNA FFPE kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the standard protocol. Samples with main DNA fragment larger than 250 bp were chosen for constructing exome sequencing library. For each sample, 2 μg purified genomic DNA was extracted and randomly fragmented using Covaris E210 to generate DNA fragments around 200 to 300 bp and then validated using 2% agarose gel. Next, we purified DNA fragments using AMpure XP beads (Beckman, Brea, CA, USA). The fragmented DNA was treated with T4 polynucleotide kinase, T4 DNA polymerase, and Klenow fragment with dNTPs to create phosphorylated blunt termini. Then the end-repaired DNA fragments were incubated with Klenow fragment exo- and dATP to create 3′ over-hangs and were ligated to synthetic general adaptors. Adaptor ligated-DNA fragments were amplified by ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (LM-PCR) and purified using AMpure XP beads. PCR products from Patients 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were hybridized to the Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon array ( http://www.genomics.agilent.com/en/SureSelect-DNA-RNA/SureSelect-Human-All-Exon-Kits/?cid=AG-PT-177&tabId=AG-PR-1204 ) to prepare for exome sequencing of these 5 patients. As for the other 4 patients, we applied purified PCR product to NimbleGen targeted region array (see below) for enrichment to prepare for targeted region sequencing. Both non-captured and captured LM-PCR products were subjected to quantitative PCR to estimate the magnitude of enrichment. At last, the captured DNA was amplified to create enough fragments for sequencing. Exome sequencing Each captured library by Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon array was loaded on Hiseq2000 platform for sequencing. High-throughput sequencing was performed and the raw image files were processed by Illumina base calling software 1.7 for base calling with default parameters and the sequences of each library are generated as 90 bp paired-end reads. Adequate depth and coverage was achieved for each sample and therefore data from all five samples were used for further analysis. Candidate region sequencing As for candidate region sequencing of the five candidate genes, we designed the candidate region array using NimbleGen Design ( http://www.nimblegen.com/products/nimbledesign/index.html ), with following parameters: Preferred Close Matches-3, Maximum Close Matches-4, and final Target Bases Covered being 90.9%. We obtained the following candidate region: 29985287-30108845 and 28136281-28205468 for chromosome 22, 157034136-157596839 for chromosome 6, 91957869-92112446 for chromosome 9, and 1070443-1108847 for chromosome 11. Next, similar as before, we subjected each library captured by NimbleGen targeted region arrays to Hiseq2000 platform for sequencing. High-throughput sequencing was performed and the raw image files were processed by Illumina base calling software 1.7 for base calling with default parameters and the sequences of each library are generated as 90 bp paired-end reads. Adequate depth and coverage was achieved for each sample and therefore data from all four samples were used for further analysis. Variant calling We used SeqMule ( http://seqmule.usc.edu/ ) pipeline as our primary variant calling pipeline. In SeqMule pipeline, BWA ( Li and Durbin, 2009 ) was used for sequence alignment and GATK ( McKenna  ) and SAMtools ( et al. , 2010 Li  ) were used to generate variant calls and to identify consensus calls for analysis. For further comparison between various variant-calling tools, such as SOAPsnp/SOAPindel, VarScan2 ( et al. , 2009 Koboldt  ), and SAMtools, we used variants from five candidate genes from five exome-sequenced patients as benchmarking data and generated variants from SOAPsnp/SOAPindel, VarScan2, GATK and SAMtools, respectively. et al. , 2012 On the other hand, we decided to use VarScan2 as our primary variant calling tools for targeted region sequencing data analysis given sufficient sequencing depth. Our goal is to obtain the most somatic and germline variants calling from these cancer tissues because we are not only interested in the overlapped variants from exome sequencing but also in additional variants that occurred in these genes. Therefore, for this deeply sequenced data on which most pipelines can generate reliable variant calls, we chose VarScan2 as it is widely used in cancer mutation identification and that it is more sensitive for somatic mutations. Mutation annotation We used wANNOVAR web server at University of Southern California ( http://wannovar.usc.edu/ ) to annotate all the mutations ( Chang and Wang, 2012 ;  Wang  ). wANNOVAR server provides an easy-to-use interface to help researchers filter down variants, and judge the deleteriousness of variants using multiple sources of information, such as SIFT ( et al. , 2010 Kumar  ), PolyPhen-2 ( et al. , 2009 Adzhubei  ), and LRT ( et al. , 2010 Chun and Fay, 2009 ) scores. Given the lack of paired normal tissues, we applied two filtering processes to sift for potential novel somatic mutations occurred in our patients. First, to filter for rare novel mutations and thus can potentially be somatic mutations, we discarded all mutations with Minor Allele Frequency (MAF) strictly greater than 0.001 from 1000 Genomes Project and NHLBI-ESP data on 6,500 exomes, and required the remaining mutations to be absent in dbSNP Build 138 and in 46 unrelated individuals from Complete Genomics, using wANNOVAR with corresponding filtering options. Second, given that our patients were all from Chinese population, which was less represented in these aforementioned databases, to filter for novel somatic mutations specific to Chinese population, we also obtained mutations from a recently published exome-sequencing project on around 1,000 Chinese people and checked the existence and allele frequencies of all remaining mutations in the five frequently mutated genes and in TRAF7. Sanger validation All candidate point mutations identified from exome sequencing were chosen for Sanger validation. Genomic sequences around each candidate mutations were obtained from NCBI. Twelve pairs of primers were designed using primer 3 (v. 0.4.0) ( http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/ ). Next, we subjected DNA samples of all five patients to PCR using these 12 pairs of primers to validate all candidate mutations. The PCR mixture contained 5 μl of 10X AccuPrime™ PCR Buffer, 0.3 μl of AccuPrime™ Taq High Fidelit, 2 μl of 10 μM forward primer, 2 μl of 10 μM reverse primer, and 10 ng of template DNA, resulting in final volume of 50 μl. All PCR were performed under following conditions: 2 minutes at 94°C; 20 cycles of 20 seconds at 94°C and 30 seconds at 60°C (−0.5°C each cycle) and 1 minute at 70°C; 20 cycles of 20 seconds at 94°C and 30 seconds at 50°C and 1 minute at 70°C; and 7 minutes at 70°C. After amplification of DNA sequence, we performed Sanger Sequencing of all 5 samples. The sequencing traces were manually visualized in Codon Code Aligner software ( http://www.codoncode.com/aligner/ ) to confirm the presence of candidate mutations.",Xu Zhang; Haiying Jia; Yao Lu; Chengliang Dong; Jinghui Hou; Zheng Wang; Feng Wang; Hongbin Zhong; Lin Wang; Kai Wang,Discovery medicine,2014-12,,minimal,True

PMID:27458360,COMT Val(158)Met Polymorphism Is Associated with Verbal Working Memory in Neurofibromatosis Type 1.,"Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is a neurogenetic disease marked by multiple cognitive and learning problems. Genetic variants may account for phenotypic variance in NF1. Here, we investigated the association between the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val(158)Met polymorphism and working memory and arithmetic performance in 50 NF1 individuals. A significant association of the COMT polymorphism was observed only with verbal working memory, as measured by the backward digit-span task with an advantageous performance for Met/Met carriers. To study how genetic modifiers influence NF1 cognitive performance might be of importance to decrease the unpredictability of the cognitive profile among NF1 patients.","Methods and Procedures Participants Fifty participants with NF1 [19 subjects from 6- to 18-year-old (11.89 ± 4.11 years; 11 male) and 31 adults from 19- to 50-year-old (30.97 ± 8.81 years; 13 male)] were enrolled in this study. All individuals were recruited from a specialized clinic in neurofibromatosis at the Hospital of the Federal University of Minas Gerais. NF1 diagnosis followed the criteria specified by the  National Institutes of Health statement [NIH] (1988)  statement. Besides NF1, it was not reported by the participants or their families any history of genetic, neurological, or psychiatric disorders. This study is part of a research project that seeks to investigate molecular mechanisms of NF1 approved by the Federal University of Minas Gerais ethics committee. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants and/or from their parents according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Working Memory Assessment All participants completed the age-appropriate digit-span subtest of the Wechsler Adult and Children Intelligence Scales ( Wechsler, 2002 ,  2004 ) and the Corsi block-tapping task ( Kessels et al., 2000 ,  2008 ). Both are span tasks where the examiner presents a growing sequence of numbers (digit-span) or moves on a wooden board (Corsi block-tapping). The subject must repeat the same sequence ( forward  versions of the tasks) or say/do it from the last to the first item (a  backward  version of the tasks). For each span (starting at two items), the examiner presented two different sequences. The tasks are stopped when the subject is not able to correctly repeat two sequences of same span length. We used the product of the maximum span length and number of correct trials as test measures ( Kessels et al., 2008 ). This strategy usually produces more representative measures of working memory variability than the number of correct trials or the maximum span achieved. IQ Assessment General intellectual functioning was assessed by the third version of the Brazilian Wechsler Intelligence Scales (WAIS-III or WISC-III for adults and children, respectively;  Wechsler, 2002 ,  2004 ). School Performance Assessment We adopted the arithmetic subtest from the School Achievement Test ( Stein, 1994 ), as an objective measure of school performance. The School Achievement Test is a standard measure of academic skills including reading, writing, and arithmetic. The test was developed for the Brazilian population following the country educational agenda and have adequate normative data for grades 1–6. Participants’ scores on arithmetic were categorized in low-achievement or normal-high-achievement according to the guidelines proposed by  Oliveira-Ferreira et al. (2012)  and the total years of formal education showed by each participant. Socioeconomic Status Assessment Socioeconomic status (SES) was assessed using the Brazilian Criterion for Economic Classification (CCEB) according to the criteria established by the Brazilian Research Enterprises Association ( Associação Brasileira de Empresas de Pesquisa [ABEP], 2013 ). The CCEB estimates the purchasing power of families living in urban areas. It includes nine items that measure the available resources at home and one item that judges the education level of the householder, resulting in a scale ranging from 0 to 46 points, and segmentation into eight economic classes. These economic classes can be divided into three larger classes: “high” (A and B classes; median monthly household income from U$2349 to U$4152), “middle” (C class; median monthly household income from U$514 to U$1190) and “low” (D and E classes; median monthly household income of U$348). Eighteen NF1 participants (36%) were classified as high class, 27 (54%) as middle class, and five (10%) as low class. COMT Genotyping The polymorphism was assessed by a standard procedure previously reported ( Pereira et al., 2012 ). Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples using the high salt method ( Lahiri and Nurnberger, 1991 ). The COMT functional polymorphism (val158met,  rs4680 ) was purchased in a made-to-order from Applied Biosystems ® . Genotyping was performed using a real-time PCR system in the allelic discrimination mode (Stratagene Mx3005 – MxPro QPCR-Software, 2007) using the TaqMan Genotyping Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). PCR parameters included an initial denaturation at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 50 cycles at 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min. Each reaction contained 3.5 μl of mix, 0.1 μl of the probe, 3.4 μl of deionized water, and 1.0 μl of DNA. Researchers involved in genotyping were blind to neuropsychological results, and researchers participating in neuropsychological assessments were blind to the genotyping results. COMT genotype was coded as a categorical variable (Val/Val, Met/Val, and Met/Met) for further analysis. Statistical Procedures Most of our data was non-normally distributed. The use of data transformation procedures (square, cube, square root, and logarithm) did not succeed in normalizing the data distribution. We then adopted non-parametric tests for the following procedures. Non-parametric univariate comparisons performed by the Kruskal–Wallis tests did not show differences between age (χ 2  = 3.21,  p  = 0.201), years of formal education (χ 2  = 0.65,  p  = 0.721), SES (χ 2  = 1.03,  p  = 0.596), or intelligence (χ 2  = 1.83,  p  = 0.400) between the genotype groups. In this sense, we compared the three  COMT  genotypes (Val/Val, Val/Met, Met/Met) in the digit-span and Corsi block-tapping tasks by the same statistical procedure. To ensure results’ consistency, we analyzed the  p -values along with the effect sizes (“ r ” conversion computed by dividing the resulting “ Z ” by the square root of the total sample size). This method can be interpreted as a correlational coefficient, and effect sizes higher than 0.3 can be considered moderate and larger than 0.5 interpreted as large according to  Cohen’s (1988)  guidelines.  Post hoc  comparisons between each  COMT  genotype were corrected by the Dunn–Bonferroni method. The comparison between the two groups defined by the school achievement and the  COMT  genotype was performed by a chi-square test.

PMID:36730269,Identification of therapeutic sensitivities in a spheroid drug combination screen of Neurofibromatosis Type I associated High Grade Gliomas.,"Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) patients develop an array of benign and malignant tumors, of which Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors (MPNST) and High Grade Gliomas (HGG) have a dismal prognosis. About 15-20% of individuals with NF1 develop brain tumors and one third of these occur outside of the optic pathway. These non-optic pathway gliomas are more likely to progress to malignancy, especially in adults. Despite their low frequency, high grade gliomas have a disproportional effect on the morbidity of NF1 patients. In vitro drug combination screens have not been performed on NF1-associated HGG, hindering our ability to develop informed clinical trials. Here we present the first in vitro drug combination screen (21 compounds alone or in combination with MEK or PI3K inhibitors) on the only human NF1 patient derived HGG cell line available and on three mouse glioma cell lines derived from the NF1-P53 genetically engineered mouse model, which sporadically develop HGG. These mouse glioma cell lines were never exposed to serum, grow as spheres and express markers that are consistent with an Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cell (OPC) lineage origin. Importantly, even though the true cell of origin for HGG remains elusive, they are thought to arise from the OPC lineage. We evaluated drug sensitivities of the three murine glioma cell lines in a 3D spheroid growth assay, which more accurately reflects drug sensitivities in vivo. Excitingly, we identified six compounds targeting HDACs, BRD4, CHEK1, BMI-1, CDK1/2/5/9, and the proteasome that potently induced cell death in our NF1-associated HGG. Moreover, several of these inhibitors work synergistically with either MEK or PI3K inhibitors. This study forms the basis for further pre-clinical evaluation of promising targets, with an eventual hope to translate these to the clinic.","Material and methods Ethics statement This research was determined to be none-human subject research by the Children’s Hospital Philadelphia Committees for the Protection of Human Subjects (IRB). The need for consent was waived. Cell lines and materials The NF1 patient-derived HGG cell line TM-31 (RRID:CVCL_6735) [ 17 ], purchased from the RIKEN biorepository, is null for NF1, TP53, CDKN2A and ATRX. The Glioblastoma Multiphorme (GBM) LN319 cell line was a gift from Dr. Karen Cichowski. LN319 is an adult sporadic GBM with full inactivation of NF1. TM-31 and LN319 cells are grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM; Gibco, Life Technologies, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gemini-Bio Products, West Sacramento, CA, USA), 1% glutamax (Gibco) and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Life Technologies, NY, USA). Mouse NF1-HGG cell lines 17, 5653, and 5746 were derived from three distinct high-grade murine brain tumors sporadically developed by the NPcis genetically engineered mouse model. The germline of these mice is heterozygous for  Nf1  and  Tp53 ; mutant alleles are located in cis. The 17, 5653, and 5746 glioma cell lines are grown in NeuroCult ™  Mouse and Rat Basal Medium (NeuroCult; StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) supplemented with NeuroCult ™  Mouse and Rat Proliferation Supplement (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada), 1% Penicillin Streptomycin (P/S; Life Technologies, NY, USA), 20 ng/mL human recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF; StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) and 10 ng/mL human recombinant fibroblast growth factor (FGF; StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada). All cells are cultured at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Cell lines were transduced with Incucyte ®  Nuclight Red Lentivirus (Sartorius, Gottingen, Germany) such that they will produce an EF1α promoter driven nuclear restricted red fluorescent label (nuclear RFP) and flow sorted to select for successfully transduced cells (Sartorius, Gottingen, Germany). The following antibodies were purchased from Cell signaling Technologies: pERK (Catalogue # 4370), total ERK (Catalogue # 9102), pAKT (Catalogue # 4060), total AKT (Catalogue # 4691), Ubiquitin (Catalogue # 4289), MYC (Catalogue # 18583), pCHEK1 S296 (Catalogue # 90178), BMI1 (Catalogue # 5856), H3K27Ac (Catalogue # 8173), total H3 (Catalogue # 14269), CDK9 (Catalogue # 2316), Vinculin (Catalogue # 4650), CPNase (Catalogue # 5664) and MAG (Catalogue # 9043). Beta-Actin (Catalogue # NB600-501) was purchased from Novus, pS2 RNApol II (Catalogue # 04-1571-1) from EMD Millipore, SOX2 (Catalogue # MAB2018) from R&D systems and NG2 (Catalogue # PA5-17199) from Invitrogen. Compound used in screen All drugs and compounds were purchased from Selleckchem (Houston, TX, USA). A complete list of compound names, sources, catalogue numbers, are listed in  S1 Table . These compounds encompass a broad spectrum of molecular targets that have been implicated in cancer and are either in preclinical studies or in clinical development. Spheroid drug sensitivity assay Two thousand cells/well of 17, 5653, or 5746 glioma cell lines are plated in 96-well round-bottomed ultra-low attachment plates (MS9096UZ, S-bio, Hudson, NH) and used for spheroid drug screening. Cells are plated in 100uL of complete culture media, centrifuged (90g, 5min) and incubated overnight to stimulate a single colony from forming at the bottom of the round well. Twenty-one drugs were screened, using three concentrations (see  S2 Table , in triplicate) and prepared in NeuroCult media. All drugs were combined with DMSO, a single concentration of Trametinib (10nM), or a single concentration GDC0941 (1000nM for 17 and 5746, 500nM for 5653). For each cell line, these concentrations of Trametinib and GDC-0941 were chosen to be below the Half Maximal Inhibitory Concentration (IC50) value, in order to discern the maximum cooperativity between drug combinations. The final volume of media for each well is 150ul. Each concentration of a drug combination was evaluated in triplicate, including the DMSO controls. The total integrated intensity of RFP was monitored over the course of 72 hours, taking measurements every 2 hours with the Incucyte ®  S3 Live-Cell Analysis System (Sartorius, Gottingen, Germany) and serve as a proxy for the number of cells present. Analysis parameters are listed in  S3 Table . 2D drug sensitivity assays The TM-31 cells were plated (10,000 cells/well) in 96-well flat-bottom tissue culture treated plates (Corning 3596). Cells were plated in 100uL culture media and incubated overnight before adding drugs on Day 0. Twenty-one drugs were screened, using three concentrations (see  S2 Table , in triplicate) and prepared in DMEM media (10% FBS). All drugs were combined with DMSO, a single concentration of Trametinib (20nM), or a single concentration of GDC0941 (500nM). These concentrations of Trametinib and GDC-0941 were chosen to be below the IC50 value, in order to discern the maximum cooperativity between drug combinations. The total volume of media per well is 150ul. Each concentration of a drug combination was evaluated in triplicate, including the DMSO controls. We monitored cell numbers over the course of 72 hours, taking measurements every 2 hours with the Incucyte ®  S3 Live-Cell Analysis System (Sartorius, Gottingen, Germany). We used the Incucyte ®  S3 Live-Cell Analysis software to identify and count the number of individual cells, as defined by the number of RFP +  nuclei, across the 72 hours. Analysis parameters are listed in  S4 Table . Data analysis The log2-fold change in total integrated intensity or cell number (for 3D and 2D assays, respectively) for each time point relative to 0 hours was calculated. Drugs were considered for a broader follow-up combinatorial evaluation if our initial treatment caused more than 50% cell death in 72h (Log2 fold change value <-1) at concentrations below the maximum serum concentration that can be safely attained during pharmacokinetic drug studies for clinical trials (Cmax). These Cmax obtained from the literature (Table 2), and values were converted from mg/ml to nM. Synergy screening The synergy of drug combinations was evaluated in the mouse 5746 and TM31 glioma cell lines. The 17 glioma cell line was used for the PTC596/Trametinib combination as this combination showed limited sensitivity than the 5746 line ( S2 Table ). Cell lines were plated in 96-well plates and processed as described in the spheroid or 2D drug screening assays. We created a dilution series of our drug combinations (7 dilutions of the drug of interest, 5 dilutions of Trametinib or GDC-0941). On Day 0, Trametinib, GDC-0941, Bortezomib, Dinaciclib, JQ1, LY2606368, PTC596, or Vorinostat were added in a serial dilution per row in duplicate. We used the percent viability compared to untreated cells to calculate a synergy score for each of the analyzed combinations ( https://synergyfinder.fimm.fi/ ; parameters: LL4 curve fit, ZIP method for synergy score calculation). Statistical analysis Our initial 21 compound drug screen was performed in triplicates, the synergy study was performed in duplicates. IC50 and Lethal Dose 50 (LD50) values and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to assess drug sensitivity (GraphPad Prism 9 software) and tabulated in  Table 1 . 10.1371/journal.pone.0277305.t001 Table 1 Synergistic evaluations of drug combinations in 5746 and TM31 cell lines. 5746 Single compound Trametinib (10nM) GCD0941 (1uM) Drug Target IC50 (nM) CI LD50 (nM) CI LD50 (nM) CI Synergy LD50 (nM) CI Synergy Trametinib MEK 17 15–20 >40 NC - - - 9.6 8.8–10.6 Syn (26.1) Vorinostat HDAC 535 451–632 1217 1113–1341 733 671–804 Add (4.2) 443 415–474 Syn (12.6) JQ1 BRD4 415 385–446 >2000 NC 740 637–866 Syn (12.7) 424 399–451 Add (9.7) LY2606368 CHK1 35 29–45 >100 NC >100 NC Syn (18.0) 10.2 8.9–11.8 Syn (20.6) PTC596 BMI1 66 57–78 >500 NC 168 * 153–184 * Syn (13.9) * 129 97–172 Syn (18.8) Bortezomib proteasome 4.3 4.1–4.5 5.6 4.9–6.3 5.1 4.5–5.7 Add (0.4) 4.1 3.5–4.8 Add (1.9) Dinacicilb CDK1/2/5/9 26.4 10–30.1 25 13–40 26 22.6–32.0 Add (-3.9) 19.6 19–20 Add (6.1) TM31NR Single compound Trametinib (25nM) GCD0941 (1uM) Drug Target IC50 (nM) CI LD50 (nM) CI LD50 (nM) CI Synergy LD50 (nM) CI Synergy Trametinib MEK 78 51–139 >200 NC - - - >200 NC Add(8.5) Vorinostat HDAC 646 515–806 1973 1782–2201 1340 1087–1645 Add (1.8) 1410 969–2017 Add(2.4) JQ1 BRD4 580 418–819 >4000 NC >4000 NC Add (-5) >4000 NC Add(-0.1) LY2606368 CHK1 1.9 0.4–6.2 136 89–241 >1000 NC Ant(-12.5) 272.5 153->1000 Add(-5.1) PTC596 BMI1 38 28–50 107 85–140 95 84–108 Add(1.5) 90 81–102 Add(-1.7) Bortezomib proteasome 6.4 5.6–7.4 10.4 9.7–11.1 11.8 10.6–13.1 Add(-4) 10.2 9.7–10.6 Add(-2.5) Dinacicilb CDK1/2/5/9 9.3 5.8–14.1 25 22–30 21.7 21–22 Add(-0.8) 16.8 16–17 Add(1.4) NA: not available; IC50: 50% growth inhibition; LD50: Lethal dose 50 (50% cell death), NC: Not Calculated, Synergy: Synergy score listed between brackets, Syn: synergistic, Add: additive, Ant: antagonistic CI: Confidence interval; * Determined in mouse 17 cell line Cell line characterization and drug target inhibition studies To characterize our mouse glioma cell lines, a genotyping PCR for  Nf1  (primers: Nf1-wt-F:  GGTATTGAATTGAAGCAC , Nf1-R:  TTCAATACCTGCCCAAGG , Nf1-mut-F:  ATTCGCCAATGACAAGAC ) and  Tp53  (primers: Tp53-wt-F:  AGGCTTAGAGGTGCAAGCTG , Tp53-R:  TGGATGGTGGTATACTCAGAGC , Tp53-mut-F:  CAGCCTCTGTTCCACATACACT ) was performed [ 11 ].

Western blot was performed to evaluate the expression of OPC lineage markers and for the expression of TP53 and CDKN2A in TM-31. Target inhibition of the drugs that caused potent cell death in our glioma lines inhibited was evaluated by western blot as well.

PMID:36959711,Modeling human cancer predisposition syndromes using CRISPR/Cas9 in human cell line models.,"The advancement of CRISPR mediated gene engineering provides an opportunity to improve upon preclinical human cell line models of cancer predisposing syndromes. This review focuses on using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tools to model various human cancer predisposition syndromes. We examine the genetic mutations associated with neurofibromatosis type 1, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Gorlin syndrome, BRCA mutant breast and ovarian cancers, and APC mutant cancers. Furthermore, we discuss the possibilities of using next-generation CRISPR-derived precision gene editing tools to introduce a variety of genetic lesions into human cell lines. The goal is to improve the quality of preclinical models surrounding these cancer predisposition syndromes through dissecting the effects of these mutations on the development of cancer and to provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms of these cancer predisposition syndromes. These studies demonstrate the continued utility and improvement of CRISPR/Cas9-induced human cell line models in studying the genetic basis of cancer.",,Garrett M Draper; Daniel J Panken; David A Largaespada,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",2023-09,10.1002/gcc.23140,abstract_only,False
PMID:18923024,Tumor suppressor schwannomin/merlin is critical for the organization of Schwann cell contacts in peripheral nerves.,"Schwannomin/merlin is the product of a tumor suppressor gene mutated in neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). Although the consequences of NF2 mutations on Schwann cell proliferation are well established, the physiological role of schwannomin in differentiated cells is not known. To unravel this role, we studied peripheral nerves in mice overexpressing in Schwann cells schwannomin with a deletion occurring in NF2 patients (P0-SCH-Delta39-121) or a C-terminal deletion. The myelin sheath and nodes of Ranvier were essentially preserved in both lines. In contrast, the ultrastructural and molecular organization of contacts between Schwann cells and axons in paranodal and juxtaparanodal regions were altered, with irregular juxtaposition of normal and abnormal areas of contact. Similar but more severe alterations were observed in mice with conditional deletion of the Nf2 gene in Schwann cells. The number of Schmidt-Lanterman incisures, which are cytoplasmic channels interrupting the compact myelin and characterized by distinct autotypic contacts, was increased in the three mutant lines. P0-SCH-Delta39-121 and conditionally deleted mice displayed exuberant wrapping of nonmyelinated fibers and short internodes, an abnormality possibly related to altered control of Schwann cell proliferation. In support of this hypothesis, Schwann cell number was increased along fibers before myelination in P0-SCH-Delta39-121 mice but not in those with C-terminal deletion. Schwann cell numbers were also more numerous in mice with conditional deletion. Thus, schwannomin plays an important role in the control of Schwann cell number and is necessary for the correct organization and regulation of axoglial heterotypic and glio-glial autotypic contacts.",,Natalia Denisenko; Carmen Cifuentes-Diaz; Theano Irinopoulou; Michèle Carnaud; Evelyne Benoit; Michiko Niwa-Kawakita; Fabrice Chareyre; Marco Giovannini; Jean-Antoine Girault; Laurence Goutebroze,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2008-10-15,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2537-08.2008,abstract_only,False
PMID:23356716,Miniaturized handheld confocal microscopy identifies focal brain invasion in a mouse model of aggressive meningioma.,"Invasion of the brain parenchyma by a meningioma classified by histological criteria as World Health Organization (WHO) grade I meningioma, implies that the tumor has greater likelihood of recurrence and a biological behavior similar to the more aggressive WHO grade II meningiomas. It is therefore important to detect microscopic foci of brain invasion during surgery in order to maximize the resection and/or adapt imaging follow-up. In this study, we tested the sensitivity of two handheld confocal imaging devices to detect foci of brain invasion in two types of meningioma mouse models: in a genetically engineered mouse model and in a syngeneic xenograft model. Confocal imaging offered precise images of meningothelial and fibroblastic mouse meningiomas as well as malignant meningiomas, which corresponded exactly to the pathological findings. Imaging showed a sharp definition of the brain-tumor interface and enabled identification of embedded nerves and vessels. Importantly, in both mouse models used in this study, extension of tumor along Virchow-Robin spaces into adjacent brain was detected by imaging. In conclusion, this novel technique, following validation in clinical trials, may open new possibilities for use in operating rooms to influence both decision making during the surgery and planning for additional treatments.",,Matthieu Peyre; Estelle Clermont-Taranchon; Anat Stemmer-Rachamimov; Michel Kalamarides,"Brain pathology (Zurich, Switzerland)",2013-07,10.1111/bpa.12039,abstract_only,False
PMID:24503545,Expression of WW domain-containing oxidoreductase WOX1 in human nervous system tumors.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the expression levels of the tumor suppressor WOX1 in nervous system tumors and its co-expression with p53 and neurofibromatosis type 2/merlin (NF2) tumor suppressor gene products. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry, western blotting and in situ hybridization were used for WOX1 protein and WWOX mRNA expression. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopical immunohistochemistry were performed for colocalization of gene products. RESULTS: WOX1 expression is low in normal cortical neurons, mainly on the axon fibers, whereas there is moderate to high immunoreactivity in the cytosol and nuclei of certain tumor cells. In the microcystic (WHO grade I) and malignant (WHO grade III) meningiomas, WOX1 expression is intense, but various in transitional (WHO grade I) and atypical (WHO grade II) subtypes. WOX1 levels are moderate to high in the menigiotheliomatous area, but relatively low in the fibroblastic area. WOX1 and NF2/merlin, but not p53, colocalized in certain tumor cells, primarily at the borders of nuclei. Schwannoma and astrocytoma specimens stained moderately to strongly positive for the WOX1 protein. Interestingly, the expression of WOX1, NF2/merlin and mutant p53 is intense in high grade glioblastoma, but WOX1 expression is low in metastatic carcinoma or adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of WOX1 on different types of nervous system tumors, including primary and metastatic tumors, is differential.",,Ming-Fu Chiang; Shur-Tzu Chen; Chen-Peng Lo; Chun-I Sze; Nan-Shan Chang; Yu-Jen Chen,Analytical cellular pathology (Amsterdam),2013,10.3233/ACP-140087,abstract_only,False
PMID:20195187,Merlin knockdown in human Schwann cells: clues to vestibular schwannoma tumorigenesis.,"HYPOTHESIS: To investigate the early events in molecular progression toward schwannoma tumorigenesis, we developed an in vitro model of human Schwann cell tumorigenesis by merlin knockdown. BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2)-related and sporadic vestibular schwannoma (VS) exhibit loss of functional merlin (schwannomin). After loss of merlin expression in the Schwann cell, the initial steps toward VS tumorigenesis are unknown. Merlin, a putative tumor suppressor protein, interacts with many cellular proteins, regulating their function. Among these are receptor tyrosine kinases, including the epidermal growth factor receptor family B (ErbB) family receptors epidermal growth factor receptor and ErbB2. Functional merlin interacts with and internalizes these growth factor receptors, silencing their proliferation and survival signaling. Deregulation of CD44, the cell adhesion/signaling molecule and cancer stem cell marker, has also been implicated in VS tumorigenesis. METHODS: Merlin knockdown was performed using small interfering RNA transfection into human Schwann cell primary cultures. Knockdown was confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR, immunofluorescence, and Western analysis. Expression profiles of ErbB, merlin, and the stem cell markers nestin and CD44 were examined in knockdowns. Proliferation rate was assessed with bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, and radiation sensitivity was assessed using the Annexin assay in knockdowns versus controls. RESULTS: Merlin knockdowns demonstrated increased proliferation rate, upregulation of epidermal growth factor receptor, ErbB2, and ErbB3, CD44, and nestin. Short-term merlin depletion had no effect on gamma irradiation sensitivity compared with controls. CONCLUSION: Merlin depletion results in deregulation of ErbB receptor signaling, promotes a dedifferentiated state, and increases Schwann cell proliferation, suggesting critical steps toward schwannoma tumorigenesis.","Methods Merlin knockdown was performed using small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection into human Schwann cell primary cultures. Knockdown was confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), immunofluorescence, and Western analysis. Expression profiles of ErbB, merlin, and the stem cell markers, nestin and CD44, were examined in knockdowns. Proliferation rate was assessed with BrdU incorporation and radiation sensitivity was assessed using the Annexin assay in knockdowns versus controls. Materials and Methods Cell Culture Human Schwann cells (HSC; ScienCell, Carlsbad, CA) were maintained in culture at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide. Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen), 0.1% penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen) and 1% human Schwann cell supplement (ScienCell). Media was changed every two days. siRNA Transfection Human Schwann cells (HSC) grown to 40% confluence were maintained in antibiotic-free media 24 hours prior to transfection. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules (neurofibromin 2 ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool; Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) were diluted in Opti-MEM reduced serum media (Invitrogen) and incubated with Lipofectamine-2000 ™  transfection reagent (Invitrogen) at room temperature for 20 minutes before being dropped onto cells at a final concentration of 40 nmol/L. Media was changed after 24 hours to minimize toxicity. Initial transfection was carried out on day 0, and repeat transfection was performed on day 4. Transfection with a non-targeting, random sequence siRNA (Dharmacon) or Lipofectamine ™  2000 alone served as separate negative controls. Cells were harvested on day 7 and Western blot techniques or qPCR were then performed. mRNA Expression Analysis On day 7 following transfection of HSC, total RNA was harvested with the RNeasy Mini Kit according to manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen Sciences, Germantown, MD). To ensure RNA quality, only RNA with an A260/A280 ratio of greater than or equal to 1.8 was used. For each qPCR reaction, 2 μg of RNA was converted to the more stable complimentary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) strands with TaqMan reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA) in a BioRad S1000 thermal cycler at 25°C for 10 minutes, followed by 42°C for 50 minutes, followed by 70°C for 15 minutes, then held at 4°C until ready for qPCR. For each qPCR reaction, 5 μL of cDNA (all samples standardized), TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and gene expression assays, containing primers and 6-FAM-labelled probe sets (max = 518 nM) for merlin, EGFR, ErbB2 and ErbB3, Nestin, and CD44 (Applied Biosystems), were used each in a 20uL reaction. A human cyclophilin gene expression assay containing a VIC-labeled probe (max = 554 nm; Applied Biosystems) was used as an internal control in each reaction (i.e., single tube method). For analysis of human VS samples (results shown in  Figure 5, B & D ), tumor tissue RNA was harvested (IRB approval #07-0135) and converted to cDNA as previously described.  13  cDNA samples were then subjected to qPCR amplification on an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, version 1.1 software) in duplicate. Quantification of gene expression was made by averaging results using a Microsoft Excel macro program designed for qPCR analysis with multiplex PCR, comparing them with standard curves for the internal control and expressed as “fold-induction” relative to baseline control (i.e., lipofectamine-only treated hSC). Immunoblotting Techniques Cells were lysed in Cell Lysis Buffer (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) with the addition of 0.1% phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and 0.01% protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and then sonicated. Protein concentration in cell lysates were determined with the bichinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Thermo Fischer, Rockford, IL) according to manufacturer’s instructions. 20 μg of protein were separated by electrophoresis using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) on a 7.5% Tris-HCL minigel (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Membranes were blocked for 1 hour at room temperature with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma Aldrich) in PBS, then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4°C. Membranes were then incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000) for one hour, then developed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (ECL, Thermo Fisher, Rockford, IL). Antibodies used were: monoclonal anti-EGFR (1:250; Capralogics, Hardwick, MA), polyclonal anti-ErbB2 (1:250; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), polyclonal anti-ErbB3 (1:250; Santa Cruz), polyclonal anti-merlin (1:250, Santa Cruz), and monoclonal anti-actin (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Immunofluorescence Staining Cells were fixed on glass coverslips for 10 minutes in 4% paraformaldehyde, then permeabilized for 5 minutes in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.2% Triton X-100. After several washes in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100, samples were blocked for 30 minutes with PBS plus 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.2% Triton X-100. Following several washes, samples were incubated in primary antibodies diluted 1:100 in PBS plus 2% BSA and 0.2% Triton X-100 for 2 hour at 37°C. Rabbit polyclonal anti-merlin (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), After several washes, green fluorescence-tagged goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc, West Grove, PA) diluted 1:200 were applied and samples were incubated for 1 hour in a humidified chamber. Slides were then mounted and coverslipped with Vectashield ®  mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc, Burlingame, CA). Images were acquired with an Olympus FV1000 point scanning confocal microscope (UCSD School of Medicine Light Microscopy Facility, supported by grant P30 NS047101). BrdU Assay Human Schwann cells with merlin knocked-down as described were cultured on 6-well plates. Zymed ®  labeling medium (Invitrogen) was diluted in DMEM to a concentration of 100 μmol/L and added to cells 48 hours prior to BrdU labeling. Cells were then treated with Zymed ®  BrdU Staining Kit (Invitrogen). Eight random images were taken from each well and counted by three individuals. Statistical analysis was performed using the Chi square test and results were confirmed with the t-test. Values were considered statistically significant at p<0.05. Annexin V Assay for Cell Death Flow cytometry was used to assess the extent to which transfection with merlin siRNA could induce human Schwann cell resistance to death in response to ionizing radiation. Cells were plated at 80 % confluency and exposed to 0 or 18 Gy of ionizing radiation (gamma) 24 hours after transfection with merlin siRNA (40 nM). The assay was performed with a two color analysis of FITC-labeled Annexin V binding and PI uptake using the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection kit. Positioning of quadrants on Annexin V/PI dot plots was performed and live cells (Annexin V − /PI − , F3), early/primary apoptotic cells (Annexin V + /PI − , F4), late/secondary apoptotic cells (Annexin V + /PI + , F2) and necrotic cells (Annexin V − /PI + , F1) were distinguished.

PMID:18413802,Sorafenib inhibits growth and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in malignant peripheral nerve sheath cells.,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are soft-tissue tumors with a very poor prognosis and largely resistant to chemotherapy. MPNSTs are characterized by activation of the Ras pathway by loss of tumor suppressor neurofibromatosis type 1. In view of this, MPNST may be susceptible to inhibition of the activated Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by the B-Raf inhibitor sorafenib. MPNST (MPNST and ST8814) and dedifferentiated liposarcoma (LS141 and DDLS) human tumor cell lines were characterized for Ras activation and B-Raf expression. Tumor cells were treated with sorafenib and examined for growth inhibition, inhibition of phospho-MEK, phospho-ERK, cell cycle arrest, and changes in cyclin D1 and pRb expression. MPNSTs were sensitive to sorafenib at nanomolar concentrations. This appeared to be due to inhibition of phospho-MEK, phospho-ERK, suppression of cyclin D1, and hypophosphorylation of pRb at the CDK4-specific sites, resulting in a G(1) cell cycle arrest. These effects were not seen in the liposarcoma cells, which either did not express B-Raf or showed decreased Ras activation. Small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of B-Raf in MPNSTs also induced a G(1) cell cycle arrest in these cells, with a marked inhibition of cyclin D1 expression and Rb phosphorylation, whereas depletion of C-Raf did not affect either. With growth inhibition at the low nanomolar range, sorafenib, by inhibiting the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, may prove to be a novel therapy for patients with MPNST.","Experimental design MPNST (MPNST and ST8814) and dedifferentiated liposarcoma (LS141 and DDLS) human tumor cell lines were characterized for Ras activation and B-Raf expression. Tumor cells were treated with sorafenib and examined for growth inhibition, inhibition of phospho-MEK (p-MEK), phospho-ERK (p-ERK), cell cycle arrest, and changes in cyclin D1 and pRb expression. Materials and Methods Cell Cultures LS141 and DDLS primary human cell lines were derived from two patients with high grade retroperitoneal dedifferentiated liposarcoma ( Singer Ref ?). MPNST was derived from a patient with a high grade peripheral nerve sheath tumor of the thigh, ST8814 was derived from a patient with NF1-associated MPNST of the thigh (both graciously supplied by Jonathan Fletcher, DFCI, Boston, MA). MPNST, ST8814 and the LS141 were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15% heat inactivated FBS plus penicillin and streptomycin. DDLS cells were grown in DMEM HG: F-12 media supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS plus penicillin and streptomycin. Sorafenib (BAY43-9006) was supplied by Bayer Pharmaceutical Corp. (West Haven, CT). The compound was dissolved in DMSO as a stock and stored in aliquots at −20°C. Cell Proliferation and Apoptosis Assays Cells (1500/well) were plated in 96-well plates, and treated with the indicated concentrations of sorafenib for 4 days. Viability was assessed using the Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK8) from Dojindo Molecular Technologies (Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Plates were read at 450nm in a plate reader (SpectraMax 340, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Growth inhibition was expressed as a percentage of control. The measurement of apoptosis by quantitative fluorescence microscopy (QFM) was carried out using 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma) staining of nuclear chromatin. Cells were scored for the incidence of apoptotic chromatin condensation using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscope (Nikon). Ras Activity To determine the activity of Ras the EZ-Detect Ras Activation Kit (cat. 89855 from Pierce, Rockford, IL) was used according to manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, cell lysates were treated with GTPγS or GDP to activate or inactivate Ras, respectively. The nucleotide exchange reaction was terminated within 15 minutes by placing the samples on ice. The lysates were then incubated with a GST-fusion protein that contains the Ras Binding Domain (RBD) of Raf1 to pull down active Ras. Detection of Ras was done by immunoblotting using the supplied pan-Ras antibody. Flow Cytometry The cells were harvested by trypsinization and fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol. After washing with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, cells were labeled with MPM-2 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) for 1 h at 4°C. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with goat antimouse-FITC (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) for 1 h in the dark. After washing, cells were resuspended in 5 μg/ml propidium iodide containing 50 μg/ml RNase A. Samples were analyzed on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ), and data were analyzed for DNA content using Flowjo software. Western Blotting Cells were plated 48 hours prior to treatment. Briefly, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Complete Mini, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and 1mM NaVO3. Equal amounts of protein were loaded on 4–12% PAGE gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Membranes were blotted with antibodies specific for Cyclin D1, ERK, phospho-ERK, B-Raf, and Ku-70 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, Ca), MEK1, Rb, and Mcl-1 (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), phospho-MEK1/2 [Ser217/221] and phospho Rb[S807/S811] (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), Ras (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and α-tubulin (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Gene Silencing Cells were plated at 50–60% confluence in 60 mm plates and incubated for 24 h. Cells were then transiently transfected using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) mixed with siRNA for either B-Raf: AAAGAATTGGATCTGGATCAT ( 20 ), and C-Raf: TGTGCGAAATGGAATGAGCTT, both from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). As a control, a nonspecific siRNA was used.

PMID:40352015,Development of a Machine Learning Algorithm for the Prediction of WHO Grade 1 Meningioma Recurrence.,"Objective Meningiomas commonly recur following gross total resection (GTR), and the risk of recurrence is difficult to predict using current classification schemes such as the World Health Organization (WHO) tumor grade. This study aimed to create a predictive model of recurrence risk following GTR of WHO grade 1 meningiomas based on histopathological and epidemiological factors.  Methods A retrospective chart review was completed for all patients at our institution who underwent their first surgery for a WHO grade 1 meningioma between 2017 and 2022. Those with genetic predispositions, such as neurofibromatosis type 2, were excluded. Baseline characteristics, including histopathology findings, were obtained, and we used a Risk-calibrated Superspase Linear Integer Model (Risk-SLIM) with a five-fold cross-validation (CV) to create a predictive model of recurrence over an average follow-up of three years.  Results Univariate analysis of our selected variables revealed a significant predictive association between WHO grade 1 meningioma recurrence and subtotal resection but not with any other variable. However, the meningioma recurrence score (MRS) generated by our machine learning algorithm revealed multiple predictive factors of recurrence, including age, female gender, and various histopathologic features, including the Ki-67/MIB-1 index. Conclusions Machine learning algorithms like the one we present here may help identify patients at high risk of recurrence of their WHO grade 1 meningioma, and they are more likely to benefit from closer postoperative surveillance or adjuvant treatment, even when GTR is achieved.","Materials and methods Following institutional board review approval, a retrospective chart review was conducted of all patients presenting with cranial meningioma who underwent surgery between 2017 and 2022. Individual charts were then reviewed to identify relevant patients and extract operative and histopathologic characteristics. Histopathologic characteristics were collected from patients’ postoperative pathology reports. Patients with WHO grade 2 and grade 3 meningiomas and those with a history of genetic variants that increase the probability of developing meningiomas, such as neurofibromatosis type 2, were removed from this study. Variables were selected given their association with recurrence in prior studies and the frequency at which neuropathologists reported them at our institution. Recurrence was determined at routine outpatient follow-up visits with advanced imaging, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showing regrowth of the tumor near the surgical lesion. Patients missing any of the previously mentioned variables were excluded. Variables were stratified categorically to simplify the prediction model and increase the effect size for each factor. Continuous and categorical variables were initially analyzed using either the Mann-Whitney U test or Fisher’s exact test. Statistical significance was deemed at p-values of <0.05 for each test. A new modeling method known as the Risk-Calibrated Superspase Linear Integer Model (Risk-SLIM) was created to reduce the variability in risk assessment using machine learning techniques. This technique created an optimized risk score with superior risk calibration using an optimized area under the curve (AUC). The AUC is a score to identify the performance of the model. The Risk-SLIM method has been used in various risk prediction models and has been shown to produce excellent results with external validation. Using this method, a risk stratification score was created to identify patients at high risk for WHO grade 1 meningioma recurrence. To assess risk validation, we also examined the average calibration error (CAL), the mean-squared error between the predicted probability and the observed score. The CAL exhibits how close the model score is to the observed score. Following the creation of our model, a five-fold cross-validation (CV) was utilized. Specifically, the data were randomly split into five separate parts, where the model was trained using four of the five folds, and then the model was tested using the last fold of the model. These were denoted as five-fold CV AUC and five-fold CV CAL errors, respectively. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was conducted to evaluate the predictive ability of the proposed model. All statistics and models were conducted in Python version 3.10 (Python Software Foundation, Wilmington, Delaware, US).",Simon G Ammanuel; Matthew Stenerson; Thomas Staniszewski; Manasa Kalluri; Benjamin Lee; Elsa Nico; Azam S Ahmed,Cureus,2025-04,10.7759/cureus.82033,minimal,True
PMID:30274821,Synergistic effect of Nutlin-3 combined with MG-132 on schwannoma cells through restoration of merlin and p53 tumour suppressors.,"BACKGROUND: The great majority of sporadic vestibular schwannomas (VSs) are due to the mutations of the NF2 gene encoding merlin. Sporadic VSs exhibit variable growth patterns and only a small fraction of the tumours are fast-growing; however, the underlying mechanisms remain undefined. METHODS: DNA sequencing and dosage analysis were used to identify the NF2 mutation status in sporadic schwannomas. The expression and sub-cellular localization of merlin and p53-MDM2 were assessed by immunoblotting, qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence. In vitro and in vivo studies were performed to reveal the effects of Nutlin-3 (a MDM2 inhibitor) and/or MG-132(a proteasome inhibitor) on schwannomas. The proliferation of schwannoma cells was assessed by CCK-8 assay, EdU staining and Flow cytometry analysis. FINDINGS: Double genetic hits of NF2 tended to occur in fast-growing tumours, characterized by the absence of merlin. The deregulation of p53-MDM2 was demonstrated to mediate merlin-deficient tumour growth, characterized by a nuclear accumulation of stabilized MDM2, contributing to a nuclear export of p53 for degradation. Nutlin-3 blocked the proliferation of schwannoma cells via a cooperative recovery of merlin and p53, accompanied by the shuttling of both proteins from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. We further demonstrated a difference in the sensitivity to Nutlin-3 between schwannoma cells with and without merlin expression. Nutlin-3 combined with MG-132 narrowed this between-group difference and triggered stronger inhibitory effects on the growth of schwannomas through coordinated reactivation of p53. INTERPRETATION: These findings present treatment strategies directed on the pathogenesis of sporadic schwannomas. FUND: National Natural Science Foundation of China.","Methods DNA sequencing and dosage analysis were used to identify the  NF2  mutation status in sporadic schwannomas.

The proliferation of schwannoma cells was assessed by CCK-8 assay, EdU staining and Flow cytometry analysis. 2 Methods 2.1 Ethics statement All experimental protocols were approved by the Research Ethics Review Committee of Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Methods used in the present study were carried out in accordance with approved guidelines and regulations. It conformed to the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki. 2.2 Patients The study group consisted of 121 patients with sporadic VSs and 12 patients of neurofibromatosis type 2-related VSs, which were resected and pathologically confirmed at our institution between March of 2012 to December 2015. Peripheral blood samples were collected from all patients prior to operation with written informed consent. Tumour size was measured as the largest diameter in the axial plate of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). As controls, five cases of normal vestibular nerves from vestibular neurectomy for Meniere's disease were included. 2.3 Direct sequencing analysis and dosage analysis Bidirectional sequencing was conducted to detect microlesions in the gene. DNA extraction was performed using the TIANamp Genomic DNA Kit (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China). All exons and exon–intron boundaries of the gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and underwent bidirectional sequencing. To identify exonic deletions, we used a Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification Analysis (MLPA) kit (SALSA P044 NF2; MRC-Holland) as previously described. Relative peak heights of all amplicons of each test sample were compared to a normalized average of three nerves. The Dosage Quotient (DQ) was used to describe the copy number status. 0.4 < DQ < 0.7 was considered to show a heterozygous deletion. 2.4 Transfection Human Schwann cells (HSCs) were purchased from ScienCell Research Laboratories (catalog no., 1700). The rat RT4-D6P2T schwannoma cells was obtained from the Global Bioresource Center. The HEI-193, an HPV E6-E7 immortalized schwannoma cell line, was a kind gift from Dr. Weg M. Ongkeko (House Ear Institute). Lentiviral shRNA vectors were constructed using target sequences against the expression of  NF2  (sh1, 5′- ACTTCAAAGATA CTG ACAT-3′; sh2, 5′- TCTGGAT ATT CT GCACAAT-3′; sh3, 5′- TTCGTGTTA ATAA G C TGA T -3′),  P53  (5′-GA CTCCA GTGGT AA TCT A C-3′), and  MDM2  (#1, 5′- GAGAGTGTGGAATCT AGTT-3′; #2, 5′-GGACATCTTA T GG CC TGC T -3′); #3, 5′-CCTGC T T TACATGTGCAAA-3′). A nonsense shRNA was constructed using the target sequence 5′-TTCT CCGAACGTGTCACGT-3′. The plasmids HA-tagged  NF2  (a gift from Dr. Y. J. LU, Tongji University, China), Flag-tagged  P53  (Addgene; #10838) and a plasmid vector control (ViGene Biosciences) were transfected into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). 2.5 Drug treatments in vitro In vitro experiments, Nutlin-3 (# S1778, Beyotime, Shanghai, China), MG-132 (# S1748, Beyotime) and Pifithrin (PFT)-α (#S1816, Beyotime) were dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 20 mg/mL until use. Subsequent to a 12 h starving period, the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium containing DMSO vehicle (untreated control) or different concentrations of drugs. A sufficient mixing allows drugs to be dissolved in the medium. 2.6 Tumour xenograft model and drug treatments In vivo experiments, Nutlin-3 (# S1061) and MG-132 (# S2619) were purchased from Selleckchem (Houston, TX, USA). Nutlin-3 and MG-132 were dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 80 mg/mL and 40 mg/mL until use, respectively. To establish xenograft models, RT4-D6P2T or HEI-193 cells (2 × 10 6  in 0.1 mL phosphatebuffered saline) were subcutaneously inoculated into the back of 4-week-old BALB/c nude mice (male) separately as previous described [ 10 ]. Tumours were allowed to grow for 14 days (average tumour size was 59 mm 3 ). Subsequently, mice were randomly separated into 4 groups of six each and different treatments were subsequently undertaken as follows: (a) control (vehicle; 1:1:1:7 solution of DMSO: tw80: propanediol: phosphatebuffered saline); (b) Nutlin-3 (i.p., 40 mg/kg, once a day); (c) MG-132 (i.p., 5 mg/kg, once a day); (d) Nutlin-3 (i.p., 40 mg/kg) + MG-132 (i.p., 5 mg/kg, once a day). To prepare the drug solution, Tw80, propanediol and phosphatebuffered saline were added into DMSO containing drugs in order before a sufficient mixing. The notion that we dissolved the drug in a solution containing tw80 and propanediol originally came from two independent literatures [ 11 , 12 ]. Tumour diameter was measured every 2 days until 2 weeks after drugs administered. Tumour volume (mm3) was estimated by measuring the longest and shortest diameter of the tumour and calculating as follows: volume = (shortest diameter) 2  × (longest diameter) × 0.5. With continuous administration for 14 days, the mice were euthanised with 100% carbon dioxide inhalation, cervical dislocation followed. The tumours were removed and weighed. 2.7 RNA isolation and qRT-PCR analysis RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent and reverse-transcribed into to cDNA by a reverse transcription kit. PCR amplification was run with SYBR® Premix Ex Taq™ (Takara) on a Real-Time PCR Detection System. The results were normalized to GAPDH, and the values were calculated using the comparative threshold cycle method (2 -ΔΔCt ). The PCR primers were listed as follows: Forward, 5’-GCAGATCAGCTGA AGCAGGA-3′ and reverse, 5’-ACCAA TGAGGTTGAAGCTTGGTA-3′ for  NF2 ; Forward,5’-ACC TCACAGATTCCAGCTT CG-3′ and reverse, 5′-T TTCATAGTATA AGTG TCTTTTT-3′ for  MDM2 ; Forward, 5’-TCAACA AGATGTTTT GCCAACTG-3′ and reverse, 5′-A TG TGC TGTGACTGCTTGT AGATG-3′ for  P53 ; Forward, 5’AA GGTGA AGGTC GGAG T CAACG - 3′ and reverse, 5’-CAGC CTTCTCCATGGT GGGAA-3′ for  GAPDH . 2.8 Immunoblotting analysis Immunoblotting analysis was performed with antibodies specific for merlin (# HPA003097, Sigma-Aldrich; # sc331, Santa Cruz), p53 (# P6874, Sigma-Aldrich; # 2524, Cell Signaling), cyclinD1 (# C7464, Sigma-Aldrich), MDM2 (# M43084 and # SAB4300601, Sigma-Aldrich), caspase-3 (# 9662, Cell Signaling), cleaved caspase-3 (cleaved-CASP3, #AC033, Beyotime), HA-Tag (AF0039, Beyotime) and FLAG-Tag (# AF0036, Beyotime). The β-actin antibody (# AA128, Beyotime) was used to ensure equal loading of total protein, while the α-Tubulin (# AF0001, Beyotime) and Histone H3 (# AH433, Beyotime) antibodies were used to ensure equal loading of the cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins, respectively. The nuclear/ cytoplasmic fractions were isolated using the NE-PER Nuclear Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagent kit (#78835, Thermo Scientific). 2.9 Immunofluorescence Tissue samples were processed as in the immunohistochemistry staining (without H2O2 quench). Cultures were plated on glass slides, fixed with paraformaldehydees, and then permeabilized in Triton X-100. The slides were blocked with goat serum, and then they were single- or double-probed with antibodies against S100 (# Z0311, Dako), merlin (# HPA003097), cyclinD1 (# C7464), p53 (# P6874) and MDM2 (# M43084 and # SAB4300601, Sigma-Aldrich). The Alexa Fluor® 488 Phalloidin (# A12379, Thermo Scientific) was used for F-actin Staining. Sections were nuclear counterstained with 4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Images (no z-stack) were acquired using a confocal microscope (LSM 880; Carl Zeiss GmbH, Germany). Images were generated using Imaris software (Bitplane AG) and processed for display using Photoshop software (Adobe). 2.10 Viability assays and EdU incorporation assay For viability and proliferation assays, cells were grown to about 40% confluency in 96-well culture plates (Costar) before the treatment with DMSO control or different concentrations of drugs. Cell viability was determined by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) from Dojindo (Kumamoto, Japan). Subsequent to treatment, medium was replaced with an equal volume of fresh medium containing CCK-8. Next, cells were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C, and the absorbance of the solution was analyzed at 450 nm using a SpectraMax190 microplate reader (Molecular, USA). The 5-ethynyl-20-deoxyuridine (EdU, Ribobio, China) labeling was used to measure the DNA synthesis activity. Briefly, cells were exposed to EdU, washed with phosphate buffered saline, fixed with formaldehyde, incubated with Triton X-100 and reacted 1 × Apollo® reaction cocktail. The DNA contents of cells in each well were stained with DAPI for 15 min. Images were captured under LAS AF software (Leica). 2.11 Flow cytometry analysis To determine the cell cycle distribution, 2 × 10 6  cells were harvested after the designated treatment and fixed in 70% ethanol overnight. The cells were resuspended in a solution of PBS plus 0.5% Triton-X100, 100 μg/mL RNase, and 50 μg/mL propidium iodide. The DNA content was analyzed using a Cell Lab Quanta™ SC flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, USA). The rate of apoptotic cells was determined by Flow cytometry analyses using Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining kit (Becton Dickinson, USA). 2.12 Statistics Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 17.0 statistics software. All values in the present study were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) from at least three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Student's  t -test to investigate if the differences were significant among the mean values of different groups.  P -values of <0.05 are considered significant.",Hongsai Chen; Lu Xue; He Huang; Hantao Wang; Xiaoman Zhang; Weidong Zhu; Zhigang Wang; Zhaoyan Wang; Hao Wu,EBioMedicine,2018-10,10.1016/j.ebiom.2018.09.042,minimal,True
PMID:18632543,Effect of simvastatin on cognitive functioning in children with neurofibromatosis type 1: a randomized controlled trial.,"CONTEXT: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is among the most common genetic disorders that cause learning disabilities. Recently, it was shown that statin-mediated inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase restores the cognitive deficits in an NF1 mouse model. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of simvastatin on neuropsychological, neurophysiological, and neuroradiological outcome measures in children with NF1. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-two of 114 eligible children (54%) with NF1 participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted between January 20, 2006, and February 8, 2007, at an NF1 referral center at a Dutch university hospital. INTERVENTION: Simvastatin or placebo treatment once daily for 12 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were scores on a Rey complex figure test (delayed recall), cancellation test (speed), prism adaptation, and the mean brain apparent diffusion coefficient based on magnetic resonance imaging. Secondary outcome measures were scores on the cancellation test (standard deviation), Stroop color word test, block design, object assembly, Rey complex figure test (copy), Beery developmental test of visual-motor integration, and judgment of line orientation. Scores were corrected for baseline performance, age, and sex. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed between the simvastatin and placebo groups on any primary outcome measure: Rey complex figure test (beta = 0.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.36 to 0.56); cancellation test (beta = -0.19; 95% CI, -0.67 to 0.29); prism adaptation (odds ratio = 2.0; 95% CI, 0.55 to 7.37); and mean brain apparent diffusion coefficient (beta = 0.06; 95% CI, -0.07 to 0.20). In the secondary outcome measures, we found a significant improvement in the simvastatin group in object assembly scores (beta = 0.54; 95% CI, 0.08 to 1.01), which was specifically observed in children with poor baseline performance (beta = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.29 to 1.30). Other secondary outcome measures revealed no significant effect of simvastatin treatment. CONCLUSION: In this 12-week trial, simvastatin did not improve cognitive function in children with NF1. Trial Registration isrctn.org Identifier: ISRCTN14965707.","METHODS Design A prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, single-site, 12-week clinical trial was conducted in children with NF1 between January 20, 2006, and February 8, 2007. The study was approved by the medical ethical committee of the Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Participants All participants were recruited from the multidisciplinary NF1 outpatient clinic of the Erasmus MC–Sophia Children’s Hospital, which is a university hospital and NF1 referral center in the Netherlands. Participants were enrolled by a pediatrician in the NF1 outpatient clinic (A.G.B.). Inclusion criteria were age 8 to 16 years, NF1 diagnosis according to the criteria of the National Institutes of Health, 17  and oral and written informed consent from parents and children older than 12 years. Exclusion criteria were segmental NF1, pathology of the central nervous system (other than asymptomatic gliomas), deafness, severely impaired vision, use of antiepileptic drugs, insufficient comprehension or use of the Dutch language, and an IQ below 48, which was assessed at baseline using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children–Revised, Dutch version. 18 Protocol Patients were randomized to simvastatin or placebo using a permuted-block, 1:1 randomization list generated by the trial statistician (S.M.F.P.) with blocks of 6 participants, in which medication numbers 1 through 62 corresponded to either simvastatin or placebo. Randomization was performed by the Erasmus MC trial pharmacist, who assigned patients a medication number in the order of their enrollment in the trial and who dispensed the medication. Patients and all other investigators were blind to the treatment allocation. Patients were treated once a day in the morning for 12 weeks with simvastatin (weeks 0–4, 10 mg/d; weeks 5–8, 20 mg/d; and weeks 9–12, 20 mg/d for children aged 8–12 years or 40 mg/d [taken as two 20-mg doses] for children aged 13–16 years) or equivalent placebo. The placebo capsules were filled with microcrystalline cellulose PH102 and treatment capsules with a filler and a tablet of 10-mg (weeks 0–4) or 20-mg (weeks 5–12) simvastatin (film-coated; Alpharma Inc; Bridge-water, New Jersey). The capsules containing placebo or simvastatin were nontransparent and identical in color, shape, and size. Patients were instructed not to open the capsules. Patients were judged adherent when they took at least 80% of their study medication during the intervention period of 12 weeks, which was assessed by counting returned capsules. Outcome Measures Outcome measures were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. For the primary outcome measures, we chose 2 neuropsychological tests that were analogous to statin-responsive tests in  Nf1  mice (measuring visual-spatial memory and attention). In addition, we selected a neurophysiological and neuroradiological measure because we reasoned that these measurements would be insensitive to placebo or test-retest effects. This resulted in the following 4 primary outcome measures: performance on the Rey complex figure test (CFT) (delayed recall; assessing nonverbal long-term memory), performance on the cancellation test (speed; assessing attention), performance on a prism adaptation task (measurement of adaptation of the angle of hand movements in response to prism glass distortion, 19  which is thought to be dependent on cerebellar function 20 , 21 ), and mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC value) of the brain (mean ADC value of 7 predetermined anatomic locations predominantly affected by T2-weighed hyperintensities) as previously described. 9 For the secondary outcome measures, we selected neuropsychological tests assessing domains that are specifically affected in patients with NF1: tests for attention and tests for visual-spatial skills with baseline scores of 1 SD or more below average. 4 , 9  This resulted in the following secondary outcome measures: performance on the cancellation test (standard deviation; measuring attention fluctuations), the Stroop color word test, the block design test and object assembly test of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children–Revised, the Rey CFT (copy), the Beery developmental test of visual-motor integration, and the judgment of line orientation task. 22 Magnetic resonance imaging was performed by using a 1.5-tesla system (EchoSpeed; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) and a dedicated 8-channel head coil. Diffusion tensor imaging data were gathered by using a multirepetition, single-shot, echo-planar sequence with a section thickness of 3 mm with no gap. A 25-gradient directions technique was performed to obtain good diffusion tensor images (sensitivity,  b  = 1000 s/mm 2 ; repetition time, 15 000 milliseconds; echo time, 82.1 milliseconds; 1 average; field of view, 240 × 240 mm 2 ; matrix, 128 × 128; voxel size, 1.8 × 1.8 × 3.0 mm 3 ) as described previously. 9 All neuropsychological tests were developed for children, administered in their Dutch versions, and scored by 1 pediatric neuropsychologist (M.J.B.). Parallel versions of tests were applied when available to reduce the impact of practice effects. For technical reasons, left-handed children (n=7) were excluded from the prism adaptation task. Treatment safety and adherence was assessed in the outpatient clinic at baseline, after 4 and 12 weeks, and with a telephone consult after 8 weeks. Patients were provided with a diary in which they were instructed to note any deviations from treatment protocol and possible adverse events. At each consult, a general pediatrician recorded any adverse events and serious adverse events (adverse events that were life-threatening, causing disability, or requiring hospitalization) with a standardized checklist of the adverse events and serious adverse events reported with simvastatin use, 23  supported by open questions and a review of the patient’s diary. All reported adverse events were scored as being not drug related, possibly drug related, or definitely drug related prior to unblinding. During the visits to the outpatient clinic, the pediatrician (A.G.B.) performed a standardized internal and neurological assessment, and blood was drawn for laboratory examination. We examined the safety parameters (levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatine phosphokinase) and efficacy parameters (levels of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides) according to standard clinical laboratory protocol. Criteria for discontinuation of study medication were a persistent increase of more than 3-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN) alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase levels, more than 10-fold the ULN for creatine phosphokinase levels with or without muscular symptoms, or 5- to 10-fold the ULN for creatine phosphokinase levels with muscular symptoms. 16 Statistical Analyses One of the prominent effects seen in statin-treated  Nf1  mice was recovery of their deficit in visual-spatial memory. 13  The Rey CFT (delayed recall) assesses the analogous domain of nonverbal long-term memory in humans and has good psychometric properties, and performance on this test is specifically affected in patients with NF1. 24  Therefore, we based our power calculation on this test. On the assumption of a correlation of 0.70 between measurement before and after treatment, and a mean (SD)  z  score of −1.32 (1.01) on the Rey CFT (delayed recall) at baseline, 24  we calculated that 30 persons were needed in both the placebo and treatment groups to ensure a power of 0.80 of detecting a significant (α= .05) improvement in the Rey CFT (delayed recall) score up to −0.28 (difference of 1.04) in the treatment group. All data were analyzed using SPSS 12.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois). For the neuropsychological tests,  z  scores were used (with negative values indicating performance below the normative mean and positive values performance above the normative mean), except for the cancellation test (standard deviation) (raw score for nonnormal distribution of reference values; larger negative values indicated larger attention fluctuations). Prism adaptation was scored to occur if the change (adaptation) of the angle of hand movements was significant ( P < .01) and larger than −1 SD of the mean change of age-matched healthy controls (n=16, unpublished observations). A decrease in ADC values indicates lower signal intensity. Modified intention-to-treat analysis was performed for all patients with available 12-week test scores (n=61) without imputing missing values. Differences between the simvastatin and placebo groups at baseline were analyzed with the  t  test, Mann-Whitney test, and χ 2  test. Differences between the simvastatin and placebo groups after 12 weeks of treatment were assessed using univariate and multivariate regression analysis. In the univariate analysis, we adjusted for baseline scores, and in the multivariate regression analysis we adjusted for baseline scores, age, and sex. Regression coefficients (β) reflect the estimated differences in mean score at follow-up between the treatment groups with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For categorical measures (prism adaptation), the difference between the treatment groups was expressed as an odds ratio with 95% CI. Cut-off level for significance was set at  P < .05. Effect modification of outcome parameters that were significantly different between the treatment and placebo groups after 12 weeks was examined using interaction terms between treatment and age and between treatment and baseline performance. The rationale for this analysis is that we expected increased plasticity in younger children and more room for improvement in children with low baseline performance, thus affecting the magnitude of response to simvastatin treatment. Subgroup analysis was performed only if effect modification was plausible ( P <.10 to take into account the small size of the subgroups) for addition of the interaction term to the multivariate analysis. All  P  values reported are 2-sided. The outcome parameters and the method of statistical analysis, including the subgroup analyses, were defined before unblinding. We did not correct for multiple comparisons for the following reasons. There are only 4 primary outcome measures, and they are specifically based on a priori assumptions. The outcome measures on the neuropsychological tests are potentially correlated, and correction would thus be inappropriate. By correcting for multiple comparisons, it would be very hard to detect a possible effect in a relatively small patient population. Thus we would run a high risk of discarding a promising drug while in fact there is an effect (type II error). For ethical reasons, an interim analysis was conducted by the statistician (S.M.F.P.) after 36 patients completed the study with complete maintenance of the double-blind protocol for all others. The criterion to discontinue the study was a significant difference between the simvastatin and placebo groups on Rey CFT (delayed recall) score at 12 weeks ( P <.01). The statistician communicated that this criterion was “not reached” and the study was continued as planned.",Lianne C Krab; Arja de Goede-Bolder; Femke K Aarsen; Saskia M F Pluijm; Marlies J Bouman; Jos N van der Geest; Maarten Lequin; Coriene E Catsman; Willem Frans M Arts; Steven A Kushner; Alcino J Silva; Chris I de Zeeuw; Henriëtte A Moll; Ype Elgersma,JAMA,2008-07-16,10.1001/jama.300.3.287,minimal,True
PMID:20554030,CXCL12 alone is insufficient for gliomagenesis in Nf1 mutant mice.,"Tumorigenesis requires interactions between tumor progenitors and their microenvironment. We found that low cAMP levels were sufficient for tumorigenesis in a mouse model of Neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1)-associated optic pathway glioma (OPG). We hypothesized that the distinct pattern of glioma in NF1 reflected spatiotemporal differences in CXCL12 effects on cAMP levels. Thus, we sought to alter the pattern of gliomagenesis through manipulation of CXCL12-CXCR4 pathway activation in Nf1 OPG mice. Forced CXCL12 expression induced glioma at a low frequency. Further, treatment of Nf1 OPG mice with AMD3100, a CXCR4 antagonist, did not attenuate glioma growth. Thus, it appears, CXCL12 alone cannot promote gliomagenesis in NF1 mice.","2. Materials and Methods 2.1 Cell Lines and Animals The HEK 293T cell line was purchased from ATCC and the LN428 human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cell line was a gift from Dr. Erwin van Meir (Winship Cancer Center, Emory University, Atlanta, GA). OPG mice ( Nf1   flox/mut ; GFAP-Cre, Nf1+/− GFAP CKO) mice were generated as previously described ( Bajenaru et al., 2003 ), and all mice used in this study with this genotype are referred to as  Nf1  OPG mice, unless otherwise specified. All animals were maintained on a C57Bl/6 background, and used in accordance with an established Animal Studies Protocol approved by the Washington University School of Medicine Animal Studies Committee. 2.2 Chemicals, Reagents, and Antibodies All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. All antibodies used in this study were purchased from Peprotech (goat anti-CXCL12 and rabbit anti CXCL12), Invitrogen (Rat anti-GFAP), R&D (Goat anti-Endoglin), Wako (rabbit anti-IBA-1), Cell Signaling Technology (p-PKA substrate, pan-AKT and pS473-AKT), Leinco (pan-CXCR4) and Sigma (mouse anti-CNPase). Antibody directed against phosphorylated CXCR4 (pCXCR4) was developed in our lab as reported previously ( Woerner et al., 2005 ). The rabbit anti Olig2 antibody (DF-308) was a gift from Dr. Charles Stiles (Dana Farber Cancer Institute). 2.3 Lentivirus All lentiviruses were produced from each packaging vector separately by the Viral Vectors Core Facility of The Hope Center for Neurological Diseases at Washington University School of Medicine. Murine CXCL12 cDNA was subcloned into the lentiviral vector as previously described ( Goldhoff et al., 2008 ). A second packaging vector (FUW-FLG) encoding a fusion of firefly luciferase and enhanced green fluorescent protein driven by the human ubiquitin-C promoter within an established lentiviral backbone was used as a control virus as previously described ( Lois et al., 2002 ;  Yang et al., 2007 ). 2.4 Intracranial Viral Injections Lentiviruses were injected into the cortex 2 mm lateral and posterior to the Bregma as previously reported ( Warrington et al., 2010 ). Briefly,  Nf1  OPG mice at 4 to 5 weeks of ages were positioned in a stereotactic frame (Stoelting) and 500,000 transducing units each of FUW-FLG and CXCL12 viruses were injected through a 27-gauge needle at 3.5 mm below the dura mater. The incision was sealed by vetbond (3M), and all animals received an intraperitoneal injection of Buprenorphine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) 12 h after surgery. 2.5 Bioluminescence Imaging Bioluminescence imaging was performed before and after viral injection. Bioluminescence signals from the virus-encoded luciferase activity were detected using an IVIS 50 system (Caliper). All parameters for image capture and analyses were performed as previously described ( Goldhoff et al., 2008 ;  Gross and Piwnica-Worms, 2005 ;  Yang et al., 2007 ). 2.6 Tissue Sectioning and Immunohistochemistry Experimental sections were cut at 10 microns from 4% paraformaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded mice brains. Antigen retrieval was processed on all slides according to manufacturer’s guidelines (DakoCytomation). Concentrations for all the primary antibodies were as follows: CXCL12 (1:75), GFAP (2.5 mg/ml), IBA-1 (1:1000), Olig2 (1:20,000), CNPase (1:500), pCXCR4 (1:150), p-PKA substrate (1:200) and Endoglin (1:125). All staining was detected by using biotinylated secondary antibodies enhanced by tertiary streptavidin-HRP, and visualized by DAB development or Vector VIP peroxidase substrate (DAKO). Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin or methyl green (Oligo2 and CNPase). 2.7 Manganese Enhanced MRI and AMD3100 treatment Nf1  OPG mice underwent MEMRI at 10–12 weeks of age to confirm the presence of an optic glioma as previously described ( Banerjee et al., 2007 ), followed by randomization to either vehicle or AMD3100 treatment. AMD3100 was administered by subcutaneous osmotic infusion pump (Alzet, CA) loaded with 25 mg/ml AMD3100 in sterile PBS according to the manufacturer’s instructions (n = 8 mice). Controls were  Nf1  OPG mice with Alzet pumps containing PBS only (n = 7 mice). The infusion rate was 0.25 ml/h (50 mg/d). Following 28 days of administration, mice were euthanized and their optic nerves were removed for analysis. To determine the volume of the optic nerve, three diameters at the levels of optic chiasm (D 0 ), 200 microns (D 200 ) and 400 microns (D 400 ) anterior to the chiasm were measured. The following equation was used to calculate the total optic nerve volume from the sum of each 200-micron segment for a truncated cone as previously mentioned ( Hegedus et al., 2008 ):  V 1  = 1/12πh(D 0 2  + D 0 D 200  + D 200 2 ) Apoptosis was examined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay (TUNEL assay, Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, while proliferation was evaluated by Ki-67 staining, as described previously ( Hegedus et al., 2008 ). 2.8 Statistical Analyses Two-tailed  t -tests were used for CXCL12 ELISA analysis as well as for the analysis of differences in apoptosis and proliferation induced by AMD3100.",Tao Sun; Scott M Gianino; Erin Jackson; David Piwnica-Worms; David H Gutmann; Joshua B Rubin,Journal of neuroimmunology,2010-07-27,10.1016/j.jneuroim.2010.05.002,minimal,True
PMID:34230196,Reliability of Handheld Dynamometry to Measure Focal Muscle Weakness in Neurofibromatosis Types 1 and 2.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine a suitable outcome measure for assessing muscle strength in neurofibromatosis (NF) type 1 and NF2 clinical trials, we evaluated the intraobserver reliability of handheld dynamometry (HHD) and developed consensus recommendations for its use in NF clinical trials. METHODS: Patients ≥5 years of age with weakness in at least 1 muscle group by manual muscle testing (MMT) were eligible. Maximal isometric muscle strength of a weak muscle group and the biceps of the dominant arm was measured by HHD. An average of 3 repetitions per session was used as an observation, and 3 sessions with rest period between each were performed on the same day by a single observer. Intrasession and intersession intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and coefficients of variation (CVs) were calculated to assess reliability and measurement error. RESULTS: Twenty patients with NF1 and 13 with NF2 were enrolled; median age was 12 years (interquartile range [IQR] 9-17 years) and 29 years (IQR 22-38 years), respectively. By MMT, weak muscle strength ranged from 2-/5 to 4+/5. Biceps strength was 5/5 in all patients. Intersession ICCs for the weak muscles were 0.98 and 0.99 in the NF1 and NF2 cohorts, respectively, and for biceps were 0.97 and 0.97, respectively. The median CVs for average session strength were 5.4% (IQR 2.6%-7.3%) and 2.9% (IQR 2.0%-6.2%) for weak muscles and biceps, respectively. CONCLUSION: HHD performed by a trained examiner with a well-defined protocol is a reliable technique to measure muscle strength in NF1 and NF2. Recommendations for strength testing in NF1 and NF2 trials are provided.",,Srivandana Akshintala; Nashwa Khalil; Kaleb Yohay; Alona Muzikansky; Jeffrey Allen; Anna Yaffe; Andrea M Gross; Michael J Fisher; Jaishri O Blakeley; Beverly Oberlander; Miriam Pudel; Celia Engelson; Jaime Obletz; Carole Mitchell; Brigitte C Widemann; David A Stevenson; Scott R Plotkin,Neurology,2021-08-17,10.1212/WNL.0000000000012439,abstract_only,False
PMID:22384355,The SPRED1 Variants Repository for Legius Syndrome.,"Legius syndrome (LS) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by germline loss-of-function mutations in the sprouty-related, EVH1 domain containing 1 (SPRED1) gene. The phenotype of LS is multiple café au lait macules (CALM) with other commonly reported manifestations, including intertriginous freckling, lipomas, macrocephaly, and learning disabilities including ADHD and developmental delays. Since the earliest signs of LS and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) syndrome are pigmentary findings, the two are indistinguishable and individuals with LS may meet the National Institutes of Health diagnostic criteria for NF1 syndrome. However, individuals are not known to have an increased risk for developing tumors (compared with NF1 patients). It is therefore important to fully characterize the phenotype differences between NF1 and LS because the prognoses of these two disorders differ greatly. We have developed a mutation database that characterizes the known variants in the SPRED1 gene in an effort to facilitate this process for testing and interpreting results. This database is free to the public and will be updated quarterly.","Methods Data sources and limitations The  SPRED1  database was constructed using gene sequence variation data published in the scientific literature since the  SPRED1  gene was first identified in patients with a NF1-like phenotype but with no identifiable  NF1  gene mutation in 2007 ( Brems  ). To date, 78 sequence variants have been found by searching PubMed ( et al.  2007 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez ) and Google ( http://google.com/ ). Search terms included  SPRED1 ,  Legius syndrome , and  NF1-like syndrome . Occasionally, laboratory-sequencing results that identify novel gene variants are also included in this archive. The database was constructed using the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) and Human Genome Organization (HUGO) Mutation Database Initiative recommendations for essential and optional content ( http://www.hgvs.org/mdifaq.html ). HGVS nomenclature recommendations for description of sequence variants were used to generate DNA and protein changes for this database. Reference sequences for this database were GenBank  NC_000015.9 , NM_1525940.2, and  NP_689807.1 ; entries were verified for position and name based on these sequences. All sequence variants in the database (including future updates) are named based on their position in relation to the coding regions of the  SPRED1  gene (cDNA) following recommendations listed by the HGVS ( http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen ) and described in  Den Dunnen and Antonarakis (2000) . To comply with sequence variant nomenclature according to the guidelines of the Human Genome Variation Society, the online batch position check tool Mutalyzer 2.0 ( http://www.mutalyzer.nl/ ) was used to confirm genomic position of all  SPRED1  gene variants ( Wildeman  ). et al.  2008 Software SQL tables (MySQL, Inc.) were organized to represent  SPRED1  mutation status, associated phenotype, literature references, and any known clinical information. PHP coding was performed in-house for dynamic HTML display to render pages and display SQL tables. Graphics were generated using FusionCharts v3 ( www.fusioncharts.com ). Web pages are hosted on a Mac OS X Apache server.

PMID:37446790,Icariin Promotes Osteogenic Differentiation in a Cell Model with NF1 Gene Knockout by Activating the cAMP/PKA/CREB Pathway.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder, with up to 50% of patients clinically displaying skeletal defects. Currently, the pathogenesis of bone disorders in NF1 patients is unclear, and there are no effective preventive and treatment measures. In this study, we found that knockout of the NF1 gene reduced cAMP levels and osteogenic differentiation in an osteoblast model, and icariin activated the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway to promote osteoblast differentiation of the NF1 gene knockout cell model by increasing intracellular cAMP levels. The PKA selective inhibitor H89 significantly impaired the stimulatory effect of icariin on osteogenesis in the NF1 cell model. In this study, an osteoblast model of NF1 was successfully constructed, and icariin was applied to the cell model for the first time. The results will help to elucidate the molecular mechanism of NF1 bone disease and provide new ideas for the clinical prevention and treatment of NF1 bone disease and drug development in the future.","4. Materials and Methods Reagents. Icariin reagents (purity >99%) were purchased from the National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products (Beijing, China) and dissolved in DMSO. H89 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). BMP2 was purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ, USA). Puromycin was purchased from Solarbio (Beijing, China). Antibodies against GAPDH (cat. no. 5174S), phosphorylated PKA (cat. no. 5661S), PKA (cat. no. 4782S), phosphorylated CREB (cat. no. 9198S) and CREB (cat. no. 9197T) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). Antibody against neurofibromin (cat. no. ab17963) was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). CRISPR/Cas9 single-vector lentivirus was purchased from GeneChem (Shanghai, China). Cell culture. The C2C12 line is a subclone of a mouse myoblast cell line. These cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, CA, USA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in 5% CO 2  at 37 °C. Cells were seeded; on the second day, the cells were differentiated by replacing the medium with a differentiation medium (DMEM containing 5% FBS and 300 ng/mL BMP2). Icariin was complimentary added at 10 −5  M. The culture media were replaced every two days. Virus transfection. When the confluence of C2C12 cells in the six-well plate reached approximately 40%, and the cells were in good condition, transfection was performed. An appropriate volume of CRISPR/Cas9 single-vector lentivirus solution with an MOI value of 200 (the highest transfection efficiency) was gently mixed into the 6-well plate. The 6-well plates were cultured in 5% CO 2  at 37 °C. Puromycin screening of stable cell lines. The C2C12 cells transfected with CRISPR/Cas9 single-vector lentivirus for 72 h were collected, the old medium was discarded, and the cells were washed three times with PBS. An appropriate volume of 3 µg/mL puromycin (optimal concentration) was added to the 6-well plate, mixed, and cultured in an incubator. The fresh medium was replaced every two days. After 4–5 days of screening, the negative control cells died. After ten days of screening, the transfected cells stopped dying and grew well. Next, the cells were frozen for later use. Limited dilution method for selection of monoclonal clones. C2C12 cells were digested with trypsin to a concentration of 5 × 10 4 –10 5  cells/mL. Then, 100 μL of growth medium (15% serum concentration) was added to each well of a 96-well plate except for well A1. Next, 200 μL of cell suspension was added to well A1, and 100 μL was removed and added to well B1 for doubling dilution. This process was performed until H1. Then, 100 μL of growth medium was added to each well from A1 to H1, and 100 μL of cell suspension was aspirated from wells A1 to H1 in column 1 and added to wells A2 to H2 in column 2 for doubling dilution. This process was repeated until column 12. Finally, the working volume was set to 200 μL. After the monoclonal cells grew, subsequent identification was performed. Genome sequencing. Primers were designed and constructed upstream and downstream of the sgRNA target sites, and the sequences of the primers are shown in  Table 2 . After the genomic DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Mini kit (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, the target gene was immediately amplified by PCR. The amplification conditions were 94 °C for 5 min, 94 °C for 30 s, and 30 cycles of 55 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s. The PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to verify that the target band was in the correct position. Finally, the target band was purified and recovered for sequencing. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining. Cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 2 × 10 4  cells per well and incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 37 °C and 5% CO 2 . Cells were cultured in BMP2 with or without icariin at confluence for 1, 3, 5 and 7 days. At the end of culturing, the cells were gently washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and washed three times with PBS. Subsequently, the cells were permeated by a mixture of ethanol and acetone for 1 min. Finally, the cells were stained with an ALP stain kit (Wako, Japan) at 37 °C for 30 min. When necessary, excess moisture was removed from the wells, and nuclear staining was performed. The cells were observed under a microscope (EVIDENT, Tokyo, Japan) and photographed. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assay. Cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 2 × 10 4  cells per well and incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 37 °C and 5% CO 2 . Cells were cultured in BMP2 with or without icariin at confluence for 1, 3, 5 and 7 days. At the end of culturing, cells were gently washed twice with PBS and then lysed with 0.2% Triton X-100, and the lysate was centrifuged at 14,000×  g  for 15 min. The supernatant was collected for the measurement of ALP activity by an ALP activity assay kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering, Nanjing, China), and the protein concentrations were determined by a BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Shanghai, China). Transcriptome sequencing. The gene expression profile of the 2-7 cell line during icariin-induced osteoblast differentiation was analyzed with RNA-seq technology. When cultures in 25 cm 2  culture bottles reached confluence, the medium was replaced by a differentiation medium with or without icariin, and incubation was continued for seven days. The total RNA of each sample was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Albuquerque, NM, USA). The quality of the RNA was assessed by Sangon Biotech Co. (Shanghai, China) and was confirmed to pass the quality standard for building a library. Sequencing libraries were generated using VAHTSTM mRNA-seq V2 Library Prep Kit for Illumina ®  following the manufacturer’s recommendations, and index codes were added to attribute sequences to each sample. MRNA was purified from total RNA using poly T oligo-attached magnetic beads. For the preferential selection of cDNA fragments that were 150~200 bp in length, the library fragments were purified with the AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter, Beverly, CA, USA). Finally, PCR products were purified (AMPure XP system), and the libraries were quantified and pooled. After RNA-seq library construction, paired-end sequencing of the library was performed on HiSeq XTen sequencers (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). DESeq2 (version 1.12.4) was used to determine differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between two samples. Genes were considered to be significantly differentially expressed with q-value < 0.001 and |FoldChange| > 2. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed to identify which DEGs were significantly enriched in GO terms or metabolic pathways. Raw and processed sequencing data files are deposited in NCBI’s SRA (PRJNA913629). cAMP assay. When cultures in 24-well plates reached confluence, the medium was replaced by a differentiation medium with or without icariin, and incubation was continued for 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 120 min. At the end of culturing, cells were gently washed twice with PBS and then lysed with cell lysis buffer, and the lysate was centrifuged at 600×  g  for 10 min. Then, we determined the amounts of cAMP in wells with a cAMP enzyme immunoassay system (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. qRT-PCR analysis. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates and treated with BMP2 (300 ng/mL or absent), ICA (10 −5  M or absent) and H89 (10 −5  M or absent) for 1, 3, 5 and 7 days. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Albuquerque, NM, USA) according to the manual. Then, the RNA samples were reverse transcribed into cDNA using a PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (TaKaRa, Japan). Real-time quantitative PCR detection was performed to determine the mRNA expression levels of NF1, ALP, Runx2, Osx and Col1a1 with FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master (Rox) on a LightCycler ®  480 II Real-Time PCR System (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The conditions were 95 °C for 5 min, 95 °C for 30 s, and 45 cycles of 60 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 45 s. All reactions were run in triplicate, and data were analyzed using the 2 −ΔΔCt  method normalized to GAPDH. The primer sequences are listed in  Table 3 . Western blot analysis. Cells seeded in 25 cm 2  culture bottles were lysed with cold RIPA Lysate reagent (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The protein concentrations were measured with the BCA assay kit. Proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to 0.45 µm PVDF membranes (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Hesse-Darmstadt, Germany). After the membranes were blocked, they were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the diluted primary antibodies against the following molecules: neurofibromin, PKA, phosphorylated PKA, CREB, phosphorylated CREB and GAPDH. Then, the membranes were washed with TBST and incubated with diluted secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, we visualized the membranes with an enhanced ECL substrate kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) on the Fusion SOLO S (Vilber, Collegien, France). Immunofluorescence staining.  Cells were seeded on coverslips in 24-well plates, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, and washed thrice with PBS. Then, the cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 20 min. Subsequently, the cells were blocked in 5% goat serum for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with an anti-phosphorylated PKA antibody overnight at 4 °C. The next day, we rewarmed the cells at room temperature for 1 h and then incubated the cells with a goat anti-rabbit conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at 37 °C in the dark. Finally, the cells were incubated with DAPI for 5 min. The slides were examined using a 3D scanner (3D HISTECH, Budapest, Hungary). Statistical analysis.  All data are expressed as the mean ± SD. Each treatment group had at least three replicates (n = 3), and each experiment was repeated three times.

PMID:6810767,Café-au-lait spots in schoolchildren.,"This paper reports a study of café-au-lait spots of a minimum diameter of 1 cm in 732 white schoolchildren. Three groups were identified, according to the number of café-au-lait spots on each child: (1) those with none (74%), (2) those with fewer than 5 (25%), and (3) those with at least 5 (5 children, 2 considered to be normal, and 3 siblings each presumed to have neurofibromatosis, one having died from leukaemia). Excluding the last group, the number of café-au-lait spots in the sample was not significantly related to age or sex. Some support is given for using the number of café-au-lait spots as an empirical threshold to diagnose neurofibromatosis.",,R G Burwell; N J James; D I Johnston,Archives of disease in childhood,1982-08,10.1136/adc.57.8.631,abstract_only,False
PMID:40862755,Fibroblasts Attenuate Anti-Tumor Drug Efficacy in Tumor Cells via Paracrine Interactions with Tumor Cells in 3D Plexiform Neurofibroma Cultures.,"Plexiform neurofibromas (hereafter called pNF1) are often diagnosed in early childhood and occur in about 30% of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients. pNF1 exhibits aggressive growth along a nerve in the body and has substantial potential for progression to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors that are rarely curable. There are two recently FDA-approved drugs, selumetinib and mirdametinib, for pNF1 patients who have symptomatic and inoperable plexiform neurofibromas; however, these treatments achieve only approximately 30% tumor shrinkage. Fibroblasts, the most abundant cell types within the pNF1 tumor microenvironment, are implicated in pNF1 growth and invasion; however, how fibroblasts affect a drug response of pNF1 remains poorly understood. In the present study, we focused on contributions of fibroblasts to the drug resistance in pNF1 via their secretome. We employed our established three-dimensional (3D) culture system incorporating human pNF1 tumor cells (","2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Reagents and Antibodies Reconstituted basement membrane (rBM; Cultrex TM  with reduced growth factor) and high-concentration collagen I (rat tail) were purchased from Bio-Techne (Minneapolis, MN, USA) and Corning (Corning, NY, USA), respectively. Phenol red-free Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) and MycoZap TM  Plus-CL were purchased from Lonza (Basel, Switzerland). Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was obtained from Cytiva (Marlborough, MA, USA). Selumetinib (AZD6244), mirdametinib (PD0325901), and tariquidar (XR9576) were purchased from Selleckchem (Houston, TX, USA). L-glutamine and all other chemicals unless otherwise stated were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Fluorescent dyes and LIVE/DEAD TM  Viability/Cytotoxicity kit, Hoechst33342, and 4′-6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), were purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). Anti-P-glycoprotein primary antibody and Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK; ab170904) and Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA, USA), respectively. 2.2. Cells and Cell Maintenance The following immortalized human plexiform neurofibroma cell lines ( Nf1 −/− ; hereafter called pNF1 cells) described in [ 23 ] were used: ipNF95.11b C and ipNF05.5 purchased from ATCC. Primary fibroblasts ( Nf1 +/− , hereafter called fibroblasts) from pNF1 patients were purchased from Dr. Margaret Wallace, University of Florida (Gainesville, FL, USA). Cells were maintained as monolayers at 37 °C, 5% CO 2  in DMEM/high glucose supplemented with 10% FBS. Routine screening ensured the absence of mycoplasma contamination. 2.3. Three-Dimensional (3D)/4D (3D in Real-Time) Culture Models We employed 3D cultures grown in the patented microfluidic culture devices called TAME (tissue architecture and microenvironment engineering; Patent# US10227556B2) chips [ 24 ] for all experiments in the present study as previously reported [ 22 , 23 ]. Details for fabrication and prototypes of TAME chips with separate or linked wells [ 24 ] and the protocols for 3D monocultures and 3D parallel cocultures [ 25 ] were described in our previous report. For 3D monocultures of pNF1 cells and fibroblasts, cells were seeded on rBM, Cultrex TM /collagen I mixture, on the glass bottom culture well of the TAME chips with separate wells overlaid with 2% rBM in DMEM and grown for 5 days. For 3D pNF1 cell/fibroblast parallel cocultures, pNF1 cells and fibroblasts were plated on top of rBM in each well of TAME chips with linked wells, followed by 2% rBM in DMEM. A seeding ratio of 1 pNF1 tumor cell to ½ or ¼ fibroblast was used for 3D parallel cocultures. Prior to 3D live-cell imaging, nuclei were stained with Hoechst33342 to assess cell conditions by visualizing the integrity and morphology of the cell nuclei and to quantify total live-cell number with live-cell markers (e.g., Calcein AM). 2.4. Image Acquisition for Quantitative Analysis in 3D Optical sections spanning the full depth of the 3D structures were acquired from four contiguous fields (2 × 2) using either an upright Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Jena, Germany) housed within a temperature- and CO 2 -controlled environmental chamber or an inverted Leica Stellaris 5 system (Leica Microsystems, Deerfield, IL, USA) equipped with a Tokai Hit stage-top incubator (Tokai Hit, Shizuoka, Japan) to maintain physiological conditions. Image stacks were processed and reconstructed in 3D using Volocity software (Version 7.0.0; PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) for visualization and quantification of live/dead cell distributions. The spatial orientation within reconstructed volumes is indicated by x (green), y (red), and z (blue) arrows displayed in the lower corner of each image. 2.5. Drug Treatments Cells were seeded and cultured for 1 day to allow the settlement of cells in 3D rBM. On day 1, media were replaced, and drugs, including selumetinib [ 7 , 8 ] (10 μM) or mirdametinib [ 9 , 10 ] (1 μM), the only FDA-approved drugs for pNF1 treatment, and/or XR9576 [ 26 , 27 ] (0.1 μM), a specific P-glycoprotein inhibitor, were treated in 3D cell cultures for 4 days. 2.6. Live-Cell LIVE/DEAD TM  Assay 3D cultures were incubated with Calcein AM (live cells, green) for 30 min at 37 °C and washed once with warm PBS, then warm culture media were added according to the manufacturer’s recommended protocols and previously published reports [ 28 , 29 , 30 ]. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst33342 prior to live-cell imaging to confirm the cell conditions such as nuclear condensation and to quantify live cell number accurately. Cells were imaged live on the confocal microscopes. The number of live cells was calculated by counting the number of intact and healthy nuclei (appearing as evenly stained and spherical, not condensed and fragmented) overlapped with Calcein AM-stained cells in 3D using Volocity. 2.7. Generation of Fibroblast-Conditioned Media (CM) Details for generation of Fibroblast-CM were described in our previous report [ 22 ]. Briefly, fibroblasts (1 × 10 6  cells in a 60 mm culture dish) were cultured in fresh DMEM for 5 days. Fibroblast-conditioned media (Fib-CM) were collected and centrifuged at 1800×  g  to remove debris, and the resulting supernatants were aliquoted to minimize freeze–thaw cycles. Both Fib-CM and cell-free control media (CtrlM) were stored at −20 °C until use. 2.8. Immunofluorescence Staining We adapted the Sloane group’s immunostaining method for 3D cultures [ 29 ]. Cells were cultured for 5 days in 3D cultures as monocultures, pNF1:Fibroblast parallel cocultures, or in media supplemented with CtrlM or Fib-CM. Following incubation, they were fixed with 10% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature (RT), washed with warm PBS, and permeabilized for 5 min using 0.2% Triton X-100 in warm PBS. The cells were blocked with 1% BSA for an hour at RT, incubated with primary antibody (P-glycoprotein) for 3 h at RT, then treated with fluorescent secondary antibody for an hour at RT. DAPI was used for nuclear staining. Images were captured using an inverted Stellaris 5 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems). Fluorescence intensity of P-glycoprotein was quantified using ImageJ 1.54g software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). 2.9. 3D MTT Assay 3D MTT assay was used to assess cell growth and viability as previously described [ 22 ]. Briefly, 1.2 × 10 4  pNF1 cells were seeded in 150 μL media of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS on 3D rBM, with an additional 2% rBM overlay per well (triplicate or quadruplicate). On day 1, the media were replaced with fresh DMEM (3% FBS), and designated drug treatments were applied. After 4 days of drug treatments (day 5), MTT solution was added, and cells were incubated for 3 h to allow formazan formation. The resulting crystals were solubilized overnight at 37 °C in a solution of 10% SDS and 0.01% HCl, facilitating extraction from both the cells and surrounding rBM. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm with background correction at 690 nm using a SpectraMax Plus 384 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). 2.10. Statistical Analysis Data are presented as bar graphs with individual data points, representing the mean ± standard deviation (SD) from at least three independent experiments. The number of replicates is provided in each corresponding figure legend. Statistical significance was assessed using either one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test for multiple group comparisons or Student’s t-test for comparisons between two groups. A  p -value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant throughout the study.",Kyungmin Ji; George J Schwenkel,Cells,2025-08-18,10.3390/cells14161276,minimal,True
PMID:18272679,Neurofibromin is required for barrel formation in the mouse somatosensory cortex.,"The rodent barrel cortex is a useful system to study the role of genes and neuronal activity in the patterning of the nervous system. Several genes encoding either intracellular signaling molecules or neurotransmitter receptors are required for barrel formation. Neurofibromin is a tumor suppressor protein that has Ras GTPase activity, thus attenuating the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and and PI-3 kinase (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) pathways, and is mutated in humans with the condition neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Neurofibromin is widely expressed in the developing and adult nervous system, and a common feature of NF1 is deficits in intellectual development. In addition, NF1 is an uncommonly high disorder among individuals with autism. Thus, NF1 may have important roles in normal CNS development and function. To explore roles for neurofibromin in the development of the CNS, we took advantage of a mouse conditional allele. We show that mice that lack neurofibromin in the majority of cortical neurons and astrocytes fail to form cortical barrels in the somatosensory cortex, whereas segregation of thalamic axons within the somatosensory cortex appears unaffected.",,Mark E Lush; Yun Li; Chang-Hyuk Kwon; Jian Chen; Luis F Parada,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2008-02-13,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5236-07.2008,abstract_only,False
PMID:29958847,Radiomic biomarkers informative of cancerous transformation in neurofibromatosis-1 plexiform tumors.,"BACKGROUND: This study explores whether objective, quantitative radiomic biomarkers derived from magnetic resonance (MR), positron emission tomography (PET), and computed tomography (CT) may be useful in reliably distinguishing malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) from benign plexiform neurofibromas (PN). METHODS: A registration and segmentation pipeline was established using a cohort of NF1 patients with histopathological diagnosis of PN or MPNST, and medical imaging of the PN including MR and PET-CT. The corrected MR datasets were registered to the corresponding PET-CT via landmark-based registration. PET standard-uptake value (SUV) thresholds were used to guide segmentation of volumes of interest: MPNST-associated PET-hot regions (SUV≥3.5) and PN-associated PET-elevated regions (2.0<SUV<3.5). Quantitative imaging features were extracted from the MR, PET, and CT data and compared for statistical differences. Intensity histogram features included (mean, media, maximum, variance, full width at half maximum, entropy, kurtosis, and skewness), while image texture was quantified using Law's texture energy measures, grey-level co-occurrence matrices, and neighborhood grey-tone difference matrices. RESULTS: For each of the 20 NF1 subjects, a total of 320 features were extracted from the image data. Feature reduction and statistical testing identified 9 independent radiomic biomarkers from the MR data (4 intensity and 5 texture) and 4 PET (2 intensity and 2 texture) were different between the PET-hot versus PET-elevated volumes of interest. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests imaging features can be used to distinguish malignancy in NF1-realted tumors, which could improve MPNST risk assessment and positively impact clinical management of NF1 patients.","Methods. – A registration and segmentation pipeline was established using a cohort of NF1 patients with histopathological diagnosis of PN or MPNST, and medical imaging of the PN including MR and PET-CT.

Materials and methods Retrospective cohort development With Institutional Review Board approval, potential subjects were identified by the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics’ Neurofibromatosis Clinic. Subject demographics, imaging history, and surgical pathology records were recorded. PET-CT and MR imaging sets, with accompanying radiology reports, were collected and anonymized with subject study identifiers. Inclusion criteria for this study were:
 NF1 patient with PN; histopathology diagnosis of either MPNST or BPN and; PET-CT and MR of PN within 1 year prior to histopathological diagnosis. Segmentation pipeline development The pipeline for PN identification was developed in-house using the Insight Toolkit ( www.itk.org/ ) interfacing with the medical imaging visualization suite, Slicer ( www.slicer.org/ ) [ 18 , 19 ]. To briefly summarize the process of feature extraction: automated pre-processing steps were performed on each scan to prime data for combination. Seed points were selected by the user to indicate both the PN location in PET and corresponding landmarks in CT and MR. Thresholding was applied to the PET scan to isolate SUV zones of the PN. Once aligned, the SUV mask was applied to CT and MR generating a scan-translational image set. A graphical overview of the segmentation process is detailed in  Fig. 1 . The pre-processing steps included conversion of the raw PET data to SUVs and the removal of signal from the skeletal system using the accompanying CT data. The raw PET data was converted to SUVs using the patient specific SUV scaling. The mathematical formulation for the SUV voxel-wise conversion is shown in  Equation (1) , where the voxel value is the raw PET counts of radioactive events, actual activity is the injected radiotracer activity at time of scan, and the dose calibration factor is a measure of scanner efficiency:
 (1) S U V ( k g m L ) = v o x e l     v a l u e ( a c t u a l    a c t i v i t y b o d y     w e i g h t ) + ( d o s e     c a l i b r a t i o n     f a c t o r + 10 6 ) Zones of similar uptake were generated from seed points placed in SUV intensive areas of the PN. A three-dimensional, 26-neighboorhood, connected thresholding filter was applied using these seed points to generate the SUV-based PN mask. Based on literature, a SUV ≥ 3.5 was selected to be the threshold for an intensive uptake (PET-hot), while a SUV between 2.0 and 3.5 was selected to be the threshold for a moderate uptake (PET-elevated) [ 5 ]. The MR scans were pre-processed to correct for signal intensity inhomogeneity caused by magnetic field imperfections using a multiplicative bias field correction of the log-transformed dataset [ 20 ]. Intensity standardization is required in MR imaging for meaningful comparisons between different scan acquisitions or subjects; the voxel values in the MR scans were normalized to muscle values within the same scan [ 21 ]. Using a set of user-placed, skeletal fiducial points, the PET-CT and MR series were aligned through rigid registration [ 22 ]. This pipeline resulted in four volumes of interest (VOIs): a CT and an MR corresponding to the PET-hot region and a CT and an MR corresponding to the PET-elevated region. Tissue without a connected PET-elevated signal (SUV < 2.0) was designated as normal, non-plexiform tissue and excluded from feature analysis. Quantitative imaging feature extraction and assessment Two classes of quantitative imaging features were extracted: intensity histogram and image texture feature. Intensity histogram features are common values computed in image processing. In addition, four measures of heterogeneity were extracted from the histogram: full width at half maximum, entropy, kurtosis, and skewness. Image texture was quantified using Law’s texture energy measures (LTEM), grey-level run length (GLRL), and neighborhood grey-tone difference matrices (NGTM) [ 23 – 25 ]. A statistical analysis module was used to determine difference between zones of the plexiform. Normality of the feature was tested using the Jarque-Bera normality test and the Levene’s test was used to test for equal variances between the sets [ 26 , 27 ]. A Student’s paired t-test compared the quantitative imaging features extracted from the PET-hot VOI to the PET-elevated VOI in the MPNST subjects. A second test was performed to compare the PET-elevated zones of MPNST and BPN subjects. Statistical significance was defined a P < 0.05. The correlated significant features can increase the final number of selected features with no new information gained; therefore feature reduction was performed using k-medoid clustering to remove statistically significant features were highly inter-correlated [ 28 ]. Statistical power test was performed for each of the significant features to check the sample size was adequate for the performed test (Statistical Solutions, LLC).",J Uthoff; F A De Stefano; K Panzer; B W Darbro; T S Sato; R Khanna; D E Quelle; D K Meyerholz; J Weimer; J C Sieren,Journal of neuroradiology = Journal de neuroradiologie,2019-05,10.1016/j.neurad.2018.05.006,minimal,True
PMID:28831766,NMR resonance assignments of the EVH1 domain of neurofibromin's recruitment factor Spred1.,"Neurofibromin and Sprouty-related EVH1 domain-containing protein 1 (Spred1) both act as negative regulators of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and are associated with the rare diseases Neurofibromatosis type 1 and Legius syndrome, respectively. Spred1 recruits the major GTPase activating protein (GAP) neurofibromin from the cytosol to the membrane in order to inactivate the small G protein Ras. These functions are dependent on the N-terminal EVH1 domain and the C-terminal Sprouty domain of Spred1 whereas the former specifically recognizes the GAP related domain of neurofibromin and the latter is responsible for membrane targeting. Within the GAP domain, Spred1 binding depends on the GAPex portion which is dispensable for Ras inactivation. In a first step towards the characterization of the Neurofibromin Spred1 interface in solution we assigned backbone and side chain ","Methods and experiments Sample preparation Construction of pET-Spred1(EVH1) encoding the EVH1 domain of human Spred1 (Ser13–Ser130) preceded by a non-native translation initiating methionine and a glycine which was inserted due to the cloning strategy has been described (Dunzendorfer-Matt et al.  2016 ). The plasmid was transformed into the  E. coli  strain BL21(DE3) Star (Invitrogen). A starter culture (2.5 mL) was prepared in Luria Bertani (LB) medium containing 100 µg/mL carbenicillin, which was incubated at 37 °C and 220 rpm for 6–8 h, then diluted (1:20 (v/v)) into the same medium and kept overnight under the same conditions. The next day, cells were collected by centrifugation (2000× g ) and resuspended in 1 L of minimal medium (M9) containing  13 C 6 -D-glucose and/or  15 NH 4 Cl (both Cambridge Isotope Laboratories), supplemented with 100 µg/mL carbenicillin. The culture was incubated at 37 °C and 220 rpm until the cell density reached about 0.2 measured photometrically at 600 nm. The temperature was shifted to 16 °C and incubation was continued overnight. Protein expression was induced by the addition of IPTG (isopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranosid, 1 mM) and performed for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3200× g  and 4 °C for 30 min, resuspended in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) using 50 mL buffer per liter of bacterial culture multiplied with the absorption at 600 nm. Suspensions were shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. Expression as well as the following preparation steps of Spred1(EVH1) were monitored by SDS-PAGE. For lysate preparation, suspensions were pre-treated with Lysozyme and DNAse I (10 and 1 µg/mL final concentrations, respectively) and subsequently passed through a French press. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation (15,000× g , 4 °C, 40 min) and loaded onto a cation exchange column (HiTrap SP FF 5 mL, GE Healthcare). Elution of Spred1(EVH1) was achieved by applying a sodium chloride gradient in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5). Spred1(EVH1)-containing fractions were concentrated to a volume of 1–2 mL by centrifugation (Vivaspin Turbo 10 kDa MWCO, Sartorius) and loaded onto a size exclusion column (HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 prep grade, GE Healthcare) equilibrated in a buffer containing 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.5), 50 mM sodium chloride, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. Spred1(EVH1)-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated to 0.6 or 0.8 mM ( 15 N labeled or  15 N/ 13 C labeled samples, respectively) and supplemented with 10% D 2 O (v/v) for NMR data collection. NMR spectroscopy All NMR experiments were performed at 25 °C on a 500 MHz Agilent DirectDrive 2 spectrometer equipped with a room temperature probe. For backbone resonance assignments  1 H- 15 N-HSQC and three-dimensional HNCO, HNCACB and CBCA(CO)NH experiments were performed. Side-chain assignments were obtained by using  1 H- 13 C-HSQC and three-dimensional (H)CC(CO)NH-TOCSY, H(CC)(CO)NH-TOCSY,  1 H- 15 N-TOCSY-HSQC,  1 H- 15 N-NOESY-HSQC and  1 H- 13 C-NOESY-HSQC experiments. Collected data were processed with NMRPipe (Delaglio et al.  1995 ) and analyzed by using CcpNMR (Vranken et al.  2005 ) software. Assignments and data deposition Excluding the N-terminal methionine and the non-native glycine we have assigned 112 of 113 non-proline residues in the  1 H- 15 N-HSQC spectrum of Spred1(EVH1) (Fig.  1 ) corresponding to 99% completeness. Full (100%) assignment of C α  and C β  resonances was achieved, while backbone C’ assignments are 95% complete. In addition, 69, 62, and 30% of side-chain C γ , C δ , and C ε , respectively were assigned. Regarding protons, 99% of the H α  and H β  resonances along with 93, 67, and 50% of H γ , H δ , and H ε  resonances, respectively, were assigned. Spred1(EVH1) chemical shift data have been deposited at the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank ( http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu ) under the Accession Number 27162.

Assigned residues are indicated using  single letter codes . Signals labeled by  asterisks  represent aliased signals, while those labeled with  two asterisks  likely derive from arginine side-chain ε-NH resonances.  Horizontal lines  indicate asparagine and glutamine side-chain NH 2  resonances.  Numbering  of the Spred1(EVH1) domain corresponds to the full length human Spred1 sequence ( NP_689807.1 ) A TALOS+ prediction (Shen et al.  2009 ) was conducted using the H N , N, C’, C α , and C β  chemical shifts of the protein and indicated secondary structure elements of Spred1(EVH1) (Fig.  2 ) that are consistent with the crystallographic data (Harmer et al.  2005 ; PDB: 3SYX, unpublished data), i.e. seven consecutive β-strands (β1–β7), where β2 is split into two segments β2 and β2′, along with the C-terminal α-helix. Of note, the NMR chemical shift data indicate that the loop between strands β3 and β4 has a moderate propensity for α-helical structure. In future experiments we will use the chemical shift data and address the function of patient-derived mutations in the interaction with neurofibromin.

PMID:24681606,Co-targeting the MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways in two genetically engineered mouse models of schwann cell tumors reduces tumor grade and multiplicity.,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are soft tissue sarcomas that occur spontaneously, or from benign plexiform neurofibromas, in the context of the genetic disorder Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1). The current standard treatment includes surgical resection, high-dose chemotherapy, and/or radiation. To date, most targeted therapies have failed to demonstrate effectiveness against plexiform neurofibromas and MPNSTs. Recently, several studies suggested that the mTOR and MAPK pathways are involved in the formation and progression of MPNSTs. Everolimus (RAD001) inhibits the mTOR and is currently FDA approved for several types of solid tumors. PD-0325901 (PD-901) inhibits MEK, a component of the MAPK pathway, and is currently in clinical trials. Here, we show in vitro than MPNST cell lines are more sensitive to inhibition of cellular growth by Everolimus and PD-901 than immortalized human Schwann cells. In combination, these drugs synergistically inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis. In two genetically engineered mouse models of MPNST formation, modeling both sporadic and NF1-associated MPNSTs, Everolimus, or PD-901 treatment alone each transiently reduced tumor burden and size, and extended lifespan. However, prolonged treatment of each single agent resulted in the development of resistance and reactivation of target pathways. Combination therapy using Everolimus and PD-901 had synergistic effects on reducing tumor burden and size, and increased lifespan. Combination therapy allowed persistent and prolonged reduction in signaling through both pathways. These data suggest that co-targeting mTOR and MEK may be effective in patients with sporadic or NF1-associated MPNSTs.","MATERIALS AND METHODS Tissue Culture Reagents and Cell Lines Cultured immortalized Schwann cells (iHSC1λ and iHSC2λ) were both derived from a patient's normal sciatic nerve, are  NF1  wild-type, and were immortalized by  hTERT  and  CDK4 R24C  to allow  in vitro  studies [ 33 ]. Immortalized human Schwann cell and MPNST cell lines (S462 [ 34 ], S462-TY [ 35 ], ST8814 [ 36 ], T265 [ 37 ], and STS-26T [ 38 ]) were maintained in Dulbecco's Modification of Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin (Cellgro) and cultured on tissue culture-treated plates under standard conditions of 37°C and 5% CO2. In Vitro  Drug Studies to Determine 50% Inhibitory Concentration (IC50) and Combination Index (CI) Everolimus and PD-901 were solubilized in DMSO and then subsequently diluted in sterile PBS. 1,200 cells per well of a 96-well plate were treated with varying concentration of drug in quadruplicate and assayed for cell viability using the MTS assay (Promega) to determine the IC50 values, 48 hours after drug treatment. Drug was added at the time of cell plating. All data analysis was done using Calcusyn software (CalcuSyn Version 2.1, BioSoft). A combination of Everolimus and PD-901 at varying dilutions of their IC50 concentration was used to determine the combination index (CI) using Calcusyn software (CalcuSyn © Version 2.1, BioSoft). Generation of Transgenic Animals and PCR Genotyping Generation of transgenic animals and PCR genotyping were done as previously described [ 12 ,  13 ]. In Vivo  Drug Studies Everolimus and PD-901 were solubilized in DMSO and then subsequently diluted in PBS and sterilized. Mice were weighed daily and given 10 mg/kg/day of Everolimus or 5 mg/kg/day of PD-901. For combination studies mice were given 5 mg/kg/day of Everolimus and 2.5 mg/kg/day of PD-901 at the same time. Mice were weighed and monitored daily, and sacrificed when they became moribund. Tumors, nerves, and organs were harvested for immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. All animal work was conducted according to the University of Minnesota's approved animal welfare protocol. Peripheral Nerve Tumor Analysis Tumors were carefully removed from the sacrificed animal under a dissecting microscope (Leica), washed, and placed in cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Sciatic nerves, brachial plexi, sacral plexi, trigeminal nerves, spinal cord, brain, and liver were also removed and observed for any abnormalities. The number of enlarged dorsal root ganglia was counted for the whole spinal cord. All tumor nodules (>1 mm in diameter) were carefully removed from the spinal cord. Hematoxylin and eosin staining Tissues were fixed in 10% formalin, routinely processed, and embedded in paraffin. Sections for histology were cut at five microns from the paraffin blocks using a standard microtome (Leica), mounted and heat fixed onto glass slides. Slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) using standard protocols. Mouse Tumor Immunohistochemistry (IHC) Immunohistochemistry was done as previously described [ 12 ,  13 ]. Formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissues were sectioned at five microns, mounted, and heat-fixed onto glass slides to be used for IHC analyses. The glass section slides were de-waxed and rehydrated through a gradual decrease in ethanol concentration. The antigen epitopes on the tissue sections were then unmasked using a commercially available unmasking solution (Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The tissue section slides were then treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide to remove endogenous peroxidases. Blocking was performed at room temperature in normal goat serum (5% serum in PBS) in a humidified chamber for one hour. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4°C in a humidified chamber with primary antibody (S100 (Santa Cruz 1:100), Ki67 (Novocastra 1:200)). After primary incubation, sections were washed thoroughly in PBS before incubating with goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugated-secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After three washes with PBS, the sections were treated with freshly prepared DAB substrate (Vector Laboratories) and allowed to develop before stopping the reaction in water once adequate signal was obtained. Finally, sections were then lightly counter-stained with hematoxylin, dehydrated through gradual increase in ethanol concentration, cleared in Xylene (Fisher Scientific) and mounted in Permount (Fisher Scientific). Histologic Evaluation Sections stained with H&E, Ki67 and S100β were evaluated for all tumors. Each sample was graded using established criteria for tumors arising in genetically engineered mice [ 43 ,  44 ]. Briefly, low-grade PNSTs exhibited low cellularity with little if any nuclear atypia and mitotic activity. High-grade PNSTs were increasingly cellular with increasing nuclear atypia and increasing mitotic activity. Immunofluorescence and TUNEL staining For immunofluorescence assays, cells were grown to 80% confluency on 8 chambered slides (Lab-TekII). Cells were fixed in 10% formalin and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST). TUNEL staining was performed using the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, POD (Roche). Slides were mounted using Prolong Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen) and images using a Zeiss Axiovert 25 inverted microscope. For analysis of cell death, total cells and TUNEL positive cells were counted and averaged over three independent frames with 50-100 cells per frame. Western Blot Analysis One million cells were lysed using an NP-40 buffer (50mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 150mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 5mM NaF, 1mM EDTA) containing a protease inhibitor (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma). Whole cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation. Protein samples were prepared in an SDS solution with reducing agent (Invitrogen) and run on 10% Bis-Tris pre-made gels (NuPage, Invitrogen). Gels were transferred onto PVDF membranes using the iBlot system (Invitrogen) and activated in 100% methanol. Membranes were blocked in filtered 5% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) for 2 hours at room temp followed by a 4°C overnight incubation in primary antibody. The primary antibodies used in this study were: p-AKT S473 (Cell Signaling 1:100), p-4EBP (Cell Signaling 1:500), p-ERK (Cell Signaling 1:1000), and GAPDH (Cell Signaling 1:2000). Following primary antibody incubation, membranes were thoroughly washed in Tris Buffered Saline (TBS) with 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) and incubated in goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz, 1:4000 in 0.5% BSA, 1 hour at room temperature). Blots were thoroughly washed in TBST and developed using the SuperSignal WestPico Chemiluminescence Detection Kit (Thermo Scientific). Densitometry quantification was done using ImageJ software and normalized to GAPDH [ 55 ].",Adrienne L Watson; Leah K Anderson; Andrew D Greeley; Vincent W Keng; Eric P Rahrmann; Amanda L Halfond; Natasha M Powell; Margaret H Collins; Tilat Rizvi; Christopher L Moertel; Nancy Ratner; David A Largaespada,Oncotarget,2014-03-30,10.18632/oncotarget.1609,minimal,True
PMID:32107864,Expanding the Noonan spectrum/RASopathy NGS panel: Benefits of adding NF1 and SPRED1.,"BACKGROUND: RASopathies are a group of disorders caused by disruptions to the RAS-MAPK pathway. Despite being in the same pathway, Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) and Legius syndrome (LS) typically present with phenotypes distinct from Noonan spectrum disorders (NSDs). However, some NF1/LS individuals also exhibit NSD phenotypes, often referred to as Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome (NFNS), and may be mistakenly evaluated for NSDs, delaying diagnosis, and affecting patient management. METHODS: A derivation cohort of 28 patients with a prior negative NSD panel and either NFNS or a suspicion of NSD and café-au-lait spots underwent NF1 and SPRED1 sequencing. To further determine the utility and burden of adding these genes, a validation cohort of 505 patients with a suspected RASopathy were tested on a 14-gene RASopathy-associated panel. RESULTS: In the derivation cohort, six (21%) patients had disease-causing NF1 or SPRED1 variants. In the validation cohort, 11 (2%) patients had disease-causing variants and 15 (3%) had variants of uncertain significance in NF1 or SPRED1. Of those with disease-causing variants, 5/17 only had an NSD diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Adding NF1 and SPRED1 to RASopathy panels can speed diagnosis and improve patient management, without significantly increasing the burden of inconclusive results.","Methods A derivation cohort of 28 patients with a prior negative NSD panel and either NFNS or a suspicion of NSD and café‐au‐lait spots underwent  NF1  and  SPRED1  sequencing. To further determine the utility and burden of adding these genes, a validation cohort of 505 patients with a suspected RASopathy were tested on a 14‐gene RASopathy‐associated panel. 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Ethical Compliance This study was approved by Partner's Healthcare Institutional Review Board. 2.2 Study Population The derivation cohort included 28 deidentified patients with a suspicion of NSD and cafe‐au‐lait spots or NFNS, who previously tested negative for an NSD gene panel. Their ages ranged from 8 months to 35 years, with a mean age of 6.8 years. Twenty‐one patients were negative for variants in eight RASopathy‐associated genes ( BRAF ,  HRAS ,  KRAS ,  MAP2K1 ,  MAP2K2 ,  PTPN11 ,  RAF1 , and  SOS1 ), while seven patients were negative for variants in 10 RASopathy‐associated genes ( CBL  and  NRAS  in addition to the previous eight). The validation cohort included 505 patients with a clinical diagnosis or suspicion of a RASopathy and no prior molecular testing for RASopathies. Their ages ranged from 1 month to 54 years, with a mean age of 9.7 years. The validation cohort was tested using a 14‐gene panel that included the  NF1  and  SPRED1  (see Table  S1  for complete gene list). 2.3 Sequencing DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples using PureGene Blood Core Kit B (Qiagen). For the derivation cohort, 28 DNA samples were tested using next generation sequencing (NGS) of the  NF1  ( NM_000267.3 ) and  SPRED1  ( NM_152594.3 ) genes. For the validation cohort, all 505 samples were tested using next generation sequencing (NGS) of 14 RASopathy‐associated genes (Table  S1 ) as previously described (Pugh et al.,  2014 ). Briefly, NGS was performed by oligonucleotide hybridization‐based DNA capture (SureSelect; Agilent) followed by sequencing using the MiSeq‐M01450 instrument (150‐base paired end mode; Illumina). Sequence reads were aligned to the reference sequence (GRCh37) using bwa‐mem v0.7.10, followed by variant calling using GATK, version 1.0.4705 (McKenna et al.,  2010 ). For the validation cohort, Sanger sequencing was used to confirm all clinically significant variants and fill in regions with insufficient coverage. Methods used for polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing have been previously described (Zimmerman et al.,  2010 ). Copy number variants (CNVs) were identified via an NGS‐based detection tool (VisCap) (Pugh et al.,  2016 ), but were only available for 23 patients in the derivation cohort and 281 patients in the validation cohort due to NGS data quality. Confirmation of CNVs was done using ddPCR as previously described (Ceyhan‐Birsoy et al.,  2015 ). 2.4 Variant classification Variant classification was based on the 2015 guidelines by the American College of Medical Genetics and the Association of Molecular Pathology (Richards et al.,  2015 ). Variants of uncertain significance (VUS) were further subcategorized into three categories: VUS‐favor pathogenic when there is a suspicion of a pathogenicity, VUS‐favor benign when the evidence suggests the variant does not contribute to disease, and VUS when there is a lack of or conflicting evidence. Although clinical features observed in our cohorts were not used to classify the identified variants, physician‐reported clinical findings in patients with pathogenic or likely pathogenic  NF1  or  SPRED1  variants are described in Tables  1  and  2 .

PMID:21460792,Orthotopic xenografting of human luciferase-tagged malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor cells for in vivo testing of candidate therapeutic agents.,"Although in vitro screens are essential for the initial identification of candidate therapeutic agents, a rigorous assessment of the drug's ability to inhibit tumor growth must be performed in a suitable animal model. The type of animal model that is best for this purpose is a topic of intense discussion. Some evidence indicates that preclinical trials examining drug effects on tumors arising in transgenic mice are more predictive of clinical outcome(1)and so candidate therapeutic agents are often tested in these models. Unfortunately, transgenic models are not available for many tumor types. Further, transgenic models often have other limitations such as concerns as to how well the mouse tumor models its human counterpart, incomplete penetrance of the tumor phenotype and an inability to predict when tumors will develop. Consequently, many investigators use xenograft models (human tumor cells grafted into immunodeficient mice) for preclinical trials if appropriate transgenic tumor models are not available. Even if transgenic models are available, they are often partnered with xenograft models as the latter facilitate rapid determination of therapeutic ranges. Further, this partnership allows a comparison of the effectiveness of the agent in transgenic tumors and genuine human tumor cells. Historically, xenografting has often been performed by injecting tumor cells subcutaneously (ectopic xenografts). This technique is rapid and reproducible, relatively inexpensive and allows continuous quantitation of tumor growth during the therapeutic period(2). However, the subcutaneous space is not the normal microenvironment for most neoplasms and so results obtained with ectopic xenografting can be misleading due to factors such as an absence of organ-specific expression of host tissue and tumor genes. It has thus been strongly recommended that ectopic grafting studies be replaced or complemented by studies in which human tumor cells are grafted into their tissue of origin (orthotopic xenografting)(2). Unfortunately, implementation of this recommendation is often thwarted by the fact that orthotopic xenografting methodologies have not yet been developed for many tumor types. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are highly aggressive sarcomas that occur sporadically or in association with neurofibromatosis type 1(3) and most commonly arise in the sciatic nerve(4). Here we describe a technically straightforward method in which firefly luciferase-tagged human MPNST cells are orthopically xenografted into the sciatic nerve of immunodeficient mice. Our approach to assessing the success of the grafting procedure in individual animals and subsequent non-biased randomization into study groups is also discussed.",,Amy N Turk; Stephanie J Byer; Kurt R Zinn; Steven L Carroll,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2011-03-07,10.3791/2558,abstract_only,False
PMID:23960073,"FRAX597, a small molecule inhibitor of the p21-activated kinases, inhibits tumorigenesis of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2)-associated Schwannomas.","The p21-activated kinases (PAKs) are immediate downstream effectors of the Rac/Cdc42 small G-proteins and implicated in promoting tumorigenesis in various types of cancer including breast and lung carcinomas. Recent studies have established a requirement for the PAKs in the pathogenesis of Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), a dominantly inherited cancer disorder caused by mutations at the NF2 gene locus. Merlin, the protein product of the NF2 gene, has been shown to negatively regulate signaling through the PAKs and the tumor suppressive functions of Merlin are mediated, at least in part, through inhibition of the PAKs. Knockdown of PAK1 and PAK2 expression, through RNAi-based approaches, impairs the proliferation of NF2-null schwannoma cells in culture and inhibits their ability to form tumors in vivo. These data implicate the PAKs as potential therapeutic targets. High-throughput screening of a library of small molecules combined with a structure-activity relationship approach resulted in the identification of FRAX597, a small-molecule pyridopyrimidinone, as a potent inhibitor of the group I PAKs. Crystallographic characterization of the FRAX597/PAK1 complex identifies a phenyl ring that traverses the gatekeeper residue and positions the thiazole in the back cavity of the ATP binding site, a site rarely targeted by kinase inhibitors. FRAX597 inhibits the proliferation of NF2-deficient schwannoma cells in culture and displayed potent anti-tumor activity in vivo, impairing schwannoma development in an orthotopic model of NF2. These studies identify a novel class of orally available ATP-competitive Group I PAK inhibitors with significant potential for the treatment of NF2 and other cancers.",,Silvia Licciulli; Jasna Maksimoska; Chun Zhou; Scott Troutman; Smitha Kota; Qin Liu; Sergio Duron; David Campbell; Jonathan Chernoff; Jeffrey Field; Ronen Marmorstein; Joseph L Kissil,The Journal of biological chemistry,2013-10-04,10.1074/jbc.M113.510933,abstract_only,False
PMID:38990917,Optical coherence tomography of the macular ganglion cell layer in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 is a useful tool in the assessment for optic pathway gliomas.,"BACKGROUND: Optic pathway glioma (OPG) is a feared complication to neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) since it can cause visual impairment in young children. The main goal of screening is to detect symptomatic OPGs that require treatment. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been suggested as a tool for detection of neuro-retinal damage. AIMS: To investigate whether the ganglion cell layer assessed by OCT is a reliable measure to identify and detect relapses of symptomatic OPGs in children with NF1. METHODS: Children (3-6 years) with NF1, with and without known OPG and children with sporadic OPG (S-OPG) resident in the Stockholm area, were invited and followed in a prospective study during a three-year period. Brain magnetic resonance tomography (MRI) had been performed in children with symptoms of OPG. Outcome measures were VA in logMAR, visual field index (VFI), average thicknesses of the ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL), and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL). RESULTS: There were 25 children with MRI-verified OPG and 52 with NF1 without symptomatic OPG. Eyes from NF1 patients without symptoms of OPG showed significantly better results in all four analyzed parameters compared to eyes with NF1-associated OPG. Mean GC-IPL measurements seemed stable and reliable, significantly correlated to pRNFL (correlation coefficient (r) = 0.662, confidence interval (CI) = .507 to .773 p<0.001), VA (r = -0.661, CI = -7.45 to -.551, p<0.001) and VFI (r = 0.644, CI = .452 to .774, p<0.001). GC-IPL measurements were easy to obtain and acquired at considerably younger age than pRNFL (5.6±1.5 vs 6.8±1.3; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The mean GC-IPL thickness could distinguish well between eyes with OPG and eyes without symptomatic OPG in children with NF1. As thinning of GC-IPL assessed with OCT could indicate underlying OPG, it should be included in the screening protocol of children with questionable VA measurements and in particular in children with NF1.","Methods Children (3–6 years) with NF1, with and without known OPG and children with sporadic OPG (S-OPG) resident in the Stockholm area, were invited and followed in a prospective study during a three-year period. Brain magnetic resonance tomography (MRI) had been performed in children with symptoms of OPG. Outcome measures were VA in logMAR, visual field index (VFI), average thicknesses of the ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL), and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL). Material and methods Patients Children (3–6 years) with NF1 without symptoms suggestive of OPG, children with NF1 and MRI-verified OPG as well as children with sporadic OPG (S-OPG) were consecutively invited and followed in a prospective study at Astrid Lindgren Children’s Hospital during a three-year period (first of January 2017- first of January 2020). All children were resident in the Stockholm area. Brain MRI was performed only in the presence of clinical symptoms suggestive of OPG. Children with NF1 without symptomatic OPG were followed according to a screening program prepared for the study purposes. The follow-up intervals for this group were as follows: every three months for children three to four years old, every six months for children five to six years old and yearly in children older than seven years. In the group with symptomatic and documented OPG the frequency of ophthalmological assessments depended on the degree of VI and the associated symptoms, as well as the MRI findings. Written informed consent from the parents/custodians was obtained before study enrollment. Ethical approval was obtained (2016/1749-31/4). A retrospective review was performed on all patients with OPG followed/treated in the Pediatric Oncology and/or Pediatric Neurosurgical Department at Astrid Lindgren’s Childrens’ Hospital at Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm from first of January 2009 until first of January 2020 (study end). Patient data were obtained from medical documentation: clinical manifestation at the time of diagnosis (VI, neurological and/or endocrinological symptoms), age at OPG diagnosis, MRI findings (initial location and extension of the tumor as well as radiologic progression or regression), criteria to start treatment (visual decline or other), treatment regime (surgery, chemotherapy) as well as age at treatments and additional information such as cognitive deficit, specific learning problems, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or autism spectrum disorders among patients with NF1. Magnetic resonance imaging Retrospective analyses of OPG localization at the time of diagnosis were performed as previously described [ 18 ]. Thereafter, baseline MRI images were compared with all subsequent MRI images (from diagnosis to the end of the study) to see whether changes (progression or regression) resulted in treatment changes. The changes on MRI were recorded as progression or regression. Of those who performed 1.5T, 40% repeated the examination at 3T (the rest repeated at 1.5T). Of those who performed 3T, 60% repeated the emanation at 3T while the rest were followed with 1.5T. Groups Eyes with age-normal VA and no VF defects were considered having no symptoms suggestive of OPG and thus the child did not undergo MRI, if no other clinical symptom (not ophthalmological) suggested otherwise. Three groups of eyes were determined: 1) Group “NF1 noOPG”; eyes without symptoms suggestive of OPG in patients with NF1. This group included both eyes from asymptomatic patients screened for OPG without having undergone MRI as well as the unaffected eye from NF1 patients with MRI verified unilateral OPG spread limited to the contralateral optic nerve. 2) Group “NF1-OPG”; eyes with MRI-verified NF1-associated OPG and 3) group “S-OPG”; eyes with MRI-verified sporadic OPG. Subjects underwent age-appropriate VA assessments, neuro-retinal measurements using OCT and automated VF examination. Outcome measures were VA, average GC-IPL, average pRNFL thicknesses and visual field index (VFI). The tumor-free eye from the cases with sporadic OPG, that is not NF1, were excluded from analyses. Visual acuity measurement Monocular VA was quantitively measured at as a young age as possible. In the youngest group VA was assessed with Teller acuity cards or Cardiff acuity cards [ 19 , 20 ] while older children were tested with Lea or KM (Konstantin Moutakis) cards [ 21 , 22 ]. Visual acuity was reported as logMAR units (higher logMAR values corresponding to lower VA). Maximum VA on the chart was -0.3. Prespecified values were used to describe qualitative VA: counting fingers (CF = 2.0), hand movement (HM = 2.5), light perception (LP = 3.0) and no light perception (NLP = 3.5) as previously shown [ 23 ]. In children ≥4 years of age VA at initial visit was compared with World Health Organization Categories of Childhood VI scale for reference. In children <4 years of age, mild VI was not defined but moderate VI was defined as > 0.5 VA = < 1.0 and severe VI as >1.0 VA = <1.7, in accordance to our previous study [ 18 ]. HD-OCT procedure Optical coherence tomography images were obtained using Cirrus HD-OCT device (Cirrus; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA, USA). Cirrus uses ganglion cell + inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) to assess thickness of Ganglion Cell Layer therefore GC-IPL never gets thinner than measurement floor that is 31–45 μm [ 24 ]. The floor effect is obtained due to architectural support of IPL. Macular Cube 512×128 or 200×200 scan protocol and automated GC‐IPL analysis segmentation algorithm and optic disc 200×200 protocol incorporated into the Cirrus 6.0 software were used. The average GC-IPL and pRNFL thicknesses were studied and groups compared. Visual field assessment Visual fields were assessed with the Humphrey Field Analyzer perimetry as previously described [ 18 ]. The VFI is a single number that summarizes each patient’s visual field status as a percentage of the normal age-corrected sensitivity. It is approximately 100% in normal fields and approaches 0% in perimetrically blind fields. It provides improved correspondence to ganglion cell loss compared to mean deviation [ 25 ]. Statistics Descriptive statistics are presented as means and standard deviations (SD). T-test was used to report statistical difference between age at OPG diagnosis among children with NF1-associated OPG and sporadic OPG, age difference between first reliable VA and VF examination and between first reliable OCT examinations. The Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) of statistical package SPSS (ver.26) was used to compare the groups. The dependent variables were the VA, GC-IPL, pRNFL and VFI. The fixed factors were OPG group, age, the random factor was the examination time. Pairwise contrasts test was used to evaluate the difference between the NF1-OPG and NF1 noOPG groups.

PMID:35037337,Neurofibromatosis type 2 versus sporadic vestibular schwannoma: The utility of MR diffusion and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to assess the utility of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) to distinguish sporadic vestibular schwannomas (VSs) from those related to neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 265 patients pathologically diagnosed with VSs between January 2015 and October 2020 in a single institution. There were 28 patients (male: 19, female: 9; age 11-67 years) including 23 sporadic and five NF2-related VSs, who had pretreatment DWI and DCE-MRI. Normalized mean apparent diffusion coefficient (nADCmean) and DCE-MRI parameters along with tumor characteristics were compared between sporadic and NF2-related VSs as appropriate. The diagnostic performances were calculated based on the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for the values that showed significant differences. To identify significant modalities, multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed using nADCmean and the combination of statistically significant DCE-MRI parameters. RESULTS: NADCmean, fractional volume of extracellular space (Ve), and forward volume transfer constant (Ktrans) were significantly different between sporadic and NF2-related VSs (nADCmean: median 1.62 vs. 1.16, P = .002; Ve: median 0.40 vs. 0.66, P = .007; Ktrans: median 0.17 vs. 0.33, P = .007), whereas fractional plasma volume (Vp), reverse reflux rate constant (Kep), and tumor characteristics were not. The diagnostic performances of nADCmean, Ve, and Ktrans were 0.93, 0.90, and 0.90 area under the curves with cutoffs of 1.46, 0.51, and 0.29, respectively. nADCmean and the combination of Ve and Ktrans were both chosen as significant differentiators by multivariate logistic regression analysis (P = .027). CONCLUSIONS: DWI and DCE-MRI are both promising modalities to distinguish sporadic and NF2-related VSs.",,Yoshiaki Ota; Eric Liao; Aristides A Capizzano; Akira Baba; Ryo Kurokawa; Mariko Kurokawa; Ashok Srinivasan,Journal of neuroimaging : official journal of the American Society of Neuroimaging,2022-05,10.1111/jon.12966,abstract_only,False
PMID:25074460,Neurofibromatosis type 1 molecular diagnosis: what can NGS do for you when you have a large gene with loss of function mutations?,"Molecular diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is challenging owing to the large size of the tumour suppressor gene NF1, and the lack of mutation hotspots. A somatic alteration of the wild-type NF1 allele is observed in NF1-associated tumours. Genetic heterogeneity in NF1 was confirmed in patients with SPRED1 mutations. Here, we present a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of NF1 and SPRED1 using a multiplex PCR approach (230 amplicons of ∼150 bp) on a PGM sequencer. The chip capacity allowed mixing 48 bar-coded samples in a 4-day workflow. We validated the NGS approach by retrospectively testing 30 NF1-mutated samples, and then prospectively analysed 279 patients in routine diagnosis. On average, 98.5% of all targeted bases were covered by at least 20X and 96% by at least 100X. An NF1 or SPRED1 alteration was found in 246/279 (88%) and 10/279 (4%) patients, respectively. Genotyping throughput was increased over 10 times, as compared with Sanger, with ∼90[euro ] for consumables per sample. Interestingly, our targeted NGS approach also provided quantitative information based on sequencing depth allowing identification of multiexons deletion or duplication. We then addressed the NF1 somatic mutation detection sensitivity in mosaic NF1 patients and tumours.",,Eric Pasmant; Béatrice Parfait; Armelle Luscan; Philippe Goussard; Audrey Briand-Suleau; Ingrid Laurendeau; Corinne Fouveaut; Chrystel Leroy; Annelore Montadert; Pierre Wolkenstein; Michel Vidaud; Dominique Vidaud,European journal of human genetics : EJHG,2015-05,10.1038/ejhg.2014.145,abstract_only,False
PMID:6417334,Linkage analysis of neurofibromatosis (von Recklinghausen disease).,"Linkage analysis of 28 genetic markers was undertaken in 108 subjects from 11 families with well-documented, classic, peripheral neurofibromatosis. Fifty-four persons were affected in one four-generation family, seven three-generation families, and three two-generation families. Lod scores were calculated using the standard LIPED programme for 49 combinations of theta male and theta female from 0.01 to 0.50. Lod scores excluded close linkage with 16 markers, including most tested on chromosome 1 and HLA on chromosome 6, and were inconclusive for 12 markers, including the secretor locus, closely linked to myotonic dystrophy. Analysis of five informative families resulted in a lod score of +2.2 for close linkage with GC on chromosome 4. However, the lod score for GC in the one additional informative family was negative, so that the final interpolated maximum was Z = 0.89 for theta male = 0.03, theta female = 0.28. Further studies are needed to evaluate this suggestion of linkage and possible genetic heterogeneity.",,M A Spence; J L Bader; D M Parry; L L Field; S J Funderburk; A E Rubenstein; P A Gilman; R S Sparkes,Journal of medical genetics,1983-10,10.1136/jmg.20.5.334,abstract_only,False
PMID:2491775,Genetic analysis of eight loci tightly linked to neurofibromatosis 1.,"The genetic locus for neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) has recently been mapped to the pericentromeric region of chromosome 17. We have genotyped eight previously identified RFLP probes on 50 NF1 families to determine the placement of the NF1 locus relative to the RFLP loci. Thirty-eight recombination events in the pericentromeric region were identified, eight involving crossovers between NF1 and loci on either chromosomal arm. Multipoint linkage analysis resulted in the unique placement of six loci at odds greater than 100:1 in the order of pter-A10-41-EW301-NF1-EW207-CRI-L581-CRI-L946 -qter. Owing to insufficient crossovers, three loci--D17Z1, EW206, and EW203--could not be uniquely localized. In this region female recombination rates were significantly higher than those of males. These data were part of a joint study aimed at the localization of both NF1 and tightly linked pericentromeric markers for chromosome 17.",,K Stephens; P Green; V M Riccardi; S Ng; M Rising; D Barker; J K Darby; K M Falls; F S Collins; H F Willard,American journal of human genetics,1989-01,,abstract_only,False
PMID:37276689,Health-related quality of life of children with neurofibromatosis type 1: Analysis of proxy-rated PedsQL and CHQ questionnaires.,"This study aims to (1) investigate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in children with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) using the Pediatric Quality of Life inventory (PedsQL) and the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ); and (2) compare the psychometric properties and content of these questionnaires in NF1 patients. PedsQL and CHQ proxy-reports were administered to parents/caregivers of 160 patients with NF1 aged 5-12 years. HRQoL scores were compared with Dutch population norms using independent t-tests. Psychometric properties (feasibility and reliability) were assessed by floor/ceiling effects and Cronbach's alpha coefficient. A principal component analysis (PCA) with varimax rotation was performed to identify the data's internal structure. By content mapping, we identified unique constructs of each questionnaire. Proxy-reported HRQoL was significantly lower on all PedsQL subscales for children aged 5-7 years, and on 4/6 subscales for children aged 8-12 years compared to norms. Significantly lower HRQoL was reported on 6/14 CHQ subscales (children 5-7 years) and 9/14 subscales (children 8-12 years). The PedsQL showed slightly better feasibility and reliability. The PCA identified two components, representing psychosocial and physical aspects of HRQoL, explaining 63% of total variance. Both questionnaires showed relevant loadings on both components. The CHQ subscales concerning parents and family were considered unique contributions. Proxy-reported HRQoL of children with NF1 is significantly lower compared to norms on multiple domains. Both questionnaires adequately measure HRQoL in children with NF1. However, the PedsQL has slightly better psychometric properties, while the CHQ covers a unique dimension of HRQoL associated with disease impact on parents and family.",,Britt A E Dhaenens; André Rietman; Olga Husson; Rianne Oostenbrink,European journal of paediatric neurology : EJPN : official journal of the European Paediatric Neurology Society,2023-07,10.1016/j.ejpn.2023.05.010,abstract_only,False
PMID:37353850,Burden of adult neurofibromatosis 1 questionnaire: translation and psychometric properties of the Persian version.,"BACKGROUND: The notion of ""burden"" has taken a key place in the evaluation of care, particularly in the case of rare diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the burden of neurofibromatosis 1 questionnaire (BoN) and to determine the perceived disease burden. RESULTS: The 15-item BoN was translated into Persian, and no items were removed based on content validity. The adequacy of the sample was acceptable (KMO = 0.902), and Bartlett's test of sphericity revealed statistically significant results (P < 0.001). Exploratory factor analysis revealed three factors. The reliability of the scale was good (Cronbach's alpha: 0.90), and the intraclass coefficient was 0.85. The severity of the burden of neurofibromatosis was moderate, and the total mean burden score was 33.12 ± 16.12.

PMID:33625502,"Efficacy of a Brief, Peer-Delivered Self-management Intervention for Patients With Rare Chronic Diseases: A Randomized Clinical Trial.","IMPORTANCE: Patients coping with rare diseases need psychosocial support. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of a brief, transdiagnostic, peer-delivered intervention for patients with rare diseases in addition to care as usual (CAU) compared with CAU only. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this 2-group randomized clinical trial conducted from October 5, 2017, to July 12, 2019, patients were recruited via specialized clinics and patient organizations across Germany and participated from home. The study included consecutive adult patients with neurofibromatosis type 1, Marfan syndrome, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and pulmonary arterial hypertension who have limited functionality because of the disease. Exclusion criteria were a life-threatening health status and ongoing psychotherapeutic treatment. Of 143 patients screened for eligibility with a semistructured telephone interview, 54 were excluded, and 89 were randomized: 45 patients were randomly allocated to the peer-delivered intervention group, and 44 to the control group; 87 patients (98%) completed the 6-month follow-up assessment. The analysis was performed using an intention-to-treat principle. Data cleansing and analysis were conducted between April 25, 2019, and February 13, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: The 6-week intervention consisted of a self-help book and telephone-based peer counseling in addition to CAU. The control group received CAU alone. Peer counselors received training, structured consultation guidelines, and supervision. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was acceptance of the disease as assessed using the Illness Cognition Questionnaire (ICQ; mean sum scores range from 0 to 18, with higher values representing more acceptance) 6 months after the intervention. Secondary outcomes included self-reported coping strategies (Health Education Impact Questionnaire), illness cognition (ICQ and Illness Perception Questionnaire), depression severity (Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item depression scale), anxiety severity (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale), quality of life (12-Item Short-Form Health Survey), and social support (Social Support Questionnaire). Outcomes were assessed before the intervention, after the intervention, and at a 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of the 89 participating patients was 46.3 (14.9) years; 59 (66%) were women. There were no group differences regarding baseline variables. All patients allocated to the intervention group completed the intervention. Six months after the intervention, but not directly after completing the program, the intervention group had significantly higher rates of acceptance (ICQ) of the disease (primary outcome) compared with the CAU group. Mean (SD) baseline ICQ scores were 9.61 (3.79) in the control group and 9.86 (3.40) in the intervention group. Mean (SE) ICQ scores at 6 months were 10.32 (0.42) for the control group and 11.79 (0.42) for the intervention group, with a significant mean difference of -1.47 (95% CI, -2.63 to -0.31; P = .01). Several secondary outcomes, including different coping strategies, social support, and mental quality of life, were significantly higher after the intervention compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, a self-help and peer counseling intervention improved patients' acceptance of their rare chronic diseases. Self-management and peer support can efficiently address the unique care needs of patients with rare diseases.

PMID:8659521,Genotyping of PCR-based polymorphisms and linkage-disequilibrium analysis at the NF1 locus.,"Six polymorphisms across the NF1 gene have been adapted for genotyping through application of PCR-based assays. Three exon-based polymorphisms--at positions 702, 2034, and 10647 in the NF1 cDNA--were genotyped by mutagenically separated PCR (MS-PCR). A fourth polymorphism, DV1.9, is an L1 insertion element in intron 30, and the other two polymorphisms, GXAlu and EVI-20, are short tandem repeats in intron 27b. All the polymorphisms were evaluated in a cohort of 110 CEPH individuals who previously had been analyzed by use of eight RFLPs at the NF1 locus. Pairwise linkage-disequilibrium analyses with the six PCR-based polymorphisms and their flanking markers demonstrated disequilibrium between all tested loci. Genotypes of the four diallelic polymorphisms (702, 2034, 10647, and DV1.9) were also evaluated in cohorts from the CEPH, African, and Japanese populations. The CEPH and Japanese cohorts showed similar heterozygosities and linkage-disequilibrium coefficients.

PMID:22821737,The Learning Disabilities Network (LeaDNet): using neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) as a paradigm for translational research.,"Learning disabilities and other cognitive disorders represent one of the most important unmet medical needs and a significant source of lifelong disability. To accelerate progress in this area, an international consortium of researchers and clinicians, the Learning Disabilities Network (LeaDNet), was established in 2006. Initially, LeaDNet focused on neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a common single gene disorder with a frequency of 1:3,000. Although NF1 is best recognized as an inherited tumor predisposition syndrome, learning, cognitive, and neurobehavioral deficits account for significant morbidity in this condition and can have a profound impact on the quality of life of affected individuals. Recently, there have been groundbreaking advances in our understanding of the molecular, cellular, and neural systems underpinnings of NF1-associated learning deficits in animal models, which precipitated clinical trials using a molecularly targeted treatment for these deficits. However, much remains to be learned about the spectrum of cognitive, neurological, and psychiatric phenotypes associated with the NF1 clinical syndrome. In addition, there is a pressing need to accelerate the identification of specific clinical targets and treatments for these phenotypes. The successes with NF1 have allowed LeaDNet investigators to broaden their initial focus to other genetic disorders characterized by learning disabilities and cognitive deficits including other RASopathies (caused by changes in the Ras signaling pathway). The ultimate mission of LeaDNet is to leverage an international translational consortium of clinicians and neuroscientists to integrate bench-to-bedside knowledge across a broad range of cognitive genetic disorders, with the goal of accelerating the development of rational and biologically based treatments.",,Maria T Acosta; Carrie E Bearden; F Xavier Castellanos; Laurie Cutting; Ype Elgersma; Gerard Gioia; David H Gutmann; Yong-Seok Lee; Eric Legius; Maximillian Muenke; Kathryn North; Luis F Parada; Nancy Ratner; Kim Hunter-Schaedle; Alcino J Silva,American journal of medical genetics.

PMID:34257279,Neurofibromin regulates metabolic rate via neuronal mechanisms in Drosophila.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a chronic multisystemic genetic disorder that results from loss of function in the neurofibromin protein. Neurofibromin may regulate metabolism, though the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here we show that neurofibromin regulates metabolic homeostasis in Drosophila via a discrete neuronal circuit. Loss of neurofibromin increases metabolic rate via a Ras GAP-related domain-dependent mechanism, increases feeding homeostatically, and alters lipid stores and turnover kinetics. The increase in metabolic rate is independent of locomotor activity, and maps to a sparse subset of neurons. Stimulating these neurons increases metabolic rate, linking their dynamic activity state to metabolism over short time scales. Our results indicate that neurofibromin regulates metabolic rate via neuronal mechanisms, suggest that cellular and systemic metabolic alterations may represent a pathophysiological mechanism in neurofibromatosis type 1, and provide a platform for investigating the cellular role of neurofibromin in metabolic homeostasis.","Methods Drosophila  husbandry and stocks Flies were cultured on cornmeal/agar food medium according to standard protocol and housed at 25 °C, 60% relative humidity, on a 12:12 light:dark cycle. The  Nf1 P1  mutation was backcrossed six generations into the  w CS10  genetic background and  w CS10  flies were used as controls. Genetic control for  Nf1 P1/E1  trans-heterozygotes is  w CS10 /w iso2;3 . UAS-Nf1-eGFP transgenes were generated using an  Nf1  mini-gene (full-length  Nf1  cDNA corresponding to the RF isoform with addition of introns 9 and 10). The R1320P mutation was created in a wild-type cDNA using the Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (New England Biolabs). Wild-type and R1320P mutant  Nf1  were then subcloned into the pUAST-attB vector with an in-frame C-terminal fusion with eGFP cDNA. Transgenic lines were produced by integrating the constructs at the attp40 site (Rainbow Transgenic Flies Inc.) The Nf1 RNAi line was obtained from the Vienna  Drosophila  RNAi Center (VDRC #109637), Gal4/+ control crosses consisted of an empty attP control line (VDRC #60100). UAS-dicer2 was included to potentiate the RNAi effect , and was included with the UAS-RNAi (i.e., all experimental and UAS/+ genotypes). ERK was activated via expression of ERK with the gain-of-function mutation ERK 56 Sem  (UAS-rl Sem ) . The following lines were obtained from the Bloomington  57 Drosophila  Stock Center (BDSC): nSyb (BDSC #51635), R57C10 (39171), 69B (1774), tsh-Gal4 (3040), and Oct-TyrR-Gal4 (36494). PCB-Gal4 (fatbody-Gal4) was previously generated by Ronald Kühnlein, and Ras2 insertions by James Walker. Gal4 lines used in the screen were obtained from the BDSC or public sources. Male flies were used for all experiments to prevent egg accumulation in behavioral and respirometry chambers. CO 2  measurement using respirometry CO 2  production was measured with respirometry . Briefly, a 1 ml pipette tip and 50 µl capillary micropipette were securely glued together. Soda lime was placed into each pipette tip between two foam pieces to avoid contact with flies. Sixteen respirometers were hung on a custom-made rack in a latch-lid measurement chamber. Flies were anesthetized with CO 24 2  and allowed to recover for at least 24 h before beginning the experiment. Four flies of the same genotype were placed into each pipette using an aspirator and tightly sealed at the top using non-hardening modeling clay. Pipettes that were not tightly sealed were not included in final measurements. One pipette was left empty in each chamber as a temperature and atmospheric control. The measuring chamber was filled with a red-dye solution made with a water-based dye. The latch-lid chamber with flies were left to equilibrate to incubator conditions (25 °C) for 1 h before starting the experiment (unless otherwise stated). Vacuum grease was applied between the latch-lid and chamber to reduce atmospheric and temperature fluctuations. Images were captured every 15 min using a time-lapse image software (PhenoCapture 3.3) and analyzed using Fiji 2.0, measuring the liquid meniscus position in each capillary. This measurement was subtracted from a reference image and repeated at each time point for 3 h. Data were normalized by calculating the mean CO 2  production of control genotypes, and normalizing each data point to that value. Indirect calorimetry Metabolic rate and activity were measured using the Sleep and Activity Metabolic Monitor (SAMM) system (Sable Systems International). Group-housed adult flies were measured at 25 °C, through indirect calorimetry using a stop-flow, push-through respirometry system . Briefly, the experimental system assessed baseline CO 39 , 58 2  levels from an empty chamber to measure CO 2  production and O 2  consumption from 25 male adult flies. Air was flushed from each chamber for 50 sec to provide a readout of CO 2  accumulation and O 2  consumption over a 10-min period. A H 2 O and CO 2  scrubber was used to dehumidify and remove CO 2  from air before being pumped into a mass flow control valve to maintain a consistent flow rate. The air was then re-humidified by passing through a reservoir containing deionized water prior to reaching the behavioral chambers. Each behavioral chamber (70 mm long × 20 mm diameter glass tube) contained 25 adult male flies with a food vial containing 1% agar and 5% sucrose. Flies were allowed to acclimate to the system for 24 h before the start of each experiment. All experimental runs included a food-only control baseline chamber. CO 2  production was analyzed using a LI-7000 CO 2 /H 2 O Analyzer (LI-COR) and then dehumidified using an H 2 O scrubber before O 2  consumption was measured Oxilla Dual Absolute Differential Oxygen Analyzer (LI-COR). CO 2  production and O 2  consumption recordings were taken every 10 min. Respirometry quotient (RQ) was calculated as the volume of CO 2  eliminated/O 2  consumed. Western blot analysis For assessing expression of Nf1 and levels of pERK/ERK (Fig.  1e ), lysates of heads from 2 to 3-day old adult flies were prepared using IP buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 125 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.2% NP-40, 5% glycerol) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, Sigma) and phosphatase inhibitors (NaF/Na 3 VO 4 /β-glycerophosphate). Immunoprecipitations were performed using 400 µg of total protein in 1 ml IP buffer incubated with 200 μl of mAb21 anti-Nf1 monoclonal antibody supernatant  for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were precipitated with a mix of Protein A- and Protein G-Sepharose beads (1:1, Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C before washing three times with IP buffer and denaturing with 2× SDS sample buffer. Lysates and immunoprecipitates were resolved on NuPAGE 3–8% Tris-Acetate (for Nf1) or NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gels (pERK/ERK/β-tubulin). After transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, blots were processed according to the Odyssey CLx protocol (LI-COR). Antibodies used for immunoblotting were: anti-Nf1 (mouse, mAb21, 1:10), anti-phospho-ERK (mouse, Sigma M8159, 1:2500), total ERK (rabbit, CST 9102, 1:1000), anti-β-tubulin (mouse, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank E7, 1:10,000), anti-mouse IRDye secondary antibody (goat, Invitrogen, A32730, 1:10,000), and anti-rabbit IRDye (donkey, Invitrogen, A10043, 1:10,000) secondary antibody. 14 For assessing expression of Nf1-eGFP transgenes (Fig.  7c ), lysates of 5-day old adult fly heads were prepared using RIPA buffer supplemented with HALT protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermofisher Scientific). Protein samples were mixed with NuPAGE 4× LDS Sample Buffer (Invitrogen), resolved on NuPAGE 3–8% Tris-Acetate Protein Gels with NuPAGE Tris-Acetate SDS Running Buffer supplemented with NuPAGE Antioxidant. SDS-PAGE gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes and 5% BSA in TBST was used for blocking. Antibodies used were: rabbit anti-GFP (Invitrogen, A11122, 1:4000), and mouse anti-β-tubulin (DHSB, E7, 1:2000). The membranes were washed with TBST, followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature after the addition of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 711035152, 1:5000) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-Mouse IgG (H + L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 715035151, 1:5000). After washing, WesternBright Quantum HRP substrate (Advansta) was added to the membranes and images were captured with AlphaImager HP system (ProteinSimple), and analyzed using Fiji 2.0. Images of blots found in the Source Data file. Immunohistochemistry Five to seven-day-old PCB-Gal4 adult nervous systems were dissected in 1% paraformaldehyde in S2 medium and processed as previously described . Samples were stained with primary antibodies for 3 h at room temperature and at 4 °C overnight, followed by secondary antibodies for 3 h at room temperature and 4 d at 4 °C. Incubations were performed in blocking serum (3% normal goat serum). Samples were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) for analysis. The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-GFP (1:1000, Invitrogen), mouse anti-nc82 (1:50, DSHB), goat anti-rabbit IgG, and goat anti-mouse IgG (1:800, Alexa 488 or Alexa 633, respectively, Invitrogen). Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope with LAS X software was used to obtain images. 59 Total grooming Grooming was quantified with behavioral analysis in an open field . Individual animals were aspirated into an open field area, habituated for 15 min, and a 5-min video recording was recorded for analysis. Videos were collected using the Image Acquisition Tool in Matlab. Grooming was manually scored by watching videos frame-by-frame in Matlab R2015b and start and stop frames were recorded for each grooming event. Grooming was calculated as the percent of total time grooming during the 5-min video. 22 Coupled colorimetric assay for TAG Triglyceride content was quantified with a coupled colorimetric assay . Samples were rinsed in PBS, rapidly homogenized in PBST, and the supernatant was heated at 70 °C for 10 min. The glycerol standard solution (Sigma 2.5 mg/ml triolein equivalent glycerol standard; G7793) was prepared in PBST to generate glycerol standards. Glycerol standards, samples, and a PBST blank were then added to two microfuge tubes and the triglyceride reagent (Sigma; T2449) was added to one of the two tubes to free the glycerol backbone. All samples were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. Samples were transferred to a clear, flat bottom 96-well plate and free glycerol reagent (Sigma; F6428) was added to each sample. Absorbance was measured at 540 nm. TAG concentration per sample was determined by subtracting the absorbance for the free glycerol in untreated samples from the total glycerol concentration in samples with the triglyceride reagent and then normalized to sample weight. TAG content in each sample is based on the triolein-equivalent standard curve. 40 Lipid analysis Lipogenesis and lipolysis were measured in adult flies by following the incorporation of radiolabeled sucrose . Briefly, flies were fed with 5 µCi of  60 14 C- sucrose incorporated into standard fly food for 24 h. After 24 h, half of the flies were collected and frozen at −80 °C to measure lipogenesis (0 h samples). The remaining flies were transferred to unlabeled standard fly food for 48 h and then immediately frozen at −80 °C to measure lipolysis (48 h samples). All flies were transferred into pre-weighed 1.7 ml Eppendorf tubes and then weighed to obtain fly mass. Frozen samples were homogenized with 200 µl of 2:1 chloroform: methanol mix for 15 min at room temperature and then spun at full speed for 15 min at room temperature. The supernatant was recovered and 40 µl of 0.9% (w/v) of NaCl was added. Samples were vortexed and spun gently to separate phases. The upper phase was removed, and the interphase was rinsed twice with 200 µl 1:1 methanol: water solution without mixing. The lower chloroform phase was used for scintillation counting. Starvation survival Adult male flies (group housed, 20 flies/vial) on 1% (non-nutritional) agar. The percentage of flies alive was measured at least every 12 h. Feeding Feeding was quantified in adult male flies using a capillary feeding assay . Briefly, individual flies were placed into chambers (46 mm × 7 mm) containing 1% agar at the bottom and a glass capillary at the top. Each glass capillary contained a meniscus labeling dye to track food consumption and an aqueous food solution (2.5% sucrose + 2.5% yeast extract).

PMID:23685747,Forward genetic screen for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor formation identifies new genes and pathways driving tumorigenesis.,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are sarcomas of Schwann cell lineage origin that occur sporadically or in association with the inherited syndrome neurofibromatosis type 1. To identify genetic drivers of MPNST development, we used the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon-based somatic mutagenesis system in mice with somatic loss of transformation-related protein p53 (Trp53) function and/or overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Common insertion site (CIS) analysis of 269 neurofibromas and 106 MPNSTs identified 695 and 87 sites with a statistically significant number of recurrent transposon insertions, respectively. Comparison to human data sets identified new and known driver genes for MPNST formation at these sites. Pairwise co-occurrence analysis of CIS-associated genes identified many cooperating mutations that are enriched in Wnt/β-catenin, PI3K-AKT-mTOR and growth factor receptor signaling pathways. Lastly, we identified several new proto-oncogenes, including Foxr2 (encoding forkhead box R2), which we functionally validated as a proto-oncogene involved in MPNST maintenance.","ONLINE METHODS Transgenic animals and tumor isolation Three transgenes were used to induce SB mutagenesis in Schwann cells: a conditionally expressed  SB  transposase enzyme ( R26-lsl-SB11 ) , a Schwann cell specific Cre-recombinase controlled by the CNP promoter ( 35 Cnp-Cre ) , and a concatomer of oncogenic transposons (T2/Onc15) 38 . Triple transgenic mice ( 48 Cnp-Cre; R26-lsl-SB11; T2/Onc15 ) undergo insertional mutagenesis in Schwann cells. MPNST predisposing alleles,  Cnp-EGFR  and conditional  Trp53  alleles, were also included R270H . Mouse cohorts are shown in  41 , 42 Figure 1a . Genotyping PCR was performed on phenol-chloroform extracted mouse-tail DNA as previously described . 34 , 38 , 41 , 42 Peripheral nerves and tumors were resected, assessed, and histologically evaluated as previously described . Each sample was pathologically graded using established criteria for tumors generated in genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) 59 . Grade 1 PNSTs are called neurofibromas. Tumors with features of human MPNSTs (GEMM grade 3 PNSTs) are called grade 3 PNSTs. 75 Transposon Insertion Site Analysis DNA isolated from  SB -derived neurofibromas and grade 3 PNSTs underwent linker-mediated PCR to amplify transposon-genomic DNA junctions and were sequenced as previously described . Identification of TAPDANCE CISs and gene centric CISs from sequenced transposon-genomic DNA PCR products was performed as previously described 34 . The local-hopping phenomenon of T2/Onc was accounted for by excluding chromosome 15 (T2/Onc donor locus) from the analysis. Known CIS artifacts originating from the T2/Onc sequence elements ( 49 , 50 En2 ,  Foxf2 ) and amplified regions of the mouse genome ( Serinc3 ,  Sfi ) were also excluded . Thirty-three histologically normal nerves from SB mutagenized mice were sequenced to assess potential transposon integration hotspots; no CISs were identified. 48 , 49 Gene expression data analysis Published data (GEO accession #: GSE14038 , Affymetrix GeneChip HU133 Plus 2.0) were used for gene expression pattern analysis. For gene annotation, custom CDF (custom GeneChip library file) based on RefSeq target definitions (Hs133P REFSEQ Version 8) was downloaded and used to provide accurate interpretation of GeneChip data . 76 Statistical comparisons were done using R/Bioconductor packages and GeneSpring GX v7.3.1 (Agilent Technologies). Differentially expressed (DE)-genes were defined as genes with expression levels at least three-fold higher or lower in target groups (MPNST) compared to normal human Schwann cells (NHSCs) after applying Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate correction (FDR/BH p ≤ 0.05) . 77 MPNST whole-methylome data analysis Feber et al. published unbiased whole-methylome data of NHSCs, neurofibroma, and MPNST genomes (GEO accession #:  GSE21714 ) . We adopted the Feber et al. method for detecting differentially methylated regions (DMR) in MPNST compared to NHSC 53 . Briefly, Batman methylation scores per 100bp were averaged for each 1Kb window. A conservative threshold for DMR calling was used based on the 95th percentile of the difference in methylation score. DMR regions were mapped to human genome hg18 version (Build NCBI-36). 53 , 78 The nearest CpG island shores (CpG-IS) to the transcription start sites (TSS) of each gene/miRNA were scanned . We defined CpG-IS as areas up to 2Kb distant from CpG islands. We considered the nearest upstream CpG-IS from the transcription start site, within 5K bp ranges from each TSS. The genomic coordinates of miRNAs, genes, and CpG islands (NCBI36/hg18) were extracted from corresponding tracks of UCSC Genome Browser ( 53 , 78 http://genome.ucsc.edu ). For intragenic miRNAs, we assumed their expression is influenced by the nearest CpG-IS to the TSS of their host gene. Copy number alteration (CNA) data analysis CNA data on 51 primary MPNSTs were from the published GSE3388 data set (Agilent Human Genome CGH Microarray kit (4x44K) . A circular binary segmentation (CBS) algorithm was applied to the log2 ratios of intensity values from tumor and normal to reduce local noise effects. CBS calculates a likelihood-ratio statistic for each array probe by permutation to locate change-points 54 , 79 . After segmentation step, CGHcall algorithm was used to assign each segment an aberration label: gain, loss, or normal 80 . A visualization program was written in R to present overall gain/loss patterns of all 51 MPNSTs. We considered a given genomic region as significantly recurrent CNA region if the number of CNA labels (gain or loss) given to them exceeded a threshold of statistical significance that we estimated using a permutation test. Briefly, CNA labels, three state calls (gain/loss/normal) by CGHcall algorithm, of the targets were permuted 10,000 times to get distribution, and sums of gain or loss labels were computed for each target. The 95th percentile values for both sums (23 patients out of 51) were chosen as thresholds of statistically significant recurrent CNA. Genomic coordinates used in plots were based on hg19/GRCh37.p8 (R/Bioconductor biomaRt package) 81 . 82 SNP-Array Analysis SNP-array analysis was performed on 14 MPNST primary tumors using the Illumina Infinium technology (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Tumors were analyzed using the Illumina Human660W-Quad beadchip. The data were processed with GenoCNA to segment the genome and determine copy number status . 82 Tissue Microarray Representative areas of disease were identified on hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections for 30 dermal neurofibromas, 31 plexiform neurofibromas, and 32 MPNSTs. Blocks consisting of duplicate 1.0 mm core samples were constructed with a manual tissue arrayer (MTA-1, Beecher Inc, WI) with 64 cores per recipient block. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for FOXR2 (1:100, SIGMA) was performed utilizing an immunohistochemical staining platform (Nemesis 7200, Biocare) following standard IHC protocols . Digital images of IHC stained TMA slides were obtained as previously described by Rizzardi et al. 2012 83 . 84 Cell Culture/Assays Immortalized human Schwann cells (iHSCs) were acquired from the laboratory of Dr. Margaret Wallace. iHSCs and human MPNST cell lines (ST88-14, STS26T, S462, S462-TY, and T265) were cultured in complete media (1xDMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1x penicillin/streptomycin) and grown at 37°C in 5% CO 2 . shRNA GIPZ lentiviral constructs were purchased from Openbiosystems. Proliferation assays were setup in a 96-well plate format with 500 cells per well in full DMEM media containing 1ug/ml of puromycin (Life Technologies). Proliferation was assessed every 24 hours for 5 days using the MTS assay (Promega) following the manufacturer’s protocols. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Soft agar anchorage independent colony formation assays were carried out as previously described . After 2 weeks of growth, cells were fixed in 10% formalin containing 0.005% Crystal Violet for 1 hour at room temperature. Formalin was removed and colonies were imaged on a Leica S8 AP0 microscope. Twelve images per cell line were taken and automated colony counts were done using ImageJ software. 85 FOXR2  overexpression construct FOXR2  cDNA (Open Biosystems) was cloned into the Gateway Vector System (Invitrogen) and subcloned into a  piggyBac  ( PB ) transposon vector. The  PB  control vector contains the  Luciferase  and  Gfp  reporter genes. Cells were transfected with 2ug of  FOXR2  or  Luciferase PB  transposon ( Supplementary Fig. 8a ) and 500ng of PB7 transposase plasmid using the NEON transfection system following manufacturers protocols (Invitrogen). Successfully transfected cells were enriched with 1ug/ml puromycin. Generation of TALEN Knockout Cell Lines TALENs targeting  FOXR2  were designed using TALE-NT and constructed as previously described . An  86 – 88 HPRT  TALEN pair served as a control . TALENs were assembled using Golden Gate cloning with the truncated Δ152+63 TALEN backbone 86 . Assembled TALENs were tested by transient transfection into K562 cells using the NEON electroporation system (Invitrogen) and subsequent CEL-I assay 86 , 89 . 90 Knockout cell lines were generated using the  PB  Co-transposition method ( Moriarity et al ., unpublished data). Briefly, cells were electroporated with plasmids encoding the left and right TALENs, the hyperactive  PB7  transposase, and Puromycin encoding transposon vectors. TALEN-treated cells were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 1 day followed by two days of ‘cold shock’ at 30°C to increase nuclease activity . Cells were seeded at 50 cells per well in 96 well plates with Puromycin containing DMEM. Single cell clones were expanded, DNA was extracted, and CEL-I PCR was performed with amplicons sequenced via standard single pass Sanger sequencing (ACGT, Inc). Individual clone sequence data were analyzed for insertion/deletions (indels) formed by non-homologous end joining at the TALEN cut site and were classified as wildtype (WT), knockout (KO), or mutation detected (MD). Mutation detected clones were further analyzed by standard TOPO cloning and sequencing to determine the indels at each allele. 91 Quantitative-PCR analysis 1ug of total RNA was DNase (Life Technologies) treated and used for reverse transcription with the Super Script III first strand synthesis kit (Life Technologies) following manufacturer’s protocol. qPCR reactions utilized the LightCycler 480 SYBR I Green (Roche) and were analyzed on an Eppendorf Mastercycler ep gradient S. Primers are listed in  Supplementary Table 12 . Data were analyzed using the RealPlex software, calibrated to  ACTB  levels, and normalized to respective controls. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence FOXR2 protein was detected in whole cell lysates harvested with modified RIPA buffer (0.5% (vol/vol) NP-40, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) containing phosphatase inhibitors (SIGMA) and a complete mini protease inhibitor pellet (Roche). Lysates were separated on a 10% resolving gel, transferred to PVDF membrane, and probed with antibodies against FOXR2 (SIGMA) and GAPDH (Cell Signaling Tech.) following manufacturers’ protocols. Immunofluorescence on tissue sections and cell lines with antibodies probing FOXR2 (SIGMA) and CNPase (Santa Cruz) were carried out following manufacturers’ protocols followed by incubation with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies (Life Technologies). Slides were counter stained and mounted with anti-FADE Gold (Life Technologies) containing DAPI. Images were acquired using AxioVision software.",Eric P Rahrmann; Adrienne L Watson; Vincent W Keng; Kwangmin Choi; Branden S Moriarity; Dominic A Beckmann; Natalie K Wolf; Aaron Sarver; Margaret H Collins; Christopher L Moertel; Margaret R Wallace; Bernat Gel; Eduard Serra; Nancy Ratner; David A Largaespada,Nature genetics,2013-07,10.1038/ng.2641,minimal,True
PMID:40025578,Development of CAR-T cell therapy for NF1/SWN-related nerve sheath tumor treatment.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and schwannomatosis (SWN) are rare genetic disorders with distinct genetic etiologies. Both syndromes are predominantly characterized by the development of multiple benign nerve sheath tumors, which typically arise from cranial/peripheral nerves. The management of NF1/SWN-associated benign nerve sheath tumors pose a substantial clinical challenge. In recent years, immunotherapy has demonstrated significant efficacy in treating various tumors, but its application to NF1/SWN has not been explored. In this study, we first evaluated the feasibility of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy for the treatment of benign NF1/SWN-related nerve sheath tumor by analyzing the expression of multiple antigens in 85 tumor samples. Our findings revealed that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/HER1) was highly expressed in most samples, indicating its potential as an ideal target for CAR-T cell therapy. Additionally, TGFβ1 and PDL1, key inhibitory regulators of T cell function within solid tumor microenvironment (TME), were universally overexpressed in these samples, highlighting the immunosuppressive nature of NF1/SWN tumors. To target HER1, we constructed CARs using three distinct scFvs (806, E2 and NEC). All three types of CAR-T cells demonstrated significant tumor-eliminating capability against NF1/SWN tumor cell lines, with 806 CAR-T cells showing the highest efficacy. Considering the immunosuppressive TME, we knocked out TGFBR2 and/or PDCD1 in 806 CAR-T cells using CRISPR/Cas9. Their anti-tumor efficacy was further evaluated using a 3D tumor spheroid model, and the gene-edited 806 CAR-T cells exhibited superior anti-tumor efficacy. In conclusion, we identified HER1 as a target for CAR-T cell therapy in NF1/SWN-related nerve sheath tumors, and developed anti-HER1 CAR-T cells that effectively eliminated NF1/SWN tumor cells, providing a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with these conditions.","Materials and methods Cell lines Human 293T cells (used for lentiviral packaging), sNF96.2 (a MPNST cell line derived from a patient with NF1, used as target cells) and HFFs (human foreskin fibroblasts, used as target cells) were maintained in DMEM (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS (GIBCO), and 100 U/ml penicillin (GIBCO) and streptomycin (GIBCO). NCI-H266 (a lung carcinoma cell line, used as target cells) and K562 (a chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, used as target cells) were maintained in RPMI1640 (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS (GIBCO), and 100 U/ml penicillin (GIBCO) and streptomycin (GIBCO). All cell lines except HFFs, which were kindly provided by Pro. Wang Yanling (Institution of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Science), were purchased from ATCC. Firefly over-expressing sNF96.2 (sNF96.2-luci, also used as target cells) was derived by lentiviral infection and puromycin selection. All above cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Patients and tissue specimens This study was initiated under an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocol at the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Xuanwu Hospital of Capital Medical University (IOZ2021007). For this study, we selected archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples from patients (received surgical resection during 2014–2020) who met clinical diagnostic criteria for NF1 and SWN. In total, 25 NF1 and 60 SWN-NOS tumor samples with adequate quality and quantity of tissue were selected for further histological analysis. The detailed information of aforementioned patients was listed in Table  1 . In addition, freshly surgical specimens from 8 patients (the detailed information was listed in Table  2 ) were used for primary tumor cell isolation, culture, spheroid formation and further experiments.

Briefly, blood DNA of patients listed in Table  2  was extracted using the TIANamp Genomic DNA Kit (DP348, TIANYuan, Beijing, China). Subsequently, DNA libraries were constructed using the KAPA Library Preparation Kit (Kapa Biosystems Inc.). This multistep process encompassed DNA fragmentation (range: 150–800 bp), end repair, 3′ end adenylation, end ligation, amplification, purification, and size selection. The tailored Agilent SureSelectXT panel (962 genes including  NF1 ,  NF2 ,  SMARCB1  and  LZTR1 ) was employed for DNA capture. High-throughput sequencing was executed on the Illumina X10 platform (Illumina Inc.), ensuring an average sequencing depth exceeding 500× and a Q30 value surpassing 90% for both normal and tumor samples. Sequencing data underwent mutation analysis and human genome build hg19 was used as the reference genome. The sequenced reads were mapped to the hg19 by Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA version 0.7.15, default parameters, BWA-MEM algorithm). Mutations were identified via GATK MuTect2 (version 4.1, default parameters). Mutations were annotated with software ANNOVAR (version 2016-02-01, default parameters). The annotation of the CLINVAR database was used to determine whether the mutation was pathogenic or not. Immunohistochemistry Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed at ZSGB-BIO (Beijing, China) on 5-μm FFPE human tissue and spheroid sections using the following unconjugated antibodies: rabbit anti-human HER1 (Abcam, ab52894), rabbit anti-human HER2 (ZSGB-BIO, ZA-0023), rabbit anti-human VEGFR2 (CST, 9698S), rabbit anti-human B7H3 (CST, #14058), rabbit anti-human CD171 (Abcam, ab208155), rabbit anti-human EGFRvIII (ZSGB-BIO, ZA-0643), rabbit anti-human TGFβ1 (Abcam, ab215715), rabbit anti-human PDL1 (Genetex, GTX104763) and rabbit anti-human S100 (ZSGB-BIO, ZA-0225). After deparaffinization, rehydration, quenching of endogenous peroxidases, and antigen retrieving, sections were incubated with above primary antibodies in appropriate dilutions respectively for 2 h at 37 °C. After final wash, the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to HRP was added and incubated 1 h at 37 °C. After final wash, colorimetric detection and hematoxylin counterstaining was done. Then the slides were visualized under the microscope (Nikon, H600L) after dehydrating and mounting. The intensity of immunohistochemical staining for a specific antibody was evaluated as: -, negative; +, weak; ++, moderate; +++, strong; ++++, very strong [ 18 ]. Isolation and culture of primary tumor cells Fresh tumor specimens were obtained from 6 patients (T20210106, T20210108, T20210304, T20210401, T20210618 and T20211105) after informed consent. Primary tumor cells were isolated and cultured as previously reported [ 19 ]. Briefly, tumor samples were placed in DMEM medium immediately after excision, then shipped under low temperature into our laboratory, and further processed within 6 h. Tumor specimens were cut into small pieces (about 1–2 mm 3 ) after removing tumor-adjacent tissues. Tumor pieces were incubated in 10 ml L-15 medium with 15% (v/v) FBS (GIBCO), 1.25 U/ml dispase, 300U/ml collagenase, and 100 U/ml penicillin and streptomycin (GIBCO) for 18–20 h at 37 °C. The digestive solution was diluted by L-15 medium and then filtered through 40 μm cell strainer (BD Falcon). Cell pellet was suspended in DMEM medium with 20% (v/v) FBS (GIBCO), and 100 U/ml penicillin and streptomycin (GIBCO) after centrifugation, and then 1 × 10 6  cells were plated into T75 flask. Culture medium was changed every 3 days. Cells were trypsinized when the confluence reached 100%. 1/2 cells were cultured in standard medium and cryopreserved in passage 2 (P2). The remaining 1/2 cells were plated in T75 flask pre-coated with 10 μg/ml laminin (Sigma, L2020), and cultured in standard medium supplemented with 25 ng/ml human GGF2 (BPS Bioscience, 90255-A). Cells could be used for flow cytometric analysis, cytolysis assay and spheroid formation at P3-P4, and at least 2 days after hGGF2 withdrawing. Spheroid formation and detection sNF96.2-luciferase cells or primary tumor cells (cultured from T20210106 and T20210304  or freshly isolated from T20220826 and T20230718) were suspended in culture medium and seeded in ultra-low cluster, 96-well plate (Corning). When the spheroids formed, effector cells were added with indicated E: T ratio. After incubation, the spheroids were collected, ethanol-fixed, and then mixed with Histogel (Thermofisher, HG-4000-012). Then the solidified Histogel mixture was placed inside a standard tissue cassette and processed as a standard histology specimen. Paraffin sections were prepared for hematoxylin and eosin (H.E.) and IHC staining. Generation of anti-HER1 CAR-T cells Anti-HER1 CARs were constructed, and corresponding CAR-T cells were generated and expanded as previously described [ 20 ]. Briefly, freshly purified primary CD3 +  T cells were activated for 24 h and then infected with lentivirus harboring anti-HER1 CAR (806, E2 or NEC). Lentivirus was produced by co-transfecting with packaging plasmids PMD2.G, PsPAX2, and anti-HER1 CAR (806, E2 or NEC) into 293T cells. The virus supernatants were harvested 48 and 72 h after transfection, and the virus was prepared after concentration (Millipore). Preparation of gene edited CAR-T cells Gene edited CAR-T cells were prepared as previously reported [ 20 ,  21 ]. Briefly, Cas9 and sgRNA ribonucleoprotein were prepared immediately before electroporation. 6 μg Cas9 protein with 6 μg sgRNA (Genescript) was incubated at room temperature for 20 min. 1 × 10 6  CAR-T cells were centrifuged at 300 g  for 5 min, resuspended in 20 μl transfection buffer containing indicated ribonucleoprotein, and then transferred into the electroporation cuvette. P3 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector X Kit (V4XP-3032, Lonza), and program EO-115 were used for CAR-T cell electroporation. After electroporation, same volume of Opti-MEM (GIBCO) was added to the cuvette, and cells were recovered for 20 min in incubator. Then transferred the cell solution into culture plate, and incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 after adding enough pre-warmed culture medium respectively. The indel frequencies of  TGFBR2  and  PDCD1  were measured by TIDE (Tracking Indels by Decomposition) analysis [ 22 ]. The sequences of sgRNAs, and PCR primers used for the amplification of target loci were listed in Supplemental Table S1. Luciferase-based cytolysis assay sNF96.2-luciferase cell-based cytotoxicity was assessed as previously described [ 20 ,  21 ]. Briefly, sNF96.2-luciferase cells and effector cells were suspended at a density of 1 × 10 5  cells/mL in DMEM medium, then seeded in white opaque plate at the indicated ratio and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After co-culture for indicated time, 10 μl Steady-Glo luciferase substrate (Promega) was added, and 5 min later, luminescence was recorded by PerkinElmer Ensight. The results were reported as percentage of killing based on the luciferase activity in the wells compared with tumor cells alone (percentage killing = 100 − [(RLU from well with effector and target cell coculture)/(RLU from well with target cells) × 100]). Real time cell analysis (RTCA)-based cytolysis assay A RTCA system, iCELLigence (ACEA Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA), was used to assess the cytolytic effect of anti-HER1 CAR-T cells (with or without gene editing) on primary tumor cells according to the manufacturers’ instruction. Firstly, the optimum cell number of primary NF tumor cells for the experiment was determined. Then 100 μl tumor cell suspension, about 7.5 × 10 3  cells, was seeded to each well of E-plate. 24 h later, 70 μl anti-HER1 CAR-T cell suspension (with or without gene editing) with indicated E:T ratio was added to corresponding well. Cells were monitored every 15 min by the iCELLigence system, and the measurements were recorded for 72–96 h after CAR-T cell addition. Untreated cells were set as the negative control. The specific lysis ratio was calculated as the equation: % killing = 100 × (1 − [cell index from well with effector addition]/ [cell index from untreated cells]). Caspase-3 substrate-based cytolysis assay 1 × 10 4  tumor cells such as sNF96.2-luci, primary tumor cells derived from T20210106 and T20210304 were seeded in white opaque plate. 24 h later, effector cells such as gene-edited 806 were added to corresponding well at indicated E:T ratio. After 48–72 h incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2, Caspase-3 substrate (Biotium, 30029) was added to the wells according to the manufacturers’ instruction. After 30 min incubation at RT, washed the cells with PBS and observed cells by fluorescence microscopy in PBS using filter sets for green fluorescence (PE Operetta, Ex/Em: 485/515 nm). Flow cytometry BD Fortessa (BD Bioscience) was used to perform fluorescence expression analysis. Cells were harvested and prepared according to the manufacture’s protocols. The antibodies used are as follows: S100β- Alexa Fluor 647 (Abcam, ab196175); Alexa Fluor 647 AffiniPure F (ab') 2 Fragment Goat Anti-Human IgG (H + L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 109-606-003); HER1-PE (352904), CD4-PE (317410), CD8a-APC (301014), CD45RO-PE (304206), and CCR7-Percp (353242) (all from BioLegend). Statistics Data are shown as mean ± SD. All statistical comparisons were evaluated by ordinary 1-way or 2-way ANOVA or unpaired  t  test (2 tailed). The exact  P  values were labeled in corresponding figures.  P  values of less than 0.05 were considered significant.",Na Tang; Lei Cheng; Jiawei Hao; Beilei Xu; Xi Pan; Xiaofei Wei; Hao Wu; Haoyi Wang,Acta neuropathologica communications,2025-03-01,10.1186/s40478-025-01965-6,minimal,True
PMID:19451225,"NF2/merlin is a novel negative regulator of mTOR complex 1, and activation of mTORC1 is associated with meningioma and schwannoma growth.","Inactivating mutations of the neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) gene, NF2, result predominantly in benign neurological tumors, schwannomas and meningiomas, in humans; however, mutations in murine Nf2 lead to a broad spectrum of cancerous tumors. The tumor-suppressive function of the NF2 protein, merlin, a membrane-cytoskeleton linker, remains unclear. Here, we identify the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) as a novel mediator of merlin's tumor suppressor activity. Merlin-deficient human meningioma cells and merlin knockdown arachnoidal cells, the nonneoplastic cell counterparts of meningiomas, exhibit rapamycin-sensitive constitutive mTORC1 activation and increased growth. NF2 patient tumors and Nf2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts demonstrate elevated mTORC1 signaling. Conversely, the exogenous expression of wild-type merlin isoforms, but not a patient-derived L64P mutant, suppresses mTORC1 signaling. Merlin does not regulate mTORC1 via the established mechanism of phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt or mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase-mediated TSC2 inactivation and may instead regulate TSC/mTOR signaling in a novel fashion. In conclusion, the deregulation of mTORC1 activation underlies the aberrant growth and proliferation of NF2-associated tumors and may restrain the growth of these lesions through negative feedback mechanisms, suggesting that rapamycin in combination with phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors may be therapeutic for NF2.",,Marianne F James; Sangyeul Han; Carolyn Polizzano; Scott R Plotkin; Brendan D Manning; Anat O Stemmer-Rachamimov; James F Gusella; Vijaya Ramesh,Molecular and cellular biology,2009-08,10.1128/MCB.01581-08,abstract_only,False
PMID:8051082,Cloning and characterization of a novel epidermal cell surface antigen (ESA).,"We report here the isolation and characterization of a cDNA that encodes a novel extracellular epidermal molecule, epidermal surface antigen (ESA), which is thought to play a role in intercellular epidermal adhesion. Sequence analysis reveals that the 379 amino acid ESA has a molecular mass of about 41.7 kDa and an alpha-helix-rich secondary conformation. Much of this also has an heptad substructure, consistent with the formation of several bundles of alpha-helices in a compact globular structure. The ESA protein appears to consist of an NH2-terminal hydrophobic region with mixed alpha and beta structure followed by a more hydrophilic COOH-terminal region which is very rich in alpha-helix. The 2.5-kilobase ESA mRNA is expressed in cultured keratinocytes, melanocytes, fibroblasts, carcinoma, and melanoma cell lines. The ESA gene is conserved in all mammalian species examined and has been localized to human chromosome 17 (M17S1) in the same region as the gene for von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis. The high level of expression of the ESA mRNA in human skin and in cultured cells derived from the epidermis, the appearance of ESA protein early in human development, and conservation of the ESA gene throughout mammalian evolution suggest that the novel ESA protein plays a vital role in epidermal structure and maintenance.",,W T Schroeder; S Stewart-Galetka; S Mandavilli; D A Parry; L Goldsmith; M Duvic,The Journal of biological chemistry,1994-08-05,,abstract_only,False
PMID:34011935,Metalloproteinase 1 downregulation in neurofibromatosis 1: Therapeutic potential of antimalarial hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by mutation in the neurofibromin 1 (NF1) gene. Its hallmarks are cutaneous findings including neurofibromas, benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors. We analyzed the collagen and matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) expression in Neurofibromatosis 1 cutaneous neurofibroma and found excessive expression of collagen and reduced expression of MMP1. To identify new therapeutic drugs for neurofibroma, we analyzed phosphorylation of components of the Ras pathway, which underlies NF1 regulation, and applied treatments to block this pathway (PD184352, U0126, and rapamycin) and lysosomal processes (chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and bafilomycin A (BafA)) in cultured Neurofibromatosis 1 fibroblasts. We found that downregulation of the MMP1 protein was a key abnormal feature in the neurofibromatosis 1 fibroblasts and that the decreased MMP1 was restored by the lysosomal blockers CQ and HCQ, but not by the blockers of the Ras pathway. Moreover, the MMP1-upregulating activity of those lysosomal blockers was dependent on aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) activation and ERK phosphorylation. Our findings suggest that lysosomal blockers are potential candidates for the treatment of Neurofibromatosis 1 neurofibroma.","Materials and methods Reagents and antibodies Dermal fibroblast cells were cultured with Minimum Essential Eagle’s Medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MI, USA) supplied with nonessential amino acid solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), 15% fetal bovine serum (Nichirei Biosciences Inc., Tokyo, Japan), and antibiotics (Sigma-Aldrich).

Alexa Fluor488 goat anti-rabbit IgG H+L was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Study approval This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Kyushu University (#30-363 for immunohistological study and #24-132 for cell line establishment). Written informed consent was obtained from all of the volunteers. Punch biopsies were taken from a total of six donors, including three healthy controls and three patients diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 1 (Supplemental Table  1 ) based on diagnostic criteria. Cell culture To establish the human primary fibroblast cell culture, dermal fibroblast cells were isolated from biopsied skin tissue and cultured as described previously . A lack of contamination of Schwann-like cells was confirmed by S100A protein staining. Before the experiments, cells were trypsinized and allowed to adhere to the culture plates for 24 h. Then, the cells underwent each experiment as detailed below. Each phosphorylation inhibitor was mixed with HCQ or vehicle in culture medium and then the cell culture medium was changed depending on the experimental conditions. 36 NF1 genotyping DNA was isolated from cultured fibroblast cells from a total of six donors with NucleoSpin Tissue (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). DNA genotyping and data analysis were performed by Genewiz Inc. (South Plainfield, NJ, USA). Small interfering RNA transfection Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting NF1 (s221793) or AHR (s1200) and scrambled RNA (Silence Negative Control No. 1) were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. siRNA was transfected into fibroblast cells with lipofectamine RNAi Max (Thermo Fisher Scientific), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) Total RNA was isolated using RNase Mini Kit (Qiagen) and reverse-transcribed with Prime Script RT Reagent Kit (Takara Bio, Otsu, Japan), in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. The qPCR reactions were performed with the CFX Connect System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) using TB Green Premix Ex Taq (Takara Bio). Cycling conditions comprised 95 °C for 30 s as the first step, followed by 40 cycles of qRT-PCR at 95 °C for 5 s and 60 °C for 20 s. mRNA expression was measured in triplicate wells and was normalized using β-actin as a housekeeping gene. The primer sequences are shown in Supplemental Table  2 . Western blotting analysis Cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and lysed with RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich) and PhosSTOP (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Extracted proteins were denatured by boiling at 96 °C for 5 min with SDS-sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol and loaded onto Blot 4–12% Bis-Tris Plus Gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The proteins transferred to a PVDF membrane (Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) were reacted with antibody diluted in Can Get Signal (Toyobo Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan) and subjected to Super Signal West Pico (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Chemiluminescence was detected using ChemiDoc XRS (Bio-Rad) and densitometric analysis was performed. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) The total cell culture supernatant was collected and frozen immediately at −80 °C until use. The concentration of secreted MMP1 was measured as manufacturer’s protocol (Boster Biological Technology, CA, USA; or R&D Systems). Immunohistofluorescence Fibroblasts were seeded on µ-Slide 8-well chambers (ibidi, Gräfelfing, Germany) and harvested for 24 h. Treatment with 50 μM HCQ, 100 nM FICZ, or vehicle was applied for 6 h prior to immobilization with ice-cold acetone. Cells were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin and reacted with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. Then, cells were reacted with Alexa Fluor488 secondary antibodies in the dark. Chambers were covered with cell-mounting medium containing DAPI (Santa Cruz) and images were taken with EVOS Cell Imaging Systems (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Immunohistochemistry Skin biopsy samples were obtained from five patients and subjected to staining as per the protocol used at Kyushu University Hospital facilities as previously described , with minor modification. 37 Cell proliferation and viability test Fibroblasts were seeded in a 96-well plate and harvested for 48 h. Viable cells were measured using a CCK-8 kit (Dojindo, Tokyo, Japan). The absorbance at 450 nm was measured with a microplate reader (Bio-Rad) and the analysis was performed in quadruplicate. To make a calibration curve for cell counting, a sequence of numbers of cells were seeded in a 96-well plate and allowed to adhere to the plate for 2 h. A standard curve was established following the manufacturer’s instructions. A calibration curve was made for each experiment. Cells at passages 3 to 4 were used to measure the cell proliferation rate. Statistical analysis An unpaired two-tailed  t -test and Tukey’s HSD test were applied as appropriate to evaluate statistical significance (* P  < 0.05; ** P  < 0.01; *** P  < 0.001).

PMID:41444363,Focused ultrasound-mediated drug delivery of bevacizumab in treating NF2-related schwannomatosis in an animal model.,"UNLABELLED: Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2)-related schwannomatosis is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by the development of cranial and peripheral nerve schwannomas, including bilateral vestibular schwannomas which are associated with substantial morbidity. Current therapeutic strategies comprise surgical resection, radiotherapy, and systemic administration of bevacizumab; however, these approaches are frequently limited by high recurrence rates and morbidity. In this study, a transgenic murine model ( SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-32031-9.","Methods Disease animal model and ethical considerations The Postn-Cre transgenic and conditional Nf2flox/flox knocking alleles were obtained from the Conway and Clapp labs at Indiana University School of Medicine at an age of 2.5 months and acclimatized to the institutional vivarium. The colony received rat chow and water ad libitum using a 12:12 light/dark cycle (7 a.m.–7 p.m.) and controlled room temperature (22 ± 1 degree Celsius). Genotyping of Nf2flox2 and Nf2D2 bands was done by PCR analysis as described previously . The Postn-Cre transgene was detected by PCR analysis with the following primers: P1 (CAT-TTG- GGC-CAG-CTA-AAC-AT) and P2 (CCC-GGC-AAA-ACA- GGT-AGT-TA).  35 , 36 Postn-Cre; Nf2flox/flox  mice and Cre-negative controls possessed the same mixed genetic background, with SNP analysis indicating close relation to the FVB/NTac strain (87.37% identity) . 36 All experiments and procedures were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Sunnybrook Research Institute adhering to the Policies and Guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care and meeting criteria and requirements of Provincial Statute of Ontario, Animals for Research Act as well as those of the Canadian Federal Health of Animals Act. Study design For this study a colony of a total of 156 animals was established. Included for analysis were only  Postn-Cre; Nf2flox/flox  mice (n = 42), all Cre-negative controls (n = 114) were excluded. Allocation of animals to the treatment arm was neither randomized nor blinded, since maintaining the colony was compromised by a high death rate due to inbreeding issues. This study comprised two parts: i. an acute model (n = 5, 2 female, 3 male, weight: 20.0–23.5 g, age 4–14 months) to assess focused ultrasound (FUS)-mediated drug delivery (bevacizumab 5 mg/kg b.w., Avastin® 100 mg/25 ml, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) to schwannoma tumors on dorsal root ganglia (DRG), and ii. a chronic model to investigate the treatment effect after multiple bevacizumab and FUS treatments to evaluate the impact of the treatment on the DRG schwannoma tumor growth. The chronic group involved the following four cohorts: human bevacizumab only (n = 5, 1 female, 4 male, weight: 20.0–28.0 g, age 8–9 months): animals received biweekly i.p. treatment with bevacizumab 5 mg/kg b.w. (Avastin® 100 mg/25 ml, Roche, Basel, Switzerland), for a total of 4 injections. murine bevacizumab only (n = 5, 4 female, 1 male, weight 19.2–24.8 g, age 6–11 months): animals received biweekly i.p. treatment with bevacizumab 5 mg/kg b.w. (B20-4.1.1, 100 mg/25 ml, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) for a total of 4 injections. human bevacizumab and FUS treatment (n = 9, 5 female, 4 male, weight 15.6–27.5 g, age 3–15 months): animals received biweekly i.p. treatment with bevacizumab 5 mg/kg b.w. (Avastin®) for a total of 3 injections. FUS treatment only (n = 3, 2 female, 1 male, weight 19.5–22.7 g, age 4–5 months): animals received biweekly FUS treatment for a total of 3 sessions. An additional cohort of untreated mutant animals (n = 16; 6 female, 10 male; weight: 16.0–19.0 g; age: 4–11 months) served as controls. An overview of all treatment groups is provided in Supplemental Fig.  1 . The primary outcome was DRG schwannoma tumor size, assessed via voxel counts from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine with gadolinium contrast using a 7 T scanner (BioSpec 70/30 USR; Bruker, USA). For all chronic groups, pre-treatment MRI was performed either prior to or at the first treatment, with post-treatment MRI conducted two weeks after the final treatment session. An overview of the chronic study design is provided in Supplemental Fig.  2 . Bevacizumab In the acute group, human bevacizumab was administered as a single i.p. injection (Avastin®, 5 mg/kg body weight) within 24 h before FUS exposure, followed by perfusion two hours post-intervention. In the chronic group, treatment followed protocols established in human NF2-studies  and previous animal studies 16 . Animals received bevacizumab at 5 mg/kg body weight i.p. per treatment. Anesthesia was induced using 2–2.5% isoflurane (Fresenius Kabi AG, Homburg, Germany) until no response to pain stimuli was observed, then the weight-adjusted i.p. injection was administered. For the human bevacizumab + FUS cohort, one injection was given within 24 h prior to the FUS treatment. 49 , 50 FUS procedure MRI monitoring was conducted using a 7 T scanner (BioSpec 70/30 USR; Bruker, USA). Animals were first anesthetized with 2% isoflurane in medical air, catheterized via the tail vein for IV injections, and shaved along the dorsal trunk for ultrasound gel application and optimal acoustic transmission. T1-weighted images (fast-spin echo, TE/TR = 5.5/500 ms, 12 averages, 200 × 200 matrix, in-plane resolution 0.2 × 0.2 mm, slice thickness 0.5 mm) were acquired before and after IV gadolinium contrast injection (0.1 ml/kg, Gadovist, Bayer Inc.) for lesion localization and targeting. Following co-registration of a preclinical LP-100 FUS system (FUS Instruments, Canada) with the MRI scanner, a 12 × 2 treatment grid (1 mm spacing) was aligned with the unilateral L1–L3 DRGs for sonication coupled with IV microbubble administration (0.02 ml/kg, Definity, Lantheus Medical Imaging, USA; Fig.  3 A). The selection of the DRGs was determined by several practical constraints inherent to the small size of the murine model (15.6–28.0 g): (1) During transfer from the MRI coil to the FUS device, even minimal positional shifts could occur which made reliably targeting a full unilateral set of DRGs (L1–L6) not technically feasible. (2) Moreover, anatomical considerations further limited the number of DRGs that could be safely and consistently targeted. Specifically, the lower lumbar DRGs (L4–L6) are positioned more paramedially and are considerably smaller, making precise sonication challenging. Fig. 3 ( A – C ) Methods.

The different colours indicate the counted areas. FUS treatments were delivered using a spherically focused (75 mm diameter, 60 mm focal length) transducer driven at 1.78 MHz in 10 ms bursts with a pulse repetition frequency of 1 Hz for a total of two minutes. Acoustic pressures were adjusted in real-time using a previously described acoustic controller algorithm based on ultraharmonic emissions . Post-sonication, T1-weighted images were acquired again over the lumbar spine to evaluate treatment response via contrast enhancement (IV administered Gadolinium contrast, 0.1 ml/kg, Gadovist, Bayer Inc.). 51 MRI for tumor volume quantification Tumor volume quantification was performed on a 7 Tesla(T) scanner (BioSpec 70/30 USR; Bruker, USA). Animals were maintained under anesthesia with 1.5–2% isoflurane in medical air, catheterized via the tail vein for IV injections of gadolinium contrast (0.1 ml/kg, Gadovist, Bayer Inc.). Mice were scanned at 7 T (BioSpec 70/30 USR with B-GA12S HP gradients running ParaVision 6.0.1, Bruker BioSpin, Billerica, MA) using an 86 mm inner diameter volume coil for transmit and a quadrature surface coil for receive. A 25-slice 2D sagittal T1-weighted rapid acquisition with refocused echoes  scan (RARE; TR = 988 ms; TEeff = 7.5 ms; FOV = 40 mm × 30 mm; slice thickness = 0.2 mm; matrix = 200 × 150; RARE factor = 4; bandwidth = 78 kHz; averages = 12; 5 min, 32 s) was acquired. 52 MRI images were transferred into MATLAB with Aedes software for manual segmentation of DRG schwannomas at bilateral lumbar levels L1–L6 by two independent raters (JLS and YS, Fig.  3 B,C), and voxel counts were automatically calculated. Histology Tumors were excised from animals perfused with 4% Paraformaldehyde via intracardiac perfusion into the right atrium, post-fixed with 4% Paraformaldehyde overnight, embedded in OCT, sectioned and stained with H&E. Immunohistology analysis of 10 micron dorsal root ganglia cryosections was performed using Anti-CD31 (Abcam, ab7388) for vasculature, Anti-S100B (Atlas Antibodies, HPA015768-100UL) antibodies for S100B protein and DAPI for nuclei. Euthanasia protocol For the acute model animals were first anesthetized with isoflurane 2–3% induction until pedal response did not show responses. Animals were then perfused with PBS via intracardiac perfusion into the right atrium until the liver paled and then with ice cold saline. For the chronic model animals were first anesthetized with isoflurane 2–3% induction until pedal response did not show responses. Animals were then perfused with PBS via intracardiac perfusion into the right atrium until the liver paled and then with 4% Paraformaldehyde. In cases of illness-related sacrifice animals were first anesthetized with isoflurane 5% induction until pedal response did not show responses and then cervical dislocation was performed. Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics, including means and standard deviations, were reported by items, groups, and time points. Within-subject changes from Time 1 to Time 3 were measured using change scores, and comparisons on the change scores were made among selected subgroups. For group 5, differences in overall means were examined across time points. Examination of time and subgroup differences was performed using mixed models to account for within subject covariances, and pairwise comparisons were based on least squares means. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).",Jennifer L Spiegel; Alessandro De Maio; Manita V Patel; Omer J Ungar; Carolyn Lai; Tra Truong; Yumai Situ; D Wade Clapp; Simon J Conway; Joseph M Chen; Vincent Y W Lin; Kullervo Hynynen; Meaghan A O'Reilly; Trung N Le,Scientific reports,2025-12-24,10.1038/s41598-025-32031-9,minimal,True
PMID:41036607,Pharmacogenomic Synthetic Lethal Screens Reveal Hidden Vulnerabilities and New Therapeutic Approaches for Treatment of NF1-Associated Tumors.,"Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is a common cancer predisposition syndrome caused by heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene NF1. Individuals with NF1 develop benign tumors of the peripheral nervous system (neurofibromas), originating from the Schwann cell (SC) lineage after somatic loss of the wild-type NF1 allele, some of which progress further to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). There is only one FDA-approved targeted therapy for symptomatic plexiform neurofibromas and none approved for MPNSTs. The genetic basis of NF1 syndrome makes associated tumors ideal for using synthetic drug sensitivity approaches to uncover therapeutic vulnerabilities. We developed a drug discovery pipeline to identify therapeutics for NF1-related tumors using isogeneic pairs of NF1-proficient and NF1-deficient immortalized human SCs. We utilized these in a large-scale high-throughput screen for drugs that preferentially kill NF1-deficient cells, through which we identified 23 compounds capable of killing NF1-deficient SCs with selectivity. Multiple hits from this screen clustered into classes defined by the method of action. Four clinically interesting drugs from these classes were tested in vivo using both a genetically engineered mouse model of high-grade PNSTs and human MPNST xenografts. All drugs tested showed single-agent efficacy in these models as well as significant synergy when used in combination with the MEK inhibitor selumetinib. This high-throughput screen platform yielded novel therapeutically relevant compounds for the treatment of NF1-associated tumors and can serve as a tool to rapidly evaluate new compounds and combinations in the future.","Materials and Methods Tissue culture iHSC lines were maintained and passaged at 37°C with 5% CO 2  in DMEM high-glucose media supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. If antibiotic selection was needed, puromycin was used at 500 µg/mL, as indicated below. S462-TY cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C with 5% CO 2 .  Mycoplasma  detection was routinely performed using the MycoAlert detection kit (Lonza Bioscience) throughout this study. Cell line authentication was performed at the Arizona Genetics Core (RRID: SCR_012429) against established reference lines using short tandem repeat profiling. All assays were conducted on cells 1 to 3 passages after thawing from banked stocks. Generation of  NF1- deficient cell lines We received iHSCs from Dr. Margaret Wallace (University of Florida). These are wild-type human SCs immortalized using the human reverse transcriptase component of telomerase and murine cyclin-dependent kinase 4 transgenesis ( 35 ). All subsequent mutations were engineered into this cell line. U6-gRNA vectors were produced as previously described ( 36 ) and introduced into iHSCs that are proficient for  NF1 . U6-gRNA vectors were engineered with unique sequences targeting a site in  NF1  to cause insertion/deletion (indel) mutations in a critical exon to introduce frameshift mutations. The target sequences can be found in  Fig. 1A . Figure 1. Characterization of  NF1- deficient iHSCs.  A,  Exon 10 of the  NF1  gene was targeted for mutagenesis using CRISPR–Cas9. The single-guide RNA target site in the wild-type  NF1  sequence is highlighted in yellow. Independent clones were recovered harboring the indicated biallelic indels at this locus which result in frameshifts and early stop codons.  B,  Immunoblot showing the iHSC lines identified as having biallelic loss-of-function mutations in  NF1  do not make neurofibromin protein.  NF1  samples come from isogenic sister clones to the  +/+ NF1- deficient cells which when sequenced did not have mutations at the guide target site in  NF1 . HSC1λ is the parental cell line and serves as a positive control. ST88-14 is an established  NF1- deficient MPNST cell line.  C, NF1- deficient human SCs form significantly more colonies in soft agar under low-serum conditions compared with isogenic-matched  NF1- proficient lines and are poised for transformation. Parental HSC1λ cells and those in which the tumor-suppressor  PTEN  has been knocked out serve as controls. **,  P  < 0.01; ***,  P  < 0.001.  D, NF1- deficient human SCs  can  form xenograft tumors in the flanks of immunodeficient athymic nude mice. Cells (1 × 10 6 ) of three  NF1- proficient and three  NF1 -deficient clones were each implanted in the flanks of four mice and monitored for tumor development.  NF1 -deficient clones showed the ability to form tumors, whereas tumor formation was not observed for  NF1 -proficient clones. All vectors were introduced via electroporation and performed using the NEON electroporation system (Invitrogen) using 100 µL electroporation tips according to the manufacturer’s protocol. One million cells were electroporated (1 pulse of 1400V for 30 ms) with 2 µg Flag-hCas9, 2 μg each U6-gRNA vector (gifts from Branden Moriarity), and 100 ng pmaxGFP plasmid (Amaxa) to assess transfection efficiency ( 36 ). To enrich for modified cells, co-transposition was performed using 500 ng of the  piggyBac  ( PB ) transposon PB-CAGG-Luciferase-IRES-GFP-PGK-Puro R  and 500 ng of CMV- PB7  transposase ( 36 ). Cells were provided fresh growth medium 1 day after electroporation and, 2 days later, were selected with puromycin (500 µg/mL; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 week. Selective medium was changed every 2 to 3 days for 1 week. Limiting dilutions were then plated from the pooled cell lines, which are enriched for cells edited at the sites of interest, to obtain single-cell clones. These clones were then expanded for future work and validation. The mutations were validated by obtaining genomic DNA from the derived clones, amplifying DNA around the gRNA target/cut sites, and subjecting it to Sanger sequencing. Amplicons were generated in 50 µL reactions with GoTaq Green Master Mix (Promega) using the following PCR cycle: initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 minutes; 30 × (95°C for 30 seconds; 59°C for 35 seconds; and 72°C for 2 minutes); and final extension at 72°C for 5 minutes. Forward (AAC​AGC​TTG​TTT​GGG​AAG​GA) and reverse (CAT​TGG​TGA​TGA​TTC​GAT​GG) primers amplified a 1323 bp region flanking  NF1  exon 10. PCR products were purified and sequenced using a third primer binding in  NF1  introns 9 to 10 (TGG​CAG​CTG​GAT​TTT​ACT​GC). Clones targeted for editing of exon 10 in  NF1  were recovered with a variety of indels around the target site, verified through directed Sanger sequencing. A summary of recovered clone sequences is shown in  Fig. 1A . Western blot analysis was also done on a subset of clones of interest to validate the functional knockout of neurofibromin expression ( Fig. 1B ). 
 In vivo  tumor-forming ability of iHSCs 
 NF1- proficient and  NF1- deficient engineered clones were injected into the flanks of 6- to 7-week-old athymic nude mice (RRID: JAX:002019; 1.0×10 6  cells) in 50% Matrigel (BD Biosciences). Both male and female mice were used for this assay at an equal 50% ratio. Mice were monitored for tumor formation for 6 months after injection or until a tumor volume of 2,000 mm 3  was reached. Western blotting Immunoblotting was done on whole-cell lysates collected from various cell lines. After collection, cells were washed with 1x PBS, collected, pelleted, and flash-frozen. Pellets were then thawed and lysed using 1x RIPA buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with phosphatase inhibitor cocktails 2 and 3 (Sigma-Adrich). Whole-cell lysates were vortexed at 2,000 RPM for 15 minutes before being sonicated with 30-1-second pulses using a Fisherbrand Model 50 Sonic Dismembrator. Then, 10 to 30 μg of whole-cell lysate was loaded into each well of 4% to 12% Bis-Tris NuPage polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred using a constant 18V overnight at 4°C onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using an Invitrogen NuPage electrophoresis system. Each membrane was blocked with 5% BSA in TBS–Tween-20 for 1 hour and incubated with 1:1,000 primary antibody overnight at 4°C. After rinsing away primary antibodies, membranes were incubated for 1 hour with 1:5,000 secondary antibody. WesternBright Quantum horseradish peroxidase substrate (Advansta) was added to membranes before being imaged on an Odyssey Fc imager [LI-COR Odyssey Fc Imaging System (RRID: SCR_023227)]. Primary and secondary antibodies used were from Cell Signaling Technology: neurofibromin 1 (D7R7D) rabbit mAb 14623 (RRID: AB_2798543), anti-rabbit IgG, and horseradish peroxidase–linked secondary 7074 (RRID: AB_2099233). β-Actin was probed as a loading control using β-actin (13E5) rabbit mAb #4970 (RRID: AB_2223172) at a 1:5,000 dilution. Small molecules and drug libraries All drug screening libraries used in this study were obtained from the University of Minnesota Institute for Therapeutics Design and Development collection. Validation of hits from the primary drug screening effort and all  in vivo  work was done with repurchased compounds from Selleck Chemicals. 
 In vitro  combination drug testing and analysis Cells were seeded into 384-well plates at 2,000 cells/well using a Biomek 2000. After 24 hours of growth in medium supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin, the drug was added in triplicate or quadruplicate wells per dose in an 8-point or 12-point dose–response manner (depending on the experiment, as indicated) using the acoustic Echo 550 liquid dispenser (Labcyte). Drug combination testing was done in a similar manner and plated in a constant ratio as indicated. After incubation with drug(s) or vehicle for 48 hours, cells were incubated with alamarBlue (Thermo Fisher Scientific) reagent, and fluorescence was read on a CLARIOstar microplate reader (BMG Labtech). Cell viability was calculated by fluorescence of experimental wells in the percent of unexposed control wells with blank values subtracted. Data were analyzed in Prism software (GraphPad Prism), and dose–response curves were generated using a nonlinear regression log(inhibitor) vs. response–variable slope model. Each point represents the mean ± SD. Combination index value determination Drug interaction values were determined using the median-effect principle of Chou–Talalay ( 37 ,  38 ). Combination index (CI) values were calculated using CalcuSyn software (BioSoft) as previously described ( 39 ). CI < 1, =1, and >1 indicate synergism, additive effect, and antagonism, respectively. Transcriptional response to therapeutics The S462TY MPNST cell line was grown under standard tissue culture conditions. Cells were exposed to vehicle (DMSO), digoxin, rigosertib, selumetinib, digoxin + selumetinib, or rigosertib + selumetinib for 2 hours or 24 hours. For drug treatments, all compounds were used at the following concentrations: selumetinib (125 μmol/L), rigosertib (0.5 μmol/L), digoxin (0.0308 μmol/L), vorinostat (2.5 μmol/L), selumetinib (15.625 μmol/L) plus vorinostat (1.56 μmol/L), selumetinib (4 μmol/L) plus digoxin (0.0308 μmol/L), and selumetinib (2 μmol/L)μΜ] plus rigosertib (0.1 μmol/L). At the indicated time point, cells were harvested, washed with cold PBS, and pelleted via centrifugation, and the pellets were frozen in LiN 2 . Cell pellets were stored at −80°C until RNA purification. RNA purification and sequencing RNA was harvested from cells using QIAGEN RNEasy mini purification kits and subjected to TURBO DNAse to remove any residual genomic DNA contamination. RNA quality was assayed via the Agilent Bioanalyzer and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 next-generation sequencer (RRID: SCR_016387). RNA sequencing analysis RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data were analyzed as follows: quality trimming via Trimmomatic (v0.33; ref.  40 ), alignment via HISAT2 (v2.1.0; ref.  41 ) to the GRCh38 Ensembl assembly ( 42 ), and gene count quantification via StringTie (v1.3.4d; ref.  43 ). Differential expression analysis was performed using R statistical software (v4.3.1; ref.  44 ), tidyverse (v2.0.0; ref.  45 ), and DESeq2 (v1.42.0; ref.  46 ). Pathway analysis was performed using GeneAnalytics(v; ref.  47 ). The data discussed in this publication have been deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus (GE0; ref.  48 ) and are accessible through GEO series accession number  GSE262030  ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSExxx ). Flow cytometry Cell-cycle stage and apoptosis were determined by staining and flow cytometry. S462-TY cells were treated with drug compounds or DMSO control for 0, 24, and 48 hours before harvest. For cell-cycle stage determination, cell supernatant and adhered cells were collected and stained for flow cytometry using a propidium iodide kit (Abcam ab139418) using the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, after collection, cells were washed with 1x PBS and then fixed using ice-cold 66% ethanol. Cells were then washed again with 1x PBS and stained with 1x Propidium Iodide and RNase Staining Solution before being run through a Beckman Coulter CytoFLEX Flow Cytometer (RRID: SCR_019627). The cell-cycle stage was determined with the Cell Cycle tool in FlowJo v10.7.1 software (BD Life Sciences) using the Watson (pragmatic) model. RAS–GTP level determination RAS–GTP levels were determined in S462-TY in response to drug treatment using the Active Motif RAS GTPase Chemi ELISA Kit (52097) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 2 × 10 6  cells were seeded into 10-cm tissue culture plates, in triplicate, for DMSO, selumetinib, digoxin, rigosertib, selumetinib + digoxin, and selumetinib + rigosertib. The following morning, the indicated drugs were added to the media at the following concentrations: 125 µmol/L selumetinib, 0.031 µmol/L digoxin, 0.5 µmol/L rigosertib, 4 µmol/L selumetinib + 0.031 µmol/L digoxin, 2 µmol/L selumetinib + 0.15 µmol/L rigosertib, or 0.1% DMSO. Twenty-four hours later, cells were harvested, and lysates were generated according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Bicinchoninic acid assays were done on all samples, and 100 µmol/L of lysate from each sample was used to assay RAS–GTP levels. Luminescence signal from the ELISA plate was read on an BioTek Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multimode Reader (RRID: SCR_019732). 
 In vivo  models and drug testing All  in  vivo procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Minnesota. For the MPNST cell line xenograft model, S462-TY cells (1.0 × 10 6 ) in 50% Matrigel (BD Biosciences) were injected subcutaneously into the flank of 6- to 7-week-old NOD- Rag1 null  IL2rg null, NOD rag gamma, NOD-RG (NRG) mice (RRID: JAX:007799). Equal numbers of males and females were used. For the patient-derived xenograft (PDX) MPNST model, tumor tissue was implanted subcutaneously directly into NOD.Cg-Prkdc scid  Il2rg tm1Wjl /SzJ mice ( 34 ). Animals were randomized to treatment or control arms, and administration of drugs was started when tumors reached 150 to 200 mm 3 . All treatments were administered via intraperitoneal injection at the following doses: LB100 1.5 mg/kg, DMAPT 100 mg/kg, digoxin 2 mg/kg, rigosertib 100 mg/kg, and selumetinib 10 mg/kg. Digoxin and selumetinib were formulated using a 30% PEG300, 5% Tween-80 vehicle, and rigosertib was prepared in PBS. The GEMM of high-grade PNSTs was generated as described previously ( 33 ).  Dhh::Cre, Nf1 fl/fl , Pten  experimental class animals were randomized to a treatment or vehicle group at 1 week of age. All treatments were administered via intraperitoneal injection at the following doses: LB100 1.5 mg/kg, DMAPT 100 mg/kg, digoxin 0.25 mg/kg, rigosertib 35 mg/kg, and selumetinib, 10 mg/kg. Tumors develop with 100% penetrance in all experimental class offspring, and offspring were sex-segregated as expected. fl/fl",Kyle B Williams; Alex T Larsson; Bryant J Keller; Katherine E Chaney; Rory L Williams; Minu M Bhunia; Garrett M Draper; Tyler A Jubenville; Wendy A Hudson; Gunda I Georg; Christopher L Moertel; Nancy Ratner; David A Largaespada,Molecular cancer therapeutics,2026-02-04,10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-24-1053,minimal,True
PMID:37330719,Existing and Developing Preclinical Models for Neurofibromatosis Type 1-Related Cutaneous Neurofibromas.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is caused by a nonfunctional copy of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene that predisposes patients to the development of cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs), the skin tumor that is the hallmark of this condition. Innumerable benign cNFs, each appearing by an independent somatic inactivation of the remaining functional NF1 allele, form in nearly all patients with NF1. One of the limitations in developing a treatment for cNFs is an incomplete understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and limitations in experimental modeling. Recent advances in preclinical in vitro and in vivo modeling have substantially enhanced our understanding of cNF biology and created unprecedented opportunities for therapeutic discovery. We discuss the current state of cNF preclinical in vitro and in vivo model systems, including two- and three-dimensional cell cultures, organoids, genetically engineered mice, patient-derived xenografts, and porcine models. We highlight the models' relationship to human cNFs and how they can be used to gain insight into cNF development and therapeutic discovery.",,Verena Staedtke; Piotr Topilko; Lu Q Le; Kevin Grimes; David A Largaespada; Ross L Cagan; Matthew R Steensma; Anat Stemmer-Rachamimov; Jaishri O Blakeley; Steven D Rhodes; Ina Ly; Carlos G Romo; Sang Y Lee; Eduard Serra,The Journal of investigative dermatology,2023-08,10.1016/j.jid.2023.01.042,abstract_only,False
PMID:30055648,Testing ATRA and MEK inhibitor PD0325901 effectiveness in a nude mouse model for human MPNST xenografts.,"OBJECTIVE: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are aggressive sarcomas characterized by high recurrence rates and early metastases. These tumors arise more frequently within neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and present with resistance during standard chemotherapy leading to increased mortality and morbidity in those patients. In vitro all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and MEK inhibitors (MEKi) were shown to inhibit tumor proliferation, especially when applied in combination. Therefore, we established a nude mouse model to investigate if treatment of xenografts derived from NF1 associated S462 and T265 MPNST cells respond to ATRA and the MEKi PD0325901. RESULTS: We demonstrated that human NF1 associated MPNST derived from S462 but not T265 cells form solid subcutaneous tumors in Foxn1 nude mice but not in Balb/c, SHO or Shorn mice. We verified a characteristic staining pattern of human MPNST xenografts by immunohistochemistry. Therapeutic effects of ATRA and/or MEKi PD0325901 on growth of S462 MPNST xenografts in Foxn1 nude mice were not demonstrated in vitro, as we did not observe significant suppression of MPNST growth compared with placebo treatment.","Materials and methods Cell culture and colony formation assay Human MPNST cell lines S462 and T265 were described previously [ 23 – 26 ]. Cells were cultured in DMEM (4.5 g/L glucose, 2 mM  l -glutamine, 10% (v/v) FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin and 1 mM sodium pyruvate). Clonogenic assays were performed as described elsewhere with specifications: 300 cells per well were seeded in a 6-well plate and incubated for 14 days. [ 27 ] Following incubation, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with staining/fixation solution (6% glutaraldehyde/0.5% crystal violet/PBS) for 30 min. Colonies were defined as accumulation of > 50 cells. Images were taken per well (Olympus SZX12 microscope) using Adobe Photoshop CS5 (Adobe Systems Software Ireland Limited 2010), and colonies were counted using the cell counter tool of ImageJ (NIH United States 2014). Xenotransplantation and ATRA quantification Experiments were approved by the federal state authority of nature, environment and consumer protection of Nordrhein-Westfalen (“Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz Nordrhein-Westfalen“, LANUV) (27.08.2013, reference 84-02.04.2013.A275). Balb/c Nude (Balb/cAnNRj-Foxn1nu/Foxn1nu, Janvier), Foxn1 (Nu/Nu) Nude (Crl:NU-Foxn1nu, Charles River), SHO ®  (SCID Hairless Outbred, Crl:SHO-PrkdcscidHrhr, Charles River) and Shorn (ShrN NOD SCID, NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidHrhr/NCrHsd, Harlan) mice were scheduled for xenotransplantations. Female mice were housed in single cages and all strains lacked hair and T cells. SHO ®  and Shorn mice also lacked B cells, and Shorn mice additional partially lacked NK cells. We followed published criteria for generating xenografts. At study initiation nude mice were 5–7 weeks old. A total of 5 × 10 6  cells (T265, S462) within 30% Matrigel™ (Corning, GFR)/DMEM were implanted by subcutaneous injection (150 μL) into the right and/or left flank. Blood was collected on day 21 of treatment, 2–3 h after oral application. Plasma was extracted immediately from blood by centrifugation (1000× g , 5 min). ATRA plasma levels were analyzed as described elsewhere [ 28 ]. Pharmacological treatment, tumor volume quantification and preparation Daily oral treatment started 42 days after subcutaneous implantation over a period of 28 days. Ten mice were treated with ATRA (15 mg/kg) or PD0325901 (10 mg/kg). Intake was scored (1 = full intake, 0.5 = incomplete intake, 0 = no intake) and mean values were calculated. Tumor volume was measured three times a week using a digital caliper and calculated according to the formula: v = L × W 2  (π/6) (L-longest diameter, W-width) [ 29 ]. Intra-cardiac perfusion was used for euthanization of mice. Under deep anaesthesia (1.8% (v/v) ketamine and 0.3% xylazine in PBS), peritoneal cavity, thorax, left heart ventricle and the right heart atrium were opened, and 10 mL PBS were injected into the ventricle. For fixation of mice tissues injection of 10 mL 4% paraformaldehyde followed PBS intra-cardiac perfusion. Tumors were dissected and stored in 4% PFA for 24 h followed by paraffin embedding. Tumors were dehydrated in increasing alcohol concentrations in a Tissue-Tek VIP system (Sakura) and embedded in paraffin. Immunohistochemistry of MPNST xenografts was performed using antibodies against S100 (monoclonal, mouse, 10 μg/mL, Ventana S100-4C4.9) to demonstrate human Schwann cell origin, anti-Ki67 (monoclonal, mouse, 0.4 μg/mL, Ventana Ki-67-30.9) to evaluate proliferation fraction, anti-CD34 (monoclonal, mouse, 0.8 μg/mL, Ventana QBEnd/10) to demonstrate vessel and stem cell formation, anti-p53 (monoclonal, mouse, Ventana Bp-53-11), anti-p16 (monoclonal, mouse, 1 μg/mL, Ventana 725-4713), anti-vimentin (vimentin, monoclonal, mouse, 2.5 μg/mL, Ventana V9 and anti-actin (monoclonal, mouse, 0.02 μg/mL, Cell Margue 1A4). Staining was visualized using the ultraView™ Universal Alkaline Phosphatase Red Detection Kit (Ventana, A-PAP method). Staining was performed in the automated staining system Ventana BenchMark XT according to the standard protocols. Statistical analysis ANOVA followed by post hoc  t  test was used to compare differences between groups. Kruskal–Wallis test was applied to compare groups of 4 mice for weight gain. A p value < 0.05 was defined to be significant. The SPSS program (IBM SPSS Statistics Standard) was applied.",Susan Fischer-Huchzermeyer; Levan Chikobava; Verena Stahn; Monique Zangarini; Philip Berry; Gareth J Veal; Volker Senner; Victor F Mautner; Anja Harder,BMC research notes,2018-07-28,10.1186/s13104-018-3630-0,minimal,True
PMID:18451155,Pten haploinsufficiency accelerates formation of high-grade astrocytomas.,"We previously reported that central nervous system (CNS) inactivation of Nf1 and p53 tumor suppressor genes in mice results in the development of low-grade to high-grade progressive astrocytomas. When the tumors achieve high grade, they are frequently accompanied by Akt activation, reminiscent of the frequent association of PTEN mutations in human high-grade glioma. In the present study, we introduced CNS heterozygosity of Pten into the Nf1/p53 astrocytoma model. Resulting mice had accelerated morbidity, shortened survival, and full penetrance of high-grade astrocytomas. Haploinsufficiency of Pten accelerated formation of grade 3 astrocytomas, whereas loss of Pten heterozygosity and Akt activation coincided with progression into grade 4 tumors. These data suggest that successive loss of each Pten allele may contribute to de novo formation of high-grade astrocytoma and progression into glioblastoma, respectively, thus providing insight into the etiology of primary glioblastoma. The presence of ectopically migrating neural stem/progenitor lineage cells in presymptomatic Pten-deficient mutant brains supports the notion that these tumors may arise from stem/progenitor cells.","Materials and Methods Mice and histology To generate Mut3 to Mut6 mice (see  Fig. 1A  for genetic configurations), we crossed Mut3 ( 8 ) or Mut4 males with wild-type ( wt ),  loxP-Pten  ( Pten f  hereafter;  ref. 27 ),  p53 f  ( 28 ), or  p53 f ; Pten f  females. Littermate controls used for this study were with a genotype of  wt  for all alleles,  cre  only, or  Nf1 f/+ ; p53 −/ + ; Pten f/+  without  cre . We maintained the mice in mixed genetic background of C57/BL6, Sv129, and B6/CBA. We observed the mice at least 6 d/wk. For BrdUrd chasing, we injected mice with 50 mg/kg (in PBS) of BrdUrd (Sigma) five times with a 2-h interval and sacrificed the mice 1 d or 1 wk later. We dissected out, processed, and sectioned brains as described ( 29 ). To evaluate brain anatomy, we stained every fifth slide with H&E. Mut3 to Mut6 astrocytomas were independently graded by using WHO histopathologic criteria, nuclear atypia, mitotic index, necrosis, and microvascular proliferation (C-H.K. and D.K.B.;  Fig. 1C ;  ref. 2 ). Whereas grade 2 tumors show nuclear atypia only, grade 3 tumors contain two of the criteria, usually nuclear atypia and mitotic index, and grade 4 GBM additionally harbor necrosis, endothelial proliferation, or both. D.K. Burns, a neuropathologist, was blinded to genotype during the tumor grading. All mouse protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Research Advisory Committee at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Immunohistochemistry We performed all immunohistochemistry on triplicate or more paraffin sections per group. We chose matched sections from control and mutant based on anatomy of the hippocampus and subventricular zone (SVZ). Antibodies used for immunohistochemistry were against Ki67 antigen (Novocastra), glial fibrillary acidic protein (Gfap; Sigma), Pten (NeoMarkers), nestin (BD Bioscience), phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt; Cell Signaling), BrdUrd (DAKO), Olig2 (Chemicon), or doublecortin (Santa Cruz). We used microwave antigen retrieval for all antibodies, except for doublecortin antibody. We amplified and visualized the primary antibodies as described ( 30 ). For BrdUrd/doublecortin double labeling, we treated sections with 2 N HCl for 1 h, briefly washed with 1 mol/L NaHCO 3  and PBS, then blocked with 10% donkey serum before antibody incubation. We visualized the signals with Cy2-donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and Cy3-donkey anti-goat IgG. Magnetic resonance imaging and tumor growth measurement We initiated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies on asymptomatic Mut3 (21–28 wk) and Mut4 (11–18 wk) mice ( Supplementary Table S1 ). We did follow-up scanning weekly over a 1 to 6 wk of period to detect tumor growth. We performed MRI as described ( 8 ), except for using slightly different acquisition conditions for T1-weighed (TR = 200 ms; TE = 15 ms) and T2-weighed (TR = 1800 ms; TE = 80 ms) spin echo multislice axial images. We determined tumor volume on T2-weighed images by manually outlining, with a track ball, the enhancing portion of the mass on each image by using standard “browser” software provided by Varian Inova imaging system. The area measurements were automatically calculated and multiplied by the MRI section thickness to calculate a per-section tumor volume. The total tumor volume was obtained by summing the volume calculations for all sections. After MRI, the mouse was sacrificed and a whole mouse brain was dissected and subjected to histologic analysis, as described above. Neurosphere culture and immunostaining We established and maintained neurosphere cultures as described ( 31 ) with some modifications. Briefly, we dissected out the lateral walls of the lateral ventricle or whole brain tumor and digested by mechanical trituration and treatment with DNase I (250 units/mL; Invitrogen), papain (2.5 units/mL; Sigma), and neutral protease (1 units/mL; Roche). We washed and plated the cells on ultra-low attachment plates (Corning) in DMEM/F12 media (Invitrogen) containing B27 (without vitamin A), epidermal growth factor (20 ng/mL), and basic fibroblast growth factor (20 ng/mL; Sigma). We fed the cells every 2 to 3 d with the same media and passaged weekly by trypsinization with a seeding density of 2.0 × 10 4  cells/mL. All experiments using neurospheres as below were done between passages 5 and 10. For differentiation, we seeded 3.0 × 10 4  cells per well of eight-chamber slide coated with Matrigel (1:20; BD Bioscience) and cultured with Neuralcult with differentiation medium (StemCell Technologies) for 7 d. Then, we fixed the cells with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and performed immunostaining for lineage markers as above (see Immunohistochemistry), except for using TO-PRO-3 (Invitrogen) as counter-staining. We obtained images by using confocal microscopy as described ( 32 ). Antibodies used were against β3-tubulin (TuJ1; Covance), Gfap (Dako), CNPase (Chemicon), or nestin. LOH study and Western blotting For LOH study, we compared genomic DNA isolated from ear, tumor-derived neurospheres, or tumor sections. To obtain genomic DNA from tumor sections, we choose paraffin blocks of well-formed grade 3 or grade 4 astrocytomas. We cut the remaining paraffin blocks after tumor grading into a 25-μm section and immediately isolated tumor region by careful dissection under microscope. We extracted genomic DNA by using QIAamp DNA micro kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instruction. We used genotyping primers for  cre, p53 , or  p53 f  as described ( 28 ,  33 ,  34 ). Primers used to detect  Nf1 f  or  Pten f  allele are described in  Supplementary Table S2 . We performed Western blotting on lysates of neurospheres as described ( 29 ). Antibodies used were against Pten (Cell Signaling), p-Akt, Akt, or β-actin (Sigma).",Chang-Hyuk Kwon; Dawen Zhao; Jian Chen; Sheila Alcantara; Yanjiao Li; Dennis K Burns; Ralph P Mason; Eva Y-H P Lee; Hong Wu; Luis F Parada,Cancer research,2008-05-01,10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-6867,minimal,True
PMID:26883872,3-D imaging mass spectrometry of protein distributions in mouse Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1)-associated optic glioma.,"UNLABELLED: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common neurogenetic disorder, in which affected individuals develop tumors of the nervous system. Children with NF1 are particularly prone to brain tumors (gliomas) involving the optic pathway that can result in impaired vision. Since tumor formation and expansion requires a cooperative tumor microenvironment, it is important to identify the cellular and acellular components associated with glioma development and growth. In this study, we used 3-D matrix assisted laser desorption ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS) to measure the distributions of multiple molecular species throughout optic nerve tissue in mice with and without glioma, and to explore their spatial relationships within the 3-D volume of the optic nerve and chiasm. 3-D IMS studies often involve extensive workflows due to the high volume of sections required to generate high quality 3-D images. Herein, we present a workflow for 3-D data acquisition and volume reconstruction using mouse optic nerve tissue. The resulting 3-D IMS data yield both molecular similarities and differences between glioma-bearing and wild-type (WT) tissues, including protein distributions localizing to different anatomical subregions. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The current work addresses a number of challenges in 3-D MALDI IMS, driven by the small size of the mouse optic nerve and the need to maintain consistency across multiple 2-D IMS experiments. The 3-D IMS data yield both molecular similarities and differences between glioma-bearing and wild-type (WT) tissues, including protein distributions localizing to different anatomical subregions, which could then be targeted for identification and related back to the biology observed in gliomas of the optic nerve.","Materials and Methods Mice Nf1  (WT) and  flox/flox Nf1 ;GFAP-Cre mice (OPG mice) [ flox/mut 13 ] were generated as previously described [ 14 ]. All mice were maintained on a C57BL/6 background and used in accordance with an approved Animal Studies protocol at the Washington University School of Medicine. Mice were euthanized at three months of age, and optic nerves/chiasms collected from anesthetized and Ringer’s solution-perfused mice. Tissues were frozen on dry ice at Washington University and shipped overnight to Vanderbilt University Tissues were stored at −80°C until required. Tissues from one OPG and WT mice were used for 3-D MALDI IMS experiments, 2 separate OPG mice tissues were used for protein identification methods. Immunohistochemistry was also performed on tissues from representative OPG and WT mice. Sample preparation Frozen OPG and WT tissues were embedded in a desired orientation, with the tissues in close proximity to one another, along with fiducial registration points in 2.7% Carboxymethyl cellulose solution (CMC) (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) within a custom-made mold. Further details and images of this process are provided in the  Supplement Information section and Supplemental Figure 1 . Sections of 10 µm thickness were obtained with a cryostat (Leica CM3050S, IL, USA) at −20 °C from OPG and WT tissues including fiducial markers and placed onto poly-lysine coated ITO coated glass slides (45×45 mm) (Delta Technologies Ltd., Loveland, CO, USA). The ITO glass was poly-lysine coated, using poly-L-lysine solution (Sigma Aldrich). A Teflon-coated slide (Electron Microscopy Science, Hatfield, PA, USA) was used to flatten each section, including the surrounding CMC so that the fiducial markers ended up in reproducible locations from section to section. Four sections were thaw mounted onto separate ITO coated 25×75 mm polylysine coated slides for microextraction protein identification purposes, leaving 33 sections for IMS analyses. For each slide, the section number and depth position along the z-axis were recorded. Tissue washes were comprised of 70% and 100% ethanol for 30 seconds each, then in a Carnoy’s wash (6 :3 :1 ethanol:chloroform:acetic acid) for 2 minutes, followed by 100 % ethanol, deionized water, and 100% ethanol for 30 seconds each [ 15 ]. Sample plates were then air dried before high resolution Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) microscopy scans were taken. The tissue sections were measured at 2 13 µm/pixel using a Nikon Eclipse 90i microscope, collecting a DIC microscopy image for each individual tissue section along with its associated rod-based fiducial markers on a Nikon Eclipse 90i microscope (Nikon instruments Inc., Melville, NY, USA). Matrix application Sinapinic acid (Sigma Aldrich) matrix solution (5 mg/mL in 90:9.7:0.3 acetonitrile (ACN):H 2 O:trifluroacetic acid (ACN:H 2 O:TFA)) was applied by spray coating with a HTX Technologies TM sprayer (HTX Technologies, Carrboro, NC, USA), employing eight passes with a flow rate of 0.1 mL/min at a 120°C temperature. The spray head path was alternated at each pass by 90° while travelling at 1300 mm/min during application. Each sample plate was placed into individual petri dishes inside zip lock bags flushed with dry nitrogen before being placed in the −80°C freezer. Sample plates were then brought to room temperature and subjected to a rehydration procedure [ 15 ] before IMS measurement. MALDI IMS data MALDI IMS experiments were performed on a Bruker AutoFlex III mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics Billerica, MA, USA) using a SmartBeam 1 kHz laser with a mass range of 4000–26000 Da and 40 µm spatial resolution. Although the HTX-TM sprayer is capable of coating samples so data can be acquired at very high spatial resolution (10–20 µm, depending on matrix, solvents and spray conditions) the spatial resolution used in this study (40 µm) was chosen based on spectral quality and number of pixels that could be practically managed. IMS measurements were acquired throughout regions of interest that were defined around each tissue section, with margins of around 4–5 pixels beyond the tissue edge. IMS data were also acquired in regions around each of the rod-introduced fiducials for every section. Mass calibration was performed prior to image acquisition using a mixture of insulin, cytochrome C, apomyoglobin, and trypsinogen. The collected IMS data consisted of 33 individual 2-D IMS experiments, all acquired with the same instrumental parameters described above, each data set reporting a different tissue depth. The 2-D IMS data sets were collected using FlexImaging 4.0 (Bruker Daltonics), amounting to a total of about 51 GB of raw IMS data. The 2-D ion images were normalized using total ion current (TIC) in FlexImaging. 3-D Reconstruction of 2-D MALDI IMS The OPG and WT optic nerve samples, mounted next to each other in the preceding workflow steps, were sectioned throughout as 10-µm thick tissue sections and yielded 43 cutting planes, 33 yielded successfully captured tissue sections on glass. Ten sections were lost in the process (at 20, 50, 90, 100, 130, 160, 190, 300, 390, and 410 µm in, starting from 0 µm for the first cutting plane). Resulting in 33 sets of tissue sections on glass. For each pair of sections at a particular depth, a DIC microscopy image was acquired at 2.13-µm spatial resolution, followed by a MALDI-TOF IMS experiment using 40-µm lateral resolution, resulting in a total of 33 individual 2-D IMS data sets and 33 microscopy images. Although one could technically register the different 2-D IMS experiments directly into 3-D space, the quality of the registration result tends to depend strongly on the spatial resolution of the data. Since the 40-µm resolution of the IMS data in this study is relatively coarse compared to the size of the tissue samples, it is nontrivial to avoid registration errors if only IMS data are used. For this reason, we employed a two-step registration approach that uses the complementary DIC microscopy modality and its higher spatial resolution to avoid such difficulties. In this hierarchical approach, the overall 3-D orientation from cutting plane to cutting plane is determined using microscopy-to-microscopy registration, while each individual IMS data set is brought into that same 3-D space by an IMS-to-microscopy registration specific to its cutting plane. All 33 individual 2-D IMS data sets were combined into a single 3-D IMS data set in MATLAB (Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA), and preprocessed using total ion current based normalization, baseline correction, and m/z alignment. This was accomplished using the standard functions provided by the Bioinformatics Toolbox in MATLAB. The resulting preprocessed 3-D IMS data set consisted of 98,971 mass spectra characterizing the nerve tissue samples throughout, with each spectrum describing the range from m/z 4,000 to 26,500 using 31,680 m/z bins. The algorithms that generate 3-D volumes from our data require a regular beam-shaped grid in 3-D space, filled with intensity values, to accomplish their volume generation. We first defined a regular grid (70 by 177 by 52 voxels) that encompasses the entire nerve tissue samples in 3-D space and then projected the ion intensity values for different ion peaks from the 3-D point cloud of physical measurements onto the regular 3-D grid locations. With an ion intensity value available for each voxel in a regular 3-D grid for each peak, the step to 3-D volume visualization was performed using the isosurface function provided by MATLAB. For each peak, this function generates a 3-D volume around all tissue locations where the ion intensity value for that peak surpasses an intensity threshold. We used this approach to generate all 3-D volumes in  Figures 2  and  3 . The 3-D stack visualization of  Figure 1e  was generated using Sliceomatic by Eric Ludlam (The Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA) [ 4 ]. Further details on the registration, preprocessing, and volume construction steps and their parameter values are provided in the  Supplementary Information . Protein Identification Protein identification was performed using microextraction on sections taken from tissues used in the MALDI IMS analysis as previously described [ 16 ]. A separate OPG optic nerve was sectioned at 10 µm increments and subjected to a histology-directed approach for analysis of intact proteins. Adjacent sections were placed onto separate poly-lysine coated ITO glass slides. One plate was stained with H&E and the other was dried and sealed in a zip lock bag under dry nitrogen at −80°C. The H&E stained plate was scanned in bright field using a Nikon Eclipse 90i microscope (Nikon instruments Inc.), and a pathologist interpreted the image to identify sections that contained the largest amount of glioma by size The sample plate with the adjacent sections was then removed from the −80°C freezer, brought to room temperature, and tissue sections adjacent to those identified to contain glioma were removed from the target surface using a scalpel blade. The sections were placed in an Eppendorf tube, ensuring the tissue did not stick to the side of the tube, 10 µL of 55% ACN, 0.5% TFA was added, and the tube was vortex mixed extensively. 4.5 µL of this solution was diluted in 0.1% formic acid and loaded onto a reverse-phase capillary trap column and was analyzed by LC-coupled ETD MS/MS as previously described [ 16 ]. LC-MS/MS experiments were performed on a Thermo LTQ Velos Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Full scan spectra were acquired using the Orbitrap, and MS/MS spectra were acquired using either the Velos ion trap or the Orbitrap. The resulting data were manually interpreted by generating sequence tags of around 4–5 amino acids that were subsequently searched using TagIdent ( http://web.expasy.org/tagident/ ) specifying  Mus  as the organism. Proteins with matching intact molecular weights and containing the sequence observed were processed using protein prospector MS-product ( http://prospector.ucsf.edu/prospector/mshome.htm ). Protein identification was further confirmed by correlating theoretical predicted c and z ions from protein prospector with observed ions in the MS/MS spectra. Further analysis was performed using 2-D LC-MS/MS MudPIT analysis on digested proteins from a separate OPG optic nerve as previously reported [ 17 ]. Scaffold (Proteome Software, Portland, Oregon, USA) was used to analyze and validate protein identifications derived from SEQUEST (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) database searching of the MS/MS spectra [ 18 ]. Further details for the Mudpit analysis can be found in the  Supplementary Information . Immunohistochemistry Optic nerves were prepared for sectioning and immunostaining as previously described [ 19 ]. To detect S100-A10 protein expression, optic nerve sections were incubated with polyclonal anti- S100A10 antibodies (1:1000; R&D Systems) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) in combination with Vectastain Elite ABC development and hematoxylin counterstaining. Images were subsequently acquired on a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope equipped with an optical camera (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA) and Leica LAS EZ image analysis software (Leica).",David M G Anderson; Raf Van de Plas; Kristie L Rose; Salisha Hill; Kevin L Schey; Anne C Solga; David H Gutmann; Richard M Caprioli,Journal of proteomics,2016-10-21,10.1016/j.jprot.2016.02.004,minimal,True
PMID:32733557,"Gene Expression, Network Analysis, and Drug Discovery of Neurofibromatosis Type 2-Associated Vestibular Schwannomas Based on Bioinformatics Analysis.","Neurofibromatosis Type 2- (NF2-) associated vestibular schwannomas (VSs) are histologically benign tumors. This study aimed to determine disease-related genes, pathways, and potential therapeutic drugs associated with NF2-VSs using the bioinformatics method. Microarray data of GSE108524 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened using GEO2R. The functional enrichment and pathway enrichment of DEGs were performed using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes Genomes (KEGG). Furthermore, the STRING and Cytoscape were used to analyze the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of all differentially expressed genes and identify hub genes. Finally, the enriched gene sets belonging to the identified pathways were queried against the Drug-Gene Interaction database to find drug candidates for topical use in NF2-associated VSs. A total of 542 DEGs were identified, including 13 upregulated and 329 downregulated genes, which were mainly enriched in terms of focal adhesion, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, ECM-receptor interaction, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Rap1 signaling pathway, and regulation of actin cytoskeleton. 28 hub genes were identified based on the subset of PPI network, and 31 drugs were selected based on the Drug-Gene Interaction database. Drug discovery using bioinformatics methods facilitates the identification of existing or potential therapeutic drugs to improve NF2 treatment.","2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Microarray Datasets The gene expression profile  GSE108524  of the NF2-associated VSs and normal nerve groups was obtained from the NCBI GEO database. These microarray data were based on  GPL17586  Platform [HTA-2_0] Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 [transcript (gene) version], including 17 NF2-associated VSs tissues and 4 normal nerves. 2.2. Identification of DEGs GEO2R ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/geo2r/ ), a web tool based on the analysis of variance or  t -test, was used to identify DEGs between NF2-associated VSs tissues and normal nerves. The DEGs were identified as the genes with |log FC| ≥ 1.5 and adj.  P  < 0.05. 2.3. Functional and Pathway Enrichment Analysis of DEGs The Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) (Version 6.8,  https://david.ncifcrf.gov/ ) was used to perform GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs. GO analysis contains biological process (BP), cellular component (CC), and molecular function (MF). GO term with the criterion of  P  < 0.05 and false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 and KEGG pathway analysis with the criterion of  P  < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. 2.4. Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) Network Analysis We submitted DEGs in Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes database (STRING,  http://www.string-db.org/ ) to screen the PPI pairs with a combined score of ≥0.4 and visualized the interaction using Cytoscape software (Version 3.7.0.). Finally, CentiScaPe and Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE), a Cytoscape plugin, were utilized to screen PPI network key genes. The default parameters of MCODE were used: degree cutoff ≥2, node score cutoff ≥0.2, k-score  ≥ 2, and maximum depth = 100. 2.5. Drug-Gene Interaction Analysis To better identify potential targeted therapeutic drugs for NF2-associated VSs, the hub genes were mapped onto the Drug-Gene Interaction database (DGIdb;  http://www.dgidb.org ) to obtain potential drug target genes and potential NF2-associated VSs treatment drugs. Visualization of the drug-gene interaction was generated using Cytoscape software (Version 3.7.0.). In addition,  ClinicalTrials.gov  ( https://clinicaltrials.gov ) was used to identify whether drugs have been previously investigated or are being currently tested in clinical trials. 2.6. Human NF2-Associated VSs Specimens Human NF2-associated VSs tissues with the matched normal adjacent specimens were obtained from the Second Hospital of Guangxi Medical University. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Second Hospital of Guangxi Medical University. 2.7. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) Reverse transcription was carried out using SYBR premix EX Taq (Takara, Japan), and SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (Takara) was used for qPCR. We used several sequences: EGFR forward primer 5′-CTACAACCCCACCACGTACC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CGCACTTCTTACACTTGCGG-3′; GAPDH forward primer 5′-CTTCGCTCTCTGCTCCTCCTGTTCG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ACCAGGCGCCCAATACGACCAAAT-3. The results were calculated using the 2 −ΔΔCt  method. 2.8. Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was conducted by SPSS 20.0 software. The statistical significance between groups was determined using a two-tailed Student's  t -test. Values of  P  < 0.05 were considered to indicate statistically significant differences.",Qiao Huang; Si-Jia Zhai; Xing-Wei Liao; Yu-Chao Liu; Shi-Hua Yin,Journal of oncology,2020,10.1155/2020/5976465,minimal,True
PMID:24980480,Novel age-dependent targets in vestibular schwannomas.,"BACKGROUND: Schwannomas are the most common neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2)-associated tumors with significant phenotypic heterogeneity in patients. The most severe subtype has an early and rapid progression and the mild type has a later onset and a less aggressive course. The aim of this study was to elucidate the underlying molecular differences between these groups. We compared the gene expression pattern between patients with early to late age of onset. RESULTS: A gene signature of 21 genes was constructed to differentiate between early-onset and late-onset patients. We confirmed these results by real-time PCR for SNF1LK2, NGFRAP1L1 (BEX 5), GMNN, and EPHA2. CONCLUSION: Genes identified here may be additional aberrations in merlin-depleted cells that govern the disease onset. A significant number of these genes have been suggested as having a role in carcinogenesis and are used as biomarkers for prognosis in several other cancers. The role of these genes in NF2 carcinogenesis and their potential as biomarkers or drug target are worthwhile exploring.","Methods Thirty-seven samples from human tumor (schwannomas) tissues were obtained at the time of surgery in accordance with applicable human ethics regulations (USC IRB protocol # 97–157) and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tumor specimens were divided into two groups (young and old) according to the patient's age of onset. The young-onset group included 21 specimens from patients whose age of onset was less than 16 years old (ranging from 7 to 16 years old). The old-onset group included 16 specimens from patients whose age of onset was 30 years and older (ranging from 30 to 67 years old). The average age of the young group was 12 years old. The average age of the old group was 43 years. RNA was extracted and cRNA were hybridized to Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array (Affymetrix) for analysis of over 47,000 transcripts. The detailed protocol for the sample preparation and microarray processing is available from Affymetrix at  http://www.affymetrix.com  (Santa Clara, CA, USA). For real-time PCR, total RNA was extracted and RT-qPCR was performed in the DNA Engine Opticon 2 Continuous Fluorescence Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Data analysis The Bioconductor limma package [ 20 ] was used to preprocess the expression data from Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Affymetrix Array. To remove batch effects, the complete dataset were normalized by RMA. Before doing statistical analysis, we filter the probe sets by present/absent calls using the Wilcoxon signed rank-based algorithm. Out of 54,675 probes, 42,339 were kept and the remaining ones were removed as ‘Absent’ to reduce false positive rate. We identified differentially expressed gene list by fitting linear models to the normalized expression values. The empirical Bayes shrinkage was applied to  t  statistics using the limma package in Bioconductor. Because patient subtypes were still observed after RMA normalization, balanced samples from the same subtype were selected to identify significantly differentially expressed genes and to reduce the potential of small-sample artifacts. In general, selected genes have greater than 1.5 fold change and less than 0.01  p  value. The analysis of RT-PCR is as follows: Sample RNA was processed in triplicate with serial dilutions of Human Universal Reference RNA (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) on the same 96-well plate. Standard curves were constructed from the Universal RNA wells with arbitrary units of 1 unit equivalent to 1 pg of Universal RNA. Results were plotted as units per nanogram of RNA. Graphically, the middle line of the bar represents mean, bar size corresponds to the difference between lower quartile and upper quartile, and error bars represent the range of the raw data.  t  test  p  values were calculated for each differentiating gene.

PMID:34230204,Measuring the Effect of Cutaneous Neurofibromas on Quality of Life in Neurofibromatosis Type 1.,"OBJECTIVE: In order to explore the use of Skindex scoring in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) across multiple clinical sites and inform design of additional quality of life measures, we analyzed correlations between Skindex, site, and clinical measures for 79 patients with NF1 from specialized clinics in Sydney, Australia (Royal North Shore Hospital [RNS]) and Minneapolis, Minnesota (University of Minnesota [UMN]). METHODS: The relationship between clinical factors and Skindex scores were explored by clinic site and overall. RESULTS: A total of 40 participants were recruited from RNS and 39 from UMN. Female sex, total number of cutaneous neurofibroma (cNF), and whether cNF were present on the face correlated highly with Skindex and not Riccardi scores. The UMN site had lower average scores, but these differences were almost entirely removed after adjusting for age, sex, facial cNF, and total cNF number. CONCLUSIONS: The development of cNF in adolescence and adulthood in NF1 often leads to progressive disfigurement and discomfort and is among one of the most common reasons for patients to seek medical treatment. Skindex has been used to assess skin-related quality of life in NF1 previously but is not specific to NF1. These findings highlight the need for a low threshold for referral to dermatologists for all patients with NF1 regardless of the severity of disease. The finding that facial cNF and higher total number of cNF correlates with poorer skin-related quality of life may benefit design of more specific NF1 skin-related quality of life measures.",,Sheilagh Maguiness; Yemima Berman; Nathan Rubin; Melissa Dodds; Scott R Plotkin; Claire Wong; Christopher Moertel,Neurology,2021-08-17,10.1212/WNL.0000000000012427,abstract_only,False
PMID:35511749,A High-Throughput Screening Platform Identifies Novel Combination Treatments for Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors.,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are soft-tissue sarcomas that are the leading cause of mortality in patients with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Single chemotherapeutic agents have shown response rates ranging from 18% to 44% in clinical trials, so there is still a high medical need to identify chemotherapeutic combination treatments that improve clinical prognosis and outcome. We screened a collection of compounds from the NCATS Mechanism Interrogation PlatE (MIPE) library in three MPNST cell lines, using cell viability and apoptosis assays. We then tested whether compounds that were active as single agents were synergistic when screened as pairwise combinations. Synergistic combinations in vitro were further evaluated in patient-derived orthotopic xenograft/orthoxenograft (PDOX) athymic models engrafted with primary MPNST matching with their paired primary-derived cell line where synergism was observed. The high-throughput screening identified 21 synergistic combinations, from which four exhibited potent synergies in a broad panel of MPNST cell lines. One of the combinations, MK-1775 with Doxorubicin, significantly reduced tumor growth in a sporadic PDOX model (MPNST-SP-01; sevenfold) and in an NF1-PDOX model (MPNST-NF1-09; fourfold) and presented greater effects in TP53 mutated MPNST cell lines. The other three combinations, all involving Panobinostat (combined with NVP-BGT226, Torin 2, or Carfilzomib), did not reduce the tumor volume in vivo at noncytotoxic doses. Our results support the utility of our screening platform of in vitro and in vivo models to explore new therapeutic approaches for MPNSTs and identified that combination MK-1775 with Doxorubicin could be a good pharmacologic option for the treatment of these tumors.","Materials and Methods Cell lines The establishment of the MPNST-SP-01, MPNST-NF1-08, and MPNST-NF1-9 cell lines at the Catalan Institute of Oncology is described in a manuscript under preparation.  Table S1  summarizes clinical and molecular data from the patients and tumors from which the three cell lines were isolated. MPNST-SP-01 was already presented in a previous work from our group ( 18 ). All molecular features of the primary tumors were confirmed in the derived cell lines. STS-26T ( 19 ), HS-PSS, HS-sch2 ( 20 ), S462 ( 21 ), and sNF96.2 ( 22 ) cell lines were previously established in other laboratories. The Human Foreskin Fibroblast (HFF) cell line was purchased from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection). Cells were maintained in DMEM growth medium with 10% FBS (Gibco) and 100 μg/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (BioWest) under standard incubator conditions. All cell lines are validated as  Mycoplasma  negative before starting the  in vitro  validation and were retested every two months. Mechanism Interrogation PlatE (MIPE) Compound Library The MIPE 4.0 library of approved and investigational drugs included 1,912 individual small molecules ( 17 ). It encompasses a small-molecule modulator of over 400 specific gene targets, cellular pathways, or genotypes. Within well-explored targets, there are multiple, redundant agents incorporated as a means to inform the on-target nature of phenotype-to-mechanism data associations and to explore instances where a phenotype is the result of the specific polypharmacology of an individual drug. Quantitative High-Throughput Screen (qHTS) The screening method used in this study in the MPNST-SP-01, S462, and sNF96.2 cell lines was similar to that previously described ( 12 , 23 ). Briefly, compounds in the MIPE library were transferred to columns 5–48, and controls were added in columns 1–4 of a 1536-well assay plate. Column 1 contained media only; column 2 contained cells with added DMSO, while columns 3 and 4 contained the protease inhibitor Bortezomib or the antibiotic Salinomycin in DMSO (final concentration 10 μM). Compounds were tested once as 11-point dose-response starting at a stock concentration of 10 mM (the highest final compound concentration was 46 μM) and diluted threefold with DMSO, as described previously ( 24 ). Relative luminescence units (RLU) for each well were normalized to the median RLUs from the DMSO control wells as 100% viability, and median RLUs from control wells with media only as 0% viability. Curve Response Class (CRC) The activity of the compounds was determined based on their curve response class (CRC), in which normalized data is fitted to 4-parameter dose-response curves using a custom grid-based algorithm to generate a curve response class score for each compound dose-response ( 25 ). CRC values of −1.1.−1.2,−2.1, are considered the highest quality hits; CRC values of −1.3,−1.4, −2.3,−2.2,−2.4, and −3 are considered inconclusive hits; and a CRC value of 4 is considered inactive compounds. Target enrichment analysis Given a selection of compounds, we used the annotated target for these compounds and computed the enrichment for each target class, compared with the background, using Fisheŕs exact test ( 26 ). For this test, the background was defined as all the targets annotated in the MIPE collection. The p-value from the test was adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method ( 27 ). Compound Combination Matrix Screening For the combination matrix screen with the selected compounds, protocols were as described before ( 12 , 28 ). Briefly, compounds were pre-plated using an acoustic dispenser ATS-100 (EDC Biosystems, Fremont, CA). A total of 5 nl of each compound solubilized in DMSO, as well as DMSO control wells, were dispensed with threefold dilutions to generate 6×6 dose-response matrices, first, followed by confirmatory retesting using twofold dilutions in 10×10 dose-response matrices. 5 μl of a cell suspension (500 cells/well) were added directly to the plates immediately after compounds were pre-plated. Two sets of plates were screened. The first one was for cell proliferation assays, where cells were incubated with the compounds for 48 hours, and proliferation was quantified by adding CellTiter-Glo reagent. RLU was measured with the Viewlux (Perkin Elmer) after 15 min incubation at room temperature (RT). The second plate was used for an apoptosis assay, incubating cells with the compounds for 16 hours and adding the Caspase-Glo 3/7 reagent to measure apoptosis. In vitro validation of compound combinations The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of all compounds used in the 21 combinations selected was calculated for MPNST-SP-01 or S462 cells. First, 10,000 cells/well of MPNST-SP-01 cells or 8,000 cells/well of S462 were seeded in 96-well plates (Corning) and incubated overnight. Then, compounds in DMSO were added to the wells in three replicates. Two series of dilutions were performed at two concentration ranges depending on the potency of the compound. Stocks were prepared at 10 mM, and compounds were 10-fold diluted from 1000 nM to 0.1 nM or fivefold diluted from 40 μM to 0.064 μM, using DMSO. After 48h of incubation with the drugs, cell viability was analyzed using MTT (Sigma-Aldrich). Briefly, 14 μl of MTT (0.5 mg/ml) were added to each well. After 2h of incubation at 37°C, media was removed from the wells and 100 μl of glycine buffer solution (25 μl of buffer 0.1M NaCl and 0.1M Glycine with 75 μl of DMSO) was added. Plates were shaken for 15 min and the absorbance levels were read in the VictorTM X5 2030 Multilabel Reader (PerkinElmer). The IC 50  was calculated using GraphPad Prism Version 6 (La Jolla, CA). The percentage of cell viability was calculated by normalizing the values to DMSO control wells as 100% viability. Later, the four chosen synergistic combinations were tested in six additional MPNST cell lines, for which individual IC 50  of compounds was also calculated. For combination assays, compounds were added to wells in three replicates as single treatments or in combination at a fixed 1:1 ratio of the IC 50  of both compounds, and threefold dilutions were performed from 10 × IC 50  concentration to 0.12 × IC 50,  for each compound. After 48h of incubation, cell viability was measured by MTT, and Combination Index values for the combinations were calculated using CompuSyn Software, based on Chou-Talalay calculations ( 29 ). When CI is lower than 0.9 at high values of fraction affected of cells (Fa), we labeled the combination as synergistic. Fa value represents the fraction of cell death by drug treatment, ranging from 0 (no cell death) to 1 (100% cell killing). CI values between 0.9 and 1.1 are indicative of an additive effect and when values are higher than 1.1, the compounds are antagonistic ( 30 ). Apoptosis analysis MPNST-SP-01 and S462 cells were seeded (75,000 cells/mL and 60,000 cells/mL, respectively) in 6-well plates and incubated overnight. Cells were then treated with single compounds or combinations. Combinations with Panobinostat were tested at a fixed 1:1 ratio of the IC 50  and MK-1775 with Doxorubicin was combined at a 1:1 ratio of 3 × IC 50  to visualize the differences in apoptosis activation between the combination and individual treatments. After 24h of incubation, apoptosis activation was evaluated using the Annexin V APC Dead cell kit and SYTOX Green (ThermoScientific) to stain annexin-positive cells, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Samples were analyzed by FACSCanto II (BD Bioscience) flow cytometer. The apoptotic index was calculated as the mean percentage of apoptotic cells in 10 4  cells measured in each of three independent experiments. Alternatively, apoptosis was determined by the percentage of cells in the sub-G1 cell cycle phase using flow cytometric analysis. After treatment, cells were fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol and left for 24h at −20°C. Ethanol-fixed cells were centrifuged at 800 × g, washed, and resuspended in citrate-phosphate buffer (Na 2 HPO 4  0.2M and citric acid 0.1 M at a ratio 192:8, pH 7.8) for thirty minutes. Cells were centrifuged at 400 × g and incubated in PBS supplemented with 1% FBS, 0.2 mg/mL RNAse (Sigma-Aldrich), and 60 μg/mL propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) for 45 min at 37°C. 10,000–20,000 cells per sample of three experiments were measured to determine the percentage of cells at the sub-G1 phase of the cell cycle. The percentage of cells in the G1, S, and G2/M phases was also calculated. Dosage test We adjusted the dosages and the administration schemes for the different compounds ( Table S2 ), using athymic nude six-week-old male mice, in which no tumor was engrafted. Treatments lasted for three weeks and the mice body weight was daily measured to analyze potential toxicity. Carfilzomib and Doxorubicin were obtained from our hospital pharmacy. NVP-BGT226 (S2749), Torin 2 (S2817), and Panobinostat (S1030) were purchased from Selleckchem and MK-1775 ( 31 ) (Adavorsetib, HY-10993) from MedChemExpress. In vivo drug treatment Before drug treatments, an early-passage (P2–P4) MPNST-SP-01 or MPNST-NF1-09 PDOX tumor had to be expanded. To do this, each tumor was implanted in five mice. When tumors reached 1,000–1,500 mm 3 , mice were sacrificed; tumors were harvested and cut into small fragments and engrafted near the sciatic nerve of 60 athymic nude male six-week-old mice. Once tumors reached 300–500 mm 3 , mice were randomly distributed into treatment groups (n=5–10/group): (i) single compound 1; (ii) single compound 2; (iii) combination compounds 1+2; and (iv) control receiving solvents of compounds 1+2. The final tumor weight plot from MPNST-NF1–09 PDOX model presented less than 5 points in some groups due to mice left to perform regrowth testing. Dosages and treatment schedules are specified in  Table S3 . The study received IDIBELL IRB (#PR213/13) and IDIBELL Animal Ethics Experimentation Committee (CEEA-IDIBELL) (#9111) approval. Combinations in which we did not observe tumor reduction by day 18 were further tested until day 25. Twenty-four hours after the last dose, mice were sacrificed and tumors extracted. Tumors were measured using a caliper twice a week, and volume was calculated using the formula “v = (w 2  l/2)”, where l is the longest diameter and w the width. Changes in tumor volume were quantified as the “increased tumor volume” since day 0, where each measurement is calculated following the formula “increased tumor volume = tumor volume day X - tumor volume day 0”. The interaction between follow-up time (in days) and treatment was used to assess the effect of each treatment in terms of volume change compared with the control group. Protein extraction and Western Blot Protein was extracted from control tumors (n=4) and tumors treated with the combinations (n=6) using RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor (cOmplete Tablets, Roche). Briefly, 15–20 mg of tissue was homogenized in RIPA using TissueLyser II (Qiagen) and centrifuged at 16,000 × g at 4°C for 10 minutes. Proteins in the supernatant were quantified with the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (ThermoScientific), using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. For Western Blot, equivalent amounts of protein (20 μg) were separated on 12% Acrylamide gels (TGX Stain-Free™ FastCast™ Acrylamide kit, Bio-Rad). Before transference, gels were activated for 45 seconds by UV radiation using ChemiDoc™ Touch Imaging System (Bio-Rad), so that proteins could fluorescence when exposed to UV. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes from the Trans-Blot Turbo™ RTA Transfer Kit (Bio-Rad) using an established protocol from the Trans-Blot Turbo™ Transfer System (Bio-Rad). After transference, total protein from each lane was detected by exposing the membrane to UV. Then, membranes were blocked using 5% BSA (Roche) for 1h. Primary antibodies against Cdk1 (77055S), phospho-Cdk1 Tyr15  (9111T), Caspase-3 (9662S), Cleaved Caspase-3 (9661S), Histone H3 (9715S), Acetyl-Histone H3 Lys18  (9675S), SAPK/JNK (9252T), phospho-SAPK/JNK Thr183/Tyr185  (4668T), p70S6 Kinase (9202S), and phospho-p70 Thr389  S6 Kinase (9234S) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, diluted 1:1000 in 5% BSA, and incubated overnight at 4°C. Membranes were probed with secondary antibody Stabilized Peroxidase Conjugated Goat Anti-Rabbit (Thermo Scientific), diluted 1:1000 in 5% BSA, and incubated at RT for 1h. Finally, detection of proteins was conducted using SuperSignal West Femto Chemiluminescent substrate kits (Pierce Biotechnology Inc., Rockford, IL). Quantification analyses were carried out by the Image Lab program from Bio-Rad. Each protein of interest was normalized to the total protein of the lane to assess differences due to protein loading. Then, phosphorylated and acetylated proteins were also normalized to their levels of basal protein. Statistical analyses Statistical analyses were performed using Graphpad Prism 6. We calculated differences in terms of cell apoptosis activation between cells treated with combination of compounds and cells treated with single compounds or DMSO-control treated cells (n = 3 in each group), by using the unpaired t-test with a significant level of 0.05.

PMID:27956565,Randomized placebo-controlled study of lovastatin in children with neurofibromatosis type 1.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of lovastatin on visuospatial learning and attention for treating cognitive and behavioral deficits in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). METHODS: A multicenter, international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted between July 2009 and May 2014 as part of the NF Clinical Trials Consortium. Children with NF1 aged 8-15 years were screened for visuospatial learning or attention deficits (n = 272); 146 children demonstrated deficits at baseline and were randomly assigned to lovastatin (n = 74; 40 mg/d) or placebo (n = 70). Treatment was administered once daily for 16 weeks. Primary outcomes were total errors on the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery Paired Associate Learning task (visuospatial learning) and the Score subtest from the Test of Everyday Attention for Children (sustained attention). Secondary outcomes measured executive function, attention, visuospatial skills, behavior, and quality of life. Primary analyses were performed on the intention-to-treat population. RESULTS: Lovastatin had no significant effect on primary outcomes after 16 weeks of treatment: visuospatial learning (Cohen d = -0.15, 95% confidence interval -0.47 to 0.18) or sustained attention (Cohen d = 0.19, 95% confidence interval -0.14 to 0.53). Lovastatin was well tolerated, with no increase in reported adverse events compared to placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Lovastatin administered once daily for 16 weeks did not improve visuospatial learning or attention in children with NF1 and is not recommended for amelioration of cognitive deficits in this population. CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00853580) and Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12607000560493).

PMID:28029918,Activity of Selumetinib in Neurofibromatosis Type 1-Related Plexiform Neurofibromas.,"BACKGROUND: Effective medical therapies are lacking for the treatment of neurofibromatosis type 1-related plexiform neurofibromas, which are characterized by elevated RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. METHODS: We conducted a phase 1 trial of selumetinib (AZD6244 or ARRY-142886), an oral selective inhibitor of MAPK kinase (MEK) 1 and 2, in children who had neurofibromatosis type 1 and inoperable plexiform neurofibromas to determine the maximum tolerated dose and to evaluate plasma pharmacokinetics. Selumetinib was administered twice daily at a dose of 20 to 30 mg per square meter of body-surface area on a continuous dosing schedule (in 28-day cycles). We also tested selumetinib using a mouse model of neurofibromatosis type 1-related neurofibroma. Response to treatment (i.e., an increase or decrease from baseline in the volume of plexiform neurofibromas) was monitored by using volumetric magnetic resonance imaging analysis to measure the change in size of the plexiform neurofibroma. RESULTS: A total of 24 children (median age, 10.9 years; range, 3.0 to 18.5) with a median tumor volume of 1205 ml (range, 29 to 8744) received selumetinib. Patients were able to receive selumetinib on a long-term basis; the median number of cycles was 30 (range, 6 to 56). The maximum tolerated dose was 25 mg per square meter (approximately 60% of the recommended adult dose). The most common toxic effects associated with selumetinib included acneiform rash, gastrointestinal effects, and asymptomatic creatine kinase elevation. The results of pharmacokinetic evaluations of selumetinib among the children in this trial were similar to those published for adults. Treatment with selumetinib resulted in confirmed partial responses (tumor volume decreases from baseline of ≥20%) in 17 of the 24 children (71%) and decreases from baseline in neurofibroma volume in 12 of 18 mice (67%). Disease progression (tumor volume increase from baseline of ≥20%) has not been observed to date. Anecdotal evidence of decreases in tumor-related pain, disfigurement, and functional impairment was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our early-phase data suggested that children with neurofibromatosis type 1 and inoperable plexiform neurofibromas benefited from long-term dose-adjusted treatment with selumetinib without having excess toxic effects. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01362803 .).","METHODS We conducted a phase 1 trial of selumetinib (AZD6244 or ARRY-142886), an oral selective inhibitor of MAPK kinase (MEK) 1 and 2, in children who had neurofibromatosis type 1 and inoperable plexiform neurofibromas to determine the maximum tolerated dose and to evaluate plasma pharmacokinetics. Selumetinib was administered twice daily at a dose of 20 to 30 mg per square meter of body-surface area on a continuous dosing schedule (in 28-day cycles). We also tested selumetinib using a mouse model of neurofibromatosis type 1–related neurofibroma. Response to treatment (i.e., an increase or decrease from baseline in the volume of plexiform neurofibromas) was monitored by using volumetric magnetic resonance imaging analysis to measure the change in size of the plexiform neurofibroma. Methods Trial Oversight This trial was developed by investigators at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in collaboration with the NCI Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), was sponsored by CTEP, and was coordinated by the NCI Pediatric Oncology Branch. Four institutions (the NCI Pediatric Oncology Branch, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, and Children’s National Health System) participated in patient recruitment and data collection. Data analysis was performed by NCI investigators. AstraZeneca provided selumetinib for the trial, approved the trial protocol (available with the full text of this article at  NEJM.org ), and provided financial support for the analysis of selumetinib in plasma samples. AstraZeneca did not have a role in patient recruitment, data analysis, or manuscript preparation but participated in the review and approval of the manuscript for submission. The protocol was approved by the institutional review board at each participating site. All patients or their legal guardians provided written informed consent. The authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data reported and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol. Patients Children 3 to 18 years of age who had received a clinical diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1  and who had inoperable, measurable plexiform neurofibromas 31  that had the potential to cause substantial complications were eligible for participation in the trial. A complete list of the inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in  32 Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available at  NEJM.org . Trial Design Selumetinib (10-mg and 25-mg capsules) was administered approximately every 12 hours on a continuous dosing schedule (in 28-day cycles). The dose of selumetinib was calculated on the basis of body-surface area with the use of a dosing nomogram. The starting dose was 20 mg per square meter of body-surface area (approximately 50% of the recommended fixed dose of 75 mg for adults), with potential dose escalations to 50 mg per square meter. A standard 3 + 3 phase 1 dose escalation design  was followed (details are provided in the  33 Supplementary Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix ). Patient assessments included clinical examinations, laboratory evaluations, ophthalmologic examinations, echocardiography, and electrocardiography at baseline and at regular intervals during the trial ( Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix ). Adherence to the dosing schedule was assessed by administration of the Responsibility for Medication Questionnaire,  by review of a patient diary, and by capsule counts. Evaluations of response to treatment were performed centrally at the NCI by review of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies obtained after cycles 5 and 10 and thereafter after every 6 cycles. 34  The use of standard response criteria (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [RECIST] and World Health Organization [WHO] criteria) 32 , 35  to evaluate the responses of plexiform neurofibromas to treatment has limited applicability because of the complex shapes and slow growth rates of plexiform neurofibromas. Therefore, a more sensitive and reproducible volumetric MRI analysis, which has been established as the definitive assessment method, was used in this trial. 36 , 37  Patients who had documented disease progression at trial entry (i.e., a tumor volume increase of ≥20% within approximately 1.5 years before enrollment) could continue treatment with no limitation of duration if there were no unacceptable toxic effects of the treatment and if no further progression was documented. Patients who did not have documented disease progression at trial entry could continue treatment for a maximum of 2 years unless a partial response was observed, in which case treatment could continue beyond 2 years. 8 , 15 , 32 , 35 Adverse events were graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. An algorithm was developed for the assessment and management of cardiac toxic effects of selumetinib. The maximum tolerated dose was defined as the highest dose level at which one third of the patients or fewer had dose-limiting toxic effects during cycles 1 to 3. With specific exceptions, a dose-limiting toxic effect was defined as any selumetinib-related toxic effect of grade 3 or higher or a persistent (≥7 days) selumetinib-related toxic effect of grade 2 that the patient considered to be unacceptable. Administration of selumetinib was interrupted if a dose-limiting toxic effect occurred. If the toxic effect resolved to within protocol-defined trial specifications, treatment could resume at a dose that was 30% lower than the patient’s previous dose. Treatment with selumetinib was permanently discontinued if the toxic effect did not resolve to meet protocol specifications within the required time frame. A second reduction in dose according to the same criteria was allowed (details of the trial design are provided in the  Supplementary Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix ). Pharmacokinetic Evaluations The pharmacokinetics of selumetinib in plasma were evaluated during cycle 1 among patients for whom consent was provided. Blood samples were obtained as follows: on day 1 before the first dose was administered and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10 to 12, 24, and 30 to 36 hours after administration of that dose; in addition, a blood sample was obtained on day 27 before the first dose was administered. Concentrations of selumetinib and its active metabolite, N-desmethyl selumetinib, were analyzed by Covance Bioanalytical Services.  Pharmacokinetic variables were calculated by means of noncompartmental methods. 38 39 Response Criteria A partial response was defined as a tumor volume decrease from baseline of at least 20% for at least 4 weeks. Disease progression was defined as a tumor volume increase from baseline of at least 20%. Stable disease was defined as a tumor volume change from baseline of less than 20%. Preclinical Trial of Selumetinib Selumetinib was evaluated in the  DhhCre;Nf1fl/fl  genetically engineered mouse model of neurofibroma with the use of an intermittent dosing schedule. Mice received selumetinib twice daily at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram through oral gavage on a 5-days-on, 2-days-off schedule over a period of 8 weeks. Volumetric MRI analysis of neurofibromas was performed at the NCI to assess response to selumetinib (further details are provided in the  Supplementary Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix ).",Eva Dombi; Andrea Baldwin; Leigh J Marcus; Michael J Fisher; Brian Weiss; AeRang Kim; Patricia Whitcomb; Staci Martin; Lindsey E Aschbacher-Smith; Tilat A Rizvi; Jianqiang Wu; Rachel Ershler; Pamela Wolters; Janet Therrien; John Glod; Jean B Belasco; Elizabeth Schorry; Alessandra Brofferio; Amy J Starosta; Andrea Gillespie; Austin L Doyle; Nancy Ratner; Brigitte C Widemann,The New England journal of medicine,2016-12-29,10.1056/NEJMoa1605943,minimal,True
PMID:4622580,Recent advances in neuroblastoma.,"Neuroblastoma is one of the commoner tumors of infancy and childhood. There is great variation in the histological picture and even within one tumor. One unique feature is the apparently high rate of spontaneous regression, particularly during the first year of life. There is also a tendency for neuroblastoma to mature to the more benign ganglioneuroma and recent in vitro studies suggest that a serum factor may influence this process. Approximately 90 percent of patients with neuroblastoma excrete abnormally high quantities of various catecholamines, thus providing a useful diagnostic tool and a means for evaluating the effect of therapy. Treatment requires a multidisciplinary team approach involving a surgeon, radiotherapist and chemotherapist. Prognosis is influenced by a number of host factors and the most important of these seem to be the patient's age at diagnosis and the extent of the disease, although some children with widespread disease appear to have a particularly good prognosis. It is difficult to evaluate the influence of chemotherapy on survival in patients with neuroblastoma but it has not been of great significance. The unique biologic characteristics of this tumor require further study in the hope of providing more effective therapy.",,J Z Finklestein; G S Gilchrist,California medicine,1972-03,,abstract_only,False
PMID:39061138,A Fibroblast-Derived Secretome Stimulates the Growth and Invasiveness of 3D Plexiform Neurofibroma Spheroids.,Plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) occur in about a half of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients and have garnered significant research attention due to their capacity for growth and potential for malignant transformation. NF1 plexiform neurofibroma (pNF1) is a complex tumor composed of Schwann cell-derived tumor cells (,"2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Reagents Reduced growth factor reconstituted basement membrane (rBM; Cultrex TM ) and Collagen I (high concentration; rat tail) were purchased from Bio-Techne (Minneapolis, MN, USA) and Corning (Corning, NY, USA), respectively. Phenol red-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) and MycoZap TM  Plus-CL were purchased from Lonza (Basel, Switzerland). Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was sourced from Cytiva (Marlborough, MA, USA). L-glutamine, MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diplenyltetrazolium bromide) substrates, and all other chemicals, unless otherwise stated, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). CellTracker TM  Orange, CellTrace TM  Far red, Hoechst33342, LookOut RT-PCR kits for mycoplasma detection, and Thermo Scientific Three-Step Stain (methylene blue and eosin) were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). A 24-well cell culture insert (CellQART) was purchased from Sterlitech (Auburn, WA, USA). Human Inflammation Arrays were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA). 2.2. Cells and Cell Maintenance The following immortalized human plexiform neurofibroma cell lines (hereafter called pNF1 cells) described in [ 36 ] were used: ipNF95.11b C, ipNF95.11b C-RFP, and ipNF 05.5. ipNF95.11b C gifted from Dr. Margaret Wallace (University of Florida, USA) was lentivirally transduced with red fluorescent protein (RFP) by Dr. Raymond R Mattingly’s group [ 36 ], and ipNF95.11b C and ipNF05.5 were purchased from ATCC. Primary fibroblasts (hereafter called fibroblasts) from pNF1 patients were purchased from Dr. Margaret Wallace, University of Florida (USA). All cells were maintained as monolayers at 37 °C, 5% CO 2  in growth media (DMEM/high glucose + 10% FBS). Cells were routinely checked to ensure that they were free of mycoplasma contamination. 2.3. Three-Dimensional (3D) Culture We used a 3D rBM overlay model according to previous publications for live-cell imaging by confocal microscopy [ 36 , 37 ]. Briefly, in 3D monocultures of pNF1 cells (8 × 10 3  cells) or fibroblasts (2 × 10 3  cells), cells were seeded on rBM, Cultrex TM : collagen I mixture, on glass-bottomed culture dishes (14 mm in diameter), overlaid with DMEM with 2% FBS in 2% rBM, and grown for 6 days, as illustrated in  Figure 1 . In 3D pNF1 cell: fibroblast cocultures, fibroblasts were plated first on rBM and allowed to attach before adding tumor cells. Then, pNF1 cells were placed on top of fibroblasts, followed by 2% rBM in DMEM. A seeding ratio of 4 pNF1 cells to 1 fibroblast was used for 3D cocultures. pNF1 cells were transduced with RFP or were labeled with CellTracker TM  orange, and fibroblasts were labeled with CellTrace TM  Far Red prior to seeding to distinguish each cell type in 3D cocultures. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst33342. Cell culture media were replaced with fresh 2% overlay every 4 days. 2.4. Image Acquisition for Quantitative Analysis in 3D Optical sections of 9 or 16 contiguous fields, unless otherwise indicated, through the entire depth of the 3D structures were acquired using Zeiss LSM 780 (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Jena, Germany) or Stellaris 5 (Leica Microsystems, Deerfield, IL, USA) confocal microscopes. Images were reconstructed in 3D using Volocity software 7.0.0 (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The number of total cells was quantified using Volocity. X (green), y (red), and z (blue) arrows in the bottom left of each image indicate the orientation of 3D images. Representative images of 3D reconstructions in each figure are shown in different angles to visualize the results more clearly. DIC images were taken using a Nikon Eclipse Ti-S microscope (Tokyo, Japan). 2.5. Fibroblast-Conditioned Media (CM) Fibroblasts (1 × 10 6  cells in a 60 mm dish) in fresh DMEM, i.e., DMEM not exposed to cells, in 2% rBM were added on top of 100% rBM and maintained for 6 days. Media were collected and centrifuged at 1800 ×  g  to remove debris and floating cells, and supernatants were aliquoted to avoid damage from multiple freeze–thaw cycles. The resulting CM from fibroblasts (Fib-CM) or the cell-free condition (control media; CtrlM) was stored at −20 °C until use. For the 3D imaging experiments, pNF1 cells (8 × 10 3  cells) were then seeded on 100% rBM, overlaid with 2% rBM, and grown in the presence of either CtrlM or Fib-CM mixed at a ratio of 1:1 with fresh DMEM; media were replaced every other day. 2.6. sEV Depletion from Fib-CM Depletion of sEVs from Fib-CM was performed, as previously described [ 39 ]. Briefly, media from 6-day monocultures of fibroblasts (1 × 10 6  cells in a 60 mm dish) in fresh DMEM were collected and centrifuged at 3000 ×  g  to remove debris and floating cells, followed by 0.22 µm filtration. The Fib-CM was ultracentrifuged at 100,000 ×  g  for 2 h. The supernatant was used as sEV-depleted Fib-CM. sEV depletion was determined by version 3.3 Dev Build 3.3.104 Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis software (Malvern Panalytical Ltd., Malvern, UK) installed in NanoSight NS300 (Malvern Panalytical Ltd., Malvern, UK). 2.7. In Vitro 3D Invasion Assay We performed 3D invasion assays as previously described [ 38 ]. Briefly, pNF1 cells (3 × 10 3  cells) were seeded on top of 8 μm cell culture filter inserts coated with 50 μL of 5 mg/mL rBM. The cells were allowed to form tumor spheroids for 4 days, which were then incubated for a further 24 h with either control media (CtrlM) or Fib-CM in the lower compartment. Cells on the bottom of the inserts, i.e., invaded cells, were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and stained with Thermo Scientific Three-Step Stain (methylene blue and eosin). After the stained filters were mounted on slides, invaded cells were visualized using a Nikon Eclipse Ti-S microscope (Tokyo, Japan) and quantified using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). Images of seven random fields per insert were acquired, and three independent experiments were carried out. 2.8. 3D MTT Assay A 3D MTT assay was used as an indicator of cell growth and viability, performed as previously described [ 36 ]. On day 0, 1.2 × 10 4  pNF1 cells (ipNF95.11b C) were plated in 150 μL media on 100% rBM with a 2% rBM overlay (DMEM, 10% FBS) per well in triplicate or quadruplicate. Empty cells along the perimeter of the plates were filled with PBS to minimize media evaporation. Twenty-four hours after plating cells, the medium was replaced with 150 μL DMEM (5% FBS). On day 5, 20 μL of 5 mg/mL MTT solution was added to each well, and cells were incubated for 4 h until a purple-colored formazan product was formed. After incubation, the wells were carefully aspirated. The formazan product was incubated overnight at 37 °C in a 10% SDS in 0.01% HCl solution to solubilize the formazan and the rBM. The optical density (OD) was measured at a wavelength of 570 nm with the background absorbance read at 690 nm by an ELISA plate reader (SpectraMax Plus 384 microplate reader; Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). 2.9. Cytokine Inflammation Array CM was obtained from 3D monocultures of pNF1 cells (ipNF95.11b C) and fibroblasts and cocultures of pNF1 cells and fibroblasts for analysis. Experiments were performed according to the manufacturer’s recommended protocols. Arbitrary values of the dot intensity representing detected cytokines were quantified by densitometry and normalized to positive controls on the same membrane using ImageJ software (v1.51w) (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). 2.10. Statistical Analysis Data are presented in box-and-whisker plots or bar graphs as the mean ± standard deviation. In box-and-whisker plots, boxes represent interquartile ranges and whiskers the minimum and maximum values. The significance of differences was evaluated either by one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s post hoc test to correct for multiple comparisons, or by Student’s  t -test for two groups using GraphPad Prism version 8.0.1 for Windows, GraphPad Software (Boston, MA, USA). For all studies,  p  ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. 2.11.

PMID:18636037,The ErbB inhibitors trastuzumab and erlotinib inhibit growth of vestibular schwannoma xenografts in nude mice: a preliminary study.,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the ability of ErbB inhibitors to reduce the growth of vestibular schwannoma (VS) xenografts. METHODS: Vestibular schwannoma xenografts were established in the interscapular fat pad in nude mice for 4 weeks. Initially, a small cohort of animals was treated with the ErbB2 inhibitor trastuzumab or saline for 2 weeks. Animals also received bromodeoxyuridine injections to label proliferating cells. In a longer-term experiment, animals were randomized to receive trastuzumab, erlotinib (an ErbB kinase inhibitor), or placebo for 12 weeks. Tumor growth was monitored by magnetic resonance imaging during the treatment period. Cell death was analyzed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin end labeling of fragmented DNA. RESULTS: Tumors can be distinguished with T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging sequences. Trastuzumab significantly reduced the proliferation of VS cells compared with control (p < 0.01) as analyzed by bromodeoxyuridine uptake. Control tumors demonstrated slight growth during the 12-week treatment period. Both trastuzumab and erlotinib significantly reduced the growth of VS xenografts (p < 0.05). Erlotinib, but not trastuzumab, resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin end labeling of fragmented DNA-positive VS cells (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: In this preliminary study, the ErbB inhibitors trastuzumab and erlotinib decreased growth of VS xenografts in nude mice, raising the possibility of using ErbB inhibitors in the management of patients with schwannomas, particularly those with neurofibromatosis Type 2.","Methods VS xenografts were established in the interscapular fat pad in nude mice for 4 weeks. Initially, a small cohort of animals was treated with the ErbB2 inhibitor, trastuzumab, or saline for 2 weeks. Animals also received BrdU injections to label proliferating cells. In a longer-term experiment, animals were randomized to receive trastuzumab, erlotinib (an ErbB kinase inhibitor), or placebo for 12 weeks. Tumor growth was monitored by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) over the treatment period. Cell death was analyzed by terminal dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). MATERIALS AND METHODS Vestibular Schwannoma Xenografts Xenografts were developed in male athymic Ncr Nu/Nu mice (National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD) from VS specimens derived from four separate patients. All patients provided written, informed consent for use of tumor harvested at time of surgery. The institutional review board at the University of Iowa approved the study protocol and the University of Iowa Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal protocols. Mice were housed in a barrier room and watered and fed rodent chow freely. Acutely resected VS specimens were transported to the laboratory in ice cold Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (Invitrogen, Calsbad, CA), cut into approximately 10 mm 3  fragments, and placed into the interscapular fat pad in nude mice anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg, Hospira, Lake Forest, IL) and xylazine (10 mg/kg Phoenix Scientific, St. Joseph, MO). The grafts were allowed to develop for 4 weeks prior to initiating any treatment. Measurement of tumor volume Tumor volume was determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Mice were removed from the barrier facility and imaged in a small animal MRI (Varian Unity/INOVA 4.7 Tesla scanner, Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA). T2- weighted images were acquired in the axial and sagittal planes by placing an anesthetized mouse inside a 37.5 mm diameter transmit/receive volume coil. Slice thickness was 0.5 mm in each plane. To calculate the tumor volume, the surface area of the tumor on each sequential image was determined using the measurement tool on Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD) by drawing a region of interest encompassing the tumor. The reviewer was blinded to the experimental group. The measurements were repeated three times in both the axial and sagittal planes and the average tumor surface area was multiplied by the slice thickness (0.5 mm) to calculate the slice volume. Slice volumes were halved for the initial and final slices of each imaging series. Slice volumes were then summed for total tumor volume. We also calculated total tumor volumes using the entire volume of the initial and final slices for each series. This did not affect the overall results of the experiments. To calculate the relative tumor growth, the initial tumor volume (V i ) was substracted from the final tumor volume (V f ) and the difference was divided by V i  ([V f -V i ]/V i ) to account for differences in initial xenograft volumes. There was no significant difference in the relative tumor growth rates of the trastuzumab control and erlotinib control animals and the data from these animals were pooled. Treatment with ErbB inhibitors A total of 19 mice bearing human VS xenografts derived from 4 separate patients were analyzed in this study. Table 1 presents the distribution of VS specimens used for these studies. In a preliminary experiment, 4 mice were implanted with VSs derived from two patients and were randomly divided into two groups four weeks after tumor implantation. Two mice received trastuzumab (25 mg/kg in 0.25 ml normal saline i.p., Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) three times per week for two weeks while two animals received saline injections. During the final week of treatment, all mice were injected with BrdU (50 mg/kg i.p., Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) daily to label dividing cells. After the two-week treatment interval, the xenografts were harvested and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). For the longer-term experiment, the xenografts were derived from 2 additional VSs and initial images with MRI were obtained four weeks after tumor implantation. Following the initial MRI, the mice were returned to a quarantine room where they were randomly divided into three groups of 5 animals each (15 total). One group received trastuzumab (25 mg/kg i.p.) three times per week. This is similar to trastuzumab doses shown to inhibit growth of xenografts derived from human carcinomas that overexpress ErbB2 ( 35 , 36 ). The second group was gavage fed erlotinib (50 mg/kg, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA), five days a week. This is similar to erlotinib doses shown to reduce growth of xenografts derived from non-small cell lung cancer and malignant nerve sheath tumors ( 37 , 38 ). Erlotinib was suspended in a solution of 0.5% methyl cellulose (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH) and 0.4% Tween-80 (Fischer Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). The final group of mice served as controls. In this group, three animals were gavage fed erlotinib vehicle and two animals received saline injections for trastuzumab control. Treatment continued for 12 weeks. Following completion of the treatment, the mice were once again imaged to determine final tumor volume and the xenografts were harvested and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Immunofluorescence and TUNEL staining Following fixation, the xenografts were washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose. The samples were then embedded in optimum cutting temperature (OCT) compound (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA) and cryosectioned at 10-15 μm. Frozen sections from the preliminary group of animals were treated with 2N HCl for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.8% Triton-X100 in PBS for 20 min, and then blocked with blocking buffer (5% goat serum, 2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.8% Triton-X100) for 30 min. Next, the samples were incubated in mouse monoclonal anti-BrdU (1:800, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and rabbit anti-S100 (1:800, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) diluted in blocking buffer for 2h at 37°C. Following several washes in PBS, secondary antibodies (anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568 and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488, 1:800 each, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) diluted in PBS were applied for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were then labeled with Hoechst 3342 (10 μg/ml, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 10 min and the slides were mounted and coverslipped. Frozen sections from the longer-term groups of animals were labeled with anti-S100 antibody as above. Following immunostaining, terminal dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) was performed as previously described ( 39 ) and the nuclei were labeled with Hoechst 3342. Digital images were captured on a Leica DMIRE2 epifluorescence microscope (Bannockburn, IL) equipped with a CCD camera and Leica FW4000 software. Determination of cell proliferation and cell death Cell proliferation was determined by assaying BrdU uptake in xenograft frozen sections as previously described ( 31 ). The number of BrdU-positive S100-positive cells was determined from digital images from five randomly selected 30x microscopic fields (331±108 VS cell nuclei/30x field, mean±SD) for each of 3 frozen sections/xenograft (fifteen 30x microscopic fields/xenograft). The average percent of BrdU-positive VS cells was determined for each xenograft. The investigator was blinded to treatment conditions. Cell death was determined using TUNEL to identify apoptotic VS cells as previously described ( 39 ). The number of TUNEL-positive S100-positive nuclei was determined from five randomly selected 30x microscopic fields for each of 3 frozen sections/xenograft and the average percent of TUNEL-positive cells was determined for each xenograft. The investigator was blinded to treatment conditions. Statistical Analysis Differences in cell proliferation and cell death were analyzed by Student’s two-tailed t-test using Excel software (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). Differences in relative tumor growth were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a post-hoc Kruskal-Wallis test using SigmaStat (Systat Incorporated, Richmond, CA).

PMID:24249801,Achieving consensus for clinical trials: the REiNS International Collaboration.,"The neurofibromatoses (NF)--including neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2), and schwannomatosis--are related tumor-suppressor syndromes characterized by a predisposition to multiple tumor types and other disease manifestations, which often result in functional disability, reduced quality of life, pain, and, in some cases, malignancy. With increasing knowledge of the biology and pathogenesis of NF, clinical trials with targeted agents directed at NF tumors have become available. Most clinical trials for patients with NF have used designs and endpoints similar to oncology trials. However, differences in the disease manifestations and natural history of NF (compared to cancers) require the development of new designs and endpoints to perform meaningful NF clinical trials. The Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) International Collaboration was established in 2011 at the Children's Tumor Foundation meeting to achieve consensus within the NF community about the design of future clinical trials, with a specific emphasis on endpoints. The REiNS Collaboration includes 7 working groups that focus on imaging of tumor response; functional, visual, patient-reported, and neurocognitive outcomes; whole-body MRI; and disease biomarkers. This supplement includes the first series of recommendations by the REiNS Collaboration. The hope is that these recommendations will be used by members of the group and by researchers outside of the REiNS International Collaboration to standardize the measurement of outcomes and thus improve clinical trials for patients with NF. Ultimately, we plan to engage industry partners and national regulatory agencies in this process to facilitate the approval of drugs for patients with NF.",,Scott R Plotkin; Jaishri O Blakeley; Eva Dombi; Michael J Fisher; C Oliver Hanemann; Karin S Walsh; Pamela L Wolters; Brigitte C Widemann,Neurology,2013-11-19,10.1212/01.wnl.0000435743.49414.b6,abstract_only,False
PMID:10705390,A unique method for mutation analysis of tumor suppressor genes in colorectal carcinomas using a crypt isolation technique.,"BACKGROUND: Contamination of nontumor tissue makes genetic analysis difficult. For this reason, it is important to obtain pure tumor tissue to ensure accurate genetic analysis. OBJECTIVE: To accurately assess the incidence of mutation of tumor suppressor genes (p53: exon 5-8; APC: mutated cluster region; NF-2 gene: all exons) in 45 colorectal carcinomas. METHODS: We developed an application of the polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequence by coupling them with crypt isolation. RESULTS: Mutations of p53 and APC genes were found in 24 and 22 of 45 colorectal carcinomas, respectively. No mutation of the NF-2 gene was observed in this cancer. Single-strand conformation polymorphism using a crypt isolation technique showed a clear migrating band and no false-positive data. CONCLUSIONS: The crypt isolation technique is a useful method for accurately analyzing genetic alterations. Furthermore, our proposed method confirmed the morphological findings obtained before the genetic analysis.",,T Sugai; W Habano; S i Nakamura; N Uesugi; S Sasou; C Itoh,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,2000-03,10.5858/2000-124-0382-AUMFMA,abstract_only,False
PMID:40842873,Evaluating the effect of voxel size on the accuracy of 3D volumetric analysis measurements of brain tumors.,"INTRODUCTION: Neurofibromatosis type 2 related Schwannomatosis (NF2-SWN) is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of vestibular schwannomas (VS), which often leads to progressive hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction. Accurate volumetric assessment of VS tumors is crucial for effective monitoring and treatment planning. Since tumor growth dynamics are often subtle, the resolution of MRI scans plays a critical role in detecting small volumetric changes that inform clinical decisions. This study evaluates the impact of MRI voxel resolution on the accuracy of manual and AI-driven volumetric segmentation of VS in NF2-SWN patients. METHODS: Ten patients with NF2-SWN, totaling 17 tumors, underwent high-resolution MRI scans with varying voxel sizes on different MRI machines at Yale New Haven Hospital. Tumors were segmented using both manual and AI-based methods, and the effect of voxel size on segmentation precision was quantified through volume measurements, Dice similarity coefficients, and Hausdorff distances. RESULTS: Results indicate that larger voxel sizes (1.2 × 0.9 × 4.0 mm) significantly reduced segmentation accuracy when compared to smaller voxel sizes (0.5 × 0.5 × 0.8 mm). In addition, AI-based segmentation outperformed manual methods, particularly at larger voxel sizes. DISCUSSION: These findings highlight the importance of optimizing voxel resolution for accurate tumor monitoring and suggest that AI-driven segmentation may improve consistency and precision in NF2-SWN tumor surveillance.","Methods Ten patients with NF2-SWN, totaling 17 tumors, underwent high-resolution MRI scans with varying voxel sizes on different MRI machines at Yale New Haven Hospital. Tumors were segmented using both manual and AI-based methods, and the effect of voxel size on segmentation precision was quantified through volume measurements, Dice similarity coefficients, and Hausdorff distances. 2 Methods 2.1 Sampling Ten randomly selected NF2-SWN patient MRIs from Yale New Haven Health, all of whom had undergone annual brain MRIs for vestibular schwannoma surveillance, were included in this study. The cohort had a mean age of 49.5 years (range: 22–65 years) and consisted of seven females and three males; two patients identified as Hispanic. The NF2-SWN mutation was familial in two cases and mosaic in eight. A total of 17 tumors (seven bilateral and three unilateral VS) were analyzed. Five patients had no prior surgical intervention, while the remaining five had undergone a single surgery each, including two gamma knife radiosurgeries and three open resections. This retrospective study was approved by the Yale University Institutional Review Board. Informed consent was waived due to the use of de-identified data. A formal power analysis was not conducted due to the exploratory nature of this pilot study. Future work will involve larger, statistically powered cohorts to enable robust subgroup analysis. Inclusion criteria for patients included patients over the age of 18 and patients with a formal diagnosis of NF2-SWN (with either uni- or bilateral vestibular schwannomas). Exclusion criteria included patients under the age of 18, patients with an undocumented history of NF2-SWN, scans without contrast, scans with large voxel sizes or scan sequences that did not allow for visualization of the inner auditory canal. Inclusion criteria did not include treatment status or presence of other tumors such as meningiomas; therefore, the patient data represented both pre- and posttreatment scans as well as those with meningiomas. 2.2 Images All imaging was conducted at Yale New Haven Hospital (New Haven, CT) using a combination of 1.5T Toshiba (one scan), 3T Siemens (seven scans), or GE systems (two scans). Volumetric analysis was performed on high-resolution, thin-slice axial T1 post-contrast MRI scans. The voxel sizes of each scan are detailed in  Table 1 . Table 1 Voxel sizes of the original scans used. Voxel size (mm) Number of scans 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.75 1 0.4688 × 0.4688 × 0.9 2 0.3438 × 0.3438 × 1.0 1 0.5078 × 0.5078 × 0.9 2 0.4688 × 0.4688 × 1.2 1 0.4297 × 0.4297 × 0.9 1 0.375 × 0.375 × 1.0 1 0.4683 × 0.4683 × 1.0 1 2.3 Manual segmentation Three researchers (M.S., N.J., and S.L.) independently segmented the 17 original tumors using Simpleware (Synopsys, Mountain View, CA) “Paint by Threshold” tool. Each tumor mask was reviewed and corrected by a neuroradiologist (M.H.J.). The final volume of each segmented tumor was then measured using the software's volume measurement tool to establish a baseline prior to resampling. 2.4 3D model creation In addition to manual segmentation, each tumor was segmented using the AI-based auto-segmentation tool in Simpleware, as previously described and validated by Jester et al. Our segmentation process utilized the Simpleware platform by Synopsys, which integrates proprietary AI-powered auto-segmentation tools. These tools leverage a convolutional neural network trained on large, domain-specific datasets to accurately and efficiently segment complex anatomical structures, including VS tumors. To ensure reliability, we validated Simpleware's output against ground truth annotations using metrics such as the Dice coefficient ( 7 ). The volume of each AI-generated tumor mask was calculated using the same volume measurement tool. 2.5 Resampling To evaluate the effect of voxel resolution on volumetric accuracy, the resampling function within the image processing software was used to lower the resolution of the original MRI images by resampling them to larger voxel sizes via linear interpolation between neighboring voxels. Following voxel size modification, the researchers re-segmented the tumors using both manual and AI-based methods as described above, and the resulting tumor volumes were measured. We resampled each scan to four different voxel sizes (0.5 × 0.5 × 0.8 mm, 0.8 × 0.8 × 0.9 mm, 0.8 × 0.8 × 1.6 mm, and 1.2 × 0.9 × 4.0 mm) based on their common use in clinical 3T internal auditory canal MRI protocols ( 9 ). This range allows us to evaluate the trade-off between spatial resolution and segmentation accuracy in tumor volume estimation. Segmentation accuracy across different voxel sizes and methods (AI vs. manual) was evaluated by calculating the percentage change in volume, Dice similarity coefficient scores, and Hausdorff distances, using the original tumor mask as the reference. 2.6 Data analysis Statistical significance was assessed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, comparing resampled tumor volumes across different voxel sizes. Additionally, we applied this test to evaluate differences between AI-based and manual segmentation methods in terms of percentage volume change, Dice similarity coefficients, and Hausdorff distances. All statistical analyses were performed using R (R Core Team), and visualization of volume differences, Dice similarity coefficients, and Hausdorff distances was conducted using ggplot2 and tidyverse ( 10 ,  11 ) for comparative analysis.",Rithvik S Ghankot; Manwi Singh; Shelby T Desroches; Noemi Jester; Amit Mahajan; Samantha Lorr; Frank D Buono; Daniel H Wiznia; Michele H Johnson; Steven M Tommasini,Frontiers in radiology,2025,10.3389/fradi.2025.1618261,minimal,True
PMID:25246427,The impact of coexisting genetic mutations on murine optic glioma biology.,"BACKGROUND: Children with the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) tumor predisposition syndrome are prone to the development of optic pathway gliomas resulting from biallelic inactivation of the NF1 gene. Recent studies have revealed the presence of other molecular alterations in a small portion of these NF1-associated brain tumors. The purpose of this study was to leverage Nf1 genetically engineered mouse strains to define the functional significance of these changes to optic glioma biology. METHODS: Nf1+/- mice were intercrossed with Nf1(flox/flox) mice, which were then crossed with Nf1(flox/flox); GFAP-Cre mice, to generate Nf1(flox/mut); GFAP-Cre (FMC) mice. These mice were additionally mated with conditional KIAA1549:BRAF knock-in or Pten(flox/wt) mice to generate Nf1(flox/mut); f-BRAF; GFAP-Cre (FMBC) mice or Nf1(flox/mut); Pten(flox/wt); GFAP-Cre (FMPC) mice, respectively. The resulting optic gliomas were analyzed for changes in tumor volume, proliferation, and retinal ganglion cell loss. RESULTS: While KIAA1549:BRAF conferred no additional biological properties on Nf1 optic glioma, FMPC mice had larger optic gliomas with greater proliferative indices and microglial infiltration. In addition, all 3 Nf1 murine optic glioma strains exhibited reduced retinal ganglion cell survival and numbers; however, FMPC mice had greater retinal nerve fiber layer thinning near the optic head relative to FMC and FMBC mice. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these experiments demonstrate genetic cooperativity between Nf1 loss and Pten heterozygosity relevant to optic glioma biology and further underscore the value of employing genetically engineered mouse strains to define the contribution of discovered molecular alterations to brain tumor pathogenesis.",,Aparna Kaul; Joseph A Toonen; Scott M Gianino; David H Gutmann,Neuro-oncology,2015-05,10.1093/neuonc/nou287,abstract_only,False
PMID:26219339,A high-throughput kinome screen reveals serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 as a therapeutic target for NF2-deficient meningiomas.,"Meningiomas are the most common primary intracranial adult tumor. All Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2)-associated meningiomas and ~60% of sporadic meningiomas show loss of NF2 tumor suppressor protein. There are no effective medical therapies for progressive and recurrent meningiomas. Our previous work demonstrated aberrant activation of mTORC1 signaling that led to ongoing clinical trials with rapamycin analogs for NF2 and sporadic meningioma patients. Here we performed a high-throughput kinome screen to identify kinases responsible for mTORC1 pathway activation in NF2-deficient meningioma cells. Among the emerging top candidates were the mTORC2-specific target serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) and p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1). In NF2-deficient meningioma cells, inhibition of SGK1 rescues mTORC1 activation, and SGK1 activation is sensitive to dual mTORC1/2 inhibitor AZD2014, but not to rapamycin. PAK1 inhibition also leads to attenuated mTORC1 but not mTORC2 signaling, suggesting that mTORC2/SGK1 and Rac1/PAK1 pathways are independently responsible for mTORC1 activation in NF2-deficient meningiomas. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, we generated isogenic human arachnoidal cell lines (ACs), the origin cell type for meningiomas, expressing or lacking NF2. NF2-null CRISPR ACs recapitulate the signaling of NF2-deficient meningioma cells. Interestingly, we observe increased SGK1 transcription and protein expression in NF2-CRISPR ACs and in primary NF2-negative meningioma lines. Moreover, we demonstrate that the dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitor, AZD2014 is superior to rapamycin and PAK inhibitor FRAX597 in blocking proliferation of meningioma cells. Importantly, AZD2014 is currently in use in several clinical trials of cancer. Therefore, we believe that AZD2014 may provide therapeutic advantage over rapalogs for recurrent and progressive meningiomas.","MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell lines and reagents Cell lines included immortalized NF2-deficient meningioma Ben-Men-1 [ 15 ], immortalized arachnoid AC007-hTERT derived from an NF2 patient expressing heterozygous level of NF2 [ 7 ,  8 ], primary normal arachnoid AC028, and several primary NF2-deficient meningioma (MN) lines. Ben-Men-1 cells and AC007-hTERT were maintained under growth conditions described [ 7 ,  15 ], and all primary lines were established and maintained as reported [ 8 ]. Low passage 293T cells for large-scale lentiviral packaging were obtained from TRC. Insulin was from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Inhibitor reagents included rapamycin and AktVIII (EMD Millipore; Billerica, MA), AZD2014 (provided by AstraZeneca; Wilmington, DE), GSK650394 (Tocris; Minneapolis, MN), Torin1 (kindly provided by Dr. David Sabatini, Whitehead Institute/MIT, Cambridge, MA) and FRAX597 (generously given by Dr. Joseph Kissil, The Scripps Research Institute, Jupiter, FL). Inhibitor treatment times and concentrations are described in figure legends. All inhibitors were diluted as per manufacturer's recommendations. High-throughput shRNA screen The immunofluorescence-based kinome screen was carried out using Ben-Men-1 in a 384-well plate format. The entire kinome library, developed by TRC, consisted of high titer lentivirus for 6,091 shRNAs, cloned into the pLKO-puromycin system, targeting 747 distinct kinases that were arrayed on 18 384-well plates (5-10 shRNAs/kinase). Each library virus plate contained internal negative controls including shRNAs targeting irrelevant reporter genes ( GFP, RFP, luciferase  and  LacZ ), a non-hairpin forming (nullT) control and media alone (no virus). Each screening plate included a positive control lentiviral human  RHEB -shRNA (TRCN0000010424). In addition, a separate library control plate was used consisting of 95 distinct negative control hairpins. Infections included 4 biological replicates, 3 under puromycin (puro) selection (0.75μg/ml, Life Technologies; Grand Island, NY) and 1 without puro. All subsequent steps (addition of lentivirus to fixation) were carried out by TRC using robotic liquid handling. At 18-20h after plating, each shRNA lentivirus was transferred onto cells in the presence of 5μg/ml polybrene (Sigma). The cells were spun at 2250rpm at 37°C for 30min, and transferred to 37°C overnight. The following day, virus was removed and fresh growth media was added (with or without puro). After 72h, cells were incubated in serum free media for 18-20h and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences; Hatfield, PA) at room temperature for 20min. Cells were permeabilized and blocked in one step with 0.2% Triton X-100/2%BSA/PBS for 20min at room temperature followed by co-incubation with AlexaFlour488 conjugated-pS6 (Ser240/244) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology; Beverly, MA) and DAPI (Life Technologies) for 18-20h at +4°C. Analysis for pS6 staining intensity was performed using the Acumen eX3 laser-scanning fluorescence microplate cytometer. Immunofluorescent staining in Figure  1  was visualized on a Nikon (Tokyo, Japan) Eclipse TE2000-U inverted microscope using the EXFO X-Cite 120 fluorescent illumination system. Images were acquired with a Nikon DS-QiMc camera and NIS-Elements BR imaging software. Large-scale lentiviral packaging and infection For large-scale packaging, pLKO-puro-based shRNAs targeting human  SGK1  (TRCN0000194957), human  PAK1  (TRCN0000197238), human  RHEB  (TRCN0000010424) as well as pLKO.1-emptyT (nullT) control (TRCN0000208001) were obtained from TRC, and packaged using TRC methods ( http://www.broadinstitute.org/rnai/public/resources/protocols ). For viral infection, Ben-Men-1 cells were transduced using lentiviral shRNAs for each of the following hairpins: SGK1, PAK1, RHEB, nullT control, as well as no virus control. Spin-infection was carried out at 2000rpm for 1.5h at 37°C, and then cells were transferred to 37°C overnight. The following day, cells were passaged to a 15cm plate, followed by puro selection (0.5μg/ml) for 3 days with no live cells observed in the control without virus. Media was exchanged for fresh growth media without puro prior to all further experiments. Immunoblotting and antibodies SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were carried out as described [ 7 ]. Antibodies for phospho-S6 (S240/244), S6, phospho-p70 S6K (T389), p70 S6K, phospho-Akt (S473), Akt, phospho-NDRG1 (T346), SGK1, phospho-PAK1 (S144), PAK1, and 4EBP1 were from Cell Signaling Technology. Other antibodies included NDRG1 (Abcam; Cambridge, MA), Rac1 (BD Biosciences; San Jose, CA), GAPDH (EMD Millipore), Rheb (3M6 monoclonal; a generous gift from Richard Lamb, University of Liverpool, U.K.) and the NF2 polyclonal C26 antibody has been described [ 52 ]. Generation of isogenic human arachnoidal cell lines using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing To generate isogenic NF2-expressing and NF2-deficient human arachnoidal cells (ACs), we used the AC007-hTERT cell line (AC cells). AC cells were transfected using the basic primary fibroblasts Nucleofector kit and the AmaxaNucleofector II (Lonza; Walkersville, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, AC cells were resuspended in Nucleofector solution, and then transfected using program U-023 with lenti-CRISPR-NF2_sg1 expressing a single guide RNA targeting human  NF2  exon 8, the Cas9 enzyme, and a puro selection cassette (a kind gift from the Zhang laboratory at the Broad Institute and MIT [ 28 ]). Following transfection, cells were re-plated sparsely to form single colonies. Single AC-CRISPR cell clones were picked and expanded for genomic DNA extraction, PCR of human  NF2  exon 8, and Sanger sequencing to confirm in/del mutations. PCR primers:  hNF2  ex 8-F, 5′-GGGACCCAGAAGTC ACAAGA-3′;  hNF2  ex 8-R, 5′-TTTCATTATGCATGCCCAGA-3′. RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis and quantitative PCR AC-CRISPR cells were lysed in TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies), rinsed in chloroform, and aqueous layer was applied to Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen; Santa Clarita, CA) columns followed by RNA purification according to manufacturer's instructions. For cDNA synthesis, the Superscript VILO cDNA synthesis kit (Life Technologies) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions, and quantitative RT-PCR (q-RT-PCR) was carried out in triplicate on a Roche (Indianapolis, IN) Lightcycler 480 (software version 1.5.0 SP3) using iQ − SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad; Hercules, CA). For human  SGK1 , two independent primer sets were used including primer set #1 (254bp amplicon):  hSGK1  qPCR-1F, 5′-ATGACGGTGAAAACTGAGGCT-3′;  hSGK1  qPCR-1R, 5′-GTTCTCCTTGCAGAGTCCGAAG-3′, which were validated by TRC/Broad Institute (primer sequences from PrimerBank,  http://pga.mgh.harvard.edu/primerbank/index.html ) and primer set #2 (132bp amplicon):  hSGK1  qPCR-2F, 5′-GCTGAAATAGCCAGTGCCTTGG-3′;  hSGK1  qPCR-2R, 5′-GTTCTCCTTGCAGAGTCCGAAG-3′. Human 18S served as a control using primers:  h18S -F, 5′-ACCCGTTGAACCCCATTCGTGA-3′;  h18S -R, 5′-GCCTCACTAAACCATCCAATCGG-3′. Melt curves showed single peak specificity for each q-RT-PCR primer set. Statistical analysis For the high-throughput screen, data acquisition, analysis and top hit calling was performed by TRC using robust z scoring methodology to normalize data [ 16 ]. For q-RT-PCR, all experiments were performed in triplicate. Fold changes in gene expression were calculated using the comparative  CT  (threshold cycle) method, and expression levels were quantitated relative to control (normalized to 1.0). Data values are represented as mean +/− SD. Within each group, student  t -test was performed with a value of  p  < 0.05 considered significant. Cell viability assays Cell viability was assessed in 384-well plates using CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega; Madison, WI). Briefly, the next day after seeding, cells were treated with serial dilutions of AZD2014, rapamycin or FRAX597 in full growth media and incubated for 72h (see figure legends for dilution point details). DMSO was used as a control. Luminescence was detected using an EnVision Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer; Waltham, MA) and mean values +/− SD from at least 3 independent experiments were determined for each meningioma cell line. Growth curves were plotted using GraphPad Prism 6.0 software (San Diego, CA) and drug concentrations inhibiting cell growth by 50% (IC 50 ) was determined using nonlinear regression (curve fit) analysis.",Roberta L Beauchamp; Marianne F James; Patrick A DeSouza; Vilas Wagh; Wen-Ning Zhao; Justin T Jordan; Anat Stemmer-Rachamimov; Scott R Plotkin; James F Gusella; Stephen J Haggarty; Vijaya Ramesh,Oncotarget,2015-07-10,10.18632/oncotarget.4858,minimal,True
PMID:25079666,Primary culture of human vestibular schwannomas.,"Vestibular schwannomas (VSs) represent Schwann cell (SC) tumors of the vestibular nerve, compromising 10% of all intracranial neoplasms. VSs occur in either sporadic or familial (neurofibromatosis type 2, NF2) forms, both associated with inactivating defects in the NF2 tumor suppressor gene. Treatment for VSs is generally surgical resection or radiosurgery, however the morbidity of such procedures has driven investigations into less invasive treatments. Historically, lack of access to fresh tissue specimens and the fact that schwannoma cells are not immortalized have significantly hampered the use of primary cultures for investigation of schwannoma tumorigenesis. To overcome the limited supply of primary cultures, the immortalized HEI193 VS cell line was generated by transduction with HPV E6 and E7 oncogenes. This oncogenic transduction introduced significant molecular and phenotypic alterations to the cells, which limit their use as a model for human schwannoma tumors. We therefore illustrate a simplified, reproducible protocol for culture of primary human VS cells. This easily mastered technique allows for molecular and cellular investigations that more accurately recapitulate the complexity of VS disease.",,Nathan M Schularick; J Jason Clark; Marlan R Hansen,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2014-07-20,10.3791/51093,abstract_only,False
PMID:15255999,"Molecular profiling of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors associated with neurofibromatosis type 1, based on large-scale real-time RT-PCR.","BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder with a complex range of clinical symptoms. The hallmark of NF1 is the onset of heterogeneous (dermal or plexiform) benign neurofibromas. Plexiform neurofibromas can give rise to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), and the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. RESULTS: To obtain further insight into the molecular pathogenesis of MPNSTs, we used real-time quantitative RT-PCR to quantify the mRNA expression of 489 selected genes in MPNSTs, in comparison with plexiform neurofibromas. The expression of 28 (5.7%) of the 489 genes was significantly different between MPNSTs and plexiform neurofibromas; 16 genes were upregulated and 12 were downregulated in MPNSTs. The altered genes were mainly involved in cell proliferation (MKI67, TOP2A, CCNE2), senescence (TERT, TERC), apoptosis (BIRC5/Survivin, TP73) and extracellular matrix remodeling (MMP13, MMP9, TIMP4, ITGB4). More interestingly, other genes were involved in the Ras signaling pathway (RASSF2, HMMR/RHAMM) and the Hedgehog-Gli signaling pathway (DHH, PTCH2). Several of the down-regulated genes were Schwann cell-specific (L1CAM, MPZ, S100B, SOX10, ERBB3) or mast cell-specific (CMA1, TPSB), pointing to a depletion and/or dedifferentiation of Schwann cells and mast cells during malignant transformation of plexiform neurofibromas. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that a limited number of signaling pathways, and particularly the Hedgehog-Gli signaling pathway, may be involved in malignant transformation of plexiform neurofibromas. Some of the relevant genes or their products warrant further investigation as potential therapeutic targets in NF1.","Methods Patients and Samples Samples of 14 plexiform neurofibromas and 9 MPNSTs were obtained by surgical excision from patients with NF1 at Henri Mondor hospital (Creteil, France). The plexiform neurofibromas (deep lesions involving a plexus of nerves) were large, had a nodular aspect, and severely deformed the affected tissues. They were all S100-positive by immunostaining. The main clinical and histological characteristics of the 9 patients with MPNSTs are shown in Table  1 . The MPNSTs all arose from plexiform neurofibromas and showed very weak S100 immunostaining. Ten dermal neurofibromas were used as ""normal"" controls, as they are not at risk of developing into malignant MPNSTs. Neurofibromas are heterogeneous benign tumors composed of Schwann cells, neurons, fibroblasts, mast cells and other cells, and have no ""normal"" tissue equivalent. The 489 gene expression levels in plexiform neurofibromas and MPNSTs were thus expressed relative to the expression levels in dermal neurofibromas. The dermal neurofibromas were obtained by laser excision from patients free of plexiform neurofibromas. They affected the dermis and subcutis, and were soft, slightly elevated, painless and smaller than 20 mm. Immediately after surgery the tumor samples were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until RNA extraction. Real-time RT-PCR Theoretical basis Reactions are characterized by the point during cycling when amplification of the PCR product is first detected, rather than the amount of PCR product accumulated after a fixed number of cycles. The larger the starting quantity of the target molecule, the earlier a significant increase in fluorescence is observed. The parameter C t  (threshold cycle) is defined as the fractional cycle number at which the fluorescence generated by cleavage of a TaqMan probe (or by SYBR green dye-amplicon complex formation) passes a fixed threshold above baseline. The increase in fluorescent signal associated with exponential growth of PCR products is detected by the laser detector of the ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), using PE Biosystems analysis software according to the manufacturer's manuals. The precise amount of total RNA added to each reaction mix (based on optical density) and its quality (i.e. lack of extensive degradation) are both difficult to assess. We therefore also quantified transcripts of two endogenous RNA control genes involved in two cellular metabolic pathways, namely  TBP  (Genbank accession  NM_003194 ), which encodes the TATA box-binding protein (a component of the DNA-binding protein complex TFIID), and  RPLP0  (also known as 36B4;  NM_001002 ), which encodes human acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0. Each sample was normalized on the basis of its  TBP  (or  RPLPO ) content. Results, expressed as N-fold differences in target gene expression relative to the  TBP  (or  RPLPO ) gene, and termed ""N target "", were determined as  , where the ΔCt value of the sample was determined by subtracting the average Ct value of the target gene from the average Ct value of the  TBP  ( or RPLP0 ) gene [ 56 , 57 ]. The N target  values of the samples were subsequently normalized such that the mean of the dermal neurofibroma N target  values was 1. Primers and controls Primers for  TBP ,  RPLP0  and the 489 target genes (List in annex; supplementary information) were chosen with the assistance of the Oligo 5.0 computer program (National Biosciences, Plymouth, MN). We conducted searches in dbEST, htgs and nr databases to confirm the total gene specificity of the nucleotide sequences chosen as primers, and the absence of single nucleotide polymorphisms. In particular, the primer pairs were selected to be unique relative to the sequences of closely related family member genes or of the corresponding retropseudogenes. To avoid amplification of contaminating genomic DNA, one of the two primers was placed at the junction between two exons, if possible. In general, amplicons were between 70 and 120 nucleotides long. Gel electrophoresis was used to verify the specificity of PCR amplicons. For each primer pair, we performed no-template control (NTC) and no-reverse-transcriptase control (RT negative) assays, which produced negligible signals (usually > 40 in Ct value), suggesting that primer-dimer formation and genomic DNA contamination effects were negligible. RNA extraction Total RNA was extracted from frozen tumor samples by using the acid-phenol guanidinium method. The quality of the RNA samples was determined by electrophoresis through agarose gels and staining with ethidium bromide, the 18S and 28S RNA bands being visualized under ultraviolet light. cDNA Synthesis Total RNA was reverse transcribed in a final volume of 20 μl containing 1X RT buffer (500 μM each dNTP, 3 mM MgCl2, 75 mM KCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3), 20 units of RNasin RNase inhibitor (Promega, Madison, WI), 10 mM DDT, 100 units of Superscript II RNase H-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France), 3 μM random hexamers (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) and 100 ng of total RNA. The samples were incubated at 20°C for 10 min and 42°C for 30 min, and reverse transcriptase was inactivated by heating at 99°C for 5 min and cooling at 5°C for 5 min. PCR amplification All PCR reactions were performed using an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems) and either the TaqMan ®  PCR Core REAGENTS Kit or the SYBR ®  Green PCR Core Reagents kit (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems). Ten microliters of diluted sample cDNA (produced from 2 ng of total RNA) was added to 15 microliters of the PCR master-mix. The thermal cycling conditions comprised an initial denaturation step at 95°C for 10 min, and 50 cycles at 95°C for 15 s and 65°C for 1 min. Statistical Analysis As the mRNA levels did not fit a Gaussian distribution, (a) the mRNA levels in each subgroup of samples were characterized by their median values and ranges, rather than their mean values and coefficients of variation, and (b) relationships between the molecular markers and clinical and histological parameters were tested using the non parametric Mann-Whitney  U  test [ 58 ]. Differences between two populations were judged significant at confidence levels greater than 95% (p < 0.05). To visualize the capacity of a given molecular marker to discriminate between two populations (in the absence of an arbitrary cutoff value), we summarized the data in a ROC ( receiver operating characteristic ) curve [ 59 ]. This curve plots the sensitivity (true positives) on the  Y  axis against 1-specificity (false positives) on the  X  axis, considering each value as a possible cutoff. The AUC (area under curve) was calculated as a single measure for the discriminatory capacity of each molecular marker. When a molecular marker had no discriminatory value, the ROC curve lies close to the diagonal and the AUC is close to 0.5. In contrast, when a molecular marker has strong discriminatory value, the ROC curve moves to the upper left-hand corner and the AUC is close to 1.0.",Pascale Lévy; Dominique Vidaud; Karen Leroy; Ingrid Laurendeau; Janine Wechsler; Giulia Bolasco; Béatrice Parfait; Pierre Wolkenstein; Michel Vidaud; Ivan Bièche,Molecular cancer,2004-07-15,10.1186/1476-4598-3-20,minimal,True
PMID:40737523,Clinician Perspectives of a Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Based 3D Volumetric Analysis Tool for Neurofibromatosis Type 2-Related Schwannomatosis: Qualitative Pilot Study.,"BACKGROUND: Accurate monitoring of tumor progression is crucial for optimizing outcomes in neurofibromatosis type 2-related schwannomatosis. Standard 2D linear analysis on magnetic resonance imaging is less accurate than 3D volumetric analysis, but since 3D volumetric analysis is time-consuming, it is not widely used. To shorten the time required for 3D volumetric analysis, our lab has been developing an automated artificial intelligence-driven 3D volumetric tool. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to survey and interview clinicians treating neurofibromatosis type 2-related schwannomatosis to understand their views on current 2D analysis and to gather insights for the design of an artificial intelligence-driven 3D volumetric analysis tool. METHODS: Interviews examined for the following themes: (1) shortcomings of the currently used linear analysis, (2) utility of 3D visualizations, (3) features of an interactive 3D modeling software, and (4) lack of a gold standard to assess the accuracy of 3D volumetric analysis. A Likert scale questionnaire was used to survey clinicians' levels of agreement with 25 statements related to 2D and 3D tumor analyses. RESULTS: A total of 14 clinicians completed a survey, and 12 clinicians were interviewed. Specialties ranged across neurosurgery, neuroradiology, neurology, oncology, and pediatrics. Overall, clinicians expressed concerns with current linear techniques, with clinicians agreeing that linear measurements can be variable with the possibility of two different clinicians calculating 2 different tumor sizes (mean 4.64, SD 0.49) and that volumetric measurements would be more helpful for determining clearer thresholds of tumor growth (mean 4.50, SD 0.52). For statements discussing the capabilities of a 3D volumetric analysis and visualization software, clinicians expressed strong interest in being able to visualize tumors with respect to critical brain structures (mean 4.36, SD 0.74) and in forecasting tumor growth (mean 4.77, SD 0.44). CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians were overall in favor of the adoption of 3D volumetric analysis techniques for measuring vestibular schwannoma tumors but expressed concerns regarding the novelty and inexperience surrounding these techniques. However, clinicians felt that the ability to visualize tumors with reference to critical structures, to overlay structures, to interact with 3D models, and to visualize areas of slow versus rapid growth in 3D would be valuable contributions to clinical practice. Overall, clinicians provided valuable insights for designing a 3D volumetric analysis tool for vestibular schwannoma tumor growth. These findings may also apply to other central nervous system tumors, offering broader utility in tumor growth assessments.","Methods Interviews examined for the following themes: (1) shortcomings of the currently used linear analysis, (2) utility of 3D visualizations, (3) features of an interactive 3D modeling software, and (4) lack of a gold standard to assess the accuracy of 3D volumetric analysis. A Likert scale questionnaire was used to survey clinicians’ levels of agreement with 25 statements related to 2D and 3D tumor analyses. Methods Study Sample This study involved surveys and interviews with clinicians specializing in the treatment and diagnosis of NF2-related schwannomatosis. To be eligible for inclusion, participants had to be clinicians directly involved in the care of NF2-SWN patients and willing to complete a survey or participate in an interview. NF2-SWN patients were not included, as the software is intended primarily as a clinical tool rather than a visualization tool for patients. Clinicians with direct experience in diagnosing and treating NF2-SWN across various specialties, including neurology, neuro-oncology, neurosurgery, neuroradiology, and pediatrics, whose names were found on the Children’s Tumor Foundation website were recruited for this study. Upon identifying clinicians’ names and contact information, emails were subsequently sent to these clinicians, outlining the proposed 3D segmentation software and inviting them to participate in a survey and an interview. Ethical Considerations Ethics approval was obtained from the Yale University Institutional Review Board (approval number: 2000034426) through an exempt review. Verbal informed consent was obtained from all interviewed and surveyed participants before the collection of data, and the institutional review board waived the need for written consent. The clinicians providing the data were deidentified but were not anonymous. No vulnerable populations were included in the data collection of this study. Additional consent was not necessary for any secondary analyses of the collected data. No compensation was provided for participation in this study. Survey Data Collection and Analysis Surveys were conducted via Qualtrics and included 25 statements organized into eight categories as follows: (1) linear/volumetric analysis, (2) markers of VS tumor progression, (3) surgical planning for 2D MRI scans of VS tumors, (4) 3D volumetric analysis, (5) 3D visualization of VS tumors, (6) surgical planning using 3D models of VS tumors, (7) postintervention monitoring, and (8) general questions ( Textbox 1 ). The survey questions were structured as a Likert scale questionnaire, where clinicians indicated their level of agreement with each statement on a scale of 1 to 5, ranging from “completely disagree” to “completely agree.” Additionally, clinicians were asked demographic questions about their clinical specialties, years of experience, and the number of VS cases they had treated. Textbox 1. A total of 25 total statements were addressed in both the interviews and in the questionnaire. In the surveys, all clinicians selected 1 out of 5 choices based on how much they agreed with each statement. In the interviews, clinicians had the opportunity to share open-ended responses to the statements. 
 Category 1: 2D linear/volumetric analysis 
 1. Linear analysis of vestibular schwannoma (VS) tumors reflects tumor size 2. Volumetric analysis of tumors reflects tumor size 3. Linear measurements are sensitive to small changes in tumor diameter 4. Two different clinicians can review the same magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but calculate two different tumor sizes. 5. The orientations of bi- and uni-dimensional linear measurements can change from one MRI to the next for a single patient. 6. Patient position in MRI machines influences the orientations of MRI scans, affecting linear measurements. 7. It can be difficult to make a decision about tumor growth from a series of linear measurements due to the lack of clear progression thresholds. 
 Category 2: markers of VS tumor progression 
 8. Change in tumor size is the most important marker of VS tumor progression 9. Edema and mass effects on surrounding critical structures are good markers of VS tumor progression. 
 Category 3: surgical planning with 2D MRI scans of VS tumors 
 10. It is simple to determine the best approach to tumor resection before operation (location or angle of entry, how to best maximize extent of resection while avoiding functional areas) from 2D MRI scans. 11. The cranial nerves and blood vessels that need to be avoided during intervention can easily be determined through analysis of MRI scans. 
 Category 4: 3D volumetric analysis 
 12. 3D volumetric measurements would be more helpful in determining clearer thresholds of tumor growth than linear measurements.  13. 3D volumetric analysis would standardize measurements by reducing variation in measurements of tumor size taken by different clinicians.  14. 3D volumetric analysis would lead to more informed clinical decision-making. 
 Category 5: 3D visualization of VS tumors 
 15. 3D volumetric measurements must be combined with 3D visualization of the VS tumor to be clinically meaningful. 16. The ability to interact with 3D models of VS tumors in the cerebral space (rotate, zoom, adding or removing structures from view) would provide information helpful for surgical planning. 17. Growth in tumor boundaries observed by overlaying 3D models of VS tumors from MRI scans collected over time is easier to interpret than comparing the same MRI scans in 2D. 18. 3D visualization of VS tumors and their location relative to critical brain structures (cranial nerves, brainstem, etc.) would be helpful in patient care. 19. Knowing regions of rapid versus slow tumor growth on VS tumors would be helpful in treatment planning. 
 Category 6: surgical planning with 3D models of VS tumors 
 20. 3D visualization of VS tumors in the surrounding cerebral space (relative to critical brain structures) would aid in surgical planning. 21. 3D models of VS tumors would lead to more informed decisions of the type of intervention to perform (eg, different approaches of tumor resection and gamma knife) 
 Category 7: postintervention monitoring 
 22. Being able to distinguish between post-op changes and residual tumor progression would significantly improve clinical decision-making (ex. After gamma knife). 23. Automatic diagnosis of tumor progress, regression/response, or stability according to changes in size over time would aid treatment planning. 
 Category 8: general 
 24. Having the ability to forecast tumor growth will significantly improve clinical decision-making. 25. 3D visualizations of VS tumors would significantly improve patient education by allowing patients to see their tumors in 3D space. In the end, individual survey statement responses were statistically analyzed and means and SD were reported. Higher means indicated that clinicians agreed more with the statement. Following statistical analysis, survey statements relating to tangible features or capabilities of the software were grouped together, and the top four features that clinicians favored based on mean agreement levels were determined. Interview Data Collection and Analysis Two members of the research team (AH and DW) with prior training in conducting semistructured interviews and focus groups jointly facilitated each focus group discussion (FGD) session; the senior author (FB) conducted all the individual interviews. The topics discussed within these discussions mirrored the 25 survey statements reframed as open-ended questions ( Textbox 1 ). The FGD sessions lasted approximately one hour, and the individual interviews lasted approximately 30 minutes. Audio recordings from the FGDs and individual interviews were then transcribed verbatim by Zoom’s transcription feature and returned to the research team for proofreading and subsequent analysis. The data analysis team (AH, DW, and FB) met regularly to develop the codebook and note potential emergent themes. Interview sessions and data analysis continued simultaneously and iteratively until the team determined that data saturation had been reached [ 17 ]. Beginning with an initial set of codes derived from the domains included in the Interview Guide, the coding team members independently coded each transcript to identify potential additional codes. The team then discussed the merits of each existing or new code and created definitions for each for inclusion in the final version of the codebook. The codes were inductively developed, grounded in the data, iteratively reviewed, and revised based on the team’s discussion of additional independently coded transcripts. The total interobserver agreement of the reviewers was assessed over the course of the reviews. The overall total interobserver agreement was 92% across the study. The codes assigned to each quote were then reviewed for a final time by the first author as part of entering the coded transcripts using Dedoose. Using thematic analysis, the team identified patterns across the entire data set to arrive at a final, parsimonious set of themes. The analysis also examined the data for any “negative” instances where the data did not fit the domains or themes or where no information on specific topics queried was obtained. In addition to the qualitative analysis, descriptive statistics were generated to describe the study sample.",Shelby T Desroches; Alice Huang; Rithvik Ghankot; Steven M Tommasini; Daniel H Wiznia; Frank D Buono,JMIR human factors,2025-07-30,10.2196/71728,minimal,True
PMID:35723774,A randomized controlled trial of remote microphone listening devices to treat auditory deficits in children with neurofibromatosis type 1.,"BACKGROUND: A high proportion of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) present with functional hearing deficiency as a result of neural abnormality in the late auditory brainstem. METHODS: In this randomized, two-period crossover study, we investigated the hypothesis that remote-microphone listening devices can ameliorate hearing and communication deficits in affected school-aged children (7-17 years). Speech perception ability in background noise was evaluated in device-active and inactive conditions using the CNC-word test. Participants were then randomized to one of two treatment sequences: (1) inactive device for two weeks (placebo), followed by active device use for two weeks, or (2) active device for 2 weeks, followed by inactive device for 2 weeks. Listening and communication ratings (LIFE-R Questionnaire) were obtained at baseline and at the end of each treatment phase. RESULTS: Each participant demonstrated functional hearing benefits with remote-microphone use. All showed a speech perception in noise increase when the device was activated with a mean phoneme-score difference of 16.4% (p < 0.001) and reported improved listening/communication abilities in the school classroom (mean difference: 23.4%; p = 0.017). DISCUSSION: Conventional hearing aids are typically ineffective as a treatment for auditory neural dysfunction, making sounds louder, but not clearer for affected individuals. In this study, we demonstrate that remote-microphone technologies are acceptable/tolerable in pediatric patients with NF1 and can ameliorate their hearing deficits. CONCLUSION: Remote-microphone listening systems offer a viable treatment option for children with auditory deficits associated with NF1.","Methods In this randomized, two-period crossover study, we investigated the hypothesis that remote-microphone listening devices can ameliorate hearing and communication deficits in affected school-aged children (7–17 years).

PMID:40529476,Using Durometers to Quantify Stiffness as an Outcome Measure for Cutaneous Neurofibroma in Neurofibromatosis Type 1.,"Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 develop multiple cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs) for which no effective drug therapy exists; mainstay treatment remains physical removal. However, clinical trials testing new drugs are ongoing, and quantitative techniques based on cNF biology are needed to measure changes in cNF after treatment. cNF tumor bulk is composed of extracellular matrix and inflammatory cells that dictate their stiffness. No studies have reported measuring the stiffness change in neurofibromas, which would indicate shrinking of the tumor bulk. The goal of this study was to evaluate 2 different instruments-the Rex Gauge durometer (denoted as REX) and the Delfin SkinFibroMeter (denoted as DELFIN)-in reproducibly measuring cNF stiffness. Ninety-seven neurofibromas from patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 on different skin areas were measured at each of 2 visits about 2 weeks apart. The DELFIN had moderate within-tumor agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.607, 95% confidence interval = 0.512-0.691) and moderate within-visit agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.732, 95% confidence interval = 0.665-0.786), and the REX had moderate within-tumor agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.740, 95% confidence interval = 0.631-0.816) and excellent within-visit agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.937, 95% confidence interval = 0.913-0.953), while accounting for repeated visits and tumor measurements clustered within each patient. We found that both the DELFIN and REX are easy to use and reliable, providing consistent quantification of cNF stiffness.","Materials and Methods Instruments to measure cNF stiffness We tested 2 different instruments for their ability to accurately and reproducibly measure cNF stiffness. One was the Rex Gauge durometer (REX) produced by Rex Gauge LLC ( Figure 2 a), and the other was the SkinFibroMeter (DEFLIN) made by Delfin Technologies ( Figure 2 b). Both instruments are portable, noninvasive, and easy to use. The REX is primarily used in manufacturing and is the international standard for determining the hardness of nonmetallic materials such as plastic, rubbers, polymers, alloys, etc. It has an internal spring that exerts a load on the material being measured. A small blunt tip at the end of the durometer retracts inside the unit when held against the material being measured and reads the measurements. The REX uses the Shore Hardness Scale (measured in scale units), which ranges from 0 to 100, with 0 being the softest. Different models of the REX are available for varying hardness levels, with the Rex Gauge OO being specifically designed to measure the hardness of foams, gels, and animal tissue. The Rex Gauge durometer was the first instrument used to measure skin “hardness” ( Falanga and Bucalo, 1993 ). The DEFLIN is designed and marketed as an instrument to specifically measure tissue induration, assessing “tissue stiffness in quantitative units.” It has a plate at the end with a 1.25-mm indenter tip and 2 sensors: one that controls time and pressure against the skin and another that measures the force of the indenter (in Newtons) against the skin. Similar to the REX, the DEFLIN is held vertically against the skin, and the measurement is instantaneous (∼0.5 seconds). There is no alteration of the skin surface, and it is painless. Numerous publications report using the DEFLIN to measure tissue stiffness in various dermatologic conditions, including scarring, skin fibrosis in patients with secondary lymphedema, and localized scleroderma ( Bernabe et al, 2024 ;  Nguyen et al, 2019 ;  Romagnuolo et al, 2023 ;  Seo et al, 2017 ;  Sun et al, 2017 ). However, to the best of our knowledge, neither the DEFLIN nor the REX has been used to measure cNF stiffness. Statistical analysis The agreement among measurements for each instrument was first assessed without accounting for clustering. Naïve methods, including LOAs and Bland–Altman plots, were used to assess and visualize the agreement between 2 measurements. The mean difference represents the average difference between the 2 measurements. The LOAs were set at mean difference ± 1.96 × SD of the differences, representing the range within which most differences (95%) between methods are expected to fall. If the mean difference is close to zero, the measurements have no systematic bias. If most points fall within the LOAs, the methods are considered to have good agreement. For DEFLIN and REX’s 3 repeated measurements, all possible pairwise differences within each subject were computed and displayed in a single Bland–Altman plot. For comparison between the values obtained at visit 1 and visit 2, the average of the 3 repeated measurements was used. The Lin's CCC was also used to evaluate the agreement between the values obtained on visit 1 and visit 2. A CCC of 0.81–1.00 was considered as almost perfect agreement, 0.61–0.80 was considered as substantial agreement, and 0.41–0.60 was considered as moderate agreement ( Fleiss and Cohen, 1973 ). The agreement (reliability or consistency) among repeated measurements was further assessed using the ICCs from the multilevel linear mixed-effects model with patient-level, tumor-level, and visit-level random effects, accounting for the clustered data structure: measurements were clustered within a visit within a tumor (cNF) within a patient. The ICC quantifies the correlation between a pair of measurements (or observations) at each nested level of the linear mixed-effects model. Random intercept variance components, along with corresponding proportions, and ICCs from the linear mixed-effects model were computed. An ICC >0.90 was considered as excellent agreement, that between 0.75 and 0.9 was considered as good agreement, that between 0.5 and 0.75 was considered as moderate agreement, and that <0.50 was considered as poor agreement ( Bobak et al, 2018 ). The 95% CI of ICC was obtained by the model-based semiparametric bootstrap for mixed models. The number of bootstrap replicates was 1000. The relationship between measurement values from the 2 instruments was explored and visualized using a scatter plot by both linear fit and locally estimated scatterplot smoothing fit, without accounting for clustering. A Pearson correlation coefficient >0.7 was considered as a strong positive correlation. Statistical analyses were performed using R 4.4.2 software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).",Bahir Chamseddin; Renee M McKay; Ruyun Jin; Hong Zhu; Lu Q Le,JID innovations : skin science from molecules to population health,2025-07,10.1016/j.xjidi.2025.100380,minimal,True
PMID:31836719,Engaging a community to enable disease-centric data sharing with the NF Data Portal.,A significant challenge facing rare disease communities is finding a sufficient quantity and variety of data to develop and test disease-specific hypotheses. Here we describe an approach to data sharing in which stakeholders from the neurofibromatosis (NF) research community collaborated to develop a disease-focused data portal with the goal of supporting scientists within and outside the community as well as clinicians and patient advocates.,,Robert J Allaway; Salvatore La Rosa; Sharad Verma; Lara Mangravite; Justin Guinney; Jaishri Blakeley; Annette Bakker; Sara J C Gosline,Scientific data,2019-12-13,10.1038/s41597-019-0317-x,abstract_only,False
PMID:28166733,A machine learning classifier trained on cancer transcriptomes detects NF1 inactivation signal in glioblastoma.,"BACKGROUND: We have identified molecules that exhibit synthetic lethality in cells with loss of the neurofibromin 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor gene. However, recognizing tumors that have inactivation of the NF1 tumor suppressor function is challenging because the loss may occur via mechanisms that do not involve mutation of the genomic locus. Degradation of the NF1 protein, independent of NF1 mutation status, phenocopies inactivating mutations to drive tumors in human glioma cell lines. NF1 inactivation may alter the transcriptional landscape of a tumor and allow a machine learning classifier to detect which tumors will benefit from synthetic lethal molecules. RESULTS: We developed a strategy to predict tumors with low NF1 activity and hence tumors that may respond to treatments that target cells lacking NF1. Using RNAseq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we trained an ensemble of 500 logistic regression classifiers that integrates mutation status with whole transcriptomes to predict NF1 inactivation in glioblastoma (GBM). On TCGA data, the classifier detected NF1 mutated tumors (test set area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) mean = 0.77, 95% quantile = 0.53 - 0.95) over 50 random initializations. On RNA-Seq data transformed into the space of gene expression microarrays, this method produced a classifier with similar performance (test set AUROC mean = 0.77, 95% quantile = 0.53 - 0.96). We applied our ensemble classifier trained on the transformed TCGA data to a microarray validation set of 12 samples with matched RNA and NF1 protein-level measurements. The classifier's NF1 score was associated with NF1 protein concentration in these samples. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that TCGA can be used to train accurate predictors of NF1 inactivation in GBM. The ensemble classifier performed well for samples with very high or very low NF1 protein concentrations but had mixed performance in samples with intermediate NF1 concentrations. Nevertheless, high-performing and validated predictors have the potential to be paired with targeted therapies and personalized medicine.","Methods The Cancer Genome Atlas Data used for building the classifier We downloaded RNAseq and mutation data from TCGA Pan Cancer project from the UCSC Xena data portal [ 15 ] and subset each dataset to only the GBMs [ 16 ]. The data consists of 607 GBMs; of which 291 have mutation calls, 172 have RNAseq measurements, and 149 have both RNAseq and mutation calls. Of these 149 samples, 15 have inactivating  NF1  mutations (10.1%) and were used as gold standard positives in building the classifier (Additional file  1 : Table S1). Additionally, to reduce dimensionality while avoiding unexpressed and invariant genes, we subset to the top 8,000 most variably expressed genes by median absolute deviation. We z-scored all gene expression measurements. This resulted in the final input matrix with dimension 149 samples by 8,000 genes. For use in platform independent predictions, we used Training Distribution Matching (TDM) to transform the TCGA RNAseq data to match a microarray expression distribution [ 17 ]. Since we are also aware of the  NF1  mutation status for each of the samples, we form a supervised learning task – predicting when a sample has loss of  NF1  activity. Our “X” matrix is formed by the RNAseq measurements for all 149 samples measured by 8,000 genes, which are the features in the model. Our “y” vector consist of {0, 1} elements where a 1 corresponds to a sample with an inactivating  NF1  mutation and a 0 is an  NF1  wildtype sample. The machine learning task is to find the feature weights, or gene coefficients, that best minimize our objective function. Along with these feature weights corresponding to the genes’ importance in the learning task, we also output a probability estimate for each sample that they have loss of  NF1  activity. Hyperparameter optimization of the logistic regression classifier Using the GBM RNAseq data, we trained logistic regression classifiers with an elastic net penalty using stochastic gradient descent to detect tumors with NF1 inactivation. We chose a penalized regression model because it is simple to train and has easily interpretable outputs including importance scores for each gene (feature weights) associated with the downstream consequences of  NF1  loss of function and a probability for each sample that  NF1  is lost. An elastic net logistic regression model has also been successfully implemented in similar studies [ 18 – 20 ]. We identified high-performing alpha and L1 mixing parameters using 5-fold cross validation ensuring balanced membership of  NF1  mutations in each fold. Briefly, alpha controls how weight penalty and the L1 mixing parameter tunes the amount of test set regularization by controlling the sparsity of the features. An L1 mixing parameter value of zero corresponds to the L2 penalty and a value of one corresponds to the L1 penalty, with L1 bringing a sparser solution. We used python 3.5.1 and Sci-kit Learn for machine learning implementations [ 21 ]. Ensemble classifier construction and application to the validation set After selecting optimal hyperparameters, we constructed 500 classifiers that would compose our ensemble model. Specifically, across 100 different random initializations, we subset the full TCGA GBM data into five folds and trained a single classifier for each training fold. We borrowed terminology from the epidemiology field to describe data partitioning. We trained our models on a “training” partition and assessed model performance on a “test” partition, which refers to the held out cross-validation fold. The independent “validation set” refers to the GBM dataset generated in a different lab (see Fig.  1a ).

We applied 5-fold cross validation to the full dataset which consists of training and testing splits in each fold. The model is then applied as an ensemble classifier on a set of in-house samples (validation set) ( b ) Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for all 500 classifiers that make up the ensemble model applied to both training and testing set. Also shown is the aggregate performance of the ensemble classifier.  c  The cumulative density of area under the ROC curve (AUROC) for training and testing partitions Because of the small number of gold standard positive training examples, we were concerned about the stability of our model solutions. Therefore, we constructed an ensemble classifier from the 500 models. Specifically, we assigned each classifier a weight using the specific randomization’s “test set” cross-validation AUROC. Lastly, for the final  NF1  inactivation prediction, we used the mean of the weighted predictions across all iterations as the  NF1  inactivation prediction. We applied this ensemble classifier to the validation set in which NF1 protein levels were directly measured. Effect sizes and power analysis We calculated the decision function of each ensemble classifier applied to all samples in the training and testing 5-fold cross validation folds to calculate Cohen’s D effect size between predicted  NF1  wildtype and  NF1  inactive samples [ 22 ]. The Cohen’s D metric quantifies the difference between  NF1  wildtype and  NF1  inactive samples according to the mean classifier score and directly demonstrates how different the ensemble model predicts the two groups to be. Moreover, we were also concerned that our relatively small validation set would not provide us with enough power to observe a detectable effect in the ensemble model’s final prediction. We performed a one-tailed Welch’s two-sample  t -test comparing the NF1 protein concentration of our validation samples that were predicted to be either  NF1  wildtype or  NF1  deficient. Using the given sample size, Cohen’s D effect size, and a significance threshold of α = 0.05, we calculated the power of the prediction scores on the validation set. The power analysis was two-sample, one-tailed and incorporated unequal sample sizes in each group. Validation sample acquisition Thirteen flash-frozen, de-identified GBM samples were obtained from the Maine Medical Center Biobank. Samples were received on dry ice and stored at −80 °C until isolation of DNA/RNA/protein. To isolate DNA, tumor fragments of approximately 20 mg in mass were harvested on an aluminum block pre-chilled on dry ice. Samples were then immediately transferred to a mortar and pestle containing a small volume of liquid nitrogen. The fragments were pulverized in the mortar and pestle, and the liquid nitrogen was allowed to evaporate. Next, samples were immediately processed with a DNA/RNA/Protein Purification Plus kit (Norgen Biotek) following the standard operating protocol for animal tissue. DNA concentration and quality were assessed using an ND-1000 (Nanodrop), a Qubit Fluorometer (Thermo Scientific), and a Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical Technologies). To isolate RNA, −80 C tumor fragments were placed in 5–10 volumes of RNAlater-ICE Frozen Tissue Transition Solution (Ambion) and placed at −20 °C until RNA extraction with a mirVana miRNA isolation kit, without phenol, following the standard operating protocol (Thermo Scientific). Samples were homogenized using a manual homogenizer in the presence of mirVana lysis buffer. RNA concentration and quality were determined using a Qubit Fluorometer (Thermo Scientific) and a Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical Technologies). To isolate protein, small tumor fragments were pulverized and lysed in approximately three volumes of ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (150 mM sodium chloride, 1% v/v nonidet P40, 0.5% w/v sodium deoxycholate, 0.05% w/v sodium dodecyl sulfate, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0) containing 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1X protease inhibitor cocktail (0.1 μg/mL leupeptin, 100 μM benzamidine HCl, 1 μM aprotinin, 0.1 μg/mL soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.1 μg/mL pepstatin, 0.1 μg/mL antipain). Samples were passed through a 25 5/8 g needle and subsequently sonicated on ice to promote efficient lysis and DNA shearing. After a 30 min incubation on ice, lysates were cleared by centrifuging at 16100 × g for 20 min. HEK293T, U87-MG, and U87-MG cells treated for two hours with one micromolar bortezomib (Selleckchem) and ten micromolar MG132 (Selleckchem) were also prepared in RIPA buffer. Protein samples were stored at −80 °C until analysis. Cell culture U87-MG and HEK293T cells were purchased from ATCC. Cell lines were regularly passaged and were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (Corning) with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum (Gibco) at 37 °C in 5% CO 2 . Recent data regarding the U87MG cell line published by Allen et al. suggest that the U87MG cell line distributed by ATCC is not from the same tumor as the cell line that was originally isolated in Uppsala. Transcriptome analysis comparing ATCC U87MG cell line to known tumor transcriptomes indicate that the ATCC U87MG cell line is a central nervous system tumor and is likely a glioblastoma cell line [ 23 ]. In the present study, we employ this cell line as a control representing an NF1-deficient tumor cell line. Previous studies have shown that the U87MG cell line has elevated proteasome-mediated degradation of NF1 and that this cell line required the loss of NF1 protein to promote tumorigenesis in xenograft tumor models [ 10 ]. Given that the ATCC U87MG cell line is a well-characterized and broadly-used model of NF1 deficient tumor cells [ 10 ,  24 – 26 ], we propose that the use of the ATCC U87MG cell line is an appropriate control for Fig.  2 .

Labeling was performed with Affymetrix Proprietary DNA Label (biotin-linked) using a WT Plus Kit (Affymetrix) provided with the HTA 2.0, following the standard operating protocol for HTA 2.0, including PolyA controls. Hybridization, washing, and staining were performed with the WT Plus Kit, following the standard operating protocol for HTA 2.0. Washing and staining were performed using a GeneChip Fluidics 450. Scanning was performed with a GeneChip Scanner 3000. These data were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus under accession  GSE85033 . Validation sample processing We applied a quality control pipeline [ 27 ] to all CEL files generated by the HTA 2.0. All validation samples passed processing quality control, which included an inspection of spatial artifacts, MA plots, probe distributions, and sample comparison boxplots. We summarized transcript intensities using robust multi-array analysis (RMA) [ 28 ]. We determined batch normalization was unnecessary after a guided principal components analysis (gPCA) using sample processing date and array plate ID as potential batch effect confounders [ 29 ]. Lastly, we collapsed HTA2.0 transcripts into gene level measurements using the ‘collapseRows()’ function with the “maxmean” method from the R package WGCNA [ 30 ]. We used the pd.hta.2.0 platform design file (version 3.12.1) and the Bioconductor package “hta20sttranscriptcluster.db” (version 8.3.1) to map manufacturer transcript IDs to genes. We performed all preprocessing steps using R version 3.2.3. Western blotting Prior to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, protein sample concentration was determined using a Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific). Protein samples were prepared with 1X Laemmli sample buffer (50 mM Tris pH 6.8, 0.02% w/v bromophenol blue, 2% w/v SDS, 10% v/v glycerol, 1% v/v beta-mercaptoethanol, 12.5 mM EDTA) and 50 μg of tumor protein. Volumes were normalized with RIPA buffer including the protease/phosphatase inhibitors described above. SDS-PAGE was performed using a 4-15% Mini-PROTEAN TGX gel (Bio-Rad) for 1 h at 120 V. The samples were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for 2 h and 45 min at 400 mA in cold transfer buffer (384 mM glycine, 50 mM Tris, 20% methanol, 0.005% w/v sodium dodecyl sulfate. Following this, the blots were then blocked in 5% w/v BSA or 5% w/v nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 19 mM Tris, 0.05% v/v Tween 20, pH 7.4) for 25 min. Immunoblotting was performed with the following antibodies and conditions (vendor, species, diluent, dilution, incubation time, incubation temperature): anti-NF1 D7R7D #14624 (Cell Signaling, rabbit, 2% BSA, 1:1000, overnight, 4 °C), anti-tubulin B-1-2-5 (Santa Cruz, mouse, 2% milk, 1:10000, 1 h, RT), anti-EGFR D38B1 #4267 (Cell Signaling, rabbit, 2% milk, 1:1000–1:2000, 1 h, RT), p-ERK ½ (p44/42 MAPK) #9101 (Cell Signaling, rabbit, 2% BSA, 1:2000, overnight, 4 °C), SUZ12 D39F6 #3737 (Cell Signaling, rabbit, 2% milk, 1:1000, overnight, 4 °C). Anti-NF1 D7R7D was a kind gift from Cell Signaling Technologies, Inc. The binding of the primary antibodies was detected by incubation with secondary antibodies goat anti-rabbit HRP 1:20000 or goat anti-mouse HRP 1:10000 (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories Inc.) at room temperature in 2% milk in TBST and detection of HRP activity using Pierce ECL Western Blotting substrate (Thermo Scientific), or in the case of  NF1 , SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Thermo Scientific). The chemiluminescent signal was captured with MED-B medical x-ray film (Med X Ray Company Inc.). Between primary antibodies, the membrane was stripped twice for 10 min at room temperature using a mild stripping buffer containing 1.5% w/v glycine, 0.1% w/v SDS, 1% v/v Tween 20 at pH 2.2 (Abcam). One sample was eliminated due to low yield, and apparent degradation as determined by western blotting (all proteins examined were undetectable with the exception of tubulin, not shown). Densitometry was performed using Li-COR Image Studio Lite 5.0. Briefly, intensity measurements for  NF1  and tubulin were taken using equally-sized regions for all bands. The background was subtracted using the local median intensity from the left and right borders (size = 2) of each measurement region.  NF1  values were divided by tubulin intensity to adjust for protein loading. All measurement ratios were then normalized by dividing values by the “U87 + PI” measurement for each blot, respectively.

PMID:24249804,Recommendations for imaging tumor response in neurofibromatosis clinical trials.,"OBJECTIVE: Neurofibromatosis (NF)-related benign tumors such as plexiform neurofibromas (PN) and vestibular schwannomas (VS) can cause substantial morbidity. Clinical trials directed at these tumors have become available. Due to differences in disease manifestations and the natural history of NF-related tumors, response criteria used for solid cancers (1-dimensional/RECIST [Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors] and bidimensional/World Health Organization) have limited applicability. No standardized response criteria for benign NF tumors exist. The goal of the Tumor Measurement Working Group of the REiNS (Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis) committee is to propose consensus guidelines for the evaluation of imaging response in clinical trials for NF tumors. METHODS: Currently used imaging endpoints, designs of NF clinical trials, and knowledge of the natural history of NF-related tumors, in particular PN and VS, were reviewed. Consensus recommendations for response evaluation for future studies were developed based on this review and the expertise of group members. RESULTS: MRI with volumetric analysis is recommended to sensitively and reproducibly evaluate changes in tumor size in clinical trials. Volumetric analysis requires adherence to specific imaging recommendations. A 20% volume change was chosen to indicate a decrease or increase in tumor size. Use of these criteria in future trials will enable meaningful comparison of results across studies. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed imaging response evaluation guidelines, along with validated clinical outcome measures, will maximize the ability to identify potentially active agents for patients with NF and benign tumors.",,Eva Dombi; Simone L Ardern-Holmes; Dusica Babovic-Vuksanovic; Fred G Barker; Steve Connor; D Gareth Evans; Michael J Fisher; Stephane Goutagny; Gordon J Harris; Diego Jaramillo; Matthias A Karajannis; Bruce R Korf; Victor Mautner; Scott R Plotkin; Tina Y Poussaint; Kent Robertson; Chie-Schin Shih; Brigitte C Widemann,Neurology,2013-11-19,10.1212/01.wnl.0000435744.57038.af,abstract_only,False
PMID:25026211,Merlin/NF2 loss-driven tumorigenesis linked to CRL4(DCAF1)-mediated inhibition of the hippo pathway kinases Lats1 and 2 in the nucleus.,"It is currently unclear whether Merlin/NF2 suppresses tumorigenesis by activating upstream components of the Hippo pathway at the plasma membrane or by inhibiting the E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4(DCAF1) in the nucleus. We found that derepressed CRL4(DCAF1) promotes YAP- and TEAD-dependent transcription by ubiquitylating and, thereby, inhibiting Lats1 and 2 in the nucleus. Genetic epistasis experiments and analysis of tumor-derived missense mutations indicate that this signaling connection sustains the oncogenicity of Merlin-deficient tumor cells. Analysis of clinical samples confirms that this pathway operates in NF2-mutant tumors. We conclude that derepressed CRL4(DCAF1) promotes activation of YAP by inhibiting Lats1 and 2 in the nucleus.","Experimental Procedures Patients and tumor samples Human studies were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of MSKCC, NYU-Langone Medical Center and the Plymouth University Peninsula School of Medicine and Dentistry.

PMID:21072183,p21-Activated kinases are required for transformation in a cell-based model of neurofibromatosis type 2.,"BACKGROUND: NF2 is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by development of bilateral vestibular schwannomas and other benign tumors in central nervous system. Loss of the NF2 gene product, Merlin, leads to aberrant Schwann cell proliferation, motility, and survival, but the mechanisms by which this tumor suppressor functions remain unclear. One well-defined target of Merlin is the group I family of p21-activated kinases, which are allosterically inhibited by Merlin and which, when activated, stimulate cell cycle progression, motility, and increased survival. Here, we examine the effect of Pak inhibition on cells with diminished Merlin function. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using a specific peptide inhibitor of group I Paks, we show that loss of Pak activity restores normal cell movement in cells lacking Merlin function. In addition, xenografts of such cells form fewer and smaller tumors than do cells without Pak inhibition. However, in tumors, loss of Pak activity does not reduce Erk or Akt activity, two signaling proteins that are thought to mediate Pak function in growth factor pathways. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that Pak functions in novel signaling pathways in NF2, and may serve as a useful therapeutic target in this disease.","Methodology/Principal Findings Using a specific peptide inhibitor of group I Paks, we show that loss of Pak activity restores normal cell movement in cells lacking Merlin function.

Materials and Methods Cell culture conditions and retroviral transductions NIH-3T3 (obtained from American Type Culture Collection) cells were cultured in high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO 2  incubator. The φNX packaging cell line (Orbigen) was transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Viral supernatants were harvested 48 hr post-transfection and filtered. Cells were incubated with retroviral supernatant supplemented with 4 µg/ml polybrene for 4 hr at 37°C, and then were cultured in growth media for 48 hr for viral integration. Infected cells were selected with 2 µg/ml of puromycin or by flow cytometry for cells with green fluorescent protein (GFP). Expression Plasmids A GST-PID (Pak1 amino acids 83–149) or Gst-PID L107F cDNA  [27]  was subcloned as a  Bgl II/ Xho I fragment into the retroviral expression vector pBMN-I-GFP ( http://stanford.edu/group/nolan/plasmid_maps/pmaps.html ), restricted with  Bam HI/ Xho I. Cell proliferation assay 10 4  cells were plated in 96-well plates and 10 µl 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) solution was added to each well to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. The reaction was stopped after 4 hr at 37°C by adding 100 µl of solubilization solution (10% SDS in 0.01 M HCl) and the samples were analyzed at 595 nm on Perkin Elmer Envision plate reader. Triplicates were performed for each sample and medium alone was used as a blank, and experiments were performed on three occasions. Cell invasion assay Matrigel invasion chamber (BD Biosciences) were rehydrated in serum-free DMEM medium for 2 hr and then placed in 0.75 ml of DMEM medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. Cells at a density of 1.5×10 4  suspended in 0.5 ml of DMEM, and seeded onto Matrigel chambers. Cells were allowed to invade for 12 or 24 hr and cells on the upper surface were gently removed with a cotton bud, and cells that had migrated through the 8 µm pores were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 15 min. Membranes were washed, removed and mounted on a glass slide, and the level of invasion was quantified by visual counting using a microscope with a 20X objective. Cell cycle analysis Cell cycle profiles were analyzed using flow cytometry with propidium iodide staining. Cells were trypsinized and washed with PBS and fixed in 70% ethanol at −20°C. After fixation, cells were washed once with PBS and resuspended in 0.5 ml of a solution containing 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mM NaCl, 50 µg/ml propidium iodide and 70 Kunitz units/ml RNase A. FACS analysis was performed using CELLQuest™ software (Becton Dickinson). A minimum of 10,000 events was collected per sample.

PMID:33032988,Combined Inhibition of SHP2 and MEK Is Effective in Models of NF1-Deficient Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors.,"Loss of the RAS GTPase-activating protein (RAS-GAP) NF1 drives aberrant activation of RAS/MEK/ERK signaling and other effector pathways in the majority of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). These dysregulated pathways represent potential targets for therapeutic intervention. However, studies of novel single agents including MEK inhibitors (MEKi) have demonstrated limited efficacy both preclinically and clinically, with little advancement in overall patient survival. By interrogation of kinome activity through an unbiased screen and targeted evaluation of the signaling response to MEK inhibition, we have identified global activation of upstream receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) that converges on activation of RAS as a mechanism to limit sensitivity to MEK inhibition. As no direct inhibitors of pan-RAS were available, an inhibitor of the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, a critical mediator of RAS signal transduction downstream of multiple RTK, represented an alternate strategy. The combination of MEKi plus SHP099 was superior to MEKi alone in models of NF1-MPNST, including those with acquired resistance to MEKi. Our findings have immediate translational implications and may inform future clinical trials for patients with MPNST harboring alterations in ","Materials and Methods Cell lines, antibodies and reagents H1838 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). WM3918 and M308 were obtained from Dr. David Solit at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC, New York, NY). STS26T, ST8814 and NF90.8 were kindly provided by Dr. Gregory Riggins at Johns Hopkins University (JHU, Baltimore, MD). NF94.3, NF96.2, NF10.1 and NF11.1 were kindly provided by Dr. Margaret Wallace at University of Florida (UF, Gainesville, FL). Four patient-derived MPNST cell lines (JH-2–002, JH-2–009, JH-2–031 and JH-2–055); and three patient-derived neurofibroma cell lines (JH-2–060, JH-2–074 and JH-2–077) were generated in our laboratory from biospecimens collected during surgical resection from NF1 patients ( 24 ). Material was collected under an institutional review board (IRB)-approved protocol (JHU IRB #J1649), and all patients provided written informed consent. All cell lines used in our study were verified by short tandem repeat (STR) profiling for cell line authentication at Johns Hopkins University Core Facility, tested negative for mycoplasma contamination, and passaged  in vitro  for fewer than three months after resuscitation. The base medium for H1838, WM3918, M308, STS26T, ST8814 and NF90.8 is RPMI; for NF94.3, NF96.2, NF10.1, NF11.1, JH-2–002, JH-2–009, JH-2–031, JH-2–055, JH-2–060, JH-2–074 and JH-2–077 is DMEM/F12. All growth medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Trametinib-resistant cell lines were maintained in complete growth medium plus 20 nM of trametinib. Antibodies against DUSP6 (# ab76310) were from Abcam. Antibodies against cyclin D1 (sc-718 and sc-8396) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies against other proteins and phospho-proteins were obtained from Cell Signaling. Trametinib and RMC-4550 for  in vitro  study were purchased from SelleckChem. SHP099 for  in vitro  study was purchased from MedChemExpress. Trametinib and SHP099 for  in vivo  study were purchased from Chemietek. Drugs for  in vitro  studies were dissolved in DMSO to yield 10 mM or 1 mM stock solutions, and stored at −20 °C. Generation of drug-resistant cell lines Cell lines resistant to trametinib were generated by exposing the parental NF1-MPNST cell lines ST8814 and NF90.8 to 20 nM of trametinib for five months of continuous drug exposure (with change of medium twice per week). The parental and resistant cells were then sent for targeted gene sequencing on a clinical oncology panel covering 637 genes important in oncogenesis, together with copy-number variation analysis, in the Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins, as previously described ( 25 ,  26 ). Kinome activity profiling using PamChip® peptide microarrays PamChip peptide arrays (PamGene International BV, ‘s-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands) measure the ability of active kinases in a protein lysate sample to phosphorylate specific peptides imprinted on multiplex peptide arrays ( 27 ). Five NF1-MPNST cell lines (ST8814, NF94.3, NF96.2, NF10.1 and JH-2–002) were treated for 24 hrs with DMSO or trametinib (20 nM). Cells were lysed with M-PER Mammalian Extraction Buffer (Thermo Fischer Scientific, # 78501) supplemented with Halt Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Fischer Scientific, # 78420) and Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail EDTA free (Thermo Fischer Scientific, # 87785), and protein quantification was determined using Pierce Coomassie Plus (Bradford) Assay Kit (Thermo Fischer Scientific, #23236) according to PamGene instructions (protocol #1160). Measurements of kinome activity were performed on a PamStation®-12 by PamGene ( 28 ). Briefly, the PamChip protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) array was processed in a single-step reaction in which 5.0 μg of protein lysate was dispensed onto PTK array dissolved in protein kinase buffer (proprietary information) and additives including 1% BSA, 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), FITC-conjugated pY20 antibody and 400 μM ATP. The STK array was processed in a two-step reaction in which 1 μg of protein lysate was used with protein kinase buffer (proprietary information) supplied with 1% BSA, primary STK antibody mix and 400 μM ATP (sample mix). After an initial incubation of 110 mins, the reaction mix was removed, and the secondary FITC-labeled antibody mix was added. In both arrays, software-based image analysis (BioNavigator software V.6.3 from PamGene) integrates the signals obtained within the time course of the incubation of the kinase lysate on the chip into one single value for each peptide for each sample (exposure time scaling). Peptide phosphorylation kinetics (for PTK) and its variations (for PTK/STK) were used to remove low signal peptides as quality control analysis (QC). QC passed 113 nonredundant peptides from PTK and 118 peptides from STK were used for further analysis. Individual peptide phosphorylation intensities were normalized to DMSO control, followed by log2 transformed (LFC) for easier visualization ( Sup. Table 1 ). The peptides with significant differences in phosphorylation intensity (trametinib versus DMSO control, using paired t-test, p<0.05) are visualized as either volcano and bar plots or as heatmap using the R pheatmap package. Upstream kinase analysis (UKA) of PTK and STK data was done using default setting of the PamApp (PTK or STK UKA 2018 V.4.0) on BioNavigator Analysis software tool as described before ( 29 ). The analysis is based on documented kinase-substrate relationships (from iviv database and literature-based protein modifications such as HPRD, PhosphoELM, PhosphositePLUS, Reactome, UNIPROT) complemented with “in silico” predictions that are retrieved from the phosphoNET database. The analysis generated three major parameters calculated by the PamApp ( Sup. Table 1 ): 1) Mean kinase statistic (s) depicts the overall change of the peptide set that represent a kinase. For instance. a larger positive value indicates a larger activity in trametinib-treated cells compared to DMSO controls. 2) Mean significance score (Qsg) indicating the significance of the change represented by the mean kinase statistic (s) between two groups (using 500 permutations across sample labels). 3) Mean specificity score (Qsp) indicates the specificity of the Mean kinase statistics with respect to the number of peptides used for predicting the corresponding kinase (using 500 permutations across target peptides). The final ranking of the kinases was based on ‘mean kinase score’, which was calculated by addition of significance score (Qsg) and specificity score (Qsp). Top predicted kinases from significant PTK and STK peptide sets are represented on phylogenetic tree of the human protein kinase family generated by Coral ( http://phanstiel-lab.med.unc.edu/CORAL/ ) ( 30 ). Immunoblotting Cells were disrupted on ice in NP40 lysis buffer as previously described ( 7 ). Protein concentration was determined with Pierce BCA protein assay kit (# 23227, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, immunoblotted with specific primary and secondary antibodies, and detected by chemiluminescence with the ECL detection reagents, Immobilon western chemiluminescent HRP substrate (# WBKLS0500, Millipore) or Pierce ECL western blotting substrate (# 32106, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The membranes were imaged using ChemiDoc touch imaging system (Bio-Rad) and relative changes in p-MEK, p-ERK and DUSP6 levels were quantitated by densitometry analysis using Image J. Cell proliferation assay Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 2,000 cells per well. A dose range of the compound indicated was prepared by serial dilutions and then added to the dishes containing adherent cells. Cells were incubated with drug for the indicated time. Cell growth was quantitated using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo). For each condition, three replicates of each concentration were measured. Relative survival in the presence of drugs was normalized to the untreated controls after background subtraction. Graphs were generated using Prism 8 based on the average of three replicates. Active RAS pull down assay Cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes. The following day, the 70–80% confluent cells were collected, and GTP-bound RAS was quantified using active RAS detection kit (# 8821) from Cell Signaling according to manufacturer instructions. RNA interference (RNAi) RNAi was performed using ON-TARGETplus Non-targeting Pool (#D-001810–10-05, Dharmacon) and SMARTPool ON-TARGETplus Human PTPN11 siRNA (#L-003947–00-0005, Dharmacon) to knockdown (KD) the expression of non-targeting control (NTC) and SHP2, respectively using DharmaFECT 1 Transfection Reagent (#T-2001–02, Dharmacon) per manufacturer protocols. The knock-down of SHP2 was confirmed at protein expression level using immunoblot. Colony formation assay NF1-MPNST cells were treated with DMSO, trametinib (5 nM) and /or SHP099 (1 μM and 3 μM) for three weeks. Cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin and then stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 30 min. Soft agar assay Soft agar assay was performed as previously described ( 31 ). Briefly, 50,000 cells growing in log phase were mixed with agar (0.33%), treated with DMSO, trametinib, SHP099 or their combination, and plated over a bottom layer of 0.5% agar in 6-well plates. Cells were incubated at 37°C for three weeks. Colonies were then stained with crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 hr and five random fields per chamber were acquired using Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope (Nikon). Measurements were based on technical duplicates for each condition. In vivo  mouse studies Athymic nude (# 002019) and NOD  scid  gamma (NSG, # 005557) female mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. All mouse experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Johns Hopkins under protocol # MO19M115. Minced tumor fragments from donor mice were implanted subcutaneously close to the sciatic nerves of 6 to 8-week-old athymic nude (NF90.8) or NSG (PDX JH-2–002) female mice. Drug treatment was started when tumor size reached roughly 600mm 3  (NF90.8) or 400mm 3  (PDX JH-2–002). Mice were randomized into treatment groups by an algorithm that moves animals around to achieve the best-case distribution to assure that each treatment group has similar mean tumor burden and standard deviation. Vehicle, trametinib (0.3 mg/kg, Chemietek; dissolved in 5% DMSO and 0.5% hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose and 0.2% Tween 80), SHP099 (50mg/kg, Chemietek; dissolved in 5% DMSO and 0.5% methyl cellulose and 0.1% Tween 80), or the combination were administrated by oral gavage once daily, based on mean group body weight, with treatment schedule 5 days on/2 days off. The endpoint of the experiment for efficacy studies was considered 4 weeks on treatment or the longest tumor diameter of 2-cm as per our approved protocol, whichever occurred first. Tumors were measured twice weekly by calipering in two dimensions, and tumor volume was calculated by: L × W 2 (π/6), where L is the longest diameter and W is the width. Fold-change tumor growth was calculated relative to day 0 with the formula: fold change in tumor growth = (tumor volume on day X / tumor volume on day 0) –1. Ki-67 immunohistochemistry (IHC) Ki-67 IHC was performed at Johns Hopkins IHC core facility. Briefly, immunolabeling for Ki-67 was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections on a Ventana Discovery Ultra auto-stainer (Roche Diagnostics). Following dewaxing and rehydration on board, epitope retrieval was performed using Ventana Ultra CC1 buffer (# 6414575001, Roche Diagnostics) at 96 °C for 48 minutes. Primary antibody, anti-Ki-67 (1:200 dilution; # Ab16667, lot number GR3185488–1, Abcam) was applied at 36 °C for 60 minutes. Primary antibodies were detected using an anti-rabbit HQ detection system (# 7017936001 and 7017812001, Roche Diagnostics) followed by Chromomap DAB IHC detection kit (# 5266645001, Roche Diagnostics), counterstaining with Mayer’s hematoxylin, dehydration and mounting.

PMID:39225289,Comparing 3D imaging devices for the measurement of cutaneous neurofibromas in patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 1.,"BACKGROUND: Cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs) are a major cause of disfigurement in patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1). However, clinical trials investigating cNF treatments lack standardised outcome measures to objectively evaluate changes in cNF size and appearance. 3D imaging has been proposed as an objective standardised outcome measure however various systems exist with different features that affect useability in clinical settings. The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy, precision, feasibility, reliability and accessibility of three imaging systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared the Vectra-H1, LifeViz-Micro and Cherry-Imaging systems. A total of 58 cNFs from 13 participants with NF1 were selected for imaging and analysis. The primary endpoint was accuracy as measured by comparison of measurements between imaging systems. Secondary endpoints included reliability between two operators, precision as measured with the average coefficient of variation, feasibility as determined by time to capture and analyse an image and accessibility as determined by cost. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in accuracy between the three devices for length or surface area measurements (p > 0.05), and reliability and precision were similar. Volume measurements demonstrated the most variability compared to other measurements; LifeViz-Micro demonstrated the least measurement variability for surface area and image capture and analysis were fastest with LifeViz-Micro. LifeViz-Micro was better for imaging smaller number of cNFs (1-3), Vectra-H1 better for larger areas and Cherry for uneven surfaces. CONCLUSIONS: All systems demonstrated excellent reliability but possess distinct advantages and limitations. Surface area is the most consistent and reliable parameter for measuring cNF size in clinical trials.","Materials and methods We compared the Vectra‐H1, LifeViz‐Micro and Cherry‐Imaging systems. A total of 58 cNFs from 13 participants with NF1 were selected for imaging and analysis. The primary endpoint was accuracy as measured by comparison of measurements between imaging systems. Secondary endpoints included reliability between two operators, precision as measured with the average coefficient of variation, feasibility as determined by time to capture and analyse an image and accessibility as determined by cost. 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Study design Thirteen participants were recruited for imaging from the NF1 skin clinic at Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney, Australia, from January to April 2022. Inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of NF1, age over 18 years and the presence of at least one visible cNF. Participants were excluded if they had a history of epilepsy and severe migraines, as this is a contraindication for Cherry Imaging. We used convenience sampling to maximize recruitment within the study period. Images of up to eight cNFs from each participant were captured and analysed using each 3D imaging system: Vectra H1 (Canfield Scientific Inc, Fairfield, NJ, USA), LifeViz Micro (QuantifiCare, Biot, France) and Cherry Imaging (Yokneam, Israel). The Vectra H1 and LifeViz Micro were chosen due to their previous use in past NF1 studies measuring cNFs. 
 ,  14 
 
  Cherry Imaging was chosen as a novel scanner device of interest to the authors for potential use in NF1 studies and other dermatological research. 17 
 
  There was no participant dropout as all participants were consented and imaged at the same appointment. 20 
 The primary endpoint was accuracy as measured by comparing measurements between imaging systems. Secondary endpoints included the reliability, precision, feasibility and accessibility of the imaging systems. The times required to capture an image, generate a 3D model and analyse a cNF were recorded to assess feasibility. The financial cost of the hardware and software for each imaging system was used as a metric of accessibility. 2.2 Image acquisition cNFs were selected from the head, torso or limbs depending on suitability for imaging. Prior to imaging, a 2D photograph of the cNF region was taken for baseline comparison and location tracking (Figure  1 ). Images were then taken with each 3D device following manufacturer instructions. FIGURE 1 Cutaneous neurofibroma 2D image. Image was taken using a standard digital camera. Scale bar represents 10 mm. To assess intra‐ and inter‐rater reliability, images of each cNF were taken three times with each device; twice by one investigator (J.L.) and once by a second investigator (M.G.). Repeat images were taken at least 3 min apart on the same day. 2.3 Image analysis Images from each device were analysed by a single investigator (J.L.) on a dedicated laptop using the recommended software provided by each imaging system manufacturer. Example images are shown in Figure  2 . Measurements for cNF length (maximum diameter), width (perpendicular maximum diameter), height, surface area and volume were performed on 3D models generated by all three imaging systems and recorded in millimetres. Vectra software was unable to provide tumour height measurements. Measurements performed using Cherry Imaging software were accessed via the debug console to obtain measurements in millimetres (default was centimetres). FIGURE 2 Cutaneous neurofibroma analysis on different 3D imaging systems. (A, B) 3D model analysis using Cherry Imaging Trace software. (C, D) 3D model analysis using LifeViz App software. (E, F) 3D model analysis using Vectra software. Scale bars represent 10 mm. 2.4 Statistical assessment Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics (version 27.01). Friedman tests and Dunn–Bonferroni post hoc tests were performed to assess accuracy by comparing measurements of cNF length, width, surface area and volume between each imaging system. Height measurements between LifeViz Micro and Cherry Imaging were compared using a Wilcoxon signed‐rank test. The intra‐ and inter‐rater reliability for image acquisition was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). To remain consistent with outcome measures by Thalheimer et al., ICCs ranging from 0 to 1 were considered: 0.9–1.0 ‘Excellent’, 0.75–0.89 ‘Good’, 0.5–0.74 ‘Moderate’ and < 0.5 ‘Poor’ reliability. 
 
 17 
 To assess precision, the average coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated for measurements from triplicate images of small (≤5 mm diameter) and large (> 5 mm diameter) cNFs. Tumours were categorised into small and large based on their median diameter as measured across all imaging systems, rounded to the nearest millimetre integer. The minimal detectable difference (MDD) for each imaging system was defined as at least twice the CV.

PMID:41411243,PERADIGM: Phenotype embedding similarity-based rare disease gene mapping.,"Identifying genes associated with rare diseases remains challenging due to the scarcity of patients and the limited statistical power of traditional association methods. Here, we introduce PERADIGM ( Phenotype Embedding similarity-based RAre DIsease Gene Mapping), a novel framework that leverages natural language processing techniques to integrate comprehensive phenotype information from electronic health records for rare disease gene discovery. PERADIGM employs an embedding model to capture relationships between ICD-10 codes, providing a nuanced representation of individual phenotypes. By utilizing patient similarity scores, it enhances the identification of candidate genes associated with disease-specific phenotypes, surpassing conventional methods that rely on binary disease status. We applied PERADIGM to the UK Biobank dataset for three rare diseases: autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), Marfan syndrome, and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). PERADIGM identified additional candidate genes associated with ADPKD-related and Marfan syndrome-related phenotypes, some of which are supported by existing literature, and demonstrated enhanced signal detection for NF1-specific phenotypes beyond traditional methods. Our findings demonstrate the potential of PERADIGM to identify genes associated with rare diseases and related phenotypes by incorporating phenotype embeddings and patient similarity, providing a powerful tool for precision medicine and a deeper understanding of rare disease genetics and clinical manifestations.","Materials and methods UK Biobank 200K dataset and genotype data quality control We utilized the UK Biobank 200K dataset [ 4 , 50 ] in our analysis. To mitigate potential confounding effects due to population stratification, we restricted our analysis to individuals of European ancestry. We applied several filtering criteria to ensure data quality and completeness. Specifically, we excluded individuals who lacked Hospital inpatient data or whole-exome sequencing data. To eliminate potential biases due to sample relatedness, we also removed related individuals from the UK Biobank dataset. Specifically, we used the kinship coefficients provided by UK Biobank to identify all pairs of related participants and excluded individuals with first- or second-degree relationships. Within each related family, one individual was randomly retained to ensure that the final analysis cohort consisted entirely of unrelated samples. After applying these filters, our final study cohort comprised 121,330 individuals of European ancestry. This refined dataset ensures a more homogeneous population with comprehensive phenotypic and genetic information, thereby enhancing the reliability and interpretability of our subsequent analyses. To ensure the quality and reliability of the rare variant analysis, we implemented stringent quality control (QC) measures on the whole-exome sequencing (WES) data using PLINK [ 51 ]. Our QC protocol comprised several steps. We first removed variants with a minor allele frequency (MAF) exceeding 0.01, thereby retaining only rare variants for subsequent analysis. We then excluded variants that significantly deviated from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), with a threshold of p < 1e-6. A significant departure from HWE can indicate genotyping errors or population stratification. Furthermore, we removed samples with missing sex information. Following these QC steps, we identified all rare predicted loss of function (pLoF) variants. These included stop-gain, stop-loss, frameshift insertion, frameshift deletion, and essential splice variants. This allowed us to focus on potentially impactful genetic alterations [ 52 ]. To reduce the impact of somatic mutations, we added a filtering step. Although UK Biobank WES data are derived from blood samples, prior studies [ 53 ] have shown that some rare variants may reflect somatic rather than germline mutations. Since somatic variants are more frequent in older individuals, we compared the age distributions of rare LoF variant carriers and non-carriers for each gene using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, followed by Bonferroni correction. Genes whose carriers were significantly older were flagged as potential CHIP-related signals. Three genes, ASXL1, TET2, and DNMT3A, met this criterion and were removed from our genome-wide analyses. This filtering step enhances the robustness of our results by minimizing confounding from age-related somatic mutations and comorbidity-driven phenotypic similarity. Embedding model Embedding learning and semantic matching have a rich history in natural language processing. Mikolov et al. introduced the continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) and Skip-gram models, collectively known as Word2Vec, to represent words in a vector space [ 22 ]. These neural network-based models achieve state-of-the-art performance in measuring syntactic and semantic word similarity. Many studies have leveraged Word2Vec to embed medical concepts for patients using Electronic Health Record (EHR) corpora, directly utilizing textual medical records as input. In our embedding analysis, we applied the CBOW Word2Vec model to embed the ICD-10 phenotype data from the UK Biobank. The CBOW model is an architecture used in word embedding where the surrounding context words are used to predict a target word. In CBOW, a window of context words around a target word is input to the model, and the goal is to predict the central (target) word from these context words. The model optimizes weights to maximize the probability of predicting the correct target word based on the given context. This approach is particularly well-suited for embedding ICD-10 codes based on the surrounding diagnosis records of individual patients. It effectively captures the contextual relationships between phenotypes, enabling the representation of medical concepts in a dense, continuous vector space. By leveraging these contextual relationships, the model can potentially uncover latent patterns and associations within the medical data that might not be immediately apparent through traditional analysis methods. Embedding for ICD-10 codes We aim to map phenotypes onto a static high-dimensional space, enabling numerical representation of their characteristics and facilitating similarity measurements between different phenotypes. We employed the Word2Vec embedding model to obtain static embedding vectors for the phenotypes. In the UK Biobank database, hospital inpatient data are recorded in the form of ICD-10 codes, each representing a specific disease. For instance, Q61.2 denotes, Polycystic kidney, adult type. Consequently, each patient’s record yields a sequence of ICD-10 codes, comprehensively describing their longitudinal inpatient condition. Based on this information, we developed the following approach to embedding the ICD-10 codes. For each ICD-10 code, we extracted keywords from its description, excluding punctuation and English stopwords. This process generated a vector of words for each patient based on his/her ICD-10 descriptions, with each word serving as a token in the training dataset. Each patient’s ICD-10 description was treated as a sentence. The output comprised embedding vectors for each word appearing in the inpatient dataset. We then employed an average embedding to derive the embedding vector for each ICD-10 code. This approach not only captured sequential information between different description tokens for each ICD-10 code but also leveraged detailed word tokens when two ICD-10 codes contain similar words. Embedding for individual using ICD-10 codes After obtaining the embedding vector for each ICD-10 code in the UK Biobank data, we proceeded to embed individuals using a weighted average embedding approach. This method enhances simple averaging of ICD-10 code embedding vectors by focusing only on less common ICD-10 codes (frequency  ) and assigning differential weights to these codes. We assigned weights by considering two pieces of information for an ICD code: (1) the significance level of each code with respect to the target disease, a process to be detailed in subsequent sections, and (2) the information content of each ICD-10 code, derived from its frequency. ≤ 0.01 For risk gene mapping, we focus on a specific disease of interest. Different phenotypes have varying degrees of associations with the target disease. Consequently, simply averaging all available ICD-10 embeddings to represent an individual’s overall phenotype embedding may be less effective to capture its relevance to the target disease. A more informative approach to characterizing an individual’s phenotypic profile in relation to a target disease involves assigning differential weights to distinct ICD-10 codes, with higher weights indicating a stronger relationship with the target disease. Target disease relevance is captured through the logistic regression model: l o g i t ( c i j ) = α + β d j + γ z j , (1) where  c  denotes the i-th ICD-10 code status of individual j,  ij d  represents the target disease status of individual j, and  j z  is the vector of covariates, specifically age and sex. We conducted a comprehensive scan of all ICD-10 codes in the UK Biobank inpatient dataset for the disease of interest, calculating a p-value for each ICD-10 code. Subsequently, we utilized these p-values to derive the weight for each ICD-10 code. By employing this weighting scheme, ICD-10 codes exhibiting a more significant association with the disease of interest are assigned larger weights, thereby playing a more prominent role in the individual embedding process. We also considered each ICD-10 code’s prevalence, denoted as  j r , in the embedding for each individual. k I C k = − log ( r k ) , (2) This formulation of information content assigns higher values to rarer phenotypes, reflecting our assumption that rarer phenotypes carry more information about rare diseases. The weight  w  for the  k k -th ICD-10 code is then calculated as: w k = S i g m o i d ( − log ( p -value ( k ) ) ) · I C k , (3) where the  p -value represents the significance level of the  k -th ICD-10 code in relation to the disease of interest. We use a sigmoid function to map the  p -value onto a [0.5, 1] scale, with greater weights indicating phenotypes more relevant to the disease of interest. The rationale behind this weighted average embedding is twofold. First, it aims to capture the differential importance of various phenotypes in relation to specific diseases, acknowledging that different phenotypes contribute distinctly to each disease. Second, it assigns more weight to rare ICD-10 codes to prevent common ICD-10 codes from overwhelming the information provided by less frequent, but potentially more informative, codes. This approach is based on the assumption that for rare diseases, the rare phenotypes each individual exhibits will carry more information about the disease. Consequently, this method ensures a more comprehensive and disease-specific representation of each individual’s phenotypic profile, potentially enhancing the detection of subtle disease associations. With such defined weights, the embedding vector for an individual  i  is calculated as: D i = ∑ k = 1 n i w k e k ∑ k = 1 n i w k , (4) where  D  is the embedding vector for individual  i i ,  n  is the total number of less common ICD-10 codes (frequency  i ) recorded in individual  ≤ 0.01 i ,  e  is the embedding vector of the  k k -th ICD-10 code, and  w  is the weight of the ICD-10 code  k e . This equation shows how we represent an individual using weighted ICD-10 code embeddings. k Risk gene mapping Based on the phenotype embedding of each individual, we can assign each gene a risk score for a disease of interest by investigating the similarity of the phenotype embeddings from rare LoF variant carriers with those having the target disease. A larger risk score indicates a higher likelihood that the candidate gene is associated with the disease of interest. Unlike other gene prioritization tools based on pathways or other biological criteria, we calculated the risk score solely based on phenotype similarities. This is accomplished in four steps. First, we extracted all the rare Loss of Function (LoF) variant carriers for each candidate gene, along with their genotype and phenotype information. Second, we extracted all individuals diagnosed with the target disease and their phenotype information. Third, we used the method described in the previous section to embed the LoF set carriers and disease patients, obtaining their embedding representations. Fourth, we calculated the disease risk score by comparing the phenotype similarity at the individual level between the different genes’ LoF set carriers and the diseased individuals. Our underlying assumption is that greater similarity between disease patients and gene LoF set carriers at the phenotype embedding level indicates higher pathogenicity of the gene for the disease of interest. This is based on the hypothesis that rare LoF variants have a large effect size on the phenotype compared to common variants. Notably, we considered not only the disease status as a binary value but all relevant phenotype information related to the disease, providing a more comprehensive and reasonable approach. Finally, we ranked each gene’s risk score based on the calculated average similarity score. S i = 1 m ( ∑ k = 1 m c o s i n e ( D i , D k ) ) , (5) where  S  is the average similarity score for individual  i i  compared to the disease patients group,  m  is the number of patients in the disease of interest comparison group,  D  is the embedding vector for each individual, and the   function represents cosine similarity, commonly used in calculating the similarity between two embedding vectors. Based on the similarity score for each LoF mutation carrier, we can calculate the overall score for each candidate gene as Cosine ( ) R G i = ∑ k = 1 n G i S k n G i , (6) where   is the risk score of gene  R G i i  to the disease of interest, and   is number of LoF carriers for gene  n G i i . For each observed risk score, we employed random sampling to determine its significance level. Under the null hypothesis ( H 0 ), we derived an empirical distribution of the risk score for the target gene by repeatedly randomly selecting  n  samples from the UK Biobank 200K inpatient dataset and computed the risk score for each group. This process was repeated 10,000 times to construct the empirical risk score distribution for gene  i i  under the null hypothesis for the target disease. The estimated p-value for the observed risk score is derived by calculating the Z-score using the formula: Z = R G i − μ 0 σ . (7) where   is the observed risk score,  R G i  is the average of the risk scores from randomly sampled sets of individuals, and  μ 0 σ  is the standard deviation of the simulated risk scores. The p-value is then computed from the standard normal distribution. We applied a one-tailed test with a significance level of 0.05 and used the Bonferroni correction to control for multiple testing, assessing whether the gene’s risk score is significantly higher than expected by chance. Intra-group similarity calculation To elucidate the overall phenotype patterns within the disease group and among carriers of rare LoF variants of a candidate gene, we calculated the intra-group phenotype similarity in the embedding space. This analysis aimed to explore whether individuals within these groups share greater phenotypic similarity compared to randomly selected individuals from the UK Biobank. First, we considered all individual pairs within the target group and calculated similarity scores for each pair within the target group. We then randomly selected an equal number of individuals from the UK WES 200K excluding the target group, and calculated pairwise similarity scores. A difference in the similarity score box plot of the two groups would suggest that the given group exhibits a distinct intra-group phenotype pattern compared to the overall dataset. For example, this analysis could reveal whether carriers of rare LoF variants in the  PKD1  gene demonstrate greater phenotypic similarity to each other than a randomly selected control group from the UK Biobank. Disease cohort definition For each target disease, we defined the case cohort based on the corresponding International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes recorded in the UK Biobank electronic health records. Individuals with at least one record of the disease-specific ICD-10 code were included as cases, while all other participants were considered part of the background control population. This definition ensures that cohort membership is determined directly from standardized diagnostic codes without requiring additional phenotype modeling or manual curation. Specifically, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) cases were identified using ICD-10 codes Q61.2 and Q61.3; Marfan syndrome cases were identified using Q87.4; and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) cases were identified using Q85.0. For each disease, individuals carrying any of these codes were assigned to the corresponding disease cohort. Control individuals were drawn from the remaining participants who did not possess the disease-specific ICD-10 codes. All disease and control cohorts were restricted to unrelated individuals of European ancestry, as defined by UK Biobank-provided kinship coefficients and ancestry principal components, to minimize population structure and relatedness confounding. Type I error rate control simulation Assessing the type I error rate of PERADIGM is essential for establishing the reliability of our framework. We conducted comprehensive simulations to evaluate calibration under the null hypothesis. For each disease (ADPKD, Marfan syndrome, and NF1), we used the observed distribution of target-disease similarity scores to generate simulated datasets. In each replicate, individuals were randomly assigned to synthetic “gene carrier groups” that matched the observed carrier-count distribution of real genes (denoted  N ). A pseudo gene-level risk score was then calculated as the average similarity score across individuals within each simulated group, and the same random-sampling association test used in the real analysis was applied to obtain null  g p -values. We assessed type I error control through four complementary analyses: (1) QQ plots were drawn to visually inspect inflation or deflation in the null  p -value distribution. (2) Empirical type I error rates were computed as the proportion of null  p -values below nominal thresholds (e.g., 0.05 and 0.01). (3) Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) tests were performed to evaluate deviations from the expected uniform distribution. (4) The genomic inflation factor ( λ ) was calculated to measure systematic inflation or deflation, with values near 1 indicating proper calibration. All simulation results are provided in the  S1 Text ,  S1 Table , and  S1 Fig . Alternative weighting schemes analysis To evaluate the impact of weighting schemes on individual embeddings, we conducted additional analyses to systematically assess how different weighting strategies influence the PERADIGM framework. We compared our original weighting scheme with four alternative strategies: (1)   ×  w = Sigmoid ( − log ( effect size ) ) , (2)  IC , (3)  w = Sigmoid ( − log ( p -value ) ) , and (4)  w = IC . Together with the original approach, these five schemes incorporate varying combinations of disease-association strength (via  w = Sigmoid ( − log ( effect size ) ) p -values or effect sizes) and phenotype information content (IC). The additional schemes were designed to disentangle the relative contribution of association strength and information content to the weighting mechanism in PERADIGM. For each scheme, we generated corresponding ICD-10 code weights and evaluated pairwise consistency among them by computing Pearson correlation coefficients across all weighting matrices. This analysis allowed us to assess whether the different formulations capture similar disease-relevant information or emphasize distinct aspects of the phenotype space. In addition, we re-ran the PERADIGM pipeline using each weighting scheme to examine how weighting choice influences downstream gene-level results and overall calibration. The consistency of significant findings across these weighting variants provides an indication of PERADIGM’s robustness to the specific choice of weighting formulation. All the alternative weighting scheme analysis results are provided in the  S1 Text ,  S2 Fig , and  S3 Fig .",Wangjie Zheng; Yuhan Xie; Jianlei Gu; Hongyu Li; Stefan Somlo; Whitney Besse; Hongyu Zhao,PLoS genetics,2025-12,10.1371/journal.pgen.1011976,minimal,True
PMID:24465906,"Multiscale, converging defects of macro-porosity, microstructure and matrix mineralization impact long bone fragility in NF1.","Bone fragility due to osteopenia, osteoporosis or debilitating focal skeletal dysplasias is a frequent observation in the Mendelian disease Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). To determine the mechanisms underlying bone fragility in NF1 we analyzed two conditional mouse models, Nf1Prx1 (limb knock-out) and Nf1Col1 (osteoblast specific knock-out), as well as cortical bone samples from individuals with NF1. We examined mouse bone tissue with micro-computed tomography, qualitative and quantitative histology, mechanical tensile analysis, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM). In cortical bone of Nf1Prx1 mice we detected ectopic blood vessels that were associated with diaphyseal mineralization defects. Defective mineral binding in the proximity of blood vessels was most likely due to impaired bone collagen formation, as these areas were completely devoid of acidic matrix proteins and contained thin collagen fibers. Additionally, we found significantly reduced mechanical strength of the bone material, which was partially caused by increased osteocyte volume. Consistent with these observations, bone samples from individuals with NF1 and tibial dysplasia showed increased osteocyte lacuna volume. Reduced mechanical properties were associated with diminished matrix stiffness, as determined by SAM. In line with these observations, bone tissue from individuals with NF1 and tibial dysplasia showed heterogeneous mineralization and reduced collagen fiber thickness and packaging. Collectively, the data indicate that bone fragility in NF1 tibial dysplasia is partly due to an increased osteocyte-related micro-porosity, hypomineralization, a generalized defect of organic matrix formation, exacerbated in the regions of tensional and bending force integration, and finally persistence of ectopic blood vessels associated with localized macro-porotic bone lesions.","Materials and Methods Mouse breeding and genotyping Nf1Prx1 and Nf1Col1 mice were bred and genotyped as described previously  [11] ,  [13] . All experimental procedures were approved by the ‘Landesamt für Gesundheitsschutz und Technische Sicherheit (LaGeTSi), Berlin, Germany (protocol number ZH 120) and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center (protocol number M/06/508). Histology For histological analysis, adult limbs were fixed in buffered 4% PFA, dehydrated in subsequent ethanol steps and embedded in methyl methacrylate (MMA) according standard laboratory procedures  [28] . For histological assessment, 5 µm plastic sections (RM2255, Leica, Germany) were stained with a combined von Kossa/Masson&Goldner or von Kossa/Toluidin procedure. Bright light microscopy was performed with an Olympus BX60 (Olympus, Japan). To analyze presence of acid bone matrix proteins, sections were stained with AgNOR  [29] . Deposited acidic matrix proteins appear brown with AgNOR staining, while negative regions remain unstained. The collagenous bone matrix was assessed with bright or polarized light microscopy after picrosirius red staining  [30] ,  [31]  (Leica DMRB, Germany). Linear polarization microscopy was performed with a Leica DMRB at which the polarization and analyst filters were set with 90° to each other. In bright light, picrosirius red stains all collagenous connective tissue (e.g. bone) red. By polarized microscopy, collagen fibers appear in shades of green, yellow and red. The polarization color indicates fiber thickness and degree of packaging  [30] ,  [31] . Red colored collagen fibers are highly packed and thick, while green colored fibers are less packed and disorganized  [31] . Histomorphometric analysis was performed with AxioVision Software (Zeiss, Germany). Nomenclature was used according to ASBMR guidelines  [32] . The ASBMR nomenclature does not provide a term for blood vessels, we used BlVes. Statistical analysis was performed with the unpaired t-test, * p≤0.05, ** p≤0.01. Immunohistology Immunodetection of proteins within mineralized cortical bone was achieved according to standard procedure  [33] . Frozen tissue was sectioned (5 µm) on a cryostat (Leica CM3050 S, Wetzlar, Germany). Sections were fixed in PBS buffered 4% PFA, then permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in PBS buffered 3% BSA, and blocked with 5% donkey serum. Antibodies were incubated in PBS buffered 3% BSA. The following antibodies were used for immunodetection: panendothelial cell antigen (550563, BD Pharmingen, USA) and anti-ratAlexa555 (A11081, Invitrogen, USA). Sections were analyzed with confocal microscopy (lsm 510, Zeiss, Germany). Micro computed tomography (microCT) analysis Bone samples were analyzed with low (6 µm voxel) or high (up to 1 µm voxel) resolution microCT from skyscan 1172 (skyscan, Belgium). For BMD analysis, samples were measured with a multi-sample holder at a 6 µm pixel size, 180° degree rotation, rotation angle 0.3°, filter Al 0.5 mm, averaging 4, random movement 3, voltage 80 kV, and current 120 µA. Raw data reconstruction occurred with NRecon, with a defined threshold of 0.00 to 0.10, smoothing 3, ring artefact correction 9, and beam hardening correction 30%. Quantitative evaluation was performed with CTan after definition of appropriated regions of interest (ROIs). For analysis of cortical bone porosity, samples were measured as single samples at 1 µm pixel size, 180° degree rotation, rotation angle 0.3°, filter Al 0.5 mm, averaging 4, random movement 10, voltage 80 kV, and current 120 µA. Quantitative evaluation was performed with CTan within a ROI comprising 1300 slices. Nomenclature was used according ASBMR guidelines  [32] . We used the terminology micro-porosity for Ot. lacunae (lacunae range from 100–4000 µm 3 ) and macro-porosity (lacunae range 0.05–1*10 6  µm 3 ) for large non-mineralized structures. Volumes for large pores comprise volumes occupied by blood vessels and non-mineralized bone tissue. Statistical analysis was performed with the unpaired t-test, * p≤0.05, ** p≤0.01. Sample preparation for mechanical tensile measurements Bone samples were sectioned from the mid-diaphysis of femora of three-month old mice and at other time points ( Table S2 ). Femora were sectioned along the tangential-longitudinal plane. Each half of the femoral cortex was polished mechanically from both sides in an automatic polisher (Logitech PM5, Logitech Ltd., Glasgow, UK) until the sample was planar. Care was taken to make sure the samples’ longitudinal axes were parallel to the main longitudinal bone axis. Polishing was performed using sequentially 5, 3, and 1 µm grit-sized diamond particles (DP-Spray P, Struers A/S, Ballerup, Denmark) until the final sample thickness of 50 µm was achieved. Gross sectioning of cortical bones was performed with a slow speed saw (Isomet Low Speed Saw, Buehler Ltd., Lake Bluff, IL, USA) and further processed by UV laser micro-dissection, prior to spectroscopic and micro-mechanical probing of the tissues. The samples were further sectioned in an UV laser micro-dissection system (PALM MicroBeam C, P.A.L.M. Microlaser Technologies GmbH, Bernried, Germany) to isolate sections with the dimension of 150 µm width×50 µm thickness ×2.5 mm length. All sectioning and micro-dissection were performed on hydrated samples. Mechanical Tensile analysis Tensile analysis was performed as described elsewhere  [34] . Tensile experiments were performed with a custom-made micro-tensile testing apparatus with a translation motor (M-126.DG, Physik Instrumente, Karlsruhe, Germany) and a 250 g load cell (ALD-MINI-UTC-250, A.L. Design Inc., Buffalo, NY, USA) at a constant strain rate of 0.2 µm s −1  to simulate quasi-static loading. Each sectioned sample was glued to stiff teflon foils with cyanoacrylate (Loctite Deutschland GmbH, Munich, Germany) and mounted into the tensile apparatus so that the tensile axis was parallel to the longitudinal axis of the sample. Strain measurements were accomplished by measuring the percent displacement between optical marks made by a 50 µm tip sized marker (Copic Multiliner, Too Marker Products, Japan) on the sample and tracked by a video camera (Basler A101f, Basler Vision Technologies, Ahrensburg, Germany). Both the camera and the tensile tester were controlled by customized software (Labview 7.0, National Instruments). Each sample was tensed until fracture. Stress-strain behaviours were obtained for each sample measurement and further analysis were performed to determine characteristic material properties. Each data point tested was a mean average of three samples. All samples were kept hydrated during measurements and tensed until failure. Scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) SAM measurements were performed as described elsewhere  [35] . Methylmethacrylate (MMA) embedded humeri were longitudinally sectioned to medial level, showing a complete open bone marrow cavity and separated anterior and posterior cortex. Subsequently, flat sample surfaces were prepared with a grinding procedure, using silicon carbide abrasive papers (grit size 4000; Phoenix 4000, Buehler, Düsseldorf, Germany). Afterwards the surface was polished with a hard synthetic cloth, ethyleneglycol suspension and 1 µm diamond particles. Samples were measured using a custom-made scanning acoustic microscope (SAM200Ex, Q-BAM, Halle, Germany) equipped with a spherically focused transducer with a nominal center frequency of 200 MHz (FHI 200/60°: Frauenhofer Institut für Biomedizinische Technik, St. Ingbert, Germany), providing a spatial resolution of approximately 8 µm in the focal plane. All measurements were performed in distilled and degassed water at 26±0.3°C. The sample surfaces were aligned in the focal plane of the transducer. A scan increment of 4 µm in x and y direction was chosen. For each (x,y) position the entire pulse echo signal V x,y (t) was stored. After the x,y scan, another x-scan with variable transducer-sample distance (z-scan) was performed for each sample within a bone area to perform a defocus correction. The confocal reflection amplitude was converted to values of the reflection coefficient  R  and acoustic impedance  Z  (in Mrayl; 1 rayl  = 1 kgm −2 s −1 ), as described elsewhere  [35] . The latter is equivalent to the square root of the product of mass density and apparent stiffness coefficient  c 
 [36] . For bone tissue,  Z  has been shown to be strongly correlated with the apparent stiffness (R 2  = 0.996)  [37] ,  [38]  and can therefore be used as a surrogate to assess variations of tissue stiffness. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) SAXS measurements were performed as described elsewhere  [39] . Longitudinal sections of MMA embedded humerus with a thickness in the order of the beam size (around 200 µm) were mounted on an automatic sample holder for polishing such that the longitudinal cross section is exposed at the surface. An X-ray beam with a wavelength of λ = 0.154 nm was generated using an X-ray generator (Bruker, AXS, Karlsruhe, Germany) with a rotating copper anode (40 kV/100 mA). The SAXS signal was measured with a 2D area detector (Bruker). Measurements were performed within cortical bone, following the bone cortex from proximal to distal in ∼400 µm step size. Two-dimensional SAXS patterns were evaluated for mean mineral particle thickness (T-parameter) and degree of particle alignment (Rho-parameter). The T-parameter measures the average thickness of mineral particles and higher values suggest increased volume of mineral platelets. The Rho-parameter indicates the relative orientation of mineral particles, where value “0” specifies no predominant orientation while “1” suggests parallel alignment. EDX measurements were performed with a desktop scanning electron microscope (SEM) device (Hitachi TM-3000, Hitachi High-Technologies Europe GmbH, Krefeld Germany) on MMA embedded humeri that were prepared in a similar fashion to SAXS samples. Samples were mounted onto double sided carbon tape and subsequently, placed in the SEM sample holder and moved approximately until 1 mm away from the source of the primary beam. An accelerating voltage of 15 kV was used to examine the greyscale levels of the mineral content in the respective Nf1Prx1 and Nf1Col1 samples. An EDX unit (Bruker SAXS GmbH, Berlin Germany) was used to collect elemental spectra, specifically at energies corresponding to 2.0 and 3.7 keV, representing spectral signals for phosphorus and calcium, respectively. Whole EDX maps were created to map mineralization degree and element gradients in whole humeri tissues from respective Nf1Prx1 samples. Analysis of EDX images was performed with ImageJ (Rasband WS. ImageJ, U.S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA, imagej.nih.gov/ij/, 1997–2012).",Jirko Kühnisch; Jong Seto; Claudia Lange; Susanne Schrof; Sabine Stumpp; Karolina Kobus; Julia Grohmann; Nadine Kossler; Peter Varga; Monika Osswald; Denise Emmerich; Sigrid Tinschert; Falk Thielemann; Georg Duda; Wenke Seifert; Thaqif El Khassawna; David A Stevenson; Florent Elefteriou; Uwe Kornak; Kay Raum; Peter Fratzl; Stefan Mundlos; Mateusz Kolanczyk,PloS one,2014,10.1371/journal.pone.0086115,minimal,True
PMID:28051113,"A comprehensive custom panel design for routine hereditary cancer testing: preserving control, improving diagnostics and revealing a complex variation landscape.","We wanted to implement an NGS strategy to globally analyze hereditary cancer with diagnostic quality while retaining the same degree of understanding and control we had in pre-NGS strategies. To do this, we developed the I2HCP panel, a custom bait library covering 122 hereditary cancer genes. We improved bait design, tested different NGS platforms and created a clinically driven custom data analysis pipeline. The I2HCP panel was developed using a training set of hereditary colorectal cancer, hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and neurofibromatosis patients and reached an accuracy, analytical sensitivity and specificity greater than 99%, which was maintained in a validation set. I2HCP changed our diagnostic approach, involving clinicians and a genetic diagnostics team from panel design to reporting. The new strategy improved diagnostic sensitivity, solved uncertain clinical diagnoses and identified mutations in new genes. We assessed the genetic variation in the complete set of hereditary cancer genes, revealing a complex variation landscape that coexists with the disease-causing mutation. We developed, validated and implemented a custom NGS-based strategy for hereditary cancer diagnostics that improved our previous workflows. Additionally, the existence of a rich genetic variation in hereditary cancer genes favors the use of this panel to investigate their role in cancer risk.","Methods Subjects This study was approved by the IMPPC scientific direction and carried out in accordance with IMPPC guidelines. Signed informed consent was obtained from all participants. Genomic DNA from 73 unrelated individuals clinically diagnosed with a cancer predisposition syndrome was obtained from blood lymphocytes using standard protocols. The 73 samples were grouped in three different sample sets: training, validation and re-analysis. The training set comprised 23 samples from patients who met the clinical criteria for HBOC (n = 7), FAP (n = 2), HNPCC (n = 7), NF1 (n = 6) and NF2 (n = 1). The validation set comprised 13 HBOC patients, 7 FAP, 11 HNPCC, 5 NF1, 2 NF2 and 1 patient who met the clinical criteria for Schwannomatosis, for a total of 40 samples. These samples contained 222 variants (36 pathogenic plus 186 VUS and polymorphisms), which was sufficient to determine specificity and sensitivity with a 95% CI of width <1.3% 23 . All samples had been genetically tested using pre-NGS workflows and methods (cDNA and DNA Sanger sequencing, conformation-sensitive capillary electrophoresis (CSCE), denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA)). These samples presented a broad mutational spectrum, including single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), small insertions and deletions and multiple exon deletions, many of them located in complex sequence contexts ( Supplementary Figure S6 ). Finally, the re-analysis set consisted of 14 individuals: 9 HNPCC positive for the Amsterdam criteria, 1 NF1 and 4 patients from the validation set with no pathogenic mutation as detected by pre-NGS testing workflows ( Supplementary Table S1 ). Moreover, the global results for the 150 patients genetically diagnosed using I2HCP were compared to the training and validation sets. The testing criteria for these patients were based on current international clinical criteria guidelines 33 . Samples were codified and mutation analysis was performed blindly for the validation set. Enrichment We used Agilent eArray to design our SureSelect bait library V1 (Agilent, California, USA), covering 106 genes for a total of 0.45 Mb. For each gene, we defined the ROIs as all coding exons and intron/exon boundaries (−35/+20 bp) of all translated isoforms according to NCBI human genome build 37 (GRCh37) and the Ensembl release 67. All ROIs were exhaustively covered with capture baits. A second design was developed after studying the behavior of V1 baits to improve capture results. In short, we monitored the coverage of all exons, identified problematic regions, performed a systematic rebalancing of baits and increased bait tiling using custom algorithms to improve capture of poorly covered areas and to enhance coverage uniformity ( Supplementary Figure S1 ). The bait library V2 included 122 genes responsible for most of the cancer predisposition syndromes and RASopathies ( Supplementary Table S1 ), for a total of 0.5 Mb of targeted DNA. Sample preparation and sequencing DNA was sonicated using a Covaris S2 (Covaris, Woburn, MA, USA). Sample preparation was performed following the SureSelect XT protocol for Ion Torrent or MiSeq. In the first approach, samples were enriched with bait library V1 after combining 4 equimolar indexed samples (pre-capture pooling) and sequenced in a PGM (Ion Torrent) 318 chip with One Touch 200 DLv2 template reagents and Ion PGM 200 sequencing reagents. In the second approach, 12 samples were enriched with bait library V2 according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Agilent) with minor modifications 34 , pooled after capture and sequenced in a MiSeq (Illumina) with Reagent Kit v2, 2 × 250. Validation by Sanger Sequencing For the subset of genes analyzed for a patient, any ROI with at least one base below 30x was Sanger sequenced using standard protocols (primer sequences available upon request). 30x minimum coverage was established as per De Leener  et al . 35 . Reportable variants (all pathogenic variants and VUS only for some syndromes) were also validated by Sanger sequencing. Human Genome Variation Society ( www.hgvs.org ) nomenclature guidelines were used to name the mutation at the DNA level and the predicted resulting protein. Bioinformatic Analysis NGS data were processed using a custom data analysis pipeline based on standard tools. In short, fastq files were mapped against the GRCh37 human genome assembly corresponding to Ensembl release 67 36  using BWA mem 37  and a sorted bam file was created with samtools 38 . Exhaustive coverage metrics were produced using a combination of bedtools 39  and custom R and Bioconductor 40  scripts. Variants, including substitutions and small insertions and deletions, were called using VarScan2 41  with the following parameters: –min-coverage 10 –min-reads2 2 –min-avg-qual 15 –min-var-freq 0.1 –strand-filter 0. Finally, variants were annotated with a combination of annovar 42  and custom scripts. bam-readcount was then used to compute additional quality parameters (quality of the bases supporting the reference and alternative alleles, position of the changes in the reads, number of mismatches present in reads supporting the alternative allele, etc.) that were combined to produce a set of variant quality indicators to guide the variant validation process. Final variant annotation included: basic variant quality parameters, gene and transcript annotations and effects, presence in variation databases (dbSNP and ClinVar), population frequencies (1000 G, ExAC and ESP6500) and in-silico prediction of effects in protein function (Polyphen2, SIFT, MutationAssessor, MutationTaster, PROVEAN, CADD). All information, including coverage metrics, variants, variant quality estimators and annotations, was stored in a PostgreSQL database. Variants were filtered using the regioneR bioconductor package 43  according to the clinical indication prior to generating the variant lists. The preliminary algorithm for exon-level copy-number estimation includes different normalization steps on the exon mean depth of coverage (including mean sample coverage and mean exon coverage across samples), similar to Kang  et al . 44 , and was run using a set of custom scripts. CLC Genomics Workbench v6 (Qiagen) was used to analyze data from I2HCP V1. Repeatability was measured by comparing the variants called for four samples prepared and sequenced twice under the same conditions. Reproducibility was calculated for twelve samples prepared once and sequenced twice in independent runs. In both cases, the concordance was computed as the number of common variants divided by the total number of variants identified. 95% confidence intervals were computed using the exact method from Hmisc R package. Uniformity was defined as the percentage of bases with a coverage within ± 20% of the mean coverage. C30 was defined as the percentage of ROI bases with coverage ≥30x.",Elisabeth Castellanos; Bernat Gel; Inma Rosas; Eva Tornero; Sheila Santín; Raquel Pluvinet; Juan Velasco; Lauro Sumoy; Jesús Del Valle; Manuel Perucho; Ignacio Blanco; Matilde Navarro; Joan Brunet; Marta Pineda; Lidia Feliubadaló; Gabi Capellá; Conxi Lázaro; Eduard Serra,Scientific reports,2017-01-04,10.1038/srep39348,minimal,True
PMID:15681480,Sensitive detection of deletions of one or more exons in the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) gene by multiplexed gene dosage polymerase chain reaction.,"Mutation detection in the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) gene is challenging because when combining mutation detection methods such as single-strand conformational polymorphism and heteroduplex analysis, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and direct sequencing of aberrant polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragments only 30 to 60% of the constitutional mutations are detected. Because large deletions and complete chromosome rearrangements are also described methods such as microarray-comparative genomic hybridization and fluorescence in situ hybridization are also used. The one type of mutation often missed corresponds to deletions encompassing one or few exons. To detect this type we have developed a swift and reliable method. We perform a gene dosage analysis with two fluorescent multiplex PCR assays that amplify 15 of the 17 NF2 exons. The labeled PCR products are quantified and gene dose is calculated with respect to controls. We tested the reliability of this method with DNA from eight NF2 patients with known heterozygous NF2 deletions, eight controls and four unknown NF2 patients. In all of the patients with known heterozygous deletions we found in several exons a reduction of gene dosage to 50 to 69%. In one NF2 patient with previously unknown mutation and a severe phenotype we found the gene dosage of two exons reduced by 50% indicating a deletion of these two exons on one allele. This finding was validated by reverse transcriptase-PCR on fibroblast and schwannoma cell cultures of this patient and cDNA sequencing. Our gene dosage assay will detect deletions of one or more exons as well as gross deletions of the whole coding region of the gene. It can complement the existing screening methods because it is faster and easier.",,Ruth Diebold; Britta Bartelt-Kirbach; D Gareth Evans; Dieter Kaufmann; C Oliver Hanemann,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,2005-02,10.1016/S1525-1578(10)60014-1,abstract_only,False
PMID:26904939,Insertional Mutagenesis Identifies a STAT3/Arid1b/β-catenin Pathway Driving Neurofibroma Initiation.,"To identify genes and signaling pathways that initiate Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) neurofibromas, we used unbiased insertional mutagenesis screening, mouse models, and molecular analyses. We mapped an Nf1-Stat3-Arid1b/β-catenin pathway that becomes active in the context of Nf1 loss. Genetic deletion of Stat3 in Schwann cell progenitors (SCPs) and Schwann cells (SCs) prevents neurofibroma formation, decreasing SCP self-renewal and β-catenin activity. β-catenin expression rescues effects of Stat3 loss in SCPs. Importantly, P-STAT3 and β-catenin expression correlate in human neurofibromas. Mechanistically, P-Stat3 represses Gsk3β and the SWI/SNF gene Arid1b to increase β-catenin. Knockdown of Arid1b or Gsk3β in Stat3(fl/fl);Nf1(fl/fl);DhhCre SCPs rescues neurofibroma formation after in vivo transplantation. Stat3 represses Arid1b through histone modification in a Brg1-dependent manner, indicating that epigenetic modification plays a role in early tumorigenesis. Our data map a neural tumorigenesis pathway and support testing JAK/STAT and Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibitors in neurofibroma therapeutic trials.","Experimental Procedures Animals Mice were housed in temperature- and humidity-controlled facilities on 12-hour dark-light cycles with free access to food and water. The animal care and use committees of Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center or University of Minnesota approved all animal procedures. See  Supplemental Experimental Procedures  for additional details. Pyrosequencing and Genemania analysis T2/Onc integration sites from 49 neurofibromas were cloned and sequenced using bar-coded primers and linker-mediated PCR, followed by pyrosequencing. Amplicon sequencing using the GS20 Flex pyrosequencing machine (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Primers used a unique 10-bp barcode-recognition sequence for each tumor sample. After removal of redundant and other non-specific noise as described ( Keng et al., 2009 ), we obtained 6,353 non-redundant insertions. Next, we identified CISs with more Sleeping Beauty mutagenic transposon insertions than predicted based on Monte Carlo criteria for statistical significance. We defined CISs as regions in the genome with six insertions located within 185 kb of each other, five insertions within 95 kb, four insertions within 35 kb, or three insertions within 5 kb. We used the Genemania algorithm to generate gene-gene association networks (genetic interaction, physical interaction, and pathways), after inputting these CIS. This generated networks, each of which we extended using the top 20 related genes precomputed in the program. These are defined as neighboring genes. We similarly colored genes significantly enriched in a given “biological process” within a Gene-Ontology (GO) category, after applying a significance cutoff of FDR<0.05). Embryonic and Neurofibroma sphere formation and SC culture Embryonic mouse spheres, dissociated from E12.5 DRG with 0.25% Trypsin 20 min. at 37°C (Mediatech; Herndon, VA) produced single-cell suspensions with narrow-bore pipettes and a 70 μm strainer (BD-Falcon). For mouse or human neurofibroma spheres, we chopped tissue into 1–3 mm 3  pieces, plated in 20mL L-15 (Mediatech) plus 0.5 mg/mL collagenase type 1 (Worthington; Lakewood, NJ), and 2.5 mg/mL dispase protease type II (Cambrex; East Rutherford, NJ) at 37°C for 4–6 hours. We plated trypan blue negative cells (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC) at 1 × 10 4  cells in 1 mL per well in 24-well low-binding plates in medium containing DMEM:F-12 (3:1) + 20 ng/ml rhEGF (R&D Systems), 20 ng/ml rh bFGF (R&D Systems), 1% B-27 (Invitrogen), 2 μg/ml heparin (Sigma). We maintained cultures at 37°C and 5% CO 2  and counted floating spheres after 4–7 days. To passage, we centrifuged sphere cultures, dissociated and plated at 1 × 10 4  cells/ml in fresh sphere medium as described ( Williams et al., 2008 ). For each experiment, we show a representative of 3 independent experiments. Immunohistochemistry Tissue was embedded in paraffin, and 6-μm sections were cut and stained with either H&E, toluidine blue or incubated overnight at 4°C with antibody: anti-S100β, Dako, Carpinteria, CA), Ki67 (Novacastra Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) or anti-P-Stat3 (Y705), anti-cleaved caspase 3, β-catenin (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA). Visualization methods were as described ( Williams et al., 2008 ). Western blots Western blots were performed using antibodies recognizing P-Jak2, Jak2, P-Stat3, Stat3, P-β-catenin, β-catenin, P-GSK3β, GSK3β, and β-actin (Cell Signaling, MA). At least three different tumor/cell lysates were analyzed per antigen. Tumorigenesis assay in nude mice We injected 5×10 5  mouse sphere cells/injection subcutaneously into athymic female nude mice (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN). After two months we dissected tumors and fixed them in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, then embedded in paraffin for histology. Measurement of tumor number and tumor size We perfused each mouse intracardially with 4% paraformaldehyde (w/v) in PBS, incubated overnight in 300 ml 4% paraformaldehyde, incubated overnight, again, in 50 ml decalcification solution (Cal-Rite, Richard Allan Scientific, Kalamazoo, MI), and then transferred to PBS. Using a Leica dissecting microscope, we dissected the spinal cord with attached DRG and nerve roots, and counted tumors. A tumor was defined as a mass surrounding the DRG and/or nerve roots, with a diameter greater than 1 mm, measured perpendicular to DRG/nerve roots. Tumor volumetric measurement MRI imaging and volumetric measurement of neurofibromas and statistical analyses using mixed effects modeling were as described ( Wu et al., 2012 ). Lentiviral infection We infected secondary  Nf1  neurofibroma spheres or  fl/fl ;DhhCre Stat3  DRG/neurofibroma spheres with shRNAs and non-target control (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA), β-catenin overexpression lentivirus ΔN90 (Addgene, Cambridge MA) or same backbone control (Sigma). We incubated lentiviral particles with neurofibroma spheres for 3–5 days and counted sphere numbers. For in vivo xenografts,  fl/fl ;Nf1 fl/fl ;DhhCre Stat3  DRG/neurofibroma spheres were infected with lentivirus in the presence of polybrene (8 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) for 16–20 hours, followed by selection in G418 (500mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). Spheres were collected and dissociated for xenograft injection. fl/fl ;Nf1 fl/fl ;DhhCre Statistics Kaplan Meier analysis used a Gehan-Breslow-Wilcox log-rank test. Neurofibroma growth was modeled by Mixed Effects Model Analysis.  P  values were generated with a random effects model analysis on log transformed tumor volume data using the SAS mixed procedure ( Jessen et al., 2013 ).

PMID:29351992,Involvement of Aryl hydrocarbon receptor in myelination and in human nerve sheath tumorigenesis.,Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor involved in xenobiotic metabolism. Plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) can transform into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) that are resistant to existing therapies. These tumors are primarily composed of Schwann cells. In addition to neurofibromatosis type 1 (,,Ghjuvan'Ghjacumu Shackleford; Nirmal Kumar Sampathkumar; Mehdi Hichor; Laure Weill; Delphine Meffre; Ludmila Juricek; Ingrid Laurendeau; Aline Chevallier; Nicolas Ortonne; Frédérique Larousserie; Marc Herbin; Ivan Bièche; Xavier Coumoul; Mathieu Beraneck; Etienne-Emile Baulieu; Frédéric Charbonnier; Eric Pasmant; Charbel Massaad,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2018-02-06,10.1073/pnas.1715999115,abstract_only,False
PMID:18974932,A role for the p53 pathway in the pathology of meningiomas with NF2 loss.,"The neurofibromatosis 2 locus (NF2) is inactivated through mutation and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 40-65% of all sporadic meningiomas, while the role of the p53 tumor suppression pathway in meningioma initiation and progression is still unclear. This study aims to determine if a p53 codon 72 arginine-to-proline polymorphism, found to be correlated with cancer development and cancer patient survival in other tumors, is associated with sporadic meningioma initiation or progression. We investigated Pro72 incidence in a cohort of 92 sporadic meningiomas and analyzed its association with histological grade (WHO classification) and with NF2 LOH (determined using polymorphic microsatellite markers on 22q). The Pro72 allele was not found to be selected for in the cohort. However, in the subgroup of meningiomas with NF2 LOH and carrying Pro72, 50.0% had high grade tumors (WHO grades II and III) compared to only 14.3% of those without NF2 LOH (OR = 6.0, CI = 1.56-23.11, P = 0.012). The significant association occurred only when considering subgroups of meningiomas with or without NF2 LOH, suggesting that not including NF2 status when analyzing study cohorts may explain the variability seen in the literature where all meningiomas were grouped together. Our data suggests a role for the p53 pathway in the progression of meningiomas in which NF2 is inactivated, and highlights the importance of accounting for NF2 LOH in future studies of meningiomas and the p53 pathway.","Materials and methods Subjects and sample collection This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Massachusetts General Hospital/Partners HealthCare and informed written consent was obtained from all individuals donating tissue. Between August 2000 and December 2004, 142 meningioma patients had tumors resected at Massachusetts General Hospital and consented to banking of excess tumor tissues for research. From the 142 patients, 50 were excluded from this study due to lack of adequate blood or tumor DNA for analysis or presence of multiple intracranial tumors suggestive of Neurofibromatosis 2 or the syndrome of multiple meningiomas. Medical records review was performed using the Research Patient Database Registry, an internal research tool providing access to demographic information, radiology reports and pathology reports. Blood and tumor DNA were extracted using a standard extraction kit as previously described [ 36 ]. NF2 loss of heterozygosity Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the  NF2  locus was determined as previously described [ 36 ]. Individuals heterozygous at  NF2 , as determined by analysis of blood DNA, were checked for loss of heterozygosity in tumor DNA at markers D22S193 (centromeric to  NF2 ),  NF2 TET and D22S929 (intragenic), and D22S268 and D22S430 (telomeric to  NF2 ). p53 codon 72 polymorphism analysis Determination of the polymorphism at codon 72 used a modification of the protocol described by Fan et al. [ 37 ] as follows. A 150 bp fragment containing the polymorphism was amplified in 100 ng of genomic DNA using the oligo-nucleotide primers 5′-AGATGAAGCTCCCAGAATGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTAGGTTTTCTGGGAAGGGA-3′ (reverse). A 10 μl total volume PCR contained 4 pM of each primer, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 2 μl of Q solution, 1 μl of 10X buffer, and 0.25 U of Taq polymerase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Initial denaturation was carried out at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 57°C for 30 s, 72°C for 1 min, and a final extension of 7 min at 72°C. PCR products were then digested using the endonuclease  BstUI  in 30 μl volumes according to the manufacturer's specifications (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The restriction fragment length polymorphism was detected on an 8% polyacrylamide gel and visualized using ethidium bromide. No restriction site is present in the  Arg72  allele, while the 150 bp PCR product is digested into two fragments of 114 and 36 bp in the  Pro72  allele. Statistical analysis Histological grades of tumors were available from the pathology reports as assessed by the pathologist according to the criteria of WHO 2000 [ 38 ]. For the purpose of statistical analysis, atypical (WHO grade II) and malignant (WHO grade III) meningiomas were grouped together as high grade meningiomas and compared to low grade tumors (WHO grade I). Analysis of the p53 codon 72 polymorphism was performed by combining those patients heterozygous and homozygous for Pro72 into one single group whenever the group with homozygous Pro72 was too small to be analyzed independently. Associations between two dichotomous variables, for example, p53 codon 72 and  NF2  LOH, were tested using Fisher's exact test (two tailed). The corresponding odds ratios are conditional maximum likelihood ratio estimates. Tests were conducted at the  P  = 0.05 level of significance and confidence intervals are reported at the 95% level.",ZeNan Chang; Chin-Lin Guo; Iris Ahronowitz; Anat O Stemmer-Rachamimov; Mia MacCollin; Fabio P Nunes,Journal of neuro-oncology,2009-02,10.1007/s11060-008-9721-3,minimal,True
PMID:34010628,Stem-like cells drive NF1-associated MPNST functional heterogeneity and tumor progression.,"NF1-associated malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are the major cause of mortality in neurofibromatosis. MPNSTs arise from benign peripheral nerve plexiform neurofibromas that originate in the embryonic neural crest cell lineage. Using reporter transgenes that label early neural crest lineage cells in multiple NF1 MPNST mouse models, we discover and characterize a rare MPNST cell population with stem-cell-like properties, including quiescence, that is essential for tumor initiation and relapse. Following isolation of these cells, we derive a cancer-stem-cell-specific gene expression signature that includes consensus embryonic neural crest genes and identify Nestin as a marker for the MPNST cell of origin. Combined targeting of cancer stem cells along with antimitotic chemotherapy yields effective tumor inhibition and prolongs survival. Enrichment of the cancer stem cell signature in cognate human tumors supports the generality and relevance of cancer stem cells to MPNST therapy development.","Star Methods Resource Availability Lead Contact Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Luis F.

Data and Code Availability The accession numbers for the sequencing data reported in this paper are GEO:  GSE152752  and GEO:  GSE165826 . Experimental Model and Subject Details Mouse Studies SKPs were isolated as previously reported ( Le et al., 2009 ) from neonatal  Nf1 f/f ; Trp53 f/f ;Nes-TK  mice within 2 weeks of age. SKPs were cultured in serum-free media with EGF (10 ng/ml) and FGF (10 ng/ml) supplements. Cre-expressing adenovirus was applied in  vitro  to induce recombination and verified by qPCR ( Le et al., 2009 ). Tumor-initiating cells were embedded into six-week-old nude mice sciatic nerves to generate  Nes-TK;SKP  allograft mice. BC and DRG were harvested from the E13.5 embryos as described (Le et al. 2014) from  Nf1 f/f ;Trp53 f/f ;CGD  mice. Recombination was induced  in vitro  with 10µM 4-hydroxytamoxifen for 72 hours or alternatively  in vivo  by tamoxifen gavage (200 mg/kg) of timed pregnant dams at E11.5 and E12.5 post plug assessment. BC&DRG cells were isolated and immediately orthotopically injected into the sciatic nerve of nude mice (without culturing) to generate  CGD ; BC&DRG  allograft models. The allografted nude mice were randomly assigned into experiment cohorts. A spontaneous MPNST GEMM,  cisNP , was previously described ( Vogel et al., 1999 ).  cisNP  mice have mixed backgrounds. The mice were genotyped within the 14 days after birth, and the littermates were randomly assigned into cohorts for experiments without selecting genders. All mice were maintained under formal MSKCC IACUC protocols. Mouse Primary Culture Mouse primary skin tissues were freshly dissected from two-week-old neonatal mice. Harvested tissues were minced and incubated with collagenase (100 µg/ml) in a 37°C water bath for 30 minutes, dissociated, and cultured in serum free medium supplemented with B27 and N2, plus EGF and FGF (10 ng/ml each) in 5% oxygen, 37°C incubators. Boundary cap and dorsal root ganglia (BD&DRG) were dissected from E13.5 embryos. The tissues were minced and flushed through a 23G needle and syringe. The dissociated tissues were cultured in the serum free medium mentioned above. Human Tumor Study Primary tumor biopsy samples were collected as approved by IRB National Institutes of Health study number 10-C-0086. A right upper arm nodular lesion was diagnosed as ANNUBP in a 19-year-old man at the Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute. Tumor samples were dissociated using an optimized method using dissociation media (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin solution, dispase II, collagenase I, and DNase I) and a gentleMACS dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec). Method details BrdU/EdU labeling BrdU pulse was administered via intraperitoneal injection at 50 mg/kg 2 hours prior to euthanasia. Long-time BrdU pulse exposure was administered in drinking water with 5% sucrose at 0.5 g/L and changed every three days. BrdU/EdU sequential labeling was done using equimolar concentration of BrdU and EdU at 10 mM/kg. Histology and Tumor Analysis Primary tumors were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), then processed and embedded in paraffin. MPNST tissue was sectioned by microtome at 5 µm and then analyzed by H&E, fluorescence, or horseradish peroxidase-based immunostaining, as previously described ( Alcantara Llaguno et al., 2009 ;  Le et al., 2009 ). For BrdU staining, tissue slides were incubated with 1M HCL for 30 minutes according to the online protocol ( https://www.abcam.com/protocols/brdu-staining-protocol ). The incorporated EdU were stained on top of BrdU staining with Click-iT™ EdU Cell Proliferation Kit for Imaging (ThemoFisher, Cat#  C10337 ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Mast cells were determined by following the manufacturer’s instruction of Eosinophil-mast cell co-staining (Abcam, Cat# ab150665). Images were taken using Zeiss confocal (LSM 800) microscopy or Mirax scanning. Quantification of images was done using Fiji/ImageJ. Tumor volume was measured by  in vivo  luminescence using luciferase reporter IVIS Spectrum scanner (PerkinElmer) or by  in vitro  caliper measurement and calculated according to the formula from Jackson Laboratory: Tumor volume (mm 3 ) = (length x width 2 ) /2 GCV Treatment For the  Nes-TK;SKP  allograft models, GCV chow and control chow were started at Day 2 after sciatic nerve embedding of recombined SKP cells for treated cohort (n=5) and control cohort (n=5), respectively. The GCV-treated cohort was also administered one dose of GCV through IP at 30 mg/kg (2 mg/ml water solution). The GCV chow and control chow were regularly refilled or replaced till Day 60. For the  cisNP  spontaneous model, the GCV chow and control chow were started at one month old and regularly maintained till the endpoint of the survival experiment. Mouse Tumor Dissociation and Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting The primary tumor was dissected and minced into small tissue blocks and then dissociated by gentleMACS Octo Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec) with 1 g/ml collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# C8051) with the preset protocol. The dissociated cells were washed in PBS 3 times and treated with blood cell lysate buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# R7757). The single cell solution was prepared in L15 media and filtered through a 40 mm strainer. Mouse Fc receptor was blocked by TruStain FcX™ (anti-mouse CD16/32) antibody (BioLegend, Cat# 101320) to avoid unspecific binding at 1 mg per 10 5  cells. Viable cells were gated using 7AAD (BioRad, Cat# 1351102), and endothelial, erythroid, and immune cells were gated out by PE-conjugated CD31, Ter119, and CD45 antibodies (BioLegend, Cat# 102410, 116208 and 103112). The sorting gates were set according to the unstained freshly-dissociated MPNST allograft. GFP+ and GFP- cells from the same tumor were analyzed and sorted by the S3e sorter (BioRad) after color compensation of GFP, PE, and 7AAD. MPNST Transcriptome Data Set Analysis The standardized microarray expression data of NF1-related tumors was downloaded from the NF Data Portal ( https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn5702691/wiki/394550 ) (Allaway et al., 2019). Data from the Miller and Jessen studies were identified as syn5950004 and syn6130081, respectively. Limma package was used for generating the human 621-MPNST signature on the data from Miller et al. ( Miller et al., 2009 ) with a stringent cutoff: fold changes > 8 and adjusted p-value < 0.001 ( Supplementary Table 2 ). The ssgesa was calculated by the GSVA package with default settings. Transcriptome Analysis of Sorted Tumor Cells Total RNA was extracted from paired GFP+ and GFP- population from each of the five  CGD;BC&DRG  allografts by Qiagen Rneasy plus mini kit. Total RNA was quantified by Qubit 3.0 fluorometer (Invitrogen), and quality was accessed by bioAnalyzer (Agilent). Paired-end 50 bp RNA sequencing was performed to reach about 30 million reads per sample on the Hiseq4000 sequencer by the Weill Cornell Genomics Core. The raw transcript counts were aligned to Refseq related to the build GRCh38-mm10 using STAR 2.4.2.8 by default settings on MSKCC high-performance computation clusters. The bioinformatics analysis was done using Bioconductor under the R v4.0 programming environment. Differentially expressed genes between GFP+ and GFP- tumor populations were analyzed by paired experiment design in the DeSeq2 package and defined as adjusted p >0.05 and fold change >1.5. The paired transcriptomes from GFP+ and GFP- cells of the same tumor were evaluated by the NCG list using the GSVA package with the ssgesa method. Quantitative RT-PCR Total RNA from tissue/cells was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (Cat# 74034). iScript cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad, Cat# 1708891) for cDNA synthesis. Sybr Green master mix (Applied Biosystems, Cat# A25780) was used for real-time detection of PCR products.  Gapdh  was used as the internal control. Quantification and statistics were performed in triplicate on QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR Systems. Primer sequences are saved as  Supplementary Table 6 . Doxorubicin and Diphtheria Toxin in vivo Treatment Doxo (4 mg/kg) was administered to mouse cohorts every three days for a total of 4 doses in  Nes-TK;SKP  allograft models. To improve intratumoral Doxo delivery, hyaluronidase (10,000 units) was co-administered with Doxo locally near the tumor allograft. Diphtheria toxin (50 µg/kg) treatment was started on Day 20 through IP injection after transplantation of 5,000 sorted GFP+ tumor cells from  BC&DRG;CGD  allograft tumors. Five diphtheria toxin treatment doses every three days with and without Doxo (4 mg/kg) were given to the transplanted cohorts of nude mice (n=5). Single Cell RNA Sequencing Analysis Primary tumor samples were dissociated using an optimized method using dissociation media and a gentleMACS dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec). Single cell suspensions were counted using both Cellometer Auto 2000 fluorescent viability cell counter (Nexcelom) and Luna-FL dual fluorescent cell counter (Logos Biosystems). Single cell capture (target capture 6000 cells/lane) was done using a 10X Chromium controller. 3’ whole transcriptome library preparation and sequencing were done using the manufacturer’s protocol and standard operating procedures of the CCR Single Cell Analysis Facility. Data were analyzed by the Seurat V3.0 package in the R programming environment. Sequencing data were filtered to retain cells with at least 500 but less than 2500 unique genes expressed and less than 20% of total UMIs originating from mitochondrial and ribosomal RNAs in one cell. The number of included principal components (PCs) was assessed using the JackStraw procedure implemented in JackStraw and ScoreJackStraw functions. 10 PCs were conserved. Cell clusters were determined using FindNeighbours (k = 10) and FindClusters functions (res = 0.4). tSNE plot was used to demonstrate the cell clusters. The single cell-based enrichment score and the cell cycle analysis were calculated using functions of Seurat V3.0. Cell cycle signatures and cell types were determined according to the published signature genes ( Fletcher et al., 2019 ) and the tutorial of the Seurat V3.0 ( https://satijalab.org/seurat/v1.4/pbmc3k_tutorial.html ). Quantification and Statistical Analysis IF and IHC staining was quantified with ImageJ. Staining quantification was assumed to be normally distributed. Statistical analysis between groups was performed using a two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were analyzed using the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. Data were analyzed using R, Excel, and GraphPad Prism v7. For bar figures presented, the center line represents mean ± SD, and the n was indicated accordingly. Assays are representative of ≥3 independent and biological replicates. P-values less than 0.05 were considered significant.

PMID:8176268,Localization of neurofibromin to keratinocytes and melanocytes in developing rat and human skin.,"Pigmentation defects are common in the inherited disease type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF1), predicting a role for the NF1 gene product, neurofibromin, in the skin. We used immunohistochemistry to determine the distribution of neurofibromin in normal developing and adult rat skin, normal neonatal and adult human skin, and skin from patients affected with NF1. The distribution of NF1 mRNA in the epidermis was also analyzed by in situ hybridization. NF1 mRNA and neurofibromin are highly enriched in the keratinocytes in the stratum spinosum of the epidermis in the embryonic, but not adult, rat and in both neonatal and adult humans. Immunoelectron microscopic analysis confirmed that neurofibromin is associated with the keratinocyte plasma membrane, particularly adjacent to desmosomes. Neurofibromin is also detectable in human melanocytes. Analysis of skin from NF1 patients showed normal neurofibromin expression in nine of ten hyperpigmented cafe-au-lait macules and in adjacent unaffected skin. We conclude that 1) neurofibromin expression in the perinatal rat closely parallels expression in the human; 2) reduction in detectable neurofibromin cannot be used to distinguish NF1 and normal human skin; and 3) neurofibromin might function in keratinocytes, as well as melanocytes.",,R Malhotra; N Ratner,The Journal of investigative dermatology,1994-05,10.1111/1523-1747.ep12379925,abstract_only,False
PMID:18242513,The loss of Nf1 transiently promotes self-renewal but not tumorigenesis by neural crest stem cells.,"Neurofibromatosis is caused by the loss of neurofibromin (Nf1), leading to peripheral nervous system (PNS) tumors, including neurofibromas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). A long-standing question has been whether these tumors arise from neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) or differentiated glia. Germline or conditional Nf1 deficiency caused a transient increase in NCSC frequency and self-renewal in most regions of the fetal PNS. However, Nf1-deficient NCSCs did not persist postnatally in regions of the PNS that developed tumors and could not form tumors upon transplantation into adult nerves. Adult P0a-Cre+Nf1(fl/-) mice developed neurofibromas, and Nf1(+/-)Ink4a/Arf(-/-) and Nf1/p53(+/-) mice developed MPNSTs, but NCSCs did not persist postnatally in affected locations in these mice. Tumors appeared to arise from differentiated glia, not NCSCs.","EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES All experiments using mice were performed in accordance with approved protocols by the University Committee on the Use and Care of Research Animals (UCUCA). Several  Nf1  alleles were used in these studies including  Nf1  (germline mutant) mice ( − Jacks et al., 1994 ),  Nf1  mice for conditional deletion ( fl Zhu et al., 2001 ), and  Nf1/p53  cis mutant mice ( − Cichowski et al., 1999 ). For conditional deletion of  Nf1  we used  Wnt-1-Cre  ( + Danielian et al., 1998 ),  3.9Periostin-Cre  ( + Lindsley et al., 2007 ), and  P0a-Cre  ( + Giovannini et al., 2000 ) mice. Compound mutant mice were generated by mating  Nf1  mice with  +/− Ink4a  mice ( −/− Sharpless et al., 2001 ), or  Ink4aArf  mice ( −/− Serrano et al., 1996 ). Isolation of NCSCs Timed pregnant matings of  Nf1 +/−  mice were set up to obtain E13  Nf1 −/−  embryos. DRGs (cervical, thoracic, and lumbar), sciatic nerve, sympathetic chain, and gut (including stomach, small intestine, and hindgut) were dissected from E12.5 to E13.5  Nf1 +/+ ,  Nf1 +/− , and  Nf1 −/−  littermates and collected in ice-cold Ca, Mg-free HBSS. Tissues were dissociated for 4 min at 37°C in 0.05% trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California; diluted 1:10 in Ca, Mg-free HBSS) with 0.25 mg/ml type IV collagenase (Worthington, Lakewood NJ) then quenched with staining medium: L15 medium containing 1 mg/ml BSA (Sigma A-3912, St. Louis, MO), 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD), and 25 mg/ml deoxyribonuclease type 1 (DNAse1, Sigma D-4527). Cells were centrifuged, resuspended in staining medium without DNAse, triturated, filtered through nylon screen (45 μm, Sefar America, Kansas City, MO) to remove aggregates, counted by hemocytometer, and added to culture. In some experiments, cell suspensions were stained with antibodies against p75 (Ab 1554; Chemicon) and α 4  integrin (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA) for analysis by flow-cytometry ( Bixby et al., 2002 ). In some experiments cells were stained for BrdU using a flow-cytometry kit (BD Pharmingen; cat#559619).

PMID:27527648,Patient-reported outcomes of pain and physical functioning in neurofibromatosis clinical trials.,"OBJECTIVE: Tumors and other disease complications of neurofibromatosis (NF) can cause pain and negatively affect physical functioning. To document the clinical benefit of treatment in NF trials targeting these manifestations, patient-reported outcomes (PROs) assessing pain and physical functioning should be included as study endpoints. Currently, there is no consensus on the selection and use of such measures in the NF population. This article presents the recommendations of the PRO group of the Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) International Collaboration for assessing the domains of pain and physical functioning for NF clinical trials. METHODS: The REiNS PRO group reviewed and rated existing PRO measures assessing pain intensity, pain interference, and physical functioning using their systematic method. Final recommendations are based primarily on 4 main criteria: patient characteristics, item content, psychometric properties, and feasibility for clinical trials. RESULTS: The REiNS PRO group chose the Numeric Rating Scale-11 (≥8 years) to assess pain intensity, the Pain Interference Index (6-24 years) and the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Pain Interference Scale (≥18 years) to evaluate pain interference, and the PROMIS Physical Functioning Scale to measure upper extremity function and mobility (≥5 years) for NF clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: The REiNS Collaboration currently recommends these PRO measures to assess the domains of pain and physical functioning for NF clinical trials; however, further research is needed to evaluate their use in individuals with NF. A final consensus recommendation for the pain interference measure will be disseminated in a future publication based on findings from additional published research.",,Pamela L Wolters; Staci Martin; Vanessa L Merker; James H Tonsgard; Sondra E Solomon; Andrea Baldwin; Amanda L Bergner; Karin Walsh; Heather L Thompson; Kathy L Gardner; Cynthia M Hingtgen; Elizabeth Schorry; William N Dudley; Barbara Franklin,Neurology,2016-08-16,10.1212/WNL.0000000000002927,abstract_only,False
PMID:7977647,Characterization of naturally occurring cutaneous neurofibromatosis in Holstein cattle. A disorder resembling neurofibromatosis type 1 in humans.,"Neurofibromatosis in cattle is typically a noncutaneous disease. A small group of cows in a Holstein dairy herd developed cutaneous neurofibromatosis. This unique condition was investigated and compared with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) in humans. All cutaneous lesions but one were consistent with neurofibromas in noncutaneous sites in cattle and neurofibromas in patients with NF1. One bovine lesion was classified as a neurofibrosarcoma. Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy supported Schwannian differentiation in benign and malignant lesions. Linkage analysis with a polymorphism in the bovine NF1 gene confirmed that two affected animals from the same sire inherited the same paternal NF1 allele. Bovine cutaneous neurofibromatosis is a naturally occurring disease in this group of animals, characterized by skin tumors morphologically identical to those of NF1. An informative polymorphism at the NF1 locus of two animals and their sire suggests this disorder may be caused by hereditary mutations at the bovine NF1 locus.",,E A Sartin; S E Doran; M G Riddell; G A Herrera; G S Tennyson; G D'Andrea; R D Whitley; F S Collins,The American journal of pathology,1994-11,,abstract_only,False
PMID:24386979,"Modulation of Ras signaling alters the toxicity of hydroquinone, a benzene metabolite and component of cigarette smoke.","BACKGROUND: Benzene is an established human leukemogen, with a ubiquitous environmental presence leading to significant population exposure. In a genome-wide functional screen in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, inactivation of IRA2, a yeast ortholog of the human tumor suppressor gene NF1 (Neurofibromin), enhanced sensitivity to hydroquinone, an important benzene metabolite. Increased Ras signaling is implicated as a causal factor in the increased pre-disposition to leukemia of individuals with mutations in NF1. METHODS: Growth inhibition of yeast by hydroquinone was assessed in mutant strains exhibiting varying levels of Ras activity. Subsequently, effects of hydroquinone on both genotoxicity (measured by micronucleus formation) and proliferation of WT and Nf1 null murine hematopoietic precursors were assessed. RESULTS: Here we show that the Ras status of both yeast and mammalian cells modulates hydroquinone toxicity, indicating potential synergy between Ras signaling and benzene toxicity. Specifically, enhanced Ras signaling increases both hydroquinone-mediated growth inhibition in yeast and genotoxicity in mammalian hematopoetic precursors as measured by an in vitro erythroid micronucleus assay. Hydroquinone also increases proliferation of CFU-GM progenitor cells in mice with Nf1 null bone marrow relative to WT, the same cell type associated with benzene-associated leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Together our findings show that hydroquinone toxicity is modulated by Ras signaling. Individuals with abnormal Ras signaling could be more vulnerable to developing myeloid diseases after exposure to benzene. We note that hydroquinone is used cosmetically as a skin-bleaching agent, including by individuals with cafe-au-lait spots (which may be present in individuals with neurofibromatosis who have a mutation in NF1), which could be unadvisable given our findings.","Methods Growth inhibition of yeast by hydroquinone was assessed in mutant strains exhibiting varying levels of Ras activity. Subsequently, effects of hydroquinone on both genotoxicity (measured by micronucleus formation) and proliferation of WT and  Nf1  null murine hematopoietic precursors were assessed. Methods Yeast strains and culture Diploid yeast deletion strains used for growth analyses were of the BY4743 background ( MATa / MAT α,  his3∆1 / his3∆1 ,  leu2∆0 / leu2∆0 ,  lys∆0 / LYS2 ,  MET15 / met15∆0 ,  ura3∆0 / ura3∆0 , Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA).

Growth was conducted in liquid rich media (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose, YPD) for deletion strain growth curve assays, and liquid synthetic complete media lacking uracil (SC-ura) using either 2% dextrose or 2% raffinose as a carbon source for pre-growths of the overexpression strain for growth curve assays (detailed below). Liquid rich media for induction of protein overexpression for growth curve assays contained both galactose and raffinose (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% galactose, 2% raffinose, YPGal + Raf). Yeast hydroquinone exposures Hydroquinone (HQ) (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) stock solutions were prepared fresh in sterile nuclease-free water (ISC BioExpress, Kaysville, UT) and protected from light. Yeast deletion strain growth curve assays Yeast strains were pre-grown to mid-log phase, diluted to an optical density at 600 nm (OD 600 ) of 0.0165, and dispensed into individual wells of a 48-well plate (non-treated polystyrene, Grenier Bio-One, Monroe, NC). HQ stock solution was added to the desired final concentrations with at least two replicates per dose. Plates were incubated in a GENios microplate reader (Tecan, Durham, NC) set to 30°C with intermittent shaking. OD 595  measurements were taken at 15-minute intervals for a period of 24 hours. Raw absorbance data were averaged for all replicates, background corrected, and plotted as a function of time. The area under the curve (AUC), used as a measure of growth, was calculated with Excel 2008 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) and expressed as a percentage of the control. AUCs were compared with two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-tests, using GraphPad Prism version 5.01 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Data for each strain is derived from three independent biological replicates. Yeast RAS1 overexpression strain growth curve assays The yeast  RAS1  overexpression strain was pre-grown overnight to stationary phase in SC-ura 2% dextrose, diluted 1:100 in SC-ura 2% raffinose and grown overnight again to alleviate glucose repression. Cells were then diluted in YPGal + Raf to induce protein overexpression, and grown for 5 hours to mid-log phase. Cells were subsequently diluted to an optical density at 600 nm (OD 600 ) of 0.0165 in YPGal + Raf, and dispensed into wells of a 48-well plate. Hydroquinone treatment, plate measurement and data processing were all carried out in the same manner as for the deletion strain growth curve assays. Mice Mx1-Cre, Nf1 
  mice (129SV × C57BL/6 J) were generated and somatic  flox/flox 
 Nf1  inactivation was induced as described elsewhere [ 18 ]. We refer to hematopoietic cells from these animals as  Nf1 
  throughout this paper. Cells from wild type (WT) littermates were used as controls in all experiments. Mice were maintained in the sterile animal care facility at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and were fed pelleted chow and acidified water ad libitum. All experimental procedures involving mice were approved by the UCSF Committee on Animal Research. −/− 
 Murine cells Tissue was harvested from mice at ~12 weeks. Bone marrow (BM) cells were isolated from the hind legs and were mechanically dissociated by pipetting in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM) with L-glutamine/4% FBS (IMDM – Lonza, Walkersville, MD). Single-cell suspensions were prepared by passing dissociated cells through 70 μm cell strainers. BM cells were counted using a hemocytometer. Erythropoietic culture Total BM cells were labeled with biotin-conjugated α-Lin Abs, consisting of α -CD3e, α -CD11b, α -CD45R/B220, α -Ly6G/Ly6C, and α -TER-119 Abs (2 μl of each Ab/10 6  cells; BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), and Lineage-marker-negative (Lin - ) cells were purified through a 0.3-in StemSep negative selection column as per the manufacturer’s instructions (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada). Purified cells were seeded in fibronectin-coated (2 μg/cm 2 ) tissue culture treated 24-well polystyrene plates (BD Falcon, BD Biosciences San Jose, CA) at a cell density of 10 5  cells/ml. On the first day, purified cells were cultured in IMDM containing basal supplements consisting of: 15% FBS, 1% detoxified BSA, 200 μg/ml holotransferrin (Sigma, St Louis, MO), 10 μg/ml recombinant human insulin (Sigma), 10 -4  M β-mercaptoethanol, 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin; as well as soluble erythropoietic factors including erythropoietin (Epo - Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA) at 7.5 units/ml and stem cell factor (SCF - R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) at 10 ng/ml. For all cultures, media was replaced with erythroid-differentiation medium (EDM) (IMDM with 20% FBS, and 10 -4  M β-mercaptoethanol) after 1 day of culture. At harvest, suspended cells were removed from culture wells by pipetting, and the culture well was then incubated in PBS/10% FBS/5 mM EDTA for 5 minutes at 37°C to dissociate adherent cells. Dissociated cells were then removed from the culture well by pipetting and combined with the suspended cell fraction from the same culture well for analysis. Viable cell counts, based on trypan blue exclusion, were conducted using a hemocytometer. Genotoxic treatment of erythropoietic cultures Lin -  BM was cultured in 500 μl of medium per culture well according to the method described for erythropoietic culture. Cultures were treated one hour before being washed and fed with EDM, as earlier described. HQ solutions were prepared immediately before treatment and protected from light to minimize degradation and decreased reactivity. HQ (Sigma) was first dissolved in warm PBS to make a 10 mM stock solution. This 10 mM solution was diluted in 4°C PBS to produce 7.575 mM and 5.05 mM solutions, and 5 μl of a solution was added to each culture to expose them to the targeted concentrations of HQ (100 μM, 75 μM, and 50 μM). Cytospin preparation and cytological staining Approximately 2×10 4  cells per culture were centrifuged onto slides for 2 minutes at 800 rpm (Statspin Cytofuge 2; Iris Sample Processing Westwood, MA) and air-dried. For acridine orange staining, cells were fixed in 25°C methanol for 10 minutes and stained in acridine orange (Sigma) at a concentration of 20 μg/ml in staining buffer (19 mM NaH 2 PO 4  and 81 mM Na 2 HPO 4 ) for 10 minutes at 4°C. Following acridine orange staining, slides were protected from light, washed for 10 minutes in 4°C staining buffer, air-dried, and stored at 4°C until microscopic examination and scoring was complete. Histological imaging and quantification Slides were examined by using an Axioplan 2 microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, Germany) and representative micrographs were acquired by using Axiocam MRm (Carl Zeiss). Micrographs of acridine orange stained cells were acquired by using a 63x oil-immersion objective and fluorescence (100 W Hg lamp excitation). Cytological slides were examined blind, and differential cell counting was used to enumerate relevant cell types and thus quantify the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MN-PCEs) among total PCEs (>2,000 PCEs scored per slide). Statistics To determine the statistical significance of mean comparisons, distributions were first checked for normality by using the Shapiro–Wilk's test with STATA 11 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Normal data sets were then subjected to two-way ANOVA analysis. Interaction between dose and breed was examined but found to be insignificant and so was not used in the model. Two-tailed Student’s  t  tests were executed by using the data analysis tool in Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). Unequal variance was assumed to increase confidence in significant p-values. Progenitor assays Colony forming unit granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM) progenitors were grown in MethoCult® (StemCell Technologies, Cat #03434) according to manufacturer’s instructions (Technical Manual Cat# 28405). Briefly, BM cells were suspended at 4×10 5 /ml in IMDM/2% FBS and then 200 μl of this suspension was added to 4 ml aliquots of MethoCult® M3434, which were then vortexed briefly. A fresh solution of 10 mM HQ (Sigma) was then prepared in warm PBS and sterile filtered through a 0.2 μm membrane (Pall Life Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI). This 10 mM HQ stock solution was then further diluted to give 600 μM, 400 μM, and 200 μM solutions, and then 200ul of one of these solutions was used to treat each 4 ml aliquot of MethoCult® at a concentration of 30 μM, 20 μM, or 10 μM. After delivery of HQ, the MethoCult® was again vortexed briefly and the tubes were left to stand for 5 minutes to allow bubbles to dissipate. A 16G blunt-end needle and 3 ml syringe were then used to draw up the treated MethoCult® and dispense 1.1 ml into each of three 35 mm petri dishes (StemCell Technologies, Cat# 27100). These 35 mm culture dishes (3 per genotype/treatment replicate) were then tilted and rotated gently to evenly distribute MethoCult® and placed in a 100 mm culture dish that also contained an uncovered 35 mm culture dish containing 3 ml of sterile water to maintain humidity. The cultures were placed in an incubator and maintained at 37°C, 5% CO 2  in air, and >95% humidity for 12 days, then colonies were scored. The scoring scientist was blinded to the identity of each culture (genotype/treatment). Two independent preparations of each culture condition (combination of genotype/treatment) were used in each trial, and the entire experiment was repeated three further times using independent sets of  Nf1 −/− /WT littermates.",Matthew North; Joe Shuga; Michele Fromowitz; Alexandre Loguinov; Kevin Shannon; Luoping Zhang; Martyn T Smith; Chris D Vulpe,BMC cancer,2014-01-05,10.1186/1471-2407-14-6,minimal,True
PMID:39373898,Identification of Pathogenic Missense Mutations of NF1 Using Computational Approaches.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a prevalent autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the NF1 gene, leading to multisystem disorders. Given the critical role of cysteine residues in protein stability and function, we aimed to identify key NF1 mutations affecting cysteine residues that significantly contribute to neurofibromatosis pathology. To identify the most critical mutations in the NF1 gene that contribute to the pathology of neurofibromatosis, we employed a sophisticated computational pipeline specifically designed to detect significant mutations affecting the NF1 gene. Our approach involved an exhaustive search of databases such as the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD), UniProt, and ClinVar for information on missense mutations associated with NF1. Our search yielded a total of 204 unique cysteine missense mutations. We then employed in silico prediction tools, including PredictSNP, iStable, and Align GVGD, to assess the impact of these mutations. Among the mutations, C379R, R1000C, and C1016Y stood out due to their deleterious effects on the biophysical properties of the neurofibromin protein, significantly destabilizing its structure. These mutations were subjected to further phenotyping analysis using SNPeffect 4.0, which predicted disturbances in the protein's chaperone binding sites and overall structural stability. Furthermore, to directly visualize the impact of these mutations on protein structure, we utilized AlphaFold3 to simulate both the wild-type and mutant NF1 structures, revealing the significant effects of the R1000C mutation on the protein's conformation. In conclusion, the identification of these mutations can play a pivotal role in advancing the field of precision medicine and aid in the development of effective drugs for associated diseases.","Materials and Method Online Data Retrieval The standard protein sequence of NF1 was obtained from UniProt (UniprotKB  P21359 , ENSG00000196712). The missense mutations were collected from UniProt (UniProt ID UP51795) as well as from the HGMD ( http://www.hgmd.org/ ) and ClinVar databases ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ). Extensive information about the protein and its mutations was gathered through OMIM ( https://omim.org/ ) and various academic literature reviews (Kehrer-Sawatzki and Cooper  2022 ; Ning et al.  2020 ; Philpott et al.  2017 ; Upadhyaya et al.  1994 ; Wilson et al.  2021 ). In this study, we systematically searched the HGMD, UniProt, and ClinVar databases using the keyword “NF1” to identify missense mutations with clinical significance. We focused on mutations directly related to NF1 and applied ACMG guidelines to select those mutations that are supported by experimental validation and clinical data, and are classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic, ensuring the accuracy and clinical relevance of our research dataset. Pathogenicity Prediction of Mutations The effects of mutations on protein functions were analyzed using the PredictSNP2 tool ( https://loschmidt.chemi.muni.cz/predictsnp/ ). PredictSNP functions as a consensus classifier that integrates multiple prediction algorithms, such as MAPP, PhD-SNP, PolyPhen1, PolyPhen2, SIFT, SNAP, PANTHER, nsSNP, and Multimodal Annotation Generated Pathogenic Impact Evaluator (MAGPIE) analyzer (Bendl et al.  2014 ). The output of MAGPIE ranges from 0 to 1 (0 indicates a benign mutation, while 1 indicates a highly pathogenic mutation) (Liu et al.  2024 ). The NF1 mRNA template ( NM_000267.3 ) was retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NM_000267.3?report=fasta ). We input the amino acid sequence of the NF1 protein into the PredictSNP tool. For each mutation site, we utilized the default prediction parameters, including multiple prediction algorithms such as MAPP, PhD-SNP, PolyPhen-2, SIFT, SNAP, and PANTHER. After the analysis was completed, we collected the predicted scores for each mutation and assessed the potential pathogenicity of the mutations based on the scoring criteria of PredictSNP (a score > 75 indicates potential harm). Stability Prediction of Mutations The iStable-integrated server, accessible at predictor.nchu.edu.tw/iStable, features two machine learning-based tools, iMutant and MUpro, which utilize thermodynamic parameters to forecast changes in protein stability due to mutations (Chen et al.  2020 ). iMutant, which operates on a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, assesses changes in protein stability by calculating the difference in free energy (ΔΔ G ) between the mutant and wild type proteins. This tool categorizes stability changes as either an increase (ΔΔ G  > 0) or a decrease (ΔΔ G  < 0). MUpro combines SVM and neural network technologies to analyze the effect of mutations on protein stability and assigns a confidence score ranging from − 1 to 1, indicating decreased stability for scores below zero and increased stability for scores above zero. IStable then uses sequence data to provide a meta-prediction of stability changes, where higher scores reflect higher prediction confidence. Using the iStable tool, we input the protein sequences before and after the mutation. We selected the iMutant 2.0 and MUpro algorithms to predict the thermodynamic parameter changes caused by the mutations. We recorded the free energy change (ΔΔ G ) values caused by each mutation and assessed the impact of the mutations on protein stability based on the sign and magnitude of ΔΔ G . Align-GVGD ( http://agvgd.hci.utah.edu/agvgd_input.php ) is another tool that applies the Grantham difference across multiple sequence alignments (MSA) for broad comparisons. It classifies amino acid sequences and mutations into classes ranging from 15 to 65, with class 15 being neutral and class 65 indicating a deleterious impact (Tavtigian et al.  2006 ). With the Align GVGD tool, we performed a multiple sequence alignment of the mutated sequences against the wild-type sequence. Through the Grantham chemical difference scoring system, we classified each mutation to predict its impact on protein function. Mutations were categorized into different classes, ranging from 15 (neutral) to 65 (deleterious), with particular attention given to mutations rated as class 65.",Jie Chen; Ziqiao Li; Yiheng Wu; Xiang Li; Zipei Chen; Pan Chen; Yuhan Ding; Chengpeng Wu; Lidan Hu,Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,2024-10-07,10.1007/s12031-024-02271-x,minimal,True
PMID:27815398,Optic pathway glioma volume predicts retinal axon degeneration in neurofibromatosis type 1.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether tumor size is associated with retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, a measure of axonal degeneration and an established biomarker of visual impairment in children with optic pathway gliomas (OPGs) secondary to neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). METHODS: Children with NF1-OPGs involving the optic nerve (extension into the chiasm and tracts permitted) who underwent both volumetric MRI analysis and optical coherence tomography (OCT) within 2 weeks of each other were included. Volumetric measurement of the entire anterior visual pathway (AVP; optic nerve, chiasm, and tract) was performed using high-resolution T1-weighted MRI. OCT measured the average RNFL thickness around the optic nerve. Linear regression models evaluated the relationship between RNFL thickness and AVP dimensions and volume. RESULTS: Thirty-eight participants contributed 55 study eyes. The mean age was 5.78 years. Twenty-two participants (58%) were female. RNFL thickness had a significant negative relationship to total AVP volume and total brain volume (p < 0.05, all comparisons). For every 1 mL increase in AVP volume, RNFL thickness declined by approximately 5 microns. A greater AVP volume of OPGs involving the optic nerve and chiasm, but not the tracts, was independently associated with a lower RNFL thickness (p < 0.05). All participants with an optic chiasm volume >1.3 mL demonstrated axonal damage (i.e., RNFL thickness <80 microns). CONCLUSIONS: Greater OPG and AVP volume predicts axonal degeneration, a biomarker of vision loss, in children with NF1-OPGs. MRI volumetric measures may help stratify the risk of visual loss from NF1-OPGs.",,Robert A Avery; Awais Mansoor; Rabia Idrees; Carmelina Trimboli-Heidler; Hiroshi Ishikawa; Roger J Packer; Marius George Linguraru,Neurology,2016-12-06,10.1212/WNL.0000000000003402,abstract_only,False
PMID:25557241,Outcomes of preimplantation genetic diagnosis in neurofibromatosis type 1.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of patient and facility level factors on the success of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in patients with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1). DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Large PGD reference laboratory. PATIENT(S): All patients with NF1 referred from June 2004 to May 2013. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Embryos' NF1 mutation status and live birth rates. RESULT(S): Seventy-seven couples underwent 156 PGD cycles during the study period. The average maternal age at the time of embryo biopsy was 33.2 years. The majority of embryos had a day 3 single blastomere biopsy without aneuploidy screening. A diagnosis was obtained for 80% of biopsied embryos; 20% of biopsies were nondiagnostic due to technical failures. Diagnosis was more often obtained for embryos of parents with familial disease and for embryos biopsied at centers that referred multiple NF1 cases. Among diagnosed embryos, 483/1,060 (46%) were unaffected by the parental NF1 mutation. Twenty-two (14%) of the 156 cycles had a confirmed live birth; if the observed success rate is applied to cycles with unknown outcomes, 33/156 (21%) cycles are expected to have resulted in live birth. In multivariate logistic regression, having a live birth was significantly associated with having more unaffected embryos available for transfer (odds ratio 1.33 per additional embryo, 95% confidence interval 1.02-1.72). CONCLUSION(S): Advances in biopsy and diagnostic techniques which increase the number of unaffected embryos identified may improve live birth rates for patients with NF1. Clinicians should counsel patients about their fertility and reproductive options early, with the use of disease-specific data, to set appropriate expectations for the PGD process.",,Vanessa L Merker; Timothy P Murphy; J Bryan Hughes; Alona Muzikansky; Mark R Hughes; Irene Souter; Scott R Plotkin,Fertility and sterility,2015-03,10.1016/j.fertnstert.2014.11.021,abstract_only,False
PMID:25012216,A neuronal function of the tumor suppressor protein merlin.,"Mutagenic loss of the NF2 tumor suppressor gene encoded protein merlin is known to provoke the hereditary neoplasia syndrome, Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). In addition to glial cell-derived tumors in the PNS and CNS, disease-related lesions also affect the skin and the eyes. Furthermore, 60% of NF2 patients suffer from peripheral nerve damage, clinically referred to as peripheral neuropathy. Strikingly, NF2-associated neuropathy often occurs in the absence of nerve damaging tumors, suggesting tumor-independent events. Recent findings indicate an important role of merlin in neuronal cell types concerning neuromorphogenesis, axon structure maintenance and communication between axons and Schwann cells. In this review, we compile clinical and experimental evidences for the underestimated role of the tumor suppressor merlin in the neuronal compartment.","Electrophysiological methods as a diagnostic tool for neuromuscular diseases Electrophysiological measurements are an indispensable tool for investigating the functional integrity of peripheral nerves in both the clinical and laboratory environment [ 58 ]. In humans, a large number of neuromuscular disorders and neuropathies diagnostically rely on electrophysiological measurements. By measuring nerve properties as conduction velocity or potential amplitudes of the signal, it is possible to characterize the origin of peripheral nerve diseases. The nerve conduction velocity is highly dependent on rapid signal propagation enabled by myelination. Therefore, demyelinating processes generally show decreased conduction velocities. When significantly reduced, the compound motor action potential (CMAP) – correlating with the number of functional axons – is an indicator for axonal damage. Hence, by means of electrophysiological methods, the etiology of peripheral nerve damage can be discriminated; such as for hereditary neuropathies, diabetic neuropathy, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathies (CIDP) or metabolic neuropathies.",Alexander Schulz; Ansgar Zoch; Helen Morrison,Acta neuropathologica communications,2014-07-12,10.1186/s40478-014-0082-1,minimal,True
PMID:21216928,Interpreting mammalian target of rapamycin and cell growth inhibition in a genetically engineered mouse model of Nf1-deficient astrocytes.,"The identification of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) as a major mediator of neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) tumor growth has led to the initiation of clinical trials using rapamycin analogs. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that durable responses to rapamycin treatment in a genetically engineered mouse model of Nf1 optic glioma require 20 mg/kg/day, whereas only transient tumor growth suppression was observed with 5 mg/kg/day rapamycin despite complete silencing of ribosomal S6 activity. To gain clinically relevant insights into the mechanism underlying this dose-dependent effect, we used Nf1-deficient glial cells in vitro and in vivo. First, there was an exponential relationship between blood and brain rapamycin levels. Second, we show that currently used biomarkers of mTOR pathway inhibition (phospho-S6, phospho-4EBP1, phospho-STAT3, and Jagged-1 levels) and tumor proliferation (Ki67) do not accurately reflect mTOR target inhibition or Nf1-deficient glial growth suppression. Third, the incomplete suppression of Nf1-deficient glial cell proliferation in vivo following 5 mg/kg/day rapamycin treatment reflects mTOR-mediated AKT activation, such that combined 5 mg/kg/day rapamycin and PI3-kinase (PI3K) inhibition or dual PI3K/mTOR inhibition recapitulates the growth suppressive effects of 20 mg/kg/day rapamycin. These new findings argue for the identification of more accurate biomarkers for rapamycin treatment response and provide reference preclinical data for comparing human rapamycin levels with target effects in the brain.","Materials and Methods Mice Five-six week-old  Nf1 GFAP CKO mice ( Nf1 flox/flox ; GFAP-Cre) were used. These mice lack  Nf1  gene expression in GFAP+ (glial) cells, and were generated by successive intercrossing of  Nf1 flox/flox  and  Nf1 flox/wt ; GFAP-Cre mice as previously described ( 6 ). All mice were used in accordance with established and approved animal studies protocols at the Washington University School of Medicine. Mice were maintained on an inbred C57BI/6 background. mTOR inhibitor (rapamycin) treatment  in vivo Rapamycin (LC Laboratories, Woburn MA) was administered at the indicated doses (2 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, or 20mg/kg) by daily intraperitoneal (i.p) injections of rapamycin dissolved in ethanol (5 days per week for 2 weeks total). Vehicle-treated mice received daily injections of an identical solution lacking rapamycin. At least five mice were included in each treatment group. After the final injection, mice were euthanized. Blood samples were collected for rapamycin concentration determination, and then the mice were perfused with ice-cold normal saline. Brains were dissected and half of the brain was kept at −80°C to measure brain rapamycin concentrations. The remaining brain was divided into two parts for Western blotting and vibratome sectioning for Ki67 determinations. Measurement of blood and brain rapamycin levels Calibrators and quality controls were prepared by spiking known amounts of Sirolimus into blank EDTA mouse blood or homogenized mouse brain tissue (Bioreclamation, Hicksville, NY). Sirolimus and the internal standard sirolimus-d3 were from Toronto Research Chemicals (North York, ON). Samples were extracted and analyzed using a modification of an online extraction liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/LC-MS/MS) assay previously described for the analysis of zotarolimus in blood and tissues ( 20 ). Mouse brains were weighed, HPLC-grade water was added (1:3) [w/v] and tissues were homogenized. For protein precipitation of 100 μL brain homogenates or 100 μL EDTA blood, 400 μL of ZnSO 4 .7H 2 O (17.28g/L) in 30:70 (v/v) HPLC grade water / HPLC grade methanol containing the internal standard sirolimus-d3 (5 ng/mL) was added. Samples were vortexed for 2.5 minutes at room temperature and centrifuged at 13,000·g for 8 minutes at 4°C using a bench-top microfuge. The supernatant was transferred into 2 mL HPLC autosampler glass vials and 100 μL was injected into the LC/LC-MS/MS system (HPLC Agilent 1100 Series, Applied Biosystems/Sciex API 4000). HPLC I was used for on-line sample extraction, HPLC II for sample analysis and both were connected  via  a 6-port switching valve ( 20 ). For on-line sample clean-up, an extraction column (4.6 × 12.5 mm, 5μm, Eclipse XDB-C8, Agilent) was used and samples were washed using 20% HPLC grade methanol / 80% HPLC grade water + 0.1% formic acid delivered at a flow rate of 5mL/min for 1min. The analytes were then back-flushed onto a C8 analytical column (4.6 × 150 mm, 5μm, Zorbax XDB -C8, Agilent) that was kept at 65°C. The following gradient was run: 87% methanol/ 13% 0.1% formic acid to 100% methanol within 2.0 min and then 100% methanol for an additional 1.5 min. The flow rate was 1mL/min. The mass spectrometer was run in the positive MRM (multiple reaction monitoring) mode. The de-solvation gas was heated to 600°C, the declustering potential (DP) was set to 160 V and the collision energy (CE) to 77eV. The following ion transitions were monitored: m/z= 936.5→ 409.3 for sirolimus [M+Na + ] and m/z 939.5→ 409.3 for the internal standard sirolimus-d3 [M+Na + ]. The lower limit of quantitation in mouse brain tissue was 2μg/g and in EDTA blood 0.5ng/mL. The range of reliable response was 2–1000 μg/g and 1– 5000 ng/mL, respectively (r>0.99). The interday accuracy was between 85–115% and total imprecision <15%. No relevant carry-over, matrix interferences and ion suppression/ ion enhancement were detected. Cell lines The mouse K4622 grade II glioma cell line was derived from a C57Bl/6  Nf1 +/−;  p53 +/− mouse and was shown to be both  Nf1 - and  p53 -deficient ( 21 ). These cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagles' Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% Pen-Strep. Pharmacologic inhibitors Rapamycin (LC Laboratories, catalog number R-5000;  Supplementary Fig. S1A ), NVP-BEZ235 (LC Laboratories, catalog number 915019-65-7;  Supplementary Fig. S1B ), and LY294002 (Calbiochem, San Diego CA) were purchased from commercial sources.  In vitro  treatments were for 16–18h unless otherwise indicated. Experiments were performed at least three times with identical results. Cell proliferation K4622 mouse glioma cells were plated (10,000 cells per well) in 24-well dishes and allowed to adhere for 24 h followed by treatment with rapamycin, NVP-BEZ235, or LY294002 at the indicated concentrations. Cells were exposed to [ 3 H]-thymidine (1 μCi/mL) for 4h. All assays were performed thrice with identical results ( 18 ,  21 ). Immunohistochemistry Brain tissues from rapamycin-treated or vehicle-treated mice were post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Following sectioning on a vibratome, immunostaining with Ki67 (BD PharMingen, Pasadena CA) antibodies was performed as previously described ( 6 ). The number of Ki-67–immunoreactive cells in the dentate gyrus was quantified by direct counting on three consecutive sections from each mouse. Western Blotting Brain tissues were harvested in NP-40 lysis buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors and homogenized by mechanical disruption. K4622 cells were lysed in standard NP-40 lysis buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Western blotting was performed as previously described ( 22 ). All antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MD) and used at a 1:1,000 dilution unless otherwise stated. Primary phospho-histone-H3 (Ser 10 ) antibody was purchased from Abcam, Inc. Following horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) incubation, detection was accomplished by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, Pittsburgh, PA). Densitometry analysis was performed with Gel-Pro Analyzer 4.0 software (Media Cybernetics; Silver Spring, MD) using α-tubulin (Sigma, St. Louis MO), β-actin or non-phospho-STAT3, AKT, S6, and 4EBP1 antibodies for normalization. Statistical analysis The measures of all biomarkers were summarized using the mean and standard error of mean (SEM). The raw data were checked graphically and data transformation was performed as necessary. The relationship between blood and brain rapamycin concentrations was described by linear regression analysis. For each biomarker, the differences of means among rapamycin dose levels were compared using 1-way ANOVA, followed by post-hoc tests to compare individual treatment conditions to the wild-type or untreated group. To control the family-wise false-positive rate at the designed 0.05 level, however, such post-hoc comparisons were conducted only if the overall difference in ANOVA was significant. All the analyses were implemented by the comprehensive statistical package R ( http://cran.r-project.org/ ) and p values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.",Sutapa Banerjee; Scott M Gianino; Feng Gao; Uwe Christians; David H Gutmann,Molecular cancer therapeutics,2011-02,10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-0654,minimal,True
PMID:24925884,Correlation between in vivo 18F-FDG PET and immunohistochemical markers of glucose uptake and metabolism in pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma.,"UNLABELLED: Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) can be localized by (18)F-FDG PET. The uptake is particularly high in tumors with an underlying succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) mutation. SDHx-related PPGLs are characterized by compromised oxidative phosphorylation and a pseudohypoxic response, which mediates an increase in aerobic glycolysis, also known as the Warburg effect. The aim of this study was to explore the hypothesis that increased uptake of (18)F-FDG in SDHx-related PPGLs is reflective of increased glycolytic activity and is correlated with expression of different proteins involved in glucose uptake and metabolism through the glycolytic pathway. METHODS: Twenty-seven PPGLs collected from patients with hereditary mutations in SDHB (n = 2), SDHD (n = 3), RET (n = 5), neurofibromatosis 1 (n = 1), and myc-associated factor X (n = 1) and sporadic patients (n = 15) were investigated. Preoperative (18)F-FDG PET/CT studies were analyzed; mean and maximum standardized uptake values (SUVs) in manually drawn regions of interest were calculated. The expression of proteins involved in glucose uptake (glucose transporters types 1 and 3 [GLUT-1 and -3, respectively]), phosphorylation (hexokinases 1, 2, and 3 [HK-1, -2, and -3, respectively]), glycolysis (monocarboxylate transporter type 4 [MCT-4]), and angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], CD34) were examined in paraffin-embedded tumor tissues using immunohistochemical staining with peroxidase-catalyzed polymerization of diaminobenzidine as a read-out. The expression was correlated with corresponding SUVs. RESULTS: Both maximum and mean SUVs for SDHx-related tumors were significantly higher than those for sporadic and other hereditary tumors (P < 0.01). The expression of HK-2 and HK-3 was significantly higher in SDHx-related PPGLs than in sporadic PPGLs (P = 0.022 and 0.025, respectively). The expression of HK-2 and VEGF was significantly higher in SDHx-related PPGLs than in other hereditary PPGLs (P = 0.039 and 0.008, respectively). No statistical differences in the expression were observed for GLUT-1, GLUT-3, and MCT-4. The percentage anti-CD 34 staining and mean vessel perimeter were significantly higher in SDHx-related PPGLs than in sporadic tumors (P = 0.050 and 0.010, respectively). Mean SUVs significantly correlated with the expression of HK-2 (P = 0.027), HK-3 (P = 0.013), VEGF (P = 0.049), and MCT-4 (P = 0.020). CONCLUSION: The activation of aerobic glycolysis in SDHx-related PPGLs is associated with increased (18)F-FDG accumulation due to accelerated glucose phosphorylation by hexokinases rather than increased expression of glucose transporters.",,Anouk van Berkel; Jyotsna U Rao; Benno Kusters; Tuna Demir; Eric Visser; Arjen R Mensenkamp; Jeroen A W M van der Laak; Egbert Oosterwijk; Jacques W M Lenders; Fred C G J Sweep; Ron A Wevers; Ad R Hermus; Johan F Langenhuijsen; Dirk P M Kunst; Karel Pacak; Martin Gotthardt; Henri J L M Timmers,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",2014-08,10.2967/jnumed.114.137034,abstract_only,False
PMID:25917366,HCN channels are a novel therapeutic target for cognitive dysfunction in Neurofibromatosis type 1.,"Cognitive impairments are a major clinical feature of the common neurogenetic disease neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Previous studies have demonstrated that increased neuronal inhibition underlies the learning deficits in NF1, however, the molecular mechanism underlying this cell-type specificity has remained unknown. Here, we identify an interneuron-specific attenuation of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) current as the cause for increased inhibition in Nf1 mutants. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that HCN1 is a novel NF1-interacting protein for which loss of NF1 results in a concomitant increase of interneuron excitability. Furthermore, the HCN channel agonist lamotrigine rescued the electrophysiological and cognitive deficits in two independent Nf1 mouse models, thereby establishing the importance of HCN channel dysfunction in NF1. Together, our results provide detailed mechanistic insights into the pathophysiology of NF1-associated cognitive defects, and identify a novel target for clinical drug development.","MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals Experimental mice were obtained by crossing  Nf1  mice (in C57BL/6JOlaHsd background) with 129T2/SvEmsJ (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) by crossing the obtained F1 mutant mice with each other to get homozygous  9a−/9a+ Nf1  mutants and wild-type (WT) littermates in the hybrid B6/129T2 background, comparable to that of previous studies in NF1. Homozygous  9a−/9a− Nf1  mice were born at the expected Mendelian frequency, and were indistinguishable from WT mice upon examination by an experienced observer. Male  9a−/9a− Nf1  mice (C57BL/6JOlaHsd, >30 generations) were crossed once with WT 129T2/SvEmsJ mice (Jackson Laboratories) to obtain F1 hybrid B6/129T2 heterozygous mutant and WT control mice.  +/− H-Ras  mice in C57BL/6JOlaHsd background were obtained by crossing heterozygous  G12V H-Ras  mice to yield homozygous  G12V H-Ras  mice and WT control mice. For all experiments, we used both male and female mice. All mice were between 8 and 15 weeks of age at the start of the behavioral experiments, housed in groups of 2–4 per cage, on a 12-h light/dark cycle between 0700 and 1900 hours, and fed standard laboratory food  G12V ad libitum . All included animals were healthy (discomfort score 0). Behavioral experiments were performed between 1200 and 1800 hours. For  ex-vivo  experiments, mice were killed between 0900 and 1200 hours. Experimenters were blind for genotype and treatment. All experiments were approved by the Dutch Ethical Committee and were in accordance with the institutional animal care and use committee guidelines. Slice electrophysiology Hippocampal slices were prepared from the brains of 3- to 4-week-old and adult mice using standard techniques. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were evoked in CA3-CA1 synapses and whole-cell patch-clamp recording were performed from hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons and interneurons. For interneurons recordings, 0.2% biocytin was included in the intracellular pipette solution for later morphological identification of the recorded cells. Standard protocols were followed for recording and data analysis. For additional information, see  Supplementary Materials and Methods . Morris water maze The water maze task was performed as previously described.  Before performing the water maze task, the mice were handled for a week. For initial characterization of  27 Nf1  mice, training consisted of 4 trials per day, divided in two sessions of two trials with a 1 h interval ( 9a−/9a− Figure 1 ) or two trials per day for LTG-treated mice. At the start of the first session the mice were placed on the platform for 30 s. Then they were placed in the water at a pseudo-random start position and allowed to find the platform for 60 s. If the mice did not find the platform within 60 s, it was placed onto the platform and allowed to remain on it for 30 s. The platform position remained at the same position during all trials. Spatial memory was assessed with a probe trial given 1–2 h ( Figure 1d ) or 22–24 h after the last training trial ( Figure 5 ), when the majority of the mice was able to locate the platform in less than 30 s (after 3 training days for mice in  Figure 1d  and  5e  and after 5 training days for  Figure 5d ). During probe trials mice were placed on the platform for 30 s, after which the platform was removed from the pool and the mice were placed in the pool at the opposite side of the previous platform position. The mice were then allowed to search for the platform for 60 s. The visible water maze was performed with a new group of mice. After the handling period, mice were trained in the pool to find the escape platform which was flagged with a small cue on the top of the platform. The platform location and the start position were changed on every trial and each mouse received four trials per day for 8 consecutive days. Mice were excluded from further analysis if they showed excessive (>20%) floating (throughout the training or at the probe trial itself), or would not stay on the platform after training day 2. With respect to exclusion criteria, no differences between genotypes were observed (typically 1–2 mice per genotype are excluded). Rotarod Motor learning was assessed with the accelerating rotarod (Ugo Basile, Comerio Varese, Italy) as previously described.  Each animal was placed on a 3-cm diameter cylinder, accelerated from 4 to 40 r.p.m. for maximum 5 min. All animals were given five trials during one day, with an inter-trial interval of 45 min. The latency time to fall was measured in seconds. 5 Statistical analysis All data are reported as means ± s.e.m. Cumulative miniature and spontaneous synaptic currents amplitude and inter-event interval distributions were analyzed for statistical significance using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (Mini Analysis), and a conservative critical probability level of  P  < 0.01. All other statistical tests, including  t -tests and one- or two-way analysis of variance, were performed using a critical probability of  P  < 0.05 and two-sided testing (Prism, GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA and SPSS, IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA).  Post hoc  analyses were performed only when an analysis of variance yielded a significant ( P  < 0.05) main effect.",A Omrani; T van der Vaart; E Mientjes; G M van Woerden; M R Hojjati; K W Li; D H Gutmann; C N Levelt; A B Smit; A J Silva; S A Kushner; Y Elgersma,Molecular psychiatry,2015-11,10.1038/mp.2015.48,minimal,True
PMID:32419643,Long Noncoding RNA WT1-AS Inhibit Cell Malignancy via miR-494-3p in Glioma.,"Primary brain tumors are a rare occurrence in comparison to other malignancies, the most predominant form being glioma. Commonly, exposure to ionizing radiations and inheritance of associated conditions such a neurofibromatosis and tuberous sclerosis are the most common causes of development of glioma. However, understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive glioma development is limited. We explore the role of aberration of microRNA namely ","Methods and Materials Study Setting and Sample Collection The study was undertaken at the Shanghai Fourth People’s Hospital Affiliated to Tongji University School of Medicine post approval of the institutional ethics committee (approval no. 2019tjdx16). Written consents were obtained from all participants. Patients reporting to the Department of Neurosurgery were clinically examined and histopathologically confirmed for the presence of glioma as per the criteria laid down by the World Health Organization. Through an informed consent, we randomly selected 50 glioma patients slated for surgery with no previous exposure to either chemo or radiotherapy for this study. Selected glioma specimens were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and preserved at −80°C till further use. Cell Lines, Maintenance, Transfections, and Chemoresistance Primary normal human astrocytes (M059J) and 4 glioma cell lines (U87, U118, U251, and A172) were commercially procured from Shanghai Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). As per the handler instructions, all cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and a mixture of penicillin/streptomycin (100 U/mL). Cells were maintained at 37°C in humidified 5% carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) environment. Transfections were mediated as per the manufacturer’s instruction for lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The human lncRNA WT1-AS were cloned into plasmid cloning DNA (pcDNA) vector. The plasmid or miRNA were transfected into glioma cell lines namely U87 or U118. The cell lines were cultured in 6-well cell culture dishes and allowed to reach a confluency of 80% prior to transfection. The transfected cells were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO 2  incubator. The medium was replenished 14-hour posttransfection. The chemoresistance studies were undertaken in the presence of temozolomide (TMZ) commercially procured from Sigma. A 5 mg/mL stock of TMZ was prepared by dissolving in dimethyl sulphoxide. RNA Extraction and Quantitative Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Analysis Total cellular RNA was extracted from glioma tissues and cultured cells using the commercially procured TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA was reverse transcribed in to complementary DNA (cDNA) using the commercial Transcriptor First strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Indiana). The quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was undertaken using the commercial SYBR premix Extaq II kit (Takara Inc, Dalian, China). mirVana qRTPCR miRNA detection kit (Ambion, Austin, Texas) were used to detect WT1-AS and miR-494-3p expression. All results are expressed as relative change in gene expression calculated using (2 −▵▵Ct ), the method of Livak and Schmittgen using glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and U6 as housekeeping controls, respectively. 
 16 Cell Proliferation Assays Two assays, namely cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8) and 5′-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) assays were employed for estimating influence on cell proliferation. Commercial kits were procured from Dojindo Molecular Technologies (CCK-8 kit, Shanghai, China) and Ribobio (EdU assay kit, Guangzhou, China). Briefly, for the CCK-8 assay, cells were seeded in a 96-well plate and cultured at 37°C in a 5% CO 2  incubator. Cells were treated with 10 µL of CCK-8 solution and reincubated at the aforementioned conditions for 2 hours. Postincubation, absorbance was measured at 450 nm. Rate of proliferation was measured on days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 posttransfection. Similarly, for the EdU assay, cells were dissociated and plated onto glass bottom dishes with DMEM and 50 µL EdU for 2 hours at 37°C. The medium was washed and cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes. Post washing, cells were incubated for 30 minutes in an Apollo reaction cocktail (RiboBio) constituting of reaction buffer and Apollo 643 at room temperature. The cells were counterstained with Hoechst 33342. Using a laser scanning confocal microscope, cells were counted for EdU positive (red) and Hoechst positive (blue). Proliferation rate was computed as a ratio of EdU to Hoechst 33342 positive cells. Migration and Invasion Commercially available migration and invasion inserts for a 24-well plate was used for the assay. For invasion assays, Post transfection, 50 000 cells resuspended in 100 µL medium supplemented with 1% FBS were added to the upper chamber of the insert. The lower chamber contained DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. The plates were incubated in a humidified 5% CO 2  incubator for 12 hours. For migration assays, the inserts did not bear a Matrigel precoating, rest of the set-up remaining identical; cells were incubated for 24 hours. For both experimental set-up’s, noninvading cells were removed with cotton swabs. The lower surfaces of the inserts, bearing the invasive cells, were fixed in 100% methanol at room temperature for 30 minutes and stained using 0.1% crystal violet dye (Sigma Inc, St. Louis, MO, USA). The proportion of invasive cells was enumerated using microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Western Blot Protein lysates were collected from cell lines and their concentrations were estimated using bicinchonic acid protein assay kit (Beyotime Biotec, Beijing, China). The samples were separated using an 8% to 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The membrane was blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline and Tween 20. The membranes were incubated with antibodies against p-AKT, total AKT, and β-Actin (SantaCruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, USA). The blots were developed using electrochemiluminescence. RNA Immunoprecipitation Assay As per manufacturer’s instruction (Magna RIP, Millipore), RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay was undertaken in U87 and U118. Cells were lysed in complete RIP lysis buffer. Bound RNA and protein of interest is immunoprecipitated using the Ago2 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA) at a dilution of 1:50. Quantitative real-time PCR was used for analyses of the level of coprecipitated RNA. Luciferase Reporter Assay The WT1-AS sequence including the putative binding sites of miR-494-3p was subcloned and then inserted into the pmirGLO vector (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin) to generate wide-type WT1-AS (WT1-AS-WT) and mutant WT1-AS (WT1-AS-MUT) vectors. Cell lines, U87MG and U118, were seeded into 96-well plates and then cotransfected using lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) with the designed vectors and miR-494-3p or miR normal control. Twenty-four hours post transfection, the luciferase activity was detected by dual luciferase assay (Promega) and normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. Statistical Analysis All experiments were undertaken in triplicates and data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Significance of difference in means between 2 or 3 groups was evaluated using a 2-tailed Student  t  test or 1-way analysis of variance. A  P  value <.05 was considered statistically significant.

PMID:34049498,Early differences in auditory processing relate to Autism Spectrum Disorder traits in infants with Neurofibromatosis Type I.,"BACKGROUND: Sensory modulation difficulties are common in children with conditions such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and could contribute to other social and non-social symptoms. Positing a causal role for sensory processing differences requires observing atypical sensory reactivity prior to the emergence of other symptoms, which can be achieved through prospective studies. METHODS: In this longitudinal study, we examined auditory repetition suppression and change detection at 5 and 10 months in infants with and without Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1), a condition associated with higher likelihood of developing ASD. RESULTS: In typically developing infants, suppression to vowel repetition and enhanced responses to vowel/pitch change decreased with age over posterior regions, becoming more frontally specific; age-related change was diminished in the NF1 group. Whilst both groups detected changes in vowel and pitch, the NF1 group were largely slower to show a differentiated neural response. Auditory responses did not relate to later language, but were related to later ASD traits. CONCLUSIONS: These findings represent the first demonstration of atypical brain responses to sounds in infants with NF1 and suggest they may relate to the likelihood of later ASD.","Methods In this longitudinal study, we examined auditory repetition suppression and change detection at 5 and 10 months in infants with and without Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1), a condition associated with higher likelihood of developing ASD. Methods Participants We recruited 25 infants with NF1 and 52 typically developing (TD) infants into a longitudinal study running from 2013 to 2019. Some NF1 infants missed the 5-month entry point and entered at 10 months due to delays with families receiving the diagnosis (expert consultations take longer to be scheduled and attended). Infants were enrolled in the study if they either had Neurofibromatosis Type 1 or were typically developing. EEG was collected at 5 and 10 months, and a range of phenotypic measures were collected at a 14-month follow-up visit. We defined typical development (TD) as infants who had no first-degree relatives with a diagnosis of ASD or ADHD, with parents reporting no developmental concerns. These TD infants were recruited from a volunteer database at the Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London. Inclusion criteria included full-term birth (gestational age greater than 36 weeks). At the time of enrolment, none of the infants in this cohort had a known medical or developmental condition. Participants in our NF1 cohort were recruited through local medical and genetic centres. All participants had their diagnosis confirmed via molecular testing of cord blood samples or clinical diagnosis based on NIH consensus criteria [ 105 ] and had no other developmental concerns at the time of the visits. Informed written consent was provided by the parent(s) prior to the commencement of the study. The testing only took place if the infants were in a content and alert state. Ethical approval was granted by the National Research Ethics Service and the Research Ethics Committee of the Department of Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London. Participant families were reimbursed expenses for travel, subsistence and overnight stay if required. Infants were given a certificate and t-shirt after each visit. A number of infants were excluded from the final EEG analyses for fussy behaviour ( n  = 15 and 3 at the 5- and 10-month time points respectively), noisy data ( n  = 4 and 4 at the 5- and 10-month time points respectively) or technical difficulties with the EEG protocol ( n  = 2 and 1 at the 5- and 10-month time points respectively) (see Fig.  1 a and Table  1  for the final participant numbers and demographic breakdown by group at each time point).

Each train was composed of four consecutive 50-ms sounds with a 5-ms rise and fall time (Fig.  1 b). The first three sounds in each train were repeated standards, and the fourth was a deviant. Standard sounds were all a /u/ vowel sound administered at 500 Hz. Deviants were either a Deviant Pitch (/U/ sound administered at 650 Hz) or Deviant Vowel sound (/i/ sound administered at 500 Hz) with 50% probability each. The inter-stimulus interval (ISI) was jittered at ~ 500 ms, and the inter-train interval was a random 3000–4000 ms. The sound intensity was 70dBA SPL. The sounds were presented for between 7 and 10 min, or until the infant became restless. Procedure The auditory trains task was administered at the end of a battery of visual EEG tasks (not reported here). Infants were seated on their parents’/caregiver’s lap facing an experimenter. All testing took place in a sound-attenuated and electrically shielded room. Stimuli were presented via two speakers located behind a screen, placed 1 metre apart and approximately 1 metre away from the infant. Infants engaged in silent play (toys and/or bubbles) with a researcher. The task was still administered if infants fell asleep during any part of the EEG protocol ( n  = 2 for the NF1 group), as this does not affect the strength of the responses observed [ 21 ,  71 ]. Fussy behaviour Fussy behaviour is defined as excessive motion, behavioural signs of negative affect and avoidance behaviour that indicates the child is not enjoying participating in the experiment. Significant fussiness typically leads to poor quality or missing data. To maximise cross-researcher standardisation in responses to fussiness, we agreed a hierarchy of responses to maximise both data yield and participant comfort. Before the experiment, researchers asked parents to maximise their baby’s comfort by ensuring they were warm, fed, changed and seated comfortably. During the experiment, if a baby showed signs of fussiness (e.g. began to move more, show negative facial expressions, turn away from the stimuli) experimenters first addressed possible boredom by engaging the baby with a variety of silent toys (e.g. blowing bubbles). If fussiness continued, the parent was instructed to try (in this order) cuddling; holding hands; give baby something boring to hold (like a plastic teething ring); give baby a pacifier or snack; if all that did not work, a break was taken. If the parent wished to try again after the baby had calmed down, the experiment was resumed. Behavioural measures Mullen Scales of Early Learning The Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) [ 77 ] is a standardised measure that assesses developmental ability across five domains: Gross Motor, Visual Reception, Fine Motor, Receptive Language and Expressive Language. The MSEL was administered at all time points by trained researchers in the STAARS team. We used raw scores for subdomains to examine relations with neural activity; 1  we present standard scores for overall developmental level for descriptive cohort comparisons. Autism Observation Score for Infants The Autism Observation Score for Infants (AOSI) [ 11 ] is a standardised research assessment that examines ASD traits in infants in the first two years of life. The measure involves a semi-structured play session between a researcher and the infant, examining such factors as social-communicative development, atypical sensorimotor behaviours and repetitive behaviours). Higher scores on this measure indicate greater ASD traits. Trained researchers administered the AOSI with our NF1 cohort at a follow-up 14-month time point. Infant Behaviour Questionnaire-Revised To measure ADHD-related early behaviours, we used the Activity Level subscale of the Infant Behaviour Questionnaire-Revised [ 89 ]. Previous work has shown this subscale to show a reasonable predictive relationship with later ADHD traits [ 102 ]. Parents completed the Infant Behaviour Questionnaire-Revised (IBQ-R) at a 14 month follow-up time point. The IBQ-R is a parent-report questionnaire consisting of 191 items and 14 scales that relate to different aspects of infant temperament. On a 7-point Likert scale, parents rated infant’s behaviours from “Never” to “Always”. Items are summed to produce a raw score for different subscales, any infants that had more than 20% missing data (including instances where parents reported “not applicable”) were not included in the final analyses for the subscale. MacArthur Bates Communicative Development Inventory Parents completed the MacArthur Bates Communicative Development Inventory (CDI) long form [ 31 ] at a follow-up 14-month time point. The CDI measures early language abilities by assessing vocabulary comprehension and expression, use of gestures and grammar. The questionnaire is comprised of approximately 800 items on a 1–3-point scale, with parents indicating whether their child can understand/understand and say certain words/complete certain gestures. Item scores can then be summed to produce a “Comprehension” score and an “Expression” score. Language scores We computed composite scores across the MSEL and CDI measures for “Language Comprehension” and “Language Production” separately. We chose to form composite scores such that each encompassed both parent report and observational measures, giving a more comprehensive assessment of the two language domains. This also reduces the issue of multiple comparisons that are raised when correlating with different subtests that are designed to measure the same skill set. To compute the Language Comprehension composite score, the raw scores from the Receptive Language subscale of the MSEL and the sum of ‘Words Understood’ from the CDI were normalised ( z -scored) based on subtracting the mean and then dividing by the standard deviation of the TD group. The resulting  z -scores for the Receptive Language and CDI scales were then averaged together to produce the ‘Language Comprehension’ composite. The ‘Language Production’ composite score was calculated in the same way, but using the Expressive Language subscale of the MSEL and the sum of the total of ‘Words Understands and Says’ on the CDI. These scores were calculated from a follow-up visit at 14 months of age (see Table  S1  for participant characteristics and individual subsets of scores). EEG processing We recorded EEG data with an EGI (Philips Neuro, Oregon, USA) 128-electrode Hydrocel Sensor Net, with the vertex electrode (approximate position of Cz in 10–20 co-ordinate system) acting as a reference online and the data sampled at 500 Hz. We applied a 0.1–30-Hz bandpass filter offline. We segmented trials (representing the neural response to one sound within a train) 100 ms before and 800 ms after stimulus onset (Standard 1, Standard 2, Standard 3, Deviant Pitch and Deviant Vowel). We visually inspected EEG data for artefacts at a single-trial level. Segments with pronounced artefacts such as gross motor movement, eye blinks and/or more than 25 bad channels (before interpolation) were excluded from the analysis. Infants with fewer than 10 trials in any condition were excluded from any analyses involving that condition (see Table  2  for the final average number of presented and retained trials after artefact detection across age and groups). Within the remaining segments, channels marked as having a noisy signal were interpolated with a clean signal from neighbouring channels using spline interpolation. Following this, the data was baseline corrected (− 100 ms to 0 ms, relative to sound onset), re-referenced to the average of all electrodes and averaged across trials (see Fig.  1 c for electrodes chosen for analyses). A proportion of the NF1 group were presented with a longer version of the paradigm. As such, we truncated our pre-processing and analyses to the first ~ 120 trials for Standards 1, 2 and 3 and the first ~ 65 trials for Deviant Pitch and Vowel.

Within each analysis, we examined both differences in the mean amplitude of the ERP waveform across 50-ms time windows (Analysis Type 1: Mean amplitude ERP analysis) and the onset of significant differences in the ERP waveform (Analysis Type 2: Autocorrelation analyses). Analysis 1: Mean amplitude ERP analysis Within each key question, separate linear mixed models (LMMs) with the following dependent variables were run: “Standard 1”, “Standard 1-Standard 2”, “Standard 2-Deviant Pitch”, “Standard 2-Deviant Vowel” and “Deviant Pitch-Deviant Vowel” for both the frontal and posterior regions analysed separately (because of the opposite polarity of waveforms). In order to examine effects of further subsequent repetition, we also conducted analyses for “Standard 2-Standard 3” (see SM1). All LMMs used the following fixed factors: Age (5 months, 10 months), Group (typical likelihood, NF1), site (left, central, right) and Time (100–150 ms, 150–200 ms, 200–250 ms, 250–300 ms, 300–350 ms, 350–400 ms, 400–450 ms, 450–500 ms). The repeated covariance type was set as “compound symmetry” and the maximum likelihood estimate was used for each model (see Table  S3  for a summary of significant results). Analysis 2: Autocorrelation analysis Autocorrelation analyses allow us to examine the exact time at which neural responses to two different conditions begin to significantly differ from each other. Whereas more traditional ERP analyses focus on differences across a previously specified time window (typically as a result of top down hypotheses) or require selection of a peak (often less clearly apparent in infant data), autocorrelation analyses allow for more data-driven estimates of the onset of condition differences. For this autocorrelation analysis, we compared ERP responses within the condition contrasts b) to e) outlined above using paired  t -tests at each sample point (2ms intervals) in the first 500ms post-sound-onset. We corrected for the autocorrelation of consecutive sample points using a Monte Carlo simulation approach [ 47 ,  74 ]. This method estimated the average first-order autocorrelation (set at lag 1 and was .98 for all datasets analysed) present in the real difference waveforms of our experimental conditions. Following this, the method produced 1000 datasets of randomly generated waveforms. Each simulated difference waveform had a mean and unit variance of zero at each time point, but the same level of autocorrelation as seen on average in the observed data. Each simulated dataset also had the same number of participants and time samples as in the real data. We then applied two-tailed one-sample  t -tests (vs. zero; alpha = .05, uncorrected) to the simulated waveforms at each time point, recording significant vs. non-significant outcomes. In each of the 1000 simulations, the longest sequence of consecutive significant  t -test outcomes was computed. The 95th percentile of that simulated distribution of “longest sequence lengths” was then used to determine a significant difference waveform in the real data; specifically, we noted any sequences of significant  t -tests that exceeded this 95th percentile in the real data. This method thus avoids the difficulties associated with multiple comparisons and preserves the type I error rate at .05 for each difference waveform analysed. Due to the constraints of the statistical assumptions of  t -tests, we were restricted to comparing each age group separately (as not all participants would have data for both the 5 and 10-month time points). We collapsed across site (left, central, right) and analysed separately by region (frontal, posterior) (see Table  S4  for a summary of significant results). We also conducted control analyses where each Group had the same number of participants (see SM2), with relatively similar results as those presented below. Relationship with later development In order to examine relationships between auditory processing and later development, we first needed to reduce the current number of variables (so as to streamline the number of correlations). To do this, we conducted a factor analysis on the primary variables of interest from the auditory processing task (Standard 1, Standard 1-Standard 2, Standard 2-Deviant Pitch and Standard 2-Deviant Vowel; mean amplitudes averaged over 100–500 ms and over left, central and right areas; frontal and posterior separate for each condition; both age points entered together). We used the principle components method, with a direct oblimin rotation given the relatedness of the variables. Two components were extracted (both eigenvalues > 1) that were consistent with responses to deviant stimuli, and the Initial Response/Change to the Standards. The deviant stimuli response factor was comprised of Standard 2-Deviant Pitch and Standard 2-Deviant Vowel (both frontal and posterior), factor loadings of -.74 to .84 and explaining 43% of the variance. The Initial Response/Change to the Standards factor was comprised of Standard 1 and Standard 1-Standard 2 (both frontal and posterior), with factor loadings of -.56 to .9 and explaining 24% of the variance; positive factor loadings represent frontal variables and negative factor loadings denote posterior variable. Of note, this same factor structure was obtained if the two age points were examined separately (see SM3). We then used the factor scores at the level of each individual in a number of correlation analyses that investigated relationships with language development and ASD and ADHD traits. We measured infants’ language skills on two measures: the MSEL [ 77 ] and the MacArthur Bates Communicative Development Index (CDI) long form [ 31 ] and used our composite scores of Language Comprehension and Language Production in later analyses. Data analysis methods Neural response analyses To address our key questions, we examined (a) overall responses to the first standard as a measure of basic auditory processing; (b) changes in response between the first and second standard as a measure of repetition suppression; and (c) changes in response between the second standard and the Deviant Pitch/Vowel category as a measure of change detection; finally, we examined (d) the difference in neural responses to the pitch change and vowel category deviants as a measure of auditory discrimination.

PMID:24470552,Treatment of orthotopic malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors with oncolytic herpes simplex virus.,"BACKGROUNDS: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are an aggressive and often lethal sarcoma that frequently develops in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). We developed new preclinical MPNST models and tested the efficacy of oncolytic herpes simplex viruses (oHSVs), a promising cancer therapeutic that selectively replicates in and kills cancer cells. METHODS: Mouse NF1(-) MPNST cell lines and human NF1(-) MPNST stemlike cells (MSLCs) were implanted into the sciatic nerves of immunocompetent and athymic mice, respectively. Tumor growth was followed by external measurement and sciatic nerve deficit using a hind-limb scoring system. Oncolytic HSV G47Δ as well as ""armed"" G47Δ expressing platelet factor 4 (PF4) or interleukin (IL)-12 were injected intratumorally into established sciatic nerve tumors. RESULTS: Mouse MPNST cell lines formed tumors with varying growth kinetics. A single intratumoral injection of G47Δ in sciatic nerve tumors derived from human S462 MSLCs in athymic mice or mouse M2 (37-3-18-4) cells in immunocompetent mice significantly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival. Local IL-12 expression significantly improved the efficacy of G47Δ in syngeneic mice, while PF4 expression prolonged survival. Injection of G47Δ directly into the sciatic nerve of athymic mice resulted in only mild symptoms that did not differ from phosphate buffered saline control. CONCLUSIONS: Two new orthotopic MPNST models are described, including in syngeneic mice, expanding the options for preclinical testing. Oncolytic HSV G47Δ exhibited robust efficacy in both immunodeficient and immunocompetent MPNST models while maintaining safety. Interleukin-12 expression improved efficacy. These studies support the clinical translation of G47Δ for patients with MPNST.",,Slawomir Antoszczyk; Melanie Spyra; Victor Felix Mautner; Andreas Kurtz; Anat O Stemmer-Rachamimov; Robert L Martuza; Samuel D Rabkin,Neuro-oncology,2014-08,10.1093/neuonc/not317,abstract_only,False
PMID:1427886,A radiation hybrid map of the region on human chromosome 22 containing the neurofibromatosis type 2 locus.,"We describe a high-resolution radiation hybrid map of the region on human chromosome 22 containing the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) gene. Eighty-five hamster-human somatic cell hybrids generated by X-irradiation and cell fusion were used to generate the radiation hybrid map. The presence or absence of 18 human chromosome 22-specific markers was determined in each hybrid by using Southern blot hybridization. Sixteen of the 18 markers were distinguishable by X-ray breakage in the radiation hybrids. Analysis of these data using two different mathematical models and two different statistical methods resulted in a single framework map consisting of 8 markers ordered with odds greater than 1000:1. The remaining nonframework markers were all localized to regions consisting of two adjoining intervals on the framework map with odds greater than 1000:1. Based on the RH map, the NF2 region of chromosome 22, defined by the flanking markers D22S1 and D22S28, is estimated to span a physical distance of approximately 6 Mb and is the most likely location for 9 of the 18 markers studied: D22S33, D22S41, D22S42, D22S46, D22S56, LIF, D22S37, D22S44, and D22S15.",,K A Frazer; M Boehnke; M L Budarf; R K Wolff; B S Emanuel; R M Myers; D R Cox,Genomics,1992-11,10.1016/s0888-7543(05)80154-5,abstract_only,False
PMID:18445079,Altered adhesive structures and their relation to RhoGTPase activation in merlin-deficient Schwannoma.,"Schwannomas are Schwann cell tumors of the nervous system that occur spontaneously and in patients with neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) and lack the tumor suppressor merlin. Merlin is known to bind paxillin, beta1 integrin and focal adhesion kinase, members of focal contacts, multi-protein complexes that mediate cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Moreover, merlin-deficient Schwannomas show pathological adhesion to the extracellular matrix making the characterization of focal contacts indispensable. Using our Schwannoma in vitro model of human primary Schwann and Schwannoma cells, we here show that Schwannoma cells display an increased number of mature and stable focal contacts. In addition to an involvement of RhoA signaling via the Rho kinase ROCK, Rac1 plays a significant role in the pathological adhesion of Schwannoma cells. The Rac1 guanine exchange factor- beta-Pix, localizes to focal contacts in human primary Schwannoma cells, and we show that part of the Rac1 activation, an effect of merlin-deficiency, occurs at the level of focal contacts in human primary Schwannoma cells. Our results help explaining the pathological adhesion of Schwannoma cells, further strengthen the importance of RhoGTPase signaling in Schwannoma development, and suggest that merlin's role in tumor suppression is linked to focal contacts.",,Christine Flaiz; Sylwia Ammoun; Anja Biebl; C Oliver Hanemann,"Brain pathology (Zurich, Switzerland)",2009-01,10.1111/j.1750-3639.2008.00165.x,abstract_only,False
PMID:25340526,Nilotinib is more potent than imatinib for treating plexiform neurofibroma in vitro and in vivo.,"Plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) are benign nerve sheath tumors mostly associated with neurofibromatosis type 1. They often extend through multiple layers of tissue and therefore cannot be treated satisfactorily by surgery. Nilotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat leukemia, with advantages over the prototype imatinib in terms of potency and selectivity towards BCR-ABL, and the DDR, PDGFR, and KIT receptor kinases. In this study, we compared efficacies of the two drugs on cultured cells of PNF in vitro and on xenografted tumor fragments on sciatic nerve of athymic nude mice. Xenografts were monitored weekly using a high resolution ultrasound measurement. Treatment with nilotinib at a daily dose of 100 mg/kg for four weeks led to a reduction of the graft sizesstd by 68±7% in the 8 treated mice, significantly more than the 33±8% reduction in the 8 untreated mice (P<0.05) and the 47±15% in the 7 mice treated with imatinib (P<0.05). The peak plasma nilotinib concentration 6.6±1.1 µM is within the pharmacological range of clinical application. Imatinib, but not nilotinib significantly hindered body weight increase of the mice and elevated cytotoxicity of mouse spleen cells (P<0.05). Our results suggest that nilotinib may be more potent than imatinib for treating PNFs and may also be better tolerated. Imatinib seems to have some off-target effect in elevating immunity.","Materials and Methods Ethical approvals For the donation of human biological samples approval OB-061/05 by the Institutional Review Board of the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf; for animal studies approval Hamburg 112/11 by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Hamburg. Specimen and  in vitro  study The donor of the study specimen was a 12-year-old female NF1 patient, diagnosed according to the modified National Institutes of Health criteria  [18] . A parent of the patient gave informed written consent in addition to assent from the patient. The Institutional Review Board approved the study (OB-061/05). Her PNF was operated at the Department of Maxillofacial Surgery, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf. A part of the tumor was kept in Hanks buffered saline and delivered into the laboratory for cell culture and for xenografting. Schwann cells from the PNF were cultured and identified as previously described  [16] . After ensuring purity of 85%, PNF-derived Schwann cells were treated with nilotinib and imatinib (Novartis Pharma AG, Switzerland), each at 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 µM for 10 days. Cell proliferation and viability assays were performed as previously described  [16] . RNA expression comparison of PNF-segments To assess variability between PNF grafts, we performed RNA-sequencing from 4 pieces of the original tumor sample and from one unrelated PNF. RNA was isolated from snap-frozen tumors using Trizol. and mRNA was reverse transcribed using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen, Carlsabd, CA). Sequencing libraries were prepared using TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Sample Preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) Libraries were sequenced on a Genome Analyzer IIx (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Alignment and analysis was performed using a Galaxy server and open source Chipster  software  ( http://chipster.csc.fi/ )  as  well as R bioconductor ( http://www.bioconductor.org/ ) tools for calculating similarity clusters on a Galaxy server. Xenografting and treatment The care and use of laboratory animals were carried out in strict accordance with the local animal care and use committee's research council's guide (Approval No.: Hamburg 112/11). Athymic nude mice (female, nu/nu Balb/c, 6 weeks, 20 g) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Sulzfeld, Germany). The xenografting of fragments of PNF was carried out as described previously  [17] ,  [19] . Briefly, a small incision was made into the skin to expose the right sciatic nerve and an incision was made into the sciatic nerve, under which one tumor piece was orthtopically implanted ( Fig. 1A, B ). After confirming successful xenografting by ultrasound scanning one week later, the 23 mice were randomly allocated into three groups: 8 as controls, 8 for nilotinib treatment and 7 for imatinib treatment. 10.1371/journal.pone.0107760.g001 Figure 1 Xenograft on sciatic nerve in mouse.

Nilotinib (as the hydrochloride salt) was diluted in 10% N-methyl-pyrrolidinone and 90% polyethylene glycol 300. Imatinib (as the mesylate salt) was dissolved in sterile water. Oral administration at a daily dose of 100 mg/kg of the drugs was started on day 7 after implantation and was continued to day 35. Body weights of the mice were recorded daily and the drug dosage was adjusted accordingly. Food consumption and general condition of the mice were monitored weekly. At the end of the treatment, animal blood was collected 3 hours after the last oral administration of nilotinib for plasma preparation. Nilotinib concentration was measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry  [20] . Ultrasound monitoring of xenografts Sonographic measurement was performed using a Vevo 2100 micro-imaging system (VisualSonics, Amsterdam, Netherlands), which is a high-frequency, high-resolution digital imaging platform with linear technology and color Doppler mode. Xenografts were verified after 7 days post transplantation and measured weekly during the whole treatment period of 4 weeks. Three-dimensional images of the xenografts were generated and analyzed using the Vevo software version 5.0.0 to calculate their size in volume ( Fig. 1B–D ). Cytotoxicity of mouse spleen cells Non-adherent spleen cells were harvested from the mice after erythrocyte- depriving and 3 hours adherence at 37°C. Cytotoxic efficacy of the non-adherent spleen cells was assessed by adding them as effector cells to PNF-derived Schwann cells as target cells at a ratio of 1∶10 for 4 h using the CytoTox 96 Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity assay (Promega, Fitchburg, WI). Statistical analysis The effect of the drugs  in vitro  was evaluated using Student's  t -test and the IC 50  was calculated. Sizes of each xenograft and body weight of the mice were normalized against the corresponding initial values. Time course of size change of the xenografts and body weight increase of the mice in the three groups were compared with each other using a linear mixed model. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for the relationships between the reduction of tumor volumes and the cell cytotoxicity, and between the reduction of tumor volumes and the nilotinib concentrations.  P <0.05 was considered significant. All averaged data were represented as the mean ±standard deviation .",Jiang Wei; Marcus Freytag; Yvonne Schober; Wolfgang A Nockher; Victor F Mautner; Reinhard E Friedrich; Paul W Manley; Lan Kluwe; Andreas Kurtz,PloS one,2014,10.1371/journal.pone.0107760,minimal,True
PMID:29787563,Graph complexity analysis identifies an ETV5 tumor-specific network in human and murine low-grade glioma.,"Conventional differential expression analyses have been successfully employed to identify genes whose levels change across experimental conditions. One limitation of this approach is the inability to discover central regulators that control gene expression networks. In addition, while methods for identifying central nodes in a network are widely implemented, the bioinformatics validation process and the theoretical error estimates that reflect the uncertainty in each step of the analysis are rarely considered. Using the betweenness centrality measure, we identified Etv5 as a potential tissue-level regulator in murine neurofibromatosis type 1 (Nf1) low-grade brain tumors (optic gliomas). As such, the expression of Etv5 and Etv5 target genes were increased in multiple independently-generated mouse optic glioma models relative to non-neoplastic (normal healthy) optic nerves, as well as in the cognate human tumors (pilocytic astrocytoma) relative to normal human brain. Importantly, differential Etv5 and Etv5 network expression was not directly the result of Nf1 gene dysfunction in specific cell types, but rather reflects a property of the tumor as an aggregate tissue. Moreover, this differential Etv5 expression was independently validated at the RNA and protein levels. Taken together, the combined use of network analysis, differential RNA expression findings, and experimental validation highlights the potential of the computational network approach to provide new insights into tumor biology.","Materials and methods Mice Nf1  (N),  flox/flox Nf1 flox/null ; GFAP-Cre (OPG-1),  Nf1 flox/R681 *; GFAP-Cre (OPG-2),  Nf1 flox/null ;  Pten flox/wt ; GFAP-Cre (OPG-3), and  Nf1 flox/null ; Olig2-Cre (OPG-4) mice [ 2 ,  11 – 13 ] were maintained on a C57Bl/6 background. Mice were housed in standard caging systems, which included irradiated commercial mouse chow and acidified water available at all times. Temperatures were kept at 70–72°F with 50–60% humidity on static racks. Light cycles were set at 5:00am on and 7:00pm off. All cages include pressed cotton squares for environmental enrichment that were changed multiple times per week. Every animal was checked at least once per day, and mating cages and cages with litters were checked twice per day for appearance, movement and overall health to monitor well-being. Mice were euthanized with 200 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital via i.p. prior to tissue isolation. All procedures were performed in accordance with an approved Animal Studies Committee protocol at Washington University with associated ethics committee approval. Immunohistochemistry Optic nerves were microdissected and processed as described previously [ 14 ,  15 ]. Rabbit anti-Etv5 antibody (Novus Biologicals) was diluted at 1:100 for immunohistochemistry. RNA isolation Mice were perfused, followed by optic nerves/chiasms microdissection, and preservation in TRIzol solution. RNA was isolated by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by isopropanol precipitation. RNA from primary astrocytes was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Quantitative real-time PCR qPCR was performed as described previously [ 16 ]. The primers used for these experiments are listed in  S1 Table . Primary astrocyte culture Wild-type and  Nf1 -/- primary astrocytes were generated and maintained as previously described [ 17 – 20 ]. RNA-seq experiments RNA-sequencing of optic nerves/chiasms isolated from 6-weeks-old mice was performed as previously described [ 15 ]. Regulatory network construction The glioma network was inferred from the Rembrandt microarray data set (available from GEO  GSE68848  [ 21 ]). The Rembrandt data were generated through the Glioma Molecular Diagnostic Initiative and include 874 glioma specimens. With the Rembrandt data, the network was built using the ARACNe-AP algorithm [ 22 ,  23 ]. The ARACNe-AP algorithm reconstructs gene regulatory networks from large-scale gene expression data [ 23 ]. The steps used in this algorithm are summarized below: The input to the algorithm is a list of transcription facts and gene expression profile data. The gene expression data is pre-processed in order to determine a mutual information (MI) threshold. Specifically, all pairwise MI scores between gene expression profiles are estimated, and then their significance assessed by comparing them to a null dataset. The significance level depends on the sample size of the input. The bootstrapping step: selecting a random sample from the input gene expression profiles.
 The gene expression profiles are rank-transformed, and then the MI for each Transcription Factor/Target pair is calculated. The MI threshold from Step 2 is used to remove any connections that are not statistically significant. Indirect interactions are removed using the Data Processing Inequality tolerance filter described in [ 22 ]. A network is constructed using consensus, by keeping only edges that were detected a significant number of times across all bootstrap runs in Step 3. Significance is determined using a Poisson distribution, keeping only those edges with a p-value less than 0.05. The ARACNe algorithm, first described in [ 22 ], has been successfully used for over a decade. The Adaptive Paritioning version of the algorithm improves on the original method by eliminating the use of pre-determined bins of fixed sizes for estimating the mutual information. The resulting ARACNe-AP algorithm and its validation are described in detail in [ 23 ]. Various networks constructed using the algorithm are available online from bioconductor.org as the aracne.networks data package. The regulatory network used in this study is provided as part of the supplementary materials ( S2 Table ). Centrality calculations RNA expression data from optic nerves of  Nf1 flox/flox  (N, normal control group,  n  = 4) and  Nf1 flox/mut ; GFAP-Cre (OPG-1, tumor group,  n  = 11) were generated previously [ 15 ] and used to create separate weighted networks. Note that the network structure is the same for the two groups, but the weights assigned to the edges differ. Genes that were not expressed in one of the groups were removed from the network. The network weights are given by the distance between two nodes (i.e., between two genes). The distances between two genes ( j  and  k ) are calculated as 1 − |  ρ ( x ,  j x )| where  k ρ ( x ,  j x ) is the minimum of the Pearson and Spearman correlations between the expression levels of gene  k j  and gene  k . The betweenness centrality of gene  i  is the fraction of shortest paths in the network that go through gene  i . Note that our original choice of transcriptome network built by the ARACNe-AP algorithm has a consequence that only regulators (and not their targets) have high centrality measures. Centrality measures were calculated using the  igraph  package in R [ 24 ]. Differential expression analysis The differential expression and fold change calculations on the RNA-Seq datasets (including all of the OPG datasets) were performed using the R package  DESeq2  version 1.18.1 [ 25 ], including use of Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-values [ 26 ] with an adjusted significance level of 0.01. Published microarray data were analyzed by comparing pilocytic astrocytomas and normal control samples. The publicly available data were already normalized, and we performed standard two-sample t-tests on all probes in each dataset. After analysis at the probe level, data were collated based on the gene to which the probes mapped. Because the analysis was confirmatory for ETV5 and its network (and not exploratory), we did not adjust for multiple comparisons. Details of the datasets employed RNA-Seq Data for 3-month-old murine non-neoplastic and OPG-1, OPG-2, OPG-3, OPG-4 models .

PMID:28398289,A high-throughput molecular data resource for cutaneous neurofibromas.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder with a range of clinical manifestations such as widespread growth of benign tumours called neurofibromas, pain, learning disorders, bone deformities, vascular abnormalities and even malignant tumours. With the establishment of the Children's Tumour Foundation biobank, neurofibroma samples can now be collected directly from patients to be analysed by the larger scientific community. This work describes a pilot study to characterize one class of neurofibroma, cutaneous neurofibromas, by molecularly profiling of ~40 cutaneous neurofibromas collected from 11 individual patients. Data collected from each tumour includes (1) SNP Arrays, (2) Whole genome sequencing (WGS) and (3) RNA-Sequencing. These data are now freely available for further analysis at http://www.synapse.org/cutaneousNF.","Methods Sample collection Eligible patients between the ages of 18 and 65 who were scheduled to receive elective surgery to remove cutaneous neurofibromas were invited to donate surgical discards as well as blood and urine samples. Patients consented to the release of their tissue samples and any resultant data through a protocol approved by Western IRB (Puyallup, WA). Patient-reported medical, family and NF1 history was also collected. Sample information is available in the table in the data repository (syn5556216; Data Citation 1). Each tumour was sub-divided with each part either preserved in formalin, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, or placed in RNA later solution within 45 min of removal from the patient. If there was not enough tissue for all three methods of preservation, priority was given to formalin, followed by frozen. Samples noted by the patient as recently growing were annotated as such, and each sample was labelled by the location of the body from which it was retrieved. Skin covering the tumours was not removed prior to preservation but was removed prior to sequencing. 30 cc of blood was also collected from each patient and stored at −80 °C. PBMCs were isolated and stored at −150 °C. Whole genome sequencing Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from both frozen tumour and blood tissues using the DNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The final elution was performed in 50 μl of RNase-free sterile distilled water. The concentration of the gDNA was estimated using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen); samples with less than 500 ng were discarded. The integrity of the gDNA was assessed by running an aliquot of the gDNA on 0–8% agarose gel to confirm absence of RNA or protein bands as well as absence of a smear that would indicate degradation. One microgram gDNA was required for downstream whole genome library preparation applications. The samples were then sonicated on the Covaris LE220 (Covaris Inc, Woburn, MA, USA) to achieve an average target size of 400 bp. QC analysis of the post-sonicated material was done using Caliper LabChip GX (Perkin Elmer, Hopkinton, MA, USA). Standard whole genome library prep was done using the NEBNext DNA Library Prep Reagent Set for Illumina (New England BioLabs Inc., Ipswich, MA, USA) as per manufacturer's recommended protocol. Library quality was assessed using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer, and the library concentration was estimated by utilizing a DNA 1,000 Chip on an Agilent 2,100 Bioanalyzer. Accurate quantification for sequencing applications was determined using the qPCR-based KAPA Biosystems Library Quantification Kit (Kapa Biosystems, Inc., Woburn, MA, USA). Each sample was then sequenced on an individual lane on an Illumina HiSeqX sequencer (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Reads were mapped to the genome and variants identified using the Dragen  program with default settings. The resulting VCF files (syn5522788; Data Citation 1) were then sorted and updated to remove errors and analysed using the GATK pipeline 7  (syn5522790; Data Citation 1). 8 Somatic mutations were called from BAM files exported by the Dragen alignment using the Java version of VarDict  in paired mode with an allele frequency threshold of 0.01. VarDict was able to recall germ line variants and also identify somatic variants that were present in the tumour samples but absent in the matched PBMC samples for each patient (syn6022465 and syn6022474; Data Citation 1). 9 Copy number analysis Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted as described above, but required two hundred and fifty nanograms of gDNA for downstream SNP array applications. SNP array sample prep was done using the HumanOmni2.5–8 (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) as per manufacturer's recommended protocol as described: http://support.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-marketing/documents/products/workflows/workflow_infinium.pdf http://support.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-support/documents/documentation/chemistry_documentation/infinium_assays/infinium_lcg_assay/infinium-lcg-assay-guide-15023139-d.pdf Samples were analysed by GenomeStudio and exported to text (syn5004874; Data Citation 1). RNA sequencing Total RNA containing both mRNA as well as microRNA fractions was extracted from the tissues using the miRNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The final elution was performed in 30 μl of RNase-free sterile distilled water. The concentration and integrity of the extracted total RNA were estimated using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen) and Agilent 2,100 Bioanalyzer (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA), respectively. Five hundred nanograms of total RNA and a RIN of 7.0 or higher were required for downstream RNA-seq applications. Poly-adenylated RNAs were isolated using NEBNext Magnetic Oligo d(T)25 Beads. The NEBNext mRNA Library Prep Reagent Set for Illumina (New England BioLabs Inc., Ipswich, MA, USA) was then used to prepare individually bar-coded next-generation sequencing expression libraries as per manufacturer's recommended protocol. Library quality was assessed using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer, and the library concentration was estimated by utilizing a DNA 1,000 Chip on an Agilent 2,100 Bioanalyzer. Accurate quantification for sequencing applications was determined using the qPCR-based KAPA Biosystems Library Quantification Kit (Kapa Biosystems, Inc., Woburn, MA, USA). Each library was diluted to a final concentration of 12.5 nM and pooled in an equimolar ratio prior to clustering. Paired-end sequencing (25 million, 50-bp, paired-end reads) was performed using a 200 Cycle TruSeq SBS HS v4 Kit on an Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencer (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Post-processing of the sequencing reads from RNA-seq experiments for each sample was performed using HudsonAlpha’s unique in-house RNA-seq data analysis pipeline (syn6035832; Data Citation 1). Briefly, quality control checks on raw sequence data for each sample were performed using FastQC (Babraham Bioinformatics, Cambridge, UK). Raw reads were mapped to the reference human genome hg19 using TopHat v2.0 (ref.  10 ) with the -p 4 and -r210 arguments. The alignment metrics of the mapped reads were estimated using SAMtools  (syn6022474; Data Citation 1). 11 Reads were quantified by both Cufflinks v0.9.3 (ref.  10 ) (syn5492805; Data Citation 1) and FeatureCounts  (syn5493036; Data Citation 1). 12 Code availability All data is currently stored in the synapse web portal, and is accessible using code in the Cutaneous NF Github repository at  http://www.github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/dermalNF .",Sara J C Gosline; Hubert Weinberg; Pamela Knight; Thomas Yu; Xindi Guo; Nripesh Prasad; Angela Jones; Shristi Shrestha; Braden Boone; Shawn E Levy; Salvatore La Rosa; Justin Guinney; Annette Bakker,Scientific data,2017-04-11,10.1038/sdata.2017.45,minimal,True
PMID:33948356,Cordycepin inhibits the proliferation of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor cells through the p53/Sp1/tubulin pathway.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common hereditary neurocutaneous disorders. In addition to skin pigmentation and cutaneous neurofibroma, some patients developed the plexiform neurofibroma since birth. Plexiform neurofibroma has abundant Schwann cells, fibroblasts, mast cells, blood vessels, and connective tissues, which increases the risk of developing a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). MPNST is a highly invasive cancer with no effective therapeutic agent. Cordycepin or 3'-deoxyadenosine is an extract from cordyceps militaris, which has been reported as an anti-inflammation and anti-tumor agent. Herein, we evaluated cordycepin's anti-proliferative effect on MPNST cell lines both ",,Ming-Jen Lee; Jen-Chieh Lee; Jung-Hsien Hsieh; May-Yao Lin; I-An Shih; Huey-Ling You; Kai Wang,American journal of cancer research,2021,,abstract_only,False
PMID:29670214,Restoring functional neurofibromin by protein transduction.,"In Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) germ line loss of function mutations result in reduction of cellular neurofibromin content (NF1+/-, NF1 haploinsufficiency). The Ras-GAP neurofibromin is a very large cytoplasmic protein (2818 AA, 319 kDa) involved in the RAS-MAPK pathway. Aside from regulation of proliferation, it is involved in mechanosensoric of cells. We investigated neurofibromin replacement in cultured human fibroblasts showing reduced amount of neurofibromin. Full length neurofibromin was produced recombinantly in insect cells and purified. Protein transduction into cultured fibroblasts was performed employing cell penetrating peptides along with photochemical internalization. This combination of transduction strategies ensures the intracellular uptake and the translocation to the cytoplasm of neurofibromin. The transduced neurofibromin is functional, indicated by functional rescue of reduced mechanosensoric blindness and reduced RasGAP activity in cultured fibroblasts of NF1 patients or normal fibroblasts treated by NF1 siRNA. Our study shows that recombinant neurofibromin is able to revert cellular effects of NF1 haploinsuffiency in vitro, indicating a use of protein transduction into cells as a potential treatment strategy for the monogenic disease NF1.","Materials and Methods Cell culture The processing of tissue and the preparation of the human fibroblasts was performed as described . Biopsies from the healthy male donors (aged 3, 3 and 11 years, respectively) were obtained from the prepuce. Skin samples of NF1 patients (NF191 – NF329, aged 8–40 years) derived from NF1 patients clinically meeting the criteria for Neurofibromatosis type 1. The research carried out was in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration and approved by the local ethics committee (Ethikkommission University of Ulm, A 185/09). The patients gave written informed consent for scientific usage of their tissues. The fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), l-glutamin and antibiotics at 37 °C and 9% CO 32 2 . Expression and purification of synNF1 and synNF1eGFP Cloning and generation of recombinant baculoviruses A synthetic gene (GeneArt) encoding the human full-length NF1 (synNF1) was cloned into the pFastBacHta (Life Technology) vector in frame with the upstream His 6 -tag followed by a Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV-) protease cleavage site. For expression of full-length human neurofibromin with C-terminal eGFP tag (synNF1eGFP) the eGFP coding sequence was cloned three times subsequently in frame at the 3′-end of the full-length  NF1  sequence in the synNF1 pFastBacHta vector. Recombinant baculoviruses were generated according to Berger I.  et al . using  E .  coli  DH10Multibac cells containing the modified baculoviral genome and Sf21 insect cells (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Expression and purification SynNF1 was expressed and purified as described . For the production of synNF1eGFP Sf21 cells were infected with saturating amounts (multiplicity of infection (MOI) 1–2) of recombinant synNF1 or synNF1eGFP expressing baculoviruses, harvested via centrifugation after 72 h post-infection and stored at −80 °C. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer [50 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mM TCEP, 10 mM imidazole] supplemented with cOmplete, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mix (Roche) and cells were lysed by a freeze thaw cycle in liquid nitrogen. Recombinant neurofibromin was purified from the soluble fraction via immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) using HisTrap FF columns (GE Healthcare) followed by a size exclusion chromatography (SEC) on a Superose 6 column (GE Healthcare) in 50 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mM TCEP. SEC fractions containing synNF1 or synNF1eGFP were collected and concentrated using Vivaspin Centrifugal Concentrators with a cutoff of 100 kDa (Santorius). The purified protein was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. 33 , 40 Transduction of synNF1 into fibroblasts SynNF1 was transduced into fibroblasts using the transduction reagent EndoPorter (GeneTools, LLC). 5000 cells per cm 2  were seeded in in 6-well plates. In the following, the fibroblasts were incubated in DMEM containing 10% FCS, L-glutamine, antibiotics, 18 µl Endoporter reagent and 9 µg of the synNF1 protein at 37 °C and 9% CO 2  for 24 hours. According to the subsequent measurement, the cells were either trypsinized and seeded on PDMS gel (measurement of cell orientation), lysed in RIPA buffer (western blot) or examined using fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss, Axioscope). Western Blot For western blot analyses, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and 10–20 µg of total protein were used for SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes. For detection the following antibodies and the ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (Amersham, GE Healthcare) were used: Anti- ERK1/2 (p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2); Cell Signaling Technology; 1:1000), anti-phopho ERK1/2 (Phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) (Thr202/Tyr204); Cell Signaling Technology; 1:1000), anti-GAPDH; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.; 1:3000), anti-rabbit IgG HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.; 1:25000) and anti-mouse IgG HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.; 1:50000). To compensate uneven gel loading, the detected protein bands were quantified using the ImageJ software ( https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/ ). Before calculation of treatment effects corresponding bands were normalized using the measured amounts of the housekeeping protein GAPDH. Photochemical internalization (PCI) The PCI treatment was performed as described previously . In short, the cells were incubated for 24 hours in DMEM containing 1 µg/ml TPPS 31 4  (5,10,15,20-Tetrakis-(4-sulfonato-phenyl)-21,23H-porphyrin, TriPorTech GmbH, Lübeck, Germany) to achieve an incorporation of the photosensitizer (TPPS 4 ) into the fibroblasts’ membranes. To release subsequent transduced proteins, a 10 minute light exposure with visual blue light was performed (Osram L 18 W/67, Osram, München, Germany). siRNA transfection of human fibroblasts The human  NF1 +/+ fibroblasts KF3 were transfected with 4 siRNAs (FlexiTube, Qiagen, Hilden; Supplementary Table  2 ) designed for silencing the NF1 message using the Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent (Life Technologies). As a control the Allstar Negative Control siRNA (Qiagen) was used. The culture medium was removed and the cells were washed 2 times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The fibroblasts were trypsinized and centrifuged. Then, the cell pellet was resuspended in 2 ml DMEM and the cells were counted in a Neubauers’ chamber. The fibroblasts suspension was diluted resulting in a dilution of 50000 cells per 1.7 ml. For the production of the transfection complex 5 µl siRNA (10 µM; 1.25 of the 4 different NF1 siRNAs each or 5 µl of the control siRNA) were mixed with 292 ml OptiMEM (Gibco) and 3.3 µl Lipofectamine RNAiMAX followed by an incubation for 20 minutes at 20 °C. The 300.3 µl transfection complex was pipetted into a well of a 6-well plate (Nunc). Then 1.7 ml of the cell suspension (50000 cells) were mixed to the complex. After that, the fibroblasts were incubated with the transfection complex for 48 hours at 37 °C and 9% CO 2 . Relative quantification (RT qPCR) of the  NF1  transcripts To quantify the  NF1  mRNA, total RNA was isolated either directly after the siRNA transfection was finished or after additional follow up times in DMEM at 37 °C and 9% CO 2 . For RNA isolation the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) was used. The cells were transferred on ice, washed with PBS (4 °C) and then directly lysed in 700 µl of the kits’ RLT lysis containing 1% mercaptoethanol. The lysate was centrifuged through a shredder column (Qiagen) and then load on the kits’ RNA capture column. The following washing and elution steps were performed as indicated in the manufacturers’ handbook. Afterwards, 1 µg of the RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA with the Superscript III kit (Qiagen) using random hexamers. In each qPCR reaction, 100ng RNA equivalent were used. Besides the  NF1  mRNA,  Alas1  and  PolR2A  mRNA levels were measured as housekeepers . Each measurement was performed in triplicates. The relative amount of  41 NF1  mRNA was calculated using the geometric mean of both housekeepers to avoid gene specific fluctuations. The primer efficacies of the 3 primer pairs (primer sequences in Supplementary Table  2 ) were comparable allowing a relative quantification. Micro-nano-structured substrates A master wafer was produced by conventional optical lithography. The desired lateral structure of the surface topography was transferred to a silicon wafer covered with photo resist by an optical illumination process. In the simplest case, one obtains the master wafer with the negative of the desired surface topography after appropriate developing steps. In the next step the surface topography was transferred to a polymer substrate. This was done by casting a polymere, poly(dimethyl)siloxane (PDMS) on the master wafer. The surface of the polymer substrate was now structured with the desired pattern. After further surface modification the polymer to make it adhesive for cells the substrate can be used to culture cells on it and to measure their behaviour. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was chosen as material for the cell culture substrates because of its biocompatibility. To fabricate microstructured PDMS substrates master wafers were produced by photolithography. Such master substrates with defined microstripe structures were used as the moulds for transferring the topography pattern to the PDMS substrates. In brief, the structured substrates were fabricated in a clean room as described previously . Master substrates (2′ silicon-100 wafers) were structured by a photolithographic technique resulting in rectangular parallel grooves of a depth of 200 nm and a groove width and interspace of 2 µm. PDMS (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning) was polymerized by mixing the pre-polymer with the curing agent with a ratio of 10:1. The mixture was cured on the master wafer at 65 °C for 24 hours. Then, round experiment gels with a diameter of 0.7 cm were cut out of the master gel. Before cell experiments, PDMS substrates were sterilized with 100% ethanol, washed three times by PBS, transferred into 48well plates (Nunc), coated for 1 hour with FCS at 37 °C and 9% CO 42 2  and finally used in the experiments. The surface topography of the PDMS substrates was verified by atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy as previously shown . 42 Measuring the partial blindness of fibroblast to nanostructured PDMS gels Cells were seeded on the PDMS substrates in regular culture media. After 48 hours, the cells were fixed in ethanol and methanol containing 2 µg/ml DAPI. After 2 washing steps in PBS, the PDMS substrates were examined on a Zeiss Axioscope. Images of the cells in phase contrast and the staining of the corresponding nuclei as fluorescence picture were taken. Microscopy images of the cells were analyzed by ImageJ software ( http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/ ). The orientation angle of the cells was determined by using the orientation of the nucleus of the corresponding cell. The DAPI staining was used to highlight the nuclei and to fit ellipses. The angle between the principle axis of an ellipse and the nano-micro structures was used as the orientation angle of a single cell. At least 100 (up to 700) single cell orientation angles were measured. The median of the measured aberrations angles was used as the orientation of the cells in this experiment. For each treatment of the primary fibroblasts, 3–5 independent experiments were performed. Statistical analyses were performed by comparing the orientations of the independent experiment of differing treatment (e.g. NF1 status) using t-tests. The significance level was set to 0.05. Statistics For statistical analysis, student’s t-tests were performed. A p-value < 0.05 was considered as significant.",K Mellert; S Lechner; M Lüdeke; M Lamla; P Möller; R Kemkemer; K Scheffzek; D Kaufmann,Scientific reports,2018-04-18,10.1038/s41598-018-24310-5,minimal,True
PMID:24619350,Longitudinal evaluation of quality of life in 288 patients with neurofibromatosis 2.,"Advances in molecular biology have resulted in novel therapy for neurofibromatosis 2-related (NF2) tumours, highlighting the need for robust outcome measures. The disease-focused NF2 impact on quality of life (NFTI-QOL) patient questionnaire was assessed as an outcome measure for treatment in a multi-centre study. NFTI-QOL was related to clinician-rated severity (ClinSev) and genetic severity (GenSev) over repeated visits. Data were evaluated for 288 NF2 patients (n = 464 visits) attending the English national NF2 clinics from 2010 to 2012. The male-to-female ratio was equal and the mean age was 42.2 (SD 17.8) years. The analysis included NFTI-QOL eight-item score, ClinSev graded as mild, moderate, or severe, and GenSev as a rank order of the number of NF2 mutations (graded as mild, moderate, severe). The mean (SD) 8.7 (5.4) score for NFTI-QOL for either a first visit or all visits 9.2 (5.4) was similar to the published norm of 9.4 (5.5), with no significant relationships with age or gender. NFTI-QOL internal reliability was good, with a Cronbach's alpha score of 0.85 and test re-test reliability r = 0.84. NFTI related to ClinSev (r = 0.41, p < 0.001; r = 0.46 for all visits), but weakly to GenSev (r = 0.16, p < 0.05; r = 0.15 for all visits). ClinSev related to GenSev (r = 0.41, p < 0.001; r = 0.42 for all visits). NFTI-QOL showed a good reliability and ability to detect significant longitudinal changes in the QOL of individuals. The moderate relationships of NFTI-QOL with clinician- and genetic-rated severity suggest that NFTI-QOL taps into NF2 patient experiences that are not encompassed by ClinSev rating or genotype.","Methods Ethical approval The study was approved as a clinical evaluation, with study number 3711, by the Clinical Audit Group committee at Guy’s and St Thomas’ National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust, London. Participating centres, inclusion and exclusion criteria NIFTI-QOL data were collected for all patient visits to the national NF2 services at Guy’s and St. Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge University NHS Foundation Trust, Central Manchester University Hospitals Foundation Trust, and satellite NF2 services from April 2010 to October 2012. Individuals who did not fulfil the diagnostic criteria for generalised or mosaic NF2, or who were aged <16 years were excluded from the study. Age and gender were recorded for all patients. Clinician-rated severity Clinician-rated severity was assessed as severe, moderate, or mild and was determined during the clinical visit. Severe disease was classified as symptomatic presentation at age <20 years with at least two symptomatic or large tumours >1.5 cm, in addition to VS and including tumours removed previously. Individuals who were diagnosed with a central nervous system tumour before the age of 12 years and had at least one other symptomatic tumour were also rated as severe. Patients older than 30 years at presentation with no more than two symptomatic or large tumours >1.5 cm including VS and tumours excised previously were assessed as mild. Moderate disease was classified as not meeting mild or severe criteria [ 1 ,  3 ]. Genetic-rated severity Genetic severity was rated as severe, moderate, or mild. Truncating mutations in exons 1–13 in all cells were rated as severe. Moderate disease included (1) deletion not involving the promoter region or exon 1, (2) splice site mutations in exons 1–8, and (3) mosaicism of truncating mutations in exons 1–13 in blood. Mild disease was classified as (1) a missense mutation or an in-frame deletion, (2) a large deletion involving the promoter region or exon 1, (3) a splice-site mutation in exons 9–15, (4) mosaicism (excluding moderate criteria), and (5) no mutation identified on blood analysis [ 1 ,  6 ,  7 ,  15 ,  17 – 19 ]. Clinical assessment and NFTI-QOL At each clinic visit, patients underwent clinical assessment and completed the NFTI-QOL, an eight-item questionnaire (and a free-response section) with a maximum score of 3 per item (four-point scale, range 0–3, with three as the most impaired) and total score of 24 [ 14 ]. Patients who were unable to complete the questionnaire due to visual or motor difficulties were assisted by a specialist nurse. Statistics The NFTI-QOL, clinical, and genetic data were analysed with SPSS using correlation, linear regression, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) tools as required.",Rosalie E Ferner; Adam Shaw; D Gareth Evans; Dympna McAleer; Dorothy Halliday; Allyson Parry; F Lucy Raymond; Juliette Durie-Gair; C Oliver Hanemann; Rachel Hornigold; Patrick Axon; John F Golding,Journal of neurology,2014-05,10.1007/s00415-014-7303-1,minimal,True
PMID:28256556,An inflammatory gene signature distinguishes neurofibroma Schwann cells and macrophages from cells in the normal peripheral nervous system.,"Neurofibromas are benign peripheral nerve tumors driven by NF1 loss in Schwann cells (SCs). Macrophages are abundant in neurofibromas, and macrophage targeted interventions may have therapeutic potential in these tumors. We generated gene expression data from fluorescence-activated cell sorted (FACS) SCs and macrophages from wild-type and mutant nerve and neurofibroma to identify candidate pathways involved in SC-macrophage cross-talk. While in 1-month-old Nf1 mutant nerve neither SCs nor macrophages significantly differed from their normal counterparts, both macrophages and SCs showed significantly altered cytokine gene expression in neurofibromas. Computationally reconstructed SC-macrophage molecular networks were enriched for inflammation-associated pathways. We verified that neurofibroma SC conditioned medium contains macrophage chemo-attractants including colony stimulation factor 1 (CSF1). Network analysis confirmed previously implicated pathways and predict novel paracrine and autocrine loops involving cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. Network analysis also predicted a central role for decreased type-I interferon signaling. We validated type-I interferon expression in neurofibroma by protein profiling, and show that treatment of neurofibroma-bearing mice with polyethylene glycolyated (PEGylated) type-I interferon-α2b reduces the expression of many cytokines overexpressed in neurofibroma. These studies reveal numerous potential targetable interactions between Nf1 mutant SCs and macrophages for further analyses.","Methods Ethics statement All experiments with vertebrate animals were performed in accordance with Institutional guidelines and regulations at the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), and methods were approved by the CCHMC Institutional Review Board. Mice All mice were maintained on the C57Bl/6 background from Harlan laboratories (Indianapolis, IN), by in-house breeding to  Nf1  and  fl/ + DhhCre  to obtain  Nf1 fl/fl ;DhhCre  or  Nf1  mice, as previously described fl/fl 3 . Mouse genotyping and recombination assays were carried out as described 2 . Cell dissociation for cell sorting We collected mouse DRG/neurofibroma/nerve, cut tissue into 1–3 mm 3  pieces, and plated them in dissociation medium containing 20 mL L-15 (Mediatech), 0.5 mg/mL collagenase type 1 (Worthington; Lakewood, NJ), and 2.5 mg/mL dispase protease type II (Cambrex; East Rutherford, NJ) at 37 °C for 4–6 hours with shaking as described 58 . The dissociation reaction was stopped by adding Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) + 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Undigested DRG and tumors were excluded using a 100 μM cell strainer. Cells were collected by centrifugation. Cell sorting We incubated the dissociated mouse DRG/neurofibroma cell suspensions with anti-mouse monoclonal antibodies against CD11b (8G12/HPCA-2, Becton–Dickinson; San Jose, CA) bound to allophycocyanin (APC) anti-p75/NGFR (C40-1457, Becton–Dickinson) bound to phycoerythrin (PE), anti-F4/80 bound to Cy5.5 on ice in a solution containing phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)/0.2%BSA/0.01% NaN 3  for 30 minutes. After washing, we resuspended cells in PBS/0.2%BSA/0.01% NaN 3 /2 mg/mL 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD, Invitrogen). We carried out isotopic controls with irrelevant IgG1–APC, IgG1–PE and IgG1-Cy5.5 in parallel. We acquired cell suspensions in a dual-laser (Argon 488 and dye laser 630 or HeNe 633) FACSCanto (Becton–Dickinson) and analyzed on an “alive” gate based on light scatter parameters and 7-AAD staining negativity. Because some T cells are p75 positive, our forward scaffold enable us to avoid T cells when sorting SCs. RNA purification RNAs were isolated using RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). RNA purification was performed as described. RNA integrity was determined by Agilent BioAnalyzer. RNAs with RNA Integrity Number (RIN) ≥ 9 were processed for Affymetrix platform. Microarrays For each microarray (SCs, macrophages), Affymetrix GeneChip Command Console (v4.0.0) was used to create .chp files. All the probe sets on Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.0 ST array (Mogene-2_0-st-v1.na33.2.mm10) were summarized by the Affymetrix Expression Console program (v1.3.1) using robust multi-chip average (RMA) method. After preprocessing steps, data from two batches were combined and their batch effects were corrected using ComBat method implemented in Bioconductor’s sva package. HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC)’s orthology prediction database ( http://www.genenames.org/cgi-bin/hcop ) was used to get human-to-mouse gene orthology information. Mouse genes with strong human orthologs were included in this study. Microarray raw data are available (Accession Number:  GSE78901 ) at Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Differential gene expression The Bioconductor/R limma package was used to define DEGs between two groups. Genes were considered differentially expressed when they passed two cutoff criteria (FDR q < 0.05 and fold change >2x). The most updated MGI (for mouse,  http://www.informatics.jax.org ) and HGNC (for human,  http://www.genenames.org ) gene/protein nomenclature was adopted in this study. Gene set enrichment analysis Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using the WebGestalt webserver ( http://bioinfo.vanderbilt.edu/webgestalt/ ). DEG sets were queried against the KEGG database and and FDR q < 0.05 cutoff was applied to select significantly enriched KEGG pathways. Ligand-Receptor interaction map To construct a ligand-receptor interaction map, we compiled three separate public databases providing ligand-receptor binding-pair annotations. To collect a list of ligand and receptor genes, we parsed Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated with extracellular ligands and membrane receptors. The Database of Ligand-Receptor Partners (DLRP,  http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/dip/DLRP.cgi ) includes 462 interactions between 176 ligands and 133 receptors. Experimentally proven interactions ( in vivo  and/or  in vitro ) extracted from BioGrid v3.2 ( http://thebiogrid.org ) include 64 interactions between 36 ligands and 107 receptors. An XML file containing 242 cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions (138 ligands and 107 receptors) was downloaded from KEGG (mmu:04062) and parsed. After deleting redundant interaction pairs, we compiled an interaction map containing 635 ligand-receptor interactions including 182 ligands and 205 receptor genes. DEGs from the comparison of 7-month-old SC ( NF1 ) group to 1-month-old SC and 7-month-old macrophages group to 1-month-old DRG macrophages by applying FDR q < 0.05 and fold change >2x cutoffs, and then mapped to this ligand-receptor map. The final interaction map was automatically generated using in-house Perl script and the GraphViz graph package ( −/− http://www.graphviz.org ). Macrophage subtype gene expression data Gene Expression datasets of macrophage/monocyte subtypes (n = 23) were downloaded from the Immunological Genome Project (ImmGen) data portal ( https://www.immgen.org/ ). This includes bone marrow classical monocytes, bone marrow non-classical monocytes, bone marrow macrophages, red pulp macrophages, lung residential macrophages, peritoneal dendritic cells, and small intestine dendritic cells. To characterize the subtype(s) of our 1- and 7-month-old neurofibroma macrophages, we applied Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) 23  to our data and to the ImmGen datasets, using total transcriptomes, ligand-receptor genes from our re-compilation, and M1/M2 polarization signature genes. M1/M2 polarization signature gene sets were collected from published papers 19 20 21 22 . The number of factors was determined by Velicer’s minimum average partial (MAP) procedure in R (psych package), and maximum-likelihood factor analysis was performed using factanal function (stats package) in R. TAM gene expression data We compared monocyte/macrophage datasets to those available in the ImmGen project ( GSE37448 ) and TAM datasets, including glioma, neuroblastoma, and thymoma ( GSE59047 ) to 1- and 7-month-old neurofibroma macrophages. To identify hidden clusters, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) 23  was applied using gene expression profiles from total transcriptomes, ligand-receptor genes from our re-compilation, and M1/M2/TAM polarization signature genes 19 . Macrophage migration assay We used 24-well Transwells (Corning #3421, New York, NY, 5.0 μm pore size) for migration assays. We added 0.6 mL mouse wild-type SC or neurofibroma SC conditioned medium, collected from 3–5 × 10 6  cells cultured in DMEM + 10% FBS + Forskolin + β-heregulin (HRG) for 18 hours at 80–90% confluence to wells, then added a Transwell insert, and 0.1 mL DMEM medium containing 10% FBS or 50 ng/mL Anti-CSF1 (R&D Systems MAB4161) in the same medium. Then, 1.2 × 10 4  bone marrow-derived macrophages were added to the inside compartment of the Transwell insert. DMEM with and without 100 ng CXCL12/SDF-1α (460-SD-010: R&D Systems) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. After 24 hours at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 , non-migrated cells were removed from the upper surface of the membrane by scrubbing using cotton tipped swabs. Cells on the lower surface of the membrane (migrated) were fixed in 100% methanol for 2 minutes, then stained with Giemsa for 1 hour. The Transwell inserts were washed in distilled water twice, air-dried overnight, and viewed and imaged under a Leica dissection microscope. Gene network analysis using NetWalk A modified version of NetWalk algorithm 44  was used to handle bi-cellular interaction. Briefly, we calculated t-values using limma by comparing 7-month-old  Nf1  SCs to 1-month-old  −/− Nf1  SCs and 7-month-old neurofibroma macrophages to 1-month-old DRG macrophages. The resulting t-values were transformed by quantile normalization to obtain identical distributions for two sets and used as node weights for the NetWalk analyses. −/− PEGylated interferon alpha-2b treatment PEGylated interferon alpha-2b was purchased at the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital (National Drug Code 00085132302) pharmacy. Each RediPen was brought to room temperature for at least 30 minutes. Contents (50 mcg per 0.5 ml) were diluted with sterile 1x phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) so that each 25 gram mouse received 10,000 I.U. in 100 μl 1X/week by subcutaneous injection, or a similar volume of vehicle 45 . One RediPen was used for injections on a single day. Volume was adjusted according to weight. Treatment was continued for 8 doses. We examined tumor bearing animals of both sexes for therapeutic response to PEGylated interferon alpha-2b (n = 19) as described, using volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate tumor growth 60 . Mice were monitored daily and weighed weekly; no mice lost >10% body weight or required sacrifice. At the end of the treatment trial, we removed neurofibromas and froze them at −80 °C. Mouse cytokine array analysis Mouse cytokine protein expressions were quantified using mouse cytokine array (panel A, R&D system, Minneapolis, MN). Briefly, proteins were extracted from  Nf1 fl/fl ;DhhCre  mouse neurofibromas and  Nf1  mouse sciatic nerves. Arrays were performed according to the instructions provided by R&D System on 200 μg lysate protein. The intensities of the white dots that were converted from the original black dots were measured using ImageJ software. fl/fl",Kwangmin Choi; Kakajan Komurov; Jonathan S Fletcher; Edwin Jousma; Jose A Cancelas; Jianqiang Wu; Nancy Ratner,Scientific reports,2017-03-03,10.1038/srep43315,minimal,True
PMID:28589254,Characterisation of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours in neurofibromatosis-1 using heterogeneity analysis of ,"PURPOSE: Measurement of heterogeneity in  METHODS:  RESULTS: There was a significant difference between benign and malignant tumours for all six first-order parameters (at 1.5 and 4 h; p < 0.0001), for second-order entropy (only at 4 h) and for all high-order features (at 1.5 h and 4 h, except contrast at 4 h; p < 0.0001-0.047). Similarly, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves was high (0.669-0.997, p < 0.05) for the same features as well as 1.5-h second-order entropy. No first-, second- or high-order feature performed better than maximum SUV (SUVmax) at differentiating benign from malignant tumours. CONCLUSIONS: ","Methods 
 18 F-FDG PET data from a cohort of 54 patients (24 female, 30 male, mean age 35.1 years) with neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1), and clinically suspected malignant transformation of neurofibromas into MPNSTs, were included. Scans were performed to a standard clinical protocol at 1.5 and 4 h post-injection. Six first-order [including three standardised uptake value (SUV) parameters], four second-order (derived from grey-level co-occurrence matrices) and four high-order (derived from neighbourhood grey-tone difference matrices) statistical features were calculated from tumour volumes of interest. Each patient had histological verification or at least 5 years clinical follow-up as the reference standard with regards to the characterisation of tumours as benign ( n  = 30) or malignant ( n  = 24). Patients and methods A cohort of 54 consecutive patients with NF1 and clinical suspicion of malignant transformation of symptomatic neurofibromas, referred from our national neurofibromatosis service for  18 F-FDG PET/CT scans, was identified. There were 30 male (mean age 34.7 years, range 12 to 73 years) and 24 female patients (mean age 35.5 years, range 9 to 86 years). An institutional review board waiver was obtained for retrospective analysis of these data. 
 18 F-FDG PET/CT scans were all acquired to the same protocol in the same institution on one of two scanners (Discovery VCT or DST, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) which were cross-calibrated to within 3% [ 15 ]. Patients were fasted for at least 6 h prior to administration of 350 (+/− 10%) MBq  18 F-FDG (scaled to body weight/70 in paediatric patients) and were only acquired if the blood glucose measurement was less than 10 mmol/l. Scans were acquired according to the institutional standard clinical protocol for NF1 patients with an acquisition at approximately 1.5 h (101.5 +/− 15 min) from the upper thigh to the base of skull followed by an acquisition at approximately 4 h (251.7 +/− 18.4 min) of the symptomatic tumour site only, all at 5 min per bed position [ 2 ]. Images were all reconstructed using an ordered subset expectation maximisation algorithm (2 iterations, 20 subsets) with a reconstructed slice thickness of 3.27 mm and pixel size 4.7 mm. The CT component of the scans was acquired at 120 kVp and 65 mAs without administration of oral or intravenous contrast agent. The reconstructed PET datasets were imported into in-house texture analysis software implemented in MATLAB (Release 2016a, The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). Voxel intensities within the symptomatic tumour VOI were resampled to yield 64 discrete bins. Whilst most patients had multiple neurofibromas, only the symptomatic tumours were analysed. Since many of the tumours showed only low-grade FDG uptake, it was not possible to adequately segment the tumour regions directly from the PET data by freehand or by using semi-automated methods such as percentage threshold or fuzzy locally adaptive Bayesian methods [ 16 ]. Regions of interest were, therefore, drawn on the corresponding CT images where tumours were more easily defined (Fig.  1 ) by an experienced operator with radiology and nuclear medicine training and over 20 years experience. To assess inter-observer variability, a random subset of 16 patients had VOIs defined on 1.5- and 4-h scans by a separate operator blinded to the initial observer measurements and clinical data.

 18 F-FDG PET and CT ( left ) with corresponding images with ROIs ( right ). A symptomatic but benign left posterior thigh neurofibroma (SUVmax = 2.83) As well as SUVs (mean, maximum and peak, all normalised to body weight in kilogrammes), three first-order (SD, entropy and uniformity), four second-order GLCM parameters (contrast, entropy, uniformity and homogeneity) and four high-order NGTDM parameters (coarseness, contrast, busyness and complexity) were calculated from the resulting VOIs. Second-order features were calculated from GLCMs measuring the grey-level distribution between pairs of voxels and high-order features were derived from three-dimensional matrices taking into consideration neighbouring voxels in adjacent planes. All these features have been previously described in detail [ 13 ,  14 ] and the chosen parameters have previously shown utility and/or robustness when used in clinical  18 F-FDG PET data of cancers [ 17 – 22 ]. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (v22, Chicago, IL, USA) and MedCalc (v16.8.4, Ostend, Belgium) software. The data distributions were tested for normality using the Shapiro–Wilk test. As data were not normally distributed differences between benign and malignant tumours were tested with the Mann–Whitney U test for each parameter and correlations between parameters with Spearman correlation. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were also used to compare the ability of each parameter to classify tumours as benign or malignant and the area under ROC curves (AUROC) were calculated. Comparisons between AUROC were made as described by DeLong et al. [ 23 ]. Separate assessment was made by combining SUVmax with other parameters that did not show a correlation with SUVmax. Statistical significance was assumed when  p  < 0.05. Inter-observer variation was assessed with intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs).",Gary J R Cook; Eitan Lovat; Muhammad Siddique; Vicky Goh; Rosalie Ferner; Victoria S Warbey,European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,2017-10,10.1007/s00259-017-3733-1,minimal,True
PMID:22108604,Exploring the somatic NF1 mutational spectrum associated with NF1 cutaneous neurofibromas.,"Neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1), caused by heterozygous inactivation of the NF1 tumour suppressor gene, is associated with the development of benign and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs). Although numerous germline NF1 mutations have been identified, relatively few somatic NF1 mutations have been described in neurofibromas. Here we have screened 109 cutaneous neurofibromas, excised from 46 unrelated NF1 patients, for somatic NF1 mutations. NF1 mutation screening (involving loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) analysis, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and DNA sequencing) identified 77 somatic NF1 point mutations, of which 53 were novel. LOH spanning the NF1 gene region was evident in 25 neurofibromas, but in contrast to previous data from MPNSTs, it was absent at the TP53, CDKN2A and RB1 gene loci. Analysis of DNA/RNA from neurofibroma-derived Schwann cell cultures revealed NF1 mutations in four tumours whose presence had been overlooked in the tumour DNA. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that four of seven novel somatic NF1 missense mutations (p.A330T, p.Q519P, p.A776T, p.S1463F) could be of functional/clinical significance. Functional analysis confirmed this prediction for p.S1463F, located within the GTPase-activating protein-related domain, as this mutation resulted in a 150-fold increase in activated GTP-bound Ras. Comparison of the relative frequencies of the different types of somatic NF1 mutation observed with those of their previously reported germline counterparts revealed significant (P=0.001) differences. Although non-identical somatic mutations involving either the same or adjacent nucleotides were identified in three pairs of tumours from the same patients (P<0.0002), no association was noted between the type of germline and somatic NF1 lesion within the same individual.",,Laura Thomas; Gill Spurlock; Claire Eudall; Nick S Thomas; Matthew Mort; Stephen E Hamby; Nadia Chuzhanova; Hilde Brems; Eric Legius; David N Cooper; Meena Upadhyaya,European journal of human genetics : EJHG,2012-04,10.1038/ejhg.2011.207,abstract_only,False
PMID:31053133,Burden of adult neurofibromatosis 1: development and validation of a burden assessment tool.,"BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a common genetic neurocutaneous disease, with an autosomal dominant inheritance mode. Quality of life has been shown impaired in NF1, due to severe complications, cosmetic features, and uncertainty about the disorder. METHODS: This study sought to develop a self-administered questionnaire in French to assess the burden of NF1 (BoN), then translate and linguistically and cross-culturally validate it into American English, standardized methodology applied, as outlined in the report. RESULTS: Based on several discussions with NF1 patients, a 17-item conceptual questionnaire was first produced. Of the 91 NF1 adult patients who responded to the conceptual questionnaire, 65 (64.6% females) were accessible. Subsequent confirmatory analyses generated a 15-item questionnaire grouped into four domains, demonstrating internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha: 091), discriminant validity, and high reliability. The BoN was likewise shown to significantly correlate with other validated questionnaires, such as Dermatology Life Quality Index, Perceived Stress Scale, and SF12 mental score, indicating good external validity. CONCLUSIONS: BoN is a specific tool for assessing the burden that NF1 generates on many practical aspects of the patient daily activities, beyond the notion of quality of life"". Given the increasing relevance that regulatory authorities attribute to patient-reported outcomes, the BoN questionnaire provides such supplementary information while accounting for the burden of NF1 patients in the broadest sense.","Methods This study sought to develop a self-administered questionnaire in French to assess the burden of NF1 (BoN), then translate and linguistically and cross-culturally validate it into American English, standardized methodology applied, as outlined in the report. Methods The self-administered BoN questionnaire was developed using standard methodology comprising three phases, namely exploratory, development, and validation [ 24 ]. This questionnaire was developed by a multidisciplinary working group comprising experts in questionnaire design/development, such as healthcare professionals like physicians and psychologists, experts in NF1, such as social workers and dermatologists, as well as experts in QoL and patient-reported outcomes. The questionnaire was conventionally created in a question and answer format. Response modalities were determined via consensus among the experts, and took the form of a 6-point Likert scale: “never” (0), “rarely” (1), “sometimes” (2), “often” (3), “very often” (4), and “constantly” (5). To limit missing data, we also considered a “not applicable” (0). Instructions in the preamble state that the questions relate to the previous 30 days. Subjects from the age of 15 could complete the questionnaire and had the option to indicate “not concerned” for non-applicable questions. Exploratory phase The initial step involved several one-to-one interviews between the dermatologist, psychologist, social worker, and expert in patient-reported outcomes with patients suffering from NF1 to comprehensively collect the patients’ perceptions and complaints. By analyzing these interviews, the most relevant concepts were identified. A semi-structured questionnaire was then elaborated comprising specific themes in a question/answer format, including closed-ended questions with a choice of predetermined answers, as well as open-ended questions allowing unrestricted answers. The final choice of questions was made by the working group. Development phase During this phase, the conceptual questionnaire was administered to a sample of subjects suffering from the disease. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted to highlight the underlying constructs, assigning each item to its respective domain, with orthogonal varimax rotation performed to verify whether the hypothetical constructs were interrelated. To evaluate the questionnaire’s internal consistency and confirm its reliability, the item homogeneity in each dimension was tested using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient [ 25 ]. Higher order factor confirmatory analysis was performed to confirm that the dimensions created could be combined into one single score. PROC CALIS procedure, SAS 9.4, was employed. The criteria for the model’s goodness-of-fit were defined as a Bentler comparative fit index > 0.90, and Bentler-Bonett non-normed fit index > 0.90 [ 26 ], with root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) close to 0.05 or at the very least less than 0.08. External validity To assess the questionnaire’s external validity, all participants were asked to complete three previously validated self-administered questionnaires: the D ermatology Life Quality Index  [DLQI] questionnaire, The DLQI questionnaire is the first dermatology-specific instrument designed to assess the impact of skin diseases on patient QoL [ 27 ,  28 ]. Intended for adults and patients aged over 16 years, DLQI has proven a simple, practical, and validated questionnaire that grades QoL, the DLQI score being the sum of all scores (0–30), with high scores reflecting poor QoL. The PSS is the most widely used psychological instrument for measuring the perception of stress. Composed of 10 items rated from “never” to “often”, PSS measures the degree to which situations in one’s life are perceived as stressful [ 29 ,  30 ]. The total score ranges from 10 to 50, and the higher the score, the higher the stress. The SF12 is a short version of the SF-36, namely a generic instrument to measure population health [ 31 ], with a physical composite score and mental composite score calculated based on 12 questions, and the higher the score, the better the physical and the mental quality of life, respectively. Concurrent validity was established by calculating Pearson correlations between the BoN and the other three validated questionnaires. The data were analyzed using SAS software Version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA), with the significance level set at 0.05. Test-retest analysis To assess reproducibility, a test-retest analysis was conducted, with a group of subjects asked to complete the questionnaire twice, with at least a 10-day interval in-between. Translation, cross-cultural adaptation, and cognitive debriefing While the original BoN questionnaire was developed in French, previously-validated methodology was applied to generate an US English-language version, involving cross-cultural validation [ 32 ]. The nine steps involved are summarized in Table  1 . A number of changes could be implemented throughout the validation process, so as to further improve the initial idiomatic draft.

PMID:24815379,Application of COLD-PCR for improved detection of NF2 mosaic mutations.,"Somatic mosaicism represents the coexistence of two or more cell populations with different genotypes in one person, and it is involved in >30 monogenic disorders. Somatic mosaicism characterizes approximately 25% to 33% of patients with de novo neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). The identification of mosaicism is crucial to patients and their families because the clinical course of the disease and its transmission risk is influenced by the degree and distribution of mutated cells. Moreover, in NF2, the capability of discriminating patients with mosaicism is especially important to make differential diagnosis with schwannomatosis. However, the identification of mosaic variants is considerably difficult, and the development of specific molecular techniques to detect low levels of unknown molecular alterations is required. Co-amplification at lower denaturation temperature (COLD)-PCR has been described as a powerful method to selectively amplify minority alleles from mixtures of wild-type and mutation-containing sequences. Here, we applied COLD-PCR to molecular analysis of patients with NF2 mosaicism. With the use of COLD-PCR, followed by direct sequencing, we were able to detect NF2 mutations in blood DNA of three patients with NF2 mosaicism. Our study has shown the capability of COLD-PCR in enriching low-represented mutated allele in blood DNA sample, making it usable for molecular diagnosis of patients with mosaicism.",,Irene Paganini; Irene Mancini; Marta Baroncelli; Guido Arena; Francesca Gensini; Laura Papi; Roberta Sestini,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,2014-07,10.1016/j.jmoldx.2014.02.007,abstract_only,False
PMID:33082502,Image segmentation of plexiform neurofibromas from a deep neural network using multiple b-value diffusion data.,"We assessed the accuracy of semi-automated tumor volume maps of plexiform neurofibroma (PN) generated by a deep neural network, compared to manual segmentation using diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data. NF1 Patients were recruited from a phase II clinical trial for the treatment of PN. Multiple b-value DWI was imaged over the largest PN. All DWI datasets were registered and intensity normalized prior to segmentation with a multi-spectral neural network classifier (MSNN). Manual volumes of PN were performed on 3D-T2 images registered to diffusion images and compared to MSNN volumes with the Sørensen-Dice coefficient. Intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) parameters were calculated from resulting volumes. 35 MRI scans were included from 14 subjects. Sørensen-Dice coefficient between the semi-automated and manual segmentation was 0.77 ± 0.016. Perfusion fraction (f) was significantly higher for tumor versus normal tissue (0.47 ± 0.42 vs. 0.30 ± 0.22, p = 0.02), similarly, true diffusion (D) was significantly higher for PN tumor versus normal (0.0018 ± 0.0003 vs. 0.0012 ± 0.0002, p < 0.0001). By contrast, the pseudodiffusion coefficient (D*) was significantly lower for PN tumor versus normal (0.024 ± 0.01 vs. 0.031 ± 0.005, p < 0.0001). Volumes generated by a neural network from multiple diffusion data on PNs demonstrated good correlation with manual volumes. IVIM analysis of multiple b-value diffusion data demonstrates significant differences between PN and normal tissue.","Methods The Indiana University Institutional Review Board approved this prospective study. All NF1 subjects participated with informed consent in a phase II clinical trial of imatinib mesylate (Imatinib) for the treatment of PNs . Inclusion criteria were NF1 patients with at least one plexiform neurofibroma greater than 1 cm in a single dimension, an MRI scan with multiple b-value diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) at baseline, and at least one follow-up MRI at 6-month intervals. All MRI sequences were performed on a 1.5 T scanner (Magnetom Avanto, Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) and included 3D T2-weighted spectral attenuated inversion recovery (SPAIR) sequences in the coronal plane (TR = 2200, TE = 200, 1 mm slice thickness, 0 mm gap, FA = 120°, matrix = 448 × 450) as well as diffusion weighted sequences in the axial or sagittal plane with multiple b-values (b = 0, 50, 150, 200, 400, 600, TR = 2137, TE = 68.4, ST = 5 mm, gap = 6.5 mm, FA = 90°) focused on the largest PN. Sagittal or axial orientation was chosen on diffusion weighted sequences for maximum in-plane coverage of the largest PN. For the purposes of comparison to diffusion weighted datasets, modified SPAIR images were reformatted in the same plane as the diffusion dataset at matching 5 mm slice thickness and truncated to match the diffusion anatomical coverage. 6 Neural network machine learning All diffusion datasets were registered to the baseline time point for each subject using the normalized entropy mutual information method described previously . Images were intensity normalized over the interval [0.0, 1.0] by dividing each image volume by the maximum value of the B0 image set (Fig.  7 1 ). Using the multispectral neural network (MSNN) modeling tool available in Analyze 12.0 (AnalyzeDirect, Overland Park, KS) , model priors for each “class” were constructed by defining regions of interest for normal (i.e. non-tumor) tissue, NF1 lesions, and “background” (i.e. remainder) that were extracted across all registered normalized multi-b value (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 400, 600) DWI images. The selection of hidden layers was based on an empirical analysis of the model, where the minimum probability was fixed at 0.1, alpha probability was set to 0.25, and epochs set at 200 according to the guidance from the manufacturer. Under these conditions, the number of hidden layers was varied systematically from 3 to 20 layers and the degree of segmentation assessed for over classification. Once the number of layers were selected, the number of epochs were systematically varied from 100 to 1000, keeping the number of hidden layers, minimum probability, and alpha probability constant. Once optimized, the multi-b value voxel series for each class were then applied to a feed-forward neural network consisting of 15 hidden layers each having 3 nodes (Appendix Fig.  8 8 ), for training purposes, with 200 epochs. In addition, the recommended minimum probability of 0.1 and an alpha probability of 0.25 were used for voxel classification. The minimum probability represents the likelihood that any given voxel belongs to a defined class; voxels with values less than this probability are left unclassified. Similarly, the alpha probability is a confidence-weighting parameter which controls the strength of the relaxation during iterative optimization. Due to design limitations of the MSNN tool, only a single training set could be defined as part of the model priors; therefore, we randomly selected an NF1 subject from the population to serve as the training set for all subsequent segmentation, and was excluded from the remaining analysis. Post-training, classification of the remaining normalized multi-b value images for each subject were then performed generating 3D object maps for each region in the image series. Each resulting volume map identified as tumor by the neural network was then reviewed and manually edited for obvious erroneous anatomy by a trained imaging scientist (SP) which commonly included bladder, brain, eyes, and spinal fluid (Fig.  2 ). These misclassified anatomical structures were excluded from the tumor volume. Figure 1 Image processing workflow for Multi-Spectral Neural Network classification. DWI MRI image series from baseline and follow up scans are imported into the Clinical Trials Processor for de-identification and then registered using the normalized entropy mutual information method described previously . Post registration, maximum and minimum intensities were computed, images intensity normalized over the interval [0.0, 1.0], and images were segmented using the MSNN method. Object maps were then individually inspected for classification errors, cleaned (if required), and then submitted to volumetric and IVIM diffusion modeling. 7 Figure 2 Representative normalized sagittal images of cervical DWI MRI: ( A ) b = 0 DWI image (unclassified); ( B ) Initial Classified Object Map based on the MSNN model described in Fig.  1 ; normal tissue (green) and tumor (blue); ( C ) Misclassified structures such as Brain (red) and Orbits (yellow arrow) which require exclusion from tumor volume; and ( D ) Quality control corrected normal (green) and tumor (blue). Manual segmentation analysis As a comparison to manual segmentation, a neuroradiology fellow (JK) manually traced all plexiform neurofibromas on the registered SPAIR images in consensus with the senior neuroradiologist (CH). Measurements were made on a commercially available image analysis software (MIM Encore 6.9.3, MIM Software INC, Cleveland, OH,  https://www.mimsoftware.com/nuclear_medicine/encore ) using a freehand ROI tool. The volumes of the manual measurements were summated for each MRI exam and used for analysis. Bland–Altman plots were performed between the MSNN volume results and corresponding manual segmentation results. Linear regression and Sørensen–Dice coefficient was used to analyze correlation and concordance between manual tumor volumes and neural network results. IVIM analysis Neural network generated volume maps were also used to generate average b-value series for IVIM analysis according to the bi-exponential model proposed by Le Bihan et al . : 9 1 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

IVIM parameters were compared across available scanning time points at baseline, 6 months and 12 months, between PN tumors and normal structures excluding the bladder, brain, eyes and spinal fluid.

PMID:23358504,Integrated proteomics identified novel activation of dynein IC2-GR-COX-1 signaling in neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) disease model cells.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor gene product, neurofibromin, functions in part as a Ras-GAP, and though its loss is implicated in the neuronal abnormality of NF1 patients, its precise cellular function remains unclear. To study the molecular mechanism of NF1 pathogenesis, we prepared NF1 gene knockdown (KD) PC12 cells, as a NF1 disease model, and analyzed their molecular (gene and protein) expression profiles with a unique integrated proteomics approach, comprising iTRAQ, 2D-DIGE, and DNA microarrays, using an integrated protein and gene expression analysis chart (iPEACH). In NF1-KD PC12 cells showing abnormal neuronal differentiation after NGF treatment, of 3198 molecules quantitatively identified and listed in iPEACH, 97 molecules continuously up- or down-regulated over time were extracted. Pathway and network analysis further revealed overrepresentation of calcium signaling and transcriptional regulation by glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the up-regulated protein set, whereas nerve system development was overrepresented in the down-regulated protein set. The novel up-regulated network we discovered, ""dynein IC2-GR-COX-1 signaling,"" was then examined in NF1-KD cells. Validation studies confirmed that NF1 knockdown induces altered splicing and phosphorylation patterns of dynein IC2 isomers, up-regulation and accumulation of nuclear GR, and increased COX-1 expression in NGF-treated cells. Moreover, the neurite retraction phenotype observed in NF1-KD cells was significantly recovered by knockdown of the dynein IC2-C isoform and COX-1. In addition, dynein IC2 siRNA significantly inhibited nuclear translocation and accumulation of GR and up-regulation of COX-1 expression. These results suggest that dynein IC2 up-regulates GR nuclear translocation and accumulation, and subsequently causes increased COX-1 expression, in this NF1 disease model. Our integrated proteomics strategy, which combines multiple approaches, demonstrates that NF1-related neural abnormalities are, in part, caused by up-regulation of dynein IC2-GR-COX-1 signaling, which may be a novel therapeutic target for NF1.",,Mio Hirayama; Daiki Kobayashi; Souhei Mizuguchi; Takashi Morikawa; Megumi Nagayama; Uichi Midorikawa; Masayo M Wilson; Akiko N Nambu; Akiyasu C Yoshizawa; Shin Kawano; Norie Araki,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,2013-05,10.1074/mcp.M112.024802,abstract_only,False
PMID:20049725,Integrative genomic analyses of neurofibromatosis tumours identify SOX9 as a biomarker and survival gene.,"Understanding the biological pathways critical for common neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) peripheral nerve tumours is essential, as there is a lack of tumour biomarkers, prognostic factors and therapeutics. We used gene expression profiling to define transcriptional changes between primary normal Schwann cells (n = 10), NF1-derived primary benign neurofibroma Schwann cells (NFSCs) (n = 22), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (MPNST) cell lines (n = 13), benign neurofibromas (NF) (n = 26) and MPNST (n = 6). Dermal and plexiform NFs were indistinguishable. A prominent theme in the analysis was aberrant differentiation. NFs repressed gene programs normally active in Schwann cell precursors and immature Schwann cells. MPNST signatures strongly differed; genes up-regulated in sarcomas were significantly enriched for genes activated in neural crest cells. We validated the differential expression of 82 genes including the neural crest transcription factor SOX9 and SOX9 predicted targets. SOX9 immunoreactivity was robust in NF and MPSNT tissue sections and targeting SOX9 - strongly expressed in NF1-related tumours - caused MPNST cell death. SOX9 is a biomarker of NF and MPNST, and possibly a therapeutic target in NF1.","MATERIALS AND METHODS NF acquisition Diagnosis of NF1 used published criteria (Gutmann et al,  1997 ). We snap froze tumour tissues at the time of surgery from patients undergoing treatment at Massachusetts General Hospital. Tissues were obtained from the Neuro-Oncology Tissue Repository at Massachusetts General Hospital in accordance with IRB-approved protocols. We obtained blocks of corresponding paraffin-embedded tumours from MGH-pathology files. Histological review of all specimens was performed by a neuropathologist (ASR) and tumours were classified and graded using current WHO classification. For Schwann cell isolation, we froze tumour in 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), 40% foetal bovine serum (FBS), 10% dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) or directly cultured cells. Live purified Schwann cell cultures were shipped to Cincinnati Children's Hospital, incubated in fresh media until 70–80% confluent and cells flash-frozen prior to RNA isolation. Schwann cell isolation We generated NHSCs from trauma victims (Casella et al,  1996 ), and Schwann cells from dermal NFs as described previously (Serra et al,  2000 ). After mechanical trituration and digestion with enzymes, we resuspended cells in Schwann cell media (SCM/DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, antibiotics, 0.5 mM IBMX, 10 nM β-heregulin, 0.5 µM forskolin and 2.5 µg/ml insulin) and seeded onto poly- l -lysine and laminin coated plates. For  NF1 +/− Schwann cells, we kept forskolin constant. For  NF1 −/− cells, we provided forskolin in pulses of 1 day every 3–4 days in SCM-no forskolin. We assessed the purity of Schwann cell cultures by immunofluorescent staining with an S-100β antibody (Serra et al,  2000 ). After 3–5 passages, >95% pure Schwann cell cultures were obtained. When a somatic mutation of a tumour was identified, we assessed purity according to genotype ( Table S10  of Supporting Information). In  NF1 −/− Schwann cell cultures, complete loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was observed. We generated plexiform NFSC cultures, 70–95% S100β-positive, as described previously (Wallace et al,  2000 ). We maintained cells in media lacking forskolin to enrich for  NF1 −/− cells, and harvested for RNA after 4–6 passages. NF1 mutation analysis We carried out mutational analysis of  NF1  in Schwann cells from dermal and plexiform NFs and in solid tumours as described previously. Additional details are provided in  Table S10  of Supporting Information (Ars et al,  2000 ; Serra et al,  2001 ; Upadhyaya et al,  2006 ). MPNST cell cultures We maintained MPNST cell lines ST88-14, STS26T, S520, S462, 88-3, 90-8 and YST1 as described previously (Miller et al,  2006 ). We isolated RNA from cells under standard growth conditions for each cell line. RNA isolation and microarray hybridization We isolated total RNA from frozen tissue and cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and verified RNA integrity with an Agilent Bioanalyser 2100 (with typical 28S/18S ratios = 2 ± 0.1). We generated biotinylated cDNA probes from a single round of DNA displacement synthesis amplification of 20 ng total RNA (Ovation Biotin RNA Amplification and Labelling System; NuGen) for hybridization to the whole-genome Affymetrix GeneChip HU133 Plus 2.0 using the Affymetrix protocol. We used an Affymetrix Gene Array scanner and GeneChip Operating Software V1.4 to scan and quantify GeneChips using default settings. We processed 86 samples in 9 batches, including: 9 universal tissue reference samples, 10 NHSC samples, 11 dNFSC samples, 11 pNFSC samples, 13 MPNST cell line samples, 13 dNF, 13 pNF and 6 MPNSTs. We used Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0 to generate ‘CEL’ files for each sample that were normalized using the Robust Multichip Analysis (RMA) algorithm as implemented in Bioconductor/R (Irizarry et al,  2003 ). Microarray data quality control and power analysis We assessed array images for spatial defect using the GEODEX (Kim et al,  2006 ) and a deleted residuals approach (Persson et al,  2005 ). Chips with high spatial artefacts or large deviations from outliers ( n  = 2) were discarded. One normalization control sample failed quality control and we re-ran the entire batch of samples. Data analysis strategy We used a custom GeneChip library file (CDF) based on Refseq target definitions (Hs133P REFSEQ Version 8) to provide accurate interpretation of GeneChip data (Dai et al,  2005 ). To identify gene expression changes relative to NHSCs, we applied a two-stage referencing strategy: we set the normalized gene expression level value for each transcript in each sample to its ratio relative to the expression of that transcript's measurement in the universal tissue reference; then, we set the normalized gene expression level value for each transcript in each sample to its ratio relative to the median expression of that transcript's measurements across NHSCs. An ANOVA ( p  ≤ 0.001) was used to compare NHSCs, dNFSCs, pNFSCs and MPNST cell lines. Statistical comparisons and data visualization were performed using GeneSpring GX v7.3.1 (Agilent Technologies). We corrected results from the primary analysis for multiple testing effects by applying the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate correction (Benjamini et al,  2001 ) (FDR ≤ 0.001). Transcripts were assigned to empirically defined expression patterns using the  k -means clustering algorithm, which generally finds a clustering solution with a smaller within-cluster sum of distances (meaning a more homogeneous cluster) than hierarchical clustering techniques. We used Pearson correlation as a similarity measure and iteratively clustered genes until convergence, then tested an additional five random clusters to ensure that the optimal clustering solution had been identified. To identify genes sharing common gene expression patterns in cultured cells and solid tumours, we re-clustered each cluster across NHSCs, NFs and MPNSTs. We identified three principle patterns of gene expression and genes were assigned to each using  k -means clustering. We pooled sub-clusters displaying a similar pattern of gene expression in NFs and MPNSTs as the original cultured cell cluster with all other similarly expressed sub-clusters. A total of 1,708 transcripts were obtained that were subsequently used to generate a heat map including the entire sample set. We identified statistically over-represented Gene Ontologies and both KEGG and BioCarta pathways ( p  < 0.05) using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) 2007 at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) (Huang da et al,  2007 ). We used the Gene Association to Anatomic and Clinical Abnormalities (GATACA) web server to select genes based upon association with nerve development, NF1 or MPNST. Schwann cell development orthologues comparison We used a data set in which Schwann cells were isolated from mouse embryos using PLP promoter-driven GFP at various stages of development (Buchstaller et al,  2004 ), and re-analysed the files processed by the GEO database-deposited Microarray Suite (Affymetrix). Probe sets were normalized per chip by a median intensity distribution and then referenced to the median of each probeset across the 19 microarrays in the data set. Probe sets were filtered for those identified by Microarray Suite as ‘Present’ in ≥2 of the 19 arrays, resulting in 8,617 probe sets. An ANOVA ( p  ≤ 0.2) was used to identify the differential expression between E9, E12, E14, E16, E18 and P0. We corrected the results for multiple testing effects by applying the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate correction (FDR ≤ 0.2). The 4,750 identified probe sets were subjected to hierarchical tree clustering using Pearson correlation similarity measure for genes (average linkage) and distance correlation similarity measure for samples (average linkage). Three major clusters were identified with dominant expression at E9 (neural crest), E12–E14 (Schwann cell precursor) and E18–P0 (immature Schwann cell) (Fig S1 of Supporting Information). We eliminated redundant probe sets, lack of corresponding gene orthologues and platform-specific gene representation differences using orthologue gene mapping, and then tabulated the overlap between each developmental signature and each cluster from the NF1 tumour signature. Contingency tables were constructed and we performed Fisher's exact test with  R  to identify developmental signatures that were statistically significant. The paper explained PROBLEM: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common inherited human diseases worldwide. Effective therapies are lacking. Peripheral nerve sheath tumours (neurofibromas) are the hallmark of NF1. They consist of benign dermal and plexiform subtypes, but plexiform neurofibroma can transform to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (MPNST), a highly aggressive, life-threatening sarcoma. Neurofibromas are composed of multiple cell types, including Schwann cells, the pathogenic cell type of NF1. The molecular changes that drive tumourigenesis are largely unknown. RESULTS: The authors used DNA microarrays to profile the gene expression in normal Schwann cells, Schwann cells cultured from primary benign neurofibromas (dermal and plexiform subtypes), MPNST cell lines and solid tumours. It was found that neurofibromas repress gene programmes normally expressed in late-developing immature Schwann cells, while MPNSTs activate gene programmes normally expressed earlier in the development at the neural crest stage. Strong expression of the transcription factor SOX9 is seen in neurofibroma and MPNST tissue sections, while schwannomas show weak or absent expression. Synovial sarcomas, which may histologically mimic MPNST, are mainly negative. Reduction of SOX9 expression in MPNST cell lines causes cell death. IMPACT: SOX9 expression provides a biomarker of neurofibroma and MPNST. Therapeutics aimed at decreasing SOX9 expression or SOX9 transcriptional targets represent a strategy for killing MPNST cells. SOX9 target gene identification We used Genome TraFac 3  for genome-wide detection of compositionally similar  cis -clusters in gene orthologues between mouse and human to determine putative SOX9 target genes, identifying SOX9  cis -elements within orthologue-conserved regions (≥70% sequence similarity based on BlastZ alignment) upstream of each first exon in 2,000 flanking basepairs (Jegga et al,  2007 ). We identified 394 unique genes containing potential SOX9 binding sites and transcripts dysregulated in NF-related cultures and tumours. We used Fisher's exact test to calculate the statistical significance of over-represented SOX9 target genes in the gene list. qPCR We conducted cDNA synthesis (Invitrogen Superscript II) and qPCR (ABI 7500 Sequence Detection System) as described previously (Miller et al,  2006 ). Primer sequences for target validation are shown in  Table S11  of Supporting Information. For technical validation of microarray data, a result of ≥ ± 2-fold in the same direction was considered as confirmation compared to expression of β-actin ( Table S7  of Supporting Information). Western blot analysis We created cell lysates and conducted Western blotting as described previously (Miller et al,  2006 ), probed membranes with anti-SOX9 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; 1:700), then re-probed with anti-β-actin (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. #4967) as a loading control. We detected signals using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (BioRad; Hercules, CA) and the ECL Plus developing system (Amersham Biosciences; Piscataway, NJ). Immunohistochemistry We performed SOX9 immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections with polyclonal anti-SOX9 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Antigen retrieval was achieved with microwaving in sodium citrate (pH 6), followed by incubation with the primary antibody overnight at 4°C (1:75) and visualization with an avidin–biotin complex (Vectastatin Elite ABC kit; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). We scored SOX9 immunostaining semi-quantitatively for the number of positive cells, as the staining intensity was similar in all samples (strong). The number of positive cells was scored as <25% (+1, some), 25–75% (+2, many) and >75% (+3, maximum). Immunofluorescent detection of SOX9 in cultured cells was conducted using a 1:200 dilution of primary anti-SOX9 antibody followed by a TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody and 4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) visualization of nuclei. Viral infection For lentiviral shRNA infection, we infected MPNST cells at 70–90% confluence with lentiviral particles containing shRNAs targeting SOX9 (Open Biosystems; TRC library) or GFP (Addgene). The CCHMC Viral Vector Core 4  produced virus using a four plasmid packaging system. We incubated lentiviral particles with the MPNST cells (MOI ∼ 10) in the presence of polybrene (8 µg/ml; Sigma) for 24 h followed by selection in puromycin at a concentration (2 ug/ml) that killed uninfected cells within 3 days. For SOX9 and GFP adenoviral infections (Paul et al,  2003 ), we incubated viral particles with NHSCs or NFSCs (MOI = 300–500) for 2 h, replaced the growth medium and harvested cells for RNA isolation 48 or 120 h post-infection. MTS assay We plated MPNST cells (4 × 10 3 ) in triplicate and incubated overnight in a 96-well plate for infection with shGFP or shSOX9 lentiviral particles as described previously. Cells were maintained in the presence or absence of puromycin (2µg/ml) to account for infection efficiency. We conducted MTS assays for viable cell number on days 3–7 post-infection using the CellTiter 96® Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) staining for cell death We plated MPNST cells (2 × 10 4 ) in quadruplicate wells of LabTek chamber slides (Nalge-Nunce International), and then infected them with shSOX9 or shGFP lentiviral particles. After 3 days in the presence or absence of puromycin, we fixed cells in 4% paraformaldehyde for the detection of nuclear DNA fragmentation with the DeadEnd Fluorometric TUNEL System (Promega; Madison, WI). One well without terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase was used as the negative control. We counted cells in five random fields in triplicate wells. We expressed Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) positive apoptotic cells as a percentage of total cells visualized by DAPI.",Shyra J Miller; Walter J Jessen; Tapan Mehta; Atira Hardiman; Emily Sites; Sergio Kaiser; Anil G Jegga; Hua Li; Meena Upadhyaya; Marco Giovannini; David Muir; Margaret R Wallace; Eva Lopez; Eduard Serra; G Petur Nielsen; Conxi Lazaro; Anat Stemmer-Rachamimov; Grier Page; Bruce J Aronow; Nancy Ratner,EMBO molecular medicine,2009-07,10.1002/emmm.200900027,minimal,True
PMID:41564118,Immortalization and characterization of Schwann cell lines derived from NF1-associated cutaneous neurofibromas.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant condition in which patients are heterozygous for a disruptive pathogenic variant in the NF1 gene. The most characteristic feature of the condition NF1 is the neurofibroma, a benign, multi-cellular tumor which initiates when a cell of the Schwann cell lineage gains a somatic pathogenic variant of the other NF1 allele. Neurofibromas developing at nerve termini in the skin are termed ""cutaneous"" neurofibromas (cNFs), while those developing within larger nerves are termed ""plexiform."" Most patients develop cNFs beginning in late childhood or early adulthood, continuing throughout life at variable rates. Some patients may develop only a few cNFs, while others suffer from thousands. There are no reliably effective physical or pharmaceutical therapies besides surgical removal. Although these are not life-threatening, they are disfiguring and can interfere with normal life functions. To provide a resource for research, we developed short-term cNF Schwann cell cultures from NF1 patients, from which we subsequently established the first semi-immortalized cNF cell lines through transduction with wild-type human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and murine cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (mCdk4) genes. Here we present molecular, cellular, and functional characterization of these cell lines, which will be of utility for investigating and developing NF1 cNF therapies.","Materials and methods Subjects. This study utilized data from a total of 14 de-identified cell lines from 10 individuals with NF1, and one who was too young to meet diagnostic criteria. For 8 of these individuals (11 cell lines), written consent had been previously obtained under a prior protocol (41–1992) or a data/tissue bank protocol (2017–00320) (from parent/guardian in the case of minors), the latter of which also subsumed the data/samples from the prior protocol in 2013. Both were approved by the University of Florida IRB. The bank contains clinical and experimental data, and samples (primary, and derived materials such as nucleic acids and cell lines) from people with NF1 or other genetic conditions. The University of Florida IRB also approved the study here (2017–02709) to analyze de-identified materials from the bank, waiving consent, which occurred on multiple occasions between August 1, 2018, and August 17, 2023. The three other additional lines (i18cNF, i21cNF, i28cNF) were from NF1 cNFs obtained and cultured with approval of the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Germans Trias i Pujol Hospital, Badalona (Barcelona), Spain (protocol PI-18–054, PI ES), and de-identified prior to inclusion in this study. Written informed consent form of NF1 patients in Spain was previously obtained for another protocol with permission for future research, accessed for this study on August 23, 2019. There was no demographic information for the subjects behind the cell lines, although biological gender was discovered from karyotyping and included in  Table 1 . 10.1371/journal.pone.0340183.t001 Table 1 Data on 14 immortalized cell lines with details on their histologic, NF1 variant, passage and staining properties. Final row includes data on a subcloned heterozygous line (icNF98.4c). * indicates cell lines that were included in genomic profiling experiments. Excluded cell lines were not genomically profiled for the following reasons: icNF97.5 – the patient doesn’t meet diagnostic criteria for NF1, and the only germline mutation we can find seemed to be a silent variant via direct sequencing; icNF18.1 and icNF09.5 (same patient) - icNF18.1 is mostly heterozygous and the somatic mutation is in low frequency, we were unable to observe a second NF1 hit on icNF09.5 via direct sequencing; icNF93.1a - heterozygous and unable to observe a second NF1 hit via direct sequencing. ** morphology defined per rubric from Ortonne et al., 2018 (Neurology 91 (Suppl 1):S5-S13).

For three cNF (18cNF, 21cNF, 28cNF) initial SCs were isolated as described elsewhere [ 13 ]. hTERT and mCdk4 lentiviral vector transduction The vector pTYcPPT, containing the elongation factor 1 alpha promoter [ 22 ], was used to separately clone  hTERT  (full length human telomerase reverse transcriptase cDNA) and  mCdk4  (murine  Cdk4  full-length cDNA). Based on previous experience creating pNF immortalized cells [ 20 ], cNF cultures (10,000 cells) were transduced using both lentiviruses simultaneously with 10 multiplicity of infection (MOI) for both viruses, for 12–18 hours with 10 µg/ml polybrene. Media was then changed, and cells were maintained on 0.1% collagen 1-treated plates (Sigma, C8919) in high glucose DMEM with L-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1X Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Fisher 15240062), 5 µg/ml Plasmocin (Invivogen, ANT-MPP), and 50 ng/µl neuregulin (R&D Systems 396-HB-050). These cultures were expanded and passaged; when cells continued to proliferate beyond the passage at which the original primary culture senesced, the cell line was labeled “immortalized” and was designated with an “i” in front of the culture name. Cell line authentication and characterization of proliferation, apoptosis, karyotype, and S100B expression The cell lines had variable capacity to divide before senescing, ranging from passage 22 (p22) to passage 42 (p42) or further passages. They were first screened for the ability to survive and proliferate without a substrate and/or neuregulin. The cell lines were also evaluated for apoptotic rate (TUNEL staining), proliferation rate (BrdU incorporation), and S100B expression, using previously published methods [ 21 ]. Cell authentication using STR genotyping utilized the Promega GenePrint 10 system, comparing DNA from primary cultures to immortalized cell lines, at the University of Florida’s Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research. Routine G-banded karyotypes were obtained for 12 cell lines by established cytogenetics laboratories. Cell lines were regularly tested for mycoplasma contamination. Subcloning a heterozygous line from icNF98.4c In an effort to create isogenic cell line pairs for several tumors, we successfully subcloned a heterozygous version of icNF98.4c cells (last row,  Table 1 ). Cells were diluted and placed into a 96-well plate at an average of 1 cell/well. Forty single-cell clones were tested for lack of the somatic pathogenic mutation (deletion), that is, presence of two alleles at the site of the germline variant, and propagated. A subclone was found to be heterozygous with no evidence of the two-hit cells (not further characterized at this time). Western blots and analysis: Neurofibromin and pERK:ERK Cells from all lines reported in  Table 1  were lysed with RIPA buffer and lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 RPM for 30 minutes at 4 o C. Protein was quantitated with a Bradford assay; 50 µg of protein was loaded per well for NF1 blots and 20 µg of protein was loaded for other blots. 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels were run at 100 V for 2 hours and transferred at 100 V for 2 hours onto a PVDF membrane. Blots (3 replicates) were probed overnight at 4 o C with primary antibody washed and probed 1 hour at room temperature with secondary antibody. Primary antibodies included N-Terminal NF1 (Cell Signaling cat# D7R7D 1:1000), beta-actin (Cell Signaling cat# 3700 1:10000), p-ERK (Cell Signaling cat# 9101 1:1000), and total ERK (Cell Signaling cat# 9102 1:1000). The secondary antibody was HRP-tagged from Santa Cruz, for chemiluminescent detection using chemiluminescent substrate from Bio-Rad (Cat. #: 170–5061; Hercules, California) per the manufacturer’s protocols. Western blot band intensities were quantitated with ImageJ software. Neurofibromin (when present) was normalized to beta actin of that sample. Comparison of neurofibromin, p-ERK, and ERK levels across blots was accomplished by normalizing to the signal from the heterozygous cell line icNF09.5. Histological analysis of original neurofibromas For the neurofibromas acquired under University of Florida approval, formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) slide sections were obtained. For each tumor, one section each was stained with established methods at the University of Florida Molecular Pathology Core lab, for: (1) hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) to evaluate histology, cellularity, and vascularity; (2) toluidine blue to identify mast cells, and (3) CD69 immunostaining to identify macrophages. Stained slides were evaluated by a neuropathologist. NF1  mutation analyses The search for  NF1  pathogenic variants in the primary cNF cultures and corresponding immortalized cell lines initially utilized Sanger sequencing of the  NF1  cDNA via overlapping reverse-transcription-PCR fragments, and Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) analysis of DNA to detect copy number changes (insertions/deletions) at multiple points in the  NF1  gene (P082 kit, MRC Holland). DNA was extracted with the PureGene system (Qiagen), and RNA extracted using the DirectZol kit (Zymo Research). cDNA sequencing included the immediate flanking 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions, but not the entire such regions (primers listed in  S1 Table ). cDNA variants were characterized at the DNA level, and vice versa. For five samples, high-throughput sequencing of the  NF1  locus was also employed, utilizing the Ion S5 system (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Briefly, a targeted multiplex PCR primer panel was designed using custom Ion AmpliSeq Designer (ThermoFisher Scientific). The primer panel (n = 393) covered all  NF1  exons and a limited intronic sequence adjacent to the exons, totaling 12 kb. Sample DNA (30 ng) was amplified using this custom AmpliSeq primer panel, and libraries were prepared following the manufacturer’s protocol for Ion AmpliSeq Library Kit 2.0. Individual samples were barcoded during library preparation and subsequently pooled. Automated template preparation and loading onto Ion 520 Chip was performed using Ion Chef system, and DNA was sequenced on the Ion S5 sequencer per manufacturer’s instructions. Variant calling of the germline samples was performed using The Genome Analysis Toolkit ( https://gatk.broadinstitute.org ) and IonTorrent Variant Caller (TVC,  https://github.com/domibel/IonTorrent-VariantCaller ), while somatic variant calling was performed using either MuTect ( https://github.com/broadinstitute/mutect ) or TVC with relaxed stringency in order to increase sensitivity. Germline variant pathogenicity classification was performed by AutoGVP [ 23 ]. Somatic variants were queried in cBioPortal ( https://www.cbioportal.org/ ) using OncoQuery Language (OCL) for each variant across all studies that have mutation data. Samples were filtered out that did not have  NF1  profiled in the sequencing panel. Exome, genome, and transcriptome sequencing of primary and immortalized cNF cells Seven primary SC cultures and their matched immortalized cell lines were chosen for genomic analysis ( Table 1 ; icNF97.2a, icNF97.2b, icNF98.4c, icNF98.4d, icNF00.10a, icNF04.9a, i28cNF). We did not perform genomic profiling on cell lines where NF1 diagnostic criteria was not met (icNF97.5), cell lines where metadata about the parent tumor was limited (i18cNF, i21cNF), and cell lines where a somatic  NF1  mutation was low frequency, not observed, or unclear (icNF18.1, icNF09.5, icNF93.1, icNF99.1, i18cNF). For whole exome sequencing (WES), exomes were captured by IDT exome reagent xGen Exome Research Panel V1.0 (Integrated DNA Technologies) and libraries were subsequently constructed with a Kapa Hyper amplified kit (Roche) and sequenced using a NovaSeq 6000 S4 (Illumina) with ~200 × coverage. For whole genome sequencing (WGS), libraries were constructed with Kapa Hyper PCR-free kits and sequenced using the NovaSeq 6000 S4 with 30x coverage. For RNA-seq, samples were prepared with non-stranded library prep with RiboErase for rRNA depletion. The libraries were sequenced on the NovaSeq6000 S4 with targeted coverage of 30M reads per sample. Bioinformatic and statistical analyses of whole exome and whole genome sequencing data WES and WGS data processing was performed with a modified version of the Nextflow nf-core “sarek” data processing pipeline (v2.7.1) [ 24 – 27 ]. The pipeline was modified to add DeepVariant as an additional variant-calling method [ 27 ]. Details about all processing steps and underlying software versions can be found in the nf-core/sarek documentation ( https://nf-co.re/sarek/2.7.1 ) [ 28 – 35 ]. Briefly, the sequencing data were preprocessed using GATK best practice methods and aligned to the GRCh38 genome (GATK build). As there were no patient-matched non-tumor samples available, variant calling was performed in tumor-only mode and thus variations include both germline and somatic mutations. Whole exome variant calling was performed with FreeBayes [ 36 ], Mutect2, Strelka2 [ 37 ], and DeepVariant [ 27 ]. WGS variant calling was performed with the same variant calling tools. For downstream analysis, variants were filtered with bcftools, removing all variants that were not marked as a “PASS” by their respective variant caller, or variants that had a quality score less than 20. Variants were then annotated using Ensembl VEP v107 and simultaneously converted to Mutation Annotation Format (maf) using vcf2maf ( https://github.com/mskcc/vcf2maf ). The analyses presented here use only variants called by DeepVariant, however, the dataset (see Data Availability) includes the variant calls from the other aforementioned variant calling tools. In addition, copy-number alterations were determined using Control-FREEC (whole genome data only) [ 38 ]. Filtered variant (vcf) files for each cell line identified by DeepVariant were compared using the “jaccard” function from the “bedtools” software package [ 39 ]. The Jaccard indices were calculated in a pairwise manner ( i.e. , all cell lines compared to all other cell lines), followed by hierarchical clustering of the resulting matrix of Jaccard indices, plotting the results with the R “pheatmap” package ( https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pheatmap/index.html ). For the lollipop analysis,  NF1  variants were extracted from the annotated maf files from the WES data and plotted using the “maftools” R package [ 40 ]. Copy-number alterations (CNAs) called by Control-FREEC were summarized by averaging the copy number values in 500 base pair windows across the genome. The Circlize package was used to generate circos plots to compare the CNAs to the gene counts [ 41 , 42 ]. The genes in the gene expression data were mapped to the appropriate chromosome and genomic start location using the BiomaRt R package [ 43 , 44 ]. The CNA values and gene counts were log10 transformed to make smaller changes easier to observe in resulting plots. Presence of hTERT and mCdk4 transgene integration in the immortalized cell line genomes was confirmed by creating a custom genome (hg38 with additional sequences representing the hTERT and mCdk4 cDNA, which span two or more exons). We then aligned all of the WGS files to this custom genome, and evaluated the presence or absence of alignment of these additional sequences to the WGS data using Integrative Genomics Viewer. Bioinformatic and statistical analyses of gene expression Transcriptomic data processing was performed using the nf-core “rnaseq” data processing pipeline (v3.5) [ 45 ]. Details about all processing steps performed and underlying software versions can be found in the nf-core/rnaseq documentation ( https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/3.5 ). The pipeline was run in STAR-Salmon mode, which uses STAR for alignment (GRCh38, NCBI build), and Salmon for quantification of transcripts and genes. The pairwise Euclidean distances between gene expression data was also calculated during data processing by the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline [ 46 – 48 ]. The raw transcriptomics counts of the samples generated using Salmon were first loaded into R. On detection of duplicate rows with same gene names, rows containing higher (max) counts were preserved and others were filtered out. The raw counts were then filtered to remove genes with counts lower than 10 in greater than 80% of the samples. The filtered counts were then normalized to account for differences in library preparation using the trimmed mean of M-values (TMM method) [ 49 , 50 ]. Principal component analysis using the normalized log transformed counts (log counts per million) was performed using the “prcomp” function of the “stats” package and visualized using “ggplot2.” The normalized counts were adjusted for heteroscedasticity using the “voom” function then analyzed by fitting a generalized linear model (limma and edgeR packages) to identify differentially expressed genes between the sample groups [ 49 – 54 ]. “Pheatmap” was used for hierarchical clustering of the differentially expressed genes and visualizing the gene expression levels (log counts per million) between samples. A hypergeometric test using the “gprofiler2” package was performed on the differentially expressed gene set to explore the enrichment of pathways from Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Reactome (REAC), WikiPathways (WP), Transcription factor (TF), MicroRNA (MIRNA), Human Protein Atlas (HPA), CORUM (database of mammalian protein complexes), and Human Phenotype Ontology (HP) in the selected gene sets [ 54 , 55 ]. Pathway terms with a term size less than 500 enriched in the selected gene sets were explored further. Data resources Cellosaurus [ 56 ] entries have been created for the 7 cell lines (and matched 7 primary SC cultures) that were sequenced, containing information such as STR profiles and Research Resource Identifiers, and other information. This information has also been deposited in the NF Research Tools Database [ 57 ]. Raw and processed data as well as analyses are available on Synapse.org and the NF Data Portal ( https://doi.org/10.7303/syn11374339 ) [ 58 ]. The processed genomics data are available at syn29529772 (RNA-seq), syn29346753 (WES), and syn35832496 (WGS). Raw genomic datasets with specimen metadata are available at syn29390037.1 (RNA-seq), syn39613693.1 (WES), and syn39613866.1 (WGS). Analysis code is available at  https://github.com/nf-osi/cnf-cell-lines . All analyses were performed in R 4.2.1. All R packages and versions have been recorded in a renv lockfile available at:  https://github.com/nf-osi/cnf-cell-lines/blob/main/renv.lock . Ethics statement Prior to this study, individuals (or their guardians, in the case of minors) planning to undergo surgery to remove cNFs gave informed written consent to donate their tumor samples and a blood sample for research, in compliance with relevant laws and approval from the University of Florida (UF) IRB, via protocols 41–1992 (1992–2012) and a bank (2017–00320, 2013-current, which subsumed 41–1992 materials). The bank contains data (clinical and experimental) and samples (primary, and derived materials such as nucleic acids and cell lines) from people with NF1 or other genetic conditions. The study reported here (#2017–02709) was approved as a revision of 41–1992, to utilize de-identified materials from the bank (consent waived). Through the senior author (MRW), this study (protocol 2017–02709, expedited) accessed bank materials from 8 individuals (11 cNF cell lines and derived data) a number of times between August 1, 2018, and August 17, 2023 (span of project). Only the senior author had the ability to link those study materials with specific individuals, as PI of both protocols. All 8 subjects met diagnostic criteria for NF1, except for the one associated with cell line icNF97,5 (a child too young to show sufficient diagnostic criteria) [ 59 ]. The three other cNF cell lines (i18cNF, i21cNF, i28cNF) were derived from cultures of NF1 cNFs previously obtained under protocol PI-18–054, approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Germans Trias i Pujol Hospital, Badalona (Barcelona), Spain, on March 23, 2018 (no expiration date). The PI of that protocol (ES) has access to identification of samples, as in the UF situation. Also similar to the situation for UF, materials were accessed and de-identified prior to inclusion in this study, on August 19, 2019. Thus, subjects were not specifically consented for this study, but previously consented to the use of their materials and data (de-identified) in future research. There was no demographic information provided for the subjects behind any cell lines, although biological gender was discovered from karyotyping and included in  Table 1 .",Hua Li; Alexander Pemov; Robert Allaway; David F Muir; Lung-Ji Chang; Jineta Banerjee; Alexandra J Scott; Jaime M W Nagy; Jian Liu; Meritxell Carrió; Helena Mazuelas; Anthony Yachnis; Sang Y Lee; Xiaochun Zhang; Yang Lyu; Douglas R Stewart; Angela Hirbe; Jaishri O Blakeley; Eduard Serra; Deeann Wallis; Margaret R Wallace,PloS one,2026,10.1371/journal.pone.0340183,minimal,True
PMID:38603731,Raman difference spectroscopy and U-Net convolutional neural network for molecular analysis of cutaneous neurofibroma.,"In Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), peripheral nerve sheaths tumors are common, with cutaneous neurofibromas resulting in significant aesthetic, painful and functional problems requiring surgical removal. To date, determination of adequate surgical resection margins-complete tumor removal while attempting to preserve viable tissue-remains largely subjective. Thus, residual tumor extension beyond surgical margins or recurrence of the disease may frequently be observed. Here, we introduce Shifted-Excitation Raman Spectroscopy in combination with deep neural networks for the future perspective of objective, real-time diagnosis, and guided surgical ablation. The obtained results are validated through established histological methods. In this study, we evaluated the discrimination between cutaneous neurofibroma (n = 9) and adjacent physiological tissues (n = 25) in 34 surgical pathological specimens ex vivo at a total of 82 distinct measurement loci. Based on a convolutional neural network (U-Net), the mean raw Raman spectra (n = 8,200) were processed and refined, and afterwards the spectral peaks were assigned to their respective molecular origin. Principal component and linear discriminant analysis was used to discriminate cutaneous neurofibromas from physiological tissues with a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 97.3%, and overall classification accuracy of 97.6%. The results enable the presented optical, non-invasive technique in combination with artificial intelligence as a promising candidate to ameliorate both, diagnosis and treatment of patients affected by cutaneous neurofibroma and NF1.","Materials and methods Study collective and sample acquisition A total of 20 patients were enrolled at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf in 2020. Patients underwent surgical tissue removal as indicated by tumor burden (see  Fig 1 ). All surgical resections were performed by the same experienced surgeon. After anatomical orientation, Raman spectra were collected from the specimens  ex vivo , which were subsequently confirmed histologically. Physiological tissue, obtained from the biobank archive of the department, served as controls: skin, mucosa, bone, nerve, and fat. Herein, data collection was performed after pseudonymization, without individual participant identification. All tissue samples were kept in their physiologic state without fixation medium (isotonic 0.9% NaCl solution to prevent drying) and processed for spectroscopic analysis within a maximum time of four hours. For each specimen, in average three evenly distributed measurement locations were chosen. Following histopathological confirmation, the spectroscopic data were referenced to the corresponding tissue entities. The sample collection and experimental study was conducted from 2020 through 2021. Patients’ written informed consent was obtained before participation. The study is in accordance with the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments and has been approved by the research ethics committee of the University of Hamburg (AZ PV7012, 11.02.2020). 10.1371/journal.pone.0302017.g001 Fig 1 Clinical presentation and macroscopic aspect of cutaneous neurofibroma. (A) Example of a 43-year-old male patient that underwent surgical removal of eleven neurofibromas on the trunk and extremities (not shown), nine of which were processed for spectral analysis. (B, C) Macroscopic aspect of representative surgical specimen measuring 3.7x1.8 cm from top and lateral view. Technical set-up A self-engineered Raman probe connected to a spectrometer and a laser was used as previously described in detail [ 20 ,  21 ]. In brief, an excitation laser beam (power 115 mW) is guided from the diode laser (Littman/Metcalf, Sacher Lasertechnik, Marburg, Germany) through an optical fiber (200 μm core diameter, 0.22 NA) to the Raman probe. After passing of a short pass filter (780/12 Brightline HC, Semrock, Rochester, New York, USA), a dichroic mirror and an achromatic lens (THORLABS, Newton, New Jersey, USA), the laser beam is focused onto the specimen. The inelastically scattered Raman signal is collected, together with undesired background interferences (elastically scattered signals and laser-induced fluorescence). A dichroic mirror and a long-pass filter suppress the elastically scattered signal. As described, fluorescence and Raman signals pass the dichroic mirror towards another lens focusing them onto a detection glass fiber (600 μm core diameter, 0.37 NA) guiding the signals from the Raman probe to the spectrometer (Ventana-785-Raman, Ocean Optics, Rochester, New York, USA) (see  Fig 2 ). At 1000 ms acquisition time, the spectrometer acquires the spectra from 800 to 940 nm, equivalent to Raman shifts from 200 to 2000 cm -1 . The focal spot position was optimized for maximum signal intensity through z-axis translation in every measurement locus, resulting in a working distance of approximately 10–11 mm. The acquired Raman spectra are expected to be collected from a tissue surface layer of approximately 100 μm in depth, thus the Raman signal is derived primarily from the epithelial aspects [ 22 ]. 10.1371/journal.pone.0302017.g002 Fig 2 Illustration of Raman spectral acquisition and processing. Left panel: Sketch of self-engineered Raman probe as described in [ 20 ]. DM: dichroic mirror; L: lens; LP: long-pass filter; M: mirror; SP: short-pass filter; Right panel: Illustration of efficient extraction of Raman spectrum from extreme fluorescence interference and biological tissues classification. Data processing Routinely, for each tissue measurement locus, 50 spectra  S 784  were acquired using the excitation wavelength of 784 nm. Then, another 50 spectra  S 785  were recorded at 785 nm. Mean spectra   and  S 784 ¯  were averaged from each of the 50 raw spectra. Extraction of the pure Raman spectra from the mean raw spectra, which were heavily interfered by autofluorescence, was performed using the SERDS and U-Net deep neural network data processing methods developed in-house by our workgroup for biological tissue specimens [ S 785 ¯ 19 – 21 ]. Here, it is briefly explained in the context of  Fig 2 . The mean raw spectra   and  S 784 ¯  in blue and red are first z-score normalized, then a difference spectrum is obtained (black curve). This difference spectrum is provided as an input to the U-Net convolutional neural network to obtain a purified Raman spectrum as an output (green curve) [ S 785 ¯ 19 ]. This method provides better (completely background free) purified Raman spectra than the standard (without U-Net) SERDS Raman spectrum recovery approach. In order to differentiate between neurofibroma and physiological tissues based on their Raman spectra (Raman shifts between 550 to 1800 cm -1 ), we employed a multiclass linear discriminant analysis (LDA) [ 23 ]. As a first step, principal component analysis (PCA) was utilized to reduce the number of spectral parameters by generating a new set of independent features ordered by the largest variability in the dataset [ 24 ]. As previously described in detail, in every iteration a PCA was performed separately for each cross-validation [ 21 ]. Discrimination between the different measurement loci, specimens and types of tissue entities was made by splitting the data set into training (80%) and test (20%) data sets according to a 5-fold cross validation [ 25 ]. Once trained, the deep learning approach may be applied for real-time SERDS data analysis. Histology Following spectroscopic analysis, tissue samples were processed and validated histologically in the Institute of Neuropathology at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf. Regions of spectral data acquisition were routinely fixed in 3.7% PBS-buffered formaldehyde, dehydrated with ethanol, embedded in paraffin, and sections performed on a microtome. Four standard 10-μm-thick sections were stained with Hematoxylin & Eosin for each specimen. For this study, the material was evaluated by the same experienced neuropathologist applying current WHO criteria to diagnose peripheral nerve sheath tumors [ 26 ].",Levi Matthies; Hendrik Amir-Kabirian; Medhanie T Gebrekidan; Andreas S Braeuer; Ulrike S Speth; Ralf Smeets; Christian Hagel; Martin Gosau; Christian Knipfer; Reinhard E Friedrich,PloS one,2024,10.1371/journal.pone.0302017,minimal,True
PMID:28725547,Spatial working memory in neurofibromatosis 1: Altered neural activity and functional connectivity.,"BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder that disrupts central nervous system development and neuronal function. Cognitively, NF1 is characterized by difficulties with executive control and visuospatial abilities. Little is known about the neural substrates underlying these deficits. The current study utilized Blood-Oxygen-Level-Dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) to explore the neural correlates of spatial working memory (WM) deficits in patients with NF1. METHODS: BOLD images were acquired from 23 adults with NF1 (age  RESULTS: Relative to healthy controls, participants with NF1 showed reduced recruitment of key components of WM circuitry, the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right parietal cortex. In addition, healthy controls exhibited greater simultaneous deactivation between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and temporal regions than NF1 patients. In contrast, NF1 patients showed greater PCC and bilateral parietal connectivity with visual cortices as well as between the PCC and the cerebellum. In NF1 participants, increased functional coupling of the PCC with frontal and parietal regions was associated with better spatial reasoning and WM performance, respectively; these relationships were not observed in controls. CONCLUSIONS: Dysfunctional engagement of WM circuitry, and aberrant functional connectivity of 'task-negative' regions in NF1 patients may underlie spatial WM difficulties characteristic of the disorder.","Methods BOLD images were acquired from 23 adults with NF1 (age  M  = 32.69; 61% male) and 25 matched healthy controls (age  M  = 33.08; 64% male) during an in-scanner visuo-spatial WM task. Whole brain functional and psycho-physiological interaction analyses were utilized to investigate neural activity and functional connectivity, respectively, during visuo-spatial WM performance. Participants also completed behavioral measures of spatial reasoning and verbal WM. 2 Methods and materials 2.1 Participants A total of 48 participants were included in the current study (23 NF1 patients and 25 demographically comparable healthy controls). Participants ranged in age from 18 to 47 years. NF1 participants were screened and enrolled by a pediatric neurologist (T.R.), a clinician with experience caring for individuals with  NF . All subjects included were participants in a clinical trial, as described in  Bearden et al. (2016) ; however, all testing was conducted prior to treatment randomization. Two NF1 patients included were confirmed to have asymptomatic optic gliomas at the time of testing. NF1 patient inclusion criteria were: 1) Meets NIH NF1 diagnostic criteria ( Stumf, 1988 ) and does not have segmental NF1. 2) No evidence of intracranial pathology such as hydrocephalus or brain tumor, other than an asymptomatic optic pathway or other NF1-related glioma; 3) Full-Scale IQ ≥ 70 (as determined by the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence [WASI];  Wechsler, 2011 ); 4) No comorbid major neurological or psychiatric disorder (e.g., epilepsy, bipolar disorder, psychotic illness, major depression); 5) No MRI contraindications; female participants could not be pregnant or lactating; 6) Sufficient fluency in English. Healthy controls also had to meet inclusion criteria 2 through 6 above. Participants were recruited from three primary sources: 1) The Children's Hospital Los Angeles Neurofibromatosis Clinic, a major NF1 referral center for the greater Los Angeles region; 2) local Children's Tumor Foundation and NF Network family educational symposia; 3) NF-related websites as well as  www.clinicaltrials.gov . Demographically comparable healthy controls were recruited from the Consortium for Neuropsychiatric Phenomics, a study ongoing concurrently at UCLA ( Poldrack et al., 2016a ), and for which the neuroimaging data are now freely available at OpenfMRI ( https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000030/ ). 2.2 Procedure All aspects of the research project were granted IRB approval by UCLA, prior to the collection of any data. All participants provided verbal and written informed consent before participation in any aspect of the study, after study procedures were fully explained. 2.3 Measures 2.3.1 Neuropsychological measures Cognitive functioning was assessed via a neuropsychological battery administered by supervised clinical psychology doctoral students or Master's level psychometricians. IQ data were obtained using either the Matrix Reasoning and Vocabulary subtests from the WASI ( Wechsler, 2011 ) for the NF1 patients and the same measures from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Version 4 (WAIS-IV;  Wechsler, 2014 ) for the healthy controls (scaled scores were used to account for differences between task versions). Matrix Reasoning was also examined as a measure of nonverbal reasoning ability. Working memory capacity was measured behaviorally using the University of Maryland Letter–Number Sequencing (LNS) task ( Gold et al., 1997 ). In this task, participants are presented with sets of numbers and letters of varying length and then must repeat back the presented numbers in ascending order and letters in alphabetical order. 2.3.2 Spatial capacity working memory (SCAP) task Participants viewed a visual array presenting 1, 3, 5, or 7 circles on the screen followed by a probe circle. The participant had to indicate whether the probe circle was presented in the same position as one of the circles in the previous array, as described in detail in  Montojo et al. (2014)  and  Glahn et al. (2002) . Trial events included a two second target-array presentation, a 1.5, 3 or 4.5 s delay period, and a three second response period. Half the task trials were true-positive, and half were true-negative. Task trials were compared to the fixation during the inter-trial interval. Participants underwent a brief behavioral training session on the task prior to administration in the scanner, as described below. 2.3.3 fMRI acquisition All data were collected at the University of California, Los Angeles in one of two scanning facilities both with 3 T Siemens Tim Trio MRI scanner, running Siemens versions syngo MR B15 and B17. 219. Group level whole brain and PPI analyses included scanner as a covariate. Functional T2- weighted echo planar images (EPIs) were collected with the following parameters: slice thickness = 4 mm, 34 slices, TR = 2 s, TE = 30 ms, flip angles = 90°, matrix 192 × 192, FOV = 192 mm. Additionally, a T2-weighted matched-bandwidth high resolution anatomical scan (same slice prescription as EPI) and MPRAGE were collected. The parameters for the MPRAGE were the following: TR = 2.3 s, TE = 2.91 ms, FOV = 256 mm, matrix = 240 × 256, flip angle = 9°, slice thickness = 1.20 mm, 160 slices. 2.3.4 Statistical analyses Analyses of neuropsychological and clinical data were performed using SPSS software v. 21 (IBM). We compared demographic characteristics between groups using independent samples  t -tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. FMRI data analyses were performed using the FMRIB software library ( www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl ), version 5.0 ( Smith et al., 2004 ). Images for each participant were realigned to compensate for small head movements ( Jenkinson and Smith, 2001 ). Subjects with average translational motion > 3 mm were excluded (n = 1). Data were spatially smoothed using a 5-mm, full-width-half-maximum Gaussian kernel. The data were filtered in the temporal domain using a nonlinear high-pass filter with a 66 s cutoff. A three-step registration process was used in which EPI images were first registered to the matched-bandwidth high-resolution scan, then to the MPRAGE structural image, and finally into standard (Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI]) space, using nonlinear transformations. Four NF1 patients were registered using linear transformations due to image distortion during registration with nonlinear transformation. Standard model fitting was conducted for all subjects, and all task trials were included in the analysis. Higher-level analyses modeled all loads. For first-level whole brain analyses, the following events were modeled after convolution with a canonical gamma hemodynamic response function: All loads, load 1, load 3, load 5, load 7, delay 1.5 s (sec), delay 3 s, and delay 4.5 s. Events were modeled with the onset at the target presentation and duration of 6.5, 8, and 9.5 s to include the variable delay and probe periods. The six motion parameters and temporal derivatives of all regressors were included as covariates of no interest to improve statistical sensitivity. For each subject, the following contrasts were computed: All loads, load 1, load 3, load 5, load 7. The output from the subject-specific analyses was analyzed using a mixed-effects model with FMRIB's Local Analysis of Mixed Effects (FLAME). To first rule out potential scanner-related differences, we checked for differences in neural activity between scanners in each group. Seven healthy controls and nine NF1 patients were scanned at the UCLA Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, and 18 healthy controls and 14 NF1 patents were scanned at the UCLA Brain Mapping Center, on identically configured scanners. There were no significant differences in the proportion of NF1 patients and healthy controls scanned at each location (χ 2 (2,48) = 0.67, p > 0.05). There were no differences in activation between scanners (p > 0.05 for all comparisons); thus, all subsequent group-level analyses were conducted with age, gender, and scanner added as covariates. Using FSL's FLAME, group-level statistics images were thresholded with a cluster-forming threshold of z > 2.3 as well as 3.1 and a cluster probability of p < 0.05, corrected for whole-brain multiple comparisons using Gaussian random field theory. According to  Eklund et al. (2016, pp. 7902) , “among the parametric software packages, FSL's FLAME1 clusterwise inference stood out as having much lower FWE, often being valid (under 5%), but this comes at the expense of highly conservative voxelwise inference.” These findings suggest that FSL's FLAME1 at a cluster threshold of 2.3 has much lower family wise error rates than other parametric software packages, almost comparable to permutation methods. Nevertheless, we still ran the analysis with a cluster z > 3.1 to see if the results at the z > 2.3 threshold were maintained. The search region included the whole brain (139,264 voxels). Brain regions were identified using the Harvard-Oxford cortical and subcortical probabilistic atlases as well as associated Brodmann areas for regions without Harvard-Oxford designations. All activations are reported in MNI coordinates. For reporting of clusters, we used the cluster command in FSL. Anatomical localization within each cluster was obtained by searching within maximum likelihood regions from the FSL Harvard-Oxford probabilistic atlas to obtain the maximum z-statistic and MNI coordinates within each anatomical region contained within a cluster. Due to a technical issue during scan acquisition, behavioral data from the SCAP task were only available for a subset of NF1 patients (n = 5), although behavioral data were successfully collected on all 25 healthy controls. Thus, we modeled all trials in our fMRI analyses. To confirm that any observed differences in neural activity were not due to differences in task performance, subjects with available SCAP behavioral data were included in a follow-up analysis modeling all trials vs. correct trials only (see Supplementary Results for details). 2.3.5 PPI analyses We used the generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) method described in  McLaren et al. (2012) . Prior to running the gPPI analysis all subjects' SCAP scans were run through the FSL motion outlier tool ( http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSLMotionOutliers ) to remove timepoints with significant motion (FD > 0.5 mm). First, the following events were modeled after convolution with a canonical gamma hemodynamic response function: load 1, load 3, load 5, and load 7. Events were modeled with the onset of the visual array presentation. Second, we extracted the time course of a priori seed regions within the left parietal, right parietal, and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). The parietal regions were selected given their central role in working memory function ( Baddeley, 2003 ,  Todd and Marois, 2004 ). The PCC seed was selected as a central hub of the default mode network (DMN; 33,34), as we were interested in exploring potential task related DMN interference in NF1. Seed regions were 8 mm spheres centered on the point of maximum activation during SCAP trials obtained from an independent sample of healthy individuals; see  Poldrack et al. (2016b)  for description of the sample and  Table 1  for ROI coordinates. Table 1 Coordinates for regions of interest used as PPI seeds. Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates represent the center location of the 8 mm sphere. Table 1 ROI X (mm) Y (mm) Z (mm) PCC 2 − 56 22 Left parietal − 20 − 64 56 Right parietal 22 − 66 52 Third, the seed time-course was multiplied by condition onset times for load 1, load 3, load 5, and load 7 separately, and then convolved with the hemodynamic response function to obtain the PPI results for each load. The six motion parameters and temporal derivatives of all regressors were included as covariates of no interest to improve statistical sensitivity by reducing the influence of motion. In order to simplify the analyses and reduce multiple comparisons, rather than investigating each load separately, a contrast was set up in order to calculate the mean PPI for all loads. Similar to the whole brain analysis, Group-level statistics images were thresholded with a cluster-forming threshold of z > 2.3 and a Bonferroni corrected cluster probability of p < 0.017. PPI beta values between seed and secondary regions (Harvard-Oxford anatomical masks of the frontal, temporal, and parietal regions) were extracted from the all loads zstat image. 2.3.6 PPI and behavioral measures To assess whether functional connectivity during task performance was associated with cognitive performance outside the scanner, we assessed the relationship between seed-based connectivity and behavioral performance on two tasks of nonverbal reasoning and auditory working memory, respectively, Matrix Reasoning and LNS, using linear regression models. Each Beta coefficient value represents the mean connectivity between a seed region (PCC, left parietal, or right parietal) and a target region of interest (ROI). Target ROIs are structural ROIs extracted from the Harvard-Oxford atlas (frontal = frontal pole + inferior middle frontal, temporal = middle temporal lobe posterior division + inferior temporal posterior division, and parietal = lateral occipital + superior parietal lobule; see Supplementary Fig. 3 for ROIs). Betas were extracted using the fslmeants command in fsl from each PPI group level model (controlling for scanner), which presents the average intensities over all voxels in the ROI. We then used the betas extracted from each seed-target pair as predictors in a regression with each of the behavioral tasks as the outcome variable. NF1 patients and healthy controls were analyzed separately. We did not include all the connectivity values in one model because of significant collinearity with the overlapping PPI seed regions. Thus, we ran three separate models run for each behavioral measure as the outcome; the connectivity values for each target region were included in the same model. Specifically, Model I included age, left parietal-frontal betas (i.e., beta regression coefficient value indexing connectivity between the left parietal seed and the Harvard-Oxford derived frontal pole region), right parietal-frontal betas, and PCC-frontal betas as predictors. Model II includes age, left parietal-parietal betas, right parietal-parietal betas, and PCC-parietal betas as predictors. Lastly, Model III includes age, left parietal-temporal betas, right parietal-temporal betas, and PCC-temporal betas as predictors.",Amira F A Ibrahim; Caroline A Montojo; Kristen M Haut; Katherine H Karlsgodt; Laura Hansen; Eliza Congdon; Tena Rosser; Robert M Bilder; Alcino J Silva; Carrie E Bearden,NeuroImage.

PMID:2491778,Flanking markers for the gene causing von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1).,"The defective gene causing von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1), one of the most common inherited disorders affecting the human nervous system, was recently mapped to chromosome 17. We have used additional DNA markers to further narrow and bracket the NF1 defect. A multipoint linkage analysis suggests that the NF1 gene is flanked by D17Z1 on the centromeric side and by EW 207 on the telomeric side of the long arm of chromosome 17. The identification of closely linked flanking markers should allow us to develop a reliable prenatal and presymptomatic diagnostic test for this serious neurological disorder and provides the basis for applying chromosome-specific cloning techniques for the isolation and characterization of the mutant gene.",,B R Seizinger; G E Farmer; J L Haines; L J Ozelius; K Anderson; B R Korf; D M Parry; M A Pericak-Vance; J J Mulvihill; A Menon,American journal of human genetics,1989-01,,abstract_only,False
PMID:29712669,Proliferation-independent role of NF2 (merlin) in limiting biliary morphogenesis.,"The architecture of individual cells and cell collectives enables functional specification, a prominent example being the formation of epithelial tubes that transport fluid or gas in many organs. The intrahepatic bile ducts (IHBDs) form a tubular network within the liver parenchyma that transports bile to the intestine. Aberrant biliary 'neoductulogenesis' is also a feature of several liver pathologies including tumorigenesis. However, the mechanism of biliary tube morphogenesis in development or disease is not known. Elimination of the neurofibromatosis type 2 protein (NF2; also known as merlin or neurofibromin 2) causes hepatomegaly due to massive biliary neoductulogenesis in the mouse liver. We show that this phenotype reflects unlimited biliary morphogenesis rather than proliferative expansion. Our studies suggest that NF2 normally limits biliary morphogenesis by coordinating lumen expansion and cell architecture. This work provides fundamental insight into how biliary fate and tubulogenesis are coordinated during development and will guide analyses of disease-associated and experimentally induced biliary pathologies.",,Samira Benhamouche-Trouillet; Evan O'Loughlin; Ching-Hui Liu; William Polacheck; Julien Fitamant; Mary McKee; Nabeel El-Bardeesy; Christopher S Chen; Andrea I McClatchey,"Development (Cambridge, England)",2018-04-30,10.1242/dev.162123,abstract_only,False
PMID:32642733,KIF11 and KIF15 mitotic kinesins are potential therapeutic vulnerabilities for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.,"BACKGROUND: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) constitutes the leading cause of neurofibromatosis type 1-related mortality. MPNSTs contain highly rearranged hyperploid genomes and exhibit a high division rate and aggressiveness. We have studied in vitro whether the mitotic kinesins KIF11, KIF15, and KIF23 have a functional role in maintaining MPNST cell survival and can represent potential therapeutic vulnerabilities. METHODS: We studied the expression of kinesin mRNAs and proteins in tumors and cell lines and used several in vitro functional assays to analyze the impact of kinesin genetic suppression (KIF15, KIF23) and drug inhibition (KIF11) in MPNST cells. We also performed in vitro combined treatments targeting KIF11 together with other described MPNST targets. RESULTS: The studied kinesins were overexpressed in MPNST samples. KIF15 and KIF23 were required for the survival of MPNST cell lines, which were also more sensitive than benign control fibroblasts to the KIF11 inhibitors ispinesib and ARRY-520. Co-targeting KIF11 and BRD4 with ARRY-520 and JQ1 reduced MPNST cell viability, synergistically killing a much higher proportion of MPNST cells than control fibroblasts. In addition, genetic suppression of  CONCLUSIONS: The mitotic spindle kinesins KIF11 and KIF15 and the cytokinetic kinesin KIF23 play a clear role in maintaining MPNST cell survival and may represent potential therapeutic vulnerabilities. Although further in vivo evidences are still mandatory, we propose a simultaneous suppression of KIF11, KIF15, and BRD4 as a potential therapy for MPNSTs.","Methods We studied the expression of kinesin mRNAs and proteins in tumors and cell lines and used several in vitro functional assays to analyze the impact of kinesin genetic suppression (KIF15, KIF23) and drug inhibition (KIF11) in MPNST cells. We also performed in vitro combined treatments targeting KIF11 together with other described MPNST targets. Materials and Methods Cell Lines and Primary Cultures Several cell lines derived from MPNSTs were used: S462 and ST88-14 (provided by Dr Nancy Ratner), sNF96.2 (provided by Dr Thomas De Raedt), 90-8 and the sporadic MPNST-derived STS-26T (provided by Dr Eric Legius), and sporadic HS-Sch-2 (obtained from RIKEN). In addition, the commercial human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cell line CCD-1112Sk (ATCC) was used as a normal control cell line. All cells were cultured with supplemented high glucose Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) under standard conditions (see Supplementary Extended Methods). NF1-associated MPNST cell lines were authenticated using the  NF1  described mutation and we performed an Short Tandem Repeat (STR) profile in all lines (Terribas et al., manuscript in preparation). Schwann cell (SC) primary cultures obtained from 8 DNFs and 4 PNFs were used as control benign cells. They were obtained from NF1 patients who gave their informed consent and after Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval. SCs were isolated from these tumors and cultured as previously described  (see Supplementary Extended Methods). 14 Immunohistochemistry A tissue microarray including 16 PNF and 14 MPNST samples (see Supplementary Extended Methods) was used to check the expression of KIF11 and KIF15. In addition, the proliferation marker Ki67 was also immunodetected. Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tissue sections 3 μm thick were incubated with anti-KIF11 antibody (Proteintech), anti-KIF15 antibody (Proteintech), or Ki67 (Ventana Medical Systems), and a horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody was used in all cases. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on the Ventana Benchmark XT Automated IHC Stainer (Ventana Medical Systems Inc.; see Supplementary Extended Methods). Quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction RNA was extracted from cells using Tripure Isolation Reagent (Roche) and retrotranscribed using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (see Supplementary Extended Methods), and cDNA was submitted to qPCR in a Light-Cycler 480 Real-Time PCR System. The sequences of the primers and probes used and conditions for amplification can be found in Supplementary Extended Methods. A Microsoft Excel spreadsheet was used to analyze qPCR data for relative expression calculations as described  (see Supplementary Extended Methods). 15 Protein Extraction and Western Blot Total protein was extracted after cell lysis with Radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (see Supplementary Extended Methods). An Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis was performed using 20 µg of protein per sample. Polyvinylidene Fluoride membranes were incubated with either anti-KIF11 antibody (Proteintech) or anti-KIF15 antibody (Proteintech) at 4ºC overnight and with anti-α-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich) during 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then incubated with IRDye 680LT and IRDye 800CW secondary antibodies (LI-COR) for 1 h at room temperature and scanned using the Odyssey Imaging System (LI-COR; see Supplementary Extended Methods). siRNA Transfection KIF15 and KIF23 mRNA expression was knocked down in both S462 and ST88-14 cell lines using siRNA molecules. A siRNA pool targeting KIF15, KIF23, or a non-targeting control (NTC; siGENOME SMARTpool, Dharmacon) was introduced into cells using lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Life Technologies). Transfected cells were used for RNA extraction and for several functional in vitro assays (see Supplementary Extended Methods). CRISPR/Cas Edition We used CRISPR/Cas technique to edit the  KIF15  gene and generate a  KIF15 KO  S462 clone. For the generation of the CRISPR constructs, we selected the pX330-U6-Chimeric_BB-CBh-HSpCas0 (Addgene) and the pRGS2 surrogate reporter (Labomics) vectors (see Supplementary Extended Methods). S462 cells derived from a single cell clone were transfected with both pX330 and pRGS2 constructs with Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies), and sorted, after 3 days, using the BD FACSAria II. Single Red Fluorescent Protein-positive and Green Fluorescent-positive sorted cells were plated in 96-well plates, cultured, and expanded in standard conditions (see Supplementary Extended Methods). A viable S462 clone was found to be KIF15-deficient ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) and was used together with KIF15 WT  S462 clonal cells for single and combined treatments. In Vitro Single Drug Treatment HFFs, ST88-14, and S462 were incubated in a dose-dependent manner with either ispinesib (Selleckchem) or ARRY-520 (MedChemExpress), which selectively inhibit KIF11. In ispinesib treatment, for the dose–response time course, cells were seeded in 96-well plates and treated with 4 concentrations, and cell viability was measured at 0 h, 24 h, and 48 h. For the calculation of the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ), cells were plated in a 6-well plate and treated with 4 concentrations. After 48 h, cells were counted with the Countess Automated Cell Counter (Life Technologies). For the dose–response of ispinesib treatment after  KIF15  depletion, we combined siRNA transfection of  KIF15  and the NTC siRNAs (Dharmacon), and chemical inhibition of KIF11 with ispinesib in S462 cell line. Here, S462 cells were plated in a 10 cm plate and transfected with siRNA pools (targeting  KIF15  or an NTC) and lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Life Technologies). After 24 h, cells were counted and plated on a 6-well plate. After 24 h, cells were treated with 4 concentrations of ispinesib and after 48 h were counted with the Countess Automated Cell Counter (Life Technologies; see Supplementary Extended Methods) In ARRY-520 treatment, for both the dose–response time course and the IC 50  calculation, cells were seeded in 96-well plates, treated with 4 concentrations of ARRY-520. Cell viability was measured at 0 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h in the time course and at 72 h for IC 50  calculation (see Supplementary Extended Methods). Immunofluorescence of α-Tubulin The effect of the KIF11 inhibitors ispinesib and ARRY-520 in the microtubule cytoskeleton was determined by immunofluorescence of α-tubulin. In short, MPNST cells were plated on an 8-well Labtek slide (Sarstedt) and incubated with DMSO, 2.5 nM ispinesib or 1 μM ARRY-520 for 24 h. Cells were then incubated with 1:100 of anti-α-tubulin-Alexa488 antibody (Life Technologies) for 45 min. Cells were then mounted with Vectashield with DAPI (Vector Laboratories) and visualized at 100× in a fluorescence microscope (Leica DMI 6000B). Mid-Throughput Combined Treatment Screening The MPNST cell lines S462 and sNF96.2 were screened in a 10 × 10 matrix combination format with 500 cells per 5 μl well with ispinesib or ARRY-520 in combination with other 20 compounds from the MIPE 4.0 library of approved and investigational drugs, to assess synergy. Matrix blocks were dispensed using an acoustic dispenser (EDC Biosystems), and 48-h CellTiter-Glo readout was used to inform on cell viability. In Vitro Combined Drug Treatment We performed a dose–response experiment where HFFs, ST88-14, and S462 were treated with 6 concentrations of single ARRY-520, 6 concentrations of the single second drug, and 6 combined concentrations of ARRY-520 and the second drug, in a time course. Cell viability was measured at 0 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h of treatment (see Supplementary Extended Methods). We also studied the effect of the ARRY-520/JQ1 combination in the viability, proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis of HFFs, ST88-14, S462, and S462- KIF15 KO  (see Supplementary Extended Methods). Cell Viability Analysis Cell viability was assessed using several methodologies (XTT assay, RealTime-Glo MT assay, and automated cell counting) depending on the performed experiment. For the siRNA-transfected ST88-14 cells, viability was measured using the XTT assay (Roche; see Supplementary Extended Methods). For the siRNA-transfected S462 cell line, viability was assessed by automated cell counting with the Countess Automated Cell Counter (Life Technologies; see Supplementary Extended Methods). In the in vitro ispinesib treatment, for the dose–response time course, cell viability was measured with XTT assay; and for the IC 50  determination, automated cell counting was performed (see Supplementary Extended Methods). In the in vitro ARRY-520 treatment, for both the dose–response time course and the IC 50  calculation, the RealTime-Glo MT assay was used (see Supplementary Extended Methods). This assay was also used for assessing the viability of the combined drug treatments. Cell Proliferation and Cell Cycle Analysis The Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 488 Flow Cytometry Assay Kit (Life Technologies) was used in combination with propidium iodide (PI, Sigma) staining for the calculation of proliferating cells and cell cycle phases using the flow cytometer in siRNA transfection experiments and in combined drug treatments (see Supplementary Extended Methods). A BD LSRFortessa SORP cytometer was used to measure the amount of Alexa Fluor 488 dye (EdU-positive cells) and PI (DNA content). Apoptosis Analysis Apoptosis was measured in siRNA transfection experiments and in combined drug treatments using the Annexin-V-Alexa Fluor 568 antibody (Roche and Life Technologies). This was combined with bis-benzimide dye (Sigma) staining for the detection of late apoptotic and necrotic cells (see Supplementary Extended Methods). A BD LSRFortessa SORP cytometer was used to measure the amount of Alexa Fluor 568 dye (Annexin-V-positive apoptotic cells) and bis-benzimide (late apoptotic/necrotic cells). Anchorage-Independent Growth Analysis Soft agar assay was performed on the S462 cell line to assess their anchorage-independent growing properties after siRNA delivery or during drug treatment. ST88-14 cell line does not form colonies in vitro. In 6-well plates, an S462 cell suspension was mixed with agarose, plated, and allowed to solidify. Plates were incubated under standard conditions for 2 weeks. Colonies were fixed and stained with crystal violet for 1 h, and plates were scanned (see Supplementary Extended Methods).",Ernest Terribas; Marco Fernández; Helena Mazuelas; Juana Fernández-Rodríguez; Josep Biayna; Ignacio Blanco; Gabriela Bernal; Irma Ramos-Oliver; Craig Thomas; Rajiv Guha; Xiaohu Zhang; Bernat Gel; Cleofé Romagosa; Marc Ferrer; Conxi Lázaro; Eduard Serra,Neuro-oncology advances,2020-07,10.1093/noajnl/vdz061,minimal,True
PMID:33160273,Modeling tumors of the peripheral nervous system associated with Neurofibromatosis type 1: Reprogramming plexiform neurofibroma cells.,"Plexiform neurofibromas (pNFs) are benign tumors of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) that can progress towards a deadly soft tissue sarcoma termed malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). pNFs appear during development in the context of the genetic disease Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) due to the complete loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene in a cell of the neural crest (NC) - Schwann cell (SC) axis of differentiation. NF1(-/-) cells from pNFs can be reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that exhibit an increased proliferation rate and maintain full iPSC properties. Efficient protocols for iPSC differentiation towards NC and SC exist and thus NC cells can be efficiently obtained from NF1(-/-) iPSCs and further differentiated towards SCs. In this review, we will focus on the iPSC modeling of pNFs, including the reprogramming of primary pNF-derived cells, the properties of pNF-derived iPSCs, the capacity to differentiate towards the NC-SC lineage, and how well iPSC-derived NF1(-/-) SC spheroids recapitulate pNF-derived primary SCs. The potential uses of NF1(-/-) iPSCs in pNF modeling and a future outlook are discussed.",,Helena Mazuelas; Meritxell Carrió; Eduard Serra,Stem cell research,2020-12,10.1016/j.scr.2020.102068,abstract_only,False

The reader is equipped with a cuvette port capable of scanning spectra with 1 nm increments and reading up to six wavelengths per scan. It has two monochromator optics, allowing it to scan and read within the wavelength range of 200 to 1000 nm. The reader can accommodate microplates ranging from standard 6-well to 384-well, and it features a 4-zone system that can control the temperature up to 50 °C, ensuring stable performance for temperature-sensitive assays. Additionally, it is supplied with an internal shaker offering three different shaking speeds (low, medium, and high) for efficient solution mixing. The SpectraMax M5 reader is controlled and operated by using the SoftMax ®  Pro Enterprise software, a leading data acquisition and analysis software that includes tools for FDA 21 CFR Part 11 compliance. Chemicals and reagents Selumetinib was purchased from LC Laboratories (Woburn, USA). Koselugo ®  capsules (AstraZeneca, Cambridge, UK) with 25 mg of SEL labelled capsules were obtained from the local Saudi market. DDQ obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Missouri, USA). A 96-Microwell transparent plates used in the photometric assay application were sourced from Corning/Costar, Inc. (Cambridge, USA). Solvents and other chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and Thermo Fischer Scientific (Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). Preparation procedures of standard and capsule solution The major methodology steps are detailed in a previous study [ 20 ]. The carried-out modifications in this work are based on the physiochemical nature of the drug with the following details. A stock solution of SEL standard (2 mg/mL) was prepared by dissolving of an accurately weighed 20 mg quantity of SEL standard material in 10 mL of acetonitrile. Additional dilution of the standard stock solution was applied with acetonitrile to create working solutions with proper concentrations for the conducted experiments. The preparation of the Koselugo ®  capsules sample solution followed this procedure: The contents of 10 capsules were collected and weighed. An amount of powder equivalent to 20 mg of SEL was then transferred into a 10-mL calibrated flask. The powder was dissolved in 5 mL of acetonitrile, and the volume was completed to the mark with acetonitrile. The mixture was shaken vigorously for 10 min. To remove any particulate matter of additives and excipients, the solution was filtered using a 0.4 μm membrane filter connected to a 10-mL syringe. A precise volume of the filtered solution was further diluted with acetonitrile, and the resulting solutions were subjected to analysis using the proposed MW-SPA. Evaluation of association constant The association constant of SEL-DDQ CTC was determined by mixing various SEL concentrations (1.14 × 10 − 4  − 4.59 × 10 − 4  M) with a fixed DDQ concentration (8.8 × 10 − 3  M). Equilibration of the resultant solutions mixtures was carried out for 5 min at room temperature (25 ± 2 ºC). To generate the Benesi-Hildebrand plot [ 24 ], the absorbance of the solutions mixtures was measured at 440 nm. Linear regression analysis of the generated plot was carried out to drive the equation used to determine the association constant. Determination of SEL: DDQ molar ratio The CTC molar ratio between SEL and DDQ was determined by employing the spectrophotometric method [ 25 ]. Master standard solution of SEL was prepared at a molar concentration of 2.66 × 10 –3  M, while DDQ solution was prepared at a molar concentration of 10.64 × 10 –3  M (4 times higher than SEL). A series of solutions were prepared by mixing SEL and DDQ solutions, maintaining a constant SEL concentration and varying DDQ concentrations to achieve SEL: DDQ molar ratios ranging from 0.125 to 4. The reactions took place at ambient temperature (25 ± 2 °C), and the absorbances of the resulting colours were measured at 440 nm, versus blanks treated similarly, except using acetonitrile instead of SEL solution. The measured absorbances were plotted as a function of [DDQ]/[SEL] ratio. The intersecting points of the tangents drawn on the linear lots of the plot were used to determine the molar ratio of the reaction between SEL and DDQ. Computational analysis Density functional theory Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) computations that combine the accuracy of the ab initio quantum chemistry calculations with the speed of MM calculations were performed using the General Atomic and Molecular Electronic Structure System (GAMESS software) [ 26 ]. Calculations using density functional theory (DFT) were done for SEL, DDQ, and SEL-DDQ complex. The composite basis set B3LYP/6-31G was employed to identify the energy properties of the molecular structure system, yielding structures that are similar to those made using standard basis sets. Additionally, a comparison with the real data shows that the vibrational frequencies calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G level are reliable [ 27 ]. With the use of the B3LYP/6-31G basis set [ 28 ,  29 ], the geometries were optimised, and methanol was used as the solvent in Time-dependent DFT computations (TD-DFT) to investigate the electronic spectra. Energy evaluation that exhibits good performance even under heavy CPU demands was conducted using the Direct Self Consistent Field (DirSCF) algorithm [ 30 ]. The authors didn’t include any empirical dispersion correction during the geometry optimizations. “The dispersion correction approach DFT-D provides a qualitative and frequently quantitative explanation of chemical processes involving non-polar molecules that interact primarily via dispersion forces. Unfortunately, the DFT-D approach has some limitations: if the dispersion is not the most important interaction and intermolecular distances become short, such as for hydrogen bonds, the semi-empirical correction, with some density functionals, provides binding energies higher than expected, most likely due to double-counting of correlation effects. Furthermore, DFT-D has only been extensively evaluated on ground-state properties, thus it would be fascinating to extend a similar semi-empirical technique to evaluating the dispersion forces for molecular adducts in excited states” [ 31 ]. Molecular electrostatic potential The molecular electrostatic potential (MESP) is a tool for understanding intermolecular interaction and for predicting the reactive behaviour of chemical systems [ 32 ]. The greatest positive region of the MESP indicates the electron-deficient region, or “hole,” and the most negative value, the lone pair or π-electron density, or “heap” [ 33 ]. The noncovalent contact that occurs within molecules in these systems is represented by the hole-heap interaction. The MESP computations were employed in our investigation to forecast the structure of the noncovalent SEL-DDQ complex and to describe the location of the hole and heap in SEL and DDQ. GAMESS software was used to perform MESP calculations [ 29 ]. Non-covalent interaction index The non-covalent interaction index (NCI) method maps the non-covalent interaction zone in real space to visualize the non-covalent interactions based on the scalar combination of electron density (q) and reduced density gradient (RDG’s) [ 34 ]. The method produces two isosurface bonding regions; the leftmost region to non-covalent interactions and the rightmost one to covalent interactions. The NCI defines the attractive zone of the H-bonding and van der Waals interactions at the low-s value with a negative low-q (q) while the repulsion zone of the steric interactions is defined at the low-s value with a positive low-q [ 34 ]. Hirshfeld surface analysis Mutiwfn 3.7, VMD, and the GAMESS-optimized SEL-DDQ complex were used in the hirshfeld surface HS study of the SEL-DDQ intermolecular interactions. In summary, the accompanying fingerprint plots are the primary focus of discussion for the dnorm adorned HSs. Dnorm is a normalized contact distance that is defined in terms of de, di, and the Van der Waals (VdW) radii of two atoms at a distance di within the surface and a distance de outside of a point on the surface, respectively [ 34 ]. It should be noted that a dnorm adorned HS’s colour scheme reflects the strength of the intermolecular interactions, which range from strong (represented by red) to moderate (represented by white) to weak (represented by blue). MW-SPA experimental procedure From the prepared SEL standard and capsules sample solutions a volume of 100 µL was taken. The taken volumes contains different quantities of SEL ranging from 10 to 200 µg, which in turn were transferred to the wells of the assay plate. Then, 100 µL with a constant quantity of DDQ solution (1%, w/v) was added to each well, and the reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature (25 ± 2 °C) for 5 min. The absorbance of each well was measured at 440 nm using a microwell plate reader. Green chemistry evolution of MW-SPA procedures Analytical eco-scale tool (AES) The eco-friendliness of the assay was evaluated by the AES tool [ 35 ]. This assessment is based on penalty points (PPs) of four parameters with demonstrated environmental harm (solvents used, energy consumed, occupational hazards, and waste produced). A green assay with 100 points is regarded as a prim environment friendly. From these 100 points the assigned PPs for the four parameters are deducted. If the total score is > 75 points then the assay is considered green, if it is 50–75 points the assay is reasonably green and if it is < 50 points then it is inadequate green. Green analytical procedure index (GAPI) The GAPI [ 36 ] is a tool to evaluate the environmental impact of all the analysis steps from start to end. The evaluation is according to 15 parameters represented in 15 sections pictogram. The sections are presented in a colour scheme of green, yellow and red. The green colour implies an eco-friendly procedure while the red colour implies the contrary. Analytical greenness (AGREE) The AGREE [ 37 ] is a metric software assess the greenness of an assay based on 12 Green Analytical Chemistry (GAC) principles. The software automatically generates a circular pictogram of 12 sections, distinguishes their impact on the greenness according to colour which range from deep green (= 1) to deep red (= 0). The total score is automatically calculated as a unit fraction and presented in the pictogram centre.",Sarah Alrubia; Wafa A AlShehri; Awwad A Radwan; Nourah Z Alzoman; Ibrahim A Darwish,BMC chemistry,2025-01-29,10.1186/s13065-024-01353-6,minimal,True
PMID:8089100,An anti-Ras function of neurofibromatosis type 2 gene product (NF2/Merlin).,"Previously, we have cloned a candidate for the 595-amino acid neurofibromatosis type 2 tumor suppressor called NF2 or Merlin, with striking sequence similarity in its N-terminal half to an F-actin-binding protein family called TERM, which includes talin, ezrin, radixin, and moesin (Trofatter, J. A., MacCollin, M. M., Rutter, J. L., Murrell, J. R., Duyao, M. P., Parry, D. M., Eldridge, R., Kley, N., Menon, A. G., Pulaski, K., Haase, V. H., Ambrose, C. M., Munro, D., Bove, C., Haines, J. L., Martuza, R. L., MacDonald, M. E., Seizinger, B. R., Short, M. P., Buckler, A. J., and Gusella, J. F. (1993) Cell 72, 791-800). In an attempt to determine whether NF2 serves as a tumor suppressor and if so whether its N-terminal half is involved in its anti-oncogenicity, both full-length NF2 and its N-terminal half (NF2-N, residues 9-359) have been expressed in v-Ha-Ras-transformed NIH/3T3 cells. Like neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) fragments (Nur-E-Kamal, M. S. A., Varga, M., and Maruta, H. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 22331-22337), full-length NF2 can reverse the Ras-induced malignant phenotype, i.e. anchorage-independent growth in a soft agar, and restore contact inhibition of cell growth, indicating that NF2 is indeed a tumor suppressor. Furthermore, NF2-N also suppresses the Ras-induced malignant phenotype, although it appears to be less effective than the full-length NF2. These observations indicate that the anti-Ras function of NF2 resides in part in its N-terminal half. Thus, NF2 appears to be a new member of the tumor suppressor family of actin-cytoskeleton-associated proteins, which includes vinculin, alpha-actinin, tropomyosin-1, gelsolin, and tensin.",,A Tikoo; M Varga; V Ramesh; J Gusella; H Maruta,The Journal of biological chemistry,1994-09-23,,abstract_only,False
PMID:24882693,Molecular conformation of the full-length tumor suppressor NF2/Merlin--a small-angle neutron scattering study.,"The tumor suppressor protein Merlin inhibits cell proliferation upon establishing cell-cell contacts. Because Merlin has high level of sequence similarity to the Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin family of proteins, the structural model of Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin protein autoinhibition and cycling between closed/resting and open/active conformational states is often employed to explain Merlin function. However, recent biochemical studies suggest alternative molecular models of Merlin function. Here, we have determined the low-resolution molecular structure and binding activity of Merlin and a Merlin(S518D) mutant that mimics the inactivating phosphorylation at S518 using small-angle neutron scattering and binding experiments. Small-angle neutron scattering shows that, in solution, both Merlin and Merlin(S518D) adopt a closed conformation, but binding experiments indicate that a significant fraction of either Merlin or Merlin(S518D) is capable of binding to the target protein NHERF1. Upon binding to the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate lipid, the wild-type Merlin adopts a more open conformation than in solution, but Merlin(S518D) remains in a closed conformation. This study supports a rheostat model of Merlin in NHERF1 binding and contributes to resolving a controversy about the molecular conformation and binding activity of Merlin.","Experimental Procedures Protein expression and purification The human cDNA encoding the full-length Merlin isoform 1 was subcloned into the pET32a vector (EMD Biosciences, Inc), with a 6XHis plus thioredoxin tag at the amino-terminal end of the expressed proteins. The Merlin(S518D) and Merlin(S518E) mutants were generated with the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). The expression plasmids were transformed into the Rosetta2(DE3) competent cells (EMD Biosciences, Inc). The bacterial cells were grown in LB medium in the presence of 0.100 mg/ml ampicillin and 0.034 mg/ml chloramphenicol. At cell optical density at 600 nm of about 0.8, the cells were induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the cells were grown at 20 °C for overnight. The cells were harvested and pelleted. To purify protein, the cell pellets were suspended in 50-80 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM Imidazole, 0.1 mM PMSF) and incubated at 4 °C with agitation for 30 min. The homogenized lysate was sonicated on ice for 11 cycles of 30 s on and 30 s off, followed by centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C and the supernatant saved for next step. The supernatant ran through a 5 ml HiTrap Chelating Sepharose™ High Performance (GE healthcare) and washed extensively with 200 ml of lysis buffer to remove impurities and non-specific bindings. Next, the bound Merlin eluted with adequate amount of elution buffer (50mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, pH 7.5, 500 mM Imidazole, 0.1 mM PMSF) and then the best fractions were pooled and dialyzed in Tris 20 mM, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM DTT and 0.5 mM EDTA. The thioredoxin tag of the purified proteins was cleaved by homemade tobacco etch virus protease. Again a second run of Ni 2+ -chelating column purification was performed to remove the cleaved tag, residual un-cleaved proteins, and the His-tagged TEV. Further purification followed by gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare). An extinction coefficient of 55350 M -1 .cm- 1  was used to determine protein concentration of wild type merlin in reduced condition and finally, the purity of the proteins estimated by SDS- PAGE ( Fig. 1 ). The concentration of a purified Merlin or Merlin mutant was determined using a UV spectrometer at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 55350 M -1 cm -1 . For SANS experiments, the deuterated Merlin were expressed in M9/D2O medium using our published protocols [ 32 ,  37 ,  51 ]. The procedure for purifying the deuterated proteins are the same as the undeuterated proteins. Static and dynamic light scattering The light scattering measurements were performed using DynaPro NanoStar (Wyatt Technology Corporation). Before measurements, the purified proteins in solution were centrifuged at 14000 rpm at room temperature for 15 minutes. Protein concentrations were kept constant at 5 μM in the same buffer as that in gel filtration experiments. DYNAMIC software (V7.1.4) was used to obtain the normalized time autocorrelation function, polydispersity, and the absolute molecular mass. Circular dichroism spectroscopy For CD measurements, proteins were dialyzed against 20 mM Potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT after purification. CD experiments were performed on a J-180 JASCO circular dichroism spectropolarimeter equipped with a temperature controlled cell holder using the Spectra Manager control (V1. 17.00) and application (V1.3.00) software package (JASCO). The instrument was calibrated with (+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid. Far-UV CD spectra recorded in a 1 mm quartz at 25 °C in a wavelength range of 190-250 nm with 1.0 nm bandwidth, using the continuous-mode setting, with 1.0 s response and a scan speed of 50 nm/min. Two spectra were averaged, and the background was corrected against buffer. The molar ellipticity [θ] was calculated from the formula: [θ]= (θ×100 Mw)/(cl), where c is the protein concentration in mg/ml, Mw is the molecular mass, l is the light path length in centimeters, and θ is the measured ellipticity in degrees at wavelength λ. Data deconvolution and normalization were carried out using DichroWeb[ 60 ]. Surface plasmon resonance Surface plasmon resonance (SRP) experiments were performed on a Biacore X100 (GE Life Sciences, NJ) at 25.0 °C for determining Merlin binding to NHERF1. Before the binding experiments, the hydrogel matrix of the CM5 Biosensor chip (GE Life Sciences, NJ) was activated by N-hydroxysuccinimide and N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (GE Life Sciences, NJ). The ligand, which was 5 μg/ml NHERF1 was dissolved in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.2, was injected to coat the activated surface. Uncross-linked ligand was washed away, and uncoated sites were blocked by 1 M ethanolamine, pH 8.5. The analyte, Merlin or Merlin(S518D), was dissolved in HBS-EP buffer containing 10 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant polysorbate 20. The analyte was injected at a series of concentrations over the NHERF1-coated surfaces at 10 μl/min for 3 min. At the end of each injection, the sensor chip was regenerated with 4.0 M MgCl2, 50 mM triethylamine, pH 9.15, and HBS-EP buffer. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry ITC experiments were run in a MicroCal™ Auto-iTC 200  system at 25 °C. Before ITC experiments, all samples were dialyzed in buffer containing HEPES 10 mM pH7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA and 0.5 mM β-ME. For determining NHERF1 binding to FERM or Merlin constructs, the reaction cells were filled with 460  μ L of 20  μ M FERM or Merlin, and NHERF (100-200 μM) was titrated into the cell in 19 injections of 2  μ L each, with 150 s intervals between each injection. The data were analyzed using the manufacturer provided software Bindworks (version 3.1.5, Calorimetry Sciences Corp. Lindon, UT) to yield the stoichiometry (n), association constant ( Ka ) and observed enthalpy change ( Δ Ho ) for the binding reactions. For ITC experiments to determine the binding of Merlin to PIP2, one milligram of PIP2 from porcine brain (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc) was dissolved in solvent CHCl3/MeOH/H2O (20:9:1). The solvent was evaporated using a Rotavap for 30-40 min, and then the formed solid film was dissolved in the ITC buffer containing HEPES 10mM, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA and 0.5 mM beta Mercaptoethanol (B-ME) and passed through filter 0.2 micron. To remove additional ammonium salts already exists in the solution, the PIP2 solution was dialyzed against ITC buffer overnight in cold room. For ITC experiments, the reaction cell was filled with 460  μ L of 30  μ M protein, and PIP2 (0.6-0.9 mM) was titrated into the cell in 19 injections of 2  μ L each, with constant stirring at 1000 rpm throughout the experiment and 150 s spacing between each injection. The heat of ligand dilution was obtained from the independent injections of PIP2 into ITC buffer. This value was subtracted from all of the injection points during data analysis. Small angle neutron scattering experiments SANS experiments were performed on the extended Q-range small-angle neutron scattering (EQ-SANS) instrument at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) located at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) [ 61 ]. All measurements used a sample-to-detector distance of 4m. Two wavelength settings were used: 60 Hz with a wavelength, λ, band of 2.5 Å to 6.1 Å; and 30 Hz (frame-skipping mode) with two wavelength bands of 2.5 Å to 6.1 Å and 9.4 Å to 13.4 Å. The former configuration provides a useful  Q -range (the wavevector transfer,  Q  = 4π sin(θ)/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle) of ∼0.01 Å -1  to ∼0.22 Å -1 , while the latter provides additional low  Q  data (down to ∼0.005 Å -1 ) with the same practical upper limit. The choice of configuration was determined by the expected size of the particles being studied and to probe for high molecular weight contaminants, such as protein aggregates. Samples were loaded into 1 mm pathlength circular-shaped quartz cuvettes (Hellma USA, Plainville, NY) and SANS measurements performed at 20 °C. Data reduction followed standard procedures that are implemented in MantidPlot ( http://www.mantidproject.org/ ) to correct for dark current (background radiation and electronic noise), the detector sensitivity and the scattering contribution from the solvent and empty cells before being azimuthally averaged to produce  I(Q)  vs.  Q . The data were scaled into absolute units of cm -1  using a calibrated standard [ 62 ]. SANS data analysis and 3-D shape reconstruction The length distribution function P(r), radius of gyration R g , the forward scattering intensity I(0), and the maximum dimension D max  were calculated from the scattering data using the program GNOM [ 63 ]. The 3-D “dummy bead” coordinates were generated using the program DAMMIN [ 41 ]. Multiple calculations were performed using DAMMIN, and the generated 10 structures were averaged and filtered using the program DAMAVER and DAMFILT [ 64 ]. The 3-D density map was generated from the averaged coordinates using the program Situs [ 65 ]. The fitting and docking of the high-resolution structure to the density map were performed using Situs or UCS Chimera [ 66 ].",Jahan Ali Khajeh; Jeong Ho Ju; Moussoubaou Atchiba; Marc Allaire; Christopher Stanley; William T Heller; David J E Callaway; Zimei Bu,Journal of molecular biology,2014-07-29,10.1016/j.jmb.2014.05.011,minimal,True
PMID:6490532,The effects of mesencephalic neural crest cell extirpation on the development of chicken embryos.,"The mesencephalic neural crest cells of Hamburger-Hamilton Stage 9-Stage 11 chick embryos were surgically extirpated unilaterally in 148 embryos and bilaterally in 8 embryos. Sham operations were performed unilaterally on 16 control embryos and bilaterally on one control embryo. Embryos were fixed at various time intervals after operation, studied macroscopically, and by light and scanning electron microscopy, and their development compared with that of 47 normal embryos. The extirpated mesencephalic region was repopulated by crest cells within 6-8 hours after operation. These 'new' crest cells migrated from adjacent neuraxial levels (principally the metencephalon and prosencephalon) along the basement membrane of the neural tube and the regenerating ectoderm. At prosencephalic and metencephalic levels, both intrinsic hyperplasia of migrating cells and prolonged migration of crest cells from the dorsomedian part of the neural tube contributed the additional cells required to repopulate the mesencephalic region. Morphogenesis and differentiation of all crest cell derivatives were normal and craniofacial malformations were absent. Thus the neural crest and neural tube can compensate for an extensive regional loss, premigratory crest cells are neither regionally patterned nor determined (as prosencephalic and metencephalic cells give rise to normal mesencephalic derivatives) and regional failure of crest cell formation is an unlikely facial pathogenetic mechanism. Previous workers who observed facial malformations following crest cell extirpations performed the latter by removing the lips of the neural tube which not only removed the crest cells but also the compensatory mechanism. Cervical scoliosis was observed in extirpated embryos but not in controls. The pathogenesis of this scoliosis may be related to the process of compensation, which could disturb the sequential differentiation of the neural tube and so disorganise the mechanisms of normal axial flexion. These observations may be relevant to the pathogenesis of some forms of congenital and infantile idiopathic scoliosis; such scoliosis in man is frequently present in neurofibromatosis--a neural crest lesion.",,G J McKee; M W Ferguson,Journal of anatomy,1984-10,,abstract_only,False
PMID:6093111,Characterization of nerve growth factor receptor in neural crest tumors using monoclonal antibodies.,"The nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor was characterized by using a new series of anti-receptor monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). These MAbs (i) showed significantly greater reactivity with a melanoma cell line expressing higher levels of NGF receptor, (ii) inhibited the binding of 125I-labeled NGF to its receptor, and (iii) immunoprecipitated both metabolically labeled and 125I-labeled NGF affinity-labeled receptor. These experiments defined the receptor as a 75-kDa cell-surface protein. The NGF receptor was visualized by immunoperoxidase staining in tissue sections of human nevi, melanomas, neurofibromas, a pheochromocytoma, and peripheral nerves.

PMID:17924978,Natural history of meningioma development in mice reveals: a synergy of Nf2 and p16(Ink4a) mutations.,"Meningiomas account for approximately 30% of all primary central nervous system tumors and are found in half of neurofibromatosis type 2 patients often causing significant morbidity. Although most meningiomas are benign, 10% are classified as atypical or anaplastic, displaying aggressive clinical behavior. Biallelic inactivation of the neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor is associated with meningioma formation in all NF2 patients and 60% of sporadic meningiomas. Deletion of the p16(INK4a)/p14(ARF) locus is found in both benign and malignant meningiomas, while mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene is uncommon. Previously, we inactivated Nf2 in homozygous conditional knockout mice by adenoviral Cre delivery and showed that Nf2 loss in arachnoid cells is rate-limiting for meningioma formation. Here, we report that additional nullizygosity for p16(Ink4a) increases the frequency of meningioma and meningothelial proliferation in these mice without modifying the tumor grade. In addition, by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to screen a large cohort of mutant mice, we were able to detect meningothelial proliferation and meningioma development opening the way to future studies in which therapeutic interventions can be tested as preclinical assessment of their potential clinical application.","METHODS 
 Mice.  To obtain  Nf2 
 flox2/flox2 
 ;p16 
 Ink4a*/*  mice,  Nf2 
 flox2/flox2  mice  (4)  on the FVB/N background were bred to  p16 
 Ink4a*/*  mice  (11)  on a FVB/N/129Ola mixed background, and the resulting  Nf2 
 flox2/+ ;  p16 
 Ink4a*/+  mice were intercrossed. All mice used for this analysis were predominantly FVB/N mixed strain with contemporaneous littermates serving as controls. Pathogens were tested on a quarterly basis, and all serologies tested were negative throughout the study. All animal care and experimentation reported herein were conducted in compliance with the guidelines and with the specific approval of Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the French Department of Agriculture. 
 Injection of adenoviruses.  Cre recombinase was targeted to the mouse leptomeninges by direct injection of 3 µL (1 ×  10 8  plaque‐forming units) of  adCre  suspension into the subarachnoidal space on postnatal day 2 by trans‐orbital or subdural approach, as previously described  (6) . 
 Histopathology and immunohistochemistry.  Mice were sacrificed by CO 2  inhalation when seriously ill (rarely) or after the last magnetic resonance (MR) image acquisition at 15 months and a necropsy was performed. Histopathological analysis was performed as previously described  (6) . PGDS immunohistochemistry was carried out on adjacent paraffin sections using affinity‐purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies (1:500; Santa Cruz, CA, USA sc‐14825) and standard techniques (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark). The terminology used for the description of the meningothelial lesions in the mouse models relies on the WHO classification of human tumors as a reference  (13) . The term “meningothelial hyperplasia” is not used, as in humans that refers to the proliferation of reactive, normal arachnoid cells. “Meningothelial proliferation” refers to very small (microscopic) lesions composed of meningothelial cells that represent early tumor formation. “Meningioma” refers to a larger lesion, with features similar to a WHO grade I meningioma in human. “Meningioma  en plaque ” refers to a meningioma with a growth pattern of diffuse thickening of the dura, similar to meningioma  en plaque  in humans. 
 Electron microscopy.  Paraffin‐embedded tissue was cut into nine pieces, placed in xylene overnight, rehydrated in graded ethanols (100% to 25%), and then placed in gluteraldehyde. Subsequently, the tissue was post‐fixed in osmium tetroxide, stained with uranyl acetate, dehydrated in graded ethanol solutions, infiltrated with propylene oxide/Epon mixtures, flat embedded in pure Epon, and polymerized overnight at 60°C. One‐micrometer sections were cut, stained with toluidine blue, and examined by light microscopy. The best section containing meningioma was chosen to proceed for electron microscopy study and trimmed accordingly. Thin sections were cut with an LKB8801 ultramicrotome and diamond knife, stained with Sato's lead, and examined in a Phillips 301 transmission electron microscope. 
 MRI.  MRI was used to identify and localize meningiomas. MR study was performed on a 4.7 Tesla microimaging system (Biospec, Bruker BioSpin MRI, Inc., Ertlingen, Germany). The system consists of three‐axis self‐shielded magnetic field gradients, with 30 G/cm maximum gradient amplitude in all three channels. Under anesthesia by inhalation of 1%–2% of isoflurane (IsoFlo ® , Abbott Laboratories, Abbot Park, IL, USA), all animals were intraperitoneally injected  (1)  a MR contrast agent, Gd‐DTPA (Magnevist ® , Schering, Leverkusen, Germany) at a dose of 0.8 mL/kg body weight and placed 15 minutes later in the radio frequency coil (inside diameter 35 mm). First the localizer imaging with a first echo sequence (rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement: RARE) was conducted on three orthogonal axes. Subsequently, transverse T2‐weighted images (T2‐WIs) and T1‐weighted images (T1‐WIs) were acquired with a RARE and a conventional spin‐echo sequence, respectively, on entire brain. A pulse repetition time and echo time were 2000 and 40 ms for T2‐WI and 500 and 11 ms for T1‐WI. Other parameters were: 3 cm field of view, 128 × 128 matrix size, eight (for T2‐WI) and four (for T1‐WI) averages, resulting in a total scan time of approximately 2.4 and 4.5 minutes, respectively. Some relevant mice were reimaged before injection of contrast agent to get T1‐weighted images without contrast enhancement. After the brain imaging, some animals that showed neurological symptoms were repositioned and subjected to spinal cord imaging. After the localization, spinal cords were imaged in 1 mm sagittal sections. The other imaging parameters were the same as those in the brain imaging described above. The MRI findings were qualitatively analyzed by two experienced investigators, M.K. and M.T., with consensus. MR studies were repeated at 6, 9, 12, and 15 months followed by pathological examination of all mice.

PMID:37608248,Aberrant oscillatory activity in neurofibromatosis type 1: an EEG study of resting state and working memory.,"BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder commonly associated with impaired cognitive function. Despite the well-explored functional roles of neural oscillations in neurotypical populations, only a limited number of studies have investigated oscillatory activity in the NF1 population. METHODS: We compared oscillatory spectral power and theta phase coherence in a paediatric sample with NF1 (N = 16; mean age: 13.03 years; female: n = 7) to an age/sex-matched typically developing control group (N = 16; mean age: 13.34 years; female: n = 7) using electroencephalography measured during rest and during working memory task performance. RESULTS: Relative to typically developing children, the NF1 group displayed higher resting state slow wave power and a lower peak alpha frequency. Moreover, higher theta power and frontoparietal theta phase coherence were observed in the NF1 group during working memory task performance, but these differences disappeared when controlling for baseline (resting state) activity. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, results suggest that NF1 is characterised by aberrant resting state oscillatory activity that may contribute towards the cognitive impairments experienced in this population. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03310996 (first posted: October 16, 2017).","Methods We compared oscillatory spectral power and theta phase coherence in a paediatric sample with NF1 ( N  = 16; mean age: 13.03 years; female:  n  = 7) to an age/sex-matched typically developing control group ( N  = 16; mean age: 13.34 years; female:  n  = 7) using electroencephalography measured during rest and during working memory task performance. Methods The current study is an extension of the analysis presented in Pobric et al. [ 16 ]. Specifically, we conducted oscillatory analyses on the same participants, using the same EEG resting state and n-back data, and used some (see the ‘ Procedure ’ section) of the same behavioural measures described in Pobric et al. [ 16 ]. Participants Thirty-two participants completed this study. Participants were adolescents with NF1 ( n  = 16) and age- and sex-matched controls ( n  = 16). These data were collected as part of a pilot intervention study involving the use of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) [NCT03310996]. 1  Post hoc analysis of Ribeiro et al.’s [ 17 ] resting state theta effect in NF1 using G*Power [ 42 ] suggests that  n  = 17 participants per group would result in 79% power to detect an effect size of  d  = 0.89. Participants were required to meet each of the eligibility criteria in Table  1 . 2  We selected a pragmatic sample of children with NF1. Previous literature suggests that social communication difficulties (not meeting the criteria for ASD) may be very common affecting up to 60% of children with NF1 [ 3 ]. Given how common comorbid neurodevelopmental conditions such as ASD, ADHD, and developmental coordination disorder are in NF1, we decided to include a sample that would be representative of the children seen in the clinic. Parents/guardians gave oral and written consent, and adolescents assent (where developmentally appropriate), prior to participation. Table 1 Eligibility criteria Eligibility criteria NF1 (i) Aged 11–16 years (ii) Satisfied the National Institute of Health’s NF1 diagnostic criteria (iii) No history of epilepsy (iv) No ongoing active treatment for any NF1-related complications (e.g. chemotherapy for optic gliomas) (v) No other clinically significant unrelated illness CON (i) Aged 11–16 years (ii) No pre-existing medical conditions or neurodevelopmental disorders The NF1 sample was recruited through the Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine, Neurofibromatosis charities, social media platforms, and newsletters and were adolescents who satisfied the National Institute of Health’s (1988) diagnostic criteria for NF1 [ 43 ]. The control sample (CON) was age- and sex-matched at group level and recruited via institutional newsletter advertisements and contacting local schools. Demographic information of the sample is reported in Table  2 . There were no significant differences between groups in age ( t (30)  = 0.540,  p  = 0.593) or sex ( χ 2  = 0.00,  p  = 1.00). 3  In a previous paper reporting on this sample [ 16 ], the NF1 group demonstrated poorer performance relative to typically developing controls on various cognitive measures, including measures of working memory (i.e. digit-span forward/backwards) and attention (Sky search attention, TEACh). Table 2 Participant demographics Group Demographic NF1 CON Age (M ± SD (range)) 13.03 ± 1.66 (11.33–16.92) years 13.34 ± 1.61 (11.25–16.58) years Sex (male/female) 9/7 9/7 NF1 mutation (inherited/de novo) 7/9 N/A Medication Melatonin ( n  = 2) Methylphenidate ( n  = 4) N/A Pre-existing clinical diagnoses ADHD and ASD ( n  = 3) ADHD ( n  = 1) ASD ( n  = 2) N/A Procedure This study received ethical approval from the Greater Manchester West Research Ethics Committee (17/NW/0364) and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. During the study visit, participants and their parents/guardians were first familiarised with the EEG equipment and study procedures. Subsequently, a battery of behavioural and cognitive assessments was administered, including parent-rated and cognitive measures that tapped into: overall adaptive function, inattention, hyperactivity, communication, daily living skills, socialisation, short-term memory, working memory, sustained attention, and attentional switching, followed by EEG. This paper focuses on parent-reported 4  Adaptive Behaviour Composite (ABC) scores on the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scale (VABS-III) [ 44 ], performance on an adaptive auditory n-back task [ 16 ], and performance on a non-adaptive visual n-back task [ 16 ] performed during EEG (see Pobric et al. [ 16 ] for details of the other tasks performed that are not reported here). VABS-II measures daily living skills, socialisation, and communication, with ABC scores reflecting standardised age equivalent overall adaptive functioning [ 44 ]. Performance on the adaptive auditory and non-adaptive visual n-back tasks measure working memory. Each trial of the n-back task began with a fixation cross ( +) presented in the centre of the screen (adaptive auditory n-back: 2500 ms; non-adaptive visual n-back: 2000 ms, + / − random jitter up to 100 ms in 17 ms steps). This was followed by a single uppercase English consonant (C, G, H, K, P, Q, T, or W) presented aurally (auditory n-back: 1000 ms) or visually in the centre of the screen (non-adaptive visual n-back: 500 ms). Participants were instructed to respond as quickly and accurately as possible with a mouse-click whenever the current stimulus was the same as the one presented ‘n’ steps back in the sequence. No responses were required for non-targets. The auditory n-back was adaptive, such that after each block of 20 trials, the difficulty level of the next block was adjusted based on the participant’s performance to ensure participants were always training at the top of their ability (see Pobric et al. [ 16 ] for further task details). In contrast, the visual n-back performed during EEG recording was not designed to push participants’ ability to their limit. Instead, it was developed to provide a sufficient number of trials to permit the investigation of electrophysiological differences between the groups during working memory performance. In this non-adaptive task, four fixed-order blocks were presented: 1-back, 2-back, 2-back, and 1-back, with self-paced breaks in between to reduce fatigue. In each block, there were 100 trials, 25 of which were target trials (i.e. the same letter as ‘n’ screens back). As existing studies report a load-related increase in power during working memory maintenance [ 45 ], two load levels (‘ n ’ = 1 and 2) were included to permit investigation of load-dependent effects on EEG measures. EEG acquisition EEG data were recorded using an ActiveTwo system (BioSemi, Amsterdam, Netherlands) with 64 EEG channels in standard 10–10 system locations plus HEOG, VEOG, and mastoids, with a sampling rate of 512 Hz. During the recording, participants were asked to remain still, in a comfortable/relaxed position, and to minimise eye movements and blinking where possible. Recording started with 2.5 min of eyes open and 2.5 min of eyes closed resting state, in which participants were asked to simply relax and not think of anything in particular. This was followed by recording during the visual n-back task. EEG analysis MATLAB (2019a) and SPM12 (version 7771) were used to conduct data analyses. Custom functions [ 46 ,  47 ] calling several functions from EEGLAB (version 13.6.5b) and FieldTrip (embedded in SPM release) were used. Common pre-processing Continuous EEG data were re-referenced to averaged mastoids, high-pass filtered (0.1 Hz), downsampled (256 Hz), low-pass filtered (resting state: 200 Hz; task-related: 120 Hz), and notch-filtered (48–52 Hz), before epoching (resting state: arbitrary 1900 ms (baseline correction: 0–1900 ms, i.e. mean-centring); task-related: 0–1900 ms relative to stimulus onset). The eyes open and eyes closed data were then concatenated (i.e. combined into the same file). Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to project blink and eye-movement signals out of the data. 5  Channels containing noise unrelated to blinks (characterised by large positive deflections) or eye movements (characterised by square-wave deflections) were temporarily omitted (channel TP7 was persistently bad and omitted from ICA for all participants). Thirty-two components were extracted from EEG channel data only. ICA components with uniquely high temporal correlations with VEOG and HEOG, and/or uniquely high spatial correlations with the blink topography, were identified using custom code [ 46 ] and following the procedure described in Pobric et al. [ 16 ]. The resulting weight matrix (less the artefact components) was applied to the epoched data using SPM12’s ‘montage’ function. Baseline correction was then re-applied on the ICA-cleaned data. Epochs were rejected as noisy if they contained signal that exceeded a threshold (resting state: 200 μV; task-related: 120 μV; higher threshold for resting state data due to higher alpha power during eyes closed resting state). A channel was declared ‘bad’ if the threshold was exceeded on > 20% of trials, and epoch rejection was re-run ignoring any bad channels. To reconstruct these noisy channels, a channel-weight interpolation matrix was created using FieldTrip’s ‘channelrepair’ function and applied to the epoched data using SPM12’s ‘montage’ function. EEG data were then re-referenced to the common average reference. The mean number of components removed, channels interpolated, and trials remaining can be seen in Table  3 .

Two participants were excluded from the NF1 group, one due to having fewer than 15 valid trials in the eyes open condition and the other due to low-quality data (i.e. all channels automatically marked ‘bad’ during the artefact detection routine). The sample used for the resting state analyses therefore comprised 30 participants ( n  = 16 CON;  n  = 14 NF1). Task-related analysis Trials with incorrect responses were excluded. Subsequent analyses were conducted on target and non-target trial data without distinguishing between these conditions, since n-back performance requires maintenance of information during both trial types, particularly in the late post-ERP time window (described below). For the same reason, the number of non-target trials was not decimated to match the number of target trials (which was done in the P300 analysis presented by Pobric et al. [ 16 ]). To be eligible for inclusion participants were required to have a minimum of 15 valid epochs remaining in each load (1-/2-back) after artefact-contaminated trials and incorrect trials were removed. One participant from the NF1 group was excluded owing to having fewer than 15 valid trials in the 2-back load level (this was a different participant from the two resting state exclusions). The sample size used for the task-related analyses therefore comprised 31 participants ( n  = 16 CON;  n  = 15 NF1). Spectral power For estimation of task-related power, the time window of interest was 900–1900 ms post-stimulus onset (i.e. during the fixation cross of the next trial). This time window was chosen as existing studies investigating WM-related oscillatory activity typically use the maintenance period of the working memory task as the time window of interest as increased oscillatory activity is observed during this period [ 22 ,  26 ,  36 ,  48 ]. We followed the previous literature’s definition of the maintenance period as the time following a response to the stimuli, determined using the average (or median) response time on the given task [ 36 ]. In the current study, the average response time over 1-/2-back blocks was 627 ± 124 ms (median: 601 ms). However, to ensure that the majority of participants had responded, 900 ms was chosen as the beginning of the time window. The time window ended at 1900 ms to provide a sufficient number of samples for power estimation. For consistency, the same time window (in the arbitrary epoch), and therefore number of samples, was used for the estimation of resting state power. For each EEG channel and epoch (resting state: eyes open and eyes closed; task-related: 1-back and 2-back), a Fast Fourier Transform with a Hanning window and a frequency resolution of 1 Hz was used to extract frequency spectra collapsed over time (900–1900 ms). The resulting power values were then log-transformed before averaging spectra over epochs. For exploratory analysis, average log-transformed power over all EEG channels was computed in canonical frequency bands: delta: 1–3 Hz; theta: 4–7 Hz; alpha: 8–11 Hz; beta: 12–29 Hz; low-gamma: 30–47 Hz, and high-gamma: 53–100 Hz. Additionally, as the literature consistently reports increased mid-frontal theta power during working memory maintenance [ 22 ], we performed targeted analysis of task-related mid-frontal theta (4–7 Hz) power. To achieve this, log-transformed power was averaged over channels Fz, F1, and F2 to create a mid-frontal region of interest prior to statistical analysis. We measured absolute power (i.e. power in one frequency band, independent of activity in other frequency bands), as opposed to relative power (i.e. power in one frequency band divided by the amount of activity in all frequency bands) to avoid the potential confound that any abnormalities in one frequency band may affect the relative power of other frequency bands—a particular concern in neurodevelopmental disorder studies [ 49 ]. Peak alpha frequency Differences in peak alpha frequency (PAF) between groups were investigated. PAF was defined as the frequency with the maximum power in a loose alpha range (6.5–13.5 Hz) at channel Pz. Pz was chosen as alpha power is typically high at this channel [ 50 ]. For analysis of PAF, for each EEG channel and epoch (eyes open/closed), a Fast Fourier Transform with a Hanning window and a frequency resolution of 0.25 Hz was used to extract frequency spectra collapsed over time (arbitrary 1900 ms epoch). First, each individual’s 1D spectrum was adjusted to reduce 1/f noise as this flattens the spectrum and causes the alpha peak to ‘pop out’ [ 51 ]. This was achieved by fitting a second-order polynomial to the log-transformed frequencies (omitting alpha and notch-filter frequencies), and the difference between the spectrum and this model was computed. The resulting spectrum was smoothed with a Gaussian kernel to remove spurious peaks. Next, four adjustments were made based on visual inspection of each participant’s spectrum: Two CON and one NF1 participant had maxima that fell on the ascending slope of the beta peak (eyes open: 12.25 Hz, 13.25 Hz, and 12.75 Hz; eyes closed: 13.25 Hz, 12.75 Hz), and these were adjusted to small visible alpha peaks (eyes open: 11.50 Hz, 10.25 Hz, and 10.75 Hz; eyes closed: 11.75 Hz, 11.75 Hz) that our algorithm had missed, and one NF1 participant’s maximum fell on the descending delta slope (eyes open and closed: 6.5 Hz) and was adjusted to small visible alpha peaks (eyes open: 7 Hz, eyes closed: 7.5 Hz) missed by the algorithm. Theta phase coherence Prior to estimating phase coherence, the task-related data were spatially filtered using the Surface Laplacian, implemented using the laplacian_perrinX function in MATLAB [ 52 ]. The Surface Laplacian reduces the influence of volume conduction, which is particularly important given the electrode-level connectivity analysis performed [ 53 ]. We investigated theta phase coherence in the frontoparietal network (Fig.  1 ). The mid-frontal region acted as a seed region and coherence was estimated between this region and left-parietal, mid-parietal, and right-parietal regions [ 54 ]. Each region comprised of a set of electrodes: mid-frontal (F1/Fz/F2), left-parietal (P3/P5/P7), mid-parietal (P1/Pz/P2), and right-parietal (P4/P6/P8). Coherence was estimated between each possible mid-frontal–parietal connection (i.e. 27 channel pairs), before averaging coherence over electrode sets, resulting in three coherence estimates: mid-frontal to (1) left-parietal (ML), (2) mid-parietal (MM), and (3) right-parietal (MR). Fig. 1 Graphical representation of the channels included in each region of interest. Grey lines indicate the 27 channel pairs that coherence was computed between. Black lines represent coherence averaged over electrode sets (ML: mid-frontal to left-parietal; MM: mid-frontal to mid-parietal; MR: mid-frontal to right-parietal) Theta phase was computed for the whole epoch (0–1900 ms) and then phase coherence was computed in the time window of interest, 900–1500 ms post-stimulus (the time window ended at 1500 ms to prevent inclusion of edge effects as per epoch definition). We calculated inter-site phase clustering (ISPC) [ 20 ]. ISPC over trials is a measure of the consistency of phase angles between two electrodes averaged over trials. For task-related data, ISPC-trials is an appropriate method given our analysis is hypothesis-driven (i.e. limited to the frontoparietal network) and not exploratory (more suited to weighted phase lag index) [ 20 ]. ISPC has been used previously in studies with similar methodology [ 54 ]. Phase angle time series for each channel was extracted by convolving the data with a complex Morlet wavelet (4 cycles) separately for frequencies 4 Hz, 5 Hz, 6 Hz, and 7 Hz. For each time point, the average vector length was calculated across trials to quantify ISPC trials, defined as: where  1 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

ISPC ranges from 0 (perfectly randomly distributed phases) to 1 (perfect phase-locking). For each channel pair, ISPC trials were calculated for each load (1-/2-back) and frequency (4–7 Hz). The result was then averaged over the time window of interest (900–1500 ms post-stimulus), then over frequencies, and finally over channel sets. This resulted in one coherence value for each frontoparietal region pair/load combination (ML, MM, MR × 1-back, 2-back) for each participant. Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS (Version 25). The alpha level was set to 0.05. Visual inspection of Q-Q plots showed that, for each analysis, data were normally distributed. For each analysis of variance discussed below, Box and Whisker plots were inspected for extreme outliers. Values were considered extreme outliers if they fell outside of 3rd quartile + 3*interquartile range and 1st quartile − 3*interquartile range. Where extreme outliers were identified, sensitivity analyses were run. It can be assumed that there were no extreme outliers identified where sensitivity analysis is not reported. In each frequency band, a 2 (CON/NF1) × 2 (open/closed) analysis of variance (ANOVA) was run for the scalp-averaged resting state data. ANOVAs were run separately for each frequency band as there is a known 1/f effect, whereby the means of low frequencies are larger than those of high frequencies [ 55 ]. As frequency bands are estimated independently, and therefore each ANOVA is performed on independent data, no correction for multiple comparisons was used. Moreover, to investigate whether resting state power follows the typical reactivity pattern observed in neurotypical populations [ 39 ], in each frequency band a paired  t -test investigated power differences between eyes open and eyes closed resting state in the NF1 group. A 2 (CON/NF1) × 2 (open/closed) ANOVA was also used to analyse PAF. In the n-back task, maintenance of items in working memory spans trials. We therefore used eyes-open resting state recordings as a baseline to investigate task-specific power modulation (i.e. change from rest). To achieve this, we divided task-related power by resting state power before log-transforming the data 6  (equivalent to: log(task power) − log(resting state power)), which is referred to as  task-specific  power henceforth. In each frequency band, a 2 (CON/NF1) × 2 (1-/2-back) ANOVA investigated scalp-averaged task-specific power. Consistent with the task-related power analyses, we investigated task-specific theta phase coherence by adjusting for baseline (resting state). For comparability, eyes open resting state theta phase coherence was estimated using the same method as task-related phase coherence (note the ‘trials’ in ISPC-trials are arbitrary in resting state). Prior to statistical analysis, resting state phase coherence was subtracted from task-related phase coherence. A 2 (CON/NF1) × 3 (ML/MM/MR) × 2 (1-/2-back) ANOVA using task-specific frontoparietal theta phase coherence was performed. As existing research suggests a significant relationship between age and oscillatory activity in typically developing children that may not be present in neurodevelopmental disorders [ 56 ], Pearson’s correlations were performed to investigate associations between EEG measures and age, followed by statistical significance testing of the difference in  r  between groups to determine whether the relationship between age and oscillatory activity was significantly different between groups. This was achieved using Fisher’s  r  to  z  transformation, before statistically comparing the resulting  z  scores. Moreover, as individuals with NF1 typically exhibit worse overall functioning relative to typically developing children [ 6 ,  57 ], and there is suggestion that oscillatory activity might be a neural marker of cognitive function in neurodevelopmental disorders [ 56 ], Pearson’s correlations were performed to investigate associations between EEG measures and overall adaptive functioning, using Vineland ABC scores. Again, this was followed by statistical significance testing of the difference in  r  between groups to determine whether the relationship between overall adaptive function and oscillatory activity was significantly different between groups. Finally, to assist interpretation of the oscillatory findings, Pearson’s correlations were performed to investigate associations between EEG measures and working memory performance on the adaptive auditory n-back task (which was conducted separately to the EEG session), and the difference in  r  between groups compared. To correct for multiple comparisons, a 5% false discovery rate (FDR) [ 58 ] correction was applied to outcomes with  p -values less than 0.05. FDR was applied to the set of EEG measures for each demographic/behavioural domain (i.e. five  p- values).",Samantha J Booth; Shruti Garg; Laura J E Brown; Jonathan Green; Gorana Pobric; Jason R Taylor,Journal of neurodevelopmental disorders,2023-08-22,10.1186/s11689-023-09492-y,minimal,True
PMID:41602242,Perspectives of Patients and Providers on Chronic Pain Assessment in Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1): A Qualitative Study.,"Background and objective Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) typically presents with physical symptoms, neurocognitive impairments, and chronic pain (CP). Existing pain measures, originally developed for cancer pain or other diseases, do not address the specific healthcare needs of NF1 patients. Hence, this study aimed to examine how individuals with NF1-associated CP and their providers characterize the physical and emotional experiences of pain, as well as their perceived needs in assessing NF1-associated CP. Methods We performed a qualitative study, employing thematic analysis of data collected from six focus groups with 37 patients with NF1 and 16 one-on-one interviews with clinicians involved in NF1 care Results We identified three themes: Describing the Pain Experience, Treating and Dealing With NF1-Associated CP, and Attitudes About Current Pain Measures. Participants perceived certain shortcomings in current pain measures, emphasizing that pain tolerance, adaptation of goals and activities, and the presence of multiple concurrent pain sites are intrinsic to NF1. Patients expressed frustration with the need to quantify a highly subjective and individualized experience using existing measures. Similarly, providers reported frustration that current tools inadequately capture the impact of chronic pain on patients' daily lives, with some preferring more open, conversational approaches to pain assessment. Conclusions The data indicated that pain duration, frequency, regularity, and quality need to be clearly defined and operationalized for patients and providers to similarly understand these domains. Incorporating open-ended items that allow patients to describe their pain in their own words or through images may enhance patients' sense of being understood by their providers. There is a clear need for a standardized pain assessment tool that specifically captures the pain experiences of individuals with NF1.","Materials and methods The methods and findings for the current study have not been previously presented or published. The study was conducted between June 1, 2021, and June 30, 2023. The study was based in New Haven, Connecticut, but data collection occurred remotely; therefore, participants resided in multiple locations across the United States. Recruitment and data collection procedures Recruitment of NF1 patients, referred to hereafter as the “patient group,” involved sending a mass email announcement through the Children’s Tumor Foundation (CTF) registry ( https://www.ctf.org/nf-registry /) that briefly described the study. Membership in the registry requires self-report of a formal NF diagnosis. Individuals interested in participating completed an online screening survey administered via Qualtrics ( www.qualtrics.com ) that collected demographic information including age and gender, contact information, and responses to the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF) [ 8 ], Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) [ 19 ], Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Self Report version (SCID-SR) [ 20 ], and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 Item version (GAD-7) [ 21 ]. The PHQ-9 and GAD-7 are copyrighted by Pfizer Inc. and are freely available for research and clinical use without requiring special permissions. The BPI-SF and SCID-SR were used with written permission from their respective copyright holders. Inclusion criteria for the patient group included: (1) age 18 to 75 years, (2) membership in the NF Registry, (3) a pain severity aggregate score of ≥3 on the BPI-SF [ 8 ] for pain experienced in the previous 2 weeks [ 10 ], (4) agreement to allow audio recording, and (5) current residence in the USA. Exclusion criteria were: (1) evidence of moderate to severe depression or anxiety on the PHQ or GAD-7, or (2) evidence of psychosis or schizophrenia on the SCID-SR [ 20 ]. Members of the research team (FB, KL) reviewed the clinical screening measures, and all eligible individuals were provided with a list of focus group discussion (FGD) dates and times from which they could choose. Recruitment of NF1 clinicians (to be referred to henceforward as the “provider group”) occurred via direct emails to a purposive sample of 100 providers from the CTF “Find a Doctor” page ( https://www.ctf.org/find-a-doctor /). Although the interviews were originally proposed as FGDs, providers’ limited availability rendered it unfeasible to convene these sessions promptly. We therefore conducted individual interviews with the providers instead. Inclusion criteria for the provider group were: (1) provides healthcare to patients with NF1 (e.g., physician, nurse practitioner, speech pathologist, or psychologist) and (2) agreement to be audio-recorded. Data collected included professional/job title, years in practice, and gender, and was obtained at the beginning of each interview. Before beginning the interview sessions, participants in both groups received a brief description of the study, procedures, and risks and benefits, and were informed that participation was voluntary. They then provided verbal informed consent. Participants in the FGDs also agreed to keep the content of the discussions confidential. The Yale University Institutional Review Board reviewed and approved the study and all associated materials. Two members of the research team (FB, KL) with prior training in semi-structured interviews jointly facilitated each FGD session, while the senior author conducted all individual interviews. The FGD sessions each lasted approximately one hour, and the individual interviews each lasted approximately 30 minutes. All sessions were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and proofread before analysis. The interview guides for both participant groups were created specifically for this study (see Appendix) and did not include questions from previous guides or semi-structured interviews. The FGD guide for the patient group covered three domains. The first domain assessed the pain experience. It asked patients to provide specific terms they commonly use to describe their pain, identify other factors they believe are associated with their CP, describe any attempts to systematically track their pain, and explain how NF1-associated CP interfered with their daily lives. The second domain explored how CP could impact other aspects of patients’ lives, such as emotional responses to pain and coping strategies. The final domain gathered patients’ opinions on the usefulness of current pain measures and which elements of pain were most important to monitor. The provider interview guide included four domains, with the first three aligned with those of the FGD guide. The first domain focused on providers’ perspectives regarding their patients’ experiences of pain. The second domain asked providers how they believed pain was related to other aspects of their patients’ lives. The third domain sought opinions on current pain measures, the adequacy of pain terminology, and how patients track their pain. The fourth domain asked providers whether NF1-associated CP has unique characteristics and the importance of assessing other non-pain signs or symptoms as part of NF1 pain management. At the conclusion of each FGD or individual interview, participants were reminded about confidentiality and the overall goal of the study, thanked for their time, and sent Amazon gift cards ($25 US for the patient group and $50 US for the provider group). Data analysis The data analysis team (FB, KL, LG) met regularly to create the codebook and identify potential emergent themes. All team members were experienced qualitative researchers. Interview sessions and data analysis occurred simultaneously and iteratively until the team concluded that data saturation had been achieved (that is, no new information emerged in subsequent interviews) [ 22 - 24 ]. Starting with an initial set of codes based on the domains in the Interview Guide, the coding team independently coded all transcripts and then reviewed them collectively. The codes were developed inductively, reviewed iteratively, and revised based on team discussions of additional transcripts. Any discrepancies in coding were discussed and resolved through consensus. The coded transcripts were entered into ATLAS.ti (Version 9; Kansas City, MO). Using thematic analysis [ 25 , 26 ], the team examined patterns across the full data set to develop a final, concise set of themes. The analysis also considered any negative instances in which data did not align with the themes or where responses to specific questions were absent. Descriptive statistics were calculated to summarize the study sample.",Lauretta Grau; William A Zempsky; Staci Martin; Kaitlyn Larkin; Frank D Buono,Cureus,2025-12,10.7759/cureus.100193,minimal,True
PMID:25003081,An integrative analysis of meningioma tumors reveals the determinant genes and pathways of malignant transformation.,"Meningiomas are frequent central nervous system neoplasms, which despite their predominant benignity, show sporadically malignant behavior. Type 2 neurofibromatosis and polymorphisms in several genes have been associated with meningioma risk and are probably involved in its pathogenesis. Although GWAS studies have found loci related to meningioma risk, little is known about the factors determining malignant transformation. Thus, this study is aimed to identify the genomic and transcriptomic factors influencing evolution from benignity toward aggressive phenotypes. By applying an integrative bioinformatics pipeline combining public information on a wealth of biological layers of complexity (from genetic polymorphisms to protein interactions), this study identified a module of co-expressed genes highly correlated with tumor stage and statistically linked to several genomic regions (module Quantitative Trait Loci, mQTLs). Ontology analysis of the transcription hub genes identified microtubule-associated cell-cycle processes as key drivers of such network. mQTLs and single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with meningioma stage were replicated in an alternative meningioma cohort, and integration of these results with up-to-date scientific literature and several databases retrieved a list of genes and pathways with a potentially important role in meningioma malignancy. As a result, cytoskeleton and cell-cell adhesion pathways, calcium-channels and glutamate receptors, as well as oxidoreductase and endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathways were found to be the most important and redundant findings associated to meningioma progression. This study presents an integrated view of the pathways involved in meningioma malignant conversion and paves the way for the development of new research lines that will improve our understanding of meningioma biology.","Materials and Methods The core of the study is based on the integration of genomic marker information (i.e., SNPs) with gene-expression data on a group of meningioma tumors, published by Nelson et al. ( 16 ), in the search for genomic loci influencing malignant-like gene expression. In the first part,  Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis, WGCNA  ( 15 ,  17 ) was applied to explore gene expression as an undirected co-expression network and reduce its dimensionality. A co-expression module deeply correlated with meningioma biological parameters was discovered, and the top hub genes inside the module were identified based on network analysis parameters. In a second step, genetic loci associated to the meningioma-related co-expression network were identified, in an approach known as  module Quantitative Trait Loci  [mQTLs ( 18 )]. These loci were found to partially overlap with SNP association with disease stage. In the third step, the most likely causative genes in the proximity of the mQTLs were delimited, which formed the input list for their integration with PPI networks, TFBS data, miRNA signatures, and pathways databases. Multivariate regression models were created in order to determine what extent of the variability in WHO meningioma Grade could be explained by mQTL SNPs and co-expression module data. With the help of literature filtering, a list of genes with a high potential role in meningioma malignant conversion is provided for future experimental testing. A study pipeline scheme can be consulted in Figure  1 . Figure 1 Pipeline scheme representing all the steps followed in this research . Initial data source The initial data input for this study was of a group of 85 meningioma samples [GEO accession   ( GSE16584 16 )]. Meningioma samples (22 males and 37 females) with both genotypic and gene-expression data were selected. This resulted in a total number of 59 samples, of which 39 were WHO Grade I meningioma cases, 15 were WHO Grade II, and 5 were WHO Grade III (Table  S1  in Supplementary Material). Tumor genotyping was performed with the  Human Mapping 100K Set  platform ( Affymetrix ) and gene-expression data were obtained using  GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays  ( Affymetrix ). Genotyping  Hind  and  Xba CEL  files were downloaded from GEO [ Gene-Expression Omnibus  ( 19 ,  20 )]; accession code   ( GSE16583 16 ) and analyzed the  Affymetrix Genotyping Console  software ( Affymetrix ). Only samples with a quality control ≥90% were included. After pre-processing all the data results, we selected 111,829 SNPs, which passed three filters: minimum allele frequency of 5%, minimum call rate of 95%, and evidence of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium ( P -value ≥0.01). Gene-expression analysis Expression  CEL  files were also downloaded from  GEO  (GEO accession code  ) and analyzed in  GSE16581 R  ( 21 ). Samples were read, background corrected, normalized, probe-specific background corrected, and summarized into an  R eset  class object using functions of the  affy  package ( 22 ). Array quality was determined with the  arrayQualityMetrics  package ( 23 ). In order to simplify the analysis, we applied a filter to select only those roughly 12,000 probes, which showed at least a 1.8-fold expression change according to the median in at least 10% of the samples ( 24 ). In order to find  expression quantitative trait loci  (eQTLs), and since no Y chromosome SNPs were measured in the chips, we also excluded gene-expression probes pertaining to such location. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis functions were applied to expression data according to several online tutorials ( 18 ). The adjacency matrix was calculated using a soft-thresholding power of 6, which showed an approximate scale-free topology ( R 2  = 0.75). Briefly, the connectivity value of each selected transcript (calculated similarly to kIN in Section “Regression Models”) was used to create a group of 10 bins with equal size, and each connectivity value was assigned to each bin. The connectivity distribution  k  was defined as the average connectivity value for each bin, whilst the probability distribution of  k p ( k ) was defined as the ratio of the number of connectivity values in each bin by the number of connectivity values studied. Under the approximate scale-free topology assumption, the logarithm of  p ( k ) ( log(p(k)) ) and the logarithm of  k  ( log(k) ) are strongly negatively correlated. In this case, by using a soft-thresholding power of 6 we obtained a  R 2  = 0.75 (Pearson’s correlation of 0.86, regression slope of −1.46), whilst using no thresholding at all we obtained  R 2  = 0.03 (Pearson’s correlation of 0.17, regression slope of 1.05). Thus, the soft-thresholding value selected ensures approximated scale-free topology whilst retaining a higher number of informative connections in the network. Several co-expression modules were determined, and correlation between phenotypic data and their respective first principal components (a.k.a.  module eigengenes , ME) was calculated. Mean gene significance with WHO Grade was calculated as the absolute average correlation of all module genes with this trait. Due to its marked positive correlation with several parameters (refer to Figure  5 ), the pink-module was chosen for further analysis.  Module membership  (MM,  a.k.a kME ) was defined as the Spearman’s correlation between the ME and the genes corresponding to the pink-module, which is considered a measure of centrality of each gene in the network. Gene-expression standard deviation was determined with the function  rowSds , part of the package  matrixStats  ( 25 ). Gene co-expression network visualization and pathway analysis Cytoscape  ( 26 ) was used to create a graphic representation of the pink-module. Using the  CentiScape  plug-in ( 27 ), we analyzed several network parameters, such as  degree  and  betweenness centrality . Hub genes were chosen as those with a degree higher or equal to 250 and a betweenness centrality value higher or equal to 2,500. The  ClueGO  plug-in ( 28 ) was utilized to create pathway and Gene Ontology ( 29 ) enrichment networks. Gene ontology databases for  Biological Processes, Cellular Components, Immune System Processes , and  Molecular Functions , as well as  KEGG  ( 30 ,  31 ) and  Reactome  ( 32 ), were included in the analysis. Enrichment analysis was performed with the hypergeometric test, and a significant FDR-adjusted  P -value threshold of 0.001 was selected.  ClueGO  gene ontology and pathway terms were filtered, so that only those matching to at least 10% of the genes in the pink-module were considered. Gene ontology analysis for hub genes was performed with  DAVID  web tool ( 33 ,  34 ). mQTL finding, annotation, and downstream functional analysis The degree of association between the the pink’s module ME and the genotypes was performed by fitting a logistic regression with SNPs as dependent phenotypes with the function  spn.lhs.tests  implemented in the package snpStats ( 35 ). Since the ME does not reflect all the variability of the whole module, the sum of the first and second principal components ( PC1 + PC2 ) was also studied in a similar way. Finally, we also tested for significant improvements over the base model of the ME by separately adding PC2 and PC1 + PC2. SNPs with a  P -value in the order of 10 −5  or less were selected as mQTLs, and in case that various SNPs mapped to the same gene only the most significant was chosen. mQTL putative genes were obtained from the HaploReg v2 web browser ( 36 ). mQTL enrichment in  TFBS  was studied using  oPPOSUM Single Site Analysis  tool ( 37 ). Briefly, the analysis was run with the following parameters: (1) Vertebrate JASPAR CORE profiles were selected, (2) only the top 10% conserved regions (with a minimum conservation of 70%) between the mouse and the human genome were included with (3) a position weight matrix match threshold of 80% and (4) within a region of 5,000 bp up and downstream of the transcription start site for each gene. Gene Ontology and Pathways analysis for mQTL putative genes was performed with Cytoscape and ClueGo similarly to Section “Gene Co-Expression Network Visualization and Pathway Analysis.” In this case, a threshold of 3% was set to the proportion matching genes in the ontology group. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used for miRNA target site enrichment ( 38 ). The PPI database STRING ( 39 ) was used to test for known interactions among the proteins encoded by the mQTL genes. To address the possible influence of genes in the pink co-expression module over mQTLs, a search for mQTL putative genes matching to in-module genes was conducted. Finally, the PubMed database was interrogated for known associations between mQTL putative genes and cancer or meningioma (search terms: “ Gene Name AND Cancer ” and “ Gene Name AND Meningioma ”, date: 28/4/2014). Gene expression and genotypic replication cohorts An expression replication cohort was constructed with data from GEO [GEO accession codes   ( GSE43290 40 ) and   ( GSE4780 41 )]. Matching samples in both datasets were selected, and batches were removed with the  ComBat  function implemented in the package  sva  ( 42 ), getting an overall cohort of 22,283 probes and 103 individuals. Linear models of the  limma  package ( 43 ) were applied to determine differential gene expression between tumor stages and to detect matches with pink-module genes. Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test was applied to determine possible connectivity differences among those probes found to be overexpressed in the replication cohort compared to its background. Background connectivity was determined as 10,000 times random permutation of kME values for pink-module probes present in the replication cohort. At the same time, a genotypic cohort of 50 meningioma samples was downloaded from GEO [GEO accession code   ( GSE42624 44 )], which was used to find overlapping disease progression-associated SNPs/genes in both datasets, as well as to detect matches with mQTLs. Gene overlaps between the two genotypic cohorts and mQTLs were computed by including putative gene symbol matches for SNPs at a linkage disequilibrium value at least of 0.8 in individuals of European Ancestry included in the  1000 Genomes Project , according to the  HaploReg  web tool ( 36 ). Finally, literature analysis was performed for duplicate findings (e.g., SNPs related to the same putative gene in at least two of the three lists: stringent mQTL list and any of the two SNP association lists) as described for mQTLs above. Regression models Multivariate regression models with genotypic and transcriptomic data were regressed on phenotypic information. A vector was created containing the Spearman’s correlation of the WHO Meningioma Grade distribution with each module probe, hereafter called  Gene Significance for WHO Meningioma Grade  ( GS WHO_Grade ). A analogous vector containing the Spearman’s correlation of each module probe with each mQTL, was designated GSmQTL. Intramodular connectivity (kIN) was defined as the sum of the absolute value of the Spearman’s correlation of each probe with all the other probes in the same module. Another measure of connectivity, known as kME or MM, was calculated as previously defined in Section “Gene-Expression Analysis.” Regression analysis was performed with the  lm  function, implemented in the package  stats  ( 21 ). A stepwise selection of models based on Akaike information criterion (AIC) was conducted. Significant variables were selected for further analysis if their  P -value in the best AIC model was in the order of 10 −3  or below, according to a  T  test. Rank transformation into normality function [ rntransform , package  GenABEL  ( 45 )] was applied to the dependent variables of the models. Normality of the dependent variables and the residuals was assessed with the function  shapiro.te st (package  stats ). Variance inflation factors (VIFs) for lineal models were calculated with the  VIF  function implemented in the package  fmsb  ( 46 ). Miscellaneous Boxplots present in Figure  3 C, Figures  S1 A and  S2 E in Supplementary Material were created with the “ boxplot ” function implemented in the  graphics  package ( 21 ), and they represent the upper and lower quartiles (upper and lower of the boxes), the median (horizontal line inside the boxes), as well as the most extreme values in the dataset (the whiskers and the points outside it). Note that the whiskers include dispersed data that fall within 1.5 times the height of the box, and points represent values lying outside this range. Expression missing values were imputed with functions of the package  impute  ( 47 ).",José Carlos Iglesias Gómez; Adrián Mosquera Orgueira,Frontiers in oncology,2014,10.3389/fonc.2014.00147,minimal,True
PMID:18483311,Effective in vivo targeting of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are chemoresistant sarcomas with poor 5-year survival that arise in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or sporadically. We tested three drugs for single and combinatorial effects on collected MPNST cell lines and in MPNST xenografts. The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 inhibitor RAD001 (Everolimus) decreased growth 19% to 60% after 4 days of treatment in NF1 and sporadic-derived MPNST cell lines. Treatment of subcutaneous sporadic MPNST cell xenografts with RAD001 significantly, but transiently, delayed tumor growth, and decreased vessel permeability within xenografts. RAD001 combined with the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib caused additional inhibitory effects on growth and apoptosis in vitro, and a small but significant additional inhibitory effect on MPNST growth in vivo that were larger than the effects of RAD001 with doxorubicin. RAD001 plus erlotinib, in vitro and in vivo, reduced phosphorylation of AKT and total AKT levels, possibly accounting for their additive effect. The results support the consideration of RAD001 therapy in NF1 patient and sporadic MPNST. The preclinical tests described allow rapid screening strata for drugs that block MPNST growth, prior to tests in more complex models, and should be useful to identify drugs that synergize with RAD001.","Materials and Methods Cell Lines and Reagents MPNST cell lines STS26T, ST8814, ST88-3 S462, T265p21, S520, 90–8, and YST1 and normal human Schwann cells were obtained and maintained as described ( 6 ,  10 ). All cell lines were from NF1 patients except YST-1 and STS26T. Total S6K1 antibody was used as previously described ( 33 ). Antibodies against phospho-AKT (S473), total AKT, and monoclonal rabbit anti-phospho-S6K (T389) were from Cell Signaling Technology. RAD001 and the corresponding placebo compound were provided by Novartis. Erlotinib (OSI 774, Tarceva) was provided by OSI Pharmaceuticals and diluted in DMSO at a concentration of 10 µmol/L. Doxorubicin was obtained from Sigma and diluted in PBS to a stock concentration of 2 mg/mL. Cell Proliferation MPNST cell lines STS26T, ST8814, ST88-3 S462, and T265p21 were plated on 96-well plates at a concentration of 1,000 cells per well in serum-containing growth medium ( 6 ,  10 ). Cells were treated with carrier alone (0.1% DMSO or 0.05% ethanol), RAD001 (Novartis pharmaceuticals), erlotinib (OSI Pharmaceuticals), or doxorubicin (Sigma). After the designated times, the amount of proliferation was quantified by a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxy-methoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2 H -tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS) assay using Cell titer 96 proliferation kit (Promega), and absorbance at 490 nm was read in a Spectramax M2 plate reader (Molecular Devices). Each experiment was done in quadruplicate and repeated thrice. Cell Death STS26T or ST8814 (5,000 cells per well) were plated on to LabTech II plates (Fisher Scientific) in serum-containing growth medium ( 6 ,  10 ). Cells were treated with either 10 nmol/L RAD001 or carrier alone (0.05% ethanol) for 24 h followed by the addition of 0.05, 0.5, or 5 µg/mL doxorubicin for 48 h, or with 10 nmol/L RAD001 in combination with 3 µmol/L erlotinib for 3 d. Apoptosis was detected using DeadEnd fluorometric terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase-mediated nick-end labeling (TUNEL) system (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and counterstained with 1 µg/mL 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen). The number of apoptotic nuclei was counted and compared with total number of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-positive nucleus using a fluorescent microscope. Experiments were repeated with duplicates for each condition in each experiment. In each case, a minimum of 500 cells was counted. Protein Isolation and Western Blotting Protein extracts were prepared as previously described ( 34 ) from MPNST cell lines ST8814, STS26T, and S462 growing in log phase in serum-containing growth medium ( 6 ,  10 ). Protein concentration was determined using the bovine serum albumin method (Bio-Rad). Samples were denatured in 6 × SDS sample buffer [10% SDS, 30% glycerol, 0.6 mol/L DTT 0.012% bromphenol blue, 0.5 mol/L Tris-HCl (pH 6.8)] and 20 to 50 µg of protein were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Protein levels were detected using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:10,000 Bio-Rad) followed by an enhanced chemilu-minescence plus detection kit (Amersham). Xenograft Model Animal studies were approved by the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Early Treatment Athymic nu/nu mice were anesthetized in isoflurane and injected s.c. with 10 6  STS26T cells in the left flank ( 35 ). Mice were treated with daily gavage between 3 to 21 d post-injection. Each group consisted of eight mice, and treatment consisted of placebo (obtained as a control microemulsion for RAD001 from Novartis), RAD001 (10 mg/kg; ref.  36 ), erlotinib (25 mg/kg; ref.  37 ), or RAD001 (10 mg/kg) + erlotinib (25 mg/kg) diluted in 10% DMSO in 0.5% w/v carboxyl methylcellulose (Sigma). Late Treatment To study the drug effects on established tumors, mice were treated with daily gavage starting when the average tumor size had reached 150 mm 3  (16 d postinjection). Mice were given a one-time i.p. injection of 8 mg/kg doxorubicin, diluted as a 1 mg/mL solution in PBS, or PBS alone ( 38 ). The erlotinib was supplied in 6% captisol, whereas the RAD001 and the placebo compound was supplied in a microemulsion solvent. RAD001 or the placebo compound were diluted in 3 parts 2% carboxyl methylcellulose and 2 parts 6% captisol (with or without erlotinib). Tumors were measured every 3rd day. Tumor volume was calculated according to the following formula:  L  ×  W 
 2  (π/6), where  L  is the longest diameter and  W  is the width. In accordance with our animal protocol, mice were sacrificed when tumor size reached 10% body weight (~3,000 mm 3 ; ref.  35 ). Tumors were dissected and either flash frozen and stored at −80°C or fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin sections were treated with hydrogen peroxidase in methanol for 10 min at room temperature followed by 0.1% trypsin (Life Technologies) for antigen retrieval. Sections were incubated with rat anti-CD31 antibodies (BD bioscience) at 1:40 dilution for 60 min at room temperature, washed, and treated with rabbit anti-rat secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories) for 30 min. For Mib1 detection, paraffin sections were treated with TRS or antigen retrieval followed by a prediluted Mib1 antibody (DAKO). In vivo  Imaging System Mice were injected s.c. with a stably transfected DS-red STS26T cell line ( 39 ) Mice were treated as described above starting when tumors reached 150 mm 3 . Mice received a total of five treatments of either 10 mg/kg RAD001 ( n  = 7) or placebo ( n  = 6) after which they received a tail vein injection of 5 mg FITC-dextran, MW 2,000,000 (Sigma) diluted in PBS, 4 h after the last treatment. Levels of FITC-dextran were analyzed after 2 h using an  in vivo  imaging system (IVIS200X, Xenogen). Statistical Analysis We conducted linear mixed effects model analysis via SAS procedure Proc Mixed (version 9.1, SAS Institute).  In vitro  data were analyzed by a model with random cell lines and cell line by treatment effects to account for the variability due to, respectively, the random selection of cell line samples that we tested (out of all theoretically positive MPNST cell lines) and the difference in treatment between the different cell lines. This analysis gives an idea of how likely the  in vitro  study results would be repeated in an independent experiment with five different MPNST cell lines, which cannot be done by ANOVA or general linear models analysis.  In vivo  data were analyzed by a model that assumed an autocorrelative dependency among the measurements taken on the same mouse over time. The response variable of tumor growth measurements was log transformed to meet the normality assumption of the model and to stabilize the variance. The linear mixed effects model analysis permits a more precise analysis by better specifying the nature of the dependency among the longitudinal measurements. In each case, the assumptions and the goodness of the fit of the model were checked graphically, for example, via the residual plots. No evidence was found to suspect the model fit.",Gunnar Johansson; Yonatan Y Mahller; Margaret H Collins; Mi-Ok Kim; Takahiro Nobukuni; John Perentesis; Timothy P Cripe; Heidi A Lane; Sara C Kozma; George Thomas; Nancy Ratner,Molecular cancer therapeutics,2008-05,10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-07-2335,minimal,True
PMID:31558455,Understanding autism spectrum disorder and social functioning in children with neurofibromatosis type 1: protocol for a cross-sectional multimodal study.,"INTRODUCTION: Children with the single-gene disorder neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) appear to be at an increased risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and exhibit a unique social-cognitive phenotype compared with children with idiopathic ASD. A complete framework is required to better understand autism in NF1, from neurobiological levels through to behavioural and functional outcomes. The primary aims of this study are to establish the frequency of ASD in children with NF1, examine the social cognitive phenotype, investigate the neuropsychological processes contributing to ASD symptoms and poor social functioning in children with NF1, and to investigate novel structural and functional neurobiological markers of ASD and social dysfunction in NF1. The secondary aim of this study is to compare the neuropsychological and neurobiological features of ASD in children with NF1 to a matched group of patients with idiopathic ASD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is an international, multisite, prospective, cross-sectional cohort study of children with NF1, idiopathic ASD and typically developing (TD) controls. Participants will be 200 children with NF1 (3-15 years of age), 70 TD participants (3-15 years) and 35 children with idiopathic ASD (7-15 years). Idiopathic ASD and NF1 cases will be matched on age, sex and intelligence. All participants will complete cognitive testing and parents will rate their child's behaviour on standardised questionnaires. Neuroimaging will be completed by a subset of participants aged 7 years and older. Children with NF1 that screen at risk for ASD on the parent-rated Social Responsiveness Scale 2nd Edition will be invited back to complete the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale 2nd Edition and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised to determine whether they fulfil ASD diagnostic criteria. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has hospital ethics approval and the results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and international conferences.","Methods and analysis This is an international, multisite, prospective, cross-sectional cohort study of children with NF1, idiopathic ASD and typically developing (TD) controls. Participants will be 200 children with NF1 (3–15 years of age), 70 TD participants (3–15 years) and 35 children with idiopathic ASD (7–15 years). Idiopathic ASD and NF1 cases will be matched on age, sex and intelligence. All participants will complete cognitive testing and parents will rate their child’s behaviour on standardised questionnaires. Neuroimaging will be completed by a subset of participants aged 7 years and older. Children with NF1 that screen at risk for ASD on the parent-rated Social Responsiveness Scale 2nd Edition will be invited back to complete the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale 2nd Edition and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised to determine whether they fulfil ASD diagnostic criteria. Methods and analysis Study design This is an international, multisite, prospective, cross-sectional cohort study of children with NF1, idiopathic ASD and typically developing (TD) controls. Participants will complete a detailed assessment of their cognitive abilities, behaviour and adaptive functioning. As part of this assessment, participants will be screened for ASD symptoms. All idiopathic ASD participants, as well as NF1 participants that screen  at risk  for ASD (see Procedure section for further details), will complete a comprehensive assessment that will be used to guide the formulation of research and clinical ASD diagnoses (see ASD assessment measures section for further details). Children aged ≥7 years will also be invited to undergo multimodal MRI (Australian sites only). An overview of the study design for each group is provided in  figure 1 . Figure 1 Diagram of study design for all groups. ASD, autism spectrum disorder; NF1, neurofibromatosis type 1; TD, typically developing. Participants and recruitment Three groups will be recruited; children with NF1 (n=200; 3–15 years of age), children with idiopathic ASD (n=35; 7–15 years of age) and TD controls from the general population (n=70; 3–15 years of age). Prospective participants with NF1 will be recruited from three international genetic centres; (1) the Neurofibromatosis Clinic at the Royal Children’s Hospital/Murdoch Children’s Research Institute (MCRI), Melbourne, Australia; (2) the Neurogenetics Clinic at The Children’s Hospital at Westmead (CHW), Sydney, Australia; and (3) the Gilbert Neurofibromatosis Institute at the Children’s National Health System, Washington DC, USA. Children are referred to these clinics by general practitioners and medical specialists for evaluation, diagnosis and management of NF1. All three clinics are specialist centres for the multidisciplinary care of individuals with NF1, are well resourced for the collection of cognitive and behavioural research data, and service clinical populations thought to be representative of the wider NF1 community. NF1 participants will be diagnosed with NF1 by an expert neurologist or clinical geneticist based on criteria specified by the National Institutes of Health Conference Statement. 36  The study coordinator at each site will recruit NF1 participants. The coordinator will approach families attending the clinic and inquire about interest in the study. To minimise selection bias, the study coordinator will sequentially approach families with a child in the defined age range. Participants with idiopathic ASD will be recruited at the MCRI site from local clinical services and from families known to existing studies who have previously indicated a willingness to be contacted for future research. All idiopathic ASD participants will have received an ASD diagnosis by a clinician prior to enrolment and have no known genetic disorders associated with ASD. They will be matched to NF1 participants with a comorbid diagnosis of ASD on age, sex and intelligence. Given that ~94% of children with NF1 present with an intelligence quotient (IQ)>70, 37  the majority of recruited children with idiopathic ASD will not have evidence of an intellectual disability based on records of intellectual function to provide a suitable match. Control participants will be recruited via several methods. First, we will invite individuals that have participated as TD controls in previous research studies and provided consent to be recontacted for future studies. Contact will initially take the form of a mail out of the Parent Information and Consent Form and a cover letter inviting them to contact the site study coordinator if they would like to participate. A follow-up phone call will be made 2 weeks later to ascertain interest in participating. Second, approved advertisements will be placed on hospital noticeboards inviting interested participants to contact the site investigator for more information about the study. Exclusion criteria for all participants are Participant and at least one parent/guardian not fluent in English. Significant sensory impairment that limits the validity of psychometric testing. Symptomatic intracranial pathology that may impact cognitive and behavioural function, such as an acquired brain injury, hydrocephalus or progressive intracranial tumours (children with asymptomatic lesions such as optic gliomas will be eligible). Additional exclusion criteria that applies to TD control participants only Positive history of a neurological, genetic or psychological disorder. Developmental delay/intellectual disability. The first participant was recruited to this study in June 2016 and we anticipate the end date for enrolment to be December 2020. Procedure Once informed consent has been obtained, parents/caregivers will complete a semistructured interview with a member of the study team in order to determine eligibility, confirm demographic details (date of birth, language spoken at home, school grade), provide socioeconomic information (primary caregiver’s highest level of education, occupation and employment status), and a detailed developmental/medical history will also be taken. Eligible children will then undergo cognitive assessment individually with a site psychologist in a quiet room. Study personnel will follow a test administration protocol to minimise between-site variation. Children exhibiting fatigue during the assessment will complete the testing over multiple days. Parents/caregivers will complete detailed questionnaires covering a range of behavioural and functional outcomes, including the SRS-2. NF1 participants that screen at risk for ASD on the basis of their SRS-2 results (total symptom T-score ≥60) will be invited to complete the diagnostic ASD assessment. Idiopathic ASD participants will also complete the ASD assessment so that a comprehensive understanding of their behavioural profile can be obtained. These will be audiotaped and videotaped respectively, so that independent blinded double interrater coding can be completed in 25% of the sample. Children aged ≥7 years who are able to complete a brain MRI safely will be offered the option to undergo neuroimaging. Neuroimaging will only take place at Australian sites. Measures Cognitive and behavioural measures Cognitive domains selected for assessment are based on a biopsychosocial model for social functioning that integrates abilities thought to underlie the development and expression of social behaviour, including attention/executive function, communication and social cognitive skills. 24  To ensure appropriate age-normed tests are administered, participants will be grouped into a younger cohort of children aged 3–5 years, and a school-aged cohort of children aged 6–15 years. Child-direct assessment measures for each cohort are presented in  table 1 . Parent-reported measures are outlined in  table 2 .

ASD assessment measures The ADI-R 38  is a semistructured, standardised diagnostic interview designed to assess core aspects of ASD. The ADI-R is administered to a parent/caregiver by a trained clinician and consists of 95 items covering current and previous behaviour across the areas of family background, developmental history, language, communication, social development, interests and general behaviour. Items are coded according to the examiner’s judgement of the presence/absence or the extent of a given behaviour using a scale ranging from 0 (behaviour not present) to 3 (definite abnormality, marked in severity). An algorithm is used to code summary scores for the three domains required for diagnosis: social interaction, communication and restricted and repetitive behaviours. Diagnostic criteria for ASD are met when all three domain scores exceed the following cut-offs: social interaction domain ≥10; communication ≥8; and restricted interests and repetitive behaviours ≥3. The ADI-R is effective in differentiating groups of children with and without ASD, and discriminating autism symptomology. 38 
 The ADOS-2 39  is a semi-structured, standardised child-direct observational assessment designed to assess reciprocal social interaction and communication, play and use of imagination. It consists of four modules, of which one will be administered depending on the participant’s developmental age and expressive language ability: (1) preverbal/have single word language; (2) phrase speech abilities; (3) verbally fluent children/adolescents; and (4) verbally fluent adolescents/adults. Each module takes ~30 min to complete by a trained examiner. For each module, individual items are scored on a three point scale ranging from 0 (no evident abnormality) to 3 (marked abnormality). Module observations are scored according to the ADOS-2 diagnostic algorithm under two domains; social affect and restricted and repetitive behaviours. A combined domain total of ≥7 is classified as meeting diagnostic criteria for ASD, consistent with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). 39 
 If the results of the ADI-R and ADOS-2 are not in agreement regarding ASD classification, we will employ the research criteria proposed by Risi and colleagues to resolve ADI-R and ADOS-2 discordance. 40  Use of these criteria relax the original ADI-R criteria that were developed to detect the formerly defined Autistic Disorder, 38  to encompass the broader category of ASD outlined in the DSM-5. A research diagnosis of ASD is thus assigned to a participant if he/she meets criteria on the ADOS-2 (either autism or autism spectrum) and meets one of the following criteria on the ADI-R: Meets ASD cut-off for the social reciprocity domain and either communication or restricted interests and repetitive behaviours domains. Comes within one point for both social reciprocity and communication domains. Meets ASD cut-off on one domain (either social reciprocity or communication) and comes within two points of the cut-off on the other domain (either social reciprocity or communication). In addition to a research classification, a multidisciplinary expert panel will establish a clinical consensus diagnosis for all participants with NF1 who have completed the ASD assessment. This consensus diagnosis will be made according to DSM-5 guidelines, using all available diagnostic information. Neuroimaging procedure Mock training At the MCRI site, children will complete a 30 min training session in a mock MRI scanner which reproduces the physical environment of the real scanner including noise effects. This familiarises participants to the MRI environment, aims to lowers anxiety and provides practice at keeping still during the scanning session. 41  Children who find the training sessions distressing and wish to withdraw from the neuroimaging component may do so at any time without affecting their ability to participate in the cognitive and behavioural assessment. MRI scan Neuroimaging data will be obtained on a 3-Tesla Siemens MAGNETOM Prisma MRI scanner with a 64-channel head coil at both MCRI and CHW sites. The magnetic resonance spectroscopy sequences, which will only be conducted at MCRI, will use a 32-channel head coil. The neuroimaging protocol comprises structural and functional sequences which will be completed in two 45 min sessions with a 30 min break in between (MCRI site) or in one 45 min session (CHW site). See  table 3  for sequence details.

Structural neuroimaging Three dimensional high-resolution structural T1-weighted magnetisation-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) images will be acquired to provide whole brain and regional grey and white matter (WM) volume, cortical thickness and other morphological features, as outlined in  table 3 . Children exhibiting high levels of movement during the MPRAGE sequence, will complete a second T1-weighted multiecho magnetisation-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence, which uses navigator-based prospective motion correction to reduce artefact and improve structural image contrast, providing more accurate tissue segmentation. 41–43 
 A T2-SPACE (Sampling Perfection with Application optimised Contrast with flip angle Evolution) protocol will be acquired to obtain T2-weighted anatomical images and provide information about the number and location of focal areas of WM hyperintensity that are common in NF1 ( table 3 ). 33 44–46  The relationship between focal areas of high intensity and cognitive and behavioural deficits remains unclear. 33 47 
 Multiband, multishell diffusion neuroimaging A multiband accelerated echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequences protocol, developed by the Centre for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR, University of Minnesota), will be acquired in order to obtain diffusion-weighted images (DWI) and examine brain microstructure through the identification of WM fibre tracts and their directionality. DWI measures the direction and extent of water diffusion through brain tissue, which is dependent on the underlying tissue structure, permitting examination of differences in cellular structure. 48 49  Diffusion parameters indicate changes in axonal properties. 48 49  The multiband accelerated EPI protocol uses multiple shell acquisition to accelerate DWI volume coverage, and involves anterior–posterior phase encoding direction as well as standard and reverse phase encoded blipped image acquisition to correct for magnetic susceptibility-induced distortions related to the EPI acquisitions. 41 50 51  Three diffusion weighted shells will be acquired ( table 3 ) to perform tractography and estimate WM microstructure, including traditional tensor metrics (fractional anisotropy, and mean, radial and axial diffusivity), as well as more advanced techniques that provide greater specificity to the microstructural properties, such as fibre density. Multiband resting state functional neuroimaging Resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) will be used to measure intrinsic functional connectivity between brain regions while subjects are at rest. During the sequence, participants are instructed to look at a white fixation cross on a black screen ( table 3 ). Resting state connectivity is useful for studying abnormal neural network connectivity in NF1, and its relationship with cognitive and behavioural deficits. 52 
 Magnetic resonance spectroscopy Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is an in vivo tool capable of non-invasively measuring brain metabolites. Only the MCRI site will acquire two GABA-edited magnetic resonance spectra using the localised spectroscopy sequence MEGA-PRESS, developed by CMRR, to evaluate the animal model-derived hypothesis that alterations in GABA and glutamate systems underlie cognitive and social impairments in NF1. 53–55  MEGA-PRESS allows separation of GABA signals from stronger overlying signals of other metabolites. 56  Voxels will be positioned in regions with consistency of field homogeneity within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ), both of which are integral regions within the social brain network. 57 58  The PFC voxel will be placed across the midline of the precentral sulcus, crossing across both hemispheres, in the medial PFC. The rTPJ voxel will be placed towards the rear border of the temporal and parietal lobes, in the posterior cerebral cortex. T1-weighted images will be used to guide MRS voxel placement. Data analysis Descriptive statistics will be used to establish the frequency of ASD in children with NF1. Between-group differences on general and social cognitive measures will be examined using analysis of variance, controlling for type 1 error. If particular demographic variables differ between groups (eg, age, sex, socioeconomic status) and are related to the outcome of interest, they will be introduced as a covariate using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Within-group analysis for NF1 participants will identify the neuropsychological processes contributing to ASD symptoms and poor social functioning using (linear or logistic as appropriate) regressions within each age cohort. Composite variables will be created for variables that have high collinearity within the same domain. Regression models will be conducted separately for ASD symptomatology and social functioning as dependent variables. Only explanatory variables that significantly correlate with the dependent variables will be entered into each regression model, with a maximum of five predictor variables per model. Variables with the strongest correlation will be selected for the regression model. Correlation and regression analyses will be used to identify associations between structural and functional brain markers, with cognitive, behavioural and ASD outcomes. To address the secondary aim, which is to compare the neuropsychological profiles as well as brain structure and function of children with NF1 and comorbid ASD to idiopathic ASD, statistical analyses examining group differences (ANCOVA and independent t - tests) between the idiopathic ASD and a subgroup of participants with NF1 and comorbid ASD will be conducted. Idiopathic ASD and NF1 cases will be matched on age, sex and intelligence. Sample size Cognitive and behavioural outcomes We anticipate NF1 versus TD control between-group effect sizes to range from 0.65 to 1.0 (Cohen’s d) based on estimates of general and social cognitive outcomes in previous studies. 9 11 15  In order to detect a d=0.65 difference between the NF1 and TD control groups on continuous outcomes, with a minimum of 85% power and a significance level of 0.05, we need to recruit at least 35 children per group in each age cohort (eg, younger children aged 3–5 years, and a school-aged cohort aged 6–15 years). Within-group analyses performed within the NF1 group will require a larger sample to attain adequate power. For a multiple regression, with five independent variables in the model, accounting for an effect size (f 2 ) of 0.2, power will be sufficiently high (β=0.8) with a sample size of 70. We thus require a minimum of 70 participants with NF1 in each age cohort. However, in order to attain a large enough NF1 with comorbid ASD subgroup (n=35) for comparisons with TD control and idiopathic ASD groups, we estimate ~200 children with NF1 will need to be enrolled in the study. This assumes that 17%–18% of children with NF1 screened as part of the study will be diagnosed with comorbid ASD, which is consistent with previous estimations. 17–19  If the target of 35 is not met, then we will endeavour to recruit extra NF1 participants until a subgroup size of 35 is achieved. Neuroimaging outcomes Published data demonstrate large effect sizes when comparing DWI and fMRI measures in individuals with NF1 to TD controls. 59–61  Between-group independent t - tests will be adequately powered (β=0.80) to detect medium-to-large effect sizes (Cohen’s d=0.68) with a minimum sample of n=35 per group. For the correlational analyses of DWI, rs-fMRI and behavioural data within the NF1 sample, power will be sufficiently high (β=0.8) to detect moderate association (r≥0.4) with a NF1 sample of 45. 62 
 Secondary outcomes We will recruit 35 idiopathic ASD participants. Sample size is based on (1) ANCOVA power analyses described above which indicate a sample size of 35 per group is sufficient to determine group differences on social cognitive measures; and (2) a previously published neuroimaging study involving 10 idiopathic ASD and 22 control participants which reported significant group differences in brain structure using structural MRI techniques. 62

PMID:2491779,A refined genetic map of the region of chromosome 17 surrounding the von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1) gene.,"The von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1) gene has been mapped to the pericentromeric region of chromosome 17. We conducted linkage analyses of NF1 by using 10 polymorphic DNA markers from this chromosomal region. We ascertained 20 American Caucasian NF1 families (163 individuals, 98 NF1 affected) in Michigan and Ohio and also studied a large family ascertained primarily in North Carolina. The following markers were used in this study: HHH202, TH17.19, D17Z1, ERBA1, EW203, EW206, EW207, EW301, CRI-L581, and CRI-L946. NF1 did not recombine with either TH17.19 or HHH202 in any of the informative meioses surveyed (maximum lod scores of 17.04 and 7.21, respectively, at a recombination fraction of .00), indicating that these markers map very close to the NF1 gene. We also report evidence of three instances of recombination between NF1 and the centromeric marker D17Z1 (maximum lod score of 13.43 at a recombination fraction of .04), as well as two crossovers between pairs of marker loci. We find no evidence of locus heterogeneity, and our results support the localization of the NF1 gene to proximal chromosome 17q.",,S R Diehl; M Boehnke; R P Erickson; L M Ploughman; K A Seiler; J L Lieberman; H B Clarke; M A Bruce; E K Schorry; M Pericak-Vance,American journal of human genetics,1989-01,,abstract_only,False

HRUS was abnormal in 52 patients (87 %), 34 in the PNS group (92 %) and 18 in the non-PNS group (78 %, p = 0.24). Patients with continuous nerve enlargements (high PN tumor load) were easily distinguished with HRUS. 85 % of patients with normal NCS have nerve enlargements on HRUS.

PMID:23140466,Regression of schwannomas induced by adeno-associated virus-mediated delivery of caspase-1.,"Schwannomas are tumors formed by proliferation of dedifferentiated Schwann cells. Patients with neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) and schwannomatosis develop multiple schwannomas in peripheral and cranial nerves. Although benign, these tumors can cause extreme pain and compromise sensory/motor functions, including hearing and vision. At present, surgical resection is the main treatment modality, but it can be problematic because of tumor inaccessibility and risk of nerve damage. We have explored gene therapy for schwannomas, using a model in which immortalized human NF2 schwannoma cells expressing a fluorescent protein and luciferase are implanted in the sciatic nerve of nude mice. Direct injection of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 1 vector encoding caspase-1 (ICE) under the Schwann-cell specific promoter, P0, leads to regression of these tumors with essentially no vector-mediated neuropathology, and no changes in sensory or motor function. In a related NF2 xenograft model designed to cause measurable pain behavior, the same gene therapy leads to tumor regression and concordant resolution of tumor-associated pain. This AAV1-P0-ICE vector holds promise for clinical treatment of schwannomas by direct intratumoral injection to achieve reduction in tumor size and normalization of neuronal function.",,Shilpa Prabhakar; Mehran Taherian; Davide Gianni; Thomas J Conlon; Giulia Fulci; Jillian Brockmann; Anat Stemmer-Rachamimov; Miguel Sena-Esteves; Xandra O Breakefield; Gary J Brenner,Human gene therapy,2013-02,10.1089/hum.2012.094,abstract_only,False
PMID:1519665,Nonradioactive in situ hybridization using digoxigenin-labeled oligonucleotides. Applications to musculoskeletal tissues.,"We have optimized a technique for in situ localization of specific mRNAs using digoxigenin-11-dUTP-labeled oligonucleotide probes. DNA probes were synthesized for type I and type II collagen as well as transforming growth factor-beta 1 and 2 (TGF beta 1 and TGF beta 2). Control experiments, such as competitive inhibition, nonsense sequence hybridization, and RNAse digestion all indicated that the technique was highly sensitive and specific. In sections of growth plate, type II collagen mRNA was predominantly expressed in the lower proliferative and upper hypertrophic zone, whereas chondrocytes in articular cartilage stained equally. These techniques then were applied to sections cut from archival pathology specimens of musculoskeletal tissues. Primitive chondrocytes in a chondrosarcoma expressed type I and type II collagen mRNA, but did not stain with the nonsense probe. Sections from an osteosarcoma, an aneurysmal bone cyst, and a neurofibroma also were investigated. The ability to use chemically synthesized oligonucleotide probes, the high resolution, and the short development times possible with this in situ procedure makes this technique appealing for applied research into the gene expression of normal and pathologic cellular events.",,I D Crabb; S S Hughes; D G Hicks; J E Puzas; G J Tsao; R N Rosier,The American journal of pathology,1992-09,,abstract_only,False
PMID:30615146,Preclinical assessment of MEK1/2 inhibitors for neurofibromatosis type 2-associated schwannomas reveals differences in efficacy and drug resistance development.,"BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a genetic tumor-predisposition disorder caused by NF2/merlin tumor suppressor gene inactivation. The hallmark of NF2 is formation of bilateral vestibular schwannomas (VS). Because merlin modulates activity of the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, we investigated repurposing drugs targeting MEK1 and/or MEK2 as a treatment for NF2-associated schwannomas. METHODS: Mouse and human merlin-deficient Schwann cell lines (MD-MSC/HSC) were screened against 6 MEK1/2 inhibitors. Efficacious drugs were tested in orthotopic allograft and NF2 transgenic mouse models. Pathway and proteome analyses were conducted. Drug efficacy was examined in primary human VS cells with NF2 mutations and correlated with DNA methylation patterns. RESULTS: Trametinib, PD0325901, and cobimetinib were most effective in reducing MD-MSC/HSC viability. Each decreased phosphorylated pERK1/2 and cyclin D1, increased p27, and induced caspase-3 cleavage in MD-MSCs. Proteomic analysis confirmed cell cycle arrest and activation of pro-apoptotic pathways in trametinib-treated MD-MSCs. The 3 inhibitors slowed allograft growth; however, decreased pERK1/2, cyclin D1, and Ki-67 levels were observed only in PD0325901 and cobimetinib-treated grafts. Tumor burden and average tumor size were reduced in trametinib-treated NF2 transgenic mice; however, tumors did not exhibit reduced pERK1/2 levels.

PMID:38499890,"The PlexiQoL, a patient-reported outcome measure on quality of life in neurofibromatosis type 1-associated plexiform neurofibroma: translation, cultural adaptation and validation into the Dutch language for the Netherlands.","BACKGROUND: Half of the patients with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) develop one or more tumours called plexiform neurofibromas, which can have a significant impact on Quality of Life (QoL). The PlexiQoL questionnaire is a disease-specific QoL measure for adults with NF1-associated plexiform neurofibromas. The aim of this study was to adapt and validate a Dutch version of the PlexiQoL for the Netherlands. METHODS: The PlexiQoL was translated using the dual-panel methodology, followed by cognitive debriefing interviews to assess face and content validity. The psychometric properties were evaluated by administering the questionnaire on two separate occasions to a sample of adults with NF1 and plexiform neurofibromas. Feasibility was evaluated by the presence of floor/ceiling effects. Reliability was assessed by evaluating Cronbach's alpha coefficient and test-retest reliability, using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to check for known group validity. The Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) questionnaire was used as comparator questionnaire to evaluate convergent validity. RESULTS: The translation and cognitive debriefing interviews resulted in a Dutch version of the PlexiQoL that reflected the original concept and underlying semantic meanings of the UK English version. Forty participants completed the validation survey. The Dutch PlexiQoL demonstrated excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's α 0.825) and test-retest reliability (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.928). The questionnaire detected differences in PlexiQoL scores between participants based on self-reported general health and disease severity. Convergent validity was confirmed for relevant NHP subsections. CONCLUSIONS: The Dutch PlexiQoL demonstrated excellent psychometric properties and can be reliably used to measure plexiform neurofibroma-related QoL in adults with NF1 in the Netherlands.","Methods The PlexiQoL was translated using the dual-panel methodology, followed by cognitive debriefing interviews to assess face and content validity. The psychometric properties were evaluated by administering the questionnaire on two separate occasions to a sample of adults with NF1 and plexiform neurofibromas. Feasibility was evaluated by the presence of floor/ceiling effects. Reliability was assessed by evaluating Cronbach’s alpha coefficient and test-retest reliability, using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to check for known group validity. The Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) questionnaire was used as comparator questionnaire to evaluate convergent validity. Methods The PlexiQoL The PlexiQoL consists of 18 items with a dichotomous response option (True / Not True). The number of times that a participant chooses ‘True’ is summed to produce a score ranging from 0 to 18, with a higher score indicating poorer QoL. The development and validation of the original PlexiQoL was conducted in the UK and US simultaneously [ 18 ]. It demonstrated excellent internal consistency (Cronbach’s α 0.90) and reproducibility (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.90), and it could distinguish between groups of patients based on general health perceptions and perceived plexiform neurofibroma severity (known groups validity) in the developmental sample. The validation of the Dutch PlexiQoL for the Netherlands consisted of three stages: translation, assessment of face and content validity, and further psychometric evaluation (feasibility, reliability, convergent validity, and known groups validity). Translation The dual panel translation methodology as recommended by Hunt et al. was employed to translate the UK English version of the PlexiQoL into Dutch [ 20 ]. This methodology emphasises the importance of achieving conceptual equivalence in the translated items to the original. This method of translation does not involve back-translation. Rather, for non-English speaking countries, two stages are conducted; a linguistic stage (to provide the initial translation into the target language) and a lay stage (where items are assessed for comprehension and ‘naturalness’ of language). This methodology has been used in all needs-based PRO adaptations [ 21 – 23 ]. The method was adapted slightly due to the COVID-19 pandemic: a video conference call system was used instead of performing in-person meetings. The linguistic meeting included an expert linguist who was fluent in English and Dutch, with Dutch as their native language as well as a researcher from the UK PlexiQoL development team. The role of this individual was to guide the process, and to explain the precise conceptual meaning of the items to the linguist. The purpose of this stage was to suggest translations for the instructions, items, and response categories, while ensuring that the Dutch translations captured the underlying semantic meaning behind each item. If consensus could not be reached, proposals for alternative translations of the item were sent to the lay people for consideration. The translated version was then presented to lay people by individual interviews. The lay interviews were held with two male and three female monolingual Dutch-speaking individuals from the Netherlands, aged between 22 and 65 years, who did not have NF1, and who had low to average educational backgrounds. This criteria was to ensure that the final wording was at an appropriate level for typical patients. The lay people were recruited via a market research company in the Netherlands. During the interviews, the items of the questionnaire were assessed for comprehension and the ‘naturalness’ of the language used. In particular, participants were asked whether the phrasing of the items was acceptable or whether these should be changed to make the items more natural or simpler in Dutch, whilst maintaining the original meaning. In addition, the lay people were presented with three different translations of the response options ‘True/Not true’ to see which one was preferred, because in Dutch there are multiple ways of saying this in response to the respective question (‘does this statement apply to you’). Face and content validity The purpose of the Cognitive Debriefing Interviews (CDIs) was to test the applicability, relevance and comprehensiveness of the instrument as seen by relevant patients. Ten CDIs were conducted with adults that had NF1-associated plexiform neurofibroma. It is recommended to perform five to eight interviews [ 24 ], however, in order to keep it consistent with other needs-based measures and allowing for adequate variation in age, gender and disease severity in patients, ten were conducted. The verbal probing technique was utilised [ 25 ]. Patients were asked to participate in the CDIs when they visited the Neurology outpatient clinic of the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Participants had to meet the revised diagnostic criteria for NF1 [ 26 ] and have at least one plexiform neurofibroma. All invited participants agreed to participate (response rate 100%). In the one-to-one, semi-structured interviews, participants were asked to complete the questionnaire in the presence of a trained interviewer using a video call system. As such, the interviewer could observe difficulties or hesitation when completing specific items. After completing the questionnaire, scripted verbal probes were used to ask the participants whether they considered the items relevant, applicable, and comprehensible and if they believed that any important aspects of their experience with NF1-associated plexiform neurofibroma had been omitted. This was combined with additional unscripted probes for items where the interviewees showed difficulties or hesitation when completing the questionnaire. Further psychometric evaluation The psychometric properties of the Dutch PlexiQoL were evaluated through a postal survey. Adults who met the revised diagnostic criteria for NF1 [ 26 ] and who had one or more plexiform neurofibroma were recruited when they visited the Neurology outpatient clinic of the Erasmus Medical Centre from July 2022 through April 2023. This was a new sample of participants who had not taken part in the previous CDIs. The PlexiQoL was administered to the participants on two occasions, with 14 days between the two administrations. At the first administration, the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) was included as a comparator questionnaire [ 27 ]. The NHP is a generic health profile questionnaire that provides an indication of a patient’s perceived emotional, social and physical health problems. It consists of 38 items that cover six subsections: physical mobility, pain, energy level, emotional reactions, sleep and social isolation. For each section, scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater perceived distress. In addition, a form was included to collect basic demographic information, including sex, age, the self-perceived general health and severity of the plexiform neurofibroma (both rated on a 4-point Likert scale), current treatment for the plexiform neurofibroma, and other health problems. The second administration consisted of the PlexiQoL and a shortened version of the demographic form, inquiring about the perceived general health, plexiform neurofibroma severity, and other health problems. Additional clinical information was extracted from the electronic health records of the participants. Extracted items consisted of the location of the plexiform neurofibroma, the presence of certain plexiform neurofibroma-related complications (pain which required drug intervention, neurological deficits, and disfigurement), other NF1-related disease manifestations (osseous lesions, optic pathway glioma (OPG), other brain glioma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour), mutation type (familial/de novo), and the presentation of NF1 (generalised/segmental). Statistical analysis The statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 28.0. Non-parametric tests were used given the ordinal nature and non-normal distribution of the data. PlexiQoL and NHP scores were computed according to their respective scoring instructions. For the descriptive analyses the mean, standard deviation (SD) and range were calculated for continuous variables, and count and frequency for categorical variables. Mann-Whitney U or Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to see if there were differences in PlexiQoL scores between participants grouped by demographic factors. The feasibility of the PlexiQoL was assessed by determining the response rate, percentage of missing answers, and the presence of floor and/or ceiling effects. Floor and ceiling effects were considered significant if ≥ 15% of the participants scored the lowest or highest absolute value on the questionnaire [ 28 ]. For all analyses, significance was based on a two-sided p-value of < 0.05. Cronbach’s α was calculated to evaluate the internal consistency, which measures the extent to which the items of the questionnaire are interrelated. A Cronbach’s α of ≥ 0.70 is considered adequate [ 29 ]. The test-retest reliability of the Dutch PlexiQoL was assessed by calculating the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients between the PlexiQoL scores of the first and second administration for each participant. A value of ≥ 0.75 indicates that the questionnaire has adequate test-retest reliability, showing low levels of random measurement error [ 30 ]. Convergent validity was assessed by the Spearman rank correlation coefficients between the scores of the PlexiQoL and the scales of the comparator measure (NHP) that measure the same or related constructs in QoL. It was hypothesized that the PlexiQoL score would correlate significantly with all sections of the NHP, with exception of the ‘Pain’ and ‘Sleep’ section, based on the items contained in the PlexiQoL. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to investigate whether the PlexiQoL would be able to discriminate between groups of participants based on self-reported health perceptions, plexiform neurofibroma severity, treatment for plexiform neurofibroma yes/no, the presence of other health problems, and the presentation of NF1 (general vs. segmental) (known groups validity). Effect sizes were assessed using Cohen’s  d ; 0.20 ≤  d  < 0.50 were considered small, 0.50 ≤  d  < 0.80 as medium, and  d  ≥ 0.80 were considered large [ 31 ].",Britt A E Dhaenens; Sarah A van Dijk; Walter Taal; D Christine Noordhoek; Anna Coffey; Stephen P McKenna; Rianne Oostenbrink,Journal of patient-reported outcomes,2024-03-18,10.1186/s41687-024-00714-y,minimal,True
PMID:20551058,Cyclic AMP suppression is sufficient to induce gliomagenesis in a mouse model of neurofibromatosis-1.,"Current models of oncogenesis incorporate the contributions of chronic inflammation and aging to the patterns of tumor formation. These oncogenic pathways, involving leukocytes and fibroblasts, are not readily applicable to brain tumors (glioma), and other mechanisms must account for microenvironmental influences on central nervous system tumorigenesis. Previous studies from our laboratories have used neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models to understand the spatial restriction of glioma formation to the optic pathway of young children. Based on our initial findings, we hypothesize that brain region-specific differences in cAMP levels account for the pattern of NF1 gliomagenesis. To provide evidence that low levels of cAMP promote glioma formation in NF1, we generated foci of decreased cAMP in brain regions where gliomas rarely form in children with NF1. Focal cAMP reduction was achieved by forced expression of phosphodiesterase 4A1 (PDE4A1) in the cortex of Nf1 GEM strains. Ectopic PDE4A1 expression produced hypercellular lesions with features of human NF1-associated glioma. Conversely, pharmacologic elevation of cAMP with the PDE4 inhibitor rolipram dramatically inhibited optic glioma growth and tumor size in Nf1 GEM in vivo. Together, these results indicate that low levels of cAMP in a susceptible Nf1 mouse strain are sufficient to promote gliomagenesis, and justify the implementation of cAMP-based stroma-targeted therapies for glioma.","Materials and Methods Animals All animals were used in accordance with an established Animal Studies Protocol approved by the Washington University School of Medicine Animal Studies Committee. Wild type ( Nf1 ), Tumor Progenitor ( flox/flox Nf1 ; GFAP-Cre), and OPG ( flox/flox Nf1 ; GFAP-Cre) mice were generated as previously described ( flox/mut 7 )( Table 1 ). Human Tumor and Brain Sections Paraffin-embedded optic pathway glioma specimens from patients with NF1 (n=4) and normal human brain and optic chiasm autopsy specimens were retrieved from the archives of the Department of Pathology at the Washington University School of Medicine in accordance with an Institutional Review Board approved protocol for the use of human pathology specimens. Chemicals, Reagents, and Antibodies All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. All tissue culture reagents and media were obtained from Invitrogen unless otherwise indicated. A construct containing mCherry cDNA was a gift of Dr. Roger Y. Tsien (University of California). Murine PDE4A1 (accession no.  AJ297396 ) was provided by Dr. James Cherry (Boston University). Antibodies were obtained from Peprotech (CXCL12), Clontech (Dsred (mCherry)), Invitrogen (GFAP), Abcam (PDE4A & 58kD Golgi marker), Pharmingen (LCA), Wako (IBA-1), Cell Signaling (phosphorylated protein kinase A (pPKA) substrate) and Sigma (CNPase). Antibody directed against phosphorylated CXCR4 (pCXCR4) was developed in our lab and previously described ( 10 ). Antibody directed against Olig2 (DF-308) was a gift of Dr. Charles Stiles (Dana Farber Cancer Institute). Lentiviruses Full-length murine PDE4A1 or catalytically inactive PDE4A1-H229Q was cloned into a lentiviral packaging vector that also encodes mCherry fluorescent protein as previously described ( 11 ). A second packaging vector (FUW-FLG) encoding a fusion of firefly luciferase and enhanced green fluorescent protein driven by the human ubiquitin C promoter within an established lentiviral backbone ( 12 ) was also used as previously described ( 13 ,  14 ). Viral particles were produced from each packaging vector separately by the Viral Vectors Core Facility of The Hope Center for Neurological Diseases at Washington University School of Medicine. Mutagenesis The catalytically inactive PDE4A1-H229Q ( 15 ) was generated from full-length murine PDE4A1 using a Quikchange ®  mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions and the following mutagenesis primers:
 Sense: 5’ – CAT GAC GTC GAC CAG CCT GGC GTC TCC AAC – 3’ Antisense: 5’ – GTT GGA GAC GCC AGG CTG GTC GAC GTC ATG – 3’. Mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing; expression and activity of catalytically active and inactive PDE4A1 constructs were determined first in Daoy medulloblastoma cells (American Type Culture Collection). Daoy cells were infected with lentivirus encoding either catalytically active or inactive PDE4A1 as previously described ( 11 ). Cells expressing PDE4A1 constructs were sorted and collected based on mCherry expression by high-speed fluorescence-activated cell sorting (MoFlo High-Performance Cell Sorter; DAKO). As described below, expression levels were measured by western blot, intracellular localization by immunofluorescence microscopy and effects on cAMP levels by ELISA. Intracranial Viral Injections Five to seven week old wild type ( Nf1 ), Tumor Progenitor ( flox/flox Nf1 ; GFAP-Cre), and OPG ( flox/flox Nf1 ; GFAP-Cre) mice were anesthetized [intraperitoneal ketamine (87 mg/kg)/xylazine (13 mg/kg); Phoenix Pharmaceuticals], the cranium was exposed, and a small hole was made 2 mm lateral and posterior to the bregma with a size 34 inverted cone burr (Dremel). Mice were positioned in a stereotactic frame (Stoelting) and 500,000 transducing units each of FUW-FLG and PDE4A1-Cherry or PDE4A1-H229Q viruses were injected through a 27-gauge needle over 2 min at 3 mm below the dura mater. The incision was closed with Vetbond (3M). A few hours after the injection and every 12 hours for 48 hours thereafter, all animals received subcutaneous injections of 0.5 mg/kg Buprenorphine hydrochloride. flox/mut",Nicole M Warrington; Scott M Gianino; Erin Jackson; Patricia Goldhoff; Joel R Garbow; David Piwnica-Worms; David H Gutmann; Joshua B Rubin,Cancer research,2010-07-15,10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-3769,minimal,True
PMID:11756419,Structural basis for neurofibromatosis type 2. Crystal structure of the merlin FERM domain.,"Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a dominantly inherited disease associated with the central nervous system. The NF2 gene product merlin is a tumor suppressor, and its mutation or inactivation causes this disease. We report here the crystal structure of the merlin FERM domain containing a 22-residue alpha-helical segment. The structure reveals that the merlin FERM domain consists of three subdomains displaying notable features of the electrostatic surface potentials, although the overall surface potentials similar to those of ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) proteins indicate electrostatic membrane association. The structure also is consistent with inactivation mechanisms caused by the pathogenic mutations associated with NF2.",,Toshiyuki Shimizu; Azusa Seto; Nobuo Maita; Keisuke Hamada; Shoichiro Tsukita; Sachiko Tsukita; Toshio Hakoshima,The Journal of biological chemistry,2002-03-22,10.1074/jbc.M109979200,abstract_only,False
PMID:41023593,Selective inhibition of BRAF and CRAF sensitizes NF1-deficient malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors to MEK inhibitors.,"BACKGROUND: Treatment for patients with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) is an unmet clinical need. Loss of NF1 in MPNST leads to hyperactivation of RAS, however little is known about relevant downstream oncogenic signaling through RAF paralogs and effective targeted therapies in MPNST are still lacking. METHODS: Conditional gene expression, CRISPR-CAS9, and shRNA-mediated knockdown were used to perform gain/loss-of-function experiments to explore the effect of reconstituting the GTPase-activating protein-related domain of NF1 or knockdown of A/B/CRAF kinases on ERK signaling output and MPNST cell growth. Colony formation, cell proliferation and live cells imaging assays were performed to assess cell growth in response to genetic manipulations or drug treatments. Pathway enrichment analysis on RNA sequencing following drug perturbation, efficacy studies in cell-line-derived and patient-derived xenograft models, and immunoblotting/immunohistochemistry were conducted to assess tumor growth and ERK pathway activity in cells or in pharmacodynamic analyses of tumor xenografts. RESULTS: NF1 loss activates RAS/ERK signaling through B/CRAF, and cell growth and ERK signaling of NF1-MPNST are dependent on B/CRAF, but not ARAF. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of B/CRAF using a paralog-selective RAF inhibitor (RAFi) significantly potentiates MEK inhibitor (MEKi) treatment through more effective suppression of ERK signaling and proliferation. This is shown in multiple traditional and patient-derived cell line and xenograft models, including those with acquired resistance to MEKi. CONCLUSIONS: These findings contribute preclinical evidence that the combination of paralog-selective B/CRAFi and MEKi is effective in NF1-MPNST and can overcome resistance to single agent MEKi.

Materials and Methods In vivo mouse studies 6- to 8-week-old NSG (NOD.Cg-Prkdc scid  Il2rg tm1Wjl /SzJ, strain #:005557, Jackson Laboratory or Johns Hopkins Oncology Animal Facility) and SCID (C.B-17/IcrHsd-Prkdc scid , Envigo) female mice were used for in vivo efficacy studies. All mouse experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Johns Hopkins (JH) and University of Texas, San Antonio. Minced patient-derived or cell-line derived tumor xenograft fragments from seed mice were implanted subcutaneously close to the sciatic nerves, into study mice (n = 7–8/ arm). Drug treatment was started when tumor size reached roughly 120–200 mm 3 , around five weeks after tumor implantation. Mice were randomized into treatment groups using the randomizr package that arranges animals to achieve the best-case distribution to ensure that each treatment group has a similar mean tumor burden and standard deviation. Vehicle, trametinib (dosed at 0.075 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg, QD- once daily), LXH254 (dosed at 25 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg, BID- twice daily), or their combination were administrated by oral gavage, based on mean group body weight, with continuous treatment schedule. The endpoint of the experiment for efficacy studies was considered 4–5 weeks on treatment or the longest tumor diameter of 2 cm as per the approved protocol, whichever occurred first. Mice were monitored daily, and tumors were measured once or twice weekly using calipers in two dimensions, and tumor volume was calculated by: L × W 2 (π/6), where L is the longest diameter and W is the width. Fold change in tumor growth was calculated using the formula: (day X/ day 0)-1. MPNST diagnosis was confirmed by pathologists by reviewing H&E slides from patient-derived primary tumors and mouse xenografts.

PMID:32642739,Clinical trial design in neurofibromatosis type 1 as a model for other tumor predisposition syndromes.,"Up to 10% of all pediatric cancer patients may have an underlying germline mutation which predisposed them to develop a malignancy. With more patients being tested for and diagnosed with genetic tumor predisposition syndromes, there has been improved characterization of their many nonmalignant manifestations. However, designing and implementing clinical trials to treat the nonmalignant tumor and non-tumor manifestations of these syndromes poses many unique challenges. Unlike trials for malignancies where tumor response and survival can be used as straightforward trial endpoints, the nonmalignant manifestations are often chronic, evolve more slowly over time, and may not be immediately life-threatening. Therefore, they will likely require a different approach to both testing and treatment with a focus on more functional and patient-reported outcome trial endpoints. The recent success of treatment trials for the benign tumors plexiform neurofibromas in the tumor predisposition syndrome neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) can be used as a model for the development of clinical trials in other tumor predisposition syndromes. In this article, we review the unique challenges associated with targeting the nonmalignant aspects of these conditions as well as some of the lessons learned from the NF1 experience which may be applied to other syndromes in the future.",,Andrea M Gross; Brigitte C Widemann,Neuro-oncology advances,2020-07,10.1093/noajnl/vdaa017,abstract_only,False
PMID:38127282,Spatial Gene-Expression Profiling Unveils Immuno-oncogenic Programs of NF1-Associated Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor Progression.,"PURPOSE: Plexiform neurofibromas (PNF) are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNST) associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Despite similar histologic appearance, these neoplasms exhibit diverse evolutionary trajectories, with a subset progressing to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), the leading cause of premature death in individuals with NF1. Malignant transformation of PNF often occurs through the development of atypical neurofibroma (ANF) precursor lesions characterized by distinct histopathologic features and CDKN2A copy-number loss. Although genomic studies have uncovered key driver events promoting tumor progression, the transcriptional changes preceding malignant transformation remain poorly defined. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Here we resolve gene-expression profiles in PNST across the neurofibroma-to-MPNST continuum in NF1 patients and mouse models, revealing early molecular features associated with neurofibroma evolution and transformation. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrate that ANF exhibit enhanced signatures of antigen presentation and immune response, which are suppressed as malignant transformation ensues. MPNST further displayed deregulated survival and mitotic fidelity pathways, and targeting key mediators of these pathways, CENPF and BIRC5, disrupted the growth and viability of human MPNST cell lines and primary murine Nf1-Cdkn2a-mutant Schwann cell precursors. Finally, neurofibromas contiguous with MPNST manifested distinct alterations in core oncogenic and immune surveillance programs, suggesting that early molecular events driving disease progression may precede histopathologic evidence of malignancy. CONCLUSIONS: If validated prospectively in future studies, these signatures may serve as molecular diagnostic tools to augment conventional histopathologic diagnosis by identifying neurofibromas at high risk of undergoing malignant transformation, facilitating risk-adapted care.","Experimental Design: Here we resolve gene expression profiles in PNSTs across the neurofibroma-to-MPNST continuum in NF1 patients and mouse models, revealing early molecular features associated with neurofibroma evolution and transformation. METHODS Ethical considerations Archived samples, associated clinical data and imaging were collected under approval by the Indiana University Institutional Review Board (IRB Protocol #17332). Animal studies were conducted according to the guidelines established by the Indiana University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC Protocol #21009). Sample selection Samples were selected retrospectively by querying the Indiana University pathology archives with the search terms “neurofibromatosis type 1”, “ANNUBP”, “atypical neurofibroma”, “neurofibroma with atypia,” “plexiform neurofibroma,” and “MPNST.” Priority was given to cases of NF with atypia or ANNUBP that had additional samples from the same patient classified as PNF and/or MPNST. Several isolated PNST cases were also included in the analysis. Slide review, microdissection and RNA extraction from FFPE tissues Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissue sections from each tumor were scanned using an Aperio ScanScope CS digital slide scanner at 20x magnification. A board-certified pathologist, with expertise in diagnosing NF1-associated nerve sheath tumors digitally annotated tissue areas meeting consensus diagnostic criteria ( 10 ). Areas of hemorrhage and necrosis were excluded from the analysis. Formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues were microdissected from 5 μm thick sections on freshly cut slides. Total RNA was extracted using a RNeasy FFPE Kit (Qiagen). RNA concentration and fragmentation index were quantified on an Agilent bioanalyzer. Gene expression analysis was conducted on the nCounter ®  Sprint Profiler (NanoString Technologies, Inc.) using the nCounter ®  human PanCancer IO360 ™  probe set (NanoString Technologies, Inc.). Fragmentation index (percent greater than 200 bp) was used to normalize the loading of 50 ng total input RNA in a final volume of 5 μL with the capture probe set. Probes and target transcripts were hybridized for 20 hours at 65°C per the manufacturer’s recommendations. Hybridized samples were loaded into a nCounter ®  cartridge and quantified on the nCounter ®  Sprint Profiler. Quality control, normalization, differential expression and pathway analysis were performed using nSolver Advanced Analysis Software (version 4.0, Nanostring Technologies, Inc.) as further detailed below. Quality Control Adequate signal was observed across all samples in the data set as indicated by the heatmap of raw counts in ( Supplemental Figure 1 ,  Supplemental Table 1 ). 40 probes below threshold with raw counts less than 25 (below the level of the background) were excluded from further analysis ( Supplemental Table 2 ). Normalization Data were normalized using both positive control probes and housekeeping genes. Prior to hybridization, non-natural RNA sequences (positive control) probes were added to the samples at known concentrations to control for variations in pipetting and hybridization across samples. The read counts of each sample were then normalized by a correction factor computed by the geometric mean level of the control probes of across all samples divided by the levels of the control probes in individual samples. To account for differences in RNA loading and quality, a set of housekeeping genes exhibiting low variance across all samples profiled were selected using the geNorm algorithm to form a normalization constant for each sample ( Supplemental Table 3  and  4 ). Housekeeping probes with significant sample-to sample-variability and were excluded from the housekeeping normalization. Normalized and log 2  transformed normalized counts for each probe and sample used in the downstream differential gene expression analysis are presented in  Supplemental Table 5  and  6 , respectively. Differential gene expression and pathway analysis Statistical analysis of differentially expressed genes and signature pathway scoring was performed using the Differential Expression (DE) and PathView modules of the nSolver Advanced Analysis Platform (version 4.0, NanoString Technologies, Inc.). Multiplicity adjusted p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results of differential gene expression ( Supplemental Table 7  and  8 ) and PathView analysis ( Supplemental Table 9 ) used in downstream plotting and data visualization are presented in the supplemental data. Sample metadata used for analysis are provided in  Supplemental Table 10 . RNAseq analysis RNAseq data from murine peripheral nerve sheath tumors arising in  DhhCre  mice harboring  Nf1 -floxed alleles and  Ink4a/Arf  heterozygosity, as described by Chaney et al.

Publicly available RNA sequencing data was also obtained from the TARGET TCGA GTEx database using the UCSC Xena browser (RRID:SCR_018938). Differential gene expression analysis was performed using the UCSC Xena browser to compare gene expression profiles between TCGA MPNST (n=10) and GTEx Normal Nerve samples (n=335). A volcano plot of the resulting data was generated using GraphPad Prism 9.5.1 software. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) PCA was conducted in IDEP.92 ( 20 ) using log 2  transformed, normalized counts as input under default settings. Heatmaps The pathway heatmap in  Figure 2C  was generated using the nSolver Advanced Analysis Platform (version 4.0, Nanostring Technologies, Inc). The gene expression heatmap in  Supplemental Figure 3  was generated using iDEP.92 ( 20 ). Log 2  transformed, z-score normalized counts from the top 100 most variable genes were clustered by correlation coefficient with average linkage. Heatmaps in  Figure 5B  and  C  were generated using Morpheus with log 2  transformed, z-score normalized counts from all genes clustered by correlation coefficient with average linkage. Heatmaps in  Supplemental Figure 8B  and  Figure 6C  were generated using the Omics Playground v2.7.18 platform ( 21 ) and were generated using the ComplexHeatmap R/Bioconductor package (RRID:SCR_017270) on scaled log-expression values (z-score) using Euclidean distance and Ward linkage. The standard deviation was used to rank the genes for the reduced heatmaps. Rows represent individual genes, and their respective expression log 2  normalized, z-score transformed expression values across each sample in the data. Columns represent individual samples, with annotation tracks below indicating sample IDs and above indicating status of contiguity with MPNST. Gene Set Signature Maps Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) plots were generated by Omics Playground v2.7.18 ( 21 ). Clustering of features was computed using a normalized log-expression matrix (logCPM), with covariance as the distance metric. UMAP clustered gene sets were colored by standard-deviation (sd.X). Labels reflect Hallmark gene set enrichment. Single cell RNAsequencing scRNA-seq data from four human MPNST samples with NF1 were downloaded from GEO ( GSE179043 ) ( 22 ). Data preprocessing and visualization was performed using Scanpy (RRID:SCR_018139) in Python. Low-quality cells with less than 200 genes, genes expressed in less than 3 cells, and outlier cells with less than the 2%tile or greater than 98%tile of the number of genes detected, or greater than 20% mitochondrial counts were discarded. Filtered data from the four samples were concatenated. The top 4,000 highly variable genes were selected with the Seurat v3 method. An scVI model ( 23 ) was trained on the raw counts with sample and quality metrics (percentage of mitochondrial counts and total counts) as covariates. The latent representation and normalized expression values from the scVI model were extracted for downstream analysis to compute the neighborhood graph, UMAP coordinates, and Leiden clusters at a resolution of 0.5. After identifying cellular communities with similar transcriptional profiles, the decoupler package ( 24 ) was used to perform over-representation analysis (ORA) of cell type markers against canonical human cell type markers obtained from the PanglaoDB database ( 25 ). ORA estimates were converted to activation scores and ranked to identify the top five predicted cell types for each cluster. Final annotations were assigned manually following assessment of the enrichment results. To further distinguish malignant from non-malignant cells, the infercnvpy package ( https://github.com/icbi-lab/infercnvpy ) was used to detect copy number variations (CNVs) from single cell transcriptomic data. The average gene expression over genomic regions was compared between immune cell types (as references cells) and query cells, using a window size of 25. CNV scores were computed for each cell based on the number and magnitude of CNV events detected and projected onto the UMAP coordinates for visual confirmation. Immunohistochemistry 5 μm thick tissue sections were deparaffinized, hydrated and transferred to 0.1M EDTA (pH 8.0) for antigen retrieval in a pressure cooker. Sections were then treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min, rinsed and blocked with 5% normal goat serum in TBST (TBS buffer with 0.1% Tween-20), and incubated overnight at 4 °C or 45 minutes at room temp (CD31) with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer: CD31 (3528S, 1:100, Cell Signaling), Survivin (MA5–15077, 1:200, Invitrogen), and CENPF (PA5–84637, 1:200, Invitrogen) and H3K27me3 (9733S, 1:100, Cell Signaling). Sections were then incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature (goat anti-rabbit, ab205718, 1:1000, Abcam or goat anti-mouse, ab205719 1:1000, Abcam). VECTASTAIN DAB was applied for 10 minutes and the reaction was terminated by rinsing in distilled water. Counterstaining was performed with modified Mayer’s hematoxylin (Vector), and the sections were dehydrated, cleared and coverslipped. Slide images were acquired on an Aperio ScanScope CS at 20x magnification. CD31+ staining blood vessels were counted manually on five randomly selected high-power fields per slide. Quantitative immunohistochemical analysis for BIRC5 and CENPF was conducted using the Cytonuclear IHC module of HALO Image Analysis software (version 2.0.5, Indica Labs). Cytonuclear analysis settings were optimized for each stain and the intensity of nuclear staining was scored as negative (0, blue), weakly positive (1+, yellow), moderately positive (2+, orange), or strongly positive (3+, red). All positive cells (1–3+) were used for statistical analysis in GraphPad Prism software as described below. Culture of Human MPNST cell lines Human MPNST cell lines JH-2–002 ( 26 ) and JH-2–103 ( 27 ) were obtained from the Johns Hopkins NF1 Biospecimen Repository. ST-8814 and S462 cells ( 28 ) were obtained from Dr. Andrew Tee (Cardiff University). Immortalized human normal (hTERT ipn02.3 2λ) and NF1 deficient neurofibroma Schwann cells (hTERT NF1 ipNF95.6) ( 29 ) were obtained from Dr. Peggy Wallace. Cells were authenticated by STR analysis. Cells were cultured in either DMEM (NF90.8, ST88–14, ipn02.3 2 2λ and ipNF95.6) or DMEM/F12 (JH-2–002 and JH-2–103) media supplemented with 10% FBS (Harvest Midsci), 1% glutamine (Gibco), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Lonza), and prophylactic 5 μg/mL Plasmocin (Invivogen). Trypsin-EDTA 0.05% (Gibco) was used to dissociate cells for passaging upon reaching confluence. Cultures were tested for mycoplasma and confirmed to be negative prior to experimentation. Isolation and culture of primary murine  Nf1 −/− Arf 
 −/−  and  Nf1 −/− Cdkn2a −/−  DNSCs Embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) mice were extracted by cesarean section from freshly euthanized pregnant females. Dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) and spinal nerve roots were isolated under a stereomicroscope and treated with 20 mg/mL collagenase. After centrifugation and washing in PBS (#20012027, Gibco), the cell pellet was resuspended in DNSC complete media consisting of serum-free DMEM/F12 media (Gibco) supplemented with 0.2% heparin (StemCell), 30% glucose (Gibco), 7.5% sodium bicarbonate (Gibco), 1M HEPES (Gibco), 1% N2 supplement (Gibco), 1% glutamine (Gibco), 1% sodium pyruvate (Gibco), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Lonza), 20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (Sigma-Aldrich), 40 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (PeproTech), 2% B27 (without vitamin A) (Gibco), 40 μg/mL amphotericin B/Fungizone (Gibco), and prophylactic 5 μg/mL Plasmocin (Invivogen). Cells were cultured in low adhesion plates for 7–10 days to form neurospheres, which were then transferred to fibronectin-coated plates for subsequent passaging. Genotyping of  Nf1 flox/flox ; Arf 
  and  flox/flox Nf1 flox/flox ;Cdkn2a  DNSCs was confirmed by PCR using the following primers: flox/flox Nf1 P1: 5’-AATGTGAAATTGGTGTCGA GTAAGGTAACCAC-3’, P2: 5’-TTAAGAGCATCTGCTGCTCTTAGAGGGAA-3’, P3: 5’-TCAGACTGATTGTTGTACCTGAT GGTTGTACC-3’ Arf: P1: Forward (19243): 5’-ACT GCA GCC AGA CCA CTA GG-3’ Reverse (19244): 5’-AGC TCG GAG ATT GAG AAA GC-3’ Cdkn2a: P1: Forward (INK20): 5’-GTTTCCATTGCGAGGCTGCTCCGTAAGC-3’ Reverse (INK21): 5’-CTTTAGGGCGTTCCTTTCCCACTTCTGC-3’ P2: Forward (INK10): 5’-CCAAGTGTGCAAACCCAGGCTCC-3’ Reverse (INK11): 5’-TTGTTGGCCCAGGATGCCGACATC-3’ Nf1 flox/flox ; Arf 
  and  flox/flox Nf1 flox/flox ;Cdkn2a  DNSCs were incubated with Cre recombinase expressing adenovirus (Ad5CMVCre-GFP High Titer, University of Iowa Viral Vector Core) at 1:1000 dilution for 24 hours. The cells were then replenished with fresh DNSC complete media. Cre-mediated recombination of the floxed  flox/flox Nf1 ,  Arf , and  Cdkn2a  alleles in the resulting  Nf1 −/− Arf 
 −/− 
 and Nf1 −/− Cdkn2a −/−  DNSCs was confirmed by PCR and western blot. Dissociation of DNSCs for passaging was performed using 1X TrypLE express enzyme (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Prior to experimentation, cultures were tested for mycoplasma and confirmed to be negative. Drug Treatment Human MPNST cell lines and murine DNSCs were plated at a density of 5,000 cells per well in 96-well plates. Cells were allowed to adhere overnight and then treated with increasing concentrations of YM155 (MedChemExpress, HY-10194) or LQZ-7I (MedChemExpress, HY-136538). Cell viability was assessed using the CellTiter-Glo ®  Assay (Promega) 48–72 hours post-treatment. Endpoint luminescence was measured using a SynergyH4 plate reader with filters and settings as follows: 528/20 and hole filter sets, top read, 4 mm read height, gain 135, 0.5 second integration time. siRNA transfection Human MPNST cell lines were reverse transfected with 10 nM siRNA against CENPF (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-37563), BIRC5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-29499) or scrambled control (Santa Cruz Biotechnolgy, sc-37007) using Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were plated in the transfection complex at a density of 5,000 cells per well in 96-well plates. After 24 hours of transfection, cell lysates were collected to confirm protein knockdown by Western blot. Viability was assessed via CellTiter-Glo ®  Assay 48–72 hours post-transfection as described above. Luminescent values were normalized to the average of the siControl for each cell line. Western Blot Analysis Lysis buffer was prepared using cOmplete Mini Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (#11836153001, Roche), PhosSTOP Phosphotase Inhibitor Cocktail (#4906837001, Roche) and xTractor buffer (#635671, Takara Bio). Cell lysates were collected, and protein concentrations were determined using Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (#23227, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Isolated proteins were fractionated using NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris Gels (Invitrogen Cat#NP0322BOX) and electro-transferred to PVDF membranes. Immunoblots were carried out using antibodies specific to CENPF (ab223847, 1:1000 dilution, Abcam), Survivin (MA5–15077, 1:1000, Invitrogen) and Vinculin (ab219649, 1:1000 dilution, Abcam). After incubation with primary antibody, appropriate HRP conjugated secondary antibody was used (anti-rabbit, #NA934V, 1:2000 dilution, GE Healthcare). Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed in R or using GraphPad Prism 9.5.1 software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). One way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc correction for multiple comparisons or unpaired t-tests were used to evaluate statistically significant differences between groups as detailed in the accompanying figure legends. Adjusted p-values ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. For dose response curves, the IC50s were calculated for each line using nonlinear regression in GraphPad Prism.

PMID:28525381,The cell of origin dictates the temporal course of neurofibromatosis-1 (Nf1) low-grade glioma formation.,"Low-grade gliomas are one of the most common brain tumors in children, where they frequently form within the optic pathway (optic pathway gliomas; OPGs). Since many OPGs occur in the context of the Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) cancer predisposition syndrome, we have previously employed Nf1 genetically-engineered mouse (GEM) strains to study the pathogenesis of these low-grade glial neoplasms. In the light of the finding that human and mouse low-grade gliomas are composed of Olig2+ cells and that Olig2+ oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) give rise to murine high-grade gliomas, we sought to determine whether Olig2+ OPCs could be tumor-initiating cells for Nf1 optic glioma. Similar to the GFAP-Cre transgenic strain previously employed to generate Nf1 optic gliomas, Olig2+ cells also give rise to astrocytes in the murine optic nerve in vivo. However, in contrast to the GFAP-Cre strain where somatic Nf1 inactivation in embryonic neural progenitor/stem cells (Nf1flox/mut; GFAP-Cre mice) results in optic gliomas by 3 months of age in vivo, mice with Nf1 gene inactivation in Olig2+ OPCs (Nf1flox/mut; Olig2-Cre mice) do not form optic gliomas until 6 months of age. These distinct patterns of glioma latency do not reflect differences in the timing or brain location of somatic Nf1 loss. Instead, they most likely reflect the cell of origin, as somatic Nf1 loss in CD133+ neural progenitor/stem cells during late embryogenesis results in optic gliomas at 3 months of age. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the cell of origin dictates the time to tumorigenesis in murine optic glioma.","MATERIALS AND METHODS Mice Nf1+/ − mice [ 30 ] were bred with  Nf1 f/wt  mice to produce  Nf1 flox/mut  mice, and intercrossed with  Nf1 flox/flox ;  Olig2-Cre mice to generate  Nf1 flox/mut ;  Olig2-Cre (FMOC) mice, while  Nf1 flox/mut ;  GFAP-Cre (FMC; [ 11 ]) and  Nf1 flox/flox  [ 31 ] control mice were established as previously reported.  Nf1 flox/mut  mice were also intercrossed with  Nf1 flox/flox ;  Prom1-Cre ER  mice [ 22 ] to generate  Nf1 flox/mut ;  Prom1-Cre ER  (FMPrC) mice. Timed-pregnant FMPrC dams (gestational day 14–16) underwent oral gavage with 1mg tamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and 1 mg progesterone (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in 100μl of corn oil suspension. Olig2-Cre mice (B6-Olig2 tm2 (TVA, cre)Rth /J; Jackson Laboratory; [ 20 ]) and GFAP-Cre mice [ 32 ] were intercrossed with Rosa-GREEN mice (B6.Cg- Gt(ROSA)26Sor tm(CAGZsGreen1)Hze+ / J; Jackson Laboratory) for cell fate mapping. Mice were backcrossed and maintained on a C57Bl/6 background and used in accordance with approved Animal Studies protocols. The recombination frequency of Olig2-Cre (11.11%; data not shown) and GFAP-Cre (13.36%; [ 16 ]) mice were determined following intercrossing with Rosa-GREEN mice. Immunohistochemistry Paraffin and frozen section immunohistochemical analyses were performed [ 33 ] using specific antibodies ( Supplementary Table 1 ), followed by either Alexa-Fluor-tagged secondary antibodies (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) and DAPI counterstaining or biotinylated secondary antibodies and Vectastain Elite ABC development. Terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed as before [ 33 ]. Optic nerve measurements Optic nerves with an intact chiasm were microdissected, photographed, and optic nerve volumes calculated [ 13 ]. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed as previously described [ 33 ].

PMID:24500418,"Phase 2 randomized, flexible crossover, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of the farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib in children and young adults with neurofibromatosis type 1 and progressive plexiform neurofibromas.","BACKGROUND: RAS is dysregulated in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) related plexiform neurofibromas (PNs). The activity of tipifarnib, which blocks RAS signaling by inhibiting its farnesylation, was tested in children and young adults with NF1 and progressive PNs. METHODS: Patients aged 3-25 years with NF1-related PNs and imaging evidence of tumor progression were randomized in a double-blinded fashion to receive tipifarnib (200 mg/m(2) orally every 12 h) or placebo (phase A) and crossed over to the opposite treatment arm at the time of tumor progression (phase B). PN volumes were measured with MRI, and progression was defined as ≥20% volume increase. Time to progression (TTP) in phase A was the primary endpoint, and the trial was powered to detect whether tipifarnib doubled TTP compared with placebo. Toxicity, response, and quality of life were also monitored. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were enrolled. Tipifarnib and placebo were well tolerated. On phase A, the median TTP was 10.6 months on the placebo arm and 19.2 months on the tipifarnib arm (P = .12; 1-sided). Quality of life improved significantly compared with baseline on the tipifarnib arm but not on the placebo arm. Volumetric tumor measurement detected tumor progression earlier than conventional 2-dimensional (WHO) and 1-dimensional (RECIST) methods. CONCLUSIONS: Tipifarnib was well tolerated but did not significantly prolong TTP of PNs compared with placebo. The randomized, flexible crossover design and volumetric PN assessment provided a feasible and efficient means of assessing the efficacy of tipifarnib. The placebo arm serves as an historical control group for phase 2 single-arm trials directed at progressive PNs.",,Brigitte C Widemann; Eva Dombi; Andrea Gillespie; Pamela L Wolters; Jean Belasco; Stewart Goldman; Bruce R Korf; Jeffrey Solomon; Staci Martin; Wanda Salzer; Elizabeth Fox; Nicholas Patronas; Mark W Kieran; John P Perentesis; Alyssa Reddy; John J Wright; AeRang Kim; Seth M Steinberg; Frank M Balis,Neuro-oncology,2014-05,10.1093/neuonc/nou004,abstract_only,False
PMID:3118034,Linkage analysis of peripheral neurofibromatosis to DNA markers on chromosome 8.,"Linkage relationships of the gene for peripheral neurofibromatosis (NF) were assessed in a large American Caucasian pedigree using two DNA markers located on chromosome 8. Linkage to the thyroglobulin locus, located at 8q24, was excluded (lod less than or equal to -2.0) to 21 cM. Data obtained for the tissue plasminogen activator locus, located at 8p12, excluded linkage to 4 cM. These results exclude between 20 to 30% of chromosome 8 as a possible map location for the NF gene in this family. Comparison of the two DNA markers excluded their linkage to 0.5 cM.",,S R Diehl; M Boehnke; F S Collins; R P Erickson; I J Karolyi; L M Ploughman; M A Pericak-Vance; A S Aylsworth; A D Roses,Journal of medical genetics,1987-09,10.1136/jmg.24.9.532,abstract_only,False
PMID:6413007,Tumors of the peripheral nervous system.,"Most tumors (benign and malignant) do not arise from the nerves per se, but from the supporting cells; tumors arising from the cells of Schwann are termed schwannoma or neurilemoma--benign or malignant. Surgical extirpation is the only way of treating these tumors. Radiation therapy can offer significant palliation and prolongation of life, but no cures have been observed. Other forms of therapy (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, etc.) have little to offer at this time. Benign tumors can be treated by local surgical extirpation; malignant tumors must be radically resected, including major amputations where indicated. Certain dermatomes have a proclivity to produce tumors, and new growths (benign and malignant) proximal to the one clinically apparent can be expected in certain patients. Neurofibromatosis (von Recklinghausen's disease) is a genetic error of metabolism with a proclivity to produce multiple neurofibrosarcomas, and in about 10 percent of the patients, malignant neurilemomas. Of 100 patients with malignant neurilemomas treated by the author, 74 were considered determinate; among them, the 10-year ""cure"" rate was 32 percent. Patients with von Recklinghausen's disease had almost as good a 10-year survival rate as those with solitary malignant schwannoma (30 percent vs 39 percent).",,I M Ariel,CA: a cancer journal for clinicians,1983,10.3322/canjclin.33.5.282,abstract_only,False

PMID:7949098,Genetic analysis is consistent with the hypothesis that NF1 limits myeloid cell growth through p21ras.,"Children with neurofibromatosis, type 1 (NF-1) are at increased risk of developing malignant myeloid disorders and their bone marrows frequently show loss of the normal allele of the NF1 tumor-suppressor gene. NF1 encodes a protein called neurofibromin, which accelerates guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis on the p21ras (Ras) family of signaling proteins. We used a genetic approach to test the hypothesis that NF1 negatively regulates myeloid cell growth through its effect on Ras. This model predicts that, if RAS mutations and loss of NF1 function deregulate myeloid growth by the same biomechanical mechanism, then activating RAS mutations will be restricted to children with malignant myeloid disorders who do not have NF-1. We studied 71 children, including 28 with bone marrow monosomy 7 syndrome (Mo7), 35with juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia (JCML), three with other forms of preleukemia, and five with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), for activating mutations of KRAS and NRAS. The incidence of RAS mutations was 21% (12 of 55) in patients without NF-1 and 0% (zero of 16) in children with NF-1 (P = .04). Among the 55 patients who did not have NF-1, we found RAS mutations in four of 27 with Mo 7, in five of 24 with JCML, in two of 3 with AML, and in a patient with myeloproliferative syndrome (MPS). These data from primary human cancer cells provide strong genetic evidence that NF1 limits the growth of myeloid cells by regulating Ras.",,R Kalra; D C Paderanga; K Olson; K M Shannon,Blood,1994-11-15,,abstract_only,False
PMID:38136356,Drug Responses in Plexiform Neurofibroma Type I (PNF1) Cell Lines Using High-Throughput Data and Combined Effectiveness and Potency.,,"2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Cell Lines, Data Access, and Extraction  To assess our analysis algorithm and identify promising targets, we analyzed an HTS dataset produced by Ferrer et al. [ 15 ], which reported pharmacologic and genomic profiling of plexiform neurofibroma-derived Schwann cells from NF1 patients and control nerve cells. Proliferation assays were used to screen a panel of 1912 small molecules (the MIPE 4.0 library [ 17 ]) against immortalized  NF1 −/−,  NF1 +/−, and  NF1 +/+ cell lines [ 16 ], with the fluorescence intensity indicating survival and proliferation after treatment. Primary files [ 15 ] were accessed from Single Agent Screens through Synapse  https://doi.org/10.7303/syn4939906  (accessed on 1 May 2023). Access was provided by the Children’s Tumor Foundation through their 2022 Hack4NF project. The following data were extracted from primary files: cell line name, drug name and target, log AC50 (LAC50, i.e., the log of the active concentration for a half-maximal response in molar concentration), R2 (R 2 , goodness of fit for the 4-parameter logistic regression model) values of dose–response curves, AUC (TAUC, total area under the curve), the asymptote minimum (“INF”, response extrapolated to infinite concentration), and the asymptote maximum (“ZERO”, response extrapolated to zero concentration). Separately, response data (dat0–dat10) and concentration (C0–C10, in μM) were downloaded and analyzed using a 4-parameter fit in SigmaPlot and with the DREA web tool (see  Supplemental Materials ). The DREA web tool recreates our final compound rankings using the application’s default filters, based on the data files from Ferrer et al. [ 15 ]. 2.2. Data Analysis 2.2.1. AC50 (Potency) and Relative Potency The log AC50 values (in M) were converted to AC50 (in μM), which is a commonly used potency measure. The relative potency (∆pAC50) of a compound exposed to two cell lines is defined in Equations (1) and (2). For the data presented in the Results section, the reference ( ref ) cell line was ipnNF95.11C (note that other reference lines can be selected—see our discussion on multiple controls) and the test ( test ) was one of the PNF1 cell lines. Generally, ∆AC50 > 0 indicates that the test cell lines were more sensitive to a compound than the reference cell line.

As described above, the reference cell line was ipnNF95.11C and the test was one of the PNF1 cell lines. 2.2.2. The   and  S  Indices ΔS We establish an algorithm for creating a single value score  , which compares the relative effect of a given compound between a test cell line and a reference cell line. This is, in turn, generated from  ΔS , which incorporates both AC50 (potency) and the effectiveness into a single value for a single compound in a single cell line. Equation (3) defines effectiveness (EFF) from concentration–response curves and is calculated as the response asymptote at the maximum dose concentration (ASM S Max ) minus the response asymptote at the minimum dose concentration (ASM Min ). These two values (EFF and AC50) were incorporated into a single value  , reflecting both effectiveness and potency (Equation (4)) and, therefore, the overall response for a single compound in a single cell line. The relative value  S  assesses change in  ΔS  from a reference cell line ( S S ref )  to   from a test cell line ( S ); that is to say ( S test  −  S ref ) (Equation (5)).

The test response is normalized, relative to the reference. Note that the magnitude of  ΔS  depends on the units of response and concentration, but  S  is a unitless quantity. This approach is analogous to that described by others and used in receptor pharmacology [ ΔS 10 , 14 , 18 ].  The   score was used to monitor the relative effects of compounds across cell lines and monitor the effects of several compounds in a single cell line. When the compound resulted in a higher  ΔS  in the reference cell line than in the test cell line, the test cell line was considered resistant to the compound.
 ΔS (6) D r u g   r e s i s t a n t ,   Δ S = S r e f − S t e s t   > 0 When the compound gave a lower   in the reference cell line than in the test cell line, the test cell line was considered sensitive to the compound.
 ΔS (7) D r u g   s e n s i t i v e ,   Δ S = S r e f − S t e s t < 0 Since the tumor cell lines could have different drug sensitivities and harbor mutations that impact different intracellular signaling pathways and processes, we ranked compounds with   for individual cell lines. Then a consolidated evaluation of cell lines was established as the  ΔS , which is a simple mean of the  ΔS mean  values for a compound across the PNF1 cell lines. ΔS 2.2.3. Prioritization To further prioritize compounds for a more in-depth follow-up, we selected compounds that generated concentration–response curves with an average R 2  of at least 0.8 in all four test cell lines. R 2  values from the reference cell line were similarly set to at least 0.8, and compounds that did not meet this threshold were excluded from the prioritized list, except for cases where there was no concentration–response. For the compounds meeting prioritization criteria, the   and  ΔS mean  variance of the mean were calculated. Compounds displaying drug resistance ( ΔS  > 0.5) or drug sensitivity ( ΔS mean  < −0.5) were considered potentially biologically meaningful, as they would represent approximately a 3-fold change on an arithmetic scale ( ΔS mean Figure 1 ). An additional threshold of 0.3 was set for the lower boundary of variance of the mean to ensure that the mean values were at least non-inferior to a null response. Non-inferiority can be shown if the difference between the two treatments does not cross a predefined inferiority margin. A threshold of 0.3 would represent approximately a 2-fold difference in an arithmetic scale. 2.2.4. Reference Cell Line and Use of Alternate and Multiple Controls For our analysis, we primarily used the  NF1 +/− cell line ipnNF95.11C as our reference cell line and the  NF1 −/− plexiform neurofibroma cell lines (PNF1 cells) ipNF05.5-MX, ipNF06.2A, ipNF95.11b C/T, and ipNF95.6 as test lines. The reference ipnNF95.11C cell line is derived from the non-tumor peripheral nerve of an NF1 patient and was selected because individuals with NF1 syndrome have a constitutional heterozygosity for  NF1.  Neurofibromas often arise from cells with additional somatic mutations of  NF1  [ 14 ]. Ideal therapies would, therefore, target  NF1 −/− neurofibroma cells, but not background  NF1+ /− cells to yield maximum anti-tumor specificity. The dataset from Ferrer et. al. also included additional neurofibromin-competent cell lines, specifically human foreskin fibroblasts [HFF] and the Schwann cell lines ipNF02.3 2λ, ipNF02.8.   calculations using these other control lines can be investigated via the DREA web app. ΔS One way to adapt   to the comparison of multiple control or tumor cell lines involves selecting one of the control cell lines as the reference and using that reference to evaluate the other control cell lines versus tumor cell lines.  ΔS  could be determined using HFF, for example, as the reference for each control cell line and tumor cell line. The  ΔS  of the reference and tumor cell lines would be determined. Then, one can additionally derive the change in the  ΔS means  of the reference lines against the tumor cell lines ( ΔS means ). This approach can be used for a group of different control cell lines or similarly applied to replicates of a single control cell line and multiple tumor cell lines. See supplement  ΔΔS Figure S1  on   for an example.

PMID:40887659,RENOVO-NF1 accurately predicts NF1 missense variant pathogenicity.,"Identification of a pathogenic variant in NF1 is diagnostic for neurofibromatosis, but is often impossible at the moment of variant detection due to many factors including allelic heterogeneity, sequence homology, and the lack of functional assays. Computational tools may aid in interpretation but are not established for NF1. Here, we optimized our random forest-based predictor RENOVO for NF1 variant interpretation. RENOVO was developed using an approach of ""database archaeology"": by comparing versions of ClinVar over the years, we defined ""stable"" variants that maintained the same pathogenic/likely pathogenic/benign/likely benign (P/LP/B/LB) classification over time (n = 3579, the training set), and ""unstable"" variants that were initially classified as Variants of Unknown Significance (VUS) but were subsequently reclassified as P/LP/B/LB (n = 57, the test set). This approach allows to retrospectively measure accuracy on prediction with insufficient information, reproducing the scenario of maximal clinical utility. We further validated performance on: (i) validation set 1: 100 NF1 variants classified as VUS at the time of RENOVO development and subsequently reclassified as P/LP/B/LB in ClinVar; (ii) validation set 2: 15 de novo variants discovered in a prospective clinical cohort and subsequently reclassified per ACMG criteria. RENOVO obtained consistently high accuracy on all datasets: 98.6% on the training test, 96.5% in the test set, 82% in validation set 1 (but 96.2% for missense variants) and 93.7% on validation set 2. In conclusion, RENOVO-NF1 accurately interprets NF1 variants for which information at the time of detection is insufficient for ACMG classification and may overcome diagnostic challenges in neurofibromatosis.","Methods Data availability All data produced in the present work are contained in the manuscript Databases ClinVar data for NF1 variants were extracted from the ClinVar version 2024-07-03 available at:  https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/clinvar/vcf_GRCh37/archive_2.0/2024/clinvar_20240307.vcf.gz NF1-training, -test and -validation 1 datasets were derived from the training, test and validation databases described in the RENOVO repository [ 1 ,  4 ] at  https://github.com/mazzalab-ieo/renovo  by filtering for mutations with a genomic position overlapping the NF1 locus (chr17:29,421,995-29,704,693, ref. build hg19) (supplementary Table 1).  Validation set 2 includes 25 NF1 variants identified de novo in a prospective cohort of patients at the IRCSS C. Besta Neurological Institute, by searching the institutional electronic database (supplementary Table 2). Description of ACMG-based classification Pathogenic status of variants identified was classified according to recommendations reported in Table 3 and 4 of ACMG guidelines [ 9 ]. For example, evidence of strong pathogenicity was ascribed to null variants including nonsense, frameshift, canonical ± 1 or ± 2 splice sites, initiation codon, single or multiexon deletion; while strong evidence of benign impact when allele impact was above 5% in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes, or ExAC, well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies shows no damaging effect on protein function or splicing, the variant was observed in a healthy individual. Methodology for RNA/DNA sequencing Constitutional NF1 variants were determined by standard techniques using targeted NGS panel including  NF1 ,  NF2 ,  SPRED1 ,  SMARCB1  and  LZTR1  genes on Ion Torrent and Sanger sequencing. Together with NGS, MLPA method was performed to rule out large deletions/duplications in NF1 gene; we validated the MLPA/NGS approach using Sanger sequencing on DNA or RNA of both positive and negative samples. The effects on genes and proteins of the variants identified were predicted based on the Mutation Taster ( http://www.mutationtaster.org ) and HGMD (Human Genome Mutation Database—Institute of Medical Genetics, Cardiff, Wales, UK;  http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ac/index.php  and LOVD. (Leiden Open Variation Database;  http://www.LOVD.nl.NF1 ). Novel variants with amino acid changes were further examined for their disease causing. potential using PolyPhen-2 ( http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/bgi.shtml ); The possible effects on mRNA (canonical and noncanonical splicing mutations) were evaluated with splice site prediction conducted by a neural network( http://www.fruitfly.org/seq_tools/splice.html ) and with the Human Splicing Finder (HSF;  http://www.umd.be/HSF/ ) and the ESE Finder ( http://rulai.cshl.edu/cgibin/tools/ESE3/esefinder.cgi?process=home ) tools. To investigate the significance of variants classified as “uncertain” in the ClinVar database ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar ), we performed a segregation analysis of the familial NF1 variants and predicted the functional consequence of missense variants using ANNOVAR which included prediction scores from 20 prediction algorithms (SIFT, SIFT4G, Polyphen2-HDIV, Polyphen2-HVAR, LRT, MutationTaster2, MutationAssessor, FATHMM, MetaSVM, MetaLR, PROVEAN, FATHMM-MKL coding, FATHMM-XF coding, fitCons, M-CAP, PrimateAI, DEOGEN2, BayesDel no AF, BayesDel add AF, ClinPred, and LIST-S2). In order to assess the frequencies of the variants in the general population, the GnomAD v.2.1.1 ( https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org ) and 1000 genomes ( https://www.internationalgenome.org , release 2015 aug) databases were used. 15 variants were classified as P/LP/B/LB according to ACMG criteria. For variants that remained VUS, the LOVD database was consulted on 20 Jan 2025, leading to the identification of 1 variant that had been re-classified in LOVD as P/LP/B/LB. The union of ACMG- and LOVD- reclassified sets led to the validation set 2. The variants and associated parameters are described in supplementary Table 1. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Threshold optimization All analyses were conducted in R version 4.3.1. For threshold optimization, we used cutpointR version 1.1.2, maximizing the “accuracy” metric for: i) class “1” variants, corresponding to ClinVar “Pathogenic”, “Pathogenic/Likely_pathogenic” and “Likely_pathogenic” and ii) class “0” variants, corresponding to “Benign”, “Benign/Likely_bening” and “Likely_bening”. To enhance readability, we combined the ClinVar pathogenic and benign classes into two main categories: “Pathogenic”, “Pathogenic/Likely_pathogenic”, and “Likely_pathogenic” were labeled as “P”, while “Benign”, “Benign/Likely_benign”, and “Likely_benign” were labeled as “B”. Variants with a PLS higher than or equal to 0.6465 were defined as RENOVO-NF1 pathogenic (RNF1-P); variants with a PLS lower than 0.4278 were defined as RENOVO-NF1 benign (RNF1-B); variants with a PLS intermediate between the 2 cutoff points were considered as RENOVO-NF1 uncertain (RNF1-U). We considered the following definitions for true/false positive/negative: a RNF1-P variant that was classified as P/LP in ClinVar 2024→true positive a RNF1-B variant that was classified as B/LB in ClinVar 2024→true negative a RNF1-P variant that was classified as B/LB in ClinVar 2024→false positive a RNF1-B variant that was classified as P/LP in ClinVar 2024→false negative RNF1-U variant that was classified as P/LP→false negative RNF1-U variant that was classified as B/LB→false negative Methodology for RNA/DNA sequencing Constitutional NF1 variants were determined by standard techniques using targeted NGS panel including  NF1 ,  NF2 ,  SPRED1 ,  SMARCB1  and  LZTR1  genes on Ion Torrent and Sanger sequencing.

PMID:29440379,Targeting the cMET pathway augments radiation response without adverse effect on hearing in NF2 schwannoma models.,"Neurofibromatosis type II (NF2) is a disease that needs new solutions. Vestibular schwannoma (VS) growth causes progressive hearing loss, and the standard treatment, including surgery and radiotherapy, can further damage the nerve. There is an urgent need to identify an adjunct therapy that, by enhancing the efficacy of radiation, can help lower the radiation dose and preserve hearing. The mechanisms underlying deafness in NF2 are still unclear. One of the major limitations in studying tumor-induced hearing loss is the lack of mouse models that allow hearing testing. Here, we developed a cerebellopontine angle (CPA) schwannoma model that faithfully recapitulates the tumor-induced hearing loss. Using this model, we discovered that cMET blockade by crizotinib (CRZ) enhanced schwannoma radiosensitivity by enhancing DNA damage, and CRZ treatment combined with low-dose radiation was as effective as high-dose radiation. CRZ treatment had no adverse effect on hearing; however, it did not affect tumor-induced hearing loss, presumably because cMET blockade did not change tumor hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) levels. This cMET gene knockdown study independently confirmed the role of the cMET pathway in mediating the effect of CRZ. Furthermore, we evaluated the translational potential of cMET blockade in human schwannomas. We found that human NF2-associated and sporadic VSs showed significantly elevated HGF expression and cMET activation compared with normal nerves, which correlated with tumor growth and cyst formation. Using organoid brain slice culture, cMET blockade inhibited the growth of patient-derived schwannomas. Our findings provide the rationale and necessary data for the clinical translation of combined cMET blockade with radiation therapy in patients with NF2.",,Yingchao Zhao; Pinan Liu; Na Zhang; Jie Chen; Lukas D Landegger; Limeng Wu; Fu Zhao; Yanxia Zhao; Yanling Zhang; Jing Zhang; Takeshi Fujita; Anat Stemmer-Rachamimov; Gino B Ferraro; Hao Liu; Alona Muzikansky; Scott R Plotkin; Konstantina M Stankovic; Rakesh K Jain; Lei Xu,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2018-02-27,10.1073/pnas.1719966115,abstract_only,False
PMID:32839340,Brain-wide structural and functional disruption in mice with oligodendrocyte-specific ,Neurofibromin gene (,"Materials and Methods Ethics Statement. All animal procedures were conducted with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and in accordance with the NIH  Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals  ( 65 ). Animals. Inducible Plp- Cre  ( 66 ) and  Nf1 fl/+  ( 67 ) mice were maintained on a pure C57BL/6 background and genotyped by PCR according to publicly available protocols ( 22 ). Tamoxifen was administered to the animals at age 8 wk (see below). Twenty-nine animals participated in Rotarod evaluation (control,  n  = 14; Plp- Nf1 fl/+ ,  n  = 15), 19 animals in DTI (control,  n  = 9; Plp- Nf1 fl/+ ,  n  = 10), and 18 animals in rs-fMRI (control,  n  = 7; Plp- Nf1 fl/+ ,  n  = 11). Of the animals that participated in rs-fMRI, 13 animals participated in DTI (control,  n  = 6; Plp- Nf1 fl/+ ,  n  = 7), and 14 in the Rotarod test (control,  n  = 6; Plp- Nf1 fl/+ ,  n  = 8). Tamoxifen Injection. The injection protocol followed previous publications ( 21 ,  22 ). Tamoxifen (100 mg) was dissolved with 1 mL of ethanol and 9 mL of sunflower seed oil (Sigma-Aldrich). At age 8 wk, both controls and Plp- Nf1 fl/+  mice were intraperitoneally injected with tamoxifen (100 µL) twice daily for 3 d at the same time of day. L-NAME Injection. Fresh solution of L-NAME (L-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester, 100 µM in 1× PBS; Sigma-Aldrich) was administered daily at 0.4 mg/kg ( 21 ). Animal Surgery. Before any experiment, to use our in-house designed cradle, we implanted headposts on the animals’ skulls as described previously ( 34 ). In brief, the mice were anesthetized with isoflurane mixed with oxygen, which was kept at a level of 2% to 3% for the entire procedure. The skin was removed, and 3D-printed plastic headposts were positioned on the skulls and affixed with dental cement (C&B Metabond; Parkell). To prevent image distortions in MRI acquisition resulting from uneven surfaces, the cement was smoothed using a self-cured resin (general purpose acrylic resin; Unifast Trad). The animals were then left to recover and injected once with antibiotics (cefalexin 0.18 mg/10 g; Norbrook) along with systemic and local analgesics (buprenorphine 0.9 µg/10 g and bupavacaine 0.075 mg/10 g, respectively). Each animal was carefully monitored over the next week before entering the experiment. Rotating Rod Performance Test. Gross motor coordination function was evaluated using the Rotarod (Med Associates). Twenty-nine animals (controls,  n  = 14; Plp- Nf1 fl/+ ,  n  = 15) underwent one training session and one test session, each consisting of four runs. Every run lasted for 6 min, in which the rod accelerated gradually from 4 to 40 revolutions per minute in the first 5 min and maintained at the final speed for the last minute. Time to fall and peak speed were recorded. MRI Acquisition. Imaging was performed with a 9.4-T BioSpec 94/20 USR MRI (Bruker BioSpin MRI). A 20-mm receive-only coil was fixed to the cradle over the animal’s head, and the entire apparatus was inserted into the MRI bore containing an 86-mm quadrature transmit-only coil (Bruker BioSpin MRI). DTI Acquisition. To characterize structural connectivity, we scanned 19 animals using DTI (control,  n  = 9; Plp- Nf1 fl/+ ,  n  = 10); one control was excluded due to extensive image distortions. Animals were first lightly sedated and fixed to the resting-state cradle with a custom-made mask placed over the nose, which allowed maintenance of anesthesia throughout the DTI scanning session while their respiratory rate was monitored. Data acquisition was performed using a diffusion-weighted spin-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) pulse sequence (repetition time [TR], 7,000 ms; echo time [TE], 21.68 ms). We used 30 noncolinear diffusion directions, a b factor  of 1,000 s/mm 3  with 11 ms duration of the diffusion gradient (δ) and a separation time (Δ) of 2.6 ms. The scan consisted of 24 slices of 400 µm thickness, with an acquisition matrix of 100 × 100 voxels and a field of view of 16 × 16 cm 2 , resulting in a resolution of 0.1 × 0.1 × 0.4 mm 3 . DTI Preprocessing and Analysis. Diffusion-weighted images were preprocessed using ExplorDTI ( 68 ), with tensors calculated using a robust estimation algorithm ( 69 ), together with motion and eddy current correction. FA and B 0  maps were exported to the NIfTI format. Brain extraction was performed, and a template, B 0 , for both controls and Plp- Nf1 fl/+  animals was created using Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) ( 70 ). The control template was registered to the Allen Brain Atlas ( 71 ), while the Plp- Nf1 fl/+  was linearly coregistered to the controls. A final diffeomorphic field from native space to the Allen Brain Atlas space for each animal was calculated and applied in a single step to native scans to prevent data degradation. Normalized FA maps were submitted to a two-sample Student’s  t  test between controls and Plp- Nf1 fl/+  animals. For ROI analysis, we defined the regions manually based on the  t  test results comparing genotypes before L-NAME and calculated the mean voxel intensity within each region to assess rescue after treatment ( 72 ). rs-fMRI Acquisition. Eighteen animals were included in the awake resting-state fMRI experiment (control,  n  = 7; Plp- Nf1 fl/+ ,  n  = 11) which followed a previously published protocol ( 34 ). To reduce stress, the animals were lightly sedated and fixed to the resting-state cradle. During the 5-d acclimatization period, each animal was placed in the MRI machine and exposed to the different scanning protocols used, while the period of head restraint was increased gradually from 2 to 50 min by the last acclimatization session. Afterward, each animal was scanned before and after the administration of L-NAME for six or seven daily sessions of rs-fMRI at each time period. Each scanning session included structural and functional scanning. The structural scan was acquired using a T1-weighted rapid acquisition process with relaxation enhancement (RARE) sequence in coronal orientation (30 coronal slices; TE, 8.5 ms; RARE factor, 4; flip angle, 180°; in-plane resolution, 150 × 150 μm 2 ; slice thickness, 450 μm). Whole-brain functional scans consisted of 800 repetitions divided over four runs (200 repetitions per run). BOLD imaging was achieved using spin echo-echo planar imaging (SE-EPI) sequence (TR, 2.5 s; TE, 18.398 ms; flip angle, 90°; 30 coronal slices; in-plane resolution, 150 × 150 μm 2 ; slice thickness, 450 μm; the imaged volume was framed with four saturation slices to avoid wraparound artifacts). rs-fMRI Preprocessing and Analysis. The preprocessing steps have been reported previously ( 34 ,  73 ). In brief, the first two frames were skipped to eliminate inhomogeneity artifacts and the remaining frames were slice time corrected. To perform motion correction, the whole time series was corrected to the average of the first 200 repetitions using rigid-body correction ( 74 ) by calculating a coregistration matrix for each volume. The same averaged volume was then warped automatically, using symmetric diffeomorphic image normalization (SyN) with ANTs ( 75 ), to a predefined EPI template that was preregistered with the Allen Brain Atlas. To prevent degradation of image quality, the final displacement field for each volume, including its motion correction displacement matrix, was calculated and applied on each time-corrected volume. Whole-brain and ventricle masks were calculated automatically. Data-scrubbing procedures were as described previously ( 34 ,  76 ), with similar exclusion criteria: frame displacement threshold of 50 µm, temporal derivative mean square root area threshold of 150% the interquartile range above the 75th percentile with exclusion of one frame after the detected motion. Runs with fewer than 50 frames and sessions with fewer than 300 frames were excluded; 29 out of 208 sessions were excluded due to excessive movement or image distortion (control,  n  = 11; Plp- Nf1 fl/+ ,  n  = 18). After data scrubbing, the time series underwent demeaning and detrending to remove global mean and nonintrinsic trends, together with regressing out mean ventricles and vascular signals, and six volume-specific motion parameters and their derivatives were regressed out of the signal to remove sources of spurious or regionally nonspecific variance ( 77 ). Finally, bandpass filtering (0.009 to 0.08 Hz) and smoothing using convolution with a Gaussian function (FWHM of 0.6 mm) were applied. To estimate functional connectivity maps, we placed an ROI with a 100-µm radius and extracted the time course from each seed. A seed-to-whole brain correlation map was calculated during each session and averaged to produce a mean Fisher’s  Z  transform,  Z ( r ), map for that animal. Finally, all the animal-based maps were averaged to produce one map for each genotype, which were displayed on a template registered to the Allen Brain Atlas ( 78 ). Seed-to-seed analysis was performed by calculating Pearson’s correlation coefficient between two seeds and transforming it using Fisher’s  Z  transform to allow for cross-subject comparison.",Jad Asleh; Ben Shofty; Nadav Cohen; Alexandra Kavushansky; Alejandro López-Juárez; Shlomi Constantini; Nancy Ratner; Itamar Kahn,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2020-09-08,10.1073/pnas.2008391117,minimal,True
PMID:24414536,mTORC1 inhibition delays growth of neurofibromatosis type 2 schwannoma.,"BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder, resulting in a variety of neural tumors, with bilateral vestibular schwannomas as the most frequent manifestation. Recently, merlin, the NF2 tumor suppressor, has been identified as a novel negative regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1); functional loss of merlin was shown to result in elevated mTORC1 signaling in NF2-related tumors. Thus, mTORC1 pathway inhibition may be a useful targeted therapeutic approach. METHODS: We studied in vitro cell models, cohorts of mice allografted with Nf2(-/-) Schwann cells, and a genetically modified mouse model of NF2 schwannoma in order to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed targeted therapy for NF2. RESULTS: We found that treatment with the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin reduced the severity of NF2-related Schwann cell tumorigenesis without significant toxicity. Consistent with these results, in an NF2 patient with growing vestibular schwannomas, the rapalog sirolimus induced tumor growth arrest. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results constitute definitive evidence that justifies proceeding with clinical trials using mTORC1-targeted agents in selected patients with NF2 and in patients with NF2-related sporadic tumors.",,Marco Giovannini; Nicolas-Xavier Bonne; Jeremie Vitte; Fabrice Chareyre; Karo Tanaka; Rocky Adams; Laurel M Fisher; Laurence Valeyrie-Allanore; Pierre Wolkenstein; Stephane Goutagny; Michel Kalamarides,Neuro-oncology,2014-04,10.1093/neuonc/not242,abstract_only,False

Murine mesothelioma closely mimicked human malignant mesothelioma. Conditional Nf2;Ink4a/Arf mice showed increased pleural invasion compared to conditional Nf2;p53 mice.

PMID:35735230,Centralizing neurofibromatosis experimental tool knowledge with the NF Research Tools Database.,"Experimental tools and resources, such as animal models, cell lines, antibodies, genetic reagents and biobanks, are key ingredients in biomedical research. Investigators face multiple challenges when trying to understand the availability, applicability and accessibility of these tools. A major challenge is keeping up with current information about the numerous tools available for a particular research problem. A variety of disease-agnostic projects such as the Mouse Genome Informatics database and the Resource Identification Initiative curate a number of types of research tools. Here, we describe our efforts to build upon these resources to develop a disease-specific research tool resource for the neurofibromatosis (NF) research community. This resource, the NF Research Tools Database, is an open-access database that enables the exploration and discovery of information about NF type 1-relevant animal models, cell lines, antibodies, genetic reagents and biobanks. Users can search and explore tools, obtain detailed information about each tool as well as read and contribute their observations about the performance, reliability and characteristics of tools in the database. NF researchers will be able to use the NF Research Tools Database to promote, discover, share, reuse and characterize research tools, with the goal of advancing NF research. Database URL: https://tools.nf.synapse.org/.","Materials and Methods Initial user story development The concept for this database was inspired by informal conversations with members of the NF1 research community, and an initial proof of concept database was created using a sampling of research tools. Building on this initial database, anecdotal evidence from community discussions and internal brainstorming from experience in NF1 research, we developed a set of user stories ( Supplementary Table S1 ), for example, ‘as a clinician-scientist, I want to find out what NF1, NF2, SPRED1, TP53 or SUZ12 mutations a disease model has so that I know if the model has the genetic mutation profile that I am interested in studying’. We then prioritized the user stories and designed a database and web application for high-priority user stories. Data model development We designed a data model ( Figure 1 ) for the database by evaluating several sources of information for cell lines (Cellosaurus, ATCC), animal models (Mutant Mouse Resource & Research Centers, Mouse Genome Informatics), antibodies (Antibody Registry), genetic reagents (Addgene) and others (including SciCrunch, which aggregates information from several data sources). After selecting metadata attributes to collect for all tools as well as each specific type of tool, we constructed a relational data model for these attributes as well as other attributes that enable the inclusion of ‘observations’ for the tools, to be provided by database users. Figure 1. A data model diagram for the NF Research Tools Database. Each box describes one of the database tables, with lines representing the relationships/connections between each table. Links between tables are the primary key (PK), which is a unique identifier for each row in the table, and the foreign key (FK), which is a PK found in another table. A machine-readable version of this data model is available on GitHub (see the ‘Database development’ section). Database development We constructed a JSON-LD schema from the data model to make it machine-readable (version 2.0.0 at the time of writing, available from  https://github.com/nf-osi/nf-research-tools-schema ). This schema was processed with the ‘schematic’ Python library ( 11 ,  12 ) to generate a MySQL database as well as data intake spreadsheets. Data were manually curated by searching for NF1-relevant tools on Scicrunch.org, Cellosaurus, Antibody Registry, Addgene, Mouse Genome Informatics and the Jackson Laboratories websites; this information was used to populate the data intake spreadsheets, which were then added to the MySQL database using schematic. The MySQL database is currently hosted in a private cloud computing environment, but all database tables and a variety of ‘joined’ tables are available for anyone to access on the Synapse collaborative science platform ( www.doi.org/10.7303/syn26338068 ). The database tables can be retrieved and queried using SQL-like syntax in the Synapse web, Python, or R clients; please see the Synapse documentation ( https://help.synapse.org ) for more guidance on using these clients. Web application The web application was designed using the aforementioned user stories. We conducted internal design tests and solicited feedback from others at our organizations to improve the design. We then built the application using the React JavaScript library and the Synapse React Client ( 13 ).",Ashley Clayton; Mialy DeFelice; Brynn Zalmanek; Jay Hodgson; Caroline Morin; Stockard Simon; Julie A Bletz; James A Eddy; Milen Nikolov; Jineta Banerjee; Kalyan Vinnakota; Marco Marasca; Kevin J Boske; Bruce Hoff; Ljubomir Bradic; YooRi Kim; James R Goss; Robert J Allaway,Database : the journal of biological databases and curation,2022-06-23,10.1093/database/baac045,minimal,True
PMID:25113746,A murine model of neurofibromatosis type 2 that accurately phenocopies human schwannoma formation.,"Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder resulting from germline mutations in the NF2 gene. Bilateral vestibular schwannomas, tumors on cranial nerve VIII, are pathognomonic for NF2 disease. Furthermore, schwannomas also commonly develop in other cranial nerves, dorsal root ganglia and peripheral nerves. These tumors are a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and medical therapies to treat them are limited. Animal models that accurately recapitulate the full anatomical spectrum of human NF2-related schwannomas, including the characteristic functional deficits in hearing and balance associated with cranial nerve VIII tumors, would allow systematic evaluation of experimental therapeutics prior to clinical use. Here, we present a genetically engineered NF2 mouse model generated through excision of the Nf2 gene driven by Cre expression under control of a tissue-restricted 3.9kbPeriostin promoter element. By 10 months of age, 100% of Postn-Cre; Nf2(flox/flox) mice develop spinal, peripheral and cranial nerve tumors histologically identical to human schwannomas. In addition, the development of cranial nerve VIII tumors correlates with functional impairments in hearing and balance, as measured by auditory brainstem response and vestibular testing. Overall, the Postn-Cre; Nf2(flox/flox) tumor model provides a novel tool for future mechanistic and therapeutic studies of NF2-associated schwannomas.",,Jeffrey R Gehlhausen; Su-Jung Park; Ann E Hickox; Matthew Shew; Karl Staser; Steven D Rhodes; Keshav Menon; Jacquelyn D Lajiness; Muithi Mwanthi; Xianlin Yang; Jin Yuan; Paul Territo; Gary Hutchins; Grzegorz Nalepa; Feng-Chun Yang; Simon J Conway; Michael G Heinz; Anat Stemmer-Rachamimov; Charles W Yates; D Wade Clapp,Human molecular genetics,2015-01-01,10.1093/hmg/ddu414,abstract_only,False
PMID:17090653,Beta common receptor inactivation attenuates myeloproliferative disease in Nf1 mutant mice.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) syndrome is caused by germline mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor, which encodes neurofibromin, a GTPase activating protein for Ras. Children with NF1 are predisposed to juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) and lethally irradiated mice given transplants with homozygous Nf1 mutant (Nf1-/-) hematopoietic stem cells develop a fatal myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) that models JMML. We investigated the requirement for signaling through the GM-CSF receptor to initiate and sustain this MPD by generating Nf1 mutant hematopoietic cells lacking the common beta chain (Beta c) of the GM-CSF receptor. Mice reconstituted with Nf1-/-, beta c-/- stem cells did not develop evidence of MPD despite the presence of increased number of immature hematopoietic progenitors in the bone marrow. Interestingly, when the Mx1-Cre transgene was used to inactivate a conditional Nf1 mutant allele in hematopoietic cells, concomitant loss of beta c-/- reduced the severity of the MPD, but did not abrogate it. Whereas inhibiting GM-CSF signaling may be of therapeutic benefit in JMML, our data also demonstrate aberrant proliferation of Nf1-/-myeloid progenitors that is independent of signaling through the GM-CSF receptor.",,Andrew Kim; Kelly Morgan; Diane E Hasz; Stephen M Wiesner; Jennifer O Lauchle; Jennifer L Geurts; Miechaleen D Diers; Doan T Le; Scott C Kogan; Luis F Parada; Kevin Shannon; David A Largaespada,Blood,2007-02-15,10.1182/blood-2006-05-025395,abstract_only,False
PMID:7959746,DNA sequences in the promoter region of the NF1 gene are highly conserved between human and mouse.,"The gene for type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF1) is most highly expressed in brain and spinal cord, although low levels of mRNA can be found in nearly all tissues. As a first step in investigating the regulation of NF1 gene expression, we have cloned and sequenced the promoter regions of the human and mouse NF1 genes and mapped the transcriptional start sites in both species. We report here that the 5' ends of the human and murine NF1 genes are highly conserved. While no discernable TATA or CCAAT box sequences are seen, transcription initiates at identical sites in both species, 484 nucleotides upstream of the ATG initiation codon in the human gene. The human and mouse NF1 genes share particularly high sequence homology (95%) between nucleotides -33 and +261 and contain several perfectly conserved transcription factor binding site motifs, including a cAMP response element, several AP2 consensus binding sites, and a serum response element. The high conservation of these sequences indicates that they are likely to be significant in the regulation of NF1 gene expression.",,A Hajra; A Martin-Gallardo; S A Tarlé; M Freedman; S Wilson-Gunn; A Bernards; F S Collins,Genomics,1994-06,10.1006/geno.1994.1328,abstract_only,False
PMID:21855613,Genetically engineered mouse models shed new light on the pathogenesis of neurofibromatosis type I-related neoplasms of the peripheral nervous system.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), the most common genetic disorder affecting the human nervous system, is characterized by the development of multiple benign Schwann cell tumors in skin and large peripheral nerves. These neoplasms, which are termed dermal and plexiform neurofibromas respectively, have distinct clinical courses; of particular note, plexiform, but not dermal, neurofibromas often undergo malignant progression to form malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), the most common malignancy occurring in NF1 patients. In recent years, a number of genetically engineered mouse models have been created to investigate the molecular mechanisms driving the pathogenesis of these tumors. These models have been designed to address key questions including: (1) whether NF1 loss in the Schwann cell lineage is essential for tumorigenesis; (2) what cell type(s) in the Schwann cell lineage gives rise to dermal neurofibromas, plexiform neurofibromas and MPNSTs; (3) how the tumor microenvironment contributes to neoplasia; (4) what additional mutations contribute to neurofibroma-MPNST progression; (5) what role different neurofibromin-regulated Ras proteins play in this process and (6) how dysregulated growth factor signaling facilitates PNS tumorigenesis. In this review, we summarize the major findings from each of these models and their limitations as well as how discrepancies between these models may be reconciled. We also discuss how information gleaned from these models can be synthesized to into a comprehensive model of tumor formation in peripheral nervous system and consider several of the major questions that remain unanswered about this process.",,Nicole M Brossier; Steven L Carroll,Brain research bulletin,2012-05-01,10.1016/j.brainresbull.2011.08.005,abstract_only,False
PMID:30192842,Use of machine learning to predict cognitive performance based on brain metabolism in Neurofibromatosis type 1.,"Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) can cause a wide range of cognitive deficits, but its underlying nature is still unknown. We investigated the correlation between cognitive performance and specific patterns of resting-state brain metabolism in a NF1 sample. Sixteen individuals diagnosed with NF1 underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT brain imaging followed by a neuropsychological assessment. Principal component analysis was performed on 17 measures of cognitive function and a machine learning approach based on Gaussian Process Regression was used to individually predict the components that represented most of the variance in the neuropsychological data. The accuracy of the method was estimated using leave-one-out cross-validation and its significance through permutation testing. We found that only the first component could be accurately predicted from resting state metabolism (r = 0.926, p<0.001). Multiple and heterogeneous measures contribute to the first component, mainly WISC/WAIS Procedure and Verbal IQ, verbal memory and fluency. Considering the accurate prediction of measures of neuropsychological performance based on brain metabolism in NF1 patients, this suggests an underlying metabolic pattern that relates to cognitive performance in this group.","Subjects and methods Participants NF1 group In this study, a group of 16 individuals diagnosed with NF1 was investigated by a multidisciplinary assessment team at the Neurofibromatosis Outpatient Reference Center of Minas Gerais. The study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects have given written informed consent, and the study was approved by the Human Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), in Belo Horizonte, Brazil and is registered under the number CAAE-01344212.2.0000.5149. For minor patients, written consent was obtained from their parents or guardians. The diagnosis was performed using guidelines proposed by the NIH [ 1 ]. Participants’ age ranged from 8 to 44 years and length of formal education from 2 to 16 years. Socioeconomic status ranged from low to middle (median monthly household income between U$348 and U$1,190). The 16 patients were selected from a group of 41 patients who underwent whole-body 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging due to symptomatic plexiform neurofibromas (to establish the risk of malignant progression of the disease) [ 15 ]. Six patients were not included in this study for not having brain image data, three patients did not perform the cognitive tests, one patient was too young (4 years old) for the available neuropsychological tests, three patients were excluded due to artifacts in their brain images (most likely due to movement between the CT and the PET affecting the attenuation correction), and 12 had incomplete neuropsychological data. None of the patients had a history of brain tumor or presented current evidence of a brain tumor after visual assessment of the PET and CT images by an experienced nuclear medicine physician. There was no specific control for medication use. From those patients taking medications, only one (female, 36 years) reported use of a psychotropic drug (antidepressant). Control group A group of 16 non-psychiatric, non-neurologic, and non-oncologic individuals matched by age, education, and gender was voluntarily submitted to the neuropsychological evaluation and compared to the NF1 group. Exclusion criteria included history or current evidence of psychosis, autism, brain disorders, or any genetic or medical disorder associated with cognitive impairment. None of the controls reported previous or current use of psychotropic drugs. All controls gave written informed consent to participate in this study. Neuropsychological assessment Participants underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment to measure intelligence, attention/processing speed, visuospatial abilities, episodic memory, fine motor coordination, and executive functions. All instruments were adapted and validated for the Brazilian context. They can be used by children older than seven years and adults, as well as by subjects from different educational backgrounds. Intelligence —General intellectual functioning was assessed by the third version of the Brazilian Wechsler Intelligence Scales (WAIS-III for adults and WISC-III for children) verbal (VIQ), procedure (PIQ) and full-scale (IQ) intelligence quotients [ 16 , 17 ]. Fine Motor Coordination —The Nine-Hole Peg Test was performed as a measure of finger dexterity [ 18 ]. It measures the time (in seconds) needed to complete the test with the dominant and the non-dominant hands. Visuospatial Abilities —The Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test was implemented as a measure of the visuospatial cognitive domain [ 19 ]. Episodic Memory —We selected both verbal and non-verbal episodic memory tests since NF1 patients might show a discrepancy between these two functional aspects [ 5 ]. Immediate (A6) and delayed recalls (A7) of the Brazilian-Portuguese version of the Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) were taken as measures of verbal episodic memory [ 20 ]. Immediate (~3 minutes) and delayed (30 minutes) recalls of the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF) were adopted as non-verbal memory measures. Language —Assessment of this cognitive domain was performed by a Category Fluency Test (“animals”) [ 21 ], and by Lexical Fluency Test letters (F, A, and S) [ 22 ]. Attention/Processing Speed —The Five Digits Test (FDT) [ 23 ] is a numeric-Stroop paradigm designed to assess attentional processes. We adopted the first component of the test (FDT-Decoding), which involves reading/naming of numbers ranging from 1 to 5, as a measure of Automatic Attentional Processing and Processing speed [ 24 ]. The Inhibitory Control was investigated by the Inhibiting component of the Five Digits Test (FDT—Inhibiting), which involves inhibition of an automatic attentional routine in favor of a controlled one, demanding executive control. Executive Functions —For working memory evaluation, we used the Digit Span according to the WAIS-III or WISC-III, and the Corsi block-tapping task [ 25 ]. The product of the span length and the number of correctly remembered trials, both for the Corsi test and the Digit Span, were taken into account [ 26 ]. The Tower of London Test [ 27 ] was used as a measure of Planning Skills. The neuropsychological examinations were conducted between February 2012 and October 2013 and took place no longer than one month after the brain image acquisition. Demographic and neuropsychological data analysis We analyzed differences in the neuropsychological performance between the NF1 group and the control group. Descriptive statistics were generated for gender, age, education, socioeconomic level, and neuropsychological data. The Student  t -test was carried out to investigate group differences in continuous variables, and the Chi-square test was used to assess differences in frequency of dichotomous variables (i.e., gender). Effect sizes of observed differences were also calculated (Cohen’s  d ). Measures from the Nine-Hole Peg Test (dominant and non-dominant hands) were not originally normally distributed, thus scores were normalized through a log transformation. Image acquisition Resting-state 18F-FDG PET/CT brain images were acquired in a GE Discovery 690 (GE Healthcare, Millwalke, EUA) scanner as part of a whole-body scan. Patients had at least six hours of fasting before the exam. After an intravenous bolus injection of 5.18 MBq/kg of 18F-FDG, patients rested for 50 minutes in a quiet and dark room, with minimum stimuli. PET brain images were acquired subsequently, as a separate volume from the rest of the body, with a total acquisition time of 10 minutes, and reconstructed in a 192x192x47 matrix using the OSEM (Ordered Subsets Expectation Maximization) algorithm, with 2 iterations and 20 subsets. Attenuation correction was performed using the CT image. Image processing PET images were spatially processed using the Statistical Parametric Mapping toolbox (SPM8, Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, 2008) implemented within Matlab 7.12.0 (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). Initially, a gross manual image reorientation and approximate definition of the image center point was applied. All images were then spatially normalized onto a 18F-FDG PET template in MNI space [ 28 ] and smoothed by a 12 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel, yielding a 91x109x91 volume per subject. To increase processing speed, this image was then downsampled to a 45x54x45 volume by averaging the values of 4 adjacent voxel. This was a necessary step for permutation testing during image analysis and in our tests didn’t significantly impact prediction accuracy. SPM’s brain mask was used to segment the brain from this volume, resulting in the selection of 33 570 voxels. Finally, these brain voxels were scaled by their global mean to account for differences in global signal between subjects [ 29 ]. The information extracted from each 18F-FDG PET scan is a single 33 570 × 1 data vector that “summarizes” each patient’s brain metabolism. Image data analysis Our image data analysis involved investigating the correlation between neuropsychological variables and brain metabolism in NF1 patients. The traditional method to do this analysis would be by using the General Linear Model [ 30 ] to evaluate voxel-by-voxel whether the metabolism at a certain location could be well reconstructed by a combination of several regressors, including nuisance factors. In recent years though, machine learning (ML) has emerged as an alternative approach to standard neuroimaging analysis [ 31 – 33 ]. There are two important differences between ML and traditional mass-univariate statistics. First, the primary focus of ML is to make predictions, rather than explain how independent variables affect a certain outcome. Secondly, ML is a multivariate approach at the single subject level, i.e. predictions are made based on the distributed pattern of effects across the whole brain [ 34 ]. This is particularly useful when dealing with a high number of predictor variables (in our case, more than 33 thousand), especially where the variables are correlated, and there are many complex interactions between them. Simply put, ML works by “learning” from training data to create a model that maps an input (e.g. set of PET images) to an output (e.g. clinical data). The primary outcome measure of ML is how well this model generalizes to new data. To assess this, the ML algorithm can be iteratively trained on a subset of the data and then tested on the remaining “unseen” data (cross-validation). This strategy also avoids overfitting, which occurs when a model starts “memorizing” training data rather than “learning” to generalize from a trend. Different machine learning algorithms would be suited to solve our regression problem [ 35 ]. We opted to use Gaussian Processes (GP) because it provides a principled, practical and probabilistic approach to learning in kernel machines, with the advantage of automatic tuning of the kernel parameters from the training data via type-II maximum likelihood [ 36 ]. Furthermore, GP models have been successfully applied to neuroimaging, in various clinical settings, including prediction of pain states, symptom severity, cognitive and disease states [ 37 – 41 ]. A GP is a generalization of a Gaussian (normal) probability distribution (which describes a finite-dimensional random variable) to functions. Thus, it extends multivariate Gaussian distributions to infinite dimensionality. By using GP as a prior distribution over the functional feature space, it is possible to use Bayesian inference to predict clinical outcomes or disease status [ 36 ]. For our analysis, we used the Gaussian Process regression (GPR) implementation available within  kernlab  R library [ 42 , 43 ]. “Vanilladot” was the linear kernel function selected, and the initial noise variance and tolerance of termination criteria were both set to 0.001. Before performing the GPR analysis, two issues had to be addressed regarding the PET and neuropsychological data. Firstly, patients presented a considerable variation in age and since it is known that age influences global and regional brain metabolism [ 44 , 45 ], voxel values were processed to reduce the effect of age. This was done by applying a voxelwise linear regression and then performing GPR on the residuals. Secondly, since many of the 17 neuropsychological tests overlap in the cognitive processes they measure, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) in R to select the components that explained most of the variance in the data. For this, neuropsychological data was centered and scaled, and R’s  prcomp  function was used to extract the principal components. GPR was then performed on these components. Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) was used to access the method’s accuracy. The algorithm was first trained on  n-1  subjects using the imaging data and the values of the selected principal component, and then predicted the value of the removed subject using only the image. This process was repeated  n  times so that prediction was performed for each subject. Predicted values were plotted against observed ones, and the Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated. To estimate the significance of the correlation, the LOOCV was repeated a thousand times with permutation of the input values [ 46 ]. Weight maps containing the most relevant voxels for prediction were produced for principal components with a significant correlation between predicted and observed values. These weight maps contain the average weight of each feature during the LOOCV.",Manuel Schütze; Danielle de Souza Costa; Jonas Jardim de Paula; Leandro Fernandes Malloy-Diniz; Carlos Malamut; Marcelo Mamede; Débora Marques de Miranda; Michael Brammer; Marco Aurélio Romano-Silva,PloS one,2018,10.1371/journal.pone.0203520,minimal,True

PMID:32098059,Integrative Analysis Identifies Candidate Tumor Microenvironment and Intracellular Signaling Pathways that Define Tumor Heterogeneity in NF1.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a monogenic syndrome that gives rise to numerous symptoms including cognitive impairment, skeletal abnormalities, and growth of benign nerve sheath tumors. Nearly all NF1 patients develop cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs), which occur on the skin surface, whereas 40-60% of patients develop plexiform neurofibromas (pNFs), which are deeply embedded in the peripheral nerves. Patients with pNFs have a ~10% lifetime chance of these tumors becoming malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). These tumors have a severe prognosis and few treatment options other than surgery. Given the lack of therapeutic options available to patients with these tumors, identification of druggable pathways or other key molecular features could aid ongoing therapeutic discovery studies. In this work, we used statistical and machine learning methods to analyze 77 NF1 tumors with genomic data to characterize key signaling pathways that distinguish these tumors and identify candidates for drug development. We identified subsets of latent gene expression variables that may be important in the identification and etiology of cNFs, pNFs, other neurofibromas, and MPNSTs. Furthermore, we characterized the association between these latent variables and genetic variants, immune deconvolution predictions, and protein activity predictions.","2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Materials Implementation and Data and Code Availability All analyses were performed using the R programming language. A comprehensive list of packages used and their versions are available in an  renv  lockfile in the GitHub repository. Key packages used include “tidyverse” [ 33 ], “PLIER” [ 26 ], “synapser” [ 34 ], “tximport” [ 35 ], “immundeconv” [ 35 ], and “viper” [ 32 ]. All data analyzed in this article are stored on the NF Data Portal [ 24 ] ( http://nfdataportal.org ) with analyses stored at  http://synapse.org/nf1landscape . To recapitulate the analysis from these data, all relevant code can be found at  https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/NF_LandscapePaper_2019 .  2.2. Sequencing Data Collection and Processing Gene expression data were collected from four independent studies and processed via a workflow at  https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/rare-disease-workflows/tree/master/rna-seq-workflow  to be stored on the NF Data Portal ( Table 1 ). Specifically, raw fastq files were downloaded from Synapse and transcripts were quantified using the Salmon pseudo-alignment tool [ 36 ] with Gencode V29 transcriptome. Links to specific datasets and the access teams required to download them can be found using Synapse ID  syn21221980 .  Genomic variant data were collected from exome-Seq [ 37 ] or whole-genome sequencing [ 38 ]. Variant call format (VCF) files were processed using “vcf2maf” ( https://github.com/mskcc/vcf2maf ) according to the workflow located at  https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/rare-disease-workflows/tree/master/gene-variant-workflow  and then uploaded to the NF Data Portal. A list of datasets and the access teams required to download them can be found in  Table 2  or syn21266269.  2.3. Latent Variable Calculation and Selection We analyzed transcriptomic data from NF in the context of latent variables from MultiPLIER, a machine learning resource designed to aid in rare disease analyses [ 27 ]. Raw transcriptomic data from NF were retrieved from the NF Data Portal, reprocessed, and stored in Synapse as described above. Salmon output files (quant.sf) files were imported into an R session and converted to HUGO gene names using the “tximport” [ 35 ] and “org.Hs.eg.db” [ 40 ] packages. MultiPLIER reuses models that were trained on large public compendia. We retrieved a model [ 41 ] that was previously trained on the recount2 RNA-seq dataset [ 25 , 42 ] and then used it to assess the expression of latent variables in the pan-NF dataset. We retrieved code for this analysis from the public repository for MultiPLIER [ 27 ] ( https://github.com/greenelab/multi-plier ). To project the NF data into the MultiPLIER model, we used the GetNewDataB function. This analytical approach is described in more detail in a machine learning training module ( https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/training-modules ) produced by the Alex’s Lemonade Stand Foundation’s Childhood Cancer Data Lab under an open source license.  In addition, to ensure orthogonality in the final set of latent variables [ 43 ], we calculated the pairwise Pearson correlation of all latent variables by comparing the gene loadings ( Figure S1 ), and identified non-self-correlations greater than 0.5. We eliminated one of each of these highly intercorrelated (Pearson correlation > 0.5) latent variables. This process resulted in a final set of 962 latent variables for further analysis. Code for our implementation of this material is available on GitHub at  https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/NF_LandscapePaper_2019 .  We used the R function prcomp to compute the principal components for  Figure 1 A,C both using genes ( Figure 1 A) and latent variables ( Figure 1 C). 2.4. Generation of Ensemble of Random Forests for Feature Selection  To select gene expression patterns of interest, we used ensembles of random forests to sufficiently resample our modestly sized dataset. We compared random forest models built using gene expression data as well as latent variables.  2.4.1. Algorithm Implementation The main algorithm was implemented using the “caret” and “randomforest” packages in R [ 44 , 45 ].  Figure S2  outlines the steps involved in the generation of the ensemble of random forests. Briefly, the full dataset was first split into 80%  model  set and 20%  independent test  set. The function createDataPartition was used to create balanced splits of the data according to the tumor type. We tuned two parameters to the random forest algorithm,  mtrys , and  ntrees , using an iterative approach, evaluating  mtrys  values of 1 to 100 and  ntrees  values of 250, 500, 1000, and 2000. We selected the optimal values ( mtry  = 51,  ntrees  = 1000) using fivefold cross-validation, using latent variables as input features. We then split the  model  training set further to generate 500 samples of  training  data (75%) and hold-out  test  data (25%) (balanced splits randomly sampled without replacement). Each of these  training  and  test  datasets were used to train separate random forests to obtain a distribution of F1 scores and feature importance scores ( n  = 500). Given our noisy dataset with limited sample size, the distribution of feature and F1 scores enabled estimation of confidence intervals for the feature importance as well as model performance.  2.4.2. Feature Selection The importance of each feature was estimated using raw importance scores that measure the change in correctly classified “class” due to random permutation of the values for the feature. To select the top features for a specific class (i.e., tumor type), we calculated the median  importance score  of each feature from the distribution of  raw importance scores  generated through 500 iterations of random forests. The top 40 features were selected according to the mean decrease of the Gini index. The union of top features from all classes was then used as a restricted feature set to train another 500 iterations of random forests as described above. However, each new forest trained with the restricted feature-set was tested using the  independent test set  to examine the performance of the model on a completely unseen dataset. For each class, the median F1 scores of the new ensemble of forests were compared to the previous ensemble of random forests. Improvement of median F1 scores for each class in the final ensemble of random forests compared to the earlier one suggested that the selected features from each class were sufficiently informative for their classification. This subset of features was then selected for downstream analyses. 2.5. Immune Subtype Prediction To understand the relative immune infiltration across the nerve sheath tumors studied, we used two tumor deconvolution methods: CIBERSORT and MCP-counter, as implemented through the “immunedeconv” R package [ 29 , 30 , 31 ]. Analysis is located at  https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/NF_LandscapePaper_2019  and results were uploaded to a Synapse table (syn21177277) that includes the tumor-specific immune cell scores for both algorithms as well as associated tumor metadata. 2.6. MetaVIPER We applied the metaVIPER algorithm [ 32 ] to infer protein regulatory activity based on the tissue gene expression profiles. This algorithm builds transcriptional regulatory networks across the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) [ 32 , 46 ] and uses these to build consensus predictions for a sample of other origin. The resulting analysis is uploaded to Synapse and stored at syn21259610 along with tumor-specific metadata.  2.7. VIPER Correlation Clustering and Drug Enrichment Analysis A heatmap and subclusters of latent variables that had similar VIPER protein predictions were generated using the “pheatmap” R package [ 47 ]. We observed five clear clusters of latent variables; these clusters were defined using the R cutree function to isolate the five clusters and their contents. We then calculated the mean correlation of each VIPER protein within each cluster to generate a consensus protein activity prediction for each latent variable cluster. Then, we used gene set enrichment analysis (via the “clusterProfiler” R package [ 48 ]) to assess whether drug targets were enriched in the five consensus protein lists. Drug-wise target lists were obtained from the Drug Target Explorer database [ 49 ]. Significant enrichment was defined as any positively enriched drug (i.e., a VIPER protein positively correlated with the latent variable cluster) with a Benjamini–Hochberg corrected  p -value < 0.05. Results were plotted using “ggplot” and “enrichplot” packages [ 33 , 50 ]. To plot the LV cluster expression by tumor type, we calculated the mean expression of all latent variables for each cluster and for each tumor sample. 2.1.

PMID:15206577,Gene expression analysis of the lung following paraquat administration in rats using DNA microarray.,"Gene expression changes in the lungs induced by paraquat (PQ) administration were studied in rats using DNA microarrays that were detectable for 1,090 genes per DNA microarray. The rats were subjected to subacute PQ exposure (7 mg/kg, s.c., daily for eight administrations). Two days after the final administration, the rats were divided into two groups. Group 1 experienced significant body weight loss and displayed signs of subacute PQ toxicity, but Group 2 showed no significant effects due to the PQ treatment. A control group, Group 3, was also included. In the comparison of the gene expression levels in the animals from Group 1 or Group 2 to the control animals treated by vehicle, 48 genes in Group 1 and 29 genes from Group 2 were differentially expressed. The twenty-eight genes were common to these two groups. These differentially expressed genes following paraquat treatment were classified as follows: 5 neurotransmitter receptor genes; 4 transporter genes; 4 voltage-gated ion channel genes; 2 lipid metabolism enzyme genes; 2 G-proteins involved in endocytosis and exocytosis genes; 7 cytokine genes; 4 ADP ribosylation genes involved in cell death and regeneration; CFTR gene, which is the causal gene for cystic fibrosis; neurofibromatosis type 1 gene, which is the causal gene for the neurofibromatosis type 1 that is known to accompany pulmonary fibrosis; and the causal gene for spinocerebellar ataxia. These genes may prove to be the keys for the elucidation of the mechanism of PQ toxicity, e.g. PQ-induced pulmonary fibrosis.",,Yoshihide Satomi; Wakana Tsuchiya; Keiko Mihara; Mikio Ota; Yoshinori Kasahara; Fumiaki Akahori,The Journal of toxicological sciences,2004-05,10.2131/jts.29.91,abstract_only,False
PMID:38115252,Identification of hub genes and drug candidates for NF2-related vestibular schwannoma by bioinformatics tools.,"Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2)-related vestibular schwannoma (NF2-VS) is a rare genetic disorder that results in bilateral acoustic neuromas. However, the exact pathogenesis of the disease is still unclear. This study aims to use bioinformatics analyses to identify potential hub genes and therapeutic. We retrieved the mRNA expression profiles (GSE108524 and GSE141801) of NF2-VS from the database, and selected the leading 25% genes with the most variance across samples for weighted correlation network analysis. Subsequently, we conducted gene ontology term and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes signaling network enrichment analyses. The STRING database was employed for protein-protein interaction (PPI) axis construction. The mRNA-miRNA modulatory network was generated via the miRTarBase database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified via the R package ""limma"" in both datasets, and hub genes were screened via intersection of common DEGs, candidate hub genes from the PPI axis, and candidate hub genes from the key module. Finally, common DEGs were uploaded onto the connectivity map database to determine drug candidates. Based on our observations, the blue module exhibited the most significant relation to NF2-VS, and it included the NF2 gene. Using enrichment analysis, we demonstrated that the blue modules were intricately linked to modulations of cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, junction, and actin skeleton. Overall, 356 common DEGs were screened in both datasets, and 33 genes carrying a degree > 15 were chosen as candidate hub genes in the PPI axis. Subsequently, 4 genes, namely, GLUL, CAV1, MYH11, and CCND1 were recognized as real hub genes. In addition, 10 drugs with enrichment scores < -0.7 were identified as drug candidates. Our conclusions offered a novel insight into the potential underlying mechanisms behind NF2-VS. These findings may facilitate the identification of novel therapeutic targets in the future.","2. Materials and methods 2.1. Data accumulation Publicly available NF2-VS mRNA datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus website ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ ).  GSE108524 , compiled using the  GPL17586  platform of the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome HTA_2_0 Array, contains 31 human samples stratified into 3 categories: 17 NF2-VSs, 10 sporadic VSs, and 4 normal nerves. In contrast,  GSE141801 , compiled using the  GPL13667  Affymetrix Human Genome U219 Array, contains samples from 9 recurrent irradiated VSs (5 sporadic, 1 cystic, and 3 NF2-VSs), 36 sporadic VSs, 13 NF2-VSs, and 7 control vestibular nerve tissues. Only the NF2-VSs and control nerves from both datasets were analyzed in this study. Data standardization was performed using the R 4.0.3. 2.2. Construction of a co-expression network “WGCNA,” [  an R package, was used to conduct WGCNA. The “pickSoftThreshold” tool was employed for the soft-thresholding power measurement. Subsequently, a co-expression network module was developed using the “one-step network construction and module detection method,” and the minimum gene quantity within the modules was set to 30. 9 ] 2.3. Selection of the NF2-VS-related module For the determination of major components of various modules, we employed module eigengenes (MEs), which utilize the first principal component of module expressions. We also evaluated the association between MEs and patient clinicophysiological information, and generated heat maps. 2.4. Functional enrichment analysis (FEA) To elucidate the roles of NF2-VS-related genes within the modules, we performed FEA of the strongly associated modules using the clusterProfiler package of the R software. [ 
 10 ] P  value adjustment was done via the Holm–Bonferroni technique. The adjusted  P  and the  q  value thresholds were set to 0.05. 2.5. Generation of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) axis The key module genes were uploaded to STRING ( https://string-db.org/ ) to generate the PPI axis, and the results were visualized using the Cytoscape (v3.8.2) software. [  Individual node degree was computed using Cytoscape. Lastly, genes with > 15 degree were considered to be candidate hub genes. 11 ] 2.6. Construction and analysis of the miRNA-mRNA network To explore correlations between miRNA and mRNA in the key module, we retrieved miRNA information from the miRTarBase database, including, over 50,000 experimentally validated miRNA-target associations. The miRNA-mRNA modulatory network was visualized using Cytoscape. 2.7. DEGs screening DEGs were identified between NF2-Vs and normal nerves using the R package “limma.” [  The threshold parameters were: false discovery rate < 0.05 and |log 12 ] 2 (fold change) | ≥ 1. 2.8. Identification of drug candidates To identify small molecular drugs that may effectively inhibit NF2-VSs occurrence and progression, we uploaded our list of up- and down-regulated genes into the connectivity map (CMap) database. CMap, a gene expression database, was employed to screen for functional associations among small molecular compounds, genes, and disease status. [  A correlation score was then obtained from the CMap database based on the DEG enrichment in the reference gene expression. 13 ]",Jiasheng Yuan; Yanpeng Fu; Yuehui Liu,Medicine,2023-12-15,10.1097/MD.0000000000036696,minimal,True
PMID:28848060,Genetic Severity Score predicts clinical phenotype in NF2.,"UNLABELLED: ​BACKGROUND: The clinical severity of disease in neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is variable. Patients affected with a constitutional truncating  METHODS: We have assessed NF2 clinical phenotype in 142 patients in relation to the UK NF2 Genetic Severity Score to validate its use as a clinical and research tool. RESULTS: The Genetic Severity Score showed significant correlations across 10 measures, including mean age at diagnosis, proportion of patients with bilateral vestibular schwannomas, presence of intracranial meningioma, spinal meningioma and spinal schwannoma, NF2 eye features, hearing grade, age at first radiotherapy, age at first surgery and age starting bevacizumab. In addition there was moderate but significant correlation with age at loss of useful hearing, and weak but significant correlations for mean age at death, quality of life, last optimum Speech Discrimination Score and total number of major interventions. Patients with severe disease presented at a younger age had a higher disease burden and greater requirement of intervention than patients with mild and moderate disease. CONCLUSIONS: This study validates the UK NF2 Genetic Severity Score to stratify patients with NF2 for both clinical use and natural history studies.","Methods We have assessed NF2 clinical phenotype in 142 patients in relation to the UK NF2 Genetic Severity Score to validate its use as a clinical and research tool. Methods NF2 care in England is nationally commissioned and coordinated through four centres. An NF2 Genetic Severity Score was determined based on the phenotype of patients assessed through the Manchester NF2 service. For validation, all patients known to the Oxford NF2 centre who met the Manchester NF2 diagnostic criteria and consented to genetic testing were analysed. Seven patients previously used for delineation of the score were excluded. One hundred and forty-two patients met the inclusion criteria. The data assessed were from last clinical assessment, but the length of follow-up differed. A score from 1A to 3, according to mutation type and presence of mosaicism, was assigned. The score used in this validation analysis differed from that previously published by analysing tissue mosaicism as a separate category, due to the more attenuated phenotype. For clinical use, the Genetic Severity Score ( table 1 ) consists of a 3-point classification into tissue mosaicism, classic and severe disease. The tissue mosaic group constitutes those where NF2 is confirmed on clinical criteria, but no  NF2  mutation is detected on blood analysis, or where mosaic NF2 is confirmed molecularly as confined to tissue. In the classic group an  NF2  mutation is identified in the blood or the patient has inherited NF2, but no  NF2  mutation is identified (thus excluding mosaicism and inferring an undetectable  NF2  mutation), excepting non-mosaic truncating mutations in exons 2–13, which determine the severe category. For natural history studies, group 1 is subdivided into presumed and confirmed mosaic NF2, and group 2 according to the type of mutation into mild and moderate disease ( tables 1 and 2 ). Table 1 UK neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) Genetic Severity Score Genetic severity Subcategory Clinical characteristics Definition 1 Tissue mosaic 1A Presumed tissue mosaicism Meets clinical criteria for sporadic NF2 but not confirmed molecularly with identical  NF2  mutations detected in two separate tissue samples 1B Confirmed tissue mosaicism Mosaic NF2 confirmed molecularly with identical  NF2  mutations detected in two or more separate tissue samples 2 Classic 2A Mild NF2 Full or mosaic  NF2  mutation identified in blood excluding those found in group 2B or 3: missense mutations; in-frame deletions and duplications; deletions involving the promoter region or exon 1; splice site mutations in exons 8–15; truncating mutations of exon 1; mosaicism in blood for mutations other than truncating mutations in exons 2–13  Inherited NF2 but no  NF2 ,  SMARCB1  or  LZTR1  mutation identified in blood 2B Moderate NF2 Full or mosaic  NF2  mutation identified in blood including: splicing mutation involving exons 1–7; large deletion not including the promoter or exon 1; truncating mutations in exons 14–15; mosaic in blood for a truncating mutation in exons 2–13 3 Severe 3 Severe NF2 Full  NF2  truncating mutation exons 2–13 Table 2 Categorisation of  NF2  mutations into severity groups

 2A NF2, neurofibromatosis type 2; NGS, next-generation sequencing. Records from routine clinical care were reviewed according to six domains—patient demographics, tumour load, ocular features, hearing, major interventions and quality of life—to see if the Genetic Severity Score could differentiate patients across these domains. Mutation testing was performed via the Manchester National Health Service (NHS) diagnostic laboratory on blood and where available on one or more tissue samples. To confirm  NF2  mosaicism in tissue, two separate, independently arising schwannoma samples were analysed for the presence of the same  NF2  mutation that was absent from the blood. Where only one schwannoma tissue sample was available and a mutation was identified (with loss of the presumed normal allele) which was not present in the blood, tissue mosaicism was assumed and the patient was assigned to group 1A. Where no tissue sample was available for analysis but the Manchester criteria for a diagnosis of NF2 were fulfilled, the patient was assigned to group 1A. Mosaicism in the blood was determined either by the presence of a mutation present at <50% level on next-generation sequencing, or after identification of an  NF2  mutation in a tumour, which was subsequently found at low levels in blood. Tumour load was assessed by review of gadolinium-enhanced brain and spine MRI scans performed according to a nationally agreed protocol, and reported by a single NF2 specialist neuroradiologist. Presence of VS, intracranial meningioma and spinal tumours was assessed. Any size of lesion was included and categorised by the most likely lesion radiologically, although where available histological diagnosis was used. No account was taken of size, number or growth rate of tumours. All patients had a detailed eye review at diagnosis for NF2-related features. Records were reviewed looking for the presence of cataract under age 40, combined retinal hamartoma and epiretinal membrane, or radiological evidence of an optic nerve meningioma. Hearing grade was assigned based on a score of 1–6, 30  as used within the English NF2 service to indicate suitability for a hearing implant, with grades 1, 2 and 3/4 hearing equating to optimum Speech Discrimination Score (SDS) in the better hearing ear >70%, 50%–70% and below 50%, respectively, grade 5 representing patients with a hearing implant and grade 6 those with bilaterally dead ears. Major interventions counted were VS surgery, non-VS intracranial surgery, radiotherapy, spinal surgery, shunt surgery and treatment with bevacizumab. Where surgery or radiotherapy was given to a complex cerebellopontine mass, with potentially more than one tumour type, this was taken as one major intervention, but if confirmed as different tumour types removal of both tumour types was counted separately. Sixteen individuals had more than one surgery to the same VS, and these procedures were counted separately. If radiotherapy was performed to more than one discrete lesion, the number of lesions treated was used to represent the number of procedures. Treatment with bevacizumab was counted as one intervention, even if treatment breaks occurred. Quality of life was assessed using the 8-item NF2 disease-specific quality of life score (0–24), 27  with good internal reliability (Cronbach’s α=0.87). Each item consists of four statements rated from 0 to 3, with 0 indicating no problems along different dimensions (eg, mobility, hearing, sight and so on). Last recorded measurements were collected. Statistical analyses were undertaken using SPSS V.23. Genetic severity and hearing grades were treated as ordinal variables. We report standard summary statistics throughout with statistical significance of inferences set to p<0.05. We used χ 2  statistics to compare distributions of gender, mutation data, tumour load, as well as ocular and hearing outcomes. When comparing multiple distributions, we used z-tests with Bonferroni corrections. Trends with genetic severity were investigated using Mantel-Haenszel linear-by-linear χ 2  tests of association. Spearman’s rank-order correlations were run to assess the relationship between age of patients, quality of life, optimum SDS scores, number of interventions, number of symptoms, ratio of interventions to age and genetic severity. Preliminary analysis showed that all relationships were monotonic, as assessed by visual inspection of scatterplots. Two further independent cohorts of patients previously described 10 14  with  NF2  mutations and phenotypic data were assessed to determine if the score could separate these cohorts phenotypically. The score was assigned and correlation examined with age at diagnosis for both cohorts and linear associations with presence of meningiomas, 14  cranial tumours and spinal tumours. 10  To uniformly analyse the data of other cohorts in a comparable way, we converted the data into binary values (yes/no) for the presence or absence of tumours. The study received approval from the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.

PMID:25043298,Oncogenic role of Merlin/NF2 in glioblastoma.,"Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults, with a poor prognosis because of its resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Merlin/NF2 (moesin-ezrin-radixin-like protein/neurofibromatosis type 2) is a tumor suppressor found to be mutated in most nervous system tumors; however, it is not mutated in glioblastomas. Merlin associates with several transmembrane receptors and intracellular proteins serving as an anchoring molecule. Additionally, it acts as a key component of cell motility. By selecting sub-populations of U251 glioblastoma cells, we observed that high expression of phosphorylated Merlin at serine 518 (S518-Merlin), NOTCH1 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) correlated with increased cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. These cells were defective in cell-contact inhibition with changes in Merlin phosphorylation directly affecting NOTCH1 and EGFR expression, as well as downstream targets HES1 (hairy and enhancer of split-1) and CCND1 (cyclin D1). Of note, we identified a function for S518-Merlin, which is distinct from what has been reported when the expression of Merlin is diminished in relation to EGFR and NOTCH1 expression, providing first-time evidence that demonstrates that the phosphorylation of S518-Merlin in glioblastoma promotes oncogenic properties that are not only the result of inactivation of the tumor suppressor role of Merlin but also an independent process implicating a Merlin-driven regulation of NOTCH1 and EGFR.","Supplementary Materials and Methods Merlin knockdown U251-S cells were treated with siRNA SMARTpool (Thermo Scientific) directed to Merlin. Following 48 hours treatment, cells were transfected with pXJ40-HA-Merlin and S518A pXJ40- HA-Merlin and incubated for additional 48 hours before cells were collected and analyzed by Western blotting and real-time PCR.

Western blotting Western blotting was performed as described previously [ 33 ]. Rabbit anti-EGFR, Notch1 (Cell Signaling), and rabbit anti S518-Merlin (Abcam and Cell Signaling) were used at 1:1000 dilution. Cell fractionation Cells were treated with IPA-3 (Sigma-Aldrich) a PAK group1 inhibitor (PAK1/2/3), and were fractionated using the Q-proteome cell compartment kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer’s instructions. Markers for membrane, cytosolic and nuclear fractions were: rabbit anti- Na + , K + - ATPase, GAPDH, and PARP (Cell Signaling) respectively. Antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilution. Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) Co-IP experiments were performed without deviation from Co-IP kit protocol (Thermo Scientific). Reverse transcriptase real-time PCR (RT-Q-PCR) Total RNA of cultured cells was extracted using the Rneasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) following manufacture’s instructions. 500ng of RNA were reverse-transcribed using the SuperScript™ III first-strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Life Technologies). cDNA was diluted ten times and 2.5μl were used for quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) using Power SYBR Green PCR master mix (Life Technologies).

PMID:2491783,Physical mapping of the von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis region on chromosome 17.,"The von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1) locus has been linked to chromosome 17, and recent linkage analyses place the gene on the proximal long arm. NF1 probably resides in 17q11.2, since two unrelated NF1 patients have been identified who possess constitutional reciprocal translocations involving 17q11.2 with chromosomes 1 and 22. We have used a somatic-cell hybrid from the t(17;22) individual, along with other hybrid cell lines, to order probes around the NF1 locus. An additional probe, 17L1, has been isolated from a NotI linking library made from flow-sorted chromosome 17 material and has been mapped to a region immediately proximal to the translocation breakpoint. While neither NF1 translocation breakpoint has yet been identified by pulse-field gel analysis, an overlap between two probes, EW206 and EW207, has been detected. Furthermore, we have identified the breakpoint in a non-NF1 translocation, SP-3, on the proximal side of the NF1 locus. This breakpoint has been helpful in creating a 1,000-kb pulsed-field map, which includes the closely linked NF1 probes HHH202 and TH17.19. The combined somatic-cell hybrid and pulsed-field gel analysis we report here favors the probe order D17Z1-HHH202-TH17.19-CRYB1-17L1-NF1- (EW206, EW207, EW203, L581, L946)-(ERBB2, ERBA1).

PMID:34043012,RNA sequence analysis reveals ITGAL/CD11A as a stromal regulator of murine low-grade glioma growth.,"BACKGROUND: Emerging insights from numerous laboratories have revealed important roles for nonneoplastic cells in the development and progression of brain tumors. One of these nonneoplastic cellular constituents, glioma-associated microglia (GAM), represents a unique population of brain monocytes within the tumor microenvironment that have been reported to both promote and inhibit glioma proliferation. To elucidate the role of GAM in the setting of low-grade glioma (LGG), we leveraged RNA sequencing meta-analysis, genetically engineered mouse strains, and human biospecimens. METHODS: Publicly available disease-associated microglia (DAM) RNA-seq datasets were used, followed by immunohistochemistry and RNAScope validation. CD11a-deficient mouse microglia were used for in vitro functional studies, while LGG growth in mice was assessed using anti-CD11a neutralizing antibody treatment of Neurofibromatosis type 1 (Nf1) optic glioma mice in vivo. RESULTS: We identified Itgal/CD11a enrichment in GAM relative to other DAM populations, which was confirmed in several independently generated murine models of Nf1 optic glioma. Moreover, ITGAL/CD11A expression was similarly increased in human LGG (pilocytic astrocytoma) specimens from several different datasets, specifically in microglia from these tumors. Using CD11a-knockout mice, CD11a expression was shown to be critical for murine microglia CX3CL1 receptor (Cx3cr1) expression and CX3CL1-directed motility, as well as glioma mitogen (Ccl5) production. Consistent with an instructive role for CD11a+ microglia in stromal control of LGG growth, antibody-mediated CD11a inhibition reduced mouse Nf1 LGG growth in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these findings establish ITGAL/CD11A as a critical microglia regulator of LGG biology relevant to future stroma-targeted brain tumor treatment strategies.",,Amanda De Andrade Costa; Jit Chatterjee; Olivia Cobb; Shilpa Sanapala; Suzanne Scheaffer; Xiaofan Guo; Sonika Dahiya; David H Gutmann,Neuro-oncology,2022-01-05,10.1093/neuonc/noab130,abstract_only,False
PMID:7996175,Hepatocyte growth factor is a mitogen for Schwann cells and is present in neurofibromas.,"To characterize mitogens that might contribute to Schwann cell proliferation during development or in tumors, we tested the ability of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) to stimulate Schwann cell division in vitro. HGF is a potent mitogen for purified rat Schwann cells; DNA synthesis in rat Schwann cells was stimulated 20-40-fold by 3-10 ng/ml HGF. Rat Schwann cells express c-met mRNA, encoding the HGF receptor, but not HGF mRNA, implying that HGF might act as a paracrine Schwann cell growth factor. HGF-stimulated Schwann cell proliferation differs from that of previously described Schwann cell mitogens in that its activity is abolished by forskolin and is not inhibited or potentiated by addition of transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) or fibroblast growth factor (FGF). HGF is probably not a component of the axonal signal thought to cause Schwann cell division during development, as anti-HGF neutralizing antibodies failed to block neuron-stimulated Schwann cell proliferation. In contrast, mitogenic activity present in normal human adult nerves and in neurofibromas from patients with type 1 neurofibromatosis analyzed in the absence of forskolin is largely inhibitable by anti-HGF. Thus, HGF is a novel mitogen for Schwann cells in vitro and it is present in Schwann cell tumors, suggesting a potential role for HGF after wounding of peripheral nerves or in tumor growth.",,A Krasnoselsky; M J Massay; M C DeFrances; G Michalopoulos; R Zarnegar; N Ratner,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,1994-12,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.14-12-07284.1994,abstract_only,False
PMID:28846462,Immunohistochemical Markers for Prospective Studies in Neurofibromatosis-1 Porcine Models.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common, cancer-predisposing disease caused by mutations in the NF1 tumor gene. Patients with NF1 have an increased risk for benign and malignant tumors of the nervous system (e.g., neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, gliomas) and other tissues (e.g., leukemias, rhabdomyosarcoma, etc.) as well as increased susceptibility to learning disabilities, chronic pain/migraines, hypertension, pigmentary changes, and developmental lesions (e.g., tibial pseudoarthrosis). Pigs are an attractive and upcoming animal model for future NF1 studies, but a potential limitation to porcine model research has been the lack of validated reagents for direct translational study to humans. To address that issue, we used formalin-fixed tissues (human and pigs) to evaluate select immunohistochemical markers (activated caspase-3, allograft inflammatory factor-1, beta-tubulin III, calbindin D, CD13, CD20, desmin, epithelial membrane antigen, glial fibrillary acidic protein, glucose transporter-1, laminin, myelin basic protein, myoglobin, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, S100, vimentin, and von Willebrand factor). The markers were validated by comparing known expression and localization in human and pig tissues. Validation of these markers on fixed tissues will facilitate prospective immunohistochemical studies of NF1 pigs, as well as other pig models, in a more efficient, reproducible, and translationally relevant manner.",,David K Meyerholz; Georgina K Ofori-Amanfo; Mariah R Leidinger; J Adam Goeken; Rajesh Khanna; Jessica C Sieren; Benjamin W Darbro; Dawn E Quelle; Jill M Weimer,The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society,2017-10,10.1369/0022155417729357,abstract_only,False
PMID:36420221,Antisense oligonucleotides targeting exon 11 are able to partially rescue the NF2-related schwannomatosis phenotype ,NF2-related schwannomatosis (NF2-related SWN) is an autosomal dominant condition caused by loss of function variants in the ,"Material and methods All procedures performed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the IGTP Institutional Review Board, which approved this study and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments. Samples Samples from 14 NF2-related SWN patients from the Spanish National Reference Center on phakomatoses were included in the study ( Table S1 ) after providing written informed consent. Samples included in the study were those harboring a splicing variant or a truncating variant in an in-frame exon of  NF2 . In controls, fibroblasts  NF2 (+/+)  stand as non-affected cells for experimental control (WT), with no mutation in the  NF2  gene, obtained from healthy donors. Genetic  NF2  test Genetic testing was performed using the customized I2HCP panel  in blood or tissue when available. To detect splicing variants, patients were studied both at the RNA and DNA levels. Variants were validated by Sanger sequencing and analyzed using CLC-workbench (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) in all primary cultures established using ( 81 NM_000268.3 ;  NG_009057.1 ; LRG_511) as reference sequences. In silico NF2  analysis NF2  exons were evaluated using  NM_000268.3  and  NG_009057.1  reference sequences.  NF2  pathogenic variants described in the LOVD in addition with our genetic variants database identified in our NF2-related SWN cohort.  All  29 in silico  analyses of exons (and combinations of them) that when skipped, an in-frame Merlin protein is theoretically maintained were based on the analysis performed by Leier et al. 2021.  Post-translation modifications (PTM) were retrieved from Phosfosite. 82  Only phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitylation were considered as PTMs. Analyses of  83 in silico  protein modifications by the exon skipping were performed using the web-server version of PredictProtein ( https://www.PredictProtein.org ). 46 , 47 Antisense specificity and efficacy The 25-mer-specific PMOs for four patients with splicing variants, and a pair of PMOs to induce exon skipping of exons 4, 8, and 11 of the  NF2  gene were designed ( NM_000268.3 ;  NG_009057.1 ;  LRG_511 ), synthesized and purified by Gene Tools (Philomath, OR). Endo-Porter (Gene Tools) was used as vehicle to deliver PMOs into cells at 6 μM (manufacturer-recommended dose), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Patient primary fibroblasts carrying  NF2  germline pathogenic variants were treated with the specific single or paired PMOs. A dose-response and a time course study were performed to set-up treatment conditions and the effect of PMOs was assessed by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. Levels of Merlin after PMO treatment were analyzed by western blot. For all experiments, the correct effect of the treatment at RNA level was confirmed before western blot analysis. Analysis of Merlin-e11 phenotype recovery An actin immunocytochemistry assay was performed to study the cytoskeletal organization after PMO treatment using Phalloidin (Molecular Probes [Eugene, OR], Invitrogen [Waltham, MA]). AClick-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 488 Flow Cytometry Assay Kit (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) was used, according to the manufacturer’s protocol, to determine cell proliferation. Cell viability was assessed using RealTime-Glo MT Cell Viability Assay (Promega) following the manufacturer’s instructions. NF2  cloning and expression The  NF2  gene was cloned using the Gateway Gene Cloning system (Invitrogen) after treatment to induce the exon-skipping to an FLAG Tag Expression Vector. The expression vector was transfected into HeLa cells (Lipofectamine LTX with Plus Reagent, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Flag expression was assessed by western blot (Monoclonal ANTI-FLAG M2 antibody, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Statistics Statistical analysis was carried out using GraphPad Prism software v7. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test normality and for multiple group comparisons, a two-tailed unpaired t test was performed.

PMID:3280697,"Monoclonal antibody (AFH1) immunoreactive on morphologically abnormal basal melanocytes within dysplastic nevi, nevocellular nevus nests, and melanoma.","The mouse monoclonal antibody AFH1 was produced using formalin-fixed, sham paraffin-embedded human melanoma cell culture line A375 as immunogen. Reactivity of this antibody was assessed by immunohistochemical techniques against formalin- or acid alcohol-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue as well as formalin- or acid alcohol-fixed unembedded lesions. Ninety-seven nevomelanocytic lesions, neurofibromas, epithelial lesions, and a plasmacellular infiltrate were evaluated. AFH1 was immunoreactive on 54 of 55 nevocytic lesions (98.2%), 15 of 16 primary melanomas (93.7%), a lentigo maligna, and nests in 21 of 21 dysplastic nevi (100%). Of 100 consecutive basal melanocytes of intraepidermal melanoma cells counted in each lesion, mean AFH1 immunoreactivity for nonnested basal melanocytes in nevocellular nevi was 3.8%; for dysplastic nevi, 13.8%; and for intraepidermal melanoma cells, 78.0%. When nonnested basal melanocytes were subdivided into cytologically normal and abnormal cell groups, AFH1 immunoreactivity was 9.4% and 72.6%, respectively. AFH1 recognition of the lentiginous portion of dysplastic nevi corresponds statistically to the appearance of abnormal melanocyte cytology, nest formation, or both. Using 50% immunoreactive nonnested melanocytes as the criterion, AFH1 seems to distinguish primary melanoma from dysplastic nevi with a sensitivity of 93.8% and a specificity of 95.8%.",,P J Aronson; K Ito; T Fukaya; K Hashimoto; A H Mehregan,The Journal of investigative dermatology,1988-04,10.1111/1523-1747.ep12460896,abstract_only,False
PMID:8417346,"A conserved alternative splice in the von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1) gene produces two neurofibromin isoforms, both of which have GTPase-activating protein activity.","Sequence analysis has shown significant homology between the catalytic regions of the mammalian ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP), yeast Ira1p and Ira2p (inhibitory regulators of the RAS-cyclic AMP pathway), and neurofibromin, the protein encoded by the NF1 gene. Yeast expression experiments have confirmed that a 381-amino-acid segment of neurofibromin, dubbed the GAP-related domain (GRD), can function as a GAP. Using the RNA polymerase chain reaction with primers flanking the NF1-GRD, we have identified evidence for alternative splicing in this region of the NF1 gene. In addition to the already published sequence (type I), an alternative RNA carrying a 63-nucleotide insertion (type II) is present in all tissues examined, although the relative amounts of types I and II vary. The insertion is conserved across species but is not present in GAP, IRA1, or IRA2. GenBank searches have failed to identify significant similarity between the inserted sequence and known DNA or protein sequences, although the basic amino acid composition of the insertion shares features with nuclear targeting sequences. Expression studies in yeasts show that despite the partial disruption of the neurofibromin-IRA-GAP homology by this insertion, both forms of the NF1-GRD can complement loss of IRA function. In vivo assays designed to compare the GAP activity of the two alternatively spliced forms of the NF1-GRD show that both can increase the conversion of GTP-bound ras to its GDP-bound form, although the insertion of the 21 amino acids weakens this effect. The strong conservation of this alternative splicing suggests that both type I and II isoforms mediate important biological functions of neurofibromin.",,L B Andersen; R Ballester; D A Marchuk; E Chang; D H Gutmann; A M Saulino; J Camonis; M Wigler; F S Collins,Molecular and cellular biology,1993-01,10.1128/mcb.13.1.487-495.1993,abstract_only,False
PMID:18768391,Pak1 regulates multiple c-Kit mediated Ras-MAPK gain-in-function phenotypes in Nf1+/- mast cells.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common genetic disorder caused by mutations in the NF1 locus, which encodes neurofibromin, a negative regulator of Ras. Patients with NF1 develop numerous neurofibromas, which contain many inflammatory mast cells that contribute to tumor formation. Subsequent to c-Kit stimulation, signaling from Ras to Rac1/2 to the MAPK pathway appears to be responsible for multiple hyperactive mast cell phenotypes; however, the specific effectors that mediate these functions remain uncertain. p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1) is a downstream mediator of Rac1/2 that has been implicated as a positive regulator of MAPK pathway members and is a modulator of cell growth and cytoskeletal dynamics. Using an intercross of Pak 1(-/-) mice with Nf1(+/-) mice, we determined that Pak1 regulates hyperactive Ras-dependent proliferation via a Pak1/Erk pathway, whereas a Pak1/p38 pathway is required for the increased migration in Nf1(+/-) mast cells. Furthermore, we confirmed that loss of Pak1 corrects the dermal accumulation of Nf1(+/-) mast cells in vivo to levels found in wild-type mice. Thus, Pak1 is a novel mast cell mediator that functions as a key node in the MAPK signaling network and potential therapeutic target in NF1 patients.",,Andrew S McDaniel; Jayme D Allen; Su-Jung Park; Zahara M Jaffer; Elizabeth G Michels; Sarah J Burgin; Shi Chen; Waylan K Bessler; Clemens Hofmann; David A Ingram; Jonathan Chernoff; D Wade Clapp,Blood,2008-12-01,10.1182/blood-2008-04-155085,abstract_only,False

PMID:25360213,A chemical biology approach identified PI3K as a potential therapeutic target for neurofibromatosis type 2.,"Mutations in the merlin tumor suppressor gene cause Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), which is a disease characterized by development of multiple benign tumors in the nervous system. The current standard of care for NF2 calls for surgical resection of the characteristic tumors, often with devastating neurological consequences. There are currently no approved non-surgical therapies for NF2. In an attempt to identify much needed targets and therapeutically active compounds for NF2 treatment, we employed a chemical biology approach using ultra-high-throughput screening. To support this goal, we created a merlin-null mouse Schwann cell (MSC) line to screen for compounds that selectively decrease their viability and proliferation. We optimized conditions for 384-well plate assays and executed a proof-of-concept screen of the Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds. Further confirmatory and selectivity assays identified phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) as a potential NF2 drug target. Notably, loss of merlin function is associated with activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in human schwannomas. We report that AS605240, a PI3K inhibitor, decreased merlin-null MSC viability in a dose-dependent manner without significantly decreasing viability of control Schwann cells. AS605240 exerted its action on merlin-null MSCs by promoting caspase-dependent apoptosis and inducing autophagy. Additional PI3K inhibitors tested also decreased viability of merlin-null MSCs in a dose-dependent manner. In summary, our chemical genomic screen and subsequent hit validation studies have identified PI3K as potential target for NF2 therapy.",,Alejandra M Petrilli; Marisa A Fuse; Mathew S Donnan; Marga Bott; Nicklaus A Sparrow; Daniel Tondera; Julia Huffziger; Corina Frenzel; C Siobhan Malany; Christophe J Echeverri; Layton Smith; Cristina Fernández-Valle,American journal of translational research,2014,,abstract_only,False
PMID:32438526,Effects of Neurod1 Expression on Mouse and Human Schwannoma Cells.,"OBJECTIVES: The objective was to explore the effect of the proneuronal transcription factor neurogenic differentiation 1 (Neurod1, ND1) on Schwann cells (SC) and schwannoma cell proliferation. METHODS: Using a variety of transgenic mouse lines, we investigated how expression of Neurod1 effects medulloblastoma (MB) growth, schwannoma tumor progression, vestibular function, and SC cell proliferation. Primary human vestibular schwannoma (VS) cell cultures were transduced with adenoviral vectors expressing Neurod1. Cell proliferation was assessed by 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) uptake. STUDY DESIGN: Basic science investigation. RESULTS: Expression of Neurod1 reduced the growth of slow-growing but not fast-growing MB models. Gene transfer of Neurod1 in human schwannoma cultures significantly reduced cell proliferation in dose-dependent way. Deletion of the neurofibromatosis type 2 (Nf2) tumor-suppressor gene via Cre expression in SCs led to increased intraganglionic SC proliferation and mildly reduced vestibular sensory-evoked potentials (VsEP) responses compared to age-matched wild-type littermates. The effect of Neurod1-induced expression on intraganglionic SC proliferation in animals lacking Nf2 was mild and highly variable. Sciatic nerve axotomy significantly increased SC proliferation in wild-type and Nf2-null animals, and expression of Neurod1 reduced the proliferative capacity of both wild-type and Nf2-null SCs following nerve injury. CONCLUSION: Expression of Neurod1 reduces slow-growing MB progression and reduces human SC proliferation in primary VS cultures. In a genetic mouse model of schwannomas, we find some effects of Neurod1 expression; however, the high variability indicates that more tightly regulated Neurod1 expression levels that mimic our in vitro data are needed to fully validate Neurod1 effects on schwannoma progression. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: NA Laryngoscope, 131:E259-E270, 2021.","Methods: Using a variety of transgenic mouse lines we investigated how expression of Neurod1 affects medulloblastoma (MB) growth, schwannoma tumor progression, vestibular function, and Schwann cell (SC) proliferation. Primary human vestibular schwannoma (VS) cell cultures were transduced with adenoviral vectors expressing  Neurod1 . Cell proliferation was assessed by EdU uptake. Material and Methods: Mouse lines: Periostin-cre ( Postn-cre ) were crossed with floxed  Nf2  gene ( Postn-cre;Nf2 ) as previously described. f/f  In addition, the  30 Postn-cre;Nf2  mice were crossed with a  f/f Rosa26  ( LSL-Neurod1 R26 ) line that induces Neurod1 expression via cre-mediated excision of a stop codon, enabling the Rosa26 locus to drive Neurod1 expression with or without elimination of the floxed  ND1 Nf2 . In addition we used the following mouse lines: tg( Atoh1-cre) ; 
 8 R26  and tg( smo 29 Neurod1-cre )  to generate fast and slow growing medulloblastoma to assess the effect of Neurod1 expression on this neuronal tumor progression. In addition, we used the widely available  16 R26  reporter mice to verify that the Postn-cre effectively and exclusively recombines the stop codon in the Rosa26 locus. All procedures involving mice followed NIH guidelines and were approved by the University of Iowa animal care and use committee (IACUC protocol 7021971) and IRB approval (201205804) for human VS cells. LacZ Mouse breeding: Postn-cre; Nf2 f/f ; Postn-cre; Nf2 f/f ; R26 ND1 : Mice were bred to obtain littermates having Postn-cre and floxed  Nf2  ( Postn-cre; Nf2 ,  f/f Nf2  conditional knock-out (cKO)) with or without induced expression of  Neurod1  ( Postn-cre; Nf2 f/f ; R26 ND1 , Nf2  cKO+ND1) ( Supplemental Fig. 1 ). Littermates expressing  Neurod1  without deletion of  Nf2  were used to test the effect of  Neurod1  expression on SCs. Control animals either lacked the cre or had cre without the floxed genes. Animals were coded so that investigators performing tumor, cellular, and functional tests were blinded to the mouse genotype. Mice were sacrificed at the end of the 12–15 months period. Atoh1-cre; R26 smo;ND1  & ND1-cre; R26 smo;ND1 : To assess how fast growing tumors are affected by Neurod1 expression we bred two lines of mice using the  Atoh1-cre  that expresses cre in the proliferating external granule layer.  However, these very rapid growing tumors showed no noticeable effect of Neurod1 expression so we generated a second, slower growing tumor that regulates  25 , 29 smoothened  (smo) and Neurod1 expression in mostly postmitotic differentiating granule cells ( Supplemental Fig. 2 ) Measuring proliferation rate in mouse schwannoma: Mice aged 10–15 months were injected with EdU 50mg/kg IP four times in a 24 hour period (0, 4, 8 and 24 hrs) and collected within 72 hrs. Mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde and vestibular and facial (geniculate) ganglia were dissected and reacted as whole mounts for EdU following an existing protocol.  Specifically, EdU was detected in whole ganglion using the Click-It EdU kit per manufacturer’s instructions (Life Technologies) and counterstained with DAPI to label nuclei. Ganglia were imaged on a SP5 Leica confocal microscope and the number of EdU-positive nuclei was quantified using the maximum projection of the z-stack. Dissected ganglia were also used to measure the ganglia volume using confocal stacks and the Amira software as previously described. 31  N=6 for each group. 31 Primary human VS cultures: Human VS tumors were collected for primary cell culture as previously described.  After VS cells were cultured without passaging for 10 days, Adenovirus (Ad) CMVempty vector (EV) at 5 × 10 32 – 34 9  pfu/mL, AdCMVNeuroD1 at 2 × 10 9  pfu/mL, or AdCMVNeuroD1 at 5 × 10 9  pfu/mL (ViraQuest, Inc.) were applied to the culture medium for 72 hours as before.  Edu staining was performed using Click-it EdU Alexa Fluor 633 Image Kit (ThermoFisher C10340) as before. 33 , 35 , 36  The percentage of EdU-positive cells to S100-positive nuclei were counted by 20× microscopic fields using the cell counting feature of MetaMorph software package. Data are averaged from independent cultures derived three separate sporadic human VSs. 37 Western blot: Western blots of protein extracts prepared from VS culture lysates were performed as before.  The primary antibodies used were anti-NeuroD1 (Abcam, ab109224) and anti-β-actin (Sigma, A5316) with horse-radish peroxidase linked secondary antibodies (Cell Singling, 7074S, 7076S). The blots were performed on cultures derived from three separate VSs. 33 , 38 Sciatic nerve axotomies and EdU uptake: A total of 20 adult mice (2–16months) were used; 6 mice control mice, 4 mice with Postn-cre;R26 ND1  and 5 mice each of  Nf2  cKO and  Nf2  cKO+ND1 mice. Sciatic nerve axotomy and quantification of EdU uptake was performed as previously described. 37 , 39 In situ hybridization and X-Gal reaction: We used established protocols and probes as before to reveal the distribution of LacZ activation via  Postn-cre  and reveal the distribution of endogenous and induced  Neurod1  and of endogenous  Atoh1  expression. 19 , 25 , 28 Gait analysis: Gait was analyzed using the Noldus Cat-Walk XT system as before. 39 , 40 Direct vestibular tests: Vestibular sensory-evoked potentials (VsEPs) were collected from the vestibular nerve and central relays on anesthetized mice using methods described in detail elsewhere.  Investigators were blind to the genotype. Animals were anesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine mixture (18 mg/ml ketamine, 2 mg/ml xylazine; 5 to 10 μl/g intraperitoneally). VsEPs assess gravity receptor function using the metrics of response thresholds, amplitudes and latencies. Following testing, animals were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde for further processing. At least six animals per genotype were tested and significance for any differences was evaluated using one-way or multivariate analysis of variance (ANOVA or MANOVA). 41 – 43",Jennifer Kersigo; Lintao Gu; Linjing Xu; Ning Pan; Sarath Vijayakuma; Timothy Jones; Seiji B Shibata; Bernd Fritzsch; Marlan R Hansen,The Laryngoscope,2021-01,10.1002/lary.28671,minimal,True
PMID:18367665,Induction of apoptosis in neurofibromatosis type 1 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor cell lines by a combination of novel farnesyl transferase inhibitors and lovastatin.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder that is driven by the loss of neurofibromin (Nf) protein function. Nf contains a Ras-GTPase-activating protein domain, which directly regulates Ras signaling. Numerous clinical manifestations are associated with the loss of Nf and increased Ras activity. Ras proteins must be prenylated to traffic and functionally localize with target membranes. Hence, Ras is a potential therapeutic target for treating NF1. We have tested the efficacy of two novel farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs), 1 and 2, alone or in combination with lovastatin, on two NF1 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) cell lines, NF90-8 and ST88-14. Single treatments of 1, 2, or lovastatin had no effect on Ras prenylation or MPNST cell proliferation. However, low micromolar combinations of 1 or 2 with lovastatin (FTI/lovastatin) reduced Ras prenylation in both MPNST cell lines. Furthermore, this FTI/lovastatin combination treatment reduced cell proliferation and induced an apoptotic response as shown by morphological analysis, procaspase-3/-7 activation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and accumulation of cells with sub-G(1) DNA content. Little to no detectable toxicity was observed in normal rat Schwann cells following FTI/lovastatin combination treatment. These data support the hypothesis that combination FTI plus lovastatin therapy may be a potential treatment for NF1 MPNSTs.","Methods Compounds and Reagents The synthesis of prodrug  1  has been reported ( Clark et al., 2007 ). Prodrug  2  was synthesized via an analogous route using aminoester  4  instead of methyl chlorobutylamine to generate prodrug ester  3 , followed by selective hydrolysis of the methyl ester ( Fig. 1 ). Lovastatin (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO) aliquots were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide and stored at −80°C. JC-1 (5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide) and Hoëchst 33342 (Invitrogen Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA) were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide and stored at 4°C. Mitotracker Orange CM-H2 TM Ros (Invitrogen Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA) aliquots were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide and stored at −20°C. Cell Culture NF90-8 and ST88-14 MPNST cell lines were generously donated by T. Glover (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). Cells were maintained as adherent cultures in RPMI 1640 (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA) with 5% Fetal Bovine Serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Primary normal rat Schwann cells were isolated from the sciatic nerves of neonatal Sprague-Davey Rats and grown on poly-D-lysine coated coverslips as described previously ( Skoff et al., 1998 ). These cells were grown in Eagles medium with 10% calf serum prior to experimental manipulations. Normal, spontaneously immortal rat Schwann cell clones (iSC) isolated from sciatic nerves were a generous gift from E.M. Shooter (Stanford University, Stanford, CA) and described previously ( Bolin et al., 1992 ). These cells were maintained in MEM supplemented with 10% horse serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All cells were maintained in a humidified incubator under 5% CO 2 . For all experiments, cells were plated 24 hours prior to drug treatment. Immediately before drug treatment, the medium was replaced with fresh growth medium for the duration of the experiment. Western Analysis Lysates were prepared from monolayers of cells in 2× Laemmli sample buffer by boiling for 5 minutes and cleared by centrifugation ( Mattingly et al., 2001 ). Samples were then separated on polyacrylamide-SDS gels and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose. Ras was detected with a 1:250 dilution of anti-pan Ras monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories, San Jose, CA). Caspase-3 was detected with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-Caspase-3 polycolonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) as described ( Menard et al., 2005 ). Retinoblastoma protein (pRb) phosphorylated Serine 780 was detected with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-Phospho-Rb Ser 780 polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). The nitrocellulose membrane was stripped and reprobed for total pRb with a 1:1000 dilution of a mouse monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). β-Tubulin was immunoblotted with a 1:2000 dilution of the E7 monoclonal antibody (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA). Proliferation Assay NF90-8 cells were plated at 20,000 cells/35-mm dish and ST88-14 cells were plated at 20,000 cells/60-mm dish 24 hours prior to drug treatment. Fresh medium was added before the drug treatment as described in the text. Attached cells were trypsinized and combined with media containing detached cells. The cells were collected by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 1000 g  and counted via a hemacytometer. Flow Cytometry NF90-8 and ST88-14 cells were treated and collected for DNA analysis as described previously ( Reiners et al., 1999 ). DNA content was analyzed using a FACScalibur instrument (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). A minimum of 10 4  cells/sample were analyzed to determine the percentage of apoptotic cells and cells in G 1 , S, and G 2 /M phase (MODFIT; Variety Software, Topsham, ME). DEVDase Activity Assay Lysates of NF90-8 and ST88-14 cultures were prepared and used in DEVDase assays as previously described ( Caruso et al., 2004 ). Changes in fluorescence over time were converted into picomoles of product by comparison with a standard curve made with 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin. DEVDase specific activities are reported as nanomoles of product per minute per milligram of protein. The bicinchoninic acid assay, using bovine serum albumin as a standard, was used to estimate protein concentrations. Mitochondrial Membrane Potential and Nuclear Morphology NF90-8 cells were plated at 100,000 cells/100-mm dish 24 hours prior to drug treatment. At the end of the drug treatment, mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ m ) was assayed by two independent methods. In one series of experiments, JC-1 was added directly to the medium at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml, and incubated for 10 minutes at 37°C. Attached cells were trypsinized and combined with growth media containing detached cells. The cells were collected at 500  g  for 5 minutes, washed twice in PBS, and suspended in PBS containing 1% FBS for analysis by excitation at 530 nm and emission at 590 nm. Cells with active mitochondria accumulate red emitting “JC-1 aggregates”. In cells having depolarized mitochondria, JC-1 is present as monomers, which exhibit green, not red, fluorescence emission. In a second series of experiments, Mitotracker Orange CM-H2 TM Ros (excitation at 554 nM and emission at 576 nM) was added directly to the medium of treated cultures at a final concentration of 50 nM, and incubated for 10 minutes at 37°C. Hoëchst 33342 (excitation at 350 nM and emission at 461 nM) was added directly to the medium at a final concentration of 500 nM to reveal nuclear morphology, and co-incubated with the Mitotracker for 5 minutes at 37°C. Cultures were rinsed once with PBS and subsequently rinsed three times with fresh growth medium. Images were immediately acquired with an Axiovert 200M fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss). Cells with reduced Δψ m  are unable to sequester and oxidize Mitotracker Orange, and will exhibit reduced fluorescence emission.

PMID:26558359,A novel genetic- and cell-based tool for assessing the efficacy and toxicity of anticancer drugs in vitro.,"AIMS: To develop an in vitro tool for assessing the efficacy and toxicity of anticancer drugs using mixed culture containing both tumor and non-tumor cells. Such in vitro tool should have high application potential in drug-screening and personalized cancer care. METHODS: Fibroblasts were spiked as non-tumor cells into tumor cells of an established line. The mixed culture was treated with a test drug at various concentrations. After the treatment, DNA was prepared directly from the survived adhesive cells in the wells of the 96-well plates using a simple and inexpensive method, and subjected to digital PCR for measuring relative copy numbers of a target gene NF1 to that of a reference gene RPP30. The NF1 gene is known to be heterozygously deleted in these tumor cells while the RPP30 gene has two copies in both tumor and non-tumor cells. Using the NF1/ RPP30 ratios resulting from the dual digital PCR assay, the proportions of tumor cells were calculated for each drug concentration. RESULTS: Digital PCR confirmed that the tumor cells have only one copy of the NF1 gene while the non-tumor fibroblasts have two copies. By contrast, both types of cells have two copies of the reference gene RPP30. Using the ratio of the two genes, we successfully calculated the proportion of tumor cells which decreased as the dose of the test drug increased up to a certain concentration, indicating that the drug is more effective for the tumor cells than for the non-tumor cells in this dose-range. At the highest dose, we observed a slight increase in the proportion of tumor cells, likely reflecting the toxic effect of the drug on both tumor and non-tumor cells. CONCLUSION: This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of a genetic- and cell-based tool for testing efficacy and toxicity of anticancer drugs in vitro. The promising results suggest that additional efforts are merited, for further development since such a tool will likely have high application potential (1) in drug discovery where it enables simultaneously assessing therapeutic effect on target cells and toxic effect on non-target cells, and (2) in personalized adjuvant chemotherapy where multiple drugs can be tested in primary cultures derived from surgically removed tumor.",,Lan Kluwe; Wei Jiang; Ina Alster; Henning Hanken,"Biomedical papers of the Medical Faculty of the University Palacky, Olomouc, Czechoslovakia",2016-03,10.5507/bp.2015.057,abstract_only,False
PMID:24559228,Abnormal late visual responses and alpha oscillations in neurofibromatosis type 1: a link to visual and attention deficits.,"BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) affects several areas of cognitive function including visual processing and attention. We investigated the neural mechanisms underlying the visual deficits of children and adolescents with NF1 by studying visual evoked potentials (VEPs) and brain oscillations during visual stimulation and rest periods. METHODS: Electroencephalogram/event-related potential (EEG/ERP) responses were measured during visual processing (NF1 n = 17; controls n = 19) and idle periods with eyes closed and eyes open (NF1 n = 12; controls n = 14). Visual stimulation was chosen to bias activation of the three detection mechanisms: achromatic, red-green and blue-yellow. RESULTS: We found significant differences between the groups for late chromatic VEPs and a specific enhancement in the amplitude of the parieto-occipital alpha amplitude both during visual stimulation and idle periods. Alpha modulation and the negative influence of alpha oscillations in visual performance were found in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest abnormal later stages of visual processing and enhanced amplitude of alpha oscillations supporting the existence of deficits in basic sensory processing in NF1. Given the link between alpha oscillations, visual perception and attention, these results indicate a neural mechanism that might underlie the visual sensitivity deficits and increased lapses of attention observed in individuals with NF1.","Methods Electroencephalogram/event-related potential (EEG/ERP) responses were measured during visual processing (NF1 n = 17; controls n = 19) and idle periods with eyes closed and eyes open (NF1 n = 12; controls n = 14). Visual stimulation was chosen to bias activation of the three detection mechanisms: achromatic, red-green and blue-yellow. Methods Participants: recruitment, exclusion criteria and group characteristics Children and adolescents with NF1 were recruited in collaboration with the Genetics Department of the Pediatric Hospital of Coimbra in Portugal. All participants met the National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference clinical criteria for NF1 [ 22 ]. We excluded patients with known brain pathology or ophthalmological problems that could influence the results (for example amblyopia). Furthermore, in order to ensure that the patients included in the study had no unknown brain pathology (for example optic gliomas), they were submitted to magnetic resonance structural scans (magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition of gradient echo (MPRAGE) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences). Standard neuroradiological assessments were carried out by an experienced neuroradiologist. Only children and adolescents with NF1 but no significant structural anomalies, besides T2-hyperintensities, were included in the study. In addition, all patients were submitted to a complete ophthalmic examination, including best-corrected visual acuity, stereopsis evaluation, slit lamp examination of anterior chamber structures and fundus examination. Lisch nodules were observed in a subset of individuals but no anomalies that could affect vision were found. For the control group, we recruited typically developing participants from a local school. These participants had no history of learning, developmental, cognitive, neurological or neuropsychiatric problems. For analysis, we included 17 patients and 19 control children and adolescents. The EEG file of one participant with NF1 recorded during the achromatic stimulation experiment was corrupted leaving 16 participants with NF1 in the analysis of the response elicited by achromatic stimulation. For the second part of the protocol (analysis of alpha amplitude under eyes open and eyes closed conditions), only a subgroup of participants were available to participate (NF1 n = 12; control n = 14). The age and sex ratios of the two groups were not significantly different ( t -tests were used for age comparisons and chi-square tests for sex ratio comparisons), both for the groups tested in the visual stimulation experiment (mean age ± standard deviation (age range) in years: NF1 = 11.9 ± 2.3 (8 to 17), control = 12.9 ± 2.6 (8 to 17); sex ratio (F/M): NF1 = 12/5, control = 11/8) and for the subgroups tested in the eyes open/eyes closed experiment (mean age ± standard deviation (age range) in years: NF1 = 12.7 ± 2.0 (10 to 16), control = 13.1 ± 2.3 (10 to 17); sex ratio (F/M): NF1 = 9/3, control = 9/5). The genetic and neuropsychological characterization of this group of children and adolescents with NF1 was reported in our previous study [ 8 ]. We administered the Portuguese adapted version of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-III), in all participants with NF1 and in a subgroup of control children and adolescents (n = 8). The mean (standard deviation) full-scale IQ for the NF1 group was 97 (16), while for the subgroup of control participants it was 124 (17). Four of the patients with NF1 had been previously diagnosed with ADHD and were managed with stimulant medication (methylphenidate). These children were not given the medication on the days of testing, ensuring that they were not under the influence of methylphenidate during testing. Protocol approvals and patient consents The study was conducted in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committees of the Faculty of Medicine of Coimbra and of the Children’s Hospital of Coimbra. Written informed consent was obtained from the legal representatives of the participants, after explanation of the nature and possible consequences of the study. In addition, all participants gave written or oral informed consent. Visual stimulation The visual stimuli used were adapted from our previous study [ 23 ]. Stimuli were generated with MATLAB (R2008a, MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) and presented with the stimulation software STIM 2  (Neuroscan, Charlotte, NC, USA) with a display resolution of 1,280 × 1,024 × 32 and graphic processing unit NVIDIA GeForce 6600, provided by Neuroscan. The stimuli were presented in a CRT monitor (Diamond Digital color monitor, Mitsubishi Electric Australia, Rydalmere, NSW, Australia) with the refresh rate set at 85 Hz. Stimuli were circular horizontal Gabors (sinewave gratings modulated by a Gaussian window) presented in phase reversal mode at the centre of the CRT monitor (Figure  1 A). Stimuli diameter, defined as two times the standard deviation of the Gaussian aperture filter, was 12° of visual angle. The viewing distance was 1 m and the screen subtended a visual angle of 21° in width and 16° in height. Stimuli chromatic calibration was achieved by the procedure described before [ 23 ]. The achromatic stimuli were composed of luminance modulations. The chromatic stimuli were isoluminant (red-green or blue-yellow) composed of only chromaticity modulations. The mean luminance of the stimuli and background was 39 cd/m 2  with the Commission Internationale de l’Éclairage (CIE 1931) x- and y-coordinates x = y = 0.29. Stimulus chromaticities were defined, as in our previous study [ 23 ], using a three-dimensional cone contrast space in which each axis represents the activation of the long-wavelength (L), middle-wavelength (M) and short-wavelength (S) cone types, normalized with respect to the white background (cone contrast) [ 24 - 26 ]. These three cone types are the photoreceptors present in the human retina responsible for color vision. Stimulus contrasts were calculated as the length of the vectors in cone contrast space and expressed as a percentage of the maximum contrast used for each stimulus type. The CIE x- and y-coordinates of our stimuli were as follows: background and achromatic stimuli, x = y = 0.29; +S cone, x = 0.26, y = 0.21 and –S cone, x = 0.36, y = 0.51; L-M cone, x = 0.33, y = 0.28 and M-L cone, x = 0.23, y = 0.32.

(B)  Experimental protocol used for measurements of visual evoked potentials (VEPs).  (C)  The three different levels of luminance of the fixation square, shown here on the red-green stimulus. The participants had to detect a brief change in the luminance of this square from the reference luminance to a lighter or darker grey. To enhance the relative isolation of the different detection mechanisms, we used stimuli with distinct spatiotemporal criteria. Differences in temporal rates are necessary due to the need to differentially recruit neural populations with different tuning properties: the achromatic channel is highly sensitive to low-spatial and high-temporal frequencies, while the two chromatic channels, red-green and blue-yellow, are more sensitive to low-temporal and high-spatial frequencies. Achromatic stimulus parameters: spatial frequency, 0.5 cycles per degree (cpd); reversal rate, 10 reversals per second (rev/s; full cycling rate, 5 Hz). Red-green and blue-yellow stimuli parameters: spatial frequency, 2 cpd; reversal rate, 2 rev/s (full cycling rate, 1 Hz). Experimental protocol: visual evoked potential measurements During EEG recording, stimuli presentation was divided into runs of around 4 minutes. Participants were allowed to rest in between runs as necessary. During each run, only one type of stimulus was presented (achromatic, red-green or blue-yellow stimulation). Within the run, stimulus contrast changed randomly every 3 seconds. We recorded two 4-minute segments probing the blue-yellow mechanism, three 4-minute segments probing the red-green mechanism and one 4-minute segment probing the achromatic mechanism. We recorded more trials in the red-green condition because the maximum chromatic (cone) contrast used for the red-green stimuli was considerably smaller than the chromatic contrast used in the blue-yellow stimulation, resulting in reduced signal-to-noise in this condition. This difference in chromatic contrast was unavoidable due to the constraints resulting from the isoluminance requirements. Increasing the number of trials increased signal-to-noise ratio in this condition. The achromatic stimulation with its higher temporal frequency (5× more) allowed the inclusion of more trials in a smaller time window. The order of the runs was fixed for all participants: red-green, blue-yellow, achromatic, red-green, blue-yellow and red-green (Figure  1 B). In total, for the achromatic, red-green and blue-yellow conditions, we recorded 420, 306 and 210 phase-reversals per stimulus contrast, respectively. The choice of the number of trials recorded per condition was based on our previous study on within condition comparisons with these type of stimuli [ 23 ]. The participants sat comfortably 1 m from the computer screen and were requested to fixate a small grey square on the centre of the screen (width = 0.16° of visual angle). In order to help maintain fixation and to keep the participant’s attention stable throughout the EEG recording session, the children were engaged in a detection task involving the detection of a luminance change of the central fixation square that occurred at intervals with randomly defined durations with a minimum of 3 seconds and a maximum of 10 seconds. This procedure enabled the assessment of fixation reliability by generating a sufficient number of trials where correct responses were only possible when fixation was on the central square. During EEG recording, the luminance of the square changed either to a higher value or to a lower value and after 500 ms the square’s luminance returned to its initial value (Figure  1 C). The participants were requested to detect this brief change and report through button presses the type of polarity change in luminance: with left index finger if the change was to a lighter square (luminance increase) or with right index finger if change was to a darker square (luminance decrease). An initial training period ensured all participants understood the task and were able to discriminate between the different levels of luminance. The luminance differences used were above detection threshold for all participants. Although the detection task was superimposed on the visual stimuli of interest, we believe these events did not significantly affect the measured VEPs because the number of times that the fixation square changed luminance during the EEG recording was small in comparison with the number of contrast phase reversals (less than 8% of the times for red-green and blue-yellow stimulation and less than 2% for the achromatic stimulation). Experimental protocol: eyes-closed and eyes-open resting conditions The participants sat comfortably 1 m from the computer screen and alternated between 2-minute periods of eyes closed or eyes open. A brief (50 ms duration including 15 ms rise- and fall-times) 1,000 Hz 80 dB tone signaled when to close or open the eyes. The protocol lasted 12 minutes starting with a 2-minute eyes-closed period. During the eyes-open condition, participants were instructed to visually fixate the grey square presented on the centre of the screen in front of them showing the same grey background and fixation square used in the VEP measurements. Data acquisition and analysis EEG signal was recorded from six parieto-occipital channels (PO3, POZ, PO4, O1, OZ and O2) using a 64-channel Neuroscan system with scalp electrodes placed according to the International 10–20 electrode placement standard and with reference between CPZ and CZ and ground between FPZ and FZ. The same reference channel was used for acquisition and data analysis. Acquisition rate was 1,000 Hz. Vertical and horizontal electrooculograms were recorded in order to correct and/or reject artifacts caused by blinking and eye movements. A trigger pulse was generated at the onset of each stimulus (at each phase reversal, during visual stimulation, or at the acoustic signal to close or open the eyes). Data analysis was performed with Scan 4.5 (Neuroscan). We started the analysis by correcting the eye blinking artifacts present in the EEG recordings using an automated procedure available in Scan 4.5 that consisted of the following processing steps. First, an average of the EEG signal locked with eye blinks was created for every subject for each stimulation type (blinks were identified in the VEO channel as events where the EEG signal went below −100 μV). Using spatial principal component analysis on the average signal we extracted the spatial component topography and time series associated with the blinking artifact. Then, we filtered it out of the data, leaving the EEG signal with negligible eye blinking contamination. On the EEG recordings corrected for eye blinking artifacts, we applied a bandpass filter with cutoff frequencies of 1 and 100 Hz and attenuation of 12 dB/octave. Filtering was performed using the Zero Phase Shift option available in Scan 4.5, consisting of the application of a forward Butterworth filter followed by a reverse Butterworth. Filtering twice, once in each direction, is important to null the effect of filtering on the evoked potential peak latencies. In order to ensure that the artifact correction had indeed corrected the blink artifacts, all the continuous files were then visually inspected and periods with remaining eye blinking or other muscle artifacts were manually rejected. The filtered files were cut into epochs. The epochs of the signal elicited by the achromatic stimuli were 600 ms long (six phase reversals), non-overlapping and starting at the beginning of a cycle (at the phase reversal). Given that we were measuring a steady-state response, the achromatic baseline was determined as the average value of the entire sweep ranging from stimulus onset until 600 ms after, that is, our baseline represents the mean amplitude of three temporal cycles of the achromatic stimulus. The epochs of the signals elicited by the red-green and blue-yellow stimuli were 500 ms long, starting 100 ms before phase reversal and finishing 400 ms after. Baseline was set from −100 ms to the onset of the stimulus (0 ms). Further artifact rejections were then conducted automatically on the basis of deflections with amplitude higher than 100 μV. After artifact rejection, the average number of artifact-free epochs per contrast level remaining was: (mean ± standard deviation) achromatic stimulation, NF1 = 69 ± 1, CNT = 69 ± 1; red-green stimulation, NF1 = 294 ± 23, CNT = 301 ± 4 and blue-yellow stimulation, NF1 = 205 ± 4, CNT = 207 ± 3. There was no significant group differences concerning the number of epochs used (nonparametric comparison given the non-normal distribution of the data; Mann–Whitney U test,  P  >0.05). For time-domain analyses, we averaged the VEP data across the six recorded electrodes (PO3, POZ, PO4, O1, OZ and O2) before peak analyses. For frequency analyses, spectral amplitudes and peak frequencies were calculated for each electrode and these data were then averaged across the six electrodes before statistical analyses. Pooling data across electrodes has the advantage of increasing signal-to-noise ratio. Time domain analysis: visual evoked potentials In order to study the VEPs elicited by the different visual stimuli, we averaged the EEG signals of the epochs associated with each stimulus type and each stimulus contrast. Note that, for the calculation of the VEPs elicited by red-green and blue-yellow stimuli, both phases of the stimulation cycle were averaged together. The fast reversal rate of the achromatic stimulation induced steady-state VEPs, while the slower temporal frequency of the chromatic stimulation elicited transient VEPs. Steady-state VEPs are elicited when a repetitive visual stimulus is presented at a rate higher than 4 Hz, inducing a continuous sequence of oscillatory potential changes in the visual cortex [ 27 ]. Transient VEPs are elicited by abrupt visual changes with stimulation frequencies lower than 4 Hz and are typically comprised by a sequence of positive and negative deflections with return to pre-stimulus potential. The signal strength of the achromatic responses was calculated based on the mean amplitude of the rectified wave within a stimulus cycle, that is, the area under the rectified VEP divided by the corresponding time interval (600 ms). The mean amplitude of the total response cycle was chosen as an alternative measurement to peak amplitudes given the difficulty in separating the individual peaks composing steady-state VEPs. Area under the curve (AUC) measurements of event-related potentials (ERPs) have been suggested as a valid alternative that diminishes the effect of trial-to-trial differences in ERPs’ latencies [ 28 ]. In here, AUC measurements were assumed to reflect the average of the amplitude of the bioelectrical signals elicited over occipito-parietal regions by the achromatic stimulation. For the red-green and blue-yellow responses, we calculated the amplitudes and latencies of the peaks of the average signals by programming the Scan 4.5 software to automatically find the maximum of the waves within defined time windows: red-green, P1 maximum between 50 and 100 ms after stimulus phase reversal and P2 maximum between 100 and 185 ms; blue-yellow, P1 between 70 and 130 ms and P2 between 145 and 205 ms. The peaks with latencies between 250 and 350 ms present in the chromatic VEPs appeared as positive peaks in the grand averages of the NF1 group and as negative peaks in the grand averages of the control group. To quantify the group differences in this latter part of the signal without including assumptions about the polarity or number of peaks/components (as for the steady-state analysis), we calculated the mean area of the VEPs within the interval between 250 and 350 ms, that is, the area under the VEP waveform divided by the time interval of interest. We named this response late component (LC). For illustration purposes only, grand averages were created and low pass filtered with cutoff frequency of 30 Hz (Figures  2 ,  3 ,  4 ). Figure 2 Achromatic stimulation: neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) mean amplitude of the steady-state visual evoked potentials (VEPs) evoked by achromatic stimulation was not significantly different from control levels.

Frequency domain analyses: amplitude of brain oscillations During sensory processing, several types of EEG oscillatory signals can be differentiated by their degree of phase-locking to the stimulus [ 29 ]. Induced or non-phase-locked activity is correlated with stimulus processing but is not strictly phase-locked to its onset. Evoked or phase-locked activity is strictly phase-locked to the onset of the stimulus across trials, that is, it has the same phase in every stimulus repetition. Non-phase-locked activity is markedly reduced in the average of all trials (as its timing jitters from trial to trial). Thus, isolation of the phase-locked activity can be achieved by calculating the Fourier transform of the average ERP (that contains mostly phase-locked activity). Isolation of the non-phase-locked activity can be achieved by removing the VEP (average of all trials) from the raw EEG signal for each trial, according to the procedure used by Engell and McCarthy [ 30 ]. Hence, for the analysis of the amplitude of the non-phase-locked brain oscillations elicited by the achromatic stimulation, for each stimulus type and contrast, we removed the corresponding VEP from each 600 ms individual sweep. The amplitude spectrum was calculated by averaging across the fast Fourier transforms (10% Cosine window) of all the individual sweeps (minus the corresponding VEP). To calculate the amplitude of the phase-locked oscillations for each stimulus contrast, we calculated the fast Fourier transforms (10% Cosine window) of the VEP. This resulted in spectra with a frequency resolution of 1.7 Hz. For each amplitude spectra, we calculated the mean amplitude within the following frequency bands: delta (1.67 to 3.33 Hz), theta (5.01 to 6.66 Hz), alpha (8.32 to 11.65 Hz), beta (13.31 to 22.29 Hz), low gamma (25 to 43.25 Hz) and high gamma (55 to 80 Hz). An equivalent procedure was used to determine the amplitude of phase-locked and non-phase-locked oscillations elicited by red-green and blue-yellow stimulation. For these signals, amplitude spectra were determined for the 500 ms sweeps used in the VEP analysis, resulting in spectra with a frequency resolution of 2 Hz. At each electrode, we calculated the mean spectral amplitude within the following frequency bands: delta (2 to 4 Hz), theta (4 to 6 Hz), alpha (8 to 12 Hz), beta (12 to 22 Hz), low gamma (24 to 44 Hz) and high gamma (54 to 80 Hz). Detection task: analysis of behavioral responses and calculation of the amplitude of pre-stimulus oscillations The number of correct and incorrect responses and misses were expressed as a percentage of the total number of trials and calculated as follows. If the participants responded with a button press between 150 ms and 3,000 ms after the luminance of the fixation square changed, the trial was considered a detected trial (hit). If there was no response within this interval then the trial was considered a missed trial (miss). Of the detected trials, if the participants responded correctly to the type of polarity change in luminance (to a lighter square or a darker square) then it was considered a correct hit, if the participant responded with the wrong button then it was considered an incorrect hit. For each type of stimulation (achromatic, red-green and blue-yellow) and for each type of response (correct hit and miss), we calculated the amplitude spectra by averaging the fast Fourier transforms (10% Cosine window) of each individual sweep containing the 1-second period just before luminance change. We did not analyze the incorrect trials as there were only a small number of these. In order to avoid significant differences in the number of sweeps of each condition (correct hits or misses), we enforced within-subject matching by removing sweeps from the condition with the highest number. Importantly, there were no group differences in the number of sweeps for each stimulation type (mean (standard deviation): achromatic stimulation, NF1 = 10 (5), CNT = 7 (4); red-green stimulation, NF1 = 25 (8), CNT = 20 (11); blue-yellow stimulation, NF1 = 21 (7), CNT = 18 (10)). For each amplitude spectrum (with 1 Hz resolution), we calculated the average amplitude in the alpha frequency band (8 to 13 Hz). Eyes-closed and eyes-open resting conditions After eye blinking correction, filtering and manual rejection of artifacts, as described above, the EEG data from each 2-minute segment (eyes closed or eyes open) were divided into 4-second epochs. Epochs containing any remaining artifacts were automatically rejected on the basis of deflections with amplitude higher than 150 μV, as were the first 10 seconds in each condition. For each participant in each condition, amplitude spectra were calculated by averaging the fast Fourier transforms (10% Cosine window) of the single sweeps, with a frequency resolution of 0.25 Hz. The average spectral amplitude was calculated from the following six discrete frequency bands: delta (2 to 3.75 Hz), theta (4 to 7.75 Hz), alpha (8 to 12.75 Hz), beta (13 to 29.75 Hz), low gamma (30 to 45 Hz) and high gamma (55 to 80 Hz). Alpha peak frequency was determined as the frequency between 7 and 12 Hz at which the spectra reached a maximum amplitude value. Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics, version 19, software (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). We verified the normality assumption for the different parameters using the Shapiro–Wilk test. All measures were normally distributed except the number of incorrect trials obtained from the analysis of the visual detection behavioral data. For the normally distributed data, we used, as appropriate, ANOVA repeated measures analyses, parametric  t -tests and Pearson’s correlation analyses. When the data did not meet assumptions of sphericity, the Greenhouse-Geisser correction was used. For the nonnormally distributed data, we used the Mann–Whitney test for comparisons between the groups. All repeated measures ANOVAs included clinical group (NF1 ,  control) as between-subjects factor. In addition, the following within-subjects factors were used: for the analysis of the VEPs’ amplitudes and latencies, stimulus contrast (five levels); for the analyses of the spectral amplitudes, spectral amplitude of the different frequency bands (six levels); for the analysis of behavioral data, visual stimulation type (achromatic, red-green, blue-yellow: three levels); for the analysis of pre-stimulus alpha amplitude, response type (hit ,  miss: two levels) and visual stimulation type (achromatic, red-green ,  blue-yellow: three levels); for analysis of the spectral amplitudes during the rest conditions, spectral amplitude of the different frequency bands (six levels) and the two conditions (eyes open, eyes closed: two levels).",Maria J Ribeiro; Otília C d'Almeida; Fabiana Ramos; Jorge Saraiva; Eduardo D Silva; Miguel Castelo-Branco,Journal of neurodevelopmental disorders,2014-02-21,10.1186/1866-1955-6-4,minimal,True
PMID:21352477,Motor deficits in neurofibromatosis type 1 mice: the role of the cerebellum.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominantly inherited disease, characterized by various neurocutaneous symptoms, cognitive impairments and problems in fine and gross motor performance. Although cognitive deficits in NF1 have been attributed to increased release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) in the hippocampus, the origin of the motor deficits is unknown. Cerebellar Purkinje cells, the sole output neurons of the cerebellar cortex, are GABAergic neurons and express neurofibromin at high levels, suggesting an important role for the cerebellum in the observed motor deficits in NF1. To test this, we determined the cerebellar contribution to motor problems in Nf1(+/-) mice, a validated mouse model for NF1. Using the Rotarod, a non-specific motor performance test, we confirmed that, like NF1 patients, Nf1(+/-) mice have motor deficits. Next, to evaluate the role of the cerebellum in these deficits, mice were subjected to cerebellum-specific motor performance and learning tests. Nf1(+/-) mice showed no impairment on the Erasmus ladder, as step time and number of missteps were not different. Furthermore, when compensatory eye movements were tested, no performance deficits were found in the optokinetic reflex and vestibulo-ocular reflex in the dark (VOR) or in the light (VVOR). Finally, Nf1(+/-) mice successfully completed short- and long-term VOR adaptation paradigms, tests that both depend on cerebellar function. Thus, despite the confirmed presence of motor performance problems in Nf1(+/-) mice, we found no indication of a cerebellar component. These results, combined with recent clinical data, suggest that cerebellar function is not overtly affected in NF1 patients.",,T van der Vaart; G M van Woerden; Y Elgersma; C I de Zeeuw; M Schonewille,"Genes, brain, and behavior",2011-06,10.1111/j.1601-183X.2011.00685.x,abstract_only,False
PMID:20624961,Neurofibromin regulates corticostriatal inhibitory networks during working memory performance.,"Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is one of the most common single-gene causes of learning disabilities. Here, we use behavioral working memory probes and electrophysiological studies in a mouse model of NF1 (Nf1 heterozygous null mutants; Nf1(+/-)) to demonstrate that (i) Neurofibromin regulates prefrontal and striatal inhibitory networks, specifically activity-dependent GABA release and (ii) is required for working memory performance, with inhibition-dependent working memory deficits seen in Nf1(+/-) mice. We find that increased inhibition in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is sufficient to alter persistent activity in a biophysical model of an mPFC microcircuit, suggesting a possible mechanism for Nf1(+/-) working memory deficits. Accordingly, working memory assays applied during functional MRI (fMRI) studies in human subjects with NF1 reveal hypoactivation of corticostriatal networks, which is associated with impaired working memory performance. Collectively, these integrative mouse and human studies reveal molecular and cellular mechanisms contributing to working memory deficits in NF1.",,Carrie Shilyansky; Katherine H Karlsgodt; Damian M Cummings; Kyriaki Sidiropoulou; Molly Hardt; Alex S James; Dan Ehninger; Carrie E Bearden; Panayiota Poirazi; J David Jentsch; Tyrone D Cannon; Michael S Levine; Alcino J Silva,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2010-07-20,10.1073/pnas.1004829107,abstract_only,False
PMID:33356508,C6 Cell Injection into the Optic Nerve of Long-Evans Rats: A Short-Term Model of Optic Pathway Gliomas.,"The optic pathway glioma (OPG) is a slow-growing brain tumor that arises along the optic nerve or its downstream connections and causing vision to gradually worsen with time. This tumor forms in children with a genetic condition called neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), causing tumors to grow on nerves. In normal conditions, glial cells are there to support and protect nerve cells but, in NF1-OPG, glial cells have a genetic defect and grow out of control forming a tumor called a glioma. There are no rat models of NF1-OPG that can be used to explore various treatment options, and mouse models make interventional studies difficult due to their small eye size. We have created a model in which to study the progression of tumor growth in the optic nerve and establish the anatomical and functional consequences of the model and determine its suitability to serve as a surrogate for human disease. C6 rat glioma cells were injected into the optic nerve of Long-Evans rats and allowed to proliferate for 2 weeks. The eye clearly showed proptosis and lens opacity was observed, likely due to increased intraocular pressure caused by growing tumors. Hematoxylin-eosin staining showed marked cellularity, with hyperchromatism and pleomorphism. There was prominent area of necrosis with neoplastic cells palisading around the penumbra. Immunostaining with markers such as S100, β-tubulin III, Foxp3, CD45, Vimentin, and Ki67 confirmed low-grade tumor formation, with a mild immune response. Our results show the utility of a surgically induced rat model of OPG that may be used for exploring various treatment options for NF1 ocular tumors.","Materials and Methods C6 Cell Culture C6 cells were cultured based on the protocol provided by ATCC (culture method, CCL-107, USA). Briefly, confluent T75, fibronectin (Akron)-coated flask (surface 75 cm 2 , vented cap, sterile, Nunclon Delta, USA) were washed with Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, without calcium and magnesium, Thermo Fischer Scientific, USA) to remove any trace of serum before treating with 0.25% (w/v) trypsin–0.53 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Flasks were observed under an inverted microscope and incubated for 5 min at 37°C to reach complete detachment of cells. Cells were then collected, centrifuged, and resuspended in 1 ml culture media containing F-12 K medium (ATCC-formulated, USA), 2.5% of fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), and 15% of horse serum (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Appropriate amount of the cell suspension was seeded into new culture flasks (usually 2 × 10 5  per flask). Once confluent cells were further detached with trypsin and frozen in 95% culture media and 5% dimethylsulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) until further experiment. Cell number and viability were estimated, after each passage, using Trypan blue (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and a hemocytometer (Countess™ II FL Automated Cell Counter, Thermo Fischer Scientific, USA). To prepare for injection, C6 cell suspension was prepared in HBSS at the 10,000 cells/μl. Optic Nerve Injection in Long-Evans Rat Twenty-four domestic rats of the Long-Evans strain (age 4 weeks with approximate weight of 150 g) were used as control and test recipients in the experiment. Rats were sedated using 2%–4% isoflurane (Abbott, Solna, Sweden), followed by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (40–80 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) combination for anesthesia. A drop of lidocaine (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was placed on surgical eye and artificial tears were used every 5 min to prevent dryness of eyes during the surgical procedure. Before starting rats were placed on stereotaxic frame with heating pad to keep them warm throughout the procedure. A 1-inch incision was made in the skin overlying orbital ridge using size 12 scalpel. Skin was retracted exposing underlying fascia, which was carefully dissected away. Utmost care was taken to avoid blood vessel, which could cause excessive bleeding and cotton swab was used to maintain hemostasis during dissection of fascia. Furthermore, with light traction on the conjunctiva while pulling eye downward out of eye socket superior orbital, muscle was exposed. Using a fine tip needle the muscles were teased out, which gave complete access to the optic nerve fascia. C6 cell suspension was prepared to contain 10,000 cells/µl and each test animal received 1 µl of injection using a glass micropipette of 105 µm diameter. The glass needle was mounted onto a micromanipulator attached to Hamilton syringe stand. After completion, the microneedle was retracted, and eyes were gently pushed back. The skin was sutured, and the animal was return to cage after full recovery. The research protocol was reviewed and approved by the Schepens Eye Research Institute Animal Facility and was in accordance with the Association for Research in Vision Ophthalmology Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. Tissue Processing Days 1, 5, and 12 were the time points to check the effect of C6 injection and its tumor formation ability. Both control and test animals were sacrificed by using CO 2  suffocation, and secondary step of puncturing major organ was used to ensure death. Eyes were enucleated by dissecting from the superior orbital side to obtain part or complete optic nerve and placed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 12 h. Tissues were subsequently treated with sucrose in increasing concentration (5%, 10%, and 20%) containing Sorensen phosphate buffer. One day before dissection eyes were transferred into sucrose: Optimal cutting temperature (OCT) solution (1:1) and, before mounting, with compete OCT media. About 15 µm sections were collected in poly- l -lysine coated slides. Histology and Immunohistochemistry Both control and test slides were examined using different stains. For histology, Thermo Scientific Rapid-Chrome H&E staining kit was used. This was 18-step process that permanently stains cytology specimens. Slides were dipped into series of solution containing 95% alcohol, distilled water, hematoxylin, Bluing reagent, and Eosin-Y stain followed by series of wash before final fixing step. Slides were then mounted and observed under upright microscope (Leica DM2500). Sections were stained with Luxol blue staining kit (Abcam ab150675, USA). Slides were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with Luxol blue solution for 2 h at 60°C, following which slides were rinsed with distilled water and differentiated by dipping into lithium carbonate solution. To develop further differentiation slides were dipped in alcohol reagent provided with the kit. For the final staining slides were dipped in Cresyl Echt Violet for 2–5 min following which rinsing and dehydration were performed before mounting the slides for visualization. For immuno-histochemistry (IHC) staining, cryosections from Long-Evans rats’ left eyes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS (Irvine Scientific, USA) at room temperature for 20 min. These sections were blocked and permeabilized with a blocking solution [Tris-buffered saline (TBS), 0.3% Triton X-100, and 3% goat serum (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA, USA,  http://www.jacksonimmuno.com )] for 15 min. Samples were then rinsed twice with 0.1 M TBS buffer for 15 min each time, mounted on polysine microscope slides and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C: S100-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (major protein expressed by C6 cells ), β-tubulin III-FITC (neurofibroma presence), Ki67-FITC (proliferation marker), Vimentin-antigen presenting cell (APC) (expressed by C6 cells 11 ), and Foxp3-APC and CD45 (immune response markers). After overnight incubation, samples were rinsed three times with TBS for 15 min. Secondary antibodies [goat-derived anti-mouse and anti-rabbit, 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-VioBlue] staining was performed for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were then washed a final time with TBS before being mounted on poly- 10 l -lysine microscope slides with low viscosity slide mounting medium. Digital images were obtained with an epifluorescence microscope using ×20 objective (Leica, DM2500). Electronic image files were processed using MATLAB software (MathWorks Inc., R2019a, USA). Flow Cytometry Assay of C6 Cells The phenotype of C6 cells was analyzed using flow cytometry with the MACSQuant flow cytometer (Miltenyi, San Diego, CA, USA). Cells were collected and fixed with Perm/Fix buffer (BD Biosciences, USA) at 4°C for 15 min. Cells were then washed in wash buffer (BD Biosciences, USA) and incubated, at room temperature, in blocking buffer (Pharmingen staining buffer with 2% goat serum) for 30 min. Blocked cells were seeded onto a flat bottom 96-well plate (polystyrene, Thomas Scientific, USA) and labeled overnight at room temperature with the following conjugated primary antibodies: S100-FITC, Vimentin-FTIC, CD45-APC, Ki67-APC, and GFAP-APC. Primary antibodies were diluted in 200 µl of antibody buffer (TBS, 0.3% Triton X-100, and 1% goat serum). After overnight incubation cells were washed three times for 15 min and incubated in secondary antibodies (goat-derived anti-rabbit and anti-mouse, DAPI-VioBlue), which were diluted 1:200 in antibody buffer (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratory, USA). Incubation was performed at room temperature for 3 h. Forward and side scatter and fluorescence signals from each sample were measured using the MACSQuant (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) flow cytometer. The results were analyzed using the MACSQuantify software ( https://www.miltenyibiotec.com ). For each primary antibody the DAPI-positive single cell population was gated. The ratio of positive cells in the gated population was estimated in comparison with blank and species-specific isotype controls. Image Processing and Analysis Seven randomly selected images were taken for each sample. To statistically analyze the field of view, an image processing MATLAB code was created, based on Otsu’s method  (thresholding algorithm). For each image taken, the code calculates (with a tolerance of 0.01%) the surface covered by the cells of interest (in images taken with ×20 magnification). The number of colored pixels (green for FITC channel and red for APC channel) were counted and a percentage of cell surface coverage was created. 12 Statistical Analysis All experiments were conducted in  n  = 5 set. Results and values are represented in all figures with mean ± standard error using GraphPad software. One-way ANOVA analysis of variance was used following Student’s  t -test for statistical analysis.  P  < 0.005 was considered as significant difference.",Deepti Singh; Pierre C Dromel; Tatiana Perepelkina; Petr Baranov; Michael Young,Cell transplantation,2020,10.1177/0963689720964383,minimal,True
PMID:24711647,ADAP2 in heart development: a candidate gene for the occurrence of cardiovascular malformations in NF1 microdeletion syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular malformations have a higher incidence in patients with NF1 microdeletion syndrome compared to NF1 patients with intragenic mutation, presumably owing to haploinsufficiency of one or more genes included in the deletion interval and involved in heart development. In order to identify which genes could be responsible for cardiovascular malformations in the deleted patients, we carried out expression studies in mouse embryos and functional studies in zebrafish. METHODS AND RESULTS: The expression analysis of three candidate genes included in the NF1 deletion interval, ADAP2, SUZ12 and UTP6, performed by in situ hybridisation, showed the expression of ADAP2 murine ortholog in heart during fundamental phases of cardiac morphogenesis. In order to investigate the role of ADAP2 in cardiac development, we performed loss-of-function experiments of zebrafish ADAP2 ortholog, adap2, by injecting two different morpholino oligos (adap2-MO and UTR-adap2-MO). adap2-MOs-injected embryos (morphants) displayed in vivo circulatory and heart shape defects. The molecular characterisation of morphants with cardiac specific markers showed that the injection of adap2-MOs causes defects in heart jogging and looping. Additionally, morphological and molecular analysis of adap2 morphants demonstrated that the loss of adap2 function leads to defective valvulogenesis, suggesting a correlation between ADAP2 haploinsufficiency and the occurrence of valve defects in NF1-microdeleted patients. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings indicate that ADAP2 has a role in heart development, and might be a reliable candidate gene for the occurrence of cardiovascular malformations in patients with NF1 microdeletion and, more generally, for the occurrence of a subset of congenital heart defects.",,Marco Venturin; Silvia Carra; Germano Gaudenzi; Silvia Brunelli; Guido Roberto Gallo; Silvia Moncini; Franco Cotelli; Paola Riva,Journal of medical genetics,2014-07,10.1136/jmedgenet-2013-102240,abstract_only,False
PMID:1605307,Adrenal medullary tumors and iris proliferation in a transgenic mouse model of neurofibromatosis.,"The expression of the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) tax gene in transgenic mice has been shown to result in the development of neurofibromas. Further characterization of these transgenic mice has revealed other significant pathologic similarities between this transgenic mouse model and human neurofibromatosis (NF). Pheochromocytomas of the adrenal medulla and hamartomas of the iris are well-recognized manifestations of human NF. Adrenal medullary tumors have been found in 68% of transgenic animals that were studied. They appear, however, not to be pheochromocytomas, but rather composed of undifferentiated spindle cells. Proliferation of fibroblastlike cells in the iris also occurs in one-half of the transgenic animals surviving more than 6 months. Melanocytes, however, have not been found in the transgenic iris lesion, although they are characteristically found in the Lisch nodules of human NF. The similarities between human neurofibromatosis and this transgenic mouse model (in which the overexpression of a single gene results in neoplasia) are discussed. This transgenic system may provide further insights into molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of neurofibromatosis.",,J E Green; A M Baird; S H Hinrichs; G K Klintworth; G Jay,The American journal of pathology,1992-06,,abstract_only,False
PMID:35332608,Re-evaluation of missense variant classifications in NF2.,"Missense variants in the NF2 gene result in variable NF2 disease presentation. Clinical classification of missense variants often represents a challenge, due to lack of evidence for pathogenicity and function. This study provides a summary of NF2 missense variants, with variant classifications based on currently available evidence. NF2 missense variants were collated from pathology-associated databases and existing literature. Association for Clinical Genomic Sciences Best Practice Guidelines (2020) were followed in the application of evidence for variant interpretation and classification. The majority of NF2 missense variants remain classified as variants of uncertain significance. However, NF2 missense variants identified in gnomAD occurred at a consistent rate across the gene, while variants compiled from pathology-associated databases displayed differing rates of variation by exon of NF2. The highest rate of NF2 disease-associated variants was observed in exon 7, while lower rates were observed toward the C-terminus of the NF2 protein, merlin. Further phenotypic information associated with variants, alongside variant-specific functional analysis, is necessary for more definitive variant interpretation. Our data identified differences in frequency of NF2 missense variants by exon between gnomAD population data and NF2 disease-associated variants, suggesting a potential genotype-phenotype correlation; further work is necessary to substantiate this.","2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Systematic compilation of missense variants Compilation of known  NF2  missense variants from human disease databases was conducted systematically, primarily by clinical and public database searches, followed by literature searches for published variants. Clinical database information was obtained from NF2 registries located in the Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine, St. Mary's Hospital, Manchester, England, UK and The University of Alabama at Birmingham, AL, USA. The publically accessible variant databases included were Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD) ( www.lovd.nl ) (Fokkema et al.,  2021 ), ClinVar NCBI ( www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar ) (Landrum et al.,  2018 ), the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) ( www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ac/all.php ) (Stenson et al.,  2020 ), Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer (CIViC) ( https://civicdb.org/home ) and Mastermind Genomic Search Engine ( https://www.genomenon.com/mastermind ). Details of duplicate variants were merged to retain relevant clinical information. A literature search was conducted through PubMed using combinations of the following MeSH terms: missense mutation,  NF2  gene,  NF2  gene product, DNA mutational analysis, central NF2/neurofibromatosis. A total of 124 unique publications were searched for novel variants. Figure  1  shows a flow chart detailing the order of variant compilation and numbers of variants included and excluded at each step. An extra literature mining step was conducted using LitVar to capture any missing variants (Allot et al.,  2018 ). A total of 395 unique variants were included within the study. Figure 1 Flowchart outlining variant compilation A subset of variants identified in patients with a confirmed Manchester Criteria NF2 diagnosis (Table  S1 ) or known NF2‐associated features, for example, unilateral VS, meningioma, ependymoma, were grouped for further analysis. A total of 97 NF2 disease‐associated variants were included, 69 of these variants appear in public databases, 17 were identifiable in the literature, the remaining 11 were exclusive to local databases and have since been submitted to public variant databases (Figure  1 ). Variants outside the exonic regions of the primary  NF2  transcript RefSeq  NM_000268.4  (isoform 1) were excluded from analysis, as well as variants described as nonsense, frameshifts, insertions, deletions, indels, and synonymous. 2.2 Variant classification tools Evidence for clinical classification of variants was obtained and interpreted following the ACGS best practice guidelines (2020). Classification scores and posterior probabilities were also calculated for each variant (Tavtigian et al.,  2018 ,  2020 ). See Table  1  for a summary of both the ACMG‐AMP (2015) and revised ACGS (2020) variant classification frameworks.

The  NF2  transcript RefSeq  NM_000268.4  was used for all in silico tool use. Variants were imported into the clinical prediction software Alamut Visual version 2.15 (SOPHiA GENETICS), in which multiple variant database information and in silico tools are embedded. Results from the following tools were exported from Alamut and factored into classification analysis: Align‐GVGD (Mathe et al.,  2006 ), SIFT (Kumar et al.,  2009 ), PolyPhen‐2 (Adzhubei et al.,  2010 ), MutationTaster2 (Schwarz et al.,  2014 ), SpliceSiteFinder‐like tool (Zhang,  1998 ), MaxEntScan (Yeo & Burge,  2004 ). Variant frequencies and ExAC constraint metrics were obtained from gnomAD v2.1.1 ( gnomad.broadinstitute.org ) (Lek et al.,  2016 ). UCSC LiftOver tool was used for any genomic co‐ordinate conversions between genome builds GRCh37/hg19 and GRCh38/hg38 ( genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver ) (Kent et al.,  2002 ). 2.3 Population and frequency data Maximum credible population allele frequency was determined using the alleleFrequencyApp ( cardiodb.org/allelefrequencyapp ) (Whiffin et al.,  2017 ), and was calculated to be 1.88e‐07 for NF2, based on the following input parameters: monoallelic inheritance, disease incidence of 1 in 28,000 (Evans et al.,  2018 ), allelic heterogeneity 0.01 and penetrance 0.95, accounting for the known rate of recurrent pathogenic variants and late disease onset. Strong benign evidence (BS1) was applied to any variants with an allele frequency equal to or higher than NF2 disease incidence (1/28,000). With a low maximum credible population allele frequency calculated (1.88e‐07), moderate pathogenicity evidence (PM2) based on frequency data was not applied to any variant observed in gnomAD as frequency values of observed variants exceeded this value. 2.4 Functional data With a predicted missense constraint Z score of 2.29 in ExAC,  NF2  is considered moderately intolerant of variation. However, only Z scores ≥3.09 are considered significant within the ACGS guidelines and therefore variants in  NF2  are ineligible for application of evidence for missense constraint (PP2). The DECIPHER database (Firth et al.,  2009 ) was used to investigate possible mutational hotspots or identify regional constraint within functional domains of the NF2 protein. However, no specific structural regions displayed significant association with missense constraint. Therefore, ACGS evidence of mutational hotspots and functional domains without benign variation (PM1) was not applied to any of the variants in this study. While functional work has been conducted and published on a number of variants included within this study, evidence from functional studies (PS3) was only applied to five specific variants as repeated and rigorous publications describing variant‐specific effects on protein function were available for them. No functional data from RNA analysis was available for variants predicted to impact splicing. 2.5 Computational data Multiple in silico tools were used for variant effect prediction; meta‐predictor REVEL (Rare Exome Variant Ensemble Learner) was used as the deciding score for evidence use (PP3 and BP4) if other tools were in conflict (Ioannidis et al.,  2016 ), as it is one of the best performing meta‐predictors (Wilcox et al.,  2021 ). REVEL scores ≥0.7 were considered pathogenic and ≤0.4 benign. ClinPred (Alirezaie et al.,  2018 ) meta‐predictor scores were also produced for variants, although were not included as evidence for ACGS variant classification. Splice prediction tools were also interpreted and applied as evidence, as suggested in the ACGS 2020 guidelines. Variants that received MaxEntScan (Yeo & Burge,  2004 ) predictions of >15% score reduction compared to reference allele, and SpliceSiteFinder‐Like (Zhang,  1998 ) predictions with >5% reduction, had PP3 computational evidence of pathogenicity applied in their classification. 2.6 Clinical information If phenotype was described, patients who fitted Manchester Criteria for NF2 disease (Table  S1 ) (Evans et al.,  1992 ; Smith et al.,  2017 ) were considered to have phenotypic specificity for a disease of single etiology (PP4), applied as supporting evidence of pathogenicity. Where possible, family history and segregation data was applied to the evidence framework. 2.7 Other databases COSMIC ( www.cancer.sanger.ac.uk ) (Tate et al.,  2019 ) was used in the investigation of variants that were observed in somatic samples. CanVar‐UK cancer predisposition gene variant database ( www.canvaruk.org ) was used in the search for further variant information, as well as links to structured search engine requests.",Katherine V Sadler; Charlie F Rowlands; Philip T Smith; Claire L Hartley; Naomi L Bowers; Nicola Y Roberts; Jade L Harris; Andrew J Wallace; D Gareth Evans; Ludwine M Messiaen; Miriam J Smith,Human mutation,2022-05,10.1002/humu.24370,minimal,True
PMID:15240917,Survival of Human Neurofibroma in Immunodeficient Mice and Initial Results of Therapy With Pirfenidone.,"Neurofibromatosis type I is a common tumor predisposing disease in humans. Surgical therapy can be applied only in selected patients with resectable masses. Hence, development of new therapies for this disease is urgent. We used human neurofibroma implants in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) as a model to test the toxicity and potential efficacy of pirfenidone, a new therapeutic agent. Two hundred twelve human neurofibromas were transplanted into various locations in 59 experimental animals, and 30 mice with implants received oral pirfenidone for up to six weeks. Survival of neurofibromas in animals treated with pirfenidone was lower than in the control group $(P=.02)$. Tumors did not change histologic appearance or vascularization in response to pirfenidone. Treatment with pirfenidone, a new antifibrotic agent, inhibits survival of some tumors without causing toxicity in animals.","MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals Mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) were
used as recipients of human neurofibroma
xenotransplants.  SCID mice have a deficiency in the
DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), which results in
inefficient recombination of DNA ends generated during
the course of antigen receptor recombination [ 15 ].
This defect blocks lymphopoiesis at early stages of T-
and B-cell development and prevents the mounting of
immune responses against the grafts. Two hundred twelve human neurofibromas were transplanted into
various locations in 59 experimental animals, 30 in the
epineurium of the sciatic nerve, and 182 under the skin of the
neck, back, and skin of the ear.  Thirty mice with implants
received oral pirfenidone for up to six weeks, and 29 animals
were monitored for survival of tumors without therapy. Human neurofibromas Human neurofibromas were obtained from four patients with
neurofibromatosis who underwent removal of plexiform neurofibroma
due to pain, compression, or other clinical indications.  One
tumor was described as a nodular plexiform neurofibroma, while
the other 3 had appearance of diffuse plexiform neurofibroma.
Tumor tissue that would normally be discarded was used for these
experiments.  Each tumor was initially evaluated by frozen
section histology, and if confirmed to be a neurofibroma, tumor
tissue was prepared for implantation.  The size of the tumors
ranged from 2 cm to 4 cm at the greatest diameter.  The
tissue was placed into sterile culture medium with an antibiotic
and cut into 2 × 2 × 2 mm (1–2 milligrams)
pieces.  Two hundred and twelve tumor fragments were obtained by
cutting neurofibromas originating from four different patients.
Tumors were weighed and measured by a caliper (two largest
perpendicular diameters) before implantation.  Part of the tumor
was evaluated by histology as described below. Surgical procedure Surgical procedures were conducted under sterile conditions.
Each mouse was anesthetized using 5% halothane inhalation
followed by 1%–2% halothane for maintenance. Tumor fragments
were implanted subcutaneously in the area of back, neck, and on
the posterior surface of the ear.  Prior to incision, the skin
was thoroughly cleaned with 70% ethanol and Betadine solution.
Incisions were performed longitudinally oriented on the skin of
designated areas. The implantation pockets were dissected with
microscissors. Care was taken to minimize mechanical trauma to
the graft. After implantation of the tumor grafts, skin was
closed with resorbable (Chromic catgut 5/0) suture.  We used
method previously described by Lee et al for implantation of
neurofibroma fragment into the epineurium of the sciatic nerve
[ 16 ].  Tumor implants were secured with a Prolene 8/0
surgical suture. Pirfenidone therapy Tumors were implanted in four different occasions, depending on
availability of the human donor. After the implantation of
xenografts from each donor, animals were randomized into two
groups.  Thirty SCID mice with implanted tumor fragments in
various body locations were treated with oral pirfenidone (at a
dose of 500 mg/kg per day).  Therapy was initiated the second
day after tumor implantation.  The remaining 29 untreated mice 
with implants from the same tumors were used as controls. Assessment of tumor growth The animals with tumor implants in the epineurium
and under the skin of neck and back were followed for up to
six weeks.  The survival and size of tumor implants in
subcutaneous locations were assessed by external palpation
through the skin of the neck and back and measurement of the
perpendicular diameters prior to tumor removal. Animals were sacrificed 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 weeks after tumor
implantation.  Neurofibroma implants were recovered,
weighed, and measured for the largest surface area.  Tumor
tissue was prepared for routine histology and
immunostaining.  The authors were masked to a treatment
status of animals at the time of tumor measurement to
minimize bias. Two animals with tumor implants under the skin of ear were
followed for twelve months without therapy.  Tumor appearance and
size of tumors were assessed by inspection and direct outside
measurement of the two largest perpendicular diameters and
calculation of area, using a caliper with 0.025 mm accuracy
(Skilltech, Hempe Manufacturing Co, Inc, New Berlin,
Wis) ( Figure 1a ). Measurements were performed two weeks 
after implantation and then monthly thereafter. Figure 1 (a) Viability of human neurofibroma xenograft in SCID mouse ear for 12 months after
implantation, without therapy with pirfenidone.  Human
neurofibromas confirmed by frozen section histology were cut in
2 × 2 mm pieces and implanted subcutaneously into the
ear of SCID mice.  Tumor size was assessed by inspection and
direct outside measurement of the two largest perpendicular
diameters and area calculation, using a caliper with 0.025 mm
accuracy. (b) Neurofibroma xenotransplants in the ear were stable
in size for twelve months after implantation. The line shows an
average size of four tumor implants in the ears, based on area calculation. Figure 2 Evaluation for content of collagen in human neurofibroma
xenografts in SCID mouse.  Sections from formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded tissues were stained with Masson's Trichrome
and slides were examined using a brightfield microscope.  Original
tumor tissue  (a) and the xenotransplant recovered 6 weeks after
implantation without therapy (b) or with pirfenidone
treatment (c). Samples from the original tumor and 6-week-old
implants were stained with Trichrome suggesting the presence of
similar content of collagen.  Tumors recovered from animals
treated with pirfenidone did not display difference in Trichrome
staining, suggesting that 6-week therapy did not influence the
content of collagen. Figure 3 Localization of S-100 in human neurofibroma transplanted
into SCID mouse.  Tissue samples from original tumors and from
human neurofibroma xenografts were snap-frozen, cryo-sectioned,

 pH  = 7.2, for up to 18 hours at room temperature (RT), then
embedded in paraffin using a tissue processor (model PTP 1530,
Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, Ariz). Sections prepared from
these blocks were placed on positively charged microscope slides
(Superfrost Plus, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, Pa). The
sections were then deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated
using graded ethanol solutions.  For immunohistochemical methods,
endogenous peroxidase was quenched by incubation of the sections
with 1.5%   H  in 50% methanol. 2 O 2 Human S-100 A and B protein was detected using rabbit antiserum
(Dako Corp, Carpinteria, Calif) diluted with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS),  pH  = 7.2, containing 5% bovine serum
albumin (BSA), and applied to sections.  The rabbit anti-S-100
antibodies were detected using affinity purified biotinylated
F(ab')2 swine anti-rabbit IgG (Dako), followed by horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Dako), both diluted in 5%
PBS/BSA. Specimens were counterstained with alum-hematoxylin
solution, dehydrated using graded ethanols, cleared in xylene,
and coverslipped with a synthetic mounting medium. Binding of  Griffonia Simplicifolia  (GS) lectin
I, isolectin B4 (IB4), a lectin which binds to Gal α 1-3Gal in porcine tissues, was
tested in tissue sections prepared as described above [ 17 ].
The sections were treated with a microwave-assisted carbohydrate
revealing (MCR) by incubating them with 75 mL of
10 mM citric acid,  pH  = 6.0, and subjecting them to
microwave at high power (800 watt, Panasonic, Secaucus, NJ) inside a beaker 
containing 400 mL distilled water up to 15 minutes. The volume was maintained at a
constant level during heating by the addition of distilled water
as required.  Sections were then incubated for 15 minutes at RT
within the residual solution prior to application of the lectin.
Fluorescein-conjugated IB4 (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame,
Calif) diluted in PBS,  pH  = 7.2, containing 5% BSA, was
applied to the sections at RT for one hour and then rinsed with

PMID:23239959,Partial Blindness to Submicron Topography in NF1 Haploinsufficient Cultured Fibroblasts Indicates a New Function of Neurofibromin in Regulation of Mechanosensoric.,"Cells sense physical properties of their extracellular environment and translate them into biochemical signals. In this study, cell responses to surfaces with submicron topographies were investigated in cultured human NF1 haploinsufficient fibroblasts. Age-matched fibroblasts from 8 patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1(+/-)) and 9 controls (NF1(+/+)) were cultured on surfaces with grooves of 200 nm height and lateral distance of 2 μm. As cellular response indicator, the mean cell orientation along microstructured grooves was systematically examined. The tested NF1 haploinsufficient fibroblasts were significantly less affected by the topography than those from healthy donors. Incubation of the NF1(+/-) fibroblasts with the farnesyltransferase inhibitor FTI-277 and other inhibitors of the neurofibromin pathway ameliorates significantly the cell orientation. These data indicate that NF1 haploinsufficiency results in an altered response to specific surface topography in fibroblasts. We suggest a new function of neurofibromin in the sensoric mechanism to topographies and a partial mechanosensoric blindness by NF1 haploinsufficiency.",,D Kaufmann; J Hoesch; Y Su; L Deeg; K Mellert; J P Spatz; R Kemkemer,Molecular syndromology,2012-10,10.1159/000342698,abstract_only,False
PMID:21963652,PET imaging for attention deficit preclinical drug testing in neurofibromatosis-1 mice.,"Attention system abnormalities represent a significant barrier to scholastic achievement in children with neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1). Using a novel mouse model of NF1-associated attention deficit (ADD), we demonstrate a presynaptic defect in striatal dopaminergic homeostasis and leverage this finding to apply [(11)C]-raclopride positron-emission tomography (PET) in the intact animal. While methylphenidate and l-Deprenyl correct both striatal dopamine levels on PET imaging and defective attention system function in Nf1 mutant mice, pharmacologic agents that target de-regulated cyclic AMP and RAS signaling in these mice do not. These studies establish a robust preclinical model to evaluate promising agents for NF1-associated ADD.","Materials and Methods Mice Nf1 +/− GFAP CKO (CKO) and control littermate  Nf1 flox/flox  (WT) mice were maintained on an inbred C57BL/6 background ( Bajenaru et al., 2003 ;  Brown et al., 2010a ) with  ad libitum  access to food and water.  Nf1+/− GFAP CKO mice are  Nf1 +/− mice (reduced  Nf1  gene expression in all cells in the brain and body) which harbor complete  Nf1  gene loss in GFAP-expressing cells. All experiments were performed on 3–4 month old mice under active Animal Studies Committee protocols. Independently-generated groups of WT and CKO mice were used for the baseline PET imaging studies ( Fig. 1 ), MPH and L-Deprenyl treatments ( Fig. 2 ), and Lovastatin and Rolipram treatments ( Fig. 3 ). Radioligand and compound preparation [ 3 H]-SCH23390, [ 3 H]-raclopride, [ 3 H]-Win 35428 (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences; Shelton, CT), [ 3 H]-WC-10, and [ 3 H]-a-Dihydrotetrabenazine ([ 3 H]-DTBZ; American Radiolabeled Chemicals; St. Louis, MO) were used as previously reported ( Xu et al., 2009 ). Quantitative receptor autoradiography 20-micron coronal sections were generated from flash-frozen brains and processed for autoradiography as previously described ( Xu et al., 2009 ;  Xu et al., 2010 ). Sections were incubated for 60 min at room temperature with [ 3 H]-SCH23390 (D1 receptors), [ 3 H]-raclopride (D2 receptors), [ 3 H]-WC-10 (D3 receptors), [ 3 H]-DTBZ (VMAT2), or [ 3 H]-Win 35428 (DAT) ( Frey et al., 1997 ;  Savasta et al., 1986 ;  Xu et al., 2010 ). Non-specific binding was determined following the addition of 1μM (+)-butaclamol, 1μM eticlopride, 1μM tetrabenazine, or 1μM nomifensine, respectively. Quantitation was performed using the Beta Imager 2000Z Digital Beta Imaging System (Biospace, France) and the Beta-Vision Plus program ( Xu et al., 2010 ). Small animal PET analysis Brain PET imaging was performed under isoflurane anesthetization. Mice were injected with ~200μCi of [ 11 C]-raclopride (~2500 Ci/mmol specific activity)  via  the tail vein and data acquired as 1h dynamic scans using the Siemens Focus F220 and Inveon scanners (Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc.). Acquired list mode data were converted into a 3D set of sinograms and binned into 5 × 60-sec, 5 × 2-min and 9 × 5-min time frames for processing using filter back projection algorithm with attenuation and scatter corrections. Using 5–60min summarized PET images and co-registered CT images as references, regions of interest (ROI) for the striatum and cerebellum were manually drawn with the software Acquisition Sinogram Image PROcessing using IDL’s Virtual Machine ™  (ASIPro VM ™ ) to obtain radioactivity uptake (nCi/c.c.) curves over time. Representative PET and CT co-registration images are shown in  Supplementary Fig. 1A and 1B , respectively. Logan DVR-1 (binding potential) analyses were performed using the cerebellum as the reference region, with a K2 value of 0.2 ( Logan, 2000 ). Drug treatments Mice received intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of sterile water (vehicle), MPH (20mg/kg; Sigma) or L-Deprenyl (10mg/kg; Sigma) the day before and on the day of testing, and evaluated 45min after last injection or injected once with MPH and tested immediately after injection ( Brown et al., 2010a ;  Vallone et al., 2002 ). Rolipram (5mg/kg/day; Sigma) was delivered via oral gavage for two weeks before testing ( Brown et al., 2010b ), while Lovastatin (10mg/kg; Sigma) was administered as a single injection 15min before testing ( Li et al., 2005 ). Behavioral studies Responses to a novel environment were evaluated over a 1h period using computerized photobeam instrumentation as previously described ( Brown et al., 2010a ;  Vallone et al., 2002 ). General ambulatory activity (total ambulations or whole body movements) and vertical rearing, a component of non-selective attention (i.e., orienting) were quantified. Mice used for the behavioral studies were the same mice examined by PET imaging. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting Western blots and immunohistochemistr y  (IHC) using DARPP32, p-MAPK, total MAPK (Cell Signaling) and p-DARPP32 (Abcam) antibodies were performed as previously described ( Dasgupta et al., 2005 ). cAMP measurements were determined by ELISA ( Brown et al., 2010b ).

PMID:34155781,L-carnitine supplementation for muscle weakness and fatigue in children with neurofibromatosis type 1: A Phase 2a clinical trial.,"Reduced muscle tone, muscle weakness, and physical fatigue can impact considerably on quality of life for children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Human muscle biopsies and mouse models of NF1 deficiency in muscle show intramyocellular lipid accumulation, and preclinical data have indicated that L-carnitine supplementation can ameliorate this phenotype. The aim of this study is to examine whether daily L-carnitine supplementation is safe and feasible, and will improve muscle strength and reduce fatigue in children with NF1. A 12-week Phase 2a trial was conducted using 1000 mg daily oral levocarnitine tartrate supplementation. Recruited children were between 8 and 12 years old with a clinical diagnosis of NF1, history of muscle weakness and fatigue, and naïve to L-carnitine. Primary outcomes were safety (self-reporting, biochemical testing) and compliance. Secondary outcomes included plasma acylcarnitine profiles, functional measures (muscle strength, long jump, handwriting speed, 6-minute-walk test [6MWT]), and parent-reported questionnaires (PedsQL™, CBCL/6-18). Six children completed the trial with no self-reported adverse events. Biochemical tests for kidney and liver function were normal, and the average compliance was 95%. Plasma acylcarnitine levels were low, but within a range not clinically linked to carnitine deficiency. For strength measures, there was a mean 53% increase in dorsiflexion strength (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.89-60.75; p = 0.02) and mean 66% increase in plantarflexion strength (95% CI 12.99-134.1; p = 0.03). In terms of muscle performance, there was a mean 10% increase in long jump distance (95% CI 2.97-16.03; p = 0.01) and 6MWT distance (95% CI 5.88-75.45; p = 0.03). Comparison with the 1000 Norms Project data showed a significant improvement in Z-score for all of these measures. Parent reports showed no negative impact on quality of life, and the perceived benefits led to the majority of individuals remaining on L-carnitine after the study. Twelve weeks of L-carnitine supplementation is safe and feasible in children with NF1, and a Phase 3 trial should confirm the efficacy of treatment.","2 SUBJECTS AND METHODS 2.1 Study design and participants This open‐label, single‐arm, single center, Phase 2a clinical trial was designed to assess the safety and compliance of L‐carnitine supplementation in children with NF1. The trial was registered on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry with ACTRN number 12618002021257 (Study protocol:  https://anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?ACTRN=12618002021257 ). The study was approved and monitored by the Sydney Children's Hospital Network Human Research Ethics Committee (reference no. HREC/18/SCHN/288). Participants were children between 8 and 12 years of age that fulfilled: (1) the National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference diagnostic criteria for NF1, (2) reported a history of muscle weakness and/or physical fatigue, and (3) were naïve to L‐carnitine supplementation. The clinic provides NF1 specialist services to children in the Greater Sydney Metropolitan Region. Prior to the initial assessment, a medical history of all participants was obtained from the parent(s), and the participant's medical file. Participants were excluded from the study if they met any of the following criteria: (1) severe cognitive impairment, (2) insufficient English, (3) seizures, (4) skeletal abnormalities, e.g. tibial bowing and pseudarthrosis, acute foot or lower limb injuries, e.g. fracture and ankle sprain, or (5) incapacity to comply with a research protocol, e.g. prolonged absence. Written informed consent was obtained from all parents and assent from children as developmentally appropriate. 2.2 Procedures All participants were allocated a daily dose of 1000 mg Levocarnitine tartrate (Musashi, Vitaco Health Australia Pty Ltd). Hard capsules (500 mg) were consumed twice daily for 12 weeks. The families were instructed to provide the children with the capsules at breakfast and dinner time, roughly 10 h apart. L‐carnitine is an over‐the‐counter nutraceutical supplement taken to improve fatty acid oxidation and energy production. L‐carnitine supplementation is used to treat primary carnitine deficiency. However, as L‐carnitine supplementation had never been previously clinically trialed in NF1, we started the first three participants 1 month apart. As there were no adverse events in these children, the remaining three participants were started on L‐carnitine supplementation at fortnightly intervals. L‐carnitine was dispensed from the Pharmacy Department of The Children's Hospital at Westmead. Functional assessments and questionnaires were carried out at the Kids Research Clinical Research Centre, The Children's Hospital at Westmead. A trained clinical evaluator took all functional assessments in the same order at baseline (0 weeks) and end of study (12 weeks). Questionnaires were completed by the parents at baseline and 12‐weeks posttreatment. Blood was collected and analyzed by the Pathology Department of The Children's Hospital at Westmead. Blood samples were collected at baseline and 12‐weeks posttreatment, and urine was collected at 12 weeks. Participants were given the option to continue L‐carnitine supplementation at their own cost after the study endpoint (12 weeks), and were followed up after 3 months. The participants were asked whether they chose to continue L‐carnitine treatment, and what their regimen was. They were also asked to complete the same set of questionnaires after this period. 2.3 Outcome measures The primary outcome measures for this study were safety and compliance. Safety was primarily analyzed by adverse event self‐reporting. A weekly phone call was made to each participant's family to ensure any safety concerns or adverse events were expressed. Additionally, there were three in‐person consultations for each participant, which were scheduled prior to each functional assessment. Biochemical safety assessments included plasma liver function ( Supporting Table 1 ), urine chemistry ( Supporting Table 2 ), circulating triglycerides and cholesterols, and acylcarnitine profiling ( Supporting Table 3 ). At the final consultation, participants returned any remaining capsules. The numbers of remaining capsules were counted to assess their compliance. The intervention was declared safe and feasible if: (1) no more than one of the six participants withdrew due to experiencing an adverse event attributable to treatment, and (2) at least four of the six participants were able to complete at least 75% of the prescribed dose of treatment and comply with study requirements. Secondary outcomes were functional assessments, including body fat, measures of muscle strength (grip, dorsiflexion and plantarflexion), gait, power (long jump), fine motor function (hand writing speed test), gross motor function (6 minute‐walk‐test [6MWT]) and quality of life (Pediatric Quality of Life and Child Behavior Checklist for ages 6–18). Body fat was measured using the MC‐780MA Tanita Tokyo body composition analyzer. The MC‐780MA body composition analyzer divides the human body into five sections; left leg, right leg, trunk, left arm, and right arm, measuring impedance by a tetrapolar 8‐point tactile electrode at 50 kHz. Maximal isometric strength of three muscle groups involved in prime movements, including grip strength, ankle dorsiflexion, and plantarflexion were tested using hand‐held dynamometry by a trained clinical evaluator (Citec; CIT Tehcnics, Harren, the Netherlands). To meet the independence requirements for statistical analysis, the measurements from only the dominant limb were included for each participant, and this was kept consistent for every study visit (Menz,  2004 ). Three repetitions were performed per muscle group, and an average measurement of strength was determined from this. Gait was assessed by heel and toe walking, which was scored on a 3‐point scale of difficulty: “no,” “some,” and “yes” to further examine dorsiflexion and plantarflexion strength. Power was measured by a standing long jump on a padded mat. Fine motor endurance was evaluated by the Handwriting Speed Test (Wallen et al.,  1996 ) that gives a raw score in letters per minute, and gross motor endurance by the 6MWT, which was completed barefoot on a point‐to‐point, 25‐m long, flat, straight, hard surfaced track. Quality of life was assessed by parent reported questionnaires, including the Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL™) Generic 4.0 and Neuromuscular (3.0) modules, and The Child Behavior Checklist for ages 6–18 or CBCL/6‐18 (©ASEBA 2020). The PedsQL™ Generic 4.0 module consists of physical, psychosocial, and total summary scores, and the PedsQL™ Neuromuscular 3.0 module consists of neuromuscular disease, communication, family resources, and neuromuscular total summary scores. Both are scored on a scale ranging from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating worse health. The CBCL/6‐18 (©ASEBA 2020) consists of 113 questions, scored on a 3‐point Likert scale (0 = absent, 1 = occurs sometimes, 2 = occurs often) that tests for empirically based syndrome scales. To fall within the clinical range of a syndrome scale means that the parent‐reported results from that questionnaire indicate their child clinically manifest the syndrome. 2.4 Statistical analysis We analyzed the treatment effect by calculating average % change from baseline compared to 12‐weeks posttreatment for all outcome measures for each participant ( n  = 6), and confidence intervals for improvement were also calculated. Spearman's rank‐order correlation efficiency was applied to determine a weight specific dosage effect. Participant functional assessments from baseline and 12‐weeks posttreatment were compared to reference data to generate Z‐score changes (negative Z‐score is indicative of motor impairment based on age and sex‐matched normative data). Hand‐dynamometry strength measures, long jump, and 6MWT were compared to reference data obtained from the 1000 Norms Project, an observational study investigating outcome measures of self‐reported health and physical function in 1000 healthy individuals aged 3 to 101 years (McKay et al.,  2016 ). Handwriting speed was compared to normative data adapted from Cermak ( 1989 ) and Wechsler ( 1974 ). Height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) Z‐scores were generated using USCDC2000 reference data. 2.5 Role of the funding source This study was funded by the Children's Tumor Foundation (US).

PMID:38008284,Droplet Digital PCR for Fast and Accurate Characterization of NF1 Locus Deletions: Confirmation of the Predominant Maternal Origin of Type-1 Deletions.,"Neurofibromatosis type-1 is a genetic disorder caused by loss-of-function variants in the tumor-suppressor NF1. Approximately 4% to 11% of neurofibromatosis type-1 patients have a NF1 locus complete deletion resulting from nonallelic homologous recombination between low copy repeats. Codeleted genes probably account for the more severe phenotype observed in NF1-deleted patients. This genotype-phenotype correlation highlights the need for a detailed molecular description. A droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) set along the NF1 locus was designed to delimitate the three recurrent NF1 deletion breakpoints. The ddPCR was tested in 121 samples from nonrelated NF1-deleted patients. Classification based on ddPCR versus multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was compared. In addition, microsatellites were analyzed to identify parental origin of deletions. ddPCR identified 77 type-1 (64%), 20 type-2 (16%), 7 type-3 (6%), and 17 atypical deletions (14%). The results were comparable with MLPA, except for three atypical deletions misclassified as type-2 using MLPA, for which the SUZ12 gene was not deleted. A significant maternal bias (25 of 30) in the origin of deletions was identified. This study proposes a fast and efficient ddPCR quantification to allow fine NF1 deletion classification. It indicates that ddPCR can be implemented easily into routine diagnosis to complement the techniques dedicated to NF1 point variant identification. This new tool may help unravel the genetic basis conditioning phenotypic variability in NF1-deleted patients and offer tailored genetic counseling.",,Laurence Pacot; Manuela Ye; Juliette Nectoux; Ingrid Laurendeau; Audrey Briand-Suleau; Audrey Coustier; Théodora Maillard; Cécile Barbance; Lucie Orhant; Nicolas Vaucouleur; Hélène Blanché; Béatrice Parfait; Pierre Wolkenstein; Michel Vidaud; Dominique Vidaud; Eric Pasmant,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,2024-02,10.1016/j.jmoldx.2023.11.005,abstract_only,False
PMID:24932921,Neurofibromin deficiency-associated transcriptional dysregulation suggests a novel therapy for tibial pseudoarthrosis in NF1.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in NF1. Among the earliest manifestations is tibial pseudoarthrosis and persistent nonunion after fracture. To further understand the pathogenesis of pseudoarthrosis and the underlying bone remodeling defect, pseudoarthrosis tissue and cells cultured from surgically resected pseudoarthrosis tissue from NF1 individuals were analyzed using whole-exome and whole-transcriptome sequencing as well as genomewide microarray analysis. Genomewide analysis identified multiple genetic mechanisms resulting in somatic biallelic NF1 inactivation; no other genes with recurring somatic mutations were identified. Gene expression profiling identified dysregulated pathways associated with neurofibromin deficiency, including phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. Unlike aggressive NF1-associated malignancies, tibial pseudoarthrosis tissue does not harbor a high frequency of somatic mutations in oncogenes or other tumor-suppressor genes, such as p53. However, gene expression profiling indicates that pseudoarthrosis tissue has a tumor-promoting transcriptional pattern, despite lacking tumorigenic somatic mutations. Significant overexpression of specific cancer-associated genes in pseudoarthrosis highlights a potential for receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors to target neurofibromin-deficient pseudoarthrosis and promote proper bone remodeling and fracture healing.","MATERIALS AND METHODS Genomic analyses All samples were collected from individuals after obtaining written informed consent approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, the University of Utah, or Seoul National University Hospital. Five of the sixteen samples included in this study were reported previously with inconsistent results after genotyping four polymorphic markers (D17S1863, GXALU, IN38, and 3 NF1 -1) near the  NF1  locus ( 8 ). In this study, no sample showed evidence of LOH across all markers in the pseudoarthrosis compared to matched blood/saliva, and this method is unable to distinguish copy-neutral LOH from LOH caused by somatic gene deletion. DNA was extracted from blood or saliva samples (N=16), tissue harvested during surgical procedures performed as standard of care (N=11) or from cells cultured from surgical tissue (N=6); DNA was extracted from tissue and cultured cells for individual NF#10. Whole-exome capture was performed using either the SeqCap EZ Human Exome Library (Nimblegen, Basel, Switzerland) or TruSeq Exome kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) and sequenced using the paired-end 100bp protocol (SeqCap) or the paired-end 150bp (TruSeq) protocol on the Illumina HiSeq 2000/2500. Sequence reads were mapped using the Burrow-Wheeler aligner ( 9 ) and final alignments generated after multiple quality controls steps applied using the Genome Analysis Toolkit ( 10 ), Samtools ( 11 ) and Picard. Somatic mutations were identified after comparison to matched blood, saliva or iliac crest samples, amplified by PCR and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. When necessary, PCR amplicons were cloned into pcDNA3.1 vector (Life Technologies, CA, USA) to Sanger sequence individual alleles. Expression profiling Whole-transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) was performed using RNA extracted from cells cultured from tissue harvested during surgery, including iliac crest tissue haploinsufficient for  NF1  mutations and pseudoarthrosis tissue representing a mixed-cell population including  NF1 -deficient cells. Sequence reads were mapped to the human reference genome (b37) using TopHat. Low quality reads were filtered using Samtools and duplicates marked using Picard. Gene expression levels were calculated using BEDtools software. Differential expression analysis was performed using EdgeR software ( 12 ) implemented in the R statistical framework. Gene Ontology and Pathway enrichment were performed using Partek Genomics Suite software (Partek, St. Louis, MO). Quality measures of RNA-sequencing were investigated. Pairwise correlation of gene expression between control samples calculated using counts per million (CPM) ranged from 0.60 to 0.85 ( Supplemental Fig. 20 ). To measure reproducibility between sequence runs, technical replicates were re-sequenced for a single iliac/pseudoarthrosis pair (NF#6). Pearson correlation for gene expression was high for both iliac (r=0.9861) and pseudoarthrosis (r=0.9846) samples ( Supplemental Fig 21 ). As well, gene expression in both iliac samples from two individuals (NF#6 and NF#7) were highly correlated, with r=0.98 ( Supplemental Fig 22 ). Multi-dimensional scaling of all samples clearly distinguished control samples from all NF1 samples, and both iliac samples with  NF1  haploinsufficiency clustered together and separate from all tibia samples, which were less well clustered together ( Supplemental Fig. 23 ). Pseudoarthrosis samples clustered more variably, likely from differences in the fraction of  NF1 -deficient cells making up the total RNA pool (mixed cell population) or possibly due to true biological differences. Regarding the latter, we were unable to identify a somatic  NF1  mutation for the distantly clustered tibia samples (NF#8 and NF#9); these samples were excluded from further analyses. Cell culture The surgically removed iliac crest and pseudoarthrosis tissues from individuals with NF1 were digested overnight with collagenase at 37° C followed by removal of undigested tissue. Cells were pelleted and re-suspended in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) Alpha (Life Technologies, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma, MO, USA) and 1% antibiotic (penicillin/streptomycin) (Life Technologies, CA, USA) and cultured as primary cells. Cultured cells reached confluence with spindle-shaped morphology, consistent with fibroblasts. Confluent cells were washed with 1X PBS and harvested by trypsinization. Cell morphology was indistinguishable between control, iliac crest and pseudoarthrosis samples. Flow cytometry Cells were cultured to ~90% confluence and harvested by trypsinization. The cell suspensions were fixed using 16% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (Electron Microscopy Sciences, PA, USA) at room temperature for 10 minutes. After fixation cells were re-suspended in 100% ice-cold methanol, incubated on ice for 10 minutes and stored at −80° C. The fixed and permeabilized cells were thawed and washed with FACS buffer (0.5% BSA/PBS) and re-suspended at a final concentration of approximately 5×10 5  cells in 100ul. The cells were labeled with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-phospho-ERK1/2 primary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, MA, USA) using 1:50 dilution and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes protected from light with occasional shaking every 10 minutes. Following incubation, cells were washed and re-suspended in approximately 500µl FACS buffer (0.5% BSA/PBS) and analyzed by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry was performed using an INFLUX cell sorter (BD Biosciences, CA, USA). A 640 nm laser operating at 120mW was used for excitation. Fluorescence signals were detected using bandpass filters 670/30 nm set into Alexa Fluor 647 channel.",Nandina Paria; Tae-Joon Cho; In Ho Choi; Nobuhiro Kamiya; Kay Kayembe; Rong Mao; Rebecca L Margraf; Gerlinde Obermosser; Ila Oxendine; David W Sant; Mi Hyun Song; David A Stevenson; David H Viskochil; Carol A Wise; Harry K W Kim; Jonathan J Rios,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,2014-12,10.1002/jbmr.2298,minimal,True
PMID:40304934,Development of patient reported outcome measures assessing tumor pain intensity and tumor pain interference for individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 and plexiform neurofibromas: qualitative findings.,"BACKGROUND: Pain is a common symptom in individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) that often is associated with plexiform neurofibroma (pNF) tumors. To date, no patient-reported outcome measures have been validated specifically to assess pNF-related pain intensity or pain interference in this population. Such measures are sorely needed since pain is being considered as an outcome in clinical trials targeting reduction of pNF. The study aims were to: (1) obtain qualitative information from individuals with NF1 and pNFs about their pain and its measurement and (2) modify existing scales to assess pNF-related pain intensity and pain interference for NF1 clinical trials. METHODS: For this multi-site, qualitative study, 56 individuals (26 children, 6-16 years; 30 adults, 18-68 years) with NF1 and pNF participated in a focus group and/or individual interview about pain intensity and pain interference (concept elicitation) and also provided feedback about existing pain measures (Numeric Rating Scale-11 and Pain Interference Index) assessing these domains (cognitive debriefing). Four additional waves of cognitive debriefing interviews further refined the measures. Qualitative concept elicitation data from transcripts were coded, analyzed using NVivo software, and thematic analysis was conducted using both deductive and inductive techniques. Additional themes and systematic problems and suggestions regarding the measures were gleaned from reviewing the field notes and interview transcriptions generated by the cognitive debriefing sessions. RESULTS: Concept elicitation themes included descriptions of two types of pNF-related pain (chronic and episodic), variability of pain over time, varying ability to recall pain, lack of knowledge of pNFs, and the ways pain interferes with daily activities. Cognitive debriefing themes included information on how to rate pNF-related pain intensity apart from other pain; problems and suggestions regarding the measures included difficulty comprehending some items and preferences for alternative wording and formatting. Based on these qualitative results, the measures' instructions, items, and formatting were modified to create the PAin INtensity Scale for plexiform neurofibromas (PAINS-pNF) and the Pain Interference Index for plexiform neurofibromas (PII-pNF) for administration on a mobile app or web-based platform. CONCLUSIONS: The PAINS-pNF and PII-pNF are promising self-report measures developed using patient engagement to evaluate tumor pain intensity and pain interference in NF1 clinical trials. The second phase of the study to provide reliability, validity, and normative data for individuals with NF1 and pNFs ages 8 years and older is underway.","Methods For this multi-site, qualitative study, 56 individuals (26 children, 6–16 years; 30 adults, 18–68 years) with NF1 and pNF participated in a focus group and/or individual interview about pain intensity and pain interference (concept elicitation) and also provided feedback about existing pain measures (Numeric Rating Scale-11 and Pain Interference Index) assessing these domains (cognitive debriefing). Four additional waves of cognitive debriefing interviews further refined the measures. Qualitative concept elicitation data from transcripts were coded, analyzed using NVivo software, and thematic analysis was conducted using both deductive and inductive techniques. Additional themes and systematic problems and suggestions regarding the measures were gleaned from reviewing the field notes and interview transcriptions generated by the cognitive debriefing sessions. Methods Participants and settings Individuals ages ≥5 years with documented NF1, with a pNF (at least 3 cm on longest diameter by physical exam or 2D MR imaging OR ≥ 3 mL by volumetric MR imaging), and who could understand and speak English were eligible. Participants also needed to report experiencing recent pNF-related pain rated  ≥  3 on the 0–10 NRS-11 pain intensity scale or report taking prescription pain medication and with recent pNF-related pain rated  ≥  1 on the NRS-11. For the first wave of qualitative data collection, participants were recruited across 6 age bands (5–7, 8–11, 12–14, 15–19, 18–24, 25+) from four sites: National Cancer Institute (lead), University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital and Medical Center, and Children’s National Hospital. Subsequent waves recruited individuals ages  ≥  8 years with Waves 3–5 completed at the National Cancer Institute due to COVID-19. The protocol ( NCT02544022 ) was approved by each site’s Institutional Review Board. Age-appropriate informed consent and/or assent was obtained for all participants. Measures NRS-11.  The self-report NRS-11 has been used in numerous studies, including as a primary outcome measure, to assess pain intensity. This reliable and valid measure has been recommended for use in clinical trials by consensus groups and pain experts [ 11 – 13 ] and for individuals  ≥  8 years [ 14 ]. For this 0–10 scale (0 = no pain), the descriptions for a score of 10 vary widely across clinical practice and research studies [ 15 ]; thus, the investigators initially chose the commonly-used phrase “worst pain you can imagine.” They also generated initial pain questions based on clinical judgement and consultation with NF1 experts: Participants were asked to identify a pNF tumor and rate (1) the pain in that tumor at its worst, (2) their “overall tumor pain” at its worst, and (3) their “overall pain” at its worst – each over the past 7 days (Supplement 1). PII.  The PII is a 6-item questionnaire developed to assess the extent to which pain interferes with six different aspects of daily functioning on a 7-point Likert-type scale from 0 (not at all) to 6 (completely). The PII is a reliable, valid, feasible measure for chronically ill youth and adults, including those with NF1 [ 8 ] (Martin, personal communication, 2023). Participants completed either the child or adult self-report form (Supplement 2 and 3).",Nour Al Ghriwati; Kari Struemph; Staci Martin; Paige Little; Melissa Baker; Jason Levine; Cynthia MacKenzie; James Tonsgard; Elizabeth K Schorry; Karin S Walsh; Pamela L Wolters,Journal of patient-reported outcomes,2025-04-30,10.1186/s41687-025-00877-2,minimal,True
PMID:22961690,Phase I trial and pharmacokinetic study of sorafenib in children with neurofibromatosis type I and plexiform neurofibromas.,"BACKGROUND: Sorafenib targets multiple pathways thought to be crucial in growth of plexiform neurofibroma (PN) in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Sorafenib has been tolerated with manageable toxicities in adults and children with refractory cancer. We conducted a separate study in this population. Monitoring long-term toxicities such as effects on growth and obtaining additional pharmacokinetic data were of importance due to the young age and long duration of therapy seen in previous phase I trials in children with NF1. PROCEDURE: Children ≥3 and ≤18-year-old with NF1 and inoperable PN were eligible. Sorafenib was administered orally twice daily for consecutive 28-day cycles. Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined from toxicities observed during the first three cycles. RESULTS: Nine children enrolled, median age 8 (6-12) years. At the starting 115 mg/m(2) /dose (n = 5), two experienced dose-limiting grade 3 pain in their PN. At the de-escalated 80 mg/m(2) /dose (n = 4), approximately 40% of the pediatric solid tumor MTD, two had dose-limiting toxicity (grade 3 rash and grade 4 mood alteration), exceeding the MTD. At 80 mg/m(2) /dose, the median AUC(0-12 hours) at steady-state was 39.5 µg hours/ml. Toxicities appeared to correspond with decreases in quality of life (QOL). No tumor shrinkage was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Children with NF1 and PN did not tolerate sorafenib at doses substantially lower than the MTD in children and adults with malignant solid tumors. Future trials with targeted agents for children with NF1 may require a more conservative starting dose and separate definitions of dose limiting toxicities (DLT) than children with cancer.","METHODS Patient Eligibility Patients age ≥3 and ≤18 years with a clinical diagnosis of NF1 based on NIH consensus criteria [ 32 ] and presence of an inoperable measurable PN defined as a lesion of ≥3 cm measured in one-dimension that has the potential to cause significant morbidity [ 30 ] were eligible. Adequate organ function and prior therapy similar to previously published criteria were required [ 26 ]. Diastolic blood pressure within 95th percentile for age and gender, no anti-hypertensive medication, and ability to swallow whole tablets were required. The study was approved by Institutional Review Boards from each participating center. Informed consent and assent, as appropriate, were obtained according to local institutional guidelines. Drug Administration and Study Design Sorafenib was supplied by the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD) as 50 and 200 mg tablets. The starting dose was 115 mg/m 2 /dose BID with planned dose escalations to 150 and 200 mg/m 2 /dose, and de-escalation to 80 mg/m 2 /dose if the starting dose was not tolerated. No escalation beyond the pediatric solid tumor MTD (200 mg/m 2 /dose) was planned. Doses were prescribed using a dosing nomogram capped for a body surface area of >1.8 m 2 . In the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, each 28-day course was repeated without interruption. A 3 + 3 phase I dose escalation scheme was used. A patient was considered evaluable for MTD if DLT was observed at any time during cycles 1–3, or in absence of DLT, if at least 70% of the prescribed dose had been administered during cycles 1–3 based on adherence diary review and pill count of returned drug. Toxicity was graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0. DLT was defined as any grade ≥3 toxicity during cycles 1–3 excluding grade 3 nausea and vomiting of <5 days, ALT or AST elevations that recovered to grade ≤1 within 7 days of stopping drug. Persistent (≥7 days) grade 2 toxicities could be considered dose limiting if they are intolerable with standard supportive measures. A previously described algorithm for the management and grading of sorafenib-related hypertension was used [ 33 ]. The following skeletal changes were considered dose limiting: (1) femoral growth plate volume expansion on MRI greater than 2 times from baseline, performed centrally at the NCI [ 34 ]. (2) Patients with a >6% bone mineral density (BMD) decrease on lumbar spine dual-energy X-ray absorptionmetry (DEXA) scan relative from baseline and a BMD Z-score of <2.5. For patients with open growth plates, sorafenib was discontinued if <1 cm growth was noted prior to cycle 8, <2.5 cm growth in first 12 months, or <2 cm/year annualized growth velocity following the first year. Patients were monitored with history, physical, and laboratory evaluations (complete blood count and differential count, comprehensive chemistries including lipase and amylase) every other week during cycle 1, and then prior to cycles 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, and then every three cycles. Specific evaluations for skeletal toxicity included growth measurements, lower extremity scanogram, unilateral knee MRI for volumetric growth plate analysis [ 34 ], laboratory measurements of bone metabolism (serum calcium, phosphorus, bone specific alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, parathyroid hormone, vitamin D levels), and DEXA scan. Blood pressures were performed weekly during cycle 1, every other week during cycles 2–3, and then prior to each cycle. In between visits, the research nurse performed review of patient diary along with adherence questionnaire by phone weekly during the first cycle, every other week during cycles 2 and 3, and prior to each cycle. MRI for disease evaluation was performed at baseline, prior to cycles 4, 8, 12, and then every six cycles using volumetric analysis. A ≥20% increase in volume from baseline of at least one monitored PN was considered disease progression [ 27 ]. Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Studies Participation in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluations was voluntary. Pharmacokinetic analysis was the same as performed for the COG study. Initially, pharmacokinetic evaluation was designed to be performed after the first dose. However, based on observations from the COG trial that day 1 pharmacokinetics could not adequately estimate half-life, after the first patient, pharmacokinetic samples were collected at steady-state. One milliliter of heparinized blood was collected pre-treatment. The first steady-state sample was collected exactly 12 hours after the last dose of sorafenib on any 1 day after day 10 of cycle 1. The dose of sorafenib was given, and then samples were collected at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 hours after the dose. Sorafenib plasma concentrations were measured using a validated HPLC/MS/MS method [ 35 ]. Sorafenib pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using non-compartmental methods. The pre-trough concentration was also used as the 12 hours post-value based on the assumption that at steady-state the trough concentration should be constant. Pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Plasma VEGF and soluble VEGFR2 (sVEGFR2) were quantified at baseline and at steady-state on day 28 ± 1 of cycle 1 using commercial available human VEGF and sVEGFR2 immunoassay kits (Quantikine™, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Target lesions for DCE MRI were identified and imaging was performed on a 1.5T MR system (Philips Achieva, Best, The Netherlands). After three baseline unenhanced scans, gadopentetate dimeglumine (Magnevist; Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals, Wayne, NJ) was injected. A total of 23 phases were acquired at 30-second intervals. Post-processing was performed using CADvue software (iCAD, Inc. Nashua, NH) employing the Tofts pharmacokinetic model [ 36 , 37 ] to quantify vascular permeability as K trans  (the transfer constant) and k ep  (efflux rate) and initial area under gadolinium concentration curve (iAUGC) at 90 seconds. QOL was assessed with the PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales [ 38 ] at baseline and prior to cycles 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24. This 23-item questionnaire yields subscale scores representing physical, emotional, social, and school functioning and a total scale score. Raw scores are linearly transformed to a 0–100 scale, with higher scores indicating better QOL. At each study visit prior to cycles 2, 4, 8 12, and subsequently every six cycles, a research nurse collected sorafenib pill bottles to calculate adherence based on pill counts. Also collected at each study visit were patient diaries, where parents of patients recorded the dates and times of all doses taken, and reasons for any missed doses.",AeRang Kim; Eva Dombi; Kathleen Tepas; Elizabeth Fox; Staci Martin; Pamela Wolters; Frank M Balis; Nalini Jayaprakash; Baris Turkbey; Naira Muradyan; Peter L Choyke; Alyssa Reddy; Bruce Korf; Brigitte C Widemann,Pediatric blood & cancer,2013-03,10.1002/pbc.24281,minimal,True
PMID:39415595,Generation of a zebrafish neurofibromatosis model via inducible knockout of nf2a/b.,"Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF-2) is a dominantly inherited genetic disorder that results from variants in the tumor suppressor gene, neurofibromin 2 (NF2). Here, we report the generation of a conditional zebrafish model of neurofibromatosis established by inducible genetic knockout of nf2a/b, the zebrafish homologs of human NF2. Analysis of nf2a and nf2b expression revealed ubiquitous expression of nf2b in the early embryo, with overlapping expression in the neural crest and its derivatives and in the cranial mesenchyme. In contrast, nf2a displayed lower expression levels. Induction of nf2a/b knockout at early stages increased the proliferation of larval Schwann cells and meningeal fibroblasts. Subsequently, in adult zebrafish, nf2a/b knockout triggered the development of a spectrum of tumors, including vestibular Schwannomas, spinal Schwannomas, meningiomas and retinal hamartomas, mirroring the tumor manifestations observed in patients with NF-2. Collectively, these findings highlight the generation of a novel zebrafish model that mimics the complexities of the human NF-2 disorder. Consequently, this model holds significant potential for facilitating therapeutic screening and elucidating key driver genes implicated in NF-2 onset.","MATERIALS AND METHODS Zebrafish lines Zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) were maintained at 28°C, with adults on a 14 h light/10 h dark cycle. All zebrafish work complied with the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Transgenic lines used in this study were the ABWT (Zebrafish International Resource Center),  Tg(HOTCre:Cas9)  (a kind gift from Dr Wenbiao Chen, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA),  Tg(−7.2kb-sox10:mRFP)  and  Tg(U6x:nf2a/b-4sgRNA)  (generated at the Bronner laboratory, Caltech) lines. HCR and immunohistochemistry HCR v3.0 was performed according to the zebrafish protocol suggested by Molecular Technologies with several modifications. Briefly, methanol-fixed embryos were rehydrated by a series of methanol/PBS–Tween-20 solutions (2×100%, 75%, 50%, 25%; every step 15 min), washed in PBS–Tween-20 (2×10 min), depigmented by a bleaching mix solution (formamide, 20× SSC, 30% hydrogen peroxide and distilled water) under direct light, washed in PBS–Tween-20 (10 min), treated with proteinase-K (20 μg/ml) according to the age of the larvae, washed in PBS-Tween-20 (2×10 min), post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (20 min), washed in PBS–Tween-20 (3×10 min), pre-hybridized in 30% probe hybridization buffer at 37°C (60 min), and incubated with probes (2-4 μl of 2 μM stock per probe mixture) in probe hybridization buffer at 37°C overnight. All probes, hairpins and buffers were designed and ordered through  Molecular Technologies . The samples for histological analysis were embedded in agarose/Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound (Sakura Finetek, USA), sectioned (12 μm for embryo and larvae) and counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). pH3 immunostaining was performed on either HCR-processed or methanol-fixed embryos for proliferation assays. Briefly, HCR-processed embryos were transferred to 1× PBS–Triton X-100 (3×10 min), or methanol-fixed embryos were rehydrated by a series of methanol/PBS–Triton X-100 solutions (2×100%, 75%, 50%, 25%; every step 15 min), blocked with 10% donkey serum–1× PBS–Triton X-100 for 4 h at room temperature. The embryos were incubated in anti-pH3 antibody overnight at 4°C. The next day, the samples were washed in PBS–Triton-X100 (4×30 min) at room temperature and incubated in a secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A21202) for 4 h at room temperature. The samples were then rewashed in PBS–Triton X-100 (4×30 min) at room temperature. All whole-mount images were imaged with a Zeiss LSM 900 confocal microscope. For sectioning, we euthanized fish at 3 months post fertilization according to Caltech IACUC, followed by fixation with 4% PFA overnight, three once-per-hour washes with 1× PBSTw (1× PBS+0.1% Tween-20) and serial methanol fixation (25%, 50%, 75%, 2×100%) and stored at −20C overnight. Next, methanol-fixed fish were rehydrated by a series of methanol/PBS–Tween-20 solutions (2×100%, 75%, 50%, 25%; every step 15 min), washed in PBS–Tween-20 (2×10 min) and treated in 30% sucrose for 24 h, embedding in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound (Sakura Finetek, USA), and preparation of 16 μm and 50 μm sections using a Cryostat HM525 NX. HCR on sections was performed according to  Stundl et al. (2023) . Briefly, sections were treated with 10 µg/ml proteinase K at 37°C for 10 min, rinsed with 1× PBSTw and hybridized overnight at 37°C with 5 μl of 1 μM probe stock/300 μl hybridization solution. Anti-Sox10 antibody staining on HCR-processed sections was performed according to  Kamenev et al. (2021) . All histological section images were acquired with a Zeiss AxioImager.M2 equipped with an Apotome.2. Quantifications for meningeal proliferation ( Fig. 4H ), Schwann cell hyperplasia ( Fig. 5J,K ), and  nf2b  HCR signal in cranial neural crest cells and pLLn SCs ( Fig. S1L, M ) were performed using ImageJ cell counter feature by manually labeling the cells. The data were plotted using GraphPad Prism software. CRISPR-Cas9 strategy gRNAs for zebrafish  nf2a  and  nf2b  ( Table S1 ) were designed using  CHOP-CHOP . gRNAs targeting zebrafish  nf2a/b  were validated and cloned in the pU6(x):sgRNA#(x) vectors. All four guides were cloned into the final destination vector pGGDestTol2LC-4sgRNA ( nf2a/b -4sgRNA). The pU6(x): nf2a/b -4sgRNA vector and Tol2 transposase mRNA were injected into ABWT one- to two-cell embryos. Embryos were sorted at 3 dpf for cerulean expression in the lens and grown to adulthood. Two independent stable lines were established for the pU6(x): nf2a/b -4sgRNA transgene ( Fig. S1A,B ). For generating  nf2a/b  knockouts,  Tg(U6x:nf2a/b-4sgRNA)  fish were crossed with  Tg(hsp70:loxP-mCherry-STOP-loxP-cas9) , referred to as  Tg(HOTCre:Cas9)  fish. Then, 10-20 pg Cre recombinase mRNA was injected into the embryo. Heat shock was performed by adding 40°C E3 water, and incubation at 38°C for 15 min and 30 min was applied to embryos or adults, respectively, at the indicated stages. T7 endonuclease assay and premium PCR sequencing Genomic DNA was isolated from control and  nf2a/b  knockout embryos following the protocol described in  The Zebrafish Book . gRNA target regions for  nf2a  and  nf2b  were amplified using the primers listed in  Table S1 . T7 endonuclease reaction was set up according to  Lingeman (2017) . The digested products were then electrophoresed in a 2% agarose gel. Purified PCR products were sent for premium PCR sequencing to  Primordium Labs . At least 10,000 high-quality reads were analyzed for each sample using CRISPResso2 ( Clement et al., 2019 ). RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis and PCR RNA was isolated from zebrafish embryos using Nucleospin Triprep (Macherey Nagel, 740966) according to the manufacturer's protocols. cDNA was synthesized using a Superscript III First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1800051). PCR was carried out using the primers listed in  Table S1 . PCR products were electrophoresed in a 1.5% agarose gel. Protein extraction and western blotting Zebrafish embryos were dechorionated and deyolked in an ice-cold ringer solution. Approximately 100 embryo bodies were resuspended in 50 μl NP40 lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, FNN0021). The NP40 lysis buffer was supplemented with a 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, 05892970001). The embryo bodies were crushed using a pestle homogenizer and kept on ice for 15 min. The embryo bodies were homogenized again and kept on ice for another 15 min. The sample was centrifuged at 13,800   for 20 min at 4°C. The soluble fraction of cell lysate was collected in a fresh tube. The protein concentration in the soluble fraction was quantified using a bicinchoninic acid protein estimation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using known concentrations of bovine serum albumin as standard. Then, 30-50 μg of the protein was run on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were separated by using 25 mA per gel in the electrophoresis buffer. The resolved samples were transferred to 0.2um Immobilon-FL PVDF membranes (Millipore) (activated in absolute methanol for 30 s) using wet transfer (in transfer buffer containing 14.4 g glycine, 3.03 g Tris and 20% methanol). The transfer was carried out for 90 min at 300 mA at 4°C, and membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in 0.1% Tris-buffered saline with Tween-20 (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the blot was incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-merlin antibody overnight at 4°C. Subsequent to incubation with the primary antibody, the membrane was washed with 0.1% TBST and incubated with the corresponding secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (GE Life Sciences, NA934) at 1:10,000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed with 0.1% TBST and developed using ECL reagent (Millipore, WBKLS0500). Immunoblots were imaged using conventional chemiluminescent immunoblotting. g OCT imaging OCT imaging of the zebrafish brain was conducted using a custom OCT system, with details of the system described in a previous paper ( Kim et al., 2019 ). Briefly, the OCT system comprises a swept source operating at 1310 nm, offering a bandwidth of ∼93 nm and a sweep rate of 100 kHz. This setup affords an axial resolution of ∼18 μm (in air) and a lateral resolution of ∼30 μm. The euthanized zebrafish were placed in a Petri dish with a foam holder to secure their position. The custom OCT system, integrated with a camera and an indicator laser, assisted in determining the imaging position of the zebrafish. Three-dimensional OCT images were acquired, covering an imaging area of 9×9 mm. Zebrafish adult head histology The adult zebrafish heads for histological analysis were prepared as described in  Stundl et al. (2023) . Briefly, the samples were rinsed in distilled water, decalcified in Morse's solution and embedded into the JB4 resin [prepared according to the manufacturer (Sigma-Aldrich)’s instructions] at room temperature overnight. The next day, the infiltration solution was replaced by an embedding solution (prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions), placed into an embedding mold (Polyscience) and transferred to a vacuum chamber, which accelerated the polymerization (∼3 h). The resin block was sectioned at 7 μm, and sections were stained with Mayer's Hematoxylin.",Ayyappa Raja Desingu Rajan; Yuanyun Huang; Jan Stundl; Katelyn Chu; Anushka Irodi; Zihan Yang; Brian E Applegate; Marianne E Bronner,Disease models & mechanisms,2024-12-01,10.1242/dmm.050862,minimal,True
PMID:9136014,Isolation of mutations in the Drosophila homologues of the human Neurofibromatosis 2 and yeast CDC42 genes using a simple and efficient reverse-genetic method.,"Reverse genetic analysis in Drosophila has been greatly aided by a growing collection of lethal P transposable element insertions that provide molecular tags for the identification of essential genetic loci. However, because the screens performed to date primarily have generated autosomal P-element insertions, this collection has not been as useful for performing reverse genetic analysis of X-linked genes. We have designed a reverse genetic screen that takes advantage of the hemizygosity of the X chromosome in males together with a cosmid-based transgene that serves as an autosomally linked duplication of a small region of the X chromosome. The efficacy and efficiency of this method is demonstrated by the isolation of mutations in Drosophila homologues of two well-studied genes, the human Neurofibromatosis 2 tumor suppressor and the yeast CDC42 gene. The method we describe should be of general utility for the isolation of mutations in other X-linked genes, and should also provide an efficient method for the isolation of new allcles of existing X-linked or autosomal mutations in Drosophila.",,R G Fehon; T Oren; D R LaJeunesse; T E Melby; B M McCartney,Genetics,1997-05,10.1093/genetics/146.1.245,abstract_only,False
PMID:37246765,Ex vivo to in vivo model of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors for precision oncology.,"BACKGROUND: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are aggressive soft tissue sarcomas that often develop in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). To address the critical need for novel therapeutics in MPNST, we aimed to establish an ex vivo 3D platform that accurately captured the genomic diversity of MPNST and could be utilized in a medium-throughput manner for drug screening studies to be validated in vivo using patient-derived xenografts (PDX). METHODS: Genomic analysis was performed on all PDX-tumor pairs. Selected PDX were harvested for assembly into 3D microtissues. Based on prior work in our labs, we evaluated drugs (trabectedin, olaparib, and mirdametinib) ex vivo and in vivo. For 3D microtissue studies, cell viability was the endpoint as assessed by Zeiss Axio Observer. For PDX drug studies, tumor volume was measured twice weekly. Bulk RNA sequencing was performed to identify pathways enriched in cells. RESULTS: We developed 13 NF1-associated MPNST-PDX and identified mutations or structural abnormalities in NF1 (100%), SUZ12 (85%), EED (15%), TP53 (15%), CDKN2A (85%), and chromosome 8 gain (77%). We successfully assembled PDX into 3D microtissues, categorized as robust (>90% viability at 48 h), good (>50%), or unusable (<50%). We evaluated drug response to ""robust"" or ""good"" microtissues, namely MN-2, JH-2-002, JH-2-079-c, and WU-225. Drug response ex vivo predicted drug response in vivo, and enhanced drug effects were observed in select models. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the successful establishment of a novel 3D platform for drug discovery and MPNST biology exploration in a system representative of the human condition.","Methods Genomic analysis was performed on all PDX-tumor pairs.

Materials and Methods Study Approval Specimens were collected under IRB-approved protocols at Johns Hopkins University (protocol 00096544),  Washington University at St. Louis (protocol 201203042), and University of Minnesota (protocol STUDY00004719). Patient subjects provided written informed consent prior to participation. 29 Human Subjects and PDX Tumor Model Establishment Tumor pieces were collected following surgical removal, transported in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) to the laboratory, and kept on ice until ready for implantation into mice. At Johns Hopkins University (JHU), PDX were generated exclusively from tumor fragments. Patient tumor samples were minced into 2–4 mm sized pieces, dipped in Matrigel (Corning 354234), inserted subcutaneously in the flank of mice, and enclosed by surgical glue. At Washington University (WU), single cell suspension of tumor cells (3 × 10 6  cells per mouse) was combined 1:1 with Matrigel and implanted subcutaneously in the flank of mice. Tumor tissue was implanted dorsally into 5- to 6-week-old NOD- Rag1 null IL2rg  (NRG) mice. When tumors were ~2 cm × 2 cm (or the mouse met other parameters that required its sacrifice), tumors were removed, minced, and engrafted into additional mice. This process was repeated for six passages and tumor fragments or single cell suspensions of tumor cells were cryopreserved at each passage. Engraftment success was defined as the ability of the PDX to be serially transplanted for six passages. JH-2-055-b represents the same line previously published as JH-2-055, but multiple samples have been processed from a single patient, and therefore JH-2-055-b has been renamed accordingly. null 24 WES, WGS, and RNA-seq Library Preparation and Sequencing Normal germline, tumor, and xenograft samples from five patients (total 15 samples) were used for DNA sequencing. DNA libraries were constructed using KAPA HyperPrep Kits for NGS DNA Library Prep. For whole exome sequencing, exomes were captured by IDT exome reagent xGen Exome Research Panel V1.0; exome libraries were sequenced by NovaSeq6000 S4 300XP with ~200× coverage for normal samples and 800–1000× coverage for tumor/xenograft samples. For WGS, libraries were sequenced by NovaSeq6000 S4 300XP with 15–20× coverage. For RNA-seq, tumor and xenograft samples were used from five patients. Samples were prepared using TrueSeq stranded total RNA library kit with Ribo-Zero for rRNA depletion. Libraries were sequenced by NovaSeq6000 S4 300XP with targeted coverage of 30M reads per sample. WES Data Analysis WES data from eight patients reported previously  were used. WES sequencing FASTQ files were trimmed using Trimmomatic v 0.39 10  and aligned against reference sequence hg38 via BWA-MEM. 30  Duplicate reads were marked using picard “Markduplicates.” GATK V4.2 base quality score recalibration (BQSR) was used to process BAM files. For PDX sequence data, Xenosplit was used to filter mouse-derived reads using mouse (GRCm38) and human (hg38) reference genomes. Somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions or deletions (indels) were detected using VarScan2, Strelka2, MuTect2, and Pindel, as previously described. 31  Variant filtering and annotation were done using Variant Effect Predictor (VEP). 10  Common variants found in the 1000 Genomes MAF and GnomAD MAF > 0.05 were filtered out. Somatic variant plots were created with maftools v2.10.0. 32 33 Copy Number Variant (CNV) Analysis using WGS Data WGS data from eight patients reported previously  were used. Alignment of sequence reads, removal of duplicate reads, and BQSR steps are as described above. CNVkit V2.0 was used to infer and visualize copy number. Normal pooled reference was first built from all normal samples. The reference was used to extract copy number information from tumor/xenograft sample BAM files. Heatmap was drawn using CNVkit’s heatmap function. 10 Bulk RNA-seq Analysis Initial primary tumors and PDX samples were aligned to GRCh37. Mouse-derived reads were filtered using Xenosplit. RNA reads were then aligned to Gencode v29 with the Common workflow language workflow at  https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/rare-disease-workflows/blob/main/rna-seq-workflow/synapse-salmon-alignment-workflow.cwl , which includes quantitation with the Salmon algorithm.  Gene counts and transcript counts were normalized by using the DESeq2 package. 34 35 PDX Cell Dissociation for 3D Microtissue Assembly All mouse experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at University of Minnesota under protocol #2101-38758A. For each PDX, an arbitrarily sized tumor sample was minced on ice in Matrigel (Corning), passed through a 1 mL syringe (18-gauge needle) and injected into the flank of NRG mice (Jackson Labs). Once the xenograft tumors reached the maximum size allowed (2000 mm 3 ), mice were euthanized, tumors were extracted in a laminar flow hood under sterile conditions and were immediately digested using the human Tumor Dissociation Kit (130-095-929, Miltenyi Biotec) in combination with the GentleMACS Octo Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec). At room temperature, the digested PDX was filtered through a 70 µm cell strainer and then depleted of residual red blood cells using 1X RBC Lysis Buffer (eBioscience). Dead cells were removed from the digested PDX using a Dead Cell Removal Kit (130-090-101, Miltenyi Biotec). Murine cells were removed from the dead cell depleted fraction using a Mouse Cell Depletion Kit (130-104-694, Miltenyi Biotec). Cells were then run through the CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) to characterize the cells using the following Biolegend antibodies and stains: anti-human HLA-A,B,C (311405), anti-mouse H-2 (125505), Mouse IgG1, κ Isotype Ctrl (FC) Antibody (400113), Mouse IgG2a, κ Isotype Ctrl (FC) (400213), Rat IgG2a, κ Isotype Ctrl (400507), and 7-AAD Viability Staining Solution (420403). Cell counts were also ascertained via trypan blue (ThermoFisher) exclusion on the Countess II machine (Invitrogen). 2D Culture Details In two-dimensional culture, PDX cells and the MPNST cell line, ST88-14 (gift from Dr. Nancy Ratner, PhD, University of Cincinnati), were maintained in DMEM High Glucose (ThermoFisher), 10% FBS (Gibco), and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (Gibco). All cultures were maintained at 37°C, 5% CO 2 , atmospheric O 2  and 95% humidity in tissue culture-treated 24-well plates (Corning). Microwell Fabrication Microwell plates were fabricated following previously established methods.  Briefly, polystyrene multiwell plates were coated with a thin layer of 2% agarose and dehydrated in a sterile laminar flow hood overnight. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamps featuring a radial pattern of 300 mm diameter posts were plasma treated for 2 min to produce a hydrophilic surface and sterilized with boiling water. For a 24-well plate, 175 mL of molten 2% agarose solution was pipetted into each well and the hydrophilic PDMS stamp placed immediately onto the agarose. After cooling for 5 min, stamps were removed gently from the polymerized agarose and hydrated with Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS; Corning). Wells were washed with appropriate culturing media before adding microtissues with a manual micropipette. The stamped plates are referred to as “‘microwell plates.’” 36 Microtissue Fabrication For the assembly of collagen microtissues, previously established protocols were followed.  Briefly, high-concentration rat tail collagen I (Corning) was buffered with 10 × DPBS (Corning), neutralized to pH 7.4, supplemented with 10% Matrigel (Corning), diluted to 6 mg/mL concentration, and mixed with cells (6 × 10 36–38 6  cells/mL). At 4°C, the collagen solution was partitioned into droplets using a flow-focusing polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS; Dow Corning) microfluidic device. The continuous phase from the droplet generation (FC-40 with 2% 008-FluoroSurfactant; Ran Biotechnologies) was collected with microtissues in a low-retention Eppendorf tube and polymerized for 30 min at 25°C. The oil phase was then removed and the collagen microtissues were resuspended in culture medium and added to microwell plates at 37°C. 3D Microtissue Characterization Immunofluorescence imaging was performed 48 h postmicrotissue encapsulation using the following antibodies: human nuclei (ab254080, Abcam), Ki-67 (RM9106S1, Fisher Scientific), S-100 b (sc-393919, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), H3K27me3 (9733, Cell Signaling Technologies), pERK (4370, Cell Signaling Technologies). Microtissues were assessed for compaction by analyzing projected area of each microtissue at 0, 2, and 5 days in culture. Drug Treatment (3D Microtissues) Inhibitors used in this study were: 100 mM mirdametinib (S1036, Selleckchem) and 100 mM olaparib (S1060, Selleckchem) dissolved in DMSO (Sigma–Aldrich), and 0.0656 mM trabectedin (clinical excess from Washington University pharmacy, manufacturer Johnson & Johnson) dissolved in water. Drug stocks were serially diluted for 8-point dose curves with 4-fold dilutions between each dose. Combinations of trabectedin plus mirdametinib or olaparib were kept in a fixed 2000:1 ratio, respectively, for each dose, or with trabectedin at a constant concentration of 0.5 nM. PDX cell-laden microtissue cultures were treated with single and dual agents by addition of the diluted agent(s), in DMSO, to their relevant concentrations in the culture medium. The cell encapsulated microtissue solution was then added to the agent-media solution to obtain desired concentration. Control samples were treated with DMSO diluted in culture medium. Cell Viability Assay Microtissues containing encapsulated PDX cells were fabricated and cultured. To assess cell viability, constructs were washed thoroughly with DPBS (Corning) and then incubated in the dark at 21°C for 30 min with a staining solution of 5 μM DRAQ5 (Invitrogen) for nuclei and 5 μM Calcein AM (ThermoFisher) for living cells. A Zeiss Axio Observer was used to image z-positions at 50 μm intervals over a distance of 250 μm and images were further analyzed using Cellpose (Stringer et al., 2021) and ImageJ (NIH). For experimental wells, live cell over total cell count ratio per microtissue was normalized to vehicle-only treated cells to produce percent cell viability. Data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism and dose–response curves generated using nonlinear regression Log(inhibitor) vs. response–variable slope model. Drug Treatment (PDX) Animal experiments were approved by the IACUC at Johns Hopkins under protocol #MO19M115 and at Washington University under protocol #20190118. Female NRG mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. Cryo-preserved PDX were utilized for these studies. Single cell suspension of tumor cells (3 × 10 6  cells per mouse, trabectedin/olaparib) or minced tumor fragments (trabectedin/mirdametinib) were implanted subcutaneously in the flank of 6- to 8-week-old NRG mice. Drug treatment started when tumors reached approximately 50–100 mm 3  in volume and continued for three weeks (trabectedin/olaparib) and 5–6 weeks (trabectedin/mirdametinib). Mice were randomized at 3–5 animals per treatment group to achieve similar mean tumor volume between groups. Drug doses and modes of delivery used in this study were: trabectedin (clinical excess from Washington University Pharmacy, manufacturer Johnson & Johnson) at 0.15 mg/kg weekly via tail vein injection; mirdametinib (SpringWorks Therapeutics, formulated in 0.5% Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and 0.2% Tween 80) at 1.5 mg/kg via oral gavage daily; and olaparib (Selleckchem) at 100 mg/kg via oral gavage daily. Tumors were measured two to three times weekly with calipers and tumor volume was calculated using the formula  L  ×  W 2 ( π /6), where  L  is the longest diameter and  W  is the width. Animals were euthanized when tumors reached ~2 cm 3  or mice reached other endpoints as defined by institutional animal protocols. Statistics Unpaired  t  tests were used to calculate statistical significance of relevant  in vitro  assays. Two-way ANOVA was used to calculate statistical significance of  in vivo  tumor growth data. Analyses were considered statistically significant if  p  < 0.05.",Alex T Larsson; Himanshi Bhatia; Ana Calizo; Kai Pollard; Xiaochun Zhang; Eric Conniff; Justin F Tibbitts; Elizabeth Rono; Katherine Cummins; Sara H Osum; Kyle B Williams; Alexandra L Crampton; Tyler Jubenville; Daniel Schefer; Kuangying Yang; Yang Lyu; James C Pino; Jessica Bade; John M Gross; Alla Lisok; Carina A Dehner; John S A Chrisinger; Kevin He; Sara J C Gosline; Christine A Pratilas; David A Largaespada; David K Wood; Angela C Hirbe,Neuro-oncology,2023-11-02,10.1093/neuonc/noad097,minimal,True
PMID:41591566,FAP expression as a marker of malignant transformation enabling in vivo characterization in peripheral nerve sheath tumors: a multimodal and translational study.,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive sarcomas and a major cause of mortality in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1). Distinguishing MPNSTs from benign neurofibromas remains challenging. We investigated fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP) as a malignancy biomarker and theranostic target in peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Therefore, we integrated publicly available bulk transcriptomics, spatial transcriptomics, and single-cell RNA sequencing with immunohistochemistry (IHC) on independent archival samples. We further directly assessed clinical translatability using FAP-targeted PET/CT in an NF-1 patient undergoing work-up for suspected malignant transformation. Across independent bulk datasets, FAP was consistently up-regulated in MPNSTs compared with neurofibromas. In the TCGA sarcoma dataset, FAP varied by histotype but was clearly expressed in MPNSTs. Spatial transcriptomics revealed enrichment of FAP-high regions in MPNSTs and co-localization with tumor cell markers. Single-cell analysis showed FAP expression in MPNST tumor cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts, with the highest levels in neural crest-like tumor subpopulations previously linked to adverse prognosis; pseudotime analysis indicated decreasing FAP expression along trajectories toward Schwann cell precursor-like states linking FAP expression to a more primitive, dedifferentiated tumor cell state. IHC confirmed strong, predominantly tumor cell-intrinsic FAP expression in MPNSTs, with minimal staining in neurofibromas and normal tissues. Plexiform neurofibromas exhibited intermediate FAP expression. In clinical imaging, FAP-PET demonstrated higher tracer uptake in histologically proven MPNSTs than in benign lesions within the same patient, including a neurofibroma that was FDG-avid but FAP-negative, supporting added diagnostic specificity over FDG-PET/CT. In summary, FAP is robustly overexpressed in MPNSTs at transcript and protein levels, potentially concentrates in high-risk tumor cell states, and is detectable by targeted PET imaging. These findings identify FAP as a clinically relevant biomarker for malignancy in NF-1-associated tumors and support implementation of FAP-directed diagnostics and therapeutics in peripheral nerve sheath tumor work-up.","Methods Ethical approval & cohort Our study was approved by the responsible ethical committee of Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich (reference: project number 25-0654) and performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained by the involved patients. For analysis involving publicly available transcriptomic datasets, we refer to the original publications for details regarding ethical approval and patient consent. Immunohistochemical analysis of FAP expression was performed on archival tissue specimens (Institute of Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics, University Hospital Augsburg). Neurofibromas ( n  = 12) exhibited typical histological features, including loosely arranged spindle cells within a variably myxoid to collagenous stroma, S100 immuno-reactivity in Schwann cells, and characteristic lattice-like CD34 staining in fibroblastic cells. In contrast, MPNSTs showed increased cellularity, nuclear atypia, and mitotic activity. Immunohistochemically, MPNSTs ( n  = 12) demonstrated reduced or focal S100 expression and were negative for other lineage-defining markers, consistent with WHO diagnostic criteria [ 27 ]. Additionally, to obtain a more comprehensive view of FAP expression across the spectrum of peripheral nerve sheath tumors, we included plexiform neurofibromas ( n  = 6; 3 with known NF-1 association, 3 without available clinical data regarding NF-1 status but with typical histopathological and immuno-histochemical marker expression) and hybrid peripheral nerve sheath tumors ( n  = 2;1 hybrid schwannoma-perineurioma, 1 hybrid neurofibroma-schwannoma) in the immunohistochemical analysis. Given the recognized diagnostic challenges of MPNST outside an NF-1-associated setting, all cases underwent thorough re-evaluation. Available clinical data revealed NF-1 association in two cases and post-radiation etiology in one case, whereas NF-1 status could not be reliably determined in the remaining cases due to limited follow-up information. To minimize diagnostic uncertainty and exclude major fusion-driven sarcoma mimics, RNA fusion profiling was performed using the TruSight RNA Pan-Cancer Panel (Illumina, San Diego, CA, US), which did not detect sarcoma-defining fusion genes in any case. In addition, all tumors had undergone extensive immunohistochemical work-up during initial diagnostic assessment to exclude alternative lineages, using a broad marker panel adapted to the respective differential diagnoses (including, where appropriate, TLE1, desmin, FLI1, CD34, MUC4, pan-cytokeratin, melanocytic markers, GFAP, DOG1, and CD117). Furthermore, Illumina EPIC DNA methylation profiling was performed with application of the Heidelberg sarcoma classifier [ 28 ]. In cases with sufficient DNA quantity and quality, methylation-based classification supported the diagnosis of MPNST (3 out of12 MPNSTs). In most archival samples (9 out of 12 MPNSTs), methylation profiling was not successful due to insufficient DNA yield or quality (most likely attributable to age of some specimens [> 10 years], FFPE-related degradation and small size of available biopsy material following extensive prior diagnostic work-up). No distinction between sporadic and NF-1-associated MPNSTs was made in downstream analysis due to incomplete clinical annotation. Immunohistochemistry Immunohistochemical staining for FAP was performed on a Ventana BenchMark ULTRA platform using the iVIEW DAB detection system (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). A recombinant anti-FAP antibody (clone ab207178, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was applied at a dilution of 1:250. Antigen retrieval was carried out with CC1 buffer for 92 min, followed by primary antibody incubation at 37 °C for 32 min. Detection was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. We used the H-score for quantification of FAP immunohistochemistry: 1 × percentage of weak staining) + (2 × percentage of moderate staining) + (3 × percentage of strong staining). The H score ranges from 0 to 300 [ 29 ]. IHC stains were evaluated together by two pathologists (BM, NGR). Bulk, spatial, and single-cell transcriptomic data analyses We performed a multimodal analysis of FAP expression in NF-1-associated lesions. The study outline is summarized in Fig.  1 . Fig. 1 Study overview. To prove FAP as potent biomarker for distinguishing MPNSTs from neurofibromas and hence to provide a rationale for FAP-directed PET/CT in the diagnostic work-up of NF-1 patients, we investigated five publicly available datasets spanning different modalities (bulk RNA profiling by array- and RNA-seq-based technologies, spot-based spatial transcriptomics and single-cell RNA profiling). We validated these RNA-level findings on protein level by immunohistochemistry. Finally, we provided clinical validation of FAP as a malignancy biomarker using FAP-directed PET/CT in an NF-1 patient. Created in BioRender. Reitsam, N. (2026)  https://BioRender.com/wvtr7fz To investigate the differences in  FAP  gene expression between neurofibromas and MPNSTs, publicly available gene expression datasets  (  [ GSE241224 ,  GSE66743 ) 30 ,  31 ] were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Expression matrices and corresponding phenotype metadata were processed using the GEOquery and Biobase R packages.  FAP, SLC2A1, SLC2A3  mRNA expression was extracted based on the following probe IDs:  FAP : TC02002480.hg.1,  SLC2A1 : TC01002578.hg.1,  SLC2A3 : TC12001170.hg.1;  FAP : hCG1685968.2;  SLC2A1 : hCG40024.3;  SLC2A3 : hCG22218.2 and hCG1730826.1). Samples were annotated as neurofibroma or MPNST based on sample metadata. Gene-wise expression comparisons between tumor types were performed using unpaired two-tailed t tests. Additionally,  FAP  gene expression across sarcoma subtypes in the TCGA dataset ( n  = 255) [ 32 – 34 ] was analyzed using batch-normalized RSEM RNA-seq data; differences were assessed by Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s post hoc test with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. We analyzed spatial transcriptomics data from eight peripheral nerve lesions profiled by the 10× Genomics Visium platform, originally published by  Bremer  et al .  [ 35 ]. These included four malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), two hybrid peripheral nerve sheath tumors (HPNSTs), one plexiform neurofibroma, and one NF2-associated neuropathy. We processed the data using Seurat [ 36 ,  37 ] (Version: 5.3.0,  https://satijalab.org/seurat/ ) in R (Version: 4.4.0). For each sample, we retained spatial spots with > 50 detected genes and < 20,000 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). Data were log-normalized and 2,000 highly variable genes were identified using the  vst  method. Each sample was annotated with lesion type metadata and subsequently merged into a single Seurat object for downstream analysis. To identify regions with elevated  FAP  expression, we classified spatial spots as “high FAP” if expression exceeded the 75th percentile across all spots. Enrichment of high FAP expression in MPNST versus non-MPNST samples was tested using a 2 × 2 contingency table and Fisher’s exact test. To explore the biological context of  FAP  expression, we performed a focused co-expression analysis across all MPNST samples. We tested co-enrichment of  FAP  with MPNST markers ( NGFR, APOD, L1CAM, S100B, CDK4, VIM, ZEB1, MYH9, SOX10 ) and stromal markers ( PDGFRB, DCN, COL1A1, LAMA2 ). For each marker, we binarized expression per spot (nonzero vs zero). We calculated the percentage of high-FAP spots that were also positive for each marker (“% Joint + ”) to approximate spatial co-localization. This statistical framework emphasizes the spatial relationship between  FAP  and known tumor biology markers in MPNST. Single‐cell RNA‐sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from four NF-1‐associated MPNST samples [ 38 ] were processed in R (Version: 4.4.0) using Seurat (Version: 5.3.0). Raw UMI count matrices were loaded via  Read10X , filtered to remove cells with < 200 or > 9,000 genes and > 20% mitochondrial reads, and normalized with the  LogNormalize  method; mitochondrial percentage was regressed out during scaling. Highly variable features (n = 2,000) were identified using the  vst  method, followed by PCA (30 PCs) and UMAP (dims 1:20) for dimensionality reduction. Shared‐nearest‐neighbor graphs were constructed ( FindNeighbors , dims 1:20) and clusters were defined with a resolution of 0.1 ( FindClusters ). Differential expression analysis ( FindAllMarkers , min.pct = 0.25, log2FC > 0.25) yielded the top 10 marker genes per cluster, which were then manually annotated to distinguish tumor (e.g., mesenchymal‐like, cycling Schwann‐lineage) from immune, stromal, and vascular populations. Cell‐type compositions and marker expression  (FAP, SLC2A1, SLC2A3)  were visualized by UMAP and DotPlot. To explore differentiation trajectories among tumor clusters, we applied Slingshot [ 39 ] (Version: 2.12.0) ( slingshot.html ) on UMAP embeddings. Bulk, spatial, and single-cell transcriptomic analyses were performed using custom R scripts, which are available on GitHub ( https://github.com/ngr-path/Analysis_R_FAP_NF1_MPNST ). Statistical analysis Continuous data are given as mean ± standard deviation or median and range, where appropriate. Comparisons were performed using unpaired two-tailed t tests for bulk RNA data and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for immunohistochemical H-scores. Fisher’s exact tests were used for spatial enrichment analyses, and co-expression and trajectory inference in spatial and single-cell transcriptomics were performed using Seurat and Slingshot in R as outlined in the corresponding subsections. Bonferroni correction and Benjamini-Hochberg procedure were performed to adjust for multiple testing. A p value of < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. PET/CT imaging Scans were obtained on a dedicated PET/CT scanner (Biograph mCT 40; Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany). After administration of 179 MBq [ 68  Ga]Ga-LNTH-1363S, (FAP-directed radiotracer; mass dose, 90 ug) or 167 MBq of [ 18 F]FDG, respectively, whole-body imaging was acquired at 60 min post administration with 6–8 bed positions and an emission time of 2 min each. Data were decay-corrected to the starting time of each individual scan. PET imaging was accompanied by whole-body auxiliary CT (35 mAs, 120 keV, a 512 × 512 matrix, 5-mm slice thickness, increment of 30 mm/s, rotation time of 0.5 s, and pitch of 0.8) for attenuation correction purposes. Contrast-enhanced CT of the upper and lower body was acquired with FDG-PET imaging. Images were reconstructed using a standard reconstruction protocol provided by the manufacturer (2 iterations, 21 subsets) and corrected for randoms, scatter, decay, and attenuation.",Nic G Reitsam; Alexander Gäble; Lisa Siebenhüter; Tina Schaller; Friederike Liesche-Starnecker; Eva Sipos; Sebastian Dintner; Christoph Walz; John Babic; Martin Trepel; Malte Kircher; Victoria E Fincke; Pascal D Johann; Bruno Märkl; Constantin Lapa; Johanna S Enke,Acta neuropathologica,2026-01-27,10.1007/s00401-026-02979-7,minimal,True
PMID:32642740,Quality of life in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 and 2 in Canada.,"BACKGROUND: There is scarce data on the quality of life of people with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and type 2 (NF2) in Canada. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of adults with NF1 and NF2 attending a tertiary center. Patients completed generic measures (SF-36, EQ-5D-5L, and PROMIS pain interference) and disease-specific questionnaires (PedsQL NF1 module and the NFTI-QOL for NF2). We compared generic scores between NF1 and NF2 individuals and used regression models to assess factors associated with quality of life. RESULTS: Hundred and eighty-four participants were enrolled. Mean age was 33 years in NF1 and 40 years in NF2. NF1 and NF2 individuals had lower employment rates and lower scores in all domains of the SF-36 compared to the general Canadian population ( CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with NF1 and NF2 have low quality of life, and this correlates with pain, anxiety, and depression, which are prevalent in NF1 and NF2. Perceived physical appearance predicts quality of life in NF1. A multidisciplinary approach is necessary for patients with NF1 and NF2, including mental health and pain management.","Methods A cross-sectional study of adults with NF1 and NF2 attending a tertiary center. Patients completed generic measures (SF-36, EQ-5D-5L, and PROMIS pain interference) and disease-specific questionnaires (PedsQL NF1 module and the NFTI-QOL for NF2). We compared generic scores between NF1 and NF2 individuals and used regression models to assess factors associated with quality of life. Methods This is a cross-sectional study of patients attending the Elisabeth Raab Neurofibromatosis Multidisciplinary Clinic at Toronto General Hospital, between January 2016 and December 2017. We invited all adults who meet the clinical diagnostic criteria  and/or genetically confirmed NF1 and NF2 to participate. We excluded from the study individuals unable to complete the questionnaires (eg, language barrier or limited literacy). The University Health Network research ethics board approved the study, and all participants provided written informed consent. 13 , 14 The attending clinician completed a standardized form for clinical manifestations of NF1 or NF2, including a family history of NF, genetic testing, known plexiform neurofibromas (either visible on examination by MRI), presence of spinal and brain tumors, other malignancies, and history of MPNSTs. We did not ask clinicians to specify if the plexiforms were diagnosed by imaging or examination, and it was a yes/no question. For individuals with NF1, the clinicians also rated the disease visibility using the Ablon visibility index.  In this measure, patients are assessed while fully dressed, and visibility ranges from 1—mild, no visible tumors outside normal clothing areas to 3—indicating numerous visible tumors in the face or neck, or visible limp. For NF2, the physicians also completed the House and Brackmann facial nerve scale 15  that rates facial nerve impairments from 1—normal symmetric function to 6—indicating complete paralysis. Finally, the physicians rated the hearing of NF2 patients, based on the last audiogram, using a 5-item Likert scale ranging from normal hearing to profound hearing loss. 16 17 The patients completed several questionnaires, including demographic data (age, sex, employment, and educational status), and health-specific measures described below. Generic Measures 
 SF-36 : This is a 36-item generic QoL measure  that has normative data for the Canadian population. 18  The SF-36 has 8 domains: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health perception, energy/vitality, social functioning, role emotional, and mental health. Additionally, the physical health domains are summarized in a physical score (PCS) and the mental domains in a mental score (MCS). Lower scores indicate lower QoL. The SF-36 has been widely used and validated in the Canadian population, with available normative data. 19 19 
 EQ-5D-5L : This is a 5-item multi-attribute questionnaire.  The EQ-5D-5L dimensions are mobility, usual activities, self-care, pain, and depression/anxiety, each with 5 response options. The EQ-5D-5L can be scored as health utilities, where a score of 1 indicates perfect health and 0 indicates death; negative scores are possible, indicating states valued as worse than death. Additionally, the EQ-5D-5L has a visual analogue scale (VAS) for a direct valuation of general health, ranging from 0—worst possible health to 100—best possible health. This has been widely used and validated in Canada and we used a Canadian valuation algorithm to estimate the EQ-5D-5L utility scores. 20 21 
 PROMIS pain interference short form 8a : This is an 8-item questionnaire, assessing how pain affects social, cognitive, physical, and recreational activities. Raw scores are converted into T-scores, ranging between 40.7 and 77; higher scores indicate worse pain interference.  This measure has been recommended for trials assessing pain in adults with NF1, although it has not been specifically validated in Canada. 22 23 Disease-Specific Measures 
 PedsQL NF1 adult module : This is a 74-item self-reported measure, specifically developed for NF1.  The PedsQL NF1 module has 16 domains assessing physical, emotional, social, and cognitive functioning, as well as communication, worry, perceived physical appearance, pain and hurt, paresthesia, skin irritation, sensation, movement and balance, daily activities, fatigue, treatment anxiety, and sexual functioning. Each item is scored in a 5-option Likert scale ranging from 0—never to 4—almost always and then reverse-scored between 0 and 100. The domain scores are calculated as the average score for all the items in each domain, and a total score is obtained by calculating the average of all items. Higher scores indicate better QoL. To our knowledge, this measure has not been previously used or validated in Canada. 24 
 NFTI-QoL : This is an 8-item NF2-specific questionnaire.  The items reflect balance, hearing, facial weakness, visual problems, mobility, role and outlook on life, pain, and anxiety/depression. Each item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale from 0 to 3, and the total score is the sum of all items. Higher scores indicate worse QoL. To our knowledge, there are no previous Canadian data for this measure. 25 Statistical Analysis Continuous data are described as mean ± standard deviation, or median and interquartile range; categorical data are presented as number and proportion. For the generic measures (SF-36, EQ-5D-5L, PROMIS pain interference), we compared the mean scores between NF1 and NF2 individuals using  t  tests. For the SF-36, we also compared the results to Canadian normative data. For the PedsQL NF1, we calculated the mean score in each dimension as well as the total score. For the NFTI-QoL, we calculated the mean total score and also the median score for each item. We tested the correlation coefficients between the different generic and disease-specific measures. Finally, we conducted multivariable regression analyses to study the relationship between the different clinical and demographic variables and QoL. Because we used different QoL measures, we decide a priori to build regression models for the SF-36 PCS, SF-36 MCS, and total PedsQL NF1 score. If enough patients were enrolled with NF2, we also planned to build a model for the NFTI-QoL. We chose the variables for the models based on clinical grounds and previous reports, and we tested all variables for collinearity and possible interactions. We removed variables that were highly collinear, and we retained interaction terms according to likelihood ratio tests. For each dependent variable, we chose the best performing model, comparing  R 2  statistics and residuals. Final models were bootstrapped with 100 repetitions to account for overfitting. All analyses were done with R statistical software version 3.5.1, and we considered  P -values <.05 as significant.  We used Bonferroni correction when appropriate. 26",Geohana Hamoy-Jimenez; Raymond Kim; Suganth Suppiah; Gelareh Zadeh; Vera Bril; Carolina Barnett,Neuro-oncology advances,2020-07,10.1093/noajnl/vdaa003,minimal,True
PMID:7499408,"Inhibition of Ras/Raf interaction by anti-oncogenic mutants of neurofibromin, the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene product, in cell-free systems.","The neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene encodes a protein, neurofibromin, containing GTPase-activating protein-related domain (GRD) that stimulates intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras protein. By screening a randomly mutagenized NF1-GRD library in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we isolated two NF1-GRD mutants (NF201 and NF204) with single amino acid substitutions, which suppress the heat shock-sensitive phenotype of the RAS2(G19V) mutant. The NF1-GRD mutants also suppress the oncogenic Ras-induced transformation of NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts (Nakafuku, M., Nagamine, M., Ohtoshi, A., Tanaka, K., Toh-e, A., and Kaziro, Y. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90, 6706-6710). In this paper, we investigated the molecular mechanism of inhibition of the transforming Ras-specific function by the NF1-GRD mutants in mammalian cells. In human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, the mutant NF1-GRDs attenuated the stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase by Ras(G12V), but not by platelet-derived growth factor. In cell-free systems, purified recombinant NF1-GRD mutants showed an inhibitory effect on the association of Ras.guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) with Raf at several times lower concentrations than the wild type. Furthermore, it was revealed that the binding affinity of the mutant NF1-GRDs toward Ras.GTP gamma S is approximately 5-10 times higher than the wild type. These results suggest that the mutant NF1-GRDs tightly bind to an oncogenic Ras in its GTP-bound active conformation and block the interaction between Ras and its effector, Raf.",,S Mori; T Satoh; H Koide; M Nakafuku; E Villafranca; Y Kaziro,The Journal of biological chemistry,1995-12-01,10.1074/jbc.270.48.28834,abstract_only,False
PMID:37770931,"Integration of single-nuclei RNA-sequencing, spatial transcriptomics and histochemistry defines the complex microenvironment of NF1-associated plexiform neurofibromas.","Plexiform neurofibroma (PN) is a leading cause of morbidity in children with the genetic condition Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1), often disfiguring or threatening vital structures. During formation of PN, a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) develops, with recruitment of neoplastic and non-neoplastic cell types being critical for growth and progression. Due to the cohesive cellularity of PN, single-cell RNA-sequencing is difficult and may result in a loss of detection of critical cellular subpopulations. To bypass this barrier, we performed single-nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) on 8 frozen PN samples, and integrated this with spatial transcriptomics (ST) in 4 PN samples and immunohistochemistry to provide morphological context to transcriptomic data. SnRNA-seq analysis definitively charted the heterogeneous cellular subpopulations in the PN TME, with the predominant fraction being fibroblast subtypes. PN showed a remarkable amount of inter-sample homogeneity regarding cellular subpopulation proportions despite being resected from a variety of anatomical locations. ST analysis identified distinct cellular subpopulations which were annotated using snRNA-seq data and correlated with histological features. Schwann cell/fibroblast interactions were identified by receptor/ligand interaction analysis demonstrating a high probability of Neurexin 1/Neuroligin 1 (NRXN1/NLGN1) receptor-ligand cross-talk predicted between fibroblasts and non-myelinated Schwann cells (NM-SC) and subtypes, respectively. We observed aberrant expression of NRXN1 and NLGN1 in our PN snRNA-seq data compared to a normal mouse sciatic nerve single-cell RNA-seq dataset. This pathway has never been described in PN and may indicate a clear and direct communication pathway between putative NM-SC cells of origin and surrounding fibroblasts, potentially driving disease progression. SnRNA-seq integrated with spatial transcriptomics advances our understanding of the complex cellular heterogeneity of PN TME and identify potential novel communication pathways that may drive disease progression, a finding that could provide translational therapy options for patients with these devastating tumors of childhood and early adulthood.","Materials and methods Sample details and preparation Human NF1-associated plexiform neurofibroma samples (Table  1 ) were collected from surgeries at Children’s Hospital Colorado in compliance with all ethical standards and informed consent (COMIRB-13-1672). Bulk frozen tissue samples were processed using CHAPS-based buffer as previously described that provided nuclei that were not only high in membrane integrity, but also nuclear yield [ 27 ]. An additional wash step was utilized to prevent the presence of cell-free RNA that has been shown to confound downstream snRNA-sequencing. Bright field microscopy was employed to determine yield, quality and membrane integrity of single nuclei. Archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) material corresponding to 14 PN patient samples were obtained for IHC analyses.

All PN samples were taken from patients with confirmed Neurofibromatosis Type 1. snRNA-seq allowed the use of bulk frozen samples and the isolation of single-nuclei with superior quantity and quality with low levels of cell-free RNA as demonstrated by quality control measurements included in the platform. Single nuclei generated from PN were analyzed using 10 × Genomics Chromium 3′ gene expression. The single-nuclei RNA-seq was performed at the UC Cancer Center Microarray and Genomics Core, where 4000 nuclei per sample were captured and barcoded to generate cDNA libraries. Libraries were subsequently sequenced using the Illumina NovaSeq6000 platform at approximately 50,000 reads per nuclei. We utilized Chromium Controller in combination with Chromium Single Cell V3 Chemistry Library Kits, Gel Bead & Multiplex Kit, and Chip Kit (10 × Genomics). Transcripts were converted to cDNA, barcoded, and libraries were sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq6000 to obtain 50,000 reads per cell. SnRNA-seq data analysis Raw sequencing reads were processed using CellRanger (10 × Genomics) and Seurat 3.1.0. C Cells from individual subpopulations were reanalyzed separately using Harmony alignment [ 18 ]. Presto was used for determining differential expression and marker gene identification [ 19 ]. Cellular subpopulations were fully categorized by using Jaccard analysis of PN cellular subpopulation marker genes with data from a single-cell RNA-sequencing mouse sciatic peripheral nerve atlas [ 31 ], as well as comparison with data from the benign cutaneous fibroma study [ 1 ], and examination of cluster-specific gene ontologies. CellChatDB [ 4 ] (version 1.5.0) was used to infer ligand–receptor interactions between and within individual subpopulations in single cell data. This method measures the average expression of ligand and cognate receptor genes for each subpopulation and then calculates the probability and statistical significance of intercellular communications, and identify dominant senders and receiver cell types. Visium spatial transcriptomics Optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound embedded frozen primary PN samples were sectioned on a Cryostar NX70 cryostat (ThermoFisher) at 10 μm sections and mounted on spatial transcriptomic capture slides (Visium, 10 × Genomics). The optimal tissue section permeabilization time (18 min) was established using preliminary test sections. 4 PN sections were permeabilized and resulting capture sections underwent methanol fixation and were stained with H&E and imaged on an Evos M7000 (ThermoFisher) with brightfield settings. RNA libraries were generated and subsequently sequenced at 70,000 read pairs per spot (Novaseq6000, Illumina). Spatial transcriptomics data analysis Sequencing data were processed with Space Ranger (10 × genomics, v1.2.1), followed by analysis in R using the Seurat (v4.0.1) tool suite. To ensure the number of genes detected were between 50 and 15,000 and less than 50% of UMIs mapped to mitochondrial genes, spots were filtered. SCTransform normalization on each sample and principal component analysis on merged data was conducted, followed by sample integration with Harmony (v1.0) using 30 principal components and theta = 2. UMAP dimension reduction and shared nearest neighbor clustering were conducted on 30 principal components. Space Ranger (10 × Genomics), Seurat [ 12 ], Harmony [ 18 ] and Clustree [ 32 ] packages were utilized to cluster, process, filter and integrate newly generated ST data. Clustering results at different resolution settings were evaluated through Clustree (v0.4.3) visualizations. The Wilcoxon test was used to determine differential gene expression within ST gene clusters. Cell types were defined by (1) Jaccard index calculation of ST cluster marker gene overlap with snRNA-seq markers as conducted previously [ 6 ,  7 ], (2) manual interpretation of ST cluster markers and (3) ontological analysis using DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery:  https://david.ncifcrf.gov ; version 6.8) to measure enrichment of GOterm Direct gene-sets in ST cluster signatures. ST cluster overlays on H&E image were produced in the Loupe Browser (10 × Genomics). Immunohistochemistry Immunohistochemistry was performed on 5-µm formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue sections using a Ventana auto stainer. Antigen retrieval was performed by incubation in citrate solution pH 6.0 for 10 min at 110 °C. Slides were treated with primary antibodies for LAMA2 (Abnova (Catalog #: H00003908-M01), 1:1000), SLC22A3 (Novus Biologicals (Catalog #: NBP1-83976), 1:750), PRRX1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific (Catalog#: MA5-26580), 1:200) and SOX10 (Roche (Catalog#: 760-4968), pre-diluted kit) for 32 min at 37 °C.

PMID:24375753,Sex Is a major determinant of neuronal dysfunction in neurofibromatosis type 1.,"OBJECTIVE: Children with neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) are at risk for developing numerous nervous system abnormalities, including cognitive problems and brain tumors (optic pathway glioma). Currently, there are few prognostic factors that predict clinical manifestations or outcomes in patients, even in families with an identical NF1 gene mutation. In this study, we leveraged Nf1 genetically engineered mice (GEM) to define the potential role of sex as a clinically relevant modifier of NF1-associated neuronal dysfunction. METHODS: Deidentified clinical data were analyzed to determine the impact of sex on optic glioma-associated visual decline in children with NF1. In addition, Nf1 GEM were employed as experimental platforms to investigate sexually dimorphic differences in learning/memory, visual acuity, retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death, and Nf1 protein (neurofibromin)-regulated signaling pathway function (Ras activity, cyclic adenosine monophosphate [cAMP], and dopamine levels). RESULTS: Female patients with NF1-associated optic glioma were twice as likely to undergo brain magnetic resonance imaging for visual symptoms and 3× more likely to require treatment for visual decline than their male counterparts. As such, only female Nf1 GEM exhibited a decrement in optic glioma-associated visual acuity, shorter RGC axons, and attenuated cAMP levels. In contrast, only male Nf1 GEM showed spatial learning/memory deficits, increased Ras activity, and reduced dopamine levels. INTERPRETATION: Collectively, these observations establish sex as a major prognostic factor underlying neuronal dysfunction in NF1, and suggest that sex should be considered when interpreting future preclinical and clinical study results.","Methods De-identified clinical data were analyzed to determine the impact of sex on optic glioma-associated visual decline in children with NF1.

Materials and Methods Human subjects De-identified data from individuals ≤18 years with an established diagnosis of NF1  managed in the St. Louis Children’s Hospital Neurofibromatosis Clinical Program (1994-2013) were collected under an approved Human Studies Protocol at the Washington University School of Medicine. 9 Mice Nf1 +/- GFAP CKO ( Nf1 flox/mut ;GFAP-Cre,  Nf1 -CKO) and littermate control ( Nf1 flox/flox ; CTL) mice were maintained on an inbred C57BL/6 background with  ad libitum  access to food and water. All experiments were performed on 3-4-month-old mice, unless otherwise stated, under an approved Animal Studies Committee protocol at the Washington University School of Medicine. Immunostaining Western blots were performed using pDARPP32 (1:500, Cell Signaling), DARPP32 (1:1000, Cell Signaling), pERK1/2 (1:1000, Cell Signaling), and ERK1/2 (1:1000, Cell Signaling) primary antibodies. Ras activation (Millipore), cAMP (New East Biosciences), TUNEL (Roche Diagnostics), and dopamine (Rocky Mountain Diagnostics) measurements were determined following manufacturer’s protocols. Each experiment was performed with samples from at least three independently-generated cohorts. Behavioral testing Morris Water Maze testing for spatial learning and memory was conducted as previously described . Three days after completing cued (visible but variable platform location; 4 trials/day, 2 consecutive days) trials, spatial learning acquisition was evaluated during the place condition (submerged, hidden platform, constant location; 4 trials/day, 5 consecutive days). Escape path length and latency, and swimming speeds were calculated for all cued and place trials. Retention performance was evaluated during probe trials (platform removed) conducted 1-h after the last place trial on the third and fifth days. Time spent in the target quadrant and spatial bias (time in the target quadrant versus each of the other quadrants) were also analyzed. Visual acuity (n=20 mice per group) was assessed using the virtual optokinetic system (VOS) under photopic conditions (1.8 log cd/m 10 2 ) , as previously described. Contrast thresholds were measured at a frequency of 0.128 cycles/degree and a speed of 5.4 degrees/sec. 10",Kelly A Diggs-Andrews; Jacquelyn A Brown; Scott M Gianino; Joshua B Rubin; David F Wozniak; David H Gutmann,Annals of neurology,2014-02,10.1002/ana.24093,minimal,True
PMID:25043591,Combined MEK inhibition and BMP2 treatment promotes osteoblast differentiation and bone healing in Nf1Osx -/- mice.,"Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disease with an incidence of 1/3000, caused by mutations in the NF1 gene, which encodes the RAS/GTPase-activating protein neurofibromin. Non-bone union after fracture (pseudarthrosis) in children with NF1 remains a challenging orthopedic condition to treat. Recent progress in understanding the biology of neurofibromin suggested that NF1 pseudarthrosis stems primarily from defects in the bone mesenchymal lineage and hypersensitivity of hematopoietic cells to TGFβ. However, clinically relevant pharmacological approaches to augment bone union in these patients remain limited. In this study, we report the generation of a novel conditional mutant mouse line used to model NF1 pseudoarthrosis, in which Nf1 can be ablated in an inducible fashion in osteoprogenitors of postnatal mice, thus circumventing the dwarfism associated with previous mouse models where Nf1 is ablated in embryonic mesenchymal cell lineages. An ex vivo-based cell culture approach based on the use of Nf1(flox/flox) bone marrow stromal cells showed that loss of Nf1 impairs osteoprogenitor cell differentiation in a cell-autonomous manner, independent of developmental growth plate-derived or paracrine/hormonal influences. In addition, in vitro gene expression and differentiation assays indicated that chronic ERK activation in Nf1-deficient osteoprogenitors blunts the pro-osteogenic property of BMP2, based on the observation that only combination treatment with BMP2 and MEK inhibition promoted the differentiation of Nf1-deficient osteoprogenitors. The in vivo preclinical relevance of these findings was confirmed by the improved bone healing and callus strength observed in Nf1osx (-/-) mice receiving Trametinib (a MEK inhibitor) and BMP2 released locally at the fracture site via a novel nanoparticle and polyglycidol-based delivery method. Collectively, these results provide novel evidence for a cell-autonomous role of neurofibromin in osteoprogenitor cells and insights about a novel targeted approach for the treatment of NF1 pseudoarthrosis.","MATERIAL AND METHODS Animals All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. WT and  Nf1  mice (herein called TetOff-Osx −/− Nf1  mice) were generated by crossing  Osx −/− Nf1 flox/flox  mice ( 11 ) and  Osx -tTA,  tetO -cre;  Nf1 flox/flox  mice ( 12 ). To repress transactivation of Cre by the  Osx  promoter during development, 200μg/ml doxycycline was added to the drinking water of pregnant mothers and pups and refreshed every 2-3 days, until the time at which recombination/deletion of  Nf1  was desired. All experimental mice were originated from the same colony to increase genetic homogeneity. For genotyping, genomic DNA was isolated from tail snips by sodium hydroxide digestion, and PCR was performed using primers P1, P2 and P4, as described by Zhu  et al  ( 11 ). The  Osx-Cre  transgene was detected using the forward: 5′-GCG GTC TGG CAG TAA AAA CTA TC-3′ and reverse: 5′-GTG AAA CAG CAT TGC TGT CAC TT-3′ primers. Generation of mid-diaphyseal fractures Closed mid-diaphyseal fracture of the tibia was created by three-point bending with an Einhorn device in 2 month-old male and female mice, as previously described ( 13 ). To produce stabilized fractures, an intramedullary fixation was used by inserting a 0.25 mm metal insect pin in the tibial tuberosity through the patellar tendon, prior to the creation of the fracture. Buprenorphine was administered subcutaneously for pain control. X-rays were taken following fracture to exclude any mice with unsatisfactory fractures. Cell culture BMSCs were extracted from long bones by centrifugation of dissected femoral and tibial diaphyses at 2000 g  for 3 min. The cells were then counted, plated and grown for 7 days in αMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 I.U./ml penicillin, 100μg/ml streptomycin (Cellgro, Manassas, VA, USA). At day 7, mineralization was induced by the addition of 50μg/ml of ascorbic acid and 10mM β-glycerophosphate. The media was refreshed every 2-3 days for 10 more days. Gene expression assays Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) and cDNAs were synthesized following DNase I treatment using the high-capacity cDNA reverse-transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, USA). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed by using TaqMan or SYBR green gene expression assays. The probe and primer sets for  Runx2  (Mm00501578_m1);  CyclinD  (Mm00432359_m1);  Osx  (Mm00504574_m1);  Tnsap  (Mm00475834_m1) and the normalizer  Hprt  (Mm00446968_m1) were obtained from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA, USA). The SYBR green primers were:  Nf1  (forward; GTATTGAATTGAAGCACCTTTGTTTGG, reverse; CTGCCCAAGGCTCCCCCAG);  Ocn  (forward; ACCCTGGCTGCGCTCTGTCTCT, reverse; GATGCGTTTGTAGGCGGTCTTCA) and  Col1a1  (forward; GACATCCCTGAAGTCAGCTGC, reverse; TCCCTTGGGTCCCTCGAC). Specificity of amplification was verified by the presence of a single peak on the dissociation curve. Specific amplification conditions are available upon request. Measurements were performed in triplicate and from at least 3 independent experiments. Western blot analyses Whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis according to standard protocols. Nitrocellulose membranes were probed using standard protocols using an anti-Phospho-ERK1/2 antibody (Cell Signaling cat#9101, dilution 1:1000) and ananti-ERK1/2 antibody (Cell Signaling cat#9102, dilution 1:1000). Cell culture staining Tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP) activity was assayed using the ALP assay kit (Sigma). Cell supernatant or lysate from adherent cells plated in 12 well plates were incubated with 20mM p-nitrophenylphosphate in reaction buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 10mM MgCl 2 ) for 5-10 minutes at 37°C, then the reaction was stopped with 0.1N NaOH, and the absorbance was read at 405nm. For Alizarin staining, cells in 12 well plates were washed twice in 1× PBS and stained with a solution containing 40mM Alizarin red S solution. The plates were incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes, then washed and air-dried. Bound calcium was released by adding 1ml of acetic acid and the mixture was incubated for 20 minutes. One hundred microliters of the solution was collected for OD 405  measurement. Adenovirus Infection of BMSCs BMSCs were isolated from  Nf1 flox/flox  mice and seeded at a density of 10 6  cells/well in 12 well plates. At 40% confluence, cells were incubated in complete cell culture medium (α-MEM, 10% FBS and 100 I.U./ml penicillin) containing either Ad5-CMV-GFP or Ad5-CMV-cre (Vector development lab, Baylor College of Medicine) at 2.5×10 9  PFUs. After 2 days of incubation, the medium in each well was replaced with complete cell culture medium.  Nf1  mRNA and recombination efficiency were determined according to the protocol previously described by Wang  et al  ( 14 ). Polyester nanoparticle synthesis (NP) Poly(α-allyl-valerolactone, valerolactone) containing 4% allyl groups was epoxidized with meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mcpba, 1.2 eq per alkene, Sigma) in CH 2 Cl 2  (0.065 M alkene) for 48 hours and washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate ( 15 ). The resulting polymer was dried under reduced pressure. 2,2′-ethylenedioxy-bis(ethylamine) (7.5 μL, 0.51 mmol, Sigma) was added to a solution of poly(epoxide-valerolactone, valerolactone) (0.173 g, M n  = 3,644 Da) dissolved in CH 2 Cl 2  (21.1 mL). The reaction mixture refluxed for 12 hours at 46° C. Residual bisamine was removed by dialyzing with Snakeskin Pleated Dialysis Tubing (MWCO = 10,000) against CH 2 Cl 2  to yield nanoparticles (NP). Trametinib encapsulation into nanoparticles (NP-GSK212) A solution of nanoparticle (23.0 mg) and MEK inhibitor (Trametinib, 5.0 mg, GlaxoSmithKline) in DMSO (1.00 mL) was added drop-wise to a vortexing solution of aqueous 1% d-α-tocopherolpolyethyleneglycol (1000) succinate (Vit E-TPGS (Sigma), 14.0 mL). The resulting precipitate was washed with deionized water using three cycles of centrifugation at 7830 rpm for 20 minutes. The precipitate was freeze-dried to yield a white powder (6.4% MEK inhibitor/NP (wt/wt) determined by NanoDrop UV-Vis at 258 nm). Polyglycidol-BMP2/NP-Trametinib dual drug delivery system Polyglycidolhomopolymer ( 16 ) was synthesized by first stirring 3-methyl-1-butanol (0.98 mL, 1.7 M in anhydrous THF) with Sn(OTf) 2  (1.28 mL, 0.037 M in anhydrous THF) in a nitrogen-purged flask. Glycidol monomer (10.0 g, 135 mmol, Sigma) was added drop-wise to the cooled reaction mixture. After the monomer addition was complete, the reaction vessel was allowed to warm up to room temperature. Once stirring was completely impeded, the crude viscous polymer product was dissolved in a minimal amount of methanol and precipitated into vigorously stirring acetone, which was then decanted to afford the pure glycidol homopolymer product as a translucent, viscous material. Recombinant human bone morphogenic protein-2 (rBMP2, Creative BioMart) was suspended in 20 mM acetic acid (10 mg/mL), added to polyglycidol, and diluted with PBS for a rBMP2 concentration of 0.50 μg/μL ( 6 ) and polyglycidol concentration of 0.46 g/mL. For Trametinibin jections and combo injections, encapsulated Trametinib was first sonicated in PBS and transferred to the polyglycidol mix to yield a Trametinib concentration of 0.188 μg/μL ( 17 , 18 ). Vehicle was prepared using unloaded nanoparticles and formulated similarly as described above. X-rays and μCT analyses Radiographs were obtained using a digital cabinet X-ray system (LX-60, Faxitron X-Ray, USA). μCT analyses were performed using a high-resolution benchtopScancoμ CT 40 system (Scanco Medical, Bassersdorf, Switzerland). Tomographic images were acquired at 55kVp and 145mA with an isotropic voxel size of 12μm and at an integration time of 250ms with 1000 projections collected per 360° rotation. Scans were acquired in PBS. μCT images were reconstructed, filtered (σ=0.8 and support = 1.0) and thresholded at 200. Callus trabecular bone was contoured manually on every 10 sections, and sections in between were automatically contoured with the software algorithm. Biomechanical Testing The fractured tibia from WT and  Nf1  littermates was cleaned of soft tissue, and stored frozen in PBS until thawed for testing. Three-point-bending was accomplished in displacement control on an InstronDynamight 4481 servo-hydraulic material testing apparatus (Instron, Norwood, MA). Hydrated samples were tested with span of 6mm at a rate of 3mm/min as per ( Osx −/− 19 ). Force was measured using a 100N load cell, and displacement was measured by a linear variable displacement transducer. Structural properties were extracted from force-displacement curves by custom Matlab algorithms (Mathworks, Natick, MA). Statistical analyses A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine whether differences existed in μCT and biomechanical-derived properties among experimental groups. In the event that standard deviations were significantly different, the ANOVA was done by the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test. When differences existed at p<0.05, post-hoc, pair-wise comparisons were tested for significance in which the p-value was adjusted (p adj <0.05) by Holm-Sidak’s method or Dunn’s method (non-parametric).

Eligible participants were (1) diagnosed with NF1 per NIH criteria or through germline NF1 mutation in a CLIA certified laboratory, (2) enrolled on a clinical trial of an MEKi for the treatment of a PN (including  NCT03962543 ,  NCT02096471 ,  NCT02407405 , and  NCT02124772 ), (3) between the ages of 4 and 35 years, (4) without significant sensory or motor impairment, and (5) primarily English or Spanish dominant.  This study was approved by the institutional review board of the principal investigator's institution and at each participating institution, and all participants consented. 28 Participants underwent a pretreatment neurocognitive evaluation. Three additional evaluations were completed over the first year on therapy: at 12 weeks (±4 weeks), 24 weeks (±4 weeks), and 48 weeks (±8 weeks). The 48-week assessment was added to the protocol after study initiation resulting in some patients not having 48-week data. Participants taken off treatment early (e.g., for toxicity or a lack of response) completed the cognitive assessment at the final study visit, while still taking the study drug. At each time point, participants completed the cognitive assessment (Cogstate) and a consistent parent completed a questionnaire of executive functioning (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function; BRIEF). Participants ≥18 completed the self-report BRIEF if an adult caregiver was not present. If a participant turned 18 during the course of the study, the parent report was maintained for consistency across the trial. All data were managed by the coordinating center (Children's National Medical Center). Individual participants' data were monitored in real time by the principal investigator (K.S.W.), and findings were conveyed to sites if scores were ≥1.5 SD below the mean or if there was a significant decrease in more than 2 measures over time, allowing for additional monitoring or evaluation for neurotoxicity as needed. Study Measures Specific outcome measures were selected to (1) assess cognitive functions relevant to the primary study aims, which are known deficits in NF1, (2) increase feasibility by minimizing time and resource burden for institutions and participants, and (3) allow for repeated measures in shorter intervals than what is possible with traditional neuropsychological tests. We were able to study a large, diverse sample using a focused computerized assessment battery (Cogstate) targeting neurocognitive processes most sensitive to change and predicted to be affected by MEKi (i.e., learning/memory, working memory, attention, and processing speed). We also used a complimentary rating scale (BRIEF) to evaluate real-world executive functioning. The entire assessment was completed in ≤30 minutes. See supplement for full test descriptions ( links.lww.com/NXG/A445 ). Statistical Design Changes in performance and ratings over time were evaluated by group-level analysis and individually based reliable change analyses. With both, we quantified whether outcomes changed over time in the sample as a whole. We also investigated whether changes in performance differed by age (dichotomized at a median of 12 years) and baseline performance (dichotomized as nonimpaired or impaired, using 1.5 SD below average). The age cutoff used the median split of our sample and was considered an appropriate division considering developmental changes around this age that are relevant to the study outcomes. First, we analyzed group-level changes with repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). We analyzed 2 follow-up time points separately to maximize the available sample at each time point. We calculated effect sizes between mean scores at each pair of visits to estimate the mean amount of change that occurred between time points. Second, we analyzed change in outcomes over time on an individual participant level, using a Reliable Change Index (RCI) methodology, which generates a confidence interval (CI) that identifies the expected range of change scores in the normative population, using a test's SD and test-retest reliability (see eMethods,  links.lww.com/NXG/A445 ). Once the CI cutoff is established, the cutoff and an individual's change score (T 2  − T 1 ) can be compared to determine whether a clinically significant change has occurred. Thus, RCI analysis allows investigation of whether a clinically significant, rather than a simply statistically significant, change has occurred, and in which individuals. Cogstate provides the within-subject SD to calculate RCI, and we calculated metrics for the BRIEF using normative data in the modified practice-adjusted RCI formula outlined in Chelune. 29 For each outcome, 2-tailed 90% CIs were constructed. In a normative sample, a 90% CI identifies 5% as decreased, 90% as stable, and 5% as improved. We chose 2-tailed because at this stage of research with MEKi, it is equally important to identify either detrimental (possibly neurotoxic) or positive effects on functioning. Individual change scores were calculated between the pretreatment and the 24-week and 48-week evaluations and classified as “declined,” “stable,” or “improved” on each outcome for each follow-up time point using RCI methodology. We then used 2 (group: normative/expected, NF) × 3 (change status: declined, stable, and improved) χ 2  to compare the frequencies of classification between the normative/expected (5/90/5%) and NF groups.  This statistical approach answers the following question: Does memory or executive functioning decrease or improve in a greater proportion of individuals who are taking an MEKi, compared with the proportion expected in the general population who are tested twice? We hypothesized that a greater proportion of individuals receiving an MEKi would change in performance compared with normative expectations. 30 Third, to assess the influence of age and baseline performance level on RCI-based classification, we used a set of 2 (age: ≤12 years, >12 years; baseline performance level: nonimpaired, impaired) × 3 (change status) χ 2  tests. This allowed us to test whether older or younger children were more likely to change and whether those with impaired scores at baseline were more likely to change than those with nonimpaired baseline performance.

PMID:16093333,Sensory neurons from Nf1 haploinsufficient mice exhibit increased excitability.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common genetic disorder characterized by tumor formation. People with NF1 also can experience more intense painful responses to stimuli, such as minor trauma, than normal. NF1 results from a heterozygous mutation of the NF1 gene, leading to decreased levels of neurofibromin, the protein product of the NF1 gene. Neurofibromin is a guanosine triphosphatase activating protein (GAP) for Ras and accelerates the conversion of active Ras-GTP to inactive Ras-GDP; therefore mutation of the NF1 gene frequently results in an increase in activity of the Ras transduction cascade. Using patch-clamp electrophysiological techniques, we examined the excitability of capsaicin-sensitive sensory neurons isolated from the dorsal root ganglia of adult mice with a heterozygous mutation of the Nf1 gene (Nf1+/-), analogous to the human mutation, in comparison to wildtype sensory neurons. Sensory neurons from adult Nf1+/- mice generated a more than twofold higher number of action potentials in response to a ramp of depolarizing current as wild-type neurons. Consistent with the greater number of action potentials, Nf1+/- neurons had lower firing thresholds, lower rheobase currents, and shorter firing latencies than wild-type neurons. Interestingly, nerve growth factor augmented the excitability of wild-type neurons in a concentration-related manner but did not further alter the excitability of the Nf1+/- sensory neurons. These data clearly suggest that GAPs, such as neurofibromin, can play a key role in the excitability of nociceptive sensory neurons. This increased excitability may explain the painful conditions experienced by people with NF1.",,Yue Wang; G D Nicol; D Wade Clapp; Cynthia M Hingtgen,Journal of neurophysiology,2005-12,10.1152/jn.00489.2005,abstract_only,False
PMID:34230200,Imaging Evaluation of Plexiform Neurofibromas in Neurofibromatosis Type 1: A Survey-Based Assessment.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess imaging utilization practices across clinical specialists in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) for the evaluation of symptomatic and asymptomatic children and adults with or without plexiform neurofibromas (PN). METHODS: An institutional review board-exempt survey was administered to medical practitioners caring for individuals with NF1 at the Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) meeting in September 2019. The survey included questions on respondent demographic data (9 questions), type of imaging obtained for asymptomatic (4 questions) and symptomatic (4 questions) people with and without PN, and utilization of diffusion-weighted imaging (2 questions). RESULTS: Thirty practitioners participated in the survey. Most were academic neuro-oncologists at high-volume (>10 patients/week) NF1 centers. Of 30 respondents, 26 had access to whole-body MRI (WB-MRI). The most common approach to an asymptomatic person without PN was no imaging (adults: 57% [17/30]; children: 50% [15/30]), followed by a screening WB-MRI (adults: 20% [6/30]; children: 26.7% [8/30]). The most common approach to a person with symptoms or known PN was regional MRI (adults: 90% [27/30]; children: 93% [28/30]), followed by WB-MRI (adults: 20% [6/30]; children: 36.7% [11/30]). WB-MRI was most often obtained to evaluate a symptomatic child with PN (37% [11/30]). CONCLUSIONS: More than 90% of practitioners indicated they would obtain a regional MRI in a symptomatic patient without known or visible PN. Otherwise, there was little consensus on imaging practices. Given the high prevalence of PN and risk of malignant conversion in this patient population, there is a need to define imaging-based guidelines for optimal clinical care and the design of future clinical trials.",,Shivani Ahlawat; K Ina Ly; Laura M Fayad; Michael J Fisher; Andrés J Lessing; Dale J Berg; Johannes M Salamon; Victor-Felix Mautner; Dusica Babovic-Vuksanovic; Eva Dombi; Gordon Harris; Scott R Plotkin; Jaishri Blakeley,Neurology,2021-08-17,10.1212/WNL.0000000000012437,abstract_only,False
PMID:16906226,The neurofibromin GAP-related domain rescues endothelial but not neural crest development in Nf1 mice.,"Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1; also known as von Recklinghausen's disease) is a common autosomal-dominant condition primarily affecting neural crest-derived tissues. The disease gene, NF1, encodes neurofibromin, a protein of over 2,800 amino acids that contains a 216-amino acid domain with Ras-GTPase-activating protein (Ras-GAP) activity. Potential therapies for NF1 currently in development and being tested in clinical trials are designed to modify NF1 Ras-GAP activity or target downstream effectors of Ras signaling. Mice lacking the murine homolog (Nf1) have mid-gestation lethal cardiovascular defects due to a requirement for neurofibromin in embryonic endothelium. We sought to determine whether the GAP activity of neurofibromin is sufficient to rescue complete loss of function or whether other as yet unidentified functions of neurofibromin might also exist. Using cre-inducible ubiquitous and tissue-specific expression, we demonstrate that the isolated GAP-related domain (GRD) rescued cardiovascular development in Nf1(-/-) embryos, but overgrowth of neural crest-derived tissues persisted, leading to perinatal lethality. These results suggest that neurofibromin may possess activities outside of the GRD that modulate neural crest homeostasis and that therapeutic approaches solely aimed at targeting Ras activity may not be sufficient to treat tumors of neural crest origin in NF1.",,Fraz A Ismat; Junwang Xu; Min Min Lu; Jonathan A Epstein,The Journal of clinical investigation,2006-09,10.1172/JCI28341,abstract_only,False
PMID:7706208,An exon 8-spliced out transcript of neurofibromatosis 2 gene is constitutively expressed in various human tissues.,"We succeeded in cloning the exon 8-spliced out transcript of neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) gene in human glioma cell lines. We then investigated the expression of the spliced out form in various human tissues by PCR analysis followed by Southern blot hybridization and sequencing to evaluate whether it was generated by normal alternative splicing or by a splicing mutation. The analysis revealed the splicing out of exon 8 in the various tissues, and the transcript missing exon 8 should thus be considered as a product of normal alternative splicing. Our results further support the possibility that the NF2 gene expresses multiple alternatively-spliced transcripts variantly in different tissue types.",,T Hitotsumatsu; T Kitamoto; T Iwaki; M Fukui; J Tateishi,Journal of biochemistry,1994-12,10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a124664,abstract_only,False
PMID:24371224,Tumor suppressor alterations cooperate to drive aggressive mesotheliomas with enriched cancer stem cells via a p53-miR-34a-c-Met axis.,"Malignant mesothelioma is a highly aggressive, asbestos-related cancer frequently marked by mutations of both NF2 and CDKN2A. We demonstrate that germline knockout of one allele of each of these genes causes accelerated onset and progression of asbestos-induced malignant mesothelioma compared with asbestos-exposed Nf2(+/-) or wild-type mice. Ascites from some Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice exhibited large tumor spheroids, and tail vein injections of malignant mesothelioma cells established from these mice, but not from Nf2(+/-) or wild-type mice, produced numerous tumors in the lung, suggesting increased metastatic potential of tumor cells from Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice. Intraperitoneal injections of malignant mesothelioma cells derived from Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice into severe combined immunodeficient mice produced tumors that penetrated the diaphragm and pleural cavity and harbored increased cancer stem cells (CSC). Malignant mesothelioma cells from Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice stained positively for CSC markers and formed CSC spheroids in vitro more efficiently than counterparts from wild-type mice. Moreover, tumor cells from Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice showed elevated c-Met expression/activation, which was partly dependent on p53-mediated regulation of miR-34a and required for tumor migration/invasiveness and maintenance of the CSC population. Collectively, these studies demonstrate in vivo that inactivation of Nf2 and Cdkn2a cooperate to drive the development of highly aggressive malignant mesotheliomas characterized by enhanced tumor spreading capability and the presence of a CSC population associated with p53/miR-34a-dependent activation of c-Met. These findings suggest that cooperativity between losses of Nf2 and Cdkn2a plays a fundamental role in driving the highly aggressive tumorigenic phenotype considered to be a hallmark of malignant mesothelioma.","Materials and Methods Animals and asbestos treatments p16/p19  (01XB2, FVB/N.129- +/− Cdkn2a ) mice ( tm1Rdp 6 ), obtained from the Mouse Models of Human Cancers Consortium, were crossed to  Nf2  mice to obtain all of the genotypes used herein. All mice were in a comparable FVB genetic background. Mice at 6–8 weeks of age were injected i.p. every 3 weeks with 400 μg crocidolite (UICC, SPI Supplies) (total, 3.2 mg/mouse) ( +/− 6 , 7 ). Mice were scored as having MM based on histological evidence and/or if tumor cells exhibited a combination of three or more MM markers, including mesothelin, as assessed by reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) and/or IHC. Studies were performed according to NIH's  Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals . The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the Fox Chase Cancer Center (protocol 00-26). Experimental metastasis and intraperitoneal orthographic transplant assays As an experimental assay for metastasis, 0.5 × 10 6  or 1.0 × 10 6  murine MM cells were injected into the tail vein of recipient SCID mice. Each individual cell line was injected in triplicate into 3 independent SCID mice. After 4-weeks, mice were euthanized via CO 2  asphyxiation, and the lungs were excised, fixed in buffered formalin, and embedded in paraffin. Lung sections were stained using H&E or IHC. For orthographic transplant studies, 0.5-1.0 × 10 6  MM cells were injected i.p. into recipient SCID mice. After 4 weeks, mice were euthanized, and organs and tumors were harvested for histopathology. H&E-stained slides of all organs were analyzed to look for invasion and frank metastases in each recipient SCID mouse. Immunohistochemistry Paraffin blocks were cut into 5-μm sections and then placed on positively charged microscope slides. Sections were dewaxed in xylene and hydrated through a graded ethanol series. Heat-induced antigen retrieval was then performed in 10 mmol/L sodium citrate (pH6.0) in a microwave for 10 min. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by immersing slides in 3% H 2 O 2  in PBS for 30 min. Slides were then incubated for 30 min with goat-derived blocking serum, followed by overnight incubation in a 1:250 dilution of total c-met rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) or a 1:50 dilution of phosphorylated c-met (phosphorylated tyrosine sites pY1230, pY1234, and pY1236) rabbit polyclonal antibody (Invitrogen) at 4°C. Slides were next, incubated with goat anti-rabbit biotinylated secondary antibody for 30 min and then with streptavidin peroxidase for 30 min, both at room temperature. 3, 3′-Diaminobenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich) substrate chromogen was applied for 4 min. Other slides were stained in a 1:100 dilution of Ki67 rat monoclonal antibody (Dako) following the IHC procedure described above. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted with permount (Fisher). Additional slides were incubated with antibodies against pan-cytokeratin and cytokeratin 8 (Sigma) or mesothelin (Santa Cruz). Other sections were stained with antibodies against Sox2, Nanog, Oct 3/4 and beta-catenin. Primary cell cultures MM cells were isolated from ascitic fluid and/or peritoneal lavage as described ( 6 , 7 ). All primary cell cultures used for molecular analyses were from passages ≤6. PCR analysis was carried out on all cultures that expressed mesothelial markers, and immunoblotting was performed on a random set of cultures to validate the PCR results. Cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and Penicillin/Streptamycin. Drug treatments of MM cells MM cells in log growth phase were treated with vehicle control or c-Met inhibitors SU-11274 (5 μM) or SGX2943 (5 μM Calbiochem) for 24 h before harvesting for protein extraction, immunoblotting, scratch or aldefluor-based assays. MM cells were also treated with vehicle control or 100 μM etoposide (a gift of M. Murphy, Wistar) for 48 h and harvested for both RTPCR and immunoblot analysis. Cells were nucleofected with siRNA against  Tp53  or  miR34a  (Dharmacon) using Amaxa Nucleofection Kit R and program T20 of an Amaxa nucleofector machine. Cells were harvested 48 or 72 h post-nucleofection, and RNA or protein was extracted using standard methods Immunoblotting Immunoblots were prepared with 50 μg of protein/sample, as described ( 9 ). Antibodies against phospho P-Met, Akt, P-Akt, and MAPK (1:1,000 dilution), from Cell Signaling, and against c-Met, P-Erk and β-actin (1:1,000), from Santa Cruz, and p53 (1:500, NCL-p53-505, Novocastra) were used. Appropriate secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit-, anti-mouse- and anti-goat-HRP – Santa Cruz) were used at a 1:2,000 dilution. Real-time PCR mRNA expression of murine  Met ,  miR34a  and  Ppib  (peptidylprolyl isomerase D) were measured using TaqMan technology and an ABI Prism 7900 Sequence Detection System. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. For each sample, first-strand cDNA was generated from total RNA using a High Capacity cDNA kit (Applied Biosystems), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reactions were prepared in triplicate for each gene using TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix and the following TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems):  Met  (Mm01156980_m1),  miR34a  (mmu-mir-34a), and  Ppib  (Mm00478295_m1). 96-well plates were loaded, and reactions were cycled using TaqMan universal cycling conditions. During thermal cycling, the threshold cycle (Ct) was determined for each sample by taking the average of 3 replicates. The average Ct value for the control gene  Ppib  was subtracted from the average Ct value for each target gene ( Met ,  Mdm2, and mIR34a ) to normalize the amount of sample RNA added to the reaction. The comparative Ct method was used to determine the level of the target gene mRNA in MM cell cultures from  Nf2 +/− ;p16/p19 +/−  and WT mice relative to that in the normal sample (Applied Biosystems User Bulletin #2, October 2001): relative quantification = 2−Ct, where Ct = average Ct (diseased) − average Ct (normal). Wound-healing assay MM cell lines 87 and 129 from  Nf2 +/− ;p16/p19 +/−  mice were seeded on a 6-well tissue culture plate and grown to confluence. Upon confluency, monolayers were scratched with a 200-μL pipette tip, and a marked area was photographed with light microscopy at 40X magnification, using phase-contrast microscopy. Cells were treated with DMSO or SU-11274 (2 μM) for 24 h, and then the same marked area was rephotographed. Matrigel invasion assay In vitro  invasion of MM cell from  Nf2 +/− ;p16/p19 +/−  wild-type mice were measured using 24-well BioCoat Matrigel invasion chambers (Becton Dickinson). The lower compartment contained RPMI medium with 10% FBS as a chemoattractant. In the upper compartment, 2.5 × 10 4  cells/well were placed in serum-free medium and incubated for 22 h at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 . For similar experiments with a c-Met inhibitor, 5 μM SU-11274 or vehicle control was included in media of both the top and bottom compartments of the invasion chambers; then MM cells were seeded into the invasion chambers. Invading cells on the underside of the Matrigel membrane were fixed with 10% formaldehyde and stained using Diff-Quik® Stain (Dade Behring). Cells were counted with a light microscope, and invasion was estimated as the average number of cells in five fields using a 10X objective. Tumor spheroid growth assay of CSCs MM cells (5,000-10,000 cells/60 mm plate, Becton Dickinson Falcon) were seeded in serum-free DMEM/F12 media supplemented with B27 supplement, EGF (10 ng/mL), basic FGF (10 ng/mL) and Penicillin/Streptomycin. Spheroids were photographed using light microscopy after 1-2 days of culture. MM cell lines were also subjected to spheroid assays in the presence or absence of SU11279 (5 μM) or SGX523 (5 μM) for 1-2 days, and spheroid size/number was determined using light microscopy. CD24 immunofluorescent staining/flow cytometry analysis 1 × 10 6  MM cells were incubated with or without 10 μL of anti-CD24 FITC-labeled antibody (BD Biosciences) for 30-40 min in 100 μL of PBS. Cells were washed in PBS 3 times and then resuspended in 500 μL of PBS for flow cytometry analysis. The percentage of CD24-staining cells was determined using a FACscan Flow Cytometer (Becton Dickinson) and quantitated using FlowJo analysis software.",Craig W Menges; Yuwaraj Kadariya; Deborah Altomare; Jacqueline Talarchek; Erin Neumann-Domer; Yue Wu; Guang-Hui Xiao; Irina M Shapiro; Vihren N Kolev; Jonathan A Pachter; Andres J Klein-Szanto; Joseph R Testa,Cancer research,2014-02-15,10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-2062,minimal,True
PMID:34782607,Pathogenic neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) RNA splicing resolved by targeted RNAseq.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is caused by loss-of-function variants in the NF1 gene. Approximately 10% of these variants affect RNA splicing and are either missed by conventional DNA diagnostics or are misinterpreted by in silico splicing predictions. Therefore, a targeted RNAseq-based approach was designed to detect pathogenic RNA splicing and associated pathogenic DNA variants. For this method RNA was extracted from lymphocytes, followed by targeted RNAseq. Next, an in-house developed tool (QURNAs) was used to calculate the enrichment score (ERS) for each splicing event. This method was thoroughly tested using two different patient cohorts with known pathogenic splice-variants in NF1. In both cohorts all 56 normal reference transcript exon splice junctions, 24 previously described and 45 novel non-reference splicing events were detected. Additionally, all expected pathogenic splice-variants were detected. Eleven patients with NF1 symptoms were subsequently tested, three of which have a known NF1 DNA variant with a putative effect on RNA splicing. This effect could be confirmed for all 3. The other eight patients were previously without any molecular confirmation of their NF1-diagnosis. A deep-intronic pathogenic splice variant could now be identified for two of them (25%). These results suggest that targeted RNAseq can be successfully used to detect pathogenic RNA splicing variants in NF1.","Methods Ethics approval and consent to participate All patients provided written or oral consent for either coded use of their material to study the clinical utility of RNAseq according to their diagnostic question or anonymous use of their material for improving diagnostic testing in general. The institutional Medical Ethics Committee (medisch-ethische toetsingscommissie or METC) of the Maastricht University Medical Center confirmed that the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO) does not apply to our study (METC 2021–2666) and that an official approval of this study by the committee is not required. Patient derived cells White blood cells were isolated using ficoll (Sigma-Aldrich) from fresh whole blood (collected in EDTA tubes) and used either fresh or frozen in FCS with 10% of DMSO for subsequent short term-culture in a complete medium consisting of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 12.5% FCS, 1x L-glutamine (Gibco), 0.8 mM sodiumpyruvate (Gibco), 17 mM Hepes buffer (Gibco), 4.2 × 10–2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Gibco), 42 units/ml penicillin–streptomycin and 0.21 g/ml amphotericin B solution (Sigma-Aldrich). Lymphocyte growth was stimulated with 50 µl/ml PHA (Gibco) and 10 units/ml of IL-2 (Roche). At day 7, 4–6 h before harvesting the cells, each culture was split evenly and one part was treated with 200 µg/ml of puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich) as an inhibitor of nonsense mediated RNA decay (NMD) . 39 For the initial validation of the targeted RNAseq procedure, RNA was isolated from uncultured peripheral blood lymphocytes of nine patients from the pre-implantation genetic testing (PGT) program at our institution, who had a pathogenic  NF1  variant that leads to aberrant splicing (Table  1 ). Pheriphal blood lymphocytes were isolated and stored in DMSO in liquid nitrogen within 24 h after collecting the EDTA blood. Two additional samples from anonymous patients without a clinical diagnosis of NF1 were included as wild type controls. These validation samples were enriched for  NF1  RNA using NuGEN SPET for RNA (see RNA isolation and Target enrichment/Library preparation). The diagnostic performance of targeted RNAseq was further assessed using RNA samples shipped from the Centre for Medical Genetics, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium (Table  2 ). RNA was isolated from blood lymphocytes (collected in EDTA tubes) that were short-term cultured. The molecular results of these samples were initially blinded, to test the ability to detect pathogenic  NF1  splicing events without prior knowledge, comparable to the diagnostic setting. These replication cohort samples were enriched for  NF1  using both Nugen SPET for RNA and for  NF1 / SPRED1  using Agilent SureSelect RNA Target Enrichment (see RNA isolation and Target enrichment/Library preparation). This allowed a direct performance comparison of these two different commercial platforms. To further validate the targeted RNAseq approach and show its added value for the detection of pathogenic splicing events complementary to DNA diagnostics, an additional set of twelve patients was selected (Table  3 ). Eight patients were included because of having (or suspected of having) a clinical NF1 diagnosis without molecular confirmation. While two patients had a  NF1  DNA variant with unclear effect on RNA splicing (variant of unknown significance – VUS [class 3]) and one patient had an  NF1  DNA variant likely to affect splicing (likely pathogenic – LP [class 4]). One additional sample from an anonymous patient without a clinical diagnosis of NF1 was included. Available material from these patients, i.e. either lymphocytes directly isolated from blood or short-term cultured cells with or without NMD inhibition, was used to isolate RNA. Blood was collected in EDTA tubes and shipped and processed within a maximum of 48 h in our lab, except und8 that came into the lab > 48 h after blood draw. These samples were enriched for  NF1 / SPRED1  using SureSelect RNA Target Enrichment (see RNA isolation and Target enrichment/Library preparation). RNA isolation and target enrichment/library preparation Total RNA was purified and DNAseI treated using RNeasy Plus micro columns (Qiagen). Purified RNA was used as input for the SureSelect RNA Target Enrichment (below) and for the Ovation cDNA module followed by custom Ovation target enrichment, based on single primer enrichment technology (SPET) for RNA, according to the protocol of the manufacturer (NuGEN). Primer design for  NF1  ( NM_000267.3 ) was performed by the manufacturer for the coding regions and 5’/3’UTR with a probe spacing of 150 bp. Library preparation was according to the manufacturer instructions. Additionally, the SureSelect RNA Target Enrichment for Illumina Paired‐End Multiplexed Sequencing kit (Agilent; protocol version 2.2.1) was used to target the  NF1 ( NM_000267.3 ) and  SPRED1  ( NM_152592.2 ) coding regions and 5’/3’UTR. Probe design was performed using the Agilent eArray online tool, setting the region of interest to minus 100nt of the normal 5’exon boundary and plus 150nt of the normal 3’exon boundary and 6x tiling of probes. Library preparation was according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Primers (SPET) and/or probes (Sureselect) design is available upon request. Paired-end sequencing (2x150bp) was performed on a NextSeq500 instrument (Illumina) using NextSeq500/550 high output kit v2 (Illumina). Read alignment RNAseq reads were mapped with the STAR mapper (Version 2.4.1d) and an index created from HS.GRCh37 with 92 bp overhang . We performed unique mapping onto the genome without trimming and with max. 10 mismatches per read while no chimeric reads were allowed (default STAR settings). To elucidate the PCR amplification bias, de-duplication was performed either using a build in Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) in the probe design (NuGen SPET) or by removing identical reads (Agilent Sureselect). Duplicate read pair detection was carried out with Picard tools ( 40 https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard ). Start and end positions from STAR output refer to the first nucleotide in the intron (AG |  g u) and last nucleotide of the intron (a g  | G), respectively. Quantitative enrichment of aberrant splicing events in targeted RNAseq—QURNAs The QURNAs computational pipeline was developed to identify sample-specific splicing events in targeted RNAseq data, including novel and possibly aberrant transcripts or increased abundance of normal isoforms (see Supplementary fig.  1 ). To minimize the number of possible artefacts or non-relevant events in the QURNAs data analysis, it is important to perform QURNAs analysis on a group of at least 4 samples that are equally processed. This way, events that are either induced by sample specific treatment, and/or are more or less equally present in all samples from the group, get a neutral enrichment score of ~1 in the QURNAs output after normalization and inter-sample comparison (see below for methodology). QURNAs is available at  https://dataverse.nl/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=hdl:10411/LY8ZQ4 . The mapping of short sequences to the reference genome without prior assumptions about transcript architecture, enables statistical evaluation of significance of observed RNA isoforms. De novo prediction of splice junctions from RNAseq data QURNAs first creates a collection of splice sites based on the reads mapped onto the genome (BAM file). For these splice sites, reads in BAM files that overlap with the splice site are counted. While iterating over all reads in the region, two additional features are counted to estimate the fraction of the reads in the region congruent with the splice junction. First, the number of reads is calculated that overlap with and contain the last nucleotide of the exon at the donor site. This includes, next to reads with a different acceptor site, “unbroken” reads corresponding to intron retention events. The second count consists of reads that “span” the splice site, thus start upstream of the nucleotide and end downstream, but do not necessarily contain the nucleotide next to the donor site in their sequence ( e.g ., exon skipping events or splice events that use an alternative upstream donor site). Enrichment score (ERS) calculation Enrichment for a splicing event in a sample is calculated as follows. For each splice site, a relative read count  l  is calculated that measures the fraction of aligned reads that are congruent with the splice site among all the reads that span the splice site. Formally, we count reads ( spl r ) that are congruent with the splice  spl spl =(start,end)  i.e ., the genomic alignment of the read contains a gap between exact (start, end) positions, allowing for other insertions/deletions in the read. Reads for each of the splice  r  are considered relatively to reads that  spl span  the splice site  S  (spanning reads). These start their genomic alignment upstream of the donor site and end downstream of this site but do not necessarily share the same donor or acceptor sites. To minimize the impact of spurious reads and sequencing noise, pseudocounts of at least 10 reads and up to 1% of spanning reads (max(10, spl S  1%)) are added to both  spl r  and  spl s . The relative read count  spl l  for each sample is then calculated using Eq. ( spl 1 ). In sample  i , after calculating the relative splice read count, enrichment of reads   is calculated by comparing the relative read count to the average read counts from other samples using Eq.

				\begin{document}$$l{\prime}_i^{spl}$$\end{document} l ′ i s p l Statistical significance of enriched isoforms To test whether splice isoforms are expressed at significantly higher levels in a sample, a two-tailed proportion test that tests the null hypothesis that proportions in several groups are the same is used. For each splice junction a group of trials as number of spanning reads ( s ) that includes reads that support the junction  spl r  (positive outcome of the trial) is defined. If significant ( spl p ( spl ) < 0.01), the proportion test rejects the null hypothesis that the expression of the splice junction is the same in all samples. The test assumes independence between trials in the group and this is not the case for RNAseq due to read redundancy and overlap between 150-bp reads. The marginal information contributed by additional reads, drops with the number of reads mapped to a splice junction. To reflect lower marginal information, we use square root of RNAseq read numbers using Eq. ( 3 ) where  i  corresponds to subsequent samples. To determine the significance of a splice event in a specific sample  i , the reads for the sample are compared to the background distribution of reads in remaining samples, testing the enrichment hypothesis (one-tailed test expecting enrichment) using Eq. ( 4 ). Note that in this statistical framework it is possible that  ( p spl )  < 0.01  but  ( p spl )  i > 0.01  for all samples   (the distribution of reads is different between samples, but none are significant). This is, for example the case for WT splice isoforms in mutated samples where the WT isoform becomes depleted ( i ( p spl ) tests only for enrichment). i Interpretation QURNAs output The QURNAs output for all splicing events was reduced with an additional GAP filter of >3 ((pos end_STAR – pos start_STAR) + 1), to exclude artefacts that do not represent splicing since the intron size would be smaller than 4 nucleotides. The absolute read counts of all normal exon splice-junctions in the reference transcript were inspected to confirm good sequence coverage throughout the gene for all samples. The ERS values of these reference exon splice junctions were subsequently checked for a possible drop (normal reference exon splice junctions are expected to have a median ERS ~1). Highly expressed alternative splicing events usually result in lower expression of the normal exon splice junctions in the same region, reflected by such a drop (ERS <0.8 or the lowest value of the total group of samples). Subsequently, all splicing events for a specific sample were sorted high to low based on the ERS. All events with ERS > 5 were further evaluated to discriminate possible artefacts from true alternative splicing events. Importantly, relevant ERS values can be lower than 5 when; 1) the splice variant gives rise to multiple different splicing events, instead of one or two major events; 2) the splicing events concerns an upregulated normal splicing event which is also present in other samples in the run at lower expression levels or 3) when 2 samples are present in the same run with the same effect on splicing. Alamut v2.15 (Interactive Biosoftware) was used to identify true splice-donor and acceptor sites based on in silico prediction. Regions with alternative splicing were further inspected in the BAM file in a genome browser (IGV and Alamut) to check for possible causal sequence variants in close proximity. Allelic imbalance was assessed by comparing heterozygous variants in the DNA vs the RNA sequences in IGV. A minimum of at least 2 heterozygous variants in the coding regions and/or UTRs was considered informative to assess allelic imbalance. Consistent variant allele ratio’s in the sequence from 60/40% to 70/30% were considered as modest imbalance, 70/30% to 80/20% as intermediate and >80/20% as strong. But these boundaries are set arbitrarily for now and need further validation with more samples, and are also under the assumption that the imbalance is for the same allele. Since short-read sequencing was performed, the SNP phase is not known. Nomenclature The description of genetic variants follows the Human Genetic Variation Society (HGVS) approved guidelines , where c.1 (and r.1) is the A of the ATG translation initiation codon. Alternative splicing events are those incorporating splice junctions not present in the reference transcript  41 NM_000267 . Exon numbering used by QURNAs and in the tables is systematically 1–57 using  NM_000267 , for conversion according to the NF1 best practice meeting  this numbering is +1 for all exons after exon 30 (LRG_214). 42 Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the  Nature Research Reporting Summary  linked to this article.",R Koster; R D Brandão; D Tserpelis; C E P van Roozendaal; C N van Oosterhoud; K B M Claes; A D C Paulussen; M Sinnema; M Vreeburg; V van der Schoot; C T R M Stumpel; M P G Broen; L Spruijt; M C J Jongmans; S A J Lesnik Oberstein; A S Plomp; M Misra-Isrie; F A Duijkers; M J Louwers; R Szklarczyk; K W J Derks; H G Brunner; A van den Wijngaard; M van Geel; M J Blok,NPJ genomic medicine,2021-11-15,10.1038/s41525-021-00258-w,minimal,True
PMID:39669605,Next-generation variant exon screening: Moving forward in routine genetic disease investigations.,"PURPOSE: Patients with genetic diseases often seek testing to reach a firm diagnosis. Based on clinical phenotypes, exome sequencing for small-nucleotide variations or array-based methods for copy-number variations (CNVs) are commonly offered to identify the underlying causative genetic variants. In this study, we investigated whether data from a standard ES test could be used to additionally identify pathogenic CNVs and increase diagnostic yield. METHODS: Prospectively, 134 patients presenting with a skin condition suspected of being genetic in origin were offered the next-generation variant exon screening (ngVES) test. Sequencing data were analyzed for both single-nucleotide variants and CNVs using established algorithms. RESULTS: The positive detection rate for skin diseases using ngVES was 66% (88/134) with the most common diagnoses being neurofibromatosis type1 ( CONCLUSION: The advances in the ngVES bioinformatics pipeline are proofs of concept, which improved identification of genetic variants associated with skin disease. Simultaneous single-nucleotide variants/INDEL and CNV detection by this approach demonstrates ngVES potential as a first-tier screen for any suspected genetic disease.","Methods Prospectively, 134 patients presenting with a skin condition suspected of being genetic in origin were offered the next-generation variant exon screening (ngVES) test. Sequencing data were analyzed for both single-nucleotide variants and CNVs using established algorithms. Materials and Methods Study samples For the clinical ngVES study, we prospectively analyzed 135 genomic DNA samples extracted from peripheral blood cells from patients presenting with clinical features of skin disease suspected to potentially be genetic in origin ( Supplemental Table 1 ). ngVES ngVES uses the additional CNV analysis tool exome hidden Markov model (XHMM)  to perform secondary data mining, and it includes the detection of CNVs utilizing standard ES data. ES was performed by standard procedures using the IGT-T192V1 Plus panel (Integrated DNA Technologies) to capture selected targets. This panel covers a 41.97 Mb target region of the human genome, including the CDS regions of 20,716 nuclear coding genes and their immediate intronic sequences, as well as the whole mitochondrial genome. A total of 50 ng of genomic DNA purified from peripheral blood (Qiagen DNA Blood Midi/Mini kit, Qiagen GmbH) was fragmented in Tagmentation Buffer 1 to an average size of between 200 to 300 bp and then enriched with Bead-Linked Transposomes (Illumina). Fragments were then end-repaired, and 1 adenosine base added at the 3’ end. The modified fragments were then ligated with barcoded adapters (Fast DNA Library Prep Set CW3045M, CWBIO Inc). After purification with XP beads and PCR amplification with sequencing primers (6-12 cycles), libraries were hybridized with the IDT exon baits. Following elution, targets were then re-amplified by PCR (12 cycles) and purified with XP beads. Target quantity was evaluated using Qubit 4.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc). Finally, sequence ready target libraries were analyzed on the Novaseq6000 platform (Illumina) using the 150 bp pair-end sequencing mode. Raw image files were processed using CASAVA v1.82 for base calling and generating the raw sequencing data. For analysis of SNVs/indels and CNVs, FASTQ files were first aligned to the human reference genome (hg19) by the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (bwa-0.7.15), and PCR duplications that cause bias in copy-number analysis were filtered out using Sambamba (v0.6.6) ( 17 https://github.com/biod/sambamba ). In QC analysis, the average read number per sample was 36.8M (26-52M), the average sequencing depth was 114× (90-150×, with 20× coverage above 95%) and the sequencing Q30 accuracy was ≥90%. SNVs/indel variants and SNPs were called using version 3.8 of the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK). Annotation databases utilized included (1) human population databases, such as gnomAD ( http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/ ), the 1000 Genome Project ( http://browser.1000genomes.org ), and dbSNP ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp ), (2) in silico prediction algorithms, such as SIFT ( http://sift.jcvi.org ), FATHMM ( http://fathmm.biocompute.org.uk ), MutationAssessor ( http://mutationassessor.org ), CADD ( http://cadd.gs.washington.edu ), and SPIDEX ( http://tools.genes.toronto.edu/ ), and (3) disease and phenotype databases, such as OMIM ( http://www.omim.org ), ClinVar ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar ), HGMD ( http://www.hgmd.org ), and HPO ( https://hpo.jax.org/app/ ). Variants were classified into 5 categories, “pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely benign,” and “benign,” according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines for interpretation of genetic variants. 18 The CNV analysis tool exome hidden Markov model (XHMM) was used for exon CNV calling. First, at least 20 libraries analyzed in the same flow cell were used to build a baseline reference set with a minimum correlation coefficient of >0.94 for copy number. The copy-number ratio of exon CNVs was calculated by dividing the mapped exon reads per kilobase per million (RPKM) value of the target sample by the average RPKM value of reference libraries in the same sequencing flow cell. Allowing a 20% standard deviation, exon copy numbers of 0.8 to 1.2 and 2.8 to 3.2 against reference (1.8-2.2) was used to define deletions and duplications, respectively. Confirmatory molecular tests for CNVs Pathogenic variants detected by ngVES were independently confirmed by further molecular tests. SNVs and INDELs were verified by either interactive genomics viewer plot sequence alignments of the allelic molecules and/or by Sanger sequencing. Small CNVs (<100 kb) were confirmed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification.",Conghui Wang; Panlai Shi; Hongbin Liang; David S Cram; Donald A Leigh; Xiangdong Kong,Genetics in medicine open,2024,10.1016/j.gimo.2024.101816,minimal,True
PMID:30274822,Exhaustive non-synonymous variants functionality prediction enables high resolution characterization of the neurofibromin architecture.,"BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is caused by heterozygous loss-of-function variants in the NF1 gene encoding neurofibromin which serves as a tumor suppressor that inhibits RAS signaling and regulates cell proliferation and differentiation. While, the only well-established functional domain in the NF1 protein is the GAP-related domain (GRD), most of the identified non-truncating disease-causing variants are located outside of this domain, supporting the existence of other important disease-associated domains. Identifying these domains may reveal novel functions of NF1. METHODS: By implementing inferential statistics combined with machine-learning methods, we developed a novel NF1-specific functional prediction model that focuses on nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs). The model enables annotating all possible NF1 nonsynonymous variants, thus mapping the range of pathogenic non-truncating variants at the codon level across the NF1 gene. FINDINGS: The generated model demonstrates high absolute prediction value for missense and splice-site variations (area under the ROC curve of 0.96) outperforming 14 other established models. By reviewing the entire dataset of nonsynonymous variants, two novel domains (Armadillo type fold 1 and 2) were identified as being associated with pathogenicity (OR 1.86; CI 1.04 to 3.34 and OR 2.08; CI 1.08 to 4.04, respectively; P < .05). Specific exons and codons associated with increased pathogenicity were also detected along the gene inside and outside the GRD domain. INTERPRETATION: The developed model, enabled better prediction of pathogenicity for variants in NF1 gene, as well as elucidation of novel NF1-associated domains in addition to the GRD. FUND: This work was partially supported by the Kahn foundation. DGE is supported by the all Manchester NIHR Biomedical Research Centre (IS-brC-1215-20007).","Methods By implementing inferential statistics combined with machine-learning methods, we developed a novel NF1-specific functional prediction model that focuses on nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs). The model enables annotating all possible  NF1  nonsynonymous variants, thus mapping the range of pathogenic non-truncating variants at the codon level across the  NF1  gene. 2 Methods 2.1 NF1  gene variant spectrum The complete spectrum of  NF1  SNVs includes 848,250 different variants. We first annotated each variant by its pathogenicity status as either pathogenic, benign or unknown. Pathogenic variants were collected from the Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD) database [ 17 ]. Pathogenicity status is based on the LOVD version used to train the model (05/2017). We note that pathogenicity status may change over time and therefore the annotations used at the time of model development should not be considered as the most up-to-date version. In order to determine which variants are benign we considered each variant's allele frequency in three different databases of healthy populations: The 1000 Genomes Project, The Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) and the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) [ 33 , 43 ]. Since NF1is an autosomal dominant disorder, any variant with an allele frequency above 0 in any of these populations, and that was not previously marked as pathogenic was considered to be benign. Variants that do not fall into either category, were considered as unknown. 2.2 Variant annotations Known  NF1  pathogenic variants were downloaded from LOVD [ 17 ]. Only nonsynonymous and synonymous SNVs with a status of pathogenic or probably pathogenic were collected. Variant annotation was performed using SnpEff [ 6 ] and included annotations gathered in dbNSFP [ 35 ]. All variant and feature positions are reported using the ENST00000356175 Ensembl transcript ( NM_000267 ). Alternatively spliced exons were not included in the analysis as the LOVD variants were specified only in accordance to ENST00000356175. The SnpEff tools allows for functional annotation of each variant (e.g whether it is synonymous/nonsynonymous/stop-gain/ etc. ) The dbNSFP database, adds various annotations to all potential nonsynonymous SNVs and splice site SNVs, including prediction scores from 16 prediction algorithms (SIFT [ 38 ], Polyphen2 [ 1 ], LRT [ 5 ], MutationTaster [ 42 ], MutationAssessor [ 41 ], FATHMM [ 44 ], MetaSVM, MetaLR [ 10 ], CADD [ 27 ], VEST [ 2 ], PROVEAN [ 4 ], M-CAP [ 24 ], MutPred [ 34 ], Eigen and Eigen PC [ 23 ] and dbscSNV [ 25 ]) and eight conservation scores (phyloP46way_primate, phyloP46way_placental, phyloP100way_vertebrate [ 40 ], phastCons46way_primate, phastCons46way_placental, phastCons100way_veterbrate [ 45 ], GERP++ [ 8 ] and SiPhy [ 19 ]). Healthy population databases included the 1000 genomes project [ 47 ], the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) and the Genome Aggregation Consortium (gnomAD) [ 33 ]. NF1 protein domain annotation was performed using Interpro [ 16 ] and Nextprot [ 20 ]. 2.3 Functional prediction model generation The purpose of the prediction model is to predict whether a given nonsynonymous or splice site variant is pathogenic or not. In order to generate the model we collected only variants that fall into one of these gene effect types (in accordance with sequence ontology terms [ 12 ]): missense variant ( N  = 17,909), missense variant splice region variant (missense variant within a splice site, within 1–3 bases of the exon;  N  = 738), splice donor intron variant (A splice variant that changes the 2 base pair region at the 5′ end of an intron;  N  = 126), splice region intron variant (intron variant within a splice site, within 3–8 bases of the intron;  N  = 226), splice acceptor intron variant (A splice variant that changes the 2 base region at the 3′ end of an intron;  N  = 116) and splice region synonymous variant (synonymous variant within a splice site, within 1–3 bases of the exon;  N  = 30). There are 19,145 such variants across the  NF1  gene, out of which, a total of 1463 variants were used to generate the model. 436 (30%) of which were known to be pathogenic and 1027 were observed in healthy populations and therefore deemed benign. The dataset was divided into two sets, one for the purpose of training the model (75%) and the other for validation (25%). Each variant in the dataset had 55 different features (i.e annotations) including: the variant's gene effect, amino acid position, exon number, domain regions and rankscores corresponding to the aforementioned, dbNSFP gathered, functional prediction and conservation scores. Categorical features were split into dummy variables resulting in 184 feature annotations. In order to select the most informative features, fifty random forest models were trained. Each model was trained on a different randomly selected variant set comprising 70% of the data. Feature importance was calculated by each model and overall feature importance was determined by the mean importance score. The best feature subset was identified by evaluating a Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model trained on an iteratively growing subset of the highest scoring features. The final feature set was composed of the top 75 features. Using the selected feature set, four machine learning algorithms were evaluated [GBM, Generalized Linera Model (GLM), Distributed Random Forest (DRF) and eXtremely Randomized Trees (XRT)]. Briefly, 100 different models were generated and a stacked ensemble learner of the best performing model from each algorithm type was then generated. All models were trained using 10-fold cross validation to minimize the logarithmic loss which penalizes classifiers that are confident about an incorrect classification. Models were trained and validated using the H2O R package [ 31 ]. 2.4 Statistical analysis The effect of variant type on pathogenicity was assessed using the Fisher's exact test. In cases where there was a variant type with only pathogenic or benign variants, and there were >100 variants of that type, odds estimations and their corresponding confidence intervals were approximated by adding one to each cell in the contingency table, penalizing the effect size (and test decision) towards no effect. The effect of gene region on pathogenicity was assessed using multivariate logistic regression, adjusting for variant type. ROC curves were compared using DeLong's test for two correlated ROC curves. In order to identify pathogenic codons, a bootstrap method was implemented, simulating 500,000 random score samples and calculating for each codon the rate of samples with an equal or more number of variants with a score higher than the selected threshold of 0.538 (corresponding to a false positive rate (FPR) of 1%). Comparison of the number of variants predicted to be pathogenic between regions was performed using Fisher's exact test. 2.5 Webserver development The webserver was developed using the shiny web application framework [ 3 ], and published on shinyapps.io, a cloud-service platform used to publish applications developed using shiny.",Ofer Isakov; Deeann Wallis; D Gareth Evans; Shay Ben-Shachar,EBioMedicine,2018-10,10.1016/j.ebiom.2018.09.039,minimal,True

PMID:32869517,Genome-wide association study of café-au-lait macule number in neurofibromatosis type 1.,"BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a tumor-predisposition disorder that arises due to pathogenic variants in tumor suppressor NF1. NF1 has variable expressivity that may be due, at least in part, from heritable elements such as modifier genes; however, few genetic modifiers have been identified to date. METHODS: In this study, we performed a genome-wide association analysis of the number of café-au-lait macules (CALM) that are considered a tumor-like trait as a clinical phenotype modifying NF1. RESULTS: A borderline genome-wide significant association was identified in the discovery cohort (CALM1, N = 112) between CALM number and rs12190451 (and rs3799603, r CONCLUSION: rs12190451 is located in a melanocyte-specific enhancer and may influence RPS6KA2 expression in melanocytes-warranting further functional studies.","Methods In this study, we performed a genome‐wide association analysis of the number of café‐au‐lait macules (CALM) that are considered a tumor‐like trait as a clinical phenotype modifying NF1. 2 METHODS 2.1 NF1 patients and CALM number in CALM1 and CALM2 cohorts CALM1 and CALM2 studies were approved by the Institutional Review Boards (IRB) and the NCI Special Studies IRB. All participants provided written informed consent prior to joining the studies. The NCI Special Studies IRB also approved the overall GWAS. The study was carried out according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Quantitative trait café‐au‐lait macule count data were collected from two cohorts, CALM1 (CALM number counted by DRS) and CALM2 (CALM number counted by AB), as described previously (Pemov et al.,  2014 ). Most of the patients in the CALM1 cohort were adults, while most patients in the CALM2 cohort were children (Table  1 ). All patients in the CALM2 cohort underwent whole‐body MRI and had at least one plexiform neurofibroma. In both cohorts, all CALMs ≥ 5 mm in longest diameter were counted. A Wood's lamp, which makes CALMs more visible, was used for CALM counting in CALM1, but not in CALM2. The log‐transformed CALM number, log 10  (CALM + 10), was analyzed adjusting for age, sex and body surface area (m 2 )   defined as in Mosteller,  = ( weight(kg) · height ( cm ) ) / 60 1987 . Differences in age, sex, body surface, and CALM number were compared by two‐sided  t ‐test in R assuming unequal variance between cohorts.

 2  < 0.2 within 50 SNPs, then again within 200 SNPs. Lastly, SNPs with MAF < 0.1 in European–Americans were excluded. The quality control protocol yielded 608,561 SNPs in 112 European–Americans with non‐missing CALM number. The CALM1 cohort included 57 unrelated individuals, 16 families with 2 members each, 5 families with 3 members each, and 2 families with 4 members each. 2.3 Genotypes for CALM2 samples for GWAS Genotyping for the replication cohort CALM2 samples was performed on Illumina Infinium Omni2.5 bead‐chips. Quality control measures were performed as described above although the retention rates for genotyping and calling rates were both lowered to ≥98% due to the smaller sample size. Samples with genotyping rate <95% from remaining European–Americans and SNPs with MAF < 0.2 were excluded—yielding 623,562 SNPs in 59 European–Americans with non‐missing CALM number, including two sibling pairs. To ensure compatibility between the genotyping data between the two cohorts, LitfOver (Hinrichs et al.,  2006 ) was used to convert genome positions in the CALM1 cohort (NCBI build 36, UCSC hg18) to corresponding positions in the CALM2 cohort (NCBI build 37 (UCSC hg19). 2.4 Targeted sequencing of candidate loci Targeted sequencing of candidate loci was carried out in 171 European–American samples using the AmpliSeq/IonTorrent platform, as per the manufacturer's instructions. A genotype was considered missing if its genotype quality score (GQ) was <10, its read depth (DP) score was <10 or the ratio of the genotype quality score (GQ) divided by genotype read depth (DP), GQ/DP was <0.5. Monomorphic SNPs and SNPs with a calling rate <90% and samples with a genotyping rate <90% were excluded leaving 176 SNPs in 157 samples. Quality control for targeted gene sequencing data was done using SNP & Variation Suite v8.3.4 ( http://goldenhelix.com/products/SNP_Variation/index.html ) and PLINK (Purcell et al.,  2007 ). 2.5 Tests of association In each cohort, tests of association between each SNP and log‐transformed CALM number, adjusted for age, sex, and body surface area, were performed with EMMAX (Kang et al.,  2010 ) with an IBS kinship matrix considering possible spurious association due to genetic relatedness. Simple linear regression (SLR) ignoring genetic relatedness was also performed; these results are not shown because the correlations of the  p ‐values for EMMAX and SLR for the CALM1 and CALM2 cohorts were 0.95 and 0.99, respectively. In the targeted gene sequencing samples, tests of association were performed by SLR between each SNP in  RPS6KA2  (OMIM 601685; GenBank  NM_021135.6 ) and the log‐transformed CALM number, adjusted for age, sex, and body surface area, for the CALM1 and CALM2 cohorts, both separately and combined. An additional covariate, cohort (CALM1, CALM2), as well as age, sex, and body surface area were adjusted in the mega analysis for combined‐targeted gene sequencing data. Candidate loci were defined as those with suggestive genome‐wide significance ( p  <1 × 10 −5 ) in the GWAS of either cohort or in the meta‐analysis. 2.6 Meta‐analysis Meta‐analyses between the CALM1 and CALM2 cohort studies were performed with METAL (Willer, Li, & Abecasis,  2010 ) with weights proportional to the square‐root of the sample size for each study (Stouffer, Suchman, Devinney, Star, & Williams,  1949 ), with genomic control correction of input statistics enabled. Heterogeneity analyses including I 2  statistics, the percentage of variation between cohorts due to heterogeneity rather than chance, were also performed in meta‐analyses. 2.7 ComPaSS‐GWAS analysis The second approach for corroboration of SNP associations used ComPaSS‐GWAS (Sabourin et al.,  2018 ), a method based on complementary pairs stability selection (Shah & Samworth,  2013 ) with a regression based GWAS analysis. ComPaSS‐GWAS approximates replication by randomly splitting a sample in half (into a pseudo‐discovery and pseudo‐replication set) multiple times and looking for corroboration of results between each random split. ComPaSS‐GWAS returns a corroboration score between 0 and 1, indicating the proportion of random splits where the SNPs were corroborated for the specified within‐split significance parameter. The primary focus of ComPaSS‐GWAS is for situations where appropriate independent replication data are either not available or when the replication cohort is too small to sufficiently bolster the primary cohort's findings in a meta‐analysis. ComPaSS‐GWAS may also be useful when heterogeneity between the cohorts affects the ability of a meta‐analysis to produce confident results. A high ComPaSS‐GWAS score in a single cohort could also indicate that the lack of replication may be a result of the differences in cohorts rather than the individual cohort analysis result being a false positive. In this study, ComPaSS‐GWAS scores were obtained using a within‐split significance parameter of 10 −3  based on 100 random splits. Simulations have shown (Sabourin et al.,  2018 ) that a ComPaSS‐GWAS score of 0.6 is comparable to a traditional genome‐wide association significance level ( p  < 5 × 10 −8 ). ComPaSS‐GWAS score greater than 0.4 and less than 0.6 are considered to be suggestively significant findings. 2.8 LD structures Haploview 4.2 (Barrett, Fry, Maller, & Daly,  2005 ) was used to generate LD plots across the genome based on D’ and  r 
 2  values to evaluate LD structures among significant SNPs variants in Table  2  for each cohort.

John Wiley & Sons, Ltd 2.9 Functional annotation and quantitative‐trait loci analysis of SNPs Custom tracks on the UCSC Genome browser ( http://genome.ucsc.edu ) were used to screen NIH Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE experimental data containing the SNP regions of interest for evidence for regulatory relevance in normal skin cells (melanocytes, fibroblasts and keratinocytes). The online tools HaploReg ( http://www.broadinstitute.org/mammals/haploreg/haploreg.php ) and RegulomeDB ( http://regulome.stanford.edu ) were used as complementary analyses and to confirm the location of each SNP in relation to protein‐coding and/or non‐coding RNA genes. While many regulatory regions can act in a tissue‐specific manner, it is unknown whether variants in such regions also have tissue‐specific effects, and complex phenotypes are often caused by dysfunction of multiple tissues or cell type. This suggests the potential for the involvement of skin and other tissues/cells such as blood (immunity) and fibroblasts (regulatory role in pigmentation) in CALM phenotype. To evaluate if a SNP could influence gene expression  in‐cis  or act as an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in blood and skin tissues, all coding genes were identified that mapped within ±1 Mb of the index SNPs (associated SNPs of interest). eQTL results for all CALM‐associated SNPs and collated genes based on 749 normal skin tissues (414 sun‐exposed and 335 non‐sun‐exposed), 369 normal blood samples and 300 transformed fibroblast cell lines were then extracted from GTEx (V7, dbGaP Accession phs000424.v7.p2), (12 lead index SNPs and 1 surrogate variant in perfect LD). In addition, the influence of a SNP on metabolite levels in blood was evaluated by extraction of association results for each SNP and metabolites in blood from the Metabolomics GWAS ( http://metabolomics.helmholtz‐muenchen.de/gwas/ ).",Heejong Sung; Paula L Hyland; Alexander Pemov; Jeremy A Sabourin; Andrea M Baldwin; Sara Bass; Kedest Teshome; Wen Luo; Brigitte C Widemann; Douglas R Stewart; Alexander F Wilson,Molecular genetics & genomic medicine,2020-10,10.1002/mgg3.1400,minimal,True
PMID:19144871,Identification of erythrocyte p55/MPP1 as a binding partner of NF2 tumor suppressor protein/Merlin.,"Neurofibromatosis type 2 is an inherited disorder characterized by the development of benign and malignant tumors on the auditory nerves and central nervous system with symptoms including hearing loss, poor balance, skin lesions, and cataracts. Here, we report a novel protein-protein interaction between NF2 protein (merlin or schwannomin) and erythrocyte p55, also designated as MPP1. The p55 is a conserved scaffolding protein with postulated functions in cell shape, hair cell development, and neural patterning of the retina. The FERM domain of NF2 protein binds directly to p55, and surface plasmon resonance analysis indicates a specific interaction with a kD value of 3.7 nM. We developed a specific monoclonal antibody against human erythrocyte p55, and found that both p55 and NF2 proteins are colocalized in the non-myelin-forming Schwann cells. This finding suggests that the p55-NF2 protein interaction may play a functional role in the regulation of apico-basal polarity and tumor suppression pathways in non-erythroid cells.","Materials and Methods Antibodies The anti-p55 mouse monoclonal antibody was generated by immunizing BALB/c mice with the recombinant SH3-GUK segment of human erythrocyte p55 protein. The hybridoma clones were generated from splenocytes of immunized mice at Maine Biotechnology Services, Inc., Portland, Maine, and clones producing specific antibody were screened and isolated by ELISA and Western blotting. The clone 2G4 was selected to produce the ascites fluid, which was used for Western blot and immunohistochemistry applications. The anti-merlin polyclonal antibody was obtained from Dr. Guy Rouleau’s laboratory as described previously ( 8 ). Another anti-merlin polyclonal antibody (A-19) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Recombinant Proteins Human merlin cDNA fragments encoding the N-terminal half (aa 1–311) and the C-terminal half (aa 312–595) were generated by PCR using human fetal brain cDNA pool (CLONTECH) as the template. The N-terminal fragment of merlin encodes the FERM domain including its terminal cytoskeletal anchor sequence ( 14 ). The C-terminus half contains the sequence of merlin isoform 1, which contains the consensus PDZ binding sequence in the C-terminus ( 8 ,  12 ). The cDNA fragments were cloned in pMAL-c2X vector (New England Biolabs) for the expression of recombinant proteins as MBP fusions in the bacterial ( E. coli ) cytoplasm. The fusion proteins, MBP-merlin-N and MBP-merlin-C, were expressed in the DH5α bacteria and purified using the amylose resin (New England Biolabs). Recombinant His-p55 was also expressed in DH5α cells and purified as described previously ( 10 ). Protein-Protein Interaction Assay In vitro  binding between merlin and p55 was investigated by a pull-down assay using the MBP-proteins immobilized on the beads. The MBP-NF2-N and MBP-NF2-C as well as the control MBP were immobilized on the amylose resin beads, and incubated with recombinant His-p55 in the binding buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), for 2 h at 4°C on a rocker. The beads were washed extensively with the binding buffer, and p55 bound to the beads was detected by Western blotting using an anti-p55 monoclonal antibody (1:5000 dilution of the total ascites). Surface Plasmon Resonance Measurements Protein-protein interactions were quantified using the BIAcore 1000 system (Pharmacia Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden/GE Healthcare). Bacterially expressed His-p55 was immobilized on the CM5 sensor chip, and its binding affinity with MBP, MBP-NF2-N and MBP-NF2-C was quantified. The binding reaction was performed at 30 μl/min flow rate at 25°C for the kinetic measurements, whereas the ligand immobilization and regeneration processes were carried out at 5.0 μL/min flow rate. The composition of the running buffer was 10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3.4 mM EDTA, and 0.005% P20 (pH 7.4). The composition of the immobilization buffer for His-p55 was 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 3.5, and the regeneration buffer was 100 mM NaCl and 10 mM NaOH, pH 12. Immunoprecipitation Freshly obtained erythrocytes from normal human subjects were washed three times with wash buffer (5.0 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM EGTA) and the buffy coat was removed. Packed erythrocytes were lysed with 10 volumes of lysis buffer (5.0 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0; 0.1 mM EGTA; and 1.0 mM PMSF) and the lysate was centrifuged for 10 mins at 14,000 ×  g . The resultant pellet of membranes (ghosts) was incubated in the solubilization buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 1.0 mM EDTA; 0.5% Triton X-100; and protease inhibitors) containing 500 mM KCl at 4°C for 1.0 h. Sample was centrifuged and the supernatant was dialyzed against the solubilization buffer (without Triton X-100) to remove excess KCl. After reconstituting the sample with 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 μL of Protein G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) were added to pre-clear the lysate for 1.0 h at 4°C. Beads were removed and 4.0 μg of either p55 or CD3 monoclonal antibodies were added. Samples were incubated for 4.0 h at 4°C on a rocker. Protein G-Sepharose beads (20 μL) were then added for an additional 1.0 h. Beads were washed three times with the solubilization buffer and boiled in 20 uL of 2x Laemmli sample buffer for 5 mins. Bound proteins were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the NF2 at 1:200 dilution. Immunohistochemistry Immunofluorescence on cryosections was preformed as described previously ( 15 ), and examined with an MRC 1024 Laser Scanning Confocal (BioRad), UltraVIEW ERS Spinning Disk Confocal (PerkinElmer), and fluorescent (Olympus BX, Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan) microscopes. For immunohistochemistry, the sciatic nerves were removed and rapidly snap-frozen in the liquid nitrogen, either unfixed or previously fixed in buffered 4% paraformaldehyde. For teased fiber preparation, the sciatic nerves were removed and fixed on ice in freshly prepared buffered 4% paraformaldehyde, as described previously ( 16 ). The slides were washed in the phosphate buffered saline and incubated with the secondary antibodies, donkey anti-mouse TRITC and donkey anti-rabbit FITC (Jackson), and mounted with Vecta-shield (Vector Laboratories). The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-NF2 (Santa Cruz); mouse anti-p55 monoclonal (this study); mouse anti-S100 (SIGMA); mouse anti-GFAP (Chemicon) and rabbit anti-GFAP (SIGMA); rabbit anti-NF-H (Chemicon); and mouse anti-Caspr, kindly provided by Dr. Elior Peles, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.",Pil-Soo Seo; Brendan J Quinn; Anwar A Khan; Lixiao Zeng; Christos G Takoudis; Toshihiko Hanada; Annalisa Bolis; Alessandra Bolino; Athar H Chishti,"Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)",2009-03,10.3181/0809-RM-275,minimal,True
PMID:23071067,Genetically mediated Nf1 loss in mice promotes diverse radiation-induced tumors modeling second malignant neoplasms.,"Second malignant neoplasms (SMN) are therapy-induced malignancies and a growing problem in cancer survivors, particularly survivors of childhood cancers. The lack of experimental models of SMNs has limited understanding of their pathogenesis. It is currently not possible to predict or prevent this devastating late complication. Individuals with neurofibromatosis I (NF1) are at increased risk of developing therapy-induced cancers for unclear reasons. To model SMNs, we replicated clinical radiotherapy and delivered fractionated abdominal irradiation to Nf1(+/-) and wild-type mice. Similar to irradiated cancer survivors, irradiated wild-type and Nf1(+/-) mice developed diverse in-field malignancies. In Nf1(+/-) mice, fractionated irradiation promoted both classical NF1-associated malignancies and malignancies unassociated with the NF1 syndrome but typical of SMNs. Nf1 heterozygosity potentiated the mutagenic effects of irradiation, as evidenced by the significantly reduced survival after irradiation and tumor development that was often characterized by synchronous primary tumors. Interestingly, diverse radiation-induced tumors arising in wild-type and Nf1(+/-) mice shared a genetic signature characterized by monoallelic loss of Nf1 and the adjacent Trp53 allele. These findings implicate Nf1 loss as mediating tumorigenesis in a broad range of cell types and organs extending beyond the classical NF1 tumor histologies. Examining clinical SMN samples, we found LOH of NF1 in SMNs from non-NF1 patients. Nf1 heterozygosity confers broad susceptibility to genotoxin-induced tumorigenesis, and this paradigm serves as an experimental platform for future studies of SMNs.","Materials and Methods Mouse Strains, Breeding and Treatment Nf1 +/−  and wildtype mice were generated as previously described ( 18 ). In brief,  Nf1 +/−  mice maintained in the 129/Sv background ( 19 ) were crossed with wild-type C57Bl/6 mice. Mice were placed in a cesium-137 source (J.L. Shepherd & Associates, San Fernando, CA) animal irradiator and shielded with an iron collimator that focused the beam width. Five to eight week old mice were given abdominal irradiation at a fractionation of either one fraction of 3 Gy, five fractions of 3 Gy or ten fractions of 3 Gy, delivered at a rate of five fractions per week, one fraction per day. The UCSF IACUC approved all animal procedures. Pathologic Analysis Animals were followed for a minimum of 18 months post-irradiation. Animals with signs of systemic illness were euthanized and visible masses/growths, peripheral blood, and bone marrow were collected immediately. The mice were then perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde and the following organs were collected: brain, skin in irradiated region, skin outside irradiated region, skull, heart, lungs, spleen, liver, kidneys, segment of small intestine. Pathologic review was performed on hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections by A.H. and S.K. Photographs of histology were taken with an Olympus BX41 microscope, using Olympus UplanFl 10X/0.3 and 20X/0.5 objectives. An attached Olympus DP72 camera and Adobe Photoshop CS2 were used to capture the images. Complete blood counts were performed on blood samples obtained at the time of sacrifice by cardiac puncture and analyzed immediately on a Hemavet provided by the UCSF Mouse Pathology Core. Mouse tumor Genotyping and Mutation Analysis Trp53  loss of heterozygosity was analyzed at the D11Mit29 and D11Mit31 loci by amplifying tumor DNA with the following primers: forward 5′ TTGAGGCATGAGGGGATTAG 3′, reverse 5′ TTTCCGTCATTGCTAAAGGG 3′, 5′ TTTCCCAGTCACGACGTTGGCCTGAATTCACATGGTGG 3′, reverse 5′ AGAATAAGTAAACCCAGCTGCG 3′. D11Mit219 was amplified with the following primers: forward 5′ TTTCCCAGTCACGACGTTGTTGTATGTATAGATGCATTTGAATGG -3′, reverse 5′ GGTTTGTATAAATTCTCACCTGTGC 3′. The UCSF Genome Core using Peak Scanner software from Applied Biosystems performed PCR fragment analyses. The SNP rs13481119 was sequenced using the following primers: forward 5′ GCCCGCTACATGCTGATGCTG 3′ reverse 5′ GCTTGTAGGCCTGGTGAGTC 3′. SNP products were sequenced using a commercial sequencing service. Clinical FFPE Tissue DNA Isolation and Amplification Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections of 8 radiation induced breast cancers were obtained from City of Hope Medical Center (Duarte, California, USA). H & E slides of FFPE sections were reviewed by a pathologist (AH), who delineated tumor and normal areas for dissection. Tumor and normal tissues were then dissected off of unstained slides and genomic DNA was isolated and subjected to whole genome amplification according to manufacturers instructions using the REPLI-g FFPE kit (Qiagen). DNA was purified using sodium acetate, and quantified using Picogreen (Qiagen). Taqman SNP Genotyping Analysis of clinical samples was performed with approval from the UCSF Committee on Human Research. Clinical DNA samples were genotyped at four selected SNPs in the human NF1 gene (NCBI ref SNPs rs2952994, rs2953014, rs9902893, and rs2107359 using C1547650_10, C2557613_10, C2533273_10 and C16032374_10, all from Applied Biosytems, respectively). Primers flanking selected SNPs were designed using Integrated DNA Technologies primer design program. Assay C2557613_10 was used to genotype using the Taq amplification method in a 7900 HT Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, USA). Five μl PCR reactions were performed using 2.42 μl DNA in H 2 0 (4 ng total) or H 2 0 for negative controls, 0.08 μl probe (20 μmol) and 2.5 μl Master Mix (20 μmol; Applied Biosystems). Reactions underwent heat activation at 95 °C for 10 minutes, then cycled 40 times with a denaturation step of 92 °C for 15 seconds, and an annealing and elongation step of 60 °C for 90 seconds. All samples were run in replicates of 6. Allelic discrimination plots generated by SDS3.0, an Applied Biosystems program used to make genotyping calls. Trp53 sequencing Whole exomic sequencing was performed to assess for the presence of mutations in the  Trp53  gene. Two kb fragments of the  Trp53  gene spanning exons 2–4, 5–7, and 8–10 were PCR-amplified from all primary tumor and select matching tail DNA samples. Similarly, 1 kb fragments were PCR amplified from exons 1 and 11. PCR amplification was performed with Qiagen Taq DNA polymerase. PCR cleanup was done with ExoSAP-IT (Affymetrix). The PCR fragments were then sequenced (Quintara Biosciences) with sequencing primers (listed in  Supplementary Table 2 ). The Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer Database (COSMIC,  www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic , Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, United Kingdom) was used to search for references to human tumors also possessing the identified mutations. Statistical Analysis Survival curves are calculated from Kaplan-Meier product limit estimators to determine the association of CI on mortality.

PMID:24832557,Trp53 haploinsufficiency modifies EGFR-driven peripheral nerve sheath tumorigenesis.,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are genetically diverse, aggressive sarcomas that occur sporadically or in association with neurofibromatosis type 1 syndrome. Reduced TP53 gene expression and amplification/overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene occur in MPNST formation. We focused on determining the cooperativity between reduced TP53 expression and EGFR overexpression for Schwann cell transformation in vitro (immortalized human Schwann cells) and MPNST formation in vivo (transgenic mice). Human gene copy number alteration data, microarray expression data, and TMA analysis indicate that TP53 haploinsufficiency and increased EGFR expression co-occur in human MPNST samples. Concurrent modulation of EGFR and TP53 expression in HSC1λ cells significantly increased proliferation and anchorage-independent growth in vitro. Transgenic mice heterozygous for a Trp53-null allele and overexpressing EGFR in Schwann cells had a significant increase in neurofibroma and grade 3 PNST (MPNST) formation compared with single transgenic controls. Histological analysis of tumors identified a significant increase in pAkt expression in grade 3 PNSTs compared with neurofibromas. Array comparative genome hybridization analysis of grade 3 PNSTs identified recurrent focal regions of chromosomal gains with significant enrichment in genes involved in extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 signaling. Collectively, altered p53 expression cooperates with overexpression of EGFR in Schwann cells to enhance in vitro oncogenic properties and tumorigenesis and progression in vivo.",,Eric P Rahrmann; Branden S Moriarity; George M Otto; Adrienne L Watson; Kwangmin Choi; Margaret H Collins; Margaret Wallace; Beau R Webber; Colleen L Forster; Anthony E Rizzardi; Stephen C Schmechel; Nancy Ratner; David A Largaespada,The American journal of pathology,2014-07,10.1016/j.ajpath.2014.04.006,abstract_only,False
PMID:2491782,"Linkage analysis of neurofibromatosis type I, using chromosome 17 DNA markers.","The gene for von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) has recently been mapped to the pericentromeric region of human chromosome 17. To further localize the NF1 gene, linkage analysis using chromosome 17 DNA markers was performed on 11 multigeneration families with 175 individuals, 57 of whom were affected. The markers used were D17Z1 (p17H8), D17S58 (EW301), D17S54 (EW203), D17S57 (EW206), D17S73 (EW207), CRI-L946, HOX-2, and growth hormone. Tight linkage was found between NF1 and D17Z1, D17S58, and D17S57 with a recombination fraction of zero. One recombinant was detected between NF1 and D17S73, showing linkage with a 10% recombination fraction. No linkage was detected between NF1 and CRI-L946 or between HOX-2 and growth hormone.

PMID:28392281,Human stem cell modeling in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).,"The future of precision medicine is heavily reliant on the use of human tissues to identify the key determinants that account for differences between individuals with the same disorder. This need is exemplified by the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) neurogenetic condition. As such, individuals with NF1 are born with a germline mutation in the NF1 gene, but may develop numerous distinct neurological problems, ranging from autism and attention deficit to brain and peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Coupled with accurate preclinical mouse models, the availability of NF1 patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provides new opportunities to define the critical factors that underlie NF1-associated nervous system disease pathogenesis and progression. In this review, we discuss the generation and potential applications of iPSC technology to the study of NF1.","2.1 Indirect reprogramming methods The first vectors used to generate iPSCs were gamma retroviruses, specifically murine leukemia retroviruses, chosen for their favorable long-term transgene expression ( Fig. 3A ) [ 18 ,  19 ]. Retroviral vectors consist of an RNA genome which is converted to DNA by virally-encoded reverse transcriptase once inside the target cell. The viral DNA is then integrated into the recipient genome during cell division, providing a persistent template for viral replication and gene expression. Replication-defective retroviruses engineered with insertion of transgenes in the place of viral protein-coding genes allow for delivery and integration of genes encoding reprogramming transcription factors. However, retroviruses are limited by their inability to transduce non-dividing and slow-growing cells, as well as the potential increased cancer risk associated with the integration of viral vectors near proto-oncogenes [ 33 ]. Lentiviral vectors, a retroviral subclass, can transduce both non-dividing and rapidly-dividing cells with efficiencies comparable to other retroviruses, thus expanding potentially reprogrammable biomaterials to include cells with low division rates, like neurons and macrophages [ 34 ]. iPSC conversion with virally-delivered transgenes is a highly efficient reprogramming method [ 35 ], but transgene systems have inherent drawbacks: Insertional mutagenesis and transgene reactivation in iPSC-derived differentiated cells confers the capacity for malignant transformation, making iPSCs generated with these reprogramming technologies potentially unsafe for transplant therapies. Transplanted pluripotent stem cell-derived neural precursors can induce tumor formation in animal models, despite the removal of pluripotent cells prior to transplantation [ 36 ,  37 ]. To circumvent these risks, excisable lentiviral vectors have been developed using  Cre/loxP  technology [ 38 ], while transposon-derived vectors have emerged as another approach [ 39 ]. However, even excisable transgene technologies still pose a risk for non-specific recombination events and genomic instability during gene excision. The clinical application of iPSCs to cell transplantation therapies necessitates the reduction of oncogenic potential and genetic instability associated with genome-integrating reprogramming methods. Adenoviral vectors are considered a non-integrative option for reprogramming factor delivery, with the caveat that they require extremely high viral titers for genomic integration [ 40 ]. Despite this limitation, adenoviral vectors have been used to successfully reprogram human fibroblasts [ 41 ]. Sendai viral vectors are another non-integrative reprogramming alternative [ 42 – 44 ]. Since these are RNA viruses with exclusively cytoplasmic replication, they do not integrate into the target cell genome. The derivation of iPSCs free of transgene sequences has also been achieved using episomal vectors to deliver reprogramming factors. In this regard, human fibroblasts have been successfully reprogrammed after a single transfection with oriP/EBNA1 (Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen-1)-based episomal vectors expressing  OCT4, SOX2, MYC, KLF4, NANOG, LIN28  and Simian Virus 40 Large T ( SV40LT ) [ 45 ]. Alternative approaches have been reported, involving the repeated application of cell-penetrating peptide-anchored reprogramming proteins [ 46 ] and small molecule cocktails to replace Yamanaka reprogramming factors [ 47 ,  48 ]. These transgene-free methods are promising, but remain challenging due to low reprogramming efficiencies. Repeated administration of modified synthetic messenger RNA cocktails encoding Yamanaka factors plus  LIN28  has also been employed to reprogram differentiated human cells to pluripotency without genomic integration. Conversion efficiencies were substantially superior using modified RNAs as compared to reprogramming with established retroviral protocols [ 49 ]. Future research would benefit from the optimization and standardization of reprogramming technologies capable of reproducibly and efficiently preserving iPSC genomic integrity. 2.2 Direct reprogramming methods The discovery of iPSCs confirmed that somatic cells are not restricted to a particular differentiated state, thus inspiring the use of transdifferentiation methods as a complementary approach to the aforementioned dedifferentiation technique. The first direct lineage conversion of post-mitotic neurons from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and tail-tip fibroblasts (TTFs) was performed by Thomas Vierbuchen and colleagues [ 50 ]. Functional excitatory neurons were efficiently induced from MEFs and TTFs via lentiviral transduction of three transcription factors Achaete-scute family bHLH transcription factor 1 ( Ascl1 ), POU class 3 homeobox 2 ( Brn2 ), and myelin transcription factor 1 ( Myt1l ) identified from a pool of candidate genes with documented roles in neural development. The resulting induced neuronal cells expressed neuron-specific proteins and formed functional synapses, thus demonstrating that somatic lineage conversion can bypass a pluripotent intermediate and occur between lineages from different germ layers [ 50 ]. To confirm that the induced neuronal population was not derived from rare neural crest cell derivatives that potentially contaminate fibroblast cultures, the conversion of differentiated mouse hepatocytes into functional neurons was achieved using the same three factors [ 51 ]. Using lentiviral transduction of these same factors plus  NEUROD1 , functional neurons have also been induced from human fibroblasts [ 52 ]. Small noncoding RNA molecules, called microRNAs, have similarly been utilized to promote transdifferentiation of functional excitatory neurons from terminally-differentiated somatic cells ( Fig. 3B ). Since induction of the neural-progenitor-specific BAF (nBAF) chromatin-remodeling complex represents an essential switch in neuronal differentiation and function, microRNAs miR-9* and miR-124 have been used to repress BAF function and facilitate neuronal induction [ 53 ]. As such, human fibroblasts have been successfully converted to neurons by miR-9* and miR-124 lentiviral transduction, which is accelerated by the addition of the  NEUROD2 ,  ASCL1  and  MYT1L  transcription factors [ 54 ]. Human fibroblasts have also been reprogrammed into functional neurons using the combination of miR-124 and the  MYT1L  and  BRN2  transcription factors [ 55 ]. In addition, small molecule strategies with no risk of transgene integration have also been used to directly reprogram human fibroblasts into neurons [ 56 – 58 ]. To date, various populations of neurons, including inhibitory, spinal motor, dopaminergic, and excitatory neurons, have been generated by direct conversion [ 59 ]. The direct reprogramming method is a promising alternative to methods involving an iPSC intermediate, and researchers have many advantages and limitations of each to consider before choosing an approach. In bypassing a pluripotent intermediate, the direct reprogramming method has the capacity to generate cell populations with a safer profile for transplantation therapies. However, without a pluripotent intermediate, the direct platform is limited in expandability, as direct conversion produces post-mitotic cells which cannot be expanded in culture like iPSCs. Direct reprogramming also preserves putative cellular aging markers, which could be advantageous in the study of late-onset diseases where age is a significant risk factor [ 60 ]. In this regard, neurons generated by direct conversion of fibroblasts from older adult mice demonstrate comparable levels of oxidative stress and DNA damage as the starting fibroblasts, and exhibit higher expression of age-related genes [ 61 ].",Michelle L Wegscheid; Corina Anastasaki; David H Gutmann,Experimental neurology,2018-01,10.1016/j.expneurol.2017.04.001,minimal,True
PMID:1915269,The GTPase stimulatory activities of the neurofibromatosis type 1 and the yeast IRA2 proteins are inhibited by arachidonic acid.,"Three proteins, GTPase activating protein (GAP), neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) and the yeast inhibitory regulator of the RAS-cAMP pathway (IRA2), have the ability to stimulate the GTPase activity of Ras proteins from higher animals or yeast. Previous studies indicate that certain lipids are able to inhibit this activity associated with the mammalian GAP protein. Inhibition of GAP would be expected to biologically activate Ras protein. In these studies arachidonic acid is shown also to inhibit the activity of the catalytic fragments of the other two proteins, mammalian NF1 and the yeast IRA2 proteins. In addition, phosphatidic acid (containing arachidonic and stearic acid) was inhibitory for the catalytic fragment of NF1 protein, but did not inhibit the catalytic fragments of GAP or IRA2 proteins. These observations emphasize the biochemical similarity of these proteins and provide support for the suggestion that lipids might play an important role in their biological control, and therefore also in the control of Ras activity and cellular proliferation.",,M Golubić; K Tanaka; S Dobrowolski; D Wood; M H Tsai; M Marshall; F Tamanoi; D W Stacey,The EMBO journal,1991-10,10.1002/j.1460-2075.1991.tb07839.x,abstract_only,False
PMID:19414599,Ral overactivation in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.,"Ras leads an important signaling pathway that is deregulated in neurofibromatosis type 1 and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). In this study, we show that overactivation of Ras and many of its downstream effectors occurred in only a fraction of MPNST cell lines. RalA, however, was overactivated in all MPNST cells and tumor samples compared to nontransformed Schwann cells. Silencing Ral or inhibiting it with a dominant-negative Ral (Ral S28N) caused a significant reduction in proliferation, invasiveness, and in vivo tumorigenicity of MPNST cells. Silencing Ral also reduced the expression of epithelial mesenchymal transition markers. Expression of the NF1-GTPase-related domain (NF1-GRD) diminished the levels of Ral activation, implicating a role for neurofibromin in regulating RalA activation. NF1-GRD treatment caused a significant decrease in proliferation, invasiveness, and cell cycle progression, but cell death increased. We propose Ral overactivation as a novel cell signaling abnormality in MPNST that leads to important biological outcomes with translational ramifications.",,Vidya Bodempudi; Farnaz Yamoutpoor; Weihong Pan; Arkadiusz Z Dudek; Tuba Esfandyari; Mark Piedra; Dusica Babovick-Vuksanovic; Richard A Woo; Victor F Mautner; Lan Kluwe; D Wade Clapp; George H De Vries; Stacey L Thomas; Andreas Kurtz; Luis F Parada; Faris Farassati,Molecular and cellular biology,2009-07,10.1128/MCB.01153-08,abstract_only,False
PMID:30179114,Abnormal Morphology of Select Cortical and Subcortical Regions in Neurofibromatosis Type 1.,"Purpose To evaluate whether patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-a multisystem neurodevelopmental disorder with myriad imaging manifestations, including focal transient myelin vacuolization within the deep gray nuclei, brainstem, and cerebellum-exhibit differences in cortical and subcortical structures, particularly in subcortical regions where these abnormalities manifest. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, by using clinically obtained three-dimensional T1-weighted MR images and established image analysis methods, 10 intracranial volume-corrected subcortical and 34 cortical regions of interest (ROIs) were quantitatively assessed in 32 patients with NF1 and 245 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. By using linear models, ROI cortical thicknesses and volumes were compared between patients with NF1 and control subjects, as a function of age. With hierarchic cluster analysis and partial correlations, differences in the pattern of association between cortical and subcortical ROI volumes in patients with NF1 and control subjects were also evaluated. Results Patients with NF1 exhibited larger subcortical volumes and thicker cortices of select regions, particularly the hippocampi, amygdalae, cerebellar white matter, ventral diencephalon, thalami, and occipital cortices. For the thalami and pallida and 22 cortical ROIs in patients with NF1, a significant inverse association between volume and age was found, suggesting that volumes decrease with increasing age. Moreover, compared with those in control subjects, ROIs in patients with NF1 exhibited a distinct pattern of clustering and partial correlations. Discussion Neurofibromatosis type 1 is characterized by larger subcortical volumes and thicker cortices of select structures. Most apparent within the hippocampi, amygdalae, cerebellar white matter, ventral diencephalon, thalami and occipital cortices, these neurofibromatosis type 1-associated volumetric changes may, in part, be age dependent. © RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",,Matthew J Barkovich; Chin Hong Tan; Ryan M Nillo; Yi Li; Duan Xu; Christine M Glastonbury; Orit A Glenn; William P Dillon; Christopher P Hess; Sabine Mueller; Cassie Kline; Anders M Dale; Terry L Jernigan; Leo P Sugrue; A James Barkovich; Rahul S Desikan,Radiology,2018-11,10.1148/radiol.2018172863,abstract_only,False
PMID:16835260,Nf1+/- mast cells induce neurofibroma like phenotypes through secreted TGF-beta signaling.,"Neurofibromas are common tumors found in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients. These complex tumors are composed of Schwann cells, mast cells, fibroblasts and perineurial cells embedded in collagen that provide a lattice for tumor invasion. Genetic studies demonstrate that in neurofibromas, nullizygous loss of Nf1 in Schwann cells and haploinsufficiency of Nf1 in non-neuronal cells are required for tumorigenesis. Fibroblasts are a major cellular constituent in neurofibromas and are a source of collagen that constitutes approximately 50% of the dry weight of the tumor. Here, we show that two of the prevalent heterozygous cells found in neurofibromas, mast cells and fibroblasts interact directly to contribute to tumor phenotype. Nf1+/- mast cells secrete elevated concentrations of the profibrotic transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). In response to TGF-beta, both murine Nf1+/- fibroblasts and fibroblasts from human neurofibromas proliferate and synthesize excessive collagen, a hallmark of neurofibromas. We also establish that the TGF-beta response occurs via hyperactivation of a novel Ras-c-abl signaling pathway. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of c-abl reverses fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis to wild-type levels. These studies identify a novel molecular target to inhibit neurofibroma formation.","MATERIAL AND METHODS Animals Nf1 +/− mice were obtained from Dr Tyler Jacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Cambridge, MA, USA) in a C57BL/6J.129 background and backcrossed for 13 generations into a C57BL/6J strain ( 40 ). These studies were conducted with the approval of the Indiana University Laboratory Animal Research Center. Generation of primary cells and preparation of MCCM Murine fibroblasts were prepared from 13.5 dpc (days postcoitus) embryos as described previously ( 25 ). All the fibroblasts used in the experiments were passages 2–3. NF1 patient fibroblasts and fibroblasts from unaffected adult controls were generated from cutaneous neurofibromas or healthy donor skin. Briefly, dermal samples were isolated, digested with trypsin to obtain a single cell suspension and placed in Dulbecco’s minimum essential medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 1% glutamine, 2% penicillin/streptomycin and cultured in a 37°C, 5% CO 2  humidified incubator. Bone marrow derived mast cells (BMMCs) were generated from 6-week-old mice as described previously ( 41 ). The homogeneity of BMMC was determined by Alcian blue–Safranin O staining ( 42 ). Furthermore, fluorescence-activated cytometric analysis (FACS) (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA) revealed similar forward and side light scatter characteristics and the same percentage of c-kit +  expression in BMMCs for all murine experimental genotypes (data not shown). MCCM was collected from each mast cell line following 24 h starvation with RPMI1640 containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) at 37°C, 5% CO 2  with modification ( 26 ). Briefly, the cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 120 g  and supernatants were collected and stored in aliquots at −80°C. Supernatants were then used for analysis of bioactivity in fibroblasts and for evaluation of cytokine concentrations by proteomics array and ELISA. Measurement of cytokine secretion from mast cells Cytokine secretion from BMMCs was measured by semiquantitative protein array (RayBiotech Inc., Norcross, GA, USA) as described previously ( 26 ). The results were confirmed quantitatively by ELISA following manufacturer’s instruction (R&D Systems, MN, USA). Flow cytometric analysis for collagen type I expression Surface collagen type I antigen expression was evaluated by fluoresence cytometry. Fibroblasts were stained for 30 min at 4°C with 1 µg/ml of FITC-conjugated anti-ColIA monoclonal antibody (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) or an isotype control and were analyzed by FACS for CollA expression. Fibroblast proliferation [ 3 H]Thymidine incorporation assay was performed to examine the fibroblast proliferation with modification ( 43 ). Briefly, fibroblasts were plated at a concentration of 4 × 10 3  cells in 96-well dishes in 200 µl of DMEM containing 1% glutamine, 10% FCS, in a 37°C, 5% CO 2  humidified incubator. Culture media were then switched to serum-free DMEM or MCCM. The cells were then cultured for 24–72 h, and tritiated thymidine (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Boston, MA, USA) was added to cultures 6 h prior to harvest on glass fiber filters (Packard Instrument Co.) and β-emission was measured. Wound healing assay Confluent fibroblast monolayers were wounded by manually scraping the cells with a pipette tip as described previously ( 32 ). The wound size was measured to ensure that all wounds were of the same width. To ensure that the width change was not caused by fibroblast proliferation, 10 µg/ml of mitomycin C was added into the fibroblast culture for 2 h before wounding to block the cell mitosis. The cell culture media were then replaced with fresh media, and wound closure was monitored by time lapse microscopy. Three-dimensional collagen lattice formation Three-dimensional lattice cultures were performed in collagen matrices as described ( 43 ). Briefly, type I collagen from rat tail tendon (2 mg/ml in 18 m m  acetic acid) was added to 35 mm dishes containing DMEM medium with 1% FCS and 0.1  m  NaOH. Fibroblasts (10 5 ) were added just after collagen solution, alone or with 10 5  mast cells, before fibrillation and lattice formation. Lattice diameter was measured daily. Collagen synthesis assay Collagen production by fibroblasts incubated with mast cells (1 × 10 5 /well) or TGF-β (1 ng/ml) in 24-well tissue culture plates was assessed by [ 3 H]proline incorporation into collagenous proteins as previously described ( 43 ). Data are expressed as c.p.m. of [ 3 H]proline incorporation in 10 4  fibroblasts. Use of neutralizing antibodies to TGF-β TGF-β neutralizing antibodies were obtained from R&D Systems, Inc. (Cat. no. AF-101-NA) and utilized as suggested by the manufacturer. The ND 50  for this lot of anti-TGF-β1 antibody was previously established by the manufacturer and confirmed in pilot experiments. Generation of recombinant retroviral plasmids The recombinant retroviral constructs have been previously described ( 25 ). Briefly, the GAP-related domain (GRD) sequences which modulate Ras activity are under the transcriptional control of the myeloproliferative sarcoma retrovirus promoter. Constructs also contain a puromycin resistance gene, Pac. Three viruses were used in these experiments: a virus expressing the full-length  NF1  GTPase-activating related domain ( NF1  GRD) and pac (MSCV- NF1  GRD-pac), a virus expressing a GAP-inactive mutant of the  NF1  GRD that harbors a known human mutation in the arginine finger loop (R1276P) ( 25 ) and pac (MSCV-1276P  NF1  GRD-pac) and a virus expressing the selectable marker gene alone (MSCV-pac). Retroviral transduction of fibroblasts The transduction protocol has been previously described and was used here with minor modifications ( 25 ). Briefly, fibroblasts were transduced with supernatants of GP+E86 or GP+AM12 packaging cells in the presence of polybrene (5 µg/ml) for 48 h. Transduced cells were then cultured in 1 µg/ml of puromycin to select the tranduced cells. c-abl kinase assays Fibroblasts were serum starved for 48 h, then stimulated with TGF-β for the indicated time and subsequently lysed for 30 min at 4°C in 750 µl of kinase lysis buffer [50 m m  Tris (pH 7.4), 150 m m  NaCl, 1% Triton X, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1 TIU/ml aprotinin, 50 µg/ml PMSF, 1 m m  sodium vanadate, 1 mg/ml leupeptin]. Extracts were clarified, and equivalent protein (500 µg) was incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-Abl (K12; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA) or anti-Flag (Sigma-Aldrich). Immune complexes were collected with protein A–Sepharose (Sigma-Aldrich) and twice in kinase buffer [25 m m  Tris (pH 7.4), 10 m m  MgCl2, 1 m m  DTT] prior to incubation in 40 µl kinase buffer containing 5 µ m  ATP, 2 µg GST-Crk and 0.5 µCi/Rxn [ 32 P]ATP. The kinase reaction was allowed to proceed for 5 min at 37°C, stopped with 40 µl (2× concentration) Laemmli buffer and visualized by autoradiography after SDS–PAGE. Total c-abl protein was detected using an antibody from BD Biosciences (Cat. no. 554148, San Jose, CA, USA). Transfection with siRNA c-abl siRNA oligonucleotides (Cat. no. sc-29844) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Scrambled oligonucleotides (Cat. no. sc-36869) or vehicle only was used as controls. Fibroblasts were cultured in a six-well tissue culture dish to 40–50% confluency. The siRNA oligonucleotides were diluted with siRNA transfection reagents and siRNA transfection medium, and transfections were conducted as per manufacturer’s recommendations (Santa Cruz). After the transfection, the cell mixture was replaced with culture medium. Cells were incubated for 48 h at 37°C before harvesting for experiments. Detection of p21 ras -GTP levels Fibroblasts were deprived of serum for 24 h and stimulated with 1 ng/ml of TGF-β for 5 min. p21 ras  activation was subsequently determined using a p21 ras  activation pulldown assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY, USA) according to manufacturer’s protocol and as described previously ( 25 , 44 ). Matrigel plug assay To measure fibroblast migration and growth  in vivo , a matrigel plug assay was performed with modification as described previously ( 45 ). Briefly, matrigel was thawed at 4°C for 24 h and mixed with 10 ng/ml TGF-β (Gibco) or vehicle. The matrigel mixture was then injected subcutaneously into the groin of WT or  Nf1 +/− mice. Recipients received a daily dose of 200 mg/kg/day of imatinib mesylate or the vehicle control for 1 week. The plug was then removed on day 7 and was frozen immediately. All tissues were sectioned (5 µm thickness), mounted onto slides and stained with PE-conjugated anti-ColIA antibody and counterstained with DAPI to identify the nuclei using standard techniques. Cells were imaged using a QImaging camera and QCapture-Pro software (Fryer Company Inc., Cincinnati, OH, USA). The number of fibroblasts was determined by scoring cells in three high power fields from 10 random sections within the plug. Five independent plugs per experimental group were examined.",Feng-Chun Yang; Shi Chen; Travis Clegg; Xiaohong Li; Trent Morgan; Selina A Estwick; Jin Yuan; Waleed Khalaf; Sarah Burgin; Jeff Travers; Luis F Parada; David A Ingram; D Wade Clapp,Human molecular genetics,2006-08-15,10.1093/hmg/ddl165,minimal,True

PMID:36241865,Transplanting neurofibromatosis-1 gene knockout neural stem cells improve functional recovery in rats with spinal cord injury by enhancing the mTORC2 pathway.,"The poor survival and low efficiency of neuronal differentiation limits the therapeutic effects of transplanted neural stem cells in the treatment of spinal cord injury. Neurofibromatosis-1 (NF-1) is a tumor suppressor gene that restricts the rapid and abnormal growth and differentiation of neural cells. In the present study, lentiviral vectors were used to knock out NF-1, Ricotr (the core member of mTORC2) or NF-1+Ricotr in neural stem cells in vitro, and the NF-1, Ricotr or NF-1+Ricotr knockout neural stem cells were transplanted at the lesion site in a rat model of spinal cord injury (SCI). We first demonstrated that targeted knockout of NF-1 had an antiapoptotic effect and improved neuronal differentiation by enhancing the mTORC2/Rictor pathway of neural stem cells in vitro. Subsequently, transplanting NF-1 knockout neural stem cells into the injured site sufficiently promoted the tissue repair and functional recovery of rats with spinal cord injury by enhancing the survival and neuronal differentiation of grafted neural stem cells. Collectively, these findings reveal a prominent role of NF-1 in neural stem cell biology, which is an invaluable step forward in enhancing the benefit of neural stem cell-mediated regenerative cell therapy for spinal cord injury and identifies the transplantation of NF-1 knockout neural stem cells as a promising strategy for spinal cord injury.","Materials and methods Ethical approval All procedures performed on experimental animals were approved by The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University Ethics Committee (2019SYSUSHDW-013) and implemented according to the guidelines established by the Ministry of Health of China.

In brief, the brain tissues of rat embryos were mechanically dissected and dissociated in Hanks’ balanced salt solution and then filtered twice with filters with a 40 μm aperture. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellet was resuspended to a single cell suspension. NSCs were seeded on T25 culture flasks with expansion medium containing Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 nutrient mixture, 2% B-27 supplement, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% L-glutamine, 20 ng/mL fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and 20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF). NSCs were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO 19 2  and passaged via digestion with Accutase when the neurosphere diameter was close to 100 μm. All NSCs used in this study were in passages 2–3. NSC transfection and induced neuronal differentiation For cell transfection, the neurospheres were dissociated into a single cell suspension and plated on coverslips coated with 0.01% poly-L-lysine at a density of 5 × 10 4  cells/well in 12-well plates or a density of 1 × 10 6  cells/well in 6-well plates. Cells were maintained in the expansion medium for 24 h to recover from the passage. After recovery, the cells were transfected with the control lentivirus (LV-vector), NF-1 sgRNA-CAS9 lentivirus (LV-NF-1), Rictor sgRNA-CAS9 lentivirus (LV-Rictor), and NF-1 sgRNA-CAS9 lentivirus + Rictor sgRNA-CAS9 lentivirus (LV-NF-1+LV-Rictor), with a multiplicity of infection of 10. Cells were seeded and cultured as usual in the control group. Twenty-four hours later, the expansion medium was changed to differentiation medium containing Neurobasal Medium, 2% B-27 supplement, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% L-glutamine. GFP expression was visualized by fluorescence microscopy (DM6B, Leica, Germany) after 48 h of transfection. The cell viability and transfection efficiency were evaluated by counting the number of GFP-positive cells from five random fields among all cells. Cells were harvested for immunofluorescent staining and Western blot analysis 14 days after inducing differentiation. Induced apoptosis of NSCs with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) To analyze the antiapoptotic ability of  NF-1 , we conducted apoptosis induction according to our previous study . Briefly, 24 h after transfection, the primary medium was changed, and the cells were cultured in expansion medium for another 48 h. Then, the primary medium was removed, and fresh expansion medium containing 50 ng/ml TNF-α was added to the NSCs and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO 20 2 . Twenty-four hours later, the cells were collected for further assessments by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assays and Western blot analysis. The materials and reagents used for the cell experiments are listed in Table  1 . Table 1 The reagents and materials used in cell experiments.

After 72 h of lentiviral transfection, NSCs were collected for transplantation. Briefly, after a week of adaptive feeding, buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg) was subcutaneously administered to each rat 30 min before surgery. Deep anesthesia was induced with a 5% mixture of isoflurane in the air followed by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (75 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). Then, the spinal cord was exposed at the 10th thoracic vertebral level (T10) via laminectomy. The animals in the sham group underwent spinal cord exposure but no injury. The rats in the control group received complete spinal cord transection but no NSC transplantation. In the other four groups, the exposed spinal cord was cut off using a microscissor for complete transection. Once the bleeding was stopped, the rats were implanted with 5 μL of LV-vector-, LV-NF-1-, LV-Rictor-, and LV-NF-1+LV-Rictor-transfected NSCs rostral and caudal to the injured site at a depth of 1 mm using a 5 μL Hamilton syringe with a 32G needle at an injection rate of 1 μL/min. The needle was left in the injected site for 3 min to allow cell diffusion and prevent leakage or backflow. The number of transplanted NSCs for each rat was 1 × 10 6 . The muscle and the skin were sutured using 5–0 sutures in layers. All procedures were completed by the same group of researchers who were experienced in rat SCI modeling. After surgery, 1 mL of saline containing 1 × 10 19 5  units of penicillin and 1 mg/kg meloxicam was intraperitoneally injected daily for 1 week to protect against infection and dehydration and to alleviate pain. The bladder of the rats was manually expressed twice daily until urinary function was restored. Rats were kept in the specific pathogen-free laboratory with a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle and conventional feeding until eight weeks after surgery. Functional evaluation The 22-point (0–21) Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) open-field locomotor test was used to assess hindlimb locomotor function, including joint movements, stepping ability, coordination, and trunk stability . The duration of each session was 5 min per rat. Finally, an overall score was calculated. The evaluation was independently performed by the same two observers who were blinded to the treatment of the tested animals and repeated three times. 21 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) MRI was performed using a 3.0 Tesla Siemens Verio MR scanner equipped with high-performance gradient coils eight weeks postinjury. A special eight-channel wrist coil was used to image the rats. Five animals were observed for each group. For scanning, the rats were subjected to general anesthesia, and each rat was subsequently placed in the ventral recumbent position using a surface coil for spinal cord measurements. T1- and T2-weighted MRIs of the spinal region were reconstructed in the sagittal plane to visualize the extent of the lesion. The cavity volume of the injured spinal cord was evaluated by contrasting the normal T8–10 spinal cord diameter in the midsagittal slides . 19 , 22 Spinal cord–evoked potential (SCEP) recording Rats were anesthetized and stereotaxically fixed. The T5–T6 and T12–L1 vertebrae were completely exposed. Briefly, the stimulation electrode was inserted into the T5–T6 interspinous ligaments, and a pair of needle electrodes were inserted into the interspinous ligaments of T12–L1 for SCEP recording. Then, the electrodes were connected to a BL-410E Data Acquisition Analysis System for Life Science (Chengdu, China). The variables of the SCEP signals were set according to previous reports as follows: gain of 2000 time constant of 0.01 s and filtering at 300 Hz. For an SCEP, a single pulse stimulation (50 ms in duration at a frequency of 5.1 Hz and a voltage increase of 1 mV) was transmitted through the electrodes until a mild twitch of the vertebral body of the animal was observed. One hundred SCEP responses were averaged for each rat to obtain high-quality waveforms for the SCEP signals. Tissue processing At eight weeks after SCI, rats were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused with 500 mL of 0.9% normal saline. Then, 1 cm samples of spinal cord tissue containing the lesion center were promptly extracted from the animals ( n  = 5 per group) and used for Western blot analysis. Other rats continued to be perfused with 300 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The T8–T11 cord segments were dissected and then postfixed overnight in 4% PFA and soaked at 4 °C overnight in 10% sucrose, followed by 30% sucrose until the tissue sank to the bottom. The specimens were embedded in an optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound, frozen at –20 °C, and sliced at a thickness of 10 μm in the sagittal or transverse plane by a cryostat (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). Immunofluorescence staining Coverslips with cells ( n  = 5 per group) or tissue sections of the spinal cord ( n  = 5 per group) were fixed in 4% PFA for 30 min and then permeabilized and blocked with 0.3% Triton X-100 combined with 5% BSA for 1 h. The coverslips with cells or tissue sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C in primary solution at a 1:300 dilution. After three washes in PBS, the primary antibodies were probed with the secondary antibodies at a 1:500 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the coverslips or tissue sections were washed in PBS three times and mounted using Prolong Gold Antifade Reagent containing 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA). The targeted marker-positive cells in each visual field were counted under a confocal laser scanning microscope (880, Carl Zeiss AG, Germany). Five random fields in each coverslip or tissue section from each group were examined. The antibodies used are listed in Table  2 .

Western blot Protein lysates were extracted from the cells plated on six-well plates ( n  = 5 per group) at 14 days after transfection and from the tissue of spinal cord injury. Cells and tissues were lysed in RIPA buffer, and total protein was extracted. Then, the protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid assay (Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) and equalized before loading. Protein samples were separated by SDS‒PAGE (10% Bis-Tris Gel), transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, USA), and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk (Sigma, Germany) in TBST (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.6) for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation with primary antibodies at a 1:1000 dilution at 4 °C overnight. After three washes in TBST, the PVDF membranes were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature and washed in TBST three times. Immunolabeling was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Millipore, Bedford, USA). The antibodies used are listed in Table  2 . TUNEL assay The TUNEL assay was conducted by using the TUNEL kit (Roche, Reinach, Switzerland). After 30 min of fixation with 4 % PFA and 15 min of permeabilization with 0.3 % Triton X-100, the cells were incubated with TUNEL reagent for 1 h at 37 °C in the dark. Finally, stained cells were analyzed under a confocal laser scanning microscope. Axonal tracing In the 7th postoperative week, the rats ( n  = 5 per group) were randomly selected for retrograde labeling of host axonal tracts. The cell bodies of neurons projecting to the spinal cord caudal to the transplanted area were labeled with Fluorogold (FG; Biotium, San Francisco, USA). Briefly, a dorsal laminectomy was performed at T12, and 0.5 μl of FG was injected into the spinal cord using a Hamilton syringe. At 1 week after injection, the animals were sacrificed, and the T8 segment of the spinal cord was removed, cryopreserved in graded sucrose solutions, and sliced into 10 μm frozen sections. The sections were observed via a confocal laser scanning microscope (880, Carl Zeiss AG, Germany) to detect and count FG-labeled neurons in the ventricles. The number of FG-labeled axons was assessed by two independent examiners who were blinded to the rats’ treatment status. The rats injected with FG were not used for functional evaluation. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining For visualization of the cavity area, samples ( n  = 5 per group) were used for HE staining. The T8–T11 longitudinal spinal cord sections from each group were stained with HE according to standard protocols and observed under a brightfield microscope (BX53, Olympus, Japan). Myelination observation For myelination assessment, rats ( n  = 5 per group) were anesthetized at 8 weeks after SCI and perfused with 2.5% glutaraldehyde (Kemiou, Tianjin, China; 25% glutaraldehyde: 4% PFA = 1:9). The harvested tissues were postfixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, subsequently incubated in 1% osmium tetroxide, and then cleared in propylene oxide post-dehydration in a series of graded alcohols. After being embedded in pure Epon, transverse semithin section (1 μm) were obtained and stained with 1% toluidine blue. For electron microscopy (EM), 50 nm ultrathin sections were required and double-stained with 2% uranyl acetate and led citrate for EM analysis. The number of myelinated axons was counted, and the morphology of myelin was observed under EM. Nissl staining Nissl staining ( n  = 5 per group) was performed on transverse sections rostral to the epicenter with 0.1% cresyl violet (Sigma‒Aldrich, C5042) for 20 min at 37 °C. After the samples were rinsed in distilled water, the stained sections were differentiated in 95% ethyl alcohol. Then, the sections were dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethyl alcohol and cleared in xylene. Subsequently, these sections were imaged and quantified under an optical microscope (BX53, Olympus, Japan) with high magnification. A total of five sections were quantified for each rat, and the average number of each group was calculated to determine neuronal survival. Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., USA). All data in the study were first tested for normality using the Shapiro–Wilk test, which revealed a normal distribution. All data are expressed as the means ± SDs and were analyzed via one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests for multiple comparisons or Student’s t test for pairwise comparisons.  P  < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.",Guoliang Chen; Xianlong Li; Hongzhang Zhu; Huachuan Wu; Dacheng He; Liangyu Shi; Fuxin Wei; Xizhe Liu; Ningning Chen; Shaoyu Liu,Experimental & molecular medicine,2022-10,10.1038/s12276-022-00850-9,minimal,True
PMID:7485397,Neurofibromatosis type 2 protein co-localizes with elements of the cytoskeleton.,"The product of the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene is a 595-amino-acid protein bearing resemblance to a family of band-4.1-related proteins. These proteins, including ezrin, radixin, and moesin, probably function as molecular linking proteins, connecting the cytoskeleton to the cell membrane. On the grounds of the homology to the ezrin, radixin, and moesin proteins and on the basis of its predicted secondary structure, the NF2 protein is also thought to act as a cytoskeleton-cell membrane linking protein. Using monoclonal antibodies to amino- and carboxyl-terminal synthetic NF2 peptides we demonstrate the co-localization of the NF2 protein with elements of the cytoskeleton in a COS cell model system and in cultured human cells. Furthermore, the presence of the NF2 protein in tissue sections is shown. The monoclonal antibodies specifically stain smooth muscle cells and the stratum granulosum of the human epidermis. In cultured smooth muscle cells the NF2 protein co-localizes with actin stress fibers. Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrates the presence of the NF2 protein associated with keratohyalin granules and to a lesser extent with intermediate filaments in the human epidermis. We conclude that the NF2 protein is indeed associated with multiple elements of the cytoskeleton.",,M A den Bakker; M Tascilar; P H Riegman; A C Hekman; W Boersma; P J Janssen; T A de Jong; W Hendriks; T H van der Kwast; E C Zwarthoff,The American journal of pathology,1995-11,,abstract_only,False
PMID:9001241,Nf1-deficient mouse Schwann cells are angiogenic and invasive and can be induced to hyperproliferate: reversion of some phenotypes by an inhibitor of farnesyl protein transferase.,"We have developed a potential model of Schwann cell tumor formation in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). We show that mouse Schwann cells heterozygous or null at Nf1 display angiogenic and invasive properties, mimicking the behavior of Schwann cells from human neurofibromas. Mutations at Nf1 are insufficient to promote Schwann cell hyperplasia. Here we show that Schwann cell hyperplasia can be induced by protein kinase A activation in mutant cells. Removal of serum from the culture medium also stimulates hyperplasia, but only in some mutant cells. After serum removal, clones of hyperproliferating Schwann cells lose contact with axons in vitro, develop growth factor-independent proliferation, and exhibit decreased expression of the cell differentiation marker P0 protein; hyperproliferating cells develop after a 1-week lag in Schwann cells heterozygous at Nf1. The experiments suggest that events subsequent to Nf1 mutations are required for development of Schwann cell hyperplasia. Finally, an anti-Ras farnesyl protein transferase inhibitor greatly diminished both clone formation and hyperproliferation of null mutant cells, but not invasion; farnesyl transferase inhibitors could be useful in treating benign manifestations of NF1.",,H A Kim; B Ling; N Ratner,Molecular and cellular biology,1997-02,10.1128/MCB.17.2.862,abstract_only,False
PMID:15570216,Targeted gene expression in the chicken eye by in ovo electroporation.,"PURPOSE: The chicken embryo lens is a classical model system for developmental and cell biology studies. To understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie the morphological changes that occur during lens development, it is important to develop an effective gene transfer method that permits the analysis of gene functions in vivo. In ovo electroporation has been successfully used for introducing DNA into neural and mesenchymal tissues of chicken embryos. In this study, we explored the possibility of using this technique to manipulate gene expression in lens epithelial and fiber cells, as well as in other cells of the chicken eye. METHODS: Two DNA constructs were used in this study. pCAX contains a chicken beta-actin promoter fused to the CMV IE enhancer to drive enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression. pMES-cNf2 uses the same chimeric promoter to drive the expression of the chicken neurofibromatosis 2 (cNf2) and EGFP proteins in the same cell. Plasmid DNA was injected into the lumen of the lens vesicle in chicken embryos at stage 15. For corneal epithelial and retinal cell electroporation, DNA was placed near the surface ectoderm in the eye region or injected into the vitreous cavity, respectively. Electroporation was performed with one electrode above the eye and the other underneath the head of the embryo. Chicken embryos were harvested at different time points for EGFP expression analysis by immunohistochemistry. 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assays were used to evaluate the effects of cNf2 on lens epithelial cell proliferation. RESULTS: A strong EGFP signal can be detected in lens cells 4 h after electroporation. The transfected cells maintain high levels of EGFP expression for at least 5 days. Overexpressing cNf2 in lens epithelial cells significantly inhibits cell proliferation. Ectopic expression of EGFP in corneal epithelial and retinal cells was also achieved by in ovo electroporation. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that exogenous DNA can be effectively introduced into lens, corneal and retinal cells in the living embryo by in ovo electroporation. In comparison to viral infection and transgenic mouse approaches, in ovo electroporation offers an easier and quicker way to manipulate gene expression during embryonic development. This technique will be a useful tool for exploring the molecular mechanisms of lens and eye development.",,Ya-Xiong Chen; Catherine Ellen Krull; Lixing Wang Reneker,Molecular vision,2004-11-17,,abstract_only,False
PMID:2491777,Genetic linkage mapping of chromosome 17 markers and neurofibromatosis type I.,"The von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1) gene has been localized to the pericentromeric region of chromosome 17. We have screened six multigenerational families with multiple, tightly linked markers to aid in mapping this region of the chromosome. More than 150 members in six families were typed with probes including HHH202, D17Z1, EW203, EW206, EW207, EW301, pA10-41, D17S37, and D17S36. Two-point lod scores for NF1 versus all markers were calculated. HHH202 demonstrated the tightest linkage to NF1 with theta = .0, z = 3.86 (95% confidence limits [CL] of theta = .0-.13), suggesting that HHH202 be considered as a potential candidate marker for use in carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis. Pairwise marker-to-marker lod scores were used in examining the most likely order of subsets of the markers. Of those tested, the most likely order was (pter)-pA10-41-EW301-D17Z1-HHH202-NF1-E W206-EW207-EW203-(qter). In addition, we have ascertained an NF1 x NF1 half-cousin mating in which there are four affected family members who are potentially homozygous for the disease gene. Two of these four individuals have been sampled and typed for marker loci. When their D17Z1 genotypes are considered, the probability that both these individuals are heterozygous is 85%.",,J M Vance; M A Pericak-Vance; L H Yamaoka; M C Speer; G O Rosenwasser; K Small; P C Gaskell; W Y Hung; M J Alberts; C S Haynes,American journal of human genetics,1989-01,,abstract_only,False
PMID:24817309,Nf2/Merlin controls spinal cord neural progenitor function in a Rac1/ErbB2-dependent manner.,"OBJECTIVE: Individuals with the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) cancer predisposition syndrome develop spinal cord glial tumors (ependymomas) that likely originate from neural progenitor cells. Whereas many spinal ependymomas exhibit indolent behavior, the only treatment option for clinically symptomatic tumors is surgery. In this regard, medical therapies are unfortunately lacking due to an incomplete understanding of the critical growth control pathways that govern the function of spinal cord (SC) neural progenitor cells (NPCs). METHODS: To identify potential therapeutic targets for these tumors, we leveraged primary mouse Nf2-deficient spinal cord neural progenitor cells. RESULTS: We demonstrate that the Nf2 protein, merlin, negatively regulates spinal neural progenitor cell survival and glial differentiation in an ErbB2-dependent manner, and that NF2-associated spinal ependymomas exhibit increased ErbB2 activation. Moreover, we show that Nf2-deficient SC NPC ErbB2 activation results from Rac1-mediated ErbB2 retention at the plasma membrane. SIGNIFICANCE: Collectively, these findings establish ErbB2 as a potential rational therapeutic target for NF2-associated spinal ependymoma.","Methods To identify potential therapeutic targets for these tumors, we leveraged primary mouse  Nf2 -deficient spinal cord neural progenitor cells. Materials and Methods Ethics Statement All mice were maintained in strict accordance with recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health and active animal studies protocols approved by the Animal Studies Committee at the Washington University School of Medicine (Protocol #20110111). All surgery was performed under isoflurane anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. All efforts were made to optimize experiments and reduce the number of animals used. Human spinal cord and ependymoma sections were obtained from St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital (Memphis TN) and the Washington University School of Medicine Tissue Procurement Core ( http://pathology.wustl.edu/research/cores/ltp/request.php ), and used under an Institutional Review Board approved Human Studies Protocol (#201103323) to comply with ethical standards as well as government and institutional regulations. No direct patient consent was necessary, as these specimens were de-identified. Mice 
 Nf2 
 flox/flox  mice carrying a LoxP insertion in the  Nf2  gene  [13]  were maintained at the Washington University School of Medicine. Male and female embryos (E12.5) from mice maintained on a mixed C57BL/6 and FVB/N background were used for all experiments. Culture and Generation of  Nf2 −/− Neurospheres Spinal cords dissected from E12.5 mouse  Nf2 
 flox/flox  embryos were used to generate NPCs as previously reported  [14] . Briefly, spinal cords were removed from embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) decidua of timed-pregnant females and processed to obtain single-cell suspension of neural progenitors (neurospheres). Dissected spinal cords were digested with trypsin digest buffer containing 0.2% BSA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 0.5 mg/ml DNase I (Sigma), and 10% trypsin-EDTA stock (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) in HBSS at 37°C for 15 min in a volume of 0.7 ml per litter. Equal volumes of 10% FBS medium containing 10% FBS (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) and low glucose DMEM/(Sigma) were added, and spinal cords were triturated with fire-polished Pasteur pipettes. Pelleted cells were washed with dissociation medium containing 15 mM HEPES (Sigma), 0.5% glucose in HBSS. Cells were finally resuspended in NSC medium containing a 5∶3 mixture of DMEM low glucose: Neurobasal medium (Life Technologies), 0.5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM L-glutamine, 5 IU of penicillin, and 5 µg/ml streptomycin (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 1% N2 supplement (Life Technologies), 2% B27 supplement (Life Technologies), 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Sigma), and 20 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Following infection with adenovirus containing either LacZ (wild-type (WT) NPCs) or Cre ( Nf2 −/− NPCs), merlin expression was determined by Western blotting (6 days after adenovirus infection). NPC Assays Neurospheres were trypsinized (as described above) and plated into individual wells of ultralow-binding 24-well plates with complete NPC medium containing EGF and FGF. For assays in which the diameter and average number of neurospheres were measured, single neurospheres from WT and  Nf2−/−  NPCs were selected, trypsinized and individually plated into a single well of a 24-well plate. After 6 days, the size (diameter/cell growth) and number (clonogenic expansion) of the resulting secondary neurospheres was determined using Metamorph analysis software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale CA). Six wells per group per experiment were counted for these studies. For the proliferation assays, neurospheres from each group were trypsinized, 10 4  cells were seeded in triplicate, and the number of cells assessed by direct cell counting (at 4, 6, and 8 days). Three wells per group per experiment were counted for these studies. Apoptosis was determined by counting the percent of cleaved caspase-3 +  cells (1∶500 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly MA) or Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL; Roche, Indianapolis IN)-immunoreactive cells relative to the total number of DAPI (4′, 6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole)-positive cells. Pharmacologic inhibitor experiments used 10 4  cells per well (NSC23766, 10 µM; AG825, 10 µM; Sigma, St. Louis MO) for 6 days. All experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. Viral Transduction Murine stem cell virus (MSCV) infection was employed to express human WT or mutant (L64P patient mutation) merlin, mutant ErbB2 (V659E; Martine Roussel, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Memphis TN), or dominant-negative Rac1 (Rac1 N17 ) as previously described  [15] . Mouse  Erbb2  (GenBank accession numbers  NM_001003817.1  and  XM_109715 .3-689) small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) lentiviral plasmids were obtained from the Washington University Genome Institute and generated as previously reported  [16] . PLKO virus was used as an empty vector control. Viruses used are listed in  Table S1 . Neurospheres were trypsinized and plated with complete NSC media (as described above) in ultralow-attachment 100 mm dishes (Corning, NY) and virus was added (MOI-10) at 37°C overnight. Cells were then pelleted, plated in fresh complete NSC media and allowed to grow for 6 days. Neurospheres were then trypsinized and infected with adenovirus (as described above), and allowed to grow for 6 days. Cells were then trypsinized and assays were established accordingly. Western Blotting Western blots were performed as previously described  [17] . Briefly, neurospheres (after 6 days in culture) were lysed in MAPK lysis buffer (20 mM Tris (pH 7.0), 10 mM EGTA, 400 mM B-glycerophosphate, 1% NP-40, 2.5 mM MgCl 2 , and 2 mM sodium orthovanadate with protease inhibitors (leupeptin, aprotinin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). For all experiments, 30 µg of protein per sample were loaded in each lane. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA) prior to detection with phospho-specific antibodies. Antibodies that detect the total expression of the corresponding signaling intermediate as well as α-tubulin were used as controls for equal protein loading and quantitation. Active Rac1 (Rac1-GTP) was determined by PAK1-PBD affinity chromatography (Rac1 activation Assay Kit, Millipore, Bedford MA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling, Beverly MA) were used for detection by enhanced chemiluminescence (New England Biolabs, Beverly MA). Antibodies used are listed in  Table S2 . Subcellular Fractionation Subcellular fractionation was performed as previously described  [18] . Briefly, following hypotonic (10 mM HEPES at pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM KCl, protease inhibitors) lysis, nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation, and supernatants were subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000×g for 1 h at 4°C to generate cytosolic and membrane fractions. Equal percentages of each fraction (10 µl per lane (200 µl of total volume)) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Immunohistochemistry and Immunocytochemistry Sections were treated with citrate antigen retrieval solution (10 mM, pH 6.0) and stained with pErbB2 (1∶50 dilution) as previously described  [14] . Images were acquired on a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope (Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a Leica EC3 optical camera and Leica Application Suite 2.10 (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Immunocytochemistry was performed on trypsinized NPCs grown in 50 µg/mL poly-D-lysine-coated and 10 µg/mL fibronectin-coated 24-well plates containing defined medium (5∶3 mixture of DMEM low glucose (Life Technologies): neurobasal medium (Life Technologies), 0.5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM L-glutamine, 5 IU penicillin, and 5 µg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies) supplemented with 1% N2 supplement (Life Technologies) and 2% B27 supplement (Life Technologies)) without growth factors. After 5 days in culture, cells were fixed and stained with appropriate primary antibodies at 4°C overnight.

PMID:25535838,Transient inhibition of the ERK pathway prevents cerebellar developmental defects and improves long-term motor functions in murine models of neurofibromatosis type 1.,"Individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) frequently exhibit cognitive and motor impairments and characteristics of autism. The cerebellum plays a critical role in motor control, cognition, and social interaction, suggesting that cerebellar defects likely contribute to NF1-associated neurodevelopmental disorders. Here we show that Nf1 inactivation during early, but not late stages of cerebellar development, disrupts neuronal lamination, which is partially caused by overproduction of glia and subsequent disruption of the Bergmann glia (BG) scaffold. Specific Nf1 inactivation in glutamatergic neuronal precursors causes premature differentiation of granule cell (GC) precursors and ectopic production of unipolar brush cells (UBCs), indirectly disrupting neuronal migration. Transient MEK inhibition during a neonatal window prevents cerebellar developmental defects and improves long-term motor performance of Nf1-deficient mice. This study reveals essential roles of Nf1 in GC/UBC migration by generating correct numbers of glia and controlling GC/UBC fate-specification/differentiation, identifying a therapeutic prevention strategy for multiple NF1-associcated developmental abnormalities.","Materials and methods Control and mutant mice Three independent Cre transgenic strains under the control of hGFAP, Math1 and L7 promoters were utilized to target an  Nf1  mutation into different cell lineages during cerebellar development. The control mice for  Nf1 hGFAP CKO mice are a pool of phenotypically indistinguishable mice: hGFAP-cre-; Nf1 flox/flox , hGFAP-cre−; Nf1 flox/+  and hGFAP-cre+; Nf1 flox/+ . The control mice with similar genetic configurations were used for  Nf1 Math1 CKO and  Nf1 L7 CKO mice. All the CKO mice have genotypes of Cre+; Nf1 flox/flox . Nf1 hGFAP CKO,  Nf1 Math1 CKO,  Nf1 L7 CKO and control mice were maintained in the mixed backgrounds of C57Bl6, 129Svj and FVB, which improved overall health and lifespan of  Nf1 hGFAP CKO mice. Age- and littermate-matched control and mutant mice were used for analysis. Tamoxifen inducible strain  Nf1 NcreER CKO is described in later sections along with the tamoxifen administration protocol. All mice in this study were cared for according to the guidelines that were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committees of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, MI and the Children's National Medical Center in Washington, DC. MEK inhibitor treatment MEK inhibitor (MEKi, PD0325901, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 25 mg/ml and resuspended in vehicle (0.5% hydroxypropyl methyl-cellulose with 0.2% Tween80, Sigma-Aldrich) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. The solution was administered by oral gavage at the dosage of 5 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg (body weight) daily to lactating females for the treatment of P0.5–P21 mice. MEKi-treated mice were collected and compared to littermate control mice and vehicle-treated  Nf1 hGFAP CKO and  Nf1 Math1 CKO mice. Tissue preparation and histological analysis Both paraffin and frozen sections were utilized for histological analysis. Control and mutant littermates at various time points were perfused with Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (Sigma-Aldrich). Brains were divided into two hemispheres along the midline and each hemisphere was processed for either frozen blocks (for in situ hybridization and X-gal staining, see below) or paraffin-embedded blocks. For paraffin sections, brains were dissected and post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4°C. Fixed brains were sagittally sectioned at 5 μm thickness. Slides from histologically comparable positions were stained by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and imaged with a light microscope (Olympus BX51, Olympus America Inc., Center Valley, PA). Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin sections as previously described ( Wang et al., 2009 ). The visualization of primary antibodies was performed with the avidin-biotin horseradish peroxidase system (Vectastain ABC kit, Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). The dilutions of primary antibodies used on paraffin sections in this study were: BLBP (1:2000, rabbit, a kind gift from Dr. Todd Anthony), Calbindin (1:1000, mouse, Sigma-Aldrich), GFAP (1:2000, rabbit, DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) and BrdU (1:1000, rat, Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Immunofluorescence was performed on both paraffin and frozen sections. Primary antibodies were visualized by Cy2 (or Alexa 488), Cy3 (or Alexa 555) and Cy5 (or Alexa 647)-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:200, Cy2/Cy3/Cy5, Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA; 1:400, Alexa 488/555/647, Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). The dilutions of primary antibodies used in this study were as follows: GFAP (1:2000, mouse, BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA), GFAP (1:2000, rabbit, DAKO), NeuN (1:400, mouse, Millipore, Billerica, MA), BLBP (1:500, rabbit, a gift from Nathaniel Heintz), Calbindin (1:1000, mouse, Sigma-Aldrich), GABARα6 (1:500, rabbit, Millipore), BrdU (1:1000, rat, Abcam), Ki-67 (1:500, mouse, BD Pharmingen), Tbr2 (1:1000, rabbit, Abcam), Calretinin (1:1000, mouse, Millipore), MAP2 (1:1000, mouse, Sigma-Aldrich), P27 (1:250, rabbit, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), β-gal (1:1000, rabbit, 5 prime-3 prime, Gaithersburg, MD), β-gal (1:3000, chicken, Abcam), p-Erk (1:200, rabbit, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), p-S6 (1:1000, rabbit, Cell Signaling). Sections were examined under a light/fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51). In situ hybridization Brains were removed immediately after decapitation, frozen in a bed of crushed dry ice, sectioned in a sagittal plane at 14 µm with a cryostat, mounted on RNase-free slides, and treated with 4% paraformaldehyde, and incubated in 0.1 M triethanolamine with acetic anhydrate. Radioactive riboprobes were synthesized from template DNA and labeled by S 35 -UTP. For hybridization, an 800 bp Math1 antisense probe was made from a plasmid pLA1-HindIII containing 600 bp of the Math1-coding region and approximately 200 bp of the 5′-flanking sequence ( Helms and Johnson, 1998 ). The Zic1 antisense probe was a 690-bp XhoI–SalI segment from the mouse Zic1 cDNA ( Aruga et al., 1994 ). After hybridization, slides were dipped in photographic emulsion, counterstained, dehydrated and cover-slipped. Tissue were visualized and photographed with darkfield using an Olympus BX51 microscope. Detailed protocol was described previously ( Martin-Zanca et al., 1990 ). Tamoxifen administration in Nestin-cre ER  inducible mice Tamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in corn oil (Sigma-Aldrich) at a concentration of 20 mg/ml and stored at −20°C. Pregnant female mice were intra-peritoneal (IP) injected once with tamoxifen at a dosage of 100 μg/g body weight at E17.5. Their offspring carrying Nestin-cre ER  transgene were collected at P21 for analysis. Nestin-cre ER +;  Nf1 flox/+ ; R26 LacZR  mice were used as controls and Nestin-cre ER +;  Nf1 flox/flox ; R26 LacZR  mice were used as mutants ( Nf1 NcreER CKO). X-gal staining The R26 LacZR  allele was introduced to the control,  Nf1 hGFAP CKO,  Nf1 Math1 CKO,  Nf1 L7 CKO and  Nf1 NcreER CKO mice as a reporter to monitor Cre-mediated recombination. Dissected brains were prepared for frozen sections and sliced at 12 μm and subjected to X-gal staining for 1 hr to overnight, according to the signal intensity. X-gal staining was performed as described previously ( Zhu et al., 1998 ,  2001 ). Co-localization of β-gal expressing cells with other lineage markers was obtained by double immunofluorescence labeling with anti-β-gal antibody. Golgi staining Brains from P8 mice were dissected and subjected to Golgi staining for 10 days using a previously published protocol ( Glaser and Van der Loos, 1981 ). Brains were then sagittally sectioned at 50 μm on a vibrotome and mounted on slides (Leica, Germany). Sections were then developed in the darkroom (20 min 20% Ammonium hydroxide, Sigma-Aldrich + 10 min 20% Kodak fixer, Kodak, Rochester, NY) and dehydrated in ethanol and xylene. BrdU assay Neonatal mice received a single injection of 50 μg/g (gram, body weight) BrdU (Sigma-Aldrich). For proliferation assay, mice were perfused with 4% PFA 2 hr after the last pulse. For cell cycle and differentiation assay, neonatal mice were injected with BrdU 24, 32 and 48 hr prior to analysis at P8. For P8–P18 BrdU differentiation assay, mice were sacrificed 10 days after the initial pulse. In both assays, brains were dissected and processed for paraffin-embedded sections. BrdU immunofluorescence was performed as described previously ( Wang et al., 2009 ). Neuron/glia co-culture, granule cell trans-well migration assay, and in vitro granule cell differentiation assay Cerebella from P6 control and  Nf1 Math1 CKO were dissected and dissociated into single-cell suspension using a previously published protocol ( Lee et al., 2009 ). Granule cells and glia were separated and cultured differently. For neuron/glia co-cultures, cultured glial cells were released by trypsination. Following trypsin inhibition, glial cells were counted, spun down, re-suspended in culture medium, and added to 1-day-old cultures of purified cerebellar neurons at a ratio of 2:1. Trans-well migration assay was performed as described previously ( Watkins and Sontheimer, 2011 ) with the following modifications. Millicell cell culture inserts (Millipore) were placed into 24-well culture plate (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) and granule cells (5.0 × 10 3 ) were added in each upper inserts. The bottom wells contained 10 μg/ml fibronectin as chemo-attractant. They were then incubated for 4 hr in a 37°C humidified CO 2  incubator. At the end of the experiment, remaining cells in the well (top) were stripped with Q-tips. Cells on the opposite side (bottom) of the insert membrane were fixed with 4% PFA for 30 min and stained with DAPI. The number of cells migrated through the membrane was counted based on high-power images of membranes and the average cell number of 5 areas (up, down left, right, center) and was subjected to statistical analysis. For in vitro differentiation assay, dissociated cerebellar granule cell progenitors were plated on Poly-D-Lysine-coated cell culture plates in growth media without EGF and FGF. Cells were fixed after 72 hr and stained for MAP2 and DAPI. Both trans-well migration assay and in vitro differentiation assay were repeated with cells obtained from at least three mice. Western blot analysis Snap-frozen tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer for 20 min on ice and subjected to centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. Equal amounts of protein samples were mixed with 1X SDS loading buffer [50 mM Tris-HCL (pH6.8), 2% SDS, 0.05% bromophenol blue, 10% glycerol, 100 mM β-mercaptoethanol] (Biorad, Hercules, CA). Samples were separated on SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto NC membranes (Millipore). The blots were then blocked in 5% non-fat milk in TBST, followed by incubation of primary antibodies at 4°C overnight. After washing, the blots were incubated in horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 hr. Signals were detected using ECL or ECL plus (GE healthcare, UK) followed by film development. The primary antibodies used were as follows: p-Erk, Erk, p-S6, S6, p-Akt, Akt (1:1000, rabbit, Cell Signaling) and Nf1 (1:1000, rabbit, Upstate, Lake Placid, NY). Rapamycin treatment Rapamycin (Millipore) was dissolved in 100% sterile-filtered ethanol at a concentration of 10 mg/ml and resuspended in vehicle (5.2% PEG400 with 5.2% Tween80, Sigma-Aldrich) at a final concentration of 0.4 mg/ml. The solution was administered by intraperitoneal injection at the dosage of 4 mg/kg (body weight) every other day from P0.5–P21. Rapamycin-treated mice were collected and compared to littermate control and  Nf1 hGFAP CKO mice treated with vehicle. Rotarod test Motor function and motor learning were evaluated by rotarod apparatus. 1 hr before the rotarod test, mice were transferred from the holding room to the experimental room. Mice were tested for 4 consecutive days at P21–P24 and P45–P49. The speed of the rotarod was constantly accelerated from 4 to 34 rpm over a 5-min period. The latency to fall from the rod was recorded. The test was stopped at 12 min. Quantification and statistical analysis Anatomically comparable sections from control and mutant brains were visualized under an Olympus BX51 microscope. Images were captured and subjected to analysis. Lengths, areas and the number of cells were quantified using the ImageJ software package. Statistical analysis was carried out using unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test. Comparisons across more than two groups were based on Anova test. At least three animals from each group were used for quantification. Data were presented as mean ± Standard Error Mean (SEM). p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. When quantifying cells in specific folia, we used the following criteria to define the areas to quantify. ‘Folia V/IV’ refers to the junction between folia V and IV at 20× magnification (i.e.,  Figure 1A  middle panels) and the quantification covered this entire area. Similarly, ‘Folia IX/X’ refers to the junction between folia IX and X at 20× magnification (i.e.,  Figure 5—figure supplement 2A ). ‘Folium V’ or ‘Folium X’ refers to 40× images in these folia close to the center of the cerebellum that were imaged at comparable positions in controls and mutants.",Edward Kim; Yuan Wang; Sun-Jung Kim; Miriam Bornhorst; Emmanuelle S Jecrois; Todd E Anthony; Chenran Wang; Yi E Li; Jun-Lin Guan; Geoffrey G Murphy; Yuan Zhu,eLife,2014-12-23,10.7554/eLife.05151,minimal,True
PMID:40507334,Development of a Novel Biomarker Platform for Profiling Key Protein-Protein Interactions to Predict the Efficacy of BH3-Mimetic Drugs.,"One of the hallmarks of cancer cells is their failure to respond to the cellular mechanism of apoptosis. The B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) family of proteins regulate apoptosis. Their ability to do so can be measured using several methods that in turn anticipate the fate of the cancer cell in response to apoptosis-inducing treatment. These assays ultimately identify the readiness of the cancer cell to undergo apoptosis, which is referred to as the mitochondrial priming state. These metrics, however, have been challenging to implement in the clinic. ","2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Monoclonal Ab (mAb) Generation Immunogens for mouse immunization and substrates for downstream hybridoma selection were prepared for the generation of mAbs to their corresponding heterodimer complexes using the two different strategies outlined below. i. Anti-MCL-1:BIM and Anti-BCL-XL:BIM Human MCL-1-glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and BCL-XL-GST fusion proteins were cloned into the pGEX 4T-1 expression plasmid (available from Addgene, Watertown, MA, USA). Proteins were expressed in BL21 (DE3)  E.coli  and purified using Amersham HiTrap glutathione columns on an AKTA-FPLC as previously described [ 16 ]. Using a proprietary process, BCL-XL:BIM heterodimer was prepared by covalently linking BCL-XL to the BIM-BH3 domain peptide ( Supplemental Illustration S1 ). The peptide was selected following an antecedent screen in which a series of BIM-BH3 domain peptides were prepared (C-AHA-MRPEIWIAQELRRIGDEFNA-[NH2]) with 4-benzoyl phenylalanine (BPA) residues. These modified peptides were synthesized at Anaspec (Fremont, CA, USA) and used to replace the sterically similar aromatic amino acids in the peptide one by one ( Supplemental Figure S2 ). The modified peptides were then tested for their BCL-XL binding affinity using fluorescence polarization assays as described previously [ 16 ]. The BPA-modified peptide with the most similar binding affinity to the wild-type BIM BH3 peptide (4 nM) was chosen for covalent linking. This was performed by adding a 2-fold molar excess of BPA-BIM-BH3 to BCL-XL-GST and exposing the complex to UV light for 1 h [ 35 ]. After reaction completion, the unbound BCL-XL-GST was removed by purification using a biotinylated-BIM BH3-streptavidin-bead column (Arco Biosystems, Newark, DE, USA). The flow-through was collected and prepared for mouse immunization. An analogous method was used to generate MCL-1:BIM complexes. PRIMABs were generated following immunization with the immunogen in an emulsion mix with complete Freund’s adjuvant into DiversimAb mice (Abveris Inc., Quincy, MA, USA). Hybridoma clones were selected for the following binding properties by ELISA: (i) BCL-XL:BIM and MCL-1:BIM specificity; (ii) absence of binding to monomeric forms of BCL-XL, MCL-1, and BCL-2 or BIM. ii. Anti-BCL-2:BIM In contrast to the BCL-XL and MCL-1 immunogens, the BCL-2:BIM complex immunogen was a proprietary recombinant antigen composed of the BH3 domain-containing segment of BIM tethered with a glycine linker to GST-BCL-2. DiversimAb mice (Abveris Inc.) were immunized with the BCL-2:BIM immunogen at Abveris (now TWIST, South San Francisco, CA USA). Hybridoma cell lines secreting antibodies that specifically bound BCL-2:BIM complex, but not the corresponding monomers, other BCL-2 family member monomers, or BCL-2 complexed with BID, BAD, or BAX, moved forward for flow cytometry, immunofluorescence (IF), and immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing. Occupation of the BH3 binding hydrophobic pocket in all immunogens was confirmed using fluorescence polarization following methods described previously [ 16 ]. 2.2. ELISA for Heterodimer Specificity of PRIMABs For the negative screen, glutathione-coated ELISA plates (Thermo Scientific Pierce, Cat# 15140, Waltham, MA, USA) were coated with 100 µL/well of the following individual anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins: GST-BCL-XL (1 µg/mL), GST-BCL-2 (1 µg/mL), or GST-MCL-1 (1 µg/mL) diluted in PBS. Background control wells were rinsed with 100 µL/well PBS. Unbound antigen was washed out twice with 300 µL/well PBS + 0.1% Tween-20. Wells were then blocked with 300 μL PBS + 3% ( w / v ) BSA for 1 h. To construct the PRIMAB target antigen for the positive screen, the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members of the respective protein complexes were first coated on the wells as above. The plate-bound anti-apoptotic proteins were subsequently complexed with full-length recombinant BIM protein or BIM BH3-domain-containing peptides at 1 µM (unless otherwise stated) in 100 µL/well for 2 h at room temperature with shaking. After two washes with 300 µL/well PBS + 0.1% Tween-20, 100 µL/well of each hybridoma supernatant-derived candidate PRIMAB clone (at the indicated concentrations) was added, and the plate was incubated for one hour. Unbound mAb was washed off with three 300 µL/well washes of PBS + 0.1% Tween-20. Bound heterodimer-specific mouse IgG was then detected with 100 µL/well of HRP conjugated donkey anti-murine IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs, West Grove, PA, USA) diluted 1:3000 in PBS + 3% ( w / v ) BSA. Wells were washed three times with PBS + 0.1% Tween 20, then treated with 100 µL/well of 1-step Ultra TMB substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#34028, Waltham, MA, USA). Once sufficient blue intensity was observed, the reaction was stopped with the addition of 50 µL/well 0.1 M H 2 SO 4 . Optical densities for wells were recorded at 450 nm on a Tecan Infinite F Plex plate reader (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland). To establish the specificity of the PRIMABs, protein complexes coated on wells as above were treated with a 10-fold dilution series of BH3-mimetics (ABT-199 to target BCL-2, A1331852 and A1155463 to target BCL-XL, and ABT-263 to target BCL-XL+BCL-2). All treatments with BH3 mimetics were carried out for 1 h at room temperature prior to analysis by ELISA as described above. 2.3. PRIMAB Assessment of Intracellular BCL-2 Family PPIs Using Flow H929, U266B1, U2932, MCF7, and HT229 cell lines were selected based on historic demonstrations of their dependences on corresponding BCL-2-family members [ 14 , 16 , 29 ]. Except for MCF7, HT229, and HCC1937 (gifts from Dr. Bora Limb, MD Anderson Cancer Research Center, Houston, TX, USA), all cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA;  Supplemental Table S1 ). Cell lines not recently purchased were tested for cell line authenticity by measuring short tandem repeats by STR profiling (Wi Cell, Madison, WI, USA). Cell lines were routinely tested for mycoplasma using a MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland). All cell lines were cultured as per manufacturers’ guidelines. H929, U266B1, U2932, and HCC1937 were grown in RPMI-1640 (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). MCF7, MEF, and HT229 were grown in DMEM with 2 mM L-glutamine (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and 10% FBS. All media were changed to containing 5% FBS during treatments. Suspension cell lines were plated in 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, Monroe, NC, USA) at 30,000 cells/well and treated at the indicated times at 0.5% CO2/37 °C with BH3-mimetics targeting the critical BCL-2 family members BCL-2 (ABT-199/Venetoclax, 2 µM for 3 h), MCL-1 (AZD5991, 1 µM for 6 h), or BCL-XL (A1155463, 3 µM for 8 h), or with an equivalent volume of DMSO as a control (Figure 2A). Cells were then rinsed with PBS, fixed with 4% ( v / v ) paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% ( v / v ) Triton-X 100, and blocked with 1% ( w / v ) BSA. Cells were then stained with PRIMABs specific for BCL-2:BIM (HSB2B), MCL-1:BIM (HSMCB), or BCL-XL:BIM (HSBXB) (see  Supplemental Table S1  for details). BCL-2:BIM complexes were detected with APC-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibodies ( Table 1 ). To measure total (complexed and noncomplexed) BCL-2, MCL-1, BCL-XL, or BIM, the same protocol was followed except using commercially available fluorescent labeled rabbit monoclonal antibodies against each target BCL-2 protein ( Table 1 ). Fluorescent signals were then read on a Canto 2 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) as mean fluorescence intensities (MFI) in the selected gates. FACSDiva v6.1 and FlowJo software v10.0.8 (BD Biosciences) were used to collect and analyze data. For analysis, both the MFI and the “priming ratio” (PRIMAB MFI divided by constituent anti-apoptotic protein MFI (i.e., [HSB2B/total BCL-2], [HSMCB /total MCL-1], [HSBXB/total BCL-XL])) were used. Based on these data, we established the range of values representative of HIGH (e.g., from H929 cells known to be highly primed cells for MCL-1 [ 16 ]) and LOW (e.g., from BIM KO cell lines) signals. The acceptance criterion was  < 10% CV for HIGH, and <30% CV for LOW. The selective association of PRIMAB signals with BH3-mimetic sensitivities (priming), were demonstrated further in the earlier stage of apoptosis. For this, the IC50s for each of the BH3 mimetics BCL-2 (ABT-199/Venetoclax), MCL-1 (AZD5991), and BCL-XL (A1155463) in cell lines H929, U266B1, and U2932 were determined. Cells were grown as above and treated with each of the BH3 mimetics titrated from 50 nM to 5 µM by 2-fold serial dilution and treated with these for 24 h. The Presto Blue (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) signal was then read on a Tecan Infinite plate reader according to the manufacturer’s specification to determine cell death. The IC50s for each of the cell lines were determined using GraphPad Prism v8.3 (nonlinear regression and dose–response curve fitting) and plotted against the % fold change of PRIMAB reading from baseline and at 1 h of treatment with each of the BH3 mimetics at 1 µM. Baseline readings were set at 1, and the post treatment % fold change in the BCL-2 BIM complex measurements = (Fold change − 1) × 100. 2.4. BIM siRNA and BCL-XL siRNA Knockdown To further confirm the requirement for BIM binding for the HSMCB binding, MCL-1:BIM-positive MCF7 breast cancer cells were transfected in 6-well plates with ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA against BIM ( BCL2L11 ; Dharmacon, Cat#SO-2704885G, Layfayette, CO, USA) using the DharmaFECT transfection reagent (Horizon Discovery, Cat#T-2001-01, Waterbeach, UK) in serum-free medium. BIM siRNAs: GCGGAGAAAUCAAGUUUAA, GGAAGUUUGUUGUGAAUGU, UGAGUCAGAACAAGAGUUA, and UCUUACGACUGUUACGUUA. The transfection cocktail (5 µM siRNA) was mixed and applied to cells following a 20 min incubation at room temperature at a final concentration of 25 nM using antibiotic-free transfection medium (see  Supplemental Table S2 ). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 48 h and analyzed for expression of BIM protein using phycoerythrin conjugated rabbit anti-BIM (Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA, USA) and complexes of BIM with BCL-2 family members using HSMCB, HSB2B, and HSBXB. Similar transfection was carried out using siRNA against BCL-XL (ON-TARGETplus Human  BCL2L1  siRNA SMARTpool, Dharmacon, (Lafayette, CO, USA) Cat#SO-2702960G) GGACAGCAUAUCAGAGCUU; GAAAUGACCAGACACUGAC; CCUACAAGCUUUCCCAGAA; UUAGUGAUGUGGAAGAGAA. 2.5. BIM CRISPR Knockout MCF7 Cell Line Preparation MCF7 cells (1 × 10 6 ) were transfected with 1 µg of a 12:1 DNA ratio of the pCMV-T7-(FZ) SpCas9-BPNLS(SV40)-3xFLAG-P2A-Puro-R plasmid (modified from RTW3027, Addgene #139987) and a plasmid (derived from BPK1520, Addgene #65777) with a sgRNA targeting exon 5 of  BIM  using Polyethylenimine (PEI) at a 4:1 ratio. Following transfection, selection was performed using 1 µg/mL puromycin for 24 h. After recovery for 4 days, cells were plated for clonal selection and expansion. Clones were initially screened by PCR and Sanger sequencing, followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) to confirm successful disruption of all four alleles of  BIM . sgRNA: 5′-ATGGATCGCCCAAGAGTTG-3′. PCR primers: FOR: 5′-GTGAGATGGGCTTGCCTCTA-3′, REV: 5′-TGGGAAAGGAGAAACAATGAA-3′. NGS primers: FOR: 5′-GTGAGATGGGCTTGCCTCTA-3′, REV: 5′-AACATCATTACCCTCCTTGCAT-3′. MCF7 WT and  BIM  KO cell lines were also characterized by Western blotting using lysates prepared in RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Lysates were analyzed on NuPAGE 12% Bis-Tris gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) before transferring to nitrocellulose membranes and processing using the Odyssey CLx protocol (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA). Antibodies: anti-human C-terminal BIM (goat, Bio-RAD, Hercules, CA, USA, AHP2074; 1:1000), anti-human N-terminal BIM (C34C5) (rabbit, Cell Signaling, #2933; 1:1000), and anti-b-tubulin (mouse, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank E7, Iowa City, IA USA, 1:10,000). Secondary antibodies used were anti-goat Alexa Fluor Plus 800 (donkey, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA, A32930, 1:10,000), anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) DyLight 800 (goat, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA, 35571, 1:10,000), and anti-mouse Alexa Fluor Plus 800 (goat, Invitrogen, A32730, 1:10,000). 2.6. Assessment of PRIMABs as Biomarkers in Immunohistochemistry (IHC) on Cell Block Samples of Tissue Microarrays (TMAs) Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were made from blocks of U2932, H929, and U266B1 cell lines treated or untreated with ABT-199, AZD5591, or A1155463, respectively, as described in  Supplemental Table S3 . Following treatments, 35 × 10 6  cells per sample were pelleted, washed, and fixed in 4% ( v / v ) formalin and sent to Alamak Biosciences (Beverly, MA, USA), where they were transferred as concentrated specimens to a flat-bottom glass tube. As a marker for cell identification, 0.01% India ink was added; cells were then mixed with molten HistoGel (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) to position cells in the cutting surface, and cell blocks were cut and processed into TMAs. 2.7. Immunohistochemistry on Formalin-Fixed and Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) Tissue/Cell Substrates Slides coated with FFPE substrates were deparaffinized by incubating for 30 min at 65 °C in a drying oven. Samples were then rehydrated sequentially in (i) xylene, 3 × 10 min; (ii) 100% ethanol, 2 × 5 min; (iii) 95% ethanol 1 × 5 min; (iv) 70% ethanol, 1 × 5 min; (v) dH 2 O, 1 × 5 min. Slides were equilibrated in PBS for 5 min. Antigen retrieval at pH 9.0 was performed for 20 min at 96 °C followed by an additional 60 min incubation at 4 °C. Antigen retrieval buffer (Vector Laboratories catalog #H-3301-250) was rinsed off with three 5 min PBS washes. Hydrophobic barriers around the substrate were marked with a PAP pen, endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with BLOXALL (Vector Laboratories) for 10 min, and slides were washed for 5 min in PBS. Substrates were permeabilized and incubated in blocking buffer (PBS + 5% normal donkey serum + 0.05% ( v / v ) Triton-X100) for one hour. Slides were then stained overnight with primary antibody (diluted in blocking buffer) at 4 °C. Slides were washed in PBS + 0.01% ( v / v ) Tween-20 (3 × 5 min), and bound antibody was detected with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (diluted in blocking buffer at 1:1000) for 60 min at room temperature. Secondary antibody was washed out as above with three washes of PBS + 0.01% ( v / v ) Tween-20. Slides were incubated in impact DAB (Vector Laboratories) brown chromogen for 5 min followed by a 5 min washout with running water. Counterstaining of nuclei was performed for 2 min with Hematoxylin QS (Vector Laboratories). Samples were washed again for 5 min in running water, then dehydrated using 10 s incubations of the rehydration buffers in the reverse order; slides were left to dry prior to mounting. Images were resolved and analyzed using HALO (Indica Labs, Albuquerque, NM, USA) or Image Quant (Cytiva, Marlborough, MA, USA). Post-fixation antigen retrieval details are described in  Supplemental Table S3 . Tissues were scored for extent and intensity of staining using the HALO image analysis software v3.2, which generates a “mean cytoplasmic optical density” (MCOD) for cells per field of view, enabling the degree of priming to be established by the ratio of the MCOD for each of the PRIMABs stained to the MCOD for slides stained with antibodies to the corresponding unbound pro-survival proteins and BIM. A “combined” priming score was generated by summing the scores for each of the PRIMABs. 2.8. IF Imaging of BCL-2 Family PPIs in Breast Cancer Cell Line Using PRIMABs HCC1937 breast cancer cells were grown in DMEM (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with 10% Fetal Calf Serum (FCS) plus 2 mM L-Glutamine in 8-well glass chamber slides (EZ Slide, Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) until near confluence. Cells were treated with 50 nM A1331852 plus 50 µM Z-VAD-FMK (benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone) (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) for 24 h or left untreated and incubated under standard tissue culture conditions. Following treatment, cells were rinsed and fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.05% Triton-X100 in PBS plus 0.1% ( w / v ) BSA. Cells were stained with 1 µg/mL rabbit polyclonal anti-BCL-XL and 1 µg/mL mouse monoclonal HSBXB PRIMAB in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. Unbound antibody was washed away with three PBS washes. Bound HSBXB was detected with anti-mouse-Alexa-488 (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). Bound BCL-XL was detected with anti-rabbit-IgG-Alexa-568 (Invitrogen) following a one-hour room-temperature incubation. Samples were rinsed and mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Newark, CA USA). Image acquisition was performed using a Zeiss LSM 880 with Airyscan confocal microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and analyses performed with ZEN imaging software v2.3 at the Harvard University Center for Bioimaging. 2.9. PRIMAB (HSMCB) Detection of CDK9 Disruption of MCL-1:BIM Complexes in Myeloma Cells H929 cells were grown in RPMI-1640 (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with 10% FBS at 30,000 per well (96 well plates) as above. Growth phase cells were treated with the CDK-9-inhibiting compound Enitociclib (Medchem Express, Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA). Treatments were at 0.1 µM, 1 µM, and 10 µM for 3 h, 6 h, and 16 h. Following treatment cells were rinsed, fixed, and stained with HSMCB and rabbit anti-MCL-1 conjugated to phycoerythrin-CY 7 (Cell Signaling Technologies, Essex, MA, USA) as described above. HSMCB signal was detected with anti-mouse secondary (LifeTechnologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Flow cytometry analysis was performed on a FACSCanto II, and signals were analyzed using FACSDiva (BD Biosciences). 2.10. PRIMAB Correlation with IC 50 s EGFR Inhibitors in Myeloid Cells PRIMAB measurements of BCL-2:BIM, BCL-XL:BIM, and MCL-1:BIM complexes in the human leukemia cell lines KG1a, MV411, EOL-1, SKM-1, F36-P. MOLM-13, NB4, HEL 92.1.7, and SKM-1 were obtained. Cells were thawed, rinsed, fixed, permeabilized, and stained with the PRIMABs as described above. The IC 50 s for the EGFR inhibitors Cetuximab, Osimertinib, and Dacomitinib were obtained from the Broad Institute Cancer Cell Encyclopedia. 2.11. PRIMAB Technical Performance and Signal Range in AML Patient Samples Technical assessment of each of the PRIMABs was conducted using human leukemia and myeloma cell lines. Staining and flow analysis was performed as described above. Flow cytometry runs were performed on cell lines (H929, U266B1, U2932, THP1, ML2, KG1a, MV411, HAL929.1.7, EOL-1, SKM-1, F-36P, MOLM-13, NB4, and RS4-1) with the same operator testing on different days (intraday) and with different operators testing on the same day (intraoperator). Cells grown in suspension were plated at 30,000 cells/well in a 96-well plate (Greiner Bio-One, Monroe, NC, USA). Cells were rinsed with PBS, fixed with 4% ( v / v ) paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% ( v / v ) Triton-X 100, and blocked with 1% ( w / v ) BSA. Cells were then stained with PRIMABs specific for BCL-2:BIM (HSB2B), MCL-1:BIM (HSMCB), or BCL-XL:BIM (HSBXB) (see above for assay details). Cell lines or biopsied cells could be viably frozen, stored, and then fixed or fixed at time of harvesting. We observed no diminution in PRIMAB signal after 4 years of storage in liquid nitrogen. Fixed samples could be stored for up to 4 weeks before analyzing. 2.12. Assessing Signal Range in Naive AML Samples AML patient bone marrow peripheral blood biopsy samples purchased from ReproCell Global (Beltsville, MD, USA) were used to further establish the operating range of PRIMAB signals. Testing was performed using flow cytometry analysis of PRIMAB signals as described below. 2.13. Measurement of BCL-2 Complexes in Biopsied AML Patient Samples Using PRIMABs Newly diagnosed AML patient samples were obtained prior to induction chemotherapy administration at Cardiff University. Specimens were acquired during routine diagnostic assessments in accordance with the regulations and protocols of AML 19 Trial: Patient Information Sheet 9 (Ref: ISRCTN) approved by the investigation review board of Cardiff University. Informed consent was obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Patients in the study ranged in age from 24 to 75. All were treated with 7 + 3 cytarabine + anthracycline [ n  = 21]. Biopsies were from peripheral blood (PB) in patients with whole blood cell counts > 10,000 and > 20% blasts in PB, or from bone marrow (BM). Leucocytes were isolated by Ficoll separation. Samples were either fixed and stored appropriately or viably frozen as described in [ 29 ] and stored for use with the PRIMABs-DX platform. When there were sufficient viable cells (≥4 million leukocytes), BH3 profiling was also performed. Specimens ( n  = 21 patients) consisted of 7 BM and 14 PB samples. AML specimens were washed after thawing and suspended in 1% FBS + 2 mM EDTA-PBS for staining with primary antibodies CD45-V450 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). When possible, patient samples (Ficoll-purified PB or BM) were fixed and stained for PRIMABs and constituent monomer proteins as above with the additional steps of immunophenotyping for the AML Blast cell population for analysis. Purified leucocytes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% ( v / v ) Triton-X 100, blocked, and stained with PRIMABs specific for BCL-2:BIM (HSB2B), MCL-1:BIM (HSMCB), or BCL-XL:BIM (HSBXB) individually and resolved with labeled anti-mouse secondary antibodies. To measure total BCL-2, MCL-1, BCL-XL, and BIM, rabbit monoclonal antibodies against each protein were used. Each had a nonoverlapping fluorescent label, and all were read together in a single well on a FACS Canto 2 flow cytometer. FACSDiva v6.1 and FlowJo software v10.0.08 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) was used to collect and analyze data. For analysis, both the MFI and the “priming ratio” (PRIMAB MFI divided by constituent anti-apoptotic protein MFI ([HSB2B/total BCL-2]; [HSMCB/total MCL-1]; [HSBXB/total BCLX-L]) were used. Acceptance for upper and lower limits were as described above. Event-free survival (EFS) was established as the time from the start of treatment to the occurrence of primary refractory disease, relapse, or death. Relapse was determined to occur when more than 5% blasts in the bone marrow or blasts in the peripheral blood occurred in a patient formerly in complete response (CR). Primary refractory disease (no response, NR) denoted residual leukemia after 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy. For statistical analyses, CR denoted patients who exhibited response with or without subsequent relapse, and NR showed primary refractory disease. Cell lines with known BCL-2 family dependencies and treatments were used to define the range (LOW–HIGH) of responses. The analytical accuracy was determined by comparing the results obtained from flow cytometry for each PRIMAB and monoclonal antibody against each of the constituent proteins in the complex (BCL-2, BCL-XL, MCL-1, and BIM). 2.14. BH3 Profiling of AML Patient Samples Assays were performed in flow cytometry format as previously described [ 33 ]. Viable frozen AML specimens were washed after thawing and suspended in 1% FBS + 2 mM EDTA-PBS for staining with primary antibodies CD45-V450 (BD Biosciences), CD3-biotin (BD Biosciences), and CD20-biotin (eBiosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) and secondary antibody streptavidin-APC (BD Biosciences). Specimens were then permeabilized with digitonin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) and incubated with JC-1 mitochondrial dye (Enzo Life Sciences) and either BH3-domain-containing peptides, DMSO, or carbonyl cyanide  m -chlorophenyl hydrazone (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI USA). Samples were run in duplicate and analyzed on a FACSCanto II using the FACSDiva software v6.1 (BD Biosciences). The blast population was identified as CD45 dim, CD3 negative, and CD20 negative. Intensely stained CD45 cells (mature lymphocytes) were excluded from analyses as described previously [ 33 ]. The quantifiable propensity of a pro-apoptotic peptide (BH3 only) to induce mitochondrial depolarization relative to an uncoupling reagent control is referred to as percent priming. For the blast population, this was calculated using the median signal intensity of the PE channel normalized for DMSO as background (negative control), with CCCP serving as 100% priming (positive control). For calculating the % priming, the following formula was utilized: % Priming = 1 − ([peptide − CCCP]/[DMSO − CCCP]) 2.15. BH3 Profiling of WT and BIM-KO MCF7 Breast Cancer Cell Lines BH3 profiling, a method that involves the perturbation of cells with specific BH3 domain peptides followed by measurements of their response in terms of induction of apoptosis, was performed on MCF7-WT and MCF7-BIM-KO cell lines in a 96-well-plate-based assay as described previously [ 5 , 6 ]. Briefly, cells were permeabilized with digitonin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), incubated with JC-1 (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY USA), and exposed to various BH3 peptides (100 µM BIM, 0.1 µM BIM, 100 µM PUMA, 100 µM NOXA, 50 µM NOXA,100 µM BAD, 100 µM L HRK, 100 µM BID, 50 µM MS1, or 10 µM MS1) (New England Peptides/Biosynth, Boston, MA, USA) at room temperature. CCCP (10 µMol/L) was used to completely depolarize mitochondria and provide a positive control. An Infinite plate reader (Tecan) was used to detect shift fluorescence from JC-1 dye aggregation dispersal as a surrogate for depolarization. The area under the curve for each condition was measured, and the proportion of depolarization was calculated using the following equation: % Priming = 1 − ([peptide − CCCP]/[DMSO − CCCP]) 2.16. Measuring Priming in Solid Tumors Using PRIMABs Immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue/cell substrates was performed as described above. 2.17. Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were performed using statistical software programs within Prism (v8.3; GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). The measurements made using the PRIMABs were assessed for significance over background. Student’s two-tailed  t -test was used for the analysis.  p  < 0.05 was considered significant. We used Pearson’s coefficient to determine if cancer cell sensitivity to treatment, in this case IC50s to the BH3 mimetics, would be associated with the binding signals of the PRIMABs. We assumed an R value > 0.5 would indicate significant association. For BH3-profiling in AML samples, biomarkers were analyzed by testing the association between the PRIMAB biomarker status and the MFI from the blast gate or the BH3 profiling assay readout (percentage priming for BIM 0.1 µM or MS1 50 µM in blast gate) and the responder or nonresponder classification. Here, we examined the relationship between BIM priming and complete remission (EFS) in patients treated with a standard-of-care-based 7 + 3 regimen. Univariate comparisons were made using Mann–Whitney test; all reported  p -values are two-sided. The threshold for significance was  p  < 0.05 for the primary analyses.",Andrew J Kinloch; Faiyaz Rahman; Bahriye Karakas; Muhammad Shahid; Bora Lim; Stephanie J Bouley; James A Walker; Erinna F Lee; Walter D Fairlie; Kevin R Kelly; Michael H Cardone,Cancers,2025-05-31,10.3390/cancers17111852,minimal,True
PMID:41001593,Loss of Schwann cell's normal rhythmic core clock gene expression and gain of rhythmic expression of oncogenic driver genes in malignant NF1-associated peripheral nerve sheath tumor.,Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant tumor syndrome caused by pathogenic variants in the ,"Methods Cell lines Human T265, S462, and NSF1 cell lines of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) being associated with neurofibromatosis type 1, and BRGN control cells used in this study were previously described.  T462 and T265 cells were initially provided by Victor Mautner (University of Hamburg, Germany). MPNST were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin, 2 mM GlutaMAX 38–43 TM  and 2 mM sodium pyruvate (all purchased from Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). The primary human Schwann cells (HSC) were obtained by ScienCell (#1700, Carlsbad, CA, USA). HSC were cultured in Schwann Cell Medium (SCM, ScienCell) adding 1% Schwann cell growth supplement (SCGS), 5% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. All cell lines were incubated with a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2  at 37°C. mRNA isolation For each cell line, 2.5x10 4  cells per well were seeded in 6 well plates (TPP, Trasadingen, Switzerland) in 3 mL complete DMEM medium. After 24 h FBS-free medium was added, and cells were incubated for another 24 h. Then, a serum shock was induced with 10% FBS-containing medium. After that the cells were lysed at six-hour intervals starting at zero and ending at 48 h ( Figure 1 ). For sample collection, cells were washed two times with 1 mL of 4°C cold Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and harvested using 300 µL Lysis Buffer (LBP, MACHERY-NAGEL, Düren, Germany) per well. RNA was isolated with NucleoSpin RNA plus (MACHERY-NAGEL) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
 Figure 1. Experimental workflow. Legend: Created with BioRender.com (agreement number: QY25NKONZ9). cDNA library preparation and NGS analysis 10 ng mRNA per sample was transcribed into cDNA with AmpliSeq for Illumina Library Prep (Illumina, San Diego, USA) following manufacturer`s protocol. Transcript level of the following genes were analyzed using an Illumina custom panel: Jun proto-oncogene ( JUN ), Transforming Growth Factor Alpha ( TGFA ), Period Circadian Regulator 2 ( PER2 ), Prokineticin 2 (PROK2), Clock Circadian Regulator ( CLOCK ), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A (VEGFA), MYC proto-oncogene ( MYC ), Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase 8 (MAP3K8), cAMP Responsive Element Modulator ( CREM ), aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator like ( ARNTL  or  BMAL1 ), Cryptochrome Circadian Regulator 2 ( CRY2 ), Cyclin D1 ( CCND1 ),  TIMELESS , Cryptochrome Circadian Regulator 1 ( CRY1 ), Period Circadian Regulator 1 ( PER1 ), nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group D member 1 ( NR1D1 ), D-Box Binding PAR BZIP Transcription Factor ( DBP ), Casein Kinase 1 Epsilon ( CSNK1E ) and for reference Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyl transferase 1 ( HPRT1)  (Supplementary Table S1). Therefore, library preparation was performed using the AmpliSeq for Illumina Custom Panels procedure (Illumina, San Diego, USA). After library preparation, the samples were analyzed via Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) for pre-sequencing quantification and library quality control. The Illumina MiSeq instrument (Illumina, San Diego, USA) was used to quantify transcript levels. Therefore, quality-controlled libraries were diluted, equimolar pooled and again diluted to 20 pM according to the MiSeq System Denature and Dilute Libraries Guide performing the Standard Normalization Method (Illumina, San Diego, USA). Finally, the denatured and diluted library pool was loaded onto a MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 cartridge with 13 pM and 1% phiX. The sample sheet, the flow cell, the PR2 bottle, the waste bottle, as well as the reagent cartridge were prepared analogously to the MiSeq System Guide (Illumina, San Diego, USA). For sequencing, a paired end run of 151 cycles per read with FASTQ Only was chosen. Resulting FASTQ files were analyzed with CLC Genomics Workbench 22 (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). As no transcripts were detected for  PROK2  and  JUN  in all samples, we did not further include them into evaluation. Quantitative real time PCR 2 µg RNA was transcribed into cDNA using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) with oligo(dT)18-primers according manufacturer’s instructions. The cDNA concentration was set at 20 ng/µl and reverse transcription was done in the PEQLAB primus 25 advanced thermocycler (VWR, Avantor, Radnor, USA). Quantitative determination of Melatonin receptors (MT) was carried out by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The two-step PCR was performed with 10 µl Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA), 500 nM each of the corresponding forward and reverse primer (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA,) (Supplementary Table S2) and 1 µl cDNA (20 ng/µl) in a total volume of 20 µl using the Rotorgene Q (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The corresponding mRNA values for Glycerinaldehyd-3-phosphat-dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) were used as control. Proliferation assays 5x10 3  cells per well of MPNST cells and HSC were seeded in quintuplicates in 96-well plates (TPP, Trasadingen, Switzerland). Cell growth was measured using the Cell Proliferation Kit II (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) following the instructions described by the manufacturer. The experiments were carried out for each cell line in DMEM (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) without serum and supplemented with 10% FBS. To test viability in response to Melatonin treatment, triplicates of 1x10 4  MPNST cells (T265, S462 and NSF1) and control fibroblasts (BRGN) were seeded in 100 µL media in a 96 well format and incubated for 24 hours prior to Melatonin (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) treatment. Then, Melatonin was added, and cells incubated for additional 24 h (physiological presence is normally 12 h during night). For drug treatment, PBS (pH 7.4) was used to dilute Melatonin (0; 0.0025; 0.005; 0.01; 0.1; 1.0 and 10 µM final concentration with 100 µL media per well). After Melatonin treatment, both MPNST and BRGN cells were incubated with 20 µL of CellTiter-Blue Ⓡ  reagent (Promega, Madison, USA) for 1 h and fluorescence (560 nm excitation/590 nm emission) was recorded, normalized and evaluated as previously described. 43 Immunofluorescence 5x10 5  HSC were seeded in 3 mL complete DMEM/F12 per well on poly-L-lysin pre-coated cover slips (2-well Tissue Culture Chambers, Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany) and incubated for 24 h at 37°C and 5% CO 2  during humidified atmosphere. Then, cells were washed with 1.5 mL per well of Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS with Ca 2+  and Mg 2+ , Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing 3 mmol/L MgCl 2 . Subsequently, cells were washed two times with HBSS and fixed with cold methanol of −20°C (Merck, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) on ice for 10 min. The cells were incubated with 1 ml per well blocking buffer containing PBS, 5% normal goat serum (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, USA) and 0.3% Triton X-100 (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) for 1 h. Then, S100 mouse monoclonal primary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, USA) diluted 1:1000 in 900 µL per well PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin (Carl Roth) and 0.3% Triton X-100 (antibody diluting solution), was added to the cells for 16–18 h at 4°C. The next day, cells were washed three times with 1 mL PBS followed by incubation with secondary antibody (1:1000, Anti-Mouse IgG (H+L), F(ab’)2 Fragment Alexa Fluor 488 Conjugate, Cell Signaling Technology) diluted in antibody diluting solution for 90 min at room temperature in the dark. After washing twice with PBS, the chamber was removed, and the slide rinsed again with PBS. Then, the slides were covered with mounting medium containing DAPI (ImmunoSelect Antifading Mounting Medium DAPI, Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) and dried for 24 hours. The imaging was done with Keyence BZ-800E microscope (Keyence, Neu-Isenburg, Germany). Data analysis, statistics, and bioinformatic database analysis NGS data analysis and heat map creation were done using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, Boston, USA) version 9.5.0. Tests for the presence of a circadian rhythm were performed by Cosinor analysis based on established methods (Refinetti, R.; Circadian Physiology, 3 rd  Eds.) as described before  and using a freely available online tool ( 44 https://cosinor.online/app/cosinor.php ). In addition, numerical and graphical analysis was done using the CosinorPy Python package.  To determine the most suitable period length, a “grid-search” approach is employed, where the parameter T is systematically varied between 12 h and 48 h (based on known biological rhythms) in 1000 equidistant steps, due to computing capacities and time. For each period length, CosinorPy calculates both the p-value and the log-likelihood. For the analysis and graphical representation, the python libraries NumPy, 45  pandas version v2.0.3, 46  matplotlib 47  and SciPy 1.0 48  are utilized. The standard deviation was calculated by fitting a second-degree polynomial to the maximum of each log-likelihood assuming that T is Gaussian distributed and defining a threshold-value of it (maximum_log-likelihood − 0.5). This approach seems to overestimate the standard deviation. The combination of graphical representations for the log-likelihood and p-values as a function of T enables the identification of the most probable period length for each gene. 49 Further, three types of gene expression were defined, and the results were compared in both serum starvation and serum shock. A  rhythmic  gene expression was defined as a significant correlation in CosinorPy comparing the expression under serum shock and serum starvation. Expression designed to be  inducible  when gene expression was triggered by the serum shock compared to serum starvation.  Spontaneous  gene expression included both induced, rhythmic and completely independent gene expressions. For analysis of viability under melatonin treatment, we applied statistical testing and graphical representation as previously described in detail. 43 To identify recently provided data for rhythmic gene expression Schwann cells, we performed a bioinformatic search of the following databases: CGDB (Circadian Gene DataBase), CircaDB (Circadian Expression Profiles Database), and GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus).",Sandra Leisz; Antonio Pelligrino; Saskia Fritzsche; Merle Wiegers; Markus Wösle; Christian Linke; Swanhild Lohse; Daniel Tippner; Christian Scheller; Christian Strauss; Eva Ehrentreich-Förster; Faramarz Dehghani; Stanislav Sys; Erik Maronde; Anja Harder,Molecular & cellular oncology,2025,10.1080/23723556.2025.2561292,minimal,True
PMID:7493911,Low incidence of a nucleotide sequence alteration of the neurofibromatosis 2 gene in human breast cancers.,"We investigated aberrations of the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) gene in breast tumors of 60 patients by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction products followed by nucleotide sequencing. We detected a tumor-specific single-base substitution in codon 398 in exon 12 of the gene, resulting in an alteration of a single amino acid, in DNA from a breast cancer sample. The results indicated possible but infrequent involvement of mutations of the tumor suppressor NF2 gene in human breast cancers.",,S Yaegashi; R Sachse; N Ohuchi; S Mori; T Sekiya,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,1995-10,10.1111/j.1349-7006.1995.tb03003.x,abstract_only,False
PMID:26190969,"In vivo synaptic transmission and morphology in mouse models of Tuberous sclerosis, Fragile X syndrome, Neurofibromatosis type 1, and Costello syndrome.","Defects in the rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (Ras)/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways are responsible for several neurodevelopmental disorders. These disorders are an important cause for intellectual disability; additional manifestations include autism spectrum disorder, seizures, and brain malformations. Changes in synaptic function are thought to underlie the neurological conditions associated with these syndromes. We therefore studied morphology and in vivo synaptic transmission of the calyx of Held synapse, a relay synapse in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) of the auditory brainstem, in mouse models of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), Fragile X syndrome (FXS), Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), and Costello syndrome. Calyces from both Tsc1(+/-) and from Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mice showed increased volume and surface area compared to wild-type (WT) controls. In addition, in Fmr1 KO animals a larger fraction of calyces showed complex morphology. In MNTB principal neurons of Nf1 (+/) (-) mice the average delay between EPSPs and APs was slightly smaller compared to WT controls, which could indicate an increased excitability. Otherwise, no obvious changes in synaptic transmission, or short-term plasticity were observed during juxtacellular recordings in any of the four lines. Our results in these four mutants thus indicate that abnormalities of mTOR or Ras signaling do not necessarily result in changes in in vivo synaptic transmission.","Materials and Methods Animals and Experiments Generation of the  Fmr1  KO ( Mientjes et al., 2006 ),  Nf1  ( +/- Jacks et al., 1994 ), and  H-ras  mice ( G12V Schuhmacher et al., 2008 ) has been described previously.  Tsc1  animals were obtained by crossing the  +/- Tsc1  line ( f/+ Meikle et al., 2005 ) once with CAGG-Cre mice to obtain germ-line deletion. Animals were all backcrossed (for at least 10 times) and maintained in C57BL/6J (Harlan). Wild-type (WT) littermates were used as controls. Mutant and WT animals of either sex were used for the experiments. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the European Communities Council Directive and were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Erasmus MC. Surgery Adult mice (30 to 60 days-old) were briefly exposed to isoflurane before they were anesthetized by giving an intraperitoneal injection of a ketamine–xylazine mixture (65 and 10 mg/kg, respectively). Additional anesthesia was given when necessary. A homeothermic blanket (FHC, Bowdoinham, ME, USA) was used to keep the rectal temperature at 36–37°C. Animals were supine positioned, and a tracheotomy was performed so that the animal could be ventilated mechanically with oxygen (MiniVent; type 845; Harvard Apparatus). A small speaker was glued to the inside of the left ear if sound exposure was intended. Animals got a metal pedestal glued to the dorsal side of the skull, which was used to immobilize the head when they were positioned supinely. After doing a tracheotomy, the mice were mechanically ventilated with oxygen. Ventilation frequency and breathing volume were set to approximately 100 strokes/min and 7 μl/g body weight, respectively. The MNTB was accessed ventrally as described previously ( Rodriguez-Contreras et al., 2008 ;  Lorteije et al., 2009 ;  Crins et al., 2011 ). In short, the trachea, larynx, and muscles covering the skull were removed, after which a small craniotomy (1 mm × 1.5 mm) was made by using a drill. The right anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) and basilar artery were used as landmarks to locate the right MNTB, as previously described ( Rodriguez-Contreras et al., 2008 ;  Crins et al., 2011 ). Prior to recording, the dura and pia were removed to expose the brain surface. Ringer solution containing (in mM): NaCl 135, KCl 5.4, MgCl 2  1, CaCl 2  1.8, Hepes 5 (pH 7.2 with NaOH) was applied to keep the brain surface moist. In Vivo  Juxtacellular Recordings In vivo  juxtacellular (loose patch) recordings of the principal neurons were performed as described previously ( Lorteije et al., 2009 ). During recordings, Ringer solution was applied onto the brain surface to prevent it from dehydration. Recordings were done using thick-walled borosilicate glass micropipettes with filament (4.5–5.5 MΩ) filled with Ringer solution. The MNTB was accessed ∼600 μm rostrally and ∼400 μm laterally from the branching point of the right AICA from the basilar artery. The dura and brain surface were penetrated using a positive pressure of 300 mbar. When inside the brainstem the pressure was lowered to ∼30 mbar after passing the brain surface, and to 0 mbar when recording started. Recordings were performed at the depth of 250–500 μm from brain surface. A MultiClamp 700B patch-clamp amplifier and pCLAMP 9.2 software (MDS Analytical Technologies) were used to acquire data. Data was filtered at 10 kHz (8-pole Bessel filter) and sampled at 50 kHz with a 16-bit A/D converter (Digidata 1322A). Auditory Stimulation Closed field sound stimulation was presented to the animal, as described previously ( Tan and Borst, 2007 ). During the experiments the animal was placed in a single-walled sound-attenuated chamber (Gretch-Ken Industries). A speaker probe was inserted into the left ear canal and was stabilized with silicone elastomer. A 2-noise-burst stimulation protocol was designed in MATLAB (Version R2008a), which consists of two 400 ms bursts of wide band noise (bandwidth 2–40 kHz; 80 dB SPL) with intervals of 40, 80, 160, 320, 640, or 1280 ms. The auditory stimulus was generated by Tucker Davis Technologies hardware (TDT, system 3, RX6 processor, PA5.1 attenuator, ED1 electrostatic driver, EC1 electrostatic speaker). Clampex acquisition was triggered at the same time by MATLAB as the auditory stimulation program. Sound intensities were calibrated as previously described ( Tan and Borst, 2007 ). Morphology of the Calyx To study the morphology of the calyx, we electroporated the afferent fibers to the calyx of Held with Alexa Fluor 594-labeled dextrans (10,000 MW; Invitrogen) at the midline  in vivo  in young adult mice (P28–P84) as described previously ( Rodriguez-Contreras et al., 2008 ). The ages of the animal were not exactly matched for the  Tsc1  and the  +/- H-ras  mice and their respective WT controls (Supplementary Figure  G12V S1 ). However, these age differences are unlikely to be meaningful, since we did not see a relation between volume of the calyx with age ( r  = 0.032;  p  = 0.73; Supplementary Figure  S2 ) or between surface and age ( r  = 0.00;  p  = 0.99; Supplementary Figure  S3 ). In addition, logistic regression showed no evidence for a relation between probability of being classified as type II (6–15 boutons; ( Grande and Wang, 2011 ) or type III (>15 boutons) and age ( p  = 0.46; Supplementary Figure  S4 ). The animal was perfused and the brainstem was sliced into 40-μm-thick sections 1 h after electroporation. We applied the same fixation time for all the slices, and no significant shrinkage was observed. To acquire high resolution  z -stack images of the calyces, a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM 700; Zeiss) equipped with krypton-argon and helium-neon lasers was used (0.5 μm steps; 63x oil immersion objective, NA 1.4). Optimized laser power, detector gain, and pinhole diameter settings were applied during image acquisition. Calyces with a signal-to-noise ratio of >15 were randomly selected ( Di Guilmi et al., 2014 ). The number of swellings per calyx was counted on 3D-rendered (Volocity 4.2; Improvision) images of calyces with adjusted contrast and brightness. The surface area and volume of the calyces were measured using the region-of-interest function in Volocity; images of calyx terminals were binary thresholded using the built-in thresholding function of ImageJ 1.46 (isodata algorithm). As a measure for the size of principal neurons, we identified the slice with the largest cross-section in image stacks and calculated the neuron’s area assuming an elliptic shape ( Sommer et al., 1993 ) using the formula: area = π ∗ a ∗ b, in which a is the length of the semi-major axis and b the length of the semi-minor axis. Analysis Electrophysiological data was analyzed with a custom written program in Igor 6.22A (WaveMetrics) NeuroMatic (version 2.00, kindly provided by Dr. J. Rothman, University College London, London, UK). The genotypes were revealed after completion of analysis. All  in vivo  recordings reported in this paper showed evidence for the presence of a prespike ( Guinan and Li, 1990 ). Complex extracellular waveforms were analyzed as described previously ( Lorteije et al., 2009 ). The first, smaller, positive deflection, which is called the prespike ( Forsythe, 1994 ), originates from the calyx of Held ( Lorteije et al., 2009 ). Its peak coincides with the maximum rate of rise of the presynaptic action potential ( Borst et al., 1995 ). The second, larger, positive deflection originates from the principal neuron. It typically consists of two parts, an early part, which is the extracellularly recorded EPSP (eEPSP) and, if the EPSP is suprathreshold, the extracellularly recorded AP (eAP;  Lorteije et al., 2009 ). Juxtacellular recordings measure local membrane currents, which consist of capacitive and resistive currents ( Freygang and Frank, 1959 ). We showed previously that the amplitude of the first component provides a good (relative) measure for the rate of rise of the intracellular EPSP, and that the same holds for its derivative (eEPSP’) and that both also provide a measure for transmitter release ( Lorteije et al., 2009 ), since postsynaptic saturation and desensitization are not an issue in the adult calyx of Held ( Yamashita et al., 2003 ;  Renden et al., 2005 ). Similarly, the peak of the eAP, which typically coincides with the maximum rate of rise of the postsynaptic AP, provides a measure for the postsynaptic excitability. Because of the difficulty of delineating the amplitude of the eEPSP from the eAP, we used the eEPSP’ as a measure for the strength of transmission, as previously described ( Wang et al., 2013 ). The absolute size of the eEPSP’ depends on experimental parameters such as seal resistance; on average it was about 10 V/s; this value did not differ significantly between mutant and its WT control for any of the four lines (Supplementary Figure  S5 ). The half width of the eAP was measured halfway between the local baseline and the peak of the eAP. It provides a measure for the duration of the fast depolarization phase. The eEPSP-eAP delay is the delay between the eEPSP’ and the eAP; it thus provides a measure for the ease at which an EPSP triggers an AP. Synaptic delay was defined as the latency between the peak of the prespike and eEPSP onset; eEPSP onset was defined as the point in time at which a line through max rate of rise point and the point at which rate of rise was half-maximal crosses the baseline level. Prespike-eAP delay, eEPSP-AP delay, and half width of the eAP were measured in spontaneous events. Event amplitudes were fitted with a simple model for STP ( Varela et al., 1997 ). In the simplest form of this model, a single depression state parameter decreases at each event with a fraction called the depletion factor (comparable to the release probability of vesicles in the readily releasable pool) and recovers continuously with a single time constant. Synaptic transmission is equal to the product of the depression state parameter and the transmission strength in the absence of STP. Data is presented as the mean ± SEM. Statistical significance of differences between means was assessed using ANOVA for the morphological differences and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), followed by (univariate) ANOVA and Student’s  t -test for the electrophysiological differences. In order to test if there was any significant finding in our data set of all four mutant groups, the MANOVA tested whether the mutants differed from their controls with respect to the measured parameters eEPSP-eAP delay, half width of eAP, spontaneous frequency, maximum evoked frequency, steady-state frequency, facilitation, amount of STD, while controlling for background strain effects. The variance–covariance matrices were not homogenous and hence Pillai’s trace was utilized to determine significance of the MANOVA. The prespike-eAP delay, time constant of depression and time constant of recovery from STD were not included in the MANOVA because these values could not be measured in many cells. Spontaneous failure percentage was also not included, since its distribution was highly skewed.",Tiantian Wang; Laura de Kok; Rob Willemsen; Ype Elgersma; J Gerard G Borst,Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,2015,10.3389/fncel.2015.00234,minimal,True
PMID:1639394,A yeast artificial chromosome contig encompassing the type 1 neurofibromatosis gene.,"The yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) system (Burke et al., 1987, Science 236: 806-812) allows the direct cloning of large regions of the genome. A YAC contig map of approximately 700 kb encompassing the region surrounding the type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF1) locus on 17q11.2 has been constructed. A single YAC containing the entire NF1 locus has been constructed by homologous recombination in yeast. In the process of contig construction a novel method of YAC end rescue has been developed by YAC circularization in yeast and plasmid rescue in bacteria. YACs containing homology to the NF1 region but mapping to another chromosome have also been discovered.

PMID:19710506,Nf1 deficiency cooperates with oncogenic K-RAS to induce acute myeloid leukemia in mice.,"Hyperactive RAS signaling is caused by mutations in RAS genes or a deficiency of the neurofibromatosis gene (NF1) and is common in myeloid malignancies. In mice, expression of oncogenic K-RAS or inactivation of Nf1 in hematopoietic cells results in myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) that do not progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Because NF1 is a RAS-GTPase-activating protein it has been proposed that NF1 deficiency is functionally equivalent to an oncogenic RAS. It is not clear, however, whether Nf1 deficiency would be redundant in K-RAS-induced MPD development or whether the 2 mutations would cooperate in leukemogenesis. Here, we show that the simultaneous inactivation of Nf1 and expression of K-RAS(G12D) in mouse hematopoietic cells results in AML that was fatal in primary mice within 4 weeks and transplantable to sublethally irradiated secondary recipients. The data point to a strong cooperation between Nf1 deficiency and oncogenic K-RAS.",,Briony A Cutts; Anna-Karin M Sjogren; Karin M E Andersson; Annika M Wahlstrom; Christin Karlsson; Birgitta Swolin; Martin O Bergo,Blood,2009-10-22,10.1182/blood-2009-02-205146,abstract_only,False
PMID:38203448,FT895 Impairs Mitochondrial Function in Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor Cells.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) stands as a prevalent neurocutaneous disorder. Approximately a quarter of NF1 patients experience the development of plexiform neurofibromas, potentially progressing into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). FT895, an HDAC11 inhibitor, exhibits potent anti-tumor effects on MPNST cells and enhances the cytotoxicity of cordycepin against MPNST. The study aims to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying FT895's efficacy against MPNST cells. Initially, our study unveiled that FT895 disrupts mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Post-FT895 treatment, reactive oxygen species (ROS) in MPNST notably increased, while mitochondrial DNA copy numbers decreased significantly. Seahorse analysis indicated a considerable decrease in basal, maximal, and ATP-production-coupled respiration following FT895 treatment. Immunostaining highlighted FT895's role in promoting mitochondrial aggregation without triggering mitophagy, possibly due to reduced levels of XBP1, Parkin, and PINK1 proteins. Moreover, the study using CHIP-qPCR analysis revealed a significant reduction in the copy numbers of promoters of the MPV17L2, POLG, TFAM, PINK1, and Parkin genes. The RNA-seq analysis underscored the prominent role of the HIF-1α signaling pathway post-FT895 treatment, aligning with the observed impairment in mitochondrial respiration. In summary, the study pioneers the revelation that FT895 induces mitochondrial respiratory damage in MPNST cells.","4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Cell Culture The S462TY cell line was a kind gift from Dr. Timothy Cripe (Nationwide Children’s Hospital Columbus, Columbus, OH, USA) [ 43 ]. The MPNST cell lines STS26T, T265, and ST8814 have been reported before [ 44 ] and were gifted by Dr. Nancy Ratner (Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, Cincinnati, OH, USA). The cultures were supplemented with DMEM and 10% fetal bovine serum in a humid incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 . All MPNST cell lines, except STS26T, were derived from NF1 patients. STS26T is a sporadic MPNST with no known NF1 mutation [ 45 ]. Normal human Schwann cells (HSC) (ScienCell Research Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were grown on the poly-L-lysine-coated tissue culture plates. 4.2. Reactive Oxygen Species Detection To identify the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), a cell-permeable fluorescent probe, oxidized 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) (Sigma-Aldrich, Taipei, Taiwan), was used as a fluorescent ROS probe. MPNST cells treated with DMSO or 10 μM of FT895 for 24 h were loaded with 1 μM DCFDA and incubated for 20 min. The fluorescent signal of oxidized DCFDA was excited by a 488 nm laser and detected by the FITC channel in FACSverse Flow Cytometry (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). The data were analyzed by v10.8 of FlowJo™ software. 4.3. Mitochondrial DNA Copy Number Genomic DNA was extracted using the Genomic DNA Kit (Geneaid Biotech Ltd., Taoyuan, Taiwan) and quantified with SpectraMax ®  i3x (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). The relative DNA copy number (mitochondrial DNA to nuclear DNA) of three mitochondrial genes, ND2, ND4L, and nuclear GAPDH, was measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). The primer sets are listed as follows: ND2 forward: CATATACCAAATCTCTCCCTC, ND2 reverse: GTGCGAGATAGTAGTAGGGTC; ND4L forward: TAGTATATCGCTCACACCTC, ND4L reverse: GTAGTCTAGGCCATATGTG; GAPDH forward: GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC, GAPDH reverse: GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC. The mitochondrial copy number (mtCN) was quantified using the delta CT (ΔCT) of mtDNA and nuclear DNA (ΔCt = CT [mtDNA] − CT [GAPDH]). The fold change was calculated by 2 −ΔΔCT . ΔΔCT was determined by ΔCT [FT895 treated] − ΔCT [DMSO control]. 4.4. Metabolism Assay MPNST cells were plated in a Seahorse XFe24 microplate (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and allowed to adhere overnight. An XFe24 FluxPack sensor cartridge (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) is equilibrated in XF Calibrant at 37 °C overnight. Before performing the assay, cells were washed twice in a standard XF DMEM medium supplemented with pyruvate, glutamine, and glucose. Cells were then incubated in 675 μL of XF DMEM media for one hour at 37 °C with atmospheric CO 2 . The Mito Stress assay was run as described in the test kit protocol (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with 1 μM oligomycin and 0.5 μM rotenone/antimycin A. The concentration of carbonyl cyanide-4 (trifluoromethoxy)-phenylhydrazone (FCCP) for each MPNST cell line was 1 μM for S462TY, 1.5 μM for STS26T, and 2 μM for T265 and ST8814 cells. The data were collected to determine the changes in oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). The analysis was performed with Seahorse Wave Pro software (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA,  https://www.agilent.com.cn/zh-cn/product/cell-analysis/real-time-cell-metabolic-analysis/xf-software/software-download-for-seahorse-wave-pro-software , accessed on 19 December 2023). 4.5. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay and Quantitative PCR The ChIP assay was performed following the manufacturer’s instructions for the Pierce Magnetic ChIP Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). In brief, the chromatin extracted from the control and treated cells was digested with MNase and sheared by sonication to a size of less than 400 bp. The fragments were centrifuged (9000×  g ) at 4 °C for 5 min. Ten percent of the diluted supernatant (input) was collected and served as the control template. The sheared chromatin was immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of anti-XBP1 antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) overnight. Magnetic beads and a magnetic separation device (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were employed to pull down the protein/DNA complexes from the crude chromatin mixture. After elution, the DNA from immunoprecipitated samples and the inputs were recovered by phenol/chloroform. The input DNA and antibody-bound chromatin DNA were then subjected to quantitative PCR to quantify the DNA copy number. The primers to amplify the promoter region of the  POLG ,  MPV17L2 ,  NOTCH2 ,  PINK1 ,  PARK2  (encodes Parkin),  PPARGC1A  (encodes PGC1α), and  TFAM  genes were designed. The primer sequences are as follows:  POLG  forward: CAATCT CGCAGGGACTTGCT,  POLG  reverse: CAATGTGAACGTAGTCGCCG;  MPV17L2  forward: CCCATAGGCTGGCACAGAAA,  MPV17L2  reverse: GGCGTTCTATCCCAAGGTCG;  PINK1  forward: GGCAAGCTGCTATCTTGGGA,  PINK1  reverse: CTCAATGCCGTTAGGCTGCT;  PARK2  forward: CCTTGGCTAGAGCTGCAACA,  PARK2  reverse: TCAGGCCCAGCAATCTTACG;  PPARGC1A  forward: CGTCACGAGTTAGAGCAGCA,  PPARGC1A  reverse: TCCCCAGTCACATGACAAAGC;  TFAM  forward: TTAGGTTTGCGAATCCCCGC,  TFAM  reverse: CGTAACAGACAGTCCTGCATCC. The primer set used to quantify the mRNA level of  SLC2A1  encoding GLUT1 and housekeeping gene  GAPDH  are as follows:  SLC2A1  forward: CTGGCATCAACGCTGTCTTC,  SLC2A1  reverse: GTTGACGATACCGGAGCCAA;  GAPDH  forward: ACCCACTCCTCCACCTTTGA,  GAPDH  reverse: CTGTTGCTGTAGCCAAATTCGT. 4.6. Western Blot Equal amounts of the protein lysate from control and treated cells were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to a PVDF membrane. After blocking with 5% skim milk for one hour at room temperature, the membrane was probed with the specific primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. The primary antibodies used in the study include anti-GAPDH (Proteintech Group Inc., Rosemont, IL, USA), anti-α-tubulin (Proteintech Group Inc., Rosemont, IL, USA), anti-XBP1u (Abcepta, Reservoir Victoria, Australia), anti-XBP1s (Cell Signaling), anti-Parkin (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), anti-PINK1 (Genetex, Hsinchu, Taiwan), anti-LC3B (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), and anti-GLUT1 (Proteintech Group Inc., Rosemont, IL, USA) antibodies. Then, the membranes were washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 to remove unbound antibodies. The membrane was then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for two hours. The protein signals were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence method, and the snapshot images were captured by the UVP BioSpectrum 810 Imaging System (UVP, Cambridge, UK). 4.7. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy Cells were grown on Ibid tissue culture dishes (IB-81156, Ibidi, Gräfelfing, Germany) overnight and were treated with FT895 for 24 h. Treated cells were washed with PBS twice and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature (RT) for one minute, followed by fixing with cold methanol at −20 °C for 20 min. The fixed cells were blocked with PBS containing 5% fetal bovine serum for one hour at RT. For immunostaining, the primary antibodies, anti-ATP5H (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and anti-LC3 antibodies (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), were added into the wells and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The cell nuclei were stained with DAPI for 10 min at RT, and the cells were mounted using a mounting medium for microscopy. The confocal images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 880 (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). 4.8. Bulk RNA-Seq Analysis Total RNAs were isolated from the S462TY cells both with and without 6 h treatment with 10 µM FT895 by the phenol/chloroform extraction method. RNA libraries were prepared by the Illumina Truseq Stranded mRNA Kit. RNA sequencing was carried out on a NovaSeq 6000 system, and the read quality was checked with FASTQC. To align the reads, we employed HISAT2 version 2.2.1 [ 46 ] against the GRCh38 human genome. Read counts were normalized by StringTie version 2.2.1 [ 47 ]. Differential expression analysis was analyzed by DEGseq version 1.48.0 ( https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/manuals/DEGseq/man/DEGseq.pdf , accessed on 19 November 2023). For the examination of transcriptional gene set enrichment, the GSEA KEGG method with ClusterProfiler version 4.2.2 [ 48 ] was applied. We also conducted protein–protein interaction analysis using STRING version 11.5 ( https://string-db.org/ , accessed on 19 November 2023). 4.9. Statistics and Data Analysis All the experimental values were presented as the mean ± SEM (standard error of the mean). The analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 9. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student’s  t -test. A  p -value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.",Po-Yuan Huang; I-An Shih; Ying-Chih Liao; Huey-Ling You; Ming-Jen Lee,International journal of molecular sciences,2023-12-24,10.3390/ijms25010277,minimal,True
PMID:39409151,Proof of Concept for Genome Profiling of the Neurofibroma/Sarcoma Sequence in Neurofibromatosis Type 1.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by the predisposition to develop tumors such as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) which represents the primary cause of death for NF1-affected patients. Regardless of the high incidence and mortality, the molecular mechanisms underneath MPNST growth and metastatic progression remain poorly understood. In this proof-of-concept study, we performed somatic whole-exome sequencing (WES) to profile the genomic alterations in four samples from a patient with NF1-associated MPNST, consisting of a benign plexiform neurofibroma, a primary MPNST, and metastases from lung and skin tissues. By comparing genomic patterns, we identified a high level of variability across samples with distinctive genetic changes which allow for the definition of profiles of the early phase with respect to the late metastatic stages. Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants were abundant in the primary tumor, whereas the metastatic samples exhibited a high level of copy-number variations (CNVs), highlighting a possible genomic instability in the late phases. The most known MPNST-related genes, such as ","4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Sample Collection and DNA Extraction Four samples were collected from the same patient, including three tumor samples (a primary tumor, a lung metastasis and a skin metastasis) and one benign sample (selected from the benign area of plexiform neurofibroma). The gDNA was purified starting from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples obtained at surgical resection, using the Magcore DNA FFPE One-Step Kit (Code 405). Fragmented gDNAs were tested for size distribution and concentration using an Agilent Tapestation 4200 and Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity kit. 4.2. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) The NGS library was executed using the Agilent Sure Select XT HS2 all exon v8 kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), following the manufacturer’s instructions. For samples with a low DNA Integrity Number (DIN), the first fragmentation step has been optimized by reducing the enzyme fragmentation time. The samples were then sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq550Dx, which generated paired-end reads of 151 bp. 4.3. Sequencing Data Analysis Candidate somatic variants, consisting of point mutations, insertions, and deletions were sorted out with Varsome Clinical Software v.12.3.2 (Saphetor, Lausanne, Switzerland). Briefly, an alignment filter was pursued to exclude quality failed reads, unpaired reads, and poorly mapped reads in the tumor. A base quality check was used to limit inclusion of bases with reported Phred quality score > 30 for the tumor and >20 for the normal. The variant calling was performed by comparing each tumor sample with the benign specimen (match tumor–normal) using default parameters (Reference genome: GRCh38/hg38). The final output is thus characterized by a VCF file in which variants in common for the benign and tumor samples have been filtered out (such as germinal variants or sequencing errors) and only somatic variants of the tumor have been selected. Candidate somatic changes were further filtered, based on gene annotation, to determine those lying in protein-coding regions. Functional consequences were predicted using the Varsome Clinical software v.12.3.2 (Saphetor, Lausanne, Switzerland) tertiary analysis tool, examining data from public databases such as 1000 Genomes, dbSNP, COSMIC, and ClinVar. Relevant somatic variants have been prioritized according to the pathogenicity score or the druggable classification in Tier, based on ACMG/AMP criteria ( Supplementary Table S1 ) [ 54 ]. Finally, intronic and silent variants were excluded, while mutations resulting in missense mutations, nonsense mutations, frameshifts, or splice-site alterations were kept. A manual visual inspection phase was utilized to further remove artifactual alterations. The VAF plot was generated using Plotly v4.9.3 in the R environment (available from  https://plotly-r.com ). CNVs were identified and analyzed using Varsome Clinical software v.12.3.2 with default parameters. Finally, to determine the profiles of the alterations in the number of copies, the CNV calling was also performed using the CNVKit version 0.9.11 [ 55 ]. The output was then visualized using ggplot2 v3.5.1 [ 56 ] ( https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org ). 4.4. Driver-Gene Identification and Kaplan—Meier Analysis We downloaded data from the TCGA-SARC from Genomic Data Commons (GDC Data Portal) ( https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/ ) and the dataset relative to nerve sheath tumor from the cBio Cancer Genomics Portal ( https://www.cbioportal.org/ ) to identify potential driver genes. Both GDC Data Portal and cBio Portal are open-access resources for interactive exploration of multidimensional cancer genomic datasets, currently providing access to data from different cancer samples [ 57 , 58 ]. The list of genes in the literature was created by conducting a bibliographical search on PubMed, using the MESH terms “MPNST” and “NF1”. Papers mentioning the most frequently mutated genes were selected; in addition, extensive research was carried out on the  Supplementary Materials  to assess further genes whose variants could have a significant impact on MPNST and that were not mentioned in the main text of the articles. When this information was not available, we downloaded the available raw data from public repositories) and applied the same analytical pipeline that was used with our samples [ 19 , 20 , 21 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 ]. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated using GEPIA ( http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/ ) on the TCGA-SARC, TCGA-LUAD and TCGA-LUSC RNA-seq expression dataset, with two-tailed 95% confidence intervals [ 59 ]. 4.5. Enrichment and Pathway Analysis Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis was performed using Cluster Profiler v.4.0 [ 60 ], selecting statistically significant terms and pathways ( p -value < 0.05). The plots of pathways and enrichment were visualized by R ggplot2 package v.3.5.1 [ 56 ] ( https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org ). Visualization of intersecting sets was performed with UpSetR Version 1.4.0 (R package) [ 61 ].",Ilenia Rita Cannizzaro; Mirko Treccani; Antonietta Taiani; Enrico Ambrosini; Sabrina Busciglio; Sofia Cesarini; Anita Luberto; Erika De Sensi; Barbara Moschella; Pierpacifico Gismondi; Cinzia Azzoni; Lorena Bottarelli; Giovanna Giordano; Domenico Corradi; Enrico Maria Silini; Valentina Zanatta; Federica Cennamo; Patrizia Bertolini; Patrizia Caggiati; Davide Martorana; Vera Uliana; Antonio Percesepe; Valeria Barili,International journal of molecular sciences,2024-10-09,10.3390/ijms251910822,minimal,True

PMID:7671302,Loss of neurofibromin results in neurotrophin-independent survival of embryonic sensory and sympathetic neurons.,"Mutations at the neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) locus in humans and mice result in abnormal growth of neural crest-derived cells, including melanocytes and Schwann cells. We have exploited a targeted disruption of the NF1 gene in mice to examine the role of neurofibromin in the acquisition of neurotrophin dependence in embryonic neurons. We show that both neural crest- and placode-derived sensory neurons isolated from NF1(-/-) embryos develop, extend neurites, and survive in the absence of neurotrophins, whereas their wild-type counterparts die rapidly unless nerve growth factor (NGF) or brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is added to the culture medium. Moreover, NF1 (-/-) sympathetic neurons survive for extended periods and acquire mature morphology in the presence of NGF-blocking antibodies.

PMID:39965929,Neurofibromin Deficiency Alters the Patterning and Prioritization of Motor Behaviors in a State-Dependent Manner.,"Genetic disorders such as neurofibromatosis type 1 (Nf1) increase vulnerability to cognitive and behavioral disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Nf1 results from mutations in the neurofibromin gene that can reduce levels of the neurofibromin protein. While the mechanisms have yet to be fully elucidated, loss of Nf1 may alter neuronal circuit activity leading to changes in behavior and susceptibility to cognitive and behavioral comorbidities. Here we show that mutations decreasing Nf1 expression alter motor behaviors, impacting the patterning, prioritization, and behavioral state dependence in a ",,Genesis Omana Suarez; Divya S Kumar; Hannah Brunner; Anneke Knauss; Jenifer Barrios; Jalen Emel; Jensen Teel; Valentina Botero; Connor N Broyles; Aaron Stahl; Salil S Bidaye; Seth M Tomchik,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2025-04-16,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1531-24.2025,abstract_only,False
PMID:28735371,Identifying Symptoms of Distress in Youth Living with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1).,"Children and adolescents with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are at increased risk for wide-ranging behavioral, developmental, and cognitive impairments and decreased quality of life. To date, no psychosocial screening tool has been developed to quickly assess the symptoms that 1) can be addressed during routine medical appointments in children with NF1, 2) can produce interpretable and actionable results, 3) can be integrated into medical care, and 4) can quickly identify patients at risk in order to better address that the provision of appropriate care are available. This study was conducted to test the overall usability of the Distress Thermometer (DT) and symptom checklist and concordance of DT ratings between pediatric patients, their caregivers and medical providers. Eighty youth (ages 7-21) living with NF1 completed the DT and an accompanying checklist. The findings of this study suggest the DT and symptom checklist was acceptable and feasible to complete in a clinic setting. A small subset reported high distress that required further assessment and intervention. Significant discordance between distress ratings of caregivers and children and healthcare providers was also found. Overall, the DT and accompanying symptom checklist provide important information to identify the presence of distress and contextualize the child's distress but is limited by not assessing whether these symptoms interfere with the child's daily life.","Methods: Patients, ages 7–21 years old, were recruited as part of a larger study on distress screening of outpatients with serious medical illness from one of 5 clinics in two institutions; methods for the larger study have been previously described ( Wiener et al., 2015 ). Eighty patient participants from the larger sample had a diagnosis of NF-1 and are reported here. Participants were divided into three age categories: 7 to 12, 13–17 and 18–21 and measures were administered accordingly. Additional inclusion criteria included availability of a parent/guardian to participate, and the ability to speak English (primary outcome measure is not yet available in other languages). Exclusion criteria included the presence of psychotic symptoms or cognitive impairment, which in the judgment of the Principal or Associate Investigator, or consulting psychiatrist, would compromise the patient’s ability to accurately complete the measures. This study was approved by the Combined Neuroscience Institutional Review Board at the National Institute of Mental Health. Measures The Distress Thermometer (DT) was designed as a brief screening tool to assess for distress in adult cancer patients (NCCN, 2015) and has been recognized as a good alternative to many of the longer measures commonly used to screen for distress in cancer patients ( Jacobsen, 2005 ).  Patel et al. (2011)  conducted a study that investigated the validity and utility of an adapted DT to screen for distress in a pediatric oncology inpatient setting. Convergent validity was demonstrated by reasonable agreement between the pediatric distress rating tool and standardized pediatric measures ( Patel et al., 2011 ); the adapted pediatric DT was used in this study for all ages. Another study described patients, aged 9–18 years with sarcoma, which found the pediatric DT to be feasible and acceptable to young people to complete screening measures during a clinic visit .  ( Weiner, 2015 ). Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI-S and CDI-P) The CDI–S ( Kovacs, 1992 ) is a 10-item self-report measure for depression in children, ages 7 to 17 years. The CDI is widely used, reliable and valid. It has been noted to have a bias towards cognitive symptoms ( Shemesh et al., 2005 ) and has few questions on physical symptoms, potentially making it more appropriate for children with medical illness whose illness symptoms can be confounded with physical manifestations of depression ( Shemesh et al., 2005 ). The CDI was completed by all patients ages 7–17. The CDI Parent Version (CDI-P) is derived directly from the CDI, is scored identically and has similar psychometric properties ( Kovacs, 1992 ). The CDI-P was completed by caregivers of all patients, ages 7–21. The Brief Symptom Inventory 18 (BSI-18) The BSI-18 ( Derogatis et al., 2004 ) is an 18-item self-report measure to screen for psychological distress and psychiatric disorders in individuals in the community or hospital settings. The BSI-18 assesses three dimensions of emotional functioning, depression, anxiety, and somatization. The Global Severity Index (GSI) is a measure of symptom severity. An individual is designated as meeting criteria for “caseness” on the BSI if they have a GSI score greater than or equal to a T-score of 63 or they meet “case” criteria on at least 2 subscales. Since the CDI-S was only designed for patients up to age 17, patients ages 18–21 were administered the Depression dimension of the BSI-18 (6 items). Caregivers were administered all 18 items on themselves. The BSI-18 has excellent psychometric properties ( Zabora et al., 1990 ). Lansky and Karnofsky Scores: Medical providers completed a Lansky score for patients 17 years and younger and a Karnofsky score for patients 18 years and older. These scores indicate the disease severity and functional capabilities of the patient ( Lansky et al., 1987 ;  Mor et al., 1984 ) and were obtained in order to assess the disease severity of the patients completing the DT. Lansky and Karnofsky scores range from 0–100 in increments of 10, with 0 indicating unresponsiveness/death to 100 indicating perfect health. Distress Thermometer Acceptability and Feasibility Scales Acceptability: Patients, primary caregivers, and the child’s primary medical provider rated on a scale of 1–4 how easy or difficult the DT was to complete during an outpatient visit and also indicated, on a three point scale, to what extent completing the DT bothered them. Feasibility: After each administration of the DT to patients and caregivers, the data collector recorded how feasible the DT was to administer on a four-point scale. The DT Acceptability and Feasibility Scales were developed by the study investigators for the purpose of this study. Other: Additional instruments to assess anxiety, pain and fatigue were given in order to validate the DT; summary validation results included patients with NF and are described in  Wiener et al., 2015 . Procedure All data collection was completed in a single clinic visit. After reviewing and signing the assent (children ages 7–17) and consent (ages 18–21), each patient was given a self-administered Distress Thermometer (DT), either the Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI) or the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-depression items), the DT Acceptability Scale, as well as other measures not reported in this study, by one of the investigators or trained data collectors. Parents also consented to the study for their minor children and themselves, and completed the DT (on the child), parent versions of the CDI (CDI-P), the DT Acceptability Scale and other measures not reported in this study. In addition, caregivers completed the BSI-18 about their own psychological symptoms. Patient and caregiver data were collected simultaneously but separately and each took 30 minutes or less. Primary medical providers (physicians or nurse practitioner) completed the DT, giving their estimation of the patient’s distress on the same day the patient and primary caregiver completed the measure. Medical providers completed the DT Acceptability Scale and the Lansky-Karnofsky scales. Data collectors completed the DT Feasibility Scale after each administration of the DT.",Lori Wiener; Haven Battles; Sima Zadeh Bedoya; Andrea Baldwin; Brigitte C Widemann; Maryland Pao,Journal of genetic counseling,2018-02,10.1007/s10897-017-0128-1,minimal,True
PMID:33484105,Circulating free DNA in the plasma of individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant syndrome whose characteristic manifestations include benign neurofibromas, yet NF1 is also associated with a high risk of cancer. Measurements of circulating free plasma DNA (cfDNA) are gaining wider applicability in cancer diagnostics, targeting of therapy, and monitoring of therapeutic response. Individuals with NF1 are likely to be followed up using this method, but the effects of NF1 and neurofibromas on cfDNA levels are not known. We studied peripheral blood samples from 19 adults with NF1 and 12 healthy controls. The cfDNA was isolated from plasma with QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit and quantified using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer. The cfDNA concentration of each sample was normalized relative to the plasma protein concentration. The normalized median concentration of cfDNA in plasma was 19.3 ng/ml (range 6.6-78.6) among individuals with NF1 and 15.9 ng/ml (range 4.8-47.0) among controls (p = .369). Individuals with NF1 who also had plexiform neurofibroma (pNF) showed non-significantly elevated cfDNA concentration compared to individuals with NF1 and without known pNF (median 25.4 vs. 18.8 ng/ml, p = .122). The effect of NF1 on cfDNA seems to be relatively small and NF1 is therefore unlikely to hamper the use of cfDNA-based assays.",,Roope A Kallionpää; Kaisa Ahramo; Marianna Aaltonen; Paula Pennanen; Juha Peltonen; Sirkku Peltonen,American journal of medical genetics.

PMID:39845289,Evaluating dimensionality reduction of comorbidities for predictive modeling in individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1.,"OBJECTIVE: Dimensionality reduction techniques aim to enhance the performance of machine learning (ML) models by reducing noise and mitigating overfitting. We sought to compare the effect of different dimensionality reduction methods for comorbidity features extracted from electronic health records (EHRs) on the performance of ML models for predicting the development of various sub-phenotypes in children with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). MATERIALS AND METHODS: EHR-derived data from pediatric subjects with a confirmed clinical diagnosis of NF1 were used to create 10 unique comorbidities code-derived feature sets by incorporating dimensionality reduction techniques using raw International Classification of Diseases codes, Clinical Classifications Software Refined, and Phecode mapping schemes. We compared the performance of logistic regression, XGBoost, and random forest models utilizing each feature set. RESULTS: XGBoost-based predictive models were most successful at predicting NF1 sub-phenotypes. Overall, features based on domain knowledge-informed mapping schema performed better than unsupervised feature reduction methods. High-level features exhibited the worst performance across models and outcomes, suggesting excessive information loss with over-aggregation of features. DISCUSSION: Model performance is significantly impacted by dimensionality reduction techniques and varies by specific ML algorithm and outcome being predicted. Automated methods using existing knowledge and ontology databases can effectively aggregate features extracted from EHRs. CONCLUSION: Dimensionality reduction through feature aggregation can enhance the performance of ML models, particularly in high-dimensional datasets with small sample sizes, commonly found in EHRs health applications. However, if not carefully optimized, it can lead to information loss and data oversimplification, potentially adversely affecting model performance.","Materials and Methods EHR-derived data from pediatric subjects with a confirmed clinical diagnosis of NF1 were used to create 10 unique comorbidities code-derived feature sets by incorporating dimensionality reduction techniques using raw International Classification of Diseases codes, Clinical Classifications Software Refined, and Phecode mapping schemes. We compared the performance of logistic regression, XGBoost, and random forest models utilizing each feature set. Materials and methods With the approval of the Washington University Institutional Review Board (protocol #201706112), EHR data were extracted from the Research Data Core at Washington University School of Medicine, a data lake containing retrospective clinical records from Washington University Medicine and BJC Healthcare, including those from Barnes-Jewish Hospital and St Louis Children’s Hospital. All subjects were younger than 18 and had a confirmed clinical diagnosis of NF1 (ICD10-CM code Q85.01). The extracted data included features from structured data, comprising all diagnosed ICD10-CM codes within the cohort and demographic information. We created 10 datasets for comparison, keeping sex and race constant across each while varying the ICD-10-CM-derived features by using different feature reduction and aggregation methods to modify the diagnoses and group them into their clinical context-based feature sets ( Figure 1 ). To ensure that the results were not phenotype-specific, three different sub-phenotypes (OPG, ADHD, and scoliosis) were chosen for analysis. Importantly, while measures have been taken to ensure that the results are as unbiased and accurate as possible, the resulting predictive models and results were not evaluated for clinical accuracy. Figure 1. ICD10-CM feature aggregation and reduction workflow.  Graphical representation of the various feature aggregation and reductions that result from ICD10-CM diagnoses. Data inclusion for predictive modeling Individuals diagnosed with OPG, ADHD, or scoliosis were identified using ICD10-CM codes. Physician-experts in the field of NF1 (S.M.M. and D.H.G.) curated a list of ICD10-CM codes for each of the 3 conditions ( Table S1 ). Unique feature sets were created for training and evaluating the predictive models for OPG, ADHD, and scoliosis. For each of these conditions, individuals who were not diagnosed with the condition within the timeframe of the extracted data had their full available diagnosis history used to determine the presence or absence of each of the ICD10-CM diagnoses present in the study cohort. Individuals diagnosed with a condition had only their diagnosis history included in training the prediction model until their diagnosis was rendered. The datasets were constructed in this way to prevent leakage of the outcome variables into the dataset used for prediction. Diagnosis feature aggregation and reduction Various dimensionality reduction methods created 10 total feature sets. Seven were built using methods including aggregating features based on ICD10-CM coding hierarchies, mappings that group together hierarchical ICD10-CM codes, and prevalence-based filtering to keep the most common comorbidities. The remaining 3 feature sets were generated using unsupervised clustering and PCA techniques. ( Table 1 ; further described below). Table 1. Feature set names, descriptions, and  N  features.

Feature sets using ICD-based methods The base dataset (ICD10-1) included all 2982 unique ICD-10-CM codes within the cohort represented as binary variables. We used Phecode and CCSR, aggregation and reduction methods that group ICD-10 codes into standardized, clinically meaningful concepts  ( 5–8 Table 1 ). Phecode and CCSR map codes into concepts, or features, by aggregating codes that are clinically similar. Each has different hierarchies that aggregate and reduce the feature space in different ways. Feature sets using clustering and PCA methods Each of these feature sets was created using a different method, namely k-means clustering,  hierarchical clustering, and PCA 17  ( 18 Table 1 ). The matrix for clustering was a square matrix [2982*2982], holding the counts of every pairwise set of ICD10-CM codes in our cohort. In this matrix, cell  C i ,     contains the number of individuals that have cooccurring diagnoses of both  j i  and  j  ICD10-CM codes. For k-means and hierarchical clustering, the elbow method was used to determine the optimal k clusters, where each cluster contains diagnoses that frequently co-occur in individuals in our cohort. Yellowbrick, a ML visualization library, was used for this purpose.  For k-means clustering, we used the Lloyd algorithm with K-Means++ centroid initialization, which samples and assigns initial centroids based on the maximum squared distance from each other. Hierarchical clustering used Euclidean distance and Ward linkage. For PCA, we set a threshold of 95% variance explained to select the number of principal components to use ( 19 N  = 98). ML models The effect of the different feature sets on predictive modeling was evaluated using 3 different algorithms: logistic regression,  random forest, 20  and XGBoost. 21  Model selection and hyperparameter tuning were done using nested cross-validation and randomized search with 100 parameter space samples for each inner fold. From this, 5 parameter sets were generated—one for each top-performing model from each outer fold was returned. The highest performing parameter set according to F1-score was selected as the final parameter set and evaluated by averaging performance over a series of 5-fold cross-validation iterations. The splits were kept the same across models and datasets to ensure an unbiased comparison of performances. The evaluation metrics were area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), average precision, and F1 score. 22 Additionally, when mapping to different feature sets, specific ICD10-CM codes were filtered out to prevent leakage of the outcome variable into the set of predictor variables. All feature sets were created by starting with the base ICD10-CM dataset (ICD10-1), removing the ICD10-CM codes corresponding specifically to the outcome variable, then mapping the remaining codes to each different feature set. For example, a feature in Phecode Expanded named “Cancer of brain and nervous system” encompassed diagnoses related to brain and nervous system cancers, including several codes used to identify OPG subjects in our cohort. To keep this feature in the model, those codes used to identify subjects with OPG in our data were removed before mapping so they did not leak into the dataset. Similarly, for the ICD10-1 and ICD10-2 OPG, ADHD, and scoliosis datasets, the identifying codes for these sub-phenotypes were removed from their respective feature space. Statistical analysis Statistical testing was conducted to compare the performance between feature sets. Friedman’s test, a nonparametric test of repeated measures, is commonly used for comparing multiple classifiers over multiple datasets.  More specifically, Friedman’s test is appropriate in situations where the independent variable is binary, there are evaluation metrics from multiple testing sets, and more than 2 models are being compared. These conditions apply to our study. The post hoc test selected was the Conover test, which is commonly used to perform pairwise comparisons following Friedman’s test. 23 24 Initially, we used Friedman’s test to compare AUROC values from each feature set across different conditions and models. Subsequently, the Conover test, with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, was performed to identify statistically significant pairwise differences. A significance threshold of 0.05 was used for all tests. Feature importance analysis We analyzed the most important features of the various feature sets to determine, for each outcome variable, whether the most critical features of the feature space are similar across feature sets. This similarity was quantified by the number of features shared by the top 10 most important features of each feature set as identified by XGBoost. However, it is challenging to perform these comparisons for feature sets derived by grouping ICD10-CM codes (including everything except for ICD10-CM Base [ICD10-1] and ICD10-CM Selected [ICD10-2]). For this reason, the top 10 features of ICD10-CM Base were chosen as the baseline against which the 9 other feature sets were compared instead of comparing all pairwise combinations of the ten feature sets. For the feature sets that grouped ICD10-CM codes into higher-level features, a feature was counted as shared if the feature encompasses at least 1 code from the top 10 features of ICD10-1. For example, if 1 of ICD10-1’s 10 most important features for a prediction was “A01.1,” and 1 of CCSR’ 10 most important features was titled “Example Feature,” which was made up of codes “A01.1,” “B01.1,” and “C01.1.” Since this CCSR feature included “A01.1,” then this was counted as a shared feature. The total number of shared features between ICD10-1 and CCSR would be the number of times this occurs out of ten, since only the top ten most important features were analyzed. For ICD10-2, the only other feature set with singular ICD10-CM codes as features and did not group, a feature was counted as shared if the same code from ICD10-1 was present in ICD10-2. In this manner, the total number of shared features between ICD10-1 and ICD10-2 was equivalent to the intersection of their top 10 most important features. For PCA, feature overlap must be handled differently because the ICD10-CM codes that define the components are not mutually exclusive. As a result, feature overlap considers only the top 10 ICD10-CM codes by magnitude of coefficient of linear combination for each component. HoloViews, a data analysis and visualization library, was used to generate the shared feature plots. 25 Feature sets using ICD-based methods The base dataset (ICD10-1) included all 2982 unique ICD-10-CM codes within the cohort represented as binary variables. We used Phecode and CCSR, aggregation and reduction methods that group ICD-10 codes into standardized, clinically meaningful concepts  ( 5–8 Table 1 ). Phecode and CCSR map codes into concepts, or features, by aggregating codes that are clinically similar. Each has different hierarchies that aggregate and reduce the feature space in different ways.

PMID:32948135,Anti-cancer agent 3-bromopyruvate reduces growth of MPNST and inhibits metabolic pathways in a representative in-vitro model.,"BACKGROUND: Anticancer compound 3-bromopyruvate (3-BrPA) suppresses cancer cell growth via targeting glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism. The malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), a very aggressive, therapy resistant, and Neurofibromatosis type 1 associated neoplasia, shows a high metabolic activity and affected patients may therefore benefit from 3-BrPA treatment. To elucidate the specific mode of action, we used a controlled cell model overexpressing proteasome activator (PA) 28, subsequently leading to p53 inactivation and oncogenic transformation and therefore reproducing an important pathway in MPNST and overall tumor pathogenesis. METHODS: Viability of MPNST cell lines S462, NSF1, and T265 in response to increasing doses (0-120 μM) of 3-BrPA was analyzed by CellTiter-Blue® assay. Additionally, we investigated viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (dihydroethidium assay), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase activity (NADH-TR assay) and lactate production (lactate assay) in mouse B8 fibroblasts overexpressing PA28 in response to 3-BrPA application. For all experiments normal and nutrient deficient conditions were tested. MPNST cell lines were furthermore characterized immunohistochemically for Ki67, p53, bcl2, bcl6, cyclin D1, and p21. RESULTS: MPNST significantly responded dose dependent to 3-BrPA application, whereby S462 cells were most responsive. Human control cells showed a reduced sensitivity. In PA28 overexpressing cancer cell model 3-BrPA application harmed mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase activity mildly and significantly failed to inhibit lactate production. PA28 overexpression was associated with a functional glycolysis as well as a partial resistance to stress provoked by nutrient deprivation. 3-BrPA treatment was not associated with an increase of ROS. Starvation sensitized MPNST to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive MPNST cells are sensitive to 3-BrPA therapy in-vitro with and without starvation. In a PA28 overexpression cancer cell model leading to p53 inactivation, thereby reflecting a key molecular feature in human NF1 associated MPNST, known functions of 3-BrPA to block mitochondrial activity and glycolysis were reproduced, however oncogenic cells displayed a partial resistance. To conclude, 3-BrPA was sufficient to reduce NF1 associated MPNST viability potentially due inhibition of glycolysis which should lead to the initiation of further studies and promises a potential benefit for NF1 patients.","Methods Viability of MPNST cell lines S462, NSF1, and T265 in response to increasing doses (0–120 μM) of 3-BrPA was analyzed by CellTiter-Blue® assay.

Methods Cell lines, cell culture, and chemicals Human MPNST cell lines (S462, T265, and NSF1) were analyzed and have been described in detail in our previous studies [ 16 – 20 ]. NSF1 cells were kindly provided by Dieter Kaufmann (University Hospital Ulm, Germany). Cells were pre-cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, ThermoFisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. Triplicates of 8 × 10 3  cells were seeded in 100 μL media in a 96 well format and incubated for 24 h prior to 3-BrPA (Sigma Aldrich, Merck) treatment. Then, 3-BrPA was added and cells incubated for additional 24 h. For drug treatment, phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) was used to dilute 3-BrPA (10 μl of 0–1200 μM stock concentration with 100 μL media per well) to a final concentration of 0–120 μM. Dose application was according to literature describing doses in a range of 10 to 5000 μM applicated to tumor cells in culture [ 21 ]. Mouse fibroblast B8 cells (kindly provided by Ralf Stohwasser, Brandenburg Technical University Cottbus-Senftenberg) which were stably transfected with plasmid pSG5 vector and encoding PSME3 cDNA harbor PA28у cDNA under a constitutive SV40 promotor were used. Those cells either displayed a three- to six-fold increased expression of PA28y (B8y) or an empty pSG5 (B8vc) vector as described previously [ 15 ,  22 ]. B8 fibroblasts were pre-cultured in DMEM/Ham’s F12 (1:1) medium (Biochrom, Merck) with glutamine supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS and G418 (250 μg/mL). Triplicates of 8 × 10 3  cells were cultured in a 96 well format. Cell lines were cultured in an incubator with a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2  at 37 °C. Cell viability (CTB) assay For B8 cells, triplicates of 8 × 10 3  cells were seeded in 100 μL media in two separate 96 well formats (two to eight independent experiments) and incubated for 24 h. Fresh medium containing either 10% or 0.2% FBS was added and cells were incubated for additional 24 h prior to 3-BrPA treatment. After 3-BrPA treatment, both B8 and MPNST cells were incubated with 20 μL of CellTiter-Blue® reagent (Promega) for 1 h and fluorescence (560 nm excitation/590 nm emission) was recorded using a plate reader and expressed as fluorescence units (FU). The background fluorescence units FU 0  of the associated untreated unstained cells were subtracted in each measurement. Finally, we normalized the measured quantity by

DHE assays Murine fibroblasts treated with 3-BrPA in a range of 0 to 120 μM for 24 h were stained with 10 μM dihydroethidium (DHE, Sigma-Aldrich, Merck) as an independent indicator of ROS formation. Staining was performed in triplicates at 37 °C for 45 min using 96 well microtiter plates in seven independent experiments. Stained cells were washed twice with PBS. Fluorescent cells were quantified with the plate reader at 560 nm excitation and 590 nm emission. Results are also displayed as normalized fluorescence unit differences according to Eq. ( 1 ). Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide tetrazolium reductase (NADH-TR) assay A standard NADH-TR staining protocol with minor modifications was applied to investigate the ability of mitochondrial enzyme NADH dehydrogenase (complex I) to reduce colorless nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) chloride into dark blue formazan compound. Therefore, triplicates of living cells in a 96 well format were pre-treated with 3-BrPA and washed once with PBS to remove detached cells. Then, cells were washed once with 50 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.6), and 50 μl of staining solution was added to each well. Staining solution was prepared freshly by mixing equal amounts of solution I (50 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.6) and 0,16% NADH) and solution II (50 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.6) and 0,2% NBT) prior to application. Staining of cells was performed for 2 h at room temperature. Hereafter, the absorbance of NBT formazan deposits was measured calorimetrically at a wavelength of 620 nm using a microplate reader; the arbitrary unit of the measured quantity is the colorimetrical unit (CU). The final subtraction and normalization of the measurement results were performed according to Eq. ( 1 ). Four independent experiments were carried out. Lactate assay To examine aerobic glycolysis in response to 3-BrPA, we investigated lactate uptake of B8 fibroblasts. Cellular consumption of lactate in cell culture medium is high under normal growth conditions. An increase in lactate concentration in cell culture medium thereby reflects a decrease in metabolic capacity of cells. The detection of L(+)-lactate in cell culture media was performed with Lactate Assay Kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Briefly, duplicates of B8 cell lines were seeded in 96 well plates and incubated for 24 h. Next, fresh media was added containing either 10% or 0.2% FBS and cells were incubated for additional 24 h. After incubation with 3-BrPA, 50 μl medium was removed from each well and centrifuged (13,000 g for 10 min) to remove cellular debris. To ensure that the amount of lactate in the supernatant medium was in detection range, a standard curve was assayed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Following the manual, 5 μl medium of each sample was mixed with 2 μl probe, 2 μl enzyme mix and 41 μl lactate assay buffer (per each reaction) in a 96 well plate and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Lactate probe fluorescence was measured at 535 nm excitation and 587 nm emission by means of a microplate reader. The results of three independent experiments are expressed as normalized FU differences according to Eq. ( 1 ). Protein expression of cell-cycle marker proteins To demonstrate the expression of cell cycle and apoptosis markers, we analyzed MPNST cell lines by immunohistochemistry using commercially available antibodies against the proliferation marker protein Ki-67 (antigen Ki67, monoclonal mouse anti-human Ki67 antigen, clone MIB1, M7240, DAKO), the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (p21, monoclonal mouse anti-human p21 WAF1/Cip1 , M7202, DAKO), the tumor protein p53 (p53, monoclonal mouse anti-human p53 M7001, DAKO), the B-cell lymphoma 2 (bcl2, monoclonal mouse anti-human bcl2 oncoprotein, M887, DAKO), the B-cell lymphoma 6 (bcl6, monoclonal mouse anti-human bcl6 protein, M7211, DAKO), and the cyclin D1 (monoclonal rabbit anti-human cyclin D1, M3642, DAKO). Analyses were performed using standard protocols according to the manufacturer’s instructions on an autostainer (DAKO Autostainer Link 48) and human immuno-positive tumors were used as controls. Ki67 labelling was analysed conventionally as well as using analysis software pathoZoom® (smart in media, Köln, Germany). Statistical analyses The U test of Mann, Whitney, and Wilcoxon was applied for univariate hypothesis testing with two independent samples in each case. A significance level of α = 0.05 was used and all confidence levels were 1 – α = 0.95 ≙ 95%. A  p  value of ≤ 0.05 was considered to be significant. Pearson’s correlation coefficient r was used to quantify the strength of a correlation. The probabilities p of zero correlation were calculated using a one-sided association test based on Student’s t test with n - 2 degrees of freedom, where n is the sample size. The quality of estimating a correlation by a regression function was evaluated using the coefficient of determination, r 2 . The graphical representation of the results and the statistical hypothesis testing were performed by the software package MATLAB®, version R2007a (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA).",Christian Linke; Markus Wösle; Anja Harder,BMC cancer,2020-09-18,10.1186/s12885-020-07397-w,minimal,True
PMID:25534823,Akt- or MEK-mediated mTOR inhibition suppresses Nf1 optic glioma growth.,"BACKGROUND: Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) develop optic pathway gliomas, which result from impaired NF1 protein regulation of Ras activity. One obstacle to the implementation of biologically targeted therapies is an incomplete understanding of the individual contributions of the downstream Ras effectors (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase [MEK], Akt) to optic glioma maintenance. This study was designed to address the importance of MEK and Akt signaling to Nf1 optic glioma growth. METHODS: Primary neonatal mouse astrocyte cultures were employed to determine the consequence of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt and MEK inhibition on Nf1-deficient astrocyte growth. Nf1 optic glioma-bearing mice were used to assess the effect of Akt and MEK inhibition on tumor volume, proliferation, and retinal ganglion cell dysfunction. RESULTS: Both MEK and Akt were hyperactivated in Nf1-deficient astrocytes in vitro and in Nf1 murine optic gliomas in vivo. Pharmacologic PI3K or Akt inhibition reduced Nf1-deficient astrocyte proliferation to wild-type levels, while PI3K inhibition decreased Nf1 optic glioma volume and proliferation. Akt inhibition of Nf1-deficient astrocyte and optic glioma growth reflected Akt-dependent activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Sustained MEK pharmacologic blockade also attenuated Nf1-deficient astrocytes as well as Nf1 optic glioma volume and proliferation. Importantly, these MEK inhibitory effects resulted from p90RSK-mediated, Akt-independent mTOR activation. Finally, both PI3K and MEK inhibition reduced optic glioma-associated retinal ganglion cell loss and nerve fiber layer thinning. CONCLUSION: These findings establish that the convergence of 2 distinct Ras effector pathways on mTOR signaling maintains Nf1 mouse optic glioma growth, supporting the evaluation of pharmacologic inhibitors that target mTOR function in future human NF1-optic pathway glioma clinical trials.",,Aparna Kaul; Joseph A Toonen; Patrick J Cimino; Scott M Gianino; David H Gutmann,Neuro-oncology,2015-06,10.1093/neuonc/nou329,abstract_only,False
PMID:803743,Vascular manifestations of von Recklinghausen's disease.,"A casual relationship between von Recklinghausen's disease, or neurofibromatosis, and arteriolar abnormalities has been reported in the European literature. A patient was seen who had biopsy-proved neurofibromatosis and renovascular hypertension and retroperitoneal bleeding. An arteriographic study showed multiple small aneurysms throughout the coeliac axis, the superior mesenteric artery and in several small intrarenal vessels. Renal vein renin levels were elevated particularly in the right renal vein, supporting the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension. Both the aneurysms seen in angiographic studies and the retroperitoneal hemorrhage are probably vascular manifestations of von Recklinghausen's disease. Support for this conclusion is enhanced by the absence of clinical, laboratory or histologic data supporting the only tenable differential diagnosis, periarteritis nodosa.",,K H Fye; R P Jacobs; R L Roe,The Western journal of medicine,1975-02,,abstract_only,False
PMID:33085177,The development of the PlexiQoL: A patient-reported outcome measure for adults with neurofibromatosis type 1-associated plexiform neurofibromas.,"BACKGROUND: To develop and validate a patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure of quality of life (QoL), specific to patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1)-associated plexiform neurofibromas (pNFs), suitable for use in clinical efficacy trials. The study was conducted in parallel in the UK and US. METHODS: Qualitative interviews were conducted with patients to generate questionnaire content. Face and content validity of the draft scale was assessed by cognitive debriefing interviews (CDIs). A postal validation survey was conducted to identify the final version of the questionnaire (the PlexiQoL), establish its unidimensionality, and assess its psychometric properties. RESULTS: Thematic analysis was performed on 42 interview transcripts. Thirty-one CDIs revealed that patients found the draft scale to be comprehensible, relevant, and easy to complete. The postal validation survey was completed by 273 patients. Rasch analysis identified an 18-item unidimensional scale that showed excellent internal consistency, reproducibility, and sensitivity to differences in patient-perceived pNF severity, general health, and the use of pain medication. CONCLUSIONS: The PlexiQoL is the first disease-specific PRO assessing the ability of adults with NF-1 associated pNFs to meet their basic human needs. Clinical trials are planned to assess the sensitivity to change of the PlexiQoL in people undergoing treatment for pNFs.","Methods Qualitative interviews were conducted with patients to generate questionnaire content. Face and content validity of the draft scale was assessed by cognitive debriefing interviews (CDIs). A postal validation survey was conducted to identify the final version of the questionnaire (the PlexiQoL), establish its unidimensionality, and assess its psychometric properties. 2 METHODS 2.1 Ethical compliance The UK study was granted ethics committee approval by the National Research Ethics Service Committee North West (14/NW/0279). In the US, approval was granted by the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (JHU‐SOM) Institutional Review Board. 2.2 Patients In the UK, patients were recruited through the Children's Tumor Foundation Patient Registry ( https://nfregistry.patientcrossroads.org ) and the Genetics department at St Mary's Hospital, Manchester. For the postal validation survey, additional avenues of recruitment were utilised that included charities, support groups and additional clinical centres. Patients in the US were recruited from Johns Hopkins Comprehensive Neurofibromatosis Center, Baltimore and the Patient Registry. Patients at each stage provided written informed consent prior to inclusion in the study. Eligibility requirements included; age of 18 or above, confirmed NF1 diagnosis, ≥1 pNF, ability to understand and complete questionnaires independently and ability to provide written informed consent. Patients were excluded if they were undergoing evaluation for malignant conversion of a pNF or had known active malignancy, were unable to provide informed consent or were deemed by the clinical team to be incapable of participating in the study. Patients with a history of malignancy that had been previously, curatively treated were included. 2.3 Stages in the development of the PlexiQoL Three main stages were involved in the development of the PlexiQoL. 2.3.1 Item generation PlexiQoL content was derived from unstructured qualitative interviews conducted by experienced interviewers, with patients in the UK and US. Letters were sent to eligible patients inviting them to take part in the study. The UK interviews were conducted in a private room in either the Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine at Saint Mary's Hospital, the offices of Galen Research or at the patient's home. US interviews were conducted at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore. With the patient's permission, interviews were audio‐recorded and transcribed verbatim, with any patient‐identifying information removed from the transcripts to ensure anonymity. The interviews focused on the ways in which pNFs and their treatment affected the ability of interviewees to fulfil their human needs. Interviewees were asked to describe how their condition impacted their everyday lives. Rather than asking specific questions, participants were encouraged to talk freely about whichever issues they considered important. Where participants reported symptoms or functional problems caused by their pNFs, they were asked to explain how these affected their ability to meet their needs. Theoretical thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke,  2006 ), guided by the needs‐based model of QoL (Hunt & McKenna,  1992 ), was performed on the transcripts. Independent analysis of each transcript was conducted by two members of the research team (who had not interviewed the respondent), to identify potential QoL issues. All issues identified from the transcripts were recorded together and grouped by themes. The research team in the UK and a US NF clinician then worked together to refine the themes and to identify potential items, using the patients’ own words wherever possible. All themes were derived from the current transcripts only, with no reference made to themes generated in previous instrument development studies. An item pool was generated that contained items derived from both UK and US patients. The draft questionnaire was produced containing the same items for both countries. However, the wording of some statements differed to reflect local language and idioms. The questionnaire was presented in a pen and paper format with “True”/”Not True” response options. Respondents were asked to base their responses on how they felt at the moment (UK) / at the present time (US). This format has proven to be the most effective in previous needs‐based measures and to be more sensitive than measures with multiple response options (De Jong et al.,  1997 ). 2.3.2 Assessment of face and content validity Semi‐structured cognitive debriefing interviews (CDIs) were conducted with UK and US patients to determine the clarity, relevance, and applicability of the draft PlexiQoL. Patients were asked to complete the questionnaire in the presence of a researcher, who made detailed notes about hesitations or difficulties experienced by respondents. Guided by a semi‐structured interview schedule, the interviewer asked about the problems observed and specific questions about the suitability of the questionnaire content. Patients were encouraged to provide feedback on the items and instructions, and whether any aspects of their experience were not covered by the questionnaire. Interviewees were also asked how they referred to their pNFs. This was important to ensure that interviewees could distinguish these from dermal tumours and gliomas. The research team analysed the CDI reports to identify and address any problematic items and/or instructions. 2.3.3 Postal validation survey A large scale postal survey was conducted in parallel in the UK and US to reduce the number of items in the PlexiQoL and to assess its scaling and psychometric properties. Eligible participants were sent a questionnaire pack which included a demographic questionnaire, the draft PlexiQoL and a comparator measure. The comparator measure used in the UK was the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP; Hunt et al.,  1981 ) and the Short Form‐36 (SF‐36; Ware & Sherbourne,  1992 ) was used in the US. These are generic measures of subjective health status (HRQL). The NHP comprises six sections; energy level, pain, physical mobility, sleep, social isolation, and emotional reactions. Each section is scored from 0 to 100, where 100 indicates the worst health state. The SF‐36 consists of 36 items, covering eight sections. Scores on the SF‐36 range from 0 to 100, with a higher score representing better health. A subset of respondents was asked to complete the PlexiQoL approximately two weeks after the first administration to assess reproducibility. Scale reduction RMT is a measurement model that assesses whether a set of questions in a scale can be added together to provide a valid, unidimensional total score. It was used in this study to evaluate and improve the measurement properties of the draft PlexiQoL. A target sample size of 250 patients was selected. A sample of this size is required to provide over 99% confidence that the parameter estimates are stable within half a logit (Linacre,  1994 ). Where a scale fits the Rasch model it is unidimensional (measures one construct) and interval level measurement is achieved. Internal reliability was assessed using the Person Separation Index (PSI). The PSI is indicative of the power of the items to distinguish between respondents. A PSI score of 0.70 is the minimum acceptable value (Tennant & Conaghan,  2007 ). Fit of the PlexiQoL data to the model was investigated by reference to the overall item‐trait interaction Chi‐squarefit value. A significant Chi‐square statistic ( p  < 0.05) is indicative of misfit to the Rasch model. Item level fit was investigated via Chi‐square and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) individual item fit statistics, in addition to individual item fit residuals. Statistical significance ( p  < 0.05) in the Chi‐square and F‐test indicates poor fit of an item to the model. Bonferroni adjustments were applied to these tests to account for multiple comparisons (Bland,  1995 ). Individual item fit residuals falling outside ±2.5 are indicative of model misfit. A requirement of the Rasch model is that items should be invariant across groups. This is examined through tests of differential item functioning (DIF; Angoff,  1993 ). The groups examined for DIF were; age (below median versus above median), gender, and country. An ANOVA of standardized residuals was conducted, with a p‐value of <0.05 (Bonferroni corrections applied) considered indicative of the presence of DIF. To be valid and reliable, items in a scale should be related but independent of each other. This is referred to as local independence and can be violated in two ways; multidimensionality and response dependency. The former is referred to as trait dependency, which occurs when a scale includes items that assess more than one construct. Response dependency occurs where the response to one item depends on the response to another (Marais & Andrich,  2008 ). Both types of local item dependency (LID) can be addressed by combining the dependent items into a single item, known as a subtest (Tennant & Conaghan,  2007 ). Item residual correlations of 0.2 above the average residual correlations for all items are considered indicative of a violation of local independence (Christensen et al.,  2017 ). Targeting of items to the respondents was assessed by examining person‐item distribution graphs. These show the ordering of both persons and items on the same logit scale and indicate whether the items in the scale are well matched to the respondents. Items with negative logit values are easier (more likely) to be affirmed by respondents. Items with positive logit values are more difficult (less likely) to be affirmed. Rasch analysis was conducted using the RUMM2030 programme (Andrich et al.,  2010 ). Classical psychometric analysis Internal consistency Internal consistency measures the degree of relatedness of items. A Cronbach's alpha coefficient below 0.7 indicates that the items do not work together to form a scale (Streiner & Norman,  1995 ). Test‐retest reliability Test‐retest reliability is an estimate of a measure's reproducibility over time when no change in condition has taken place. This was assessed using Spearman's rank correlation to correlate PlexiQoL scores obtained on two different occasions. A value of 0.85 or above indicates that an instrument produces a low level of random measurement error (Weiner & Stewart,  1984 ). Convergent validity Convergent validity measures the level of association between scores on one scale and those on a comparator scale that measures a related construct. Scores obtained on the PlexiQoL were compared with NHP scores in the UK and SF‐36 scores in the US, using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients, to establish convergent validity. Known group validity Known group validity examines the ability of a measure to distinguish between groups of people that differ according to some known factor. Nonparametric tests for independent samples were employed to examine scores of respondents grouped by perceived pNF severity (mild, moderate, severe, very severe), perceived general health (very good, good, fair, poor), whether patients were taking pain medication and if they had pNFs that were visible to others. PlexiQoL scores of respondents who differed by gender, age (above versus below median age), and country were also examined.",Alice Heaney; Jeanette Wilburn; Matthew Rouse; Shannon Langmead; Jaishri O Blakeley; Susan Huson; Stephen P McKenna,Molecular genetics & genomic medicine,2020-12,10.1002/mgg3.1530,minimal,True
PMID:19966217,Cardiac and vascular functions of the zebrafish orthologues of the type I neurofibromatosis gene NFI.,"Von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis is a common autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by benign and malignant tumors of neural crest origin. Significant progress in understanding the pathophysiology of this disease has occurred in recent years, largely aided by the development of relevant animal models. Von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene, which encodes neurofibromin, a large protein that modulates the activity of Ras. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of zebrafish nf1a and nf1b, orthologues of NF1, and show neural crest and cardiovascular defects resulting from morpholino knockdown, including vascular and cardiac valvular abnormalities.

PMID:24753394,Phase II trial of pirfenidone in children and young adults with neurofibromatosis type 1 and progressive plexiform neurofibromas.,"BACKGROUND: Pirfenidone, an oral anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic agent with activity in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, may mediate anti-tumor activity in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and plexiform neurofibromas (PN) by inhibition of fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis. The primary objective of this open label, single arm phase II trial was to evaluate the activity of pirfenidone in children and young adults with inoperable PN. PROCEDURE: Patients (3-21 years) with NF1-related progressive PN received pirfenidone at the previously determined optimal dose (500 mg/m(2) orally, q8h) on a continuous dosing schedule (one cycle = 28 days). Volumetric MRI analysis was used to assess response. Progression was defined as ≥ 20% PN volume increase compared to baseline. Pirfenidone would be considered active if it doubled the median time to progression (TTP) compared to the TTP on the placebo arm of a phase II trial with the farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib, which used near identical eligibility criteria. Toxicities, objective response rate, and quality of life (QOL) also were evaluated. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were enrolled and tolerated pirfenidone well with intermittent nausea and vomiting as the most frequent toxicities. A dose reduction was required in only three patients. The median TTP for pirfenidone was 13.2 months compared to 10.6 months for the placebo control group from the tipifarnib trial (two-tailed P = 0.92; one-tailed P = 0.46). No objective responses were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Pirfenidone was well tolerated, but did not demonstrate activity as defined in this trial and does not warrant further evaluation in children with NF1 and progressive PN.","PATIENTS AND METHODS This multi-center trial was sponsored by Dr. Babovic-Vuksa-novic, who held the IND and was supported by a DOD clinical trial award (NF01000042) and an FDA Orphan Fund Program grant. Pirfenidone was initially supplied by Marnac, Inc/Solanan, Inc, Dallas, Texas, and in later stages of the trial, by Intermune, Inc. This study was coordinated by the NCI Pediatric Oncology Branch. Patients were enrolled at seven participating sites. Patient Eligibility Children and young adults ≥3 and ≤21 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of NF1 [ 21 ] and unresectable, progressive PN that have the potential to cause significant morbidity were eligible if they met the criteria for disease status and organ function ( Supplemental Table S1 ). Patients, who underwent prior surgery for their progressive PN, were eligible provided the residual tumor was measurable. No prior medical therapy was required, as there is no standard medical treatment for PN. The Institutional Review Boards of the participating institutions approved this trial. All patients or their legal guardians signed an informed consent indicating their understanding of the investigational nature and the risks of this study. Written assent was obtained from children 7 through 17 years old. Dosing Schedule Pirfenidone was initially supplied as 200 and 400 mg capsules, and from 2008 on as 267 mg capsules. Pirfenidone was administered orally, with food, approximately every 8 hours at the pediatric solid tumor optimal dose (500 mg/m 2 /dose) on a continuous dosing schedule for 28-day treatment cycles. Each patient’s dose was rounded to the nearest 200 mg, and with change in drug supply to the nearest 267 mg, using a dosing nomogram based on body surface area. During the first week of the first treatment cycle pirfenidone was administered at a reduced dose to prevent nausea and vomiting, based on experience from the adult phase II and pediatric phase I NF1 trials. Capsules could be opened and the content mixed with food for easier consumption in young children. Daily intake of pirfenidone was documented by patients or their guardians in drug diaries, which were reviewed with the medical team at the time of response evaluations. Toxicity Grading and Dose Modifications for Toxicity Adverse events were graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3. Pirfenidone was held for grade 2 toxicities considered possibly, probably or definitely related to pirfenidone treatment until resolution to grade ≤1 and then restarted at unchanged dose. Pirfenidone was held until resolution of toxicity and subsequently dose reduced for recurrent grade 2, or for grade 3 drug related toxicities. Pirfenidone was permanently discontinued for grade 4 toxicities or for recurrent grade ≥2 toxicities after a dose reduction. Study Evaluations Psatients were monitored with history and physical examination, complete blood count with differential, and serum electrolytes, creatinine, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, SGPT, and bilirubin, prior to cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, and subsequently after every six treatment cycles for the on study duration. STIR MRI of up to three clinically relevant index PN was performed for volumetric analysis as previously described [ 19 ] prior to the start of cycles 1, 4, 7, 10, and then after every six cycles. Response evaluation was centrally performed at the NCI. A volume increase of ≥20% in at least one PN compared to baseline was defined as progressive disease. A partial response was defined as a ≥50%, and a minor response as a ≥25% but less than 50% reduction in the sum of the volume of all index PN for ≥ 4 weeks, respectively. QOL was assessed using the Impact of Pediatric Illness (IPI) Scale for children 6–18 years of age [ 22 ]. The child’s primary caregiver completed the proxy Parent Form and children answered either the self-report Child (ages 6–10 years) or Adolescent (ages 11–18 years) Form prior to cycles 1,4,7, and 10 and then after every six cycles. The parallel IPI Scale forms assess four domains: adaptive behavior, emotional functioning, medical/physical status, and cognitive functioning. Responses to the 43 items are made on a 3- or 5-point Likert scale (1 to 5 for Parent and Adolescent Form and 1,3,5 for the Child Form) ranging from “not at all” to “a lot.” Item scores are transformed to a scale of 0–100, and mean scores are calculated for the four domains and total scale with higher scores indicating better QOL. Statistical Considerations Trial design. This study was conducted as a single stage, single arm phase II trial with TTP as primary endpoint. The primary trial objective was to determine whether the use of pirfenidone in children and young adults with NF1 and progressive PN is able to increase the TTP. Due to the unknown natural history of the growth rate of PN a complex trial design (double-blinded, placebocontrolled, flexible cross-over trial) was used in a then ongoing pha se II trial of tipifarnib for children with NF1 and progressive PN to determine if tipifarnib could double the TTP in PN compared to placebo. This pirfenidone phase II trial used the initial placebo arm from the tipifarnib trial, containing 30 patients as historical control. When the present study was being designed, it was assumed that the median TTP of the placebo arm for the tipifarnib study would be 6 months, and that the eligibility criteria and distribution of potential prognostic factors for the present trial were identical to those of the tipifarnib trial. For sample size purposes, the trial was designed to have sufficient patients to identify a doubling of the median time to progression, from 6 to 12 months. A Kaplan–Meier analysis using a log-rank test was to be the primary method of analysis to compare the two arms. At the time the present study was designed, 50% of the 30 patients on the placebo arm on the previous trial had progressed, at a median of 6 months, determined by a preliminary Kaplan-Meier analysis. Assuming that this would persist at least approximately, then accrual of 36 patients on the present study would provide at least 80% power to detect a doubling against the control arm from the prior trial, with an intended one-sided alpha = 0.05. Since the primary trial endpoint and assessment of the primary endpoint were identical and participating sites and eligibility criteria nearly identical, we anticipated that differences in patient characteristics and related factors would be minimal. Quality of life analysis. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the IPI Scale total scores from baseline to the pre-cycle 4 (parent, n = 19; child/adolescent, n = 19), pre-cycle 7 (parent, n = 16; child/adolescent, n = 17) and pre-cycle 10 (parent, n = 13; child/adolescent, n = 15) evaluations. Random missing data prevented longitudinal analyses across all time points, and the median time on treatment (13.2 months) limited longer-term analyses due to fewer patients continuing on study past the pre cycle 10 assessment. ANOVAs also were used to compare the four baseline domain scores from the parent (n = 23) and from the child/adolescent (n = 23) forms as well as compare the parent proxy and self-report scores among the group that had both forms completed at baseline (n = 21).",Brigitte C Widemann; Dusica Babovic-Vuksanovic; Eva Dombi; Pamela L Wolters; Stewart Goldman; Staci Martin; Anne Goodwin; Wendy Goodspeed; Mark W Kieran; Bruce Cohen; Susan M Blaney; Allison King; Jeffrey Solomon; Nicholas Patronas; Frank M Balis; Elizabeth Fox; Seth M Steinberg; Roger J Packer,Pediatric blood & cancer,2014-09,10.1002/pbc.25041,minimal,True
PMID:25639352,Neural Crest-Specific TSC1 Deletion in Mice Leads to Sclerotic Craniofacial Bone Lesion.,"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2. TSC has high frequency of osseous manifestations such as sclerotic lesions in the craniofacial region. However, an animal model that replicates TSC craniofacial bone lesions has not yet been described. The roles of Tsc1 and the sequelae of Tsc1 dysfunction in bone are unknown. In this study, we generated a mouse model of TSC with a deletion of Tsc1 in neural crest-derived (NCD) cells that recapitulated the sclerotic craniofacial bone lesions in TSC. Analysis of this mouse model demonstrated that TSC1 deletion led to enhanced mTORC1 signaling in NCD bones and the increase in bone formation is responsible for the aberrantly increased bone mass. Lineage mapping revealed that TSC1 deficient NCD cells overpopulated the NCD bones. Mechanistically, hyperproliferation of osteoprogenitors at an early postnatal stage accounts for the increased osteoblast pool. Intriguingly, early postnatal treatment with rapamycin, an mTORC1 inhibitor, can completely rescue the aberrant bone mass, but late treatment cannot. Our data suggest that enhanced mTOR signaling in NCD cells can increase bone mass through enlargement of the osteoprogenitor pool, which likely explains the sclerotic bone lesion observed in TSC patients.","MATERIALS AND METHODS Mice The floxed  Tsc1  ( Tsc1 flox/flox ), P0-Cre (line A), Rosa 26 transgenic mice were described previously ( 8 ) ( 11 ,  12 ).  Tsc1 flox/flox  mice were mated with P0-Cre mice to generate  Tsc1 flox/flox ;P0-Cre mice and  Tsc1 flox/+ ;P0-Cre mice, designated as CKO and cHet mice respectively.  Tsc1 flox/flox  mice were served as a control for CKO mice.  Tsc1 flox/flox  mice were bred with Rosa 26 reporter mice to generate  Tsc1 flox/flox ;Rosa/Rosa mice that introduce the LacZ reporter gene. Then, cHet mice were bred with  Tsc1 flox/flox ;Rosa/Rosa mice to generate  Tsc1 flox/+ ;P0-Cre;Rosa/+ (cHet-LacZ) and  Tsc1 flox/flox ;P0-Cre;Rosa/+ (CKO-LacZ) mice. The P0-Cre transgenic strain was initially generated on the FVB background ( 11 ) and then backcrossed onto the 129S1/SvJ background. P0-Cre transgenic mice were crossed to  Tsc1 flox/flox  mice that were maintained on the C57BL/6 background. The Rosa26-LacZ allele was maintained on the mixed 129S1/SvJ and C57BL/6 backgrounds. For some experiments, P0-Cre transgenic mice were backcrossed onto C57BL/6 background for at least 5 generations. The 129S1/SvJ/C57BL/6 mixed background and more pure C57BL/6 background showed similar sclerotic phenotypes in CKO mice. All experimental procedures were carried out with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Michigan. X-gal staining and FACS-galactosidase assay Skulls were fixed in 4% PFA for 15 min at room temperature, followed by three PBS washes for 5 min each. Skulls were then stained in 2ml LacZ staining solution (Kferri/Kferro 5mM, MgCl 2  2mM, X-gal 1mg/ml, NP-40 0.02%, Sodium Deoxycholate 0.01%) at 37°C for 8 h. Stained skulls were washed 3 times with PBS and then post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4°C. Skulls were decalcified and embedded in paraffin; 6µM sections (described below) were counterstained with Neutral Red. Primary calvarial osteoblasts were digested from frontal and nasal bones (described below) and grown on glass coverslips overnight. Cells were fixed in 4% PFA with 0.4% glutaraldehyde at room temperature for 5 min and washed 3 times with PBS. Cells were stained in 1ml LacZ staining solution for 5–8 h, then washed 3 times with and treated with ProLong® Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI (Life Technologies,  P36931 ). LacZ positive cell number and bone perimeter were quantified with the multipoint tool and segmented line measurement function of Image J software. Expression of LacZ in live cells was examined using fluorescein di-β-D-galactopyranoside (FluoReporter LacZ Flow Cytometry Kit; Molecular Probes) staining according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were analyzed on a FACSCanto (BD Biosciences) instrument. RNA extraction and qRT-PCR Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. qRT–PCR analyses were performed as described previously ( 13 ). cDNA templates were subjected to qPCR using the SYBR Green PCR Core reagents system (Qiagen). 18S rRNA was used as an internal control. Relative gene expression was calculated by the ΔCT (the difference between the threshold cycles) method ( 14 ). Primer sequences used for real-time PCR are available upon request. Western Blot Analysis Protein extracts were prepared from calvaria of 7 day old postnatal mice. Primary calvarial osteoblasts were isolated from neonatal mice (between birth and postnatal day 3). Cells and tissues were lysed using NP40 lysis buffer (PH 8.0 Tris-HCl 20mM, NaCl 137mM, 1% NP40, 10% Glycerol, Na 3 VO 4  1mM) and protein extracts were analyzed by 8% (TSC1, Vinculin) and 15% (p-S6, S6) SDS–PAGE and blotted onto PVDF membrane (Millipore, IPVH00010). Membranes were incubated with rabbit anti-TSC1 antibody (Cell signaling, #4906), rabbit anti-p-S6 antibody (Cell Signaling, #5364), rabbit anti-S6 antibody (Cell signaling #2217) or mouse anti- Vinculin antibody (Sigma-aldrich V4505), followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Goat anti-rabbit, Thermo, 31460) and a Goat anti-mouse antibody (Jacksonimmuno, 115-035-072). Membranes were developed with HPR substrate ECL (Millipore, WBKL S0500). Films were scanned using an Epson Perfection V700 photo system and bands were quantified with the optical density function of Image J software. Histology Skulls were decalcified in 14% EDTA solution at 4°C, then processed using a Leica ASP 300 paraffin tissue processor and embedded in paraffin with Tissue-Tek paraffin tissue embedding station. 6µM sections were cut with a Leica RM 2145 microtome and used for H&E staining or immunostaining. Immunostaining Paraffin sections were de-waxed and rehydrated in xylene and sequential alcohol solutions. Antigen retrieval was performed according to instructions for each antibody. For immunohistochemistry, endogenous peroxidase was blocked by 0.3% H 2 O 2 / Methanol for 30 min. Sections were then incubated with primary antibodies (anti-p-S6 and anti-Osterix) overnight at 4 °C. A horseradish peroxidase–streptavidin system (Dako) was used to detect immunoreactivity, which was followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich). For immunofluoresence, sections were incubated with primary antibody (Ki67, Spring, M306) overnight at 4°C after rehydration, washed 3 times with PBST, and then incubated with secondary antibody (Life Technologies, A-21206) for 1 h at room temperature. After 3 washes, sections were mounted with ProLong® Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI. Positive cells and bone perimeter were quantified with the multipoint tool and segmented line measurement function of Image J software. Micro CT Skulls were dissected free of soft tissue and analyzed by microcomputed tomography using an eXplore Locus SP (GE Healthcare Pre-Clinical Imaging, London, ON, Canada) as we described previously ( 15 – 17 ). Calvaria thickness measurement Calvaria thickness was measured as described previously ( 13 ). In brief, the measurements were performed at the center of the frontal and parietal bones with a caliper (Pfingst, Sweden) on 1-month, 2-month, 3-month, and 1-year-old mice in a blinded manner. Histomorphometry Static and dynamic histomorphometry were performed similar to what we described previously ( 18 – 20 ). For dynamic histomorphometry, mice were given intraperitoneal injections of calcein (10 mg/kg) 6 days and 2 days prior to sacrifice. Measurements were made on the frontal bones. All static and dynamic parameters were measured according to the Report of the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research Histomorphometry Nomenclature Committee ( 21 ). Primary calvarial osteoblast isolation and culture Calvarial cells were isolated from 1- to 3-day-old transgenic mice. After removal of sutures, frontal and nasal bones were subjected to four sequential digestions as previously described ( 13 ). Cells were plated at a density of 1.9–2.4 × 10 4  cells/cm 2  in 6-cm dishes in alpha MEM containing 10% FBS. For osteogenic differentiation, the medium was changed to differentiation medium after 1 week of culture as described previously ( 13 ). Rapamycin rescue experiments Rapamycin (LC laboratory) was reconstituted in absolute ethanol at 10 mg/ml and diluted in 5% Tween-80 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 5% PEG-400 (Hampton Research). Mice received 1 mg/kg rapamycin by i.p. injection every other day. Mice were treated from birth to one-week-old for LacZ staining and western blotting, from one week-old to two-months-old and from 1-month-old to 3-months-old for calvaria thickness measurements. Statistical analysis Student’s t test was used to compare two groups.

PMID:36604703,The German version of the neurofibromatosis 2 impact on quality of life questionnaire correlates with severity of depression and physician-reported disease severity.,"BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a rare genetic disease that causes a wide range of disabilities leading to compromised quality of life (QOL). There is clear need for a validated disease-specific tool to assess quality of life among German-speaking patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). The NFTI-QOL questionnaire has produced useful results in English-speaking cohorts. The aim of this study was to produce and validate a German version of the NFTI-QOL (NFTI-QOL-D) and to correlate QOL scores with a depression score (PHQ-9) and clinical disease severity. METHODS: The original English-language NFTI-QOL was translated into German and then back-translated in order to preserve the questionnaire's original concepts and intentions. A link to an online survey encompassing the NFTI-QOL-D and the PHQ-9 depression questionnaire was then sent to 97 patients with NF2 by email. The respondents' scores were compared to clinician-reported disease severity scores. RESULTS: 77 patients completed the online survey in full. Internal reliability among NFTI-QOL-D responses was strong (Cronbach's alpha: 0.74). Both PHQ-9 and clinician disease severity scores correlated with NFTI-QOL-D scores (Pearson's rho 0.63 and 0.62, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The NFTI-QOL-D is a reliable and useful tool to assess patient-reported QOL in German-speaking patients with NF2. The correlation of QOL with both psychological and physical disease parameters underlines the importance of individualized interdisciplinary patient care for NF2 patients, with attention paid to mental well-being as well as to somatic disease manifestations.","Methods The original English-language NFTI-QOL was translated into German and then back-translated in order to preserve the questionnaire’s original concepts and intentions. A link to an online survey encompassing the NFTI-QOL-D and the PHQ-9 depression questionnaire was then sent to 97 patients with NF2 by email. The respondents’ scores were compared to clinician-reported disease severity scores.
 Methods Translation of the NFTI-QOL into German Forward translation  As a first step, the original English version of the NFTI-QOL questionnaire was translated into German by ACLM (a native German speaker with profound knowledge of the English language who lives in the target country). The aim was to produce a version which was semantically and conceptually as close as possible to the original questionnaire. Back translation  The German version was then back-translated into English by ALM (a native English speaker with profound knowledge of the German language who lives in Germany but spent most of his life in the UK). Harmonisation  Any discrepancies with the original English version were discussed by ACLM and ALM until agreement was reached. AF (a native German speaker who lives in Germany) consecutively assessed the generated German version of the NFTI-QOL (henceforth “NFTI-QOL-D”) for intelligibility and readability. The finalised NFTI-QOL-D can be found in Fig.  1 . Fig. 1 NFTI-QOL German version. Like the original version the questionnaire consists of 8 items with 4 possible answers each. Depending on symptom severity, 0 to 3 points are granted per category, resulting in up to 24 points in total Online survey An online survey was created including the NFTI-QOL-D and the German version of the PHQ-9 questionnaire (9-item patient health questionnaire, a tool for the assessment of depression) [ 9 ,  10 ]. The link to the online survey was sent to 97 German-speaking patients with NF2 treated at the supraregional Erfurt Neurofibromatosis Centre, representing all NF2 patients treated at the centre for whom email addresses were available. Utilised questionnaires and scores NFTI-QOL  This disease-specific questionnaire consists of 8 items relating to different aspects of quality of life with 4 possible answers each. Depending on symptom severity, 0 to 3 points are granted per category, resulting in up to 24 points in total. The higher the score, the lower the quality of life. Hornigold et al. found no significant correlation with age or gender (ρ = 0.246 and ρ = 0.025, respectively). It showed good internal reliability (α = 0.87) and a good ability to detect significant longitudinal changes in the quality of life of individuals. The free text section, which was included in the original version of the NFTI-QoL was not mentioned in our online survey as it was already stated by Hornigold et al. that the free text section did not yield any additional information and patients rather affirmed the importance of the items included in the questionnaire [ 2 ]. PHQ-9  A commonly used questionnaire with 9 items which each assess one of the 9 DSM IV criteria for depression. Depending on symptom severity, 0 to 3 points are granted per category, resulting in up to 27 points in total. The higher the score, the higher the likelihood of clinically relevant depression. It has been widely validated and is considered the most reliable screening tool for depression [ 11 – 13 ]. Disease severity score  The utilised clinician-reported disease severity score is based on the presence or absence of 7 symptoms with major impact on the patient’s life. Per symptom 1 point is added and based on the total sum disease severity is divided into 3 levels: mild disease, moderate disease and severe disease (Fig.  2  [1]). This score was validated for internal consistency and correlation with clinical parameters, such as number of hospitalisations per year. The disease severity score was calculated for each patient based on medical records of the patients’ last admissions or out-patient presentations. Fig. 2 Disease severity score Ethics approval The study was approved by the local ethics committee and informed consent was obtained from all participating patients. Statistics NFTI-QOL-D scores were calculated and checked for internal consistency and correlation with patient-specific depression and disease severity scores.

PMID:38170419,Development of the PROMIS pediatric stigma and extension to the PROMIS pediatric stigma: skin item banks.,"PURPOSE: To develop the PROMIS Pediatric Stigma (PPS) and Skin (PPS-Skin) by constructing a common metric for measuring stigma in children with various conditions, while capturing the unique features of each condition. METHODS: Data from 860 children, ages 8-17, with a diagnosis of epilepsy, pNF (neurofibromatosis type 1 associated neurofibroma plexform), MD (muscular dystrophy), cancer, or skin conditions recruited from three projects were analyzed. Children with epilepsy, pNF and MD (sample-1) completed the original 18-item Neuro-QoL Stigma, while children with cancer and skin conditions (e.g., atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and genetic skin disorders; sample-2) completed a 16-item version and 6 additional skin related items. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory analysis (CFA) were used to evaluate unidimensionality of 24 stigma items. Differential item functioning (DIF) was used to evaluate measurement equivalence on group, gender, age, and conditions. Item response theory model (IRT) was used to construct the final measure. RESULTS: Sufficient unidimensionality was supported by both EFA and CFA. No items showed significant DIF indicating stable measurement properties across groups of comparison. All items fit the IRT model and were able to be calibrated together to form the PPS which consists of 18 core items. The PPS-Skin (18 cores items + 6 skin items) was developed by calibrating 6 skin items onto the common metric as the PPS. CONCLUSIONS: We used IRT techniques to successfully develop the PPS and the PPS-Skin, which share a common metric and account for unique and common concerns related to chronic conditions.","Methods Data from 860 children, ages 8–17, with a diagnosis of epilepsy, pNF (neurofibromatosis type 1 associated neurofibroma plexform), MD (muscular dystrophy), cancer, or skin conditions recruited from three projects were analyzed.

Methods This study was approved by Institutional Review Boards of Northwestern University and Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago. All participants provided informed consent prior to participating in the study. PROMIS pediatric stigma measure: expansion and refinement of the neuro-QoL pediatric stigma The initial Neuro-QoL Pediatric Stigma Item Bank consists of 18 items. A 5-point rating scale (1 = Never, 2 = Rarely, 3 = Sometimes, 4 = Often, 5 = Always) was used. Items in Neuro-QoL were reviewed for potential generalizability to a broader group of conditions. Item “I felt embarrassed about the way I talk” was considered not directly related to children with most non-neurologic conditions, and thus not included in this round of testing. To capture the gap related to skin conditions specifically based on literature review and clinical experiences, eight new items were written by the study team, including 8 pediatric dermatologists, a pediatric health psychologist, and experienced PRO researchers. These new items focused on assessing the stigma related to physical appearances visible to other persons, as well as the belief that a condition is contagious. All items were worded in a negative direction (i.e., higher scores meant more stigmatization). To maximize generalizability to children across various chronic conditions, we replaced the word “illness” with “condition”. Cognitive interviews of 25 items (17 Neuro-QoL and 8 newly written items) were conducted on 13 pediatric patients (ages 8 to 17 years) with either primary dermatologic conditions or cancer who had changes in their physical appearance or visible behavior considered potentially stigmatizing. Cognitive interviews (CI) were performed to assess the understanding and relevance of every item and response option, as well as the appropriateness of the timeframe. Directly prior to the CI, the participant independently completed the measure. Throughout the entire session, interviewers took detailed notes and all interviews were audio-recorded to ensure accuracy of the notes. In general, interviewees demonstrated understanding of all items. The timeframe of “lately”, however, was interpreted very differently among participants. Participants commented on the ambiguous nature of the word. Some participants responded in a timeframe of years, while others responded with reference to the past week. We thus clarified the timeframe from “lately” to “lately (in the last 1–2 months)” in order to provide a more specific, yet still flexible timeframe. Interviewees appropriately defined “condition”, which replaced “illness” in the Neuro-QOL Pediatric Stigma. Most participants defined it as “sickness, illness, disease or problem” or referred directly to the specific condition. No changes were made to response options as the response options (never, rarely, sometimes, often, and always) were well understood by interviewees. In terms of questions (item stem), three questions were removed from the final pool due to their redundant content determined by the study team. For the remaining 22 items, the majority of the interviewees felt that the questionnaire covered their experience or their child’s stigma-related experience. The length of the questionnaire was described as “just about right” by 9 of the 13 interviewees. Appropriate minor modifications on newly written items were made based on interviewees’ feedback. No additional cognitive interviews were required after modifications due to the minor nature of the changes. Thus, the refined item pool consisted of 22 items: the 16 original Neuro-QoL items that are common for children with various chronic conditions (thus, core items) and 6 skin condition-focused items that capture stigma related to physical appearance. Since this refined measure covers children beyond those with neurological conditions, we re-named this instrument the  PROMIS Pediatric Stigma Measure (PPS) . Sample and data sources Data obtained from 860 children aged 8–17 years were analyzed. We purposefully used this heterogeneous sample to improve the generalizability of the PPS Measure. This sample includes children and adolescents with epilepsy ( n  = 111, mean age of 13.5 years), neurofibromatosis type 1 with an associated plexiform neurofibroma (pNF;  n  = 140, 12.6 years), muscular dystrophy (MD;  n  = 60, 14.1 years), cancer ( n  = 82, 12.7 years) and various skin conditions ( n  = 467, mean age 12.5 years, with  n  = 328 atopic dermatitis/AD and  n  = 139 with psoriasis, epidermolysis bullosa, or ichthyosis). The children with cancer and skin conditions (i.e., sample-1,  n  = 549) were recruited between June and August 2017 via an internet panel company and the supportive groups for children with skin conditions as part of the PEPR study and completed the 22 questions of the PPS and PPS-Skin. Inclusion criteria were: ages 8–17 years, with a diagnosis of atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, epidermolysis bullosa, ichthyosis, or cancer. Data of children with epilepsy, MD and pNF (i.e., sample-2,  n  = 311) were from two existing databases [ 19 ,  20 ], in which the original 18-item Neuro-QoL pediatric stigma item bank had already been completed and thus were available for calibration. Data are publicly available in either Dataverse ( https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/HealthMeasures ; PEPR, epilepsy and MD) or NF Data Portal ( https://nf.synapse.org/ ). Analysis Evaluation of unidimensionality Figure 1  overviews the analyses taken for this paper, which followed the PROMIS methodology. Since the unidimensionality of the original Neuro-QoL Pediatric Stigma item bank was previously reported [ 13 ], we focused on whether the additional skin items impacted undimensionality of the refined measure using sample-1 (PEPR data). Data were randomly divided into two datasets: one for exploratory factor analysis (EFA; sample  n  = 273) and the other for confirmatory factor analysis (CFA; sample  n  = 276). In EFA, we explored the number of potential factors by evaluating number of factors with eigenvalue > 1; number of factors before the break in the scree plot; and 3) ratio of eigenvalue 1-to-2 (criterion: ≥ 4) [ 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 ]. A promax rotation with polychoric correlations was used to examine the association among factors and items and to examine item loadings (criterion: > 0.4). Bi-factor analysis [ 25 ], a family of confirmatory factor analysis, was used to evaluate sufficient unidimensionality when we took sub-domains into account. Bi-factor analysis specifies a general factor (defined by loadings from all included items) and local factors (or sub-domains, defined by loadings from pre-specified groups of items related to their sub-domains). Sufficient unidimensionality is supported when factor loadings to local factors are lower than those to the general factor and the bi-factor model has acceptable fit indices (i.e., CFI > 0.90; RMSEA < 0.10; R-squared > 0.30; residual correlations < 0.20). Additionally, variance explained by the general factor should be greater than that explained by local factors if sufficient unidimensionality is supported. Evaluation of psychometric properties using item response theory (IRT) There are two phases of IRT analyses: phase 1 was to calibrate the item parameters for the PPS (i.e., core items), and phase 2 was to finalize the PPS-Skin by linking skin items to the measurement continuum of the PPS. In phase 1, we estimated the PPS by modeling responses from all sample (sample-1 and sample-2) to 18 core items using an IRT model, the graded response model (GRM) [ 26 ]. Two items that were not administered to the sample-1 were treated as missing during IRT modeling. We defined item misfit as occurring when the item fit test ratio of Chi-squared to degrees of freedom was > 3.0 [ 27 ,  28 ]. Prior to finalizing parameters of core items, we investigated stability of measurement properties of items by evaluating differential item functioning (DIF). We first evaluated DIF on sample groups (sample-1 versus sample-2) to investigate whether refined item wording (from “illness” to “condition”) and narrowly defined timeframe (from “lately” to “lately (in the last 1–2 months)) impacted measurement properties of items. If no items showed sample group DIF, we then evaluated DIF on the following variables using the combined sample: gender (male versus female), age (8–12 years versus 13–17 years), and conditions (cancer vs. AD/eczema; non-AD skin condition vs. AD; pNF vs. AD; muscular dystrophy vs. AD; and epilepsy vs. AD). We used patients with AD as the reference group because of its larger sample size among all conditions. DIF was conducted using lordif [ 29 ], a hybrid logistic ordinal regression/IRT ability score framework. We flagged items for potential DIF if they had χ2 associated  p  < 0.01 and a Nagelkerke  pseudo-R-squared  value ≥ 0.20. We evaluated DIF “score impact” by comparing scores with and without DIF items. “Impact” is defined as differences between theta scores when all items were included versus when items with DIF were removed. The study team reviewed DIF results and determined whether items should be excluded from the final measure. In phase 2, we use a fixed parameter calibration approach [ 16 ,  30 ] to link skin items to the core items so that all item parameters are placed on the same metric. Specifically, skin items that were administered only to sample-1 were calibrated by fixing parameters of core items obtained in phase 1 IRT analysis. We used parameters of final items to estimate information functions at both the item and the measure levels. In IRT, information is the inversion of the standard error of estimates. Items with higher information function values (i.e., lower error and higher precision) were candidates to be included in a short form (SF). Multiple SFs could be created from an IRT-calibrated measures and their scores are comparable. In this study, we demonstrated SFs by selecting items with high information function (i.e., high precision). Scale information function is the accumulation of item information function, which were then transformed into IRT-based reliabilities. IRT-based reliability is estimated at the individual score-level, which is derived from a SE estimate (i.e., reciprocal of scale information), specifically IRT-based reliability  r  = 1−(SE) 2 . Unlike classical test theory based reliability where one reliability is derived per scale, IRT-based reliabilities vary across the measurement continuum. We focused on score range for people who report moderate/severe stigmatization. A reliability ≥ 0.70 was considered acceptable (Reeve et al., 2007). Finally, we compared perceived stigma reported by children with AD, cancer, pNF, epilepsy and MD descriptively. PPS and PPS-Skin are reported using the PROMIS T-Score metric, where mean = 50 and standard deviation = 10. Higher scores represent worse stigma.",Jin-Shei Lai; Cindy Nowinski; Stephanie M Rangel; Shalini Thareja Batra; Kelly Mueller; Sarah Chamlin; Vitali Ustsinovich; David Cella; Maxwell Mansolf; Amy S Paller,"Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",2024-03,10.1007/s11136-023-03574-z,minimal,True
PMID:22550514,Skin-derived precursor cells as an in vitro modelling tool for the study of type 1 neurofibromatosis.,"The most characteristic feature of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the development of neurofibromas. It has been suggested that these tumors are caused by somatic inactivation of the wild-type NF1 allele, but the cell that originally suffers this mutation remains controversial. Several lines of evidence support the clonal origin of these tumors, and it has been recently suggested that skin-derived precursor cells (SKPs) could be the cell of origin of dermal neurofibromas. Nullizygous (NF1(-/-)) SKPs do give rise to neurofibromas when transplanted to heterozygous mice. Moreover, a nullizygous population of cells that is S100β negative is present in human neurofibromas, and NF1(+/-) multipotent progenitor cells are seemingly recruited to the tumor. This evidence supports the neurofibroma stem cell hypothesis and a putative involvement of SKPs in the aetiopathogenesis of the disease, suggesting that SKPs could become a valuable tool for the in vitro study of NF1.",,Araika Gutiérrez-Rivera; Haizea Iribar; Anna Tuneu; Ander Izeta,Stem cells international,2012,10.1155/2012/646725,abstract_only,False
PMID:18188004,Real-time PCR analysis of candidate imprinted genes on mouse chromosome 11 shows balanced expression from the maternal and paternal chromosomes and strain-specific variation in expression levels.,"Imprinted genes are monoallelically expressed from either the maternal or paternal genome. Because cancer develops through genetic and epigenetic alterations, imprinted genes affect tumorigenesis depending on which parental allele undergoes alteration. We have shown previously in a mouse model of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) that inheriting mutant alleles of Nf1 and Trp53 on chromosome 11 from the mother or father dramatically changes the tumor spectrum of mutant progeny, likely due to alteration in an imprinted gene(s) linked to Nf1 and Trp53. In order to identify imprinted genes on chromosome 11 that are responsible for differences in susceptibility, we tested candidate imprinted genes predicted by a bioinformatics approach and an experimental approach. We have tested 30 candidate genes (Havcr2, Camk2b, Ccdc85a, Cntnap1, Ikzf1, 5730522E02Rik, Gria1, Zfp39, Sgcd, Jup, Nxph3, Spnb2, Asb3, Rasd1, Map2k3, Map2k4, Trp53, Serpinf1, Crk, Rasl10b, Itga3, Hoxb5, Cbx1, Pparbp, Igfbp4, Smarce1, Stat3, Atp6v0a1, Nbr1 and Meox1), two known imprinted genes (Grb10 and Impact) and Nf1, which has not been previously identified as an imprinted gene. Although we confirmed the imprinting of Grb10 and Impact, we found no other genes imprinted in the brain. We did, however, find strain-biased expression of Camk2b, 5730522E02Rik, Havcr2, Map2k3, Serpinf1, Rasl10b, Itga3, Asb3, Trp53, Nf1, Smarce1, Stat3, Cbx1, Pparbp and Cntnap1. These results suggest that the prediction of imprinted genes is complicated and must be individually validated.

We used wild-type F1 progeny from this cross for RNA and genomic DNA. To generate B6 maternal F1 hybrids, we crossed  Nf1 − /+;Trp53 − /+cis  females to wild-type A/J males, and used wild-type F1 progeny. We chose progeny matched for age and sex as much as possible given the available mice. The B6XA progeny were all males, the three B6 paternal cohort mice were euthanized at 2.1, 2.1, and 6.0 months of age and the three B6 maternal cohort mice were all euthanized at 3.3 months of age. To generate B6X129S4 F1 hybrids, 129S4- Nf1 − /+;Trp53 − /+cis  mice were crossed to wild-type B6. The B6X129S4 progeny were half males and half females. The four B6 paternal cohort mice were two females and two males all euthanized at 3.4 months of age. The four B6 maternal cohort mice were two females and two males all euthanized at 3.3 months of age. The 129S4- Nf1 − /+;Trp53 − /+cis  we used to generate the F1 hybrids have been maintained on inbred 129S4 since the generation of the knockout  Nf1  and  Trp53  alleles. 31 ,  32  The B6- Nf1 − /+;Trp53 − /+cis  we used to generate the B6XA/J F1 hybrids have been backcrossed approximately 30 generations onto C57BL/6J. We purchased wild-type A/J from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) Isolation of brain RNA and tail genomic DNA We euthanized mice by CO 2  asphyxiation and removed whole brains. The tissue was weighed and 100 mg was homogenized in Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using an Omni power homogenizer (Omni International, Marietta, GA). We isolated total RNA from the homogenized tissue using Trizol Reagent, following the manufacturer’s protocol. The isolated total RNA was quantified using a NanoDrop (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE). Prior to cDNA synthesis the total RNA was DNased-treated with DNAfree (Ambion, Austin, TX) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The cDNA was synthesized using Superscript II First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Genomic DNA was isolated from tails by digestion with proteinase K (100 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 5 mM EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 200 mM NaCl, 400 ug/ml proteinase K). After digestion, the genomic DNA was precipitated, resuspended in dH 2 O and treated with two rounds of phenol/chloroform purification. Taqman assay design SNPs predicted to be polymorphic between B6 and A/J or B6 and 129S1 or 129X1 for our genes of interest were chosen from the Jackson Laboratory Mouse Phenome Database SNP website ( http://phenome.jax.org/pub-cgi/phenome/mpdcgi?rtn=snps/wiz1 ). We designed Taqman assays for these SNPs using Assay-by-Design or Primer-Express software as described previously. 15  The SNP identification numbers from the NCBI dbSNP database and the primer sequences are given in  Supplemental Table 2 . We used a standard curve of mixtures of B6 DNA with either A/J DNA or 129S4 DNA to determine the percentage of B6 DNA in each sample. Briefly, we determined the third order polynomial function for each assay using the LINEST function in Excel or regression analysis in GraphPad Prism 4.0a with the percentage of B6 DNA in the standard curve and the Ct difference between the FAM and VIC probes. The Ct difference between the FAM and VIC probes from the experimental samples was then plugged into the polynomial equation to determine the percentage B6 DNA in the sample.

PMID:20826448,Reduced striatal dopamine underlies the attention system dysfunction in neurofibromatosis-1 mutant mice.,"Learning and behavioral abnormalities are among the most common clinical problems in children with the neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) inherited cancer syndrome. Recent studies using Nf1 genetically engineered mice (GEM) have been instructive for partly elucidating the cellular and molecular defects underlying these cognitive deficits; however, no current model has shed light on the more frequently encountered attention system abnormalities seen in children with NF1. Using an Nf1 optic glioma (OPG) GEM model, we report novel defects in non-selective and selective attention without an accompanying hyperactivity phenotype. Specifically, Nf1 OPG mice exhibit reduced rearing in response to novel objects and environmental stimuli. Similar to children with NF1, the attention system dysfunction in these mice is reversed by treatment with methylphenidate (MPH), suggesting a defect in brain catecholamine homeostasis. We further demonstrate that this attention system abnormality is the consequence of reduced dopamine (DA) levels in the striatum, which is normalized following either MPH or l-dopa administration. The reduction in striatal DA levels in Nf1 OPG mice is associated with reduced striatal expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limited enzyme in DA synthesis, without any associated dopaminergic cell loss in the substantia nigra. Moreover, we demonstrate a cell-autonomous defect in Nf1+/- dopaminergic neuron growth cone areas and neurite extension in vitro, which results in decreased dopaminergic cell projections to the striatum in Nf1 OPG mice in vivo. Collectively, these data establish abnormal DA homeostasis as the primary biochemical defect underlying the attention system dysfunction in Nf1 GEM relevant to children with NF1.",,Jacquelyn A Brown; Ryan J Emnett; Crystal R White; Carla M Yuede; Sara B Conyers; Karen L O'Malley; David F Wozniak; David H Gutmann,Human molecular genetics,2010-11-15,10.1093/hmg/ddq382,abstract_only,False
PMID:18769552,Frequent EGFR Positivity and Overexpression in High-Grade Areas of Human MPNSTs.,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs) are highly malignant and resistant. Transformation might implicate up regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Fifty-two MPNST samples were studied for EGFR, Ki-67, p53, and survivin expression by immunohistochemistry and for EGFR amplification by in situ hybridization. Results were correlated with clinical data. EGFR RNA was also quantified by RT-PCR in 20 other MPNSTs and 14 dermal neurofibromas. Half of the patients had a neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). EGFR expression, detected in 86% of MPNSTs, was more frequent in NF1 specimens and closely associated with high-grade and p53-positive areas. MPNSTs expressed more EGFR transcripts than neurofibromas. No amplification of EGFR locus was observed. NF1 status was the only prognostic factor in multivariate analysis, with median survivals of 18 and 43 months for patients with or without NF1. Finally, EGFR might become a new target for MPNSTs treatment, especially in NF1-associated MPNSTs.","2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1. Patients and samples Patients of the main series ( n  = 52) were all treated in
the Institut Gustave Roussy (IGR, Villejuif, France) between
1985 and 2005. Clinical records were reviewed by one of us (R. Bahleda), with
special attention to initial localization, NF1 status, treatment and survival.
Diagnosis of NF1 was established according to the NIH criteria [ 14 ]. Most of the patients had undergone surgery in another centre and were
secondary referred to IGR. Tumours were considered as local stage, when R0
surgery was performed initially, and locally advanced stage for R1 and R2
surgery. Only cases with paraffin embedded MPNST samples were included in the
study. Histological review was realized for all included patients by at least
two pathologists (PT, MJTL, JFE) on hematoxylin-eosin stained slides. Diagnosis
of MPNST was performed according to WHO criteria [ 15 ]. Grading of the tumours was not performed, due to limited amounts of
paraffin embedded samples. Immunostaining with S100 protein (rabbit polyclonal,
Dako, Carpenteria, Calif, USA)
and KIT (rabbit polyclonal, Dako) was performed when necessary to confirm
diagnosis. All 52 paraffin embedded samples were subjected to
immunohistochemistry; 8 of which were also analysed by FISH/CISH. Frozen samples from 20 other patients with MPNST were
used for the RNA analysis. Sixteen were from a previously published series [ 16 ] and four from Léon Bérard Centre (Lyon, France). Frozen control samples
from 14 patients with benign dermal neurofibromas were also analyzed. All samples were obtained from surgery performed for
diagnostic and/or therapeutic purpose, and were used according to French
ethical regulations. 2.2. Immunohistochemistry Immunohistochemistry was performed on four micron
sections from paraffin embedded tumour samples, after antigen retrieval by
heating at 95°C for 20 minutes in 10 mM citrate buffer pH6. For mouse monoclonal
anti-EGFR (31G7, Zymed, South San Francisco, Calif, USA, final dilution 1/10), P53 (DO-7,
Novocastra, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, final dilution 1/50), and anti-Ki-67 (Mib1 Dako, final dilution
1/50), staining was revealed with LSAB kit (Dako). For anti-Survivin (12C4,
Dako, final dilution 1/100) staining was revealed with CSAII (Dako), according
to manufacturer's instruction. For EGFR staining, tumour cells were considered
negative, when positive signals were detected on nontumour cells (usually
spindle cells and/or small nerves in the periphery of the tumours); otherwise,
staining was considered as not interpretable. 2.3. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) Eight paraffin embedded samples of the main series
were analyzed for EGFR amplification. EGFR specific sequence probe (LSI EGFR)
and control chromosome enumeration probe 7 (CEP7) were used according to the
manufacturers' recommended protocol (Vysis-Abbott Molecular Diagnostics, Baar, Switzerland),
but with some minor modifications. The DNA probes and the sections of tissues
were denatured at 85°C for 5 minutes using a HYBrite instrument. An additional wash in distilled water
was added before counterstaining and mounting with a solution of 4,
6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The results are reported as the ratio of
average EGFR/CEP7 signals per nucleus. Signal ratios of <2 were classified
as nonamplified (NA) and ≥2 as amplified (A). In each section, at least 30
nuclei were counted for signals. 2.4. Chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) CISH experiments were performed, according to the
protocol given by the supplier (Zymed), along with FISH to have more
information about sample morphology and to have a permanent signal. Results
were interpreted as indicated above for FISH. 2.5. Real-time PCR The
theoretical and practical aspects of real-time quantitative RT-PCR using the
ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif, USA) have been described in detail elsewhere [ 16 ]. The precise amount of total RNA added to each reaction
mix (based on optical density) and its quality (i.e., lack of extensive
degradation) are both difficult to assess. We therefore also quantified
transcripts of the endogenous RNA control gene  TBP  (Genbank accession  NM_003194 ), which encodes the TATA
box-binding protein. Each sample was normalized on the basis of its  TBP  content. Results, expressed as
N-fold differences in target gene expression relative to the  TBP  gene, and termed
“Ntarget,” were determined as Ntarget = 2Δ Ctsample , where the Δ Ct  value of the sample was
determined by subtracting the average Ct value of the target gene from the
average Ct value of the  TBP  gene. The N target  values of the samples were subsequently
normalized such that the mean of the dermal neurofibroma N target  values
was 1. 2.6. Statistical analysis Quantitative data were expressed as mean ± standard
deviation; qualitative data as frequency and percent. Comparisons of means were
performed using Student's  t -test or Mann and Whitney nonparametric test
when necessary. Comparisons of frequencies were performed using the Chi square
test, or Fisher's exact test when necessary. Log-rank tests were used to examine the relationship
between overall survival and the following variables: age, gender, initial localization,
NF1 status, and EGFR expression. Variables with a statistical  P  value <.20 were entered into a Cox model multivariate analysis.  P  value
less than 0.05 was considered significant in multivariate analysis. Statistical analyses were performed with the SAS 8.2
software package (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA).",Séverine Tabone-Eglinger; Radislav Bahleda; Jean-François Côté; Philippe Terrier; Dominique Vidaud; Anne Cayre; Alain Beauchet; Nathalie Théou-Anton; Marie-José Terrier-Lacombe; Antoinette Lemoine; Frédérique Penault-Llorca; Axel Le Cesne; Jean-François Emile,Sarcoma,2008,10.1155/2008/849156,minimal,True
PMID:34428430,Treatment during a developmental window prevents NF1-associated optic pathway gliomas by targeting Erk-dependent migrating glial progenitors.,"The mechanism of vulnerability to pediatric low-grade gliomas (pLGGs)-the most common brain tumor in children-during development remains largely unknown. Using mouse models of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated pLGGs in the optic pathway (NF1-OPG), we demonstrate that NF1-OPG arose from the vulnerability to the dependency of Mek-Erk/MAPK signaling during gliogenesis of one of the two developmentally transient precursor populations in the optic nerve, brain-derived migrating glial progenitors (GPs), but not local progenitors. Hyperactive Erk/MAPK signaling by Nf1 loss overproduced GPs by disrupting the balance between stem-cell maintenance and gliogenesis of hypothalamic ventricular zone radial glia (RG). Persistence of RG-like GPs initiated NF1-OPG, causing Bax-dependent apoptosis in retinal ganglion cells. Removal of three Mek1/Mek2 alleles or transient post-natal treatment with a low-dose MEK inhibitor normalized differentiation of Nf1",,Emmanuelle S Jecrois; Wang Zheng; Miriam Bornhorst; Yinghua Li; Daniel M Treisman; Daphine Muguyo; Sharon Huynh; Shayne F Andrew; Yuan Wang; Jingwen Jiang; Brianna R Pierce; Hongmei Mao; Matthew K Krause; Austin Friend; Francisco Nadal-Nicolas; Steven F Stasheff; Wei Li; Hui Zong; Roger J Packer; Yuan Zhu,Developmental cell,2021-10-25,10.1016/j.devcel.2021.08.004,abstract_only,False
PMID:18242512,Induction of abnormal proliferation by nonmyelinating schwann cells triggers neurofibroma formation.,"Recent evidence suggests that alterations in the self-renewal program of stem/progenitor cells can cause tumorigenesis. By utilizing genetically engineered mouse models of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), we demonstrated that plexiform neurofibroma, the only benign peripheral nerve sheath tumor with potential for malignant transformation, results from Nf1 deficiency in fetal stem/progenitor cells of peripheral nerves. Surprisingly, this did not cause hyperproliferation or tumorigenesis in early postnatal period. Instead, peripheral nerve development appeared largely normal in the absence of Nf1 except for abnormal Remak bundles, the nonmyelinated axon-Schwann cell unit, identified in postnatal mutant nerves. Subsequent degeneration of abnormal Remak bundles was accompanied by initial expansion of nonmyelinating Schwann cells. We suggest abnormally differentiated Remak bundles as a cell of origin for plexiform neurofibroma.",,Huarui Zheng; Lou Chang; Neha Patel; Jiong Yang; Lori Lowe; Dennis K Burns; Yuan Zhu,Cancer cell,2008-02,10.1016/j.ccr.2008.01.002,abstract_only,False
PMID:18988803,Ras signaling influences permissiveness of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor cells to oncolytic herpes.,"Lack of expression of neurofibromin in neurofibromatosis 1 and its lethal derivative, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), is thought to result in the overactivation of the Ras signaling pathway. Our previous studies have shown that cells with overactivation in the Ras pathway are more permissive to infection with herpes simplex virus 1 and its mutant version R3616. In this study, we show that among five different mouse MPNST cell lines, only the ones with elevated levels of Ras signaling are highly permissive to infection with oncolytic herpes G207. Specific inhibitors of the Ras, ERK, and JNK pathways all reduced the synthesis of viral proteins in MPNST cells. The cell lines that contained lower levels of Ras and decreased activation of downstream signaling components underwent an enhancement in apoptosis upon exposure to G207. Additionally, mouse SW10 Schwann cells were able to become infected by parental herpes but were found to be resistant to G207. The immortalization of these cell lines with the expression of SV40 large T antigen increased the levels of Ras activation and permissiveness to oncolytic herpes. A Ras/Raf kinase inhibitor reduced the synthesis of both herpes simplex virus-1 and G207 proteins in SW10 cells. The results of this study, therefore, introduce Ras signaling as a divergent turning point for the response of MPNST cells to an assault by oncolytic herpes.",,Faris Farassati; Weihong Pan; Farnaz Yamoutpour; Susann Henke; Mark Piedra; Silke Frahm; Said Al-Tawil; Wells I Mangrum; Luis F Parada; Samuel D Rabkin; Robert L Martuza; Andreas Kurtz,The American journal of pathology,2008-12,10.2353/ajpath.2008.080376,abstract_only,False
PMID:34573290,Performance Evaluation of SpliceAI for the Prediction of Splicing of ,"Neurofibromatosis type 1, characterized by neurofibromas and café-au-lait macules, is one of the most common genetic disorders caused by pathogenic ","4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Study Subjects We retrospectively analyzed the gDNA and cDNA variants identified from 653 patients tested for  NF1  sequencing between January 2006 and December 2020. In accordance with the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathology guideline [ 38 ],  NF1  variants were classified into three categories ( Table S1 ): (1) pathogenic variant (PV)/likely PV (LPV), (2) variant of uncertain significance (VUS), and (3) benign variant (BV)/likely BV (LBV). During categorization, allele frequencies were reviewed using gnomAD (v2.1.1,  https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/ , accessed on 1 July 2021). Previous reports of  NF1  variants were reviewed using Human Genome Variation Database (HGMD ®  Professional release 2021.2,  https://my.qiagendigitalinsights.com/bbp/view/hgmd/pro/start.php , accessed on 1 July 2021), ClinVar ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ , accessed on 1 July 2021), and Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD;  https://databases.lovd.nl/shared/variants/NF1 , accessed on 1 July 2021). Functional study was performed using cDNA and gDNA sequencing analysis (see  Section 4.2 ). The following  NF1  cDNA or gDNA variants were excluded: (1) variants with unsatisfactory quality or insufficient variant information in cDNA and/or gDNA sequencing analysis, (2) benign mRNA transcripts in RT-PCR, and (3) mRNA variants with no identifiable corresponding gDNA variant, and (4) gDNA variants for which SpliceAI Δ Score could not be obtained in the range of 0–1 (variants other than SNVs or simple INDELs, see  Section 4.3 ). Our study workflow and the number of excluded cDNA/gDNA variants are shown in  Figure 3 . Based on the exclusion criteria above, 285 unique gDNA variants of  NF1  were included for the evaluation, including 73 splice variants (proven by cDNA and/or gDNA sequencing analysis). Among the 285 variants, 235, 30, and 20 were PVs/LPVs (including all 73 splice variants), VUSs, and BVs/LBVs, respectively ( Figure 3 ). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea (protocol code 2021-05-122, approved on 6 July 2021). 4.2. Complementary DNA and Genomic DNA Sequencing Peripheral blood samples were collected in a vacuum tube containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid as a preservative and gDNA and RNA were extracted from leukocytes. DNA was extracted using a Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The concentration and purity of the DNA were measured using NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The RNA was extracted with TRIzol methods and 1 µg of samples were reverse transcribed using Thermo Scientific RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). RT-PCR and cDNA sequencing were performed to screen altered splicing and coding region variants of  NF1 . Amplification of  NF1  cDNA was performed through 24 overlapping fragments using the GeneAmp PCR System 9700 Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The primer sets for gDNA and cDNA amplification were based on previous report from our institution [ 30 ], which are listed in  Supplementary Tables S2 and S3 , respectively. Cyclic sequencing was performed using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems), and sequence traces were obtained on an ABI 3730xl DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Sequence variations were detected through Sequencher software (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). If a variant or exon skipping was detected in the cDNA sequence analysis, the involved exon and flanking intronic regions of gDNA were sequenced using gDNA to identify the corresponding DNA variant that caused splicing alterations. The reference sequence for alignment and variant detection was based on  NM_001042492.2 , the longest isoform for  NF1 . Variants were described according to the HGVS guidelines ( http://varnomen.hgvs.org/ , accessed on 1 July 2021) [ 39 ]. 4.3. Splicing Prediction SpliceAI, a web-based interface ( https://spliceailookup.broadinstitute.org/# , accessed on 1 July 2021), was used for splicing prediction. The Δ Score, the maximum probability of splicing where a variant affects the gain or loss of acceptor or donor sites, was obtained for each variant using default parameters. The Δ Scores could be obtained only in SNVs and  simple  INDELs; reference or alternative allele in the reference genome is a single base. More detailed information on the Δ Score has been previously described [ 14 ]. For the comparison of the performance of the SpliceAI with other  in silico  splicing prediction tools, MES [ 16 ] and SSF [ 17 ], two commonly used algorithms, were conducted using Alamut ®  Visual v.2.15 software (SOPHiA GENETICS, Saint-Sulpice, Switzerland). According to the previous recommendations [ 18 , 40 ], variants were considered as positive for splicing alteration based on the following: (1) MES predicted >15% reduction of the score of the natural splice site AND SSF predicted >5%, or (2) a new splice site was created. If a variant was not placed within the Cartegni region (i.e., 11 bases for the 5′ splice site; from the last 3 exonic to the first 8 intronic bases, and 14 bases for the 3’ splice site; from the last 12 intronic to the first 2 exonic bases) [ 41 ], we only applied SSF prediction as mentioned above. 4.4. Statistical Analysis Using the Δ Scores from SpliceAI, ROC curve analysis was conducted based on the method developed by Hanley and McNeil [ 15 ]. The optimal cut-off value of Δ Scores was obtained from ROC curve analysis. In further analysis, a single  NF1  variant was defined as SpliceAI prediction “positive” when the SpliceAI Δ Score of the variant was above the cut-off value. PPA, NPA, kappa coefficient, and their 95% CIs were calculated to compare the agreement between SpliceAI and other  in silico  tools (MES/SSF) for predicting the splice effect of the variants. The sensitivity and specificity of SpliceAI and MES/SSF were calculated against the splicing effect using cDNA and gDNA sequencing analysis results. McNemar’s test was used to compare the sensitivity and specificity between SpliceAI and MES/SSF for splice prediction. Using Δ Scores (SpliceAI) and reduction ratio (MES/SSF), pairwise comparison of ROC curves between SpliceAI and MES/SSF were also performed. Statistical analyses were performed using MedCalc Statistical Software version 19.0.5 (MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium).  p  < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",Changhee Ha; Jong-Won Kim; Ja-Hyun Jang,Genes,2021-08-25,10.3390/genes12091308,minimal,True
PMID:22811580,Ras-driven transcriptome analysis identifies aurora kinase A as a potential malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor therapeutic target.,"PURPOSE: Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) develop malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST), which are often inoperable and do not respond well to current chemotherapies or radiation. The goal of this study was to use comprehensive gene expression analysis to identify novel therapeutic targets. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Nerve Schwann cells and/or their precursors are the tumorigenic cell types in MPNST because of the loss of the NF1 gene, which encodes the RasGAP protein neurofibromin. Therefore, we created a transgenic mouse model, CNP-HRas12V, expressing constitutively active HRas in Schwann cells and defined a Ras-induced gene expression signature to drive a Bayesian factor regression model analysis of differentially expressed genes in mouse and human neurofibromas and MPNSTs. We tested functional significance of Aurora kinase overexpression in MPNST in vitro and in vivo using Aurora kinase short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) and compounds that inhibit Aurora kinase. RESULTS: We identified 2,000 genes with probability of linkage to nerve Ras signaling of which 339 were significantly differentially expressed in mouse and human NF1-related tumor samples relative to normal nerves, including Aurora kinase A (AURKA). AURKA was dramatically overexpressed and genomically amplified in MPNSTs but not neurofibromas. Aurora kinase shRNAs and Aurora kinase inhibitors blocked MPNST cell growth in vitro. Furthermore, an AURKA selective inhibitor, MLN8237, stabilized tumor volume and significantly increased survival of mice with MPNST xenografts. CONCLUSION: Integrative cross-species transcriptome analyses combined with preclinical testing has provided an effective method for identifying candidates for molecular-targeted therapeutics. Blocking Aurora kinases may be a viable treatment platform for MPNST.","Experimental Design Nerve Schwann cells and/or their precursors are the tumorigenic cell types in MPNST due to the loss of the NF1 gene, which encodes the RasGAP protein neurofibromin. Therefore, we created a transgenic mouse model, CNP-HRas12V, expressing constitutively-active HRas in Schwann cells and defined a Ras-induced gene expression signature to drive a Bayesian factor regression model analysis of differentially expressed genes in mouse and human neurofibromas and MPNSTs. We tested functional significance of Aurora kinase over-expression in MPNST  in vitro  and  in vivo  using Aurora kinase shRNAs and compounds that inhibit Aurora kinase. Materials and Methods CNP-HRas12V expression analysis The CNP-HRas12V data set consisted of 8 control nerves encompassing 2 genotypes (4 Nf1 flox/flox; 4 P0CreB) and 6 CNP-HRas12V nerves. All statistical comparisons and data visualization were performed using GeneSpring GX v7.3.1 (Agilent Technologies). All statistical tests were corrected for multiple testing effects by applying the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate correction. We used a T-Test and FDR ≤ 0.01 to compare groups. Bayesian sparse latent class factor modeling Gene orthologs of transcripts differentially expressed in CNP-HRas12V peripheral nerves were used as seeds in a Bayesian factor regression modeling analysis. The model includes 6 categorical responses: four species-specific tumor states (mouse neurofibroma, mouse MPNST, human neurofibroma, human MPNST) and two species-independent tumor states (neurofibroma, MPNST). By design, the 6 categorical factors are associated with the phenotypic outcome of NF1 tumor progression. Using a threshold of 0.85 for factor inclusion probability and 0.95 for variable inclusion probability, and constraining such that a minimum of 10 genes are required to exceed the factor threshold to include that factor in an expanded model, the analysis terminated with a model on 2000 gene orthologs distributed across k = 100 latent factors and 6 categorical response factors. Gene interaction network A total of 339 gene orthologs from the 2,000 genes linked to Ras signaling as determined by Bayesian factor regression modeling analysis were also identified as similarly regulated transcripts using frequentist statistics ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). We used GeneGo’s MetaCore to construct a gene interaction network using the direct interactions network building algorithm, which resulted in a single multi-node connected network of 85 gene orthologs. AURKA locus copy number analysis For SNP-array analysis, raw data from Illumina’s cnv370-duo and h660w-quad SNP array chips were processed using GenomeStudio (Ilumina). B-allele frequency (BAF) and Log Ratio (LRR) were calculated using the reference cluster file provided by Illumina. qPCR analysis of DNA,  AURKA  gene amplification was determined by quantitative PCR performed on a LightCycler® 480 Instrument (Roche Applied Science), using Universal Probe Library (UPL) technology. A total number of 37 samples were analyzed: 13 MPNSTs, 5 MPNST-derived cell lines, 8 neurofibromas and 11 normal samples (which presented a diploid status of AURKA and were used as controls). For additional details see  Supplementary Materials and Methods . Lentiviral shRNA infection MPNST cell lines were cultured as described ( 8 ,  18 ). For lentiviral shRNA infection, MPNST cells at 50 – 60% confluence were infected with lentiviral particles containing shRNAs targeting  AURKA, AURKB  or shNon-targeting (SigmaAldrich; TRC library). The CCHMC Viral Vector Core produced virus using a 4-plasmid packaging system ( http://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/research/div/exp-hematology/translational/vpf/vvc/default.htm ). Lentiviral particles were incubated with MPNST cells (MOI ~ 10) in the presence of polybrene (8 μg/mL; Sigma) for 24 hours followed by selection in 2 μg/mL puromycin. Quantitative real time PCR (QRT)-PCR Total RNA was isolated from cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and used as a template for cDNA synthesis (High-Capacity cDNA archive kit, Applied Biosystems) and QRT-PCR (ABI 7500 Sequence Detection System) as described ( 8 ). Primers for AurkA were forward-TAGCCTTCAAGTGCCAGAGTGTGT and reverse-ACAAGACCCTGAATGGGTGTCACT and for AurkB forward-TGAGGAGGAAGACAATGTGTGGCA and reverse-AGGTCTCGTTGTGTGATGCACTCT. Western Analysis Cell lysates were created and Western blotting conducted as described ( 8 ), membranes were probed with several different antibodies including anti-AurkA antibodies (Cell Signalling Technology Inc., #3092), anti-AurkB antibody (Cell Signalling Technology Inc., #3094), anti-Histone 3 (Cell Signalling Technology Inc., #9715), anti-p-Histone 3 (Cell Signalling Technology Inc., #9701), anti-PARP (Cell Signalling Technology Inc., #9542) and then, stripped and re-probed with anti-β-actin antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. #4967) as a loading control. Signals were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (BioRad; Hercules, CA) and the ECL Plus developing system (Amersham Biosciences; Piscataway, NJ). In vitro cytotoxicity assay MPNST cell lines were plated in quadruplicate for each dose of Aurora kinase inhibitor on 96-well plates at 500 cells per well in serum-containing growth medium. Plates were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . 24hr after plating, cells were treated with carrier alone (10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) in DMEM) or inhibitors (LC laboratories, MA). MLN8237 compound was provided by Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Landsdowne Street, Cambridge, MA 02139. The amount of proliferation was quantified at 2 and 4 days post addition of drug by a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS) assay using Cell titer 96 proliferation kit (Promega). Absorbance was read at 490 nm in a Spectramax M2 plate reader (Molecular Devices). MPNST xenograft The subcutaneous  NF1−/−  S462-TY human MPNST xenograft model has been previously described ( 18 ). S462TY MPNST cells (1.8 × 10 6 ) from an NF1 patient were injected into four to five week old female nude mice (Harlan; Indianapolis, IN). Administration and dose of MLN8237 was determined by previous animal studies ( 19 ). Oral gavage of vehicle that constituted of 10% 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (Fisher Scientific)/1% sodium bicarbonate (Sigma Aldrich) in sterile water or 20 mg/kg MLN8237 in vehicle was given twice daily Monday through Friday and once daily Saturday and Sunday beginning when tumors reached 250mm 3 . We measured tumors and weighed mice twice weekly. Tumor volume was calculated by: L * W2 (π/6), where L is the longest diameter and W is the width. Mice were treated until tumors reached 2500 mm 3  or a maximum of 66 days. Control tumors (9/11) reached 2500mm 3  by day 66 of treatment. The remaining 2 mice were >1800 mm 3  and actively growing. Survival was analyzed by log-rank test using GraphPad Prism. Pharmacokinetics Blood was collected by cardiac puncture in non-tumor bearing mice. Blood was drawn at 2, 4, and 16 hours after dosing from 3 – 5 mice per time point. Plasma was separated by centrifugation at 2200 × g for 10 minutes and MLN8237 concentration quantified by LC/MS/MS ( 19 ,  20 ). Immunohistochemistry Teased sciatic nerves from adult wild type or CNP-HRAS12v mice were prepared for immune labeling as described ( 21 ). Schwann cells were labeled with anti-S100β antibodies (Dako, Carpenteria, CA) followed by FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies (green); expression of the HA-tagged CNP-HRAS12V transgene was detected with anti-HA antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) followed by TRITC-conjugated secondary antibodies (red). Paraffin sections were de-paraffinized, hydrated and transferred to 0.1M citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for antigen retrieval. Slides were boiled for 10′ in citrate buffer, cooled at room temperature for 30 minutes, rinsed in water twice and in PBS 3 times. Sections were quenched with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes, rinsed in PBS, and blocked in 10% normal goat serum with 0.3% Triton-X-100. Sections were incubated overnight in primary antibody; rabbit cleaved caspase-3 (1:8000, Cell Signaling, #9661), rabbit p-histone 3 (1:800, Cell Signaling, #9701), Rabbit Ki-67 (1:5000 NCL-Ki67-P; Novocastra), rabbit cyclinB1 (1:500, Cell Signaling, #4138).

PMID:26657314,Immortalized Human Schwann Cell Lines Derived From Tumors of Schwannomatosis Patients.,"Schwannomatosis, a rare form of neurofibromatosis, is characterized predominantly by multiple, often painful, schwannomas throughout the peripheral nervous system. The current standard of care for schwannomatosis is surgical resection. A major obstacle to schwannomatosis research is the lack of robust tumor cell lines. There is a great need for mechanistic and drug discovery studies of schwannomatosis, yet appropriate tools are not currently available. Schwannomatosis tumors are difficult to grow in culture as they survive only a few passages before senescence. Our lab has extensive experience in establishing primary and immortalized human Schwann cell cultures from normal tissue that retain their phenotypes after immortalization. Therefore we took on the challenge of creating immortalized human Schwann cell lines derived from tumors from schwannomatosis patients. We have established and fully characterized 2 schwannomatosis cell lines from 2 separate patients using SV40 virus large T antigen. One patient reported pain and the other did not. The schwannomatosis cell lines were stained with S100B antibodies to confirm Schwann cell identity. The schwannomatosis cells also expressed the Schwann cell markers, p75NTR, S100B, and NGF after multiple passages. Cell morphology was retained following multiple passaging and freeze/ thaw cycles. Gene expression microarray analysis was used to compare the cell lines with their respective parent tumors. No differences in key genes were detected, with the exception that several cell cycle regulators were upregulated in the schwannomatosis cell lines when compared to their parent tumors. This upregulation was apparently a product of cell culturing, as the schwannomatosis cells exhibited the same expression pattern of cell cycle regulatory genes as normal primary human Schwann cells. Cell growth was also similar between normal primary and immortalized tumor cells in culture. Accurate cell lines derived directly from human tumors will serve as invaluable tools for advancing schwannomatosis research, including drug screening.","Materials and Methods Tissue Specimens Schwannomatosis tumors were collected from surgical cases from December 2012 through October 2014, occurring at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Schwannoma diagnosis was confirmed by Pathology. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. After collection, the tumor specimen was placed in saline for transport to the lab. In a laminar flow hood, a section of the tumor (~0.5 cm 3 ) was finely minced. The minced tumor was placed in into a new sterile 15mL conical tube containing 4ml L-15 media, and 10mg/ml collagenase/dispase. The tumor was incubated for 3 hours at 37°C to dissociate the cells. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 2 min and the cell pellet was washed twice with 5ml of L-15 media. After the final wash the cell pellet was resuspended in in 1 mL of L15 and DNase solution (10mg/ml). The suspended cells were passed through a 70 uM cell strainer, to remove unwanted debris. The strainer was washed with an additional 3ml of L-15/DNase solution to increase cell yield. The collected cells were centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 10 minutes. The cell pellet was suspended in 1mL of the human Schwann cell medium (Sciencell). The cells were plated in a poly-l-lysine coated T25 flask. 2–3 days after initial plating the media on the cells was changed to high glucose DMEM/pen strep, plus 10% fetal bovine serum, 2μM forskolin, and 20ng/ml neuregulin. Cultures were maintained in this media until the reached 80% confluence, at which time the cells were split into three T-25 flasks or frozen (in DMEM +20% FBS+ 10% DMSO) for later use. Cell Immortalization Cells were immortalized using pLenti-SV40 from ABM (catalog number G203) according to manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, cells at passage 3 were infected with 2 ml/well of viral supernatant in the presence of 5μg/ml Polybrene, in the morning. 6–8 hours later, the viral supernatant from first infection was removed from the wells and the cells were re-infected with 2 ml/well of fresh supernatant/ polybrene. The next day, viral supernatant was removed and replaced with complete growth medium. The cells were incubated at 37°C for ~72 hours incubation and subcultured. After subculturing the cells were screened for the SV40 transgene by qRT-PCR as per manufacturer’s instructions ( www.abmgood.com/SV40-Cell-Immortalization.html#8 ) SV40 Forward Primer Sequence 5’ ACTGAGGGGCCTGAAATGA; SV40 Reverse Primer Sequence 5’ GACTCAGGGCATGAAACAGG. The product size is 61 bp. Microarray RNA from SWN tumor samples, SWN cell lines, and normal primary Human Schwann cells were analyzed using the Illumina Human HT-12 microarray covering more than 47,000 transcripts and known splice variants. Differences in expression between the two groups were identified using the Ingenuity iReport software, and Nexus Gene expression software. Genes that are upregulated or downregulated at least 2 fold and p<0.05 were considered differentially expression. RNA extraction Tumor tissues were homogenized using the polytron PT1300 tissue homogenizer followed by additional homogenization using a Qiashredder spin column (Qiagen). RNA DNA and protein were extracted using the Allprep extraction kit (Qiagen). RNA from cells in culture was extracted using Trizol, followed by clean up with RNeasy RNA extraction kit (Qiagen). cDNA 1ug of total RNA was converted to cDNA using the Quantitect Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen). qPCR Primers B2M, GAPDH, SMARCB1, p75/NGFR, NGF, S100B, CCNA2, CCNB1, CCNB2, CCND1, CCNF, and CDC20 were purchased from Qiagen. Amplified bands were analyzed for correct size and sequenced by the Johns Hopkins Sequencing core to assure correct targets. qPCR One microliter of each tumor, cell line, and normal primary human Schwann cell cDNA, was used for real-time qRT-PCR using QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen). Amplifications were carried out in 96 well plates in a Roche Lightcycler. All reactions were performed in triplicate. Dissociation curve analysis was performed to rule out experimental PCR artifacts or non-specific amplification. Expression of genes relative to Beta-2-Microglobulin (B2M) or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was calculated based on the threshold cycle (C t ) as 2 −Δ(ΔCt) , where  Δ C t  = C t,

PMID:34604751,Feasibility of magnetic resonance-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound treatment targeting distinct nodular lesions in neurofibromatosis type 1.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) and plexiform neurofibromas (PN) often have radiographically diagnosed distinct nodular lesions (DNL) which can cause pain and weakness. Magnetic resonance-guided high intensity focused ultrasound (MR-HIFU) can precisely and accurately deliver heat to thermally ablate target tissue. The aim of this study is to evaluate whole-body MRIs from patients with NF1 and DNL, applying volumetrics and a consistent treatment planning approach to determine the feasibility of MR-HIFU ablation of DNL. METHODS: A retrospective review of whole-body MRI scans from patients with NF1 and PN from CNH and NCI was performed. DNL are defined as lesions >3 cm, distinct from PN and lacking the ""central dot"" feature. Criteria for MR-HIFU thermal ablation include target location 1-8 cm from skin surface; >1 cm from visible plexus, spinal canal, bladder, bowel, physis; and ability to ablate ≥50% of lesion volume. Lesions in skull and vertebral body were excluded. RESULTS: In 26 patients, 120 DNL were identified. The majority of DNL were located in an extremity (52.5%). Other sites included head/neck (7%), chest (13%), and abdomen/pelvis (28%). The predefined HIFU ablation criteria was not met for 47.5% of lesions ( CONCLUSION: Based on imaging review of lesion location, technical considerations and ability to target lesions, thermal ablation with MR-HIFU may be a feasible noninvasive alternative for symptom management in patients with NF1 and symptomatic DNL.","Methods A retrospective review of whole-body MRI scans from patients with NF1 and PN from CNH and NCI was performed. DNL are defined as lesions >3 cm, distinct from PN and lacking the “central dot” feature. Criteria for MR-HIFU thermal ablation include target location 1–8 cm from skin surface; >1 cm from visible plexus, spinal canal, bladder, bowel, physis; and ability to ablate ≥50% of lesion volume. Lesions in skull and vertebral body were excluded. Materials and Methods Study Subjects The Gilbert Family Neurofibromatosis Institute at Children’s National Hospital (CNH), Washington, DC sees approximately 750 pediatric and young adult patients with NF1 yearly. The Pediatric Oncology Branch (POB) at National Cancer Institute (NCI), Bethesda, MD is an international referral center and leading NF center with a large patient population. This is a retrospective review of MRI images from NF1 patients with plexiform neurofibroma(s) who had whole-body MRIs. Patients from CNH were enrolled on clinical trial NCT03820778 evaluating the use of whole-body MRI for identifying ANNUBP in patients with NF1. These patients had high plexiform tumor burden defined as ≥1 PN that was >3 cm in diameter. Patients from NCI were enrolled on clinical trial NCT00924196, a natural history study of patients with NF1. Patients selected from this study were those with known DNL identified on MRI and representing a cohort to cover a range of sizes, location and anatomy. Patients enrolled met the NIH diagnostic criteria for NF1. MRI scans occurred between 2010 and 2019. Twenty-six patients were identified and included in this study. Only one whole-body MRI per patient was evaluated without prior or subsequent MRIs for comparison due to availability of whole-body MRIs per patient on study. The protocols were approved by respective institutional review boards. Informed consent was obtained from all patients/guardians. DNL and MR-HIFU Criteria DNL are defined as lesions ≥3 cm in largest dimension, distinct from plexiform neurofibroma and lacking the “central dot” feature.  MR-HIFU ablation criteria is based on a consensus of safety measures felt to reduce risk in clinical trials. 10 , 15 , 18  Also, while different MR-HIFU systems exist with varying design specifications to treat targets in different locations, for the purpose of this study, we will be basing criteria for treatment on the clinical MR-HIFU system available at CNH (Profound Sonalleve V2; Profound Medical Inc., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). 19 , 20 Lesions were considered either targetable (greater than 50% ablation feasible) or not targetable. Criteria for a targetable lesion included targets >1 cm and <8 cm from skin surface with a beam path that was not obstructed by intervening bone or air-tissue interfaces such as lung and bowel. Target lesions also had to be >1 cm from major neurovascular bundle, plexus, spinal canal, bladder, bowel, and open physis. Lesions were considered not targetable if located in the head and neck due to proximity to critical structures and limited institutional experience. Lesions in the chest and abdominal cavities were considered not targetable due to the impact of motion from respiration and peristalsis on ability to perform accurate temperature monitoring, as well as acoustic shadowing, or inability to treat through gas-containing structures such as lungs and bowel. Exceptions included axillary lesions that extend from the upper extremity into chest cavity and one posterior lesion in the superior aspect of chest cavity due to minimal impact from respiration. The partial ablation cut off of 50% was decided upon by a consensus of our team of experts as a benchmark of what we could measure to say a lesion was accessible by HIFU. DNL Identification and Measurement Osirix software (Pixmeo SARL; v10.0.0) was used for all evaluations and measurements. Whole-body MRIs were closely examined, identifying all lesions meeting criteria for DNL. Lesions were reviewed and confirmed to be DNL by a team of radiologists and oncologists. Digital calipers were used to measure all lesions in both axial and coronal planes. The median longest diameter of all lesions was calculated. Treatment Planning for MR-HIFU Thermal Ablation For lesions which met predefined criteria and threshold to be considered targetable, volumetric analysis and treatment planning were performed. Volumetric analysis was performed using Osirix software. Total tumor volume (TTV) was measured by outlining the DNL margins on each axial MRI slice showing tumor. Each lesion was individually evaluated for complete or partial ablation using digital calipers to measure the closest distance from edge of tumor to skin surface, major neurovascular bundle and nearby gas-containing organs. A line of treatment, representing the proposed treatment beam, was placed over axial planes in direction of desired treatment approach ( Figure 1 ). Approach was based on best angle and beam path to avoid obstruction, limit effect on nearby structures and effectively treat the largest percentage of tumor. Treatment planning was reviewed by a team including interventional radiology, engineering, oncology, and neurosurgery. Figure 1. Treatment planning of DNL in left proximal thigh showing proposed treatment path and distances from skin, major neurovascular bundle and bone. Lesions meeting criteria for MR-HIFU and greater than 1cm from skin surface, major neurovascular bundle and nearby organ on all axial slices had a planned treatment volume (PTV) of 100% and were considered capable of undergoing complete ablation. Lesions less than 1 cm from any of these structures underwent a second volumetric analysis. Initial TTV was adjusted to create a new tumor border allowing for greater than 1 cm distance to skin surface, major neurovascular bundle and nearby organ. The remaining volume was calculated to be PTV. The percent treatable tumor was calculated as 100 × PTV/TTV. Lesions with percent treatable tumor >50% were considered capable of undergoing partial ablation >50%. Statistical Analysis In this retrospective review, feasibility of MR-HIFU for the treatment of DNL is summarized descriptively. Categorical variables were reported as percentages and when compared using the Chi-squared test. Continuous measures were reported as means (SD) or Median (IQR) and assessed with the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test or the Kruskal–Wallis Test.",Caitlin Tydings; Pavel Yarmolenko; Miriam Bornhorst; Eva Dombi; John Myseros; Robert Keating; James Bost; Karun Sharma; AeRang Kim,Neuro-oncology advances,2021,10.1093/noajnl/vdab116,minimal,True
PMID:23221337,Sustained MEK inhibition abrogates myeloproliferative disease in Nf1 mutant mice.,"Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are predisposed to juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), an aggressive myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) that is refractory to conventional chemotherapy. Conditional inactivation of the Nf1 tumor suppressor in hematopoietic cells of mice causes a progressive MPN that accurately models JMML and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). We characterized the effects of Nf1 loss on immature hematopoietic populations and investigated treatment with the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 (hereafter called 901). Somatic Nf1 inactivation resulted in a marked expansion of immature and lineage-committed myelo-erythroid progenitors and ineffective erythropoiesis. Treatment with 901 induced a durable drop in leukocyte counts, enhanced erythropoietic function, and markedly reduced spleen sizes in mice with MPN. MEK inhibition also restored a normal pattern of erythroid differentiation and greatly reduced extramedullary hematopoiesis. Remarkably, genetic analysis revealed the persistence of Nf1-deficient hematopoietic cells, indicating that MEK inhibition modulates the proliferation and differentiation of Nf1 mutant cells in vivo rather than eliminating them. These data provide a rationale for performing clinical trials of MEK inhibitors in patients with JMML and CMML.",,Tiffany Chang; Kimberly Krisman; Emily Harding Theobald; Jin Xu; Jon Akutagawa; Jennifer O Lauchle; Scott Kogan; Benjamin S Braun; Kevin Shannon,The Journal of clinical investigation,2013-01,10.1172/JCI63193,abstract_only,False
PMID:32193437,Longitudinal phenotype development in a minipig model of neurofibromatosis type 1.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a rare, autosomal dominant disease with variable clinical presentations. Large animal models are useful to help dissect molecular mechanisms, determine relevant biomarkers, and develop effective therapeutics. Here, we studied a NF1 minipig model (NF1","Materials and Methods Animal procedures All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) of the University of Iowa and Exemplar Genetics (Coralville, Iowa) and all procedures were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. 12 Yucatan minipigs (6 female, 6 male), 8 heterozygous for NF1 ( NF1 ) and 4 littermate wildtypes, were systematically imaged at 4-, 8-, and 12-months of age using both CT and MR imaging. Animals were anesthetized using either a combination of midazolam (0.6 mg/kg) and ketamine (2.2 mg/kg) or telazol (2.2–4.4 mg/kg), ketamine (1.1–2.2 mg/kg), and xylazine (1.1–2.2 mg/kg). Anesthesia was maintained throughout animal preparation and imaging using isoflurane (1–5%). Each pig was intubated with a balloon-cuffed endotracheal tube (6–8 mm) and mechanically ventilated using a Primer SP MRI-Compatible Veterinary Anesthesia Ventilator (DRE Veterinary). Animals were ventilated under 100% oxygen with a respiratory rate of 16-20 breaths per minute, 5cmH +/ex42del 2 O positive end expiratory pressure, and a tidal volume of approximately 10 mL/kg. Physiological monitoring was performed using electrocardiogram, oxygen saturation (SP-O2), and end tidal carbon dioxide pressure (ET-CO2). Ventilation parameters were modified when necessary to maintain a heart rate between 80–100 beats per minute and an SP-O2 of 95–100%. Prior to imaging, animals were placed in the prone position with their hind limbs extended behind them and their forelimbs fully adducted to their sides to provide stability. Mechanical ventilation was maintained throughout imaging; no breath holds were performed. Imaging procedures A longitudinal imaging study was devised with three proposed imaging timepoints at 4-months (TP1), 8-months (TP2), and 12-months (TP3) of age (Fig.  S1 ). Scans were systematically reviewed at each timepoint by a radiologist (T.S.S.) specializing in pediatrics and neuroradiology using a structured method of reporting. Review was performed unblinded to known genotype ( NF1  /wildtype) and preceding timepoint scans were provided for longitudinal assessment concordant with clinical practice. +/ex42del A non-contrast enhanced, full body screening CT was acquired at TP1 and TP3 using a Siemens SOMATOM Force CT scanner (Siemens Healthcare, Forcheim, Germany) or a GE Discovery MI PET/CT (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI). The following standard dose parameters were used for acquisition: Spiral, 70 kV, 208 ref. mAs (tube current modulation on), pitch 1.9. Data was reconstructed as 0.75 and 2 mm slice thicknesses using iterative reconstructions (Qr40, ADMIRE level 5 or STANDARD, ASiR 100%). A subsequent equivalent scan was acquired at a lower radiation dose level with the same parameters but with a 20-reference mAs. MR imaging was performed at all timepoints using a 3.0 T General Electric Discovery MR750w. Four separate protocols were used for imaging: head, whole body, spine, and targeted. The developed protocols drew from whole-body screening recommendations and typical clinical practice . The targeted protocol was used only when an unexpected or abnormal finding was identified during one of the prior three protocols. Table  48 , 49 1  lists the scans of each protocol and their parameters. Head scans were completed using a 32-channel head coil. Targeted scans were completed using the 8US TORSOPA abdominal coil.

Clinical measurements and recording At each imaging timepoint, minipig weight and exterior clinical indications were recorded. With the anesthetized minipig positioned laterally, photographs were taken the right and left sides. Additional photographs of encountered phenotypes were taken including CALMs, axillary and inguinal freckling, and exterior indications of neurofibroma. For each minipig exhibiting CALMs, the diameter of the largest marking on each side was measured and tracked for change across the imaging timepoints. A description of this method is included as  Supplemental Text . Skeletal measurements Using the CT scans from TP1, skeletal measurements were taken with tools available in 3D Slicer ( https://www.slicer.org/ ) to identify any developmental abnormalities typically seen in NF1 patients. A full description with images of these CT based skeletal measurements is included as  Supplemental Text . To summarize, length measurements were made of the long bones on both lateral sides including the femur, tibia, humerus, ulna, metacarpals, and metatarsals. Presence of anterolateral tibia bowing was assessed using an angle measurement previously described in an NF1 mouse model . 62 Optic nerve measurements Longitudinal measurements of the optic nerves from head MR images were obtained using a method previously described . A full description with images of measurements is included as  63 Supplemental Text . To summarize, measurements of the diameter of the optic nerve with and without the nerve sheath were taken from the axial plane of the T2 CUBE datasets. These diameters were systematically measured at 3 mm behind the ocular globe in the image slice that provided the clearest view of the nerve. Histopathology neurofibroma assessment For minipig tumor development assessment, at necropsy tissue was taken from identified sites of interest (Fig.  2 ). At each site, tumor tissue was excised and samples collected from epidermal/dermal region as well as the subcutis and deep tumor margins. Tumor tissues were fixed (10% neutral buffered formalin x 5–7 days), processed, paraffin-embedded, sectioned (~4 µm) and stained for hematoxylin and eosin (HE) or Masson’s Trichrome (MT) stains. S100 immunohistochemistry was performed as detailed previously . Tissues were examined by a veterinary pathologist following principles of reproducible histopathological examination and scoring 64 . As the tissues came from the same animal and were used principally for comparative descriptions, masking of the samples was not necessary. 65 Imaging-based neurofibroma assessment The corresponding regions for histopathology were assessed in the T2 FS, LAVA Pre- and LAVA Post- contrast scans for quantitative imaging characteristics. Measurements of the neurofibroma regions were made using the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria on the LAVA post contrast MR scans; WHO is taken as the product of the two longest perpendicular measurements of a tumor, progressive disease is defined as ≥25% increase in one lesion . Regions of interest (ROI) corresponding to biopsy zones were extracted from axial slices as regions with consistent area of 1400 square pixels. Percentage signal intensity change ( 38 % SIΔ) was extracted from the ROIs as previously described . Additional quantitative imaging features (T2 Mean, T2 Entropy, T2 Skewness, and LAVA-Pre Kurtosis) were extracted and compared to published values on retrospective human clinical subjects with benign plexiform neurofibromas 66 . 40 Statistical analysis A two-sample Wilcoxon rank sum (Mann-Whitney) test was performed between  NF1  and wildtype minipig weight and skeletal measurements +/ex42del . For the ten subjects with three timepoints, subject weight growth across time was compared using repeated measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) following assessment of Mauchly’s sphericity test with two degrees of freedom 67 .

PMID:21980365,The haploinsufficient hematopoietic microenvironment is critical to the pathological fracture repair in murine models of neurofibromatosis type 1.,"Germline mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene cause neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a complex genetic disorder with a high predisposition of numerous skeletal dysplasias including short stature, osteoporosis, kyphoscoliosis, and fracture non-union (pseudoarthrosis). We have developed murine models that phenocopy many of the skeletal dysplasias observed in NF1 patients, including reduced bone mass and fracture non-union. We also show that the development of these skeletal manifestations requires an Nf1 haploinsufficient background in addition to nullizygous loss of Nf1 in mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSCs) and/or their progenies. This is replicated in two animal models of NF1, PeriCre(+);Nf1(flox/-) and Col2.3Cre(+);Nf1(flox/-) mice. Adoptive transfer experiments demonstrate a critical role of the Nf1+/- marrow microenvironment in the impaired fracture healing in both models and adoptive transfer of WT bone marrow cells improves fracture healing in these mice. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a non-cell autonomous mechanism in non-malignant NF1 manifestations. Collectively, these data provide evidence of a combinatory effect between nullizygous loss of Nf1 in osteoblast progenitors and haploinsufficiency in hematopoietic cells in the development of non-malignant NF1 manifestations.","Methods Ethics statement Animal care and experiments were conducted according to the guidelines established by the Indiana University Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).

Adult mice were anesthetized via inhalation of 2.5% isoflurane (IsoFlo; Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) mixed with O 2  (1.5 liter/min). The mice were placed in a prone position on the specimen tray and scanned. The head was excluded from total body scans. The region of interest included the central 50% of the whole tibia.

For evaluation of the trabecular envelope at the distal femoral metaphysis, each specimen was scanned with a slice increment of 9 µm. CT images were reconstructed, filtered (σ = 0.8 and support = 1.0), and thresholded (22% of maximum possible gray scale value) as previously described  [53] . Scanning for the femur was started at 15% of the total femur length measured from the tip of the femoral condyle and extended proximally for 200 slices. The area for trabecular analysis was outlined within the trabecular compartment, excluding the cortical and subcortical bone. Every 10 sections were outlined manually, and the intermediate sections were interpolated with the contouring algorithm to create a volume of interest. Parameters of microarchitecture for both skeletal sites included bone volume (BV, mm 3 ) and bone volume fraction (BV/TV, %), as well as trabecular number (Tb.N, mm −1 ), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th, µm), and trabecular separation (Tb.Sp, µm). Fluorochrome bone labeling and histomorphometric measurements Fluorochrome labeling of the bones was performed in 8 week-old mice by intraperitoneal injections of calcein (20 mg/kg, Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO, USA) and alizarin (20 mg/kg, Sigma) 8 and 3 days before sacrifice, as previously described  [54] . After sacrifice, femurs were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 48 hours, dehydrated in graded ethanols, and embedded undecalcified in methylmethacrylate. Frontal sections (4 µm thick) were cut from the distal femur using a motorized microtome equipped with a tungsten-carbide knife (Leica Inc, Deerfield Il). The sections were reacted with tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP) for identifying and measuring the osteoclast surface or mounted unstained for fluorochrome-derived bone formation parameters. One section per tibia was viewed at 160× magnification on a Leitz DMRXE microscope (Leica Mikroskopie und System GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) and the image captured using a SPOT digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI). The measurement area for the distal femoral metaphysis was determined by a region beginning 0.5 mm proximal to the midpoint of the growth plate, non-inclusive of cortical bone, and extending proximally for a total area of approximately 2.8 mm 2 . Trabecular bone turnover was assessed by measuring the extent of single label (sL.Pm), double label (dL.Pm) and the area of bone (dL.Ar) between the calcein and alizarin labels using Image Pro Plus version 4.1 software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Derived histomorphometric parameters included mineralizing surface (MS/BS, %), a measure of active bone-forming surface, calculated as follows: the [½ sL.Pm+dL.Pm]/Tt.Pm * 100; mineral apposition rate (MAR, µm/day), a measure of the rate of radial expansion of new bone, calculated as follows: dL.Ar/dL.Pm/4 dy; and bone formation rate, an overall measure of bone formation that combines MS/BS and MAR, calculated as follows: MS/BS * MAR * 3.65. For histological analysis of cell populations, after sacrifice, tibiae were dissected from the mice and were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 48 hours, dehydrated in graded ethanols, and embedded undecalcified in methylmethacrylate. Frontal sections (4 µm thick) were cut from the tibiae using a motorized microtome equipped with a tungsten-carbide knife (Leica Inc, Deerfield Il). The sections were reacted with TRACP for identification and measuring of osteoclast surface. MacNeal and /or von Kossa staining were utilized for identifying osteoblasts and calcified bones. The sections were viewed at 200× magnification on a Leitz DMRXE microscope (Leica Mikroskopie und System GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) and the images were captured using a SPOT digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI). The quantification of osteoblast cell number and osteoclast surface were normalized to the bone surface in millimeters (mm), to control for the total amount of trabecular bone surface within each histological section. Generation of fracture and X-ray scan A single tibial fracture was induced as described previously  [55] ,  [56] ,  [57] . With the animal lying supine on the operating table, an intramedullary rod (a 30-G needle) was surgically inserted via the proximal end of the tibiae into the medullary canal of the tibia, so as to stabilize the bone post-fracture and permit load-bearing. A 200-gram weight was dropped from a height of 30-cm to fracture the tibia between the middle to lower 1/3 of the bone. Mice were X-rayed following the fracture to verify standardization of the fractures. The mice were allowed to recover on a heated pad and then placed in recovery cages. Fracture repair was monitored by weekly radiography (pixRay-100, Bioptics, Phoenix, AZ) and cases where the internal fixation failed, (due to pin slippage, bending or breakage) the affected mouse was euthanized and excluded from subsequent analysis. MSC and committed osteoprogenitor culture in murine specimens MSCs were generated from each experimental group of mice as previously described  [49] . Briefly, BM mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) were separated by low density gradient centrifugation from 6∼8-week old mice. BMMNCs were then resuspended and cultured in mouse MesenCult basal medium containing MesenCult Supplement (Stem Cell Technologies Inc.) at a concentration of 2×10 6  cells/mL in a 10-cm tissue culture plate as previously described. When the cultures reached 80–90% confluency, cells were trypsinized and replated at a concentration of 5×10 5  cells/75 cm 2 . MSCs at passage 5 to 10 were used for the following experiments. To culture committed osteoprogenitors, calvaria or femur distal metaphyses were resected and chopped finely with a scalpel. Bone chips were exposed to 0.25% trypsin for 1 hour and then passed through a 70-µm cell strainer (Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) to remove debris and matrix remnants. Cells were cultured in α-MEM medium and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin at 37°C, 5% CO 2 . Bone marrow transplantation of hematopoietic cells 10 6  syngeneic WT or  Nf1+/−  bone marrow cells from WT GFP or  Nf1+/−  GFP mice were transplanted into young adult  PeriCre ; Nf1  recipient mice following 1100 rads of ionizing radiation with two split doses  flox/flox [12] . The C57BL/6-TgN(ACTbEGFP) 1Osb transgenic mouse line was obtained from Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine  [58] . Statistical analysis.

PMID:12095621,Quantification of NF1 transcripts reveals novel highly expressed splice variants.,"Previously, we have shown that the NF1 gene gives rise to multiple novel splice variants. In the present study, nine NF1 variants were quantified by real-time PCR in various human tissues. Some of these variants were expressed at low to moderate low levels and possible implications of these findings are discussed. Interestingly, two variants (NF1-DeltaE4b and NF1-DeltaE43) were shown to be highly expressed in specific tissues. NF1-DeltaE43 lacks a nuclear targeting sequence and might be functionally different from full-length NF1. These novel NF1 splice variants might expand our understanding of the role of neurofibromin.",,Ina Vandenbroucke; Jo Vandesompele; Anne De Paepe; Ludwine Messiaen,FEBS letters,2002-07-03,10.1016/s0014-5793(02)02887-9,abstract_only,False
PMID:18614544,Neurofibromin regulates somatic growth through the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.,"To study the role of the neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) gene in mammalian brain development, we recently generated mice in which Nf1 gene inactivation occurs in neuroglial progenitor cells using the brain lipid binding protein (BLBP) promoter. We found that Nf1(BLBP)CKO mice exhibit significantly reduced body weights and anterior pituitary gland sizes. We further demonstrate that the small anterior pituitary size reflects loss of neurofibromin expression in the hypothalamus, leading to reduced growth hormone releasing hormone, pituitary growth hormone (GH) and liver insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) production. Since neurofibromin both negatively regulates Ras activity and positively modulates cAMP levels, we examined the signaling pathway responsible for these abnormalities. While BLBP-mediated expression of an activated Ras molecule did not recapitulate the body weight and hypothalamic/pituitary defects, treatment of Nf1(BLBP)CKO mice with rolipram to increase cAMP levels resulted in a partial restoration of the body weight phenotype. Furthermore, conditional expression of the Ras regulatory GAP domain of neurofibromin also did not rescue the body weight or Igf1 mRNA defects in Nf1(BLBP)CKO mice. Collectively, these data demonstrate a critical role for neurofibromin in hypothalamic-pituitary axis function and provide further insights into the short stature and GH deficits seen in children with NF1.",,Balazs Hegedus; Tu-Hsueh Yeh; Da Yong Lee; Ryan J Emnett; Jia Li; David H Gutmann,Human molecular genetics,2008-10-01,10.1093/hmg/ddn194,abstract_only,False
PMID:3118033,Linkage studies in peripheral neurofibromatosis.,"Peripheral neurofibromatosis (NF) is one of the most common major genetic disorders in man. Its chromosomal location is unknown and questions regarding such factors as genetic heterogeneity remain unanswered. We have ascertained and sampled several large multi-generation families for linkage studies including one family of 66 subjects, 28 of whom were affected with NF. Recombinant DNA studies of several restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) including C3, ApoC2, pBam34 (D19S6], HAUP[APRT], pE40-1 [D11521], Hp[Hp2 alpha], LDR92, and LDR111 failed to show a significant linkage (Z [lod score] greater than or equal to 3.00) in this family. In addition, the results excluded areas of the genome around the marker loci (Z greater than or equal to - 2.00) as potential sites for linkage. The maximum Z obtained with the markers was for Hp at theta (maximum recombination fraction) = 0.20 and Z = 0.399. We are now in the process of screening additional RFLPs and families for linkage to NF.",,M A Pericak-Vance; L H Yamaoka; J M Vance; A S Aylsworth; G O Rossenwasser; P C Gaskell; M J Alberts; W Y Hung; C Haynes; A D Roses,Journal of medical genetics,1987-09,10.1136/jmg.24.9.530,abstract_only,False
PMID:11404331,A systematic screen for dominant second-site modifiers of Merlin/NF2 phenotypes reveals an interaction with blistered/DSRF and scribbler.,"Merlin, the Drosophila homologue of the human tumor suppressor gene Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2), is required for the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. To better understand the cellular functions of the NF2 gene product, Merlin, recent work has concentrated on identifying proteins with which it interacts either physically or functionally. In this article, we describe genetic screens designed to isolate second-site modifiers of Merlin phenotypes from which we have identified five multiallelic complementation groups that modify both loss-of-function and dominant-negative Merlin phenotypes. Three of these groups, Group IIa/scribbler (also known as brakeless), Group IIc/blistered, and Group IId/net, are known genes, while two appear to be novel. In addition, two genes, Group IIa/scribbler and Group IIc/blistered, alter Merlin subcellular localization in epithelial and neuronal tissues, suggesting that they regulate Merlin trafficking or function. Furthermore, we show that mutations in scribbler and blistered display second-site noncomplementation with one another. These results suggest that Merlin, blistered, and scribbler function together in a common pathway to regulate Drosophila wing epithelial development.",,D R LaJeunesse; B M McCartney; R G Fehon,Genetics,2001-06,10.1093/genetics/158.2.667,abstract_only,False
PMID:22916147,Applying microsatellite multiplex PCR analysis (MMPA) for determining allele copy-number status and percentage of normal cells within tumors.,"The study of somatic genetic alterations in tumors contributes to the understanding and management of cancer. Genetic alterations, such us copy number or copy neutral changes, generate allelic imbalances (AIs) that can be determined using polymorphic markers. Here we report the development of a simple set of calculations for analyzing microsatellite multiplex PCR data from control-tumor pairs that allows us to obtain accurate information not only regarding the AI status of tumors, but also the percentage of tumor-infiltrating normal cells, the locus copy-number status and the mechanism involved in AI. We validated this new approach by re-analyzing a set of Neurofibromatosis type 1-associated dermal neurofibromas and comparing newly generated data with results obtained for the same tumors in a previous study using MLPA, Paralog Ratio Analysis and SNP-array techniques.Microsatellite multiplex PCR analysis (MMPA) should be particularly useful for analyzing specific regions of the genome containing tumor suppressor genes and also for determining the percentage of infiltrating normal cells within tumors allowing them to be sorted before they are analyzed by more expensive techniques.","Material and Methods Ethics Statement All the human samples used in this study were provided by patients who had given their written informed consent. The ethical committee review board of the Bellvitge Hospital, Barcelona, Spain, approved the study. DNA extraction DNA from blood was isolated either by the Wizard Genomic DNA purification kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions or by the “salting out” method as described elsewhere  [17] . This DNA was used as control or reference DNA in the allelic imbalance analysis of tumors of the respective patients. Control DNA was also obtained in some cases from the skin of patients (or derived fibroblasts). DNA from skin or neurofibromas was extracted using the Gentra Puregene Kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer's instructions. Concentration, purity and quality of the DNA were first assessed using a nanodrop spectrophotometer and gel electrophoresis analysis. For an accurate quantification of DNA concentration, samples were further quantified using Quant-iT PicoGreen reagent (Invitrogen). All DNA samples were stored and preserved at 4°C and at −80°C. Samples used in this study: a) For the MMPA setting up samples are mentioned in  Figures S1 ,  S2a  and  S8 ; b) For MMPA validation 29 pairs of control-neurofibroma samples were used and are listed in  Table 1 . Microsatellite Multiplex PCR analysis (MMPA) We have used a previously developed multiplex PCR reaction with the simultaneous amplification of 16 microsatellites ( [13]  and  Table S1 ). To set up new conditions for performing the proposed MMPA calculations, we modified original PCR conditions according to the parameters and quality controls explained in the supplementary information. We used a Multiplex PCR Kit (Qiagen) with which we obtained good global microsatellite amplification, providing good peak heights and a robust band pattern in the electropherogram readings. We adjusted the concentrations of the different primer pairs to obtain similar product yields of each of the different amplicons of the multiplex PCR. The multiplex PCR reaction was carried out in a 25 µl reaction, containing 80 ng of DNA. An initial cycle of denaturation at 95°C for 15 min was followed by 22 cycles of: denaturation at 94°C, annealing at 56°C and extension at 72°C for 30 sec, 3 min and 1,5 min respectively. A final cycle at 60°C for 30 min was performed. 2 µl of PCR product was mixed with 7,8 µl of formamide and 0,2 µl of size standard Liz500. PCR fragments were separated by capillary electrophoresis on an ABI 3130 xl  Genetic Analyzer. Peak height values for each microsatellite allele were extracted using Peak Scanner software (Applied Biosystems). We used MMPA to analyze 29 control-neurofibroma pairs of samples. Semi-automated analysis of MMPA results To analyze the data extracted by Peak Scanner software we have developed a tool that automates all the necessary MMPA calculations ( Script S1 ). This automated analysis has been implemented using the Ruby programming language in a script named  mmpa.rb . The script calculates and outputs the Kμ, comparing the reactions of control-tumor pairs, the average percentage of normal tissue contamination in the tumor, and the overall mechanism of AI for the test sample. For each informative microsatellite, calculated Ks, AI determination, observed peak height ratios, expected peak height ratios, % of non-AI cells and mechanisms generating the AIs are also calculated.  mmpa.rb  is released under the GNU GPL license. Source code and detailed instructions for its installation and use are available in  Script S1  and can be also downloaded from  http://www.imppc.org/research-activities/genetic-variation-and-cancer/mmpa.html . SNP-array data analysis SNP-array data generated in a previous study  [13]  (Illumina Infinium SNP-array, Human660W-Quad beadchip ∼660000 SNPs) was used to determine the percentage of cells bearing AIs by applying a Global Parameter Hidden Markov Model (GPHMM) algorithm  [16]  that quantitatively models signal baseline shift due to aneuploidy and also the presence of normal diploid cells.  Results  were compared with MMPA calculations.",Carles Garcia-Linares; Jaume Mercadé; Bernat Gel; Josep Biayna; Ernest Terribas; Conxi Lázaro; Eduard Serra,PloS one,2012,10.1371/journal.pone.0042682,minimal,True
PMID:24786638,Analyses of merlin/NF2 connection to FAK inhibitor responsiveness in serous ovarian cancer.,"OBJECTIVE: Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is overexpressed in serous ovarian cancer. Loss of merlin, a product of the neurofibromatosis 2 tumor suppressor gene, is being evaluated as a biomarker for FAK inhibitor sensitivity in mesothelioma. Connections between merlin and FAK in ovarian cancer remain undefined. METHODS: Nine human and two murine ovarian cancer cell lines were analyzed for growth in the presence of a small molecule FAK inhibitor (PF-271, also termed VS-6062) from 0.1 to 1 μM for 72 h. Merlin was evaluated by immunoblotting and immunostaining of a human ovarian tumor tissue array. Growth of cells was analyzed in an orthotopic tumor model and evaluated in vitro after stable shRNA-mediated merlin knockdown. RESULTS: Greater than 50% inhibition of OVCAR8, HEY, and ID8-IP ovarian carcinoma cell growth occurred with 0.1 μM PF-271 in anchorage-independent (p<0.001) but not in adherent culture conditions. PF-271-mediated reduction in FAK Y397 phosphorylation occurred independently of growth inhibition. Suspended growth of OVCAR3, OVCAR10, IGROV1, IGROV1-IP, SKOV3, SKOV3-IP, A2780, and 5009-MOVCAR was not affected by 0.1 μM PF-271. Merlin expression did not correlate with serous ovarian tumor grade or stage. PF-271 (30 mg/kg, BID) did not inhibit 5009-MOVCAR tumor growth and merlin knockdown in SKOV3-IP and OVCAR10 cells did not alter suspended cell growth upon PF-271 addition. CONCLUSIONS: Differential responsiveness to FAK inhibitor treatment was observed. Intrinsic low merlin protein level correlated with PF-271-mediated anchorage-independent growth inhibition, but reduction in merlin expression did not induce sensitivity to FAK inhibition. Merlin levels may be useful for patient stratification in FAK inhibitor trials.","Methods Nine human and two murine ovarian cancer cell lines were analyzed for growth in the presence of a small molecule FAK inhibitor (PF-271, 0.1 to 1 μM) for 72 h. Merlin was evaluated by immunoblotting and immunostaining of a human ovarian tumor tissue array. Growth of cells was analyzed in an orthotopic tumor model and evaluated in vitro after stable shRNA-mediated merlin knockdown. Materials and Methods Antibodies and reagents Anti-pY397 FAK (141-9) was from Life Technologies. Anti-FAK (4.47) and GAPDH (clone 374) were from Millipore and anti-actin (AC-74) was from Sigma. Merlin antibodies for immunoblotting (D1D8) and immunohistochemistry (NF2, A-19) were from Cell Signaling and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. PF-271 was synthesized as described [ 27 ]. NF2 shRNA lentivirus plasmids (Clone IDs: 000268.x-47s1c1 and 000268.x-2467s1c1) and pLKO.1-puro non-target shRNA control plasmid (SHC016) were from Mission-Sigma. Cells Table 1  lists source, culture conditions, and selective DNA sequencing information for the human ovarian carcinoma cell lines used. MOVCAR-5009 cells were isolated from the ascites of transgenic mice expressing simian virus 40 T antigen (TAg) driven by the Müllerian inhibitory substance type II receptor (MISIIR) gene promoter [ 28 ]. ID8-IP cells were isolated from the ascites of C57Bl6 mice harboring ID8 tumors [ 19 ]. SVOV3-IP and IGROV1-IP cells were isolated from the ascites of nude mice harboring the respective tumors as described [ 16 ]. Cells were propagated adherently on plastic or replated on low-binding poly 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (poly-HEMA) coated plates for experimental anchorage-independent analyses. The coding sequence for fluorescent mCherry protein (pmCherry-C1, Clontech) was subcloned into the lentiviral expression vector (pCDH-CMVMSC1, System Biosciences) and recombinant lentivirus produced as described [ 29 ]. Lentivirus-transduced mCherry-expressing MOVCAR-5009, shRNA merlin, and shRNA Scr (control) cells were selected by growth in puromycin (2 μg/ml), expanded, and frozen as low passage stocks. Spheroids in 6-well poly-HEMA coated plates (Costar) were visualized using bright field microscopy (Olympus, IX-51) at 10x magnification (UPLFL, 0.30 NA), and images were acquired with a monochrome camera (Hamamatsu, OrcaER) using Slidebook (v5.0) software. Cell growth assays Cells were plated in 6-well plates under non-adherent (25 × 10 4  cells, poly-HEMA coated, Corning) or adherent (5 × 10 4  cells, tissue culture-treated plastic, Corning) conditions. PF-271, dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), was added at the indicated concentration. After three days, all cells were collected by limited trypsin treatment, a single cell suspension was prepared, and the viable total cell number determined by ViCell XR (Beckman). All experimental points were performed in triplicate and repeated at least two times. Immunoblotting Cell lysis buffer (1% Triton X100, 1% sodium deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mM NaF, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) was used to extract proteins from cultured cells and tumors as described [ 16 ]. Total protein was determined using Bradford analyses (BioRad), proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for immunoblotting. Immunohistochemistry Paraffin-embedded normal ovary and ovarian tumor tissue array (US Biomax, OV811 and OV8011) sections were deparaffinized and processed for antigen retrieval as described [ 16 ]. Sections were incubated in blocking buffer (phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 5% normal goat serum, 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 0.1% Triton X-100) for 45 minutes at room temperature and then incubated with anti-merlin (1:100) in blocking buffer overnight. Biotinylated goat-anti-rabbit IgG (1:300), Vectastain ABC Elite, and diaminobenzidine were used to visualize antibody binding, and slides were counter-stained with methyl green. Images were captured using an upright microscope (Olympus BX43) and color camera (Olympus SC100). Staining intensity of the tissue cores of serous tumors and normal samples were scored from 0 to 4 in a blinded manner. A single core from each of 58 patient samples was analyzed, including 48 serous ovarian cancer samples and 10 normal or adjacent ovarian tissue samples. Database analyses Expression array data was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier Plotter version 2013 ( http://www.kmplot.com/ovar ) as described [ 30 ]. Datasets include gene expression and survival data from Gene Expression Omnibus and The Cancer Genome Atlas (Affymetrix HG-U133A, HG-U133A 2.0, HG-U133 Plus 2.0 and U95Av2 microarrays). NF2 ( 218915_at ) probe set used. Query parameters were: overall survival, split patients by median, auto-select best cut-off, and follow up threshold of 10 years. Merlin probe expression range was 20-1775, cut-off value was 266, and the hazard ratio (HR) and logrank P significance values were calculated via the website interface. Mice Female C57Bl6 TgMISIIR-TAg-low mice [ 28 ] were housed in pathogen-free conditions according to Association for the Assessment and Accreditation for Laboratory Animal Care guidelines. Studies were performed with approved institutional animal care and use protocols and adhered to ARRIVE guidelines. Study protocols did not alter body weight or promote morbidity. Orthotopic tumor model mCherry-labeled MOVCAR-5009 cells were harvested by limited trypsinization, washed in PBS, and counted (ViCell XR, Beckman). Cells (500,000 cells in 7 μL of growth factor-depleted Matrigel, BD Biosciences) were implanted under the bursa surrounding the right ovary of 8-10 week old low MISIIR TAg mice as described [ 16 ]. Administration of PF-271 (30 mg/kg) or vehicle (30% 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin in 3% dextrose) was initiated at Day 7 via oral gavage twice daily and was maintained through termination (Day 28). Abdominal organs and reproductive tracts were removed, primary ovarian tumors were weighed, and fluorescent images were acquired using an OV100 Small Animal Imaging System (Olympus) to detect metastases. For quantification, a common threshold for mCherry fluorescence was set and metastatic sites were counted.

PMID:20739432,Gene expression analysis identifies potential biomarkers of neurofibromatosis type 1 including adrenomedullin.,"PURPOSE: Plexiform neurofibromas (pNF) are Schwann cell tumors found in a third of individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). pNF can undergo transformation to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). There are no identified serum biomarkers of pNF tumor burden or transformation to MPNST. Serum biomarkers would be useful to verify NF1 diagnosis, monitor tumor burden, and/or detect transformation. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used microarray gene expression analysis to define 92 genes that encode putative secreted proteins in neurofibroma Schwann cells, neurofibromas, and MPNST. We validated differential expression by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, Western blotting, and ELISA assays in cell conditioned medium and control and NF1 patient sera. RESULTS: Of 13 candidate genes evaluated, only adrenomedullin (ADM) was confirmed as differentially expressed and elevated in serum of NF1 patients. ADM protein concentrati on was further elevated in serum of a small sampling of NF1 patients with MPNST. MPNST cell conditioned medium, containing ADM and hepatocyte growth factor, stimulated MPNST migration and endothelial cell proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, microarray analysis identifies potential serum biomarkers for disease, and ADM is a serum biomarker of NF1. ADM serum levels do not seem to correlate with the presence of pNFs but may be a biomarker of transformation to MPNST.","Experimental Design We used microarray gene expression analysis to define 92 genes that encode putative secreted proteins in neurofibroma Schwann cells, neurofibromas, and MPNST. We validated differential expression by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, Western blotting, and ELISA assays in cell conditioned medium and control and NF1 patient sera. Materials and Methods Microarray generation Identification of candidate secreted biomarkers We generated a list of candidate secreted NF1 biomarkers by intersecting genes statistically differentially expressed between cultured normal human Schwann cells (NHSC), Schwann cells derived from neurofibroma, and MPNST cell lines with proteins cataloged in the Secreted Protein Database ( 32 ). Specifically, 9,473 transcripts had been identified in a previous study comparing independent cultures of primary human Schwann cells ( n  = 10), dermal neurofibroma-derived Schwann cell cultures ( n  = 11), pNF-derived Schwann cell cultures ( n  = 11), MPNST cell line cultures ( n  = 13), dermal neurofibromas ( n  = 13), pNFs ( n  = 13), and MPNSTs ( n  = 6; ref.  33 ). In brief, normalized samples using the Robust Multichip Analysis algorithm as implemented in Bioconductor/R ( 34 ) had been referenced by batch to controls for batch-to-batch variation, and the normalized expression of each gene in each sample to the median expression of the measurements of that transcript across 10 primary NHSC cultures referenced. We had corrected results from the primary analysis for multiple testing effects by applying the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate correction (FDR ≤ 0.05; ref.  35 ). All statistical comparisons and data visualizations were done using GeneSpring GX v7.3.1 (Agilent Technologies). The data underlying this analysis can be accessed in Gene Expression Omnibus (accession number  GSE14038  at  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ). For the current study, we initially focused on genes up-regulated 1-fold or greater between NHSCs and primary neurofibroma or NHSCs and primary MPNST; 1,664 transcripts were upregulated in at least one of the two conditions. We separately imported 3,721 proteins from the Secreted Protein Database ( 32 ) into GeneSpring GX using RefSeq ID (confidence rank, 0–3). We then identified the intersection of the list of genes upregulated in NF1 cell cultures with the list of putative secreted proteins upregulated in primary tumors; 666 transcripts were identified. Subsequent cluster analysis across solid tumors (neurofibroma and MPNST) compared with NHSCs ( 33 ) identified the 132 most significantly upregulated transcripts ( P  < 0.001), of which 92 were unique genes and considered candidate secreted biomarkers. Validation with quantitative real-time PCR We used total RNA as a template to synthesize double-stranded cDNA using an oligo(dT) primer with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). We conducted duplicate reactions omitting reverse transcriptase to control for genomic DNA contamination. Relative levels of RNA were measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) using the ABI 7500 Sequence Detection System default settings. Amplification was conducted in SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). We obtained primer sequences using Primer3 software ( http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer3/primer3_www.cgi ), and oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. The following primers were used: ADM, 5′-AGTCGTGGGAAGAGGGAACT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCCTGGAAGTTGTTCATGCT-3′ (reverse); HGF, 5′-CTGGTTCCCCTTCAATAGCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTCCAGGGCTGACATTTGAT-3′ (reverse); β-actin, 5′-GGACTTCGAGCAAGAGATGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACATCTGCTGGAAGGTGGAC-3′ (reverse). The remainder of the candidate primers are shown in  Supplement 1 . Cycle threshold values were obtained, where fluorescence intensity was in the geometric phase of amplification, and averaged for triplicate reactions. Values for individual genes of interest were normalized to values for β-actin and used to calculate fold change in gene expression using ABI software. ADM and HGF detection in serum-free conditioned medium MPNST cell lines (described in ref.  19 ) were grown to 90% confluence in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Medium was removed and cells were washed three times with PBS. We then added serum-free DMEM (Fisher Scientific) and removed the medium after 48 hours. We centrifuged the supernatant at 10 ×  g  for 5 minutes to remove cellular debris. Migration assay We measured the migratory response of 8814 MPNST cells using a modified Boyden chamber assay. Cells (4 × 10 4 ) in serum-free DMEM were plated on the upper chamber of a 24-well Transwell plate with 8-μm pore membranes (Costar, Corning, Inc.). The lower chamber contained 800 μL of 8814 MPNST conditioned medium. Cells were incubated for 24 hours at 37°C in 10% CO 2 . Nonmigrating cells were removed from the upper surface of the membrane with cotton swabs. Membranes were stained with bisbenzimide and mounted onto glass slides. For each condition, migration was quantified by counting cells in four nonoverlapping fields in three independent membranes. Samples were evaluated in three independent experiments, and data from a representative experiment are shown. Numbers of migrated cells were normalized to the total number of cells on an unscraped filter to validate the total number of cells plated. ADM and ADM 22–52 (a competitive receptor antagonist) were from Bachem Bioscience, Inc. Data shown are representative of three independent experiments; values presented are the mean ± SD. We determined statistical significance by Student’s  t  test using GraphPad Prism software. Patient serum Serum specimens and corresponding clinical data were collected and used in accordance with a Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) Institutional Review Board (IRB)–approved protocol. All patients from Cincinnati Children’s monthly NF1 comprehensive genetics clinic who had documented pNFs were approached to provide a serum sample. We procured blood samples from 32 NF1 patients. Serum was separated within 1 hour of collection and kept at −80°C until analyzed. One sample was from an NF1 patient with a pNF who had previously consented to donate serum and subsequently developed an MPNST. We obtained 25 frozen surplus serum samples from the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Clinical Laboratory, which were used as controls. Only age and gender of the surplus serum were revealed in accordance with a CCHMC IRB-approved protocol. Genetics, hematology/oncology, and bone marrow transplant patients were excluded. ELISA We conducted ELISA assays on serum-free conditioned medium and human serum using an ADM detection kit (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals) and Human HGF ELISA kit (R&D Systems) following the manufacturer’s suggested protocol. We did all assay procedures in triplicate. Internal negative and positive quality controls were provided in each ELISA kit and run in triplicate in each assay. Tube formation Human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) were purchased from Lonza. HUVECs maintained in EBM2 medium (Lonza) with supplement (supplied by Lonza) were washed twice with PBS, trypsinized, and plated (4 × 10 5  cells/mL) in wells of 96-well plates coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) in either DMEM or EBM2 with 2% FBS supplemented with ADM (10 μmol/L), ADM 22–52 (10 μmol/L), both ADM and ADM 22–52, HGF (10 ng/mL), or anti-HGF antibody (0.5 μg/mL) in triplicate. After 18 hours, the plates were stained using calcein-AM (8 μg/mL) and two nonoverlapping fields per well were photographed using a fluorescent microscope, accounting for >80% of the area of each filter. Three wells were analyzed per experimental condition. Three independent experiments were conducted, and data from a representative experiment are shown. The area of tube formation was then quantified using ImageJ software.",Trent R Hummel; Walter J Jessen; Shyra J Miller; Lan Kluwe; Victor F Mautner; Margaret R Wallace; Conxi Lázaro; Grier P Page; Paul F Worley; Bruce J Aronow; Elizabeth K Schorry; Nancy Ratner,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2010-10-15,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-0613,minimal,True
PMID:41582719,Inhibition of Cxcr4 chemokine receptor signaling improves habituation learning in a zebrafish model of Neurofibromatosis.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a neurogenetic disorder caused by loss of function mutations in the gene neurofibromin 1 (NF1). NF1 encodes neurofibromin, a multifunctional tumor suppressing protein that regulates Ras, cAMP, and dopamine signaling. NF1 predisposes patients to a wide range of symptoms, including peripheral nerve tumors, brain tumors, and cognitive dysfunction. Despite considerable work using animal models to investigate the role of neurofibromin in behavior, translating research into treatment for NF1-associated cognitive dysfunction has not yet been successful. Here, we provide evidence that Cxcr4 chemokine receptor signaling is a regulator of habituation learning and modulator of cAMP-PKA signaling in nf1 mutant larval zebrafish. Combining a small-molecule drug screen and RNAseq analysis, we show that cxcr4b expression is increased in nf1 mutants and that pharmacological inhibition of Cxcr4 with AMD3100 (Plerixafor) improves habituation learning. We further demonstrate that Plerixafor activates cAMP-PKA pathway signaling but has limited effects on Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway signaling in the nf1 mutant brain. CXCR4 was previously identified as a potential therapeutic target for neurofibromin-deficient tumorigenesis. Our results suggest that Cxcr4 signaling also regulates neurofibromin-dependent cognitive function.",,Andrew H Miller; Yeng Yang; Natalie Schmidt; Jaffna Mathiaparanam; Mark E Berres; Mary C Halloran,Disease models & mechanisms,2026-01-26,10.1242/dmm.052509,abstract_only,False
PMID:25475340,Validity and interexaminer reliability of a new method to quantify skin neurofibromas of neurofibromatosis 1 using paper frames.,"BACKGROUND: Skin neurofibromas represent one of the main clinical manifestations of neurofibromatosis 1, and their number varies greatly between individuals. Quantifying their number is an important step in the methodology of many clinical studies, but counting neurofibromas one by one in individuals with thousands of tumors is arduous, time-consuming, and subject to intra and interexaminer variability. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a new methodology for skin neurofibromas quantification using paper frames. METHODS: The sample comprised 92 individuals with NF1. Paper frames, with a central square measuring 100 cm2, were placed on the back, abdomen and thigh. Images were taken, transferred to a computer and two independent examiners counted the neurofibromas. The average number of neurofibromas/100 cm2 of skin was obtained from the mean of the three values. The differences in the quantity of neurofibromas counted by two examiners were evaluated with Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), paired t-test, Bland-Altman and survival-agreement plots. To evaluate the predictive value of the method in obtaining the total number of neurofibromas, 49 participants also had their tumors counted one by one. Reproducibility was assessed with Pearson's correlation coefficients and simple linear regression model. RESULTS: There was excellent agreement between examiners (ICC range 0.992-0.997) and the total number of skin neurofibromas could be predicted by the adhesive frames technique using a specific formula (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In this article we describe a reliable, easy and rapid technique using paper frames to quantify skin neurofibromas that accurately predicts the total number of these tumors in patients with NF1. This method may be a useful tool in clinical practice and clinical research to help achieve an accurate quantitative phenotype of NF1.","Methods The sample comprised 92 individuals with NF1. Paper frames, with a central square measuring 100 cm 2 , were placed on the back, abdomen and thigh. Images were taken, transferred to a computer and two independent examiners counted the neurofibromas. The average number of neurofibromas/100 cm 2  of skin was obtained from the mean of the three values. The differences in the quantity of neurofibromas counted by two examiners were evaluated with Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), paired  t- test, Bland-Altman and survival-agreement plots. To evaluate the predictive value of the method in obtaining the total number of neurofibromas, 49 participants also had their tumors counted one by one. Reproducibility was assessed with Pearson’s correlation coefficients and simple linear regression model. Methods Case selection This study protocol was approved by the Review Board of the Antônio Pedro University Hospital of Universidade Federal Fluminense, Niterói, RJ, Brazil (#121/11). The individuals’ written, informed consent was obtained and the Declaration of Helsinki protocols were followed. A total of 92 post-pubertal NF1 individuals were included in this research. NF1 diagnosis was based on the clinical criteria of National Institutes of Health [ 2 ]. The exclusion criteria were: presence of a large plexiform neurofibroma on the back, thigh, or abdomen that crossed the midline; history of surgical removal of a large number of skin neurofibromas from back, thigh, or abdomen (more than ten within the five years prior to enrollment in the study); previous treatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, as well as with any drug (such as interferon, retinoic acid, thalidomide, or farnesyl transferase inhibitor) tested for efficacy in neurofibroma treatment. Study design After signing the informed consent, study participants had their data collected: age, gender and skin color. Then, the study participants were clinically evaluated after getting undressed, keeping only their lower underwear. Quantification of neurofibromas using the paper frames method The quantification technique uses paper frames, with a central square measuring 100 cm 2 , which are placed in three specific areas of the body (back, abdomen and thigh) (Figure  1 A). After placing the paper frames on the specific areas, two photographs were taken from each paper frame, using a digital camera (Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W30, Tokyo, Japan). Then, to facilitate the analysis of the photographs, a washable pen was used to mark the cutaneous neurofibromas, as well as the subcutaneous neurofibromas (with the aim to facilitate their distinction from café-au-lait spots). Two additional pictures were taken after marking the neurofibromas. The photographs were obtained with resolution of 300 dpi in JPEG format. Figure 1 
 Paper frames method for counting skin neurofibromas. (A)  Schematic image of paper frames attachment: An adhesive backing from paper frame was removed and it was placed on the individual’s abdomen with a bottom corner placed just left of the individual’s umbilicus, left thigh and back with the top corners put just under the individual’s scapula. If a large plexiform tumor existed on the left side of the abdomen or thigh, the opposite side would have chosen for paper frames attachment.  (B)  The paper frame in the back presenting skin neurofibromas marked by washable pen.  (C)  The process of skin neurofibromas counting using Paint® software (yellow points represent neurofibromas that had already been counted). The images were transferred to a computer and the clearest photograph containing the neurofibromas marked with the washable pen was used to count the tumors (Figure  1 B). All the pictures were analyzed using the software Paint® (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA). The examiner used the spray tool to highlight the skin neurofibromas that had already been counted, avoiding the possibility of counting the same neurofibroma twice (Figure  1 C). The average number of skin neurofibromas per 100 cm 2  of skin was defined as the mean of the three areas. Evaluation of interexaminer reliability of the paper frames method To evaluate the interexaminer reliability of quantification of neurofibromas using the paper frames method, all the pictures were analyzed by two independent trained examiners: RMA (examiner A) and RERM (examiner B). The interexaminer analysis was calculated using the mean of the three counts (abdomen, back and thigh). Evaluation of paper frame method in predicting the total number of skin neurofibromas To evaluate the predictive value of the paper frames method in obtaining the total number of skin neurofibromas, 49 participants of the study had their tumors counted one by one by a trained examiner (RMA; examiner A). Neurofibromas on genitals and scalp were not included. Statistical analysis For statistical analysis, we used the SPSS software (IBM® SPSS®, v. 20.0, Armonk, NY, USA) and Excel 2011 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA).  P  values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the correlation between total number of skin tumors and age of NF1 patients. For this, patients were grouped into five categories of age: <20, 20–29, 30–39, 40–49 and ≥50 years old. For trend across ordering, the Mann-Whitney test was used to evaluate which age groups had significant difference in neurofibroma quantity. The reliability of the paper frames method performed by the two independent examiners was analyzed by ICC, Bland-Altman plot associated with Spearman’s rho correlation coefficient and survival-agreement plot [ 17 , 18 ]. The paired t-test was also used to compare the means of the two examiners. For interexaminer reliability analyses, the results were also evaluated separately according to the skin color of the NF1 individuals and according to the average number of neurofibromas per 100 cm 2  (<100 and ≥100 neurofibromas) with the aim to identify any fixed/proportional bias. The log rank test was applied in the survival-agreement plot to evaluate the difference in the quantity of neurofibromas obtained by both examiners according to skin color. To estimate the inter-method reliability, Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to evaluate whether the average number of neurofibromas in the paper frames corresponded to the estimated number of neurofibromas per 100 cm 2  of skin based on the total number of neurofibromas. To obtain the estimated number of neurofibromas per 100 cm 2  of skin based on the total number of neurofibromas, we used Mosteller’s formula to calculate the body surface area (BSA) [ 19 ]. BSA is defined as the square root of height (in centimeters) multiplied by weight (in kilograms) divided by 3,600. The simple linear regression model was used to build an equation for predicting the approximate total number of skin neurofibromas from the paper frames method. The independent variable was assigned by exact total number of skin neurofibromas (y) and the dependent variable by paper frames method (x). This analysis was taken separately for each examiner. The R squared coefficient (R 2 ) was used to verify the proportion of predictive values that were similar to the exact total number of tumors. Then, a simple linear regression model (y = α + βx) was used to convert the number of skin neurofibromas from the paper frame method into an exact total number of tumors [ 20 ].",Karin S G Cunha; Rafaela E Rozza-de-Menezes; Raquel M Andrade; Amy Theos; Ronir R Luiz; Bruce Korf; Mauro Geller,Orphanet journal of rare diseases,2014-12-05,10.1186/s13023-014-0202-9,minimal,True
PMID:5003511,Neurofibromatosis and leprosy.,"Two patients with neurofibromatosis and leprosy are reported. Both had active lepromatous leprosy and generalized neurofibromata. The bacilli appear in huge numbers within the cytoplasm of the cells making up the neurofibromata, which become distended and resemble lepra cells. Since these cells are believed to derive from Schwann cells, the findings in these patients support the idea that leprosy affects nerves initially by proliferating in Schwann cells and producing changes within them.",,T R Swift,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",1971-12,10.1136/jnnp.34.6.743,abstract_only,False
PMID:24997609,"Asfotase-α improves bone growth, mineralization and strength in mouse models of neurofibromatosis type-1.","Individuals with neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1) can manifest focal skeletal dysplasias that remain extremely difficult to treat. NF1 is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene, which encodes the RAS GTPase-activating protein neurofibromin. We report here that ablation of Nf1 in bone-forming cells leads to supraphysiologic accumulation of pyrophosphate (PPi), a strong inhibitor of hydroxyapatite formation, and that a chronic extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent increase in expression of genes promoting PPi synthesis and extracellular transport, namely Enpp1 and Ank, causes this phenotype. Nf1 ablation also prevents bone morphogenic protein-2-induced osteoprogenitor differentiation and, consequently, expression of alkaline phosphatase and PPi breakdown, further contributing to PPi accumulation. The short stature and impaired bone mineralization and strength in mice lacking Nf1 in osteochondroprogenitors or osteoblasts can be corrected by asfotase-α enzyme therapy aimed at reducing PPi concentration. These results establish neurofibromin as an essential regulator of bone mineralization. They also suggest that altered PPi homeostasis contributes to the skeletal dysplasias associated with NF1 and that some of the NF1 skeletal conditions could be prevented pharmacologically.","Methods Animals and drugs All procedures were approved by the Vanderbilt University Medical Center
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). WT and  Col2-Nf1  KO
mice were generated by crossing  Nf1 flox/flox  mice and
 Nf1 flox/+ ;  α1(II)
collagen-Cre  breeders .  54 , 55 Nf1 flox/flox 
mice and  Nf1 flox/flox  mice; α 1(II)
collagen-Cre  mice were used as WT and cKO, respectively.
 Osx-Nf1  KO mice were generated by breeding doxycycline-fed
 Osx -cre;  Nf1 flox/flox  mice with
 Nf1 flox/flox  breeders . All mice were on a C57BL/6 background. sALP-FcD10 (Asfotase Alfa,
Alexion Pharmaceuticals) was described previously 47 . Briefly, mineral-targeting recombinant tissue nonspecific alkaline
phosphatase (ALP, sALP-FcD10) was produced in CHO cells by modifying the coding sequence
of human  56 ALPL . The GPI anchor sequence of the hydrophobic C-terminal
domain of human ALPL was removed to generate a soluble, secreted enzyme (sALP). Then the
human  ALPL  ectodomain sequence was extended with the coding sequence
encoding the Fc region of human IgG1 (Fc). Finally the C-terminus of the Fc region was
extended with ten aspartic acid residues (D10). The dose of 8.2 mg.kg −1 
per day was selected because it was previously shown to be efficacious in short-term (16
days) efficacy study in  Akp2 −/− mice . The specific activity of the lot used in the present
study was 878 Units.mg 56 −1 . sALP-FcD10 was administered subcutaneously
for the periods of time indicated in the text. Human subjects The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of
Texas Southwestern Medical Center, the Rizzoli Orthopaedic Institute (Bologna, Italy) and
Vanderbilt University. Bone tissues were obtained from 9 patients with NF1 and tibial
pseudarthrosis (aged between 7 months and 18 years) and 6 controls from children without
NF1 who underwent surgery for congenital dysplasia of the hip without any other coexisting
pathology ( n  = 3)  or scoliosis ( 57 n  = 3) (aged between 3.3 and 17
years). Diagnosis of pseudarthrosis was based on radiographic and clinical findings.
Diagnosis of NF1 was performed according to the criteria presented at the National
Institute of Health Consensus Development Conference on Neurofibromatosis
[ http://consensus.nih.gov/1987/1987Neurofibramatosis064html.htm ]. Cell culture Mouse BMSCs were extracted from long bones by spinning down diaphyses at 1500
rpm for 3 min. Cells were then counted, plated at a density of 10 6  cells/well
(12w plates) or 2×10 6  cells/well (6 well plates), and grown for 7 days
in αMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 I.U./ml penicillin, 100
μg/ml streptomycin (Cellgro, Manassas, VA, USA). At day 7, differentiation and
mineralization was induced by the addition of 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid and 10 mM
β-glycerophosphate, and the media was refreshed every 2–3 days. BMSCs
differentiation and mineralization were assessed by ALP activity and Alizarin red S
staining, respectively, using standard protocols. Primary chondrocytes were extracted from 4-day-old pup rib bones. The
cartilaginous part of the rib was dissected and soft tissues removed, then digested by
collagenase D (3mg/ml, Roche, USA) and 0.25% trypsin/ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) (Gibco, USA) in DMEM for 3 h. At confluence, 5×10 μl drops of
concentrated cells (2×10 7  cells/ml) were plated in 6-wells. After 2
hours of incubation, 2 ml of complete cell culture medium was delicately added. Cells were
differentiated in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 IU.ml −1 
penicillin, 100 μg.ml −1  streptomycin, 50
μg.ml −1  of ascorbic acid and 10 mM
β-glycerophosphate. Human cells extracted from bone marrow  or bone tissue were maintained in alpha MEM supplemented with
10% FBS, 100 U.ml 57 −1  penicillin, 0.1 mg.ml −1 
streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere. Cells from bone
tissues were digested overnight with collagenase before platting. After 4 days,
non-adherent cells were removed and adherent bone cells were grown until confluence or
passaged before RNA extraction. Adenovirus Infection of BMSCs BMSCs were isolated from  Nf1 flox/flox  mice and
seeded at a density of 10 6  cells/well in 12w plates. At 40% confluence,
cells were incubated in complete culture medium (α-MEM, 10% FBS and 100
IU.ml −1  penicillin) containing either Ad5-CMV-GFP or Ad5-CMV-cre
(Vector development lab, Baylor College of Medicine) at 2.5×10 9  PFUs.
After 2 days of incubation, the medium was refreshed with complete culture medium.
 Nf1  recombination efficiency was determined according to Wang
 et al . 37 Serum vitamin D, calcium and phosphate assays Blood samples were collected from WT and Osx-Nf1 KO mice at sacrifice. Vitamin
D, phosphate and calcium concentration in mouse serum was determined using a
25OH-Vitamin-D ELISA Assay kit (Eagle Biosciences, cat# VID31-K01), a Phosphate
Assay kit (BioVision, cat # k410–500) and a Calcium Assay kit (BioVision,
cat# k380–250), respectively, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. PPi and PC-1 assays PPi release in cell-conditioned media (ePPi) was measured radiometrically using
differential adsorption on activated charcoal of Uridine-diphospho-D-glucose
[6- 3 H] (Cat #NET1163250UC, Perkin Elmer) as
previously described . Forty

incubated at 37°C for 1h, then adsorbed on 200 μl of charcoal for 10
minutes on ice. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 minutes, 100 μl of the
supernatant was transferred into a vial containing 5 ml of Bio-safe II for radioactivity
count. PPi levels were normalized by protein concentration in cell lysates in each well.
Measurements were performed in triplicate and similar results were obtained from at least
3 independent experiments. ENPP1 activity was determined using 1.5 mM of the synthetic chromogenic
substrate thymidine 5′-monophosphate p-nitrophenyl ester in reaction buffer (100
mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 130 mM NaCl, and 15 mM MgCl 2 ) incubated at 37°C
for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 μl 4N NaOH. Product
formation was monitored by measurement of absorbance at 405 nm. ENPP1 activity in each
well was normalized by cell number. Measurements were performed in triplicate and from at
least 3 independent experiments. RT-qPCR and genomic PCR Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) and
cDNAs were synthesized from 1 μg of RNA following DNase I treatment using the
high-capacity cDNA reverse-transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, USA). Quantitative PCR

Specificity of amplification was verified by the presence of a single peak on the
dissociation curve. Amplification conditions are available upon request. Measurements were
performed in triplicate and from at least 3 independent experiments. For genotyping, genomic DNA was isolated from tail tips by sodium hydroxide
digestion, and PCR was performed using primers P1, P2 and P4, as described by Zhu
 et al 
 . The  54 Col2a1
collagen-Cre  transgene was detected using the fwd: GAGTTGATAGCTGGCTGGTGGCAGATG
and reverse: TCCTCCTGCTCCTAGGGCCTCCTGCAT primers. Western blot analyses Whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis according to
standard protocols. Nitrocellulose membranes were probed with the indicated antibody using
standard protocols (monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma cat# AC-74,
dilution 1: 5000), anti-Phospho-Smad1/5 antibody (Cell Signaling cat#9516S,
dilution 1:1000), anti-Smad1+Smad5 antibody (Abcam cat# ab75273, dilution
1:1000), anti ENPP1/PC-1 (Aviva Systems Biology, cat# OAEB02445, dilution 1:500)
and anti-ANK (Origen, cat# TA325111, dilution 1:1000). Histology Static histomorphometry measurements were performed as previously described in
accordance with standard nomenclature ,
using the Bioquant Analysis System (Nashville, TN, USA) on 5 μm undecalcified
methymethacrylate sections. Calcified cartilage BV/TV was measured in the growth plate
hypertrophic region following von Kossa and van Gieson staining. 60 X-rays and μCT analyses Radiographs were obtained using a digital cabinet X-ray system (LX-60, Faxitron
X-Ray, USA). μCT analyses were performed using a Scanco μCT 40 system
(Scanco Medical, Bassersdorf, Switzerland). Tomographic images were acquired at 55 kVp and
145 mA with an isotropic voxel size of 12 μm and at an integration time of 250 ms
with 500 projections collected per 180° rotation. Raman Spectroscopy To ensure anatomic consistency of data collection site among bones of differing
length, mid-shaft vessel perforations were used as landmarks. Spectra were obtained with 5
accumulations of 20 s exposures with 20 mW laser power at a spot size of 1.5 μm in
diameter. Spectra were processed via least squares modified polynomial fit  and smoothed for noise using an
2 61 nd  order Savitsky-Golay filter . System Raman shift calibration was accomplished using a neon lamp and
a silicon standard. Silicon standard measurements before and after data acquisition
ensured wavenumber calibration consistency. Spectral intensities for known Raman peaks and
peak ratios were extracted using custom Matlab software (Mathworks, Natick, MA) to
generate markers of bone composition for mineralization (v1 Phosphate/Proline) and
crystallinity (crystal grain size and perfection, determined by the inverse full-width at
half maximum intensity of the v1 Phosphate peak). 62 Biomechanical Testing Hydrated samples were tested in three-point bending with a span of 8mm at a rate
of 3 mm.min −1  as per . Force and displacement was measured from a 100 N load cell, and from
the linear variable displacement transformer of the material testing system (Dynamight
8841, Instron, Canton, OH). Structural properties were extracted from force-displacement
curves by custom Matlab algorithms (Mathworks, Natick, MA). Material properties were
calculated by accounting for structure by utilizing cross-sectional area and moment of
inertia as measured by μCT. 63 Statistical analysis Depending on whether data per group passed the Shapiro-Wilk normality test or
whether standard deviations were not different among the groups (Bartlett’s test),
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or the Kruskal-Wallis Test (non-parametric) was used
to determine whether differences existed in μCT -, Raman-, and
biomechanical-derived properties among the experimental groups. When differences existed
at  p  < 0.05, post-hoc, pair-wise comparisons were tested for
significance in which the p-value was adjusted ( p adj  <
0.05) by Holm-Sidak’s method or Dunn’s method (non-parametric).

Functional studies confirm that Notch signaling is active in MPNST cell lines, patient-derived xenografts, and transient cell models of PRC2 deficiency. A combination of MEK and γ-secretase inhibition shows synergy in MPNST cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: We identified PRC2-regulated genes and potential drivers of MPNSTs. Our findings support the Notch pathway as a druggable target in MPNSTs. Our identification of PRC2-regulated genes and pathways could result in more novel therapeutic approaches.","Methods We engineered  NF1 -deficient iHSCs with loss of function  SUZ12  or  EED  mutations. RNA sequencing revealed 1327 differentially expressed genes to define PRC2-regulated genes. To investigate MPNST pathogenesis, we compared genes in iHSCs to consistent gene expression differences between ANF and MPNSTs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing was used to further define targets. Methylome and proteomic analyses were performed to further identify enriched pathways. Materials and Methods Ethics Statement This study did not involve human subjects but utilized genomics data derived from de-identified patient samples. All animal studies were conducted in accordance with the guidelines set forth by the University of Minnesota and federal regulations. The protocols for animal use were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Minnesota. Cell Lines and Reagents We received iHSCs from Dr Margaret Wallace (University of Florida, Gainesville). These are wild-type human neonatal SCs immortalized using the human reverse transcriptase component of telomerase (hTERT) transgenesis and overexpression of murine cyclin–dependent kinase (Cdk4).  To improve modeling ANF and MPNST stages, we stably knocked out  14 NF1  (discussed in Williams et al.),  SUZ12 , and  EED  using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing methods (Williams et al., unpublished manuscript).  We used the published cotransposition method using  15 NF1  and  SUZ12  guide RNAs or transient Cas9/gRNA ribonucleoprotein complexes for  EED.  Single-cell clones were validated using Western blotting and Synthego’s Inference of CRISPR Edits analysis tool ( 16 https://ice.synthego.com ). We also utilized immortalized PN hTERT NF1 ipNF95.6 (iPNF) and MPNST cell lines (sNF96.2 and sNF02.2) from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) with loss of function  NF1  mutations. Other MPNST cell lines and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) were kindly provided by Dr Nancy Ratner (Cincinnati Children’s Hospital) (26T, S462TY, ST88-14, MPNST724), the Characterized Cell Line Core Facility (MD Anderson) (MPNST007), and Dr Christine Pratilas (Johns Hopkins) (JH-2-055 CL, JH-2-079c CL, JH-2-003 CL, JH-2-002 CL).  Cell lines and media are listed in  17–19 Supplementary Table S1 . Sample Preparation and RNA-seq Cell pellets of 3-4 million cells were collected. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and sent to the University of Minnesota Genomics Center. Sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) generating approximately 20 million reads/sample with 150 bp paired end reads. Differential Gene Expression Analysis and Pathway Analysis RNA-seq data ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE263107 ) was trimmed and aligned with Trimmomatic and HISAT2 to the human genome (hg38). Reads were counted using featureCounts.  Differentially expressed genes were identified using DESeq2. 20  Inclusion criteria for differentially expressed genes were an absolute fold change of normalized read counts in pairwise comparison greater than 2 with a false discovery rate (FDR) less than 0.05. Pathway analysis was performed using EnrichR and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) as previously described with the R package,  21 clusterProfiler .  Significantly enriched pathways scored a  22–24 P -value less than .05 and FDR less than 0.25. Transcriptome files for patient samples were provided by our collaborator. 10 Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip Array and Analysis Genome-wide DNA methylation was investigated using the Infinium methylome EPIC array platform (Illumina) at the University of Minnesota Genomics Center. Quality control, filtering, normalization, and statistical testing were performed as previously described.  Differential methylation of probes was identified with  25 limma . Filtering and normalization were performed using  minfi . Average methylation of each gene was constructed using an average of beta values of each probe in the promoter region.  Figure 2  uses the average difference between gene statuses (experimental—control). Sample Preparation and Global Proteomic Analysis by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Multiplexed deep-scale proteome analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was performed at the Broad Institute (Cambridge, MA) as previously described.  Two replicates of 8 lines were used ( 26 Supplementary Table S1 ). Protein was extracted using an 8 M urea solution. Reduction, alkylation, lysis, and digestion steps were performed before tandem mass tag isobaric labeling of peptides. Labeled peptides were run through basic reversed-phase chromatography columns. Five percent of each fraction was collected for proteome analysis by LC-MS/MS. Data were analyzed with Spectrum Mill MS Proteomics Workbench. Differential protein abundance analysis was performed using the R package,  limma . 27 Sample Preparation and ChIP-seq Analysis Four million cells per histone mark were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde (10 min) and quenched with 125 mM glycine (5 min, room temperature). Fixed cells were shipped to the Epigenomics Development Laboratory (Mayo Clinic). Lysed cells were treated with 100 gel units of MNase in MNase digestion buffer (20 min, 37 °C, continuous thermal mixing). Following sonication in Diagenode Bioruptor pico, the supernatant was subjected to ChIP with antibody overnight. ChIP and library preparation followed previous protocols.  Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform at the Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine Medical Genomics Facility. Antibodies, primers, and buffers are detailed in  28 Supplementary Table S1 . Analysis was conducted in-house and at the Mayo Clinic Bioinformatics Core. 29 Western Blot Analysis Cell lines were probed for various Notch pathway components, SUZ12, and controls with antibodies from Cell Signaling Technologies ( Supplementary Table S1 ). Immunoblotting was conducted as previously described.  Blots were imaged on an Odyssey Fc using Image Studio software (LI-COR). CUTLL1 was used as positive controls for NOTCH1, MDA-MB-231 for NOTCH1, NOTCH2, and NOTCH4, and MCF7 for HES1 and NOTCH3. 30 Generation and Use of Transient iHSCs Short interfering RNA treatment— All treatments used SMARTpool ON-TARGETplus Human short interfering RNA (siRNA) (Dharmacon). Transient models of SUZ12 loss were created in iPNF and N0(32) cells using SUZ12 siRNA (5 nmol). Transient models of Notch pathway inhibition were created in ST88-14 cells using NOTCH1, 2, 3, and 4 siRNA (10 nmol). Nontargeting Control siRNA (20 nmol) was used as the control. We followed the manufacturer’s protocol (Dharmacon, 23512) in a 6-well format. EZH2 inhibitor— To simulate transient PRC2 loss, 350000 iPNF and N0(32) cells were treated with 1 µM EZH2 methyltransferase inhibitor (Selleck Chemicals, GSK126) for 10 days before harvesting cell pellets for Western blot. siRNA Proliferation Assay On day 0, 350000 ST88-14 cells were plated in 6-well plates in triplicate. On day 1, cells received siRNA (NOTCH1, 2, 3, 4) treatments in serum-free media. Complete media was added to 2 wells on day 2. One well was seeded into a 96-well plate (5000 cells/well). The 96-well plate was stained with alamarBlue (Invitrogen) to determine proliferation on day 3. Fluorescence measurements were normalized to nontreated control (siNT). Gain of Function Cell Line Generation Gain of function (GOF) lines of  NOTCH1  and  NOTCH3  were made in ST88-14, S462TY, iPNF, and N0(32) target cells using lentiviral transduction. Plasmids are listed in  Supplementary Table S1 .  Lentiviral particles were generated as previously described. 31  Cells were selected with puromycin. 32 Transwell Migration Assay Performed as previously described.  Cells in serum-free media were seeded into wells containing serum media and 8 µm size pore transwell inserts. After 24 hours, inserts were stained with 0.1% crystal violet, imaged with a brightfield microscope, and manually counted. 10 2D Proliferation Assay In 6-well plates, 20000 GOF cells were plated in duplicate. Cell counts were taken daily with a Countess for 5 days and plotted using GraphPad Prism software. Two-way ANOVA was used to determine significant differences in cell count between gene statuses. Quantitative RT-PCR RNA was extracted using the PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript IV First Strand Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription, qPCR reactions, and analysis were performed as previously described.  The dye used was FastStart SYBR Green Master (Sigma-Aldrich). qPCR reaction was performed on a CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). Primer sequences are listed in  30 Supplementary Table S1 . Tumor Microarray Visual Grading Tumor microarray (TMA) blocks were created using patient-derived NF1 tissue samples (IRB #5384) and graded via hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Duplicate 1.0-mm cores were manually arrayed (max 64 cores/block) and processed by HistoWiz. Deparaffinized 4 μm TMA sections underwent standard rehydration and heat antigen retrieval. Staining involved the peroxidase method, hematoxylin counterstaining, dehydration, citrosolv clearing, and Permount mounting. Sections were assessed for tumor sampling, confirming duplicates contained tumor tissue on H&E staining. No-stain and internal negative controls ensured no staining intensity. DAB staining intensity was visually scored (0 = no stain, 1 = low, 2 = medium, 3 = high) independently by G.L.V. following visual training, as described. 33 Small Molecule Inhibitor Study MPNST cell lines (wild-type and GOF) were treated with γ-secretase inhibitor, nirogacestat (Selleckchem, S8018), and mirdametinib (Selleckchem, S1036) in 384-well format for 48 h at the Institute for Drug Discovery and Therapeutics (University of Minnesota). Plating density was 2000 cells/well using a Biomek 2000 (Beckman Coulter). The following day cells received the drug in 12, 2-fold dose format using a LabCyte Echo 550 (Beckman Coulter). Two days later, viability was quantified using alamarBlue according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen) and fluorescence read on a CLARIOstar microplate reader (BMG Labtech). Viability was calculated as previously described (Williams et al., unpublished manuscript).  Drug combinations were in constant ratios. Dose-response curves were generated and IC 15 50  was determined using Graphpad Prism software using a nonlinear regression log(inhibitor) vs response-variable slope model. Combination index values were determined with the median-effect principle using CalcuSyn software (Biosoft). 34 Flow Cytometry ST88-14 were treated with nirogacestat for 48 h. Following treatment, cells were stained with the Dead Cell Apoptosis Kit with Annexin V Alexa Fluor™ 488 & Propidium Iodide following the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen). Cells were also stained with Vybrant™ DyeCycle™ Violet Stain following the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen). Data were acquired using a CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) and 10 000 single cells were analyzed per sample. Data were analyzed using FlowJo.",Minu M Bhunia; Christopher M Stehn; Tyler A Jubenville; Ethan L Novacek; Alex T Larsson; Mahathi Madala; Suganth Suppiah; Germán L Velez-Reyes; Kyle B Williams; Mark Sokolowski; Rory L Williams; Samuel J Finnerty; Nuri A Temiz; Ariel Caride; Aditya V Bhagwate; Nagaswaroop K Nagaraj; Jeong-Heon Lee; Tamas Ordog; Gelareh Zadeh; David A Largaespada,Neuro-oncology advances,2024,10.1093/noajnl/vdae188,minimal,True
PMID:7609078,Retroviral integration at the Evi-2 locus in BXH-2 myeloid leukemia cell lines disrupts Nf1 expression without changes in steady-state Ras-GTP levels.,"Approximately 15% of BXH-2 myeloid leukemias harbor proviral integrations at the Evi-2 common viral integration site. Evi-2 is located within a large intron of the Nf1 tumor suppressor gene, raising the possibility that proviral integration at Evi-2 predisposes mice to myeloid tumor development by disrupting Nf1 expression. This hypothesis is supported by data suggesting that mutations in the human NF1 gene are causally associated with the development of juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia (K. M. Shannon, P. O'Connell, G. A. Martin, D. Paderanga, K. Olson, P. Dinndorf, and F. McCormick, N. Engl. J. Med. 330:597-601, 1994) and mouse studies showing that aged mice, heterozygous for a germ line Nf1 mutation, develop myeloid leukemia with loss of the wild-type Nf1 allele (T. Jacks, T. S. Shih, E. M. Schmitt, R. T. Bronson, A. Bernards, and R. A. Weinberg, Nat. Genet. 7:353-361, 1994). To determine if viral integration at Evi-2 disrupts Nf1 expression, we derived a series of BXH-2 myeloid leukemia cell lines with or without viral integrations at Evi-2. In all cell lines examined, viral integration at Evi-2 resulted in the production of only truncated Nf1 transcripts and no stable, full-length neurofibromin. Although neurofibromin is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for p21ras proteins, its loss in the BXH-2 leukemic cell lines was not correlated with an increased steady-state level of p21ras bound to GTP. These data suggest that neurofibromin is not the sole mediator of Ras-GAP activity in myeloid cells and may have a GAP-independent function in myeloid cells.",,D A Largaespada; J D Shaughnessy; N A Jenkins; N G Copeland,Journal of virology,1995-08,10.1128/JVI.69.8.5095-5102.1995,abstract_only,False
PMID:39016685,Chemical genetic screens reveal defective lysosomal trafficking as synthetic lethal with NF1 loss.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1, a genetic disorder caused by pathogenic germline variations in NF1, predisposes individuals to the development of tumors, including cutaneous and plexiform neurofibromas (CNs and PNs), optic gliomas, astrocytomas, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, high-grade gliomas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), which are chemotherapy- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with poor survival. Loss of NF1 also occurs in sporadic tumors, such as glioblastoma (GBM), melanoma, breast, ovarian and lung cancers. We performed a high-throughput screen for compounds that were synthetic lethal with NF1 loss, which identified several leads, including the small molecule Y102. Treatment of cells with Y102 perturbed autophagy, mitophagy and lysosome positioning in NF1-deficient cells. A dual proteomics approach identified BLOC-one-related complex (BORC), which is required for lysosome positioning and trafficking, as a potential target of Y102. Knockdown of a BORC subunit using siRNA recapitulated the phenotypes observed with Y102 treatment. Our findings demonstrate that BORC might be a promising therapeutic target for NF1-deficient tumors.","MATERIALS AND METHODS Reagents Y102 was originally purchased from Maybridge (NRB04162SC). Subsequent stocks of Y102, along with JW-1, all Y102 analogs, and the azide-tagged form of Y102 were synthesized by Enamine (Kiev, Ukraine). Bortezomib (Bz; S1013), MG-132 (S2619), and Rapamycin (S1039) were purchased from Selleckchem. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate (HCQ; H1126) was purchased from Spectrum Chemical. tert-Butyl hydroperoxide solution (tBHP; 458139), carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP; C2759) and hydroxyurea (HU; H8627) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Staurosporine (STS; S-9300) was purchased from LC Laboratories. Cobalt (II) chloride (CoCl 2 ; 36554) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Q-VD-OPh hydrate (QVD; 50-101-3174) was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Stock solutions of compounds were prepared in 100% DMSO (Alfa Aesar) apart from HCQ and CoCl 2 , which were prepared fresh in DMEM (Corning Life Sciences) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Life Technologies). Cell culture U87-MG, U251-MG, and sNF96.2 cells were purchased from ATCC. ipnNF95.11C and ipNF95.11b ‘C’ cells were kindly provided by Peggy Wallace, University of Florida, USA and are available for purchase through the ATCC. Immortalized mammary epithelial cells (IMECs) were a gift from James DiRenzo, Euroleader, Houston, TX, USA. U87-MG, U251-MG, ipnNF95.11C and ipNF95.11b ‘C’ cell lines were cultured in DMEM with L-glutamine, 4.5 g/l glucose and sodium pyruvate (Corning Life Sciences) with the addition of 10% (v/v) FBS (Atlanta Biologicals, Life Technologies or Gibco, Thermo Fischer Scientific). sNF96.2 cells were cultured in DMEM with 4 mM L-glutamine, 4.5 g/l glucose, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 1.5 g/l sodium bicarbonate (ATCC) with the addition of 10% (v/v) FBS. IMECs were cultured in DMEM/F12 (1:1) supplemented with 5% FBS, 2 mM glutamine (Gibco), 5 μg/ml insulin (Akron Biotech), 500 μg/ml hydrocortisone (MP Biomedical) and 10 ng/ml recombinant human epidermal growth factor (Promega). All cell lines were grown at 37°C in 5% CO 2 , passaged regularly using PBS and 0.25% trypsin (Corning), and routinely screened for mycoplasma contamination using the MycoProbe kit (R&D Systems). Although the currently available U87-MG cell line from ATCC differs from those derived from the original tumor, it is considered to be a human glioblastoma cell line of unknown origin ( Allen et al., 2016 ). In the context of this work, U87-MG cells serve as an NF1-deficient tumor cell line model, due to elevated proteasome-mediated degradation of the NF1 protein ( McGillicuddy et al., 2009 ). U87-MG cells have been used a model of an NF1-deficient tumor cell line in multiple studies ( Allaway et al., 2016 ,  2017 ;  Daginakatte and Gutmann, 2007 ;  McGillicuddy et al., 2009 ;  See et al., 2012 ). Yeast dose–response curves S. cerevisiae  strains were plated at an optical density at 600 nm (OD 600 ) of 0.05 in 96-well plates (Falcon) and grown in Synthetic Complete medium (recipe according to Cold Spring Harbor Protocols  https://cshprotocols.cshlp.org/content/2016/11/pdb.rec090589.full?sid=65431fb9-2fc5-4685-bbe6-85343665fa93 ) containing compound starting at 100 µM, followed by 2-fold serial dilutions to generate a 10-point range of concentrations in quadruplicate; one column was treated with equivalent amounts of DMSO (≤1%) as a control. Yeast were incubated for 18 h, after which the optical density was read using a Spectramax M2 (Molecular Devices) at a wavelength of 600 nm and normalized to DMSO. Hoechst cell viability assays Cells were plated at 2500 cells/well in 96-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. In the case of ipnNF95.11C and ipNF95.11b ‘C’, cells were plated at 5000 cells/well in 96-well plates. Medium was removed and replaced with medium containing compound starting at 20 µM or 100 µM, followed by 2-fold serial dilutions to generate a 10-point range of concentrations in quadruplicate; one column was treated with equivalent amounts of DMSO (≤1%) as a control. Cells were incubated for the indicated timepoints. Upon collection, medium was removed, cells were rinsed with PBS, and stored at −80°C until all plates were collected. To process cells, plates were thawed with PBS, incubated with 1× saline-sodium citrate (SSC) buffer with 0.02% SDS for 1 h at 37°C, followed by staining with 1 µg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Pierce). Absorbance was read using a Spectramax M2 at an excitation of 355 nm and an emission of 460 nm, and absorbance was normalized to DMSO. Cell viability assays using alamarBlue Cells were plated at 5000 cells/well in 96-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. Medium was removed and replaced with medium containing compound starting at 20 µM or 100 µM, followed by 2-fold serial dilutions to generate a 10-point range of concentrations in quadruplicate; one column was treated with equivalent amounts of DMSO (≤1%) as a control. Cells were incubated for 72 h. At 3 h prior to the end of incubation, alamarBlue (Invitrogen) was added to a final concentration of 5% v/v. Fluorescence was read using a Spectramax M2 at an excitation of 544 nm and an emission of 590 nm, and fluorescence was normalized to DMSO. Generation of NF1-deficient IMEC lines using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing A single guide RNA (sgRNA) was utilized to disrupt  NF1  in exon 2: 5′-GTTGTGCTCAGTACTGACTT-3′ ( Shalem et al., 2014 ). IMECs were plated at 900,000 cells per 10 cm plate and were allowed to adhere overnight. The next day, cells were transfected with lentiCRISPRv2 (# 52961  Addgene) and gRNA at a 3:1 ratio using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Clones were selected following 3 days of puromycin selection and confirmed to have loss of NF1 protein by western blotting. Immunofluorescence staining U87-MG cells were plated at a concentration of 50,000 cells/well onto pre-coated poly-D-lysine (PDL) coverslips (Neuvitro) in 24-well plates (Falcon) and allowed to adhere overnight. Medium was removed and replaced with treatment-laced medium normalized to DMSO, and cells were treated for the indicated timepoints. At the time of collection, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde without methanol (EMS); in the case of anti-γ-H2AX, cells were fixed with 100% methanol (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Coverslips were washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Following permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific), coverslips were blocked for 1 h at room temperature (RT) in IF buffer (PBS containing 0.05% azide, 0.2% Triton X-100 and 2% normal goat serum or, for 8-OHG, normal donkey serum). For anti-LAMP1 staining, an additional permeabilization step in 100% methanol was included prior to permeabilizing with Triton X-100. The following primary antibodies were used for 1 h at RT unless specified: Alexa Fluor 488 pre-conjugated anti-γ-H2AX (N1-431) mouse monoclonal (1:50 for 30 min; cat. no 560445, BD Biosciences), anti-cleaved caspase 3 (Asp175) rabbit polyclonal (1:200; cat. no 9661, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-SQSTM1/p62 (D-3) mouse monoclonal (1:500; cat. no sc-28359, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-8-hydroxyguanosine goat polyclonal (1:200; cat. no DR1001, Millipore), anti-BNIP3L/Nix (D4R4B) rabbit monoclonal (1:200, overnight at 4°C; cat. no 12396, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-Tom20 (FL-145) rabbit polyclonal (1:200; cat. no sc-11415, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-LAMP1 (D4O1S) mouse monoclonal (1:100, overnight at 4°C; cat. no 15665, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-FLAG (M2) mouse monoclonal (1:500 for 2 h at 37°C; cat. no F1804, Sigma-Aldrich). Following washes with PBST, cells were stained with goat anti-rabbit-IgG or goat anti-mouse-IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 594 (or, for 8-OHG, donkey anti-goat-IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488) secondary antibody at 1:800 for 1 h at RT (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Coverslips were washed with PBST following secondary staining, cells were stained with 0.33 μg/ml DAPI in PBS and mounted onto slides in ProLong Gold (Life Technologies). For MitoTracker Red CMXRos staining, 30 min prior to collection, medium was removed and replaced with medium containing MitoTracker Red CMXRos at a final concentration of 100 nM (Molecular Probes). Following staining, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde without methanol. Cells were washed with PBST, then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. When co-staining with an additional marker, the staining procedure continued with the blocking step; otherwise, cells were stained with 0.33 μg/ml DAPI in PBS and mounted onto slides in ProLong Gold (Life Technologies). To visualize the localization of az-Y102 using immunofluorescence, cells were treated for 2 h with az-Y102, DMSO or parent compound Y102, medium was removed and replaced with normal medium, and cells were incubated for a total of 24 h. Following treatment, cells were washed, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde without methanol (EMS), and permeabilized using 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. Samples were stained with alkyne-488 at a final concentration of 1 µM following the Click-iT cell reaction buffer kit (Invitrogen) protocol. Following washes with 2% BSA, the staining procedure continued with the blocking step as described above. All confocal images were acquired on a Nikon A1RSi confocal microscope equipped with a 60×1.4 NA oil objective, a DU4 detector unit and Nikon Elements software. Otherwise, images were acquired on a Zeiss Axio Imager.Z1 equipped with a Zeiss EC Plan-NEOFLUAR 40×1.3 NA oil objective, a Zeiss AxioCam MRm camera, a Lumen Dynamics Series 120 Q X-Cite Fluorescence Illuminator, and AxioVision SE64 Rel. 4.9.1 software. Image processing was performed with Fiji, built on ImageJ2. MV-151 proteasome active site inhibition assay U87-MG cells were plated at 500,000 cells/well in six-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight (Falcon). Medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium containing 2 µM, 4 µM or 10 µM Y102 or equivalent amounts of vehicle DMSO (≤1%) and treated for 24 h. As a positive control, one well was treated for 2 h with 1 µM Bz and 10 µM MG-132. Cells were collected after treatment by washing with PBS, harvested with trypsin plus agitation to detach cells, spun down in a centrifuge (400   for 5 min), and resuspended in PBS to wash. Cells were transferred to 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes, pelleted (600  g  for 5 min) and resuspended in 20 µl digitonin lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 250 mM sucrose, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM DTT and 0.05% digitonin). Cells were mixed by pipetting, incubated on ice for 20 min, and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation (≥18,000  g  for 20 min). Protein concentrations were determined using a Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). 10 µg of protein lysate was incubated for 20 min with 20 µM MV-151 in a 37°C water bath. 4× loading dye was added to the samples and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 4–15% polyacrylamide gradient gel (Bio-Rad). Gels were imaged on a Typhoon scanner at an excitation of 532 nm and an emission of 560 nm to detect MV-151 fluorescence. Following imaging, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose. The blot was probed for α-tubulin as a loading control. Experiments were repeated twice, and a representative image is shown. g Western blotting U87-MG cells were plated at 500,000 cells/well in six-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight (Falcon). Medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium containing drugs or compounds for the indicated timepoints. Cells were collected after treatment by washing with PBS, harvested with trypsin plus agitation to detach cells, pelleted in a centrifuge (400   for 5 min) and resuspended in PBS to wash. Cells were transferred to 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes, pelleted (600  g  for 5 min), and resuspended in RIPA lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% nonidet P40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.05% SDS) containing 1 mM NaVO g 4 , 1 mM NaF, 1 mM PMSF, 0.1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μM aprotinin, 100 μM benzamidine HCl, 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 μg/ml pepstatin and 0.1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. Lysates were sonicated (2 × 5 s), incubated on ice for 15 min, and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation (≥18,000   for 20 min). Protein levels were quantified using a BCA assay kit (Pierce). 50 µg of protein was prepared in 1× Laemmli sample buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 0.02% (w/v) Bromophenol Blue, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol and 12.5 mM EDTA] and separated by SDS-PAGE on a 4–15% polyacrylamide gradient gel (Bio-Rad). Western blots for NF1 and phospho(p)-ERK were performed as above except lysates were run using a 3–8% NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen). Protein was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST and probed with anti-NF1 (D7R7D) rabbit monoclonal (cat. no 14623, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000, overnight at 4°C), anti-PARP (46D11) rabbit monoclonal (cat. no 9532, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:5000, overnight at 4°C), anti-BNIP3L/Nix (D4R4B) rabbit monoclonal (cat. no 12396, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000, overnight at 4°C), anti-p62/SQSTM-1 (D-3) mouse monoclonal (cat. no sc-28359, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1000, 1 h at RT), anti-LC3BI/II rabbit polyclonal (cat. no #2775, Cell Signaling, 1:1000, overnight at 4°C), anti-C17orf59/BORCS6 rabbit polyclonal (cat. no  g PA566346 , Invitrogen, 1:1000, overnight at 4°C), anti-GAPDH (14C10) rabbit monoclonal (cat. no 2118, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:2500, 1 h at RT), or anti-α-tubulin (B-1-2-5) mouse monoclonal (cat. no sc-23948, Santa Cruz Biotehcnology, 1:10,000, 1 h at RT) primary antibody in 2% milk in TBST. Secondary labeling was performed with a 1-h incubation in 1:10,000 anti-rabbit-IgG conjugated to HRP or anti-mouse-IgG conjugated to HRP (Jackson Immunoresearch) antibody diluted in 2% milk in TBST. The film was exposed to ECL-coated blots (Pierce) and developed using a standard film processor. Blot transparency images can be viewed in  Fig. S4 . Flow cytometry U87-MG cells were plated at 500,000 cells/well in a six-well plate and allowed to adhere overnight. The medium was replaced with cell culture medium containing equivalent amounts of DMSO (≤1%), 2 µM Y102, 100 nM doxorubicin or 100 µM CoCl 2  for 24 h. At the end of the incubation, cells were rinsed twice with PBS, trypsinized, and rinsed again with PBS prior to fixation with BD cytofix/cytoperm for 30 min on ice. After washing with BD perm/wash twice, cells were stained with DAPI at a final concentration 0.33 µg/ml in PBS for 30 min on ice. Cells were washed twice more with BD perm/wash and resuspended in PBS for analysis. The cells were transferred to flow cytometry tubes (14-961-10, Fisherbrand) and analyzed using a MacsQuant VYB 8-color flow cytometer. DNA content was detected using the V1 channel. This experiment was repeated twice, and the percentage of cells in each cell cycle stage is shown. 50,000 events per sample were collected and cellular debris was gated out of the dataset. RT-qPCR to measure  BNIP3L  transcript levels U87-MG cells were plated into six-well plates at 250,000 cells/well and allowed to adhere overnight. The next day, cells were treated for 6 h with Y102 or vehicle control; RNA was collected at the endpoint using the RNAeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). A total of 1.5 µl of RNA was converted into cDNA using first-strand cDNA synthesis kit SuperScript II RT (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was prepared with SYBR Green qPCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) and qPCR was performed using primers against  BNIP3L  or the internal control 18S on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) in triplicate. ΔΔ Ct  was used to calculate relative gene expression. The following qPCR primer sequences were used:  BNIP3L  forward, 5′-AATGTCGTCCCACCTAGTCG-3′;  BNIP3L  reverse 5′-TAGCTCCACCCAGGAACTGT-3′; 18S rRNA forward, 5′-ATACAGCCAGGTCCTAGCCA-3′; 18S rRNA reverse, 5′-AAGTGACGCAGCCCTCTATG-3′. Cellular thermal shift assay and TMT 10-plex labeling U87-MG cells were plated into two 10 cm tissue culture dishes at a concentration that would result in a yield of ∼1.5 mg total protein per plate on the day of collection. Cells were treated with 2 µM Y102, 2 µM JW-1 or the equivalent amount of DMSO (≤1%) for 2 h. The medium was removed and collected in a conical tube; cells were rinsed with PBS and trypsinized. Cells were re-suspended in 1 ml PBS with protease inhibitors (Roche), equating to a protein concentration of ∼1 mg/ml. 100 µl of resuspended cells were transferred to PCR tubes and incubated for 3 min in thermal cyclers preheated to the following temperatures: 37, 37, 44.7, 48.4, 52.3, 55, 58, 60.2, 63.3, 66.3 and 70 (°C). Cells were lysed by freeze-thaw and centrifuged at 21,100   for 20 min at 4°C. Supernatants were removed to a fresh 0.5 ml Eppendorf tube. g Supernatant from the duplicate 37°C treatment condition was used to determine protein concentration through a BCA assay. This allowed for the quantitative transfer of 50 µg of protein in each of the remaining tubes to a fresh 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube. Proteins were denatured with 7 M urea, reduced with DTT and alkylated with iodoacetamide. Urea was diluted to a concentration of <1 M with Tris-HCl pH 8.1 and proteins were digested with proteomics grade trypsin. Peptides were acidified and desalted via solid-phase extraction and evaporated by vacuum centrifugation. Each temperature treatment was differentially labeled using TMT-10-plex reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). TMT LC-MS/MS analyses The Orbitrap Fusion was operated with an Orbitrap MS1 scan at 120K resolution and an AGC target value of 500K. The maximum injection time was 100 ms, the  m / z  range was 350 to 1300 and the dynamic exclusion window was 30 s. Precursor ions were selected for MS2 using quadrupole isolation (0.6  m / z  isolation width) in a ‘top speed’ (3 s duty cycle), data-dependent manner. Ion charge states of +2 through +5 were selected for MS2 by collision induced dissociation (CID) fragmentation (32% CID energy) and ion trap analysis. The MS2 scan maximum injection time was 60 ms and AGC target value was 8K. MS2 fragment ions were selected for synchronous precursor selection (SPS)-MS3 analysis in a top 10 data-dependent manner. MS3 scans were generated through higher energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD) fragmentation (55% HCD energy) and Orbitrap analysis at 60K resolution, with a scan range of 110 to 750  m / z . The MS3 scan maximum injection time was 200 ms and AGC target value was 50K. Click chemistry sample TCA precipitation and LC-MS/MS analyses 4×10 7  cells were plated into a total of 3–15 cm dishes per treatment condition and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were treated for 2 h with the equivalent amount of DMSO (≤1%), 2 µM Y102 or 2 µM azide-tagged Y102. Following treatment, cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized and resuspended in 850 µl urea lysis buffer (8 M urea, 200 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 4% CHAPS, 1 M NaCl) from the Click-iT Protein Enrichment Kit (Molecular Probes). Samples were incubated on ice for 10 min prior to sonication six times for 3 s each. Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000   for 10 min, then 800 µl of the lysate was added to 200 µl of alkyne-bound resin slurry and 1 ml of catalyst solution containing copper (II) sulfate at a final concentration of 1 mM. Slurries were rotated end-over-end at RT for 18 h. Following this, samples were reduced using 1 M DTT and 7.4 mg/ml of iodoacetamide, stringently washed using SDS wash buffer, 8 M urea, and 20% acetonitrile, precipitated in 20% TCA, and washed in 10% TCA and cold acetone. Precipitated proteins were digested with trypsin and peptides identified by LC-MS/MS on an Orbitrap Fusion as described below. g LC-MS/MS analyses of TCA precipitated material LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with an EASY-nLC 1000 ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatograph (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were dissolved in loading buffer [5% methanol (Fisher)/1.5% formic acid] and injected directly onto an in-house pulled polymer-coated fritless fused silica analytical resolving column (40 cm length, 100 µm inner diameter; PolyMicro) packed with ReproSil, C18 AQ 1.9 µm 120 Å pore (Dr. Maisch). Samples were separated with a 90-min gradient of 4 to 33% LC-MS buffer B (LC-MS buffer A: 0.125% formic acid, 3% ACN; LC-MS buffer B: 0.125% formic acid, 95% ACN) at a flow rate of 330 nl/min. The Orbitrap Fusion was operated with an Orbitrap MS1 scan at 120K resolution and an AGC target value of 500K. The maximum injection time was 100 ms, the scan range was 350 to 1500  m / z  and the dynamic exclusion window was 15 s (±15 ppm from precursor ion  m / z ). Precursor ions were selected for MS2 using quadrupole isolation (0.7  m / z  isolation width) in a ‘top speed’ (2 s duty cycle), data-dependent manner. MS2 scans were generated through HCD fragmentation (29% HCD energy) and Orbitrap analysis at 15 K resolution. Ion charge states of +2 through +4 were selected for HCD MS2. The MS2 scan maximum injection time was 60 ms and the AGC target value was 60 K. Peptide spectral matching and bioinformatics Raw data were searched using COMET against a target-decoy version of the human ( Homo sapiens ) proteome sequence database (UniProt; downloaded 2013; 20,241 total proteins) with a precursor mass tolerance of ±1.00 Da and requiring fully tryptic peptides with up to three missed cleavages, carbamidomethyl cysteine as a fixed modification and oxidized methionine as a variable modification ( Eng et al., 2013 ). For TMT experiments, the TMT reagent mass was searched as a static modification on lysine residues and peptide N-termini. The resulting peptide spectral matches were filtered to <1% false discovery rate (FDR) by defining thresholds of decoy hit frequencies at particular mass measurement accuracy (measured in parts-per-million from theoretical), XCorr and delta-XCorr (dCn) values. TPP-TR analyses were performed using the R statistical programming language ( http://www.R-project.org ) ( Franken et al., 2015 ). siRNA knockdown To knockdown BORCS6, cells were plated at 200,000 cells/well in six-well plates, 50,000 cells/well on precoated PDL coverslips in 24-well plates, or 5000 cells/well in 96-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. The next day, cells were transfected with negative control siRNA (Ambicon; #AM4611) or siRNA targeting BORCS6 (Invitrogen; HSS123247) at a final concentration of 2 pmol/µl and lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM medium (Gibco), and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature prior to drop-wise addition to cells. At 24 h after transfection, reagents were added to the culture, and medium was removed and replaced with normal growth medium. Cells were incubated for a total of 72 h before collection. β-galactosidase senescence assay U87-MG cells were plated at 100,000 cells/well and allowed to adhere overnight. Medium was removed and replaced with medium containing equivalent amount of DMSO (≤1%), 2 µM Y102 or 100 nM doxorubicin for a total of 72 h. Cells were collected and stained for β-galactosidase using the Senescence β-Galactosidase Staining Kit (Cell Signaling). 100 cells were counted per condition; the graph represents results from triplicate experiments. Stable transfection of BORCS6 in U87-MG cells To establish U87-MG cells overexpressing BORCS6, cells were plated at 100,000 cells/well in a 12-well plate and allowed to adhere overnight. The next day, cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector or pBORCS6 (GenScript) at a final concentration of 8 ng/µl and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM medium (Gibco), and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at RT prior to drop-wise addition to cells. At 24 h after transfection, reagents were added to the culture, and medium was removed and replaced with normal growth medium containing 1000 µM G418 (Gibco). After several days, pBORCS6 underwent clonal selection; expression of BORCS6 was confirmed by immunofluorescence.",Stephanie J Bouley; Andrew V Grassetti; Robert J Allaway; Matthew D Wood; Helen W Hou; India R Burdon Dasbach; William Seibel; Jimmy Wu; Scott A Gerber; Konstantin H Dragnev; James A Walker; Yolanda Sanchez,Journal of cell science,2024-08-01,10.1242/jcs.262343,minimal,True
PMID:32406525,Autism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders and symptoms in children with neurofibromatosis type 1.,"AIM: To evaluate if autism symptoms and diagnoses are more common in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) than in typically developing children, to which levels, and to determine if co-occurring attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptomatology accounts for this increase. METHOD: We searched hospital electronic medical records (EMR) for International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision NF1 and co-occurring diagnoses codes. We recruited a subsample of 45 children (mean age 9y 2mo; SD 2y 7mo; range 5-12y; 22 males, 23 females) and collected parental reports of autism symptomatology, adaptive behavior, and behavioral problems that were compared to those of 360 age- and sex-matched controls from the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC) with autism spectrum disorder (ASD; SSC-ASD) or typically developing (SSC-TD). RESULTS: The EMR search identified 968 children with NF1; 8.8% had ADHD and 2.1% had ASD co-occurring diagnoses. In the subsample, the mean autism scale score for participants with NF1 was below cut-off for significant autism symptoms. Participants with NF1 had significantly more autism and behavioral symptoms than SSC-TD participants, and significantly less than SSC-ASD participants, with one exception: ADHD symptom levels were similar to those of SSC-ASD participants. In analyses that controlled for internalizing, ADHD, and communication scores, the difference in autism symptom levels between participants with NF1 and typically developing controls disappeared almost entirely. INTERPRETATION: Our results do not support an association between NF1 and autism, both at the symptom and disorder levels. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Diagnoses of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were more common in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) than in the general child population. Diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder were no more common in children with NF1 than in the general child population. Increases in autism symptoms did not reach clinically significant thresholds. Co-occurring ADHD symptoms accounted for increased autism questionnaire scores. Adaptive behavior in participants with NF1 showed normal socialization but lower communication proficiency. OBJETIVO: Evaluar si el diagnóstico y los síntomas de autismo son más frecuentes en niños con neurofibromatosis tipo 1 (NF1) comparado a niños con desarrollo típico, cuáles son los niveles de severidad, y determinar si la sintomatología concurrente debido déficit de atención / hiperactividad (TDAH) explica la frecuencia. MÉTODO: Se realizaron búsquedas en los registros médicos electrónicos hospitalarios (EMR) para el diagnóstico de NF1 y códigos concurrentes en la Clasificación Internacional de Enfermedades, 10ma revisión. Reclutamos una submuestra de 45 niños (edad promedio 9 años 2 meses; DE 2 años 7 meses; rango 5-12 años; 22 varones y 23 mujeres). Recolectamos informes parentales acerca de la sintomatología del autismo, comportamiento adaptativo y problemas de conducta que se compararon con los de 360 niños pareados por edad y sexo provenientes de la Colección Simons Simplex (SSC) de niños con trastorno del espectro autista (SSC-ASD) o de niños con desarrollo típico (SSC-TD). RESULTADOS: La búsqueda de EMR identificó a 968 niños con NF1; 8,8% tenían TDAH y 2,1% tenían diagnósticos concurrentes de trastorno del espectro autista. En la submuestra de participantes con NF1, la media de puntaje de la escala de autismo fue inferior punto de corte. Los participantes con NF1 tuvieron significativamente más síntomas de autismo y problemas de conducta que los participantes de SSC-TD, y significativamente menos que los participantes de SSC-ASD. Hubo una excepción: los niveles de síntomas de TDAH fueron similares a los de los participantes de SSC-ASD. En los análisis que controlaron los síntomas internalizantes, el TDAH y los puntajes de comunicación, la diferencia en los niveles de síntomas de autismo entre los participantes con NF1 y los controles con desarrollo típico desaparecieron casi por completo. INTERPRETACIÓN: Nuestros resultados no respaldan una asociación entre NF1 y autismo, tanto a nivel de frecuencia de los síntomas, ni con la severidad de los mismos. OBJETIVO: Avaliar se sintomas e diagnóstico de autismo são mais comuns em crianças com neurofibromtose tipo 1 (NF1) do que em crianças com desenvolvimento típico, em quais níveis, e determinar se co-ocorrência de sintomatologia do transtorno do déficit de atenção e hiperatividade (TDAH) explica este aumento. MÉTODO: Pesquisamos registros médicos eletrônicos (RME) hospitalares quanto aos códigos diagnósticos de NF1 e diagnósticos co-ocorrentes segundo a Classificação Internacional de Doenças, 10ª revisão.

RESULTADOS: A busca em RME identificou 968 crianças com NF1; 8,8% tinha TDAH e 2,1% tinha diagnóstico concomitante de TEA. Na sub-amostra, o escore médio de autismo para os participantes com NF1 estava abaixo do ponto de corte para sintomas autistas significantes. Os participantes com NF1 tiveram significativamente mais sintomas de autismo e comportamento do que os participantes SSC-DT, e significativamente menos do que os participantes SSC-TEA, com uma exceção: os níveis de sintomas de TDAH foram similares aos participantes SSC-TEA. Na análise que controlou para escores internalizantes, TDAH e comunicação, a diferença nos níveis de sintomas autistas entre participantes com NF1 e desenvolvimento típico desapareceu quase totalmente.

PMID:21157378,Neurofibromatosis-1 heterozygosity increases microglia in a spatially and temporally restricted pattern relevant to mouse optic glioma formation and growth.,"Whereas carcinogenesis requires the acquisition of driver mutations in progenitor cells, tumor growth and progression are heavily influenced by the local microenvironment. Previous studies from our laboratory have used Neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) genetically engineered mice to characterize the role of stromal cells and signals to optic glioma formation and growth. Previously, we have shown that Nf1+/- microglia in the tumor microenvironment are critical cellular determinants of optic glioma proliferation. To define the role of microglia in tumor formation and maintenance further, we used CD11b-TK mice, in which resident brain microglia (CD11b+, CD68+, Iba1+, CD45low cells) can be ablated at specific times after ganciclovir administration. Ganciclovir-mediated microglia reduction reduced Nf1 optic glioma proliferation during both tumor maintenance and tumor development. We identified the developmental window during which microglia are increased in the Nf1+/- optic nerve and demonstrated that this accumulation reflected delayed microglia dispersion. The increase in microglia in the Nf1+/- optic nerve was associated with reduced expression of the chemokine receptor, CX3CR1, such that reduced Cx3cr1 expression in Cx3cr1-GFP heterozygous knockout mice led to a similar increase in optic nerve microglia. These results establish a critical role for microglia in the development and maintenance of Nf1 optic glioma.","Materials and Methods Mouse and human specimens Mice were used in accordance to established Animal Studies Protocols at the Washington University School of Medicine.   ( Nf1 flox/- ; GFAP-Cre ),  Nf1 +/-GFAP CKO  ( Nf1 flox/- ; GFAP-Cre; CD11b-TK ), CD11b-TK ( Nf1 +/-GFAP CKO-TK 22 ),   ( Cx3cr1+/GFP 23 ),  , wild type (WT) and  Nf1 +/- ;Cx3cr1+/GFP  mice were all maintained on a C57BL/6 background. The  Nf1 +/-  optic gliomas lack the Rosenthal fibers and eosinophilic granular bodies that are characteristic of human pilocytic astrocytomas, but otherwise closely resemble pediatric low-grade gliomas, based on the presence of discrete optic nerve/chiasm masses composed of hyperproliferating astrocytes with large hyperchromatic nuclei, low proliferative indices, new blood vessel formation, microglia infiltration, Olig2-immunoreactive cells, and contrast enhancement on small-animal MRI ( Nf1 +/-GFAP CKO 8 ); there is no evidence of endothelial hyperplasia or necrosis. Human tumor specimens were used in accordance with established guidelines under an active and approved Human Studies Protocol. Human glioma specimens were studied using 2 individual tissue microarrays developed at the Mayo Clinic Foundation and Washington University School of Medicine, as previously reported ( 24 ,  25 ). Non-neoplastic human brain samples from the neocortex were obtained from autopsy materials acquired under an approved Human Studies Protocol at the Washington University School of Medicine. Immunohistochemistry Mice were perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Optic nerves and optic chiasms were dissected and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4°C. All specimens were then processed for paraffin embedding and sectioning in the Ophthalmology Histology Core or the Histology and Microscopy Core at Washington University School of Medicine. Slides were deparaffinized in xylene and subjected to antigen retrieval. After the washing and blocking steps, sections were incubated overnight with rabbit anti-Iba1 (1:3000; Wako, Richmond, VA), mouse anti-Ki67 (1:500; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), or rat anti-CD34 (1:50; BD Biosciences) followed by incubation with biotinylated secondary antibodies (1:200; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) at room temperature (RT) for 1 hour. Immunoreactivity was visualized with the Vectastain ABC system and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine, Vector NovaRED, or Vector SG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). All sections were photographed using a digital camera attached to a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope. For each optic nerve counted, 3 photographs were taken at a magnification of 10× for at least 4 mice/group, including the optic chiasm and the right or left optic nerve just anterior to the chiasm ( Supplemental Fig. 1A ). For brainstem and neocortex regions, 4 photographs were taken at a magnification of 10× for at least 4 mice/group ( Supplemental Fig. 1B, C ). The total number of Iba1-positive cells was quantitated in the mouse pre-chiasmatic optic nerves, chiasm, brainstem, and neocortex, as previously described, with the investigator blinded to the genotype and treatment ( 26 ). All Iba1-positive cells were counted regardless of morphology (amoeboid vs. ramified). In the human tumors, the number of Iba1-positive cells was calculated as a percentage of the total number of nucleated cells. Immunofluorescence After transcardial perfusion with Ringer's solution (147 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 2.2 mM CaCl 2 ·2H 2 O, with 2.5 USP units/mL heparin sodium injection, 0.02mg/mL lidocaine HCL), WT mouse optic nerves and chiasms were dissected and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4°C. Tissues were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), embedded in OCT embedding media (Tissue-Tek, Miles, Inc., Elkhart, IN), cut into 10-μm sections in a cryostat, collected on Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and stored at -20°C. Slides were washed, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate buffer, blocked, incubated overnight at 4°C with rabbit anti-Iba1 (1:2000), rat anti-CD11b (M1/70, 1:10; BD Biosciences), or mouse anti-Ki67 (1:500; BD Biosciences), followed by incubation with fluorescent secondary antibodies (1:200 goat anti-rat A488, goat anti-rabbit A568, or goat anti-mouse A488; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 1 hour at RT. In all cases, no specific immunostaining was observed in the negative control samples. Images were acquired using an Olympus multichannel confocal microscope in the Washington University Bakewell Neuroimaging Core Facility and Image J image analysis software ( http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/ ; Wayne Rasband, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD) was used to obtain a single collapsed image from an optical stack. Ganciclovir treatment Ganciclovir (GCV; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and administered at a dosage of 50 mg/kg. For the experiments focused on determining the acute effects of microglia ablation on optic glioma proliferation,   mice were divided into 2 groups: One group received daily intraperitoneal GCV injections for 2 weeks starting at 3 weeks or 3 months of age, while the other group received daily intraperitoneal injections of vehicle (PBS) starting at 3 weeks or 3 months of age. Nf1 +/-GFAP CKO-TK Flow cytometry Microglia from mice were collected using previously described procedures with minor modifications ( 27 ). Briefly, for each experiment, optic nerves and chiasms harvested from 7 to 10 mice, transcardially perfused with Ringer's solution, were homogenized through a 70-μm nylon filter (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), enzymatically digested in Hanks Buffered Salt Solution without calcium and magnesium containing 0.05% collagenase I (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1 μg/mL Nα-Tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone hydrochloride (TLCK, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.01 mg/mL bovine deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I, Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mM Hepes buffer (pH7.4) for 1 hour at RT, and filtered through a 40-μm nylon filter (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Brainstem specimens were similarly processed to obtain cells for flow cytometry controls. A discontinuous Percoll gradient (Amersham/GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI) of 30%, 37%, and 70% allowed for collection of an enriched macrophage and microglia sample from the 37% to 70% interface. Alternately, magnetic cell sorting using CD11b microbeads after myelin removal (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) were used to extract the CD11b+ microglia population. After Fc blocking with a CD16/32 antibody (BD Biosciences), cell surface staining was performed with anti-CD45-APC (30-F11, BD Biosciences) and anti-CD11b-PerCP-Cy5.5 antibodies. In some experiments, cells were fixed and permeabilized with the BD Cytofix/Cytoperm Fixation/Permeabilization Kit (BD Biosciences) and then stained with CD68-R-PE (FA-11, AbD Serotec, Oxford, UK) or rabbit anti-Iba1 (Wako) conjugated to R-PE using the Zenon Rabbit IgG Labeling Kit (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). Isotype and fluorescence minus one controls were used to determine nonspecific staining. Flow cytometry data were collected on a BD FACScan flow cytometer retrofitted with a second laser (Cytek, Fremont, CA) using CellQuest (BD Biosciences) and Rainbow software (Cytek) in the High Speed Cell Sorter Core Facility at the Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University, and the data were subsequently analyzed using FlowJo (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR). Viable cells were gated by FSC and SSC characteristics, and the appropriate controls were used for compensation and to determine negatively and positively stained populations, as previously described ( 28 ). Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR Real-time PCR (quantitative PCR) was performed using SYBR Green detection according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was extracted from   and WT optic nerve using Trizol. cDNA was synthesized from total RNA samples using the Ominiscript kit (Qiagen, Alameda, CA). Amplification was performed in 96 well plates in a real-time sequence detection system instrument (Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time System, Hercules, CA). Primer sequences for  Nf1 +/-  were 5′-AGGCCTGTTATTTGGGCGACAT-3′ (forward) and 5′AGCGAGGACCACCAACAGATTT-3′ (reverse). Primer sequences for  Cx3cr1  were 5′-AAATGGGTCCAAGACGCCATGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACATTGTCCACCCGCTTCTCAA-3′ (reverse). Bio-Rad CFX Manager software was used to convert the fluorescent data into cycle threshold (CT) measurements. The ΔΔCT method was used to calculate changes in fold expression relative to WT optic nerve using β-actin as an internal control. Cx3cl1 Statistical analyses Student   tests, along with Grubbs' test to determine outliers, were performed for all statistical analyses. Mean and SEM were used for all graphs. For all experiments involving cell quantitation, the investigators were blinded to mouse genotype and treatment. t",Grant W Simmons; Winnie W Pong; Ryan J Emnett; Crystal R White; Scott M Gianino; Fausto J Rodriguez; David H Gutmann,Journal of neuropathology and experimental neurology,2011-01,10.1097/NEN.0b013e3182032d37,minimal,True

Selection of NF1 Ontologies The complete list of NF1 gene ontologies (GO) and phenotype ontologies were obtained in the AmiGO and Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) databases, respectively. In modifier studies, the selection of which phenotypes to study is a key step, and in NF1, several phenotypic features are time-dependent [ 19 ]. Then, we selected from both lists (GO and HPO) the ontologies related to the less frequent and variable characteristics and not necessarily time-dependent, presented by NF1 patients, as reported in the literature and in our clinical experience in the Oncogenetics clinics of Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre [ 16 , 78 , 79 ]. For example, cutaneous neurofibromas are common and may occur in up to 99% of NF1 patients in a cohort; this is a variable characteristic, mainly in the number of neurofibromas, but it is less variable when considering their presence in NF1 patients. Thus, we focused on ontologies related to characteristics that occur in a smaller number of patients to try to explain the variability of less common but more aggressive NF1 symptoms, such as breast cancer, delayed mental development, plexiform neurofibromas, and facial dysmorphism. The processes and phenotypes selected for the analysis involved NF1 and NF1-related signaling pathways, such as the MAPK cascade and regulation of the Ras pathway, considering the upper ontology in the hierarchy of each database. Hence, some ontologies were not selected because there was an upper term in the hierarchy that encompassed these ontologies. It is worth mentioning that we followed a guide for the correct selection of ontologies to try to limit the bias introduced by the choice of terms and keywords [ 80 ]. The processes were evaluated by two independent researchers and selected for subsequent analysis when both researchers considered it relevant.  4.2. Systems Biology Analysis Networks were generated using STRING database v.11, comprising protein–protein interactions (PPI) for  Homo sapiens . Only experimental interactions were selected, with a minimum required interaction score set in 0.400 (default). The assembled networks were transferred to Cytoscape v.3.7.2 software, with which the network statistics was obtained. Big nodes represented proteins with high betweenness centrality scores and warm colors comprised proteins with high closeness centrality measures. Comparison between networks was performed with DyNet application for Cytoscape v.3.7.2. Complex networks comprising HPO selected phenotypes, gene expression, and PPI networks were assembled using the PhenomeScape app, also in Cytoscape v.3.7.2, using the default settings. 4.3. Gene Expression Evaluation RNA-seq and microarray secondary analysis were performed using studies selected in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases. For the GEO studies, we looked for  NF1  knockdown or knockout assays and selected only the ones performed in human tumor cells. The data extraction was performed manually, and the robust multiarray averaging (RMA) normalization was applied using  oligo  or  affy  R packages (R v.3.6.2). The differentially expressed genes were obtained using the  limma  package (R v.3.6.2).  Firstly, for TCGA, we selected seven somatic tumors with nonsense mutations in  NF1  ( NF1 -ns): bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), brain lower grade glioma (LGG), breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC), colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), and pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PCPG). Despite tumors having a somatic origin, this information can be useful to check how alterations in  NF1  could affect the global gene expression in a specific tissue/tumor (phenotype). We then compared these samples against wild type  NF1  tumors to check which genes were differentially expressed only in the  NF1 -ns group. The gene expression analysis for TCGA data was performed by extracting the data with  TCGAbiolinks  package and evaluating differential gene expression with  edgeR  package. All analyses were performed in R v.3.6.2. 4.4. Random Walk Analysis The heterogeneous networks comprising both the genes and phenotypes selected were assembled in the  RandomWalkRestartMH  package, in R v.3.6.2, and the random walk analysis was performed with the same package. 4.5. Database Research  Other databases consulted to obtain data for the potential NF1 phenotype-modifier genes were: (1) BioGrid, for curated protein interactions; (2) PINOT tool, for literature data on curated protein interactions; (3) STRING database, for protein–protein interactions; and (4) The Human Reference Protein Interactome (HuRI), for the binary protein–protein interactions. 4.6. Variant Datasets To explore variants in our candidate genes already reported in the general population or with clinical significance, we consulted The Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) v 2.1.1 and the ClinVar archive. For gnomAD, variants were classified according to its annotation. In ClinVar, only variants reported by at least one submitter as a germline were considered and classified according to their interpretations. Finally, an additional analysis was performed consulting the 79,720 tumor samples made available by the AACR Project GENIE and the 10,967 samples from the TCGA PanCancer Atlas studies, using the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics. Samples were filtered according to their mutational status:  NF1 -mutated patients including only nonsense, frameshift, and splicing; and patients with selected variants in our candidate genes, if available. Then, the clinical data were accessed and confronted with the mutational status to check which cancer types were predominant when  NF1  was exclusively altered and when  NF1  variant co-occurred with variants in our candidate genes.",Thayne Woycinck Kowalski; Larissa Brussa Reis; Tiago Finger Andreis; Patricia Ashton-Prolla; Clévia Rosset,Cancers,2020-08-26,10.3390/cancers12092416,minimal,True
PMID:19430883,Suggested response criteria for phase II antitumor drug studies for neurofibromatosis type 2 related vestibular schwannoma.,"Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a tumor suppressor gene syndrome characterized by multiple schwannomas, especially vestibular schwannomas (VS), and meningiomas. Anticancer drug trials are now being explored, but there are no standardized endpoints in NF2. We review the challenges of NF2 clinical trials and suggest possible response criteria for use in initial phase II studies. We suggest two main response criteria in such trials. Objective radiographic response is defined as a durable 20% or greater reduction in VS volume based on post-contrast T1-weighted MRI images collected with 3 mm or finer cuts through the internal auditory canal. Hearing response is defined as a statistically significant improvement in word recognition scores using 50-word recorded lists in audiology. A possible composite endpoint incorporating both radiographic response and hearing response is outlined. We emphasize pitfalls in response assessment and suggest guidelines to minimize misinterpretations of response. We also identify research goals in NF2 to facilitate future trial conduct, such as identifying the expectations for time to tumor progression and time to measurable hearing loss in untreated NF2-related VS, and the relation of both endpoints to patient prognostic factors (such as age, baseline tumor volume, and measures of disease severity). These data would facilitate future use of endpoints based on stability of tumor size and hearing, which might be more appropriate for testing certain drugs. We encourage adoption of standardized endpoints early in the development of phase II trials for this population to facilitate comparison of results across trials of different agents.","Methods of measuring tumor size Tumor response has historically been measured in relation to linear dimension, as in the 2000 RECIST criteria [ 82 ]; bidimensional area, as in the 1979 WHO criteria [ 83 ], and the 1990 “Macdonald” criteria for malignant glioma, which also incorporated steroid dose and neurological condition [ 84 ]; and volumetric measures based on crosssectional imaging such as CT or MRI [ 51 ,  85 ]. For sporadic VS, measures based on greatest linear dimension are typically used in clinical practice to assess growth over time [ 54 ,  57 ] and operative risk of complications [ 58 ]. In following VS for growth in a “wait and scan” strategy, 2 mm of growth is commonly chosen as the threshold before recommending treatment [ 86 ,  87 ], or less often 1 mm [ 88 ]. Either the greatest tumor diameter measured parallel to the petrous face or simply the greatest tumor dimension (potentially including the intracanalicular portion), both on axial images, are common assessment methods [ 60 ,  89 ]. An average tumor diameter calculated as the square root of the product of the greatest dimension parallel to the petrous ridge and the greatest perpendicular diameter on axial images has been recommended as a standard measure of VS size [ 90 ]. While such measures may adequately summarize tumor size in sporadic VS, which typically have a regular, ovoid shape in their extracanalicular portion, NF2-related VS are often highly irregular in form (particularly after prior treatment) ( Fig. 2 ), and such measures are likely to be inaccurate surrogates for true NF2 VS volumes. A comparative study showed that volumetric measures were much more sensitive to tumor growth (and, presumably, to tumor shrinkage) than linear measures [ 89 ], and volume estimates based on bidimensional area have been shown to be a poor surrogate for actual tumor volumes [ 91 ]. For volumetric measure of a VS, a simple method is the “box model” in which the greatest anteroposterior, mediolateral, and superoinferior measures are multiplied [ 52 ,  59 ], or a two-box modification that measures intracanalicular and extracanalicular volumes separately [ 62 ]. Two limitations of the box method are the considerable interobserver variation in measuring the three tumor dimensions used in this method [ 87 ,  92 ] and the irregular shape of most NF2 VS, in contrast to the regular shape of sporadic VS. A method that uses summed areas from individual crosssectional imaging slices (typically axial slices) has been shown to yield accurate volumetric measurements, within 10% of true volumes when five or more axial slices through the target volume are used [ 93 ]. A study of volumetric measurement of NF2 VS using these methods, using 3 mm axial slices, showed an intrarater coefficient of variation of measurements of 5% or less for tumors larger than 1 cm3 [ 89 ]. 1 mm isotropic voxels are now routinely feasible on many MRI systems, and the smaller the voxel size, the smaller the VS size and change that can be accurately detected. We recommend volumetric measurement of VS volume as the means of assessing objective tumor response in NF2 VS trials. Specification of methods of measurement The same techniques should be used to characterize VS at baseline and during follow-up. To declare a tumor response, patients should be on stable or decreasing corticosteroid doses compared to baseline. Radiographic response is determined by quantitative volumetric tumor analysis of contrast-enhanced MRI scans [ 89 ]. MRI scans should include pre- and post-contrast images of the brain including thin spin-echo or gradientecho T1-weighted axial images through the internal auditory canal (slice 1.5 mm or thinner, skip 0 mm). Fatsuppression techniques should be used for post-contrast studies if there is a prior history of surgery in the internal auditory canal to avoid confusing fat grafts in the internal auditory canal for enhancing tumor [ 140 ]. Similarly, true fluid cysts within a VS or arachnoid cysts abutting a VS should be excluded from volume measurement. Tumor volumetry will typically be performed centrally in multicenter trials, and should be performed using post-contrast images through the internal auditory canal with the Vitrea2 (Vital Images, Minnetonka, MN) semi-automated segmentation software (or comparable software), edited manually as needed by the reviewer. The coefficient of variation for VS greater than 1 cc using this technique is generally below 5% [ 89 ], so we suggest that 5% would be a reasonable lower bound for definition of minor response. Although drugs tested to date do not affect VS enhancement, T2 images should also be examined to confirm that apparent volume reduction represents a true change in tumor size (as apparent from T2 visualization of tumor borders) rather than a change in intrinsic enhancement of VS tissue. We anticipate that most NF2 phase II trials will define an “index” lesion to be used for response assessment, such as the VS on the side of an only hearing ear. (The definition of an index lesion may vary for trials that focus on other NF2 histologies such as meningiomas or ependymomas, or for patients with bilateral VS and no hearing in either ear.) In patients with bilateral VS the index VS should be selected before trial enrollment. Some NF2 patients have seemingly innumerable meningiomas and schwannomas; we propose that up to five lesions other than the index VS that can each be accurately measured by MRI scan should be identified as non-target lesions. Non-target lesions for NF2 patients should be defined by the study radiologist at baseline as contralateral VS, non-VS, and meningiomas. The volume of the contralateral VS and individual volumes for all non-VS and meningiomas (or, alternatively, total non-target schwannoma and total meningioma volumes) should be recorded at baseline. The change in volume of non-target lesions will not be used for response criteria but can be used and reported as secondary endpoints, if desired. Definitions and methods of measurement Hearing in phase II studies will be measured by standard audiologic techniques including determination of word recognition scores and pure-tone averages ipsilateral to the target vestibular schwannoma. Word recognition is measured using 50-item CID-W22 (Central Institute for the Deaf; Ira Hirsh recording) monosyllable wordlists and ranges from 0% to 100% [ 141 ]. Other standardized monosyllable recorded lists may be used including NU#6 [ 142 ], CNC [ 143 ] and others as long as similar performance-to-intensity functions can be shown for the recording used. Because word lists can differ in difficulty, the word list used for an individual in a trial should be noted and kept consistent for all testing throughout the protocol treatment. The principle of using equivalent performance functions may also be applied to word lists in other languages, such as bisyllabic Spanish words [ 144 ]. When the tester is an English speaker, we recommend using a trial entry criterion of “testable in English” (rather than “English as a first language”) which promotes inclusion without reducing validity [ 145 ]. In all cases, live voice presentation and truncated (e.g., 25-word) lists are not acceptable. Pure-tone thresholds are most often measured at the frequencies of 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000 and 8000 Hz. The pure-tone average is calculated as the average of thresholds at 500, 1000, 2000 and 3000 Hz as recommended by the American Academy of Otolaryngology (AAO) [ 146 ]. In cases of VS, the hearing loss is sensorineural. However, an unrelated, additional conductive loss may also be present which would further elevate the air conduction thresholds. While air conduction thresholds (with masking as necessary) are most often the best data, in cases with additional conductive loss, the masked bone conduction results are a better measure of the sensorineural hearing loss. It is recommended that masked bone conduction results be used when air-bone gaps larger than 10 dB are found at more than one frequency. When forming a PTA, it is sometimes necessary to include data where the upper limits of the audiometer is reached and the patient has not responded. This should not be treated as missing data. Our recommended approach is to extrapolate conservatively by adding one audiometric step (5 dB) to the upper limit value, thereby capturing the large magnitude of the loss at that frequency [ 145 ].",Scott R Plotkin; Chris Halpin; Jaishri O Blakeley; William H Slattery; D Bradley Welling; Susan M Chang; Jay S Loeffler; Gordon J Harris; A Gregory Sorensen; Michael J McKenna; Fred G Barker,Journal of neuro-oncology,2009-05,10.1007/s11060-009-9867-7,minimal,True
PMID:18984165,Neurofibromin regulation of ERK signaling modulates GABA release and learning.,"We uncovered a role for ERK signaling in GABA release, long-term potentiation (LTP), and learning, and show that disruption of this mechanism accounts for the learning deficits in a mouse model for learning disabilities in neurofibromatosis type I (NF1). Our results demonstrate that neurofibromin modulates ERK/synapsin I-dependent GABA release, which in turn modulates hippocampal LTP and learning. An Nf1 heterozygous null mutation, which results in enhanced ERK and synapsin I phosphorylation, increased GABA release in the hippocampus, and this was reversed by pharmacological downregulation of ERK signaling. Importantly, the learning deficits associated with the Nf1 mutation were rescued by a subthreshold dose of a GABA(A) antagonist. Accordingly, Cre deletions of Nf1 showed that only those deletions involving inhibitory neurons caused hippocampal inhibition, LTP, and learning abnormalities. Importantly, our results also revealed lasting increases in GABA release triggered by learning, indicating that the mechanisms uncovered here are of general importance for learning.","Methods Mouse breeding and genotyping All animal protocols were approved by the Chancellor’s Animal Research Committee of UCLA, and in accordance with the NIH guidelines. In this paper, we used 3–6 month old males and females. Studies with  Nf1 +/−  mice were performed in 129T2/SvEmsJ-C57BL/6 F1 hybrids generated. WT littermates were used as controls. The mice with Cre-mediated deletions of the  Nf1  gene ( Nf1 ;  Dlx5/6+/− Nf1   syn I+/− Nf1 ;  CamkII +/− Nf1 ) were F1 progeny from a cross between the  GFAP+/− Nf1  and the cell-type specific Cre mice ( floxed/+ synapsin 1-Cre, GFAP-Cre, αCaMKII-Cre , and  Dlx5/6-Cre . The four lines with Cre-deletions of the  Nf1  gene (and their controls)were all in 129T2/SvEmsJ-C57BL/6 F1 hybrid genetic background. Since the 4 different  Nf1  lines share the same genetic background (all in 129T2/SvEmsJ-C57BL/6 F1 hybrids background), in some experiments we combined WT and  Cre+/− Nf1  littermates of different conditional mutant lines. The  floxed/+ Nf1  mice were F2 progeny of the  Cre−/− Nf1  mice. Mice genotype were determined by PCR analysis of tail DNA samples as described before. All experiments were carried out with researchers blind to the genotype of the animals tested. Cre+/− Western Blot Analysis Immunoblot analyses were performed as described previously (( Elgersma et al., 2002 ). In  Figure 4  and  Figure 6S , tissue was collected 30 min after behavioral training. The primary antibodies used were against NF1 (1:300; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); phospho-ERK p42/p44 and total ERK p42/p44 (1:1,000; NEB); β-actin (1:5,000; Sigma); synapsin I (1:1000; NEB); phospho-synapsin I is a gift from P. Greengard (Rockefeller University, New York, NY). Blots were quantitated using ECL +  and the Storm 860 phosphorimager system (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Immunohistochemistry Immunohistochemistry was performed using confocal microscopy as described previously ( Kushner, et al. 2005 ). The primary antibodies used were against phospho-Thr202/Tyr204 ERK p42/p44 (New England Biolabs), GAD65/67 (Chemicon). FITC donkey anti-rabbit, cyanine 3 (Cy3) donkey anti-mouse were used as secondary antibodies. Sections were analyzed with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser-scanning microscope using a 40× numerical aperture objective. Neuronal quantification was performed by counting cellular FITC fluorescence and cellular Cy3 immunofluorescence. Behavioral analysis The Morris water maze apparatus and procedures were previously described( Costa et al., 2002 ). Mice were trained with two trials per day for 7 d (30 sec ITI). Probe trials were administered after 5 and 7 d after the completion of training. For the studies that looked at inhibition after water maze training, Mice were initially habituated for 7 days (2 mins handling and 5 mins swimming/day). Mice in the “ Learning group ” were spatial trained with 15 trials (5 min ITI). In each trial, mice were given 30 sec on a platform and another 60 sec to find the platform ( Figure. S9 ). Two mice were excluded from further analysis because of floating. Mice in the “ Swimming-only group ” spent on average the same time as the “ Learning group ” in the pool, but no platform was present. To avoid fatigue, training was divided into 5 sessions (4 min each) with 15 min ITI. Mice in the “ Cage-control group ” were sacrificed immediately after removal from the home cage. Mice from both the “ Learning ” and “ Swimming-only ” groups were sacrificed 60 min after the last session, and mIPSCs (see below) were recorded. In the visible version of water maze, mice were trained to search for a marked platform that were placed at a different location for 5 trials during 1 day (30 min ITI). The contextual fear conditioning apparatus was previously described( Anagnostaras et al., 2000 ). To avoid ceiling performances, mice were placed in a conditioning chamber for 40 sec after which they were given a foot-shock (0.40 mA, 2 sec). Mice were trained with one trial/day for 5 consecutive days. At each training day and 24 hours after the last training trial, the freezing levels were monitored for 30 seconds. All values are reported as mean±SEM. A two-way ANOVA with repeated measures was used to analyze the acquisition data from the water maze and freezing levels in the fear conditioning. A single-factor ANOVA was used to analyze the performance in the water maze probe on the percentage time in quadrant. A paired t-test were used to analyze the proximity data and crossing time. Electrophysiology Transverse hippocampal slices (400 µm thick) were maintained in a submerged recording chamber perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at 30°C. The ACSF contained the following (in mM): 120 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2.5 CaCl2, 1.3 MgSO4, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, and 10 D-glucose. Field EPSPs (fEPSPs) were recorded with a metallic electrode in CA1 stratum radiatum. The Schaffer collaterals were stimulated with 100-sec test pulses via a bipolar electrode. The intensity of stimulation was fixed at 60 mA. LTP was induced by a 5-theta-burst tetanus stimulation protocol (each burst consists of four pulses at 100 Hz with a 200-msec interburst interval). Responses from the last 10-min block of recordings were compared using ANOVA was used with Fisher’s PLSD for post hoc comparisons. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings(reference mody)( Hajos et al., 2000 ) using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) or a 3900A Integrating Patch Clamp Amplifier (Dagan, Minneapolis, MN) were performed to measure sIPSCs, mIPSCs and mEPSCs. All recordings were made from the soma of visually identified CA1 pyramidal neurons. Patch electrodes (3–8 M when filled) were filled with a solution containing (in mM): 140 CsCl, 4 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 Hepes, 0.05 EGTA, 2 Mg-ATP, and 0.4 Mg-GTP. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were performed at -60-70 mV. Series resistance was compensated to 75–80%. Only recordings during which series resistance changed less than 25% through the whole experiment were analyzed. All recordings were low-pass filtered at 2 kHz and on-line digitized at 10 kHz using a PCI-MIO 16E-4 data acquisition board (National Instruments, Austin, TX). sIPSCs, mIPSCs and mEPSCs were measured using an in-house data acquisition and analysis software( Hajos et al., 2000 ). Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical comparisons of mEPSC data were performed using paired and unpaired t tests and ANOVA.",Yijun Cui; Rui M Costa; Geoffrey G Murphy; Ype Elgersma; Yuan Zhu; David H Gutmann; Luis F Parada; Istvan Mody; Alcino J Silva,Cell,2008-10-31,10.1016/j.cell.2008.09.060,minimal,True
PMID:25877069,Establishment of immortalized murine mesothelial cells and a novel mesothelioma cell line.,"Mesothelial cells are susceptible to asbestos fiber-induced cytotoxicity and on longer time scales to transformation; the resulting mesothelioma is a highly aggressive neoplasm that is considered as incurable at the present time Zucali et al. (Cancer Treatment Reviews 37:543-558, 2011). Only few murine cell culture models of immortalized mesothelial cells and mesothelioma cell lines exist to date. We generated SV40-immortalized cell lines derived from wild-type (WT) and neurofibromatosis 2 (merlin) heterozygote (Nf2+/-) mice, both on a commonly used genetic background, C57Bl/6J. All immortalized mesothelial clones consistently grow in DMEM supplemented with fetal bovine serum. Cells can be passaged for more than 40 times without any signs of morphological changes or a decrease in proliferation rate. The tumor suppressor gene NF2 is one of the most frequently mutated genes in human mesothelioma, but its detailed function is still unknown. Thus, these genotypically distinct cell lines likely relevant for malignant mesothelioma formation are expected to serve as useful in vitro models, in particular to compare with in vivo studies in mice of the same genotype. Furthermore, we generated a novel murine mesothelioma cell line RN5 originating from an Nf2+/- mouse subjected to repeated crocidolite exposure. RN5 cells are highly tumorigenic.","Materials and Methods Isolation of mouse primary mesothelial cells and mesothelioma cells from a NF2+/− mouse. Mesothelial cells were isolated from 4 to 6 months old WT and Nf2+/− mice, all on a C57Bl/6J background using a previously described protocol (Bot  et al. 
 2003 ). Briefly, mice were killed and the peritoneal cavities were exposed by incision and removal of the fur. The peritoneal cavities were washed with injecting approximately 50 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Sigma, St. Louis) via a syringe equipped with a 25G × 5/8″ needle (BD microlance 3, Becton Dickinson AG, Allschwil, Switzerland) using a peristaltic pump and a second needle (23G, 0.6 × 25 mm) to allow exit of the PBS solution. Perfusion was maintained until the exiting PBS solution was clear, i.e., devoid of mobile and poorly attached cells. Residual PBS was aspired with a syringe, and the peritoneal cavity was filled with 5 ml of 0.25% Trypsin/EDTA solution (Gibco, Basel, Switzerland). The body temperature of mouse corpses was maintained at around 37°C for 5 min via an infrared heating lamp. The suspension containing the detached cells was collected with a syringe; cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 300× g . Cells mostly comprising primary mesothelial cells were grown in modified Connell’s medium composed of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)/F12 + GlutaMax (Gibco), 15% fetal calf serum (FCS), 0.4 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 1% ITS (insulin, transferrin, selenium), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, 1% non-essential amino acids, 1% penicillin–streptomycin, and 2% Mycokill (PAA) (Connell and Rheinwald  1983 ). The  Nf2  alleles (WT or mutated) were genotyped using the common forward primer (NF2_FW 5′-GGGGCTTCGGGAAACCTG G-3′), and either NF2_RV WT (5′-GTCTGGGAAGTCTGTGGAGG-3) or NF2_RV mutant (5′-CTATCAGGACATAGCGTTGG-3′) primers. The cell line RN5 was isolated from an Nf2+/− mouse that was repeatedly injected with crocidolite starting at 8 wk of age (7 × 400 μg). Briefly, a clearly discernible tumor localized on the liver was dissected from the mouse 21 wk after the first injection. The tissue was incubated in a 0.25% Trypsin/EDTA solution for 10 min; tumor cells were dissociated by mild trituration and cultured in DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, Basel, Switzerland), and 1% PS (100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin). Cell culture and growth curves. Primary mesothelial cells from the two genotypes (WT and Nf2+/−) were immortalized by transduction with SV40 small and large T antigen. Transduction was performed using lentivirus that were produced as previously described (Blum and Schwaller  2013 ). The transfer plasmid pCMV/TO SV40 was obtained from Addgene (# 22298). Primary cells were seeded at a density of 10,000 cells/cm 2 ; 24 h post-seeding cells were transfected with lentivirus at an MOI of 5. Proliferation was monitored using the Incucyte Live Cell Imaging System (Essen Bioscience, Michigan). After passaging, cells were seeded at a very low density (1–2 cells/cm 2 ) in 10-cm Petri dishes. Individual and well-delimited clones were picked and transferred into 96-well plates and frozen at passages 7–10 following standard protocols. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was performed as previously described (Blum and Schwaller  2013 ). Western blot assay for mesothelin, SV40 large T-antigen, and β-actin. Cells were grown in 75-cm 2  cell culture flasks (TPP, Trasadingen, Switzerland) until they reached nearly 100% confluence. Subsequently, cells were trypsinized and pelleted (500× g , 3 min), then washed three times with CMF-PBS. Proteins were extracted with RIPA buffer [50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4], incubated for 30 min on ice, and centrifuged 30 min at 17,000× g  at 4°C, and the supernatant was collected. The DC assay (BioRad) was performed to quantify the proteins following the manufacturer’s protocol. Protein samples were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide SDS gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were checked with Ponceau S staining for equal loading. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk PBS for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4°C with antibodies recognizing mesothelin (dilution 1:2,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, clone B-3), SV40 large T-antigen (1:2000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Pab101), and β-actin (1:20,000; Sigma-Aldrich, clone ac-74). Secondary biotinylated antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:20,000, and the ABC system (Vectastain, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was applied. The HRP substrate (Millipore, Luminata Forte) was incubated for 3 min on the membrane and analyzed on a Western blot reader (FluorChem E System, Bucher Biotec, Basel, Switzerland). Soft agar assay. The procedure of the soft agar assay was adapted from a previously described protocol (Provost  et al. 
 2012 ). Shortly, 0.5% of base agar was prepared by melting 1% of agar (LuBioScience, Lucerne, Switzerland) in a microwave oven and adding of prewarmed (40°C) 2× RPMI completed with 20% FCS and antibiotics (penicillin-streptomycin) and allowed to equilibrate to 37°C. Equal volumes of the solutions were mixed to give final concentrations of 0.5% agar, 1× RPMI, and 10% FCS. One milliliter was added per well in six-well plates and set aside to solidify. Top agar was prepared by melting 0.7% agarose (PeqLab, Erlangen, Germany) in a microwave oven and cooled down to 40°C and then supplemented with an equal volume of 2× RPMI with 20% FCS also at approximately 40°C. Cells (5000) in a volume of 1 ml of 0.35% agarose in 1× RPMI + 10% FCS was added to the solidified agar. Plates were incubated for 17 d in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO 2 . Twice per week, the plates were supplied with 0.5 ml of cell culture medium. Subcutaneous xenograft model. WT C57Bl/6J mice (6–8 wk old;  n  = 3–5 animals depending on the group) were inoculated s.c. with 4 × 10 5  cells by injection of the cell suspension (50 μl in PBS containing 20% matrigel) into the right dorsal flank. Cells included immortalized mesothelial cells (iMeso-WT1 and iMeso-NF3), the MM cell line RN5, and the previously described murine MM cell line AK7 (Cordier Kellerman  et al. 
 2003 ), the latter also on a C57Bl/6J background. Tumors were measured with a caliper weekly as soon as palpable; the volume was calculated using the formula  a  ×  b 
 2  × 0.5, where  a  is the large and  b  the small diameter of an ellipse. For the immunohistochemistry, deparaffinized sections were subjected to antigen retrieval using sodium citrate, pH 6, then were processed as previously described (Frei  et al. 
 2011 ). Primary antibodies used were anti-wide spectrum cytokeratin and anti-vimentin (Abcam Ab9377, 1:100 and Ab92547, 1:500, respectively). Immunofluorescence experiments. Cells were seeded on glass coverslips and incubated with the appropriate cell culture medium until a confluence of 70–90% was reached. Then, the cells were fixed with 4% PFA, permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100, and blocked with TBS solution containing donkey serum (10%). Cells were incubated overnight at 4°C with the primary antibodies at the indicated dilutions: mouse monoclonal anti-pan-cytokeratin, clone Lu-5 (BMA Biomedicals, Augst, Switzerland, T-1302; 1:500), or rabbit polyclonal anti-desmin (Sigma D8281; 1:500). After washing, the cell-containing coverslips were incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h with either DyLight488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA; 1:1,000) or Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories; 1:1,000). The cells were counterstained with DAPI (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR; 5 μg/ml) and mounted with Hydromount solution (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA). Images were acquired with a LEICA fluorescent microscope DM6000B (Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a Hamamatsu camera C4742-95 (Bridgewater, NJ).",Walter Blum; László Pecze; Emanuela Felley-Bosco; Janine Worthmüller-Rodriguez; Licun Wu; Bart Vrugt; Marc de Perrot; Beat Schwaller,In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

PMID:33574490,Using antisense oligonucleotides for the physiological modulation of the alternative splicing of NF1 exon 23a during PC12 neuronal differentiation.,"Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a genetic condition affecting approximately 1:3500 persons worldwide. The NF1 gene codes for neurofibromin protein, a GTPase activating protein (GAP) and a negative regulator of RAS. The NF1 gene undergoes alternative splicing of exon 23a (E23a) that codes for 21 amino acids placed at the center of the GAP related domain (GRD). E23a-containing type II neurofibromin exhibits a weaker Ras-GAP activity compared to E23a-less type I isoform. Exon E23a has been related with the cognitive impairment present in NF1 individuals. We designed antisense Phosphorodiamidate Morpholino Oligomers (PMOs) to modulate E23a alternative splicing at physiological conditions of gene expression and tested their impact during PC12 cell line neuronal differentiation. Results show that any dynamic modification of the natural ratio between type I and type II isoforms disturbed neuronal differentiation, altering the proper formation of neurites and deregulating both the MAPK/ERK and cAMP/PKA signaling pathways. Our results suggest an opposite regulation of these pathways by neurofibromin and the possible existence of a feedback loop sensing neurofibromin-related signaling. The present work illustrates the utility of PMOs to study alternative splicing that could be applied to other alternatively spliced genes in vitro and in vivo.","Materials and methods Cell culture PC12 cells (ATCC CRL-1721) were grown on Collagen IV-coated dishes (25 μg/ml) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (complete RPMI medium) at 37ºC in 5% of CO 2 . For the NGF treatment, PC12 were plated on Collagen IV-coated dishes in complete medium for 24 h and then switched to RPMI with 1% fetal bovine serum and 50 ng/ml NGF (Promega). H19-7/ IGF-IR (ATCC CRL-2526) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 200 mg/ml of G418 (Calbiochem) and 1 mg/ml of puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich) at 33ºC in 5% CO 2 . For differentiation experiments, H19-7/IGF-IR cells were grown to confluence and then cells were washed extensively and shifted to the non-permissive temperature of 39ºC with 5% of CO 2  in DMEM medium supplemented with 1X N2 (Calbiochem) and 10 ng/mL bFGF (Invitrogen). Primary Schwann cells previously isolated from an NF1 patient nerve biopsy, were thawed and cultured on Poly-L-Lysine (0.1 mg/mL) and laminin (4 µg/mL) coated plates in Schwann Cell Media (SCM) + forskolin, and incubated at 37 °C and 10% CO 2  for 24 h as described previously . Then medium was replaced by SCM without forskolin for 2 days. For proliferative conditions, cells were cultured in SCM + forskolin for 1 day and replaced with SCM for 2–3 days, repeating this process in cycles. For differentiation conditions, cells were cultured with SCM + forskolin constantly for 5 days. 69 RNA extraction, quantification and reverse transcription (RT) Total RNA was extracted using Tripure Isolation Reagent (Roche). Quality and quantity were assessed using NanoDrop spectrophotometer and gel electrophoresis analysis. For an accurate quantification, size and integrity of the RNA was determined with Bioanalyzer (RNA Nano Assay: 25–500 ng/µl), according to manufacturer instructions. Reverse transcription of 1-3 μg of RNA was performed with SuperScript II First-Strand Synthesis System (ThermoFisher Scientific) with random hexamers (Life Technologies, SA) following manufacturer’s instructions. E23a alternative splicing analysis and  Nf1  expression levels For the quantification of E23a alternative splicing (Figs.  2 D and  3 D) and  Nf1  expression levels (Figs.  2 E and  3 E) RT-qPCR analysis was performed. Primers used are summarized in Supplementary Table  S2 . In particular, primers were designed to specifically detect exon 23a skipping (exon 23–2/24 boundary) and inclusion (exon 23–2/23a boundary). In addition, a pair of primers was used to detect the expression of constitutive exon 3, to assess global  Nf1  expression. Expression levels were normalized using  Rpl29  and  Rpl19  reference genes . RT-qPCR was performed using SYBR Green I master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Reactions were run on Light Cycler 480 II Real Time PCR system (Roche). Conditions for amplification were as follows: 95 °C for 10 min; 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 59 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 20 s; and finally, a melting curve of 95 °C for 5 s and 65ºC for 1 min. 70 Monitorization of E23a alternative splicing status in all other experiments was performed by RT-PCR using 1 μl of cDNA and running PCR products on a 2% agarose gel. Primers (forward E23-2 and reverse E25, Supplementary Table  S2 ) and PCR conditions were based in the work of Metheny L et al. (1996)  in a 25 cycles reaction. Percent spliced-in (PSI) was calculated as the proportion of type II isoform versus total expression, using band intensities and according to this formula: (PSI) = Type II Isoform/(Type II + Type I isoforms). 28 PMO design and treatment conditions The 25-mer PMOs were designed, synthesized and purified by GeneTools (Philomath, OR, USA) (Supplementary Table  S1 ). PMOs designed to force the skipping of exons 14 (E14) and 23a (E23a) did not require any additional analysis. However, in order to identify the proper target sequences for the design of PMOs forcing the inclusion of E23a, a previous bioinformatic analysis was performed. A sequence comprising E23a and 160 bp of the intron sequence preceding it (hg38, chr17: 31252778–31253000) containing a high degree of homology across species was analyzed using the online tool SpliceAid 2  to determine RNA sequences predicted to be bound by splicing proteins in humans. The SpliceAid 2 database contains human splicing factors expression data and RNA target motifs information. The high level of conservation of intronic and exonic sequences across the E23a region opened the possibility that the molecular mechanisms and splicing regulation were conserved between human and rat (PC12 cells). Considering the predicted binding sites and previously published data 71 , we identified intronic sequences of 20–30 bp with potential regulatory properties for its inclusion and selected three of these regions, the conserved splicing regions (CSR) I, II and III, for the design of 25-mer complementary PMOs to sterically block the potential binding of the regulatory proteins. These PMOs were functionally tested in vitro. 11 , 12 Endo-Porter (GeneTools) was used to deliver PMOs into cells, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For the PMO treatment cells were seeded at 50% of confluence. The next day, culture medium was replaced with fresh medium containing the indicated concentrations of PMOs. Immediately after, Endo-Porter (6 mM) was added and mixed. For the detection of exon 14 skipping, PC12 cells were treated with 200 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) 4 h before RNA extraction to inhibit the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) mechanism. Three biological replicates were done for each condition to be studied. Differentiation assays and quantitative morphology Phase contrast images of living PC12 cells were acquired with a LEICA DMI 6000B inverted microscope. At least 10 independent fields per condition were acquired. Cells with at least one neurite with length equal or longer to the cell body diameter were considered differentiated. We calculated the number of differentiated and undifferentiated cells in each field to obtain the percentage of differentiated cells over total cells in the field. Neurite extension was measured by determining the length of at least 10–20 neurites per field using the ImageJ  (versions 1.45 s and 1.8.0_172;  72 https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html ) plugin NeuronJ . Neurite thickness was analyzed using ImageJ 73  (versions 1.45 s and 1.8.0_172;  72 https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html ) and measured at three different neurite locations from the cell body (distal, central and apical). The NADH-dehydrogenase activity assay was measured with a Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo), following the manufacturer’s instructions and measuring absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader (Spectra Max 34OPC, Molecular Devices). The absorbance values were normalized with the total number of cells per condition. Expression levels of neuronal markers  Gap43 ,  Mmp3  and  Dusp6  were analyzed by RT-qPCR using the same conditions as described above for  Nf1 , also normalized using  Rpl29  and  Rpl19  reference genes . 70 Immunofluorescence Cells were grown on plastic chamber slides, fixed in 4% Paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min and blocked for 15 min in 10% of Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) in PBS. Cells were incubated with α-tubulin (Invitrogen, 1:1000) and NGFR (Advance Targeting systems, 1:100) antibodies in 1% FBS in PBS and incubated 2 h at room temperature (RT). Secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) (Invitrogen) was used at 1:1000 in PBS (10% FBS) and incubated for 45 min at RT. Glass cover slips were mounted with VECTASHIELD mounting medium with DAPI H-1200 (Vector Laboratories). Images were taken with the confocal microscope Zeiss AxioObserver Z1. Cell death analysis The analysis of apoptotic cells was performed using Annexin-V-Alexa 568 antibody (Roche, Life technologies). In order to differentiate necrotic from positive apoptotic cells, Annexin-V staining was performed in combination with a DNA staining (bisbenzimide Hoechst 33258). The stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using BD LSRFortessa cell analyzer. Western blot Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 1.0% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0. Total protein was determined using the commercially available kit, Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific), following manufacturer’s instructions. For western blotting, the protein samples (20–30 μg) were separated by size on SDS–polyacrylamide gel, transferred into a PVDF membrane by electroblotting, blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk and subjected to immunoblotting with primary antibodies overnight at 4ºC. All antibodies used were diluted in 3% non-fat dry milk and include P-ERK 1/2 (Cell Signalling diluted 1:2000), ERK 1/2 (Millipore diluted 1:1000), P-PKA α/β (Invitrogen diluted 1ug/ml), PKA α/β (Termo Fisher Scientific diluted 1:500) NF1 c-terminal (Bethyl diluted 1:1000), NF1 n-terminal (Santa Cruz diluted 1:500) and α-Tubulin (Sigma Aldrich 1:1000). Blot was exposed to Horse Radish Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1 h) and detected with Pierce ECL western Blotting Substrate. Band density was quantified using ImageJ  (versions 1.45 s and 1.8.0_172;  72 https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html ). Statistical analysis All functional assays to assess the effect of PMOs were repeated at least three times. We calculated the mean ± SEM for each biological readout and applied Student’s t-test assuming equal variances. An event was considered significant with a  P  value < 0.05. The statistical analysis was performed using PASW Statistics (SPSS Inc. Released 2009. PASW Statistics for Windows, Version 18.0. Chicago: SPSS Inc.;  http://www.spss.com.hk/statistics/ ), while graphical representations were prepared using Prism (version 8.2.1 for MacOS X, GraphPad Software, San Diego, California USA;  https://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism/ ). RNA-seq Total RNA extraction was performed using Maxwell 16 LEV simplyRNA Purification Kit (Promega) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Libraries were prepared starting from 200 ng of RNA per sample with the TruSeq stranded mRNA Illumina procedure. Libraries were quantified using the KAPA library quantitation kit for Illumina GA and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform with 2 × 100 reads, 4 samples per lane. Sequencing data was quality trimmed with Trimmomatic v0.3 then processed with TopHat v 2.0.9, mapping with Bowtie2 against the  Rattus norvergicus  reference genome Rnor 6.0. The reads overlapping every known gene were counted and the counts matrix was processed in R. Every sample was normalized by the median of counts. A list of differentially expressed genes was generated per batch selecting those genes with a FC > 2 or FC < 0.5 and the final list was defined as the intersection of the per-batch lists. Heat map plots were generated with the gplots R package.",Josep Biayna; Helena Mazuelas; Bernat Gel; Ernest Terribas; Gabrijela Dumbovic; Inma Rosas; Juana Fernández-Rodriguez; Ignacio Blanco; Elisabeth Castellanos; Meritxell Carrió; Conxi Lazaro; Eduard Serra,Scientific reports,2021-02-11,10.1038/s41598-021-83152-w,minimal,True
PMID:24676424,Neurofibromatosis type 1 gene mutation analysis using sequence capture and high-throughput sequencing.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 syndrome (NF1) is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene. Availability of new sequencing technology prompted us to search for an alternative method for NF1 mutation analysis. Genomic DNA was isolated from saliva avoiding invasive sampling. The NF1 exons with an additional 50bp of flanking intronic sequences were captured and enriched using the SeqCap EZ Choice Library protocol. The captured DNA was sequenced with the Roche/454 GS Junior system. The mean coverages of the targeted regions were 41x and 74x in 2 separate sets of samples. An NF1 mutation was discovered in 10 out of 16 separate patient samples. Our study provides proof of principle that the sequence capture methodology combined with high-throughput sequencing is applicable to NF1 mutation analysis. Deep intronic mutations may however remain undetectable, and change at the DNA level may not predict the outcome at the mRNA or protein levels.",,Elina Uusitalo; Anna Hammais; Elina Palonen; Annika Brandt; Ville-Veikko Mäkelä; Roope Kallionpää; Eeva-Mari Jouhilahti; Minna Pöyhönen; Juhani Soini; Juha Peltonen; Sirkku Peltonen,Acta dermato-venereologica,2014-11,10.2340/00015555-1843,abstract_only,False
PMID:21697395,Discovery of a small molecule targeting IRA2 deletion in budding yeast and neurofibromin loss in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor cells.,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a life-threatening complication of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). NF1 is caused by mutation in the gene encoding neurofibromin, a negative regulator of Ras signaling. There are no effective pharmacologic therapies for MPNST. To identify new therapeutic approaches targeting this dangerous malignancy, we developed assays in NF1(+/+) and NF1(-/-) MPNST cell lines and in budding yeast lacking the NF1 homologue IRA2 (ira2Δ). Here, we describe UC1, a small molecule that targets NF1(-/-) cell lines and ira2Δ budding yeast. By using yeast genetics, we identified NAB3 as a high-copy suppressor of UC1 sensitivity. NAB3 encodes an RNA binding protein that associates with the C-terminal domain of RNA Pol II and plays a role in the termination of nonpolyadenylated RNA transcripts. Strains with deletion of IRA2 are sensitive to genetic inactivation of NAB3, suggesting an interaction between Ras signaling and Nab3-dependent transcript termination. This work identifies a lead compound and a possible target pathway for NF1-associated MPNST, and shows a novel model system approach to identify and validate target pathways for cancer cells in which NF1 loss drives tumor formation.","Materials and Methods Yeast strain generation and high-copy suppressor screening Strains and plasmids are listed in  Table 1 .  erg6Δ  and  erg6Δ ira2Δ  were generated using standard one-step PCR-based gene deletion methods ( 19 ,  20 ). Strains and plasmids used for high-copy suppressor screening are described in the  Supplemental Figure 2  legend. The YEp13- NAB3  plasmid was generated from a suppressing YEp13 plasmid containing genomic DNA of chromosome XVI from 183393 to 188100 by excising a NcoI-XbaI fragment and re-ligating the construct.  nab3Δ nab3-3  was obtained from Dr. M. Swanson, and  nab3–11  was a gift from Dr. J. Corden.  nab3-ts  alleles were confirmed by sequencing and introduced to the Σ1278b genetic background by backcrossing. The  ctk1Δ::KANMX  allele was backcrossed to the Σ1278b background from the Open Biosystems yeast deletion collection. Strains were backcrossed at least four times. High-throughput screening Screening was performed at the University of Cincinnati Drug Discovery Center using standard screening methodology. Full details of the screening protocol are included in the  Supplemental Materials and Methods . Tissue Culture STS26T and T265 cells were routinely maintained in DMEM high-glucose medium (Invitrogen 11965-092) with 10% FBS (Invitrogen 26140-079) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen 15070-063). The cell lines and their original sources have been described ( 21 ). Each has been certified mycoplasma-free and tested negative for a panel of mouse viruses. Their identity was validated by short tandem repeat (STR) genotyping. These cells had not previously been genotyped by this method, so there are no existing reference data. None of the genotypes match other cell lines in publicly accessible databases that have been queried. The cell lines are re-tested annually to ensure their ongoing identity. For drug sensitivity assays, 1000 cells were plated to 96-well plates in 100 μL medium. Plates were incubated for one day, then an additional 100 μL of medium containing 0.2% DMSO and twice the desired final concentration of UC1 was added to the wells (final 200 μL, 0.1% DMSO). Cells were incubated for three days, and viability was assessed by MTS assay. Three wells were analyzed for each condition, and the experiment was performed three times. Yeast drop assays UC1 was added to 5 mL 55° molten synthetic complete (SC) agar from DMSO working solutions, mixed, and poured to tissue culture plates (Falcon 35-3002). Plates were uncovered for 20 minutes in a fume hood. Plates were prepared immediately before use. Log phase cultures were diluted to OD 600  = 0.08, 10-fold serial dilutions were carried out in Eppendorf tubes, and 5 μL of each dilution was placed onto agar. Plates were incubated at 30° or at the indicated temperatures for three days. Yeast 96-well plate assays Log phase cultures were diluted to OD 600  = 0.05 in SC medium and 148.5 μL cell suspension was added to 96-well plates containing 1.5 μL DMSO or 1.5 μL 100X compound (1% DMSO final). Plates were gently agitated, then incubated for 18 hours at 30° in a humidified chamber. Optical densities were measured on a Molecular Devices Thermomax plate reader. Yeast RNA extraction and RT-PCR Triplicate log phase cultures were treated with DMSO or UC1 for 8 hours at 30° in 125 mL flasks. RNA was extracted from 5–10 × 10 6  cells with TriReagent (MRC TR-118) per manufacturers instruction. Full details of the extraction method are listed in  Supplementary Materials and Methods . RNA was treated with DNAse I (Roche 04716728001) according to manufacturers instructions. 200 ng of DNAse-I-treated RNA was used in a reverse transcription using Invitrogen SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen 18080-044) according to manufacturer’s instructions. 2 μL of the RT reaction was used in a traditional PCR, using primers described in ( 22 ). Cycling was performed with 94° denaturation, 50° annealing, and 72° extension for 0:45. For  PYK1  reactions, samples were removed after 22 cycles. For  SNR  readthrough reactions, samples were removed after 30 cycles.",Matthew Wood; Melissa Rawe; Gunnar Johansson; Shu Pang; Ryan S Soderquist; Ami V Patel; Sandra Nelson; William Seibel; Nancy Ratner; Yolanda Sanchez,Molecular cancer therapeutics,2011-09,10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-11-0309,minimal,True
PMID:24558021,Proteomic screening identifies a YAP-driven signaling network linked to tumor cell proliferation in human schwannomas.,"BACKGROUND: Inactivation of the NF2 gene predisposes to neurofibromatosis type II and the development of schwannomas. In vitro studies have shown that loss of NF2 leads to the induction of mitogenic signaling mediated by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), MAP kinase, AKT, or Hippo pathways. The goal of our study was to evaluate the expression and activity of these signaling pathways in human schwannomas in order to identify new potential therapeutic targets. METHODS: Large sets of human schwannomas, totaling 68 tumors, were analyzed using complementary proteomic approaches. RTK arrays identified the most frequently activated RTKs. The correlation between the expression and activity of signaling pathways and proliferation of tumor cells using Ki67 marker was investigated by reverse-phase protein array (RRPA). Finally, immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the expression pattern of signaling effectors in the tumors. RESULTS: We showed that Her2, Her3, PDGFRß, Axl, and Tie2 are frequently activated in the tumors. Furthermore, RRPA demonstrated that Ki67 levels are linked to YAP, p-Her3, and PDGFRß expression levels. In addition, Her2, Her3, and PDGFRß are transcriptional targets of Yes-associated protein (YAP) in schwannoma cells in culture. Finally, we observed that the expression of these signaling effectors is very variable between tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor cell proliferation in human schwannomas is linked to a signaling network controlled by the Hippo effector YAP. Her2, Her3, PDGFRß, Axl, and Tie2, as well as YAP, represent potentially valuable therapeutic targets. However, the variability of their expression between tumors may result in strong differences in the response to targeted therapy.",,Alizée Boin; Anne Couvelard; Christophe Couderc; Isabel Brito; Dan Filipescu; Michel Kalamarides; Pierre Bedossa; Leanne De Koning; Carine Danelsky; Thierry Dubois; Philippe Hupé; Daniel Louvard; Dominique Lallemand,Neuro-oncology,2014-09,10.1093/neuonc/nou020,abstract_only,False
PMID:26150484,In vitro modeling of hyperpigmentation associated to neurofibromatosis type 1 using melanocytes derived from human embryonic stem cells.,"""Café-au-lait"" macules (CALMs) and overall skin hyperpigmentation are early hallmarks of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). One of the most frequent monogenic diseases, NF1 has subsequently been characterized with numerous benign Schwann cell-derived tumors. It is well established that neurofibromin, the NF1 gene product, is an antioncogene that down-regulates the RAS oncogene. In contrast, the molecular mechanisms associated with alteration of skin pigmentation have remained elusive. We have reassessed this issue by differentiating human embryonic stem cells into melanocytes. In the present study, we demonstrate that NF1 melanocytes reproduce the hyperpigmentation phenotype in vitro, and further characterize the link between loss of heterozygosity and the typical CALMs that appear over the general hyperpigmentation. Molecular mechanisms associated with these pathological phenotypes correlate with an increased activity of cAMP-mediated PKA and ERK1/2 signaling pathways, leading to overexpression of the transcription factor MITF and of the melanogenic enzymes tyrosinase and dopachrome tautomerase, all major players in melanogenesis. Finally, the hyperpigmentation phenotype can be rescued using specific inhibitors of these signaling pathways. These results open avenues for deciphering the pathological mechanisms involved in pigmentation diseases, and provide a robust assay for the development of new strategies for treating these diseases.",,Jennifer Allouche; Nathalia Bellon; Manoubia Saidani; Laure Stanchina-Chatrousse; Yolande Masson; Anand Patwardhan; Floriane Gilles-Marsens; Cédric Delevoye; Sophie Domingues; Xavier Nissan; Cécile Martinat; Gilles Lemaitre; Marc Peschanski; Christine Baldeschi,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2015-07-21,10.1073/pnas.1501032112,abstract_only,False
PMID:7474134,Frequent disruption of the Nf1 gene by a novel murine AIDS virus-related provirus in BXH-2 murine myeloid lymphomas.,"Evi-2, a common site of viral integration in BXH-2 myeloid lymphomas, is located within a large intron of the Nf1 tumor suppressor gene. Viral integration at Evi-2 appears to induce disease by disrupting normal Nf1 expression. During our attempts to characterize the nature of the proviruses located at Evi-2, we found that approximately half of the proviruses were defective nonecotropic proviruses (A. M. Buchberg, H. G. Bedigian, N. A. Jenkins, and N. G. Copeland, Mol. Cell. Biol. 10:4658-4666, 1990). This was surprising, since most proviruses characterized at other BXH-2 common integration sites are full-length ecotropic viruses. In the studies described here, we found that this defective provirus carries two large deletions, one in pol and one in env, and is structurally related to another murine retrovirus, the murine AIDS retrovirus. By using oligonucleotide probes specific for this defective provirus, designated MRV, we showed that MRV-related proviruses are carried as endogenous germ line proviruses in most inbred strains. In addition, we identified the endogenous MRV provirus that gives rise to the defective proviruses identified at Evi-2. We present a model that accounts for the positive selection of MRV proviruses at Evi-2, which may allow selective identification of common viral integration sites harboring tumor suppressor genes.",,B C Cho; J D Shaughnessy; D A Largaespada; H G Bedigian; A M Buchberg; N A Jenkins; N G Copeland,Journal of virology,1995-11,10.1128/JVI.69.11.7138-7146.1995,abstract_only,False
PMID:18632626,Merlin is a potent inhibitor of glioma growth.,"Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is an inherited cancer syndrome in which affected individuals develop nervous system tumors, including schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas. The NF2 protein merlin (or schwannomin) is a member of the Band 4.1 superfamily of proteins, which serve as linkers between transmembrane proteins and the actin cytoskeleton. In addition to mutational inactivation of the NF2 gene in NF2-associated tumors, mutations and loss of merlin expression have also been reported in other types of cancers. In the present study, we show that merlin expression is dramatically reduced in human malignant gliomas and that reexpression of functional merlin dramatically inhibits both subcutaneous and intracranial growth of human glioma cells in mice. We further show that merlin reexpression inhibits glioma cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis in vivo. Using microarray analysis, we identify altered expression of specific molecules that play key roles in cell proliferation, survival, and motility. These merlin-induced changes of gene expression were confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR, Western blotting, and functional assays. These results indicate that reexpression of merlin correlates with activation of mammalian sterile 20-like 1/2-large tumor suppressor 2 signaling pathway and inhibition of canonical and noncanonical Wnt signals. Collectively, our results show that merlin is a potent inhibitor of high-grade human glioma.","Materials and Methods Patient samples The glioma tissue microarray was assembled at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, and additional tumor samples were obtained from the Washington University/Siteman Cancer Center Tumor Tissue Repository, as previously described ( 12 ). Human tissues were used in accordance with approved Human Studies Protocols. Cell lines and reagents Human glioma cells, M089J, U138MG, DBRG05MG, LN229, M059K, Hs683, LN18, LN229, and A172 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC); SNB19, U373MG, SF763, U251, SF268, SF539, U343MG, SF188, SF295, SF797, SNB75, SF126, SF210, U118MG, and U87MG and rat glioma cell 9L were obtained from University of California-San Francisco and National Cancer Institute (NCI). Normal human astrocytes (NHA cells) were obtained from ALLCELLS, Inc. Cells were maintained following the providers’ and manufacturers’ instructions. Anti-v5 epitope (Invitrogen), anti-merlin (Santa Cruz), anti–mammalian sterile 20-like 1/2 (MST1/2; Bethyl Laboratories), anti-Lats2 (Bethyl Laboratories), anti–Yes-associated protein (YAP; Abnova), anti–cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1/2 (cIAP1/2; Santa Cruz), anti-actin (Sigma), anti–phosphorylated MST1/2 (Cell Signaling), anti–phosphorylated Lats2 (Abnova), and anti–phosphorylated YAP (Cell Signaling) were used in the experiments. 5-Bromo-2’-deoxy-uridine (BrdUrd) cell proliferation kit (Roche), Apoptag kit (Chemicon), and RhoA pull-down kit (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) were also used. Reverse transcriptase-PCR, mutagenesis, and expression and knockdown constructions Full-length merlin isoform I was obtained as described ( 13 ), and the merlin mutants were generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kits (Stratagene). Wild-type merlin and the merlin mutants together with their COOH terminal v5-epitope tags were cloned into the retroviral expression vector pQCXIP (BD Bioscience; ref.  13 ). Retroviruses were generated using these expression constructs and pVSVG/ GP2 293 cells following the manufacturer’s instructions (BD Bioscience). All expression constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. To knockdown merlin expression, several shRNAmir constructs against human merlin and a nontargeting shRNAmir control construct were obtained from Open Biosystems. Lentiviruses carrying these short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) were generated following the manufacturer’s instructions. Lentivirus and retrovirus transduction U87MG and U251 human glioma cells were first transduced with retroviruses carrying luciferase and a hygromycin-resistant gene and then transduced with retroviruses carrying the empty retroviral expression vector, wild-type merlin, or merlin mutants. RNA knockdown was accomplished using lentiviruses carrying shRNAs against merlin and a nontargeting control shRNA following the manufacturer’s instructions. Infected cells were selected for their resistance to hygromycin and puromycin. Anti-v5 monoclonal antibody (mAb; Invitrogen) was used to detect exogenous merlin, whereas anti-merlin antibodies (Santa Cruz) were used for endogenous merlin. Expression profiling and real-time quantitative PCR To compare gene expression profiles, we used human U133v2 gene chips (Affymetrix) and the probes derived from three independently transduced and pooled puromycin-resistant U87MG cells that reexpress merlin (U87MG merlin ) or were transduced with empty retroviruses (U87MG wt ) following standard protocols at the University of Pennsylvania Microarray Facility. Probe intensity data were imported to ArrayAssist Lite version 3.4 (Stratagene), and expression values for the probe sets were calculated using GCRMA. Affymetrix Absent, Marginal, and Present ( A, M, P ) scoring designations were also included. The data were then imported back to GeneSpringGX version 7.3.1 (Agilent) and filtered based on  P  in at least two of six samples. Finally, SAM version 2.2.1 (Stanford University) was applied using a two-class unpaired analysis, and differentially expressed genes were identified using a fold change cutoff of > 1.5 and a false discovery rate of <5%. For patient sample analysis, cDNAs were prepared from 1µg total RNA. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed and analyzed as previously described ( 12 ). In addition, total RNAs from U87MG merlin  and U87MG wt  cells were isolated using RNeasy columns (Qiagen). cDNAs were generated using SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for reverse transcription–PCR (Invitrogen). Primers for real-time qPCR were designed according to the Primer Bank Program (Massachusetts General Hospital 3 ). qPCR was performed by using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Roche) and the Chromo4 real-time PCR Machine (Bio-Rad). The cycling variables used were 95°C for 8 min followed by 40 cycles of 95°C (15 s), 60°C (30s), and 72°C (30 s) and a melting curve analysis. Relative quantification of the targets were normalized with an endogenous housekeeping gene (TATA-box binding protein), and data analyses were performed using a comparative (ΔΔCt) method using manufacturer’s software and according to manufacturer’s instructions. Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry Cells and tumor samples were extracted with 4 × SDS Laemmli sample buffer without the dye, and protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad D c  Protein Assay Reagents. For the immunocytochemical analyses, glioma cells were cultured in 35-mm dishes for 24 h and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were then washed with PBS and blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin. Antibodies against v5-epitope or merlin were used to detect the appropriate antigens. Soft agar colony formation assays To perform anchorage-independent growth assays, six-well plates were first covered with a layer of 0.6% agar made in 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) DMEM and the pooled population of transduced U87MG cells (1 × 10 5  per well) in 0.3% agar (in DMEM) were seeded on top of the 0.6% agar layer and incubated in a humidified chamber for 3 wk. The six-well plates were inspected, and 30 randomly selected fields were photographed under a 2.5× microscopic lens and a 10× optical lens (25× magnification). Colonies were then counted, and the mean number of colonies per field was calculated. All experiments were done in triplicate. Transwell tumor cell invasion assay Tumor cell invasion assays were performed using Transwell chambers with 8-µm pores (Costar) that were coated with a layer of Matrigel (Collaborative Biomedical). DMEM containing 10% FBS was added to the lower chambers of the Transwells. Transduced U87MG cells (2 × 10 5  per well) were seeded on the top of the Transwell in triplicate and incubated for 24 h. The bottom filters were fixed and stained at the end of the experiments. Cells in the top chambers were removed by wiping with cotton swabs, and the stained cells that had migrated through the Matrigel were counted under a microscope. Thirty randomly selected 100× microscopic fields were counted. Apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic drug and irradiation Transduced U87MG cells were cultured with different concentrations of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (0, 5, or 50 µmol/L; Sigma) and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. After the incubation period, the floating and adherent cells were harvested for apoptosis detection ( n  = 6). 4 × 10 6  transduced U87MG cells were irradiated by γ-radiation at a dose rate of 2.78 Gy/min and divided into sets that received 0, 5, 10, or 20 Gy of total irradiation. Irradiated cells were replated into culture dishes and incubated at 37°C for 2 d before harvest ( n  = 6). Detection of apoptosis Collected cells were lysed, diluted to 10 4  cells/mL in lysis buffer, and assayed for apoptosis using the Cell Death Detection ELISA kit (Roche), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Luciferase reporter assay To measure canonical Wnt signaling in U87MG wt  and U87MG merlinS518D , U87MG merlin , and U87MG merlinS518A  cells, we used the β-catenin–responsive luciferase reporter construct (TopFlash, Addgene), which contains T-cell factor/lymphocyte enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) binding sites and a negative control construct, FopFlash, which contains mutated TCF/LEF binding sites. These reporters were transfected transiently into these transduced glioma cells in triplicate. The luciferase activity in these transfected cells were measured 24 h posttransfection following the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega) using a Modulus Microplate Luminometer/Fluorometer (Turner Biosystems). Subcutaneous and intracranial tumor growth experiments Pooled populations of transduced U87MG and U251 glioma cells were used for subcutaneous tumor growth experiments. Briefly, 1 × 10 6  glioma cells were injected into each immunocompromised B6.129S7-Rag1 tmMom  (Rag1, Jackson Laboratories) mouse. Six mice were used for each type of the infected glioma cell lines. After solid tumors became visible (10–15 d after the injection), the longest and shortest diameters of the solid tumors were measured using a digital caliper every third day for 5 to 7 wk. Tumor volumes were calculated using the following formula: tumor volume = 1 / 2 × (shortest diameter) 2  × longest diameter (mm 3 ). At the end of the experiments, tumors were fixed and sectioned for the histologic and immunologic analyses. Transduced U87MG and U251 cells were also used for the intracranial tumor growth experiments. U87MG (2 × 10 5 cells in 10 µL HBSS/Rag1 mouse)/U251 cells (1 × 10 5 cells in 10 µL HBSS/Rag1 mouse) were stereotactically injected at the bregma 2 mm to the right of the sagittal suture and 3 mm below the surface of the skull. After injection, mice were closely monitored and the duration of their survival was recorded. Mice that showed signs of morbidity were euthanized and considered as if they had died on that day, and the number of surviving mice was recorded. The survival rates were calculated as follows: survival rate (%) = (number of mice still alive / total number of experimental mice) × 100%. At the end of the experiments, the mouse brains were removed, fixed, and sectioned for histologic analysis. Mice that were free of symptoms 60 d after intracranial injection were euthanized and examined. Bioluminescence imaging analysis of the intracranial gliomas To monitor the growth of intracranial gliomas in living animal, we used bioluminescence imaging approach. We infected U87MG and U251 cells with a retroviral-based luciferase expression vector that also contains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and the hygromycin resistance gene. Hygromycin-resistant U87MG and U251 cells express a high level of luciferase (data not shown). These cells were then infected with retroviruses carrying the empty retroviral expression vector containing puromycin-resistant gene alone (U87MG/U251-Luc wt ) or containing wild-type merlin (U87MG/U251-Luc merlin ), merlinS518A (U87MG/U251-Luc merlinS518A ), or merlinS518D (U87MG/U251-Luc merlinS518D ). These double drug-resistant cells expressed high levels of luciferase and/or wt merlin/merlin mutant and were used for intracranial injection into Rag-1 mice. At 4, 10, and 16 d after the injections, bioluminescence images of the intracranial tumors were acquired by using IVIS-200 imaging system (Xenogen) at  In vivo  Molecular Imaging Shared Facility (Mount Sinai School of Medicine). Histology and immunohistochemistry To determine the tumor cell proliferation rate  in vivo , BrdUrd was injected i.p. into mice 4 h before euthanasia. Gliomas were removed, fixed, sectioned, and stained with H&E as described ( 13 ). In addition, the sections were reacted with anti-BrdUrd antibodies to detect proliferating cells or with the Apoptag kit to detect apoptotic cells  in situ  ( 14 ). Statistics Other than the survival experiments, Student’s  t  test was used to analyze statistical differences between the control and experimental groups. For the mouse survival experiments, log-rank statistical analysis (SigmaStat) was used to calculate the statistical differences between control and experimental groups. Differences were considered statistically significant at  p  < 0.05.",Ying-Ka Ingar Lau; Lucas B Murray; Sean S Houshmandi; Yin Xu; David H Gutmann; Qin Yu,Cancer research,2008-07-15,10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-0190,minimal,True
PMID:37817770,Single-cell RNA sequencing of neurofibromas reveals a tumor microenvironment favorable for neural regeneration and immune suppression in a neurofibromatosis type 1 porcine model.,"Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common genetically inherited disorders that affects 1 in 3000 children annually. Clinical manifestations vary widely but nearly always include the development of cutaneous, plexiform and diffuse neurofibromas that are managed over many years. Recent single-cell transcriptomics profiling efforts of neurofibromas have begun to reveal cell signaling processes. However, the cell signaling networks in mature, non-cutaneous neurofibromas remain unexplored. Here, we present insights into the cellular composition and signaling within mature neurofibromas, contrasting with normal adjacent tissue, in a porcine model of NF1 using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis and histopathological characterization. These neurofibromas exhibited classic diffuse-type histologic morphology and expected patterns of S100, SOX10, GFAP, and CD34 immunohistochemistry. The porcine mature neurofibromas closely resemble human neurofibromas histologically and contain all known cellular components of their human counterparts. The scRNA-seq confirmed the presence of all expected cell types within these neurofibromas and identified novel populations of fibroblasts and immune cells, which may contribute to the tumor microenvironment by suppressing inflammation, promoting M2 macrophage polarization, increasing fibrosis, and driving the proliferation of Schwann cells. Notably, we identified tumor-associated ","Materials and methods Porcine tumor and non-tumor tissue collection for scRNA-seq Experiments involving animals were conducted under protocols approved by the University of Wisconsin–Madison Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with published National Institutes of Health and United States Department of Agriculture guidelines. We have previously published on the creation and genomic validation of our three distinct NF1 porcine models, including the one utilized in this study ( 24 ). The present study used tissue samples (two tumors and an adjacent normal region) collected from a 3.83-year-old male NF1 pig harboring an  NF1  exon a31 excision producing an alternatively spliced  NF1  allele, whose regulation is associated with disease severity ( 24 ,  26 ). Development of the masses was first noted when the animal was about 11 months of age; the masses increased in size with age until the animal was euthanized for necropsy and tissue collection. The pig was bred and housed at the UW Swine Research and Teaching Center, a closed-herd, specific-pathogen-free (SPF) facility. The pig was transported to an on-campus facility on the day of the necropsy. The pig was initially sedated with intramuscular administration of a cocktail of Telazol ®  (3.3 mg/kg; Zoetis Inc., Kalamazoo, MI, USA), xylazine (1.6 mg/kg; Bimeda, Inc., Oakbrook Terrace, IL, USA), and ketamine (1.6 mg/kg; Zoetis Inc.). An additional dose of ketamine (2 mg/kg) was given intramuscularly before euthanasia with intracardiac administration of Fatal-Plus ®  Euthanasia Solution (Vortech Pharmaceutical Ltd, Dearborn, MI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The necropsy was led by two board-certified veterinary pathologists. Caudodorsal subcutaneous masses were identified on the right and left sides of the thorax and resected, providing two samples we have called Mass 1 and Mass 2 ( 
 ). A non-tumor, normal adjacent sample was collected to serve as the control. Upon gross examination, the masses were primarily located in the subcutaneous tissue and extended into the overlying dermis. Like human neurofibromas, both masses appeared light-yellow to tan in color, semi-firm, and variably demarcated from surrounding tissue. Mass 1 was located on the right caudodorsal thorax, 88 cm caudal to the base of the right pinna, and 12 cm to the right of midline, while Mass 2 was located left caudodorsal thorax, at approximately the same level as the right caudodorsal mass, 10.5 cm left of midline. Once incised around the masses, Mass 1 was approximately 6 x 5 x 3.2 cm, while Mass 2 was 11.7 x 11.7 x 3.2 cm. Each tumor tissue sample was taken from the center of the mass and divided into two segments for histological and immunohistochemical validation and the scRNA-seq analysis. Figure 1 
 Figure 1 Study Design: A 3.83-year-old male NF1 pig harboring an excision in exon 31 of  NF1  and two caudodorsal masses of interest was sedated and then euthanized. The masses and an adjacent normal region were resected out and sectioned for histopathological validation and scRNA-seq analysis. Histology and immunohistochemistry Tissue sections were processed and embedded using an adapted protocol (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) ( 27 ). Briefly, following fixation with 10% neutral buffered formalin, tissues placed in processing/embedding cassettes were dehydrated using increasing ethanol concentrations. This was followed by clearing with three changes of xylene for 20 minutes each. Xylene was then exchanged with two paraffin changes (60 minutes each) to allow adequate tissue infiltration of the wax and then embedded. The embedded tissues were cut into 5 µm sections for the conventional hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and IHC staining. The IHC protocol was adapted from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA) ( 28 ). Heat-induced antigen retrieval was performed using a citrate buffer at pH 7.4 ( 29 ). The following antibodies were used to classify the tumors: S100 (1:4000; Agilent Dako, Santa Clara, CA, USA; GA50461-2), CD34 (1:400; Bioss, Woburn, MA, USA; bs-8996R), Sox10 (1:100; Abcam, Cambridge, UK; ab227680), CD117 (1:100, Cell Signaling; 37805S), GFAP (1:200, Abcam; ab16997), AIF1 (1:500, LSBio; LS-B2645), and SMA (1:250, LSBio; LS-B3933). Briefly, the primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4°C while the secondary antibodies, including anti-rabbit, anti-goat, and anti-mouse (1:250, Abcam; ab6728, ab6885, ab6721, respectively), were incubated on slides for 30 minutes at room temperature. The targets of interest were detected using a DAB chromogen substrate kit (Cell Signaling; #8059) and counterstained using Mayer’s Hematoxylin for 30 seconds (Abcam; ab220365). RNA extraction and single-cell sequencing The samples for the scRNA-seq analysis were promptly placed into 1.5 mL conical tubes on ice until enzymatically digestion could be started within the hour to obtain a single cell suspension ( 30 ). Briefly, each tissue sample was minced into <4 mm pieces and digested with a Tumor Dissociation Kit (Cat #130-095-929; Miltenyi Biotec, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The resulting suspensions were further digested using collagenase II to obtain sufficient cell counts for scRNA-seq (>50,000 cells/sample) ( 31 ). Libraries were constructed according to the Chromium Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kit v3.1 user guide (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA) by the UW Gene Expression Center. Briefly, cell concentration and cell viability of the single-cell suspension were quantified on the Countess II (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) using 0.4% Trypan Blue (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The appropriate volume of cells was loaded onto the Chromium Single Cell Chip G (10X) required for yielding a cell recovery of approximately 50,000 cells. After completing the Chromium run, the gel beads-in-emulsion (GEMs) were transferred to emulsion-safe strip tubes for GEM-RT using an Eppendorf MasterCycler Pro thermocycler (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Following RT, GEMs were broken, and the pooled single-cell cDNA was amplified. Post-cDNA amplified product was purified using SPRIselect (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) and quantified on a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) using the High Sensitivity DNA kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Full-length cDNA was fragmented and used to generate cDNA libraries according to the standard 10X Genomics workflow. These libraries were sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing System (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) with paired-end 150bp sequencing by the UW DNA Sequencing Facility. Preprocessing, mapping, and alignment The scRNA-Seq data were analyzed by the UW Bioinformatics Resource Center. Experiment data were demultiplexed using the Cell Ranger Single Cell Software Suite and aligned to Sscrofa11.1, Barcode counting, UMI counting, and gene expression estimation for each sample according to the 10x Genomics documentation ( 32 ). The gene expression estimates from each sample were then aggregated using Cellranger (cellranger aggr) to compare experimental groups with normalized sequencing depth and expression data. Quality control, data integration, visualization, and clustering Analysis was performed with R Statistical Software (v4.1.3) and Seurat (v4.2.0) ( 33 ). Each sample (Mass 1, Mass 2, and Normal Adjacent Tissue) was individually processed for quality control before integration. Seurat objects were created with thresholds: min.cells = 3, min.features = 200. We used ENSEMBL to identify human orthologs of porcine genes, and manually used VGNC to identify remaining orthologs. Next, data was subsetted based on a threshold for 18 mitochondrial genes set at <10% representation and <1% representation of Hemoglobin Beta ( 
 ). The threshold for unique features per cell was >200 and <6000 to avoid low-quality cells and doublets. Seurat objects for each dataset were merged then split to create lists that can be transformed and normalized using  Supplementary Table 1 
 SCTransform  ( 34 ). Cell type identification Initial clustering divided the cell population into 14 individual clusters, which were automatically identified with  ScType  ( 
 ) using a modified marker list generated by converting human gene symbols to orthologous  Supplementary Table 2 
 Sus scrofa  gene symbols ( 35 ). Lists of cell types were curated and included markers for all possible cell types within these tissues, and subsequent cell type scores were generated using the full scRNA-seq dataset and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) ( 35 ). Automatically scored and identified cell types were then verified manually using commonly known cell type markers ( 
 ). Violin plots for cell types are depicted using the raw RNA counts for genes of interest. Supplementary Table 1 
 Differentially expressed genes Analysis of gene expression was performed using Seurat v4.2.0 ( 
 ), and DEGs were identified using the normalized RNA counts, or the SCT assay. To prepare the Seurat object to run differential expression testing on the SCT assay, we used  Supplementary Document 
 PrepSCTFindMarkers().  For bulk comparisons of tumor vs. normal, we used  RenameIdent()  to merge both Mass 1 and Mass 2. Populations were subsetted for comparison using  Subset().  Pairwise comparisons between clusters was made using  FindMarkers()  and specific identification of clusters. DEGs in one cluster compared to all other clusters were done using  FindAllMarkers().  The default Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used for analysis. DEGs were defined as being expressed in >20% of the cluster, with |logFC| >0.25, and adjusted p-value <0.05 ( 
 ,  Supplementary Tables 3 
 
 ). 4 
 Gene set enrichment analysis and gene ontology DEG lists were populated with  Sus scrofa  Ensembl IDs. First, we automatically converted Ensembl IDs using “biomaRt” datasets “sscrofa_gene_ensembl” and “hsapiens_gene_ensembl”. This method was only successful in converting ~70% of  Sus scrofa  Ensembl IDs to human gene symbols. The remaining IDs were then converted manually, and the list was uploaded to R to be used for GSEA. The Fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (fgsea) package was used to analyze enriched pathways from the GO: Gene Ontology gene sets ( 36 ). The top 15 enriched pathways were visualized by adjusted p-value initially, and only pathways with an adjusted p-value <0.05 were used for further analysis. Enrichment plots were visualized using  plotEnrichment()  of specified pathways ( 
 ).

PMID:7911002,Frequent NF2 gene transcript mutations in sporadic meningiomas and vestibular schwannomas.,"The gene for the hereditary disorder neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), which predisposes for benign CNS tumors such as vestibular schwannomas and meningiomas, has been assigned to chromosome 22 and recently has been isolated. Mutations in the NF2 gene were found in both sporadic meningiomas and vestibular schwannomas. However, so far only 6 of the 16 exons of the gene have been analyzed. In order to extend the analysis of an involvement of the NF2 gene in the sporadic counterparts of these NF2-related tumors, we have used reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification followed by SSCP and DNA sequence analysis to screen for mutations in the coding region of the NF2 gene. Analysis of the NF2 gene transcript in 53 unrelated patients with meningiomas and vestibular schwannomas revealed mutations in 32% of the sporadic meningiomas (n = 44), in 50% of the sporadic vestibular schwannomas (n = 4), in 100% of the tumors found in NF2 patients (n = 2), and in one of three tumors from multiple-meningioma patients. Of the 18 tumors in which a mutation in the NF2 gene transcript was observed and the copy number of chromosome 22 could be established, 14 also showed loss of (parts of) chromosome 22. This suggests that in sporadic meningiomas and NF2-associated tumors the NF2 gene functions as a recessive tumor-suppressor gene. The mutations detected resulted mostly in frameshifts, predicting truncations starting within the N-terminal half of the putative protein.",,R H Lekanne Deprez; A B Bianchi; N A Groen; B R Seizinger; A Hagemeijer; E van Drunen; D Bootsma; J W Koper; C J Avezaat; N Kley,American journal of human genetics,1994-06,,abstract_only,False
PMID:28542306,Gene signature associated with benign neurofibroma transformation to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.,"Benign neurofibromas, the main phenotypic manifestations of the rare neurological disorder neurofibromatosis type 1, degenerate to malignant tumors associated to poor prognosis in about 10% of patients. Despite efforts in the field of (epi)genomics, the lack of prognostic biomarkers with which to predict disease evolution frustrates the adoption of appropriate early therapeutic measures. To identify potential biomarkers of malignant neurofibroma transformation, we integrated four human experimental studies and one for mouse, using a gene score-based meta-analysis method, from which we obtained a score-ranked signature of 579 genes. Genes with the highest absolute scores were classified as promising disease biomarkers. By grouping genes with similar neurofibromatosis-related profiles, we derived panels of potential biomarkers. The addition of promoter methylation data to gene profiles indicated a panel of genes probably silenced by hypermethylation. To identify possible therapeutic treatments, we used the gene signature to query drug expression databases. Trichostatin A and other histone deacetylase inhibitors, as well as cantharidin and tamoxifen, were retrieved as putative therapeutic means to reverse the aberrant regulation that drives to malignant cell proliferation and metastasis. This in silico prediction corroborated reported experimental results that suggested the inclusion of these compounds in clinical trials. This experimental validation supported the suitability of the meta-analysis method used to integrate several sources of public genomic information, and the reliability of the gene signature associated to the malignant evolution of neurofibromas to generate working hypotheses for prognostic and drug-responsive biomarkers or therapeutic measures, thus showing the potential of this in silico approach for biomarker discovery.","Materials and methods The detailed workflow of selection and pre-processing of microarrays used to obtain the MPNST vs. NF gene signature, translation to ENSEMBL gene names, and computation of gene scores and of effect size medians, and final filters are shown in  S4 Fig . Where appropriate, tables are indicated for some of the main results generated (right). The meta-analysis PRISMA checklist is included as supporting information ( S2 Appendix ). Study selection Microarray and DNA methylation studies were selected from GEO and ArrayExpress public databases using the key words NF1, MPNST, neurofibromatosis, and neurofibroma; we included high-throughput sequencing, microarray and methylation data. Additional selection criteria were 1) for microarray studies, only data from Affymetrix, Agilent, ABI and Illumina platforms were allowed, and 2) we only considered studies accepted for publication, with raw data from samples from cell cultures or nerve tumors. Microarray data preprocessing Each microarray was preprocessed and evaluated independently using the R/BioConductor software environment [ 63 ]. R packages used in pre-processing steps are detailed in Materials and methods A in  S1 Appendix . After grouping dNF and pNF samples as NF, and sporadic and NF1-associated as MPNST, the resulting expression set was filtered to discard features with FDR values >0.05 obtained by ANOVA. The expression set derived was used to assess appropriate grouping of samples from the independent studies by principal component analysis (PCA), as shown in  S5  and  S6  Figs. The final derived expression set was used to analyze gene differential expression. Probe name translation to human ENSEMBL and HUGO gene IDs and mapping in human chromosome arms As integration of scores from different platforms required common identifiers, we translated probe names from each study to ENSEMBL human gene IDs according to Ensembl Archive release 82 (September 2015). To obtain a unique score for each gene, we selected the score of the probe with the greatest variation when the identifier was present more than once. This variation was calculated as the variance of normalized expression values of all samples from the two phenotypes compared. Mouse gene IDs were also translated to human homologous gene IDs. Human ENSEMBL gene IDs were associated with HUGO gene nomenclature IDs and mapped to human chromosomes and bands. Details of ENSEMBL gene ID association to human chromosome arms are shown in Materials and methods B in  S1 Appendix . Gene scores across studies and final individual gene score in a two-phenotype comparison Gene scores were also computed in the R/Bioconductor environment [ 63 ]; Materials and methods C in  S1 Appendix  details the formula and computation method used. In an example illustrating the factors involved in gene score computation,  S13 Table  shows values for the differentially expressed genes obtained by comparing MPNST vs. NF from the  GSE66743  study. The final score across studies of a single species was calculated as the sum of standardized individual s ij  scores. Final human and mouse scores were weighted for human results. Genes exclusive to mouse were ignored and mouse data that differed from human data in the expression ratio sign were discarded. The human score was calculated by adding scores from human studies. Inclusion of murine data was limited to genes for which the sign for the final human and mouse scores were identical, and final human scores were not null. logFC and logFC_m of genes across studies Gene logFC were calculated across the studies as the median value of logFC ij ; logFC ij  values for each gene (i) in each individual study (j) were obtained in the phenotype comparison. Gene logFC_m were computed as the median value of logFC_m ij ; we have defined logFC_m ij  as the log 2  of the median value of all expression ratios between phenotypes. To avoid inconsistency, the same restriction imposed on the final score was used for logFC and logFC_m values. The signs for human median values of computed logFC/logFC_m were compared with those of mouse. If human and mouse signs were equal, the mouse logFC/ logFC_m was used to compute the final logFC/logFC_m. If the signs were different, mouse values were ignored and human values were used as the final logFC/logFC_m. Final filters to obtain the gene signature To avoid inconsistency, the resulting list of genes with non-null score was screened to remove genes showing score signs opposite to those of logFC values ( S4 Fig , third filter). To select genes with the highest score and median size effect values, a final filter was applied to the previous gene list ( S4 Fig , fourth filter). This filter screened 10% of genes with the highest scores (genes with positive score) and 10% of genes with the lowest score (genes with negative score). In both cases, the absolute logFC value should be >0.99. Computation of bias in score values among studies: Bhattacharyya distance (BD) ratio To determine the relative influence of individual experiments on final score values, we computed for each gene the BD between the observed distribution of score frequency and the expected discrete distribution if each study contributed equally to the final score. The lowest BD values thus correlated with similar contributions of individual studies to final score values, while the highest values indicated disparity in the contribution of individual studies. To compare BD without considering the number of studies available for each gene, we computed the BD ratio by dividing the BD by the maximum possible BD value considering the number of studies for each gene. The lowest and highest BD ratio values indicated the similar or dissimilar contribution of each study to each gene score, respectively. A BD ratio equal to zero was applied exceptionally to those genes for which only one study was available, to distinguish these genes from those for which there was more than one study, although only one showed a non-null score. Computation details are given in Materials and methods D in  S1 Appendix . Statistical analyses To determine the statistical significance of the different gene distribution frequencies in human chromosome regions, we calculated the accumulated probability of a binomial distribution P(X≥x) using the pbinom function from the R stats package; **** P ≤0.0001, *** 0.0001<P≤0.001, ** 0.001 <P≤0.01, * 0.01<P≤0.01. The expected frequency of gene distribution in human chromosome arms/bands was calculated considering the association of ENSEMBL gene IDs to human chromosome arms/bands. To assess correlation between values of two vectors, Pearson's product-moment correlation was calculated using the cor.test function from the R stats package. Gene and pathway functional enrichment The over-representation test for GO terms from GO Ontology database release 2016_09_24 (The Gene Ontology Consortium, 2015) was performed through PANTHER v.10 (release 20160715; [ 64 ]) using ENSEMBL IDs as input, Homo sapiens (all genes in the database) as reference list, GO biological process, GO molecular function and GO cellular component complete as Annotation Data Set, and the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (P <0.05). The EnrichNet tool [ 65 ] was used to inspect KEGG, BioCarta, Wiki Pathways and Reactome databases to search for pathways in which a differentially expressed group of genes is enriched compared to the whole human genome; ENSEMBL IDs were used as input. Only pathways with a significant XD-score or Fischer q-value <0.1 were considered. The search for opposite and similar gene signatures in CMap-DrugMatrix and GEO databases in NFFinder was performed as described [ 20 ]. Gene clustering and visualization Genes were grouped using SOTA [ 66 ] implemented in the analysis and visualization tool MultiexperimentViewer MeV v. 4.9 [ 67 ]. Parameters were fit by default, including distance (Pearson correlation), and Max. Cycles (100). Sample tree was carried out using hierarchical clustering to optimize sample leaf order. Pearson correlation was selected as the distance metric, and average linkage clustering as the linkage method. DNA methylation analysis Methylation data were downloaded from GEO, and inspected and analyzed using the MEDIPS R package [ 68 ]. Linux command lines, R code based on Lienhard  et al . [ 68 ], and details of the analysis are shown in Materials and methods E in  S1 Appendix .",Marta Martínez; Carlos O S Sorzano; Alberto Pascual-Montano; Jose M Carazo,PloS one,2017,10.1371/journal.pone.0178316,minimal,True
PMID:39863790,A multicenter study of neurofibromatosis type 1 utilizing deep learning for whole body tumor identification.,"Deep-learning models have shown promise in differentiating between benign and malignant lesions. Previous studies have primarily focused on specific anatomical regions, overlooking tumors occurring throughout the body with highly heterogeneous whole-body backgrounds. Using neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) as an example, this study developed highly accurate MRI-based deep-learning models for the early automated screening of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) against complex whole-body background. In a Chinese seven-center cohort, data from 347 subjects were analyzed. Our one-step model incorporated normal tissue/organ labels to provide contextual information, offering a solution for tumors with complex backgrounds. To address privacy concerns, we utilized a lightweight deep neural network suitable for hospital deployment. The final model achieved an accuracy of 85.71% for MPNST diagnosis in the validation cohort and 84.75% accuracy in the independent test set, outperforming another classic two-step model. This success suggests potential for AI models in screening other whole-body primary/metastatic tumors.","Methods Study design and participants This multicenter study used MRI image sets from seven hospitals in China, including Shanghai Ninth People’s Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine; Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center; Shanghai Sixth People’s Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine,; Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University; Huashan Hospital, Fudan University; Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin Medical University; The Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University/Hebei Tumor Hospital. Cross-sectional MRI image sets with T2-weighted sequences of patients from 2010 to 2021 with pathologically confirmed diagnoses of PNF/MPNST were eligible for inclusion. Poor quality and nondiagnostic MRI image sets were excluded. There were no limitations on the number of MRI image sets from one individual that could be included, and some image sets included more than one tumor lesion. Given that PNF/MPNST can occur in various body regions among different patients, MRI image sets of different body regions were included as long as the existence of tumor lesions was confirmed. Additionally, another independent MRI image set was adopted for model testing. This multicenter study adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and received approval from the institutional review board of Shanghai Ninth People’s Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SH9H-2019-T163-2, SH9H-2019-T163-5). As patients were retrospectively recruited, informed consent was exempted by the review board. Clinical manifestations The clinical manifestations of the individuals from Shanghai Ninth People’s Hospital were abstracted for analysis and included age at each MRI examination, sex, pathological diagnosis (PNF or MPNST), presence of spontaneous persistent pain, motor deficits, hard or soft texture, and whether rapid growth was reported in a short period (reported by the patients or their parents). This inclusion was also approved by the aforementioned review board. As the collection of clinical manifestations in other centers was not included in the above ethical approval, we did not include this information in our study for ethical concerns. Furthermore, we have ensured that any data shared in the study cannot be traced back to individual patients, thereby upholding their confidentiality. Image acquisition MRI scans were accumulated within the Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) across all participating centers for each patient. In the context of a retrospective multi-center study, inter-site variability emerged due to disparate devices and acquisition protocols, presenting a significant challenge in these types of studies. In this study, the MRI scanners included devices from GE Medical Systems, Siemens, Philips Medical Systems, and United Imaging Healthcare; the magnetic field strengths included 1.5 T and 3.0 T; slice thicknesses varied among different body regions, including 3 mm, 4 mm, 5 mm, 5.5 mm, 6 mm, etc., with or without diffusion-weighted imaging sequences and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging sequences. Given the large diversity in MRI scanners and the fact that this study only used axial T2-weighted fat suppression sequences, we only described the detailed parameters of the axial T2-weighted fat suppression sequence in the four most frequently used MRI devices in this study (Supplementary Table  4 ). Since the parameter varied not only across different devices but also across different body regions, this table used head and neck MRI as an example. Even though the efficacy may have marginally been affected, we believe that the use of a diverse dataset also has its advantages, such as increased generalizability and applicability to real-world scenarios where multiple imaging devices are often used. Image slice selection and quality control Axial slices of MRI with typical tumor lesions were selected. All MRI scans and clinical data were carefully reviewed by a board-certified radiologist and a doctor within the plastic and reconstructive surgery department, both with expertise in NF1. Manual image segmentation and annotation Ground truth for the ROI region was manually established in all selected images. This task was completed by two experienced radiologists (Y.T. and C.Y.) and one doctor (C.W.) with expertise in NF1, using RectLabel (Ryo Kawamura, San Francisco, USA) and Colabeler (Kuaiyi Technology Co., Ltd, Hangzhou, China). All three readers were required to delineate and label the tumor lesions and other tissues/organs that they deemed essential. The number of these labels was then counted and sorted in descending order. The top 10 labels were retained, and all 10 labels were cross approved by all three readers. The classic two-step deep-learning model development U-Net, a convolutional neural network (CNN), was utilized to perform automatic segmentation . The runtime environment for our model was on Python 3.7.1, and the model structure is illustrated in Fig.  30 3 . Among all included images, a batch consisted of 4 randomly selected slices. Each time, the model obtained one batch for training, and an epoch referred to all the images being learned at once. The automatically segmented results from the U-Net model were randomly partitioned into the training (1031; 665 MPNST and 366 PNF) and test (35; 17 MPNST and 18 PNF) sets. ResNet 18, an 18-layer deep CNN model, was employed for our differential diagnosis model (the model structure is shown in Fig.  3 ) . The model was developed using PyTorch. 31 The one-step deep learning model development for whole-body tumor identification Another deep learning algorithm, You Only Look Once-v5 (YOLO-v5), was adopted and improved to establish a PNF/MPNST detection and diagnosis system. The model structure is shown in Supplementary Fig.  4 , while the training and prediction process is shown in Supplementary Fig.  5 . In the training process, we developed two distinct models: one with only PNF/MPNST labels and the other with all ten labels included. Due to their similarities on T2-weighted images, the gland and lymph tissue were combined into a single label. Three different loss values were calculated for performance evaluation: box loss, object loss, and class loss. The one-step deep learning model used CIOU (Completed IoU) to calculate the box loss. Model interpretability The Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping can visualize the predictive basis of CNN-based deep learning models by generating saliency maps, which was normally adopted as a method to visually explain these models . By the Grad-CAM, it was possible to observe which regions in the MRI contributed to the MPNST diagnosis. 32 Statistical analysis The included clinical symptoms were all categorical variables, and the chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test was used for different types of data.  P  values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant, and  P  values < 0.01 were considered highly statistically significant.",Cheng-Jiang Wei; Yan Tang; Yang-Bai Sun; Tie-Long Yang; Cheng Yan; Hui Liu; Jun Liu; Jing-Ning Huang; Ming-Han Wang; Zhen-Wei Yao; Ji-Long Yang; Zhi-Chao Wang; Qing-Feng Li,NPJ digital medicine,2025-01-26,10.1038/s41746-025-01454-z,minimal,True
PMID:16524466,Cognitive dysfunction in NF1 knock-out mice may result from altered vesicular trafficking of APP/DRD3 complex.,"BACKGROUND: It has been estimated that more than 50% of patients with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) have neurobehavioral impairments which include attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, visual/spatial learning disabilities, and a myriad of other cognitive developmental problems. The biological mechanisms by which NF1 gene mutations lead to such cognitive deficits are not well understood, although excessive Ras signaling and increased GABA mediated inhibition have been implicated. It is proposed that the cognitive deficits in NF1 are the result of dysfunctional cellular trafficking and localization of molecules downstream of the primary gene defect. RESULTS: To elucidate genes involved in the pathogenic process, gene expression analysis was performed comparing the expression profiles in various brain regions for control and Nf1+/- heterozygous mice. Gene expression analysis was performed for hippocampal samples dissected from postnatal day 10, 15, and 20 mice utilizing the Affymetrix Mouse Genome chip (Murine 430 2.0). Analysis of expression profiles between Nf1+/- and wild-type animals was focused on the hippocampus because of previous studies demonstrating alterations in hippocampal LTP in the Nf1+/- mice, and the region's importance in visual/spatial learning. Network analysis identified links between neurofibromin and kinesin genes, which were down regulated in the Nf1+/- mice at postnatal days 15 and 20. CONCLUSION: Through this analysis, it is proposed that neurofibromin forms a binding complex with amyloid precursor protein (APP) and through filamin proteins interacts with a dopamine receptor (Drd3). Though the effects of these interactions are not yet known, this information may provide novel ideas about the pathogenesis of cognitive defects in NF1 and may facilitate the development of novel targeted therapeutic interventions.","Methods Animals (breeding, dissection, genotyping, and sexing) Nf1 +/-  mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (symbol  Nf1 ) [ tm 1 Fcr 22 ]. Breeder pairs were allowed to mate, and offspring were collected at postnatal days 10, 15, and 20. At these ages, mice were euthanized and bilateral brain regions (hippocampus, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, olfactory bulb, and basal ganglion/thalamus) dissected and immediately flash frozen in an ethanol/dry ice bath. Liver and blood were also collected from each mouse. All tissues were stored at -80°C until RNA or DNA extraction was performed. The  Nf1 +/-  mice contain a Neo targeting cassette, which disrupts the  Nf1  gene to form the knockout allele and can be tested using primers specific for this insert. Genotyping was performed through a series of PCR reactions containing one microliter (approximately 100 ng) of sample DNA, 10 pM of primers, 1× PCR buffer, 2.25 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM of each dNTP, and 1 unit of Taq Gold polymerase. The PCR cycling program started with 95°C for 5 minutes followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 1 minute, 55°C for 1 minute, and 72°C for 1 minute. The final step was 72°C for 10 minutes followed by a 4°C hold. Genotyping and sexing primers included: Control primers (1.2 kilobase product): mMeC.U256 Forward 5'-GTATGATGACCCCACCTTGC mMeC.L1452 Reverse 5'-TTCAGTCCCTTCCCGCTTTT Neo specific primers (2 kilobase product): Neo5' Forward 5'-GCGTGTTCGAATTCGCCAATG Exon 32 Reverse 5'-GAAGGACAGCATCAGCATG Y Chromosome specific primers (200 base pair product): STS162400 Forward 5'GCAAACAACCTCATAGTCCC STS162400 Reverse 5'CTGGATTTGTGACAAGGAGC The reaction product was visualized by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and the presence of bands noted. The control PCR reaction detected a segment of the MeCP2 gene on the X chromosome, and was used to monitor the integrity of template genomic DNA, and the amplification reaction. The presence of a single 2 kb band in the Neo specific reaction indicated a  Nf1 +/-  heterozygous mouse, whereas wild type genomic DNA was represented by absence of a band. Sex was determined by PCR amplification using the Y-chromosome specific primer set. The presence of a band at 200 bp indicates a male mouse and females are shown as the absence of any product. Affymetrix expression profiling Four  Nf1 +/-  mice and four age and sex matched wild type mice were analyzed at each time point. Hippocampi (~20 mg each) from two mice within a single condition were pooled and divided to yield two identical samples, and each was individually extracted, labeled, and hybridized to the Affymetrix (Murine 430 2.0) chip. Total RNA was isolated from each 40 mg tissue sample using Stratagene RTPCR Mini-prep kit (the average yield was 15 μg RNA/40 mg tissue). Extracted RNA was subsequently cleaned using the Qiagen Mini kit protocol, and the purified RNA was analyzed through agarose gel electrophoresis to insure quality. cDNA was synthesis from 7 μg of purified total RNA,  in vitro  transcription, and hybridization proceeded as previously described [ 21 ]. Strict quality controls require that each RNA sample show >4 × amplification through the  in vitro  transcription protocol, that each scanned array should contain >30% present calls across the array, and that the 3'/5' should show consistent values >3 indicating low nonspecific hybridization. Arrays that do not satisfy these conditions were not included in the analysis and a second sample of cRNA was created utilizing a second allotment of stored total RNA from the sample. Data analysis Data was extracted from the array images using Affymetrix Microarray Suite version 5.1 software (MAS5.0). Raw expression data was corrected for saturation at individual probes using an in-house Array Data Manipulation program which replaces S2 values with S1 values if the S2 values are greater than 1500 (baseline normalization of 150) or the S2/S1 signal ratio is less than 0.8. The modified gene expression data for each individual array was imported into GeneSpring v 5.0 (Agilent Technologies). For each time point, average fold changes (relative to wildtype expression data) were calculated with error bars. Genes showing expression changes with significant p-values (p ≤ 0.05) and fold change values of ≥2.0 within at least one time point were exported for functional annotation. Thereafter, the function of each gene was determined through literature searches, genes were binned into ontologic categories, and relevant biological processes and pathways identified. Modeling the dysfunctional genetic network The main goal of both temporal and functional clustering is to generate an integrated pathway beginning with the known primary genetic defect and ending with proteins known to be involved in causing the cognitive pathology under study. This pathway then becomes the template for later  in vivo  validation. The GeneGo network building algorithms (GeneGo, Inc) were used in an iterative fashion to build gene/protein interaction pathways between known NF1 pathway members (NF1, Ras, GABA) and proteins known to be involved in LTP. The gene expression changes with ≥2 fold differences at p ≤ 0.05 were used to seed the algorithms and identified new pathway members which link the primary defect to the cognitive phenotype. All raw expression data is publicly available [ 14 , 15 ]. Validation of the pathogenic cascade Quantitative Real-Time PCR  – Total RNA was extracted from ~20 mg of hippocampus from 3  Nf1 +/-  and 3 wild type mice using the Absolutely RNA Miniprep Kit (Stratagene). Reverse transcription reactions were done using 3 μg of total RNA from hippocampus, oligo dT primers, and the Super Script III First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Resulting cDNA was amplified on the Chromo4 Four-Color Real-Time System (MJ Research) using the DyNAmo HS SYBR Green qPCR Kit (Finnzymes) and gene specific primers. Standardized and optimized primers were ordered from SuperArray Bioscience Corporation. These included primers designed for Stc1 (stanniocalcin1), Htr5a (5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) receptor 5A), Neto2 (neuropilin and tolloid like protein 2), and Frap1 (FK506 binding protein 12-rapamycin associated protein1). The housekeeping gene GAPD (glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) was analyzed using the primer set (f-CCAGTATGACTCCACTCACG, r-GAGATGATGACCCGTTTGGC). For amplification, the following program was employed: a 95°C heat activation step for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94°C for 10 sec, 55°C for 25 sec, 72°C for 30 sec, incubate at 72°C, and plate reads at both 77°C and 81°C. A melting curve was created evaluating the products between 60–95°C reading every 0.2°C. Primer set specificity was verified through melting curve analysis. The threshold for amplification was set as the number of cycles necessary to reach logarithmic fluorescence accumulation (C(T)). Fold difference in cDNA concentration was calculated using the formula F = 2 ((MH-MG)-(WH-WG))  where F = fold difference, MH = mutant housekeeping gene (GAPD) C(T), MG = mutant gene of interest C(T), WH = wild type housekeeping gene (GAPD) C(T), WG = wild type gene of interest C(T) [ 24 , 25 ]. Statistical significance of the resulting fold change values was calculated with a two-tailed t-test assuming unequal variance.",Elizabeth A Donarum; Rebecca F Halperin; Dietrich A Stephan; Vinodh Narayanan,BMC neuroscience,2006-03-08,10.1186/1471-2202-7-22,minimal,True
PMID:32408052,Mutation-Directed Therapeutics for Neurofibromatosis Type I.,"Significant advances in biotechnology have led to the development of a number of different mutation-directed therapies. Some of these techniques have matured to a level that has allowed testing in clinical trials, but few have made it to approval by drug-regulatory bodies for the treatment of specific diseases. While there are still various hurdles to be overcome, recent success stories have proven the potential power of mutation-directed therapies and have fueled the hope of finding therapeutics for other genetic disorders. In this review, we summarize the state-of-the-art of various therapeutic approaches and assess their applicability to the genetic disorder neurofibromatosis type I (NF1). NF1 is caused by the loss of function of neurofibromin, a tumor suppressor and downregulator of the Ras signaling pathway. The condition is characterized by a variety of phenotypes and includes symptoms such as skin spots, nervous system tumors, skeletal dysplasia, and others. Hence, depending on the patient, therapeutics may need to target different tissues and cell types. While we also discuss the delivery of therapeutics, in particular via viral vectors and nanoparticles, our main focus is on therapeutic techniques that reconstitute functional neurofibromin, most notably cDNA replacement, CRISPR-based DNA repair, RNA repair, antisense oligonucleotide therapeutics including exon skipping, and nonsense suppression.",,Andre Leier; David M Bedwell; Ann T Chen; George Dickson; Kim M Keeling; Robert A Kesterson; Bruce R Korf; Tatiana T Marquez Lago; Ulrich F Müller; Linda Popplewell; Jiangbing Zhou; Deeann Wallis,Molecular therapy.

PMID:26549023,"The scaffold protein KSR1, a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of Merlin-deficient tumors.","Merlin has broad tumor-suppressor functions as its mutations have been identified in multiple benign tumors and malignant cancers. In all schwannomas, the majority of meningiomas and 1/3 of ependymomas Merlin loss is causative. In neurofibromatosis type 2, a dominantly inherited tumor disease because of the loss of Merlin, patients suffer from multiple nervous system tumors and die on average around age 40. Chemotherapy is not effective and tumor localization and multiplicity make surgery and radiosurgery challenging and morbidity is often considerable. Thus, a new therapeutic approach is needed for these tumors. Using a primary human in vitro model for Merlin-deficient tumors, we report that the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein, extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) scaffold, kinase suppressor of Ras 1 (KSR1), has a vital role in promoting schwannomas development. We show that KSR1 overexpression is involved in many pathological phenotypes caused by Merlin loss, namely multipolar morphology, enhanced cell-matrix adhesion, focal adhesion and, most importantly, increased proliferation and survival. Our data demonstrate that KSR1 has a wider role than MEK1/2 in the development of schwannomas because adhesion is more dependent on KSR1 than MEK1/2. Immunoprecipitation analysis reveals that KSR1 is a novel binding partner of Merlin, which suppresses KSR1's function by inhibiting the binding between KSR1 and c-Raf. Our proteomic analysis also demonstrates that KSR1 interacts with several Merlin downstream effectors, including E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4(DCAF1). Further functional studies suggests that KSR1 and DCAF1 may co-operate to regulate schwannomas formation. Taken together, these findings suggest that KSR1 serves as a potential therapeutic target for Merlin-deficient tumors.","Materials and Methods Primary Cells and Cell Line Human schwannomas cells were provided by NF2 patients after informed consent. Schwann cells from healthy nerve donors were used in this research. Isolation and culturing were carried out as previously described ( 21 ) and approved by local ethics committees.

PMID:2491784,Multipoint linkage analysis in neurofibromatosis type I: an international collaboration.,"In addition to reporting, in accompanying papers, their individual analyses of mapping the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene on chromosome 17, members of the International Consortium for NF1 Linkage contributed their data for our joint analysis to determine the exact sequence of flanking markers and to obtain precise estimates and confidence limits of the recombination fractions for the closest markers, in anticipation of clinical use. With specimens from 142 families and more than 700 affected persons, eight teams used 31 markers in the pericentric region of chromosome 17 to perform 13,838 genotypings. With the combined data, we used the computer program CRI-MAP to build the most likely sequence of loci by sequentially adding single loci to a fixed pair of loci and separately calculating the likelihood of all permutations of four consecutive loci. The best order is pter-pA10-41-EW301-centromere (p17H8)-pHHH202-NF1-EW206-EW207-EW203++ +-CRI-L581-CRI-L946-HOX2-NGFR-qter. The total genetic distance from pA10-41 to NGFR is 26 cM in males and 56 cM in females, and the overall difference in sex-specific maps is statistically significant (P = .006). The upper 99% confidence limits of the recombination fraction of the closest proximal marker, pHHH202, is 4%, and that for the closest distal marker, EW206, is 9%. These limits should decrease with the use of additional probes and the further evaluation of DNA from the six persons showing multiple recombinations within short genetic distances.

These included schwannomas, Schwann cell hyperplasia, cataract, and osseous metaplasia.

PMID:33080011,"Temporal, spatial, and genetic constraints contribute to the patterning and penetrance of murine neurofibromatosis-1 optic glioma.","BACKGROUND: Brain tumors are the most common solid tumors of childhood, but little is understood about the factors that influence their development. Pediatric low-grade gliomas in particular display unique temporal and spatial localization associated with different genetic mutations (eg, BRAF genomic alterations, mutations in the neurofibromatosis type 1 [NF1] gene) for reasons that remain unclear. NF1 low-grade gliomas typically arise in the optic pathway of young children as optic pathway gliomas (OPGs), likely from a cell of origin that resides within the third ventricular zone (TVZ). However, the factors that contribute to their distinct temporal patterning and penetrance have not been adequately explored. METHODS: TVZ neuroglial progenitor cells (NPCs) were analyzed over the course of mouse brain development. Progenitors isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) were assessed for functional and molecular differences. The impact of different germline Nf1 mutations on TVZ NPC properties was analyzed using genetically engineered mice. RESULTS: We identify 3 individual factors that could each contribute to Nf1 optic glioma temporal patterning and penetrance. First, there are 3 functionally and molecularly distinct populations of mouse TVZ NPCs, one of which (""M"" cells) exhibits the highest clonogenic incidence, proliferation, and abundance during embryogenesis. Second, TVZ NPC proliferation dramatically decreases after birth. Third, germline Nf1 mutations differentially increase TVZ NPC proliferation during embryogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: The unique temporal patterning and penetrance of Nf1 optic glioma reflects the combined effects of TVZ NPC population composition, time-dependent changes in progenitor proliferation, and the differential impact of the germline Nf1 mutation on TVZ NPC expansion.",,Nicole M Brossier; Sharanya Thondapu; Olivia M Cobb; Sonika Dahiya; David H Gutmann,Neuro-oncology,2021-04-12,10.1093/neuonc/noaa237,abstract_only,False
PMID:19262146,Phosphorylation of merlin regulates its stability and tumor suppressive activity.,"The neurofibromatosis-2 (NF2) tumor suppressor protein, merlin or schwannomin, inhibits cell proliferation by modulating the growth activities of its binding partners, including the cell surface glycoprotein CD44, membrane-cytoskeleton linker protein ezrin and PIKE (PI 3-kinase enhancer) GTPase, etc. Merlin exerts its growth suppressive activity through a folded conformation that is tightly controlled through phosphorylation by numerous protein kinases including PAK, PKA and Akt. Merlin inhibits PI 3-kinase activity through binding to PIKE-L. Now, we show that merlin is a physiological substrate of Akt, which phosphorylates merlin on both T230 and S315 residues. This phosphorylation abolishes the folded conformation of merlin and inhibits its association with PIKE-L, provoking merlin polyubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. This finding demonstrates a negative feed-back loop from merlin/PIKE-L/PI 3-kinase to Akt in tumors- The proliferation repressive activity of merlin is also partially regulated by S518 phosphorylation- Thus, Akt-mediated merlin T230/S315 phosphorylation, combined with S518 phosphorylation by PAK and PKA, provides new insight into abrogating merlin function in the absence of merlin mutational inactivation.",,Keqiang Ye,Cell adhesion & migration,2007,10.4161/cam.1.4.5192,abstract_only,False
PMID:31033921,[18F]fluorothymidine and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET Imaging Demonstrates Uptake and Differentiates Growth in Neurofibromatosis 2 Related Vestibular Schwannoma.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether [F]fluorothymidine (FLT) and/or [F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) can differentiate growth in neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) related vestibular schwannomas (VS) and to evaluate the importance of PET scanner spatial resolution on measured tumor uptake. METHODS: Six NF2 patients with 11 VS (4 rapidly growing, 7 indolent), were scanned with FLT and FDG using a high-resolution research tomograph (HRRT, Siemens) and a Siemens Biograph TrueV PET-CT, with and without resolution modeling image reconstruction. Mean, maximum, and peak standardised uptake values (SUV) for each tumor were derived and the intertumor correlation between FDG and FLT uptake was compared. The ability of FDG and FLT SUV values to discriminate between rapidly growing and slow growing (indolent) tumors was assessed using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: Tumor uptake was seen with both tracers, using both scanners, with and without resolution modeling. FDG and FLT uptake was correlated (R = 0.67-0.86, p < 0.01) and rapidly growing tumors displayed significantly higher uptake (SUVmean and SUVpeak) of both tracers (p < 0.05, one tailed t test). All of the PET analyses performed demonstrated better discriminatory power (AUCROC range = 0.71-0.86) than tumor size alone (AUCROC = 0.61). The use of standard resolution scanner with standard reconstruction did not result in a notable deterioration of discrimination accuracy. CONCLUSION: NF2 related VS demonstrate uptake of both FLT and FDG, which is significantly increased in rapidly growing tumors. A short static FDG PET scan with standard clinical resolution and reconstruction can provide relevant information on tumor growth to aid clinical decision making.","Methods: Six NF2 patients with 11 VS (4 rapidly growing, 7 indolent), were scanned with FLT and FDG using a high-resolution research tomograph (HRRT, Siemens) and a Siemens Biograph TrueV PET-CT, with and without resolution modeling image reconstruction. Mean, maximum, and peak standardised uptake values (SUV) for each tumor were derived and the intertumor correlation between FDG and FLT uptake was compared. The ability of FDG and FLT SUV values to discriminate between rapidly growing and slow growing (indolent) tumors was assessed using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. METHODS Patients Patients were recruited via the nationally commissioned, specialized NF2 multidisciplinary team meeting in Manchester, UK. Adult patients (aged between 18 and 70 yr of age) with a confirmed diagnosis of NF2 and at least one vestibular schwannoma (VS) were recruited. Exclusion criteria included: female patients pregnant or intending to become pregnant; patients who had undergone previous radiotherapy or antiangiogenic treatment; and patients with contra-indications to MRI. All patients gave informed written consent. The study was approved by an independent research ethics committee (REC 13/NW/0260) and by the United Kingdom Administration of Radioactive Substances Advisory Committee (ARSAC RPC 595/3586/30119). All patients had undergone previous routine clinical assessment including MRI at 6 to 12 month intervals and the median length of follow-up across all patients was 1.52 years (range = 0.60–7.30 yr). The study MRI scan was reviewed in addition to the results of previous clinical MR imaging by the multidisciplinary team and tumors were classified as either rapidly growing or indolent. This classification reflected clinical decision making in these patients with tumors being classified as indolent undergoing further radiological surveillance and rapidly growing tumors being considered for either surgical resection or treatment with the antiangiogenic agent bevacuzimab (Avastin). To confirm the differential growth pattern across these two cohorts, volumetric measurements of tumor size were made for the preceding clinical scan, the study MR scan, and a follow-up scan 1 year later (see Table  1 ). Volumetric measurements were made on T 1 -weighted (T1W) postcontrast imaging using the semiautomatic segmentation tool within the Brainlab iPlan software (Brainlab AG Germany) and the results of segmentation were reviewed and, where necessary, edited by an experienced neuroradiologist (I.D.).

PET Data Acquisition Patients were scanned using FDG and FLT on two separate occasions, less than a week apart. For both tracers 200 MBq was the target injected activity. Patients were scanned using both a conventional PET-CT scanner, the Truepoint TrueV Biograph PET-CT scanner (Siemens), with a spatial resolution of approximately 4.5 mm full width at half maximum ( 30 ); and with a brain dedicated scanner the (HRRT, Siemens) with spatial resolution of approximately 2.5 mm full width at half maximum ( 29 ). For each radiotracer, the scan sequence followed a 60-gap-30-gap-30 minute structure with alternated order of scanners, i.e., three scans for each radiotracer injection alternating between the PET-CT and the HRRT (with sequence shown in supplementary Figure 1C). Patients were placed on one of the two scanners (with the initial scanner altering between patients), injected with the radiotracer, and data acquired for 60 minutes (scan 1). Following a short break of between 10 and 20 minutes, patients were placed on the other scanner, with data acquired for 30 minutes (scan 2). Finally, following a second short break the patient was placed on the original scanner with data acquired for a further 30 minutes (scan 3). This scan sequence was devised to allow assessment of tracer uptake during scan 2 at approximately 75 minutes postinjection on both scanners, either from direct measurement or from linear interpolation of data from scans 1 and 3 (radioactivity concentrations on the VS followed an approximately linear relationship during this period for both tracers). For attenuation correction, a 6-minute transmission scan was acquired when using the HRRT (preinjection for scan 1 and postemission acquisition for scans 2 and 3) and a pre-emission CT scan when using the TrueV PET/CT scanner. Image Reconstruction Data from both scanners were reconstructed using implementations of three-dimensional iterative Ordinary Poisson Ordered Subset Expectation Maximisation ( 31 ) without (No-RM) and with resolution modeling (RM), reconstructing the data during the last 30 minutes of scan 1 and the data for scans 2 and 3, each into three 10 minute frames. For the TrueV scanner, the Siemens offline reconstruction package “ e7_tools”  was used with an image zoom of two resulting in images with a voxel size of 1.33 mm × 1.33 mm × 2.03 mm and an image grid dimension of 256 × 256 × 107 voxels. HRRT data was reconstructed using HRRT user community software generating images consisting of 256 × 256 × 207 voxels each of size 1.22 mm × 1.22 mm × 1.22 mm. In both cases, 10 and 12 iterations for No-RM and for RM respectively were conducted using 16 subsets for HRRT and 21 for the TrueV. RM reconstruction is referred to as HD for the TrueV PET ( 32 ) while for the HRRT user community software was used ( 33 ). The iterations and subsets selected reflect our standard image reconstruction protocols. Postreconstruction smoothing using Gaussian filters, which can be used to reduce image noise, was not performed since it could worsen image resolution, which was considered to be critical for this clinical application. Reconstructions for both scanners were performed with full corrections including scatter and attenuation. In the case of HRRT, attenuation correction was calculated from a reconstructed and segmented μ-map image using the total variation TXTV method ( 34 ). To minimize the effects of patient motion particularly the deterioration of image resolution, image-based motion correction using frame-by-frame realignment for each 10 minute frame was used for both scanners ( 35 ). Delineation of Tumor VOI for PET Quantification Tumor volumes of interest (VOI) for PET analysis were manually drawn on contrast enhanced T1W MR images (voxel size 0.9 mm × 0.9 mm × 0.8 mm), acquired as part of the study MRI. Regions were drawn to the edge of the enhancing tumor (care was taken when delineating the tumor to avoid partial volume effects from nearby structures or surrounding CSF) and subsequently were modestly eroded using a single iteration and a 3 × 3 × 1 erosion kernel. All manual outlining was done using Analyze version 11 and was performed under the supervision of AJ and ID, consultant neuroradiologists with over 40 years of combined experience. The study MRI was acquired on the same day as one of the PET scans for all the patients and therefore within 1 week of both PET scans. Using SPM 8 ( http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm ), contrast enhanced T1W MRIs were coregistered to the 30 minutes motion corrected PET images from each of the three scans, and the manually drawn VOIs were re-sliced to PET space using the rigid body transformations calculated from this coregistration and nearest-neighbor interpolation. PET quantification was performed using the standardized uptake value (SUV), whereby the radiotracer concentration at 75 minutes posttracer injection within each voxel was normalized by the injected radioactivity dose and patient weight ( 36 ). The tumor VOIs were then applied to the PET data to calculate SUV mean  (reflecting the overall regional tracer distribution), SUV max  (max value of the tracer distribution), and SUV peak  within each tumor. The latter is considered to be less sensitive to the VOI boundary and the uptake distribution ( 37 ). Statistical Analysis SPSS version 23 was used for all statistical analyses. The normality and homogeneity of variance for derived values was assessed using the Shapiro–Wilk and Levene test respectively. Intergroup differences in growth rate, SUV mean , SUV max , and SUV peak  between indolent and growing tumors were compared using a Student's  t  test. Linear regression analysis was undertaken to assess intertumor relationship between standardized uptake values for both FDG and FLT using each scanner with and without RM. Finally, the ability of each tracer to classify VS as rapidly growing was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve for each SUV parameter, using the multidisciplinary defined growth classification as the truth.",Jose M Anton-Rodriguez; Daniel Lewis; Ibrahim Djoukhadar; David Russell; Peter Julyan; David Coope; Andrew T King; Simon K L Lloyd; D Gareth Evans; Alan Jackson; Julian C Matthews,"Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology",2019-07,10.1097/MAO.0000000000002272,minimal,True
PMID:23457304,Platelet-derived growth factor-BB activates calcium/calmodulin-dependent and -independent mechanisms that mediate Akt phosphorylation in the neurofibromin-deficient human Schwann cell line ST88-14.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1-derived Schwann cells isolated from malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) overexpress PDGF receptor-β and generate an aberrant intracellular calcium increase in response to PDGF-BB. Using the human MPNST Schwann cell line ST88-14, we demonstrate that, in addition to a transient phosphorylation of Akt, PDGF-BB stimulation produces an atypical sustained phosphorylation of Akt that is dependent on calcium and calmodulin (CaM). The sustained Akt phosphorylation did not occur in PDGF-BB-stimulated normal human Schwann cells or ST88-14 cells stimulated with stem cell factor, whose receptor is also overexpressed in ST88-14 cells. The sustained Akt phosphorylation induced by PDGF-BB was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with either the intracellular calcium chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl) ester (BAPTA-AM) or the CaM antagonist W7, whereas the transient portion was not inhibited. Akt also co-immunoprecipitated with CaM in a PDGF-BB-dependent manner, suggesting that direct interaction between Akt and CaM is involved in the sustained phosphorylation of Akt. Furthermore, we provide evidence that anti-apoptotic effects of PDGF-BB on serum-deprived ST88-14 cells can be inhibited by W7, implicating the PDGF-BB-induced activation of calcium/CaM in promoting cell survival, presumably through sustained Akt activation. We conclude that the activation of the calcium/CaM/Akt pathway resulting from stimulation of overexpressed PDGF receptor-β may contribute to the survival and tumorigenicity of MPNST cells.",,Robert G Farrer; Jason R Farrer; George H DeVries,The Journal of biological chemistry,2013-04-19,10.1074/jbc.M112.442244,abstract_only,False
PMID:33413690,Human cutaneous neurofibroma matrisome revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing.,"Neurofibromatosis Type I (NF1) is a neurocutaneous genetic syndrome characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, including benign peripheral nerve sheath tumor called neurofibroma. These tumors originate from the Schwann cell lineage but other cell types as well as extracellular matrix (ECM) in the neurofibroma microenvironment constitute the majority of the tumor mass. In fact, collagen accounts for up to 50% of the neurofibroma's dry weight. Although the presence of collagens in neurofibroma is indisputable, the exact repertoire of ECM genes and ECM-associated genes (i.e. the matrisome) and their functions are unknown. Here, transcriptome profiling by single-cell RNA sequencing reveals the matrisome of human cutaneous neurofibroma (cNF). We discovered that classic pro-fibrogenic collagen I myofibroblasts are rare in neurofibroma. In contrast, collagen VI, a pro-tumorigenic ECM, is abundant and mainly secreted by neurofibroma fibroblasts. This study also identified potential cell type-specific markers to further elucidate the biology of the cNF microenvironment.","Methods qPCR Gene expression was determined as previously described [ 44 ]. Briefly, RNA extraction was performed using the TRIzol reagent, reverse transcription was performed using iScript Select cDNA synthesis kit, and qPCR was performed on a Bio-Rad FX96 apparatus using Bio-Rad iSCRIPT master mix and the following qPCR primers:  COL1A1  (fwd: GCGAGAGCATGACCGATGGA, rev: GGTCAGCTGGATGGCCACAT);  COL1A2  (fwd: CTGGTCGTGATGGCAACCCT, rev: TAACCGCGCTCTCCCTTGTG);  COL3A1  ( fwd: AATGGTGCTCCTGGACTGCG, rev: ATACCAGCCTCACCGCGTTC);  CTGF  (fwd: ACCTGTGCCTGCCATTACAA, rev: GCTTCATGCCATGTCTCCGT);  FN1 -EDA (fwd: ACTATTGAAGGCTTGCAGCCCA, rev: TGCAGCTCTGCAGTGTCTTCTT);  LOX  (fwd: CTTGCACGTTTCCAATCGCA, rev: GTTACACAAGCCGTTCTGGC);  LOXL2  (fwd: CCAGTGTGGTCTGCAGAGAG, rev: CTCGTTGAGGTGGATGGGTC) and normalized with  GAPDH  (fwd: AGGGCTGCTTTTAACTCTGGT, rev: CCCCACTTGATTTT GGAGGGA). Histological characterization Tissues were processed as described in [ 44 ]. Briefly, tissues were fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 um, and mounted on glass slides. Histochemical staining was performed as described in [ 44 ]. Briefly, tissue slides were deparaffinized, progressively rehydrated, and stained with hematoxylin (2 min) followed by high definition (10 s), bluing agent (10 s), and eosin (H&E staining) or a solution of Sirius Red (0.5 g of Direct Red80 dissolved in 500 mL of saturated picric acid) for 1 h (collagen staining). Finally, tissue slides were progressively dehydrated and coverslipped. Immunohistochemistry was performed as described in [ 44 ]. Briefly, tissue slides were blocked, incubated with primary antibodies [rabbit anti-SMA (Novus, NB600-531); rabbit anti-COL11A1 (ThermoScientific; PA5-68410); rabbit anti-FAP (Abcam; ab53066); rabbit anti-collagen VI (Abcam; ab6588)] diluted in 3% donkey serum (16 h, 4 °C), rinsed in PBS, incubated with secondary antibodies coupled to biotin and diluted in 3% donkey serum (1 h). They were then rinsed again in PBS, incubated with a premixture of avidin and biotin (following Vecta Stain Elite ABC kit procedure) rinsed again in PBS, and visualized by adding the DAB substrate (following Vecta Stain Elite ABC kit procedure). Finally, reactions were quenched in distilled water, and tissue slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and coverslipped. A brown precipitate was deposited on positive cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing Based on the whole skin dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat. No. 130-101-540), human skin was harvested and immediately immersed in ice-cold DMEM (Gibco, 12634-010). Next, a 4 mm × 4 mm skin piece was placed into ice cold buffer L (435 uL) containing freshly added enzyme P (2.5 uL), enzyme D (10 uL) and enzyme A (0.5 uL). Next, the tube was incubated for 22 h at 37 °C and quenched with ice cold culture medium (500 uL). Next, the digested tissue was minced into 1 mm pieces, incubated 15 min on ice and shaken vigorously every 5 min. After 15 min, the tube was spun (2000 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C), the supernatant discarded, and the pellet resuspended in ice cold complete culture medium (1 mL). The cell suspension was filtered through a 40 um cell strainer, washed with ice cold complete medium (4 mL), and spun at 2000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet washed again using ice cold 0.04% BSA in PBS (1 mL). Finally, cell count and viability were assessed by hematocytometer (trypan blue). A freshly prepared single cell suspension of ~ 10,000 cells per sample was loaded into a 10X Genomics Chromium controller for transcript barcoding and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq sequencer. The expression data has been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and is accessible through GEP series accession number  GSE163028 . Cell Ranger version 3.0.0 (10× Genomics) was used to process the raw sequencing data. Briefly, raw BCL files were converted to FASTQ files and aligned to the human Grch38 reference transcriptome. Transcript counts of each cell were quantified using barcoded UMI and 10xBC sequences. The gene x cell expression matrices were loaded to the R package Seurat version 3.0.0 for downstream analyses. Cells with low quality were filtered out based on at least 200 genes being detected per 1000 UMIs and mitochondrial gene content. Only those genes found in more than three cells were retained. ""LogNormalize"" Seurat default global-scaling normalization method was performed. With the above filters in place, we obtained 19,734 genes from 17,132 cells from the three neurofibroma samples combined and 15,607 genes from 2563 cells from the normal skin samples [ 30 ] combined. The highly variable features (genes) for this data were then calculated with “FindVariableFeatures"" in Seurat, which uses a mean variability plot. The average expression and dispersion per feature are calculated, and features are divided into bins to get z-scores for dispersion per bin. After regressing out the number of UMI and percentage of mitochondrial gene content, the resultant data was scaled, and the dimensional reduction was performed with principal component analysis and visualization using UMAP plots. The QC results can be found in the Additional file  1 : Figures S4, S5 and S6. The number of principal components (n = 10) to use in the downstream analysis was calculated based on a Jackstraw and elbow plot of the same. For each sample, a Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN) Graph was constructed with “FindNeighbors” in Seurat by determining the k-nearest neighbors of each cell. The clusters were then identified by optimizing this SNN modularity using the “FindClusters"" function. This allowed for sensitive detection of rare cell types. We obtained five clusters for each sample with a resolution of 0.3. Due to the variability in the cell numbers obtained from the samples, we randomly subsampled 1000 cells per sample to avoid sample cell number bias in visualization and explored the UMAP figures for the cell types. We verified the same for the original dataset (Additional file  1 : Figure S1). The differential expression for any of the six clusters over the remaining five was carried out using Wilcoxon Rank Sum test in Seurat [ 45 ]. The genes identified as relatively overexpressed in a cluster as compared to all other cells in a sample were termed “markers”. Taking these markers and their functional categories into consideration, these six clusters were identified as six cell types (Fibroblasts, Endothelial cells, Schwann cells, Pericytes, APCs, and Hematopoietic cells). The conserved markers per cell type were also identified using the FindConservedMarkers function from Seurat, which shows genes that are consistently overexpressed in a cell type compared to other cell types across all three samples. To analyze the clusters and cell types in all the tumor samples, they were combined using the method described by Stuart et al. [ 46 ]. Canonical correlation analysis was applied to identify correspondences between samples and create a standard reference. To carry out further studies in fibroblasts, we selected only the fibroblast cells from the combined tumor data, randomly subsampled to match the total number of cells from the normal skin sample and compared them against the normal skin sample using the above method [ 46 ]. Human tissues Human subjects and all sample collection (normal skin, cNF at globular stage and normal margin, keloids) and use were approved by the Institutional Review Board at The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and conformed to NIH guidelines.

PMID:30381327,Identification of a Specific Translational Machinery via TCTP-EF1A2 Interaction Regulating NF1-associated Tumor Growth by Affinity Purification and Data-independent Mass Spectrometry Acquisition (AP-DIA).,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disease that predisposes individuals to developing benign neurofibromas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). The mechanism of NF1-tumorigenesis or the curatives have not been established. Using unique trascriptome and proteome integration method, iPEACH (1), we previously identified translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) as a novel biological target for NF1-associated tumors (2). Here, we identified specific TCTP-interacting proteins by sequential affinity purification and data-independent mass spectrometry acquisition (AP-DIA/SWATH) to investigate the role of TCTP in NF1-associated malignant tumors. TCTP mainly interacts with proteins related to protein synthesis and especially to elongation factor complex components, including EF1A2, EF1B, EF1D, EF1G, and valyl-tRNA synthetase (VARS), in NF1-deficient malignant tumor cells. Interestingly, TCTP preferentially binds to EF1A2 (normally found only in neural and skeletal-muscle cells and several cancer cells), rather than EF1A1 despite the high homologies (98%) in their sequences. The docking simulation and further validations to study the interaction between TCTP and EF1A2 revealed that TCTP directly binds with EF1A2 via the contact areas of EF1A2 dimerization. Using unique and common sequences between EF1A2 and EF1A1 in AP-DIA/SWATH, we quantitatively validated the interaction of EF1A2 and TCTP/other elongation factors and found that TCTP coordinates the translational machinery of elongation factors via the association with EF1A2. These data suggest that TCTP activates EF1A2-dependent translation by mediating complex formation with other elongation factors. Inhibiting the TCTP-EF1A2 interaction with EF1A2 siRNAs or a TCTP inhibitor, artesunate, significantly down-regulated the factors related to protein translation and caused dramatic suppression of growth/translation in NF1-associated tumors. Our findings demonstrate that a specific protein translation machinery related to the TCTP-EF1A2 interaction is functionally implicated in the tumorigenesis and progression of NF1-associated tumors and could represent a therapeutic target.",,Daiki Kobayashi; Takaho Tokuda; Kyosuke Sato; Hiroki Okanishi; Megumi Nagayama; Mio Hirayama-Kurogi; Sumio Ohtsuki; Norie Araki,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,2019-02,10.1074/mcp.RA118.001014,abstract_only,False

Methods Recruitment and participants We distributed advertisements to people with NF via email listservs through the NF registry within the Children’s Tumor Foundation and through other NF centers worldwide. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) diagnoses of NF1, NF2, or schwannomatosis by a medical professional, (2) age 18 years or older, (3) able to provide informed consent and comply with study procedures, (4) English literacy equivalent to a 6th-grade reading level or above, (5) self-reported stress and difficulties coping with NF symptoms; (6) score of 6 or higher on the Patient Stress Scale-4 items [ 25 ,  26 ]. Exclusion criteria were: (1) severe psychopathologies such as schizophrenia or active substance use that would interfere with study procedures or (2) unwillingness or inability to participate in virtual group sessions. We enrolled participants between October 2017 and January 2021. We conducted groups in a sequence of 2, one intervention and one control. We collected the last follow-up outcome assessment in February 2022. All enrolled participants completed assessment measures at baseline, post-intervention, and at 6- and 12-month follow-up via REDCap [ 27 ], a secure online data collection and management system. A research assistant was available via email to answer any questions. At each timepoint we sent the assessment measures up to three times to each participant and followed up with a phone call if needed. After these attempts, we considered unresponsive participants as lost to follow-up. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Participants provided written informed consent for all procedures and did not receive compensation for participation. We advertised the study as a “Stress Management Program” to maintain the single-blind study design. Study staff met with study participants virtually to review consent procedures, inclusionary/exclusionary criteria, and the safety protocol. Measures Adaptive coping We used the Measure of Current Status-A (MOCS-A) to measure adaptive coping [ 28 ]. It is comprised of 13 items with four subscales: relaxation – the ability to employ relaxation on command; awareness of tension – the ability to recognize tension and stressful triggers; assertiveness – the ability to express needs to others; and coping confidence – the ability to cope confidently and restructure unhelpful thoughts. Items are rated on a scale from 0 (“I cannot do this at all”) to 4 (“I can do this extremely well”) and averaged to create a total score (range: 0–4). Higher scores represent greater proficiency in adaptive coping abilities. Mindfulness We used the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised (CAMS-R) to measure dispositional mindfulness (i.e., inclination to act mindfully) [ 29 ]. It is comprised of 12-items rated on a scale from 1 (“rarely/not at all”) to 4 (“almost always”) and summed to create a total score (range 12–48). Higher scores indicate greater dispositional mindfulness. Gratitude We used the Gratitude Questionnaire (GQ-6) to measure gratitude in daily life [ 30 ]. It is a 6-item measure rated on a scale from 1 (“strongly disagree”) to 7 (“strongly agree”). Items are summed to create a total score with higher scores representing greater dispositional gratitude (range: 6–42). Optimism We used the Life Orientation Test Optimism Scale (LOT) to measure optimism [ 31 ]. It is an 8-item measure rated on a scale from 0 (“I disagree a lot”) to 4 (“I agree a lot”). Items are summed to generate a total score with higher scores representing greater optimism (range: 0–32). Perceived social support We used the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey (MOS) to measure perceived availability of social support [ 32 ]. It is a 19-item measure with four domains: perceived availability of emotional, tangible, affectionate, and positive social interactions. Items are rated on a scale from 1 (“none of the time”) to 5 (“all of the time”) and averaged to create a total score, with higher scores representing greater perceived social support (range: 1–5). Intervention and control conditions Both 3RP-NF and HEP-NF have been described in detail [ 33 ]. Briefly, both conditions consisted of 8 weekly 90-minute group sessions. Three clinical psychology trainees delivered program content with supervision from the clinical psychologist who developed 3RP-NF and HEP-NF [ 33 ]. Fidelity to intervention and control were high. Participants in both conditions received a printed or electronic version of a patient manual designed for 6th-grade comprehension level to accommodate learning disabilities and other cognitive difficulties associated with NF. Participants in the 3RP-NF also received a link to pre-recorded practice exercises. 3RP-NF The 3RP-NF program is a comprehensive, multimodal treatment aimed at improving QoL and resilience with NF-specific medical symptoms and NF-related stress. It was adapted from the original 3RP [ 34 ]. The foundation for 3RP-NF is the elicitation of the relaxation response (RR), a state of calm and heightened awareness associated with positive changes in genomic, structural, physiologic, psychological, and functional outcomes [ 35 - 42 ]. 3RP-NF combines elicitation of the RR with evidence-based findings on NF-related stress and symptom management, cognitive behavioral theory, and positive psychology. The three core components of 3RP-NF include: (1) “Relaxation Response-Elicitation,” which teaches 15 relaxation and mindfulness techniques; (2) “Appraisal and Coping,” which teaches adaptive coping skills to manage stress and medical symptoms such as pain, appearance concerns, the uncertainty of NF, and disease burden; and (3) “Growth Enhancement,” which includes the use of acceptance, problem-solving and positive psychology skills (e.g., gratitude, empathic communication) aimed at fostering adaptation amidst new symptom development and uncertainty of prognosis (i.e., resilience). Each session starts with an RR exercise, followed by a review of previously taught skills, an introduction of a new skill, and ends with a short RR exercise. The final session reviewed all skills with an emphasis on continuing skill practice after the end of the program. Attention control The HEP-NF program was adapted from the original HEP [ 43 ] and NF-specific materials gathered from the Children’s Tumor Foundation website. The program provides educational information on NF-related stress and symptoms, sleep, nutrition, exercise, communication, and health care management. Each session included a review of the previous sessions. The last session also included information on ways to maintain positive changes to health made during the program. Randomization Study staff randomized patients according to a 1:1 ratio within blocks of 12; 6 to 3RP-NF and 6 to HEP-NF, stratified by NF type. Participants were blind as to whether they received the intervention or control. Data analytic strategy We conducted the analysis using SAS version 9.8. Following the intention-to-treat principle, we included all randomized participants in our primary efficacy analyses as randomized. To investigate treatment effects on resilience outcomes, we used a linear mixed model with completely unstructured covariance across up to four repeated measurements (baseline, post-intervention, and 6- and 12-month follow-up). The mixed model considers all available data, including information from participants who did not complete their evaluations and those who were lost to follow-up. Missing data is implicitly imputed by the estimated covariance among repeated measurements. As a result, the model generates unbiased estimates because missing information is predictable from observed assessments. We estimated treatment-dependent differences between 3RP-NF and HEP-NF in changes from baseline to posttreatment (approximately 2 months) and 6- and 12-month follow-up times. We tested these estimations using linear contrasts of least-square means and reported the point estimates with unadjusted 95% confidence intervals (Cis) for MOCS-A, CAMS-R, GQ-6, LOT, and MOS total scores. For the MOCS-A, we also conducted post-hoc tests to examine the above linear contrasts for each of the 4 subscales of relaxation, awareness of tension, assertiveness, and coping confidence. We used a false discovery rate approach to account for Type I error given the number of hypotheses tested in this study [ 44 ].",Alexander M Presciutti; Ethan G Lester; Emily C Woodworth; Jonathan Greenberg; Jafar Bakhshaie; Julia E Hooker; Katherine A McDermott; Ana-Maria Vranceanu,Journal of neuro-oncology,2023-07,10.1007/s11060-023-04389-1,minimal,True
PMID:30713041,Reprogramming Captures the Genetic and Tumorigenic Properties of Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Plexiform Neurofibromas.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a tumor predisposition genetic disease caused by mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene. Plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) are benign Schwann cell (SC) tumors of the peripheral nerve sheath that develop through NF1 inactivation and can progress toward a malignant soft tissue sarcoma. There is a lack of non-perishable model systems to investigate PNF development. We reprogrammed PNF-derived NF1(-/-) cells, descendants from the tumor originating cell. These NF1(-/-)-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) captured the genomic status of PNFs and were able to differentiate toward neural crest stem cells and further to SCs. iPSC-derived NF1(-/-) SCs exhibited a continuous high proliferation rate, poor myelination ability, and a tendency to form 3D spheres that expressed the same markers as their PNF-derived primary SC counterparts. They represent a valuable model to study and treat PNFs. PNF-derived iPSC lines were banked for making them available.","Experimental Procedures Patients, Plexiform Neurofibromas, and Tumor Processing Tumor samples were kindly provided by NF1 patients after giving written informed consent for iPSC generation and genomic analysis studies. The study was approved by our Institutional Review Board and local ethical commitees. The patients were diagnosed according to standard diagnostic criteria ( DeBella et al., 2000 ). Tumor specimens were obtained after surgery of five PNFs from five independent patients (two males, three females; ages 8–66 years). Immediately after excision, tumor samples were placed in DMEM medium (Gibco) containing 10% FBS (Gibco) + 1× Glx (Gibco) + 1× normocin antibiotic cocktail (InvivoGene), and shipped at room temperature to our laboratory. Tumors were processed as follows: surrounding fat tissue and skin were removed and tumors were cut into 1-mm pieces and cryopreserved in 10% DMSO (Sigma) + 90% FBS until used. PNF-Derived SCs and Fibroblasts Cultures PNF-derived SCs and fibroblasts were isolated as described previously ( Serra et al., 2000 ). In brief, PNF pieces that were preserved in liquid nitrogen were thawed and digested with 160 U/mL collagenase type 1 and 0.8 U/mL dispase (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) for 16 h at 37°C. Dissociated cells were washed and seeded onto 0.1 mg/mL poly-L-lysine (Sigma) and 4 μg/mL laminin (Gibco)-coated dishes in Schwann cell medium (SCM) and maintained at 37°C under a 10% CO 2  atmosphere. SCM is DMEM (Gibco) with 10% FBS, 500 U/mL penicillin/500 μg/mL streptomycin (Gibco), 0.5 mM 3-iso-butyl-1-methilxantine (Sigma), 2.5 mg/mL insulin (Sigma), 10 nM heregulin-β1 (PeproTech), and 0.5 μM forskolin (Sigma). One day after plating, culture medium was replaced by SCM without forskolin for an additional 2–3 days. This process was repeated in cycles and cells were passaged as needed with trypsin 0.05% (Gibco). SC purity was assessed by performing S100β staining as described previously ( Serra et al., 2000 ). To isolate fibroblasts, dissociated cells were plated in DMEM 10% FBS media and passaged when necessary. Reprogramming of SCs, Fibroblasts, and Digested Tumors Between 1 × 10 4  and 2 × 10 4  cells were reprogrammed through the retroviral delivery of human cDNA coding for OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and cMYC transcription factors as described previously ( Raya et al., 2009 ). For non-integrative reprogramming, a Cytotune-iPS 2.0 Sendai Reprogramming Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. Approximately 3 or 4 weeks after transduction, colonies displaying embryonic stem cell-like morphology and behavior were selected for further characterization and genotyping. iPSC established lines were grown on dishes coated with growth factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) in mTESR1 medium (STEMCELL Technologies). See  Supplemental Information  for a detailed description of iPSC characterization. Differentiation toward NCs and SCs Neural crest differentiation was performed as described by  Menendez et al. (2013)  with some modifications. In brief, 9 × 10 4  cells/cm 2  were plated onto Matrigel-coated plates in mTESR medium. The following day, the medium was replaced with hESC maintenance medium: DMEM:F12 (Gibco) 1:1; 5 mg/mL BSA (Sigma); 500 U/mL penicillin/500 μg/mL streptomycin (Gibco); 2 mM GlutaMAX (Gibco); 1× MEM non-essential amino acids (Gibco); 1× trace elements A; 1× trace elements B; 1× trace elements C (Corning); 2-mercaptoethanol (Gibco); 10 μg/mL transferrin (Sigma); 50 μg/mL sodium L-ascorbate (Sigma); 10 ng/mL heregulin-β1 (PeproTech); 10 ng/mL activin A (PeproTech); 200 μg/mL LONG R3 IGFR (PeproTech); 8 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor 2 (PeproTech). Next day, the medium was replaced with neural crest induction/differentiation medium: hESC medium without activin and supplemented with 2 μM CHIR9902 (STEMCELL Technologies) and 20 μM SB432542 (STEMCELL Technologies), and was replaced every day. NCs were maintained in this medium and split with Accutase (Thermo Fischer Scientific) when necessary. For SC differentiation NCs were plated onto 0.1 mg/mL poly-L-lysine (Sigma) and 4 μg/mL laminin (Gibco)-coated plates and cultured in SC differentiation medium: DMEM:F12 (3:1); 500 U/ml penicillin/500 μg/mL streptomycin antibiotics (Gibco); 5 μM forskolin (Sigma); 50 ng/mL heregulin-β1; 2% N2 supplement (Gibco); 1% FBS (Gibco). The medium was replaced twice a week. Additional Experimental Procedures Additional experimental procedures can be found in  Supplemental Information .

PMID:25433207,Nf2-Yap signaling controls the expansion of DRG progenitors and glia during DRG development.,"Molecular mechanisms governing the maintenance and proliferation of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) progenitors are largely unknown. Here we reveal that the Hippo pathway regulates the expansion of DRG progenitors and glia during mammalian DRG development. The key effectors of this pathway, transcriptional coactivators Yap and Taz, are expressed in DRG progenitors and glia during DRG development but are at least partially inhibited from activating transcription. Aberrant YAP activation leads to overexpansion of DRG progenitor and glial populations. We further show that the Neurofibromatosis 2 (Nf2) tumor suppressor inhibits Yap during DRG development. Loss of Nf2 leads to similar phenotypes as does YAP hyperactivation, and deleting Yap suppresses these phenotypes. Our study demonstrates that Nf2-Yap signaling plays important roles in controlling the expansion of DRG progenitors and glia during DRG development.","MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines set by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital (SJCRH). The  TetO-YAP  line ( Camargo et al., 2007 ) was provided by Thijn R. Brummelkamp and Fernando D. Camargo (Children’s Hospital, Boston, MA).  Sox10-rtTA  line ( Ludwig et al., 2004 ) was a gift from Michael Wegner (Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Erlangen, Germany).  Wnt1-Cre  (Stock No: 007807) and  Axin2-rtTA  (Stock No: 016997) lines were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. The  Yap  line ( Flox/Flox Xin et al., 2011 ) was provided by Eric N. Olson (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). The  Nf2  line has been described previously ( Flox/Flox Giovannini et al., 2000 ). An  Nf2  allele was generated by breeding  Δ Nf2  mice with the  Flox/Flox Ella-Cre  line (Stock No: 003724, Jackson Laboratory). As both  Nf2  and  Wnt1-Cre  are on Chromosome 11, a recombined allele,  Nf2 , was generated by extensive breeding. For BrdU pulse-labeling, timed pregnant mice were given intraperitoneal injections of BrdU (10 mg/ml in 0.9% saline) at a dose of 100 mg/kg. Doxycycline was delivered in drinking water at 500 mg/L at the time points indicated. Δ;Wnt1-Cre Histology and immunostaining Embryos younger than E15.5 were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight at 4°C. Embryos at E15.5 or older were intracardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde and post-fixed overnight at 4°C. Samples were embedded in OCT and sectioned at 16-μm thickness. Immunostainings were performed according to standard protocols. Primary antibodies were as follows: Blbp (Millipore, ABN14; rabbit, 1:500), BrdU (Abcam, ab6326; rat, 1:100), Isl1/2 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Clone # 39.4D5; mouse, 1:500), Ki67 (Vector Laboratories, VP-RM04; rabbit, 1:250), Nf2 (Sigma, HPA003097; rabbit, 1:1000 and amplification with Invitrogen TSA kit), p75 (Promega, G3231; rabbit, 1:2000), S100β (Sigma, S2532; mouse, 1:100 and amplification with Invitrogen TSA kit), Sox10 (Santa Cruz, sc-17342; goat, 1:250), TrkA (provided by Louis Reichardt, University of California, San Francisco, CA; rabbit, 1:1000), Tuj1 (Covance, MMS-435P; mouse, 1:1000), Yap/Taz (Cell Signaling, 8418; rabbit, 1:200 and amplification with Invitrogen TSA kit), and pYap (Cell Signaling, 4911; rabbit, 1:200). Secondary antibodies were from Invitrogen and Jackson ImmunoResearch. Fluorescent images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 510 or 780 confocal microscope. Western blot analysis DRG were dissected from E13.5 embryos. Total DRG lysates were prepared in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 2% SDS, and 5% glycerol supplemented with the Halt protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific). The following primary antibodies were used: Nf2 (Sigma, HPA003097; rabbit, 1:1,000) and GAPDH (Sigma, G8795, mouse; 1:10,000). In situ  hybridization In situ  hybridization was performed as described ( Schaeren-Wiemers and Gerfin-Moser, 1993 ).  Ngn1  probe was provided by Andy Groves (Baylor College of Medicine Houston, TX) ( Raft et al., 2007 ).  Ngn2  and  TrkB  probes were provided by Qiufu Ma (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) ( Ma et al., 1999 ). A probe specific for the TrkC tyrosine kinase domain was designed based on  Fagan et al., 1996 . Total RNA was extracted from E13.5 wild-type mouse brain using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed by using the SuperScript III cDNA kit (Invitrogen). A 738 bp-long cDNA fragment encoding a portion of the kinase domain was amplified using forward primer CATCAAGAGGAGA GATATC GTGTTGAAGAG and reverse primer GGTCTCT TCTAGA CACGGCC, where underlined sequences show the restriction enzyme sites integrated into the fragment by PCR (EcoRV and XbaI, respectively). The fragment was cloned into pBluescript plasmid at EcoRV and XbaI sites. Antisense probe was generated by linearizing the vector with EcoRV and transcribing with T3 RNA polymerase. Images were acquired with a Zeiss Axio Imager M2 microscope equipped with a Zeiss AxioCam MRc camera. Quantification and statistical analysis Cell counting was performed using the ImageJ software. Three embryos for each genotype were quantified. Quantifications were performed on sections at similar rostrocaudal levels. Absolute numbers shown in bar graphs are mean number of cells per section. All values shown are mean ± s.e.m.

PMID:40587782,"A transcriptomic, proteomic, and functional genetic atlas dissects neurofibromin function in the peripheral nervous system.",The ,"Materials and Methods CRISPRi Cell Line Generation. Lentivirus containing pMH0001 (UCOE-SFFV-dCas9-BFP-KRAB, #85969, Addgene) was produced from transfected HEK293T cells with packaging vectors (pMD2.G #12259, Addgene, and pCMV-dR8.91, Trono Lab) following the manufacturer’s protocol (#MIR6605, Mirus) as previously reported ( 6 ). IPN cells were stably transduced to generate parental iPN dCas9-KRAB-BFP  cells and selected by flow cytometry using a SH800 sorter (Sony). Subsequent gene-specific knockdowns were achieved by individually cloning single-guide RNA protospacer sequences into the pCRISPRia-v2 vector (#84832, Addgene) between BstXI and BlpI restriction sites. All constructs were validated by Sanger sequencing of the protospacer region. The following protospacers were used: sgNTC (GTGCACCCGGCTAGGACCGG), sg NF1 -1 (GGGATCCTTTCCACGGCCCG), sg NF1 -2 (GGTGGGGAGACGGCGCTAGT), sg PTPN11 -1 (GGAGGAACATGACATCGCGG), sg PTPN11 -2 (GGCAAGGAGCGGGTCCGTCG), sg SOS2 -1 (GCCAGCGCCGCCGGGAAAGG), sg SOS2 -2 (GCACAGGGCTCGAGTCCCCG). Lentivirus was generated as described above, and cells were selected to purity using 1 μg/mL puromycin for at least 5 d. Cell Culture, Cell Viability Assays, and In Vitro Pharmacology. Patient-derived iPN, neurofibroma (NF95.11b), or human MPNST (JH002-2, ST88-14) cell lines were obtained from the Neurofibromatosis Therapeutic Acceleration Program or American Type Culture Collection. Mouse MPNST cell lines (JW18.2, JW23.3) were a gift from Angie Hirbe (Washington University in St. Louis, MO). Cell lines were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (#11960069, Life Technologies) with 10% FBS and 1× Pen-Strep (#15140122, Life Technologies) as previously reported ( 6 ). Cell lines were regularly tested and verified to be  Mycoplasma  negative (#LT07-218, Lonza). Viability assays were carried out with the CellTiter 96 Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (#G410, Promega) and a Glomax Discovery Multimode Microplate Reader (Promega). For pharmacologic assays, cells were seeded at a density of 5,000 cells per well in a 96-well plate the night prior to treatment, after which cells were treated with drugs at the indicated concentrations for the indicated periods (or 48 h if not otherwise indicated) prior to experimentation. Nucleic Acid Extraction for Bulk RNA Sequencing. RNA were isolated from cell using the All-Prep Universal Kit (#80224, QIAGEN). QiaCubes were used for standardized automated nucleic acid extraction as per the manufacturer’s protocol as previously reported ( 6 ). For cell line samples, pellets were directly lysed in RLT Plus buffer with beta-mercaptoethanol. RNA quality was assessed by chip-based electrophoresis on a BioAnalyzer 2100 using the RNA 6000 Nano Kit (#5067-1511, Agilent Technologies), and clean-up was performed as needed using the RNeasy kit (QIAGEN). Only samples with high-quality and/or RNA (RIN > 8) were used for bulk RNA sequencing. RNA Sequencing. Library preparation was performed using the TruSeq RNA Library Prep Kit v2 (#RS-122- 2001, Illumina), and 50 bp single end reads were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 or NovaSeq to a minimum depth of 25 M reads per sample at Medgenome, Inc. Quality control of FASTQ files was performed with FASTQC, and after trimming of adapter sequences, reads were filtered to remove bases that did not have an average quality score of 20 within a sliding window across four bases ( http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/ ) as previously reported ( 6 ). Reads were mapped to the appropriate reference genome (hg19) using HISAT2 with default parameters ( 32 ). Transcript abundance estimation in transcripts per million (TPM) and differential expression analysis were performed using DESeq2 ( 33 ). Differentially expressed transcripts with an adjusted  P -value < 0.1 were identified and filtered based on an expression cutoff (TPM > 1) and a fold change threshold (log 2 FC > 1) to prioritize biologically relevant gene sets. Clustering dendrograms and heatmaps were generated in R using TPM values and plotted as normalized row expression values with the heatmaps.2 function. Immunoblotting. Whole-cell lysates were harvested using radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Deoxycholate, 0.1% Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS), 1% IGEPAL CA-630) with fresh protease (#P8340, Sigma) and phosphatase inhibitor (#P2850, Sigma) cocktails as previously reported ( 6 ). To pull down GTP-bound RAS, supernatants from cleared lysates were incubated with recombinant GST-RAF1 RBD beads for 2 h at 4 °C followed by three washes with lysis buffer but without protease or phosphatase inhibitors. Beads and lysates were mixed with Nu polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (NuPAGE) LDS (ThermoFisher) sample buffer and heated at 70 °C for 10 min. A total of 10 to 20 μg of protein was loaded into precast NuPAGE electrophoresis gels (Life Technologies). Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene fluoride membranes, and blocked in either 5% bovine serum albumin or 5% skim milk in TBS buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at the indicated dilutions at 4 °C and horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h at room temperature followed by ECL based detection on film. The following antibodies were used: pERK (Cell Signaling Technologies, #4370, 1:1,000 dilution), total ERK (Cell Signaling Technologies, #4695, 1:1,000 dilution), pAKT (Cell Signaling Technologies, #4060, 1:1,000 dilution), total AKT (Cell Signaling Technologies, # 4685, 1:1,000 dilution), pMEK (Cell Signaling Technologies, #9121, 1:1,000 dilution), total MEK (Cell Signaling Technologies, #8727, 1:1,000 dilution), neurofibromin (Millipore, #3668175, 1:1000 dilution), SHP2 (Cell Signaling Technologies, #3397, 1:1,000 dilution), and SOS2 (Santa Cruz, sc-393667). Quantification was performed in ImageJ (NIH) using the relative densitometry between phosphorylated and total protein abundance from immunoblotting. qRTPCR. RNA was extracted from cell lines using the RNeasy Mini Kit (#74106, QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from RNA using iScript cDNA Synthesis kit (#1708891, Bio-Rad). Real-time QPCR was performed using PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix (#A25918, Thermo Fisher Scientific) on a QuantStudio 6 Flex Real Time PCR system (Life Technologies). The following QPCR primers were used: GAPDH-F (5′-GTCTCCTCTGACTTCAACAGCG-3′), GAPDH-R (5′-ACCACCCTGTTGCTGTAGCCAA-3′), NF1-F (5′-CGAATCATCACCAATTCCGCA-3′), NF1-R (5′-CCACAACCTTGCACTGCTTTAT-3′), PTPN11-F (5′-GAACTGTGCAGATCCTACCTCT-3′), PTPN11-R (5′-TCTGGCTCTCTCGTAC AAGAAA-3′), SOS2-F (5′- CCGCAGCCTTACGAGTTCTTC-3′), or SOS2-R (5′-GGATGCAC TTGTTCCTGAACC-3′). Posttranslational Modification Mass Spectrometry. Cells were washed 3× in ice-cold phosphate buffered saline, scraped and pelleted, and snap-frozen in dry ice until processing for mass spectrometry. To prepare peptides for phosphoenrichment, cell pellets were lysed in 8 M urea + 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate followed by reduction (5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) for 1 h at 37 °C), alkylation (10 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min at room temperature in the dark), and digestion overnight with mass spectrometry grade Trypsin (Promega, #V5111) and Lysyl Endopeptidase (Fujifilm Wako, #125-02543) at a ratio of 100:1 protein to enzyme. Digested peptides were applied to activated C18 columns, and columns were washed three times with 1mL of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Peptides were eluted with 600 µL of 50% Acetonitrile (ACN) and 0.25% formic acid (FA). Peptides were quantified using Pierce™ Quantitative Peptide Assay (ThermoFisher Scientific, #23275) and peptide amounts were normalized prior to lyophilization. Phosphoenrichment was performed on peptides using PTMScan® Phospho-Enrichment IMAC Fe-NTA Magnetic Beads (Cell Signaling Technology, #20432) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. Samples were resuspended in 0.1% FA and separated by reversed-phase chromatography using a Vanquish Neo high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a 15-cm PepSep column (150 µm inner diameter) packed with 1.5-µm Reprosil Saphir C18 particles (Bruker). Samples were acquired by data-dependent acquisition (DDA). Mobile phase A consisted of 0.1% FA in water and mobile phase B consisted of 80% ACN and 0.1% FA. Peptides were separated at a flow rate of 600 nL min −1  over the following 80-min gradient: 3 to 28% B in 67 min, 28 to 40% B in 5 min, and 8 min at 95% B. Eluting peptides were analyzed by an Orbitrap Exploris MS instrument (ThermoFisher Scientific). Data were collected in positive ion mode with MS1 resolution of 120,000, 350 to 1,250 m/z scan range, auto maximum injection, and radiofrequency lens of 50%. For DDA, MS2 fragmentation was performed on charge states 2 to 6 with a 20-s dynamic exclusion after a single selection and 10 ppm ± mass tolerance. Raw mass spectrometry data were searched using Fragpipe (v22) ( 34 ,  35 ) against the human proteome (UniProt canonical protein sequences, downloaded in September 2022) using PhosphoLFQ ( 36 – 38 ) label-free quantification workflow. Statistical analysis was performed using MSstats (v4.8.7) ( 39 ) from the artMS (v1.18.0) R package. Kinase enrichment analysis was performed using RoKAI Differential Expression analysis ( 40 ). For samples run by data independent acquisition (DIA), samples were resuspended in 0.1% formic acid and separated by reversed-phase (RP) chromatography using a Thermo EASY-nLC instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a 15-cm PepSep column (150 µm inner diameter) packed with 1.5-µm Reprosil Saphir C18 particles (Bruker). Mobile phase A consisted of 0.1% FA in water and mobile phase B consisted of 80% ACN and 0.1% FA. Peptides were separated at a flow rate of 1.5ul min−1 over the following 110-min gradient: 2–15% B in 88 min, 15–25% B in 10 min and 12 min at 90% B. Eluting peptides were analyzed by an Orbitrap Lumos MS instrument (ThermoFisher Scientific). An MS scan was performed at 120,000 resolving power over a scan range of 300-1200 m/z, a standard AGC target of 100%, an RF lens setting of 30%, and an auto maximum injection time was acquired, followed by DIA scans using 16 m/z isolation windows over 358-1111 m/z at normalized HCD collision energies of 27, 32, and 37%. Loop control was set to All. A library was generated using Data Dependent Analysis (DDA). Samples were resuspended in 0.1% formic acid and separated by reversed-phase (RP) chromatography using a Thermo EASY-nLC instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a 15-cm PepSep column (150 µm inner diameter) packed with 1.5-µm Reprosil Saphir C18 particles (Bruker). Mobile phase A consisted of 0.1% FA in water and mobile phase B consisted of 80% ACN and 0.1% FA. Peptides were separated at a flow rate of 600nl min−1 over the following 95-min gradient: 3–30% B in 75 min, 30–38% B in 10 min and 10 min at 8% B. Eluting peptides were analyzed by an Orbitrap Lumos MS instrument (ThermoFisher Scientific). DDA was performed by acquiring a full scan over an m/z range of 375-1150 in the Orbitrap at 60,000 resolving power (@200 m/z) with a standard AGC target of 100%, an RF lens setting of 30%, and an auto maximum ion injection time. Dynamic exclusion was set to 60 seconds, with a 10 ppm exclusion width setting. Peptides with charge states 2-7 were selected for MS/MS interrogation using isolation width of 1.4m/z, and stepped HCD collision energy of 15, 30, 45%. APEX Reaction and Capture of Biotinylated Proteins. Cells were incubated with 500 μM biotin-phenol in complete medium for 30 min at 37 °C. APEX labeling was initiated by addition of H 2 O 2  at a final concentration of 1 mM and incubated for 30 s. To quench the reaction, H 2 O 2  solution was discarded, and cells were immediately washed 3× with ice-cold quenching solution (10 μM Sodium ascorbate, 5 mM Trolox, 10 μM NaN 3 ) for 1 min × wash. Cells were scraped and collected in quencher solution and pelleted. Excess solution was removed and cell pellets were snap-frozen. To proceed with pulldown of biotin-labeled proteins, cell pellets were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton-X100) supplemented with 10 μM Sodium ascorbate, 5 mM Trolox, 10 μM NaN 3 , 1 mM DTT, and protease inhibitor (Complete protease inhibitor, Sigma #4693159001). Cell lysates were sonicated 3× at 15% for 7 s. Lysates were cleared at 13,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C and protein concentrations were quantified using 600 nM Pierce Assay Kit with Detergent Compatibility Reagent (ThermoFisher, #22662). Streptavidin magnetic beads (ThermoFisher, #88816) were washed 2× with RIPA buffer and 100 μL washed beads were added per sample. Binding was allowed to proceed overnight at 4 °C with rocking. Beads were collected on a magnetic rack and the following wash steps were performed at 4 °C: 3× wash with RIPA buffer (5 min each), 1× wash with 1 M KCL (2min), 1× wash with Na 2 CO 2  (2min), and 2× with 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH = 8.0] (5 min). Beads were resuspended in 200 μL Digestion buffer (2 M urea in 50 mM Tris pH = 8.0). Samples were reduced by adding 5 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with orbital shaking at 1,000 rpm. Samples were alkylated with iodoacetamide at 5 mM at room temperature, covered from light with orbital shaking at 1,000 rpm. The reaction was quenched with addition of 5 mM DTT. Biotinylated proteins were digested with addition of 0.8 μg mass spectrometry grade Trypsin (Promega, #V5111) overnight at 37 °C with orbital shaking at 1,000 rpm. The following morning, an additional 0.4 μg trypsin was added and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with shaking. Samples were acidified with 0.5% TFA and desalted using C18 96-well plate format (Higgins Analytical, #96WR-20mg-W182). APEX Proximity Labeling Mass Spectrometry. APEX-labeled samples were acquired on a Bruker TimsTOFpro interfaced with an Ultimate3000 UHPLC. Peptides were resuspended in 0.1% FA and were separated using a 60 min linear gradient. Following loading, the percentage of B (80% ACN in 0.1% FA) was increased from 2 to 26% in 49 min and then to 90% remaining time. The peptides were separated on a PepSep column (15 cm, 150 mm iid, 1.9 μm beads size). The mass spectrometer was operated in positive mode using DIA-PASEF acquisition ( 41 ). The mass range was set at 100 to 1,700m/z with 10 scans between 0.7 Vs/cm2 and 1.4 Vs/cm2. 2 ms and 100 ms were set for the accumulation and ramp times, respectively. Raw mass spectrometry files were analyzed using Spectronaut (version 18.4.231017.55695) against the human proteome (UniProt canonical protein sequences downloaded in September 2022) using default settings for spectral library generation and DIA. Statistical analysis was performed using MSstats (v4.8.7) ( 39 ) from the artMS (v1.18.0) R package. Visualization was performed in Cytoscape with additional connections included from the STRING database ( 42 ). Statistical Analysis. All experiments were repeated as independent biologic replicates. Statistics were derived from biologic replicates, and no statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. Cells were randomized to experimental conditions, and no data points were excluded from analysis. Unless otherwise specified, data are plotted as mean with error bars representing the SEM. The statistical tests of choice were selected based on the input data. All statistical tests were one-sided. Where appropriate, multiple hypothesis testing corrections were performed.

PMID:32443592,C-Fiber Loss as a Possible Cause of Neuropathic Pain in Schwannomatosis.,"Schwannomatosis is the third form of neurofibromatosis and characterized by the occurrence of multiple schwannomas. The most prominent symptom is chronic pain. We aimed to test whether pain in schwannomatosis might be caused by small-fiber neuropathy. Twenty patients with schwannomatosis underwent neurological examination and nerve conduction studies. Levels of pain perception as well as anxiety and depression were assessed by established questionnaires. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) and laser-evoked potentials (LEP) were performed on patients and controls. Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (wbMRI) and magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) were performed to quantify tumors and fascicular nerve lesions; skin biopsies were performed to determine intra-epidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD). All patients suffered from chronic pain without further neurological deficits. The questionnaires indicated neuropathic symptoms with significant impact on quality of life. Peripheral nerve tumors were detected in all patients by wbMRI. MRN showed additional multiple fascicular nerve lesions in 16/18 patients. LEP showed significant faster latencies compared to normal controls. Finally, IENFD was significantly reduced in 13/14 patients. Our study therefore indicates the presence of small-fiber neuropathy, predominantly of unmyelinated C-fibers. Fascicular nerve lesions are characteristic disease features that are associated with faster LEP latencies and decreased IENFD. Together these methods may facilitate differential diagnosis of schwannomatosis.","3. Subjects, Materials and Methods  3.1. Patients In total, 20 patients (mean age 55.4  ±  10.9 (SD) years; male:female = 1:1) were consecutively included in the study at the Neurofibromatosis outpatient clinic of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf. Inclusion criteria were the fulfillment of the clinical diagnostic criteria for schwannomatosis [ 11 ] and absence of any other disease with potential impact upon central or peripheral nervous system function, such as chronic infections, autoimmune diseases, malignancies, diabetes, or alcoholism. Detailed neurological examination was performed by a physician (VFM) with 30 years of experience in the diagnosis and treatment of neurofibromatosis and schwannomatosis. In order to perform genetic testing, genomic DNA of the patients was isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes and used as a template for the PCR amplification of  NF2 ,  SMARCB1,  and  LZTR1  exons. Sanger sequencing of the PCR products was performed using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (ABI, Life Technologies, Foster City, CA, USA). Rearrangments involving the NF2 gene were investigated by MLPA (SALSA MLPA P044 NF2 probemix, MRC Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Control groups were method-specific cohorts of healthy controls (QST, LEP, MRN, questionnaires) and established reference values (questionnaires, neurophysiological measurements, IENFD). For MRN and IENFD, measurements and analyses were conducted in a blinded manner. For the QST, LEP, and neurophysiological examination blinding the investigators was not possible, however, data analysis was carried out in a blinded fashion. 3.2. Pain- and Personality-Questionnaires The Hospital Depression and Anxiety Score (HADS) was used to screen for anxiety and depression [ 14 ]. Pain perception was assessed by the PainDETECT questionnaire, which provides high sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value to detect neuropathic pain [ 15 ]. In order to examine stable traits of patients’ personality the multidimensional “Freiburger Persönlichkeitsinventar” (FPI) was used [ 16 ]. By means of the Symptom Checklist-90-R (SCL-90-R) [ 17 ], the patients’ subjective strain through physical and psychological disorders were measured. The German Version of the SF-36 health survey was utilized to assess health-related quality of life [ 18 ]. A group of 20 age and sex-matched healthy controls (mean age 56  ±  11.2 (SD) years; male:female = 1:1) served as a control group.  Normal distribution was investigated using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Then, questionnaire data was compared between groups using either unpaired  t -tests or Mann–Whitney-U test, as appropriate.  p -values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.  3.3. Neurophysiological Measurements Conventional electrodiagnostic testing (nerve conduction velocity and compound muscle action potential amplitude) of the right peroneal, left tibial, and right ulnar and/or median nerve was performed in the neurophysiology laboratory of the Hamburg-Eppendorf University Hospital using a Nihon Kohden Neuropack X1 (Rosbach v.d.H., Germany). 3.4. Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) QST is a standardized noninvasive psychophysical method, which examines the function of thickly-myelinated Aβ, thinly- and unmyelinated Aδ-, and C-fibers as well as their corresponding central pathways by the application of thermal and mechanical stimuli on the skin. QST was performed by a certified examiner (ALH) after a pre-defined protocol by the German Network on Neuropathic Pain (DFNS) [ 19 ] in all 20 patients. QST comprised seven different tests measuring the following 13 parameters: cold and warm detection thresholds (CDT, WDT), cold and heat pain thresholds (CPT, HPT), paradoxical heat sensations (PHS) during the thermal sensory limen (TSL) procedure, mechanical detection threshold (MDT), mechanical pain threshold (MPT), stimulus-response-functions for pinprick sensitivity (MPS) and dynamic mechanical allodynia (DMA), pain summation to repetitive pinprick stimuli (wind-up ratio, WUR), vibration detection threshold (VDT), and pressure pain threshold (PPT). A group of 20 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (mean age 54.8  ±  11.2 (SD) years; male:female = 1:1) served as control group. QST was assessed on the dorsum of both hands and feet except in one patient (and its matched control) in whom only both hands were assessed. Areas whose innervation could have been compromised by previous surgeries (e.g., scars) were avoided.  QST statistical analysis was performed using “eQUISTA“ (Casquar GmbH, Bochum, Germany), which calculates a sensory profile by transformation of the absolute measured values into relative data by calculation of z-scores according to the following formula based on the published data of healthy controls: z-value = (value patient  – mean controls ) / SD controls  [ 20 ]. CDT, WDT, and PHS as parameters for function of small nerve fibers and MDT and VDT as parameters for function of large nerve fibers were statistically investigated. Normal distribution was ascertained via Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Then, either unpaired  t -tests or the non-parametric Mann–Whitney U-test were used to compare the pooled z-values of hands and feet between patients and controls, as appropriate. Pathological PHS and the number of patients with small, large and mixed fiber neuropathy (according to QST) as categorical variables were compared between groups using the Chi-square test.  p -values < 0.05 were regarded as statistically significant. 3.5. Laser Evoked Potentials (LEP) LEP were recorded in 18 patients and matched controls. Two patients were refused to undergo LEP measurements. We delivered brief infrared laser stimuli of 1 ms duration and a beam diameter of 5 mm to the dorsum of both feet and hands using a thulium YAG laser (wavelength 2 μm, StarMedTec, Starnberg, Germany). Individual pain thresholds were determined using three series of increasing and decreasing stimuli. Beginning at 160 mJ, we used a step-size of 20 mJ. Pain was defined as a feeling of a light pin-prick or burning. LEP are capable to investigate nociceptive pathways, especially A-delta fibers. During the experiment, subjects were comfortably seated in an electrically shielded and sound-attenuated recording chamber with eyes closed. The session consisted of eight blocks and started at the left hand, followed by the right hand, right foot, and left foot. Repetitions of all sites were then performed in the reverse order to minimize confounding of site with habituation effects over time. Each block comprised 30 laser-stimuli with a two-fold pain threshold intensity. The inter-stimulus interval varied between six or seven seconds. Two seconds after the laser stimulus, an acoustic event (2000 Hz tone) prompted a verbal response, scaling pain intensity and ensuring patients attention. EEG was recorded with nose-reference using 64 active channels (EASY CAP) and BrainVision Recorder-software (Brain Products GmbH, Gilching, Germany) through two BrainAmp MRplus 32 channel amplifiers with a sampling frequency of 1000 Hz and a band pass filter between 0.1–250 Hz. The electrode impedance was kept below 15 kΩ. The data were analyzed offline using Fieldtrip software (Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging, AH Nijmegen, The Netherlands,  www.ru.nl/fcdonders/fieldtrip ). For detailed artifact rejection see Hauck and colleagues [ 21 ]. Mixed analysis of variance was used to compare LEP amplitudes and LEP latencies between patients and controls with amplitude (or latency) as 4-level dependent variable and group as independent variable.  p -values < 0.05 were regarded as statistically significant. 3.6. Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Neurography Vestibular schwannomas—the hallmark tumor entity of NF2—were excluded by contrast-enhanced cranial MRI. Patients underwent whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (wbMRI) at 3.0 Tesla according to previously described protocols [ 22 ]. Peripheral schwannomas detectable on wbMRI were counted to estimate total tumor burden. Additional high-resolution microstructural MR neurography was performed in 18 of 20 patients at 3.0 Tesla (Magnetom Verio, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) for the lumbosacral plexus and the right lower extremity. Additional extremities were optionally examined based on patient’s compliance and ability to lie still for prolonged examination time. Doing so the contralateral leg was also examined in another eight patients and the upper extremities were additionally examined in five of those patients. The sequence protocol was as follows: Lumbosacral plexus: 3D-isotropic T2-weighted SPACE sequence with fat-saturation by inversion-recovery and TR/TE/TI 3800/267/210, voxel size 0.95 × 0.95 × 1.0 mm, FoV 250 × 245 mm, acquisition time 8:32 min. Extremities were examined by multiple stacks of 2D T2-weighted turbo-spin-echo sequences (for the right leg generally thigh, knee, calf level) with the following parameters: T2 TSE TR/TE 7552/52, in-plane resolution 0.273 × 0.273 mm 2 , FoV 140 mm, slice thickness 3.0 mm, frequency-selective fat-saturation, acquisition time 7:07 min. Dedicated surface array coils for plexus imaging and circularly-polarized extremity transmit-receive coils for extremities were used. MR neurography (MRN) scans were evaluated blinded to the patients’ data by two radiologists (PB, MB) with more than eight and 18 years of experience in MRN, respectively, to detect: (1) Manifest peripheral nerve tumors of more than 5mm in diameter; (2) Intermediate-sized nerve nodules, defined as neural caliber increase between 2 and 5 mm in diameter; and (3) The presence of peripheral nerve microlesions with increased T2-weighted signal but with only minor or no fascicular caliber increase (< 2 mm in diameter as described previously [ 23 ]) ( Figure 2 ). This quantitative analysis was performed for the right lower extremity, which was examined in all patients except for one whose contralateral leg was examined due to a right hip prosthesis. Manifest peripheral nerve tumors and nerve nodules were counted individually unless they exceeded more than ten. In addition, an overall MRN score for lesion accumulation of peripheral nerves of the right leg was used with regard to the presence of tumors, intermediate lesions, and microlesions on a Likert scale of 0–4 (with 0 indicating no nerve abnormalities, 1 slight but distinct abnormalities, 2 disseminated nerve lesions, 3 high extent of nerve abnormalities with only few nerve segments without clear lesions, and 4 massive ubiquitous tumor burden). For MRN statistical analysis, Pearson correlation and unpaired t-test were used to investigate association of MRN lesion load with LEP parameters, IENFD, or tumor load in wbMRI. 3.7. Skin Biopsies and Intraepidermal Nerve Fiber Density Skin biopsies were performed in 14 of 20 patients by an expert surgeon for plastic surgery (RF). Six patients refused to have skin biopsies. An 8 mm punch biopsy was taken 10 cm above the lateral malleolus of the distal leg according to the standardized protocol for diagnosis of small fiber neuropathies (European Federation of Neurological Societies/Peripheral Nerve Society Guideline) [ 24 ]. The tissue was directly transferred into Zamboni solution and cooled to 4 °C. Immunohistochemical staining and evaluation was performed at the Institute of Neuropathology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, by using a standardized protocol. In short, 50 µm thick frozen cross sections of the skin sample were cut on superfrost slides additionally coated with poly-L-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich, #P8920, Taufkirchen, Germany) and air dried for at least 24 hrs. Blocking of endogenous peroxidase was done with 3% perhydrol (Merck, #107209, Darmstadt, Germany) in methanol for 90 min. The tissue was rehydrated and pre-treated for antigen-retrieval in 10 mM citrate buffer pH 6 for 90 min at 80 °C. The samples were then incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-PGP 9.5 (Dako #Z5116, Glostrup, Denmark, antibody dilution 1:200) over night at room temperature. Bound antibody was visualized with anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Histofine Max PO Multi, #414152 F, Nichirei Biosciences Inc., Tokyo, Japan) for three hours followed by addition of the chromogen Metal Enhanced DAB Substrate Kit (Thermo Scientific, #34065, Bremen, Germany) according to manufacturer’s instructions for 15 min. Counterstaining was performed with haemalum. Antibody labelling of dermal nerve fascicles served as internal positive control and was differentiated from weak unspecific stroke-like staining of collagen fibers and chromogen deposition in small tissue tears and clefts by the higher intensity of labelling, the stretch from subepidermal to intradermal layer and the characteristic curved shape of the fibers with sudden turns and bends ( Figure 4 A). For estimation of nerve fiber density the intraepidermal nerve fiber count per mm skin was evaluated in at least three cuts corresponding to a skin length of approx. 9 mm by two experienced neuropathologists (MG and CH) who were blinded to patient identity and diagnosis. The intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) was compared to age-dependent reference values [ 12 ]. The raw IEND data were plotted against age, separately for male and female patients and compared to the normative reference IEND. Some parts of this analysis have already been published in a comparative study with patients exhibiting NF2 [ 13 ]; that protocol focused on establishing a new diagnostic approach for differential diagnosis and is a follow-up protocol to this study. 3.8. Standard Protocol Approvals, Registrations, and Patient Consents The study was approved by the ethical board of the Medical Association Hamburg (PV4421), Germany, and performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

PMID:2491785,"The order of loci in the pericentric region of chromosome 17, based on evidence from physical and genetic breakpoints.","Previous genetic analyses of chromosome 17 markers and NF1 (Fain et al. 1987) were extended in an attempt to order marker loci that map physically to 17cen----17q12. Three additional markers (HHH202, CRI-L581, and CRI-L946) were included in the analyses. Recombinants within the cluster of seven unordered marker loci were identified by pairwise analyses for each family and by examining the within-sibship segregation patterns for different markers. Changes in the segregation pattern for different loci define genetic breakpoints. Given that interference is complete in the region, markers with the same segregation pattern lie on one side of the breakpoint, while markers with different segregation patterns lie on opposite sides of the breakpoint. If the order of boundary markers is known, markers on each side of a breakpoint can be oriented in relation to the centromere. The order cen-(HHH202/NF1)-(EW207)-(EW203/CRI-L581)- (CRI-L946)-(HOX-2/NGFR)-qter was inferred by combining information from physical breakpoints in a panel of mouse/human hybrids and information from genetic breakpoints found in 16 NF1 families.",,P R Fain; E Wright; H F Willard; K Stephens; D F Barker,American journal of human genetics,1989-01,,abstract_only,False
PMID:28001089,The role of the immune system in neurofibromatosis type 1-associated nervous system tumors.,"With the recent development of new anticancer therapies targeting the immune system, it is important to understand which immune cell types and cytokines play critical roles in suppressing or promoting tumorigenesis. The role of mast cells in promoting neurofibroma growth in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients was hypothesized decades ago. More recent experiments in mouse models have demonstrated the causal role of mast cells in neurofibroma development and of microglia in optic pathway glioma development. We review here what is known about the role of NF1 mutation in immune cell function and the role of immune cells in promoting tumorigenesis in NF1. We also review the therapies targeting immune cell pathways and their promise in NF1 tumors.",,Souvik Karmakar; Karlyne M Reilly,CNS oncology,2017-01,10.2217/cns-2016-0024,abstract_only,False
PMID:37712888,A common single nucleotide variant in the cytokine receptor-like factor-3 (CRLF3) gene causes neuronal deficits in human and mouse cells.,"Single nucleotide variants in the general population are common genomic alterations, where the majority are presumed to be silent polymorphisms without known clinical significance. Using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) cerebral organoid modeling of the 1.4 megabase Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) deletion syndrome, we previously discovered that the cytokine receptor-like factor-3 (CRLF3) gene, which is co-deleted with the NF1 gene, functions as a major regulator of neuronal maturation. Moreover, children with NF1 and the CRLF3L389P variant have greater autism burden, suggesting that this gene might be important for neurologic function. To explore the functional consequences of this variant, we generated CRLF3L389P-mutant hiPSC lines and Crlf3L389P-mutant genetically engineered mice. While this variant does not impair protein expression, brain structure, or mouse behavior, CRLF3L389P-mutant human cerebral organoids and mouse brains exhibit impaired neuronal maturation and dendrite formation. In addition, Crlf3L389P-mutant mouse neurons have reduced dendrite lengths and branching, without any axonal deficits. Moreover, Crlf3L389P-mutant mouse hippocampal neurons have decreased firing rates and synaptic current amplitudes relative to wild type controls. Taken together, these findings establish the CRLF3L389P variant as functionally deleterious and suggest that it may be a neurodevelopmental disease modifier.",,Anna F Wilson; Rasha Barakat; Rui Mu; Leah L Karush; Yunqing Gao; Kelly A Hartigan; Ji-Kang Chen; Hongjin Shu; Tychele N Turner; Susan E Maloney; Steven J Mennerick; David H Gutmann; Corina Anastasaki,Human molecular genetics,2023-12-01,10.1093/hmg/ddad155,abstract_only,False
PMID:18218617,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor, neurofibromin, regulates the neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells via its associating protein, CRMP-2.","Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor gene product, neurofibromin, functions in part as a Ras-GAP, a negative regulator of Ras. Neurofibromin is implicated in the neuronal abnormality of NF1 patients; however, the precise cellular function of neurofibromin has yet to be clarified. Using proteomic strategies, we identified a set of neurofibromin-associating cellular proteins, including axon regulator CRMP-2 (Collapsin response mediator protein-2). CRMP-2 directly bound to the C-terminal domain of neurofibromin, and this association was regulated by the manner of CRMP-2 phosphorylation. In nerve growth factor-stimulated PC12 cells, neurofibromin and CRMP-2 co-localized particularly on the distal tips and branches of extended neurites. Suppression of neurofibromin using NF1 small interfering RNA significantly inhibited this neurite outgrowth and up-regulated a series of CRMP-2 phosphorylations by kinases identified as CDK5, GSK-3b, and Rho kinase. Overexpression of the NF1-RAS-GAP-related domain rescued these NF1 small interfering RNA-induced events. Our results suggest that neurofibromin regulates neuronal differentiation by performing one or more complementary roles. First, neurofibromin directly regulates CRMP-2 phosphorylation accessibility through the complex formation. Also, neurofibromin appears to indirectly regulate CRMP-2 activity by suppressing CRMP-2-phosphorylating kinase cascades via its Ras-GAP function. Our study demonstrates that the functional association of neurofibromin and CRMP-2 is essential for neuronal cell differentiation and that lack of expression or abnormal regulation of neurofibromin can result in impaired function of neuronal cells, which is likely a factor in NF1-related pathogenesis.",,Siriporn Patrakitkomjorn; Daiki Kobayashi; Takashi Morikawa; Masayo Morifuji Wilson; Nobuyuki Tsubota; Atsushi Irie; Tatsuya Ozawa; Masashi Aoki; Nariko Arimura; Kozo Kaibuchi; Hideyuki Saya; Norie Araki,The Journal of biological chemistry,2008-04-04,10.1074/jbc.M708206200,abstract_only,False
PMID:28065690,Medium throughput biochemical compound screening identifies novel agents for pharmacotherapy of neurofibromatosis type 1.,"The variable manifestation of phenotypes that occur in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) includes benign and malignant neurocutaneous tumors for which no adequate treatment exists. Cell-based screening of known bioactive compounds library identified the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor Cantharidin and the L-type calcium channel blocker Nifedipine as potential candidates for NF1 pharmacotherapy. Validation of screening results using human NF1-associated malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) cells showed that Cantharidin effectively impeded MPNST cell growth, while Nifedipine treatment significantly decreased local tumor growth in an MPNST xenograft animal model. These data suggest that inhibitors of PP2A, as well as calcium channel blockers, might be used in broader MPNST preclinical studies as single agents or in combinatorial therapeutic strategies.","2.

In Vitro Cytotoxicity Assay, Half Inhibitory Concentration (IC50) Calculation MEFs were plated in triplicate for each dose of the compound on 96-well plates at 10000 cells/well in complete medium. Twenty-four hours after plating, cells were treated with carrier alone (0.1% DMSO) or bioactive compounds. Cell viability was evaluated seventy-two hours after addition of drugs using alamarBlue fluorescent assay (Life Technologies, USA). The values of IC50, the drug concentration required for 50% growth inhibition, were calculated using software package Calcusyn (Biosoft). 2.3. Small Bioactive Compound Library Screening The ICCB Known Bioactives library (Enzo Life Sciences, USA, BML-2840-0100) was used for the screening. The screening was performed using MEF  Nf1 −/−  E1A-p53  in triplicate and repeated 2 times. Drug transfer was performed 24 hrs after plating using CyBi Cell Vario automated pipettor, transfer volume 100 nL. DMSO and staurosporin at the final concentration of 5 uM were used as negative and positive controls respectively. Read-outs were done in 72 hours using alamarBlue cytotoxicity assay.

PMID:19427294,Cell of origin and microenvironment contribution for NF1-associated dermal neurofibromas.,"The tumor predisposition disorder neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is one of the most common genetic disorders of the nervous system. It is caused by mutations in the Nf1 tumor-suppressor gene, which encodes a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that negatively regulates p21-RAS. Development of malignant nerve tumors and neurofibromas occurs frequently in NF1. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms mediating the initiation and progression of these complex tumors, or the identity of the specific cell type that gives rise to dermal or cutaneous neurofibromas. In this study, we identify a population of stem/progenitor cells residing in the dermis termed skin-derived precursors (SKPs) that, through loss of Nf1, form neurofibromas. We propose that SKPs, or their derivatives, are the cell of origin of dermal neurofibroma. We also provide evidence that additional signals from nonneoplastic cells in the tumor microenvironment play essential roles in neurofibromagenesis.","EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Mice All mice were housed in the animal facility at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas (UTSW). Animal care and use were in compliance with regulations of the Institutional Animal Care and Research Advisory Committee at UTSW. The  Nf1 flox/-  mice are in a mixed genetic background of C57BL/6/ Sv129 and have been described previously ( Zhu et al., 2002 ). For conditional ablation of  Nf1 , we used a tamoxifen-inducible Cre line, the CMV-CreERT transgenic mice ( Hayashi and McMahon, 2002 ). The LacZ reporter mice, ROSA26 ( Soriano, 1999 ), were obtained from the Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Cell Culture and Differentiation Assays SKPs were isolated as previously reported ( Biernaskie et al., 2006 ;  Toma et al., 2001 ). Briefly, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 40 μl of a ketamine and xylazine (4:1) solution. Skin was harvested from neck, ears or back. The hair, fascia, adipose, blood vessel and muscle tissues were carefully dissected out and the skin was cut into small pieces (2-3 mm), washed 3 times in Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution (Invitrogen), and then digested with 0.1% trypsin at 37°C for 30 minutes. The skin tissues were then mechanically dissociated, passed through a 70-μm cell strainer and washed once with Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM)/F12 + 10% Fetal Bovine Serum. The cell pellet was then washed three times with serum-free DMEM/F12 media, counted and plated at a density of 20 cells/μl on uncoated, ultralow attachment 6-well plates (Corning) in proliferation media: DMEM/F12 containing penicillin/streptomycin (0.1%); fungizone (40 μg/ml); B27 (without vitamin A), epidermal growth factor (20 ng/ml), and basic fibroblast growth factor (40 ng/ml; Sigma). The sphere cells were fed every 3 to 4 days and passaged every 7 days. For differentiation assays, we seeded 1.0 × 10 4  cells per well of an eight-chamber slide coated with Poly-D-lysine/laminin and cultured with fresh media containing B27 + 5% FBS for 7-14 days. Then, we fixed the cells with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and performed immunostaining for lineage markers as below (see Histology and Immunostaining). Transplant Experiments SKPs were isolated as above. Mice were allowed to recover from anesthesia after closure of excision wounds with 4-0 nylon suture. After 7 to 10 days in culture, SKPs were exposed to 1 μM of 4OH-Tamoxifen. Sphere cells were subsequently harvested for X-gal staining and genotypic PCR analysis ( Kwon et al., 2008 ) along with control sphere cells (no 4OH-Tamoxifen exposure). Once recombination was confirmed, 1 × 10 5  viable  Nf1 -positive single cells from SKP spheres were resuspended in 40 μl of L15 medium (GIBCO) and implanted either intradermally/subcutaneously or next to the right sciatic nerve of the same mouse that the SKPs were originally isolated from. For the control, a suspension of 1 × 10 -/- ;LacZ 5  viable  Nf1 -negative single cells was implanted either intradermally/subcutaneously or next to the left sciatic nerve in the same manner. To evaluate the effect of the hormonal milieu during pregnancy on neurofibroma development, the  +/- ;LacZ Nf1 -positive SKPs were prepared as above from both male and female mice. One week before reimplantation, these male and female mice were housed in the same cage to promote breeding. 1 × 10 -/- ;LacZ 5  viable  Nf1 -positive SKPs were then suspended in 40 μl of L15 medium (GIBCO) and implanted back to the same animal intradermally/subcutaneously at the dorsal, distal back (sacral area). We chose this anatomical location to prevent the mice from scratching at the site of implantation. -/- ;LacZ Histology and Immunostaining For H&E histology analysis, tissue specimens were harvested and fixed with 10% formalin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 day and subsequently embedded in paraffin. Sections (5 μm thick) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) as per manufacturer’s protocol (StatLab, Lewisville, Texas). For immunohistochemistry, paraffin sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated and subjected to antigen retrieval prior to incubation with the primary antibodies. The primary antibodies were visualized by treating the sections with biotinylated secondary antibody and followed by amplification with peroxidase-conjugated avidin and DAB substrate as per manufacturer’s protocol (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). For immunofluorescent staining, cells grown in 8-chamber slides were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 mins, blocked and incubated with different primary antibodies as described below for lineage marking. The primary antibodies were detected by secondary antibodies conjugated with Cy3 or FITC (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) followed by counterstaining with DAPI (Vector Labs). The dilutions of primary antibodies used in this study were as follows: β-TubulinIII (rabbit, 1:2000, Sigma), GAP43 (rabbit, 1:1000, Abcam), GFAP (rabbit, 1:2000, DAKO), nestin (mouse, 1:200, Chemicon), and S100β(rabbit, 1:5000, DAKO). X-gal Staining and Western Blotting For X-gal staining, mice were anesthetized with ketamine (1.5 mg/mouse) and subjected to total body perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Tissues were harvested, equilibrated in 30% sucrose in PBS overnight at 4°C, washed three times with 1X PBS and stained with X-gal at 30°C overnight. Part of the tissues were also concurrently embedded in OTC medium (Tissue-Tek). Frozen sections were sliced with a cryostat and mounted on superfrost microscope slides (Fisher Scientific). Cryostat sections were postfixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with X-gal at 30°C overnight, and counterstained with nuclear fast red. The X-gal reaction mixture is comprised of 1 mg/ml 4-chloro-5-bromo-3-indolyl-β-galactoside (X-gal), 4 mM potassium ferrocyanide, 4 mM potassium ferricyanide, and 2 mM magnesium chloride in PBS. Western blotting on lysates of SKPs and 3T3 cells with Dhh antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was performed following manufacturer’s protocol. Leder Stain for Mast Cells Leder staining, an enzymatic stain for Naphthol AS-D (3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid-O-toluidine) chloroacetate esterase to detect tissue mast cells was performed as previously described ( Prophet et al., 1992 ). Briefly, paraffin sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated and placed in pararosaniline veronal acetate esterase solution for 30 minutes, rinsed in distilled water for 2 minutes and counter-stained with hematoxylin solution. The tissue slides were then rinsed again in distilled water, dehydrated and mounted using xylene base medium. Oil Red O Stain for Adipocytes Lipid droplets were stained with Oil Red O. SKPs from the primary sphere colonies were differentiated on poly-D-lysine/laminin-coated 8-chamber slides as described above for 7 to 14 days in the presence of FBS. The cells were fixed with formalin at room temperature for 5 minutes and washed 3 times with 1X PBS. The cells were then stained with 0.3% Oil Red O solution for one hour at room temperature, washed 3 times with water and the red-staining lipid droplets were visualized using an inverted microscope.",Lu Q Le; Tracey Shipman; Dennis K Burns; Luis F Parada,Cell stem cell,2009-05-08,10.1016/j.stem.2009.03.017,minimal,True
PMID:30290804,Genetic diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1: targeted next- generation sequencing with Multiple Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a dominantly inherited tumor predisposition syndrome that targets the peripheral nervous system. It is caused by mutations of the NF1 gene which serve as a negative regulator of the cellular Ras/MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinases) signaling pathway. Owing to the complexity in some parts of clinical diagnoses and the need for better understanding of its molecular relationships, a genetic characterization of this disorder will be helpful in the clinical setting. METHODS: In this study, we present a customized targeted gene panel of NF1/KRAS/BRAF/p53 and SPRED1 genes combined with Multiple Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification analysis for the NF1 mutation screening in a cohort of patients clinically suspected as NF1. RESULTS: In this study, we identified 73 NF1 mutations and two BRAF novel variants from 100 NF1 patients who were suspected as having NF1. These genetic alterations are heterogeneous and distribute in a complicated way without clustering in either cysteine-serine-rich domain or within the GAP-related domain. We also detected fifteen multi-exon deletions within the NF1 gene by MLPA Analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that a genetic screening using a NGS panel with high coverage of Ras-signaling components combined with Multiple Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification analysis will enable differential diagnosis of patients with overlapping clinical features.","Methods In this study, we present a customized targeted gene panel of  NF1 / KRAS / BRAF / p53  and  SPRED1  genes combined with Multiple Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification analysis for the NF1 mutation screening in a cohort of patients clinically suspected as NF1. Methods Patients and sample preparations One hundred NF1 patients suspected as having NF1 by a clinical evaluation were recruited for this study. From each patient, 10 ml of whole blood samples were collected in EDTA-anticoagulant tube through the Linko Medical Center of the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Fifteen patients had a known family history of NF1. Ethical approval for this study was obtained by the institutional review board (102-0226A3) at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. All participants provided written informed consent. Genomic DNA of each patient was then prepared using the PUREGENE DNA purification kit from GENTRA using standard protein precipitation procedures. The quality of the DNA was estimated using the Nano-Drop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Candidate gene-targeted sequencing A panel of five NF1-related genes including  NF1  ( NM_000267 , 17q11.2),  SPRED1  ( NM_152594 , 15q14),  KRAS  ( NM_004985 , 12p12.1),  BRAF  ( NM_004333 , 7q34), and  p53  ( NM_000546 , 17p13.1) was initially created designed to capture, amplify, and sequence specific regions (including exons and splice junctions) of the genome for human cancer screening. The total length was 32.3 kb encompassing 296 amplicons, and the coverage was 507×. Adapter sequences were clonally amplified by emulsion PCR on the high-density array of micro-machined wells. In this study, we took the advantage of this gene panel for the germline mutation analysis of NF1 using the Ion Personal Genome Machine® (PGM™) Sequencer (Life technology). Sample library preparation A total of 100 indexed rapid prepared Ion AmpliSeq DNA libraries, starting from 100 ng of gDNA per sample, were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Template preparation and emulsion PCR and Ion Sphere Particles (ISP) enrichment were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Following the purification and size selection using AMPure beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA), the size distribution of the DNA fragments was analyzed on the Agilent Bioanalyzer using High-Sensitivity DNA chip (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA) and the quality checking of ion sphere particles for the prepared library was performed using Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies). Enriched ISPs were prepared for sequencing using the Ion PGM 200 Sequencing Kit v2.0 and were loaded on an Ion 316 chip v2 or Ion 318 chip v2. Data analysis We used IT platform-specific pipeline software Torrent Suite, version 4.2, with the plug-in “variant caller” program (Life Technologies) to perform reference genome alignment, base calling, and filtering of poor signal reads. The Integrative Genome Viewer (IGV) ( http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/ ) was used for visualizing the status of each read alignment. The selected variants were classified as deleterious mutation by mutation type if they were identified as nonsynonymous, frameshift, or stopgain at the exonic region. ACMG Standards and Guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants were followed in this study [ 35 ]. In an appropriate reference population, the pathogenic variant should have a frequency of much less than 1%. We removed all the common variants (Minor Allele Frequency, MAF > 1%) reported in the following public databases: 1000 Genomes Project ( http://www.1000genomes.org/ ), dbSNP database and ClinVar database ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/ ;  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ). Variants with amino acid changes were further examined for whether the changes were potentially damaging alterations using Sorting Tolerant From Intolerant (SIFT) and Polymorphism Phenotyping v2 (PolyPhen2) softwares, which can predict the possible impact of an amino acid substitution on the structure and function of a protein. The nomenclature of novel variants followed the rules of the Human Genome Variation Society ( http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen/ ). The genetic variants in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD, Institute of Medical Genetics, Cardiff,  http://www.hgmd.org/ ) and Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD:  www.lovd.nl/NF1 ) were also considered as references. PCR amplification and sanger sequencing verification We performed Sanger validation for all putatively pathogenic SNVs and indels variants on each detected patient (and their family members, if available) by PCR amplification and sequenced with Applied Biosystems 3730 Genetic Analyzer. PCR amplification was performed under standard conditions with 30 PCR cycles and 55°–60 °C annealing. PCR products were sequenced using the Big Dye Terminator cycle sequencing kit (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s cycling conditions and analyzed on an Applied Biosystems 3730xl Automated Sequencer Genetic Analyzer (Life Technologies). Sequence alignments and analysis were further performed using the Autoassembler computer program (Life Technologies). Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis We used SALSA P081/P082 NF1 MLPA kit (MRC Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) to confirm and identify single and multiple exon deletions/duplications according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Each samples containing 100 ng of genomic DNA was used for overnight hybridization with the probemixes. After ligation and amplification were performed with FAM-labeled primers, the PCR products were analyzed on a Genetic Analyzer 3730 capillary electrophoresis system and interpreted using Genotyper version 2.0 (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). In this study, we used the Coffalyser program (version 3.5) for peak area normalization and gene dosage calculation.

PMID:8105688,Linkage disequilibrium in the neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) region: implications for gene mapping.,"To test the usefulness of linkage disequilibrium for gene mapping, we compared physical distances and linkage disequilibrium among eight RFLPs in the neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) region. Seven of the polymorphisms span most of the NF1 gene, while the remaining polymorphism lies approximately 70 kb 3' to a stop codon in exon 49. By using Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) kindreds, 91-110 unrelated parents were genotyped. A high degree of disequilibrium is maintained among the seven intragenic polymorphisms (r > .82, P < 10(-7)), even though they are separated by as much as 340 kb. The 3' polymorphism is only 68 kb distal to the next polymorphism, but disequilibrium between the 3' polymorphism and all others is comparatively low (magnitude of 4 < .33, P values .27-.001). This result was replicated in three sets of unrelated kindreds: the Utah CEPH families, the non-Utah CEPH families, and an independent set of NF1 families. Trigenic, quadrigenic, three-locus, and four-locus disequilibrium measures were also estimated. There was little evidence of higher-order linkage disequilibrium. As expected for a disease with multiple mutations, no disequilibrium was observed between the disease gene and any of the RFLPs. The observed pattern of high disequilibrium within the gene and a loss of disequilibrium 3' to the stop codon could have implications for gene mapping studies. These are discussed, and guidelines for linkage disequilibrium studies are suggested.",,L B Jorde; W S Watkins; D Viskochil; P O'Connell; K Ward,American journal of human genetics,1993-11,,abstract_only,False
PMID:24726726,Molecular insights into NF2/Merlin tumor suppressor function.,"The FERM domain protein Merlin, encoded by the NF2 tumor suppressor gene, regulates cell proliferation in response to adhesive signaling. The growth inhibitory function of Merlin is induced by intercellular adhesion and inactivated by joint integrin/receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. Merlin contributes to the formation of cell junctions in polarized tissues, activates anti-mitogenic signaling at tight-junctions, and inhibits oncogenic gene expression. Thus, inactivation of Merlin causes uncontrolled mitogenic signaling and tumorigenesis. Merlin's predominant tumor suppressive functions are attributable to its control of oncogenic gene expression through regulation of Hippo signaling. Notably, Merlin translocates to the nucleus where it directly inhibits the CRL4(DCAF1) E3 ubiquitin ligase, thereby suppressing inhibition of the Lats kinases. A dichotomy in NF2 function has emerged whereby Merlin acts at the cell cortex to organize cell junctions and propagate anti-mitogenic signaling, whereas it inhibits oncogenic gene expression through the inhibition of CRL4(DCAF1) and activation of Hippo signaling. The biochemical events underlying Merlin's normal function and tumor suppressive activity will be discussed in this Review, with emphasis on recent discoveries that have greatly influenced our understanding of Merlin biology.",,Jonathan Cooper; Filippo G Giancotti,FEBS letters,2014-08-19,10.1016/j.febslet.2014.04.001,abstract_only,False
PMID:18953430,Tissue-specific ablation of Prkar1a causes schwannomas by suppressing neurofibromatosis protein production.,"Signaling events leading to Schwann cell tumor initiation have been extensively characterized in the context of neurofibromatosis (NF). Similar tumors are also observed in patients with the endocrine neoplasia syndrome Carney complex, which results from inactivating mutations in PRKAR1A. Loss of PRKAR1A causes enhanced protein kinase A activity, although the pathways leading to tumorigenesis are not well characterized. Tissue-specific ablation of Prkar1a in neural crest precursor cells (TEC3KO mice) causes schwannomas with nearly 80% penetrance by 10 months. These heterogeneous neoplasms were clinically characterized as genetically engineered mouse schwannomas, grades II and III. At the molecular level, analysis of the tumors revealed almost complete loss of both NF proteins, despite the fact that transcript levels were increased, implying posttranscriptional regulation. Although Erk and Akt signaling are typically enhanced in NF-associated tumors, we observed no activation of either of these pathways in TEC3KO tumors. Furthermore, the small G proteins Ras, Rac1, and RhoA are all known to be involved with NF signaling. In TEC3KO tumors, all three molecules showed modest increases in total protein, but only Rac1 showed significant activation. These data suggest that dysregulated protein kinase A activation causes tumorigenesis through pathways that overlap but are distinct from those described in NF tumorigenesis.",,Georgette N Jones; Chhavy Tep; William H Towns; Georgeta Mihai; Ian D Tonks; Graham F Kay; Petra M Schmalbrock; Anat O Stemmer-Rachamimov; Sung Ok Yoon; Lawrence S Kirschner,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",2008-11,10.1593/neo.08652,abstract_only,False
PMID:24848258,Merlin deficiency predicts FAK inhibitor sensitivity: a synthetic lethal relationship.,"The goal of targeted therapy is to match a selective drug with a genetic lesion that predicts for drug sensitivity. In a diverse panel of cancer cell lines, we found that the cells most sensitive to focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibition lack expression of the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene product, Merlin. Merlin expression is often lost in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), an asbestos-induced aggressive cancer with limited treatment options. Our data demonstrate that low Merlin expression predicts for increased sensitivity of MPM cells to a FAK inhibitor, VS-4718, in vitro and in tumor xenograft models. Disruption of MPM cell-cell or cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) contacts with blocking antibodies suggests that weak cell-cell adhesions in Merlin-negative MPM cells underlie their greater dependence on cell-ECM-induced FAK signaling. This provides one explanation of why Merlin-negative cells are vulnerable to FAK inhibitor treatment. Furthermore, we validated aldehyde dehydrogenase as a marker of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in MPM, a cell population thought to mediate tumor relapse after chemotherapy. Whereas pemetrexed and cisplatin, standard-of-care agents for MPM, enrich for CSCs, FAK inhibitor treatment preferentially eliminates these cells. These preclinical results provide the rationale for a clinical trial in MPM patients using a FAK inhibitor as a single agent after first-line chemotherapy. With this design, the FAK inhibitor could potentially induce a more durable clinical response through reduction of CSCs along with a strong antitumor effect. Furthermore, our data suggest that patients with Merlin-negative tumors may especially benefit from FAK inhibitor treatment.","Materials and Methods Study design Mouse models of mesothelioma, human MPM patient derived xenografts, MSTO-211H, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 s.c. xenograft experiments are described in detail in the  Supplementary Methods . Briefly, endpoints of each study included assessment of the anti-tumor activity of compounds based on tumor growth inhibition (TGI) at the end of the study and quantification of pFAK-Y397 in tumor samples. For s.c. models, animals were randomized into treatment or control groups when tumors reached approximately 125–250 mm 3  and dosing was initiated. All of the studies were powered to have an 80% (1−β) chance of detecting a significant difference in tumor burden at the end of the study specifying α = 0.05 (two-tailed testing). Control cohorts had tight tumor growth curves, allowing to be adequately powered with experimental recipient cohorts of average size n = 5–10. Original data for animal studies are provided in  Table S1 . For mouse models of mesothelioma, all animal experiments were performed in accordance with the regulations of Fox Chase Cancer Center’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Cell culture and compound treatment Cell lines used in this study and culture conditions are described in the  Supplementary Methods . Cells were treated with VS-4718, pemetrexed, cisplatin, vinorelbine or gemcitabine for 4 days. VS-4718, pemetrexed, vinorelbine or gemcitabine were added at 15 μl/well in a 96-well plate as 10X DMSO solution (n=6 per concentration point). Cisplatin was diluted from 10X NaCl stock solution. Plasmids, virus production and infection of target cells The pMXs-NF2-IRES-GFP construct was generated by inserting  NF2  cDNA (Open Biosystems, MHS1011-202832561) into pMXs-IRES-GFP retroviral vector (Cell Biolabs). Retroviral packaging, infection, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) were performed as previously described ( 22 ). FAK siRNA A mix of four individual PTK2 siRNAs (ON-TARGETplus PTK2 siRNA; Dharmacon, Thermo Scientific) was used for depletion of FAK in mesothelioma cell lines using DharmaFECT reagent as described in the ‘siRNA Transfection with DharmaFECT Protocol’. siGENOME Non-Targeting siRNA #1was used as a negative control. Statistics Shapiro-Wilk normality test was used to determine whether the data was normally distributed. Unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction or a one-way ANOVA was used to determine statistical significance of the results for normally-distributed datasets. Mann Whitney test or Kruskal-Wallis test was used to determine significance of non-normally distributed data. α = 0.05 (two-tailed testing) was used for all statistical measurements.

PMID:33279959,"Stepwise crosstalk between aberrant Nf1, Tp53 and Rb signalling pathways induces gliomagenesis in zebrafish.","The molecular pathogenesis of glioblastoma indicates that RTK/Ras/PI3K, RB and TP53 pathways are critical for human gliomagenesis. Here, several transgenic zebrafish lines with single or multiple deletions of nf1, tp53 and rb1 in astrocytes, were established to genetically induce gliomagenesis in zebrafish. In the mutant with a single deletion, we found only the nf1 mutation low-efficiently induced tumour incidence, suggesting that the Nf1 pathway is critical for the initiation of gliomagenesis in zebrafish. Combination of mutations, nf1;tp53 and rb1;tp53 combined knockout fish, showed much higher tumour incidences, high-grade histology, increased invasiveness, and shortened survival time. Further bioinformatics analyses demonstrated the alterations in RTK/Ras/PI3K, cell cycle, and focal adhesion pathways, induced by abrogated nf1, tp53, or rb1, were probably the critical stepwise biological events for the initiation and development of gliomagenesis in zebrafish. Gene expression profiling and histological analyses showed the tumours derived from zebrafish have significant similarities to the subgroups of human gliomas. Furthermore, temozolomide treatment effectively suppressed gliomagenesis in these glioma zebrafish models, and the histological responses in temozolomide-treated zebrafish were similar to those observed in clinically treated glioma patients. Thus, our findings will offer a potential tool for genetically investigating gliomagenesis and screening potential targeted anti-tumour compounds for glioma treatment.","Materials and methods Strains, husbandry, breeding and drug treatment The wild-type zebrafish line (AB strain) and  Tg ( gfap : GFP ) transgenic fish ( Bernardos and Raymond, 2006 ) were obtained from the China Zebrafish Resource Center (Wuhan, China), and raised according to the guidelines for zebrafish care ( Westerfield, 2007 ). Fish were maintained in a large-scale water-recirculating system under a 14-h light/10-h dark cycle at 28°C. The juvenile and adult fish (>15 days post-fertilization; dpf) were kept in system water (40 g sea salts/l in deionized water, pH 7.0, salinity 0.03%, and conductivity 500 μS) in serial tanks at densities of five fish per litre (60 fish/12 l). The fish were fed two to three times daily with a rich supply of freshly hatched brine shrimp. For zebrafish breeding, the healthy fish (three males and three females) at 3–4 months of age were selected to produce embryos in each breeding tank on the day before breeding. Following the start of the next light cycle, the embryos were collected by siphoning the bottom of the tank. The embryos (≤4 dpf) and larvae (5–15 dpf) were maintained in E3 embryonic medium (5 mM NaCl, 0.17 mM KCl, 0.33 mM CaCl 2  and 0.33 mM MgSO 4  in deionized water) with 10 −5 % methylene blue in 90-mm Petri dishes (50 embryos or 10 larvae per dish) at 28°C, and fed with paramecia (4–9 dpf) and brine shrimp (10–15 dpf) three times daily. For temozolomide (TMZ) treatment, TMZ (MedChemExpress) was dissolved in 10% dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), and the larvae at 14 dpf were treated with TMZ for 3 months at a final concentration of 100 µm/l—which does not appreciably affect the embryonic development of wild-type zebrafish ( Geiger  )—and then processed for histological analysis. The tank water and TMZ were refreshed daily. The animal experiments were performed according to the protocol, and approved by Shantou University Medical College. et al. , 2008 Synthesis of mRNA and guide RNA 
 Cas9  mRNA was produced by  in vitro  transcription from a pCS2 Cas9 vector ( Jao  ) using a mMESSAGE mMACHINE et al. , 2013 TM  SP6 kit (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Guide RNAs (gRNAs) were designed using the CHOPCHOP website ( http://chopchop.cbu.uib.no/ ). The gRNA transcription templates were prepared through PCR amplification using T7-targetsite-F primers and the universal reverse primer gRNA-R ( Supplementary Table 1 ), and gRNAs were transcribed using the MAXIscript T7 kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The pCS-TP vector was linearized using NotI endonuclease (New England Biolabs), cleaned up by phenol/chloroform extraction, and synthesized from linearized vectors using mMESSAGE mMACHINE TM  T7 Kit (Invitrogen). All mRNA transcripts were purified using MicroElute RNA Clean-Up kit (Omega Bio-Tek). The quality and concentration of RNA were analysed by electrophoresis and NanoDrop TM  2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The  in vitro  efficiencies of the gRNAs were examined using a gRNA Activity Detection kit (ViewSolid Biotech). DNA construction and microinjection We cloned the zebrafish  U6-3  promoter ( Halbig  ) from the AB strain, followed by an NheI site, into the CRISPR/Cas9 skeleton vector ( et al. , 2008 Cas9-T2A-mCherry ) from the Tol2 kit ( Kwan  ) using ClaI and KpnI endonucleases (New England Biolabs). The sequences of gRNA were then inserted in  et al ., 2007 Cas9-T2A-mCherry , U6  to construct  Cas9-T2A-mCherry , U6 : gRNA  vectors, respectively including  gfap : Cas9-T2A-mCherry,U6 : gRNA ( nf1a ),  gfap : Cas9-T2A-mCherry,U6 : gRNA ( tp53 ), and  gfap : Cas9-T2A-mCherry,U6 : gRNA ( rb1 ) vectors, and  gfap : Cas9-T2A-mCherry,U6 : gRNA ( null ) as control. Ultimately, we cleaved the  gfap  promoter from  Tg ( gfap : GFP ) fish followed by  Xhol  and  Agel  sites ( Bernardos and Raymond, 2006 ), and subcloned the  gfap  promoter sequence into  Cas9-T2A-mCherry,U6 : gRNA  vectors using T4 DNA ligase (Thermo Fisher Scientific), respectively. The AB strains were bred and their embryos were collected for microinjection. Specifically, the mixture with 20 pg DNA construct and 20-pg  Tol2  mRNA was injected into the embryos at the one-cell stage. For typical CRISPR experiments, the mixture with 600 pg  Cas9  mRNA and 25 pg gRNA was injected into each embryo. Following microinjection, all embryos were raised in E3 medium at 28°C. The details of DNA construction and the generation and identification of tissue-specific gene mutation in zebrafish are provided in the  Supplementary material . Analysis of gRNA efficiency, T7 endonuclease I mutagenesis assay and whole-mount  in situ  hybridization The gRNA target site and primer sequences used for the T7E1 assays are shown in  Supplementary Table 1 . Genomic DNA was extracted from 15 embryos using a standard DNA extraction protocol following co-microinjection of gRNA- and  Cas9 -capped RNA at 24 h post-fertilization (hpf). PCR mixtures were then prepared using the TransFast ®  Taq DNA polymerase (TransGen Biotech). PCR products (8.5 µl) were then annealed for heteroduplex formation. T7 endonuclease I buffer (1 µl) and 0.5 ml T7 endonuclease I (ViewSolid Biotech) were added to the solution described above, and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 25 min. The samples were analysed using 2% agarose gels and observed with a gel imaging system (Junyi). To confirm the efficiency of gRNAs, 2 ml of PCR products was cloned into the pMD-19T vector (Takara Bio) for DNA sequencing. Whole-mount  in situ  hybridization assay of  tp53 ,  nf1a  or  rb1  was performed as previously described ( Padmanabhan  ). The sense and antisense RNA probes were synthesized using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE et al. , 2009 TM  T7 Kit (Invitrogen).  In situ  hybridization was carried out following the previous protocol ( Thisse and Thisse, 2008 ). Histological examination, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and whole-mount embryonic imaging The whole brain tissue specimens from the euthanized transgenic zebrafish were dissected, paraformaldehyde-fixed, and paraffin-embedded for haematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry. The immunohistochemistry of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections was carried out as previously described ( Barash  ). Following antigen retrieval and blocking, 4-mm sections were immunostained using the primary antibodies and the corresponding secondary antibodies, and were detected using the avidin-biotin complex method (Dako), and visualized with DAB. The slides were lightly counterstained with haematoxylin, and the staining was evaluated with Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics Inc.). The paraffin-embedded tissue microarray of human glioma specimens was purchased from Outdo Biotech Ltd (HbraG180Su01). The ethics approval was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Shantou University Medical College. et al. , 2019 The glioma formation developed by the fish was preliminarily estimated based on the ‘bending-body’ phenotype before post-mortem histological analysis, and confirmed by haematoxylin and eosin staining. The histological grades varied from I to IV of brain harboured gliomas and were further diagnosed by the pathologist according to the WHO classification and as previously described ( Jung  ;  et al. , 2013 Villa  ). For example, advanced histological grade glioma is usually accompanied by larger tumours, hypercellularity, enhanced necrosis and vascularity, and frequent mitosis, as well as robust expression of gliomagenesis-related factors, including Gfap, Pcna, phh3, pAkt, and Nestin. et al. , 2018 Immunofluorescence was performed using 25-mm cryosections of 4% paraformaldehyde-fixed tissues as previously described ( Luo  ). The sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with the primary antibodies in blocking buffer. The sections were then washed six times with PBS containing 0.5% Triton et al. , 2018 TM  X-100 at room temperature for 15 min, incubated with the secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h, washed with PBS, and sealed with coverslips. The immunostained sections were observed and photographed under a confocal microscope (FV1000; Olympus). The whole-embryonic fluorescent images were obtained using an Olympus MVX10 fluorescence microscope. All information on the antibodies and the concentrations used are provided in  Supplementary Table 2 . Quantitative RT-PCR assay The dissected brain tissues from 3-month-old fish were used for quantitative PCR. Samples were collected from three or four fish belonging to each group, and used for total RNA extraction with TRIzol TM  reagent (Invitrogen). The extracted RNA was reverse-transcribed by qRT-PCR assay using QuantiTect TM  SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen), and amplified by 7300 Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). All experiments were performed three times using separately prepared samples. The sequences of the primers used in qRT-RCR assay are provided in  Supplementary Table 1 . Western blot analysis The dissected brain tissues from 3-month-old fish were lysed in RIPA buffer containing 1% PMSF (Solarbio). Samples were collected from three or four fish, separated with electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore). The membranes were incubated with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-based saline-Tween 20 (TBST; 0.2 M Tris, 1.37 M NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 at pH 7.6), and the primary antibodies at 4°C overnight. After washing with TBST, the membranes were then incubated with the secondary antibodies, and visualized using a SuperSignal TM  West Pico Substrate Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All the experiments were repeated independently three times. All the information on the antibodies and the utilized concentrations are provided in  Supplementary Table 2 . Global transcriptome sequencing and analyses Total RNA from each group was isolated using the TRIzol TM  reagent, and sequenced by BGI Company. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering (UHC) analyses were performed to calculate the median absolute deviation score for each probe set using the log 2 -transformed data, and the top 1000 most variable probe sets were selected. The analysis was performed using GeneMaths software (Applied Maths, Inc., Austin, TX) with Pearson correlation as the similarity coefficient and Ward as the clustering method. The enrichment of signature genes in the tumour subgroups identified by UHC in our models was assessed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) ( Subramanian  ). We generated gene sets using the gene signatures that define previously identified glioma subgroups ( et al. , 2005 Freije  ;  et al. , 2004 Phillips  ;  et al. , 2006 Verhaak  ), and performed GSEA analysis of tumours to compare one subgroup with the other two subgroups. A nominal  et al. , 2010 P -value of <0.2 obtained in GSEA was considered to indicate statistical significance. Behavioural tests The motor capabilities of the larvae in different groups were evaluated using a behavioural tracking system (Noldus). In each trial, the 7 dpf larvae of different experimental groups were carefully transferred to a 24-well plate with one single larva in each well. The plate was placed into an observation chamber, the swim path of individual larvae was recorded with an infrared video camera for 6.5 min, and the travelling distance of each larva was analysed using DanioVision software (Noldus). Briefly, basal activity in the darkened chamber was recorded for 30 s, followed by a 0.2-s exposure to a 500-lx white light stimulus, and repeated the next 30 s in the dark. DanioVision software quantified larval motor activity by assessing changes in infrared image pixel intensity (on a scale of 1 to 256) of all pixels corresponding to the image area of its circular well between sequential video sweeps (every 40 ms). Quantification and statistical analysis The results were analysed using SPSS 10.0 statistical software (SPSS, Chicago, IL), and presented as the arithmetic means and standard error (SE). Student’s  t -test was used for the statistical analyses.  P  <   0.05 was regarded as indicating statistical significance.

PMID:38140900,Recommendations for assessing appearance concerns related to plexiform and cutaneous neurofibromas in neurofibromatosis 1 clinical trials.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Individuals with neurofibromatosis 1 may experience changes in their appearance due to physical manifestations of the disorders and/or treatment sequelae. Appearance concerns related to these physical changes can lead to psychological distress and poorer quality of life. While many neurofibromatosis 1 clinical trials focus on assessing changes in tumor volume, evaluating patients' perspectives on corresponding changes in symptoms such as physical appearance can be key secondary outcomes. We aimed to determine whether any existing patient-reported outcome measures are appropriate for evaluating changes in appearance concerns within neurofibromatosis 1 clinical trials. METHODS: After updating our previously published systematic review process, we used it to identify and rate existing patient-reported outcome measures related to disfigurement and appearance. Using a systematic literature search and initial triage process, we focused on identifying patient-reported outcome measures that could be used to evaluate changes in appearance concerns in plexiform or cutaneous neurofibroma clinical trials in neurofibromatosis 1. Our revised Patient-Reported Outcome Rating and Acceptance Tool for Endpoints then was used to evaluate each published patient-reported outcome measures in five domains, including (1) respondent characteristics, (2) content validity, (3) scoring format and interpretability, (4) psychometric data, and (5) feasibility. The highest-rated patient-reported outcome measures were then re-reviewed in a side-by-side comparison to generate a final consensus recommendation. RESULTS: Eleven measures assessing appearance concerns were reviewed and rated; no measures were explicitly designed to assess appearance concerns related to neurofibromatosis 1. The FACE-Q Craniofacial Module-Appearance Distress scale was the top-rated measure for potential use in neurofibromatosis 1 clinical trials. Strengths of the measure included that it was rigorously developed, included individuals with neurofibromatosis 1 in the validation sample, was applicable to children and adults, covered item topics deemed important by neurofibromatosis 1 patient representatives, exhibited good psychometric properties, and was feasible for use in neurofibromatosis 1 trials. Limitations included a lack of validation in older adults, no published information regarding sensitivity to change in clinical trials, and limited availability in languages other than English. CONCLUSION: The Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis patient-reported outcome working group currently recommends the FACE-Q Craniofacial Module Appearance Distress scale to evaluate patient-reported changes in appearance concerns in clinical trials for neurofibromatosis 1-related plexiform or cutaneous neurofibromas. Additional research is needed to validate this measure in people with neurofibromatosis 1, including older adults and those with tumors in various body locations, and explore the effects of nontumor manifestations on appearance concerns in people with neurofibromatosis 1 and schwannomatosis.","Methods: After updating our previously published systematic review process, we used it to identify and rate existing PRO measures related to disfigurement and appearance. Using a systematic literature search and initial triage process, we focused on identifying PRO measures that could be used to evaluate changes in appearance concerns in plexiform or cutaneous neurofibromas clinical trials in NF1. Our revised Patient-Reported Outcomes Rating and Acceptance Tool for Endpoints then was used to evaluate each published PRO measures in five domains, including (1) respondent characteristics, (2) content validity, (3) scoring format and interpretability, (4) psychometric data and (5) feasibility. The highest-rated PRO measures were then re-reviewed in a side-by-side comparison to generate a final consensus recommendation. Methods The Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) PRO working group was established to support the identification and use of appropriate PRO measures in neurofibromatosis and schwannomatosis clinical trials using a consensus-based and scientifically rigorous process.  REiNS PRO group members include clinicians and researchers with expertise in neurofibromatosis and schwannomatosis (including pediatrics, neurology, genetics, psychology, speech-language pathology, and health services research) and patient representatives (including adults with neurofibromatosis and schwannomatosis and caregivers of children with neurofibromatosis and schwannomatosis). We used a systematic process to identify, review, and rate existing PRO measures related to appearance concerns. This process was based on previously described procedures, 11  with modifications to the search strategy and rating forms to align our process with the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) initiative and to formalize the process for patient representative input. 15 – 17 18 ,  19 Development of updated PRO rating forms We modified our previous rating form – the PRO Rating and Acceptance Tool for Endpoints  to: 1) explicitly identify domains related to content validity and scoring interpretability, 2) add relevant rating criteria within these two domains aligned with international standards, 11  and 3) remove “use in published studies” as a separate domain and instead extract relevant data from published studies to support ratings in other domains. We also created a companion user guide to systematize data extraction related to each PRO measure; this guide included detailed examples of extracted data and relevant instructional material from other published criteria to evaluate health measures. 19 19 – 21 The revised PRO Rating and Acceptance Tool for Endpoints consists of five domains ( Table 1 ), including: (1) respondent characteristics; (2) content validity (including assessment of the PRO measure development process and expert-assessed relevance, comprehensiveness, and comprehensibility of items as they pertain to neurofibromatosis and schwannomatosis clinical trials); (3) scoring format and interpretability (e.g., description of response options, type of scores available, availability of normative data, and rates of missing data and floor/ceiling effects in published studies); (4) psychometric data (reliability, structural validity, construct validity, criterion validity, and responsiveness); and (5) feasibility (cost, length, recall period used, ease of administration and scoring, languages available). Each criterion is rated on a scale of 0 (no or poor data) to 3 (solid published data supporting use in neurofibromatosis and schwannomatosis trials) in increments of 0.25 points by individual REiNS group members. After a group discussion of each measure over videoconference, individuals may update their scores, which are then averaged to provide an overall group rating. In addition, we created a companion PRO Rating and Acceptance Tool for Endpoints form for lay reviewers to facilitate patient representative involvement in the measure review process ( Table 2 ). This form was iteratively refined based on feedback from our group’s patient representatives to highlight the specific domains of the PRO Rating and Acceptance Tool for Endpoints form that benefit from patient representative input (i.e., content validity, adequacy of response options, and feasibility) and explain these domains in lay terms. Given that most PRO measures identified within relevant trial endpoint domains are not designed for or tested in neurofibromatosis and schwannomatosis patients, input from patient representatives is crucial to judge the content validity and feasibility of these measures for the neurofibromatosis and schwannomatosis population. Patient representatives were instructed to base their feedback on their own (or their child’s) experience completing the measures, as well as how they believe the PRO measures may function for others with neurofibromatosis and schwannomatosis. Patient representatives’ comments are featured during group discussion of each measure’s content validity, scoring interpretability, and feasibility, and their numerical ratings are included in the overall group rating. Identification of candidate PRO measures of appearance concerns A preliminary search for PRO measures assessing disfigurement was conducted by one group member and results were presented to the group in a mini-review; as this process identified a limited number of relevant measures, we expanded our search to examine appearance concerns more broadly. Initial systematic search criteria adapted from Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) initiative were used to identify a list of candidate measures for the construct of  appearance concerns .  The instruments of interest were PRO measures, rather than parent or caregiver proxy forms, with a preference for self-administered questionnaires applicable across the lifespan, as plexiform and cutaneous neurofibroma clinical trials include both children and adults. An initial search of PubMed and PsycINFO databases on July 16, 2020 using the following search string [disfigurement OR “body image” OR appearance OR “body satisfaction” OR cosmetic out* OR “appearance satisfaction” AND questionnaire or survey or scale or instrument AND neurofibromatosis] yielded 49 manuscripts describing seven instruments: the Perceived Stigma Questionnaire, Social Comfort Questionnaire, Body Esteem Scale for Adolescents and Adults, Subjective Happiness Scale, Derriford Appearance Scale, The Self-Description Questionnaire I and Skindex. In reviewing the measures retrieved, many did not appear appropriate for our intended context of use. Therefore, we expanded the search and removed the key term of  18 neurofibromatosis  to determine if a wider search would yield instruments that would be more appropriate for our clinical population. Additional searches of PubMed and PsycINFO were conducted October 26 and November 4, 2020, yielding a total of 38 measures of appearance for potential full review ( Figure 1 ; see  Appendix A  in the supplemental material for full search strategy and list of retrieved measures). PRO measure rating and recommendation process At least two group members reviewed each retrieved PRO measure to determine whether the measure assessed the intended construct of appearance concerns and could be applied to evaluate tumor-related disfigurement; any discrepancies were discussed until consensus was reached. All identified measures of appearance concerns that passed the triaging stage were reviewed and rated using our updated PRO Rating and Acceptance Tool for Endpoints forms for scientific and lay reviewers. The group then re-reviewed the three highest rated PRO measures in a detailed side-by-side comparison to ensure comparable numerical ratings and provide an opportunity to discuss the strengths and limitations of each measure. When deciding on our ultimate recommendations, we focused on identifying PRO measures to evaluate change in appearance concerns within NF1 clinical trials of plexiform and cutaneous neurofibromas rather than for descriptive studies, clinical trials of general chronic illness, or studies of NF1 manifestations that represent less pressing clinical trial targets (such as café-au-lait macules). As no measures were specifically designed for people with NF1, the group’s assessment of the relevance and importance of item content to individuals with NF1 was a priority. NF1 clinical trials for plexiform and cutaneous neurofibromas involve a wide age range of individuals, many of whom have learning disabilities, requiring easy to understand measures with content applicable across the lifespan. For this reason, we prioritized measures suitable for both children/adolescents and adults rather than a single age group. Psychometric properties adequate to support the use of measures as clinical trial endpoints and the feasibility of incorporating measures into multicenter, international clinical trials were also considered.",Vanessa L Merker; Heather L Thompson; Pamela L Wolters; Frank D Buono; Cynthia M Hingtgen; Tena Rosser; Belinda Barton; Carolina Barnett; Taylor Smith; Diana Haberkamp; Miranda L McManus; Andrea Baldwin; Irene P Moss; Claas Röhl; Staci Martin,"Clinical trials (London, England)",2024-02,10.1177/17407745231205577,minimal,True
PMID:34664663,Longitudinal Investigation of Early Motor Development in Neurofibromatosis Type 1.,"OBJECTIVE: Research indicates that children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) have weaknesses in fine and gross motor development in early childhood; however, little is known about the stability and developmental trajectory of motor functioning. We investigated (1) whether motor difficulties are evident and stable in the preschool period in children with NF1 and (2) whether there are particular patterns of motor development in this population. METHODS: Participants with NF1 and a control group of unaffected siblings were enrolled at ages 3-8 years and were assessed yearly. Motor functioning was assessed longitudinally using the Scales of Independent Behavior-Revised Motor Scale and the Differential Ability Scales-II Copying subtest. Wilcoxon sign tests were used to compare motor functioning at 3 or 4 years to 5 or 6 years old for children with NF1 seen during both time periods (N = 27). Linear mixed model growth curve analyses were used to compare trajectories for both children with NF1 (N = 62) and unaffected siblings (N = 37). RESULTS: Children with NF1 made relative gains in raw scores, but not standard scores, across measures. Growth curve analyses revealed a significant effect of NF1 status on gross motor, fine motor, and copying scores, as well as an age by NF1 status effect on fine and gross motor scores. CONCLUSIONS: Motor difficulties are evident early in life in children with NF1. Though children with NF1 clearly acquire motor skills over time, they continue to fall behind unaffected siblings, with the gap potentially widening over time. Further implications are discussed.",,Sara K Pardej; Danielle M Glad; Christina L Casnar; Kelly M Janke; Bonita P Klein-Tasman,Journal of pediatric psychology,2022-02-14,10.1093/jpepsy/jsab090,abstract_only,False
PMID:19041782,Nf1 mutation expands an EGFR-dependent peripheral nerve progenitor that confers neurofibroma tumorigenic potential.,"Defining growth factor requirements for progenitors facilitates their characterization and amplification. We characterize a peripheral nervous system embryonic dorsal root ganglion progenitor population using in vitro clonal sphere-formation assays. Cells differentiate into glial cells, smooth muscle/fibroblast (SM/Fb)-like cells, and neurons. Genetic and pharmacologic tools revealed that sphere formation requires signaling from the EGFR tyrosine kinase. Nf1 loss of function amplifies this progenitor pool, which becomes hypersensitive to growth factors and confers tumorigenesis. DhhCre;Nf1(fl/fl) mouse neurofibromas contain a progenitor population with similar growth requirements, potential, and marker expression. In humans, NF1 mutation predisposes to benign neurofibromas, incurable peripheral nerve tumors. Prospective identification of human EGFR(+);P75(+) neurofibroma cells enriched EGF-dependent sphere-forming cells. Neurofibroma spheres contain glial-like progenitors that differentiate into neurons and SM/Fb-like cells in vitro and form benign neurofibroma-like lesions in nude mice. We suggest that expansion of an EGFR-expressing early glial progenitor contributes to neurofibroma formation.","EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Animals We maintained mice per guidelines of the Animal Use and Care Committee at the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center. We mated  Nf1 +/−  C57Bl/6 females ( Brannan et al., 1994 ) with  Nf1  129X1/SvJ  +/− Nf1  males (Jackson; Bar Harbor, ME). For timed dissections, the morning on which a vaginal plug was observed was E0.5.  +/− DhhCre;Nf1  mice were generated as described ( fl/fl Wu et al., 2008 ). Sphere culture For primary cultures, we dissociated DRG from E12.5–13.5 embryos with 0.25% Trypsin (Mediatech; Herndon, VA) for 20 min. at 37° C and obtained single-cell suspensions with narrow-bore pipettes and a 40 μm strainer (BD-Falcon). For postnatal mouse sciatic nerve dissection, we chopped tissue into 1–3 mm 3  pieces, plated in sphere medium for 3 days, centrifuged and resuspended in L-15 (Mediatech) plus 0.5 mg/ml collagenase type 1 (Worthington; Lakewood, NJ), and 2.5 mg/ml dispase protease type II (Cambrex; East Rutherford, NJ) at 37°C for 25 min. For all mouse cells, we used trypan blue exclusion (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC) to plate 2 × 10 4  live cells per well in 24-well plates in sphere medium. Sphere medium (modified from  Fernandes et al., 2004 ): DMEM:F-12 (3:1) + 20 ng/ml rhEGF (R&D Systems), 20 ng/ml rh bFGF (R&D Systems), 1% B-27 (Invitrogen), 2 μg/ml heparin (Sigma). We maintained cultures at 37° C and 5% CO 2  and counted floating spheres after 14 days. Half of the volume was removed and replaced with fresh medium every 4 days, taking care to centrifuge the used medium and collect any cells or spheres that may have been floating to return to the plate. To passage, we centrifuged sphere cultures, treated with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA for 3 min., dissociated and plated at 2 × 10 4  cells/ml in 50% conditioned and 50% fresh medium. We counted secondary spheres after 14 days. For EGFR inhibition experiments, erlotinib (Genentech; San Francisco, CA), was dissolved in DMSO, added at 3 μM, and replenished in fresh medium every 3 days. For each experiment, we show a representative of >3 independent experiments. Human neurofibroma culture We obtained human plexiform neurofibromas incidental to therapeutic surgery and after IRB approval. We cut tumors into 1 mm 3  pieces in L-15 supplemented with Pen/Strep (Mediatech), Gentomycin, Collagenase Type I, and Dispase protease II. We dissociated tumors at 37°C for 4 h. For sphere formation, we plated 4 × 10 4  cells per well in 24-well plates, and counted spheres after 21 days. Human sphere medium was DMEM/F-12 (1:1) + 1% N2 supplements, 1% B27, 20 ng/ml EGF, 20 ng/ml bFGF, 0.1 mM β-ME (Sigma), 2 μg/ml Heparin (Sigma). EGF and EGFR inhibitor application was as for mouse. The monoclonal antibody Cetuximab was also used at 5 μg/ml (ImClone). For culture details, see  Supplemental Table 1 . For immunocytochemistry, we seeded spheres onto poly-L-lysine (PLL) and laminin-coated Lab-tek II tissue culture plates (Nalge Nunc, Rochester, NY). Differentiation conditions were as for mouse. CAFC Assay We collected 6,000 triple-positive cells and plated them at 8 concentrations (200 cells per well through 1.6 cells per well; 15 wells per dilution) to identify hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells ( Geiger et al., 2001 ). We scored for clones 3 times per week for 7 weeks. Mouse neurofibroma culture DhhCre;Nf1  tumors were dissociated in the same manner as human tumors, filtered with 40 micron cell strainers, and plated in mouse sphere medium; differentiation and immunocytochemistry were conducted as above. Spheres were dissociated as above and split after 10 – 14 days; feeding was the same as for embryonic sphere cultures. fl/fl Lentiviral eGFP generation and infection We produced lentivirus particles encoding GFP by transient co-transfection of 293T cells, as described ( Arumugam et al., 2007 ). We dissociated spheres and plated 1.0 × 10 3  cells in 96-well plates in 200 μl sphere proliferation medium. After 24 hours we removed growth medium, added a minimal volume (~50–100 μl) of purified virus at an MOI of 10 and incubated at 37° C. We removed virus-containing medium the next day and applied fresh sphere medium. Clonality Assay We combined equal ratios of lentivirally labeled, eGFP +  cells and unlabeled cells from the same embryo and replated cells from dissociated mouse spheres at limiting dilutions on PLL coated chamber slides. We validated single-cell plating. After 10 days percentages of adherent single-color and mixed spheres were scored. We dissociated and replated spheres from wells yielding only single-color spheres. All samples gave rise to secondary spheres. FACS analysis We incubated neurofibroma cell suspensions with mouse anti-human monoclonal antibodies against CD34 (8G12/HPCA-2, Becton-Dickinson; San Jose, CA) bound to allophycocyanin (APC), p75/NGFR (C40–1457, Becton-Dickinson) bound to phycoerythrin (PE) and EGFR (EGFR1, Research Diagnostics Inc; Flanders, NJ) bound to FITC and anti-CD16/CD32 antibody (Becton-Dickinson) to block Fc gamma receptor unspecific binding, on ice in a solution containing PBS/0.2%BSA/0.01% NaN 3  for 30 minutes. After washing, we resuspended cells in PBS/0.2%BSA/0.01% NaN 3 /2 μg/mL 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD, Invitrogen). We carried out isotipic controls with irrelevant mouse IgG1-APC, mouse-IgG1-PE and mouse IgG2b-FITC in parallel. We acquired cell suspensions in a dual-laser (Argon 488 and dye laser 630 or HeNe 633) FACSCalibur or FACSCanto (Becton-Dickinson) and analyzed on an “alive” gate based on light scatter parameters and 7-AAD staining negativity. We used the same incubation conditions to isolate cell populations (positive and negative for the antigens CD34, p75/NGFR and/or EGFR) by FACS. We acquired cells in a FACSVantage DiVa equipped with a 488 nm-Argon laser, a 633 nm-HeNe laser and a tunable Argon-UV laser, sorting a total of 6×10 6  cells at one time. In vitro  differentiation We plated DRG-derived spheres on PLL and laminin-coated chamber slides. Base medium was DMEM: F-12 (3:1), + 10% FBS. For neurons, + 40 ng/ml bFGF for 5 days only, then +10 ng/ml each NT-3 and BDNF (R&D Systems), and NGF (Harlan) for 7 days ( Fernandes et al., 2004 ). For glia, +5 ng/ml recombinant humanβ-heregulin and 2 μM forskolin (both R&D Systems) for 10 days (Ratner et al., 2006). For smooth muscle fibroblasts, +40 ng/ml bFGF for 5 days only, then + 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 7 days ( Chen et al., 2004 ). For all conditions, we changed medium every 3 days. Immunocytochemistry Following fixation, we permeablized cells with 0.2% TX 100 and blocked with 10% normal serum for one hour at room temperature. Primary antibodies were: goat anti-EGFR (Santa Cruz, SC-03-G, 1:10), rabbit anti-P75 (Chemicon 1:400), mouse anti-β-Tubulin (Chemicon 1:200), rabbit anti-S100β (DAKO 1:2000), mouse anti-SMA (Sigma 1:500), and rabbit anti-NF-M (Chemicon, 1:200). Secondary incubations were with host-appropriate FITC or TRITC (Jackson Immunoresearch; West Grove, PA). We labeled nuclei with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO). We acquired microscopic images with Openlab software suites on a Zeiss Axiovert 200. Tumorigenisis assay in nude mice We anaesthetized athymic nu/nu mice in isoflurane and subcutaneously injected 1–4.5 × 10 5  mouse or human sphere cells/injection into left flanks. Tumors were monitored weekly. We dissected visible tumors and fixed them in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, then embedded in paraffin. We stained 6uM sections with hematoxylin and eosin, anti-S100β (1:2000, DAKO) and anti-neurofilament (1:2000, Chemicon) visualized with HRP-conjugated goat anti rabbit antibody with diaminobenzidine reaction. RT- PCR We isolated total RNA from spheres (RNeasy mini-kit, Qiagen) and made cDNA (Superscript III RT, Invitrogen). We conducted RT-PCR as described ( Miller et al., 2003 ). Mouse sequences and protocols for  Twist1, Nestin, Wnt5a, P75, Sox9,  and  Mpz  are published ( Fernandes et al., 2004 )as are mouse  Egfr  ( Represa et al., 2001 ), mouse and human  BLBP  ( Miller et al., 2003 ), and human P75 ( Toma et al., 2005 ).

PMID:38900740,Revisiting the NPcis mouse model: A new tool to model plexiform neurofibroma.,"Neurofibromatosis Type I (NF1) is a rare genetic disorder. NF1 patients frequently develop a benign tumor in peripheral nerve plexuses called plexiform neurofibroma. In the past two decades, tissue-specific Nf1 knockout mouse models were developed using commercially available tissue-specific Cre recombinase and the Nf1 flox mice to mimic neurofibroma development. However, these models develop para-spinal neurofibroma, recapitulating a rare type of neurofibroma found in NF1 patients. The NPcis mouse model developed a malignant version of neurofibroma called malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) within 3 to 6 months but intriguingly without apparent benign precursor lesion. Here, we revisited the NPcis model and discovered that about 20% display clinical signs similar to Nf1 tissue-specific knockout mice models. However, a systematic histological analysis could not explain the clinical signs we observed although we noticed lesions reminiscent of a neurofibroma in a peripheral nerve, a cutaneous neurofibroma, and para-spinal neurofibroma on rare occasions in NPcis mice. We also observed that 10% of the mice developed a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) spontaneously, coinciding with their earring tag identification. Strikingly, half of the sciatic nerves from NPcis mice developed plexiform neurofibroma within 1-6 months when intentionally injured. Thus, we provided a procedure to turn the widely used NPcis sarcoma model into a model recapitulating plexiform neurofibroma.","Methods Mice All mice were housed in the Animal Care Facility at the Université de Sherbrooke. We follow the principles of laboratory animal care (NIH publication No. 86–23, revised 1985). All procedures were approved by the Animal Research Ethics Committee of the Université de Sherbrooke in accordance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care standards. All mouse strains were maintained in a room with 12/12 (day/night) light cycle with a temperature of 70-72°F. NPcis and Hoxb7-cre  Nf1 
 f/f  mice were rederived on C57bl/6 background. Genotyping was performed by PCR as reported elsewhere [ 14 ,  21 ]. The investigators were not blinded to the group allocation during the experiment. No mice were excluded for any reason. When a point limit or end of the experiment is reached, mice are euthanized using isoflurane 5% mixed with oxygen (1–2 L/min), followed by asphyxiation using CO 2 . Tissues are collected and whole spinal cord dissection is performed as described elsewhere [ 23 ]. To perform sciatic nerve-induced injury, one-month-old mice were anesthetized by isoflurane 5% mixed with oxygen (1–2 L/min) and subsequently placed on a warmed surgery plate maintained around 85°F and mounted with a mask to maintain anesthesia (2% isoflurane). A cream is applied to the eyes to prevent dryness. The lower back is shaved and subsequently depilated using the NAIR ™  cream. Excess is removed after 1–2 min. A skin incision was made above the sciatic nerve using extra fine Bonn scissors (#14084–08). Upon locating the sciatic nerve in the quadricep muscle cavity with a fine curved twizzer (#91117–10). For the “needle” strategy, a 27G needle was used to perforate the sciatic nerve and disrupt the nerve fibers longitudinally in a few bundles. For the “cut” strategy, the peroneal and tibial nerve were cut at the sciatic nerve ramification (sparing the sural nerve) using extra fine Bonn scissors (#14084–08). The sciatic nerve was placed back in the muscle cavity. The skin was sutured using monocryl 4–0 wire (adsorbable). At the end of the surgery, the mask is removed, and the mouse is allowed to recover on the warmed plate until the mouse is ambulant. Mice are closely follow-up for tumor formation. Histological characterization Tissues were fixed in 10% formalin-buffered solution for at least 48 hours and subsequently washed with EtOH 70%. Then all samples were transferred to the Histology Research Core of the FMSS at the Université de Sherbrooke, for their circulation and inclusion. Briefly, tissues were paraffin-embedded (Thermo Fischer Varistain or Citadel 2000), were sectioned at 5 μm using a microtome (Leica Histocore Multicut) and were allowed to dry on Diamond white glass microscope slides (Globe Scientific; #1358W) at room temperature (r.t.). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed using Gill 3 hematoxylin (Thermo Scientific, 72604), followed by short washes with acidic water and ammoniacal water and eosin-Y in 1% alcoholic solution (Fischer Scientific, #245827) as counterstaining. Mast cell staining was performed using a solution of 0,1% toluidine blue followed by overnight air drying. For immunohistochemistry, the Vecta Stain Elite ABC kit (Vectorlabs, PK-6100) was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The following primary antibodies were used in the immunohistochemistry studies: S100 (Agilent Technologies, GA-50461-2); desmin (abcam, ab15200); SMA (GeneTex, GTX100034); Nf1 (Santa Cruz, sc-376886); p53 (Santa Cruz, sc-126); Iba1 (Fujifilm, 019–19741). The pathologist (S. Geha) reviewed the histologies. For immunohistochemistries in “Fig 4c”, slides were treated with a solution of 3% H 2 O 2  in NaOH 0.5N for 20 min to depigment the skin. qPCR qPCR was performed using gene-specific primers and cDNA from RNA extracted from FFPE (formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded) histology slides based on the RNeasy FFPE kit (Qiagen; 73504). Briefly, a scalpel was used to grossly dissect the tissue of interest from FFPE slides (3 slides per tissue/mouse were pooled for each replicate) and process following the manufacturer`s recommendation using xylene as the deparaffinization solution, proteinase K in Tris Guanidinium thiocyanate 4M as the lysis solution (15 min, 55°C, then 15 min, 80°C) and NH 4 Cl 5M as the demodification solution (20 min, 95°C) as previously done [ 24 ]. The resulting column-based purified total RNA extract was quantified using Nanodrop and 150 ng from each sample were submitted to a reverse transcription reaction using Roche Transcriptor ™  and N6 random primers. Finally, cDNA was diluted with 440 uL of RNase DNase free water and used as template for a qPCR reaction using primers specific for  Nf1  (Nf1_F  5`-GCAACTTGCCACTCCCTACTGA-3` ; Nf1_R  5`- ATGCTGTTCTGAGGGAAACGCT-3` );  p53  (p53_F  5`-CTGCACTTGGATCGGGAAGT-3` ; p53_R  5`- GCCACGAAAACAAAGTCCCC-3` ) and  GAPDH  (GAPDH_F  5`-TGACGTGCCGCCTGGAGAAA-3` ; GAPDH_R  5`- TGACGTGCCGCCTGGAGAAA-3` ) as housekeeping gene in the 2X SyBr Green mix buffer (Quantabio, 95054-02K) under the following cycling conditions: 95°C, 3min; [(95°C, 15sec, 60°C, 30sec, 72°C, 30sec) X 50], 72°C, 5min. Relative expression was calculated using qBase [ 25 ]. Statistical analyses A Fischer exact t-test “Figs  1d  and 5b” or a one-way ANOVA “Fig 7c” was performed to determine if the two groups were different (P = 0.05 or below). 10.1371/journal.pone.0301040.g001 Fig 1 NPcis derived sarcoma penetrance and tissue distribution. a-c  Pie chart representing the  a  percentage of mice developing sarcomas,  b  the sarcoma tissue sub-location and  c  the sarcoma body distribution.  d  Sarcoma incidence in relation to mouse sex.

PMID:18442999,Nf1+/- mice have increased neointima formation via hyperactivation of a Gleevec sensitive molecular pathway.,"Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene. Neurofibromin is encoded by NF1 and functions as a negative regulator of Ras activity. Somatic mutations in the residual normal NF1 allele within cancers of NF1 patients is consistent with NF1 functioning as a tumor-suppressor. However, the prevalent non-malignant manifestations of NF1, including learning and bone disorders emphasize the importance of dissecting the cellular and biochemical effects of NF1 haploinsufficiency in multiple cell lineages. One of the least studied complications of NF1 involves cardiovascular disorders, including arterial occlusions that result in cerebral and visceral infarcts. NF1 vasculopathy is characterized by vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) accumulation in the intima area of vessels resulting in lumen occlusion. We recently showed that Nf1 haploinsufficiency increases VSMC proliferation and migration via hyperactivation of the Ras-Erk pathway, which is a signaling axis directly linked to neointima formation in diverse animal models of vasculopathy. Given this observation, we tested whether heterozygosity of Nf1 would lead to vaso-occlusive disease in genetically engineered mice in vivo. Strikingly, Nf1+/- mice have increased neointima formation, excessive vessel wall cell proliferation and Erk activation after vascular injury in vivo. Further, this effect is directly dependent on a Gleevec sensitive molecular pathway. Therefore, these studies establish an Nf1 model of vasculopathy, which mirrors features of human NF1 vaso-occlusive disease, identifies a potential therapeutic target and provides a platform to further dissect the effect of Nf1 haploinsufficiency in cardiovascular disease.",,Elisabeth A Lasater; Waylan K Bessler; Laura E Mead; Whitney E Horn; D Wade Clapp; Simon J Conway; David A Ingram; Fang Li,Human molecular genetics,2008-08-01,10.1093/hmg/ddn134,abstract_only,False
PMID:29566645,"Oscillatory motor patterning is impaired in neurofibromatosis type 1: a behavioural, EEG and fMRI study.","BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type1 (NF1) is associated with a broad range of behavioural deficits, and an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission has been postulated in this disorder. Inhibition is involved in the control of frequency and stability of motor rhythms. Therefore, we aimed to explore the link between behavioural motor control, brain rhythms and brain activity, as assessed by EEG and fMRI in NF1. METHODS: We studied a cohort of 21 participants with NF1 and 20 age- and gender-matched healthy controls, with a finger-tapping task requiring pacing at distinct frequencies during EEG and fMRI scans. RESULTS: We found that task performance was significantly different between NF1 and controls, the latter showing higher tapping time precision. The time-frequency patterns at the beta sub-band (20-26 Hz) mirrored the behavioural modulations, with similar cyclic synchronization/desynchronization patterns for both groups. fMRI results showed a higher recruitment of the extrapyramidal motor system (putamen, cerebellum and red nucleus) in the control group during the fastest pacing condition. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated impaired precision in rhythmic pacing behaviour in NF1 as compared with controls. We found a decreased recruitment of the cerebellum, a structure where inhibitory interneurons are essential regulators of rhythmic synchronization, and in deep brain regions pivotally involved in motor pacing. Our findings shed light into the neural underpinnings of motor timing deficits in NF1.","Methods We studied a cohort of 21 participants with NF1 and 20 age- and gender-matched healthy controls, with a finger-tapping task requiring pacing at distinct frequencies during EEG and fMRI scans. Methods Subjects Twenty-one adults with NF1 were recruited from a database used in previous studies [ 19 ] and in collaboration with the Portuguese Association of Neurofibromatosis. They all had a definite diagnosis of NF1 in accordance with the criteria of the National Institutes of Health (National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference, 1988). The control group (20 age- and gender-matched participants) was recruited via advertisement in the local community. Exclusion criteria for all participants included psychiatric disorders, neurologic illness affecting brain function other than NF1, brain tumor burden, intelligence quotient (IQ) lower than 75, epilepsy and traumatic brain injury. One control was excluded due to neurological illness. None of the NF1 patients were diagnosed with ADHD or had a formal diagnosis of learning disabilities. None of the participants were taking medication for treating anxiety or depression in the year before the study, and none of them were ever medicated with anticonvulsants. All the participants but one were right-handed as assessed by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory [ 29 ] and had normal or corrected to normal visual acuity. Intellectual function was assessed by using the Portuguese-adapted version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-3rd edition (WAIS-III) [ 30 ]. Two control participants were unavailable to complete the IQ assessment. Full-scale IQ values were in the normal range for the NF1 patients (mean IQ ± SD 104.4 ± 13.7). All the participants performed the standard Stroop Colour and Word Test [ 31 ] composed by two congruent conditions [word (W) and colour (C)] and one incongruent (interference) condition [colour-word (CW)]. Participants had 45 s to complete each task condition. An Interference Index was calculated according to the method proposed by Golden [ 31 ]: incongruent score (IG) = CW − [(W × C)/(W + C)]. Groups did not differ regarding this index (independent-samples  t  tests,  p  > .05), indicating similar ability to control over the interference effect. Three participants were excluded from the EEG analysis. One due to a malfunction in the trigger recording system and two due to differences in the cap system (ground positioning and channel locations). Two participants exceeded the limits of movement during the functional magnetic resonance (3 mm in, at least, one axis), and thus were excluded from that analysis. Our final sample for the EEG analysis was composed of 19 patients with NF1 and 19 controls. The clinical group ( n  = 19, 10 females, age range 23.8–51.8, mean age ± standard deviation [SD] 36.1 ± 6.7) and the control group ( n  = 19, 11 females, age range 22.5–55.0, mean age ± SD 37.1 ± 7.2) were matched for age ( U  = 160.0,  p  = 0.549) and gender ( χ 2  (1) = .106,  p  = 0.744). The final sample for the fMRI analysis was composed of 19 patients with NF1 and 20 controls. The clinical group ( n  = 19, 11 females, age range 23.8–51.8, mean age ± standard deviation [SD] 36.5 ± 7.0) and the control group ( n  = 20, 12 females, age range 22.5–55.0, mean age ± SD 36.8 ± 7.1) were matched for age ( U  = 182.5,  p  = 0.833) and gender ( χ 2  (1) = .018,  p  = 0.894). Task Participants performed a previously validated audio-paced tapping paradigm [ 26 ] at three incremental frequencies (1, 3 and 5 Hz). Participants were asked to tap using both index fingers either simultaneously (“synchronous” condition) or alternating the tapping (“alternating” or “asynchronous” condition) as prompted by a cue shown in a computer screen (“A” for the alternating condition and an “S” for the synchronous condition). All participants were familiarized with the task and the interface before the beginning of the recording sessions. The paradigm was designed and presented using the Psychophysics Toolbox 3 [ 32 ,  33 ], running on Matlab R2013b (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). For the fMRI task, a total of 24 blocks of the motor paradigm, 8 per frequency (4 synchronous and 4 alternating), were presented. Block duration was 9 s either for the finger tapping or for the baseline. The cues were presented in a 698.40 × 392.85 mm LCD monitor (NordicNeuroLab, Bergen, Norway), placed ~ 156 cm away from the participants’ head. Audio was provided through MR-compatible headphones. Behavioural data (tapping timings) were recorded using the MRI-compatible response box Lumina LP-400 (Cedrus Corporation, San Pedro, CA, USA). Regarding the EEG acquisition, we acquired four runs, each composed of five repetitions of the main sequence (1, 3 and 5 Hz, each frequency executed in two variations, synchronous and alternating). Blocks lasted 12 s and were composed by a baseline period of 3 s (where the participant fixated the central cross and did not execute any movements) and 9 s of task (see Fig.  1 ). The cueing paradigm was presented in a laptop placed ~ 50 cm in front of the participant. Participants were instructed to fixate the centre of the screen during the EEG task, and behavioural data were recorded using the “Z” and “M” buttons of a common keyboard. Fig. 1 Experimental design of the behavioural task during the EEG task (concerning the fMRI design, see text). The participants were instructed to make an audio-paced tapping using both index fingers, synchronously or alternately, as indicated by the visual cue. The tapping frequency was set at 1, 3 or 5 Hz, and it was set by a beep MR recordings and analysis MR scans were acquired in a 3T Magnetom Tim Trio scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany), using a 12-channel birdcage head coil. A T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo sequence was acquired with a repetition time of 2530 ms, echo time of 3.42 ms, resolution of 1 mm 3  isotropic voxel, flip angle of 7°, matrix size 256 × 256 and a field of view of 256 × 256 mm. Functional data were acquired using echo-planar imaging sequences, using voxel size 3 mm 2  and slice thickness of 3 mm, no gap between slices, 43 slices acquired parallel to the anterior commissure-posterior commissure line, repetition time 3000 ms, echo time 30 ms, flip angle of 90°, matrix size 256 × 256 and a field of view of 256 × 256 mm. In total, 147 volumes were acquired. A T2-weighted fluid attenuation inversion recovery sequence was used to identify unidentified bright objects, and it was acquired using a 1 mm 3  voxel, repetition time 5 s, echo time 388 ms, inversion time 1.8 s, field of view 250 × 250 mm, matrix size 256 × 256 and160 slices. The complete processing pipeline and analysis of the functional data was done using BrainVoyager QX 2.8.2 (Brain Innovation, Maastricht, The Netherlands). Data were corrected for (1) slice scanning time differences using cubic spline interpolation, (2) motion artifacts by combining trilinear and sinc function based methods for interpolation in the three axes and (3) filtered in the time domain using an approach with Fourier basis set using 2 cycles per time course. Functional data were automatically co-registered to the anatomical T1 (and manually verified) and subsequently normalized to the Talairach atlas. Spatial smoothing was applied using a Gaussian kernel with a full width at half maximum of 6 mm. Statistical analyses were performed at the group level using a general linear model approach. The predictor’s model was obtained by convolution of the boxcar function with a standard 2-gamma hemodynamic response function. Motion parameters were also included in the model as regressors of no interest. Random effects analysis (RFX) was performed, and the results were corrected for multiple comparisons using false discovery rate (FDR) with a fixed  p  value of 0.05 and minimum cluster extension of 20 voxels. EEG recordings and analysis Electroencephalographic signals were recorded using a 64 electrodes cap (QuickCap, NeuroScan, USA) with electrodes placed according to the extended 10/20 system. In order to ensure the quality of the signal, all electrode impedances were kept below 20 kΩ. The continuous signal was amplified and recorded at a sampling rate of 1 kHz, low pass filter at 200 Hz, through a SynAmps2/RT amplifier. Data were acquired using Scan 4.5 (NeuroScan, Compumedics, Charlotte, NC), and the acquisition reference was set to an electrode located at a half distance between CZ and FCZ. The processing was performed using the EEGlab toolbox [ 34 ] for Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA). The EEG signal was downsampled to 400 Hz and digitally filtered between 1 and 100 Hz. A notch filter (47.5–52.5 Hz) was applied, and epochs from − 3000 to 9000 ms were obtained locked to the stimuli onset. Epoch rejection was done automatically by scanning the entire dataset using a rejection threshold of 120 μV for all electrodes followed by visual inspection to ensure the data was free from artifacts. Channels with abnormal noise activity were interpolated using spherical spline interpolation. The HEO/VEO channels were excluded from further analysis, and the recordings were re-referenced to the average of all remaining channels. We proceeded to epoch division by trigger data, i.e. we separated the time-frequency epochs by sub-task type (1, 3 and 5 Hz tapping, synchronous and alternated). All the participants met the minimum criterion (more than 40%) of the trials per condition available for analysis. Time-frequency decomposition was done using the function  pop_newtimef() , with Morlet wavelet, beginning with a 7-cycle at 6 Hz and increasing linearly with frequency (maximum of 30 cycles at 50 Hz). We calculated 400 timepoints (with an effective time window from − 2600 to 6080 ms) and set the baseline from the beginning of the epoch until 100 ms before the onset of the stimulus. Electrodes corresponding to motor areas were clustered (FC1, FC2, CZ, C1, C3, C2 and C4). We truncated the time analysis intervals (from − 2000 to 6000 ms) in order to avoid boundary effects on time-frequency spectra. Further analysis was performed in the time-course variation for three sub-bands of mu, beta and gamma frequencies (respectively, 8–12, 20–26 and 40–44 Hz intervals). Beta range (20–26 Hz range) was defined around the desynchronization peak that matches the motor pattern. The choice of the interval of low gamma was based on our previous work [ 35 – 37 ] and was set up to 44 Hz to avoid power line interferences in the time-frequency analysis. The bands were not juxtaposed, in order to avoid information contamination between bands. Frequency-domain evaluations were performed specifically for beta sub-band variations, since they exhibit a marked sinusoidal profile, matching motor responses. For that, we computed the power per subject at the exact frequency of tapping. Statistics for group comparisons Measurements of motor performance were done in data recorded during EEG recordings because larger amounts of data could be recorded. The statistical comparison between groups was performed using one-way multivariate ANOVAs (MANOVAs) to determine whether there are any differences between the independent variable (group) based on the dependent continuous variables (tapping at three different frequencies: 1, 3 and 5 Hz), for synchronous and asynchronous conditions. Similarly, we used MANOVA to test group differences on EEG data.

PMID:20858602,Oligodendrocyte progenitor cell numbers and migration are regulated by the zebrafish orthologs of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 is the most commonly inherited human cancer predisposition syndrome. Neurofibromin (NF1) gene mutations lead to increased risk of neurofibromas, schwannomas, low grade, pilocytic optic pathway gliomas, as well as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors and glioblastomas. Despite the evidence for NF1 tumor suppressor function in glial cell tumors, the mechanisms underlying transformation remain poorly understood. In this report, we used morpholinos to knockdown the two nf1 orthologs in zebrafish and show that oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) numbers are increased in the developing spinal cord, whereas neurons are unaffected. The increased OPC numbers in nf1 morphants resulted from increased proliferation, as detected by increased BrdU labeling, whereas TUNEL staining for apoptotic cells was unaffected. This phenotype could be rescued by the forced expression of the GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-related domain of human NF1. In addition, the in vivo analysis of OPC migration following nf1 loss using time-lapse microscopy demonstrated that olig2-EGFP(+) OPCs exhibit enhanced cell migration within the developing spinal cord. OPCs pause intermittently as they migrate, and in nf1 knockdown animals, they covered greater distances due to a decrease in average pause duration, rather than an increase in velocity while in motion. Interestingly, nf1 knockdown also leads to an increase in ERK signaling, principally in the neurons of the spinal cord. Together, these results show that negative regulation of the Ras pathway through the GAP activity of NF1 limits OPC proliferation and motility during development, providing insight into the oncogenic mechanisms through which NF1 loss contributes to human glial tumors.",,Jeong-Soo Lee; Arun Padmanabhan; Jimann Shin; Shizhen Zhu; Feng Guo; John P Kanki; Jonathan A Epstein; A Thomas Look,Human molecular genetics,2010-12-01,10.1093/hmg/ddq395,abstract_only,False
PMID:32245042,Kinome Profiling of NF1-Related MPNSTs in Response to Kinase Inhibition and Doxorubicin Reveals Therapeutic Vulnerabilities.,"Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1)-related Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors (MPNST) are highly resistant sarcomas that account for significant mortality. The mechanisms of therapy resistance are not well-understood in MPNSTs, particularly with respect to kinase inhibition strategies. In this study, we aimed to quantify the impact of both the genomic context and targeted therapy on MPNST resistance using reverse phase phosphoproteome array (RPPA) analysis. We treated tumorgrafts from three genetically engineered mouse models using MET (capmatinib) and MEK (trametinib) inhibitors and doxorubicin, and assessed phosphosignaling at 4 h, 2 days, and 21 days. Baseline kinase signaling in our mouse models recapitulated an MET-addicted state (NF1-MET), P53 mutation (NF1-P53), and HGF overexpression (NF1). Following perturbation with the drug, we observed broad and redundant kinome adaptations that extended well beyond canonical RAS/ERK or PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. MET and MEK inhibition were both associated with an initial inflammatory response mediated by kinases in the JAK/STAT pathway and NFkB. Growth signaling predominated at the 2-day and 21-day time points as a result of broad RTK and intracellular kinase activation. Interestingly, AXL and NFkB were strongly activated at the 2-day and 21-day time points, and tightly correlated, regardless of the treatment type or genomic context. The degree of kinome adaptation observed in innately resistant tumors was significantly less than the surviving fractions of responsive tumors that exhibited a latency period before reinitiating growth. Lastly, doxorubicin resistance was associated with kinome adaptations that strongly favored growth and survival signaling. These observations confirm that MPNSTs are capable of profound signaling plasticity in the face of kinase inhibition or DNA damaging agent administration. It is possible that by targeting AXL or NFkB, therapy resistance can be mitigated.","2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Murine MPNST Tumorgrafts and Treatment Immediately following the euthanasia of tumor-bearing mice, 15–25 mg portions of each tumor were transplanted into the flank of NSG-SCID mice using a 10 gauge trochar. Tumors were measured twice weekly and euthanized when the tumor size exceeded 2500 mm 3 . When the tumor volume reached approximately 150 mm 3 , mice were randomized into treatment groups, treated, and euthanized as independent groups at 4-h, 2-day, or 21-day time points (or until mice reached the euthanasia criteria). Respective doses across all treatment combinations were capmatinib (30 mg/kg twice daily vial oral gavage), trametinib (1 mg/kg daily via oral gavage), and doxorubicin (1 mg/kg once via subcutaneous injection). For the 4-h time point, all animals were euthanized 4 h after a single dose. For the 2-day time point, capmatinib-treated animals received three total doses and were euthanized 4 h after the final treatment, whereas trametinib-treated animals received two total doses before euthanasia. Tumors were immediately harvested and either snap-frozen or formalin-fixed for further analysis. Three representative tumors were assessed by RPPA for each time point, treatment, and genotype group. Capmatinib and trametinib were obtained from Novartis. Doxorubicin was obtained from LC Laboratories. All animal experimentation in this study was approved by the Van Andel Institute’s Internal Animal Care and Use Committee (XPA-19-04-001). 2.2. Sample Collection and Preparation for RPPA Downstream Analysis Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen within 20 min upon surgical resection to preserve the integrity of the phosphoproteome. Specimens were then embedded in an optimal cutting temperature compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA, USA), cut into 8 μm cryo-sections, mounted on uncharged glass slides, and stored at −80 °C until microdissected. Each slide was fixed in 70% ethanol (Sigma Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany), washed in deionized water, stained with hematoxylin (Sigma Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) and blued in Scott’s Tap Water substitute (Electron Microscopy Sciences), and dehydrated through an ethanol gradient (70%, 95%, and 100%) and xylene (Sigma Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany). In order to prevent protein degradation, complete protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland) were added to the ethanol, water, hematoxylin, and Scott’s Tap Water substitute [ 17 ]. For each sample, an average of 15,000 tumor cells was isolated from the surrounding microenvironment using a Pixcell II LCM system (Arcturus, Mountain View, CA, USA). Microdissected cells were lysed in a 1:1 solution of 2× Tris-Glycine SDS Sample buffer (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent (Pierce, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with 2.5% of 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany). Cell lysates were boiled for 8 min and stored at −80 °C. 2.3. Reverse Phase Protein Microarray Construction and Immunostaining Using an Aushon 2470 arrayer (Aushon BioSystems, Billerica, MA, USA) equipped with 185 μm pins, samples and standard curves for internal quality assurance were printed in triplicate onto Oncyte Avid nitrocellulose-coated slides (Grace Bio-labs, Bend, OR, USA), as previously described [ 17 ]. A Sypro Ruby Protein Blot Stain (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) protocol was used to stain selected arrays to quantify the total amount of protein within each sample. Before immunostaining, each array was first incubated with Reblot Antibody stripping solution (Chemicon) for 15 min at room temperature, followed by two washes in PBS. To minimize potential nonspecific bindings, arrays were then incubated in I-block solution (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 1 h. Each array was tested with a single primary antibody using an automated system (Dako, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The antibody specificity was tested by immunoblotting using a wide panel of cell lysates, as previously described [ 17 , 18 ]. Negative control arrays were incubated with the anti-rabbit secondary antibody only to account for unspecific binding and background noise. A commercially available catalyzed signal amplification system (Dako, Santa Clara, CA, USA) coupled with a biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories) and a streptavidin-conjugated IRDye680 (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA) were used for the amplification and detection of the fluorescent signal. Arrays were probed with a total of 99 antibodies targeting protein kinases involved in major cellular functions, and the results of the broad screening were previously published. Antibody and Sypro Ruby-stained arrays were scanned using a laser-based PowerScanner (TECAN, Mönnedorf, Switzerland). Acquired images were analysed using the MicroVigene software version 5.1 (Vigene Tech, Carlisle, MA, USA). This commercially available software performs spot finding, averages the triplicates, subtracts the background from the negative control slide(s), and normalizes each sample to the corresponding amount of total protein measured by Sypro Ruby staining. Intra- and inter-assay reproducibility of the RPPA platform has been previously reported [ 19 , 20 ]. 2.4. Statistical Methods Tumor growth analysis : Linear mixed-effects models, with random slopes and intercepts, and false discovery rate-adjusted contrasts, were used to estimate and compare tumor growth rates for the different mono and combo therapies. For visualization of the changes in tumor growth, the tumor volume was imputed using the last observation carried forward, until the animal was euthanized. Curves terminated once >50% of mice had been euthanized in the respective treatment group. All analyses were conducted using R v3.2.2 ( https://cran.r-project.org/ ), with an assumed level of significance of α = 0.05. Proteomic analysis : Fold change in expression for each phosphosite was calculated by log 2  transformation of the treatment relative to the vehicle mean for that genotype group. Fold change was ranked-ordered by the median of the treatment group for each genotype and for each condition, the top and bottom 15 proteins from the ranked list were plotted in balloon plots. A total of 98 protein sites passed quality control metrics and were used for analysis. Fold change in the expression for each protein was calculated as the protein expression relative to the vehicle mean for that genotype-time group. Proteins were rank-ordered on the  y -axis by the median transformed fold change for each treatment-genotype-time group and plotted from highest to lowest fold change. Each column represents a single animal. For the 4-h and 2-day time points, animals were plotted randomly on the x-axis. For the 21-day time point, animals were plotted on the  x -axis based on tumor size (largest to smallest) at sacrifice, corresponding to tumors 4–6, respectively, in the associated tumor-graft plots. The balloon color indicates the log 2  fold change in protein expression. Proteins with a greater than 4-fold increase or decrease in expression relative to the vehicle were plotted as log 2  fold change >2 or <−2, respectively. The balloon size indicates the absolute protein expression normalized to the total protein input and background. Head-tail balloon-maps were created by plotting the 30 proteins with the highest and lowest fold change in expression for each treatment-genotype-time group. Plots were generated using R v3.6.1. For pospho-AXL and phospho-NFkB correlation analysis, normality was first assessed by a Shapiro–Wilk normality test. Correlations were analyzed by two-sided Spearman’s rank correlation rho. For correlation plots, data were fit by stat_smooth using loess with span = 1 using ggplot2 (v3.2.1). Missing data points (due to a failure to meet RPPA quality control standards) were omitted from the analysis. All analyses were done using R (v3.6.2). 2.4.

PMID:29137242,Immune profiling of NF1-associated tumors reveals histologic subtype distinctions and heterogeneity: implications for immunotherapy.,"Successful treatment of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated tumors poses a significant clinical challenge. While the primary underlying genetic defect driving RAS signaling is well described, recent evidence suggests immune dysfunction contributes to tumor pathogenesis and malignant transformation. As immunologic characterizations, prognostic and predictive of immunotherapeutic clinical response in other cancers, are not fully described for benign and malignant NF1-related tumors, we sought to define their immunologic profiles. We determined the expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A/-B/-C, β-2-microglobulin (B2M), and T cell inhibitory ligands PD-L1 and CTLA-4 by microarray gene analysis and flow cytometry. We examined HLA-A/-B/-C, B2M, and PD-L1 expression on thirty-six NF1-associated tumor samples by immunohistochemistry, and correlated these with tumoral CD4","MATERIALS AND METHODS Microarray mining We used a pre-clinical and clinical mRNA microarray Affymetrix database consisting of thirteen dermal neurofibromas, thirteen plexiform neurofibromas, six MPNST tumors, and thirteen MPNST cell lines and normalized their results against ten samples of normal human Schwann cells ( GSE14038 ) to identify MHC I (HLA-A, -B, and –C), B2M, PD-L1 (CD274), and CTLA-4 gene expression [ 24 ]. We used Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array to measure gene expression. Data were processed using GeneSpring GX v7.3.1 (Agilent Technologies) with background correction and Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) normalization. Differential gene expression was predicted using Bioconductor/ limma package [ 25 ]. Cell culture The human  NF1 −/−  MPNST cell line S462TY and  NF1 
 + /  human sporadic MPNST STS-26T cell line have been previously described [ + 26 – 28 ]. Cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin [ 27 ]. All cells were cultured at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% carbon dioxide. The identities of all cell lines used were confirmed by Short Tandem Repeats (STR) verification. All cell lines used in this study were found to be free of mycoplasma using MycoAlert™ Mycoplasma Detection Kit (LT07-318, Lonza Inc. Allendale, NJ). Flow cytometry To assess HLA-A/B/C, B2M, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 protein expression in human MPNST cell lines, 2.5x10 5  cells were harvested with Cell Dissociation Buffer Enzyme-Free PBS-based (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog number 13151014). The tumor cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 100 μl buffer (PBS, 1% FBS, 1% EDTA), and blocked with 20% final volume of human Ig Fc blocking antibody (Miltyni Biotech, catalog number 130-059-901). Cell suspensions were stained with 1:100 dilutions of Phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-human HLA-A/B/C antibody (W6/32) (eBioscience, catalog number 12-9983-42), Phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-human β-2-microglobulin antibody (2M2) (Biolegend, catalog number 316306), Phycoerythrin -Cyanine 7-conjugated anti-human PD-L1 antibody (29E.2A3) (Biolegend, catalog number 329717), or Allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-human CTLA-4 antibody (L3D10) (Biolegend, catalog number 349907) for 30 minutes at 4°C. Following primary stain, samples were washed twice with buffer, resuspended in 1% paraformaldehyde fixative, and analyzed on a BD FACS LSR II using BD FACSDiVa software version 4.0 (BD Biosciences). Flow cytometry data analysis was performed using FlowJo version 7.6.5 (Tree Star). Tissue microarray construction The Institutional Review Board at Nationwide Children’s Hospital approved this study. Thirty-six NF1-associated tumor samples consisting of nine diffuse histology benign neurofibromas (five dermal and four non-dermal samples), eight benign neurofibromas with nodular histology, five plexiform neurofibromas, and fourteen malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors were obtained through the Nationwide Children’s Hospital Pathology Department. These samples were included onto tissue microarrays constructed from 2 mm punches of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks. Immunohistochemical staining All stages of the immunohistochemistry procedure were automated on the Bond III Immunohistochemistry (IHC) system (Leica Microsystems) using the Refine polymer detection system, with 3, 3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB) visualization and counterstain with hematoxylin. An antibody to HLA Class 1 ABC (clone EMR8-5, Abcam Inc, catalog number ab70328) was used at a dilution factor of 1:6000, after on-line antigen retrieval in a citrate buffer, pH 6 (ER1, Leica Microsystems, catalog number AR9961) for 20 minutes at 100° C. β-2-Microglobulin antibody (HPA006361, rabbit polyclonal, Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number HPA006361) was used at a dilution of 1:6000 with EDTA retrieval (ER2, Leica Microsystems, catalog number AR9640) for 20 minutes at 100° C. An antibody to PD-L1 (clone B55, Sino Biological Inc., catalog number 10084-H08H) was used at a dilution factor of 1:200, after on-line antigen retrieval in an EDTA buffer, pH 9 (ER2, Leica Microsystems, catalog number AR9640) for 20 minutes at 100° C. Antibodies to CD4 (clone SP35, Cell Marque, catalog number 104R-18) and CD8 (clone 4B11, Leica Microsystems, catalog number PA0183) were used pre-diluted, after on-line antigen retrieval in an EDTA buffer, pH 9 (ER2, Leica Microsystems, catalog number AR9640) for 20 minutes at 100° C. Antibodies to CD56 (clone 1B6, Leica Microsystems, catalog number NCL-L-CD56-1B6) and CD45RO (clone UCHL1, Leica Microsystems, catalog number PA0146) were used pre-diluted, after on-line antigen retrieval in a citrate buffer, pH 6 (ER1, Leica Microsystems, catalog number AR9961) for 20 minutes at 100° C. An antibody to FOXP3 (clone 236A/E7, Abcam Inc., catalog number ab20034) was used at a dilution factor of 1:100, after on-line antigen retrieval in an EDTA buffer, pH 9 (ER2, Leica Microsystems, catalog number AR9640) for 20 minutes at 100° C. Evaluations Scoring of HLA-A/B/C, B2M, and PD-L1 expression in NF1-associated tumor samples by immunohistochemical staining Immunohistochemical staining of HLA-A/B/C, B2M, and PD-L1 was scored by a single pathologist (MAA), based upon maximal staining intensity on a scale of 0 to 3 (absent = 0, weak = 1, moderate but less than normal cells = 2, or strong = 3) and percentage of tumor cells stained (range 0 to 100%), as previously described [ 17 ]. Calculation of CTL Target Scores For tumor samples where HLA-A/B/C and B2M expression were detected by immunohistochemical staining, CTL Target Scores were calculated as previously described [ 17 ]: Average HLA-A/B/C score (range 0 to 300) = % positive staining × staining intensity/n. Average B2M score (range 0 to 300) = % positive staining × staining intensity/n. CTL Target Score (range 0 to 900) = average HLA score × average B2M score/100. Scoring of CD4 + , CD8 + , CD56 + , FOXP3 + , and CD45RO +  lymphocytic cellular infiltrates Immunohistochemical staining of CD4 + , CD8 + , CD56 + , FOXP3 + , and CD45RO +  cellular infiltrates was scored by the same pathologist (MAA). Counts were based upon the number of positively stained lymphocytes per square area of tumor present. Statistical analysis Tumor subtype immunohistochemical staining scores and cellular infiltrates were compared using Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric testing with post-hoc pairwise comparison using the two-step method of Benjamini, Krieger, and Yekutieli to control for a false discovery rate of 0.05 using GraphPad Prism 7 software. Results were considered to be significant when adjusted p ≤ 0.05. Correlation of immunologic marker IHC staining and calculated CTL Target Scores with tumoral immune cellular infiltrates was calculated using Pearson correlation due to expected non-Gaussian curve distribution. Sample score values were determined to positively correlate with cellular infiltrates when Pearson R = 0.00 to 0.39 (weak), 0.40 to 0.59 (moderate), 0.6 to 0.79 (strong), and 0.8 to 1.0 (very strong). Sample score values were determined to negatively correlate with cellular infiltrates when Pearson R = 0.00 to -0.39 (weak), -0.40 to -0.59 (moderate), -0.6 to -0.79 (strong), and -0.8 to -1.0 (very strong). Two-tailed t-test p values were used for all calculations. Results were considered to be statistically significant when p ≤ 0.05.

PMID:29662612,Exploiting mitochondrial and metabolic homeostasis as a vulnerability in NF1 deficient cells.,Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a disease caused by mutation of neurofibromin 1 (,"MATERIALS AND METHODS Reagents Y100 and Y100B were synthesized by Chembridge Corp (San Diego, CA). The synthesis of Y100 and Y100B was first described by Gornostaev and Lavrikova [ 59 ]. Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) and buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) were purchased from Enzo Life Sciences (Farmingdale, NY), Q-VD-OPh hydrate (QVD) was purchased from ApexBio (Houston, TX), GSK’872 (RIPK3 inhibitor) and oligomycin (A/B/C) were purchased from Calbiochem/EMD Millipore (Billerica, MA), carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), hydroxyurea (HU), and poly-L-lysine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), antimycin A and cyclosporine A were purchased from Alfa Aesar (Haverhill, MA), and hydroxychloroquine sulfate (HCQ) was purchased from Spectrum Chemicals (New Brunswick, NJ). Stock solutions of all molecules were prepared in 100% DMSO with the exception of HCQ and HU, which were prepared in phosphate buffered saline without calcium and magnesium (Corning #21-040-CV). High copy suppressor screen Yeast (MDW320, Table  3 ) were transformed with 1 μg of the  S. cerevisiae  AB320 genomic library in YEp13 (ATCC 37323) or empty vector (YEp13) using a transformation master mix containing 37% w/v polyethylene glycol MW 3350, 110 μM lithium acetate, and 307 μg/mL salmon sperm carrier DNA in sterile water. Cells were incubated in the transformation mixture, including DNA, for 30 minutes at 30°C before heat shock for 15 minutes at 42°C. The cells were washed once with water and then plated on freshly made SC-Leu dropout agar plates with 10 μM Y100B, DMSO, or an unrelated tool compound. Individual colonies that grew on Y100B and DMSO but not the unrelated compound plates were then grown on SC-Leu. Plasmid DNA from the surviving yeast was prepared with 25:24:1 phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol and then electroporated into  E. coli.  Plasmid DNA was isolated from  E. coli  using a QiaPrep Spin MiniPrep kit (Qiagen). Plasmids were restriction digested with the restriction enzyme NdeI at 37°C for 1 hour. Cut plasmid DNA was separated on 0.8% agarose gels to identify unique plasmids. Unique targets were sequenced by the Sanger method using the following primers that recognize sequences on YEp13: Table 3 Yeast strains used in the present study Strain Genotype Source MLY41a ura3-52 Lorenz et. al. 1997 [ 60 ] MDW057 As MLY41a  erg6Δ Wood et. al.

Functional annotation of high copy suppressor hits with Gene Ontology terms was performed with the Saccharomyces Genome Database YeastMine tool [ 61 ]. Cell culture U87-MG cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). U251-MG cells were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. U87-MG and U251-MG were passaged regularly and cultured with DMEM (Corning Life Sciences, Corning, NY) in the presence of 10% v/v fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals; Life Technologies). Immortalized mammary epithelial cells (IMECs) were a kind gift from Dr. James DiRenzo. IMECs were cultured in DMEM/F12 50/50 media supplemented with 5% FBS, 2 mM glutamine (Gibco), 5 μg/mL insulin (Akron Biotech), 500 μg/mL hydrocortisone (MP Biomedical), and 10 ng/mL recombinant human epidermal growth factor (Promega). Cells were routinely verified as mycoplasma free with the MycoProbe kit (R&D Systems). Immunofluorescence 50,000 U87-MG cells were cultured on poly-D-lysine coated coverslips (Neuvitro Corporation) or poly-L-lysine (Sigma) coated coverslips and treated with Y100 (Chembridge) for 24 hours. When labeling polarized mitochondria, cells were treated with 100 nM Mitotracker Red CMXRos in culture media for 30 minutes prior to fixation (Life Technologies). After treatment and labeling, cells were rinsed with PBS. Cells were fixed in methanol-free 4% paraformaldehyde, pH 6.9 (Electron Microscopy Services) prepared in PBS (Corning) for 10 minutes at room temperature (RT) and blocked with immunofluorescence buffer (2% [v/v] goat serum, 0.2% [v/v] Triton X-100 and 0.05% [w/v] sodium azide in PBS) at RT. Primary antibody conditions were diluted in IF buffer and used as follows: anti-Tom20 FL-145 (Santa Cruz, 1:200, RT, 1 hour), anti-Tid1 Ab-2 RS13 (Neomarkers, 1:200 4°C, overnight), anti-p-H2AX Ser139-488 N1-431 (BD, 1:100, 4°C, 30 minutes, no secondary). After primary antibody staining, cells were rinsed 3 times for 5 minutes with PBST. Secondary labeling was performed with 1:600 goat anti-rabbit 488 or 1:800 goat anti-mouse F(ab’)2 DyLight 594 or 647 at room temperature for 1 hour (Jackson Immunoresearch) diluted in IF buffer. Cells were then rinsed 2 times for five minutes with PBST and nuclei were labeled with 0.33 μg/mL DAPI in PBS for 5 minutes. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides with ProLong Gold (Life Technologies) and imaged. For JC-1 mitochondrial staining, PLL coated coverslips were seeded with 50,000 U87-MG cells and allowed to adhere overnight. The following day cells were treated with 10 μM CCCP, 1.7 μM Y100, or equivalent volume DMSO in DMEM with 10% FBS for 12 h. Thirty minutes before the endpoint, the medium was replaced with 1 μg/mL JC-1 dye in DMEM with 10% FBS. Live cells were then mounted in 1:1 PBS:ProLong Gold and imaged immediately. Wide-field images were acquired with a Zeiss Imager Z1 wide-field microscope equipped with a 40× 1.3 NA EC Plan-NEOFLUAR objective and Zeiss Axiovision software. Confocal images were acquired with a Nikon A1RSi confocal microscope equipped with a 60X 1.4 NA objective, a DU4 detector unit, and Nikon Elements software. Image processing was performed with Fiji, built on ImageJ2 [ 62 ,  63 ]. Microarray 5 × 10 5  immortalized mammary epithelial cells (IMECs) were cultured overnight and treated with DMSO or 1 μM Y100 for 8 hours. Cells were trypsinized, rinsed in PBS and centrifuged. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was frozen at −80°C. The RNA was extracted using a Norgen Biotek RNA/DNA/Protein Purification Plus Kit, following the standard operating protocol. 300 ng RNA/sample was labeled using the TargetAmp Nano kit (Epicentre Bio, Madison, WI). RNA was hybridized to an HT12v4 microarray (Illumina, San Diego, CA) overnight in an Illumina hybridization oven. Arrays were scanned with the iScan microarray scanner (Illumina). Analyses were performed using BRB-Array Tools Version 4.2.1. BRB-ArrayTools is an integrated software package for the analysis of DNA microarray data [ 64 ]. Variance-stabilizing transformation was applied to raw intensity data, which was then normalized using robust spline normalization and filtered to remove non-detected spots as determined by Illumina BeadStudio Software. Three technical replicates were performed for both conditions. One DMSO replicate was determined to be an outlier and thus eliminated. Differentially expressed genes were identified using a random-variance  t -test with a  p -value cutoff of 0.05 [ 64 ]. Multiple testing correction was performed using the method of Benjamini and Hochberg. Hierarchical clustering was employed to generate heat maps for subsets of significant genes using the open source software Cluster/Treeview written by Michael Eisen [ 65 ]. Cluster and TreeView are programs that provide a computational and graphical environment for analyzing data from DNA microarray experiments or other genomic datasets. Data were uploaded to the Gene Expression Omnibus (accession number  GSE86421 ). Dose response assays To perform drug sensitivity assays in mammalian models, cells were plated to 96-well plates at a concentration of 5,000 cells/well. After overnight incubation, the medium was removed and replaced with 100 μL of medium containing 0–20 μM Y100 and DMSO (to normalize DMSO concentrations). In the case of the Nec-1, GSK’872, cyclosporine A, and QVD co-treatment assays, cells were preincubated with these compounds or a vehicle control for 2 h before being replaced with Y100 +/− Nec-1, GSK’872, QVD, cyclosporine A, or vehicle. In the case of the BSO co-treatment assay, cells were incubated with BSO or media for 48 h before being replaced with Y100 +/− BSO. Cells were incubated for the noted time with a final 3-hour incubation in 5% AlamarBlue (Thermo Scientific). The plate was scanned using a Spectramax M2 (Molecular Devices) plate reader at an Ex/Em of 544/590 nm, and fluorescence was normalized to vehicle control wells. Each experiment was repeated 2–3 times with 4 technical replicates per experiment. A representative experiment is shown in each case. To perform drug sensitivity assays in yeast models (Table  3 ), log-phase cells were diluted to 0.05 OD 600 . Drugs were diluted in SC-Complete media starting at 200 μM, followed by 9 2-fold serial dilutions to generate a 10-point range of concentrations. 75 μL of cells were mixed with 75 μL of drug dilutions in a 96-well plate, with four technical replicates per concentration. Yeast were incubated for 18 hours at 30°C. At 18 hours, the OD 600  was read using a THERMOmax (Molecular Devices) plate reader and SOFTmax Pro 4.3 LS software. Each experiment was repeated 2–3 times with three technical replicates per experiment. OD 600  was normalized to vehicle control wells. Dose-response curves and IC 50 s were calculated with the Prism 6 software package (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA) by performing a 4-parameter logistic regression with outlier exclusion analysis. Flow cytometry To determine mitochondrial superoxide levels, 500,000 U87-MG cells/well were plated in a 6-well plate and allowed to adhere overnight. The medium was then replaced with cell culture media, and DMSO, 1.7 μM Y100, or 10 μM CCCP was added to the media at the noted time points. Cells were treated for 30 minutes to 24 hours. 30 minutes before the end of the incubation, MitoSOX Red (Cell Signaling) was added to a final concentration of 1 μM. At the end of the incubation, cells were rinsed twice with PBS and trypsinized and resuspended in PBS for analysis. The cells were transferred to flow cytometry tubes and analyzed using a MacsQuant VYB 8-color flow cytometer. MitoSOX Red fluorescence was detected using the Y2-A (TdTomato) channel. 30,000 events per sample were collected and cellular debris was gated out of the dataset. This experiment was repeated three times, and a representative experiment is shown. Histograms were generated using the FlowJo or FlowLogic flow cytometry analysis software packages. MV-151 active site probe assay U87-MG cells were plated (500,000 cells per well in a 6-well tissue culture plate) and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were treated for 24 hours with vehicle control (DMSO), Y100, or a 2 h incubation of a cocktail of 1 μM bortezomib and 10 μM MG-132 (proteasome inhibitors) as a positive control. The cells were lysed with digitonin buffer (250 mM sucrose, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM adenine triphosphate, 0.2% v/v nonidet P40, 0.025% w/v digitonin). Lysates were incubated with MV-151, a fluorescent probe that binds active proteasome subunits, for 30 minutes at 37°C and samples (10 μg total protein per sample) were separated on an SDS-PAGE gel [ 66 ,  67 ]. The gel was then scanned on a Typhoon scanner to detect MV-151 fluorescence, and protein was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed for alpha-tubulin as a loading control. The experiment was repeated three times. RNA interference U87-MG cells were plated in a 96-well plate at a concentration of 5,000 cells/well and a 6-well plate at a concentration of 1.48 × 10 5  cells/well. Cells were transfected with siRNA targeting RIPK1 (Sigma, SASI_Hs01_00071803), or a non-targeting control (Sigma, Universal Control #1) prepared in Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and serum-free DMEM (Corning). 96-well plates were transfected with 5 pmol siRNA/well. 6-well plates were transfected with an equivalent amount of siRNA scaled for total volume. After a 48-hour transfection period, cells were treated with Y100 for 48 hours. Dose response assay was performed as described above. Protein samples were acquired 48 and 96 hours post-transfection to verify RIP1 knockdown ( Supplementary Figure 2 ). Western blotting U87-MG cells were plated at a concentration of 500,000 cells per well in a 6-well plate and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were treated with the noted concentrations and times of controls or Y100. After treatment, cells were harvested with trypsin, rinsed, and lysed with 75 μL modified RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% v/v nonidet P40, 0.5% w/v sodium deoxycholate, 0.05% w/v sodium dodecyl sulfate, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0) containing 1 mM NaVO 4 , 1 mM NaF, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μg/mL leupeptin, 100 μM benzamidine HCl, 1 μM aprotinin, 0.1 μg/mL soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.1 μg/mL pepstatin, and 0.1 μg/mL antipain. Protein was quantified with a bicinchoninic acid assay kit (Pierce). 30 μg of protein was prepared in 1X Laemmli sample buffer (50 mM Tris pH 6.8, 0.02% w/v bromophenol blue, 2% w/v sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10% v/v glycerol, 1% v/v beta-mercaptoethanol, 12.5 mM EDTA) and separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 4–15% polyacrylamide gradient gel (Bio-Rad). Protein was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST and probed with anti-LC3BI/II #2775 (Cell Signaling, 1:1000, overnight), anti-p62/SQSTM-1 D-3 (Santa Cruz, 1:1000, 1 h), anti-alpha-tubulin B-1-2-5 (Santa Cruz, 1:10000, 1 h), anti-K63 polyubiquitin #5921 (Cell Signaling, 1:1000, 1 h), anti-pK48 polyubiquitin #8081 (Cell Signaling, 1:2000, 1 h), anti-GAPDH ab9485-100 (Abcam, 1:1000, overnight), anti-RIP (BD Transduction Laboratories, 1:1000, overnight) in 2% milk in TBST. Secondary labeling was performed with a one-hour incubation in 1:20000 anti-rabbit HRP or 1:10000 anti-mouse HRP (Jackson Immunoresearch) diluted in 2% milk in TBST. The film was then exposed to ECL-coated blots (Pierce) and developed using a standard film processor. Bioenergetic characterization of Y100 Bioenergetics analysis was performed with a Seahorse XF96 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, 2.0 × 10 5  U87-MG cells were plated in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum, in a Seahorse XF96 Microplate and allowed to adhere overnight. A FluxPack sensor cartridge was equilibrated in XF Calibrant at 37°C overnight. Before performing the assay, cells were washed twice in standard XF Base Medium supplemented with pyruvate, glutamine, and glucose. Cells were then incubated in 180 μL XF media for 45 minutes at 37°C with atmospheric CO 2 . To perform single injection assays, 20 μL of 10X assay molecule in XF media was prepared and loaded into port A. The assay was run with 3 baseline measurements, followed by injection and 2 hours of data collection to determine changes in oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). To perform the Mito Stress Test, the assay was run as described in the Mito Stress Test kit protocol with 1 μM oligomycin, 0.5 μM FCCP, and 0.5 μM rotenone/antimycin A. For curves containing Y100, FCCP was substituted with Y100. Both experiments were repeated a minimum of three times, with a representative experiment shown. The analysis was performed with Seahorse Wave 2.2/2.3.

PMID:26066488,A Systematic Assessment of Accuracy in Detecting Somatic Mosaic Variants by Deep Amplicon Sequencing: Application to NF2 Gene.,"The accurate detection of low-allelic variants is still challenging, particularly for the identification of somatic mosaicism, where matched control sample is not available. High throughput sequencing, by the simultaneous and independent analysis of thousands of different DNA fragments, might overcome many of the limits of traditional methods, greatly increasing the sensitivity. However, it is necessary to take into account the high number of false positives that may arise due to the lack of matched control samples. Here, we applied deep amplicon sequencing to the analysis of samples with known genotype and variant allele fraction (VAF) followed by a tailored statistical analysis. This method allowed to define a minimum value of VAF for detecting mosaic variants with high accuracy. Then, we exploited the estimated VAF to select candidate alterations in NF2 gene in 34 samples with unknown genotype (30 blood and 4 tumor DNAs), demonstrating the suitability of our method. The strategy we propose optimizes the use of deep amplicon sequencing for the identification of low abundance variants. Moreover, our method can be applied to different high throughput sequencing approaches to estimate the background noise and define the accuracy of the experimental design.","Materials and Methods Patients and Calibration samples Constitutional DNA samples were obtained from peripheral blood leukocytes. DNA was extracted from blood leukocytes and from fresh frozen tumor tissue using standard procedures with phenol/chloroform extraction and ammonium acetate/ethanol precipitation. To evaluate the diagnostic sensitivity of Illumina Miseq platform and its ability to identify mosaicism in DNA samples, we performed serial dilutions of a wild-type DNA with genomic DNA deriving from five non-mosaic NF2 patients carrying five different  NF2  variants. Each patient DNA sample was mixed with wild type DNA to obtain 3 calibration samples containing 10%, 5% and 1% of mutated allele, respectively. Each calibration sample was prepared in duplicate. In addition, 8 known mosaic patients were also analyzed; they had been identified by Sanger sequencing of multiple tumors of each patient while blood DNAs sequencing did not confirm the variants found in tumor tissues in any of the patients. Finally, we screened by deep sequencing a total of 34 consecutive DNA samples (4 tumor and 30 blood DNAs) referred to our laboratory for  NF2  mutational analysis. Fifteen patients had a NF2 clinical diagnosis based on the current diagnostic criteria [ 19 – 21 ]; the others had multiple schwannomas and/or meningiomas and/or ependimomas or 1 central nervous system tumor associated with juvenile cataract and/or cafè-au-lait spots ( S1 Table ). All the patients analyzed have been previously screened by MLPA analysis to exclude genomic rearrangements. Data of the study (variants and phenotypes) were submitted at the Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD; URL:  http://lovd.nl/3.0/home ). Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The study was approved by the ethical committee of Careggi Hospital. Amplicon design and sequencing Our amplicon design included  NF2  and  SMARCB1 (MIM 601607;  NM_003073.3 ) genes; this choice was made for two main reasons: i) to increase the number of variants present in the calibration samples, and, ii) to use the same amplicon design to detect  SMARCB1  mutations in two other hereditary diseases, namely schwannomatosis (MIM162091) and Rhabdoid Tumor Predisposition Syndrome (MIM609322). Selection of  NF2  and  SMARCB1  regions of interest (UTR+CDS) was performed by TruSeq Custom Amplicon (TSCA) protocol. Amplicons were designed by Illumina DesignStudio ( http://www.illumina.com ). A total of 44 amplicons of an average of 250 bp in length comprising about 5581 bp was obtained (100% on-target coverage). Library preparation was performed using the TruSeq Custom Amplicon Library Preparation Kit v1.5 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The genomic DNA input for amplicon library preparation was 250 ng for each sample according to manufacturer’s instructions. All sample libraries were equimolarly pooled and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq Sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with MiSeq Reagent Kit v2 (2X150 cycles) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Data analysis and processing Amplicon reads were aligned against the human reference genome hg19 with BWA MEM [ 22 ]. Alignments were soft-clipped based on forward and reverse primers length and position in each read by custom scripts. GATK version 2.5.2 [ 23 ] was used to recalibrate base qualities and realign aligned reads around indels. Regions with coverage less than or equal 100x in more than 50% of samples (low-coverage regions) were discarded for downstream analyses. A mosaic variant analysis was applied to detect low abundance variants: SNVs were identified using MuTect version 1.1.4 [ 16 ] with standard parameters and GATK IndelGenotyperV2 (with minFraction = 0.001 and minCnt = 3) was used to detect InDels. Genomic and functional annotation of detected variants was made by Annovar [ 24 ]. Coverage statistics was performed by DepthOfCoverage utility of GATK. BASH and R custom scripts were used to obtain the list of low coverage (≤100X) regions per sample. Statistical measures A Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to estimate the variant allele fraction (VAF) to obtain the best detection accuracy for low level mosaicism identification. To this end, the known variants of calibration samples ( Table 1 ) were exploited to perform this analysis. For each variant type analysis (SNVs and InDels) and for each calibration sample we estimated True Positive Rate (TPR*) and False Positive Rate (FPR*) at step  i  ( i -th value of threshold parameter, that is VAF) as:
 
 T P R * i = T P i T P = d e t e c t i o n s e n s i t i v i t y 
where  F P R * i = F P i F P = 1 − d e t e c t i o n s p e c i f i c i t y TP 
  and  i FP 
  are respectively the number of true and false positive variants with  i VAF  ≤  VAF 
  while  i TP  and  FP  are the total number of true and false positives ( TP  +  FP  is the total number of detected variants). Detection accuracy was estimated by measuring the Area Under the Curve (AUC) inferred from the ROC curves. 10.1371/journal.pone.0129099.t001 Table 1 Known variants present in calibration samples.

 : The DNA variant numbering is based on cDNA sequences for both genes, with the A of the ATG translation-initiation codon numbered as +1. b Standard PCR and HRMA Conditions PCR reactions were performed in 20 ul, with 2uL 10X PCR buffer containing 1.5mM MgCl 2  (Qiagen, Hilden Germany), 0.25 mM of each dNTP, 0.5 uM of forward and reverse primers, 0.5U HotStarTaq Plus (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and 100 ng of genomic DNA. SYTOs 9 (Invitrogen, Eugene, Oregon, USA) was used as the intercalating dye in HRMA. PCR condition consisted of an initial denaturation step at 95°C for 5 min, following by 35 cycles of denaturing at 95°C for 30 sec, 30 sec at annealing temperature and elongation at 72°C for 30 sec. The final extension was carried out at 72°C for 20 min for HRMA and 10 min for sequencing analysis. HRM analysis was performed on the “Rotor Gene 6000 Instrument” (Corbett Research, Sydney, Australia). Amplified products were denaturated at 95°C for 1 min and then rapidly cooled to 40°C for 1 min in order to facilitate heteroduplex formation. Melt curve data for each PCR product were acquired in a wide temperature range (75°C to 95°C), at a ramping rate of 0.1°C/sec. Results were analyzed as fluorescence versus temperature graphs. COLD PCR To design a COLD-PCR assay a new reduced denaturation temperature for the reactions was determined (Tc). The melting temperature (Tm) of a given amplicon was firstly identified via HRMA of conventional PCR using an intercalating dye: the Tc is usually 1°C below the experimentally derived Tm. Subsequently, a set of COLD-PCR reactions at graded temperatures below the Tm were performed, in order to identify the optimal Tc. Fast COLD-PCR was used for the detection of Tm-decreasing variants and its cycling conditions were as follow: 95°C for 5 min; 20 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec, primer annealing temperature for 30 sec, 72°C for 30 sec; then 30 cycles of Tc for 3 sec, primer annealing temperature for 30 sec, 72°C for 30 sec; and final extension at 72°C for 10 min. Full COLD-PCR protocol was applied for identifying Tm-increasing or-not modifying variants using the following conditions: denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, 25 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec, primers annealing temperature for 30 sec, 72°C for 1 min; then 30 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec, 70°C for 8 min, Tc for 3 sec, primers annealing temperature for 30 sec, 72°C for 1 min, and final extension at 72°C for 20 min. COLD-PCR assays were performed using the same final reagent concentration used in standard PCR. Primers sequences are available on request. Sanger Sequencing PCR and COLD-PCR products were purified using HiYieldGel/PCR DNA Fragments Extraction Kit (RBCBioscience, New Taipei City, Taiwan). Sequencing analysis was performed on both strands using the BigDye Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Life Technologies Applied Biosystems, Austin, Texas, USA) and a model 310 automated sequencer (Life Technologies Applied Biosystems). Variant nomenclature follows the Human Genome Variation Society recommendations ( http://www.hgvs.org ). The DNA variant numbering is based on the  NF2  cDNA sequences (GenBank accession number  NM_181832.2 ) with the A of the ATG translation-initiation codon numbered as +1. Multiplex Ligation Probe Amplification Copy number changes (deletions or duplications) of  NF2  locus and flanking genes were analyzed by Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA), using  NF2  and/or 22q11 MLPA test kits (MRC-Holland, P044_B1 and P324_A2). Electrophoresis data were analyzed by GeneMapper software (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA).",Elisa Contini; Irene Paganini; Roberta Sestini; Luisa Candita; Gabriele Lorenzo Capone; Lorenzo Barbetti; Serena Falconi; Sabrina Frusconi; Irene Giotti; Costanza Giuliani; Francesca Torricelli; Matteo Benelli; Laura Papi,PloS one,2015,10.1371/journal.pone.0129099,minimal,True
PMID:19306381,Neuregulin-1 beta and neuregulin-1 alpha differentially affect the migration and invasion of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor cells.,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are the most common malignancy associated with neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1). These Schwann cell lineage-derived sarcomas aggressively invade adjacent nerve and soft tissue, frequently precluding surgical resection. Little is known regarding the mechanisms underlying this invasive behavior. We have shown that MPNSTs express neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) beta isoforms, which promote Schwann cell migration during development, and NRG-1 alpha isoforms, whose effects on Schwann cells are poorly understood. Hypothesizing that NRG-1 beta and/or NRG-1 alpha promote MPNST invasion, we found that NRG-1 beta promoted MPNST migration in a substrate-specific manner, markedly enhancing migration on laminin but not on collagen type I or fibronectin. The NRG-1 receptors erbB3 and erbB4 were present in MPNST invadopodia (processes mediating invasion), partially colocalized with focal adhesion kinase and the laminin receptor beta(1)-integrin and coimmunoprecipitated with beta(1)-integrin. NRG-1 beta stimulated human and murine MPNST cell migration and invasion in a concentration-dependent manner in three-dimensional migration assays, acting as a chemotactic factor. Both baseline and NRG-1 beta-induced migration were erbB-dependent and required the action of MEK 1/2, SAPK/JNK, PI-3 kinase, Src family kinases and ROCK-I/II. In contrast, NRG-1 alpha had no effect on the migration and invasion of some MPNST lines and inhibited the migration of others. While NRG-1 beta potently and persistently activated Erk 1/2, SAPK/JNK, Akt and Src family kinases, NRG-1 alpha did not activate Akt and activated these other kinases with kinetics distinct from those evident in NRG-1 beta-stimulated cells. These findings suggest that NRG-1 beta enhances MPNST migration and that NRG-1 beta and NRG-1 alpha differentially modulate this process.","MATERIALS AND METHODS Human Study Cases Protocols for studies using human tissues were approved by the University of Alabama at Birmingham Institutional Review Board for Human Use. Paraffin embedded blocks of surgically resected MPNSTs were obtained from the Department of Pathology of the University of Alabama at Birmingham. 5 to 6 μm thick sections from these blocks were used for immunohistochemical studies. Reagents and Antibodies PD168393 , PD98059, U0126, LY294002, wortmannin, PP2, SU6656, SP600125 and Y-27632 were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Antibodies recognizing phospho-Erk 1/2 (#9101), Erk2 (#9108), Akt phosphorylated at Ser473 (#9271), Akt (#9272), SAPK/JNK phosphorylated on Thr183/Tyr185 (#9251), SAPK/JNK (#9252) or Src family members phosphorylated at Tyr416 (#2101) or Tyr527 (#2105) were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies recognizing FAK (sc-932), erbB2 (sc-284), erbB4 (sc-283) and NRG-1 transmembrane precursors with an “a” variant carboxy terminus (sc-348) and a goat polyclonal anti-β 1  integrin (sc-6622) antibody were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse monoclonal antibodies recognizing erbB3 (clone RTJ.1; #554208) or erbB4 (HFR1; sc-53280) were from BD PharMingen (San Jose, CA) or Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. Anti-GAPDH monoclonal antibody (clone 6C5) was purchased from Fitzgerald Antibodies and Antigens (Concord, MA). Texas red-conjugated phalloidin was obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Cy3-, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)- and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse, anti-goat and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch (West Grove, PA). We have previously described the production of recombinant NRG-1 ( Frohnert et al., 2003a ). Biological activity of NRG-1β and NRG-1α was verified by demonstrating that nanomolar concentrations of these recombinant proteins maximally stimulated erbB phosphorylation in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells; this result is identical to that previously reported with similarly produced NRG-1 proteins ( Holmes et al., 1992 ;  Peles et al., 1993 ). Culture of MPNST Cells and Wild-Type Schwann Cells Establishment of the YST-1 ( Nagashima et al., 1990 ), STS-26T ( Dahlberg et al., 1993 ) and ST88-14 ( Ryan et al., 1994 ) human MPNST cell lines has been previously described. The murine A202, B76 and B97 cell lines were established from MPNSTs arising in P 0 -GGFβ3 mice (Kazmi et al, in preparation). Wild-type murine Schwann cell cultures were prepared from the sciatic nerves of adult C57BL/6 mice using our previously described methodology ( Frohnert et al., 2003b ). All cultures were maintained in Dulbecco’s modification of Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 10 μg/ml streptomycin and 10 IU/ml penicillin (DMEM10). Migration Assays Transwell migration assays were performed as previously described ( Ritch et al., 2003 ) using 70% confluent MPNST cells that had been maintained overnight in a serum-free Schwann cell defined medium [SCDM ( Frohnert et al., 2003b ;  Frohnert et al., 2003a )] prior to plating in filters (40,000 cells per filter). Transwell filters with 8 μm pores (Becton Dickinson Labware; Franklin Lakes, NJ) were prepared by coating first with 0.1 mg/ml poly-L-lysine (Sigma #P5899) and then with 10 μg/ml natural mouse laminin (Invitrogen #23017-015) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS); to compare MPNST migration on alternative substrates, filters were instead coated with 40 μg/ml fibronectin or 40 μg/ml collagen type I in PBS without poly-L-lysine precoating. NRG-1 was added to the bottom portion of wells containing migration assay buffer (MAB) and cells allowed to migrate for 6 hours; if pharmacologic inhibitors were used, these were added to the top and bottom of the wells 30 minutes prior to NRG-1 exposure. Ethanol fixed, crystal violet-stained cells on filter undersurfaces were visualized by bright field microscopy and five distinct 20x fields per filter photographed. Experiments were repeated a minimum of six times. The number of cells in each photographed field were counted using Image Pro Plus (version 4.1) software (Media Cybernetics; Silver Springs, MD). Data was analyzed with a one-way ANOVA, followed by a Tukey post-hoc test.  P -values < 0.05 were considered significant. Invasion Assays Schwann cell and MPNST cell invasion was assessed using Matrigel invasion assays as previously described ( Kleinman and Jacob, 1998 ). In brief, cells were incubated overnight in serum-free Schwann cell defined medium. 40 μl of 1:1 growth-factor depleted Matrigel (BD Biosciences #354230): DMEM with 0.2% fatty acid-free BSA was allowed to solidify for 1 hour at 37°C inside Transwell filters with 8 μm pores (Becton Dickinson Labware). 75,000 cells were plated inside each filter and allowed to attach for 1 hour at 37°. NRG-1 was then added to the bottom portion of each well and cells allowed to invade for 72 hours; if pharmacologic inhibitors were to be used, these were added to both the top and bottom of the wells. Filters were washed three times with PBS and stained overnight at 4°C with crystal violet dissolved in ethanol. Filters were then washed four times with PBS. Cells on the lower surface of the filter were visualized by bright field microscopy and five distinct 20x fields per filter were photographed. Experiments were repeated a minimum of six times. The number of cells in each photographed field were counted using Image Pro Plus (version 4.1) software (Media Cybernetics; Silver Springs, MD). The data was analyzed with a one-way ANOVA, followed by a Tukey post-hoc test.  P -values < 0.05 were considered significant. Cell Adhesion Assays 96 well plates were coated overnight with poly-L-lysine and laminin. 70% confluent MPNST cells maintained overnight in serum-free Schwann cell defined medium were plated at 25,000 cells per well in MAB alone or MAB containing NRG-1β or NRG-1β plus  PD168393 . 30 minutes later, cells were washed three times with PBS, fixed with ethanol and stained with crystal violet. The amount of staining in each well was quantified by scanning at 590 nm with a plate spectrophotometer. Phalloidin Staining of MPNST Cells MPNST cells maintained in DMEM10 were plated on poly-L-lysine/laminin coated coverslips. The next morning, cells were incubated in SCDM for 16 hours, followed by 3 hours in MAB. Wells were then challenged with vehicle, the concentration of NRG-1β that optimally promoted migration or the equivalent concentration of NRG-1α. Six hours post-stimulation, cells were fixed for 15 minutes at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Following three PBS washes, fixed cells were incubated in blocking buffer (PBS containing 2% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100) for 20 minutes at room temperature. Cells were then incubated overnight at 4°C with Texas red-conjugated phalloidin diluted in blocking buffer as recommended by the manufacturer. Cells were washed three times with PBS (15 minutes/wash) and counterstained for 5 minutes with bisbenzamide (Sigma). Coverslips were mounted in 1:1 PBS:glycerol and visualized using a Zeiss Axioskop microscope equipped for epifluorescence. Estimation of Cellular Area of Phalloidin Stained Cells The mean area of MPNST cells before and after NRG-1 treatment was estimated in an unbiased fashion using the nucleator technique. Phalloidin stained cells counterstained with bisbenzamide were examined using the 40x objective of an Olympus BX-51 microscope equipped with epifluorescence optics and a motorized stage that was controlled by a computer equipped with StereoInvestigator software (MBF Bioscience, Inc.; Williston, VT). Photographs of 10-12 sampling sites that were systematically and randomly selected were taken using a Microfire camera operating at a uniform exposure setting. The nucleoli of all cells within the sampled fields were marked and the distances along four rays extending from the marked site to the boundary of the cell determined. The area of each cell was then calculated using StereoInvestigator software and the mean area of all of the cells sampled for each treatment condition determined. Immunocytochemistry and Immunohistochemistry MPNST cells plated on poly-L-lysine/laminin coated coverslips were fixed as described above. Following three PBS washes, cells were incubated in TBST (Tris-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100) for 20 minutes at room temperature and then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in TBST [anti-FAK, 1:500; anti-β 1  integrin, 1:100; anti-erbB3 (mouse monoclonal RTJ.1), 1:500; anti-erbB4 (mouse monoclonal HFR1), 1:200] or Texas red-conjugated phalloidin overnight at 4°C. The next morning, coverslips were washed three times with PBS (15 minutes/wash) and then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with FITC- and Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:100 and 1:800 dilutions, respectively). Cells were washed three more times with PBS (15 minutes per wash) and then counterstained by immersion in 2 μg/mL bisbenzamide for 10 minutes at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted with 1:1 PBS:glycerol. To examine erbB localization in invadopodia, MPNST cells were plated on poly-L-lysine/laminin coated FluoroBlok filters with 8 μm pores (#351152; BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA) as described for the Transwell migration assays. After allowing the cells to migrate for 2 hours, they were fixed and immunostained for erbB3 or erbB4 as described above. Filter membranes were excised with a scapel and mounted under coverslips. Double label immunohistochemistry for NRG-1 and erbB kinases was performed on tumor sections using our previously described methodology ( Stonecypher et al., 2005 ). Primary antibody dilutions were: anti-NRG-1 (Santa Cruz rabbit polyclonal sc-348), 1:500; anti-erbB3 (mouse monoclonal RTJ.1), 1:500; and anti-erbB4 (mouse monoclonal HFR1), 1:200. Following incubation with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies, sections were counterstained with bisbenzamide and mounted with 1:1 PBS:glycerol for examination. Imaging was performed on a Leica DMIRBE inverted epifluorescence / Nomarski microscope outfitted with Leica TCS NT SP1 Laser Confocal optics. Precise control of fluorochrome excitation and emission was afforded by an acousto-optical tunable filter and by a TCS SP1 prism spectrophotometer, respectively. Spectral separation of fluorochromes was ensured by the use of tight bandpass emission windows which do not overlap with the emission spectra of the other fluorochromes used. Optical sections through the Z axis were generated using a stage galvonometer. During image acquisition, the format size was set to 1024 × 1024 pixels for high resolution and the pinhole aperture to 150 um for a high level of haze removal. Flattened maximum projections of image stacks were realized using proprietary confocal imaging software (Leica). Exposures for images of control preparations stained using secondary antibodies alone were established by first determining the conditions necessary for optimal exposures of preparations stained with primary antibodies and then using these same conditions to photograph preparations stained using secondary antibodies alone. Immunoblotting Assays 70% confluent cultures of A202 cells plated on poly-L-lysine/laminin coated flasks were serum-starved overnight and then stimulated with 1 nM NRG-1β or 1 nM NRG-1α. Cells were rinsed with ice-cold Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS) and then homogenized  in situ  with 1 ml of ice-cold HES (20 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 1 mM EDTA, 250 mM sucrose) buffer containing protease (Sigma #P8340), serine/threonine phosphatase (Sigma #P2850) and tyrosine phosphatase (Sigma #P5726) inhibitors diluted 1:100. Protein concentrations were determined with a modified Lowry method ( DC  Protein Assay; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Equivalent quantities of protein were resolved on SDS polyacrylamide gels, immunoblotted per our previously described protocol ( Stonecypher et al., 2005 ) and probed with antibodies recognizing phospho-Erk 1/2 (1:1200 dilution), Erk2 (1:1000 dilution), phospho-Akt (1:1000 dilution), Akt (1:1000 dilution), phospho-SAPK/JNK (1:700), SAPK/JNK (1:1000), phospho-Src (Tyr416; 1:1000 dilution) or phospho-Src (Tyr527; 1:1000 dilution). Immunoreactive species were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Membranes were reprobed with an anti-GAPDH antibody (clone 6C5; 1:20,000 dilution). For immunoblot analyses of erbB expression in human and murine MPNST cells, 70% confluent cultures were lysed and immunoblotted as described above. Blots were probed with antibodies recognizing erbB2 (rabbit polyclonal sc-284; 1:500 dilution), erbB3 (monoclonal RTJ.1; 1:500 dilution) or erbB4 (rabbit polyclonal sc-283; 1:500 dilution) and immunoreactive species detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Immunoprecipitation Assays MPNST cells were rinsed once with ice-cold PBS and then lysed by sonication at 4°C in RIPA (150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS and 50 mM Tris [pH 8.0]) buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Protein concentrations were determined as noted above. Immunoprecipitation was performed using Protein G Dynabeads (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA). A 10 μl slurry of beads was washed twice in PBS containing 0.1% BSA, using a magnetic particle separator to recover the beads from the wash solution. Washed beads were incubated with 6 μg of anti-β 1  integrin antibody in PBS containing 0.1% BSA at 4°C with continuous overnight end-to-end mixing. The next morning, beads were washed twice with PBS containing 0.1% BSA, mixed with 1 mg of protein diluted in 1 ml of wash buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors and incubated overnight at 4°C with continuous end-to-end mixing. Beads were then washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% BSA. Washed beads were resuspended in 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 minutes. Immunoprecipitates were resolved on a 7.5% gel, immunoblotted as described above and probed with anti-β 1  integrin (1:200 dilution), anti-erbB3 (monoclonal RTJ.1; 1:500 dilution) or anti-erbB4 (monoclonal HFR1; 1:500 dilution) antibodies.

PMID:27817916,Orbital/Periorbital Plexiform Neurofibromas in Children with Neurofibromatosis Type 1: Multidisciplinary Recommendations for Care.,"TOPIC: Children and adults with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a common autosomal dominant condition, manifest a variety of ophthalmologic conditions. Plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) involving the eyelid, orbit, periorbital, and facial structures (orbital-periorbital plexiform neurofibroma [OPPN]) can result in significant visual loss in children. Equally important, OPPNs can cause significant alteration in physical appearance secondary to proptosis, ptosis, and facial disfigurement, leading to social embarrassment and decreased self-esteem. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Although NF1 is a relatively common disease in which routine ophthalmologic examinations are required, no formal recommendations for clinical care of children with OPPNs exist. Although medical and surgical interventions have been reported, there are no agreed-on criteria for when OPPNs require therapy and which treatment produces the best outcome. METHODS: Because a multidisciplinary team of specialists (oculofacial plastics, pediatric ophthalmology, neuro-ophthalmology, medical genetics, and neuro-oncology) direct management decisions, the absence of a uniform outcome measure that represents visual or aesthetic sequelae complicates the design of evidence-based studies and feasible clinical trials. RESULTS: In September 2013, a multidisciplinary task force, composed of pediatric practitioners from tertiary care centers experienced in caring for children with OPPN, was convened to address the lack of clinical care guidelines for children with OPPN. CONCLUSIONS: This consensus statement provides recommendations for ophthalmologic monitoring, outlines treatment indications and forthcoming biologic therapy, and discusses challenges to performing clinical trials in this complicated condition.",,Robert A Avery; James A Katowitz; Michael J Fisher; Gena Heidary; Eva Dombi; Roger J Packer; Brigitte C Widemann,Ophthalmology,2017-01,10.1016/j.ophtha.2016.09.020,abstract_only,False

PMID:28644838,"Characterization and utilization of an international neurofibromatosis web-based, patient-entered registry: An observational study.","The neurofibromatoses (neurofibromatosis type 1, neurofibromatosis type 2 and schwannomatosis) are rare disorders having clinical manifestations that vary greatly from patient to patient. The rarity and variability of these disorders has made it challenging for investigators to identify sufficient numbers of patients with particular clinical characteristics or specific germline mutations for participation in interventional studies. Similarly, because the natural history of all types of neurofibromatosis (NF) is variable and unique for each individual, it is difficult to identify meaningful clinical outcome measures for potential therapeutic interventions. In 2012, the Children's Tumor Foundation created a web-based patient-entered database, the NF Registry, to inform patients of research opportunities for which they fit general eligibility criteria and enable patients to contact investigators who are seeking to enroll patients in approved trials. Registrants were recruited through CTF-affiliated NF clinics and conferences, through its website, and by word-of-mouth and social media. Following online consent, demographic information and details regarding manifestations of NF were solicited on the Registry website. Statistical analyses were performed on data from a cohort of 4680 registrants (the number of registrants as of October 9, 2015) who met diagnostic criteria for one of the 3 NF conditions. The analyses support our hypothesis that patient-reported symptom incidences in the NF Registry are congruent with published clinician-sourced data. Between April 26, 2013 and July 8, 2016, the registry has been useful to investigators in recruitment, particularly for observational trials, especially those for development of patient-reported outcomes.","Methods Organization and recruitment to the registry The registry questionnaires [ S1 Text ] and consent language [ S2 Text ] were developed in collaboration with two clinicians who are co-authors of this paper (BK, DV). The questionnaires were piloted in 50 patients and minor modifications were made. The NF registry protocol and informed consent were approved by the Western Institutional Review Board on April 16, 2012. It is Study Number 1131422, WIRB Protocol Number 20120455. All WIRB-approved research is required to be conducted research in accordance with the protocol, applicable laws and regulations, and the principles of research ethics as set forth in the Belmont Report. All participants or their parent/legal guardians provided online informed consent prior to entering any data in the database. Recruitment took place through the CTF website, NF-related Facebook groups, at the annual CTF Patient Forum, through NF clinics and the CTF volunteer network, and through word of mouth and social media. All registrants were required to supply name, sex, date of birth, race/ethnicity, mailing address, phone number and email address. The purpose of collecting race and ethnicity data was to fulfill Western Institutional Review Board reporting requirements, and to identify gaps in recruitment of specific groups. All registrants completed a demographics and family history section. Depending on the type of NF reported, they were directed to a specific questionnaire for NF1, NF2 or SCHW. Disease-specific questionnaires captured features of current published diagnostic criteria [ 12 , 13 , 14 ] and a variety of disease manifestations. They also posed quality of life questions. Participants were offered options with regard to being contacted by registry coordinators, including no contact. For purposes of the present analyses, studies that have recruited through the Registry are classified as either observational; survey (i.e., patient-reported outcomes or quality of life); or interventional. Interventional studies are divided into psycho-social interventions and drug/device interventions. Data are available regarding how many registrants opened e-mails inviting them to participate in a study; however, data regarding the proportion that contacted the investigator, were screened or actually enrolled are not available. Information collected The criteria for diagnosis of NF1 were published by an NIH consensus development conference in 1988 [ 12 ]. The criteria for diagnosis of NF2 are the modified NIH consensus criteria as described by Evans in 2009 [ 13 ]. The criteria for diagnosis of SCHW are those detailed by Plotkin et al. in 2011 [ 14 ]. These criteria were used to create curation guidelines used by the Registry host (once known as PatientCrossroads, rebranded as AltaVoice, and recently acquired by and known as Invitae [ 15 ] to assign categories of “Criteria Met” or “Criteria Not Met” to each participant account. Participants were invited to upload copies of their genetic testing results to their profiles. In addition to soliciting information related to confirmation of their diagnoses, the presence and age at onset of other probably or possibly NF-related symptoms were collected. Registrants were also asked to identify their key concerns related to their disorder. Registry platform Data storage, security and confidentiality A state-of-the-art web-based, patient opt-in registry (maintained by Invitae) [ 15 ] was used for data capture. Patients or parent/guardians of minor patients provided answers to a disease-specific questionnaire via a secure web portal. The registry website could be accessed on mobile devices but was not optimized for them. Although the current questionnaires are currently available only in English, translation of the registry into multiple languages is planned. HIPAA privacy security rules are enforced by policies and procedures that protect the confidentiality and security of protected health information. The database design is such that participant identifying information is stored in data tables separate from participant medical information. Access to patient identifying information is restricted to authorized personnel at CTF and Invitae. Additional database security features of this registry target multiple levels, including data element (e.g., restricted access to fields), user (e.g., password authentication access), application (e.g., role-based access to features, access audit trails) and hosting services (e.g., firewall, secure sockets layer). Invitae uses MySQL Server as the back-end relational database. All server requests are transmitted over SSL and use several layers of data and access protection, with a dedicated, managed Cisco router firewall and a redundant array of independent disks to ensure data recovery if a hard drive fails between backups. Back up (system-level and database-level) performed nightly is retained for 30 days with monthly backups stored for 1 year at the data center. Approval and execution of requests for use Information on applying for access to de-identified data or for trial recruitment is available on the NF Registry website [ 16 ]. Requests for registry use are reviewed by the CTF Clinical Program Director and by the Data Access Committee, a group comprised of NF experts and NF patients and family members. All studies and recruitments must be approved by the investigator’s Institutional Review Board. Only de-identified data can be shared by CTF with investigators. Following approval by the Data Access Committee, The CTF Clinical Program Director extracts from the database a list of registrants reporting the manifestation(s) of NF specific to the study and any other specified characteristics such as age range or geographic location. Search results are used to generate an email list of potentially eligible participants, who receive an email from sent from the Invitae platform. The text provides a lay-level description of the study and the investigator’s contact information. The email advises the recipient to contact his or her healthcare provider to ask whether the study may be suitable for them. The registrant may initiate contact with the investigator to explore study participation. Curation and quality control Data curation was carried out by Invitae according to guidelines set by CTF based on current diagnostic criteria [ 12 , 13 , 14 ]. Each registrant was assigned a status of “Criteria Met” or “Criteria Not Met” according to disease-specific criteria. Participants with NF2 and SCHW were additionally asked “Have you been diagnosed with [disorder] by a doctor” or, in the case of NF2, whether an  NF2  mutation had been identified by molecular testing. (In the case of NF1, genetic testing was not required for “Criteria Met” status because NF1 is most often diagnosed by clinical signs.) Curation also entailed querying registrants by email or telephone for incomplete or incorrect data such as implausible or impossible birthdates. Periodically, all registrants were sent email reminders to update their information. Methods for statistical analysis A dataset for the present analysis was frozen as of October, 9, 2015 by extracting data from all accounts assigned a post-curation status of “Criteria Met” to Excel spreadsheets [S3 Table] using the reporting modules built into the registry. The spreadsheets were converted to text files (comma-separated) and imported into the R Statistical Environment V 3.2.4 [ 17 ]. Tabulations were performed using the stat.table function of the Epi package [ 18 ]. Statistical analyses were performed using the Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon signed rank tests (for continuous variables) and ordered categorical variables and the Chi - Square Test (for unordered categorical variables). In comparing more than 2 categories, the approach was to first perform an omnibus test of the entire set; if that test was significant then the categories were tested pairwise against each other. A  p  value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant and  p  values were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. Unless otherwise specified, when participants entered or updated their data in multiple sessions over time, the data used for analysis was the most recent data entered.

PMID:34230203,Patient Report of Hearing in Neurofibromatosis Type 2: Recommendations for Clinical Trials.,"OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate published patient-reported outcome measures for the assessment of hearing function and hearing-related quality of life (QoL) and recommend measures selected by the Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis International Collaboration (REiNS) as endpoints for clinical trials in neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). METHODS: The REiNS Patient-Reported Outcomes Working Group systematically evaluated published patient-reported outcome measures of (1) hearing function and (2) hearing-related QoL for individuals with hearing loss of various etiologies using previously published REiNS rating procedures. Ten measures of hearing functioning and 11 measures of hearing-related QoL were reviewed. Measures were numerically scored and compared primarily on their participant characteristics (including participant age range and availability of normative data), item content, psychometric properties, and feasibility for use in clinical trials. RESULTS: The Self-Assessment of Communication and the Self-Assessment of Communication-Adolescent were identified as most useful for adult and pediatric populations with NF2, respectively, for the measurement of both hearing function and hearing-related QoL. Measures were selected for their strengths in participant characteristics, item content, psychometric properties, and feasibility for use in clinical trials.

PMID:27856782,Revisiting neurofibromatosis type 2 diagnostic criteria to exclude LZTR1-related schwannomatosis.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the specificity of the current clinical diagnostic criteria for neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) relative to the requirement for unilateral vestibular schwannoma (VS) and at least 2 other NF2-related tumors. METHODS: We interrogated our Manchester NF2 database, which contained 205 individuals meeting NF2 criteria who initially presented with a unilateral VS. Of these, 83 (40.7%) went on to develop a contralateral VS. We concentrated our genetic analysis on a group of 70 who initially fulfilled NF2 criteria with a unilateral vestibular schwannoma and at least 2 additional nonintradermal schwannomas. RESULTS: Overall, 5/70 (7%) individuals with unilateral VS and at least 2 other schwannomas had a pathogenic or likely pathogenic LZTR1 mutation. Twenty of the 70 subsequently developed bilateral disease. Of the remaining 50, 5 (10%) had a germline LZTR1 mutation, equivalent to the number (n = 5) with a germline NF2 mutation. CONCLUSIONS: The most common etiology for unilateral VS and 2 additional NF2-associated tumors in this cohort was mosaic NF2. Germline LZTR1 and germline NF2 mutations were equally common in our cohort. This indicates that LZTR1 must be considered when making a diagnosis of NF2 in the presence of unilateral VS in individuals without a germline NF2 mutation.",,Miriam J Smith; Naomi L Bowers; Michael Bulman; Carolyn Gokhale; Andrew J Wallace; Andrew T King; Simon K L Lloyd; Scott A Rutherford; Charlotte L Hammerbeck-Ward; Simon R Freeman; D Gareth Evans,Neurology,2017-01-03,10.1212/WNL.0000000000003418,abstract_only,False
PMID:24686726,Activation of Sonic hedgehog signaling in neural progenitor cells promotes glioma development in the zebrafish optic pathway.,"Dysregulation of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling has been implicated in glioma pathogenesis. Yet, the role of this pathway in gliomagenesis remains controversial because of the lack of relevant animal models. Using the cytokeratin 5 promoter, we ectopically expressed a constitutively active zebrafish Smoothened (Smoa1) in neural progenitor cells and analyzed tumorigenic capacity of activated Shh signaling in both transient and stable transgenic fish. Transient transgenic fish overexpressing Smoa1 developed retinal and brain tumors, suggesting smoa1 is oncogenic in the zebrafish central nervous system (CNS). We further established stable transgenic lines that simultaneously developed optic pathway glioma (OPG) and various retinal tumors. In one of these lines, up to 80% of F1 and F2 fish developed tumors within 1 year of age. Microarray analysis of tumor samples showed upregulated expression of genes involved in the cell cycle, cancer signaling and Shh downstream targets ptc1, gli1 and gli2a. Tumors also exhibited specific gene signatures characteristic of radial glia and progenitor cells as transcriptions of radial glia genes cyp19a1b, s100β, blbp, gfap and the stem/progenitor genes nestin and sox2 were significantly upregulated. Overexpression of GFAP, S100β, BLBP and Sox2 was confirmed by immunofluorescence. We also detected overexpression of Mdm2 throughout the optic pathway in fish with OPG, therefore implicating the Mdm2-Tp53 pathway in glioma pathogenesis. In conclusion, we demonstrate that activated Shh signaling initiates tumorigenesis in the zebrafish CNS and provide the first OPG model not associated with neurofibromatosis 1.","Materials and methods Zebrafish husbandry AB and  Tg(UAS-E1b:nfsB-mCherry) c264  strains were acquired from the Zebrafish International Resource Center (ZIRC, Eugene, OR, USA). Embryos and larvae were maintained at 28.5 °C in egg water (0.03% Instant Ocean, Blacksburg, VA, USA). All experiments were conducted in accordance with the St Jude Children's Research Hospital Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. DNA constructs A 4971-bp fragment of the zebrafish  krt5  promoter (accession no.  KC857549 ) was inserted into the 5′ entry clone  p5E-MCS  from the Multisite Gateway-compatible entry vectors of the Tol2 kit.  The  48 Gal4VP16;14 × UAS-smoa1-EGFP  fragment was inserted into the middle entry clone  pME-MCS . The p5E and pME vectors containing the respective promoter and oncogenic sequences were combined with the 3′ entry clone  p3E-polyA  and the destination vector  pDestTol2pA2  to create the construct  pKrt5:Gal4VP16;14 × UAS-smoa1-EGFP  using the LR Clonase II Plus Enzyme mix (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The construct was coinjected with Tol2 transposase mRNA into one-cell stage embryos. Embryos were raised to adulthood and screened for germline transmission.

Fluorescence images were taken either on an Olympus IX81 fluorescent microscope using Olympus DP Controller software (Olympus, Center Valley, PA, USA) or on a Nikon TE2000E2 microscope equipped with Nikon C1Si confocal using Nikon NIS Elements, (Nikon, Melville, NY, USA). Microarray and data analysis Total RNA at 200 ng was amplified and labeled using an Agilent Low Input Quick Amp kit (5190-2305). Microarray was performed using Agilent-026437 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), Zebrafish GX v3 4 × 44K (Santa Clara, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Microarrays were scanned with an Agilent scanner (G2565CA) at 3 μm resolution, and data were extracted by Agilent Feature Extraction software (v.10.5.1.1) using GE1_105_Jan09 protocol. Quantile normalization on background-subtracted signal intensity was performed among the samples, and a  P -value using  t -test was calculated for each gene as statistical measurement of the replicates. The selection of significant genes was based on at least a twofold change and a probability of >95% ( P <0.05) on differential expression among the four replicates. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR Total RNA was reverse transcribed (SuperScript VILO cDNA Synthesis Kit, Invitrogen) and real-time PCR was performed using the TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, NY, USA). Probes for PCR were:  actinb1  (Dr03432610_m1),  gli1  (Dr03093665_m1),  gli2a  (Dr03144185_m1),  gfap  (Dr03079975_m1) and  wnt5a  (Dr03123879_m1) (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA). All data were normalized to  actinb1  expression and fold change was calculated using the 2 −ΔΔCt . OT measurement Wild-type and transgenic fish at 12 months of age were killed in 0.04% Tricaine (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). Brains were dissected, imaged and the OT from the midline to the left and right edges was measured and analyzed using Nikon NIS Elements.

PMID:18931645,Bioluminescent imaging of intracranial vestibular schwannoma xenografts in NOD/SCID mice.,"HYPOTHESIS: Intracranial vestibular schwannoma xenografts can be successfully established and followed with bioluminescent imaging (BLI). BACKGROUND: Transgenic and xenograft mouse models of vestibular schwannomas have been previously reported in the literature. However, none of these models replicate the intracranial location of these tumors to reflect the human disease. Additionally, traditional imaging methods (magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography) for following tumor engraftment and growth are expensive and time consuming. BLI has been successfully used to longitudinally follow tumor treatment responses in a noninvasive manner. BLI's lower cost and labor demands make this a more feasible approach for tumor monitoring in studies involving large numbers of mice. METHODS: Patient excised vestibular schwannomas were cultured and transduced with firefly luciferase expressing lentivirus. One million cells were stereotactically injected into the right caudate nucleus of 21 nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice. Schwannoma engraftment and growth was prospectively followed for 30 weeks after injection with BLI. After animal sacrifice, the presence of human tumor cells was confirmed with fluorescent in situ hybridization. RESULTS: Eight (38%) of 21 mice successfully engrafted the schwannoma cells. All of these mice were generated from 4 (67%) of the 6 patient excised tumors. These 8 mice could be differentiated from the nonengrafted mice at 21 weeks. The engrafted group emitted BLI of greater than 100,000 photons/s (range, 142,478-3,106,300 photons/s; average, 618,740 photons/s), whereas the nonengrafted group were all under 100,000 photons/s (range, 0-76,010 photons/s; average, 10,737 photons/s) (p < 0.001). Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis confirmed the presence of viable human schwannoma cells in much greater numbers in those mice with stable or growing tumors compared with those whose tumors regressed. CONCLUSION: We have successfully established an intracranial schwannoma xenograft model that can be followed with noninvasive BLI. We hope to use this model for in vivo testing of schwannoma tumor therapies.","Methods Patient excised vestibular schwannomas were cultured and transduced with firefly luciferase expressing lentivirus. One million cells were stereotactically injected into the right caudate nucleus of 21 nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice. Schwannoma engraftment and growth was prospectively followed for 30 weeks after injection with BLI. After animal sacrifice, the presence of human tumor cells was confirmed with fluorescent in situ hybridization. METHODS Permission for this project was obtained through the institutional review board (07-001276) and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (A8007). Transduction Schwannoma Cells With Firefly Luciferase Lentiviruses were generated by cotransfection of 293T cells with 3 plasmids: gag-pol, env, and pHR-SIN-CSGW dlNotI-luciferase ( Fig. 1 ) (provided by Galanis Lab). Forty-eight hours after transfection, virus containing supernatant was collected and passed through a 22-μm filter. The filtered supernatant was used to infect the target cells. Six patient excised sporadic vestibular schwannomas were used to culture tumor cells that were injected into 1 to 5 mice, depending on the number of cells available. This gave a total of 21 mice for the study. Individual tumor samples were minced into small pieces (<1 mm) and then cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) with 10% fetal clone III calf serum (HyClone; ThermoFischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). After 1 to 7 days, the cells were further dissociated via digestion for 24 hours with 160 U/ml collagenase (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 1.25 U/ml dispase (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) in media, followed by repetitive pipetting to create a cell suspension. After short-term culture of the cells (7–14 d) in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium, 10% fetal clone III calf serum, 0.5 μmol/L forskolin (Sigma), 10 nmol/L B1-heregulin (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), 0.5 mmol/L 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma), 2.5 μg/ml Insulin (Sigma), and 500 U/ml 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Fischer Scientific), cells were exposed to the nonreplicating lentivirus from the prepared supernatant. This effectively inserted the luciferase gene into the tumor cell deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). A separate culture was transduced with the same conditions using a similar lentivirus encoding the gene for DS Red fluorescent protein instead of luciferase, and this served as a visual positive control for viral gene delivery ( Fig. 2 ). The cells were trypsinized and washed 2 times in 2X phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline at 10 5  cells/μl in preparation for injection with a Hamilton syringe. Creation of Intracranial Schwannoma Xenografts Female nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, MN, USA), 6 to 8 weeks of age, were used for schwannoma xenograft experiments. After anesthesia with ketamine (90–120 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg), a small midline scalp incision was used to expose the calvaria. A small burr hole was drilled 2.5 mm lateral (right) and 0.5 mm anterior to the bregma. With the aide of a small animal stereotactic frame (ASI Instruments, Houston, TX, USA), cells were injected at a rate of 5 μl/min for 2 minutes (total of 10 6  cells per mouse) at a depth of 3 mm. The injection syringe was left in place for 7 minutes after the completion of tumor cell injection. Injections were done at a depth of 3 mm below the outer table of the cranium, which introduced the cells into the right caudate nucleus. Bioluminescent Imaging The mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine and xylazine (dosage above), which was combined with D-luciferin potassium (150 mg/kg; Caliper Life Sciences, Xenogen Corp., Hopkinton, MA, USA). Ten minutes after luciferin injection, mice were imaged with an IVIS 2.50 cooled charged-coupled device camera (Xenogen 200 series). For BLI analysis, an intracranial area of signal was defined using Living Image software, and the total number of photons per second per steradian centimeter was recorded. Because of the increased use of BLI at our institution, a step-down barrier room has been created in which only immunocompromised mice can be housed and handled because these mice cannot be returned to the formal barrier area after their initial imaging. The IVIS charged-coupled device camera is contained within this area because it is not currently a portable system. Mice were imaged every 3 to 4 weeks after implantation of schwannoma cells, and at the end of 30 weeks, surviving mice were killed. All of the study mice had their entire brain sectioned at 5-μm slices at 100-μm intervals. Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization The fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) protocol for paraffin-embedded tissues initially required deparaffinization in sequential room temperature baths of Citrosolv (Fischer Scientific) for 15 minutes X 2, and 100% ethanol for 5 minutes X 2. Slides were placed in Coplin jars filled with 10 mmol/L citric acid (pH 6.08) (3.84 g citric acid/2 L H 2 O) and boiled in a microwave water bath. Tissue digestion was done by placing slides in pepsin (4 mg pepsin/L 0.9% NaCl) for 15 minutes in a 37°C water bath. The slides were put in sequential alcohol baths for 2 minutes: 70% ethyl alcohol (ETOH), 80% ETOH, and 100% ETOH. Slides were codenatured and hybridized with a probe cocktail in the hybridization oven at 80°C for 5 minutes and then 37°C overnight. Slides were washed with 2× standard saline citrate/0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 2 minutes at 73°C, and 1 drop of 1× 4c6-diamidino-2-phenylindole/antifade was applied to the hybridized area. A fluorescent microscope was used to count red fluorescent human cells. Mouse and human whole genomic probe cocktail was created as follows. Male mouse whole genomic DNA was extracted from several mouse spleens using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit. The extracted DNA was quantified and then labeled using the Nick Translation Kit and Spectrum Green deoxyuridine 5-triphosphate (Abbott Molecular, Abbott Park, IL, USA). After nick translation, the labeled DNA was precipitated and reconstituted to a final concentration of 50 ng. The commercially available human whole genomic probe (from Abbott Molecular, Abbott Park, IL, USA) labeled with SpectrumRed was used as the human probe in this research. One microliter of each probe was added to 8 μl of locus-specific/whole chromosome paint hybridization buffer (Abbott Molecular, Abbott Park, IL, USA) to create a working solution. After the paraffin pretreatment method, 10 μl of probe was applied to each specimen and hybridized according to the paraffin method (see above). Statistical Analysis A 2-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare the bioluminescent image intensity at 21 weeks between the 8 mice that showed stable or increasing tumors over the study time period and the 10 mice that failed to engraft their tumor. We excluded the 3 mice that died as a result of anesthetic complications from this analysis. This test compared the median BLI value between the 2 groups.",Brian A Neff; Stephen G Voss; Cory Allen; Mark A Schroeder; Colin L W Driscoll; Michael J Link; Evanthia Galanis; Jann N Sarkaria,"Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology",2009-01,10.1097/MAO.0b013e31818b6cea,minimal,True
PMID:41616055,Inhibition of focal adhesion kinase impairs tumor formation and preserves hearing in a murine model of NF2-related schwannomatosis.,"NF2 (neurofibromatosis type 2)-related schwannomatosis (NF2-SWN) is a cancer predisposition syndrome characterized by the development of bilateral vestibular (VS) and spinal schwannomas. While benign, these tumors can cause substantial morbidity, and effective pharmacological treatments remain limited. Here, we demonstrate that genetic ablation of focal adhesion kinase (","MATERIALS AND METHODS Study approval All animal studies were conducted at the Indiana University School of Medicine in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) under protocol number 24020. Animal studies 
Generation of mice and genotyping
 Nf2  mice were generated in our laboratory as previously described ( flox/flox ;Postn-Cre +  (Nf2) ). FAK 12 flox  mice were purchased through the Jackson Laboratory (strain #: 031956, RRID:IMSR_JAX:031956) ( ).Genotypes of each mouse were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction using genomic DNA obtained from ear snips and the primers described below. 84 1)  Nf2:  The  Nf2 flox2  alleles were detected as previously described by Giovannini  et al.  ( ) and using primers P1 (5′-CTTCCCAGACAAGCAGGGTTC-3′) and P2 (5’-GAAGGCAGCTTCCTTAAGTC-3′), with bands detected at 442 base pairs (bp;  85 Nf2 flox2 ) and 305 bp ( Nf2 + ). 2) Postn-Cre: The  Postn-Cre  transgene was detected using the following primers: P3 (5′-CATTTGGGCCAGCTAAACAT-3′) and P4 (5’-CCCGGCAAAACAGGTAGTTA-3′) with a band detected at 450 bp (Cre + ) ( ). 86 3)  Fak : The  Fak flox  alleles were detected using the primers P5 (5′-GAACTTGACAGGGCTGGTCT-3′) and P6 (5′-CTCCAGTCGTTATGGGAA ATCT-3′), yielding bands at 350 bp (mutant and flox/flox), 237 and 350 bp (heterozygote and flox/plus), and 237 bp (WT) ( ). 84 
Hearing assessment
 Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were assessed at 4 and 10 months of age as we have previously described ( ,  12 ). Briefly, ABRs were measured in left and right ears of anesthetized mice [ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection] using subdermal needle electrodes. The Tucker-Davis Technologies (TDT) BioSigRZ system, with an RZ6 digital/analog converter (TDT), was used to produce and record responses to click stimuli [decibel sound pressure level (dB SPL)]. Click responses (512 repetitions, 30 to 90 dB SPL in 10-dB steps, and presented at 21/s with a closed-field system) were amplified, filtered (3 Hz to 3 kHz), averaged, and stored for offline analysis in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). ABR waveforms were high-pass filtered using a cutoff of 200 Hz to remove slow oscillations and emphasize characteristic ABR peaks. ABR threshold was defined as the lowest measured SPL at which a reproducible peak or trough was identified. Left and right ears were assessed independently and averaged to obtain an average ABR threshold (in decibels) for each mouse. Mice with an average ABR threshold value above 55 dB SPL at 4 months of age were considered hearing impaired at baseline and were excluded from further analysis ( 87 WT ,  n  = 3;  Fak KO ,  n  = 0;  Nf2 ,  n  = 1;  Nf2Fak ,  +/− n  = 1;  DKO ,  n  = 0) ( ). Following the second ABR assessment at 10 months of age, mice were humanely euthanized, and tissues were harvested for downstream analyses. For mice in which no response was appreciated, a threshold of 90 dB SPL was recorded. 88 
In vivo therapeutic studies
 VS-4718 (PND-1186 and HY-13917) and selumetinib (AZD6244 and HY-50706) were purchased from MedChemExpress. Beginning at 4 months of age,  Nf2  ( flox/flox ;Postn-Cre + Nf2 ) mice were treated for 12 weeks with the maximum-tolerated doses of VS-4718 [25 mg/kg; oral gavage, bis in die; twice daily (BID)] and selumetinib (10 mg/kg; oral gavage, BID) alone or in combination. Two cohorts of age- and sex-matched  Nf2  mice administered the vehicle by oral gavage, twice daily, and served as controls. Animals were monitored daily for signs of distress such as hunched posture, labored breathing, scruffy coat, diarrhea, or lameness. All study mice began treatment at 4 months of age and were euthanized at the end of 12 weeks of treatment for histopathological assessment. Early end point criteria include a palpable mass of more than of 1500 mm 3 , greater than 20% reduction in body weight, any of the previously mentioned signs of distress that could not be remedied by the veterinary staff, or at the recommendation of the veterinarian. The total number of animals enrolled in each treatment group is as follows: vehicle:  n  = 26, VS-4718:  n  = 14, selumetinib:  n  = 14, and combination (VS-4718 plus selumetinib):  n  = 15. The number of animals that met the criteria for euthanasia and were humanely euthanized according to the IACUC protocol or that were found deceased before meeting criteria for euthanasia were as follows: vehicle:  n  = 2, VS-4718:  n  = 1, selumetinib:  n  = 2, and combination (VS-4718 plus selumetinib):  n  = 1. These mice were excluded from further analysis. 
Tissue preparation and DRG volume quantification
 Immediately following humane euthanasia, mice were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. The bodies were decalcified in a 50:50 solution of 10% formic acid and 10% neutral-buffered formalin solution. DRGs were dissected microscopically, and the maximal dimensions (length and width) of four anatomically matched DRGs were determined using calipers. Volume was then approximated using the formula for the volume of a spheroid = 0.52 × (width) 2  × length. For in vivo therapeutics studies, mice were euthanized after 12 weeks of treatment at approximately 7 months of age. For genetic intercross studies, two cohorts of mice were euthanized at 10 or 16 months of age. Histopathology Tissues were microdissected from euthanized animals, fixed, and decalcified as described above. Specimens were then dehydrated with graded alcohols, cleared with xylenes, infiltrated with molten paraffin, and embedded in paraffin blocks. Four-micrometer-thick sections were cut on a Leica rotary microtome and stained with H&E or Masson’s trichrome. Tumors were assessed according to the established histological diagnostic criteria for schwannomas in human patients and murine genetically engineered murine models (GEMMs) as we have published previously ( ,  12 ,  30 ). Abnormal tissue and nuclear quantifications were performed using H&E-stained slides and a custom or pretrained HALO AI DenseNet module, respectively (Indica Labs, version 4.0, RRID:SCR_018350). Quantification of trichrome staining was performed using the HALO Area Quantification module (Indica Labs, version 4.0). Area quantification analysis settings were optimized for the trichrome stain, and the intensity of staining in each annotated DRG was scored by the algorithm as negative (0; blue), weakly positive (1+; yellow), moderately positive (2+; orange), or strongly positive (3+; red). Data were exported to GraphPad Prism for statistical analysis as described below. 87 Immunohistochemical staining Five-micrometer-thick tissue sections were deparaffinized, hydrated, and transferred to 0.1 M EDTA (pH 9.0) for antigen retrieval in a pressure cooker. Samples were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min and then incubated with primary antibodies for 30 min at room temperature [F4/80: #70076, Cell Signaling Technology (1:100); IL-6: #bs0782R, Bioss (1:100); MET: #ab216574 or #ab51067, Abcam (1:100); SOX10: #ab180862, Abcam (1:100); NLRP3: #CAB12694, Assay Genie (1:1000 dilution); CD68, Cell Signaling Technology (1:100)]. Incubation with secondary antibody was performed for 30 min at room temperature [goat anti-rabbit, ab205718, Abcam (1:1000)], followed by 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) (#8059, Cell Signaling Technology), which was applied for 10 min and terminated by rinsing in distilled water. Counterstaining was performed with Epredia Signature Series Hematoxylin 7211 (#22-050-111, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the sections were dehydrated, cleared, and cover slipped. Slide images were acquired on an Aperio ScanScope CS at ×20 magnification. Quantitative immunohistochemical analyses for F4/80, IL-6, and SOX10 were conducted using the Cytonuclear IHC module of HALO Image Analysis software (Indica Labs, version 4.0). The intensity of nuclear staining was scored as negative (0; blue), weakly positive (1+; yellow), moderately positive (2+; orange), or strongly positive (3+; red). Quantitative immunohistochemical analyses for MET in the genetic model and IL-6 in the therapeutics model were conducted using the Area Quantification module of HALO Image Analysis software (Indica Labs, version 4.0). Quantitative immunohistochemical analyses for MET and CD68 in the therapeutic model were conducted using the multiplex IHC module of HALO Image Analysis software (Indica Labs, version 4.0). For all analyses, all intact DRGs on each slide were annotated to designate regions of interest, and analysis settings were optimized for each specific stain. On the basis of the degree of background staining, minimum optical density settings, and variations in staining intensity, either moderately plus strongly positive (2+ and 3+) or total positive (1+, 2+, and 3+) cells/tissues were used for statistical analysis as indicated in the figure legends. Data were exported to GraphPad Prism for statistical analysis as described below. IF staining IF staining of F4/80 (#70076, Cell Signaling Technology; 1:100 dilution) and NLRP3 (#CAB12694, Assay Genie; 1:100 dilution) was performed using DRG from  Nf2  and  DKO  mice. Tissue sections were baked at 60°C for 1 hour, followed by deparaffinization in three changes of xylene and rehydration through a descending ethanol series. Slides underwent antigen retrieval using tris-EDTA (pH 9.0) in a pressure cooker at high pressure for 15 min. Sections remained in the antigen retrieval buffer and were allowed to cool for 1 hour before incubation in 3% hydrogen peroxide. Tissues were sequentially incubated with primary antibodies diluted in Tris-buffered saline with Tween-20 (TBST) for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by their respective fluorescent secondary antibodies ([F4/80: Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L) Cross-Adsorbed Alexa Fluor 488, #A-11008, Invitrogen (1:2000); NLRP3: Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L) Cross-Adsorbed Alexa Fluor 647, #A-21245, Invitrogen (1:2000)]. Slides were mounted with ProLong Diamond antifade mountant with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; #P36962, Invitrogen). Fluorescence signals were obtained using a DeltaVision Ultra microscope with a 60× lens (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). Images were acquired with z-section of 0.2 μm each and deconvolved using SoftWoRx (GE Healthcare). Images were processed using Imaris (Bitplane, RRID:SCR_007370), with figures representing individual z-sections of deconvolved stacks. Western blot Nerve tissue lysates were prepared as follows. Lysis buffer consisting of xTractor buffer (#635671, Takara Bio) plus cOmplete Mini Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (#11836153001, Roche) and PhosSTOP Phosphotase Inhibitor Cocktail (#4906837001, Roche) was added to each tissue sample, which were then subjected to sonication for 5 s at 70% AMPL three times and centrifugation for 20 min at 13,000 rpm. Protein concentrations were determined using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (#23227, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Isolated proteins were fractionated using NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris Gels (#NP0322BOX, Invitrogen) and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Immunoblots were carried out using antibodies specific to pERK (#9101, Cell Signaling Technology), total ERK (#9102, Cell Signaling Technology), phosphorylated FAK Y397 (pFAK 397, #700255, Invitrogen), or vinculin (#CP74, MilliporeSigma). Cell lysates were generated using MS03 cells treated with 1 μM VS-4718, selumetinib, or VS-4718 plus selumetinib in combination. At 24 hours, cell lysates were collected and prepared using lysis buffer consisting of 50 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM EGTA (pH 7.5) supplemented with cOmplete Mini Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, 1% (v/v) Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktails 2 and 3 (Sigma-Aldrich, #P5726 and #P0044), 10 mM NaF, and 2.5 mM NaVO 4 . Protein concentrations were determined using Pierce Coomassie (Bradford) Protein Assay Kit (PI23200, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Isolated proteins were fractionated using 4–20% Mini-PROTEAN TGX Precast Protein Gels (Bio-Rad, #4561094) and electrotransferred to nitrocellose membranes. Immunoblots were carried out using antibodies specific to pFAK 397 (#8556S, Cell Signaling Technology), total FAK (#3285S, Cell Signaling Technology), cleaved caspase 3 (#9664S, Cell Signaling Technology), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; #365062, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Following incubation with primary antibody, blots were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody (anti-rabbit: 7074 V or anti-mouse: 7076 V, Cell Signaling Technology). Signals were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (SuperSignal West Pico PLUS Chemiluminescent Substrate 34580 and/or SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate 34095), and images were collected on a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc. Arbitrary densitometry units were calculated and quantified using the ImageJ software [National Institutes of Health (NIH), version 1.53], with signals normalized to the corresponding loading control and expressed relative to control conditions. Culture of cells Human hTERT ipn02.3 2l SCs (“02.3”) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (CRL-3392), and HEI-193 schwannoma (RRID:CVCL_7660) and murine (MS03 schwannoma) cell lines were generated as previously described ( ,  89 ). Cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Harvest MIDSCI), 1% glutamine (Gibco), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Lonza), and prophylactic Plasmocin (5 μg/ml; Invivogen). The 02.3 cell line was transfected with equal amounts of a CRISPR-Cas9 KO plasmid pool targeting  90 NF2  and a homology-directed repair (HDR) plasmid pool purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-400504 and sc-400504-HDR, respectively). After selection with puromycin (2 ug/ml) and isolation of single-cell clones, multiple clones with complete KO of  NF2  were confirmed, and one used for further experiments (02.3  NF2  KO3). TrypLE Express Enzyme (Gibco) was used to dissociate cells for passaging upon reaching confluence. Cultures were tested for mycoplasma using the Lonza MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit and confirmed to be negative before experimentation. −/− 
Dose-response curves
 For dose-response curves, cells were plated at a density of 5000 cells per well in 96-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were then treated with increasing concentrations of defactinib (MedChemExpress, HY-12289) or FAK PROTAC Degrader 1 (MedChemExpress, HY-119932). Cell viability was assessed using the CellTiter-Glo Assay (Promega) 48 to 72 hours after treatment. End point luminescence was measured using a SynergyH4 plate reader with filters and settings as follows: 528/20 and hole filter sets, top read, 4-mm read height, gain: 135, and 0.5-s integration time. 
Colony formation assays
 For colony formation assays, 5000 cells were added to each well of a six-well plate and treated with the indicated drugs at the concentrations specified in the figure legends. DMSO served as the control. Cells were allowed to proliferate until controls were confluent (~5 to 7 days) and which time they were then stained with methylene blue diluted in 50% methanol and 50% H 2 O. For colorimetric measurement, each well was dissolved in 0.5 N of HCl, and the dissolved fluid was transferred to a 96-well plate to be read at 660 nm. 
Synergy assays
 MS03s were plated at a density of 2500 cells per well in 96-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were then treated in a two-dimensional dose-response matrix of increasing concentrations of defactinib, selumetinib, or VS-6766 as indicated in the figure panels. At 48 hours posttreatment, cell viability was assessed using the CellTiter-Glo Assay (Promega). End point luminescence was measured using a SynergyH4 plate reader with filters and settings as follows: 528/20 and hole filter sets, top read, 4-mm read height, gain: 135, and 0.5-s integration time. Synergy graphs and Zero Interaction Potency score (ZIP), Loewe, and Bliss synergy scores were computed using the SynergyFinder package (version 3.2, RRID:SCR_019318) in R ( ). 91 Bulk RNA-seq of  Nf2  and  DKO  DRGs Approximately eight DRGs per mouse were microdissected from each euthanized 10-month-old  Nf2  or  DKO  mouse and flash frozen using liquid nitrogen. Frozen DRGs from six mice per condition were sent to GENEWIZ from Azenta Life Sciences (South Plainfield, New Jersey, USA) for RNA extraction and bulk RNA-seq. Log 2 [counts per million (CPM) + 4] normalization of raw counts was performed using iDEP.96 ( ). Plots for gene set enrichment ( 92 Figs. 2  and  3 ) and cell type mapping (reference dataset: LM22) were generated in Omics Playground software v2.7.18 run using a local Docker image as described by Akhmedov  et al.  ( ). Plots for gene set enrichment in  93 Fig. 4  were generated in R studio (RRID:SCR_000432). Statistical analysis was performed in R or using GraphPad Prism as detailed below. Drug-treated cell line bulk RNA-seq Frozen cell pellets of murine  NF2 -deficient murine Schwannoma cells (MS03) (three replicates each) treated with defactinib (1 μM; MedChemExpress, HY-12289), VS-4718 (1 μM; MedChemExpress, HY-13917), GSK2256098 (1 μM; MedChemExpress, HY-100498), ifebemtinib (1 μM; IN-10018, MedChemExpress, HY-122844), PROTAC FAK Degrader 1 (1 μM; MedChemExpress, HY-119932), GSK215 (100 nM; MedChemExpress, HY-132296), or a FAK PROTAC kindly provided by B. Nabet (100 nM; BSJ-04-146) ( ) were sent to GENEWIZ from Azenta Life Sciences (South Plainfield, New Jersey, USA) for RNA extraction and bulk RNA-seq. Log 94 2 (CPM + 4) normalization of raw counts was performed using iDEP.96 ( ). Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism as detailed below. 92 Human VS scRNA-seq scRNA-seq data from three human schwannoma samples, generated by Baruah  et al.  ( ), were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under the accession number GSE250061. The filtered_bc_matrix.h5 files were read into R using the Read10X_h5 function in Seurat (version 4.0.2, RRID:SCR_016341). Seurat objects were created for each dataset with a minimum of three cells and 200 features per cell. Violin plots and scatter plots were generated to visualize the distribution of RNA features, counts, and mitochondrial content. Cells were filtered on the basis of the number of RNA features and mitochondrial content, retaining cells with more than 200 and fewer than 6000 RNA features and less than 20% mitochondrial content for AN014 and AN017 and fewer than 7000 RNA features for AN018. The datasets were then merged into a single Seurat object. The data were log normalized by a scaling factor of 10,000, and the top 2000 variable features were used for downstream principal components analysis, followed by Harmony integration to correct for batch effects. Thirty dimensions were used for identifying nearest neighbors, and clustering was performed at a resolution of 2. Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) was used for visualization. Marker genes for each cluster were identified using the FindAllMarkers function. Azimuth was used for cell type prediction, followed by supervised reannotation of cell types based on the expression of known marker genes ( 95 ). 96 GSEAs comparing MET+ and MET –  SCs were performed using the following packages: Seurat, msigdbr (version 7.4.1, RRID:SCR_022870), ggplot2 (version 3.3.5, RRID: SCR_014601), gridExtra (version 2.3), and enrichplot (version 1.14.0) ( ,  97 ). From the cell-type–annotated Seurat object generated above, data were preprocessed to combine SC subclusters into a single cluster (“Schwann”). SCs were then classified as either  98 MET + or  MET –  based on  MET  gene expression greater than ( MET + ) or equal to ( MET – ) zero. DEG analysis was then performed to compare  MET +  and  MET –  populations using Seurat’s FindMarkers function. A min.pct = 0.1 and log fold change (FC) threshold = 0.25 were set to filter out genes with low expression levels and small FCs. GSEA was performed using the fgsea package (version 1.14.0, RRID:SCR_020938). The prepare_ranked_genelist function was used to create a ranked list of genes based on their average log 2 FC. The perform_gsea function was used to perform GSEA on the ranked list using the Hallmark gene sets or KEGG pathways from the Molecular Signatures Database with pathway size constraints of 15 to 500 genes. An enhanced GSEA visualization function (plot_pathway_enrichment_enhanced) was used to create mountain plots for the specific pathways. GSEA comparing NLRP3 +  and NLRP3 –  macrophages was executed similarly. Plot_gsea_results was used to generate the bar plot showing the top 20 pathways ranked by normalized enrichment score in  Fig. 3K . 
Population-based expression contribution analysis
 For the population-based expression contribution analyses in  Fig. 4 (C and D) , cell type annotations were consolidated into broader categories by combining related subtypes to increase ease of interpretability: Nonmyelinating SCs (nmSC1 to nmSC5) were grouped as “nmSC,” myelinating SCs (mSC1 to mSC3) as “mSC,” dendritic cells (DC1 and DC2) as “DCs,” T cell subtypes (CD4 T, CD8 T, CD8 T Prolif, and other T) as “T cells,” and macrophage subtypes (Macrophage1 and Macrophage2) as “Macrophages.” Endothelial cells (Endo), B cells (B cells), vascular smooth muscle cells/pericytes (Peri/VS), fibroblasts (Fb), and natural killer (NK) cells remained as distinct categories. For each gene of interest ( MET  or  HGF ), the total expression within each cell type was calculated and normalized to the percentage of total expression across all cells using dplyr (RRID:SCR_022628). These population-level expression metrics were calculated to reflect the percentage contribution to the overall expression across all cell types and account for differences in cell type abundance. Visualizations were generated using ggplot2 and included bar plots showing the percentage of total gene expression contributed by each cell type. 
CellChat analysis
 CellChat (version 2.1.2, RRID:SCR_021946) was used to assess cell-cell communication within human VS ( ). The normalized, log-transformed gene expression data matrix and assigned labels were extracted from the Seurat object generated above and used as input to construct a CellChat object. The human ligand-receptor CellChat database was subset to focus on secreted signaling pathways, and the data were preprocessed to identify overexpressed ligand-receptor interactions. The probability of communication between cell groups was computed using a truncated mean method (trim = 0.05) to build an intracellular communication network, which was extracted as a data frame for further analysis. Pathway-level communication probabilities were also computed and aggregated for downstream visualization of the HGF signaling pathway. A chord diagram was used to visualize communication dynamics between grouped cell types. A heatmap representation was used to depict the communication probability between various cell types. Last, centrality analysis was conducted to identify and visualize dominant signal senders, receivers, influencers, and mediators within the HGF pathway. 99 Kinome profiling MIB/MS was conducted to identify and quantitate the activity of the expressed kinome and their responses to drug treatment as previously described ( ,  84 – 96 ). Lysates prepared from NF2-deficient murine Schwannoma cell line (MS03) treated with 1 μM defactinib or VS-4718 for 24 hours were prepared and loaded onto the column containing multiple inhibitor-conjugated beads ( 97 ,  96 ). In a separate experiment, the parental immortalized human SC line (02.3) and  97 NF2  knockout clones (described above) were harvested, lysed, and used for inhibitor bead enrichment. Kinase-bound inhibitor beads were stringently washed, followed by protein purification and trypsin digestion. Liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, and analysis were performed essentially as previously described ( ,  96 ). Peptide suspension was separated using an EASY nLC-1200 System with an Easy-Spray C-18 column (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Raw files were processed for label-free quantification (LFQ) using MaxQuant LFQ and default parameters with the following modifications—razor plus unique peptides were used, matching between runs (3-min match time window), fixed modifications [carbidomethy (C)] and variable modifications [oxidation (M) and acetyl (protein N-terminal)], and searching the mouse (MS03) or human (02.3) UniProt databases ( 97 ). Kinase LFQ intensities were used if two or more unique + razor peptides were detected, and missing values were imputed in Perseus if observed in all replicates of at least one condition after log 98 2  transformation for comparison. Data for each treated sample were plotted as a mean of FC (log 2 ) relative to DMSO- or vehicle-treated control. When at least three replicates were available, unpaired Student’s  t  tests were performed in R. A  P  value of less than or equal to 0.05 was used as a cutoff for significance. Sciatic Nerve Atlas 
Bulk RNA-seq of Nlrp3 expression across SC development
 Bar plot of  Nlrp3  expression at respective stages of embryonic and postnatal development was obtained using bulk transcriptome analysis of fluorescence-activated cell sorting–isolated, P0Cre eYFP reporter–labeled SCs from the SNAT web portal ( www.snat.ethz.ch ) developed by Gerber  et al.  ( ). 28 
scRNA-seq data from the iSNAT
 UMAPs depicting the expression of  Nlrp3 ,  Hgf , and  Met  at baseline and 1 or 3 days postinjury were obtained from the iSNAT web portal ( https://cdb-rshiny.med.umich.edu/Giger_iSNAT/ ) developed by Zhao  et al.  ( ). HGF signaling network data from 1, 3, and 7 days postinjury were also obtained from the iSNAT web portal using the CellChat module ( 36 ,  36 ). 99 Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed in R studio (RRID:SCR_000432) or using GraphPad Prism 9.5.1 software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, RRID:SCR_002798). Specific analyses used to identify statistically significant differences between groups are detailed in the corresponding figure legends.  P  ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant for all analyses. For in vivo murine studies, a 5% type I error rate was assumed, and a power analysis was conducted to determine the appropriate sample size. Approximately  n  = 15 animals per group was determined necessary for the detection of a 40% difference in tumor size with greater than 85% power. Specific details related to individual analyses are described in the respective figure legends.

PMID:29590612,A Conserved Circadian Function for the Neurofibromatosis 1 Gene.,"Loss of the Neurofibromatosis 1 (Nf1) protein, neurofibromin, in Drosophila disrupts circadian rhythms of locomotor activity without impairing central clock function, suggesting effects downstream of the clock. However, the relevant cellular mechanisms are not known. Leveraging the discovery of output circuits for locomotor rhythms, we dissected cellular actions of neurofibromin in recently identified substrates. Herein, we show that neurofibromin affects the levels and cycling of calcium in multiple circadian peptidergic neurons. A prominent site of action is the pars intercerebralis (PI), the fly equivalent of the hypothalamus, with cell-autonomous effects of Nf1 in PI cells that secrete DH44. Nf1 interacts genetically with peptide signaling to affect circadian behavior. We extended these studies to mammals to demonstrate that mouse astrocytes exhibit a 24-hr rhythm of calcium levels, which is also attenuated by lack of neurofibromin. These findings establish a conserved role for neurofibromin in intracellular signaling rhythms within the nervous system.","EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Fly Lines The GAL4 lines were used previously in the lab ( Bai and Sehgal, 2015 ;  Cavanaugh et al., 2014 ;  Crocker et al., 2010 ).  Nf1 ,  P1 Nf1 , and UAS- P2 Nf1  lines were reported ( Williams et al., 2001 ) and were outcrossed into an  iso31  background for 7 generations. Bloomington line Df27352 was used as an  SIFa  deficiency allele (2R:60C2;60D14) tested in transheterozygotes with  SIFa  CRISPR alleles. CaLexA flies were a gift from J. Wang. UAS-RedStinger flies were obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center. Generation of  Nsyb-GS  Flies nsyb-GS  construct was generated using Gateway cloning (Invitrogen) and the construct was targeted to the PhiC31-attP2 landing site on the third chromosome (3L:68A4) in  Drosophila . A 1,917 bp fragment of the  Drosophila n-synap-tobrevin  (Nsyb) promoter (matching the fragment used to generate  Nsyb-GAL4  flies by Julie Simpson, Janelia Farm Research Campus) was PCR amplified from  Canton-S  flies and recombined into the Gateway pDonr221 vector using primers containing Gateway attB1/2 sites: attB1_Nsyb1917_5′, 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTgaattcgacctcaaagatggaagc-3′, and attB2_Nsyb1917_3′, 5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTAgaattcggctgtc gatgattagg-3′. The  Geneswitch  transgene was PCR amplified from  Elav-GS  flies ( Osterwalder et al., 2001 ) and recombined into the Gateway pDonrP2rP3 vector using primers containing a 5′ Kozac sequence and Gateway attB2r/3 sites: attB2r_GS_5′, 5′-GGGGACAGCTTTCTTGTACAAAGTGGAAcaacatgga ctcccagcagccaga-3′, and attB3_GS_3′, 5′-GGGGACAACTTTGTATAATAAAG TTGCttaggagctgatctgactcagcaggg-3′. Entry vector insertions were verified by sequencing. The  Nsyb  promoter sequence was largely similar, but not identical, to sequences in FlyBase (4 mismatches).  Nsyb -promoter and  Genes-witch  entry vectors were recombined into the  Drosophila  pBPGUw-R1R3-p10 vector ( Haynes et al., 2015 ) and injected into flies. To verify induction of UAS expression with RU-486,  Nsyb-GS  flies were crossed to  UAS-mCD8-GFP  and brain-GFP expression was compared in flies fed with or without 500 μM RU-486 (Mifepristone, Sigma) in the food. Although a low level of GFP expression was apparent in flies without RU-486, indicating some leakiness, GFP intensity was dramatically brighter in flies fed RU-486. Generation of  SIFa  Mutants The  SIFa  mutants were generated with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing ( Port et al., 2014 ). Tandem  SIFa -targeting guide RNA sequences flanking the  SIFa  coding region were introduced into pCFD4 (Addgene plasmid 49411) using the primers  SIFa -KO-Forward (5′-TATATAGGAA AGATATCCGGGTGAACTTCGTAggctcgagatcagttctGTTTTAGAGCTAGAAAT AGCAAG-3′) and SIFa-KO-Reverse (5′-ATTTTAACTTGCTATTTCTAGCT CTAAAACcaacgctcaccgaaaactgcGACGTTAAATTGAAAATAGGTC-3′) ( SIFa -specific sequences are in lowercase) and following the protocol as described in  http://www.crisprflydesign.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Cloning-with-pCFD4.pdf . The targeting plasmid was injected into fly embryos (Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center [BDSC] 51323) using BestGene Transgenic services. We screened for deletions in the  SIFa  gene region with PCR sequencing using the primers  SIFa _del_F1 (5′-aagcaggagagcgagttcag-3′) and  SIFa _del_R1 (5′-ttcgccttgttttgtcacag-3′). Three  SIFa  deletion lines with minor differences in the  SIFa  genomic region were characterized ( SIFa  deletion 2R:24577800-24578100,  1 SIFa  deletion 2R:24577763-24578080, and  2 SIFa  deletion 2R:24577787-24578087). All three deletions cover both exons of  3 SIFa . The mutant lines were backcrossed to iso31 flies 7 times before testing. Immunohistochemistry Adult fly brains were dissected in cold PBS with 0.1% Triton-X (PBST) and fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 15–20 min on ice. Brains were rinsed 3 × 10 min with PBST, blocked for 30–60 min in 5% normal donkey serum in PBST (NDST), and incubated overnight (ON) at 4°C in primary antibody diluted in NDST. Brains were then rinsed 4 × 10 min in PBST, incubated 2 hr in secondary antibody diluted in NDST, rinsed 4 × 10 min in PBST, and mounted with Vectashield. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-GFP 1:1,000 (Molecular Probes A-11122), rabbit anti-DH44 1:500 ( Johnson et al., 2005 ), guinea pig anti-PER 1:1,000 (I. Edery), mouse anti-PDF 1:500 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank PDFC7; generated by J. Blau), and rabbit anti-SIFa 1:4,000 (gift from J. Veenstra). Secondary antibodies were as follows: Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit 1:500 (Molecular Probes A-11008), fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) anti-guinea pig 1:500 (Jackson Laboratory 106-095-003), Cy5 donkey anti-mouse 1:400 (Jackson Laboratory 715-175-151), and Alexa Fluor 633 goat anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes A-21070). GFP signal from the CaLexA reporter system was detected with rabbit anti-GFP antibody followed by Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Immunolabeled brains were visualized with a TCS SP5 confocal microscope. Image Analysis All images were analyzed with ImageJ software. For PDF intensity at sLNv dorsal termini, the terminus region was manually selected as a box, including the axon terminus upward from the branching point, and then thresholded with the average background staining level for the boxed region. The integrated intensity was measured and compared between genotypes. For quantification of CaLexA signals, each cytoplasmic area was manually selected and mean intensity was measured. Nuclear RedStinger expression is calcium independent and was used to normalize the GFP signals, except in  Figure 2C , where the GFP signals were normalized to the mean background intensity of the brain. Sleep Assays Sleep was monitored with the single-beam Drosophila Activity Monitoring System (Trikinetics, Waltham, MA) or, when indicated, with multi-beam monitors (Trikinetics, Waltham, MA) as described previously ( Bai and Sehgal, 2015 ). Rest:Activity Rhythm Analysis Locomotor activity assays were performed with the Drosophila Activity Monitoring System (Trikinetics, MA) as described previously ( Cavanaugh et al., 2014 ). Individual male flies were loaded into glass tubes containing 5% sucrose and 2% agar. Flies were entrained to a 12:12 light:dark (LD) cycle for 3 days and then transferred to constant darkness. Locomotor activity during days 1–7 in constant darkness was analyzed with Clocklab software (Actimetrics, Wilmette, IL). A fly was considered rhythmic if it met 2 criteria: it displayed (1) a rhythm with 95% confidence using χ 2  periodogram analysis and (2) a corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) value above 0.01 for the determined period. Rhythm strength was categorized as weak (0.01–0.03), moderate (0.03–0.05), or strong (≥0.05). Rhythms in Astrocyte Cultures Wild-type and  Nf1  astrocyte cultures were generated as previously described ( −/− Smithson and Gutmann, 2016 ). Brainstem astrocytes obtained from  Nf1 flox/flox  mouse pups (postnatal days 1–2) were infected with adenovirus type 5 containing β-galactosidase (Ad5-LacZ) or Cre recombinase (Ad5-Cre) (University of Iowa Gene Transfer Core, Iowa City, IA) to produce wild-type or  Nf1  astrocytes, respectively. Loss of neurofibromin expression was confirmed by western blotting (Santa Cruz sc-67). −/− Following three passages (including those in which cells were generated and manipulated to delete  Nf1 ), wild-type and  Nf1  astrocytes were seeded overnight at 50,000 cells per well in 24 wells with collagen-coated coverslips. 24 hr after treatment with 1 μM dexamethasone (Sigma D2915), 4 μM Cal 520 acetoxymethyl ester (AM) (Abcam ab171868) in Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS; Thermo Fisher Scientific 14175079) buffer with 1 mM probenecid (Abcam ab145725) was added into the wells at the indicated time points, and the cells were incubated at 37°C for 2 hr. The addition of probenecid inhibited organic anion transporters and thereby reduce efflux of the calcium indicator from the cell. The cells were washed three times with HBSS containing 1 mM probenecid and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). They were imaged with a fluorescence microscope using FITC (excitation [Ex.] = 492 nm and emission [Em.] = 514 nm) and DAPI (Ex. = 370 nm and Em. = 460 nm) filter sets with the same light exposure time. For statistical analysis, the fluorescence intensity of ten wild-type or mutant cells was measured at each time point using ImageJ analysis software, and the results were plotted as line graphs. For statistical analyses of circadian parameters, the calcium data were subjected to Jonckheere-Terpstra-Kendall (JTK)_CYCLE and Lomb-Scargle (LS) analysis using the Meta-cycle R program as described ( −/− Wu et al., 2016 ). Statistics Data were analyzed and plotted with the GraphPad Prism software.

PMID:8176761,Modulation of neurofibromatosis type 1 gene expression during in vitro myoblast differentiation.,"Neurofibromin, the protein product of the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene, has two alternate isoforms which are generated by alternative splicing of two exons. One of these isoforms containing exon 48a is expressed at highest levels in muscle. Since neurofibromin is a p21-ras regulator and has been recently shown to be modulated during Schwann cell differentiation, we examined the expression of the NF1 gene product during in vitro muscle differentiation. Previous work demonstrated that C2C12 murine myoblast cell differentiation could be blocked by the introduction of an activated p21-ras protein. Using this model system, we demonstrate that differentiating C2C12 cells upregulate the expression of NF1 mRNA by 2 days of serum starvation concomitant with increased expression of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor mRNA. This upregulation of mRNA expression paralleled an increase in neurofibromin and N-ras levels, but no change in the relative abundance of the isoforms containing exon 23a or exon 48a was observed during in vitro myoblast differentiation. The increase in neurofibromin levels paralleled a decrease in the levels of activated p21-ras as assayed by in vivo 32P-orthophosphate incorporation into p21-ras. These results suggest that in vitro C2C12 cell differentiation is associated with a concomitant increase in NF1 gene expression and decrease in the proportion of activated p21-ras.",,D H Gutmann; J L Cole; F S Collins,Journal of neuroscience research,1994-02-15,10.1002/jnr.490370312,abstract_only,False
PMID:17216419,Nf1 expression is dependent on strain background: implications for tumor suppressor haploinsufficiency studies.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the most common cancer predisposition syndrome affecting the nervous system, with elevated risk for both astrocytoma and peripheral nerve sheath tumors. NF1 is caused by a germline mutation in the NF1 gene, with tumors showing loss of the wild type copy of NF1. In addition, NF1 heterozygosity in surrounding stroma is important for tumor formation, suggesting an additional role of haploinsufficiency for NF1. Studies in mouse models and NF1 families have implicated modifier genes unlinked to NF1 in the severity of the disease and in susceptibility to astrocytoma and peripheral nerve sheath tumors. To determine if differences in Nf1 expression may contribute to the strain-specific effects on tumor predisposition, we examined the levels of Nf1 gene expression in mouse strains with differences in tumor susceptibility using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The data presented in this paper demonstrate that strain background has as much effect on Nf1 expression levels as mutation of one Nf1 allele, indicating that studies of haploinsufficiency must be carefully interpreted with respect to strain background. Because expression levels do not correlate entirely with the susceptibility or resistance to tumors observed in the strain, these data suggest that either variation in Nf1 levels is not responsible for the differences in astrocytoma and peripheral nerve sheath tumor susceptibility in Nf1-/+;Trp53-/+cis mice, or that certain mouse strains have evolved compensatory mechanisms for differences in Nf1 expression.","Materials and methods Bioinformatics The GeneNetwork ( http://www.genenetwork.org/search.html ) was searched for  Nf1  in mouse B×D datasets from the brain. Specifically, the INIA Brain mRNA M430 (April 2005) PDNN dataset of mid- and forebrain expression arrays and the HBP/Rosen Striatum M430v2 (April 2005) PDNN of striatum expression arrays were examined. Probe sets were verified for their binding to the  Nf1  mRNA using a blast-like alignment tool (BLAT) search in the UCSC Genome Browser that is linked to GeneNetwork. The Affy array probes 1452525_a_at_A and 1438067_at_A were chosen as validated probes for  Nf1 . WebQTL interval mapping was used to determine regions of the genome responsible for variation in  Nf1  expression levels across different B×D strains. Permutation tests with 1,000 replicates were used in the WebQTL program to determine the statistical significance of the mapping, with the significance threshold set to  P =0.05 and a suggestive threshold set to  P =0.63. Bootstrap sampling by WebQTL was also used to confirm the best location of the linkage peaks. cDNA Templates All samples were derived from female mice between 2 and 3 months of age. All mice were bred and maintained at the National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Frederick according to the guidelines and regulations of the Animal Care and Use Committee.  NPcis  mice on the C57BL/6J background were backcrossed greater than 20 generations.  NPcis  mice on the 129S4/SvJae background were maintained as inbred from the time of generating the mutant  Nf1  and  Trp53  allele. Brain samples include the forebrain and midbrain minus the olfactory bulb. Brains and sciatic nerves were immediately frozen on dry ice after dissection and stored at −80°C. A dounce homogenizer was used to homogenize brain tissue, and a grinder was used to homogenize sciatic nerve tissues. Total RNA was extracted with TRIZOL according to manufacturer’s instructions. An amount of 10 μg RNA was treated with DNase (DNA-free, Ambion) and repurified using the Qiagen RNEasy kit. RNA samples were normalized to 100 ng/ml (±5 ng/ml) for brain or 75 ng/ml (±5 ng/ml) for sciatic nerve. An amount of 50 ng of total mRNA was reverse transcribed into Cdna using oligo dT primers and the SuperScript III First-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. A volume of 1 μl of cDNA from each reverse transcriptase reaction was used as template for PCR experiments. Primers The sequence for the  Nf1  primer set number 1 forward primer is 5′-CGCAGCAGCACCCACATTTAC-3′,and the sequence of the reverse primer is 5′-ACTGTGGCGGGGACTCCTCA-3′. The sequence for the  Nf1  primer set number 2 forward primer is 5′-TTCTTGATGCCTTGATTGAC-3′, and the sequence of the reverse primer is 5′-CACTTGGCTTGCGGAT. The sequence for the  Nf1  exon 9a primer set number 1 forward primer is 5′-ACGAGAGCAACATAAACAAGAAG-3′, and the sequence of the reverse primer is 5′-AGAAGCAGTGC CAAGTCCAT-3′. The sequence for the  Nf1  exon 9a primer set number 2 (data not shown) forward primer is 5′-TTGTGTCAAGTTGTGTAAAGC-3′, and the sequence of the reverse primer is 5′-AGAAGCAGTGCCAAGTCCAT-3′. The forward (5′-CCGGGGCAGCCAACAGTACC-3′) and reverse (5′-CTCGGGGCGGGATGTCACAC-3′) β-tubulin primers used as internal controls have been previously described elsewhere [ 30 ]. Primers and PCR fragments were checked for the presence of SNPs between the B6 and 129 strains in the current Mouse Genome Build 36, and no SNPs were found. Standard PCR ThermalAce DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) was used in all standard PCR reactions. Annealing temperature gradients between 50 and 70°C were used to determine the ideal annealing temperature for each primer set. PCR products were separated on 2% agarose/1×TAE DNA gels. Quantitative PCR Brilliant SYBR Green (Stratagene), master mix or core kit, was used for each qPCR reaction. A volume of 1 μl of each cDNA template was assayed in duplicate alongside an internal control (β-tubulin), also in duplicate. PCR products were analyzed for the number of cycles required to reach the threshold using a quantitative real-time PCR machine, the MX4000 (Stratagene). MX4000 software was used to calculate the relative amount of each product compared to internal β-tubulin controls and a standard calibrator. All data were calculated as percent (%) control of the average WT C57BL/6 values. Significance was determined using repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s HSD post hoc test [ 31 ] ( http://www.graphpad.com/articles/library.cfm ) with  P <0.05 considered to be significant. Nf1 knockout embryos Heterozygous  Nf1  mice were bred to generate litters of WT, heterozygous, and knockout embryos. On embryonic day 13.5, pregnant female mice were euthanized by CO 2  asphyxiation, and the embryos were rapidly removed and placed in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Embryos were removed and washed three times for 5 min in fresh PBS. Embryos were then sectioned for DNA or RNA extraction and frozen on dry ice. Breeding of mice and isolation of embryos were performed according to the guidelines and regulations of the NCI-Frederick Animal Care and Use Committee.",Jessica J Hawes; Robert G Tuskan; Karlyne M Reilly,Neurogenetics,2007-04,10.1007/s10048-006-0078-5,minimal,True
PMID:41695895,Outcomes of Surgical Intervention of Dystrophic Cervical Kyphosis in Patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 1: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: Spinal deformities occur in 10 to 77% of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) cases. The dystrophic type of NF1 progresses rapidly and can cause severe neurological complications if left untreated. Surgical intervention is necessary, as bracing is ineffective. Although the joint anterior-posterior (AP) approach provides better correction than single approaches, it carries higher surgical risks, leading to an ongoing debate about optimal treatment strategies. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted across the Scopus, Embase, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases from inception to June 2024. Data on clinical characteristics, treatment approaches, radiological and functional outcomes, and complications were systematically collected and synthesized in a narrative format. RESULTS: Six studies involving 124 patients were analyzed, comprising five case series and one retrospective observational study. The AP approach showed better correction outcomes than the anterior-only (AO) and posterior-only approaches. All surgical approaches resulted in significant functional improvements, as reflected by increased Japanese Orthopaedic Association/modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores, decreased Visual Analog Scale scores, and reduced Neck Disability Index scores. However, the AP approach was associated with a higher incidence of complications, while the AO approach had the lowest incidence. CONCLUSIONS: Existing evidence demonstrates that the AP approach leads to a better degree of correction than the AO or posterior-only approaches, despite higher complication rates. The dual mechanism of anterior reconstruction and posterior stabilization effectively addresses the challenges associated with dystrophic cervical kyphosis in patients with NF1.","Methods  A systematic search was conducted across the Scopus, Embase, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases from inception to June 2024. Data on clinical characteristics, treatment approaches, radiological and functional outcomes, and complications were systematically collected and synthesized in a narrative format.  Materials and Methods Search Strategy and Selection Criteria We searched four major databases: Scopus, Embase, PubMed, and Google Scholar, using Boolean operators. The search keywords used were: “cervical dystrophic,” “cervical kyphosis,” “correction,” “surgery,” and “Neurofibromatosis type 1,” both individually and in combination. There were no restrictions on the publication year, and the search was limited to studies published in the English language. All study designs, including prospective, retrospective, and case series, that evaluated surgical outcomes, were included. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines were followed for the systematic review of the degree of correction. The inclusion criteria for the studies were as follows: patients diagnosed with dystrophic cervical kyphosis and NF1, degree of correction (pre- and postoperative), patients with Cobb angle >40 degrees, functional outcomes (Japanese Orthopaedics Association [JOA] or Modified Japanese Orthopaedics Association [mJOA] scores), and reported complications. The exclusion criteria were as follows: patients diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 2, non-dystrophic kyphosis, cervical kyphosis caused by other factors (e.g., trauma, infection, degeneration, or post-laminectomy), case reports, case series with fewer than five patients, studies without sufficient outcome data, and non-English studies. Screening and Data Extraction Study selection and data extraction were independently conducted by two investigators, with an arbiter resolving any disagreements. For studies with duplicate patient populations, only the most recent publication was included. Data encompassing population characteristics, interventions, and outcomes were systematically extracted from text, tables, and figures using a standardized Excel sheet. All the authors contributed to the final review and ensured adherence to the highest methodological standards. Quality Assessment Two independent authors assessed the methodological quality of the full text using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool, which evaluates the quality of observational studies and case series. Each author independently and blindly scored the included studies. Following the scoring process, the authors convened with an arbiter to discuss any discrepancies and reached a consensus on the final score. Outcome Measurement The primary outcome measures were: (1) Postoperative correction degree (Cobb angle, C2-7 sagittal vertical axis [SVA], T1 slope), and (2) Postoperative cervical compression myelopathy severity (JOA/mJOA). Secondary outcomes included the severity of postoperative neck pain such as visual analog scale (VAS) or neck disability index (NDI) score, and types of complications. Data Synthesis and Analysis Due to the limited literature on dystrophic cervical kyphosis in patients with NF1 and the variance in surgical approaches reported across studies, a meta-analysis could not be conducted. Consequently, the data will predominantly be synthesized narratively and will include systematically organized tables that summarize the outcomes and relevant variables derived from all studies included in this review.",Dewa Gde Prema Ananda; Ida Bagus Sutha Dwipajaya; Ida Bagus Artha Vijaya Antara; Nia Irayati; Asra Al Fauzi,Spine surgery and related research,2026-01-27,10.22603/ssrr.2025-0061,minimal,True
PMID:9222967,Four frameshift mutations in neurofibromatosis type 1 caused by small insertions.,"We have been using heteroduplex analysis to assay individual exons within the NF1 gene in an effort to identify disease causing constitutional mutations in neurofibromatosis type 1 patients. Here we report the identification and characterisation of four insertional NF1 frameshift mutations in an analysis of exons 28-39 in a set of 78 patients. These include three 1 base pair insertions and one 2 base pair insertion. Three of these mutations can be attributed to replication slippage errors, while the mechanism behind the fourth may be related to formation of secondary structure during replication. It may be of significance that a majority of the previously reported small insertions in NF1 also lie within exons 28-39.",,S D Colman; C R Abernathy; V T Ho; M R Wallace,Journal of medical genetics,1997-07,10.1136/jmg.34.7.579,abstract_only,False
PMID:27760236,Disease Burden and Symptom Structure of Autism in Neurofibromatosis Type 1: A Study of the International NF1-ASD Consortium Team (INFACT).,"IMPORTANCE: Recent reports have demonstrated a higher incidence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and substantially elevated autistic trait burden in individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). However, important discrepancies regarding the distribution of autistic traits, sex predominance, and association between ASD symptoms and attentional problems have emerged, and critical features of the ASD phenotype within NF1 have never been adequately explored. Establishing NF1 as a monogenic cause for ASD has important implications for affected patients and for future research focused on establishing convergent pathogenic mechanisms relevant to the potential treatment targets for ASD. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the quantitative autistic trait (QAT) burden in a pooled NF1 data set. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Anonymized, individual-level primary data were accumulated from 6 tertiary referral centers in the United States, Belgium, United Kingdom, and Australia. A total of 531 individuals recruited from NF1 clinical centers were included in the study. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Distribution of ASD traits (Social Responsiveness Scale, second edition [SRS-2], with T scores of ≥75 associated with a categorical ASD diagnosis); attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) traits (4 versions of Conners Rating Scale, with T scores of ≥65 indicating clinically significant ADHD symptoms); ASD symptom structure, latent structure, base rate derived from mixture modeling; and familiality. RESULTS: Of the 531 patients included in the analysis, 247 were male (46.5%); median age was 11 years (range, 2.5-83.9 years). QAT scores were continuously distributed and pathologically shifted; 13.2% (95% CI, 10.3%-16.1%) of individuals scored within the most severe range (ie, above the first percentile of the general population distribution) in which the male to female ratio was markedly attenuated (1.6:1) relative to idiopathic ASD. Autistic symptoms in this NF1 cohort demonstrated a robust unitary factor structure, with the first principal component explaining 30.9% of the variance in SRS-2 scores, and a strong association with ADHD symptoms (r = 0.61). Within-family correlation for QAT burden (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.73 in NF1-affected first-degree relatives) exceeded that observed in the general population and ASD family samples. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study provides confirmation that the diversity of mutations that give rise to NF1 function as quantitative trait loci for ASD. Moreover, the within-family correlation implicates a high degree of mutational specificity for this associated phenotype. Clinicians should be alerted to the increased frequency of this disabling comorbidity, and the scientific community should be aware of the potential for this monogenic disorder to help elucidate the biological features of idiopathic autism.","Methods Anonymized, individual-level primary data were pooled from 6 tertiary referral centers: Washington University School of Medicine ; University of California, San Francisco 8 ; Children’s National Health System 9 ; University Hospital of Leuven 10 ; The University of Manchester 11 ; and The Children’s Hospital at Westmead. For all patients, diagnosis of NF1 was established using the National Institutes of Health diagnostic criteria. 12  Data were collected for a total of 691 unique individuals. Following data cleaning and removal of reports with missing items that exceeded published reliability thresholds, 531 total patients were available for analysis. Individuals ranged in age from 2.5 to 83.9 years (median, 11 years). A total of 247 of the patients (46.5%) were males; there was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of males across sites. Detailed information on the samples collected at each site are summarized in  6 Table 1 . An ASD-enriched subsample (n = 79) recruited for inclusion in an NF1-ASD clinical trial ( eTable 1 in the Supplement ) was also included for the purpose of comparison factor analysis and subsequent sensitivity analysis. Data collection at each site was approved by the respective institutional review boards (University of California, Los Angeles, Institutional Review Board; University of California, San Francisco, Human Research Protection Program; Washington University Human Research Protection Office; Greater Manchester South Ethics Committee; Greater Manchester West Ethics Committee; Leuven University Hospital Ethics Committee; Children’s National Medical Center Institutional Review Board, and Sydney Children’s Hospitals Network Human Research Ethics Committee), and written informed consent was obtained for each participant. The cooperative data-sharing and analysis plan was reviewed by the Washington University Human Research Protection Office, and the analysis of pooled data was designated as nonresearch given the use of deidentified existing data. Measurement of Quantitative Autistic Traits The Social Responsiveness Scale, second edition (SRS-2) is an extensively validated, 65-item quantitative trait measure  designed to ascertain the presence and severity of social communicative and repetitive behaviors that characterize ASD. Items are rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale and contribute to 2 empirically derived subscales that correspond to the criterion domains for ASD as described in the  16 DSM-5 .  T scores of 60 or higher indicate clinically significant ASD symptoms, and T scores of 75 or higher are associated with categorical ASD diagnosis, with a sensitivity of 0.85 and specificity of 0.75 for generating a consensus diagnosis of ASD. 1  For children, the ratings were completed by parents or guardians. For adults, the ratings were completed by either self-report (10 [1.8%]) or by a parent, spouse, or close friend. Ten individuals younger than 30 months and 71 with invalid SRS reports owing to missing data (median, 65 missing items; range, 7–65) were excluded from analysis. 17 Measurement of Attention Problems Four versions of the Conners ADHD rating scales were used across sites: Conners, third edition,  Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale, 18  Conners Parent Rating Scale–Revised, 19  and Conners ADHD/ 20 DSM-IV  Scales.  This system exhibits robust sensitivity (92.3%) and specificity (94.5%) for generating a consensus diagnosis of ADHD. 21  Items are rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale and generate categorical scores characterizing impairments in ADHD including hyperactivity, inattentiveness, and an ADHD index (AI) score, which are comparable across measurement instruments. Total AI scores of 65 or higher indicate clinically significant ADHD symptomatology. 22 Statistical Analysis Categorical variables are reported as frequencies and proportions and compared using logistic regression methods. Continuously distributed traits adhering to both conventional normality assumptions and homogeneity of variances are reported as mean (SD) and compared using analysis of variance methods. Nonparametric equivalents were used for data with nonnormative distributions. Within-family association of quantitative ASD impairment was investigated using intraclass correlation, implementing a 2-way random effects model. Correlations between neurobehavioral traits were investigated using Pearson correlation coefficient. A weighted least-squares factor analysis with oblique rotation was applied to evaluate the factor structure of ASD traits with and without inclusion of the ASD-enriched sample. Highest-loading items on the first principal component generated from factor analysis of the ASD-enriched sample were used to derive a principal factor score that was subsequently tested in sensitivity analysis against a subset of cases from The University of Manchester, in which categorical research diagnoses had been previously derived.  With the use of empirically derived SRS factors, a series of mixture models (MPlus, version 7.3) 13  were used to investigate the presence of latent classes ( 23 eMethods in the Supplement ).

PMID:39106942,Investigating therapeutic nonsense suppression in a neurofibromatosis mouse model.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a human genetic disorder caused by variants in the NF1 gene. Plexiform neurofibromas, one of many NF1 manifestations, are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors occurring in up to 50% of NF1 patients. A substantial fraction of NF1 pathogenetic variants are nonsense mutations, which result in the synthesis of truncated non-functional NF1 protein (neurofibromin). To date, no therapeutics have restored neurofibromin expression or addressed the consequences of this protein's absence in NF1 nonsense mutation patients, but nonsense suppression is a potential approach to the problem. Ataluren is a small molecule drug that has been shown to stimulate functional nonsense codon readthrough in several models of nonsense mutation diseases, as well as in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients. To test ataluren's potential applicability in nonsense mutation NF1 patients, we evaluated its therapeutic effects using three treatment regimens in a previously established NF1 patient-derived (c.2041C > T; p.Arg681X) nonsense mutation mouse model. Collectively, our experiments indicate that: i) ataluren appeared to slow the growth of neurofibromas and alleviate some paralysis phenotypes, ii) female Nf1-nonsense mutation mice manifested more severe paralysis and neurofibroma phenotypes than male mice, iii) ataluren doses with apparent effectiveness were lower in female mice than in male mice, and iv) age factors also influenced ataluren's effectiveness.",,Chan Wu; Mohammed Salman Shazeeb; Kotchaphorn Mangkalaphiban; George Han; Ahmet Peker; Zubir S Rentiya; Matthew J Gounis; Allan Jacobson,Experimental neurology,2024-10,10.1016/j.expneurol.2024.114914,abstract_only,False
PMID:16314489,Inactivation of NF1 in CNS causes increased glial progenitor proliferation and optic glioma formation.,"The gene responsible for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) encodes a tumor suppressor that functions as a negative regulator of the Ras proto-oncogene. Individuals with germline mutations in NF1 are predisposed to the development of benign and malignant tumors of the peripheral and central nervous system (CNS). Children with this disease suffer a high incidence of optic gliomas, a benign but potentially debilitating tumor of the optic nerve; and an increased incidence of malignant astrocytoma, reactive astrogliosis and intellectual deficits. In the present study, we have sought insight into the molecular and cellular basis of NF1-associated CNS pathologies. We show that mice genetically engineered to lack NF1 in CNS exhibit a variety of defects in glial cells. Primary among these is a developmental defect resulting in global reactive astrogliosis in the adult brain and increased proliferation of glial progenitor cells leading to enlarged optic nerves. As a consequence, all of the mutant optic nerves develop hyperplastic lesions, some of which progress to optic pathway gliomas. These data point to hyperproliferative glial progenitors as the source of the optic tumors and provide a genetic model for NF1-associated astrogliosis and optic glioma.","Materials and methods Control and mutant mice The control mice used in this study are the pool of phenotypically indistinguishable mice with genotypes  Nf1 flox /flox ,  Nf1 flox /+  and  Nf1 flox /+ ; hGFAP- cre+. The mutant mice designated  Nf1  include both  hGFAP KO Nf1 flox /− ; hGFAP- cre+ and  Nf1 flox /flox ; hGFAP- cre+, which have similar phenotypes. The genotyping procedures for the Nf1flox allele,  Nf1 -null allele and Cre transgene have been described previously ( Zhu et al., 2001 ). Size and weight analysis of mice Nf1  and control littermates at the age of P0.5, P8 and 2 months were used to determine mass (g). Age-matched mutant and control mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were dissected and post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight, and separated into forebrain and hindbrain for analysis. Statistical analysis was carried out using Student’s  hGFAP KO t -test.  P <0.05 was considered to be significant. lacZ  staining and double immunofluorescence E10.5, E12.5 embryos or cryostat sections from postnatal or adult tissues were prepared and subjected to X-gal analysis as described previously ( Zhu et al., 1998 ). Adjacent sections were subjected to double immunofluorescence with anti- lacZ  (rabbit, 1:200, 5′ and 3′) and anti-NeuN (mouse, 1:200, Chemicon) or anti- lacZ  and anti-GFAP (mouse, 1:100, Pharmingen). BrdU assay P8 mutant and control littermates were pulsed with BrdU for 2 hours, and adult mice (4–6 months) were pulsed with BrdU five times a day at 2-hour intervals. The dose of BrdU was 50 μg/g (gram, body mass). Mice were perfused with 4% PFA 2 hours after the last pulse. Brains were dissected and processed for either paraffin-embedded or cryostat sections. BrdU immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously ( Zhu et al., 1998 ). The dilution of BrdU antibody was 1:50 (Becton Dickinson). The number of BrdU-positive cells was counted in one out of each ten serially prepared sections. Statistical analysis was carried out using Student’s  t -test.  P <0.05 was considered to be significant. Immunohistochemistry After post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight, tissues were prepared for free-floating vibratome sections at 50 μm, cryostat sections at 14 μm or paraffin wax-embedded sections at 5 μm. Paraffin sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated. Sections were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis as described previously ( Zhu et al., 2001 ). The visualization of primary antibodies was performed with either a horseradish peroxidase system (Vectastain ABC kit, Vector) or immunofluorescence by using Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit/mouse and Cy2-conjugated anti-mouse/rabbit secondary antibodies at 1:200 dilution (Jackson Laboratories). The dilution of primary antibodies used in this study were: GFAP (rabbit, 1:2000, DAKO), nestin (mouse, 1:200, Chemicon), BLBP (rabbit, 1:1000, a gift from N. Heintz), PAX2 (rabbit, 1:1000, a gift from G. Dressler), P-erk (rabbit, 1:200, Cell Signaling), Cre (mouse, 1:1000, BABCO), Ki-67 (Rabbit, 1:1000, Novocastra Labs). Sections were examined under either light or fluorescence microscope (Olympus). The co-localization of two antigens was further confirmed by confocal microscopy (Zeiss).",Yuan Zhu; Takayuki Harada; Li Liu; Mark E Lush; Frantz Guignard; Chikako Harada; Dennis K Burns; M Livia Bajenaru; David H Gutmann; Luis F Parada,"Development (Cambridge, England)",2005-12,10.1242/dev.02162,minimal,True
PMID:18927496,Suppression of proliferation of two independent NF1 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor cell lines by the pan-ErbB inhibitor CI-1033.,"Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is characterized by the abnormal proliferation of neuroectodermal tissues and the development of certain tumors, particularly neurofibromas, which may progress into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). Effective pharmacological therapy for the treatment of NF1 tumors is currently unavailable and the prognosis for patients with MPNSTs is poor. Loss of neurofibromin correlates with increased expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ErbB2 tyrosine kinases and these kinases have been shown to promote NF1 tumor-associated pathologies in vivo. We show here that while NF1 MPNST cells have higher EGFR expression levels and are more sensitive to EGF when compared to a non-NF1 MPNST cell line, the ability of the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib to selectively inhibit NF1 MPNST cell proliferation is marginal. We also show that NF1 MPNST proliferation correlates with activated ErbB2 and can be suppressed by nanomolar concentrations of the pan-ErbB inhibitor CI-1033 (canertinib). Consequently, targeting both EGFR and ErbB2 may prove an effective strategy for suppressing NF1 MPNST tumor growth in vivo.","Materials and Methods Cell Culture and Treatments Human MPNST cell lines ST88-14 and NF90-8 (generous gifts from T. Glover, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, U.S.A.), and STS-26T (a generous gift from D. Scoles, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, U.S.A.) were cultured in RPMI (Cellgro, Herndon, VA, U.S.A.) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, L-glutamine, phenol red, 50 units/mL penicillin, and 50 μg/mL streptomycin in a humidified 37°C chamber, supplemented with 5% CO 2 . For EGF stimulation experiments, cells were grown to ~80% confluency, serum-starved for 1 h, and stimulated with human, recombinant EGF (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.) as indicated in the figures. Gefitinib (AstraZeneca, Alderly Park, UK) and CI-1033 (Pfizer, Groton, CT) were prepared as stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and double distilled H 2 O, respectively, and stored at −80°C. Western Blotting After the indicated treatments, cells were lysed with 2x SDS sample buffer and boiled immediately for 5 min.  Proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.5% Tween-20 (TBS-T) for 1 h to overnight. Primary antibodies were rabbit polyclonal IgG anti-EGFR at 1:1,000 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA); rabbit immunoaffinity purified IgG anti-phospho-Tyr1068 of EGFR at 1:1000 (Cell Signaling Technology); anti-MAP Kinase at 1:2,000 (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, Charlottesville, VA); monoclonal IgG 29 1  isotype anti-MAP Kinase activated, clone MAPK-YT at 1:2,000 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO); mouse monoclonal anti-ErbB2 (LabVision, Freemont, CA) at 1:1000; rabbit monoclonal and polyclonal anti-pTyr1221/1222 of ErbB2 (Cell Signaling Technology) at 1:500; mouse monoclonal anti-Cyclin D1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 1:1000; mouse monoclonal IgG 1  anti-β-tubulin “E7” at 1:2,000 (developed by Michael Klymkowsky and obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA). Secondary antibodies were HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG at 1:10,000 (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). Immunoblots were incubated with Western Blotting Detection Reagents (Amersham Bioscience, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) or DuraSignal (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, IL) and recorded on X-ray film (KODAK Biomax Light; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). When necessary, brightness and contrast levels of scanned immunoblot images were uniformly adjusted using ADOBE Photoshop software (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) was used for densitometry and quantification of immunoblot signals. Cell Proliferation Assays Approximately equal numbers of cells (20,000 – 30,000) were plated onto either 30 mm or 60 mm dishes and allowed to attach overnight. For proliferation assays using gefitinib, cells were treated with the indicated concentration of gefitinib dissolved in DMSO or an equal volume of DMSO alone, and the cells harvested at the indicated time-points. For proliferation assays using CI-1033, cells were treated with the indicated concentration of CI-1033 dissolved in ddH 2 O, or ddH 2 O alone, and the cells harvested at the indicated time-points. Media and floating cells were collected and dishes rinsed with ice-cold PBS. Attached cells were incubated with 0.5 ml trypsin for 5 min to allow complete detachment. Trypsinized cells and floating cells were combined and centrifuged at 1000×  g  for 5 min to pellet. Media and trypsin were removed by aspiration, and the cells resuspended in an equal volume of serum-free media. Numbers of live and dead cells were determined by the Trypan blue exclusion assay. Flow Cytometry MPNST cell lines were harvested and processed for FACS analyses of DNA content as described previously.   DNA analyses were made with a FACScalibur instrument (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Percentages of cells in the G 30 0 /G 1 , S, and G 2 /M stages of the cell cycle were determined with a DNA histogram-fitting program (MODFIT; Verity Software, Topsham, ME). A minimum of 10 4  events/sample was collected for subsequent analyses. Receptor Turnover Assays Cells were plated in 5% serum and grown to 80% confluency. Cells were serum-starved overnight, and then treated with either 50 μg/ml cycloheximide dissolved in ddH 2 O (Sigma-Aldrich) or ddH 2 O alone as indicated for 2 h. Cells were then treated with either 10 ng/mL of EGF in serum-free media, or serum-free media alone, and harvested at the indicated time-points. For assays involving a single time-point, EGF treatments were for 3 h. Cells were harvested in 2x SDS sample buffer and boiled immediately for 5 min. Proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted for EGFR, phosphorylated and total ErbB2, cyclin D1, and β-tubulin as described above.",Joshua T Dilworth; Jonathan W Wojtkowiak; Patricia Mathieu; Michael A Tainsky; John J Reiners; Raymond R Mattingly; Chad N Hancock,Cancer biology & therapy,2008-12,10.4161/cbt.7.12.6942,minimal,True
PMID:18671844,Modelling neurofibromatosis type 1 tibial dysplasia and its treatment with lovastatin.,"BACKGROUND: Bowing and/or pseudarthrosis of the tibia is a known severe complication of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Mice with conditionally inactivated neurofibromin (Nf1) in the developing limbs and cranium (Nf1Prx1) show bowing of the tibia caused by decreased bone mineralisation and increased bone vascularisation. However, in contrast to NF1 patients, spontaneous fractures do not occur in Nf1Prx1 mice probably due to the relatively low mechanical load. We studied bone healing in a cortical bone injury model in Nf1Prx1 mice as a model for NF1-associated bone disease. Taking advantage of this experimental model we explore effects of systemically applied lovastatin, a cholesterol-lowering drug, on the Nf1 deficient bone repair. METHODS: Cortical injury was induced bilaterally in the tuberositas tibiae in Nf1Prx1 mutant mice and littermate controls according to a method described previously. Paraffin as well as methacrylate sections were analysed from each animal. We divided 24 sex-matched mutant mice into a lovastatin-treated and an untreated group. The lovastatin-treated mice received 0.15 mg activated lovastatin by daily gavage. The bone repair process was analysed at three consecutive time points post injury, using histological methods, micro computed tomography measurements and in situ hybridisation. At each experimental time point, three lovastatin-treated mutant mice, three untreated mutant mice and three untreated control mice were analysed. The animal group humanely killed on day 14 post injury was expanded to six treated and six untreated mutant mice as well as six control mice. RESULTS: Bone injury repair is a complex process, which requires the concerted effort of numerous cell types. It is initiated by an inflammatory response, which stimulates fibroblasts from the surrounding connective tissue to proliferate and fill in the injury site with a provisional extracellular matrix. In parallel, mesenchymal progenitor cells from the periost are recruited into the injury site to become osteoblasts. In Nf1Prx1 mice bone repair is delayed and characterised by the excessive formation and the persistence of fibro-cartilaginous tissue and impaired extracellular matrix mineralisation. Correspondingly, expression of Runx2 is downregulated. High-dose systemic lovastatin treatment restores Runx2 expression and accelerates new bone formation, thus improving cortical bone repair in Nf1Prx1 tibia. The bone anabolic effects correlate with a reduction of the mitogen activated protein kinase pathway hyper-activation in Nf1-deficient cells. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest the potential usefulness of lovastatin, a drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1987 for the treatment of hypercholesteraemia, in the treatment of Nf1-related fracture healing abnormalities. The experimental model presented here constitutes a valuable tool for the pre-clinical stage testing of candidate drugs, targeting Nf1-associated bone dysplasia.","Methods Cortical injury was induced bilaterally in the  tuberositas tibiae  in Nf1Prx1 mutant mice and littermate controls according to a method described previously. Paraffin as well as methacrylate sections were analysed from each animal. We divided 24 sex-matched mutant mice into a lovastatin-treated and an untreated group. The lovastatin-treated mice received 0.15 mg activated lovastatin by daily gavage. The bone repair process was analysed at three consecutive time points post injury, using histological methods, micro computed tomography measurements and  in situ  hybridisation. At each experimental time point, three lovastatin-treated mutant mice, three untreated mutant mice and three untreated control mice were analysed. The animal group humanely killed on day 14 post injury was expanded to six treated and six untreated mutant mice as well as six control mice. Methods Animal procedures The Nf1flox and Prx1Cre lines were maintained by continuous backcrossing to wild-type C57BL/6J mice to minimise genetic drift. The female Nf1flox mice were crossed to male Nf1flox heterozygous Prx1-Cre positive males. Mice were genotyped as described previously [ 19 ]. We used 12–14-week-old mice for cortical bone injury experiments, essentially as described in [ 5 ] with minor modifications. In brief, mice were anaesthetised by intraperitoneal injection of ketanest/rompun. The skin was shaved and skin incision made over the medial aspect of the proximal end of the tibia. Soft tissue was cleared away and a hole (500 μm diameter) through the tibia was made with a 0.5 mm stainless steel drill. The drill site was placed at the level of the distal end of the tibial crest through the entire diameter of the tibia, that is, through medial and lateral cortices and the intervening medulla. The skin was closed using acrylic histo-glue. Lovastatin was converted into its active sodium salt form as described previously [ 20 ]. In brief, 50 mg mevinolin in the lactone form (Sigma) was dissolved in 1 ml prewarmed (55°C) ethanol and 500 μl of 0.6 M NaOH was added. The solution was briefly vortexed and 10 ml of water was added. The solution was incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. The final mevinolin solution (4 mg/ml) was adjusted to pH 8 with HCl and stored in multiple aliquots at -20°C. The treated group received daily oral gavage of 0.15 mg activated lovastatin in 150 μl end volume gavage. The same dose was shown to be effective in the treatment of the learning and attention deficits in the NF1 heterozygous knock-out mice [ 18 ]. All experimental procedures were approved by the Landesamt für Gesundheitsschutz und Technische Sicherheit (LaGeTSi), Berlin, Germany. Histological analysis Tibiae were dissected with the surrounding soft tissue and fixed over night in phosphate buffered 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Subsequently tissue samples destined for calcified bone histology and micro computed tomography (μCT) analysis were processed according to the Technovit 9100 Kit manual (Heraeus Kulzer GmbH, Germany). Serial sections of 5 μm were cut with a hard tissue microtome and stained according to the VonKossa/Toluidine procedure. For paraffin embedding, tibiae were decalcified for 14 days while rotating at 4°C in phosphate buffered 4% PFA/0.5% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) with one change of solution at day 7. Serial, 6 μm thick paraffin sections were prepared and used for Masson-Goldner staining,  in situ  hybridisation and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. TRAP histochemistry and TRAP-positive regions quantification was performed on the paraffin sections as described previously [ 4 ]. In situ  hybridisation In situ  hybridisations with Collagen1 and Osteopontin probes were performed using digoxigenin labelled cRNA probes as described previously [ 21 ]. The probes were amplified from the mouse embryonic day E17.5 cDNA library using the following primers: Collagen1F: 5'-GGTACATCAGCCCGAACCCCAAGG-3' Collagen1R: 5'-GTCTGGGGCACCAATGTCCAAGGG-3' OsteopontinF: 5'-GATGAATCTGACGAATCTCAC-3' OsteopontinR: 5'-CTGCTTAACCCTCACTAACAC-3' The Runx2 expression was detected using  32 P labelled cRNA probes as described previously [ 22 ]. The Runx2 probe was derived from mouse embryonic stage 14.5 cDNA library with the following primers: Runx2F: 5'-GTGTTCTGTGGTCTCTGAG-3' Runx2R: 5'-GGCAAAAGCTTGCAGAACTC-3' Radioactive probe signals were photographed in dark field and the tissue histology was visualised using inverse phase optics. Three-dimensional imaging by μCT Methacrylate embedded tibiae were scanned in plastic blocks using a vivaCT40 scanner from ScancoMedical. The following instrument settings were chosen for the measurements: voxel size 0.1 mm × 0.1 mm × 0.5 m; scan speed of 2 mm/second; contour mode 1; cortical threshold 350 mg/cm 3 . The cortical injury was located and a volume of interest (VOI) was defined comprising the complete injury site. To analyse bone formation within the bone marrow cavity, another VOI, comprising 90 consecutive scan slices, was selected reaching from the proximal to the distal callus end. All VOIs were analysed under identical settings with the Scanco evaluation software. Results of the μCT morphometric analysis were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation and statistical significance was examined using an unpaired  t -test (* P  < 0.05; ** P  < 0.01). Western blot Calvarial bones (parietal and frontal bone) were harvested 7 days post injury. Bones were dissected free of connective tissue and muscles and homogenised in 300 μl radio immuno precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors using tissue homogeniser (Fisher Scentific). Homogenates were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 13000 rpm and the supernatants were collected. Whole-cell lysates of calvarial bones were resolved by electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF) membranes (Amersham). For Western blot analysis, membranes were probed with the following antibodies: phospho-p42/44 (pERK1/2) #9102 Cell Signaling (diluted 1:1000), p44 (ERK1) #4372 Cell Signaling (diluted 1:1000).

PMID:18984156,Nf1-dependent tumors require a microenvironment containing Nf1+/-- and c-kit-dependent bone marrow.,"Interactions between tumorigenic cells and their surrounding microenvironment are critical for tumor progression yet remain incompletely understood. Germline mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene cause neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a common genetic disorder characterized by complex tumors called neurofibromas. Genetic studies indicate that biallelic loss of Nf1 is required in the tumorigenic cell of origin in the embryonic Schwann cell lineage. However, in the physiologic state, Schwann cell loss of heterozygosity is not sufficient for neurofibroma formation and Nf1 haploinsufficiency in at least one additional nonneoplastic lineage is required for tumor progression. Here, we establish that Nf1 heterozygosity of bone marrow-derived cells in the tumor microenvironment is sufficient to allow neurofibroma progression in the context of Schwann cell Nf1 deficiency. Further, genetic or pharmacologic attenuation of c-kit signaling in Nf1+/- hematopoietic cells diminishes neurofibroma initiation and progression. Finally, these studies implicate mast cells as critical mediators of tumor initiation.","EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Animals and Reagents The  Krox20;Nf1  mice and  flox/flox Krox20;Nf1  mice have been previously described ( flox/− Zhu et al., 2002 ). The C57BL/6-TgN(ACTbEGFP)1Osb mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME. Chemicals were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) unless otherwise stated. Bone Marrow Transplantation of Hematopoietic Cells Two million syngeneic WT or  Nf1 +/−  bone marrow cells from WT GFP or  Nf1 +/−  GFP mice per recipient were transplanted into young adult  Krox20;Nf1  mice or  flox/flox Krox20;Nf1  mice following 1100 rads of ionizing radiation. flox/− PET Imaging Analysis Fluorodeoxyglucose ([ 18 F] FDG) PET and X-ray CT imaging was employed to identify neurofibromas. CT images were used to place a standardized volume of interest (VOI) template over regions lateral to the spinal cord for quantification of FDG uptake. Registered and overlaid CT image data was used to identify specific vertebrae landmarks from Lumbar (L1) to the Sacrum (S1). The user then picked points along the spinal cord to determine the path of the spinal cord between L1 and S1. Three circular regions-of-interest (ROI) are then placed at interpolated points along the spinal cord to capture the spinal cord and the dorsal root ganglion regions. The circular ROI's then were combined to create VOI's for the spinal cord, left dorsal root ganglion, and right dorsal root ganglion. FDG images were acquired at 45 min postinjection of 0.5–1.0 mCi of FDG via tail vein injection. All animals were administered FDG while awake and given isoflurane anesthesia at 40 min postinjection to immobilize the animal for imaging. Dissection of Dorsal Root Ganglia Immediately following postmortem, mice were perfused and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The dorsal root ganglia and peripheral nerves were then dissected out under a dissection microscope. Measurement of Tumor Size The volume of tumors was determined by the established approximate volume for a spheroid 0.52 × (width) 2  × length. Phenotypic Evaluation of the Donor Cells in Dorsal Root Ganglia Ganglia were minced, digested by collagenase V, and the single cell suspension was admixed with anti CD117, CD31, or Col1A and FcεRI antibodies. Populations were separated using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (Becton Dickson, San Jose, CA). Genotypic Analysis of Donor Bone Marrow DNA was isolated as described ( Clapp et al., 1995 ), digested with PstI to elucidate the  Nf1  knockout and  Nf1  fragments and separated by gel electrophoresis. Following transfer to a nitrocellulose filter, fragments were hybridized with an Eag I/ Sph I,  flox/flox 32 P dATP labeled  neo  fragment, washed, and exposed to film as described ( Clapp et al., 1995 ). Histological Analysis To examine the morphology of the tumors in detail, paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), masson trichrome alcian blue as described ( Zhu et al., 2002 ). In Vivo Evaluation of Proliferation and Survival in Tumors Cell proliferation in tumors was evaluated by utilizing a BrdU in situ detection kit (BD PharMingen, San Jose, CA).  Krox20;Nf1  mice previously treated for 12 weeks with imatinib or vehicle, received 50 mg BrdU per Kg of body weight), 48, 24, 6, 4, and 2 hr via peritoneal injection before intracardiac perfusion. DRGs were processed for paraffin-embedding immunohistochemical staining and BrdU positive cells were counted under a phase contrast microscope. Apoptosis of tissues was evaluated using TUNEL staining as described ( flox/− Hiatt et al., 2004 ). Transmission Electron Microscopy Following perfusion fixation, tissues were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and acetone and embedded in Epon-Araldite (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA). Ultrathin sections (silver to gold) were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with a FEI Tecnai G2 electron microscope (Philips, Eindhoven, Netherlands). Statistical Methods Analysis of survival outcomes was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Comparison of the mean size of tumors, differences in cellularity and apoptosis in the experimental groups was performed using Student's t test or analysis of variance.

PMID:34487172,Machine learning approach to differentiation of peripheral schwannomas and neurofibromas: A multi-center study.,"BACKGROUND: Non-invasive differentiation between schwannomas and neurofibromas is important for appropriate management, preoperative counseling, and surgical planning, but has proven difficult using conventional imaging. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate machine learning approaches for differentiating peripheral schwannomas from neurofibromas. METHODS: We assembled a cohort of schwannomas and neurofibromas from 3 independent institutions and extracted high-dimensional radiomic features from gadolinium-enhanced, T1-weighted MRI using the PyRadiomics package on Quantitative Imaging Feature Pipeline. Age, sex, neurogenetic syndrome, spontaneous pain, and motor deficit were recorded. We evaluated the performance of 6 radiomics-based classifier models with and without clinical features and compared model performance against human expert evaluators. RESULTS: One hundred and seven schwannomas and 59 neurofibromas were included. The primary models included both clinical and imaging data. The accuracy of the human evaluators (0.765) did not significantly exceed the no-information rate (NIR), whereas the Support Vector Machine (0.929), Logistic Regression (0.929), and Random Forest (0.905) classifiers exceeded the NIR. Using the method of DeLong, the AUCs for the Logistic Regression (AUC = 0.923) and K Nearest Neighbor (AUC = 0.923) classifiers were significantly greater than the human evaluators (AUC = 0.766; p = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS: The radiomics-based classifiers developed here proved to be more accurate and had a higher AUC on the ROC curve than expert human evaluators. This demonstrates that radiomics using routine MRI sequences and clinical features can aid in differentiation of peripheral schwannomas and neurofibromas.",,Michael Zhang; Elizabeth Tong; Sam Wong; Forrest Hamrick; Maryam Mohammadzadeh; Vaishnavi Rao; Courtney Pendleton; Brandon W Smith; Nicholas F Hug; Sandip Biswal; Jayne Seekins; Sandy Napel; Robert J Spinner; Mark A Mahan; Kristen W Yeom; Thomas J Wilson,Neuro-oncology,2022-04-01,10.1093/neuonc/noab211,abstract_only,False
