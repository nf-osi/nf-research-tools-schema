  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Extensive Methods section contains numerous research tools that were missed
    - Cell lines with non-standard naming conventions (Greek letters, hyphens, dots) not captured
    - Complex mouse strain nomenclature not recognized
    - Bioinformatics tools and antibodies with catalog numbers missed
    - CRISPR plasmids and genetic reagents not identified
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains extensive research tools that were completely missed by initial mining:
    - 6 cell lines with various naming conventions should be added
    - 2 mouse strains for xenograft models should be captured
    - 2 genetic reagents (CRISPR plasmids) should be included
    - 6 computational tools for genomics analysis should be added
    - 5 antibodies with catalog numbers should be captured
    - New patterns are needed for cell lines with Greek letters, hyphens, and complex identifiers
    - Mouse strain patterns need expansion for immunodeficient strains
    - Antibody patterns should capture catalog numbers and vendors
    - Single-cell analysis tools need better coverage
    All 20 potentially missed tools should be manually reviewed for addition to the database.
