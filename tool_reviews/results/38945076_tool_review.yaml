    Lab Research publication - Expected tool types include:
    - Cell lines (human and mouse Schwann cells, schwannoma cells)
    - Antibodies (for Western blot, immunohistochemistry, dot blot)
    - Genetic reagents (plasmids, vectors, recombinant proteins)
    - Computational tools (analysis software, statistical software)
    - Animal models (Nf2 knockout mice mentioned)
    - Advanced cellular models (3D cell culture clusters)
    
    This publication uses extensive experimental methods including cell culture, protein purification,
    metabolic assays, immunoblotting, and microscopy - all requiring multiple research tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive lab research study investigating nitrated Hsp90 as a therapeutic target
    for NF2-related schwannomatosis. The extensive Methods section describes multiple experimental
    approaches requiring numerous research tools. The complete absence of mined tools (0 tools found)
    represents a significant mining failure, as this publication clearly contains many antibodies,
    cell lines, genetic reagents, and computational tools that should have been captured.

      Doubling the endogenous levels of nitrated Hsp90 induced a statistically significant increase 
      in cell growth 24 h post-delivery. Intracellular delivery of nitrated Hsp90 significantly 
      increased cell numbers at 12 and 24 h post-delivery versus delivery of Hsp90, expressed as 
      percentage of the cell numbers present 4 h post-delivery, after cell attachment to the plate.
      Cell growth curves adjusted to exponential plateau growth for nitrated Hsp90 versus classic 
      exponential growth for unmodified Hsp90.

      Nitration at Y33 was critical to Hsp90 mitochondrial gain-of-function, significantly decreasing 
      both mitochondrial basal and ATP-linked respiration and increasing proton leak. Nitrated Hsp90 
      and Hsp90 NY56 increased glycolysis, suggesting nitrated Hsp90 acts as a metabolic switch.

      Intracellular delivery of nitrated Hsp90 (NO2Hsp90, Hsp90NY33, or Hsp90NY56) significantly 
      increased Schwann cell proliferation compared to delivery of unmodified Hsp90 both 24 h and 48 h

      similar to the ~15-20% increase observed in schwannoma cell proliferation 24 h after delivery.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Complete mining failure: 0 tools captured from a publication with extensive experimental methods
    - Publication contains numerous research tools with clear catalog numbers, vendors, and usage context
    - Missing cell lines, antibodies, genetic reagents, computational tools, and animal models
    - All tools have clear experimental usage context and should have been captured
    - Mining algorithms failed to recognize standard research tool patterns
  recommendations: |
    This represents a complete mining failure for a publication rich in research tools. All 19 identified
    tools should be added to the database as they represent genuine research tools with clear experimental
    usage. The suggested patterns should be implemented to improve future mining accuracy, particularly:
    1. Catalog number patterns (Cat. No./Cat. no.)
    2. Vendor name recognition in parentheses
    3. Antibody dilution patterns
    4. Instrument naming conventions
    5. 3D cell culture terminology
    6. Genetic modification nomenclature (flox/lox)
    
    The 5 scientific observations extracted demonstrate significant cellular and metabolic phenotypes
    associated with the validated tools, providing valuable functional information for researchers.
    
    Priority should be given to implementing the catalog number and vendor recognition patterns,
    as these are highly reliable indicators of commercial research tools.
