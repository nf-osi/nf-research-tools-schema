    This is a consensus/methodology paper about clinical trial design for neurofibromatosis research.
    While it discusses categories of outcome measures (functional, visual, patient-reported, neurocognitive),
    it does not specify particular validated clinical assessment tools or instruments.
    
    Expected tool types for this publication type:
    - Clinical assessment tools (if specific validated instruments were mentioned)
    - Computational tools (if analysis software was used)
    
    However, this appears to be a high-level consensus document that discusses measurement
    categories rather than implementing specific tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a consensus methodology paper establishing recommendations for clinical trial design
    in neurofibromatosis research. While it mentions broad categories of outcome measures
    (imaging, functional outcomes, patient-reported outcomes), it does not specify particular
    validated instruments or tools. The publication focuses on establishing frameworks rather
    than implementing specific research tools, making it unlikely to contain extractable tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a consensus/methodology paper, not an empirical research study
    - No Methods section available indicating no experimental procedures
    - Only abstract text available, no full-text sections for detailed analysis
    - Mentions broad categories of outcome measures but no specific validated instruments
    - Focus is on establishing frameworks for clinical trial design rather than tool usage
  recommendations: |
    This publication correctly yielded zero mined tools. It is a consensus methodology paper
    that discusses categories of clinical trial endpoints rather than implementing specific
    research tools. The mentions of "whole-body MRI", "patient-reported outcomes", and
    "neurocognitive outcomes" are high-level categories rather than specific validated
    instruments that would qualify as clinical assessment tools.
    
    No tools should be added from this publication. The mining algorithm correctly identified
    that this type of consensus/review paper does not contain specific research tools.
    
    This publication represents an appropriate negative control - a clinical query result
    that discusses clinical trial methodology without containing extractable tools.
