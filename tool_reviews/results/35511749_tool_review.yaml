    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a comprehensive lab research study involving high-throughput screening, cell culture, 
    patient-derived xenograft models, and molecular analysis. Expected tools include MPNST cell lines,
    PDX models, antibodies for Western blot, computational tools for analysis, and potentially 
    genetic reagents for drug screening.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study involving high-throughput drug screening,
    cell culture experiments, and patient-derived xenograft models. The study clearly uses multiple
    research tools including cell lines, PDX models, antibodies, and computational analysis tools.
    The presence of detailed Methods section confirms active experimental work rather than review.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple cell lines, PDX models, antibodies, and computational tools are clearly present
    - Mining patterns appear to miss standard cell line nomenclature and antibody catalog numbers
    - PDOX models and specialized analysis software not captured
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The study uses multiple MPNST cell lines, patient-derived xenograft models, antibodies for
    Western blot analysis, and specialized computational tools. All 17 potentially missed tools
    should be added as they represent genuine research tools used in the experimental work.
    The suggested patterns would significantly improve mining accuracy for similar publications.
    Manual curator review is recommended to validate the extensive tool usage in this study.
