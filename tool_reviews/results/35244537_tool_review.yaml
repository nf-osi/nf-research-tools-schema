    This is a laboratory research study with extensive molecular biology methods that would typically use multiple research tools.
    The detailed Methods section describes complex protocols for DNA sequencing, library preparation, and computational analysis.
    The absence of mined tools suggests significant gaps in the mining patterns, as this type of publication should contain
    numerous computational tools, genetic reagents, and commercial kits that are essential research tools.

      Custom software demonstrated effective performance for somatic mutation identification in matched tumor-normal samples from whole exome sequencing.
      Applied specific filtering criteria: (i) distinct paired reads contained the mutation in tumor; (ii) at least 10% of total distinct read pairs; 
      (iii) mismatched base not present in >1% of matched normal reads; (iv) position covered in both tumor and normal.
      Successfully identified somatic mutations in NF1, NF2, RB1, TP53BP2, and GOLGA2 genes from plasma cfDNA samples.

      Assay demonstrated ability to amplify approximately 750,000 loci across 39 chromosome arms for aneuploidy detection.
      Achieved 97% specificity in healthy controls (n=883) with median GAS score of 0.008 ± 0.102.
      Sensitivity for detecting MPNST was 33% (4/12 patients, p < 0.001 compared to healthy controls).
      Successfully detected focal copy number alterations including losses in TERT (17% of MPNST), TP53 (8%), and SUZ12 (50%).
      Low sequencing coverage requirement (~10M reads per sample) enables cost-effective high-throughput analysis.

      System successfully quantified mutant allele frequencies (MAF) in circulating tumor DNA from plasma samples.
      Detected mutations at low frequencies: GOLGA2 splice site mutation at 0.19% MAF, RB1 R787Qfs*23 at 2.55% MAF, 
      and TP53BP2 A324V at 0.04% MAF. Performed in triplicate for accurate quantification of wild-type and mutant 
      genomic equivalents. Demonstrated sensitivity for detecting rare mutant alleles in liquid biopsy applications.
    foundIn: "results"
    contextSnippet: "ddPCR was then performed in triplicate on DNA derived from the plasma and ctDNA levels were quantified. These data were used to calculate the overall MAF for each somatic mutation, defined as the number of mutant counts divided by the total number of counts for a given amplicon."

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Complete failure of mining system to detect any tools despite extensive methodology
    - Publication contains numerous commercial kits, instruments, and software tools that should have been captured
    - Missing patterns for: vendor information, catalog numbers, software versions, sequencing platforms
    - No recognition of bioinformatics tools (VariantDx, CASAVA, ELAND, snpEff) despite clear usage context
    - Commercial kits with catalog numbers completely missed (BioChain K5011610, QIAGEN 55114)
    - Sequencing instruments and PCR systems not detected
  recommendations: |
    - All 12 potentially missed tools should be added to the database - they represent genuine research tools with clear experimental usage
    - Implement suggested patterns immediately, particularly vendor location patterns and catalog number detection
    - Add bioinformatics software patterns to capture sequence analysis tools
    - Include sequencing platform naming conventions (HiSeq, MiSeq patterns)
    - This publication demonstrates major gaps in current mining coverage for molecular biology tools
    - The 6 suggested patterns would significantly improve tool detection in similar publications
    - Three high-quality usage observations were extracted showing practical performance data for computational tools and instruments
