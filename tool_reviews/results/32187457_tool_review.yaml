    Based on this being a Phase 2 clinical trial in pediatric patients with neurofibromatosis type 1:
    - Clinical assessment tools → Expected (quality of life measures, pain scales, functional assessments)
    - Computational tools → Possible (statistical analysis software, imaging analysis tools)
    - Lab research tools → Unlikely (this is a clinical trial, not bench research)
    
    Clinical trials typically use validated questionnaires and assessment instruments to measure
    patient outcomes, symptom severity, quality of life, and functional status. Pediatric trials
    often use age-appropriate assessment tools like PedsQL, pain scales, and functional measures.
    
    Note: Publications can contain multiple tool types. Even clinical trials may use computational
    tools for statistical analysis or imaging processing.
  overallAssessment: |
    This Phase 2 clinical trial of selumetinib in children with inoperable plexiform neurofibromas
    would be expected to use clinical assessment tools for measuring patient outcomes, quality of life,
    pain, and functional status. Clinical trials require validated instruments to assess efficacy
    and safety endpoints. The absence of identified tools suggests potential mining gaps for clinical
    assessment instruments, which are legitimate research tools in clinical research contexts.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    Major issues identified during review:
    - No research tools were initially identified in this Phase 2 clinical trial
    - Clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, scales) are likely missing from mining results
    - Computational tools for statistical analysis and imaging may be under-captured
    - Current mining patterns may be biased toward laboratory research tools
    - Clinical trials represent a different tool ecosystem than bench research
  recommendations: |
    Recommendations for this publication and future mining:
    - Expand mining patterns to capture clinical assessment tools (PedsQL, VAS, PROMIS, etc.)
    - Include patterns for patient-reported outcome measures and validated questionnaires
    - Add computational tool patterns for medical imaging analysis software
    - Consider clinical trial-specific vocabulary and methodology sections
    - Manual review recommended to identify specific assessment instruments used
    - This publication type should contain clinical assessment tools - their absence suggests mining gaps
    - Future mining should distinguish between lab research and clinical research tool vocabularies
