    Clinical Trial → clinical assessment tools (pain scales, quality of life measures, functional assessments)
    This Phase 2 clinical trial would be expected to use validated clinical outcome measures to assess:
    - Pain intensity (numerical rating scales)
    - Quality of life instruments (likely pediatric-specific)
    - Functional assessments (strength, range of motion)
    - Patient-reported outcome measures
    
    May also use computational tools for statistical analysis, though these are not typically detailed in abstracts.
    Lab research tools (antibodies, cell lines, etc.) would not be expected in this type of clinical intervention study.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating selumetinib efficacy in pediatric NF1 patients with plexiform neurofibromas.
    Clinical trials routinely use validated assessment tools to measure outcomes, and this study explicitly mentions pain scales,
    quality of life measures, and functional assessments. The mining appears to have missed several clinical assessment tools
    that are clearly described in the abstract, suggesting the mining patterns may not adequately capture clinical outcome measures.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were mined from this Phase 2 clinical trial despite clear use of clinical assessment tools
    - Mining patterns appear inadequate for capturing clinical outcome measures and assessment instruments
    - Only abstract text available, but clinical trials typically describe assessment tools in abstracts
    - Multiple pain scales, quality of life measures, and functional assessments are described but not captured
  recommendations: |
    This publication represents a significant gap in clinical assessment tool mining. The study clearly uses:
    1. Pain intensity numerical rating scale (0-10) - should definitely be added
    2. Quality of life measures (though specific instrument not named)
    3. Pain interference assessments
    4. Functional outcome measures (strength, range of motion)
    
    The mining patterns need enhancement to capture clinical assessment terminology and outcome measure descriptions.
    This is a high-quality clinical trial that would provide valuable data about clinical assessment tools used in NF1 research.
    
    Recommend adding the pain intensity scale as a definite tool, and developing better patterns to capture clinical
    outcome measures even when specific instrument names are not provided in abstracts.
