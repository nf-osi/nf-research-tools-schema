    Review Article → Typically no research tools used directly. May cite tools from other studies but does not use them experimentally.
    
    This publication appears to be a conceptual review/commentary discussing neuroblastoma from a neurodevelopmental perspective.
    Review articles rarely contain actual research tools - they synthesize existing knowledge rather than report new experimental work.
    
    Expected tool types: None (review articles may reference tools from cited studies but don't use them)
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a review/commentary article discussing neuroblastoma as a neurodevelopmental disorder. Review articles typically do not use research tools directly but rather synthesize existing knowledge from the literature.
    The absence of Methods, Results, and Discussion sections confirms this is not an experimental study. No research tools are expected in this type of publication.
    The abstract focuses on conceptual discussion of neuroblastoma characteristics and neurodevelopmental origins rather than experimental methodology.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a review/commentary article, not experimental research
    - No Methods section indicating this is not a lab or clinical study
    - Only abstract text available, no full text sections for comprehensive analysis
    - No experimental content that would utilize research tools
  recommendations: |
    This publication should not be expected to contain research tools as it is a review/commentary article.
    The mining correctly identified zero tools, which is appropriate for this publication type.
    No further action needed - this is a correct negative result.
    Review articles like this may reference tools from cited studies but do not use tools experimentally themselves.
    The absence of tools is expected and correct for this publication type.
