  queryType: "unknown"  # Query type not specified in available data

  publicationTypeConfidence: 0.3  # Low confidence due to limited content
  hasMethodsSection: No
  likelyContainsTools: No
  expectedToolTypes: |
    Cannot determine expected tool types from abstract-only content. Neuroblastoma research
    typically involves:
    - Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools
    - Clinical Studies → clinical assessment tools, patient outcome measures
    - Bioinformatics → computational tools for genomic analysis
    
    However, without access to methods, results, or discussion sections, it's impossible
    to determine the actual study type and whether research tools would be expected.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication had only abstract text available for mining, with no access to methods,
    results, or discussion sections. Without these critical sections, it's expected that no
    research tools would be identified, as abstracts typically don't contain detailed
    methodological information about specific tools, reagents, or instruments used.
    The absence of mined tools is likely due to limited content availability rather than
    the publication not containing tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication content limited to abstract only - no methods, results, or discussion sections available
    - Cannot assess whether tools should have been found due to insufficient content
    - Mining process appropriately found no tools given the limited text available
    - Full publication text would be needed to perform meaningful tool validation
  recommendations: |
    This publication cannot be meaningfully evaluated for research tool mining due to limited
    content availability (abstract only). The absence of mined tools is expected and appropriate
    given the circumstances. Recommendations:
    
    1. If full text becomes available, re-run the mining process on complete content
    2. Abstract-only publications should be flagged for limited content during mining
    3. Consider excluding abstract-only publications from tool mining workflows unless
       they contain explicit tool mentions in the abstract itself
    4. This publication should not be used to evaluate mining algorithm performance
       since the lack of tools found is due to content limitations, not algorithm issues
    
    No action needed for this specific publication - the mining results are appropriate
    given the available content.
