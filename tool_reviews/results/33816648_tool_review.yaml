  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study involving:
    - Cell lines: miPSC and mESC lines with genetic modifications
    - Animal models: Multiple mouse strains and disease models
    - Genetic reagents: Lentiviral vectors, plasmids, transgenic constructs
    - Antibodies: Extensive immunostaining panel for cell characterization
    - Computational tools: RNA-seq analysis software and bioinformatics tools
    - Advanced cellular models: 3D retinal organoids derived from stem cells
    
    The study involves stem cell differentiation, organoid culture, cell transplantation,
    immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, RNA sequencing, and bioinformatics analysis.
    This type of study typically contains 6-8 different tool categories.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication represents a sophisticated laboratory research study that should contain
    numerous research tools across multiple categories. The extensive Methods section describes
    detailed experimental procedures that would require many specific reagents, cell lines,
    antibodies, and computational tools. The complete absence of mined tools suggests a
    significant failure in the mining process rather than a genuine lack of tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Complete mining failure - zero tools detected in a tool-rich publication
    - This is a comprehensive laboratory research study with extensive Methods section
    - Publication contains multiple tool categories: cell lines, animal models, antibodies, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids
    - At least 15+ obvious research tools were completely missed by mining process
    - Mining patterns appear inadequate for detecting standard research tools
    - Vendor information and catalog numbers present but not captured
    - Standard nomenclature (mouse strains, plasmids, antibodies) not recognized
  recommendations: |
    - URGENT: Complete review and overhaul of mining patterns required
    - This publication demonstrates systematic mining failures across all tool categories
    - Implement suggested patterns to capture vendor/catalog information
    - Add recognition for standard nomenclature (transgenic mice, plasmids, antibodies)
    - Include equipment/instrument detection patterns
    - Test mining system on this publication as a benchmark case
    - Consider this a high-priority example for mining system improvement
    - All 15 identified tools should be added to improve future mining accuracy
    - No observations could be extracted due to absence of validated tools
