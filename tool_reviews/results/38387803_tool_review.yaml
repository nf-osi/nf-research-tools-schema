  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on publication type (Lab Research developing 3D tumor slice model):
    - Advanced cellular models (3D tumor slice model being developed)
    - Antibodies (CC3 for apoptosis, Ki67 for proliferation markers mentioned)
    - Computational tools (likely for image analysis and data processing)
    - Potentially patient-derived models (using patient tumor tissue)
    
    This is clearly a laboratory research study developing a new experimental model system
    for drug testing, which would typically involve multiple research tool categories.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research publication describing the development of a 3D tumor slice model
    for vestibular schwannomas. The study involves experimental procedures including tissue culture,
    drug testing, and molecular marker analysis. Such publications typically contain multiple research
    tools including cellular models, antibodies, and computational analysis tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    Major issues found during review:
    - No tools were mined from this publication despite clear evidence of multiple research tools
    - The publication describes development of a 3D tumor slice model (advanced cellular model)
    - Multiple antibody markers are mentioned (CC3, Ki67, Bevacizumab)
    - Pharmaceutical compounds used as research reagents (Lapatinib, Nilotinib)
    - This represents a significant mining failure - 6-7 legitimate tools were missed
  recommendations: |
    Overall recommendations for this publication:
    - This is a clear case of mining failure - multiple legitimate research tools were missed
    - The 3D tumor slice model is the primary tool being developed and should definitely be captured
    - Standard research antibodies (CC3, Ki67) and therapeutic antibody (Bevacizumab) should be detected
    - Pharmaceutical compounds used as research reagents need better pattern coverage
    - The suggested patterns should be implemented to improve future mining of similar publications
    - This publication should be re-processed with improved patterns to capture the missed tools
    - No observations could be extracted since no tools were validated, but the abstract suggests
      multiple experimental findings that would be valuable if tools were properly captured
