    Clinical Study → clinical assessment tools (Hannover and Koos classification systems), computational tools for image analysis
    This study compares measurement techniques for tumor monitoring, which involves both clinical assessment tools (classification systems) and computational tools (imaging software). The iPlan Net software for 3D segmentation is a clear computational tool, while the Hannover and Koos classification systems are clinical assessment tools used for tumor staging.
  overallAssessment: |
    This clinical study focuses on comparing measurement techniques for NF2-associated vestibular schwannomas using MRI imaging. The study would be expected to use computational tools for image analysis and segmentation, as well as clinical assessment tools for tumor classification. The presence of a detailed Methods section describing imaging protocols and measurement techniques strongly suggests tool usage for both image processing and clinical assessment.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite clear tool usage in the Methods section
    - Multiple computational and clinical assessment tools are explicitly described but were missed
    - The study uses specialized medical imaging software (iPlan Net) with vendor information
    - Validated clinical classification systems (Hannover, Koos) are used for tumor assessment
    - RECIST guidelines represent standardized clinical measurement protocols
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains several legitimate research tools that were completely missed by the initial mining:
    - iPlan Net software should definitely be added as a computational tool for medical image analysis
    - Hannover and Koos classification systems should be added as clinical assessment tools
    - RECIST guidelines should be added as clinical assessment tools
    - The mining patterns need improvement to capture medical imaging software and clinical classification systems
    - SPSS was mentioned but should not be added as it's generic statistical software
    - No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated, but the Results section likely contains comparative data about measurement techniques
