  hasMethodsSection: Yes
  likelyContainsTools: Yes
  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a clinical study comparing imaging measurement techniques for NF2-associated vestibular schwannomas.
    Expected tool types:
    - Computational tools: iPlan Net software (Brainlab) for 3D segmentation, SPSS for statistical analysis
    - Clinical assessment tools: Hannover and Koos classification systems for tumor grading
    
    The study focuses on imaging analysis methods rather than laboratory research, so lab tools
    (antibodies, cell lines, animal models) are not expected. However, the software tools used
    for image analysis and statistical analysis are legitimate computational research tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    This clinical study compares different methods for measuring vestibular schwannoma volumes in NF2 patients.
    The study uses specialized medical imaging software (iPlan Net) and statistical software (SPSS), which are
    legitimate computational research tools. Clinical classification systems (Hannover, Koos) are also research
    tools used for standardized tumor assessment. Despite being found by a "bench" query, this is primarily
    a clinical methodology study that would contain computational and clinical assessment tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Mining completely missed all research tools in this publication
    - No tools were initially identified despite clear usage of computational and clinical assessment tools
    - The publication contains legitimate research tools that should have been captured
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains several legitimate research tools that were completely missed by the initial mining:
    
    1. iPlan Net software (Brainlab) - Medical imaging software used for 3D tumor segmentation
    2. SPSS 10.0 - Statistical analysis software with specific version
    3. Hannover classification system - Clinical tumor grading tool
    4. Koos classification system - Clinical tumor grading tool  
    5. RECIST guidelines - Standardized tumor measurement methodology
    
    All five missed tools should be added to the database. The mining patterns need significant improvement
    to catch software tools with vendor information, statistical software usage, and clinical classification
    systems. This represents a major gap in the current mining approach for clinical methodology studies.
    
    No observations were extracted since the Results and Discussion sections were not available in the input data.
    Future analysis should include these sections to capture experimental findings and tool performance data.
