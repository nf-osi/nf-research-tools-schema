  title: "Enhancing Neurofibromatosis Clinical Trial Outcome Measures Through Patient Engagement: Lessons From REiNS."
  queryType: "clinical"  # From PubMed query (hint only)
  publicationType: "Questionnaire/Survey Development"
  publicationTypeConfidence: 0.95  # Very confident - this is clearly a survey study
  hasMethodsSection: Yes
  likelyContainsTools: Yes
  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on publication type (Questionnaire/Survey Development):
    - Clinical assessment tools: Survey instruments, questionnaires, rating scales
    - Computational tools: Statistical analysis software, qualitative analysis tools
    - NOT expected: Lab tools (antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, organoids, PDX)
    
    This study administered surveys to REiNS members about patient engagement, so survey instruments
    and analysis methods are the primary tools expected. The study mentions specific methodological
    approaches (free listing technique, content analysis) that could be considered research tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a survey/questionnaire study evaluating patient engagement in the REiNS collaboration.
    The study would typically use survey instruments and qualitative/quantitative analysis methods.
    Clinical assessment tools (surveys, questionnaires) and computational analysis tools are expected,
    but traditional lab research tools would not be used in this type of study design.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    Issues identified during review:
    - No tools were initially mined from this publication
    - Publication is a survey study about patient engagement, not traditional lab research
    - Several potential clinical assessment tools and analysis methods were missed
    - Limited full-text sections available (no complete Results/Discussion) limits observation extraction
    - Mining patterns may be inadequate for capturing survey methodology and qualitative analysis tools
  recommendations: |
    Recommendations for this publication:
    - Consider adding the "modified free listing technique" and "saliency score" as clinical assessment tools
    - These represent specific research methodologies used in the study
    - The generic "anonymous online survey" is borderline - may be too general to be useful
    - "Conventional content analysis" could be added as a computational tool but is quite generic
    - Mining patterns should be enhanced to better capture qualitative research methods and survey instruments
    - This publication type (survey/questionnaire studies) represents an important category that may be under-represented in current mining
    - No observations could be extracted due to limited full-text availability and lack of validated tools
    - Future mining should include patterns for qualitative research methodologies commonly used in clinical and health services research
