  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a clinical genetic association study investigating cognitive phenotypes in NF1 patients.
    Expected tool types:
    - Clinical assessment tools: Standardized neuropsychological tests, cognitive assessments, socioeconomic measures
    - Computational tools: Statistical analysis software for data processing
    - Genetic reagents: Genotyping assays and PCR reagents for COMT polymorphism analysis
    
    The study combines clinical assessment with molecular genotyping, so tools from multiple categories are expected.
    Clinical assessment tools are the primary focus, but computational and genetic tools support the methodology.
  overallAssessment: |
    This clinical study would typically use multiple research tools including standardized clinical assessment instruments
    for cognitive evaluation, computational tools for statistical analysis, and genetic reagents for genotyping.
    The study has a comprehensive Methods section describing detailed protocols for neuropsychological testing,
    genotyping procedures, and statistical analysis, indicating active tool usage rather than just citations.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Complete failure to mine any tools from this publication despite containing multiple valid research tools
    - Clinical assessment tools (Wechsler scales, cognitive tests) completely missed
    - Computational tools (SPSS, PCR software) not captured
    - Genetic reagents (TaqMan, Applied Biosystems assays) not detected
    - Mining patterns appear inadequate for clinical research publications
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous valid research tools that were completely missed by the mining process.
    The study uses standardized clinical assessment instruments, statistical software, and genetic reagents
    that should have been captured. Key recommendations:
    
    1. ADD ALL 10 MISSED TOOLS - These are legitimate research tools with clear experimental usage
    2. IMPLEMENT SUGGESTED PATTERNS - The 8 new patterns would significantly improve clinical tool detection
    3. EXPAND CLINICAL TOOL COVERAGE - Current mining appears biased toward lab tools, missing clinical assessments
    4. IMPROVE SOFTWARE DETECTION - Statistical and analysis software with versions should be captured
    5. ENHANCE REAGENT PATTERNS - Commercial genetic reagents and assays need better coverage
    
    The observations extracted demonstrate that these tools produced meaningful scientific findings about
    COMT genotype effects on working memory in NF1 patients. This represents a significant gap in the
    current mining approach for clinical research publications.
