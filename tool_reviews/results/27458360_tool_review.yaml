    Clinical Study → clinical assessment tools (cognitive tests, questionnaires, scales), possibly computational tools for statistical analysis
    
    This study examines cognitive performance in NF1 patients using standardized neuropsychological assessments and genetic testing methods. Expected tools include validated cognitive assessment instruments, intelligence scales, and laboratory protocols for genetic analysis.
  overallAssessment: |
    This clinical study investigates cognitive phenotypes in NF1 patients using standardized neuropsychological assessments and genetic testing. Clinical assessment tools are expected as the primary research instruments, including validated cognitive tests and intelligence scales. Laboratory methods for genetic analysis may also constitute research tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining failed to capture any tools despite this being a clinical study with clear tool usage
    - Multiple validated clinical assessment instruments were missed (Wechsler scales, Corsi task, School Achievement Test)
    - Laboratory genetic reagents and equipment were not detected
    - Mining patterns appear inadequate for clinical assessment tools and genetic analysis reagents
  recommendations: |
    - All 6 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent legitimate research instruments
    - Clinical assessment tool patterns need significant improvement to capture standardized psychological/cognitive tests
    - Genetic reagent patterns should include commercial kit names and vendor-specific products
    - The Wechsler intelligence scales and Corsi block-tapping task are widely used validated instruments that should be reliably detected
    - No observations were extracted as no tools were initially validated, but the study likely contains cognitive performance data that could be valuable
