  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a laboratory research study involving:
    - Computational tools for bioinformatics analysis (sequencing, fragmentomics, machine learning)
    - Genetic reagents (cfDNA extraction kits, sequencing libraries)
    - Potentially clinical assessment tools for patient classification
    
    The study involves whole-genome sequencing, computational analysis of cfDNA fragments,
    and machine learning approaches, so computational tools and genetic reagents are highly expected.
    Clinical assessment tools may be present for patient phenotyping and outcome measures.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a sophisticated laboratory research study combining molecular biology techniques with
    computational analysis. The study involves cfDNA extraction, whole-genome sequencing, and
    extensive bioinformatics analysis using multiple computational approaches. Tools are highly
    expected across computational, genetic reagent, and potentially clinical assessment categories.

      ichorCNA tool (Broad v.0.2.0) was used for copy-number–based estimation of tumor fraction from cfDNA whole-genome sequencing data. The tool performed GC content and mappability bias correction, depth-based local copy number estimates, and copy-number–based estimation of tumor fraction. Size-selected tumor fraction analysis was performed using in silico size selection of fragment lengths between 90 and 150 bp to enrich for ctDNA fragments.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were mined from this publication despite it being a sophisticated laboratory research study
    - The publication contains extensive computational analysis and uses multiple commercial reagents and software tools
    - Mining patterns appear to have missed standard bioinformatics tools, commercial kits, and laboratory reagents
    - Tool extraction patterns need improvement for capturing vendor-specific reagents and versioned software
  recommendations: |
    This publication should have yielded multiple tools across computational and genetic reagent categories:
    
    COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS (9 missed):
    - ichorCNA, samtools, Picard (bioinformatics software with versions)
    - Python sklearn, ComplexHeatmap (analysis libraries)
    - R, GraphPad Prism (statistical software)
    - Bioanalyzer, NovaSeq S4 platform (instruments/platforms)
    
    GENETIC REAGENTS (5 missed):
    - QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid kit, KAPA HyperPrep kit (extraction/prep kits)
    - Qubit dsDNA High-Sensitivity Assay kit (quantification reagent)
    - xGen UDI-UMI Adapters (sequencing reagents)
    - TruSight Oncology 500 (genomic profiling panel)
    
    The mining system needs significant improvement in pattern recognition for:
    1. Commercial kits with vendor names in parentheses
    2. Bioinformatics software with version numbers
    3. Laboratory instruments and platforms
    4. Python/R libraries and packages
    
    All 14 potentially missed tools should be added to improve mining accuracy for similar publications.
    The suggested patterns would significantly improve tool capture rates for computational biology studies.
