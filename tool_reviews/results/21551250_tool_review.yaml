    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a laboratory research study investigating neurofibroma development using mouse models.
    Expected tools include animal models (genetically modified mice), antibodies for immunostaining,
    and potentially genetic reagents for conditional gene knockout systems.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study with detailed Methods section describing mouse experiments,
    immunohistochemistry, and genetic manipulations. The study uses conditional knockout mice and
    tamoxifen-inducible systems to investigate NF1 function, indicating high likelihood of research tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining failed to detect any tools despite clear presence of research tools
    - Mouse strain nomenclature patterns not recognized (flox alleles, Cre lines)
    - Antibody information with vendor/dilution details missed
    - Standard research mouse suppliers (Jackson Labs) not detected
  recommendations: |
    All 5 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine research tools:
    - Three genetically modified mouse strains used for conditional gene knockout studies
    - Two antibodies used for immunohistochemistry with complete vendor information
    The suggested patterns would significantly improve detection of mouse models and antibodies.
    No observations extracted since no tools were initially validated, but the mouse models
    would likely have phenotypic observations in Results/Discussion sections.
