    This is a data portal/infrastructure paper describing the development of the NF Data Portal
    for neurofibromatosis research data sharing. Such papers typically:
    - Describe data sharing platforms and web portals (computational tools)
    - May mention analysis software used in the portal
    - Focus on community engagement and data governance rather than experimental tools
    
    Expected tool types: Possibly computational tools (web applications, databases)
    Unlikely tool types: Lab research tools (antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, organoids, PDX)
    Very unlikely: Clinical assessment tools (this is about data sharing, not patient assessment)
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication describes the development of a data sharing portal for the neurofibromatosis research community.
    It focuses on community engagement and data governance rather than experimental research methods.
    While it might mention computational infrastructure (databases, web applications), it would not typically
    contain traditional research tools like antibodies, cell lines, or clinical assessment instruments.

suggestedPatterns:
  - patternType: "term"
    pattern: "data portal"
    toolType: "computational_tool"
    examples: ["NF Data Portal"]
    reasoning: "Data portals are computational tools (web applications/databases) that enable data sharing and analysis. This pattern would catch disease-specific or research-focused data portals that serve as research infrastructure."
  - patternType: "context_phrase"
    pattern: "developed.*portal"
    toolType: "computational_tool"
    examples: ["developed a disease-focused data portal"]
    reasoning: "Context phrases indicating portal development would help identify computational tools that are web-based platforms for data sharing or analysis."

    reasoning: "Disease or research area acronyms followed by 'Data Portal' represent computational tools for data sharing and analysis in specific research domains."

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is about data sharing infrastructure, not experimental research
    - Only abstract available - no Methods, Results, or Discussion sections
    - Zero tools were mined, but the NF Data Portal itself is a computational tool that was missed
    - This type of publication (data portal/infrastructure) requires different mining patterns
  recommendations: |
    This publication describes the development of the NF Data Portal, which is itself a computational tool
    (web application/database) that should have been captured. The mining patterns appear to miss
    infrastructure tools like data portals, databases, and web applications.
    
    Recommendations:
    1. Add the NF Data Portal as a computational tool (web application/database type)
    2. Implement suggested patterns to catch data portals and similar infrastructure tools
    3. Consider that infrastructure papers may contain fewer traditional research tools
    4. No experimental observations can be extracted due to lack of Results/Discussion sections
    5. This publication type (infrastructure/data sharing) should be recognized as potentially containing computational tools even without traditional experimental methods
