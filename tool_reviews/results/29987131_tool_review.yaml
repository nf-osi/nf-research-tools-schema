  title: "The biology of cutaneous neurofibromas: Consensus recommendations for setting research priorities"
  queryType: "unknown"  # Not specified in input
  publicationType: "Review Article"
  publicationTypeConfidence: 0.95
  hasMethodsSection: Yes
  likelyContainsTools: No
  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a consensus review article that synthesizes existing literature and provides research recommendations.
    Review articles typically:
    - CITE tools from other studies but do not USE them experimentally
    - Discuss model systems conceptually without direct usage
    - Reference research approaches without implementing them
    
    Expected tool types for review articles: None (tools are cited, not used)
    
    However, review articles may mention tools from cited studies, which could be false positives
    if mining algorithms don't distinguish between tool usage vs. tool citation.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a consensus review article that summarizes existing knowledge and provides research recommendations
    for cutaneous neurofibroma biology. Review articles do not typically use research tools directly but rather
    cite and discuss tools used in other studies. Any tools mentioned would be citations from other work, not
    actual tool usage, making them false positives for tool mining purposes.

    reasoning: |
      This is a review article that cites tools from other studies rather than using them experimentally.
      Adding patterns based on review articles would increase false positives by capturing tool citations
      rather than tool usage. Mining algorithms should focus on primary research papers with experimental
      methods sections, not review articles that discuss tools conceptually.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a consensus review article, not primary research
    - No experimental methods section - only literature review methodology
    - All tool mentions are citations from other studies, not direct usage
    - Mining algorithms should exclude review articles to avoid false positives
    - Tools mentioned (mouse models, cell types) are discussed conceptually, not used experimentally
  recommendations: |
    CRITICAL RECOMMENDATION: This publication should be EXCLUDED from tool mining entirely.
    
    Reasons:
    1. This is a consensus review article that synthesizes existing literature
    2. No experimental work was conducted - only literature review and consensus meetings
    3. All tool mentions are citations from other studies, not actual tool usage
    4. Including review articles in tool mining will generate false positives
    
    Action items:
    1. Implement publication type filtering to exclude review articles, consensus statements, and meta-analyses
    2. Focus mining efforts on primary research papers with experimental methods
    3. Consider adding publication type classification as a pre-filtering step
    4. Review other publications in the dataset to identify similar review articles that should be excluded
    
    The 4 potentially missed tools identified should NOT be added because:
    - They represent citations from other studies, not tools used in this publication
    - Adding them would create false positives in the tool database
    - Review articles should not contribute tools to research tool databases
