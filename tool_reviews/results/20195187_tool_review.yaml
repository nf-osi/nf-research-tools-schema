  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining failed to detect any tools despite this being a clear lab research study
    - Multiple antibodies with vendor information were missed
    - Commercial cell line with catalog information not detected
    - Specialized siRNA reagent with product name not caught
    - Analytical instruments and software not identified
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The study uses human Schwann cell cultures, multiple antibodies for Western blot and immunofluorescence,
    specialized siRNA reagents, and analytical instruments. All 10 potentially missed tools should be
    added as they represent genuine research tools with vendor information and experimental usage context.
    The suggested patterns would significantly improve detection of similar tools in future mining.
    No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated, but this study would likely
    contain cellular and molecular phenotype observations related to merlin knockdown effects.
