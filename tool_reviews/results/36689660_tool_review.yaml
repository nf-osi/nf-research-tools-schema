    Publication 36689660 was not found in the available dataset.
  overallAssessment: |
    Unable to assess publication as PMID 36689660 is not present in the current tool_reviews dataset.
    The publication may need to be added to the inputs directory with proper JSON structure containing
    metadata, abstract, and full text sections before tool validation can be performed.

    CRITICAL ISSUE: Publication 36689660 not found in dataset
    - No input file exists at: /home/runner/work/nf-research-tools-schema/nf-research-tools-schema/tool_reviews/inputs/36689660_input.json
    - No cached text file exists at: /home/runner/work/nf-research-tools-schema/nf-research-tools-schema/tool_reviews/publication_cache/36689660_text.json
    - Publication appears to be missing from the current tool review system
  recommendations: |
    To complete tool validation for PMID 36689660:
    1. Obtain publication metadata, abstract, and full text
    2. Create 36689660_input.json file with proper structure containing:
       - Publication metadata (PMID, title, DOI, journal, year, queryType)
       - Abstract text
       - Full text sections (Methods, Introduction, Results, Discussion if available)
       - List of mined tools with their types and context
    3. Place input file in the inputs/ directory
    4. Re-run tool validation process
    
    The publication may be:
    - A newly published paper not yet processed
    - A requested PMID that hasn't been added to the dataset
    - An incorrect PMID that needs verification
    
    Without access to the publication content, no meaningful tool validation,
    pattern suggestions, or scientific observation extraction can be performed.
