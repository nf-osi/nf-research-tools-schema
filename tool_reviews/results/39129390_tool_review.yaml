  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a comprehensive lab research study involving:
    - Cell lines (Drosophila S2R+, human Schwann cells, ST88-14 MPNST cells)
    - Animal models (Drosophila mutants, mouse xenograft models)
    - Genetic reagents (CRISPR constructs, plasmids, RNAi libraries)
    - Antibodies (anti-NF1, anti-ERK, anti-PARP, etc.)
    - Computational tools (analysis software, databases)
    
    This publication should contain multiple tool types across all categories given the extensive
    experimental work described in methods and results sections.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a high-quality lab research publication with extensive experimental methods including
    cell culture, genetic engineering, drug screening, and animal studies. The comprehensive
    Methods section describes detailed protocols using numerous research tools. The fact that
    no tools were initially mined suggests significant gaps in the mining patterns, as this
    publication clearly uses many antibodies, cell lines, animal models, and genetic reagents.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: No tools were mined from this publication despite it being a comprehensive lab research study
    - The publication contains extensive use of cell lines, animal models, antibodies, genetic reagents, and computational tools
    - Mining patterns appear to miss standard nomenclature for Drosophila cell lines (S2R+)
    - Patient-derived cell line naming conventions not recognized
    - RRID identifiers not being used to identify cell lines
    - Antibody mentions with vendor/catalog information not caught
    - Well-known computational tools (STRING, Cytoscape) not identified
    - CRISPR plasmids and genetic constructs not recognized
  recommendations: |
    - This publication should have 15+ tools identified across multiple categories
    - All potentially missed tools should be added to improve mining coverage
    - The suggested patterns should be implemented to catch similar tools in future mining
    - Special attention needed for Drosophila nomenclature and patient-derived cell lines
    - RRID identifiers should be used as strong indicators of research tools
    - Vendor/catalog information patterns need improvement for antibody detection
    - The 8 scientific observations extracted provide valuable phenotypic data about NF1-deficient models
    - This represents a significant gap in the current mining approach for lab research publications
