  queryType: "unknown"  # From PubMed query (hint only)

  hasMethodsSection: No
  likelyContainsTools: Yes
  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on publication type (Questionnaire/Survey Development):
    - Clinical assessment tools: Expected - this study is developing the PedsQL™ NF1 module
    - Computational tools: Possible - qualitative data analysis may use software
    - Lab research tools: Unlikely - this is not laboratory research
    
    This publication focuses on qualitative interviews and questionnaire development for measuring
    health-related quality of life in NF1 patients. Clinical assessment tools are the primary
    expected tool type, specifically the PedsQL™ instrument mentioned in the abstract.

  overallAssessment: |
    This publication is questionnaire/survey development research focused on creating a disease-specific
    quality of life assessment tool (PedsQL™ NF1 module). Such studies typically develop, validate, or
    use clinical assessment tools for measuring patient-reported outcomes. The absence of a Methods
    section is typical for qualitative research. Clinical assessment tools are highly expected in this
    context, and the PedsQL™ mentioned in the abstract should have been detected as a validated tool.

  # No tools were mined, so no validations needed

potentiallyMissedTools:
  - toolName: "Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory™ (PedsQL™)"

    foundIn: "abstract"
    contextSnippet: "Data were drawn from qualitative interviews conducted for a larger study aimed at developing the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory™ (PedsQL™) NF1 module."
    whyMissed: "The mining patterns likely missed this due to the trademark symbols (™) and the fact it's mentioned as being 'developed' rather than 'used'. The tool name includes special characters and is embedded in a complex sentence structure."

    contextSnippet: "Data were drawn from qualitative interviews conducted for a larger study aimed at developing the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory™ (PedsQL™) NF1 module."
    whyMissed: "This is the disease-specific module of PedsQL being developed in this study. Mining patterns may not have recognized this as a distinct tool or may have been confused by the 'developing' context rather than 'using' context."

suggestedPatterns:
  - patternType: "term"
    pattern: "PedsQL|Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory"
    toolType: "clinical_assessment_tool"
    examples: ["Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory™ (PedsQL™)", "PedsQL™ NF1 module"]
    reasoning: "PedsQL is a widely validated pediatric quality of life assessment tool with disease-specific modules. The trademark symbols and various naming formats should be captured."

  - patternType: "context_phrase"
    pattern: "aimed at developing.*(?:questionnaire|inventory|scale|assessment|tool|instrument)"
    toolType: "clinical_assessment_tool"
    examples: ["aimed at developing the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory™ (PedsQL™) NF1 module"]
    reasoning: "Tool development context is important for clinical assessment tools. Many studies develop or validate instruments rather than just using existing ones."

  - patternType: "naming_convention"
    pattern: ".*™.*(?:module|scale|inventory|questionnaire)"
    toolType: "clinical_assessment_tool"
    examples: ["Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory™ (PedsQL™) NF1 module"]
    reasoning: "Trademark symbols (™, ®) often indicate validated, proprietary clinical assessment tools that should be captured."

  - patternType: "context_phrase"
    pattern: "health-related quality of life|HRQoL"
    toolType: "clinical_assessment_tool"
    examples: ["health-related quality of life (HRQoL)"]
    reasoning: "HRQoL studies typically use validated assessment instruments. This context phrase could help identify clinical assessment tools in quality of life research."

  majorIssuesFound: |
    Major issues identified during review:
    - Critical clinical assessment tool missed: PedsQL™ (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory) mentioned in abstract
    - Disease-specific module missed: PedsQL™ NF1 module being developed in this study
    - Mining patterns appear inadequate for clinical assessment tools with trademark symbols
    - Tool development context ("aimed at developing") not recognized as valid tool usage
    - No tools detected despite this being questionnaire/survey development research where clinical assessment tools are expected
  recommendations: |
    Strong recommendations for this publication:
    - ADD the missed PedsQL™ tools - these are validated clinical assessment instruments
    - This publication type (questionnaire development) should be a high-priority target for clinical assessment tool mining
    - Improve mining patterns to handle trademark symbols (™, ®) in tool names
    - Expand context recognition to include tool "development" and "validation" scenarios, not just "usage"
    - Consider that clinical studies often lack traditional Methods sections but still use/develop valid research tools
    - The suggested patterns would significantly improve detection of clinical assessment tools in similar publications
    - Future mining should prioritize quality of life and patient-reported outcome studies for clinical assessment tools
