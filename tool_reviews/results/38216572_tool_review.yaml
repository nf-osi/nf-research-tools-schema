  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a comprehensive lab research study that should contain multiple tool categories:
    - Antibodies (for immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting)
    - Cell lines (patient-derived neurofibroma and MPNST cell lines)
    - Animal models (mouse allografts, NU/NU mice)
    - Genetic reagents (CRISPRi constructs, sgRNAs, plasmids)
    - Computational tools (bioinformatics software for genomics analysis)
    
    The study involves DNA methylation profiling, whole exome sequencing, RNA sequencing, 
    single-cell RNA sequencing, immunohistochemistry, cell culture, CRISPRi screening,
    and mouse xenograft experiments - all requiring extensive research tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication represents a comprehensive laboratory research study that extensively uses research tools
    across multiple experimental platforms. The study should contain numerous antibodies, cell lines, animal
    models, genetic reagents, and computational tools. The fact that no tools were mined suggests a significant
    failure in the mining process, as this publication clearly describes experimental usage of many research tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Complete mining failure - no tools were extracted from a comprehensive lab research study
    - This publication contains extensive experimental methods using numerous research tools
    - At least 18 clear research tools were missed, including antibodies with catalog numbers, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, and computational tools
    - The mining patterns appear to be inadequate for detecting standard research tools
    - Many tools are mentioned with vendor names, catalog numbers, and specific experimental contexts
  recommendations: |
    - URGENT: Review and improve mining patterns - this represents a major failure
    - All 18 potentially missed tools should be added to the database
    - Implement the 8 suggested patterns to improve future mining accuracy
    - Focus on vendor-specific patterns (Cell Signaling Technology, Abcam, Addgene)
    - Add context-based patterns for computational tools and experimental procedures
    - This publication demonstrates the need for comprehensive pattern coverage
    - Consider manual curation of high-impact publications like this Nature Communications paper
    - The mining system needs significant improvement to handle standard lab research publications
