    Clinical Study → clinical assessment tools (imaging modalities like MRI), possibly computational tools for image analysis
    
    This is a clinical imaging study examining MRI findings in NF-1 patients. While it doesn't use traditional
    lab research tools (antibodies, cell lines, etc.), it does use MRI as a clinical assessment/imaging tool
    to evaluate brain abnormalities. The study methodology involves systematic MR imaging evaluation,
    which qualifies as a clinical assessment tool for neurological evaluation.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a clinical imaging study that uses MRI/MR imaging as the primary assessment tool to evaluate
    brain abnormalities in NF-1 patients. While no traditional laboratory research tools are expected,
    the imaging modality (T2-weighted MR imaging) serves as a clinical assessment tool for neurological
    evaluation and should have been captured by the mining system.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were mined from this publication despite clear usage of MRI as a clinical assessment tool
    - The mining system appears to miss medical imaging modalities as clinical assessment tools
    - Focus may be too narrow on questionnaires/scales, missing other clinical evaluation methods
  recommendations: |
    This publication demonstrates a gap in the mining system's coverage of clinical assessment tools.
    MRI/MR imaging is clearly used as a clinical assessment method to evaluate neurological abnormalities
    in NF-1 patients, but was not captured. The mining patterns should be expanded to include:
    
    1. Medical imaging modalities (MRI, CT, ultrasound, etc.) as clinical assessment tools
    2. Specific imaging sequences (T1-weighted, T2-weighted, FLAIR, etc.) as distinct tools
    3. Context phrases that indicate clinical evaluation using imaging
    
    All three potentially missed tools should be added to improve coverage of clinical assessment tools
    beyond traditional questionnaires and scales. No observations were extracted as no tools were
    validated, but the imaging findings described in the results could be linked to the imaging tools
    if they were properly captured.
