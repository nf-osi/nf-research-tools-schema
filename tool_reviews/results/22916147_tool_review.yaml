    This publication is a molecular biology/genetics laboratory study developing and validating a new 
    analytical method (MMPA). Expected tools include:
    - Genetic reagents (DNA extraction kits, PCR reagents, molecular biology kits)
    - Computational tools (analysis software, custom scripts, programming languages)
    - Laboratory equipment/instruments (though these may not be captured by current mining patterns)
    
    The study involves extensive molecular biology techniques, DNA analysis, and computational 
    method development, making it highly likely to contain multiple research tools across 
    genetic reagents and computational categories.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a clear laboratory research publication developing and validating a new molecular 
    analysis method (MMPA) for tumor genetic analysis. The study involves extensive wet lab

      Custom Ruby script developed for automated MMPA calculations. The script calculates and outputs 
      the Kμ (constant of proportionality), compares control-tumor pairs, determines average percentage 
      of normal tissue contamination in tumors, and identifies overall mechanism of allelic imbalance.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Complete failure of mining system to detect any tools despite clear laboratory research publication
    - Multiple commercial kits with vendor names were missed (Promega, Qiagen, Invitrogen)
    - Custom computational tool (mmpa.rb) with clear naming and usage context was missed
    - Commercial analysis software (Peak Scanner) with vendor attribution was missed
    - Programming language used for actual implementation (Ruby) was missed
    - Laboratory instruments may not be covered by current mining patterns
  recommendations: |
    This publication represents a significant mining failure - 8 clear research tools were missed 
    despite being a typical laboratory research study with detailed methods. The mining system 
    needs immediate improvement in several areas:
    
    1. **Genetic Reagent Detection**: Add patterns for commercial kits with vendor names in 
       parentheses (e.g., "Kit Name (Vendor)")
    2. **Custom Software Detection**: Add patterns for script files (.rb, .py, .pl extensions) 
       and "script named X" phrases
    3. **Commercial Software**: Improve detection of analysis software with vendor attribution
    4. **Programming Languages**: Better context analysis to distinguish actual usage from citations
    5. **Laboratory Instruments**: Consider whether to include analytical instruments in mining scope
    
    All 8 missed tools should be added to the database. The suggested patterns would significantly 
    improve mining accuracy for similar molecular biology publications. The observations extracted 
    provide valuable usage information for each validated tool.
