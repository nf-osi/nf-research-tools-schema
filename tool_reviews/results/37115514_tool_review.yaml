    Clinical Trial → clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, scales, outcome measures), computational tools for data analysis
    
    This phase 1/2 clinical trial would be expected to use:
    - Clinical assessment tools for measuring patient-reported outcomes (pain scales, quality of life measures)
    - Computational tools for volumetric imaging analysis and statistical analysis
    - Potentially imaging analysis software for MRI volumetric measurements
    
    Note: Clinical trials typically use validated clinical assessment instruments to measure outcomes,
    which are legitimate research tools even though they differ from traditional lab tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    This clinical trial publication would typically contain clinical assessment tools for measuring patient outcomes.
    The study specifically mentions patient-reported outcome measures for pain assessment, which are validated research tools.
    Clinical trials require standardized, validated instruments to measure efficacy and safety endpoints, making tool usage highly likely.

      Overall confirmed partial response (cPR) rate was 70% (52/74 children), defined as ≥20% decrease
      from baseline tumor volume on 2 consecutive evaluations. Responses were generally sustained with
      59% (44) lasting ≥ 12 cycles, demonstrating durable tumor shrinkage over extended treatment.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were mined from this clinical trial publication despite clear usage of clinical assessment tools
    - Mining patterns appear inadequate for capturing clinical assessment instruments used in trials
    - Specific pain scales and outcome measures were completely missed
    - Computational imaging analysis methods not detected
  recommendations: |
    This publication demonstrates a significant gap in mining clinical assessment tools from clinical trials.
    Three legitimate research tools were missed:
    1. Numeric Rating Scale-11 (validated pain assessment tool)
    2. Pain interference index (quality of life assessment)
    3. Volumetric MRI analysis (computational tool for tumor measurement)
    
    All three tools should be added to the database as they represent validated research instruments
    used to measure clinical outcomes. The suggested patterns would help capture similar tools in
    future clinical trial publications. The observations extracted show meaningful clinical findings
    related to sustained pain improvement and tumor response over extended treatment periods.
