  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on the publication type (Clinical Study on selumetinib treatment):
    - Clinical assessment tools → Expected for measuring patient outcomes, quality of life, tumor response
    - Computational tools → Possibly for statistical analysis of clinical data
    - Lab Research tools → Unlikely (antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, organoids, PDX)
    
    This appears to be a clinical trial or observational study of selumetinib treatment in pediatric NF1 patients.
    Such studies typically use clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, scales, imaging assessments) rather than
    laboratory research tools. However, they may use computational tools for data analysis.
  overallAssessment: |
    This clinical study on selumetinib treatment in children with NF1 would typically use clinical assessment tools
    for measuring treatment outcomes, patient-reported measures, and tumor response assessments. Laboratory research
    tools (antibodies, cell lines, animal models) would be unexpected in this type of clinical study. The absence
    of mined tools may be accurate if the study relied on standard clinical measures without validated instruments.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a clinical study on selumetinib treatment, not laboratory research
    - No research tools were mined, which may be accurate for this publication type
    - Clinical assessment tools (RECIST, QoL instruments) may have been missed if not explicitly named
    - Statistical analysis software likely used but not captured in mining
  recommendations: |
    - The absence of mined tools appears appropriate for this clinical study publication
    - Consider enhancing mining patterns to capture clinical assessment tools (RECIST, QoL instruments)
    - Add patterns for statistical analysis software commonly used in clinical trials
    - Manual review recommended to confirm no validated clinical instruments were used
    - This publication type (clinical trial/study) should primarily yield clinical assessment tools, not lab tools
    - Future mining should focus on clinical outcome measures and statistical analysis tools for similar publications
