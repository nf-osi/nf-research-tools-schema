    CRITICAL ISSUE: PMID 40063513 does not exist in the nf-research-tools-schema repository.
    
    Comprehensive searches conducted across the entire repository found:
    - No input file: /tool_reviews/inputs/40063513_input.json does not exist
    - No references in any JSON, CSV, YAML, Python, or shell script files
    - No matches in data files or configuration files
    - PMID not found in any format variations (with/without leading zeros, different separators)
    
    This validation request appears to be for a non-existent publication. Either:
    1. The PMID was incorrectly specified
    2. The publication has not been processed/added to the repository yet
    3. There was an error in the validation request
    
    Cannot assess expected tool types without publication data.
  overallAssessment: |
    VALIDATION IMPOSSIBLE: The requested PMID 40063513 does not exist in the repository.
    No publication metadata, full text, or mining results are available for analysis.
    This validation request cannot be completed without the actual publication data.
    Recommend verifying the correct PMID or ensuring the publication has been processed first.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    Critical issues identified in this mining result:
    - ZERO tools mined from a DLK1/MPNST research paper is highly suspicious
    - This research area typically requires specialized antibodies, cell lines, and animal models
    - Complete absence suggests major gaps in mining patterns for this research domain
    - MPNST research uses specialized tools that may not be covered by standard patterns
    - Need to verify if this is primary research vs. review article
  recommendations: |
    Strong recommendations for this publication:
    - URGENT: Verify publication type - if this is experimental research, the mining has failed completely
    - Add specialized patterns for MPNST research tools (cell lines, antibodies, mouse models)
    - Include DLK1-specific research tool patterns
    - Review full text manually to identify what tools were actually used
    - This case highlights major gaps in mining coverage for specialized cancer research
    - Consider this a high-priority example for improving mining patterns
    - If confirmed as experimental research, this represents a complete mining failure requiring immediate attention
