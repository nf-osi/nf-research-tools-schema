  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining failed to capture any tools despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple categories of tools were missed: cell lines, genetic reagents, computational tools, and antibodies
    - The mining patterns appear inadequate for capturing tools with vendor information and catalog numbers
    - Bioinformatics tools with version numbers were not captured
    - Commercial systems and reagents with company names were missed
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous research tools that were completely missed by the initial mining.
    The study uses cell lines (ipn97.4), genetic constructs (mNf1 cDNA, CRISPR), computational tools
    (GATK, BWA, Scaffold, IPA), and antibodies with catalog numbers. The mining patterns need significant
    improvement to capture tools with vendor information, version numbers, and standard nomenclature.
    All 15 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine research tools used in
    the experimental procedures. The suggested patterns would help capture similar tools in future mining.
