  title: "Modeling nervous system tumors with human stem cells and organoids."
  queryType: "bench"  # From PubMed query (hint only)
  publicationType: "Review Article"
  publicationTypeConfidence: 0.95  # Very high confidence - abstract explicitly states "In this review"
  hasMethodsSection: No
  likelyContainsTools: No
  expectedToolTypes: |
    Review articles typically do NOT contain experimental research tools. Instead, they:
    - Discuss tools conceptually from other studies
    - Cite tools from literature without experimental usage
    - Compare different modeling approaches theoretically
    
    While the queryType is "bench" (suggesting lab research), the publication type is clearly a review.
    Review articles may mention tools but rarely use them experimentally. Any tool mentions would likely
    be citations or conceptual discussions rather than actual experimental usage.
    
    Expected tool types for review articles: None (tools mentioned are typically from cited studies)
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a review article that discusses various nervous system tumor modeling approaches including
    organoids, PDX models, and stem cell-derived models. Review articles synthesize existing literature
    rather than report original experimental work, so they typically do not use research tools directly.
    Any tool mentions would be conceptual discussions or citations from other studies, not experimental usage.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a review article, not experimental research
    - No Methods section indicating experimental procedures
    - Abstract explicitly states "In this review" confirming review article status
    - Only abstract text available - no full text sections for detailed analysis
    - Review articles discuss tools conceptually but don't use them experimentally
  recommendations: |
    This publication should be EXCLUDED from tool mining efforts because:
    
    1. **Review Article Classification**: The abstract explicitly states "In this review", confirming this is
       a literature review rather than experimental research.
    
    2. **No Experimental Context**: Absence of Methods, Results, and Discussion sections indicates no
       experimental procedures were performed.
    
    3. **Conceptual Tool Mentions**: Any tool mentions (PDX models, organoids, etc.) in the abstract are
       conceptual discussions of modeling approaches, not specific experimental tools.
    
    4. **Mining Strategy**: The mining algorithm correctly identified 0 tools, which is appropriate for
       review articles. No tools were missed because review articles don't contain experimental tools.
    
    5. **Future Filtering**: Consider adding publication type classification to filter out review articles
       before tool mining, as they rarely contain experimental research tools.
    
    VERDICT: No action needed - the mining results are correct for this publication type.
