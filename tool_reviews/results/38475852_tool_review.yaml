  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a clinical intervention study evaluating the effectiveness of a telehealth PEERS® intervention
    for adolescents with NF1. Expected tool types include:
    - Clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, scales, outcome measures) - PRIMARY
    - Computational tools for statistical analysis (SPSS mentioned)
    
    The study uses multiple validated clinical assessment instruments to measure social functioning,
    cognitive abilities, and intervention outcomes. These are legitimate research tools used in
    clinical research to quantify patient outcomes and intervention effectiveness.
  overallAssessment: |
    This clinical trial publication extensively uses validated clinical assessment tools and questionnaires
    to measure intervention outcomes. The study has a comprehensive Methods section describing multiple
    standardized instruments (KBIT-2, WIAT-III, SSIS-SEL, SRS-2, FQS, QSQ, TASSK, etc.). These are
    genuine research tools essential for clinical outcome measurement. The mining system completely
    missed these clinical assessment tools, which is a significant oversight.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Mining system completely failed to detect clinical assessment tools
    - This clinical trial uses 9+ validated clinical assessment instruments (KBIT-2, WIAT-III, SSIS-SEL, SRS-2, SCQ, FQS, QSQ, TASSK, KSADS-ADHD)
    - Statistical software tools (IBM SPSS, GPower) were also missed
    - The PEERS intervention protocol itself is a structured clinical tool
    - All tools have clear usage context with detailed descriptions in Methods section
    - This represents a complete failure of clinical assessment tool detection
  recommendations: |
    - URGENT: Add comprehensive clinical assessment tool patterns to mining system
    - Clinical studies require different mining approaches than lab research
    - Focus on questionnaire/scale/test terminology and abbreviated forms (acronyms)
    - Include statistical software detection for computational tools
    - This publication should have 18-20 tools detected, not zero
    - Implement patterns suggested above to capture clinical assessment instruments
    - Consider that clinical publications may not have traditional "lab" tools but contain valid research instruments
    - Review other clinical publications to ensure similar tools aren't being systematically missed
