  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study investigating alternative splicing modulation using antisense oligonucleotides in cell culture systems. The publication contains extensive experimental methods including cell culture, molecular biology techniques, immunofluorescence, western blotting, and RNA-seq analysis. This type of study would typically use multiple research tools including cell lines, genetic reagents, antibodies, and computational analysis tools. The comprehensive methods section indicates active experimental usage of research tools rather than just citations.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    Critical mining failure - no tools were detected despite extensive experimental methods:
    - Publication contains comprehensive laboratory methods with clear tool usage
    - Multiple cell lines with ATCC catalog numbers completely missed
    - Extensive antibody panel with vendor/dilution information not detected
    - Genetic reagents (PMOs) mentioned in abstract and methods not found
    - Multiple computational tools with version numbers not captured
    - RNA-seq analysis pipeline tools (TopHat, Bowtie2, Trimmomatic) not detected
    - Statistical and visualization software not identified
    
    This represents a complete failure of the mining system for a tool-rich publication.
  recommendations: |
    URGENT: Complete overhaul of mining patterns needed for this publication type:
    
    1. **Cell Lines**: Add patterns for ATCC catalog numbers (CRL-XXXX format)
    2. **Antibodies**: Implement vendor + dilution ratio patterns (Company, 1:1000 format)
    3. **Genetic Reagents**: Add specific patterns for oligonucleotide types (PMOs, ASOs)
    4. **Computational Tools**: Improve version number detection (v2.0.9, version 8.2.1 formats)
    5. **Context Recognition**: Better detection of "processed with", "analyzed using" phrases
    6. **Plugin Detection**: Add patterns for software plugins (ImageJ plugins)
    7. **R Package Detection**: Improve R package identification in bioinformatics contexts
    
    This publication should be used as a test case for validating improved mining patterns.
    All 21 missed tools should be added to the database with proper categorization.
    The mining system failed completely on a straightforward laboratory research paper.
