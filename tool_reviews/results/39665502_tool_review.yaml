  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on this clinical neuroimaging study, expected tool types include:
    - Clinical assessment tools: Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI-2), Tanner staging scales
    - Computational tools: FSL software suite, MATLAB toolboxes, R statistical software, imaging analysis pipelines
    - Advanced imaging techniques: NODDI and DKI (though these are methodological approaches rather than discrete tools)
    
    This is a prospective clinical study with sophisticated neuroimaging analysis, so computational tools for 
    image processing and statistical analysis are expected, along with standardized clinical assessment instruments.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a prospective clinical neuroimaging study that would typically use multiple research tools. The study 
    involves advanced MRI data acquisition and analysis, requiring computational tools for image processing, 
    statistical analysis, and data visualization. Clinical assessment tools are used for participant characterization 
    (IQ testing, pubertal staging). The sophisticated methodology suggests multiple computational tools should be present.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were mined from this publication despite clear evidence of multiple computational and clinical assessment tools
    - This represents a significant mining failure for a sophisticated neuroimaging study
    - Multiple software tools with specific version numbers were explicitly mentioned in methods
    - Clinical assessment instruments were clearly described and used
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous research tools that were completely missed by the mining process:
    - 8 computational tools including FSL, MATLAB, R, and specialized neuroimaging packages
    - 2 clinical assessment tools (WASI-2, Tanner staging)
    - All tools have clear usage context and version information
    - The mining patterns need significant improvement to catch neuroimaging software and clinical assessment tools
    - This type of clinical neuroimaging study should be a high-yield target for tool mining
    - Suggested patterns focus on version numbers, package names, and standardized assessment instruments
    - All potentially missed tools should be added to improve database completeness
