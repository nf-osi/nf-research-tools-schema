    Cannot determine expected tool types without access to publication content.
    The file 32088262_input.json does not exist in the dataset.
    
    Available files in the inputs directory have PMIDs ranging from 26941216 to 34345017,
    but none match the requested PMID 32088262.
    
    If this publication were available, tool type expectations would depend on:
    - Publication type (lab research vs clinical study vs review)
    - Presence of Methods section
    - Study design and experimental approach
  overallAssessment: |
    Unable to perform tool validation for PMID 32088262 as the input file does not exist
    in the current dataset. The closest available PMID is 32152628. To complete this
    review, the publication data would need to be added to the inputs directory first.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication file 32088262_input.json does not exist in the dataset
    - Cannot perform tool validation without access to publication metadata, abstract, full text, and mined tools
    - Available input files in the dataset appear to be empty or inaccessible
    - Closest available PMID in dataset is 32152628 (difference of ~64,000)
  recommendations: |
    To complete tool validation for PMID 32088262:
    1. Add the publication data to the inputs directory as 32088262_input.json
    2. Ensure the file contains required fields: publication metadata, abstract, full text sections, and mined tools
    3. Verify file permissions and content accessibility
    4. Re-run the tool validation process once the data is available
    
    Alternative approach:
    - If this PMID was requested in error, consider reviewing one of the available PMIDs
    - The closest available PMID is 32152628 which could be reviewed instead
    
    Dataset status:
    - Input files exist but appear to be empty or inaccessible
    - This may indicate a data pipeline issue that needs investigation
    - Consider checking the publication_cache directory for raw publication text
