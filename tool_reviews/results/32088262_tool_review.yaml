  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on the extensive Methods section and experimental design, this lab research publication
    is expected to contain multiple tool types:
    - Cell lines (multiple MPNST cell models, control cell lines)
    - Animal models (transgenic mice, knockout mice)
    - Antibodies (for Western blot, immunohistochemistry)
    - Computational tools (RNA-seq analysis, statistical software, image analysis)
    - Genetic reagents (knockout mice, transgenic constructs)
    
    The study involves cell culture, animal experiments, molecular biology techniques,
    RNA sequencing, and extensive data analysis - all requiring various research tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study investigating TRAP1 function in MPNST
    tumor microenvironment using multiple experimental approaches. The extensive Methods section
    describes cell culture, animal experiments, molecular biology, RNA sequencing, and various
    assays. Such studies typically require numerous research tools across all categories.
    The fact that 0 tools were mined suggests significant gaps in the mining process.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    Critical mining failure - 0 tools captured despite extensive methodology:
    - Publication contains extensive Methods section with detailed experimental procedures
    - Multiple cell lines explicitly mentioned with sources and catalog information
    - Animal models clearly described including transgenic and knockout mice
    - Antibodies listed in detailed table with vendors and catalog numbers
    - Computational tools extensively used for RNA-seq analysis and data processing
    - Complete failure to capture any research tools suggests fundamental issues with mining patterns
  recommendations: |
    URGENT: Complete revision of mining patterns required:
    - This publication should have yielded 20+ tools across multiple categories
    - Cell line patterns need to capture abbreviated names and non-standard nomenclature
    - Animal model patterns should include standard mouse strain designations and knockout terminology
    - Antibody patterns must capture vendor/catalog number combinations
    - Computational tool patterns need better coverage of bioinformatics software
    - Context-based patterns should be added to capture tool usage phrases
    - The mining system appears to have fundamental gaps that need immediate attention
    - All suggested patterns should be implemented and tested on this publication
    - Consider this publication as a test case for pattern validation
