  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a clinical methodology study that developed and validated a new quantification method for skin neurofibromas.
    Expected tool types:
    - Clinical assessment tools: The paper frames method itself is a clinical assessment tool for quantifying neurofibromas
    - Computational tools: Statistical software (SPSS, Excel) and image analysis software (Paint®) used for data analysis
    - Potentially missed: Digital camera (Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W30) could be considered a clinical assessment tool for documentation
    
    Note: While queryType is "bench", this is actually a clinical study developing a clinical assessment methodology.
    The study involves human subjects and clinical measurements, not laboratory bench work.
  overallAssessment: |
    This clinical methodology study developed and validated a new method for quantifying skin neurofibromas in NF1 patients.
    The study contains clinical assessment tools (the paper frames method) and computational tools for statistical analysis.
    Despite being found by a "bench" query, this is clearly a clinical study with clinical assessment tools, not laboratory tools.

      The paper frames method demonstrated excellent interexaminer reliability with ICC values ranging from 0.992-0.997.
      The method uses 100cm² paper frames placed on back, abdomen, and thigh to count neurofibromas.
      Agreement between examiners was >90% when threshold of 10 neurofibromas was reached, and ~96% at 20 neurofibromas.
      Method can predict total number of skin neurofibromas using specific formulas: 65.6 + 9.7x (examiner A, R²=0.63) 
      and 38.6 + 10.3x (examiner B, R²=0.64).
    foundIn: "results"
    contextSnippet: "There was excellent agreement between examiners (ICC range 0.992-0.997) and the total number of skin neurofibromas could be predicted by the adhesive frames technique using a specific formula (P < 0.0001)"

    details: |
      Proportional bias observed in individuals with ≥100 neurofibromas - counting errors tend to be higher as 
      the number of skin neurofibromas increases. Examiner A tended to obtain higher values than examiner B, 
      particularly in individuals with >100 neurofibromas. This discrepancy may occur due to superposition 
      of neurofibromas in areas with high tumor concentration.
    foundIn: "results"

      The method is described as reliable, easy, and rapid for quantifying skin neurofibromas. 
      It can be used for longitudinal studies to track evolution of neurofibroma number and size over time.
      The method has potential for automation through computerized picture analysis.
      Skin color (white vs black) was not a confounding factor and did not affect counting accuracy.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a methodology study that developed and used several tools
    - The main clinical assessment tool (paper frames method) was completely missed
    - Statistical software tools (SPSS, Excel, Paint®) with specific versions were not captured
    - Publication was classified as "bench" query but is actually a clinical methodology study
  recommendations: |
    This publication should have several tools added:
    - Paper frames method: The primary clinical assessment tool developed and validated in this study
    - SPSS v. 20.0: Statistical analysis software with specific version
    - Paint® software: Image analysis tool used for neurofibroma counting
    - Excel 2011: Additional statistical analysis software
    
    The mining patterns need improvement to capture:
    - Novel clinical assessment methodologies being developed/validated
    - Statistical software with vendor information and version numbers
    - Image analysis software used in clinical studies
    
    Three high-quality scientific observations were extracted documenting the tool's performance,
    limitations, and practical applications. The observations provide valuable information about
    interexaminer reliability, bias issues, and clinical utility of the paper frames method.
