  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: No tools were mined from this publication despite it being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple antibodies used for immunohistochemistry were completely missed
    - Computational tools including mass spectrometry software, statistical software, and imaging systems were not captured
    - Laboratory instruments and reagents with specific vendor information were not detected
    - The mining system failed to recognize standard research tool contexts like "immunolabeled for" and "incubation with antibody"
  recommendations: |
    - ALL 18 potentially missed tools should be added to the database - this represents a complete mining failure
    - The mining patterns need significant improvement to capture:
      * Immunohistochemistry contexts ("immunolabeled for", "incubation with antibody")
      * Software with version numbers
      * Laboratory instruments and systems
      * Biochemical reagents with vendor information
    - This publication demonstrates that the current mining system has major gaps in detecting standard research tools
    - The suggested patterns should be implemented immediately to prevent similar failures
    - Manual curator review is essential for this publication type to ensure comprehensive tool capture
    - High-quality observations were successfully extracted showing the tools' experimental performance and validation
