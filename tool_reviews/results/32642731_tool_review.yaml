# TOOL VALIDATION REVIEW FOR PMID 32642731
# STATUS: INCOMPLETE - INPUT DATA NOT AVAILABLE
# 
# This template demonstrates the expected structure for tool validation
# once the input JSON file is populated with publication data.

publicationMetadata:
  pmid: "32642731"
  title: "[TITLE NOT AVAILABLE - INPUT FILE EMPTY]"
  queryType: "unknown"  # Will be determined from input data
  publicationType: "Unknown"  # Cannot determine without publication content
  publicationTypeConfidence: 0.0
  hasMethodsSection: "Unknown"
  likelyContainsTools: "Unsure"
  expectedToolTypes: |
    Cannot determine expected tool types without access to publication content.
    Once input data is available, will analyze:
    - Publication type (lab research, clinical study, review, etc.)
    - Presence of Methods section
    - Study design and methodology
    - Content of abstract and full text sections
    
    Expected analysis approach:
    - Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    - Clinical Study/Trial → clinical assessment tools, possibly computational tools for analysis
    - Bioinformatics Analysis → computational tools (software, pipelines)
    - Review Articles → typically citations only, not actual tool usage
  overallAssessment: |
    Unable to assess publication without input data. The input file 
    /home/runner/work/nf-research-tools-schema/nf-research-tools-schema/tool_reviews/inputs/32642731_input.json
    appears to be empty. Once populated with publication metadata, abstract, full text sections,
    and mined tools list, will perform comprehensive validation following these criteria:
    
    1. Analyze publication type and study design
    2. Validate each mined tool against context and usage patterns
    3. Search for potentially missed tools across all 8 categories
    4. Extract scientific observations from Results/Discussion sections
    5. Suggest improved mining patterns based on findings

    CRITICAL ISSUE: Input file is empty or not populated.
    - File path: /home/runner/work/nf-research-tools-schema/nf-research-tools-schema/tool_reviews/inputs/32642731_input.json
    - File exists but contains no content
    - Cannot perform tool validation without publication data
    - Need publication metadata, abstract, full text sections, and mined tools list
  recommendations: |
    IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
    1. Populate input JSON file with publication data for PMID 32642731
    2. Ensure file contains required fields:
       - Publication metadata (title, DOI, journal, year, queryType)
       - Abstract text
       - Full text sections (Methods, Introduction, Results, Discussion if available)
       - List of mined tools with types and context
    3. Re-run validation process once data is available
    
    VALIDATION METHODOLOGY READY:
    Once data is available, will apply rigorous validation criteria:
    - Conservative approach: reject ambiguous cases
    - Focus on experimental usage vs. citations
    - Distinguish tools from disease/gene references
    - Search comprehensively for missed tools
    - Extract quantitative scientific observations
    - Suggest actionable pattern improvements

# NOTE: This template demonstrates the complete validation workflow.
# All sections will be populated with actual analysis once input data becomes available.
