    Review articles typically do not contain research tools as they synthesize existing literature
    rather than report original experimental work. This manuscript reviews current understanding
    of MPNST pathogenesis, diagnostic workup, treatment paradigms, and investigational options.
    While it may cite tools used in referenced studies, it would not directly use or develop
    research tools itself. The absence of Methods, Results, and Discussion sections confirms
    this is a narrative review rather than an experimental study.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive review article about MPNST diagnosis and management. Review articles
    synthesize existing literature and do not typically conduct original experiments requiring
    research tools. The lack of Methods, Results, and Discussion sections confirms this is not
    an experimental study that would use antibodies, cell lines, animal models, or other research tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a review article, not original research
    - No Methods section indicating experimental procedures
    - No Results or Discussion sections with experimental findings
    - Only abstract text available, no full text sections provided
    - Review articles typically cite tools from other studies but do not use tools directly
  recommendations: |
    This publication should be excluded from tool mining as it is a review article that does not
    conduct original experimental research. Review articles may mention tools in the context of
    discussing other studies, but these would be citations rather than actual tool usage.
    The mining algorithm correctly identified zero tools, which is appropriate for this publication type.
    No additional patterns are needed as the absence of tools is expected and correct for review articles.
    Future mining should continue to exclude review articles unless they specifically describe
    tool development or comparative tool analyses.
