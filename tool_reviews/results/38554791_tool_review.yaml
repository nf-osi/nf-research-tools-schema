    Review Article → Typically does not contain research tools used by the authors themselves.
    Review articles summarize and synthesize existing literature, citing tools used by other researchers
    but not reporting original experimental work. They may mention:
    - Bacterial strains (cited from other studies)
    - Cell lines (from reviewed papers)
    - Animal models (from literature)
    - Clinical assessment tools (from reviewed clinical studies)
    
    However, these would be citations of tools used by others, not tools used in original research
    by the review authors. The absence of Methods, Results, and Discussion sections confirms
    this is not an original research study.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is clearly a review article that synthesizes existing literature on hypoxia-targeting bacteria
    for cancer therapy. Review articles typically do not use research tools themselves but rather
    discuss tools used by others in the reviewed studies. The absence of Methods, Results, and Discussion
    sections confirms this is not original experimental research. No tools were mined, which is appropriate
    for this publication type.

potentiallyMissedTools:

    toolType: "genetic_reagent"
    foundIn: "abstract"
    contextSnippet: "...noteworthy alternative has emerged through the utilization of anaerobic oncolytic bacteria. These bacteria exhibit a preference for accumulating..."
    whyMissed: "This could be considered a therapeutic agent/genetic reagent, but in the context of a review article, it represents a class of tools discussed rather than specific tools used"
    confidence: 0.2

  - toolName: "bacterial strains"
    toolType: "genetic_reagent"
    foundIn: "abstract"
    contextSnippet: "...particularly as several strains have progressed to clinical evaluation."
    whyMissed: "Generic reference to bacterial strains without specific strain names or experimental usage context"

suggestedPatterns:
  - patternType: "context_phrase"
    pattern: "review article exclusion - avoid mining from publications without Methods sections"
    toolType: "general"
    examples: ["Publications with only abstract and no experimental sections"]
    reasoning: "Review articles should be filtered out during initial mining as they cite tools used by others rather than reporting original tool usage. This would reduce false positive mining."
  - patternType: "term"
    pattern: "specific bacterial strain nomenclature (e.g., Clostridium novyi-NT, Salmonella typhimurium VNP20009)"
    toolType: "genetic_reagent"
    examples: ["Not found in this abstract-only review"]
    reasoning: "When bacterial strains are mentioned with specific strain designations and experimental context, they could be valid genetic reagents. However, this requires full-text access and experimental usage context."

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a review article, not original research
    - No Methods, Results, or Discussion sections available
    - Only abstract text provided, limiting analysis depth
    - Missing key metadata (journal, year, queryType)
    - Review articles typically cite tools used by others rather than reporting original tool usage
  recommendations: |
    This publication should be excluded from tool mining entirely as it is a review article without
    original experimental work. The mining system correctly identified 0 tools, which is appropriate.
    
    For future mining improvements:
    1. Implement publication type filtering to exclude review articles during initial mining
    2. Require presence of Methods section for lab research tool mining
    3. Focus mining efforts on original research publications with experimental sections
    4. Consider separate mining strategies for review articles if the goal is to catalog
       tools mentioned in literature reviews (though this would require different validation criteria)
    
    No manual curator review is needed for this publication as the absence of mined tools is correct.
    The potentially missed tools identified are generic references appropriate for a review context
    and should not be added to tool databases.
