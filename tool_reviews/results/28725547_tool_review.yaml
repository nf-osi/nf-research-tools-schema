    Lab Research → computational tools (neuroimaging analysis software), clinical assessment tools (cognitive tests)
    
    This neuroimaging study uses fMRI to investigate cognitive deficits in NF1 patients. Expected tools include:
    - Computational tools: FSL, SPSS, neuroimaging analysis software
    - Clinical assessment tools: cognitive assessment batteries (WASI, WAIS-IV, working memory tasks)
    
    Note: While queryType is "bench", this study combines both computational neuroimaging analysis 
    and clinical cognitive assessments, so tools from multiple categories are expected.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a neuroimaging research study that clearly uses multiple research tools for data acquisition, 
    analysis, and cognitive assessment. The extensive Methods section describes fMRI protocols, statistical 
    analysis software, and standardized cognitive assessment instruments. Tools are expected and extensively 
    used throughout the experimental workflow. The study combines computational neuroimaging analysis with 
    clinical cognitive assessments, making it likely to contain both computational tools and clinical assessment tools.

      FSL version 5.0 was used for fMRI data analysis including image realignment, spatial smoothing, 
      temporal filtering, registration, and statistical analysis. Specific parameters included: 
      5-mm FWHM Gaussian kernel for smoothing, nonlinear high-pass filter with 66s cutoff, 
      three-step registration process to MNI space. Group-level statistics used cluster-forming 
      threshold of z>2.3 and z>3.1 with cluster probability p<0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons.

      WASI Matrix Reasoning and Vocabulary subtests were used to assess IQ in NF1 patients. 
      NF1 patients showed significantly lower Full Scale IQ (98.70 ± 14.10) compared to 
      healthy controls (112.36 ± 21.32, p=0.012). Matrix Reasoning T-scores were also

      FLAME (FMRIB's Local Analysis of Mixed Effects) was used for group-level statistical 
      analysis of fMRI data. According to cited research (Eklund et al., 2016), FSL's FLAME1 
      clusterwise inference has much lower family-wise error rates than other parametric 
      software packages, often being valid (under 5%), but comes at the expense of highly 
      conservative voxelwise inference. FLAME1 at cluster threshold 2.3 has error rates 
      comparable to permutation methods.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Mining process completely failed to detect any tools despite this being a tool-rich neuroimaging study
    - Multiple computational tools (FSL, SPSS, FLAME, Harvard-Oxford atlas) were missed
    - Several clinical assessment tools (WASI, WAIS-IV, LNS, SCAP) were not detected
    - All missed tools have clear usage context and version/reference information
    - This represents a significant mining failure for a publication that extensively uses research tools
  recommendations: |
    - All 8 identified tools should be added to the database - they represent genuine research tools with clear experimental usage
    - The mining patterns need significant improvement to capture neuroimaging software and cognitive assessment tools
    - FSL and SPSS are major analysis platforms that should never be missed when version numbers are provided
    - Clinical assessment tools like WASI and WAIS-IV are standardized instruments that should be reliably detected
    - The suggested patterns should be implemented to improve future mining of similar neuroimaging studies
    - This publication demonstrates the need for better coverage of computational tools and clinical assessment instruments
    - All observations extracted provide valuable information about tool performance and usage considerations
