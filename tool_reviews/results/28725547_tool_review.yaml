    Clinical Study → clinical assessment tools (neuropsychological measures, cognitive assessments), 
    computational tools for neuroimaging analysis (FSL, statistical software). This fMRI study of 
    NF1 patients uses validated cognitive assessments and neuroimaging analysis software.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a clinical neuroimaging study comparing NF1 patients to healthy controls using fMRI 
    during spatial working memory tasks. The study uses validated neuropsychological assessments 
    and sophisticated neuroimaging analysis software. Clinical assessment tools and computational 
    tools are expected and present.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining failed to capture any tools despite this being a clinical study with clear tool usage
    - Multiple validated clinical assessment tools (WASI, WAIS-IV, LNS task, SCAP task) were missed
    - Neuroimaging analysis software (FSL, FLAME, gPPI) was not detected
    - Mining patterns appear inadequate for clinical assessment tools and neuroimaging software
  recommendations: |
    All 7 potentially missed tools should be added - they represent legitimate research tools used in this study.
    The WASI, WAIS-IV, and LNS are standardized clinical assessment instruments widely used in NF research.
    The SCAP task is a validated spatial working memory assessment. FSL, FLAME, and gPPI are established
    neuroimaging analysis tools. Mining patterns need significant improvement for clinical assessment tools
    and neuroimaging software to capture tools in similar clinical neuroimaging studies.
