  expectedToolTypes: |
    Review articles typically do not contain actual research tools used by the authors.
    Instead, they discuss and cite tools used in other studies. The abstract clearly states
    this is a review that "summarizes the state-of-the-art of various therapeutic approaches"
    for NF1. Review articles may mention:
    - Therapeutic techniques (cDNA replacement, CRISPR, antisense oligonucleotides) as concepts
    - Delivery methods (viral vectors, nanoparticles) as general approaches
    - But these are discussed as literature review topics, not as tools actually used in experiments
    
    Since this is a review article without a Methods section, no actual research tools
    (antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids,
    PDX models, or clinical assessment tools) are expected to be found.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive review article discussing mutation-directed therapeutic approaches
    for neurofibromatosis type I (NF1). Review articles synthesize existing literature rather
    than report original experimental work, so they would not typically use or develop research
    tools themselves. The absence of a Methods section confirms this is not an experimental study.
    Any tools mentioned would likely be citations from other studies rather than tools used by these authors.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a review article, not original experimental research
    - No Methods section present, confirming lack of experimental procedures
    - Abstract clearly states this is a review summarizing existing therapeutic approaches
    - Review articles discuss tools from other studies but don't use tools themselves
  recommendations: |
    This publication should be excluded from tool mining efforts. Review articles are not
    appropriate sources for research tool extraction because they:
    1. Do not report original experimental work
    2. Lack Methods sections describing tool usage
    3. Only cite or discuss tools used in other studies
    4. Do not provide the experimental context needed for tool validation
    
    The mining algorithm correctly identified zero tools from this publication. Future
    mining efforts should consider filtering out review articles at the publication
    classification stage to improve efficiency and reduce false positive rates.
    
    No manual curator review is needed - the absence of mined tools is appropriate
    for this publication type.
