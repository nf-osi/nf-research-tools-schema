  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on publication type (Questionnaire/Survey Development):
    - Clinical assessment tools: The study is specifically about translating and validating the PlexiQoL questionnaire
    - Computational tools: Statistical analysis tools mentioned (Cronbach's alpha, Spearman correlation, Mann-Whitney U tests)
    - Additional clinical assessment tools: Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) used as comparator questionnaire
    
    This type of study typically involves:
    1. The primary tool being developed/validated (PlexiQoL)
    2. Comparator/reference tools for validation (NHP)
    3. Statistical software for psychometric analysis
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a questionnaire translation and validation study, which inherently involves clinical assessment tools.
    The study focuses on adapting the PlexiQoL questionnaire for Dutch patients with NF1-associated plexiform neurofibromas.
    Such studies typically contain multiple clinical assessment tools (the primary tool being validated and comparator tools)
    plus computational tools for statistical analysis. The mining process appears to have missed these obvious tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Mining completely failed to detect obvious clinical assessment tools in a questionnaire validation study
    - The primary tool being studied (PlexiQoL) was not detected despite being explicitly described as a "patient-reported outcome measure"
    - Comparator tool (Nottingham Health Profile/NHP) was missed despite clear identification as a "questionnaire"
    - Statistical analysis tools commonly used in validation studies were not captured
    - This represents a significant gap in clinical assessment tool detection patterns
  recommendations: |
    This publication should have detected multiple tools, particularly clinical assessment tools:
    1. PlexiQoL questionnaire (primary tool being validated) - DEFINITELY should be added
    2. Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) - DEFINITELY should be added as comparator tool
    3. Statistical tools (Cronbach's alpha, Spearman correlation, Mann-Whitney U) - CONSIDER adding as computational tools
    
    The mining patterns need significant improvement for clinical assessment tools, especially:
    - Disease-specific questionnaire names (PlexiQoL, etc.)
    - Patient-reported outcome measures terminology
    - Comparator questionnaire detection
    - Quality of life instrument patterns
    
    This case highlights the need for better clinical assessment tool detection in questionnaire development/validation studies.
    No observations could be extracted since no tools were validated, but the Results section (if available) would likely contain
    psychometric properties and validation statistics that could be valuable observations.
