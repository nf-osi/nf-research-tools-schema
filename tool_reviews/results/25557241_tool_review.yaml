  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on publication type (Clinical Study with extensive genetic testing methodology):
    - Computational tools → Statistical software, bioinformatics tools for genetic analysis
    - Genetic reagents → PCR reagents, molecular markers, sequencing techniques
    - Clinical assessment tools → Diagnostic criteria, outcome measures for NF1
    
    This is a retrospective clinical study examining preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) outcomes.
    The extensive Methods section describes molecular techniques, statistical analyses, and clinical
    assessments that would typically involve multiple research tools across categories.
  overallAssessment: |
    This clinical research study would typically use multiple research tools including computational
    tools for statistical analysis and genetic data processing, genetic reagents for molecular
    testing procedures, and clinical assessment tools for NF1 diagnosis and outcome evaluation.
    The extensive methodology suggests significant tool usage that was not captured in mining.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    Major issues identified during review:
    - No tools were mined from this publication despite extensive methodology describing multiple research tools
    - Publication contains detailed Methods section with clear tool usage across multiple categories
    - Mining system failed to capture computational tools (R, statistical tests, specialized software)
    - Genetic reagents and molecular techniques not recognized (PCR, STR markers, commercial kits)
    - Clinical assessment tools missed (diagnostic criteria, classification systems, guidelines)
    - This represents a significant failure of the mining system for clinical research publications
  recommendations: |
    Strong recommendations for this publication:
    - All 12 potentially missed tools should be added to the database
    - This publication demonstrates major gaps in mining patterns for clinical research
    - Mining system needs enhancement for:
      * Statistical software and methods (R, Fisher's exact test, etc.)
      * Molecular biology reagents and techniques (PCR, STR markers, commercial kits)
      * Clinical assessment tools (diagnostic criteria, classification systems)
      * Specialized bioinformatics databases and software
    - Suggested patterns should be implemented to improve future mining accuracy
    - This publication type (clinical genetic research) requires specialized mining approaches
    - Consider manual curation for similar high-methodology clinical publications
