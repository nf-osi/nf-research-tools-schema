  title: "Miniaturized handheld confocal microscopy identifies focal brain invasion in a mouse model of aggressive meningioma."
  queryType: "bench"
  publicationType: "Lab Research"
  publicationTypeConfidence: 0.9
  hasMethodsSection: No
  likelyContainsTools: Yes
  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on the publication type (Lab Research) and content analysis, expected tool types include:
    - Animal models (mouse models for meningioma research)
    - Computational tools (confocal imaging devices/software)
    - Potentially patient-derived models (xenograft models mentioned)
    
    This is clearly a laboratory research study involving mouse models and imaging technology.
    The study tests imaging devices on mouse models of meningioma, which indicates both
    animal models and computational/imaging tools should be present.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research publication that describes testing handheld confocal microscopy
    devices on mouse models of meningioma. The study clearly involves experimental animal models
    and imaging technology, making it highly likely to contain research tools. Despite lacking
    a formal Methods section, the abstract describes experimental procedures using specific
    mouse models and imaging devices that should have been detected as research tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    Major issues identified during review:
    - No tools were mined from this publication despite clear evidence of research tool usage
    - The publication describes experimental use of mouse models and imaging devices
    - Mining algorithm failed to detect obvious animal models and computational tools
    - Abstract contains multiple tool references that should have been captured
    - Lack of Methods section may have contributed to missed tools, but abstract contains sufficient information
  recommendations: |
    Strong recommendations for this publication:
    - All 4 potentially missed tools should be added to the database
    - The mining patterns need improvement to capture mouse model terminology
    - Imaging device terminology should be better recognized
    - This represents a significant failure of the mining algorithm for a clear lab research publication
    - The suggested patterns should be implemented to prevent similar misses
    - Despite lacking detailed Methods, the abstract provides clear evidence of tool usage
    - This publication demonstrates the need for better pattern recognition for animal models and imaging tools
