    This publication describes the Drug-Target Explorer web application for exploring drug-target relationships.
    As a computational tool development paper, expected tool types include:
    - Computational tools (primary: Drug-Target Explorer web application)
    - Web applications/databases (the main deliverable)
    - Supporting software libraries and frameworks used in development
    - Databases integrated for drug-target interaction data
    - Potentially comparison tools used for validation
    
    Tool development papers typically contain the main tool plus supporting technologies used in implementation.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication describes the development of the Drug-Target Explorer web application for drug-target
    relationship exploration. As a computational tool development paper, it should contain at minimum the
    primary tool being described. The absence of any detected tools suggests mining patterns may not
    adequately capture web applications or tools with descriptive names like "Explorer".

    CRITICAL MINING FAILURE:
    - The primary computational tool "Drug-Target Explorer" described in this publication was completely missed
    - This represents a 100% failure rate for a tool development paper where the main tool should always be detected
    - Tool development papers are high-priority targets that should have near-perfect detection rates
    - Missing the primary tool suggests significant gaps in computational tool naming patterns
    - The term "Explorer" appears to be poorly covered in current mining patterns
  recommendations: |
    IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:
    1. MANUALLY ADD "Drug-Target Explorer" as a computational tool to the database
    2. IMPLEMENT all suggested patterns to capture "Explorer" and similar descriptive tool names
    3. CONDUCT systematic review of other publications that may have similar missed computational tools
    4. PRIORITIZE pattern development for tool development papers (should achieve >95% detection rate)
    5. FULL MANUAL REVIEW of this publication is essential to extract complete tool information
    
    SYSTEMIC IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:
    - Expand computational tool patterns beyond standard software naming conventions
    - Include descriptive tool names (Explorer, Analyzer, Viewer, Browser, etc.)
    - Improve detection of tools mentioned in titles and abstracts of development papers
    - Consider publication type context when applying mining patterns
    
    This case represents a critical failure that undermines confidence in the mining system's ability
    to detect computational tools with non-standard naming conventions. Immediate pattern updates
    and systematic review are essential to prevent similar failures.
