    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a comprehensive forward genetic screen using transgenic mouse models, cell culture, 
    molecular biology techniques, and computational analysis. Expected tools include:
    - Animal models (transgenic mice with multiple alleles)
    - Cell lines (human MPNST cell lines, immortalized Schwann cells)
    - Genetic reagents (transposons, plasmids, TALENs)
    - Antibodies (for immunohistochemistry and Western blot)
    - Computational tools (for genomic analysis, statistics)
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a sophisticated lab research study combining forward genetic screening, mouse models, 
    cell culture, and genomic analysis. The comprehensive Methods section describes extensive 
    experimental procedures that would require numerous research tools across multiple categories.
    Tools are definitely expected and likely to be both developed and used experimentally.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Extensive use of specialized transgenic mouse models, cell lines, antibodies, and genetic reagents
    - Complex nomenclature for transgenic alleles and MPNST cell lines not caught by standard patterns
    - Multiple antibodies with vendor information not recognized
    - Sophisticated genetic engineering tools (TALENs, transposons) missed
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous high-quality research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The study uses sophisticated transgenic mouse models, multiple human MPNST cell lines, specific antibodies,
    and advanced genetic engineering tools. All 19 potentially missed tools should be added to improve coverage
    of NF research tools. The suggested patterns would significantly improve detection of transgenic mouse strains,
    MPNST cell lines, and genetic engineering reagents. Manual curator review is recommended to validate the
    complex transgenic mouse nomenclature and ensure proper categorization of the genetic reagents.
