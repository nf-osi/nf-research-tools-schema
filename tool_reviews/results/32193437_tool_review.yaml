  hasMethodsSection: Yes
  likelyContainsTools: Yes
  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on publication type (Lab Research), expected tool categories include:
    - Animal models (primary focus - NF1+/ex42del minipig model)
    - Computational tools (imaging analysis software like 3D Slicer, statistical analysis)
    - Genetic reagents (potentially antibodies for immunohistochemistry)
    - Clinical assessment tools (potentially imaging protocols, measurement criteria)
    
    This is a longitudinal animal model study with extensive imaging, histopathology, and quantitative analysis.
    The publication describes development and characterization of a large animal model with systematic
    phenotyping using clinical imaging modalities. Multiple tool types are expected across different categories.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive lab research study that extensively uses research tools across multiple categories.
    The study involves a genetically modified minipig model (NF1+/ex42del), sophisticated imaging protocols,
    computational analysis software, and histopathological techniques. The systematic longitudinal design
    with quantitative measurements strongly indicates extensive tool usage that should have been captured.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    Critical mining failure - no tools were extracted from a publication rich in research tools:
    - Primary animal model (NF1+/ex42del minipig) completely missed despite being central to the study
    - Computational analysis software (3D Slicer with URL) not detected
    - Clinical assessment tools (WHO criteria) not captured
    - Immunohistochemistry reagents (S100) not identified
    - Statistical analysis methods not recognized
    - Large animal model terminology patterns not covered
    - Equipment/instrument naming conventions need improvement
  recommendations: |
    URGENT: Complete overhaul of mining patterns needed for this publication type:
    1. All 11 potentially missed tools should be added, with highest priority for the NF1+/ex42del minipig model
    2. Implement suggested patterns for genetic nomenclature, large animal models, and equipment naming
    3. Add context phrases for immunohistochemistry and clinical assessment tools
    4. The 7 new patterns suggested would significantly improve coverage for similar publications
    5. This represents a major gap in mining effectiveness for animal model research
    6. Seven high-quality scientific observations were successfully extracted from validated tools
    7. Future mining should prioritize animal model terminology and genetic nomenclature patterns
