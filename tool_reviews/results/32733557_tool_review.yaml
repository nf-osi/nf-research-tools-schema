    Bioinformatics Analysis → computational tools (software, pipelines, databases, web applications)
    This study performs gene expression analysis, pathway enrichment, network analysis, and drug discovery
    using multiple computational tools and databases. Expected tools include:
    - Analysis software (GEO2R, DAVID, STRING, Cytoscape)
    - Databases (GEO, KEGG, DGIdb)
    - Statistical analysis software (SPSS)
    - Bioinformatics pipelines and plugins (MCODE, CentiScaPe)
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a computational bioinformatics study that analyzes gene expression data to identify therapeutic targets.
    The study extensively uses computational tools, databases, and software for data analysis, making it highly
    likely to contain research tools. The Methods section describes detailed computational workflows using
    multiple bioinformatics platforms and analysis tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining failed to capture any computational tools despite this being a pure bioinformatics study
    - Multiple well-known bioinformatics tools, databases, and software platforms were missed
    - Tools with version numbers and URLs were not detected
    - Cytoscape plugins (MCODE, CentiScaPe) were not recognized
    - Statistical software (SPSS) was not captured
  recommendations: |
    All 8 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine computational research tools
    used in this bioinformatics analysis. The mining patterns need significant improvement for:
    - Bioinformatics databases and web tools (GEO2R, DAVID, STRING, DGIdb)
    - Network analysis software and plugins (Cytoscape, MCODE, CentiScaPe)
    - Software with version numbers and URLs
    This publication demonstrates gaps in computational tool detection that should be addressed
    to improve coverage of bioinformatics studies.
