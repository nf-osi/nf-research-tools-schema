  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on publication type (Bioinformatics Analysis):
    - Computational tools (software, databases, web tools, analysis pipelines) - HIGHLY EXPECTED
    - Genetic reagents (primers for qPCR validation) - POSSIBLE
    - Lab tools are unlikely since this is primarily computational analysis
    - Clinical assessment tools are not expected for this type of study
    
    This is a computational study analyzing gene expression data, so multiple bioinformatics
    tools, databases, and software packages should be present throughout the methods.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a bioinformatics analysis study that should contain numerous computational tools.
    The study uses microarray data analysis, gene expression profiling, pathway enrichment,
    protein-protein interaction network analysis, and drug discovery databases. Multiple
    software tools, web platforms, and databases are explicitly mentioned in the methods
    section and should have been captured by the mining system.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    Critical mining failure - this bioinformatics analysis publication contains numerous computational 
    tools that were completely missed:
    - Multiple databases (DAVID, STRING, DGIdb, GEO, ClinicalTrials.gov)
    - Analysis software (Cytoscape, SPSS, GEO2R)
    - Specialized plugins (MCODE, CentiScaPe)
    - qPCR reagents (SYBR premix products)
    - All tools have clear usage context and version/vendor information
    - This represents a systematic failure to capture computational tools in bioinformatics studies
  recommendations: |
    URGENT: The mining system failed to capture any tools from a publication rich in computational resources.
    This indicates major gaps in computational tool detection patterns. All 13 missed tools should be added:
    
    HIGH PRIORITY ADDITIONS:
    - DAVID, STRING, Cytoscape, SPSS, GEO2R, DGIdb (core bioinformatics tools)
    - MCODE, CentiScaPe (analysis plugins)
    - Gene Expression Omnibus (major database)
    - SYBR reagents (genetic reagents with vendor info)
    
    PATTERN IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:
    - Better detection of "was used to" phrases
    - Software version patterns (Version X.X)
    - Database URLs and identifiers (GSE, GPL numbers)
    - Vendor information patterns for reagents
    
    This publication demonstrates the mining system needs significant enhancement for computational tool detection.
    The suggested patterns would dramatically improve capture rates for bioinformatics studies.
