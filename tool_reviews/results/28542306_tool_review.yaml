  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on publication type (Bioinformatics Analysis):
    - Computational tools (software, packages, pipelines) - EXPECTED
    - Potentially genetic reagents if analyzing specific datasets
    - Lab tools unlikely as this is purely computational meta-analysis
    - Clinical assessment tools unlikely as this focuses on gene expression

    This is a meta-analysis integrating genomic data from public databases (GEO, ArrayExpress)
    using computational methods. Should contain multiple bioinformatics tools and software packages.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a computational meta-analysis study that integrates gene expression data from multiple
    microarray studies to identify biomarkers for neurofibroma-to-MPNST transformation. The study
    extensively uses bioinformatics tools and software packages for data processing, statistical
    analysis, and visualization. Given the computational nature and detailed Methods section,
    multiple computational tools should be present but were apparently missed by the mining process.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: No tools were mined despite this being a computational study with extensive tool usage
    - Multiple computational tools clearly mentioned in Methods section were missed
    - Mining patterns appear inadequate for bioinformatics/computational tools
    - Standard R/Bioconductor environment and packages not detected
    - Software with version numbers not caught (PANTHER v.10, MeV v.4.9)
    - Specialized bioinformatics tools (NFFinder, EnrichNet, SOTA) not recognized
  recommendations: |
    - ALL 10 potentially missed tools should be added to the mining results
    - This represents a significant failure of the computational tool mining patterns
    - The 6 suggested patterns should be implemented to catch similar tools in future mining
    - Focus on improving detection of:
      * R packages and Bioconductor tools
      * Software with version numbers
      * Bioinformatics analysis tools
      * Statistical functions and methods
    - Consider separate mining strategies for different publication types (lab vs computational)
    - This publication demonstrates the need for better computational tool pattern coverage
