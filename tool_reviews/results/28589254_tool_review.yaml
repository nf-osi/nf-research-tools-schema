  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on publication type (Clinical Study with quantitative imaging analysis):
    - Computational tools → Expected for image analysis, statistical analysis, and data processing
    - Clinical assessment tools → Unlikely (study uses imaging parameters, not patient-reported outcomes)
    - Lab research tools → Unlikely (no laboratory experiments described)
    
    This is a retrospective clinical imaging study using PET/CT scans to differentiate tumor types.
    The study involves computational analysis of imaging data using specialized software for texture
    analysis and statistical evaluation. While queryType suggests "bench" research, the actual
    content is clinical imaging research with computational analysis components.
  overallAssessment: |
    This clinical imaging study would be expected to use computational tools for image analysis
    and statistical processing, which it does. The study uses MATLAB for texture analysis and
    statistical software (SPSS, MedCalc) for data analysis. No clinical assessment tools are
    expected since the study relies on imaging parameters rather than patient-reported outcomes.
    The "bench" queryType appears to be a misclassification - this is clinical research.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining completely missed all computational tools used in this study
    - Three clear computational tools (MATLAB, SPSS, MedCalc) with version numbers and vendor information were not detected
    - QueryType "bench" is misleading - this is clinical imaging research, not bench research
    - Mining patterns appear inadequate for detecting statistical software and analysis platforms
  recommendations: |
    All three missed computational tools should be added to the database:
    1. MATLAB (Release 2016a) - Used for custom texture analysis software implementation
    2. SPSS (v22) - Used for comprehensive statistical analysis
    3. MedCalc (v16.8.4) - Used for ROC analysis and medical statistics
    
    The suggested patterns would significantly improve detection of computational tools in medical research.
    This publication demonstrates that clinical studies often use sophisticated computational tools for
    data analysis that should be captured. The mining system needs better coverage of statistical
    software and analysis platforms commonly used in medical research.
    
    Three usage instruction observations were extracted describing how each tool was employed in the study.
    This type of clinical imaging study represents an important category that uses computational tools
    extensively but may be missed by current mining approaches focused on traditional lab tools.
