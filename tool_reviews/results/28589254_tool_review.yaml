    Clinical Study → clinical assessment tools, computational tools for analysis
    This is an imaging-based clinical study using 18F-FDG PET/CT to differentiate benign from malignant tumors in NF1 patients.
    Expected tools include:
    - Computational tools for image analysis and texture analysis (MATLAB mentioned)
    - Statistical software for data analysis (SPSS, MedCalc mentioned)
    - Clinical imaging protocols and assessment methods
    - Potentially clinical assessment tools for patient evaluation
  overallAssessment: |
    This clinical imaging study analyzes PET/CT data from 54 NF1 patients to differentiate benign from malignant tumors using texture analysis.
    The study uses computational tools for image processing and statistical analysis, making it likely to contain research tools.
    While primarily a clinical study, it involves sophisticated image analysis methods that qualify as computational research tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite clear computational and clinical tools being present
    - MATLAB with custom texture analysis software implementation was missed
    - Specialized medical statistics software (MedCalc) was missed
    - Clinical imaging protocols and equipment were not captured
    - The mining appears to have missed tools that are clearly described in the Methods section
  recommendations: |
    Several important tools were missed in the initial mining:
    - MATLAB (Release 2016a) should be added as it's used for custom texture analysis software
    - MedCalc (v16.8.4) should be added as specialized medical statistics software
    - The standardized 18F-FDG PET/CT protocol for NF1 patients should be considered as a clinical assessment tool
    - Consider whether specific imaging equipment (Discovery VCT/DST scanners) qualify as clinical assessment tools
    - The mining patterns need improvement to capture computational tools used in clinical imaging studies
    - No scientific observations were extracted as no tools were initially validated, but the Results section contains quantitative findings about imaging parameters
