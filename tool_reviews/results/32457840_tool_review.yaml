    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This publication involves extensive molecular biology and cell biology experiments including western blotting,
    immunofluorescence, siRNA knockdown, cell culture, and functional assays. Expected tools include antibodies
    for western blot and immunofluorescence, multiple cancer cell lines, siRNA reagents, and potentially
    computational tools for data analysis.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study investigating TGFβ signaling in pancreatic cancer cells.
    The extensive Methods section describes multiple experimental techniques requiring numerous research tools
    including antibodies, cell lines, siRNA reagents, and specialized equipment. The study would be expected
    to contain many validated research tools across multiple categories.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple standard research tools were missed including cell lines, antibodies, and siRNA reagents
    - The mining patterns appear to be missing common naming conventions for cancer cell lines
    - NF2/Merlin-related tools were missed despite being directly relevant to NF research
    - Antibody naming patterns with anti- prefix were not captured
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous legitimate research tools that were completely missed by the initial mining.
    The 11 potentially missed tools should all be added as they represent standard laboratory reagents with
    clear experimental usage context. The suggested patterns would significantly improve mining accuracy for
    similar publications. No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated, but this
    study likely contains valuable phenotypic and functional data that could be captured once tools are properly identified.
