  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study investigating MEK inhibitor resistance mechanisms in MPNST.
    Expected tool types include:
    - Cell lines (multiple human MPNST cell lines mentioned)
    - Animal models (SCID mice for xenograft studies)
    - Genetic reagents (CRISPR/Cas9 constructs, plasmids)
    - Computational tools (GraphPad Prism, Image Studio Lite, etc.)
    - Patient-derived models (PDX models explicitly mentioned)
    
    The publication has extensive Methods section describing experimental procedures using multiple tool categories.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication is a comprehensive laboratory research study with extensive experimental methods including cell culture,
    animal studies, genetic manipulations, and computational analysis. The study clearly uses multiple categories of research
    tools and should contain numerous valid tool mentions. The fact that no tools were mined suggests a significant failure
    in the mining process, as this publication contains abundant tool usage throughout the Methods section.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: No tools were mined from this publication despite extensive tool usage throughout
    - This is a comprehensive laboratory research study with detailed Methods section
    - Multiple cell lines with RRID identifiers were not detected
    - Animal models with vendor information and RRIDs were missed
    - Genetic reagents (CRISPR vectors, plasmids) with Addgene IDs were not captured
    - Computational tools with software versions and RRIDs were overlooked
    - Patient-derived xenograft models explicitly mentioned were not found
    - The mining system appears to have completely failed for this publication
  recommendations: |
    - URGENT: Investigate why no tools were detected in this tool-rich publication
    - Implement patterns for RRID identifiers as strong tool indicators
    - Add cell line naming convention patterns (alphanumeric combinations)
    - Include genetic reagent patterns for common vectors (Lenti-, psPAX2, pVSV-G)
    - Add PDX model detection patterns
    - Implement software detection with version numbers and RRIDs
    - This publication should serve as a test case for mining system validation
    - All 20 missed tools should be added to improve future mining accuracy
    - The extracted observations demonstrate the scientific value of these tools
