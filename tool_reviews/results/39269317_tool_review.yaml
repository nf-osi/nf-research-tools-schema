  majorIssuesFound: |
    - INPUT FILE NOT FOUND: The file 39269317_input.json does not exist in the inputs directory
    - Cannot perform tool validation without publication metadata, abstract, full text, and mined tools list
    - Comprehensive repository search found no traces of PMID 39269317
    - This suggests the publication was not processed through the mining pipeline
  recommendations: |
    CRITICAL: Cannot validate tools for publication 39269317 because:
    1. The input file is missing from the repository
    2. No publication metadata, abstract, or full text is available
    3. No mined tools list exists to validate
    
    NEXT STEPS:
    1. Verify that PMID 39269317 is a valid PubMed ID
    2. Check if the publication should be processed through the mining pipeline
    3. If the publication exists, regenerate the input file with proper metadata and text extraction
    4. Re-run the tool mining process to identify potential research tools
    5. Then perform tool validation review
    
    Without the input file, no meaningful tool validation can be performed.
