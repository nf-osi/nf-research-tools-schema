  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a comprehensive proteomics study using primary human tumor cells and cell lines.
    Expected tool types include:
    - Cell lines (Ben-Men-1, HMC, primary schwannoma/meningioma cells)
    - Antibodies (for Western blot, immunofluorescence)
    - Genetic reagents (shRNA constructs, lentiviral vectors)
    - Computational tools (MaxQuant, Perseus, DAVID, String.db)
    - Laboratory reagents and kits (phospho-protein purification kit, BCA assay)
    
    This publication contains extensive experimental methods and should have numerous tools
    across multiple categories, particularly computational tools for proteomics analysis.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a high-quality lab research publication with extensive Methods section describing
    proteomics experiments, cell culture, Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and gene
    silencing. The study uses multiple cell lines, antibodies, computational tools, and
    genetic reagents. The fact that zero tools were mined indicates major gaps in mining
    patterns, particularly for computational tools and antibodies.

      Clone 5 was most successful in knocking down PDLIM2. Lentiviral particles were applied
      for 24h with 5 μg/ml polybrene, followed by puromycin selection at 5 μg/ml for 4-5 days.
      Successful knockdown confirmed by Western blot analysis and resulted in significant

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Zero tools were mined from a comprehensive proteomics study that contains numerous research tools
    - Missing computational tools: MaxQuant, Perseus, DAVID, String.db - all essential proteomics software
    - Missing antibodies: Multiple antibodies with vendor/dilution info clearly stated in methods
    - Missing cell lines: Ben-Men-1, HMC with vendor information
    - Missing genetic reagents: shRNA vectors, commercial kits, assays
    - Missing laboratory instruments: Mass spectrometers, microscopes, UPLC systems
  recommendations: |
    URGENT: This publication demonstrates major gaps in mining patterns, particularly for:
    1. Computational tools - proteomics software (MaxQuant, Perseus), bioinformatics tools (DAVID, String.db)
    2. Antibodies - patterns should catch antibody names with dilutions and vendor info
    3. Cell lines - standard nomenclature (Ben-Men-1, HMC) and vendor sourcing
    4. Genetic reagents - commercial kits, assays, plasmid vectors
    5. Laboratory instruments - mass spectrometers, microscopes, analytical equipment
    
    All 15 potentially missed tools should be added to improve mining coverage.
    The suggested patterns would significantly improve tool detection in proteomics studies.
    This type of comprehensive lab research publication should yield 15-20+ tools, not zero.
    
    Scientific observations were successfully extracted for 6 tools, demonstrating the value
    of these resources for the research community.
