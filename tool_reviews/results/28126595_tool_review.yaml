    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a comprehensive proteomics study using primary human tumor cells, requiring multiple tool types:
    - Cell lines (primary meningioma/schwannoma cells, control cells)
    - Antibodies (for Western blot, immunofluorescence)
    - Genetic reagents (shRNA constructs for knockdown)
    - Computational tools (mass spectrometry analysis software)
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study involving proteomics analysis of primary human tumor cells with extensive experimental methods. The study uses cell culture, mass spectrometry, Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and genetic knockdown experiments, indicating high likelihood of containing multiple research tools. Clinical assessment tools are not expected as this is purely bench research focused on molecular mechanisms.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining failed to capture any tools despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple antibodies with vendor information and dilutions were missed
    - Cell lines including commercial and established lines were not detected
    - Genetic reagents (shRNA constructs with sequences) were not captured
    - Computational tools for proteomics analysis were missed
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous research tools that were completely missed by initial mining. The study uses:
    - Multiple antibodies from major vendors (Cell Signaling, Santa Cruz, Millipore)
    - Cell lines (HMC from Sciencell, Ben-Men-1)
    - Genetic reagents (shRNA constructs with full sequences)
    - Computational tools (MaxQuant, Perseus, DAVID)
    All missed tools should be added as they represent genuine research tools used in experiments. The mining patterns need significant improvement to capture vendor-antibody associations, cell line naming conventions, and proteomics software tools.
