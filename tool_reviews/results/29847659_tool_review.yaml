  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Extensive Methods section contains numerous research tools that should have been detected
    - Missing detection of standard mouse strain nomenclature (Nf1+/-, Nf1flox/flox)
    - Commercial cell lines with vendor information not captured
    - Antibodies with catalog numbers not detected
    - Genetic reagents (shRNA vectors) with catalog numbers missed
    - Image analysis software and specialized macros not found
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous high-quality research tools that were completely missed by initial mining. The tools include:
    - Multiple mouse strains with proper nomenclature and source information
    - Commercial cell lines from reputable vendors
    - Antibodies with catalog numbers and vendors
    - Genetic reagents (shRNA) with detailed sourcing
    - Computational tools for image analysis
    All 15 potentially missed tools should be added to improve mining coverage. The suggested patterns would significantly improve detection of similar tools in future publications. This represents a major gap in the current mining approach for laboratory research publications.
