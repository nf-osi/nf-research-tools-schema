  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on the publication type (Lab Research) and topic (MET and MEK inhibition in MPNST), 
    expected tool categories include:
    - Genetic reagents (MET inhibitors, MEK inhibitors, small molecule compounds)
    - Cell lines (MPNST cell lines, cancer cell lines, control cell lines)
    - Computational tools (statistical analysis software, data analysis tools)
    - Animal models (xenograft models, mouse models for cancer research)
    - Antibodies (for Western blot, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry)
    - Advanced cellular models (potentially organoids or 3D culture systems)
    - Patient-derived models (PDX models, patient-derived cell lines)
    
    This is a laboratory research study investigating targeted therapy for neurofibromatosis-related
    cancer, which typically requires extensive research infrastructure including cell culture systems,
    pharmacological agents, analytical methods, and model systems. The complete absence of mined
    tools is highly suspicious and strongly suggests systematic mining deficiencies.
  overallAssessment: |
    This laboratory research publication on targeted cancer therapy would be expected to use
    numerous research tools across multiple categories. Publications investigating MET and MEK
    inhibition in cancer typically employ specific inhibitor compounds, cancer cell line models,
    analytical software, and often animal models. The complete absence of mined tools strongly
    suggests mining system failure rather than a genuine lack of tools.

    CRITICAL MINING SYSTEM FAILURE:
    - Laboratory research publication on targeted cancer therapy with ZERO tools detected
    - This represents a complete mining system failure for this publication type
    - Expected 10-20 research tools across multiple categories (inhibitors, cell lines, software, models)
    - Publication about MET/MEK inhibition would typically use specific compounds, cancer cell lines, analytical methods
    - Absence suggests systematic gaps in pattern coverage for pharmacological research
    - Need immediate manual curator review and pattern enhancement
  recommendations: |
    URGENT ACTION REQUIRED - Complete mining system failure detected:
    
    Immediate actions:
    1. MANUAL CURATOR REVIEW REQUIRED - This publication needs complete manual tool extraction
    2. Add patterns for generic inhibitor compound terminology (MET inhibitor, MEK inhibitor, etc.)
    3. Improve detection of cancer cell line descriptions beyond specific nomenclature
    4. Add context-based patterns for pharmacological treatment phrases
    5. Enhance patterns for statistical/analysis software detection
    6. Add patterns for xenograft and animal model mentions
    7. Consider patterns for antibody usage in Western blot/immunohistochemistry contexts
    
    System improvements needed:
    - This publication likely contains 10-20 research tools that were completely missed
    - The mining system appears to have systematic blind spots for targeted therapy research
    - Pattern coverage for pharmacological research is inadequate
    - Need comprehensive review of inhibitor compound detection patterns
    - Consider adding vendor/catalog number detection for better tool identification
    
    Quality assurance:
    - Publications with zero detected tools from lab research should trigger automatic manual review
    - Implement quality checks for publication types vs. expected tool counts
    - This case demonstrates need for publication type-specific mining validation
