  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a comprehensive genomics study that should contain multiple tool types:
    - Computational tools (bioinformatics software, analysis pipelines, R packages)
    - Genetic reagents (sequencing libraries, capture reagents)
    - Potentially animal models (mentioned in introduction but not used in this study)
    
    The study performs whole exome sequencing, RNA sequencing, copy number analysis, and extensive
    bioinformatics analysis, which requires numerous computational tools and software packages.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a high-quality laboratory research study performing multi-omics analysis of tumor samples.
    The publication has extensive Methods sections describing sequencing protocols and bioinformatics
    analysis workflows. Multiple computational tools, software packages, and analysis pipelines should
    be present. The lack of any mined tools suggests significant gaps in the mining process for this
    type of genomics research.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: No tools were mined from this comprehensive genomics study despite extensive computational analysis
    - Mining system completely failed to capture 20+ computational tools explicitly mentioned with usage context
    - Missing all bioinformatics software (BWA-MEM, VarScan2, Strelka2, MuTect2, Pindel, manta, VEP, etc.)
    - Missing R packages and analysis platforms (edgeR, gplots, Partek Flow)
    - Missing databases and web tools (COSMIC, ClinVar, CBioPortal, PantherDB, SIFT, PolyPhen)
    - Missing genetic reagents (IDT exome reagent, TrueSeq library kit)
    - This represents a systematic failure to mine computational tools from genomics publications
  recommendations: |
    URGENT: The mining system requires major improvements for computational tool detection:
    
    1. Add patterns for bioinformatics software names (especially those with version numbers)
    2. Improve detection of "analyzed using", "detected using", "performed with" contexts
    3. Add patterns for R packages (especially "[name] [citation] package" format)
    4. Include database and web tool detection (COSMIC, ClinVar, CBioPortal, etc.)
    5. Add genetic reagent patterns for kits and capture reagents
    6. This publication should be re-processed after pattern improvements
    
    The complete absence of mined tools from this methods-rich genomics study indicates
    fundamental gaps in the mining approach for computational biology publications.
    All 20 missed tools should be added to improve future mining accuracy.
