  title: "Assessment of RAS Dependency for BRAF Alterations Using Cancer Genomic Databases"

  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on publication type (Bioinformatics Analysis):
    - Computational tools (databases, statistical software, analysis pipelines)
    - Possibly clinical assessment tools if patient outcomes measured (but this study focuses on genomic data analysis)
    
    This is a cross-sectional data analysis study using existing cancer genomic databases to assess 
    RAS dependency of BRAF alterations. Expected tools include databases, statistical analysis software,
    and data processing tools. No lab research tools (antibodies, cell lines, animal models) expected
    as this is purely computational analysis of existing datasets.
  overallAssessment: |
    This bioinformatics analysis publication would typically use computational tools including databases,
    statistical software, and data analysis platforms. The study analyzes existing genomic datasets rather
    than generating new experimental data, so lab research tools are not expected. However, several
    computational resources and databases are mentioned that should be considered as research tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were mined from this bioinformatics analysis publication despite clear usage of multiple computational resources
    - Several major cancer genomics databases and tools are mentioned with usage context but were not captured
    - Mining patterns appear to miss database names and computational resources commonly used in genomics research
    - The publication clearly describes using multiple databases and computational tools for analysis
  recommendations: |
    This publication should have captured several computational tools:
    - GENIE, cBioPortal, TCGA, and ACE are all legitimate computational resources used in the analysis
    - The mining patterns need improvement to capture database names and genomics analysis platforms
    - Consider adding patterns for acronym-expansion formats common in scientific literature
    - Database access dates and usage context phrases should trigger tool recognition
    - Future mining should better recognize computational resources in bioinformatics studies
    - No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated, but the missed tools could potentially have usage observations
