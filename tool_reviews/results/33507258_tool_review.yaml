    Bioinformatics Analysis → computational tools (databases, analysis software, statistical tools)
    This study analyzes large genomic datasets from multiple cancer databases (GENIE, cBioPortal, TCGA)
    and performs statistical analysis of gene alteration patterns. Expected tools include:
    - Genomic databases and data repositories
    - Statistical analysis software
    - Data processing pipelines
    - Bioinformatics tools for variant analysis
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a computational genomics study analyzing cancer mutation data from large public databases.
    The study performs statistical analysis of gene alteration co-occurrence patterns across 119,538 cancer samples.
    Computational tools for database access, data processing, and statistical analysis are expected, though specific software tools may not be explicitly named in favor of describing analytical approaches.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a computational genomics study
    - Multiple major genomic databases and computational resources are used but not captured
    - The study relies heavily on public cancer genomics databases (GENIE, cBioPortal, TCGA, COSMIC)
    - Data collection tool (ACE) from Mayo Clinic is mentioned but not mined
    - Mining patterns appear to miss database/repository names that are critical computational resources
  recommendations: |
    All 5 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent legitimate computational resources:
    - GENIE, cBioPortal, and TCGA are major cancer genomics databases essential to this analysis
    - ACE is a data collection/management tool actively used in the study
    - COSMIC is used for variant annotation and filtering
    Mining patterns should be expanded to better capture genomic databases and bioinformatics platforms.
    No observations were extracted as there are no validated tools, and Results/Discussion sections were not provided.
    This publication demonstrates the need for better coverage of computational genomics resources in tool mining.
