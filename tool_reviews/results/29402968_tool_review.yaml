    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This publication involves molecular genetics, functional assays, cell culture, and animal models (zebrafish).
    Expected tools include: cell lines (HEK-293T), genetic reagents (plasmids, expression vectors), 
    animal models (zebrafish), computational tools (sequencing analysis software), and antibodies.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study combining next-generation sequencing with functional validation
    of genetic variants in RASopathies. The comprehensive Methods section describes cell culture,
    transfection, luciferase assays, zebrafish experiments, and molecular cloning, indicating extensive
    use of research tools across multiple categories.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining failed to capture any tools despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple categories of research tools are extensively used but not detected
    - Standard naming conventions for cell lines, software, vectors, and antibodies were missed
    - Commercial kits and reagents with vendor information not captured
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains extensive use of research tools across multiple categories that were
    completely missed by initial mining. The suggested patterns should significantly improve
    detection of cell lines, computational tools, genetic reagents, antibodies, and animal models.
    All 8 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine research tools used
    in the experimental procedures. The mining patterns need substantial improvement to capture
    standard laboratory nomenclature and commercial reagent naming conventions.
