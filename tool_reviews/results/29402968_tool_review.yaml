    This publication combines NGS sequencing with functional analysis using cell culture (HEK-293T cells) 
    and zebrafish embryo models. Expected tools include:
    - Cell lines (HEK-293T cells explicitly mentioned)
    - Animal models (zebrafish embryos for functional validation)
    - Genetic reagents (expression plasmids, reporter constructs)
    - Computational tools (NextGENe software, ImageJ for analysis)
    - Antibodies (anti-DDK antibodies mentioned)
    
    The study involves molecular cloning, transfection, luciferase assays, and morphometric analysis,
    indicating extensive use of research tools across multiple categories.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study that integrates NGS with functional validation.
    The methods section describes extensive experimental procedures including cell culture, molecular
    cloning, transfection assays, and zebrafish embryo injections. Multiple research tools should
    be present across several categories, making this an ideal candidate for tool mining.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Complete failure of tool mining despite extensive experimental methods
    - No tools detected in a publication with comprehensive lab research methodology
    - Multiple categories of tools present but completely missed (cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, antibodies)
    - Standard research tools like HEK-293T cells and zebrafish models not detected
    - Commercial kits and reagents with vendor information not caught
    - Analysis software explicitly mentioned but not identified
  recommendations: |
    This publication represents a major failure of the mining system. Despite containing extensive
    experimental methods with multiple tool categories, zero tools were detected. Key recommendations:
    
    1. IMMEDIATE PATTERN UPDATES NEEDED: Add patterns for HEK-293T, zebrafish/Danio rerio, ImageJ, 
       plasmid naming conventions (p[Name]), and anti-[target] antibodies
    
    2. VENDOR DETECTION: Implement patterns for commercial kits with vendor information in parentheses
    
    3. SOFTWARE DETECTION: Improve detection of analysis software mentioned with "using" or "measured with"
    
    4. CONTEXT ANALYSIS: The mining system should prioritize Methods sections where tool usage is explicit
    
    5. QUALITY CONTROL: This publication should be used as a test case for validating mining improvements
    
    All 13 missed tools should be added to the database. The functional analysis provided rich
    phenotypic observations that were successfully extracted, demonstrating the value of this
    publication for the research community.
