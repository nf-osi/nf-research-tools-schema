  title: "Genetically engineered mouse models shed new light on the pathogenesis of neurofibromatosis type I-related neoplasms of the peripheral nervous system."
  queryType: "bench"  # From PubMed query (hint only)
  publicationType: "Review Article"
  publicationTypeConfidence: 0.95  # Very high confidence - clearly states "In this review, we summarize"
  hasMethodsSection: No
  likelyContainsTools: No
  expectedToolTypes: |
    Review articles typically do not contain actual research tools but rather discuss/cite tools used in other studies.
    This review focuses on genetically engineered mouse models, so it may mention:
    - Animal models (mouse strains) - but likely as citations from other work, not actual usage
    - Genetic reagents - but again, likely cited rather than used
    
    Since this is a review without Methods/Results/Discussion sections, any tool mentions would be
    citations of other researchers' work rather than actual tool usage by the authors.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is clearly a review article that summarizes findings from genetically engineered mouse models
    used by other researchers to study neurofibromatosis type 1. Review articles typically cite tools
    from other studies but do not use tools themselves. The absence of Methods, Results, and Discussion
    sections confirms this is not an experimental study. Any research tools mentioned would be citations
    of other work rather than actual tool usage, making them inappropriate for tool databases that focus
    on experimental usage.

suggestedPatterns:
  - patternType: "context_phrase"
    pattern: "exclude review articles from tool mining"
    toolType: "general"
    examples: ["In this review, we summarize", "review articles typically cite but don't use tools"]
    reasoning: "Review articles cite tools from other studies but don't use them experimentally. Mining tools from reviews creates false positives since the tools aren't actually used by the review authors. A publication type filter could exclude reviews from tool mining entirely."
  - patternType: "term"
    pattern: "require specific strain/model names rather than generic terms"
    toolType: "animal_model"
    examples: ["genetically engineered mouse models", "mouse models"]
    reasoning: "Generic terms like 'mouse models' or 'genetically engineered mouse models' are too broad for tool databases. Only specific strain names (e.g., 'Nf1+/-', 'B6.129-Nf1tm1Tyj') should be captured as they represent actual usable research tools."

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a review article, not experimental research
    - No Methods, Results, or Discussion sections available
    - Only abstract text provided, which contains general references to mouse models
    - Review articles cite tools from other studies but don't use them experimentally
    - Generic terms like "genetically engineered mouse models" are too broad for tool databases
  recommendations: |
    This publication should be excluded from tool mining entirely. As a review article, it discusses
    tools used by other researchers but does not use any tools experimentally. The mining correctly
    identified zero tools, which is the expected result for a review article. 
    
    Recommendations:
    1. Implement publication type filtering to exclude review articles from tool mining
    2. When mining animal models, require specific strain names rather than generic terms
    3. Consider this publication as a negative control case - correctly identified zero tools
    4. No manual curator review needed - the empty result is correct for this publication type
    
    No tools were missed because review articles should not contribute tools to experimental databases.
    The suggested patterns would help prevent similar false positives in future mining efforts.
