  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on publication type (Observational Study/Cohort Profile):
    - Clinical assessment tools → questionnaires, quality of life instruments, neuropsychological tests
    - Computational tools → statistical analysis software for registry data analysis
    
    This is a population-based cohort study that explicitly mentions:
    1. "A questionnaire was completed by 244 of the 629 adult cohort members"
    2. "neuropsychological tests were performed on 103 adult cohort members"
    3. "evaluate the psychosocial and emotional burden"
    4. "impaired quality of life"
    
    These indicate use of validated clinical assessment instruments, even though specific tool names
    are not provided in the abstract. The study design suggests registry-based analysis which would
    also require computational tools for data processing and statistical analysis.
  overallAssessment: |
    This cohort profile study would typically use clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, neuropsychological 
    tests, quality of life instruments) and computational tools for statistical analysis of registry data. 
    However, the abstract only provides general descriptions without naming specific validated instruments, 
    which explains why no tools were mined. The study design strongly suggests tool usage that wasn't captured.

    whyMissed: "Generic term 'questionnaire' used instead of specific validated instrument name. Mining patterns likely look for specific tool names rather than generic descriptors."

    contextSnippet: "Further, neuropsychological tests were performed on 103 adult cohort members with NF1 and 38 adult population comparisons."
    whyMissed: "Generic term 'neuropsychological tests' used instead of specific test names (e.g., WAIS-IV, WISC-V, etc.). Mining patterns likely require specific instrument names."

    contextSnippet: "Finally, adults with NF1 had an impaired quality of life and a high need for professional support for physical, psychological and work-related problems"
    whyMissed: "Generic phrase 'quality of life' mentioned without specific instrument name. Could be SF-36, EQ-5D, WHOQOL-BREF, or other validated QoL instruments."

suggestedPatterns:
  - patternType: "context_phrase"
    pattern: "questionnaire was completed by"
    toolType: "clinical_assessment_tool"
    examples: ["A questionnaire was completed by 244 of the 629 adult cohort members"]
    reasoning: "This phrase indicates administration of a questionnaire/survey instrument to study participants, suggesting use of a clinical assessment tool even when specific instrument name isn't provided."
  - patternType: "context_phrase"
    pattern: "neuropsychological tests were performed"
    toolType: "clinical_assessment_tool"
    examples: ["neuropsychological tests were performed on 103 adult cohort members"]
    reasoning: "This phrase strongly indicates use of standardized neuropsychological assessment instruments, even when specific test names aren't mentioned in the abstract."
  - patternType: "context_phrase"
    pattern: "to evaluate the psychosocial and emotional burden"
    toolType: "clinical_assessment_tool"
    examples: ["questionnaire was completed... to evaluate the psychosocial and emotional burden"]
    reasoning: "This context suggests use of validated psychosocial assessment instruments, which are important clinical tools for measuring patient-reported outcomes."
  - patternType: "term"
    pattern: "cohort profile"
    toolType: "general"
    examples: ["Cohort profile: life with neurofibromatosis 1"]
    reasoning: "Cohort profile studies typically describe methodology and tools used in large epidemiological studies. These publications often contain clinical assessment tools that may not be explicitly named in abstracts but are detailed in full methods sections."

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were mined from this publication despite clear evidence of clinical assessment tool usage
    - Only abstract available - full Methods section would likely contain specific instrument names
    - Generic terminology used ("questionnaire", "neuropsychological tests") instead of specific validated instrument names
    - This represents a common challenge in mining clinical assessment tools from abstracts vs full text
  recommendations: |
    This publication clearly describes use of clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, neuropsychological tests, 
    quality of life measures) but uses generic terminology rather than specific instrument names in the abstract. 
    The mining system should be enhanced to:
    1. Recognize generic clinical assessment contexts that likely involve validated instruments
    2. Flag cohort profile studies for manual review as they often contain detailed methodology
    3. Prioritize full-text analysis for observational studies mentioning patient assessments
    4. Consider adding context-based patterns for clinical tool usage even when specific names aren't provided
    
    No tools need to be rejected since none were mined, but this publication represents a missed opportunity 
    to capture clinical assessment tools that were likely used but not specifically named in the abstract.
