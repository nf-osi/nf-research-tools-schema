  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on publication type (Lab Research - genetically engineered mouse model development):
    - Animal models (primary focus - genetically engineered mice)
    - Genetic reagents (Cre-lox system, promoter elements, floxed alleles)
    - Clinical assessment tools (functional testing methods for hearing/balance)
    - Potentially computational tools (data analysis, though not evident from abstract)
    
    This is clearly a laboratory research publication focused on developing and characterizing
    a new mouse model. The abstract describes genetic engineering approaches and functional
    testing methods, indicating multiple tool types should be present.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research publication describing the development and characterization
    of a genetically engineered mouse model for NF2. The study clearly involves creating and
    using research tools including animal models, genetic reagents, and functional assessment
    methods. The absence of full text sections is concerning as it limits comprehensive tool
    detection, but the abstract alone reveals several research tools that should have been mined.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    Critical mining failure identified:
    - No tools were mined from this publication despite clear presence of multiple research tools
    - Publication is laboratory research focused on genetically engineered mouse model development
    - Abstract contains at least 6 clear research tools that should have been detected
    - Missing full text sections (Methods, Results, Discussion) severely limits comprehensive analysis
    - Current mining patterns appear inadequate for complex genetic nomenclature and functional assessment tools
  recommendations: |
    URGENT: Complete mining system failure for this publication
    - All 6 identified tools should be added to the database
    - Implement suggested patterns to capture genetic reagents and mouse model nomenclature
    - Improve coverage of clinical assessment tools used in laboratory research
    - Obtain full text to enable comprehensive tool mining and observation extraction
    - Review mining patterns for complex genetically modified animal models
    - This publication represents a significant gap in current mining capabilities
