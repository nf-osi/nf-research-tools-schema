    This publication describes development of a Cas9 mouse model for meningioma research, involving:
    - Animal models (Cas9 transgenic mice)
    - Genetic reagents (lentiviral and AAV vectors with gRNAs)
    - Cell lines (primary meningeal cells)
    - Antibodies (for immunohistochemistry)
    - Computational tools (for imaging analysis)
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study developing a novel animal model for skull base meningioma using CRISPR/Cas9 technology.
    The study involves extensive experimental procedures including mouse breeding, cell culture, viral vector construction, and in vivo injections.
    Multiple research tools are expected including transgenic mice, viral vectors, primary cell cultures, and antibodies for characterization.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a clear lab research study with extensive experimental methods
    - Multiple research tools are clearly described in the methods section but were missed by the mining algorithm
    - The study involves development of novel animal models and genetic reagents that should be captured
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains multiple legitimate research tools that were completely missed by the initial mining:
    - The Rosa26-LSL-Cas9 transgenic mouse strain is a well-established research tool from Jackson Laboratory
    - Custom viral vectors (pLentiCre/gRNA and pAAVCre/gRNA) are genetic reagents developed for this study
    - Primary meningeal cell cultures represent a cell line tool
    - Multiple antibodies from Abcam are clearly research tools used for immunohistochemistry
    - The Bruker MRI scanner is an imaging tool used for analysis
    All 8 potentially missed tools should be added to improve mining coverage for similar publications.
    The suggested patterns would help capture transgenic mice, primary cell cultures, commercial antibodies, and viral vectors in future mining.
