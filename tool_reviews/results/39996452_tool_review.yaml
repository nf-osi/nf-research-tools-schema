    This publication describes the development of a novel Cas9 mouse model for skull base meningioma
    using genetic engineering approaches. Expected tools include:
    - Animal models (transgenic mice)
    - Genetic reagents (viral vectors, gRNAs, plasmids)
    - Antibodies (for immunohistochemistry)
    - Computational tools (imaging systems, analysis software)
    - Cell culture systems (primary meningeal cells)
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study focused on developing a new animal model using CRISPR/Cas9
    technology. The detailed Methods section describes extensive experimental procedures including
    animal breeding, cell culture, viral vector construction, genetic modification, and histological
    analysis. This type of study would typically use multiple research tools across several categories.
    The absence of any mined tools suggests significant gaps in the mining process.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: No tools were mined from this publication despite it being a clear laboratory research study
    - The publication contains detailed Methods section with extensive experimental procedures
    - Multiple obvious research tools are present including transgenic mice, viral vectors, antibodies, and imaging equipment
    - Mining patterns appear to be missing key nomenclature and context phrases used in genetic engineering research
    - Vendor information (Jackson Laboratory, Abcam) and catalog numbers are present but not detected
    - Custom genetic constructs with standard naming conventions (pLenti, pAAV) were not recognized
  recommendations: |
    - URGENT: Review and expand mining patterns for genetic reagents, especially viral vectors and plasmids
    - Add patterns for Jackson Laboratory mouse strains with catalog numbers
    - Improve antibody detection when mentioned in IHC context without explicit "antibody" suffix
    - Include imaging equipment and scientific instruments in computational tool patterns
    - Consider primary cell cultures as a type of cell line tool
    - Add vendor-specific patterns (Jackson Laboratory, Abcam, etc.) to improve tool detection
    - This publication should have yielded 6-8 validated tools across multiple categories
    - The complete absence of mined tools indicates systematic issues with the mining pipeline
