  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a clear laboratory research study
    - Multiple molecular biology reagents, kits, and equipment mentioned with vendor information
    - Methods section contains detailed protocols indicating extensive tool usage
    - Mining patterns appear to miss standard molecular biology reagents and equipment
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The study uses standard molecular biology techniques with specific reagents, kits, and equipment
    that should be captured. All 7 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent
    legitimate research tools with vendor information and clear experimental usage context.
    The suggested patterns would help capture similar molecular biology tools in future mining.
    No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated.
