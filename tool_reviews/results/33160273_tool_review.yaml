  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Complete failure of mining system to detect any tools despite clear laboratory research publication
    - Multiple obvious research tools present: cell lines with specific names, antibodies with vendors, computational software with versions
    - Cell line nomenclature (ipNF 95.11b, ipn 02.8) not recognized by current patterns
    - Common laboratory software (ImageJ) with version numbers not detected
    - Antibody targets and vendor information not captured
    - Programming languages in active usage context missed
  recommendations: |
    This publication represents a significant mining failure - zero tools were detected despite this being 
    a clear laboratory research study with multiple obvious research tools. The following tools should be added:
    
    CRITICAL ADDITIONS:
    - ipNF 95.11b (NF1 patient-derived Schwann cell line)
    - ipn 02.8 (wild-type Schwann cell line)  
    - s-100b antibody (Sigma)
    - anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Invitrogen)
    - ImageJ v1.53a (computational analysis software)
    
    PATTERN IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:
    - Cell line naming conventions for immortalized lines (ip* prefix)
    - Antibody target detection with vendor information
    - Software version detection for ImageJ and other common tools
    - Programming language usage context detection
    - Vendor attribution patterns for reagents
    
    OBSERVATIONS:
    Six high-quality scientific observations were extracted showing differential behavior between 
    NF1-deficient and wild-type Schwann cells, including morphological differences, proliferation 
    patterns, and growth factor secretion under various stimulation conditions.
    
    This case highlights major gaps in the current mining system that need immediate attention.
