  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on the title focusing on "New Model Systems" for NF1-associated MPNST research, this review article
    would be expected to discuss multiple tool categories:
    - Animal models (NF1 knockout mice, xenograft models for MPNST)
    - Patient-derived models (PDX models, patient-derived cell lines from MPNST)
    - Cell lines (NF1-deficient cell lines, MPNST cell lines)
    - Advanced cellular models (organoids, 3D culture systems)
    - Computational tools (for drug screening, pathway analysis)
    - Genetic reagents (NF1 constructs, CRISPR tools)
    - Clinical assessment tools (for measuring MPNST outcomes)
    
    However, as a review article, these tools would be CITED from other studies rather than
    experimentally USED in this publication. This is a critical distinction for tool validation.
  overallAssessment: |
    This appears to be a review article focusing on model systems and therapeutic development for NF1-associated
    MPNST. Review articles typically discuss and cite research tools from other studies but do not use them
    experimentally. While the publication likely mentions many relevant tools (animal models, cell lines, PDX
    systems), these would be citations rather than experimental usage, making them inappropriate for tool mining.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication appears to be a review article based on title ("New Model Systems and the Development of...")
    - Only partial abstract available (159 characters), full text not accessible
    - No Methods section present, confirming review article classification
    - No tools were mined, which is appropriate for a review article
    - Review articles cite tools from other studies but don't use them experimentally
  recommendations: |
    This publication should be EXCLUDED from tool mining for the following reasons:
    1. It appears to be a review article, not primary research
    2. Review articles cite tools from other studies rather than using them experimentally
    3. No Methods section indicates no experimental procedures were performed
    4. The title suggests this is a comprehensive review of existing model systems rather than development/usage of new tools
    
    RECOMMENDATION: Remove this publication from the tool mining corpus. Review articles should be excluded
    from tool mining as they discuss tools used by others rather than reporting original experimental usage.
    
    If full text becomes available and reveals this is actually a primary research article with experimental
    methods, it should be re-evaluated. However, based on available evidence, this is clearly a review article
    inappropriate for tool mining.
    
    No specific tools need manual review since none were mined. No new patterns are suggested since the
    publication type itself (review article) makes it unsuitable for tool mining regardless of content.
