  expectedToolTypes: |
    Clinical Trial → clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, scales), computational tools for analysis, animal models for preclinical validation
    This is a phase 1 clinical trial with both human subjects and mouse model components, so multiple tool types are expected:
    - Clinical assessment tools for patient outcomes and adverse events
    - Animal models for preclinical validation
    - Computational tools for pharmacokinetic analysis and imaging analysis
    - Potentially genetic reagents for the mouse model generation
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a phase 1 clinical trial testing selumetinib in pediatric NF1 patients with plexiform neurofibromas. The study includes both clinical components (human subjects) and preclinical validation (mouse models), making it likely to contain multiple research tool types. Clinical assessment tools for measuring adverse events, patient-reported outcomes, and functional assessments are expected. The mouse model component suggests animal models and potentially genetic reagents were used.

      Treatment with selumetinib resulted in decreases from baseline in neurofibroma volume in 12 of 18 mice (67%). This demonstrates the efficacy of selumetinib in reducing tumor burden in the genetically engineered mouse model of NF1-related neurofibroma.

      Used as the definitive assessment method for measuring plexiform neurofibroma response to treatment. More sensitive and reproducible than standard response criteria (RECIST and WHO) due to complex shapes and slow growth rates of plexiform neurofibromas. Evaluations performed centrally at NCI after cycles 5 and 10, then every 6 cycles.
    foundIn: "both"
    contextSnippet: "Therefore, a more sensitive and reproducible volumetric MRI analysis, which has been established as the definitive assessment method, was used in this trial. Evaluations of response to treatment were performed centrally at the NCI by review of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies obtained after cycles 5 and 10 and thereafter after every 6 cycles."

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a clinical trial with both human and mouse model components
    - Multiple research tools were missed including a genetically engineered mouse model, clinical assessment tools, and computational analysis methods
    - The mining system appears to have missed standard clinical trial tools and mouse model nomenclature
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains several important research tools that were completely missed by the initial mining:
    - The DhhCre;Nf1fl/fl mouse model should definitely be added as it's a specific genetically engineered model
    - Clinical assessment tools (CTCAE v4.0, Responsibility for Medication Questionnaire) are valid research tools used in clinical trials
    - Computational tools for volumetric imaging analysis and pharmacokinetic analysis should be considered
    - The mining patterns need improvement for clinical trial contexts and mouse strain nomenclature
    - All potentially missed tools should be manually reviewed for inclusion
