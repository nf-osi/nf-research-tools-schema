    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    
    This is a molecular biology/genomics study investigating NF1 gene splicing patterns using RT-PCR,
    cloning, sequencing, and computational analysis. Expected tools include:
    - Genetic reagents (vectors, bacterial strains, enzymes)
    - Computational tools (splice site prediction software, structure prediction programs)
    - Laboratory reagents (RNA extraction kits, reverse transcriptases, restriction enzymes)
    
    The study does not involve animal models, cell culture, antibodies, organoids, or PDX models.
    Clinical assessment tools are not expected as this is basic molecular research.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory-based molecular biology study that should contain multiple research tools.
    The methods section describes detailed experimental procedures including RNA extraction, RT-PCR,
    cloning, restriction enzyme analysis, sequencing, and computational analysis. Tools are expected
    across genetic reagents and computational categories, with potential laboratory reagents.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Complete failure to mine any tools from a methods-rich molecular biology publication
    - Multiple computational tools missed (SSPNN, mfold, DELPHI)
    - Genetic reagents with vendor information not captured (vectors, bacterial strains, enzymes)
    - Commercial reagents with clear product names and vendors missed
    - Mining patterns appear inadequate for genomics/molecular biology terminology
  recommendations: |
    This publication represents a significant mining failure. Despite being a laboratory research study
    with detailed methods describing multiple tools, zero tools were captured. Key recommendations:
    
    1. IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED: Add all 7-8 missed tools to improve mining coverage
    2. PATTERN ENHANCEMENT: Implement suggested patterns for bioinformatics tools, cloning vectors, 
       bacterial strains, and commercial reagents
    3. VENDOR RECOGNITION: Improve detection of tools with vendor information in parentheses
    4. ACRONYM HANDLING: Better recognition of bioinformatics tool acronyms (SSPNN, etc.)
    5. GENOMICS TERMINOLOGY: Expand patterns for molecular biology and genomics-specific tools
    
    The mining system needs significant improvement for genomics/molecular biology publications.
    This paper should be used as a test case to validate pattern improvements.
