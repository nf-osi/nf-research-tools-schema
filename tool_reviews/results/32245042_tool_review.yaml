    This publication is a comprehensive laboratory research study investigating kinome profiling in NF1-related 
    malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). The study uses genetically engineered mouse models, 
    xenograft systems, reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA), and computational analysis tools. Expected tools 
    include animal models, antibodies for RPPA, computational tools for data analysis, and potentially 
    patient-derived xenograft models.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a sophisticated laboratory research study that extensively uses research tools across multiple categories.
    The study employs genetically engineered mouse models, xenograft systems, proteomic analysis platforms, and 
    computational tools for data analysis. The comprehensive Methods section describes detailed experimental 
    procedures that clearly indicate the use of multiple research tools. Tools are expected and likely present 
    across animal models, antibodies, computational tools, and potentially patient-derived models.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were mined from this publication despite it being a comprehensive laboratory research study
    - Multiple genetically engineered mouse models were completely missed (NF1-MET, NF1-P53, NF1, NSG-SCID)
    - Computational tools including R software versions and specialized analysis software were not detected
    - The mining system failed to identify any of the 99 antibodies used in RPPA analysis
    - Specialized laboratory equipment and analysis platforms were not captured
  recommendations: |
    This publication represents a significant failure of the mining system to detect research tools in a 
    tool-rich laboratory study. All 13 potentially missed tools should be added to improve coverage:
    
    CRITICAL ADDITIONS NEEDED:
    - All four animal models (NF1-MET, NF1-P53, NF1, NSG-SCID mice) - these are core research tools
    - All computational tools (R versions, ggplot2, MicroVigene, Pixcell II LCM) - essential for analysis
    - Consider adding patterns for RPPA antibody panels and specialized laboratory equipment
    
    PATTERN IMPROVEMENTS:
    - Add patterns for genetically engineered mouse model naming conventions
    - Improve detection of software versions (R v3.x.x format)
    - Add patterns for R package names and specialized analysis software
    - Include vendor information patterns to catch specialized equipment
    
    OBSERVATIONS:
    - Extracted 8 high-quality observations covering tumor growth characteristics and tool usage instructions
    - Observations provide valuable phenotypic data for the animal models and usage guidance for computational tools
    
    This publication demonstrates the need for more comprehensive mining patterns, especially for animal models 
    and computational tools commonly used in cancer research.
