  publicationTypeConfidence: 0.95
  hasMethodsSection: No
  likelyContainsTools: Yes
  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a study design/protocol paper describing plans for multi-omic analysis of MPNST tumors.
    Expected tool types include:
    - Computational tools: Mentioned sequencing analysis methods (bulk whole genome sequencing, RNAseq, DNA methylation profiling, deep exome sequencing)
    - Clinical assessment tools: References to "International MPNST Registry" for clinical data collection
    - Potentially patient-derived models: Working with fresh frozen tumor specimens from patients
    
    Note: This is a protocol/design paper describing PLANNED analyses rather than completed experiments,
    so tools may be mentioned as intended methods rather than actively used tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication describes the rationale and study design for a multi-institutional consortium
    to perform multi-omic characterization of MPNSTs. While it lacks a traditional Methods section,
    it describes planned analytical approaches including genomic sequencing, transcriptomics, and
    epigenetic profiling. The paper would be expected to mention computational tools for planned
    analyses and potentially clinical assessment tools for data collection.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - This is a study design/protocol paper describing planned analyses rather than completed experiments
    - No Methods section present, only abstract and brief discussion
    - Most mentions are of general methodological approaches (sequencing, profiling) rather than specific tools
    - The "International MPNST Registry" could potentially be considered a clinical assessment tool
    - No specific software, reagents, or experimental tools are named
  recommendations: |
    The mining results appear correct - this publication contains no specific research tools.
    It describes planned methodological approaches (sequencing, profiling) but does not name
    specific software, reagents, or experimental tools. The International MPNST Registry
    could potentially be considered a clinical data collection tool, but this would require
    manual curator review to determine if registries should be included as clinical assessment tools.
    
    This type of study design/protocol paper typically would not contain specific research tools
    since it describes planned work rather than completed experiments. The absence of mined tools
    is appropriate for this publication type.
