    This is a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial examining lovastatin effects on neurobehavioral 
    function in NF1 patients. Expected tool types include:
    - Clinical assessment tools: Multiple neuropsychological tests and behavioral questionnaires are described
    - Computational tools: Statistical analysis software and neuroimaging analysis tools (FSL mentioned)
    - Advanced cellular models: Not expected for this clinical trial
    - Patient-derived models: Not expected for this clinical trial
    - Lab research tools: Not expected for this clinical trial design
  overallAssessment: |
    This clinical trial publication extensively uses validated neuropsychological assessment tools and 
    behavioral questionnaires to measure treatment outcomes. The study also employs computational tools 
    for statistical analysis and neuroimaging data processing. Clinical assessment tools are the primary 
    research instruments in this study design, making this publication highly likely to contain genuine 
    research tools despite the initial mining finding zero tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining completely missed this publication's extensive use of clinical assessment tools
    - This is a clinical trial with 11+ validated neuropsychological and behavioral assessment instruments
    - One computational tool (FSL neuroimaging software) was also missed
    - The mining system appears to have failed to recognize standard clinical assessment tool naming patterns
  recommendations: |
    This publication should have 13 tools added to the database:
    - 12 clinical assessment tools (neuropsychological tests and behavioral questionnaires)
    - 1 computational tool (FSL neuroimaging analysis software)
    
    All identified tools are genuine research instruments with:
    - Clear usage context in a randomized controlled trial
    - Specific outcome measurements and statistical results
    - Standard naming conventions with acronyms and reference citations
    - Validated psychometric properties mentioned in methods
    
    The mining patterns need significant improvement for clinical assessment tools, particularly:
    - Recognition of neuropsychological test naming conventions
    - Context phrases like "outcome measures" and "assessed using"
    - Standard assessment tool families (Wechsler, Achenbach, etc.)
    
    Seven scientific observations were extracted showing treatment effects and usage details for the validated tools.
