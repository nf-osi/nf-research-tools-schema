    Clinical Trial → clinical assessment tools (neuropsychological tests, behavioral scales, questionnaires), 
    computational tools for statistical analysis and neuroimaging processing, potentially imaging tools.
    This is a randomized controlled trial testing lovastatin effects on cognition in NF1 patients, so clinical 
    assessment tools are highly expected for measuring cognitive and behavioral outcomes.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial examining lovastatin effects on neurobehavioral 
    function in NF1 patients. Clinical trials typically use validated assessment tools to measure outcomes, 
    and this study extensively uses neuropsychological tests and behavioral scales. The presence of 
    neuroimaging (fMRI) also suggests computational tools for image analysis.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a clinical trial with extensive use of validated assessment tools
    - Multiple standardized neuropsychological tests and behavioral scales were used but not detected
    - Neuroimaging analysis software (FSL) was used but not captured
    - Clinical assessment tools are legitimate research tools but may be under-represented in current mining patterns
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous validated clinical assessment tools that should be captured.
    The neuropsychological tests (BVMT, LNS, WASI, HVLT) and behavioral scales (CBCL, YASR, BRIEF, D-KEFS) 
    are all standardized research instruments used to measure cognitive and behavioral outcomes in clinical trials.
    The FSL neuroimaging software is also a legitimate computational tool. All 10 potentially missed tools 
    should be added as they represent genuine research tools used in this study. The suggested patterns 
    would help capture similar clinical assessment tools in future mining efforts.
