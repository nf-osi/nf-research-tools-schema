  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study focused on preclinical drug testing for NF2-associated tumors.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: No tools were mined from this publication despite clear evidence of multiple research tools
    - This is a laboratory research study with extensive tool usage including cell lines, animal models, and analytical methods
    - The mining system failed to detect any of the obvious research tools mentioned in the abstract and methods
    - Multiple cell line types are described (primary, immortalized, CRISPR-modified)
    - Mouse knockout models (Nf2-/-) are clearly mentioned
    - Orthotopic tumor models are described
    - Computational analysis methods (RNA-seq, flow cytometry) are mentioned
  recommendations: |
    This represents a significant failure of the mining system. The publication clearly describes:
    1. Multiple cell line types that should have been detected
    2. Mouse knockout models with standard genetic nomenclature
    3. Orthotopic tumor models for drug testing
    4. Computational analysis methods
    
    Immediate actions needed:
    1. Review and improve cell line detection patterns to capture generic descriptions
    2. Add patterns for knockout mouse nomenclature (Gene-/-, Gene+/-)
    3. Improve detection of complex model systems (orthotopic tumor models)
    4. Consider adding patterns for CRISPR-modified cell lines
    5. Evaluate whether computational methods should be captured when analysis tools aren't specified
    
    This publication should be re-processed with improved mining patterns as it contains numerous valid research tools that were completely missed.
