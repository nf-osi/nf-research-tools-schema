  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on the publication type (Lab Research) and topic (proteasomal pathway inhibition for NF2-associated tumors):
    - Cell lines (likely NF2-deficient cell lines, meningioma cell lines, schwannoma cell lines)
    - Genetic reagents (NF2 constructs, siRNA, plasmids, proteasome inhibitors like bortezomib, carfilzomib, MG132)
    - Antibodies (for Western blot, immunofluorescence against proteasome subunits, NF2/merlin, ubiquitin)
    - Computational tools (for data analysis, statistical software, image analysis)
    - Animal models (potentially NF2 knockout mice or tumor xenograft models)
    - Chemical compounds/inhibitors (proteasome inhibitors are central to this research)
    
    This type of mechanistic study investigating therapeutic targets typically uses multiple research tools across categories.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study investigating proteasomal pathway inhibition as a therapeutic approach for NF2-associated tumors.
    Such mechanistic studies typically employ multiple research tools including cell lines, antibodies, genetic reagents, and computational analysis tools.
    The fact that no tools were initially mined from a publication with this focus is highly unusual and suggests significant gaps in current mining patterns, particularly for chemical biology and therapeutic research.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Zero tools were mined from a laboratory research publication that should contain numerous research tools
    - Publication topic (proteasomal pathway inhibition for NF2 tumors) strongly indicates use of chemical inhibitors, specialized cell lines, and antibodies
    - Current mining patterns appear inadequate for capturing chemical compounds and pharmaceutical tools
    - Functional cell line descriptions (NF2-deficient) may be missed by standard nomenclature patterns
    - Statistical analysis tools are likely present but not captured
    - This represents a systematic failure in mining chemical biology and therapeutic research publications
  recommendations: |
    This publication represents a critical mining failure - a laboratory mechanistic study with zero tools identified despite clear therapeutic focus.
    URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS:
    1. IMMEDIATE: Expand mining patterns to include proteasome inhibitors and chemical compounds
    2. Add comprehensive patterns for pharmaceutical/chemical vendors (Sigma, Selleck, Cayman, etc.)
    3. Include functional cell line descriptions (NF2-deficient, tumor-derived, patient-derived)
    4. Capture statistical analysis software mentions even when brief or without versions
    5. Add context-based mining for treatment/inhibition/exposure phrases
    6. CRITICAL: Manual review of this publication is essential to catalog actual tools used
    7. Use this publication as a primary test case for improved chemical biology mining patterns
    8. The complete absence of tools indicates fundamental gaps in current mining approach for therapeutic research
    9. Consider separate mining strategies for different research domains (chemical biology vs molecular biology)
    10. Validate mining improvements against similar therapeutic/chemical biology publications
