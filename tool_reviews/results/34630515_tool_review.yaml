    This publication describes CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in porcine embryos to create NF1 disease models.
    Expected tools include: genetic reagents (CRISPR components), cell lines (for validation), 
    animal models (genetically engineered pigs), and computational tools (for sequence analysis).
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study describing the development of genetically engineered porcine models
    of neurofibromatosis type 1 using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The publication contains extensive methods
    for embryo manipulation, genetic engineering, and genotyping, indicating high likelihood of research
    tool usage and development. Multiple tool categories are expected including genetic reagents, cell lines,
    animal models, and computational analysis tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a methods-heavy laboratory research publication
    - Multiple clear research tools present in methods section were missed by mining patterns
    - Cell lines with ATCC catalog numbers not captured
    - Computational analysis tools (CRISPResso, CRISPOR) not identified
    - Laboratory instruments and systems not recognized as tools
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous legitimate research tools that were completely missed by the initial mining.
    The tools identified include: authenticated cell lines (LLC-PK1), computational analysis software (CRISPResso/CRISPResso2, CRISPOR),
    laboratory instruments (QX200 dPCR system, 4D Nucleofector), and custom animal models being developed.
    All potentially missed tools should be added to improve mining coverage for similar publications.
    The suggested patterns would significantly improve detection of cell lines, computational tools, and laboratory instruments.
    No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated, but this publication likely contains
    valuable phenotypic and methodological observations about the porcine NF1 models being developed.
