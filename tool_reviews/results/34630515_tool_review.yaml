    - Computational tools (for CRISPR design, sequencing analysis)
    
    The publication focuses on methodological development and validation, making it highly likely to contain
    multiple categories of research tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research publication describing the development of genetically engineered porcine 
    models for NF1 research using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The publication has a comprehensive Methods section
    detailing experimental procedures, making it highly likely to contain research tools across multiple

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were mined from this publication despite it being a comprehensive laboratory research study
    - The mining system completely failed to detect multiple categories of research tools
    - Cell lines with ATCC catalog numbers were not detected
    - Computational tools with version numbers were not detected
    - Genetically engineered animal models were not detected
    - CRISPR genetic reagents were not detected
    - This represents a significant failure of the mining system for this publication type
  recommendations: |
    This publication should have yielded multiple research tools across several categories:
    - All 10 potentially missed tools should be added to the database
    - The mining patterns need significant improvement for CRISPR/genome editing publications
    - Cell line detection patterns should include ATCC catalog numbers
    - Computational tool patterns should better capture bioinformatics software
    - Animal model patterns should detect genetically engineered models
    - Genetic reagent patterns should capture CRISPR components
    - The complete failure to mine any tools from this rich publication indicates systematic issues with the mining approach
    - No observations were extracted as no tools were initially validated, but the missed tools could yield valuable observations about model development and validation
