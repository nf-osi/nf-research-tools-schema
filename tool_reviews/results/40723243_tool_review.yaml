  expectedToolTypes: |
    Lab Research publication with detailed Methods section describing:
    - Cell lines (pNF cell lines from ATCC)
    - Animal models (nude mice, genetically modified mice)
    - Computational tools (WGCNA, IDACombo, SynergyFinder, GraphPad Prism)
    - Genetic reagents (DhhCre;Nf1 configuration)
    - Laboratory reagents and assays (CellTiter-Glo, culture media)
    
    This is clearly a laboratory research study with in vitro cell culture experiments
    and in vivo animal model testing. Multiple tool categories are expected.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research publication describing drug combination testing using
    cell culture and animal models. The detailed Methods section indicates extensive use
    of research tools including cell lines, animal models, computational analysis software,
    and laboratory reagents. Tools are definitely expected and likely underdetected.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Mining completely failed to detect any tools despite clear laboratory research
    - 11 obvious research tools missed including cell lines, animal models, and computational tools
    - Cell lines with ATCC source and catalog numbers not detected
    - Computational tools with version numbers and URLs not detected
    - Genetically modified mouse models not detected
    - Commercial assay kits with catalog numbers not detected
  recommendations: |
    URGENT: The mining system completely failed on this publication. This is a clear laboratory
    research paper with extensive tool usage that should have been easily detected:
    
    1. Add all 11 missed tools immediately - they are unambiguous research tools
    2. Implement the 7 suggested patterns to catch similar tools in future
    3. Review mining algorithms for basic pattern recognition failures
    4. This represents a major gap in mining coverage for laboratory research
    5. No observations could be extracted due to missing Results/Discussion sections
    6. Consider this a high-priority case for improving mining sensitivity
