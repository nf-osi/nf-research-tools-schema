  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study using genetically engineered mouse models of neurofibromatosis
    to isolate and characterize cancer stem cells. The extensive Methods section describes multiple experimental
    approaches requiring various research tools including mouse strains, cell culture systems, molecular reagents,
    and computational analysis tools. This type of study would typically use and develop multiple categories of
    research tools across animal models, cell lines, genetic reagents, antibodies, and computational tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple categories of research tools are clearly present in the Methods section
    - Mouse strain nomenclature, cell lines, antibodies, and genetic reagents are extensively used
    - Computational tools for microarray analysis are described with specific versions
    - The mining system appears to have missed standard research tool terminology
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous legitimate research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The study uses multiple genetically engineered mouse strains, standard cell lines, antibodies, genetic
    reagents, and computational tools. All 13 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent
    genuine research tools with proper experimental context. The suggested patterns would significantly
    improve detection of mouse models, genetic reagents, and antibodies in future mining. Manual curator
    review is recommended to validate the extensive tool usage described in this comprehensive study.
