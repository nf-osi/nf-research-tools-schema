# TOOL REVIEW STATUS: FILE NOT FOUND
# 
# The input file 34604833_input.json was not found in the inputs directory.
# Available PMID files range from 26423696 to 34237737.
# PMID 34604833 is outside the current range.
#
# To complete this tool validation, the following file would be needed:
# /home/runner/work/nf-research-tools-schema/nf-research-tools-schema/tool_reviews/inputs/34604833_input.json
#
# This file should contain:
# - Publication metadata (PMID, title, DOI, journal, year, queryType)
# - Abstract text
# - Full text sections (Methods, Introduction, Results, Discussion)
# - List of mined tools with their types and context
#
# Once this file is available, I can perform the complete tool validation workflow:
# 1. Analyze publication type and expected tool categories
# 2. Validate each mined tool for authenticity
# 3. Search for potentially missed tools
# 4. Suggest new mining patterns
# 5. Extract scientific observations from validated tools
# 6. Generate comprehensive YAML review report
