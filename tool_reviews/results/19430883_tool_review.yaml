    Based on publication type (Clinical Study focused on trial methodology):
    - Clinical assessment tools → Expected (radiographic response criteria, hearing assessment tools)
    - Computational tools → Possibly (for image analysis, statistical analysis)
    
    This paper establishes standardized endpoints for NF2 clinical trials, which inherently involves
    clinical assessment tools for measuring outcomes. The focus on "word recognition scores using 
    50-word recorded lists in audiology" and "post-contrast T1-weighted MRI images" suggests 
    specific clinical assessment methodologies that could be considered tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a clinical methodology paper that establishes response criteria for NF2 clinical trials.
    Such publications typically define or reference clinical assessment tools (outcome measures, 
    scales, imaging protocols) even if they don't use traditional lab research tools. The paper
    specifically mentions audiological assessment methods and imaging criteria that could be 
    considered clinical assessment tools, though they may not have been captured by current mining patterns.

    whyMissed: "This is a specific imaging protocol/methodology used as a clinical assessment tool for measuring tumor response. While MRI is a general imaging modality, the specific protocol (post-contrast T1-weighted with specific slice thickness) represents a standardized assessment tool."

  majorIssuesFound: |
    Major issues identified during review:
    - Query type mismatch: Publication tagged as "bench" but is clearly a clinical methodology paper
    - Limited text availability: Only abstract available, no Methods/Results/Discussion sections
    - Potential tool mining gaps: Clinical assessment methodologies mentioned in response criteria definitions were not captured
    - Pattern limitations: Current mining may not effectively capture clinical assessment tools described within endpoint definitions
  recommendations: |
    Overall recommendations for this publication:
    - This publication should be re-classified from "bench" to "clinical" query type
    - Consider adding the audiological assessment method (50-word recorded lists) as a clinical assessment tool
    - The specific MRI protocol could potentially be considered a clinical assessment tool, though this is borderline
    - Improve mining patterns to capture clinical assessment methodologies described in response criteria and endpoint definitions
    - This type of methodology paper is valuable for clinical assessment tool discovery but requires specialized patterns
    - No traditional lab research tools are expected or found, which is appropriate for this publication type
    - The lack of full-text sections limits comprehensive tool discovery - abstract-only mining may miss detailed methodological descriptions
