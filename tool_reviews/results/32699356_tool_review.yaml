    This is a comprehensive laboratory study using mouse models of glioblastoma with extensive molecular biology,
    cell culture, imaging, and computational analysis methods. Expected tools include genetically modified mouse
    strains, antibodies for immunostaining, cell lines derived from tumors, computational tools for analysis,
    and various genetic reagents for PCR and sequencing.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Extensive Methods section contains numerous research tools that should have been detected
    - Multiple categories of tools are present: genetically modified mouse strains, antibodies, cell lines, and computational tools
    - Tool nomenclature follows standard conventions but may not match current mining patterns
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains extensive research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The study uses sophisticated genetically engineered mouse models, multiple antibodies for immunostaining,
    primary cell lines derived from tumors, and several bioinformatics tools for genomic analysis.
    All 16 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine research tools with proper
    context, catalog numbers, and experimental usage. The suggested patterns would significantly improve
    detection of similar tools in future mining efforts. This represents a major gap in current mining
    coverage for laboratory research publications.
