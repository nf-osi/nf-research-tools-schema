  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining failed to capture any tools despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple antibodies listed in vendor sourcing statements without 'antibody' keyword
    - MPNST cell lines with specific nomenclature not recognized
    - siRNA genetic reagents not captured
    - Imaging equipment and software not identified
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous research tools that were completely missed by initial mining:
    - 17 tools should be added including 3 NF1-associated MPNST cell lines, 9 antibodies, 2 siRNA reagents, and 3 computational tools
    - The mining patterns need significant improvement for antibody detection in vendor lists
    - Cell line naming conventions for MPNST research need better coverage
    - siRNA and imaging tool patterns should be enhanced
    - This represents a major gap in tool detection for molecular biology publications
    - All suggested tools have high confidence and clear experimental usage context
    - No observations extracted since no tools were initially validated
