  majorIssuesFound: |
    Major mining failure - no tools were detected despite comprehensive Methods section:
    - Multiple antibodies with vendor information completely missed
    - Three MPNST cell lines (T265-2c, ST88-14, 90-8) not detected
    - siRNA reagents with vendor information missed
    - Analysis software and instruments not detected
    - This represents a systematic failure of the mining patterns
  recommendations: |
    Critical mining system improvements needed:
    - Add patterns for "Primary antibodies were obtained from" context
    - Implement cell line naming patterns for alphanumeric formats (T265-2c, ST88-14)
    - Add siRNA detection patterns with vendor context
    - Include instrument/software detection patterns
    - This publication should have yielded 20+ tools but found zero
    - All 20 potentially missed tools should be added to improve mining coverage
    - The extracted observations demonstrate rich experimental data available for validated tools
    - Mining patterns need comprehensive overhaul to catch basic lab tools
