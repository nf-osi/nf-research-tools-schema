    This is a molecular biology/cell biology study using primary neural progenitor cell cultures from genetically 
    modified mice. Expected tools include:
    - Animal models (Nf2 flox/flox mice)
    - Cell lines/cultures (primary neural progenitor cells, neurospheres)
    - Antibodies (for Western blotting, immunocytochemistry)
    - Genetic reagents (adenoviruses, retroviruses, shRNAs, plasmids)
    - Computational tools (analysis software like Metamorph, GraphPad Prism)
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study that extensively uses research tools across multiple categories.
    The study employs genetically modified mouse models, primary cell culture systems, viral vectors for gene delivery,
    multiple antibodies for protein detection, and computational tools for data analysis. The complete absence of mined
    tools represents a significant mining failure, as this publication contains numerous genuine research tools that
    should have been captured.

      No viable Nf2 BLBP CKO pups were born when NF2 gene was conditionally deleted in BLBP+ cells,

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Complete mining failure: No tools were captured despite extensive tool usage throughout the publication
    - This is a comprehensive laboratory research study with multiple tool categories represented
    - Missing animal models (genetically modified mice), antibodies, genetic reagents, computational tools, and cell culture systems
    - All major experimental tools used in the study were missed by the mining algorithm
    - The publication contains detailed Methods section with vendor information, catalog numbers, and specific experimental protocols
  recommendations: |
    This represents a significant mining failure. The publication contains numerous genuine research tools across 
    multiple categories that should have been captured:
    
    CRITICAL MISSING TOOLS:
    - Genetically modified mouse models (Nf2 flox/flox mice)
    - Multiple antibodies with vendor/dilution information
    - Viral vectors (adenovirus, retrovirus, lentivirus)
    - shRNA constructs with GenBank accessions
    - Commercial assay kits
    - Computational analysis software
    - Primary cell culture systems
    - Pharmacological inhibitors
    
    PATTERN IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:
    - Better recognition of mouse strain nomenclature
    - Capture of vendor information in parentheses
    - Recognition of viral vector systems
    - Detection of software tools with version numbers
    - Identification of primary cell culture systems
    
    OBSERVATIONS EXTRACTED:
    High-quality scientific observations were extracted covering developmental lethality, growth phenotypes, 
    cell survival changes, differentiation alterations, and molecular signaling pathway modifications. 
    These observations provide valuable phenotypic data for the research community.
    
    IMMEDIATE ACTION: All 14 potentially missed tools should be added to the database as they represent 
    genuine research tools with clear experimental usage context.
