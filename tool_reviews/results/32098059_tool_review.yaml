  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on publication type (Bioinformatics Analysis):
    - Computational tools (software, packages, pipelines) - HIGHLY EXPECTED
    - Potentially some databases or web applications
    - Lab tools (antibodies, cell lines, etc.) - UNLIKELY for this type of analysis
    - Clinical assessment tools - UNLIKELY for this computational study
    
    This is a pure bioinformatics analysis using RNA-seq and genomic data with extensive
    computational methods. Multiple R packages, algorithms, and analysis pipelines are
    described in detail in the Methods section.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a computational bioinformatics study analyzing existing RNA-seq and genomic datasets
    from NF1 tumors. The publication extensively uses computational tools including R packages,
    machine learning algorithms, and bioinformatics pipelines. No wet lab experiments were
    performed - all analysis was computational. The Methods section contains detailed descriptions
    of software tools, versions, and analysis workflows that should be captured as research tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: No tools were mined from this publication despite extensive computational methods
    - This is a pure bioinformatics analysis paper with detailed Methods section listing 19+ software tools
    - All mentions are legitimate computational tools (R packages, algorithms, bioinformatics software)
    - Mining patterns appear to miss quoted package names and algorithm mentions
    - GitHub repositories and analysis workflows are also mentioned but not captured
  recommendations: |
    URGENT: This publication should have captured 19+ computational tools but found none.
    
    Key issues with current mining:
    1. Quoted R package names are not being captured ("tidyverse", "PLIER", etc.)
    2. Algorithm names without quotes are missed (MultiPLIER, metaVIPER, CIBERSORT)
    3. Tools with descriptive context are missed (Salmon pseudo-alignment tool)
    4. GitHub repositories with tool names are not captured
    
    Recommended actions:
    1. Implement suggested patterns for quoted package names
    2. Add patterns for algorithm mentions
    3. Improve context-based tool detection
    4. Add all 19 identified tools to the mining results
    5. Review other bioinformatics papers to ensure similar tools aren't being missed
    
    This represents a significant gap in computational tool mining that likely affects
    many bioinformatics publications in the corpus.
