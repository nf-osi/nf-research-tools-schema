    Review Article → typically no research tools used directly, may cite tools from other studies
    The Methods section discusses electrophysiological methods as diagnostic tools but in a general/educational context rather than describing specific experimental procedures or tool usage.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a review article compiling clinical and experimental evidence for merlin's role in neurons. While it has a Methods section, this describes electrophysiological methods in general diagnostic terms rather than specific experimental procedures. Review articles typically cite tools from other studies but don't use tools directly for new experiments.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a review article, not primary research
    - Methods section describes general diagnostic approaches rather than specific experimental procedures
    - No actual research tools used in this study - only general discussion of clinical diagnostic methods
    - All content is educational/review in nature rather than reporting new experimental findings
  recommendations: |
    This review article should not be expected to contain research tools as it compiles existing knowledge rather than reporting new experiments. The potentially missed tools (CMAP, nerve conduction velocity) are clinical diagnostic measurements that could be considered assessment tools, but they are discussed in general educational context rather than being used in specific studies. Future mining could consider whether to include general clinical diagnostic methods from review articles, but this would likely generate many false positives.
