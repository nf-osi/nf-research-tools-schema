      This novel murine model provides a platform to understand the cellular and molecular
      mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of spinal deficits in NF1 patients. The model
      demonstrates multiple structural and functional abnormalities in the lumbar vertebrae
      which recapitulate the dystrophic vertebral changes in NF1 patients.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple mouse strains and imaging systems with specific vendor/version information were missed
    - The main novel mouse model being developed (Nf1(flox/-);Col2.3Cre(+)) was not captured
    - Standard mouse strain nomenclature patterns need improvement
  recommendations: |
    All 9 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine research tools used in this study.
    The mouse strains are well-documented with proper nomenclature and source attribution.
    The imaging/analysis systems have specific vendor and version information indicating actual usage.
    New patterns should be implemented to better capture mouse strain nomenclature and vendor-specific equipment.
    This publication demonstrates the need for better coverage of animal model naming conventions.
