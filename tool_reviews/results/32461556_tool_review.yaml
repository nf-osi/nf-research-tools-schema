    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a comprehensive laboratory study using CRISPR genome editing, mouse models, organoid culture,
    and various molecular biology techniques. Expected tools include mouse strains, organoids, antibodies,
    genetic reagents (sgRNAs), computational tools for analysis, and potentially PDX models for transplantation.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a sophisticated laboratory research study that extensively uses research tools across multiple categories.
    The study involves CRISPR genome editing, organoid culture systems, mouse models, immunohistochemistry,
    and computational analysis. The comprehensive Methods section describes detailed protocols for tool usage,
    making this an excellent candidate for tool mining across antibodies, animal models, genetic reagents,
    advanced cellular models, and computational tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Mining patterns failed to capture standard mouse strain nomenclature (C57BL/6, NSG)
    - Organoid models not detected despite being central to the study
    - CRISPR reagents (sgRNAs) targeting NF1 and other genes not captured
    - Antibodies listed in table format with catalog numbers not detected
    - Computational tools (ImageJ, DESeq2, GSEA) with versions not captured
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous high-quality research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The study is highly relevant to NF research as it uses Nf1 sgRNAs and develops organoid models.
    All 14 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine research tools with clear experimental usage.
    The suggested patterns would significantly improve mining of mouse models, organoids, CRISPR reagents, and computational tools.
    This represents a major gap in current mining coverage for laboratory research publications.
