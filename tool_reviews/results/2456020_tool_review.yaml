    This is an immunohistochemical study from 1988 examining nerve growth factor receptor expression
    in soft tissue tumors. Based on the abstract, this study would be expected to use:
    - Antibodies (primary antibody against NGF-R for immunohistochemistry)
    - Possibly tissue processing reagents and detection systems
    - Human tissue samples (141 soft tissue tumors)
    
    The study mentions "antisera capable of working in paraffin-embedded tissue" and describes
    immunohistochemical staining patterns, indicating laboratory-based experimental work using
    antibody-based detection methods.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory-based pathology study that would typically use research tools, particularly
    antibodies for immunohistochemical detection. The study examined 141 soft tissue tumors using
    immunohistochemistry to detect nerve growth factor receptor expression, which requires specific
    antibodies and detection reagents. However, the publication lacks a detailed Methods section,
    making it difficult to identify specific tools with catalog numbers or vendor information.

    whyMissed: "The abstract mentions 'antisera' for NGF-R detection but doesn't use standard antibody terminology. The mining patterns may not have captured 'antisera' as an antibody indicator."

    toolType: "antibody"
    foundIn: "abstract"
    contextSnippet: "only 1 antisera capable of working in paraffin-embedded tissue was noted"
    whyMissed: "The term 'antisera' is an older terminology for antibodies that may not be captured by modern mining patterns focused on 'antibody', 'Ab', or commercial antibody naming conventions."

suggestedPatterns:
  - patternType: "term"
    pattern: "antisera|antiserum"
    toolType: "antibody"
    examples: ["antisera capable of working in paraffin-embedded tissue", "NGF-R antisera"]
    reasoning: "Historical publications (especially pre-1990s) often use 'antisera' or 'antiserum' instead of 'antibody'. This pattern would capture older antibody references that use traditional terminology."

  - patternType: "context_phrase"
    pattern: "immunohistochemical study|immunohistochemistry|immunoreactivity"
    toolType: "antibody"
    examples: ["immunohistochemical study of the expression", "immunoreactivity was seen", "immunoreactivity for NGF-R"]
    reasoning: "Immunohistochemistry inherently requires antibodies. Publications describing immunohistochemical methods should trigger antibody detection even without explicit antibody mentions."

  - patternType: "naming_convention"
    pattern: "[A-Z]{2,}-R\\s+(antisera|antiserum|antibody)"
    toolType: "antibody"
    examples: ["NGF-R antisera", "EGF-R antibody"]
    reasoning: "Receptor-targeting antibodies often follow the pattern of abbreviated receptor name followed by '-R' and then antibody/antisera terminology."

  majorIssuesFound: |
    List major issues found during review:
    - No tools were mined from this publication despite clear evidence of antibody usage
    - Publication lacks detailed Methods section, making tool identification challenging
    - Historical terminology ('antisera' instead of 'antibody') not captured by modern mining patterns
    - Abstract-only content limits ability to extract detailed tool information and experimental observations
  recommendations: |
    Overall recommendations for this publication:
    - Two antibody tools were likely missed and should be added to the database
    - Mining patterns should be updated to capture historical antibody terminology ('antisera', 'antiserum')
    - Immunohistochemistry context should trigger antibody detection even without explicit mentions
    - This publication demonstrates the need for historical terminology awareness in mining patterns
    - No specific observations could be extracted due to lack of detailed Results/Discussion sections
    - Future mining should consider that older publications may use different terminology conventions
