  likelyContainsTools: Yes
  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a qualitative research study using in-depth interviews and thematic analysis. Expected tool types:
    - Computational tools: Qualitative analysis software, frameworks, or methodologies
    - Clinical assessment tools: Interview schedules, questionnaires, or validated instruments for data collection
    
    The study focuses on patient experiences rather than laboratory research, so lab tools (antibodies, cell lines, 
    animal models, genetic reagents, organoids, PDX) are not expected. However, the analytical methodology and 
    data collection instruments used in qualitative research are legitimate research tools that enable scientific inquiry.
  overallAssessment: |
    This qualitative research study would typically use research tools, specifically methodological frameworks for 
    data analysis and structured interview guides for data collection. While no traditional lab tools are expected, 
    qualitative research methodologies and data collection instruments are valid research tools that enable systematic 
    scientific investigation of patient experiences and social phenomena.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - This is a qualitative research study, not a laboratory or clinical trial study
    - No traditional research tools (antibodies, cell lines, etc.) were used or expected
    - The mining system may not be optimized for qualitative research methodologies
    - Several analytical frameworks and methodologies were potentially missed but have borderline status as "tools"
  recommendations: |
    - No tools were mined, which is appropriate for this type of qualitative research study
    - Consider whether qualitative analysis methodologies (RTA, thematic analysis frameworks) should be included as computational tools
    - The interview schedule/guide could potentially be considered a clinical assessment tool, but it's custom-designed rather than validated
    - Mining patterns should be refined to better distinguish between general methodologies and specific research tools
    - For qualitative research studies, focus on validated instruments, software tools, or established analytical frameworks rather than general methodological approaches
    - No observations were extracted as no validated tools were identified
