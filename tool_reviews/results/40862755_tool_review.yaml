    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a laboratory research study using 3D cell culture models to investigate drug resistance mechanisms
    in plexiform neurofibromas. Expected tools include cell lines, antibodies, computational analysis software,
    and potentially advanced cellular models (3D culture systems). The study uses immortalized cell lines,
    primary fibroblasts, specific antibodies, and various reagents for drug testing and imaging.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study investigating drug resistance mechanisms in plexiform neurofibromas
    using 3D cell culture models. The publication contains extensive methods describing cell culture, drug
    treatments, imaging, and molecular assays, indicating high likelihood of research tool usage. Multiple
    tool types are expected including cell lines, antibodies, reagents, and computational analysis software.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a clear laboratory research study
    - Multiple legitimate research tools present in methods section were missed
    - Cell lines with ATCC catalog information not detected
    - Antibodies with specific catalog numbers not identified
    - Specialized 3D culture devices with patent numbers not captured
    - Analysis software with version numbers not recognized
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous legitimate research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The study uses immortalized cell lines from ATCC, specific antibodies with catalog numbers, patented
    3D culture devices, and analysis software with version numbers. All potentially missed tools should be
    added to improve mining coverage. The suggested patterns would help capture similar tools in future
    NF research publications. No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated.
