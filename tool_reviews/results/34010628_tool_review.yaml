    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a comprehensive lab research study involving mouse models, cell culture, molecular biology,
    bioinformatics analysis, and drug testing. Expected tools include genetically engineered mouse models,
    cell lines, antibodies for immunostaining, computational tools for RNA-seq analysis, and potentially
    organoid-like cultures (SKPs, spheres).
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study investigating cancer stem cells in NF1-associated
    tumors using multiple experimental approaches. The extensive Methods section describes mouse models,
    cell culture, molecular biology techniques, bioinformatics analysis, and drug treatments, indicating
    heavy use of research tools. Tools are expected across multiple categories including animal models,
    cell lines, antibodies, and computational software.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple genetically engineered mouse models with complex nomenclature were missed
    - Several important bioinformatics tools (STAR, DeSeq2, Seurat, GSVA) were not captured
    - Primary cell culture systems (SKPs) were not identified
    - Laboratory equipment with vendor names was not recognized
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous research tools that were completely missed by the initial mining.
    The study uses multiple genetically engineered mouse models, primary cell cultures, and computational
    tools that are highly relevant to NF research. The mining patterns need significant improvement to
    capture complex mouse model nomenclature and bioinformatics workflows. All potentially missed tools
    should be added to improve coverage of similar publications. The lack of any mined tools from such
    a tool-rich publication indicates major gaps in the current mining approach.
