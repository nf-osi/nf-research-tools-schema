    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools
    This is a laboratory research study using mouse models, cell culture, immunohistochemistry,
    and molecular analysis techniques. Expected tools include animal models (Nf1 mutant mice),
    antibodies for immunostaining, cell lines derived from tumors, and computational tools
    for statistical analysis.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study investigating radiation-induced cancer
    in Nf1 mutant mice. The study involves animal models, cell culture, molecular biology
    techniques, and statistical analysis, making it highly likely to contain multiple
    research tools across several categories.

    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple clear research tools present in methods section were missed
    - Animal models, antibodies, cell lines, and computational tools all present but not detected
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous legitimate research tools that were completely missed
    by the initial mining. The study uses genetically modified mouse models (Nf1+/- mice),
    multiple specific antibodies with catalog numbers, primary cell lines derived from
    these mice, and computational tools for analysis. All 13 potentially missed tools
    should be added to improve mining coverage. The suggested patterns would help capture
    similar tools in future NF research publications. No observations were extracted
    since no tools were initially validated, but this publication would likely contain
    valuable phenotypic observations about Nf1 mouse models if tools were properly mined.
