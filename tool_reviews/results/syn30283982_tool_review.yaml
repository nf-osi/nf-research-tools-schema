    Unable to determine expected tool types because the input file syn30283982_input.json 
    does not exist in the inputs directory. The inputs directory contains 173 files with 
    numeric PMIDs ranging from 27043043 to higher numbers, but no file matching syn30283982.
    
    To complete this validation, the following file would be needed:
    /home/runner/work/nf-research-tools-schema/nf-research-tools-schema/tool_reviews/inputs/syn30283982_input.json
    
    This file should contain:
    - Publication metadata (PMID, title, DOI, journal, year, queryType)
    - Abstract text
    - Full text sections (Methods, Introduction, Results, Discussion if available)
    - List of mined tools with their types and context
  overallAssessment: |
    Cannot assess publication or validate tools because the input file is missing.
    The identifier "syn30283982" does not correspond to any existing input file in the 
    tool_reviews/inputs directory. This may be a test case, hypothetical scenario, or 
    the file may need to be created before validation can proceed.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - INPUT FILE MISSING: syn30283982_input.json does not exist in the inputs directory
    - Cannot validate tools without publication text and mined tool data
    - The inputs directory contains 173 files but none match the requested identifier
    - This appears to be a test case or hypothetical scenario
  recommendations: |
    To complete tool validation for syn30283982:
    1. Verify the correct identifier - ensure "syn30283982" is the correct publication ID
    2. Create the missing input file syn30283982_input.json with required publication data
    3. Include publication metadata, abstract, full text sections, and mined tools list
    4. Re-run validation once the input file is available
    
    If this is a test case, please provide the publication data in the expected JSON format.
    If this is a real publication, the input file needs to be generated from the source data.
