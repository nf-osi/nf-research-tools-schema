    Clinical Study → clinical assessment tools (imaging devices for outcome measurement), 
    computational tools for statistical analysis. This study specifically compares 3D imaging 
    systems as standardized outcome measures for clinical trials, which qualifies as clinical 
    assessment tools. Statistical software (IBM SPSS) is also used for data analysis.
  overallAssessment: |
    This clinical study compares three 3D imaging devices (Vectra-H1, LifeViz-Micro, Cherry-Imaging) 
    for measuring cutaneous neurofibromas as standardized outcome measures in NF1 clinical trials. 
    The imaging devices function as clinical assessment tools for objective measurement of tumor 
    characteristics. Statistical analysis software (IBM SPSS) is also used, representing a 
    computational tool. Tools are expected and present in this publication.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were mined from this publication despite clear presence of research tools
    - Three 3D imaging devices (Vectra-H1, LifeViz-Micro, Cherry-Imaging) used as clinical assessment tools were completely missed
    - Statistical analysis software (IBM SPSS Statistics v27.01) was not captured as computational tool
    - Mining patterns appear inadequate for capturing clinical imaging devices and statistical software
  recommendations: |
    All four missed tools should be added to the database:
    1. Vectra-H1 (clinical assessment tool) - 3D imaging device for standardized outcome measurement
    2. LifeViz-Micro (clinical assessment tool) - 3D imaging device with fastest analysis time
    3. Cherry-Imaging (clinical assessment tool) - 3D imaging device best for uneven surfaces
    4. IBM SPSS Statistics v27.01 (computational tool) - statistical analysis software
    
    The mining patterns need significant improvement to capture:
    - 3D imaging systems used for clinical assessment
    - Statistical software with version numbers
    - Vendor information as tool indicators
    - Clinical measurement devices used as outcome measures
    
    This represents a major gap in clinical assessment tool detection, as the entire purpose 
    of this study was to evaluate these imaging devices as standardized tools for clinical trials.
