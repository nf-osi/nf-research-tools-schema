  title: "High resolution nerve ultrasound in neurofibromatosis type 1: a prospective and descriptive study."
  queryType: "bench"  # From PubMed query (hint only)
  publicationType: "Clinical Study"
  publicationTypeConfidence: 0.95
  hasMethodsSection: Yes
  likelyContainsTools: Yes
  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a clinical study examining high-resolution nerve ultrasound (HRUS) in NF1 patients.
    Expected tool types:
    - Clinical assessment tools: Medical Research Council scale (MRC), standardized clinical examination protocols
    - Computational tools: R studio for statistical analysis
    - Medical devices/equipment: Ultrasound machines (though these are typically not considered "research tools" in our schema)
    
    Note: While the queryType is "bench", this is clearly a clinical study. Clinical studies can contain
    computational tools for data analysis and clinical assessment tools for patient evaluation.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a prospective clinical study evaluating ultrasound imaging in NF1 patients. Clinical studies
    typically use clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, scales, outcome measures) and computational
    tools for statistical analysis. The Medical Research Council scale mentioned is a validated clinical
    assessment tool. R studio is a computational tool used for data analysis.

suggestedPatterns:
  - patternType: "term"
    pattern: "Medical Research Council scale|MRC scale"
    toolType: "clinical_assessment_tool"
    examples: ["Medical Research Council scale (MRC)"]
    reasoning: "The MRC scale is a widely used, validated clinical assessment tool for muscle strength grading. It should be captured as it's a standardized research instrument."

    pattern: "graded.*using|assessed.*using|measured.*using|administered.*using"
    toolType: "clinical_assessment_tool"
    examples: ["graded bilaterally using the Medical Research Council scale"]
    reasoning: "These phrases often indicate the use of clinical assessment tools or scales in patient evaluation."

  - patternType: "term"
    pattern: "R studio|RStudio"
    toolType: "computational_tool"
    examples: ["R studio version 4.4.1"]

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were mined from this publication despite it being a clinical study that uses research tools
    - The queryType "bench" is misleading - this is clearly a clinical study, not bench research
    - Two legitimate research tools were missed: Medical Research Council scale (clinical assessment tool) and R studio (computational tool)
    - The mining system may not be adequately capturing clinical assessment tools and computational tools in clinical studies
  recommendations: |
    - Add the Medical Research Council scale as a clinical assessment tool - it's a validated, standardized instrument
    - Add R studio as a computational tool - version number indicates actual usage for statistical analysis
    - Improve pattern matching for clinical assessment tools, especially standardized scales and grading systems
    - Enhance detection of computational tools mentioned with version numbers in methods sections
    - Consider that clinical studies (even those found by "bench" queries) can contain legitimate research tools
    - The ultrasound machines mentioned are medical devices rather than research tools and should not be added
