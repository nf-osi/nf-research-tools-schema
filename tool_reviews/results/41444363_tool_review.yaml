    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a preclinical animal study using transgenic mouse models to test focused ultrasound drug delivery.
    Expected tools include animal models (transgenic mice), antibodies (for immunohistology), computational tools
    (for image analysis), and potentially genetic reagents (transgenic constructs).
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a preclinical laboratory research study using transgenic mouse models to investigate focused ultrasound-mediated
    drug delivery for NF2-related schwannomatosis. The publication has a comprehensive Methods section describing animal
    procedures, imaging protocols, and histological analysis, indicating active use of research tools. Clinical assessment
    tools are unlikely given the animal model focus, but lab tools including animal models, antibodies, and computational
    analysis software are expected and present.

      Transgenic mice developed dorsal root ganglia (DRG) schwannomas that could be visualized and quantified
      using MRI with gadolinium contrast. Tumors were present at bilateral lumbar levels L1-L6 and were
      suitable for focused ultrasound targeting and drug delivery studies.

      Colony maintenance was compromised by high death rate due to inbreeding issues, which prevented
      randomized and blinded allocation of animals to treatment groups. This represents a significant
      limitation for experimental design and statistical analysis.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study with extensive Methods section
    - Multiple research tools are clearly present including transgenic mouse models, commercial antibodies, and imaging systems
    - Mining patterns appear to have missed standard laboratory tool nomenclature and vendor/catalog number formats
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains multiple legitimate research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The suggested patterns should be implemented to capture transgenic mouse nomenclature, antibody vendor formats,
    and imaging system models. All 6 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine research
    tools with proper experimental context. The observations extracted highlight both the utility and limitations
    of the animal model system. Future mining should include better coverage of preclinical research tool categories.
