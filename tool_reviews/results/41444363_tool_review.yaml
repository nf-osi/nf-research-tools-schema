    This is a preclinical animal study using transgenic mouse models to test focused ultrasound-mediated
    drug delivery. Expected tools include:
    - Animal models (transgenic mice with specific genetic modifications)
    - Genetic reagents (Cre-lox system components)
    - Antibodies (for immunohistochemistry)
    - Computational tools (for image analysis and statistics)
    - Potentially other lab reagents and equipment
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a clear laboratory research study using transgenic mouse models to investigate focused
    ultrasound-mediated drug delivery for NF2-related schwannomatosis. The study involves complex
    experimental procedures including animal breeding, genotyping, MRI imaging, focused ultrasound
    treatment, and histological analysis. Multiple research tools should be present including animal
    models, antibodies, genetic reagents, and computational tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Mining system completely failed to detect any tools despite this being a clear lab research study
    - Multiple obvious research tools present including transgenic mouse models, antibodies with catalog numbers, and computational software
    - Animal models with standard nomenclature (Cre-lox system) were not detected
    - Antibodies with vendor and catalog information were missed
    - Computational tools with version numbers were not captured
    - Research reagents and contrast agents were overlooked
  recommendations: |
    - ALL 14 identified tools should be added to the database as they represent genuine research tools
    - The mining patterns need significant improvement to capture:
      * Transgenic mouse nomenclature (Cre-lox systems)
      * Antibodies with vendor/catalog information
      * Computational software with version numbers
      * Research reagents and contrast agents
    - This publication demonstrates major gaps in the current mining system
    - Manual review of similar publications is recommended to identify additional missed tools
    - The suggested patterns should be implemented to improve future mining accuracy
    - No observations were extracted as no tools were initially validated, but this publication likely contains valuable phenotypic data that could be extracted after tools are properly identified
