    Review Article → Typically does not contain actual research tools used by the authors.
    Review articles cite and discuss tools used by other researchers but do not report
    original experimental work. This publication reviews 3D cancer models and tissue
    engineering methods but does not describe the authors conducting experiments with
    specific tools. Any tools mentioned would be citations from other studies rather
    than tools used in original research by these authors.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a review article that discusses various 3D cancer modeling approaches and tissue
    engineering methods. Review articles typically cite tools from other studies but do not
    report original experimental work using research tools. The absence of a Methods section
    and Results/Discussion sections confirms this is not an experimental study that would use
    research tools directly.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a review article, not original experimental research
    - No Methods section present, confirming lack of experimental procedures
    - No Results or Discussion sections with experimental findings
    - Content focuses on reviewing and citing work from other studies
    - Any tools mentioned are in the context of discussing other researchers' work
  recommendations: |
    This publication should not be expected to contain research tools as it is a review article.
    The mining correctly identified zero tools. The few potential tools identified (self-assembly
    method, ascorbate) are general methodologies or reagents discussed in the context of reviewing
    other work, not specific tools used by these authors. No tools should be added from this
    publication. The suggested patterns could help filter out similar review articles in future
    mining to reduce false positives.
