  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on publication type (Bioinformatics Analysis):
    - Computational tools (software, pipelines, analysis tools) - HIGHLY EXPECTED
    - Genetic reagents (DNA extraction kits, sequencing reagents) - EXPECTED
    - Laboratory equipment/instruments - EXPECTED
    
    This is a molecular diagnostics study using next-generation sequencing for NF1 gene analysis.
    The study involves DNA extraction, library preparation, sequencing, and bioinformatics analysis.
    Multiple computational tools and laboratory reagents should be present.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a bioinformatics/molecular diagnostics study that should contain multiple research tools.
    The study uses NGS technology with hybridization capture, requiring computational analysis software,
    DNA extraction kits, sequencing reagents, and bioinformatics tools. The fact that no tools were
    mined suggests significant under-detection of computational tools and laboratory reagents.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: No tools were mined from this publication despite it being a methods-heavy bioinformatics study
    - The publication contains extensive use of computational tools (19 identified) including:
      * NGS analysis software (Torrent Suite, TMAP, IGV, Alamut Visual)
      * Variant analysis tools (Ingenuity, SNPnexus, PolyPhen2, SIFT)
      * Splicing prediction tools (Human Splicing Finder)
      * Laboratory instruments (Ion Torrent PGM, NanoDrop, Qubit)
      * Genetic reagents (multiple kits and reagents)
    - This represents a major failure in tool detection for bioinformatics publications
    - The mining patterns appear to be inadequate for computational tools and laboratory reagents
  recommendations: |
    - ALL 19 identified tools should be added to the database - they are clearly legitimate research tools
    - The mining patterns need significant improvement for bioinformatics publications
    - Add vendor-based patterns to catch laboratory instruments and reagents
    - Add software-specific patterns to catch computational tools with version numbers
    - Add context phrases that indicate tool usage ("analyzed with", "performed using", etc.)
    - This publication type (bioinformatics analysis) should be prioritized for pattern development
    - Consider separate mining strategies for different publication types
    - No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated, but the identified tools could yield valuable usage information
