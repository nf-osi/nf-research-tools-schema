    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a laboratory neuroscience study investigating calcium currents and axonal growth in Nf1 haploinsufficient mice.
    Expected tools include animal models (Nf1+/- mice), antibodies (tau 1), computational tools (analysis software),
    and potentially cell lines (primary cultures). The comprehensive Methods section describes experimental procedures
    using multiple research tools across different categories.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study with extensive experimental methods investigating neurobiological mechanisms
    in Nf1 haploinsufficient mice. The publication contains detailed protocols for primary cell culture, 
    electrophysiology, neurotransmitter release assays, and morphological analysis, indicating high likelihood
    of containing multiple research tools including animal models, antibodies, and computational analysis software.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive laboratory research study
    - Multiple research tools are clearly present in the Methods section but were not detected
    - Animal models (Nf1+/- mice, C57BL/6J strain) are central to the study but missed
    - Antibodies, analysis software, and laboratory instruments are extensively used but not captured
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous research tools that should be captured. The animal models
    (Nf1+/- mice, C57BL/6J) are fundamental to the study and should definitely be added.
    The antibodies (tau 1), analysis software (ImageJ, Fitmaster, Origin8.1, Nikon Elements),
    and laboratory instruments represent legitimate research tools used in the experimental workflow.
    The suggested patterns would significantly improve mining coverage for neuroscience research tools.
    Manual curator review is recommended to validate the 10 potentially missed tools identified.
