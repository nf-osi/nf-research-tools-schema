  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a database/resource development paper describing the creation of the NF Research Tools Database.
    Expected tool types:
    - Computational tools (software, libraries, databases used in development)
    - Possibly references to external databases/resources that were integrated
    
    The paper describes building a web application and database system, so computational tools
    for development (React, MySQL, Python libraries) are expected. However, this is NOT a
    bench research paper using lab tools experimentally - it's about creating a database
    to catalog such tools for others to use.

  overallAssessment: |
    This publication describes the development of a database resource rather than experimental research.
    It would typically contain computational tools used for database development (MySQL, React, Python libraries)
    and references to external databases that were integrated. However, it would NOT contain experimental
    lab tools being used for research - instead it catalogs such tools for others to discover and use.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined from this publication, but several computational tools were missed
    - This is a database/resource development paper, not experimental bench research
    - The queryType "bench" is misleading - this should have been classified as bioinformatics/database development
    - Multiple computational tools used in database and web application development were not detected
  recommendations: |
    This publication should have computational tools added for the software and libraries used in development:
    - MySQL (database management system) - DEFINITELY add
    - schematic (Python library) - DEFINITELY add  
    - React (JavaScript library) - DEFINITELY add
    - Synapse React Client (specific client library) - DEFINITELY add
    - Synapse (collaborative platform) - DEFINITELY add
    - Python and R could be added but are more generic programming languages
    
    The mining patterns need improvement to catch computational tools in database/software development contexts.
    This paper demonstrates the need for better detection of development tools and platforms.
    
    No experimental observations were found since this is a resource development paper, not experimental research.
