    Clinical Study → clinical assessment tools (growth charts, developmental assessments), computational tools for statistical analysis
    This study develops NF1-specific growth charts and uses developmental assessment tools (SWYC), plus statistical software for analysis.
    Expected: clinical assessment tools, computational tools
  overallAssessment: |
    This clinical study develops NF1-specific growth charts and validates them against developmental outcomes. Clinical studies typically use assessment tools for patient evaluation and computational tools for statistical analysis. The study uses the Survey of Well-being of Young Children (SWYC) as a clinical assessment tool and various statistical software packages for data analysis, making it likely to contain research tools despite not being traditional lab research.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining failed to identify any tools despite this being a clinical study with clear tool usage
    - Clinical assessment tools (SWYC, CDC growth charts) were not recognized by current patterns
    - Computational tools for statistical analysis (GAMLSS, LMSz) were missed
    - Mining patterns appear optimized for lab research tools but miss clinical research tools
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains several important research tools that were completely missed by initial mining:
    - SWYC is a validated clinical assessment tool that should definitely be added
    - CDC growth charts are standardized clinical assessment tools
    - GAMLSS and LMSz are specialized computational tools for growth chart development
    - The R software mention includes a specific GitHub repository for custom functions
    - Mining patterns need improvement for clinical assessment tools and specialized statistical methods
    - No observations can be extracted since no tools were initially validated, but the study contains rich data about growth patterns and developmental outcomes that would be valuable if tools were properly identified
