  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining failed to capture any tools despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple clear research tools present including genetically engineered mouse models, cell lines, antibodies, and reagents
    - All tools have proper vendor information, catalog numbers, or detailed descriptions indicating genuine research usage
    - Methods section contains extensive experimental procedures supporting tool usage
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous legitimate research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    All 10 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine research tools with proper
    documentation and experimental usage context. The mouse model and cell line are particularly important
    as they are central to the study design. Mining patterns need significant improvement to capture
    genetically engineered mouse strains, cell lines with alphanumeric names, and reagents with vendor
    information. The observations extracted demonstrate meaningful scientific findings about tool performance
    and characteristics that would be valuable for the research community.
