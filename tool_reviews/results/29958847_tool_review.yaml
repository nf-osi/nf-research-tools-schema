    Clinical Study → computational tools for image analysis, clinical assessment tools for patient evaluation
    This study focuses on radiomic analysis of medical imaging data (MR, PET, CT) to distinguish malignant 
    from benign tumors in NF1 patients. Expected tools include:
    - Computational tools: image processing software, statistical analysis tools, registration pipelines
    - Clinical assessment tools: imaging protocols, diagnostic criteria
    - No lab research tools expected (no wet lab methods described)
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a clinical imaging study that develops computational methods for tumor classification in NF1 patients.
    The study uses medical imaging data and computational analysis pipelines, making computational tools highly likely.
    Clinical assessment tools may be present for patient evaluation and outcome measures.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a computational imaging study
    - Multiple computational tools clearly present in methods section were missed
    - Mining patterns appear insufficient for medical imaging and computational analysis tools
    - Statistical analysis methods and image processing algorithms not captured
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains multiple computational tools that should be added:
    - ITK and 3D Slicer are major medical imaging software platforms
    - Texture analysis methods (LTEM, GLRL, NGTM) are specialized computational tools
    - Statistical methods may be borderline but k-medoid clustering is specific enough to include
    - Mining patterns need improvement for computational tools in medical imaging context
    - No observations extracted as no tools were initially validated, but this study could provide
      usage insights for medical imaging tools in NF1 research
