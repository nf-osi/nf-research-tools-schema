    Clinical Study → clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, scales), computational tools for EEG analysis
    This longitudinal study examining auditory processing in NF1 infants would be expected to use:
    - Clinical assessment tools for measuring ASD traits, language development, and behavioral measures
    - Computational tools for EEG data processing and statistical analysis
    - Potentially specialized equipment for EEG recording (though hardware is not typically considered a "tool" in our context)
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a longitudinal clinical study examining auditory processing differences in infants with NF1. The study uses multiple validated clinical assessment instruments to measure developmental outcomes and behavioral traits. While it involves EEG recording, the focus is on clinical phenotyping rather than laboratory research. Clinical assessment tools are the primary research tools expected, along with computational tools for data analysis.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a clinical study with extensive use of validated assessment instruments
    - Multiple validated clinical assessment tools (MSEL, AOSI, IBQ-R, CDI) were used but not captured
    - The mining patterns appear to miss clinical assessment tools that don't follow traditional lab tool naming conventions
    - EEG equipment and statistical methods were also not captured
  recommendations: |
    - All 4 major clinical assessment tools (MSEL, AOSI, IBQ-R, CDI) should be added as they are validated instruments used for data collection
    - The mining patterns need improvement for clinical assessment tools, particularly those with full names followed by acronyms
    - Consider whether EEG equipment should be included as clinical assessment tools
    - Statistical methods like LMMs may be too generic to include unless they represent specialized NF-focused analysis pipelines
    - This publication demonstrates the need for better pattern recognition of clinical assessment instruments in developmental/behavioral studies
