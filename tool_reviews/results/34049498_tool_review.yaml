  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a clinical neurodevelopmental study examining auditory processing in infants with NF1.
    Expected tool types:
    - Clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, scales, developmental assessments) - HIGHLY LIKELY
    - Computational tools (EEG analysis software, statistical analysis) - LIKELY
    - Lab research tools are NOT expected as this is not a molecular/cellular biology study
    
    The study uses standardized developmental and behavioral assessments which are valid research tools
    even though this was found via "bench" query. Clinical studies routinely use validated assessment
    instruments as research tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    This clinical study examines auditory processing differences in infants with NF1 using EEG and standardized
    developmental assessments. Clinical assessment tools (MSEL, AOSI, IBQ-R, CDI) are legitimate research tools
    used to measure developmental outcomes and behavioral traits. The study also likely uses computational tools
    for EEG processing and statistical analysis, though specific software details may be limited.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Multiple standardized clinical assessment tools were completely missed by mining
    - All 4 major clinical assessment tools (MSEL, AOSI, IBQ-R, CDI) used in this study were not detected
    - EEG recording system with vendor/model specifications was missed
    - Mining patterns appear inadequate for clinical assessment tools despite "bench" query finding this paper
    - This represents a significant gap in tool detection for clinical neurodevelopmental research
  recommendations: |
    - ADD all 4 clinical assessment tools (MSEL, AOSI, IBQ-R, CDI) - these are legitimate, standardized research instruments
    - ADD EGI EEG system as computational tool with vendor/model specifications
    - IMPLEMENT suggested patterns to improve detection of clinical assessment tools
    - Clinical studies use validated assessment instruments as research tools even if found via "bench" queries
    - Consider that "standardised measure", "standardised assessment" are strong indicators of research tools
    - Mining patterns need significant improvement for clinical assessment tool detection
    - This publication demonstrates that clinical studies contain legitimate research tools that current mining misses
