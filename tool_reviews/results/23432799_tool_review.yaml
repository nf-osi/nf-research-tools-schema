  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a questionnaire/survey development study focused on creating and validating a health-related quality of life (HRQOL) instrument for NF1 patients. Expected tool types:
    - Clinical assessment tools (the PedsQL NF1 Module being developed and validated)
    - Computational tools (statistical software for psychometric analysis - SPSS, SAS mentioned)
    
    This study involves instrument development methodology including focus groups, cognitive interviews, pilot testing, and field testing with 134 adults with NF1. The primary deliverable is a validated clinical assessment tool.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication describes the development and validation of a disease-specific quality of life assessment instrument (PedsQL NF1 Module). As a questionnaire development study, it would be expected to contain clinical assessment tools as the primary research output. The study includes rigorous psychometric validation methods and statistical analysis, so computational tools for data analysis are also expected.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a questionnaire development study
    - The primary research output (PedsQL NF1 Module) was completely missed
    - Multiple existing PedsQL modules used as source material were not detected
    - Clinical assessment tools are not being adequately captured by current mining patterns
  recommendations: |
    This publication should have multiple clinical assessment tools added:
    - The newly developed PedsQL™ NF1 Module is the primary research deliverable and should definitely be included
    - The existing PedsQL modules used as source material should also be included as they were actively used in the development process
    - Mining patterns need improvement for clinical assessment tools, particularly PedsQL instruments
    - No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated, but the publication contains extensive psychometric validation data that would be valuable once tools are properly identified
    - This represents a significant gap in clinical assessment tool detection that should be addressed
