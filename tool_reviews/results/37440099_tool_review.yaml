    Clinical Trial → clinical assessment tools for measuring patient-reported outcomes and resilience factors.
    This study used multiple validated questionnaires and scales to assess coping, mindfulness, gratitude, 
    optimism, and social support. These are legitimate clinical assessment tools even though no traditional
    lab methods are present. The study design (randomized clinical trial) inherently requires standardized
    outcome measurement instruments.
  overallAssessment: |
    This randomized clinical trial would definitely use clinical assessment tools to measure patient outcomes.
    The study tested a mind-body resilience program and measured multiple resilience factors using validated
    questionnaires and scales. Clinical assessment tools are essential for this type of intervention study
    to quantify treatment effects on psychological and behavioral outcomes.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    Major mining failure - 5 validated clinical assessment tools were completely missed:
    - All tools are legitimate, validated clinical assessment instruments
    - Tools were clearly mentioned in context of outcome measurement
    - Current mining patterns appear inadequate for clinical assessment tools
    - This represents a significant gap in clinical tool detection capability
  recommendations: |
    CRITICAL: This publication demonstrates major gaps in clinical assessment tool mining:
    
    1. ADD ALL 5 MISSED TOOLS: All identified tools are validated clinical assessment instruments
       that should be included in the research tools database
    
    2. IMPLEMENT SUGGESTED PATTERNS: The 5 new patterns would significantly improve detection
       of clinical assessment tools with complex naming conventions
    
    3. REVIEW CLINICAL TOOL PATTERNS: Current patterns appear focused on lab tools and miss
       many clinical assessment instruments with descriptive names
    
    4. VALIDATE PATTERN EFFECTIVENESS: Test new patterns against other clinical publications
       to ensure they don't create false positives
    
    5. CONSIDER CLINICAL CONTEXT: Clinical trials and intervention studies routinely use
       validated assessment tools that should be captured systematically
    
    This publication type (clinical trial) is exactly where clinical assessment tools should
    be found, and the complete mining failure indicates systematic pattern deficiencies.
