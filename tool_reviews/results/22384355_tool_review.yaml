  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on publication type (Bioinformatics Analysis - database development):
    - Computational tools (software, databases, web applications, programming languages)
    - Potentially genetic reagents (reference sequences, gene variants)
    
    This publication describes the development of a web-based database for SPRED1 gene variants.
    The methods section describes various computational tools and technologies used for database
    construction, web development, and data management. While it's not traditional lab research,
    it involves significant computational tool usage for bioinformatics database development.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication describes the development of a web-based mutation database for SPRED1 gene variants
    in Legius syndrome. While not traditional lab research, it involves substantial computational tool
    usage including databases (MySQL), web technologies (PHP, Apache), analysis tools (Mutalyzer),
    and graphics software (FusionCharts). The publication should contain multiple computational tools
    used in database development and maintenance.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Mining completely missed this publication type: database/bioinformatics tool development
    - No computational tools were detected despite extensive use of databases, programming languages, and web technologies
    - Publication contains detailed methods section describing multiple software tools with versions and URLs
    - Current mining patterns appear to focus on traditional lab tools but miss bioinformatics/computational tools
  recommendations: |
    This publication was significantly under-mined. It contains multiple computational tools that should have been detected:
    - MySQL (database management system)
    - PHP (programming language for web development)  
    - FusionCharts v3 (graphics software with version)
    - Apache (web server)
    - phpmyadmin (database administration tool)
    - Mutalyzer 2.0 (bioinformatics validation tool)
    - PubMed (literature database)
    
    The mining patterns need significant enhancement for bioinformatics/database development publications.
    These tools are clearly used for research purposes (database development and maintenance) and should be captured.
    
    All suggested tools should be added to improve coverage of computational tool types.
    The suggested patterns would help catch similar tools in future database/bioinformatics publications.
    
    Five usage instruction observations were extracted describing how each tool was implemented in the database development process.
