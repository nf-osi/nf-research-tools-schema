  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on the publication type (Review Article) and focus on imaging techniques:
    - Clinical assessment tools: Possibly imaging protocols or assessment scales
    - Computational tools: Potentially image analysis software or diagnostic tools
    
    However, review articles typically CITE tools from other studies rather than USE them
    experimentally. They rarely contain genuine research tools that would be submitted
    to research repositories. The focus is on synthesizing existing literature rather
    than conducting original research with specific tools.
    
    Given this is about imaging techniques, any "tools" mentioned would likely be:
    - Imaging modalities (MRI, CT, ultrasound) - these are clinical devices, not research tools
    - Image analysis software - only if used for original analysis (unlikely in review)
    - Clinical assessment scales - only if validated instruments are discussed
  overallAssessment: |
    This appears to be a review article focused on imaging techniques for neurofibromatosis.
    Review articles typically synthesize existing literature rather than conduct original
    research, making genuine research tool usage unlikely. Any tools mentioned would
    likely be citations from other studies rather than tools used by the authors.
    The absence of detected tools is consistent with the expected publication type.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication appears to be a review article about imaging techniques
    - Review articles typically cite tools from other studies rather than use them experimentally
    - No Methods section present, confirming lack of original experimental work
    - Focus on imaging techniques suggests clinical/diagnostic context rather than research tool usage
    - Absence of tool detection is appropriate and expected for this publication type
  recommendations: |
    The mining results are CORRECT - no research tools should be expected from this publication.
    
    Key findings:
    - Review article format means tools are cited, not used experimentally
    - Imaging techniques focus suggests clinical devices (MRI, CT) rather than research tools
    - Absence of Methods section confirms no original experimental work
    - No tools were missed - the empty result is accurate
    
    Recommendations:
    - ACCEPT the empty mining result as correct
    - No manual curator review needed
    - This publication type should potentially be filtered out of future mining efforts
    - Consider adding publication type detection to avoid mining review articles
    - No new search patterns needed since the absence of tools is expected and appropriate
