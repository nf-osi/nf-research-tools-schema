    This is a comprehensive lab research study with extensive molecular biology methods including:
    - Animal models (Periostin-CRE mice, NF2 fl/fl mice)
    - Cell lines and primary cultures (human schwannoma cultures, normal Schwann cells)
    - Antibodies (for Western blot, immunohistochemistry, ChIP-seq)
    - Computational tools (extensive bioinformatics pipeline: Seurat, Scanpy, Cell Ranger, etc.)
    - Genetic reagents (various constructs and reagents)
    
    The publication contains detailed protocols for single-cell RNA sequencing, chromatin accessibility,
    spatial transcriptomics, immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and other molecular techniques.
    This type of study should contain dozens of research tools across multiple categories.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication is a comprehensive molecular biology study that should contain numerous research tools.
    The extensive Methods section describes detailed protocols using animal models, cell cultures, antibodies,
    and computational analysis pipelines. The complete absence of mined tools (0 tools found) indicates
    a significant mining failure rather than a lack of tools in the publication.

    CRITICAL MINING FAILURE: This comprehensive lab research study contains numerous research tools
    but the mining system captured ZERO tools. Major issues identified:
    
    - Complete failure to capture animal models (Periostin-CRE mice, NF2 fl/fl mice)
    - Missed all computational tools (Seurat, Scanpy, Cell Ranger, QuPath) despite explicit versions
    - Failed to identify antibodies with catalog numbers (anti-pan-TEAD #13295, anti-YAP 4912S)
    - Did not capture cell lines and primary cultures (patient-derived cells S2290, S2348, S2470)
    - Missed genetic reagents and chemical compounds (VT3989, Human Tumor Dissociation Kit)
    - No recognition of commercial kits and instruments (10X Genomics Chromium, gentleMACS)
    
    This represents a systematic failure across ALL tool categories in a publication that should
    have yielded 15+ high-confidence research tools.
  recommendations: |
    URGENT MINING SYSTEM REVIEW REQUIRED:
    
    1. IMMEDIATE ACTION: This publication should be completely re-mined with improved patterns
    2. PATTERN UPDATES: Implement the 7 suggested patterns to capture missed tool types
    3. SYSTEM VALIDATION: Test mining system on similar molecular biology publications
    4. QUALITY CONTROL: Establish minimum tool thresholds for lab research publications
    
    This publication demonstrates that the current mining system has significant gaps in:
    - Animal model nomenclature (genetic strain notation)
    - Bioinformatics software recognition (R/Python packages)
    - Antibody identification (catalog number patterns)
    - Cell line naming conventions (patient-derived identifiers)
    - Chemical compound recognition (VT-series compounds)
    
    The complete absence of tools from such a tool-rich publication indicates fundamental
    issues with the mining patterns and algorithms that need immediate attention.
