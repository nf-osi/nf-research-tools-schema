  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a genomics/bioinformatics study involving whole-exome sequencing and computational analysis.
    Expected tool types:
    - Computational tools (software, pipelines, databases) - HIGHLY EXPECTED
    - Genetic reagents (sequencing kits, DNA extraction kits) - HIGHLY EXPECTED
    - Lab instruments/platforms (sequencers, analyzers) - EXPECTED
    
    The study involves extensive bioinformatics analysis using multiple software tools and databases,
    plus laboratory reagents for DNA extraction and sequencing library preparation. This type of
    publication typically contains numerous computational tools and genetic reagents.
  overallAssessment: |
    This genomics research publication should contain numerous research tools, particularly computational
    tools and genetic reagents. The detailed Methods section describes extensive use of bioinformatics
    software, databases, and laboratory kits. The complete absence of mined tools (0 total) indicates
    a significant failure in the mining process, as this publication clearly uses many research tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Complete mining failure - 0 tools detected despite publication containing numerous clear research tools
    - Missing 10+ computational tools with explicit version numbers and usage context
    - Missing 3+ genetic reagents (commercial kits with catalog numbers)
    - Missing major databases and web applications (GEPIA, GDC Portal, cBioPortal)
    - Mining patterns appear inadequate for genomics/bioinformatics publications
    - No Results or Discussion sections available for observation extraction
  recommendations: |
    - URGENT: All 15 identified tools should be added to the mining results
    - Implement suggested patterns to catch software with version numbers
    - Add patterns for commercial kits with catalog numbers
    - Include database/portal detection patterns
    - Review mining algorithm for genomics publications - this represents a major gap
    - Consider this publication as a test case for improving computational tool detection
    - The 6 suggested patterns would have caught most of the missed tools
    - No observations could be extracted due to missing Results/Discussion sections
