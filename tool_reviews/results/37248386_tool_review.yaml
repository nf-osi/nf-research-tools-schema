  overallAssessment: |
    Cannot perform tool validation assessment. The required input file containing publication metadata,
    abstract text, full text sections, and mined tools list was not found in the expected location.
    To complete this analysis, the input JSON file must be provided with the publication content and
    mined tools data.

    CRITICAL ISSUE: Input file not found
    - The required input file 37248386_input.json was not located in the expected directory
    - Cannot perform tool validation without publication metadata, text content, and mined tools list
    - File system search confirmed the file does not exist in the current repository
  recommendations: |
    To complete the tool validation for PMID 37248386:
    1. Verify the correct location of the input file
    2. Ensure the input JSON file contains all required fields:
       - Publication metadata (PMID, title, DOI, journal, year, queryType)
       - Abstract text
       - Full text sections (Methods, Introduction, Results, Discussion)
       - List of mined tools with their types and context
    3. Re-run the validation process once the input file is available
    
    Without the input data, no meaningful tool validation, pattern suggestions, or 
    observation extraction can be performed.
