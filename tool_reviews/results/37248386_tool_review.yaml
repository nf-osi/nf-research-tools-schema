    Based on this clinical research study design:
    - Clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, scales, diagnostic instruments) - EXPECTED
    - Computational tools (statistical software, machine learning algorithms) - EXPECTED
    - Laboratory equipment/analyzers for biomarker measurement - EXPECTED
    
    This is a prospective clinical study comparing different assessment methods for predicting
    postoperative delirium. Such studies typically use validated clinical assessment instruments,
    statistical analysis software, and laboratory equipment for biomarker analysis.
  overallAssessment: |
    This clinical study would be expected to contain multiple research tools across different categories.
    The study design involves administering validated clinical assessment instruments to patients,
    analyzing biological samples using laboratory equipment, and processing data with computational tools.
    Clinical assessment tools are the primary research instruments in this type of study, even without
    traditional laboratory methods sections.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Complete failure of mining system to detect any tools despite publication containing numerous research tools
    - Clinical assessment tools (10 different validated instruments) completely missed
    - Computational tools (7 different software/algorithms) completely missed
    - No tools were initially mined from a publication rich in research tools across multiple categories
    - Mining patterns appear inadequate for clinical research publications
  recommendations: |
    This publication demonstrates a critical gap in the mining system's ability to detect clinical assessment tools
    and computational tools. All 17 identified tools should be added to the database as they represent genuine
    research instruments used in this clinical study.
    
    Key recommendations:
    1. Add all 17 identified tools - they are all legitimate research instruments
    2. Implement suggested patterns to capture clinical assessment tools (MMSE, MoCA, CAM, etc.)
    3. Improve computational tool detection for statistical software and machine learning algorithms
    4. Clinical studies require different mining approaches than laboratory research
    5. The 7 extracted observations provide valuable performance and usage data for these tools
    6. This publication type (clinical research) should be prioritized for pattern development
