    Clinical Trial → clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, scales), computational tools for analysis, 
    animal models for preclinical studies, cell lines for mechanistic studies, antibodies for biomarker analysis.
    This publication combines clinical trial data with extensive preclinical research, so multiple tool types
    are expected including clinical assessment tools, animal models, cell lines, antibodies, and computational tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a phase 2 clinical trial with extensive preclinical components, making it highly likely to contain
    multiple research tool types. The clinical component uses validated assessment tools (NRS-11, BPI-PI, PedsQL),
    while preclinical studies use mouse models, cell lines, and antibodies. Computational tools are used for
    statistical analysis and biomarker assessment.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive clinical trial with extensive preclinical components
    - Multiple validated research tools are clearly present including animal models, cell lines, antibodies, clinical assessment tools, and computational software
    - The mining system appears to have missed standard tool naming patterns and clinical assessment instruments
  recommendations: |
    All 13 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine research tools with clear experimental usage:
    - Animal model (Nf1flox/flox;PostnCre mice) used in preclinical studies
    - Cell line (iPNF95.6) used for apoptosis assays
    - Clinical assessment tools (NRS-11, BPI-PI, PedsQL) used for patient outcomes
    - Antibodies with catalog numbers used for immunohistochemistry and Western blots
    - Computational tools with versions used for data analysis
    The suggested patterns should be implemented to improve detection of similar tools in future mining.
    Five scientific observations were extracted covering tumor growth, cellular responses, and clinical assessment tool usage.
