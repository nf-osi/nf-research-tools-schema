  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on publication type (Clinical Trial):
    - Clinical assessment tools → Expected (primary outcome measures, quality of life scales, symptom assessments)
    - Computational tools → Possible (statistical analysis software for trial data)
    - Lab tools → Unlikely (phase 2 trials focus on clinical outcomes, not lab research)
    
    Clinical trials typically use validated assessment instruments to measure:
    - Primary endpoints (tumor response, progression-free survival)
    - Secondary endpoints (quality of life, functional outcomes, pain scales)
    - Safety assessments (adverse event scales, performance status)
    - Patient-reported outcomes (symptom questionnaires)
    
    Note: Even without a traditional Methods section, clinical trials contain detailed protocols
    describing assessment tools and statistical methods in supplementary materials or trial registrations.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a phase 2 clinical trial testing cabozantinib for NF1 plexiform neurofibromas. Clinical trials
    routinely use validated assessment tools to measure outcomes, including tumor response criteria, quality
    of life instruments, pain scales, and functional assessments. The absence of full text sections limits
    tool detection, but clinical assessment tools are highly expected in this publication type.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    Major issues identified during review:
    - Limited text availability: Only partial abstract provided, no full text sections
    - No mined tools: Mining returned empty results despite high likelihood of clinical assessment tools
    - Missing Methods section: Clinical trial protocols typically describe assessment instruments
    - Incomplete data: Cannot perform thorough validation without full publication content
    - High false negative risk: Clinical assessment tools likely present but not detected
  recommendations: |
    Overall recommendations for this publication:
    - HIGH PRIORITY: Obtain full text to identify clinical assessment tools (RECIST, CTCAE, QoL scales)
    - Clinical trials routinely use validated instruments that should be captured
    - Consider supplementary materials and trial registration for complete methodology
    - Implement suggested patterns to improve detection of clinical assessment tools
    - Manual curator review recommended due to limited text availability
    - This publication type (phase 2 trial) has high probability of containing valid clinical tools
    - Focus mining efforts on outcome measures, safety assessments, and patient-reported outcomes
