    This is a genetic linkage analysis study from 1989 that used computational methods to analyze genetic data.
    Expected tool types:
    - Computational tools (specifically mentions CRI-MAP software for linkage analysis)
    - Genetic reagents (DNA markers, probes mentioned in the analysis)
    
    While the queryType is "bench", this is primarily a bioinformatics/computational genetics study
    that analyzed existing genetic data rather than conducting wet lab experiments.
  overallAssessment: |
    This 1989 linkage analysis study would be expected to contain computational tools (CRI-MAP software is explicitly mentioned)
    and potentially genetic reagents (DNA markers/probes used for genotyping). The study analyzed genetic data from 142 families
    using 31 markers and performed 13,838 genotypings, indicating substantial computational analysis. However, the lack of a
    Methods section limits detailed tool identification.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite clear evidence of computational and genetic reagent usage
    - Publication from 1989 may have been missed due to older terminology and naming conventions
    - Only abstract available - full Methods section would likely contain more detailed tool information
    - Multiple genetic markers (DNA probes) used in linkage analysis were not captured
    - CRI-MAP software explicitly mentioned but not identified as computational tool
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains significant missed tools that should be added:
    - CRI-MAP computational software should definitely be added as it's explicitly mentioned
    - Multiple genetic markers (pA10-41, EW301, p17H8, pHHH202, EW206, EW207, EW203, CRI-L581, CRI-L946) should be added
    - The mining patterns need improvement for older genetics publications and marker naming conventions
    - Consider adding patterns for genetic linkage analysis terminology
    - This demonstrates that publications from the 1980s-1990s may be systematically under-mined due to different terminology
    - The suggested patterns would significantly improve capture of genetic markers and linkage analysis tools
