  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining failed to capture any tools despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple cell lines with standard nomenclature were missed
    - Commercial reagents and specialized equipment not detected
    - 3D culture systems (advanced cellular models) not identified
    - Image analysis software tools not captured
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    All 12 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine research tools used in experiments.
    The cell lines (ipNF95.11b C, ipNF95.11b C-RFP, ipNF 05.5) are well-characterized NF research tools.
    The 3D culture system represents an advanced cellular model that should be captured.
    Software tools like Volocity and ImageJ are computational tools used for analysis.
    The suggested patterns would significantly improve mining accuracy for similar NF research publications.
    No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated, but this study likely contains valuable phenotypic data.
