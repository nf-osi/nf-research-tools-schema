    Review Article → Typically does not contain actual research tools, but may mention:
    - Computational tools used in cited studies (software, analysis pipelines)
    - Clinical assessment tools discussed in literature review
    - Imaging techniques/protocols (though these are methods, not tools)
    
    This publication discusses various MRI techniques and imaging approaches but appears to be
    a comprehensive review rather than original research. While the abstract suggests patient
    data analysis, the lack of Methods and Results sections, combined with the broad scope
    of the introduction and discussion, indicates this is a review article synthesizing
    existing literature on advanced MRI techniques for glioma imaging.
  overallAssessment: |
    This appears to be a review article about advanced MRI techniques for glioma imaging,
    despite an abstract that suggests original patient data analysis. The absence of Methods
    and Results sections, combined with the comprehensive discussion of multiple imaging
    modalities, strongly indicates this is a literature review rather than original research.
    Review articles typically do not develop or experimentally use research tools, though
    they may reference tools used in cited studies.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication appears to be a review article despite abstract suggesting original research
    - No Methods or Results sections present, indicating no experimental work
    - Content focuses on comprehensive literature review of MRI techniques
    - Imaging techniques mentioned (MRF, fMRI, PWI, CEST) are protocols/methods, not specific software tools
    - Statistical methods mentioned generically without software implementation details
  recommendations: |
    This publication should not contribute any research tools to the database. It appears to be
    a review article discussing various MRI imaging techniques for glioma characterization.
    While the abstract mentions patient data and statistical analysis, the lack of Methods
    and Results sections, combined with the broad literature review format, indicates this
    is not original research that would develop or experimentally use specific research tools.
    
    The imaging techniques mentioned (MRF, fMRI, PWI, CEST) are methodological approaches
    rather than specific software implementations. Future mining should better distinguish
    between imaging protocols/techniques and actual computational tools with specific
    software names, versions, or vendors.
    
    No tools were missed that should be added to the database. The mining correctly
    identified this as a publication without specific research tools.
