  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on the publication type (Lab Research) and focus on genetic mouse models of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors:
    - Animal models (genetic mouse strains, knockout/transgenic mice)
    - Cell lines (potentially derived from tumors or normal tissue)
    - Genetic reagents (constructs, vectors, primers)
    - Antibodies (for immunohistochemistry, Western blot)
    - Computational tools (for data analysis, statistical software)
    
    This is a laboratory research study developing and characterizing a genetic mouse model,
    which typically involves multiple research tools across several categories.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research publication focused on developing and characterizing a genetic mouse model
    for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Such studies typically use extensive research tools including
    animal models, antibodies for tissue analysis, cell culture systems, and computational tools for data analysis.
    The absence of any mined tools is highly suspicious and suggests significant under-mining of research tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Zero tools were mined from a laboratory research publication about genetic mouse models
    - Title explicitly mentions "genetic mouse model" which should be captured as an animal model tool
    - This appears to be a significant under-mining issue rather than a publication without tools
    - Laboratory research on genetic mouse models typically uses multiple tool categories
  recommendations: |
    - URGENT: This publication requires complete re-mining with improved patterns
    - The title alone contains at least one clear animal model tool that was missed
    - Genetic mouse model publications typically contain multiple research tools including:
      * Specific mouse strain names and genetic backgrounds
      * Antibodies for immunohistochemistry and protein analysis
      * Cell lines derived from tumors or normal tissue
      * Molecular biology reagents (primers, constructs, vectors)
      * Computational tools for statistical analysis
    - Recommend manual curator review to identify all missed tools
    - Update mining patterns to better capture genetic mouse model terminology
    - This case highlights need for improved animal model detection patterns
