  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study developing and characterizing genetic mouse models for MPNST.
    Expected tool types include:
    - Animal models (multiple genetically engineered mouse strains)
    - Antibodies (for immunostaining and Western blot)
    - Genetic reagents (conditional alleles, Cre lines, tamoxifen)
    - Computational tools (RNA-seq analysis software, statistical packages)
    - Cell lines (SW10 Schwann cell line mentioned)
    
    The extensive Methods section describes histology, immunostaining, Western blot, RNA sequencing, and 
    bioinformatics analysis, indicating heavy use of research tools across multiple categories.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication is a classic laboratory research study that extensively uses research tools for model development
    and characterization. The comprehensive Methods section describes animal breeding, histopathology, molecular biology,
    and bioinformatics approaches. Multiple research tool categories are expected and should be present throughout the text.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive laboratory research study
    - The publication extensively describes mouse strains, antibodies, reagents, and computational tools
    - Multiple Jackson Laboratory mouse strains with stock numbers were completely missed
    - RNA-seq analysis pipeline tools (STAR, RSEM, limma, ComBat, UMAP) were not detected
    - Commercial reagent kits with vendor names were not captured
    - Cell line (SW10) was not identified
    - This represents a major failure of the initial mining process
  recommendations: |
    ALL MISSED TOOLS SHOULD BE ADDED - this appears to be a complete mining failure for a tool-rich publication.
    
    Specific recommendations:
    1. Add all 15 identified missed tools - they have clear experimental usage context and vendor/catalog information
    2. Implement the 6 suggested patterns to catch similar tools in future mining
    3. Review mining algorithms for Jackson Laboratory stock numbers and vendor-specific patterns
    4. Ensure RNA-seq analysis tools are properly captured when mentioned with usage context
    5. Add patterns for commercial kit detection with vendor names in parentheses
    
    The 6 scientific observations extracted demonstrate the value of this publication for understanding different 
    mouse model phenotypes and tumor characteristics. The observations include quantitative tumor growth data 
    and cellular/molecular findings that would be valuable for the research community.
    
    This publication is an excellent example of comprehensive tool usage in laboratory research and should serve 
    as a benchmark for improving mining accuracy.
