  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were mined from this publication despite it being a comprehensive laboratory research study with extensive use of computational tools and genetic reagents
    - The mining system completely failed to capture any of the numerous tools described in the detailed Methods section
    - Multiple computational tools (Torrent Suite, IGV, SIFT, PolyPhen2, Coffalyser, Genotyper, Autoassembler) were missed
    - Several genetic reagents and kits (PUREGENE kit, Ion AmpliSeq libraries, SALSA MLPA kit, AMPure beads, Big Dye Terminator kit) were not captured
    - The Ion PGM sequencing platform, a major instrument, was not detected
  recommendations: |
    This publication represents a significant failure of the mining system. All 13 identified tools should be added to the database as they are clearly genuine research tools used in experimental procedures. The mining patterns need substantial improvement to capture:
    1. Bioinformatics software with version numbers and vendor information
    2. Commercial molecular biology kits and reagents with catalog numbers
    3. Sequencing platforms and specialized diagnostic instruments
    4. Context phrases indicating software usage ("using", "analyzed with", "performed using")
    5. Vendor information in parentheses following tool names
    
    The observations extracted demonstrate proper usage context and experimental details. This publication should serve as a test case for improving mining pattern coverage for molecular diagnostics studies.
