      Nude mice successfully supported growth of human vestibular schwannoma xenografts when implanted in interscapular fat pad.
      Tumors were distinguishable by T2-weighted MRI sequences and demonstrated measurable growth over 12-week treatment period.
      Control tumors showed slight growth during the treatment period, confirming viability of the xenograft model.

      Erlotinib (50 mg/kg by gavage, 5 days/week) significantly reduced vestibular schwannoma xenograft growth (p < 0.05).
      Unlike trastuzumab, erlotinib resulted in significant increase in apoptotic cell death as measured by TUNEL-positive cells (p < 0.01).
      This suggests erlotinib acts through different mechanism than trastuzumab in reducing tumor growth.

      ImageJ software was used for tumor volume measurements from MRI images. Surface area of tumors was determined on sequential images using the measurement tool.
      Measurements were repeated three times in both axial and sagittal planes, and average tumor surface area was multiplied by slice thickness (0.5 mm) to calculate slice volume.
      Reviewer was blinded to experimental group during measurements to ensure objectivity.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining completely missed all research tools despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple tool categories present: animal models, patient-derived models, therapeutic reagents, antibodies, computational tools
    - All tools have clear experimental usage context with vendor information and experimental parameters
    - This represents a significant failure of the initial mining system to detect standard research tools
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous high-quality research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    All 8 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine research tools with clear experimental usage.
    The suggested patterns should be implemented to catch similar tools in future mining efforts.
    This case highlights the need for better pattern coverage for xenograft studies, therapeutic compounds, and imaging analysis tools.
    The observations extracted demonstrate clear experimental outcomes and tool performance data valuable for researchers.
