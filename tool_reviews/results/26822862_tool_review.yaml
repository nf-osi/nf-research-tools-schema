    Based on publication type (Bioinformatics Analysis):
    - Computational tools (software, statistical packages, modeling frameworks) - EXPECTED
    - Mathematical modeling software or custom computational models - EXPECTED
    - Statistical analysis software - EXPECTED
    - High-performance computing resources - POSSIBLE
    
    NOT expected for this publication type:
    - Lab research tools (antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents) - NOT EXPECTED
    - Advanced cellular models (organoids, assembloids) - NOT EXPECTED  
    - Patient-derived models (PDX) - NOT EXPECTED
    - Clinical assessment tools - NOT EXPECTED
    
    This is a pure computational modeling study that simulates biological processes mathematically
    rather than using actual biological materials or clinical instruments.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a computational modeling study that uses mathematical simulations to investigate bone healing
    in Neurofibromatosis Type 1. The study develops and applies a multiscale computational model using
    partial differential equations and agent-based modeling approaches. Computational tools for statistical
    analysis and modeling are expected and appropriate for this publication type. No wet lab tools or
    clinical assessment instruments would be expected since this is purely computational research.

    details: |
      JMP software was used for Design of Experiments (DOE) analysis with a uniform design of 200 runs
      to generate parameter combinations across an eight-dimensional parameter space. The software
      implemented Gaussian process modeling with Gaussian covariance function for statistical analysis.
      The analysis identified main effects of parameters on fracture healing outcomes and generated
      marginal model plots for detailed interpretation of results.
    foundIn: "methods"
    contextSnippet: "The uniform designs were generated and analysed with JMP (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA) using a Gaussian process with a Gaussian covariance function. Unlike an ANOVA-type of analysis, Gaussian processes do not only estimate the importance of individual parameters, but also the influence of the parameters on the outcome of a model."

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined from this computational study, but one legitimate computational tool (JMP) was missed
    - The publication is a pure computational modeling study, so the absence of lab research tools is expected and correct
    - Mining patterns need improvement to capture statistical software with vendor information
    - The queryType "bench" is misleading - this is not bench research but computational analysis
  recommendations: |
    - ADD the missed tool: JMP statistical analysis software should be included as a legitimate computational tool
    - IMPROVE mining patterns to capture commercial software with vendor details in parentheses
    - CONSIDER that computational modeling studies may use fewer but highly specialized analysis tools
    - The absence of other tool types (antibodies, cell lines, etc.) is CORRECT for this publication type
    - Future mining should distinguish between wet lab "bench" research and computational "bench" modeling
    - The extracted usage instructions provide valuable information about DOE methodology implementation
