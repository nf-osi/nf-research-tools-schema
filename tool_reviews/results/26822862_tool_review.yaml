    This is a computational modeling study using mathematical simulations to study NF1-related fracture healing.
    Expected tools include computational modeling software, statistical analysis packages, and high-performance computing resources.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a computational modeling study that uses mathematical simulations and statistical analysis to examine NF1 mutation effects on bone healing.
    The study would typically use computational tools, statistical software, and modeling platforms.
    While no traditional lab tools are expected, computational tools for modeling, simulation, and statistical analysis are highly likely.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a computational study
    - Several computational tools and platforms were used but not captured by mining patterns
    - JMP statistical software was excluded as generic statistical software
    - Custom computational models and HPC resources were not detected
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains legitimate computational tools that were missed by initial mining.
    The custom bone regeneration computational model should be added as it's a specialized research tool.
    VSC supercomputer infrastructure could be considered for inclusion as HPC resources are important for computational studies.
    JMP was correctly excluded as generic statistical software.
    DOE methodology is borderline - more of a statistical approach than a specific tool.
    Future mining should better capture custom computational models and simulation platforms.
