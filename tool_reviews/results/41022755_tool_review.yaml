  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Mining patterns appear to have missed numerous standard research tools including:
      * Multiple cell lines with standard nomenclature (pNF9511bc, ST88-14, LN229, etc.)
      * Animal models (NSG mice)
      * Antibodies with catalog numbers
      * Genetic reagents (AAV vectors, plasmids)
      * Patient-derived models (PDX lines)
      * Advanced cellular models (neurofibromaspheres)
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains extensive research tools that were completely missed by initial mining. The suggested patterns should be implemented to capture:
    - Standard cell line nomenclature patterns
    - Patient-derived model terminology
    - AAV vector naming conventions
    - 3D culture model terms
    - Context phrases for immortalized cell lines
    All 15 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine research tools with high confidence scores (0.90-0.95). The mining system needs significant improvement for NF research tool detection.
