  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a laboratory research study developing AAV gene therapy vectors. Expected tool types include:
    - Cell lines (multiple human cancer cell lines, iPSC lines, immortalized cell lines)
    - Animal models (NSG mice, xenograft models)
    - Antibodies (for Western blot, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry)
    - Genetic reagents (plasmids, AAV vectors, CRISPR-edited lines)
    - Patient-derived models (PDX models, patient-derived xenografts)
    - Computational tools (for data analysis, though minimal mention expected)
    
    The publication involves extensive molecular biology, cell culture, animal studies, and vector development,
    making it highly likely to contain multiple categories of research tools.
  overallAssessment: |

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: No tools were mined from this publication despite it being a comprehensive laboratory research study
    - The publication contains extensive research tools across multiple categories (cell lines, antibodies, animal models, genetic reagents, PDX models)
    - Mining patterns appear to have significant gaps in coverage for this type of publication
    - At least 17 clear research tools were identified that should have been caught by mining
    - The Methods section is extremely detailed with specific tool names, catalog numbers, and vendors
  recommendations: |
    - ALL 17 identified tools should be added to the database as they represent genuine research tools
    - The mining patterns need significant improvement to catch standard laboratory tools
    - Cell line naming patterns need expansion to include alphanumeric codes and immortalized lines
    - Antibody patterns need better coverage for target-specific antibodies with catalog numbers
    - Patient-derived model patterns need to include "xenoline" terminology
    - AAV vector and plasmid patterns need specific coverage
    - Animal model patterns should include standard immunodeficient strains
    - Statistical software patterns need version-specific matching
    - This publication represents a major gap in mining coverage that should be addressed
