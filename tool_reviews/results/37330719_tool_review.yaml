  hasMethodsSection: No
  likelyContainsTools: No
  expectedToolTypes: |
    Review articles typically do NOT contain actual research tools for experimental usage.
    Instead, they discuss and cite tools used in other studies. The abstract mentions:
    - Cell cultures (2D/3D)
    - Organoids
    - Genetically engineered mice
    - Patient-derived xenografts
    - Porcine models
    
    However, these are discussed as existing models in the field, not tools used experimentally
    in this publication. Review articles may occasionally contain computational tools used for
    literature analysis, but this is uncommon.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is clearly a review article that discusses existing preclinical models for NF1 research.
    Review articles do not typically use research tools experimentally but rather cite and discuss
    tools used in other studies. The absence of Methods, Results, and Discussion sections confirms
    this is not an experimental study. No genuine research tools are expected from this publication.

suggestedPatterns:
  - patternType: "context_phrase"
    pattern: "exclude terms in review article context with phrases like 'We discuss', 'current state of', 'existing and developing'"
    toolType: "general"
    examples: ["We discuss the current state of cNF preclinical in vitro and in vivo model systems"]
    reasoning: "Review articles often use generic methodology terms that should not be captured as specific tools. Adding context filters for review language would reduce false positives."
  
  - patternType: "naming_convention"
    pattern: "require specific identifiers for model systems (strain names, catalog numbers, RRIDs) rather than generic terms"
    toolType: "animal_model"
    examples: ["genetically engineered mice" vs "Nf1flox/flox mice", "porcine models" vs "Yucatan miniature swine"]
    reasoning: "Generic model system terms in reviews should be distinguished from specific, named model systems used experimentally."

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a review article, not experimental research
    - No Methods, Results, or Discussion sections available
    - All model system mentions are generic terms in review context, not specific tools
    - Abstract discusses existing models in the field rather than experimental usage
    - No specific tool identifiers (strain names, catalog numbers, RRIDs) found
  recommendations: |
    This publication should not contribute any research tools to the database. It is a review article
    that discusses model systems generically rather than using specific tools experimentally. The mining
    correctly identified zero tools. The potentially missed tools are all generic methodology terms that
    would be false positives if added. Future mining should implement context filters to distinguish
    between review articles discussing methodologies and experimental papers using specific tools.
    Patterns should require specific identifiers (strain names, catalog numbers) rather than accepting
    generic terms like "genetically engineered mice" or "organoids" without further specification.
