    Clinical Trial → clinical assessment tools (neuropsychological tests, cognitive assessments, neuroimaging measures)
    This is a randomized controlled trial evaluating cognitive outcomes, which requires validated clinical assessment
    instruments to measure neuropsychological function. The study uses multiple standardized tests and neuroimaging
    measures that are legitimate clinical assessment tools, even though no traditional lab methods are present.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a randomized controlled trial testing simvastatin effects on cognitive function in children with NF1.
    Clinical trials of this type routinely use validated neuropsychological tests and neuroimaging measures as
    outcome assessments, which are legitimate clinical assessment tools. The absence of a Methods section is
    typical for clinical publications where methodology is described in the abstract and results.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Complete failure to identify clinical assessment tools: All 8 neuropsychological tests and assessments used in this clinical trial were missed
    - Mining patterns appear inadequate for clinical assessment tools: Standard neuropsychological tests like Rey Complex Figure, Stroop, and Beery VMI were not detected
    - Clinical trial structure not recognized: The study used multiple validated outcome measures that are legitimate clinical assessment tools
    - Lack of Methods section may have contributed to missing tools, but assessment tools were clearly described in abstract and results
  recommendations: |
    All 8 identified neuropsychological tests should be added as clinical assessment tools. This represents a complete
    mining failure for clinical assessment tools in a clinical trial setting. The mining patterns need significant
    improvement to capture standard neuropsychological assessments. These are well-established, validated clinical
    instruments used as primary and secondary outcome measures. The patterns suggested above should be implemented
    to prevent similar misses in future clinical publications. No observations could be extracted since the tools
    were not initially identified, but the Results section contains quantitative outcomes for several of these tools
    that could be valuable for future analysis.
