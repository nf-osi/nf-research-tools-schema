    Clinical Study → clinical assessment tools (visual acuity measurements, visual field assessments), 
    medical devices (OCT imaging), computational tools for statistical analysis.
    This study uses standardized clinical assessment protocols and imaging technology to evaluate 
    children with NF1, which are legitimate research tools in clinical research contexts.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a prospective clinical study evaluating diagnostic tools for optic pathway gliomas in children with NF1.
    The study uses validated clinical assessment instruments (visual acuity cards, visual field testing, OCT imaging)
    and statistical analysis software, which are legitimate research tools in clinical research contexts.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a clinical study with clear methodology
    - Multiple validated clinical assessment tools were missed including visual acuity cards, OCT imaging device, visual field analyzer
    - Clinical assessment tools are legitimate research tools but may not be captured by current mining patterns
    - Statistical software (SPSS, R) mentioned but these are generic tools used across all research
  recommendations: |
    - Add patterns for pediatric visual assessment tools (Teller cards, Cardiff cards, Lea cards)
    - Include medical imaging devices with manufacturer specifications (Cirrus HD-OCT)
    - Add patterns for standardized clinical outcome measures (VFI, WHO scales)
    - Consider that clinical studies use different types of tools than lab research
    - All potentially missed tools should be added as they represent legitimate clinical research instruments
    - Generic statistical software (SPSS, R) could be added but with lower priority as they're ubiquitous
