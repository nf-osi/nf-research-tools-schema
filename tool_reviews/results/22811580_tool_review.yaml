  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a clear laboratory research study
    - Multiple obvious research tools were missed including transgenic mouse model, shRNAs, chemical inhibitors
    - Mining patterns appear insufficient for detecting transgenic animal models with custom naming
    - Genetic reagents like shRNAs and chemical compounds not properly captured
    - Computational analysis methods not recognized as tools
    - Xenograft model systems not detected
  recommendations: |
    All 6 potentially missed tools should be added to the database as they represent genuine research tools:
    1. CNP-HRas12V transgenic mouse model - clearly described experimental animal model
    2. Aurora kinase shRNAs - genetic reagents used for functional studies
    3. MLN8237 - chemical inhibitor used as therapeutic compound
    4. Bayesian factor regression model - computational analysis tool
    5. MPNST xenografts - patient-derived xenograft model system
    6. MPNST cells - cell culture system used for in vitro studies
    
    The mining patterns need significant improvement to capture:
    - Transgenic mouse models with custom promoter-gene naming
    - shRNA and other genetic reagent terminology
    - Statistical/computational analysis methods
    - Xenograft model systems
    - Chemical compounds used as research tools
    
    This publication demonstrates major gaps in current mining coverage for laboratory research tools.
    The extracted observations provide valuable scientific context for each validated tool's experimental usage and findings.
