    Clinical Study → clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, scales, patient-reported outcome measures), 
    possibly computational tools for statistical analysis. This study administered multiple validated 
    questionnaires to assess pain, quality of life, and psychological outcomes in NF1 patients and parents.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a clinical intervention study testing Acceptance and Commitment Therapy in NF1 patients with chronic pain.
    Clinical assessment tools are expected and appropriate for measuring patient outcomes like pain interference,
    quality of life, and psychological measures. The study administered validated questionnaires at baseline and
    3-month follow-up, making clinical assessment tools the primary tool type expected.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a clinical study with clear tool usage
    - Multiple validated clinical assessment tools mentioned in methods section were missed
    - Statistical analysis tools used for data analysis were not captured
    - The mining appears to have missed clinical assessment tools entirely
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains several legitimate clinical assessment tools that should be added:
    - Impact of Pediatric Illness Scale (validated QOL measure)
    - Pain Management Inventory (custom tool developed by authors)
    - Post-Treatment Questionnaire (custom satisfaction/adherence tool)
    - Statistical analysis tools (Wilcoxon, Spearman) used for data analysis
    The mining patterns need improvement for clinical assessment tools, particularly those following
    standard naming conventions. No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated,
    but the study likely contains outcome data that could be linked to the assessment tools once validated.
