      The classifier achieved test set AUROC mean = 0.77 (95% quantile = 0.53 - 0.95) over 50 random

      The ensemble classifier performed well for samples with very high or very low NF1 protein 
      concentrations but had mixed performance in samples with intermediate NF1 concentrations. 
      The classifier predicted four samples to have NF1 inactivation and eight samples to be NF1 
      wildtype. A one-tailed Welch's t-test showed no significant difference in NF1 protein 
      concentrations between predicted groups (t = −1.38, p = 0.098, effect size = 0.699).

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined from this publication despite it being a tool-rich bioinformatics study
    - The mining system completely missed the main computational tool (machine learning classifier) developed in the study
    - Multiple computational tools (Python, R, Scikit-Learn, Docker, WGCNA, RMA) were not detected
    - Cell lines (U87-MG, HEK293T) used in validation experiments were missed
    - Multiple antibodies with catalog numbers and detailed protocols were not captured
    - Chemical reagents (bortezomib, MG132) used in experiments were not detected
  recommendations: |
    This publication should have 20+ tools added to the database. The mining system failed to detect:
    1. The primary computational tool developed (machine learning classifier for NF1 inactivation)
    2. Multiple software tools and programming languages with version numbers
    3. Well-characterized cell lines from ATCC
    4. Antibodies with complete vendor information and protocols
    5. Chemical reagents used in experimental procedures
    
    The mining patterns need significant improvement to capture:
    - Machine learning classifier development phrases
    - Software tools with version specifications
    - Cell lines from standard repositories
    - Antibodies with clone names and catalog numbers
    - Chemical reagents used as experimental tools
    
    All 20 potentially missed tools should be added to improve database completeness for this important
    bioinformatics study that develops a clinically relevant computational tool.
