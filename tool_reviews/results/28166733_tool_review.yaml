    Bioinformatics Analysis → computational tools (software, pipelines), cell lines for validation
    This study develops a machine learning classifier and validates it using cell lines and protein analysis.
    Expected tools: computational tools (Python, scikit-learn, R packages), cell lines (U87-MG, HEK293T),
    antibodies for western blotting, and potentially analysis software.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a bioinformatics study that develops a machine learning classifier to predict NF1 inactivation
    in glioblastoma using TCGA data. The study includes experimental validation using cell lines and
    western blotting, so it contains both computational tools and wet lab reagents. Tools are expected
    across multiple categories including computational tools, cell lines, and antibodies.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a methods-heavy bioinformatics study
    - Multiple clear research tools present in methods section were missed
    - Cell lines, antibodies, and computational tools all present but not detected
    - Mining patterns appear insufficient for standard laboratory reagents and software
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous legitimate research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The study uses standard cell lines (U87-MG, HEK293T), specific antibodies with catalog numbers,
    and computational tools for machine learning analysis. The mining patterns need significant improvement
    to catch standard cell line nomenclature, antibody clone designations, and bioinformatics software.
    All 9 potentially missed tools should be added, with highest priority for cell lines and antibodies
    which have clear experimental usage context. The suggested patterns would significantly improve
    future mining accuracy for similar bioinformatics studies with experimental validation components.
