    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This publication involves molecular biology experiments with mouse models, immunohistochemistry, RNA-seq analysis,
    and computational network analysis. Expected tools include animal models (multiple Nf1 mouse strains), antibodies
    (anti-Etv5), computational tools (ARACNe-AP, DESeq2, R packages), and potentially cell lines (primary astrocytes).
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive lab research study combining mouse genetics, molecular biology, and bioinformatics.
    The study uses multiple genetically modified mouse models, performs immunohistochemistry and RNA-seq experiments,
    and employs sophisticated computational network analysis. Multiple research tool categories are expected and present.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple genetically modified mouse models are clearly described but not captured
    - Specific antibodies, computational tools, and reagents are mentioned but missed
    - The mining system appears to have failed to detect standard research tools in this publication
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous legitimate research tools that were completely missed by the initial mining.
    All 11 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine research tools used in the study.
    The mouse models are particularly important as they are core NF research tools with specific genetic modifications.
    The computational tools (ARACNe-AP, DESeq2, igraph) are essential for the network analysis methodology.
    The antibody and reagents are standard lab tools with proper vendor information.
    The suggested patterns should be implemented to improve detection of similar tools in future mining.
