    Lab Research publication combining computational network analysis with experimental validation.
    Expected tool types:
    - Animal models (multiple Nf1 genetically-engineered mouse strains)
    - Antibodies (for immunohistochemistry validation)
    - Computational tools (ARACNe-AP, R packages, analysis software)
    - Genetic reagents (mouse strains with specific genetic modifications)
    
    This publication uses both computational methods and wet lab validation, so tools from
    multiple categories are expected. The Methods section describes detailed experimental
    procedures using mouse models, antibodies, and computational analysis pipelines.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a computational biology study that combines network analysis with experimental validation
    using mouse models and immunohistochemistry. The publication clearly describes research tools
    including genetically-engineered mouse strains, antibodies, and computational software packages.

    Critical mining failure - no tools were detected despite this being a clear lab research
    publication with extensive tool usage:
    - Multiple genetically-engineered mouse strains with complex nomenclature not captured
    - Antibodies with vendor information not recognized
    - Popular bioinformatics tools (ARACNe-AP, DESeq2, igraph) not detected
    - Commercial molecular biology reagents and kits not found
    - Primary cell culture systems not identified
    
    This represents a significant gap in mining coverage for computational biology papers
    that combine wet lab and computational approaches.
  recommendations: |
    URGENT: All 13 missed tools should be added to improve mining coverage. This publication
    demonstrates major gaps in current mining patterns, particularly for:
    
    1. Mouse genetic nomenclature - need patterns for flox/null, Cre driver lines, and complex genotypes
    2. Bioinformatics tools - ARACNe-AP, R packages with versions, analysis algorithms
    3. Antibodies with vendor context - species + target + vendor format
    4. Commercial reagents - kits and solutions with manufacturer information
    5. Primary cell cultures - "primary [cell type]" patterns
    
    The suggested patterns would significantly improve tool detection in computational biology
    and mouse genetics publications. All observations extracted demonstrate successful tool
    usage and validation, providing valuable metadata for the research community.
    
    This paper exemplifies the hybrid computational-experimental approach common in modern
    biomedical research, requiring comprehensive pattern coverage across multiple tool categories.
