    This is a comprehensive lab research study involving:
    - Animal models (multiple genetically engineered mouse strains)
    - Cell lines (human iPSCs, primary cell cultures)
    - Genetic reagents (CRISPR constructs, plasmids, shRNA)
    - Computational tools (analysis software, imaging tools)
    - Advanced cellular models (iPSC-derived neurons, organotypic cultures)
    
    The study combines molecular biology, cell biology, neurobiology, and cancer research
    approaches with extensive experimental methods. All major lab tool categories are expected.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication is a high-quality laboratory research study that extensively uses research tools
    across multiple categories. The comprehensive Methods section describes detailed experimental
    procedures using animal models, cell culture systems, genetic manipulation tools, and
    computational analysis software. The study would be expected to contain numerous validated
    research tools, making the empty minedTools array a significant mining failure.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Complete mining failure: No tools were captured despite extensive tool usage
    - This is a comprehensive lab research study with multiple animal models, cell lines, 
      genetic reagents, computational tools, and advanced cellular models
    - The mining system failed to recognize standard nomenclature for mouse strains, 
      cell lines, software tools, and genetic reagents
    - Missing critical tools include multiple genetically engineered mouse strains, 
      iPSC lines, analysis software, and specialized reagents
  recommendations: |
    - All 17 identified tools should be added to the database as they represent genuine research tools
    - The mining patterns need significant improvement to capture standard laboratory nomenclature
    - Mouse strain naming conventions are particularly important for NF research
    - Software tools with version numbers should be systematically captured
    - iPSC-derived cellular models represent an important emerging tool category
    - The 10 suggested patterns would significantly improve future mining accuracy
    - This publication demonstrates the need for comprehensive pattern updates to capture 
      the full spectrum of modern research tools used in neuroscience and cancer research
