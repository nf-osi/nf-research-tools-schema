    This publication is clearly experimental lab research with extensive Methods section describing:
    - Cell culture experiments with MPNST cell lines
    - Flow cytometry analysis with multiple antibodies
    - Immunohistochemistry with tissue microarrays and multiple antibodies
    - Microarray gene expression analysis
    - Statistical analysis software
    
    Expected tool types: antibodies (extensive use), cell lines (2 MPNST lines), computational tools (analysis software), genetic reagents (microarray datasets)
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive experimental lab research study that extensively uses multiple types of research tools. The publication includes detailed Methods section with specific protocols for cell culture, flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and gene expression analysis. The study characterizes immune profiles of NF1-associated tumors using both in vitro cell line models and patient tissue samples. This type of publication would typically contain numerous research tools including antibodies, cell lines, and computational analysis tools, making the complete absence of mined tools a significant mining failure.

    CRITICAL MINING FAILURE: This publication represents a complete failure of the mining system:
    - Publication is clearly experimental lab research with extensive Methods section
    - Contains at least 20 distinct research tools across multiple categories
    - Uses 2 cell lines (S462TY, STS-26T) with detailed experimental protocols
    - Uses 13+ antibodies with specific clones and catalog numbers for IHC and flow cytometry
    - Uses 5+ computational tools with version numbers for data analysis
    - Uses genetic reagents including microarray platforms and GEO datasets
    - All tools have clear experimental usage context with detailed protocols
    - Zero tools were detected despite extensive tool usage throughout Methods section
  recommendations: |
    URGENT MINING SYSTEM OVERHAUL REQUIRED:
    - This represents a catastrophic failure of the mining system on a tool-rich publication
    - The mining patterns are clearly inadequate for detecting standard research tools
    - Need to implement all 10 suggested patterns immediately to capture basic tool types
    - Cell line nomenclature patterns are completely missing
    - Antibody detection with clone/catalog information is not working
    - Software version detection is failing
    - GEO dataset accession patterns are missing
    - Vendor name recognition is not implemented
    - This publication should be used as a test case for mining system validation
    - All 20 missed tools should be added to improve future mining accuracy
    - The mining system needs comprehensive testing on lab research publications
    - Consider manual curation of high-impact publications until mining is fixed
