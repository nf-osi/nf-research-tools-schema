  title: "Aberrant oscillatory activity in neurofibromatosis type 1: an EEG study of resting state and working memory."
  queryType: "bench"  # From PubMed query (hint only)
  publicationType: "Clinical Study"
  publicationTypeConfidence: 0.9
  hasMethodsSection: Yes
  likelyContainsTools: Yes
  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on this clinical neurophysiological study design, expected tool types include:
    - Clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, cognitive assessments, behavioral scales)
    - Computational tools (EEG analysis software, statistical packages)
    - Equipment/hardware (EEG recording systems)
    
    This is a clinical research study comparing NF1 patients to controls using EEG and cognitive assessments.
    The study uses validated clinical assessment instruments (VABS-III, n-back tasks) and sophisticated
    EEG analysis pipelines requiring multiple computational tools. While queryType suggests "bench",
    this is clearly a clinical study that would contain clinical assessment tools and computational tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    This clinical neurophysiological study would be expected to contain multiple research tools across
    different categories. The extensive methods section describes validated clinical assessment instruments,
    EEG recording equipment, and computational analysis pipelines. The absence of any mined tools suggests
    significant gaps in the mining patterns, particularly for clinical assessment tools and computational tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Complete failure to detect any tools despite extensive tool usage in methods
    - Missing clinical assessment tools (VABS-III, n-back tasks, attention assessments)
    - Missing computational tools (MATLAB, SPM12, EEGLAB, FieldTrip, SPSS, G*Power)
    - Missing equipment/hardware (EEG recording system)
    - Query type "bench" incorrect for this clinical study
  recommendations: |
    This publication represents a significant mining failure - 11 clear research tools were missed.
    The study uses multiple validated clinical assessment instruments and sophisticated computational
    analysis pipelines that should have been detected. Key recommendations:
    
    1. Add patterns for clinical assessment tools (VABS, n-back, attention tests)
    2. Improve detection of software with version numbers
    3. Add patterns for equipment with vendor information
    4. Include context phrases like "assessed using", "performance on", "administered"
    5. Consider reclassifying query type - this is clinical research, not bench research
    
    No observations were extracted since no tools were initially mined to validate.
    This publication would likely contain valuable observations about EEG patterns and
    cognitive performance in NF1 patients if tools were properly detected.
