  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study that should contain multiple tool types:
    - Animal models (genetically engineered mouse models with Nf2 and Fak mutations)
    - Cell lines (human and murine schwannoma cell lines, immortalized Schwann cells)
    - Antibodies (for immunohistochemistry, Western blot, immunofluorescence)
    - Genetic reagents (CRISPR plasmids, primers for genotyping)
    - Computational tools (analysis software like ImageJ, R, MATLAB, Seurat)
    
    The publication describes extensive experimental work including mouse breeding, cell culture,
    immunostaining, RNA-seq analysis, and drug treatment studies - all requiring research tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a high-quality laboratory research publication with extensive experimental methods
    that would typically use dozens of research tools across multiple categories. The complete
    absence of mined tools represents a major mining failure, as the Methods section clearly
    describes usage of animal models, cell lines, antibodies, reagents, and software tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL MINING FAILURE: Zero tools were mined from a comprehensive laboratory research publication
    - Publication contains extensive experimental methods with clear usage of multiple tool categories
    - Methods section describes animal models, cell lines, antibodies, genetic reagents, and computational tools
    - All tools have clear experimental context with vendor information, catalog numbers, and RRIDs
    - This represents a complete failure of the mining system to detect obvious research tools
  recommendations: |
    - ALL 20 identified tools should be added to the database - they represent clear research tool usage
    - The mining patterns need significant improvement to capture standard laboratory nomenclature
    - RRID identifiers should be automatically detected as they indicate validated research resources
    - Vendor information (Jackson Laboratory, Cell Signaling Technology, etc.) should trigger tool detection
    - Mouse strain nomenclature patterns need to be added for genetically engineered models
    - Antibody detection patterns should include catalog numbers and dilution information
    - Software tools with version numbers should be automatically captured
    - This publication demonstrates major gaps in the current mining approach for laboratory research
    - No observations were extracted as this analysis focused on the mining failure
    - Future mining should prioritize publications with detailed Methods sections as they contain the most tools
