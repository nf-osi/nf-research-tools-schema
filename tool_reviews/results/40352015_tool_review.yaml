    Clinical Study → clinical assessment tools, computational tools for analysis
    This study develops a machine learning algorithm (computational tool) and uses clinical data analysis.
    May contain statistical software, machine learning frameworks, and potentially clinical assessment tools
    for measuring patient outcomes. No lab research tools expected (antibodies, cell lines, animal models).
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a clinical study developing a machine learning algorithm for predicting meningioma recurrence.
    The study would likely use computational tools (Python, machine learning libraries) and potentially
    clinical assessment tools for measuring patient outcomes. No traditional lab research tools expected.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a computational study
    - Study develops custom machine learning algorithm (Risk-SLIM) that wasn't detected
    - Clinical biomarker (Ki-67/MIB-1 index) used as assessment tool wasn't caught
    - Python usage for custom algorithm development might warrant inclusion despite general exclusion rule
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains legitimate computational tools that were missed by initial mining.
    The Risk-SLIM algorithm and Ki-67/MIB-1 index should be added as they represent actual research tools.
    Python usage is borderline - while generally excluded, it's used here for custom ML algorithm development.
    No traditional lab research tools expected or found. Focus should be on computational and clinical assessment tools.
    Manual curator should review the Risk-SLIM algorithm as it appears to be a novel/specialized method.
