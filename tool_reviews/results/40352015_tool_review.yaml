  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No computational tools were mined despite this being a clear bioinformatics/machine learning study
    - Python version 3.10 with vendor information was explicitly mentioned but not captured
    - Multiple statistical methods and machine learning techniques were used but not identified
    - The mining patterns appear to miss computational tools in bioinformatics contexts
  recommendations: |
    This publication represents a significant gap in computational tool mining. Despite being a 
    bioinformatics study that explicitly uses Python, machine learning algorithms, and statistical
    methods, zero tools were captured. The following should be addressed:
    
    1. Add patterns for programming languages with version numbers (Python 3.10)
    2. Include machine learning algorithm names (Risk-SLIM) as computational tools
    3. Capture statistical methods (cross-validation, ROC curves, statistical tests)
    4. Improve context phrase detection for "analyzed using", "conducted in", etc.
    
    All 6 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine computational
    tools used in the analysis. The suggested patterns would significantly improve mining
    accuracy for bioinformatics and machine learning publications.
