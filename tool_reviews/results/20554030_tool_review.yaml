    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a laboratory research study investigating glioma formation in mouse models, so we expect:
    - Animal models (Nf1 mutant mice)
    - Cell lines (mentioned HEK 293T, LN428)
    - Antibodies (multiple mentioned in methods)
    - Genetic reagents (lentiviral vectors, constructs)
    - Computational tools (imaging analysis software)
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study with extensive experimental methods including mouse models, cell culture, viral injections, immunohistochemistry, and imaging. The comprehensive Methods section indicates active use of multiple research tools including cell lines, antibodies, animal models, and genetic reagents. Clinical assessment tools are not expected in this basic research context.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive laboratory research study
    - Mining patterns failed to capture standard cell lines (HEK 293T, LN428)
    - Multiple antibodies with clear vendor and target information were missed
    - Complex mouse genotypes and strain backgrounds not captured
    - Lentiviral vectors and genetic reagents not identified
    - Imaging equipment and analysis tools not captured
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous legitimate research tools that were completely missed by the initial mining. The Methods section clearly describes experimental use of cell lines, antibodies, mouse models, viral vectors, and imaging systems. All 13 potentially missed tools should be added to improve mining coverage. The suggested patterns would significantly improve detection of similar tools in future publications. No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated, but this study likely contains valuable phenotypic data about the Nf1 mouse models that could be captured once tools are properly identified.
