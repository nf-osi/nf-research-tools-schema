  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on this being a bioinformatics analysis study:
    - Computational tools (software, web interfaces, algorithms) - PRIMARY
    - Genetic reagents (DNA extraction kits, sequencing kits) - SECONDARY
    
    This study evaluates computational splicing prediction tools using clinical variant data.
    The focus is on comparing SpliceAI performance against other in silico prediction algorithms.
    Laboratory reagents are used for validation sequencing but are not the primary research focus.

  overallAssessment: |
    This is a bioinformatics analysis study evaluating the performance of SpliceAI for predicting 
    splicing effects of NF1 variants. The study should contain multiple computational tools 
    (SpliceAI, MES, SSF, databases, analysis software) and some genetic reagents (DNA/RNA 
    extraction and sequencing kits). The mining system appears to have failed completely, 
    capturing zero tools when many should be present.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Mining system completely failed - captured 0 tools when 16+ should be present
    - This is a bioinformatics analysis study with extensive computational tool usage
    - Multiple databases, software packages, and laboratory reagents are clearly described
    - All tools have clear usage context, vendor information, and/or version numbers
    - The mining patterns appear to be inadequate for this publication type
  recommendations: |
    - URGENT: Investigate why mining system failed completely on this publication
    - All 16 identified tools should be added to the database
    - Primary focus should be computational tools (SpliceAI, databases, analysis software)
    - Secondary focus on genetic reagents (kits, instruments) used for validation
    - Implement suggested patterns to improve detection of bioinformatics tools
    - This publication represents a major gap in current mining capabilities
    - No observations extracted as this is a methods validation study without phenotypic findings
