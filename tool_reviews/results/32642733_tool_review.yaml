    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a comprehensive laboratory study with extensive methods including cell culture, molecular biology,
    immunohistochemistry, drug screening, and functional assays. Expected tools include cell lines, antibodies,
    genetic reagents (siRNA, CRISPR), and computational tools for analysis.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study investigating mitotic kinesins as therapeutic targets in MPNST.
    The extensive Methods section describes multiple experimental approaches including cell culture, molecular biology,
    drug screening, and functional assays, indicating high likelihood of research tool usage. Clinical assessment
    tools are not expected given the purely laboratory-based experimental design.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive laboratory study with extensive Methods section
    - Multiple MPNST cell lines with non-standard naming conventions were missed
    - Several antibodies with vendor information were not captured
    - Genetic reagents including siRNA pools, CRISPR plasmids, and small molecule inhibitors were missed
    - Mining patterns appear inadequate for NF-specific cell line nomenclature
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous legitimate research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    All 17 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine laboratory reagents used in experiments.
    The cell lines are well-characterized MPNST models, antibodies have vendor information indicating experimental use,
    and genetic reagents include both commercial products and repository plasmids with clear experimental context.
    Mining patterns need significant enhancement for NF-specific cell line naming conventions and small molecule reagents.
    No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated, but this study likely contains valuable
    phenotypic data about MPNST cell behavior and drug sensitivity that could be captured after tool validation.
