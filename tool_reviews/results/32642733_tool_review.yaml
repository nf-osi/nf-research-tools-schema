    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study investigating mitotic kinesins in MPNST cell lines.
    Expected tools include:
    - Cell lines (multiple MPNST cell lines mentioned: S462, ST88-14, sNF96.2, etc.)
    - Antibodies (anti-KIF11, anti-KIF15, anti-α-tubulin, etc.)
    - Genetic reagents (siRNA pools, CRISPR constructs, plasmids)
    - Computational tools (analysis software, statistical packages)
    - Primary cell cultures (Schwann cells from patient samples)
    
    The publication contains extensive Methods section with detailed experimental procedures,
    indicating active tool usage rather than just citations.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a high-quality laboratory research study that extensively uses research tools across multiple categories.
    The comprehensive Methods section describes detailed experimental procedures using cell lines, antibodies, 
    genetic reagents, and analytical tools. The study involves functional assays, molecular biology techniques,
    and drug screening - all requiring specific research tools that should be captured by mining algorithms.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Mining algorithm completely failed to identify any tools despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple cell lines with standard naming conventions were missed (S462, ST88-14, sNF96.2, etc.)
    - Antibodies with clear vendor information were not caught (anti-KIF11, anti-KIF15, Ki67)
    - Genetic reagents including commercial siRNA and CRISPR plasmids were missed
    - Computational tools and instruments were not recognized
    - The publication contains 20+ clear research tools that should have been identified
  recommendations: |
    URGENT: The mining algorithm requires significant improvement as it failed to identify any tools in a publication rich with research tools.
    
    Immediate actions needed:
    1. Add all 21 missed tools to the database - they are all legitimate research tools with clear experimental usage
    2. Implement the 8 suggested patterns to catch similar tools in future mining
    3. Review mining algorithm for cell line detection - many standard formats were missed
    4. Improve antibody detection, especially those with vendor information
    5. Add patterns for genetic reagents from commercial sources (Dharmacon, Addgene)
    6. Include laboratory instruments and analysis software in computational tool patterns
    
    This publication demonstrates that current mining patterns are insufficient for comprehensive tool detection.
    The missed tools represent critical research resources that should be captured for the research community.
    
    Quality of observations: High - extracted 7 detailed observations covering tool performance, sensitivity data,
    and usage instructions that provide valuable information for researchers.
