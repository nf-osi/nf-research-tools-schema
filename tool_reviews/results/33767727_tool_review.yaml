    Clinical Study → clinical assessment tools, possibly computational tools for analysis
    This publication focuses on molecular diagnosis using genetic testing methods, so computational tools
    for sequencing analysis and genetic reagents (DNA extraction kits, sequencing platforms) are expected.
    Clinical assessment tools may be present for phenotype evaluation. Lab research tools like antibodies
    and cell lines are less likely but possible for tissue analysis.
  overallAssessment: |
    This clinical study involves molecular genetic testing of NF patients using multigene panel sequencing,
    Sanger sequencing, and ultradeep sequencing. The study would typically use computational tools for
    sequence analysis, genetic reagents for DNA extraction and library preparation, and potentially clinical
    assessment tools for phenotype evaluation. The presence of a detailed Methods section indicates actual
    experimental work rather than just observational data collection.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a methods-heavy clinical study
    - Multiple genetic reagents (DNA extraction kits, assay kits) were missed
    - Several computational tools (sequencing platforms, analysis instruments) were not detected
    - The mining appears to have missed tools with vendor information and model numbers
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous research tools that were completely missed by the initial mining.
    The study uses multiple genetic reagents (DNA extraction kits, capture probes, assay kits) and
    computational tools (sequencing platforms, analysis instruments, software). All 12 potentially
    missed tools should be added as they represent genuine research tools with clear experimental usage.
    The suggested patterns would significantly improve detection of commercial kits and instruments
    with vendor information. No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated.
