    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a molecular pathology study analyzing tumor samples with genetic markers and polymorphisms.
    Expected tools include genetic reagents (primers, enzymes), computational tools for statistical analysis,
    and potentially antibodies for protein analysis. The study involves DNA extraction, PCR, restriction
    enzyme digestion, and statistical analysis.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory-based molecular pathology study investigating genetic polymorphisms and loss of
    heterozygosity in meningioma samples. The comprehensive Methods section describes DNA extraction,
    PCR amplification, restriction enzyme analysis, and statistical methods, indicating active use of
    research tools. Clinical assessment tools are unlikely given the focus on molecular analysis rather
    than patient outcomes.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a clear laboratory research study
    - Multiple genetic reagents with vendor information were missed (BstUI, Taq polymerase)
    - Statistical analysis tools were not captured (Fisher's exact test)
    - Custom database tool explicitly described as "research tool" was missed
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains several legitimate research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The genetic reagents (BstUI, Taq polymerase) have clear vendor information and are essential for the
    molecular analysis described. The Research Patient Database Registry is explicitly called a "research tool"
    and should be captured. Statistical methods like Fisher's exact test are computational tools used for
    analysis. The mining patterns need improvement to capture enzyme names with vendor information and
    statistical analysis methods. All four potentially missed tools should be added to improve coverage
    of molecular biology reagents and analysis tools.
