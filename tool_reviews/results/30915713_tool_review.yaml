    Review Article → Typically NO research tools expected
    - Review articles synthesize existing literature and do not conduct original experiments
    - May cite tools from other studies but do not use them experimentally
    - Focus is on consolidating knowledge rather than tool development or usage
    - Abstract mentions "consolidated update" and "illustrating the link" which are review language
    - No Methods section confirms this is not experimental research
    
    Even though the abstract mentions neurofibromatosis type 1, this appears to be a disease context
    discussion rather than tool usage. Review articles about NF1 would not be expected to contain
    actual research tools unless they are systematic reviews of tool effectiveness.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is clearly a review article that provides a "consolidated update" on CRMP2 signaling and function.
    Review articles typically do not use research tools experimentally but rather synthesize existing literature.
    The absence of Methods, Results, and Discussion sections confirms this is not original experimental research.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a review article, not original experimental research
    - No Methods section present, confirming lack of experimental procedures
    - Only abstract text available - no full text sections for tool identification
    - No tools were mined, which is appropriate for this publication type
    - Abstract focuses on literature synthesis rather than tool usage
  recommendations: |
    This publication should be excluded from tool mining efforts:
    - Review articles do not typically contain research tools for experimental usage
    - The publication synthesizes existing knowledge rather than conducting original research
    - No experimental sections (Methods, Results) are available for tool identification
    - Mining efforts should focus on original research publications with experimental methods
    - Consider filtering out review articles in future mining to improve precision
    - If review articles are included, focus on systematic reviews that evaluate tool effectiveness
