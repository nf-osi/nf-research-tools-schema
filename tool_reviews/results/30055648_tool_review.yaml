    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a preclinical xenograft study testing drug treatments in mouse models, so we expect:
    - Cell lines (S462, T265 MPNST cells)
    - Animal models (nude mouse strains)
    - Patient-derived models (xenografts)
    - Antibodies (for immunohistochemistry)
    - Computational tools (for image analysis and statistics)
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study investigating drug treatments using xenograft mouse models.
    The study involves cell culture, animal experiments, immunohistochemistry, and statistical analysis.
    Multiple research tool types are expected including cell lines, mouse strains, xenograft models, antibodies, and computational tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining failed to capture any tools despite this being a tool-rich laboratory research publication
    - Multiple categories of research tools are present but were missed by current patterns:
      * Cell lines (S462, T265) with non-standard naming
      * Multiple mouse strains with detailed vendor nomenclature
      * Comprehensive antibody panel with clone and vendor information
      * Xenograft models derived from human cell lines
      * Image analysis software (ImageJ)
    - Current patterns appear insufficient for capturing specialized nomenclature used in xenograft studies
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous legitimate research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The tools include well-characterized MPNST cell lines, multiple immunodeficient mouse strains, a comprehensive antibody panel for immunohistochemistry, xenograft models, and image analysis software.
    All identified tools should be added to improve mining coverage for similar xenograft and cancer research studies.
    The suggested patterns would significantly improve detection of cell lines, mouse strains, antibodies, and xenograft models in future mining.
    No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated, but this publication would likely contain valuable phenotypic and therapeutic response data.
