    Critical mining failure - no tools were captured despite extensive tool usage:
    - Publication contains comprehensive laboratory methods with numerous research tools
    - Animal models (NF1 R1947/+ minipigs) completely missed
    - Multiple cell lines and primary cultures not captured
    - Genetic reagents (TALENs, plasmids, siRNA) not identified
    - Antibodies and commercial assays not found
    - Computational tools and software not captured
    - Laboratory instruments and systems not detected
    - This represents a complete failure of the mining system for this publication type
  recommendations: |
    URGENT: Complete overhaul of mining patterns needed for laboratory research publications:
    - All 20 identified tools should be added to the database
    - Implement suggested patterns to capture similar tools in future mining
    - This publication demonstrates sophisticated use of multiple tool categories
    - Mining system failed to capture any tools despite clear experimental context
    - Patterns need improvement for: animal model nomenclature, gene editing tools, vendor-specific instruments
    - Software and computational tools need better recognition patterns
    - Consider manual curation for publications with extensive Methods sections
    - Quality control needed to flag publications with zero tools but detailed methods
