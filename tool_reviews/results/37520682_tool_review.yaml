  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple research tools are clearly present in the Methods section but were missed
    - Animal models, antibodies, cell lines, genetic reagents, and computational tools are all used
    - The mining patterns appear insufficient for capturing NF-specific nomenclature and specialized tools
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous research tools that were completely missed by the initial mining:
    - Custom NF1 minipig models with specific mutation nomenclature should be captured
    - Primary cell lines from specific pig breeds need better pattern coverage
    - Antibodies mentioned with target proteins but without explicit "antibody" keywords
    - Genetic constructs like DLR plasmids require specialized patterns
    - Bioinformatics tools (HISAT2, StringTie, FlowJo, PKNCA) need better coverage
    - The suggested patterns would significantly improve tool detection for NF research
    - Manual curator review recommended to validate the 8 potentially missed tools
    - No observations extracted since no tools were initially validated
