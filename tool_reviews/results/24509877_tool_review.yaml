    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a molecular biology study investigating MAF transcription factor regulation in NF1-deficient MPNST cells.
    Expected tools include cell lines (MPNST, NHSC), antibodies (MAF, pS6, etc.), genetic reagents (viral vectors, 
    plasmids), and potentially computational tools for microarray analysis.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive lab research study with extensive Methods section describing cell culture, viral transduction,
    immunoblotting, ChIP, xenograft experiments, and microarray analysis. The study clearly uses multiple research tools
    including cell lines, antibodies, viral vectors, and animal models. Tools are expected and extensively documented.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Mining patterns appear to miss many standard research tools including cell lines, antibodies, and genetic reagents
    - Cell line naming conventions (MPNST 88-14, S462-TY) not captured
    - Antibody mentions with vendor information not detected
    - Viral vector constructs (Ad-NF1-GRD, pLVX vectors) not identified
    - Mouse strain nomenclature not recognized
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains extensive research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The study uses multiple MPNST cell lines, primary Schwann cells, numerous antibodies with vendor information,
    viral vectors for gene delivery, mouse xenograft models, and analysis software. All potentially missed tools
    should be added to improve mining coverage. The suggested patterns would significantly improve detection of
    similar tools in future NF research publications. Manual curator review is recommended to validate the
    extensive tool usage documented in the Methods section.
