    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a comprehensive preclinical cancer research study with extensive cell culture work, animal models, 
    biochemical assays, and computational analysis. Expected to contain multiple tool types including cell lines,
    antibodies, animal models, and computational tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study investigating combination therapy for NF1-deficient tumors.
    The extensive Methods section describes cell culture, animal experiments, biochemical assays, and computational
    analysis, indicating high likelihood of containing multiple research tool types. Clinical assessment tools
    are not expected in this preclinical study.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Extensive cell line collection (17 different cell lines) completely missed
    - Multiple antibodies with catalog numbers not detected
    - Mouse strains with Jackson Laboratory stock numbers not identified
    - Computational tools including specialized software missed
    - Patient-derived models not recognized
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The study uses 17 different cell lines (both commercial and patient-derived), multiple antibodies,
    mouse models, and computational tools. All identified tools should be added as they represent
    genuine research resources with proper sourcing and catalog information. The mining patterns
    need significant improvement to capture cell line naming conventions, vendor information,
    and academic sharing contexts. No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated.
