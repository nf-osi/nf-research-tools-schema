  expectedToolTypes: |
    Review Article → Typically no experimental tools expected. Review articles synthesize existing 
    literature and discuss concepts rather than report original experimental work. They may cite 
    tools used in other studies but do not typically use tools themselves. The title "role of the 
    microenvironment" and abstract content discussing "opportunities for targeting new therapeutic 
    vulnerabilities" suggests this is a conceptual review rather than an experimental study.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is clearly a review article that discusses the neurofibroma tumor microenvironment and 
    potential therapeutic targets. The abstract mentions "numerous studies" and discusses translational 
    gaps, indicating synthesis of existing literature rather than original experimental work. Review 
    articles typically do not use research tools directly but may reference tools used in cited studies.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a review article, not original research
    - No Methods section present, confirming lack of experimental work
    - Only abstract available, no full text sections for detailed analysis
    - No tools were mined, which is appropriate for a review article
  recommendations: |
    This publication correctly had zero tools mined. Review articles should generally not contain 
    research tools as they synthesize existing literature rather than conduct original experiments. 
    The mining system correctly identified this as having no tools. No action needed - this is an 
    appropriate result for a review article. The absence of Methods, Results, and Discussion sections 
    further confirms this is not an experimental study that would use research tools.
