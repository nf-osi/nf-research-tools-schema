  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive protocol paper for developing and using a cerebellopontine angle mouse model for NF2 research. It describes detailed experimental procedures including surgical techniques, tumor monitoring, and functional assessments. The publication extensively uses multiple research tools including cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, and specialized equipment. This type of protocol paper is expected to contain numerous validated research tools across multiple categories.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining failed to capture any tools despite this being a comprehensive protocol paper
    - Multiple categories of research tools are extensively described but not detected
    - Standard mouse strain nomenclature not recognized
    - Clinical assessment tools (hearing tests, behavioral assays) missed
    - Cell line names with genetic modifications not caught
    - Reporter gene constructs not identified
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous legitimate research tools that were completely missed by initial mining:
    - 5 animal models (mouse strains) with standard nomenclature
    - 2 cell lines including genetically modified variants
    - 1 genetic reagent (reporter gene)
    - 5 clinical assessment tools (hearing and behavioral tests)
    - 1 computational tool (LabVIEW)
    All 13 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine research tools with clear experimental usage context.
    The suggested patterns would significantly improve detection of similar tools in future NF research publications.
    This represents a major gap in current mining capabilities for protocol and methods papers.
