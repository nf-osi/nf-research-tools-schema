  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a Nature Protocols paper describing a laboratory protocol for creating and studying a mouse model.
    Expected tool types include:
    - Animal models (mouse strains, genetically modified mice)
    - Cell lines (schwannoma cells mentioned for injection)
    - Computational tools (for imaging analysis, hearing assessment)
    - Potentially genetic reagents (if describing cell line modifications)
    
    Note: Even though only abstract is available, this is clearly a methods/protocol paper that would
    contain detailed tool information in the full Methods section. The abstract mentions specific
    experimental procedures (cell injection, intravital imaging, hearing assessment) that require tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a Nature Protocols paper describing a detailed laboratory protocol for creating a mouse model
    of NF2-related vestibular schwannoma. Such protocol papers typically contain extensive tool information
    including animal models, cell lines, imaging equipment, and assessment tools. The absence of a Methods
    section in the input suggests incomplete text extraction rather than lack of methods. The abstract
    clearly describes experimental procedures that would require multiple research tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were mined from this publication despite it being a Nature Protocols paper describing laboratory methods
    - Only abstract text is available - Methods section missing which would contain detailed tool information
    - Several clear tool mentions in abstract were missed by mining patterns
    - This appears to be a case of incomplete text extraction rather than absence of tools
  recommendations: |
    This publication should be re-processed with complete full-text content including the Methods section.
    The abstract alone contains clear evidence of multiple research tools (cell lines, animal models, 
    assessment techniques) that were missed. A Nature Protocols paper describing a mouse model protocol
    would typically contain extensive tool information. The mining patterns should be improved to capture:
    1. Cell lines mentioned in injection contexts
    2. Animal model terminology (e.g., "mouse model")
    3. Assessment techniques and methodologies
    4. Imaging modalities and systems
    
    Without the full Methods section, this review is necessarily incomplete. The publication should be
    flagged for re-extraction with complete text before final tool validation.
