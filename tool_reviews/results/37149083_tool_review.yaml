    Clinical Study → clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, scales, outcome measures), possibly computational tools for statistical analysis
    
    This publication is a clinical validation study of a quality of life questionnaire (cNF-Skindex) in patients with neurofibromatosis 1.
    Expected tools include:
    - Clinical assessment tools: cNF-Skindex, EQ-5D-5L, SF-36 (all mentioned in methods)
    - Computational tools: SPSS version 28.0 (mentioned for statistical analysis)
    
    Note: Clinical studies routinely use validated questionnaires and scales as research tools to measure patient outcomes,
    even without traditional laboratory methods. These are legitimate research tools in the clinical context.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a clinical validation study that develops severity strata for the cNF-Skindex questionnaire and validates it
    in US populations. Clinical studies like this routinely use validated assessment tools (questionnaires, scales) as
    research instruments to measure patient-reported outcomes. The study also uses statistical software for data analysis.
    Multiple clinical assessment tools and computational tools should be present and are expected for this study type.

      The cNF-Skindex demonstrated good psychometric properties in Dutch validation study. Cut-off values of 12 and 49 
      provided optimal severity stratification with highest Kappa value (κ = 0.685, 95% CI = 0.604-0.765). The questionnaire 
      showed adequate internal consistency (Cronbach's α ≥ 0.70) and test-retest reliability (≥ 0.75). Convergent validity 
      was established with EQ-5D-5L and SF-36. Three severity strata were validated: non-bothersome cNF (0-11), moderately 
      bothersome cNF (12-48), and importantly/very importantly bothersome cNF (49+).

      EQ-5D-5L was successfully used to evaluate convergent validity of the cNF-Skindex. The questionnaire comprises five 
      dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) with five Likert response 
      options and one-day recall period. Includes visual analog scale (EQ-VAS) for self-rating health from 0-100.

      SF-36 was effectively used to evaluate convergent validity of the cNF-Skindex. The 36-item questionnaire measures 
      eight domains of health: physical function, limitations due to physical problems, limitations due to emotional problems, 
      social function, mental health, energy, pain, and health perception. Scores range from 0-100 with higher scores 
      indicating more favorable health state. Standard 4-week recall period was used.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Complete failure to detect any tools despite this being a clinical validation study with multiple assessment tools
    - Primary outcome measure (cNF-Skindex) was not detected despite being mentioned throughout the publication
    - Well-established clinical assessment tools (EQ-5D-5L, SF-36) were missed
    - Statistical software (SPSS version 28.0) was not detected
    - Electronic data capture system (Castor EDC) was missed
    - Mining patterns appear inadequate for clinical assessment tools and computational tools used in clinical research
  recommendations: |
    This publication represents a significant mining failure - 5 legitimate research tools were completely missed.
    All missed tools should be added to the database:
    
    CLINICAL ASSESSMENT TOOLS (high priority):
    - cNF-Skindex: Primary outcome measure being validated
    - EQ-5D-5L: Validated health status questionnaire for convergent validity
    - SF-36: Validated quality of life questionnaire for convergent validity
    
    COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS:
    - SPSS version 28.0: Statistical analysis software
    - Castor EDC: Electronic data capture system
    
    The mining patterns need significant improvement for clinical studies. Current patterns appear biased toward 
    laboratory research tools and miss clinical assessment instruments. The suggested patterns should be implemented 
    to improve detection of questionnaires, scales, and clinical research software.
    
    This case demonstrates that clinical studies contain legitimate research tools that are currently under-detected.
    The queryType classification system should be enhanced to better capture clinical assessment tools.
