    Clinical Trial → clinical assessment tools (validated questionnaires, scales, outcome measures), possibly computational tools for statistical analysis
    
    This randomized clinical trial evaluates a psychosocial intervention using multiple validated clinical assessment instruments as primary and secondary outcomes. Clinical trials routinely use standardized questionnaires and scales to measure patient-reported outcomes, making clinical assessment tools highly expected in this publication type.

    Note: While computational tools for statistical analysis may be present, they are typically not detailed in abstracts. The focus should be on the clinical assessment tools that are explicitly mentioned as outcome measures.
  overallAssessment: |
    This randomized clinical trial would definitely contain clinical assessment tools as it measures patient-reported outcomes using validated questionnaires and scales. The study design requires standardized instruments to assess disease acceptance, coping strategies, depression, anxiety, quality of life, and social support. Clinical assessment tools are essential for this type of intervention research and should be captured by mining algorithms. The absence of any mined tools suggests significant gaps in the clinical assessment tool mining patterns.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    Major issues found during review:
    - Complete failure to mine any clinical assessment tools from a clinical trial that uses 7+ validated instruments
    - Mining patterns appear inadequate for capturing clinical assessment tools in parenthetical contexts
    - Standard abbreviations for common clinical scales (ICQ, PHQ-9, GAD-7, SF-12) not recognized
    - Questionnaire and scale names in outcome measure descriptions not captured
    - Clinical trial abstracts have different linguistic patterns than lab research papers
  recommendations: |
    Overall recommendations for this publication:
    - All 11 potentially missed tools should be added - they are clearly validated clinical assessment instruments
    - This represents a significant gap in clinical assessment tool mining capabilities
    - The mining algorithm needs substantial improvement for clinical trial abstracts
    - Focus on parenthetical instrument names following outcome descriptions
    - Add patterns for standard clinical scale abbreviations (PHQ-9, GAD-7, SF-12, etc.)
    - Consider context phrases like "assessed using", "measured with", "scores were"
    - Clinical trials are rich sources of clinical assessment tools and should be prioritized for pattern development
    - No observations could be extracted due to lack of Results/Discussion sections, but this is expected for abstract-only content
