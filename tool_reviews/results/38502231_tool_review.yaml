  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study investigating MPNST immunotherapy using STING agonists.
    Expected tool types include:
    - Animal models (multiple mouse models described: cisNP, conditional MPNST)
    - Cell lines (human and mouse MPNST cell lines, control cell lines)
    - Antibodies (extensive list for immunoblotting, IHC, and flow cytometry)
    - Genetic reagents (primers for genotyping, constructs)
    - Computational tools (ImageJ, QuantStudio PCR system, analysis software)
    - Advanced cellular models (xenograft models, allografts)
    - Patient-derived models (human xenografts from surgically resected tissue)
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a high-quality laboratory research publication with extensive experimental methods.
    The study uses multiple complementary approaches including genetically engineered mouse models,
    cell culture experiments, xenograft studies, and comprehensive molecular analysis techniques.
    The detailed Methods section indicates heavy use of research tools across multiple categories,
    making this an ideal publication for tool mining with high expected yield.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: No tools were mined from this publication despite it being a comprehensive laboratory research study
    - The publication contains extensive research tools across multiple categories (39 identified)
    - Methods section is highly detailed with specific catalog numbers, vendors, and protocols
    - Missing Results and Discussion sections prevents observation extraction
    - Current mining patterns appear to have significant gaps for this type of publication
  recommendations: |
    - ALL 39 identified tools should be added to the database - this represents a major mining failure
    - The suggested patterns should be implemented immediately to catch similar tools in future mining
    - This publication demonstrates the need for more comprehensive antibody detection patterns
    - Cell line naming conventions need improvement to catch alphanumeric formats
    - Mouse model terminology specific to NF research needs better coverage
    - Patient-derived xenograft patterns need enhancement
    - Computational tool detection needs expansion beyond software names to include instruments
    - The high tool density (39 tools in methods alone) suggests this publication type should be prioritized
    - Consider manual review of similar high-impact laboratory publications to identify pattern gaps
    - No observations could be extracted due to missing Results/Discussion sections
