  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a comprehensive lab research study involving:
    - Cell lines (multiple MPNST cell lines mentioned)
    - Animal models (mouse xenograft studies)
    - Antibodies (for IHC and Western blot)
    - Genetic reagents (CRISPR constructs, plasmids)
    - Computational tools (RNA-seq analysis, statistical software)
    - Patient-derived models (PDX models explicitly mentioned)
    
    All major tool categories are expected in this type of preclinical cancer research.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a high-quality preclinical cancer research study with extensive experimental methods including cell culture, animal studies, molecular biology, and bioinformatics analysis. The publication should contain numerous research tools across multiple categories. The fact that no tools were initially mined suggests significant gaps in the mining patterns, as this paper clearly describes the use of cell lines, antibodies, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, and patient-derived xenograft models.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: No tools were initially mined from this publication despite it being a comprehensive lab research study
    - This represents a complete failure of the mining system for this paper
    - The publication contains extensive experimental methods with clear tool usage across all major categories
    - Multiple cell lines, animal models, antibodies, genetic reagents, computational tools, and PDX models are explicitly described
    - All tools have proper identifiers (RRIDs, catalog numbers, strain numbers) that should facilitate detection
  recommendations: |
    - ALL 20 identified tools should be added to the database - this is a high-quality preclinical study with well-documented tool usage
    - The mining patterns need significant improvement to catch:
      * Cell line names with institutional prefixes and complex formatting (JH-2–002, MPNST-724)
      * Mouse strain nomenclature including genetic modifications (C57BL6/J Nf1±; Trp53±cis)
      * Antibodies with catalog numbers and RRID identifiers
      * Software tools with version numbers and SCR RRIDs
      * CRISPR reagents with guide RNA sequences
      * PDX models with institutional naming conventions
    - The 10 suggested patterns should be implemented to improve future mining accuracy
    - This paper demonstrates the need for better recognition of standard research tool naming conventions
    - Quality control processes should flag publications with extensive Methods sections but zero mined tools
    - The 9 scientific observations extracted provide valuable phenotypic and usage data for the validated tools
