  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a systematic review/recommendation paper about patient-reported outcome measures for neurofibromatosis clinical trials.
    Expected tool types:
    - Clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, scales, outcome measures) - PRIMARY FOCUS
    - Possibly computational tools for systematic review analysis
    
    The publication explicitly reviews and recommends PRO measures, which are validated clinical assessment tools.
    Multiple specific questionnaires and scales are mentioned by name in the abstract.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication is a systematic review that evaluates and recommends patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures for neurofibromatosis clinical trials.
    It should contain multiple clinical assessment tools (validated questionnaires and scales) as these are the primary focus of the review.
    The mining system completely missed these tools, likely due to inadequate patterns for clinical assessment tool names.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Mining system completely failed to identify any clinical assessment tools despite this being a systematic review of PRO measures
    - Seven major clinical assessment tools were clearly mentioned by name in the abstract but not captured
    - This represents a significant gap in clinical assessment tool mining patterns
    - The publication is specifically about recommending validated questionnaires and scales for clinical trials
  recommendations: |
    - ALL 7 identified clinical assessment tools should be added to the mining results
    - Implement the suggested patterns to capture clinical assessment tool names, especially:
      * PedsQL and its variants (widely used pediatric QoL tool)
      * WHO Quality of Life instruments
      * Disease-specific QoL scales
      * "Assessment of X-Y" naming patterns
    - This publication demonstrates that clinical assessment tool mining needs significant improvement
    - Consider adding context-based patterns that look for "measures", "scales", "questionnaires" near tool names
    - No observations extracted as this is a review/recommendation paper without experimental results
    - This case highlights the importance of comprehensive clinical assessment tool pattern coverage
