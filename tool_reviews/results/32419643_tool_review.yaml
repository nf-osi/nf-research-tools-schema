    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a molecular biology study investigating lncRNA mechanisms in glioma using cell culture,
    transfections, and molecular assays. Expected tools include cell lines, antibodies, plasmids,
    reagents, and potentially computational tools for analysis.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study with extensive Methods section describing cell culture,
    transfections, molecular assays, and protein analysis. The study uses multiple glioma cell lines,
    antibodies, plasmids, and commercial reagents, making it highly likely to contain genuine research tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining failed to capture any tools despite this being a lab research study with extensive Methods
    - Multiple standard cell lines (U87, U118, U251, A172, M059J) were not detected
    - Common antibodies and vectors were missed by current patterns
    - Commercial assay kits not captured by existing patterns
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous genuine research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The suggested patterns should be implemented to capture standard cell line nomenclature, antibody
    mentions, and commercial vectors/kits. All 13 potentially missed tools should be added as they
    represent legitimate research reagents used in the experimental procedures. The mining patterns
    need significant improvement for molecular biology publications.
