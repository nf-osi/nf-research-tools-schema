    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This publication involves CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, hiPSC culture, cell differentiation, and molecular biology techniques.
    Expected tools include: cell lines (hiPSCs), genetic reagents (CRISPR components), antibodies (Western blot), 
    computational tools (analysis software), and potentially advanced cellular models (differentiated cells).
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study involving CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing of human iPSCs to create NF1 knockout models.
    The comprehensive Methods section describes extensive use of research tools including cell lines, genetic reagents,
    antibodies, and computational analysis tools. This publication type would definitely contain multiple research tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple clear research tools present in Methods section were missed
    - Cell lines, antibodies, computational tools, and genetic reagents all present but not detected
    - Mining patterns appear insufficient for detecting standard lab research tools
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous legitimate research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The Methods section clearly describes use of specific cell lines (hiPSCs), antibodies with catalog numbers,
    computational analysis software, and CRISPR genetic reagents. All 11 potentially missed tools should be added.
    The mining patterns need significant improvement to detect standard lab research nomenclature and vendor information.
    No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated, but this study would contain valuable
    phenotypic and methodological observations about the generated NF1 knockout cell lines.
