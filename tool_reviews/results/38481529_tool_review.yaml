  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were mined from this publication despite it being a clear laboratory research study
    - The mining system completely failed to identify obvious research tools including:
      * Multiple cell lines (hiPSC lines with specific names and mutations)
      * Antibodies with catalog numbers and vendors
      * Computational tools (CRISPOR, FlowJo, GraphPad Prism)
      * Genetic reagents (Cas9 protein)
    - This represents a major failure in the mining algorithm
    - Results and Discussion sections are missing, preventing observation extraction
  recommendations: |
    - All 12 identified tools should be added to the database as they represent genuine research tools
    - The mining patterns need significant improvement to catch:
      * Cell lines with standard naming conventions (NF1-1, WT-1, etc.)
      * Antibodies with vendor/catalog information in parentheses
      * Software mentioned with "analyzed using" or "designed using" context
      * Genetic reagents like Cas9 protein
    - This publication demonstrates major gaps in the current mining approach
    - The suggested patterns should be implemented to improve future mining accuracy
    - Manual review of similar publications is recommended to identify additional pattern gaps
