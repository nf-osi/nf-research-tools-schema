    This publication is a comprehensive laboratory study involving primary cell culture, proteomics analysis,
    Western blotting, and quantitative RT-PCR. Despite lacking a formal Methods section, the Results section
    contains detailed methodological information describing experimental procedures. Expected tools include:
    - Cell lines (primary Schwann cell cultures established from patients)
    - Antibodies (for Western blot analysis)
    - Computational tools (for proteomics data analysis)
    - Potentially genetic reagents (stable isotope labeling)
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a legitimate laboratory research study that should contain multiple research tools.
    The study involves primary cell culture establishment, proteomics analysis using LC-MS/MS,
    Western blot analysis, and quantitative RT-PCR - all techniques that require specific tools.
    The absence of mined tools suggests significant gaps in the mining process for this publication.

      Two different rabbit polyclonal antibodies from different sources with different target epitopes were tested.
      Successfully detected cell-attached RARRES1 as single band around 40 kDa in Western blot analysis.
      However, both antibodies failed to detect the secreted form of RARRES1 despite mass spectrometry detection,
      suggesting potential post-translational modification of secreted RARRES1 that hinders antibody recognition.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Complete failure of mining system to detect any tools despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple primary cell lines (NFSC141, NFSC142, NFSC143R, NFSC143L, NSC1, NSC2) completely missed
    - Commercial cell line (sNF96.2) with non-standard naming not detected
    - Proteomics software (ProteoIQ) not recognized
    - Antibodies described without catalog numbers not detected
    - Mining patterns appear inadequate for primary cell culture nomenclature
  recommendations: |
    All potentially missed tools should be added to improve mining coverage for similar publications.
    The mining system needs significant enhancement for:
    1. Primary cell line naming conventions (laboratory-specific codes)
    2. Commercial cell lines with non-standard formats
    3. Proteomics and bioinformatics software recognition
    4. Antibody descriptions without explicit catalog/clone information
    5. Context-based tool detection in Results sections when Methods are absent
    
    This publication demonstrates major gaps in current mining patterns, particularly for cell culture-based studies.
    The suggested patterns would significantly improve detection of similar tools in future publications.
    All five observations extracted provide valuable information about tool performance and characteristics.
