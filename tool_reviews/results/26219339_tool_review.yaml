  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple high-confidence research tools were missed including cell lines, genetic reagents, and antibodies
    - The publication contains extensive experimental methods with clear tool usage
    - Mining patterns appear insufficient for capturing specialized research tools in this domain
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous legitimate research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The suggested patterns should be implemented to capture cell lines with alphanumeric naming, TRC catalog numbers,
    CRISPR constructs, and fluorophore-conjugated antibodies. All 10 potentially missed tools should be added as they
    represent genuine research tools with clear experimental usage context. The mining system needs improvement for
    capturing specialized molecular biology tools and reagents commonly used in NF research.
