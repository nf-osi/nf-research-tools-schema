  title: "Spectrophotometric and computational characterization of charge transfer complex of selumetinib with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone and its utilization in developing an innovative green and high throughput microwell assay for analysis of bulk form and pharmaceutical formulation."

    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is analytical chemistry research developing a spectrophotometric assay for selumetinib (NF drug) analysis.
    Expected tools: computational tools (GAMESS software, analysis software), laboratory instrumentation,
    and potentially chemical reagents. No biological tools (antibodies, cell lines, animal models) expected
    as this is pharmaceutical analytical chemistry, not biological research.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is analytical chemistry research focused on developing a spectrophotometric assay for selumetinib analysis.
    The study uses computational tools (GAMESS software, DFT calculations) and analytical instrumentation but no biological research tools.
    While selumetinib is an NF drug, this publication focuses on pharmaceutical analysis methods rather than NF biology or treatment.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite clear computational tool usage
    - Publication is analytical chemistry research, not biological NF research
    - Multiple computational chemistry software tools were missed by mining patterns
    - Focus is on pharmaceutical analysis methods rather than NF biology
  recommendations: |
    Four computational tools should be added that were missed by initial mining:
    GAMESS software, Multiwfn 3.7, VMD, and SoftMax Pro Enterprise software.
    These are legitimate research tools used for computational chemistry analysis.
    New patterns should be added for quantum chemistry software and molecular visualization tools.
    While this publication involves selumetinib (an NF drug), it's pharmaceutical analytical chemistry
    rather than NF biological research, so no biological tools are expected.
