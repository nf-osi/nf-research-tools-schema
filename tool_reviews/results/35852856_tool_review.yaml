    Cannot determine expected tool types because the input file is completely empty.
    
    The file `/home/runner/work/nf-research-tools-schema/nf-research-tools-schema/tool_reviews/inputs/35852856_input.json`
    exists in the directory but contains no data (0 bytes). Without publication content, it's impossible to:
    - Determine the publication type (lab research, clinical study, review, etc.)
    - Identify what research tools might be present
    - Assess whether tools were correctly mined or missed
    - Extract any scientific observations
    
    This represents a data pipeline issue rather than a tool mining validation problem.
  overallAssessment: |
    The input file for PMID 35852856 is completely empty, containing no publication metadata, abstract,
    full text sections, or mining metrics. This prevents any meaningful tool validation analysis.
    This appears to be a data pipeline or file generation issue that needs to be resolved before
    tool validation can proceed.

toolValidations: []  # No tools to validate - input file is empty

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Input file 35852856_input.json exists but cannot be read or accessed
    - File appears empty, has permission restrictions, or encoding issues
    - This may be a systemic issue affecting multiple files in the inputs directory (73+ files present)
    - Cannot perform tool validation without access to publication content
    - Represents a data pipeline or file access problem rather than a mining validation issue
    - Investigation shows broader potential issues with input file accessibility
  recommendations: |
    - URGENT: Investigate file access and permission issues in the inputs directory
    - Check file encoding, permissions, and data pipeline integrity
    - Verify that input files are being properly generated and populated
    - This publication cannot be validated until file access issues are resolved
    - Consider checking other input files for similar access problems
    - May need system administrator intervention to resolve file access issues
    - Once file is accessible, re-run tool validation process
    - Document this as a known issue affecting the tool review pipeline
