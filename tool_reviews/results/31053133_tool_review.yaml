  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a questionnaire development and validation study, which would typically contain:
    - Clinical assessment tools (the primary BoN questionnaire being developed)
    - Existing validated questionnaires used for external validity (DLQI, PSS, SF12)
    - Computational tools for statistical analysis (SAS 9.4, PROC CALIS)
    
    This type of study focuses on developing patient-reported outcome measures rather than
    laboratory research tools. The tools are clinical assessment instruments for measuring
    disease burden and quality of life in NF1 patients.
  overallAssessment: |
    This questionnaire development study is highly likely to contain clinical assessment tools
    as the primary research output. The study develops the BoN questionnaire and validates it
    against existing instruments. Statistical software for psychometric analysis is also expected.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a questionnaire development study
    - Multiple clinical assessment tools are clearly present but were missed
    - The primary research output (BoN questionnaire) was not detected
    - Statistical software tools used for validation were not captured
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains multiple valid research tools that were completely missed:
    - The newly developed BoN questionnaire is the primary research output
    - Three validated clinical assessment tools (DLQI, PSS, SF12) used for external validity
    - Statistical software (SAS 9.4, PROC CALIS) used for psychometric analysis
    All missed tools should be added as they represent legitimate research instruments.
    The mining patterns need improvement for clinical assessment tool detection.
