    Clinical Study → clinical assessment tools (patient-reported outcome measures, questionnaires, scales)
    This publication specifically focuses on evaluating and recommending patient-reported outcome measures 
    for NF1 clinical trials, so clinical assessment tools are highly expected.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a clinical research paper that systematically reviews and evaluates patient-reported outcome 
    measures for assessing appearance concerns in NF1 clinical trials. The publication explicitly discusses 
    multiple clinical assessment tools and makes specific recommendations, so clinical assessment tools 
    should definitely be present. The mining appears to have missed several important tools.

    pattern: "FACE-Q [A-Za-z\\s-]+ scale"
    toolType: "clinical_assessment_tool"
    examples: ["FACE-Q Craniofacial Module-Appearance Distress scale"]
    reasoning: "FACE-Q is a well-known family of patient-reported outcome measures in plastic surgery and appearance research. This pattern would catch specific FACE-Q modules."

    pattern: "Patient-Reported Outcome Rating and Acceptance Tool"
    toolType: "clinical_assessment_tool"
    examples: ["Patient-Reported Outcome Rating and Acceptance Tool for Endpoints"]
    reasoning: "This is a specific evaluation tool for assessing patient-reported outcome measures. The full name should be captured."

    toolType: "clinical_assessment_tool"
    examples: ["scale was the top-rated measure", "Tool then was used to evaluate"]
    reasoning: "Clinical assessment tools are often described with these usage verbs, which could help identify tools in clinical contexts."

    reasoning: "Many patient-reported outcome measures follow the pattern of abbreviated name + descriptive module/scale name."

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Mining completely missed clinical assessment tools in a paper specifically about patient-reported outcome measures
    - The main recommendation (FACE-Q Craniofacial Module-Appearance Distress scale) was not detected
    - A methodological tool (Patient-Reported Outcome Rating and Acceptance Tool for Endpoints) was missed
    - Paper mentions "Eleven measures" were reviewed but none were captured individually
    - This represents a significant gap in clinical assessment tool detection
  recommendations: |
    This publication should have detected at least 2-3 clinical assessment tools, particularly the FACE-Q 
    Craniofacial Module-Appearance Distress scale which is the main recommendation. The mining patterns 
    for clinical assessment tools need improvement to catch:
    1. Specific named scales and questionnaires (especially FACE-Q family)
    2. Evaluation tools used in systematic reviews
    3. Patient-reported outcome measures mentioned in clinical contexts
    
    The suggested patterns should be implemented to improve detection of clinical assessment tools in 
    similar publications. No observations could be extracted due to lack of Results/Discussion sections, 
    but the abstract provides clear evidence of tool usage and recommendations.
