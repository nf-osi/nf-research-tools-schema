  hasMethodsSection: No
  likelyContainsTools: Yes
  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a questionnaire/survey development study, which typically develops and validates clinical assessment tools.
    Expected tool types:
    - Clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, scales, patient-reported outcome measures)
    - Computational tools (statistical software for psychometric analysis - IRT, EFA, CFA)
    
    The study develops new PROMIS pediatric stigma scales and uses existing validated instruments,
    which are legitimate clinical assessment tools even without traditional lab methods.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication is a psychometric study developing new clinical assessment tools (PROMIS Pediatric Stigma scales).
    Such studies routinely develop, validate, and use clinical assessment instruments, which are legitimate research tools.
    The absence of a Methods section is typical for instrument development papers where methodology is described in the abstract and results.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were mined from this publication despite it being a clear instrument development study
    - Three major clinical assessment tools were completely missed: PROMIS Pediatric Stigma, PROMIS Pediatric Stigma: Skin, and Neuro-QoL Stigma
    - Statistical analysis methods (EFA, CFA, IRT) used for psychometric validation were also missed
    - The mining system appears to lack patterns for detecting PROMIS instruments and psychometric analysis methods
    - This represents a significant gap in clinical assessment tool detection
  recommendations: |
    - All 6 potentially missed tools should be added to improve mining coverage
    - The suggested patterns should be implemented to catch PROMIS instruments and psychometric methods
    - This publication demonstrates the need for better pattern coverage of instrument development studies
    - No observations could be extracted due to lack of Results/Discussion sections in the available text
    - The mining system needs improvement for detecting clinical assessment tools in instrument development contexts
    - Consider adding patterns for other major clinical assessment frameworks (PedsQL, SF-36, etc.)
