  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a cross-sectional clinical study examining quality of life in NF1 and NF2 patients.
    Expected tool types:
    - Clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, scales, outcome measures) - PRIMARY
    - Computational tools (statistical software for analysis) - SECONDARY
    
    The study administered multiple validated questionnaires to patients and used statistical
    software for analysis. Clinical assessment tools are the primary focus, with computational
    tools used for data analysis. No lab research tools expected.
  overallAssessment: |
    This clinical study would typically contain multiple clinical assessment tools as it involves
    administering validated questionnaires and scales to patients. The methods section clearly
    describes several standardized instruments used to measure quality of life, pain, and
    disease-specific outcomes. Statistical analysis tools would also be expected for data processing.

      NF1 and NF2 patients had significantly lower scores in all domains of the SF-36 compared to the Canadian general population (P < .005). NF2 patients had lower scores than NF1 patients in Social Functioning and General Health domains (P-values .02 and .016, respectively). The SF-36 showed good correlation with other quality of life measures and was sensitive to detecting quality of life differences in NF populations.

      Cronbach's alpha for the PedsQL NF1 was 0.96, indicating excellent internal consistency. The domains with the lowest scores (worse quality of life) were perceived physical appearance, worry, cognitive, emotion, fatigue, and pain. Total PedsQL NF1 scores were obtained for 153 patients, with less than 10% missing values except for the sexual domain (18% missing). Perceived physical appearance was identified as the main predictor of mental well-being in NF1 patients.

      The Ablon visibility index is used to rate disease visibility in NF1 patients while fully dressed. Visibility ranges from 1 (mild, no visible tumors outside normal clothing areas) to 3 (indicating numerous visible tumors in the face or neck, or visible limp). In this study, when examined by clinicians using the Ablon index, no correlation with mental health was found; however, self-reported physical appearance was a major driver of mental health-related quality of life.

      The House and Brackmann facial nerve scale rates facial nerve impairments from 1 (normal symmetric function) to 6 (indicating complete paralysis). In this NF2 cohort, 63% had Grade 1 (normal function), 23% had Grades 2 and 3, and 14% had Grades 5 and 6 (severe impairment). This scale is specifically useful for assessing facial nerve function in NF2 patients who commonly develop vestibular schwannomas affecting facial nerve function.

      R statistical software version 3.5.1 was used for all statistical analyses including correlation analyses, regression modeling, and bootstrapping procedures. The software was used to perform t-tests, calculate correlation coefficients, build multivariable regression models, and conduct bootstrap validation with 100 repetitions to account for overfitting. Bonferroni correction was applied when appropriate.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: No tools were initially mined despite this being a clinical study with multiple validated assessment instruments
    - Mining patterns failed to capture standard clinical assessment tools (SF-36, EQ-5D-5L, PROMIS, PedsQL)
    - Disease-specific questionnaires (NFTI-QOL, PedsQL NF1 module) were not detected
    - Clinical rating scales (Ablon index, House and Brackmann scale) were missed
    - Statistical software (R version 3.5.1) was not captured
    - This represents a significant gap in clinical assessment tool mining coverage
  recommendations: |
    - ALL 8 potentially missed tools should be added to the database - they are clearly validated research instruments
    - Implement suggested patterns to capture clinical assessment tools, especially standard QOL measures
    - Add patterns for hyphenated tool names (EQ-5D-5L, NFTI-QOL) and disease-specific modules (PedsQL NF1)
    - Include context patterns for scale administration and completion
    - Add statistical software detection with version numbers
    - This publication demonstrates excellent examples of clinical assessment tools that should be systematically captured
    - The extracted observations provide valuable information about tool performance and correlations in NF populations
    - Consider this publication as a reference case for improving clinical assessment tool mining patterns
