  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining failed to capture any tools despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple cell lines (S462TY, iSC, ST88-14, A549, MCF10A) were completely missed
    - Several antibodies with catalog numbers were not detected
    - Mouse strains used for xenograft studies were not captured
    - Computational tools including custom MR analysis software were missed
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The study involves extensive cell culture work, Western blotting, xenograft models, and computational analysis.
    All 16 potentially missed tools should be added to the database as they represent genuine research tools
    with clear experimental usage context. The suggested patterns should be implemented to improve
    future mining of similar laboratory research publications. No observations were extracted since
    no tools were initially validated, but this publication would likely contain valuable phenotypic
    and experimental observations once tools are properly captured.
