  majorIssuesFound: |
    Critical mining failure - no tools were identified despite extensive tool usage:
    - 5 different cell lines used in experiments (S462TY, iSC, A549, ST88-14, MCF10A)
    - 3 animal model strains (NOD SCID mice, Balb/c mice, Sprague-Dawley rats)
    - 6 different antibodies with catalog numbers for Western blot
    - 3 computational tools for data analysis (CompuSyn, SPSS, SPIN)
    - All tools have clear experimental context and vendor information
    - This represents a complete failure of the mining system for this publication type
  recommendations: |
    URGENT: Complete overhaul of mining patterns needed for this publication type:
    - All 17 identified tools should be added to the database
    - The suggested patterns should be implemented immediately
    - This publication demonstrates major gaps in cell line, antibody, and animal model recognition
    - Mining system failed to catch even standard, well-known research tools (A549, GAPDH antibody, NOD SCID mice)
    - Need better recognition of vendor/catalog number patterns
    - Software tools with version numbers should be automatically recognized
    - This level of mining failure suggests systematic issues that likely affect many other publications
