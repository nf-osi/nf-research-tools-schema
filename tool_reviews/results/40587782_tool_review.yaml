  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Mining system completely failed to detect any tools from this publication
    - This is a comprehensive lab research study with extensive tool usage across multiple categories
    - 29 clear research tools were missed, including:
      * 9 antibodies with vendor/catalog information
      * 7 cell lines (patient-derived and established lines)
      * 4 genetic reagents (plasmids, CRISPR vectors)
      * 9 computational tools (bioinformatics software, analysis packages)
    - All tools have clear experimental context and vendor/catalog information
    - Mining patterns appear to be inadequate for detecting standard research tools
  recommendations: |
    - URGENT: Review and update mining patterns to capture basic research tools
    - All 29 identified tools should be added to the database - they are clearly genuine research tools
    - Implement suggested patterns to improve future mining accuracy
    - This publication demonstrates major gaps in current mining capabilities
    - Consider manual curation for publications with extensive Methods sections
    - The mining system needs significant improvement to handle standard lab research publications
    - Focus on vendor/catalog number patterns and standard tool nomenclature
    - No observations could be extracted since no tools were initially validated
