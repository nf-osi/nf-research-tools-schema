  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Extensive use of cell lines, antibodies, genetic constructs, and computational tools not captured
    - Mining patterns appear to miss standard research tools with catalog numbers and versions
    - 3D spheroid models and CAR constructs not recognized as research tools
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The study uses multiple cell lines (293T, sNF96.2, K562, NCI-H266, HFFs), antibodies with catalog numbers,
    genetic constructs (CAR vectors, packaging plasmids), computational tools (BWA, GATK, ANNOVAR, TIDE),
    and advanced cellular models (3D spheroids). All identified tools should be added to improve coverage.
    The suggested patterns would significantly improve mining accuracy for similar publications.
    No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated, but this study contains
    extensive experimental data that would yield valuable observations once tools are properly identified.
