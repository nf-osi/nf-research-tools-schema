    Clinical Trial → clinical assessment tools (outcome measures, functional assessments, imaging protocols), 
    computational tools for statistical analysis. This phase 2 clinical trial evaluates therapeutic efficacy 
    using standardized clinical assessment tools including:
    - Imaging response criteria (2D and 3D volumetric MRI analysis)
    - Functional assessment tools (polysomnography, pulmonary function tests, video laryngoscopy)
    - Toxicity grading systems (NCI CTCAE v4.0)
    - Performance status scales (Lansky/Karnofsky)
    - Statistical analysis software (Stata 15)
    - Sleep study measures (apnea-hypopnea index)
    - REiNS outcome recommendations
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a phase 2 clinical trial that extensively uses clinical assessment tools for patient evaluation,
    outcome measurement, and safety monitoring. Clinical trials routinely employ validated assessment instruments,
    imaging protocols, statistical software, and standardized grading systems. The study includes detailed
    methods for functional assessments, sleep studies, imaging analysis, and toxicity monitoring - all of which
    represent legitimate research tools that should have been captured by mining algorithms.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Complete failure to mine any tools from a clinical trial that extensively uses clinical assessment tools
    - Mining algorithms missed all standardized clinical assessment instruments (NCI CTCAE, performance status scales)
    - Failed to capture sleep study tools (polysomnography, apnea-hypopnea index) despite detailed methods
    - Statistical analysis software (Stata 15) with clear version number not detected
    - Disease-specific outcome guidelines (REiNS recommendations) not recognized
    - Functional assessment tools (pulmonary function tests, video laryngoscopy) completely missed
  recommendations: |
    This publication represents a significant mining failure - a phase 2 clinical trial with extensive use of 
    clinical assessment tools yielded zero mined tools. At least 12 legitimate research tools were missed, 
    including:
    
    CRITICAL MISSES:
    - NCI CTCAE v4.0 (toxicity grading) - universally used in clinical trials
    - Lansky/Karnofsky performance status - standard oncology assessment tools
    - Stata 15 - statistical analysis software with clear version
    - Polysomnography and sleep study measures - primary outcome tools
    - REiNS outcome recommendations - disease-specific guidelines
    
    IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED:
    1. Add all 12 suggested patterns to improve clinical assessment tool mining
    2. Review mining algorithms for clinical trial publications specifically
    3. Ensure computational tools with version numbers are captured
    4. Add context-based patterns for "graded according to" and "analyzed using"
    5. Include sleep study and pulmonary function assessment tools
    
    This publication should be re-mined after pattern improvements to validate effectiveness.
    No observations could be extracted since no tools were validated for acceptance.
