  expectedToolTypes: |
    Cannot determine expected tool types due to empty input file.
    Based on PMID 37174087, this appears to be a clinical research publication,
    but without access to the content, no assessment can be made regarding
    tool usage or types.
  overallAssessment: |
    Critical data pipeline issue: The input file 37174087_input.json exists in the
    inputs directory but contains no data. This prevents any meaningful analysis
    of tool usage, publication type, or content assessment. This represents a
    data ingestion or processing failure that needs investigation.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Input file 37174087_input.json exists but is completely empty
    - No publication metadata available for analysis
    - No abstract, methods, or full text content accessible
    - Cannot perform tool validation without source content
    - Data pipeline failure - file should contain structured JSON with publication data
  recommendations: |
    URGENT DATA PIPELINE INVESTIGATION REQUIRED:
    
    1. Investigate why 37174087_input.json exists but contains no data
    2. Check data extraction/ingestion process for this PMID
    3. Verify if this publication exists in source databases
    4. Re-run data extraction for PMID 37174087 if publication is valid
    5. Remove empty file if publication is invalid or inaccessible
    6. Audit other input files for similar empty file issues
    
    This review cannot be completed until valid input data is provided.
    No tool validation, pattern suggestions, or observations can be extracted
    from an empty file. This represents a critical failure in the data
    processing pipeline that must be addressed before meaningful analysis
    can proceed.
    
    STATUS: BLOCKED - Requires data pipeline remediation
