    Review Article → Generally does not contain specific research tools suitable for database inclusion.
    Review articles typically discuss tools in general terms or cite tools from other studies without
    providing the specific details (catalog numbers, vendors, protocols) needed for tool databases.
    This publication describes a consortium and collaborative model rather than reporting primary
    experimental research that would use specific antibodies, cell lines, animal models, etc.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a review article describing the Neurofibromatosis Preclinical Consortium (NFPC) collaborative
    model for drug development. Review articles typically do not contain specific research tools suitable
    for database inclusion, as they discuss tools in general terms rather than reporting primary experimental
    usage with specific details like catalog numbers, vendors, or protocols.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a review article describing a collaborative consortium model, not primary research
    - No Methods section indicating experimental procedures
    - Only abstract text available - no detailed experimental sections
    - Generic mentions of "genetically engineered mouse models" without specific strain details
    - Focus is on describing collaborative framework rather than reporting tool usage
  recommendations: |
    This publication should not contribute tools to the database. It is a review article describing
    the Neurofibromatosis Preclinical Consortium collaborative model rather than reporting primary
    experimental research. While it mentions "genetically engineered mouse models" in general terms,
    it does not provide the specific details (strain names, genetic modifications, vendors, catalog
    numbers) that would make these useful database entries. The mining correctly identified zero
    tools from this publication. No additional tools should be added, and no new mining patterns
    are needed based on this review article.
