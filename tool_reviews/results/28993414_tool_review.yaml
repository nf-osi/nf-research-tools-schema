  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on the publication being about a Preclinical Consortium with only abstract and introduction sections:
    - Review Article/Consortium Paper → Unlikely to contain actual research tools
    - May reference tools used by consortium members but not use them directly
    - Could mention computational tools, animal models, or cell lines in review context
    - Without Methods, Results, or Discussion sections, tool usage is highly unlikely
    
    Note: Consortium papers typically describe collaborative frameworks rather than specific experimental work.
    Any tool mentions would likely be citations of other work rather than direct usage.
  overallAssessment: |
    This appears to be a consortium/review paper describing the Neurofibromatosis Preclinical Consortium framework.
    Without Methods, Results, or Discussion sections, it's highly unlikely to contain genuine research tools.
    Such papers typically focus on collaborative strategies and may cite tools from member studies but don't use them directly.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication appears to be a consortium/review paper rather than experimental research
    - No Methods section available indicating lack of experimental procedures
    - No Results or Discussion sections available for tool usage assessment
    - Only abstract and introduction sections were extracted
    - Zero tools mined across all categories, which is consistent with publication type
  recommendations: |
    - No action needed - zero tools mined is appropriate for this publication type
    - Consortium/review papers typically don't use research tools directly
    - Any future similar consortium papers can be expected to have minimal tool content
    - This publication validates that the mining system correctly identifies non-experimental papers
    - Consider flagging consortium/review papers early in the pipeline to skip detailed tool mining
