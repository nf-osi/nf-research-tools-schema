    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a laboratory research study using iPSC-derived microglia models, so we expect:
    - Cell lines (iPSC lines, hiMGL cells)
    - Antibodies (for immunocytochemistry)
    - Genetic reagents (NF1 mutant constructs)
    - Computational tools (for RNA-seq analysis, imaging)
    - Animal models (mentioned Nf1-mutant mice in abstract)
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study that generates and characterizes human iPSC-derived microglia-like cells with NF1 mutations. The extensive Methods section describes multiple experimental approaches including cell culture, immunocytochemistry, electrophysiology, RNA sequencing, and functional assays. This type of study typically uses numerous research tools including cell lines, antibodies, reagents, and computational analysis software. Clinical assessment tools are not expected as this is purely laboratory-based research using cellular models.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive laboratory research study
    - Extensive Methods section contains numerous research tools that should have been detected
    - Multiple cell lines, antibodies, commercial kits, and software tools are clearly described
    - Mining patterns appear to be missing key tool categories used in iPSC and microglia research
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous legitimate research tools that were completely missed by the initial mining:
    - Multiple iPSC-derived cell lines (CTL BJFF.6, NF1-mutant lines, hiMGL cells)
    - Several antibodies for immunocytochemistry (IBA1, OCT3/4, NANOG, TRA-1-60, SSEA-4)
    - Commercial reagent kits (STEMdiff, mycoplasma test, ELISA, multiplex assay)
    - Multiple computational tools (Partek Flow, STAR, DESeq2, Imaris, IncuCyte, Karyostudio, TIDA)
    - Potential animal model (Nf1-mutant mice, though from previous work)
    
    The mining patterns need significant improvement to capture:
    - iPSC-derived cell line nomenclature
    - Commercial kit naming conventions
    - Bioinformatics software in RNA-seq workflows
    - Image analysis and live cell imaging systems
    - Antibody naming with anti- prefix
    
    All 19 potentially missed tools should be added to improve coverage of this important NF1 research publication.
