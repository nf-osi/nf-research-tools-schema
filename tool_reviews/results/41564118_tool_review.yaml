  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple categories of research tools are extensively used but were missed
    - Cell lines developed as main research output were not detected
    - Antibodies with catalog numbers and vendors were not captured
    - Bioinformatics tools and pipelines were not identified
    - Genetic reagents (vectors, constructs) used for immortalization were missed
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous legitimate research tools that should be added to the database:
    - 14 immortalized cell lines developed as the main research output
    - Multiple antibodies with specific catalog numbers used in Western blots
    - Genetic reagents (vectors, cDNAs) used for cell immortalization
    - Bioinformatics tools and pipelines used for genomic analysis
    - The mining patterns need significant improvement to capture NF-specific cell line nomenclature
    - Antibody detection patterns should include vendor/catalog number context
    - Bioinformatics tool patterns should include nf-core pipelines and GitHub URLs
    - All potentially missed tools should be manually reviewed and likely added
