    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a molecular biology study using cell culture, xenograft models, and biochemical assays.
    Expected tools include cell lines (NIH-3T3), antibodies for Western blot, plasmids/vectors,
    mouse models for xenografts, and potentially computational tools for data analysis.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study investigating p21-activated kinases in NF2 using cell-based models.
    The study includes cell culture, molecular biology techniques, xenograft experiments, and biochemical assays,
    indicating high likelihood of research tool usage. The comprehensive Methods section describes experimental
    procedures that would require multiple research tools including cell lines, antibodies, plasmids, and animal models.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple clear research tools present in Methods section were completely missed
    - Cell lines, antibodies, plasmids, and mouse models all present but not detected
    - Mining patterns appear to be failing to capture standard research tools
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The Methods section clearly describes experimental procedures using cell lines (NIH-3T3, φNX),
    antibodies (Pak1, Pak2, Merlin, phospho-Pak1-3), genetic reagents (pBMN-I-GFP, GST-PID),
    animal models (BALB/c nu/nu mice), and advanced cellular models (Matrigel invasion chambers).
    All 10 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine research tools
    used experimentally in this study. The mining patterns need significant improvement to
    capture standard laboratory tools, especially in the antibody and cell line categories.
    No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated.
