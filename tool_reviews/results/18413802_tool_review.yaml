  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple cell lines, antibodies, reagents, and software tools are clearly present in the methods
    - Mining patterns appear to be missing common research tool naming conventions
    - Cell line names (MPNST, ST8814, LS141, DDLS) were not detected
    - Commercial kits and antibodies with vendor information were missed
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous legitimate research tools that were completely missed by initial mining:
    - 4 human tumor cell lines used as experimental models
    - Multiple antibodies for Western blotting
    - Commercial assay kits with catalog numbers
    - siRNA constructs with specific sequences
    - Flow cytometry analysis software
    All potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine research reagents used in experiments.
    The mining patterns need significant improvement to capture standard molecular biology tools.
    Since no tools were initially validated, no observations could be extracted, but this study likely contains valuable phenotypic data about drug responses.
