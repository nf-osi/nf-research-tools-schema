    This is a methodology paper describing orthotopic xenografting procedures for MPNST research.
    Expected tools include: cell lines (MPNST lines), animal models (immunodeficient mice), 
    patient-derived models (xenograft systems), and computational tools (bioluminescence imaging).
    
    Note: While no formal Methods section exists, the entire paper IS a detailed methodology 
    description with protocols and procedures.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory methodology paper describing orthotopic xenografting techniques for 
    malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor research. Despite lacking a traditional Methods 
    section, the entire publication serves as a detailed protocol describing experimental 
    procedures, making it highly likely to contain research tools including cell lines, 
    animal models, and imaging systems.

      Cell line requires empirical determination of key parameters for orthotopic xenografting including:
      - Number of cells initially grafted (10³ to 5×10⁶ range tested)
      - Time allowed for graft development (30-60 days optimal)
      - Injection volume (up to 5 mL for larger cell numbers)
      - Maximum cell density (5×10⁶ cells per 5 mL to prevent shear damage)
      Successful grafting achieved with concentrations reaching maximal tumor growth within 30-60 days.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Complete failure to capture any tools despite this being a methodology paper rich in research tools
    - Multiple cell lines (ST88-14, STS-26T, T265-2c) not detected
    - Animal model (NIH III mice) not captured
    - Patient-derived xenograft model system not recognized
    - Bioluminescence imaging system not identified
    - Mining patterns appear inadequate for alphanumeric cell line nomenclature
    - Xenograft systems not recognized as patient-derived models
  recommendations: |
    This publication should have captured multiple tools across several categories:
    - All 8 potentially missed tools should be added to the database
    - Mining patterns need significant improvement for cell line nomenclature
    - Xenograft methodologies should be recognized as patient-derived model systems
    - Imaging systems require better pattern coverage
    - The 5 suggested patterns should be implemented to improve future mining
    - This represents a major mining failure that needs systematic pattern review
    - All 7 extracted observations provide valuable usage and phenotypic information
    - Manual curator review recommended for similar methodology papers
