  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining completely missed this tool-rich publication
    - Multiple categories of tools present: animal models, antibodies, computational tools, genetic reagents
    - Sophisticated experimental design with extensive tool usage not captured
    - Methods section contains detailed protocols with specific tool names, vendors, and catalog numbers
  recommendations: |
    This publication represents a significant mining failure - it contains numerous high-quality research tools across multiple categories that were completely missed. The suggested patterns should be implemented to capture:
    1. Mouse strain nomenclature with conditional alleles
    2. Antibody clone designations with vendors
    3. R/Bioconductor package names
    4. Microarray platform names
    5. Common software usage phrases
    All potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine research tools with clear experimental usage context.
