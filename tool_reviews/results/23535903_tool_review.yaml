    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a comprehensive molecular biology study involving cell culture, animal models, immunohistochemistry,
    western blotting, gene expression analysis, and xenograft experiments. Expected tools include:
    - Antibodies for IHC and western blot
    - Cell lines (immortalized Schwann cells, MPNST lines)
    - Animal models (nude mice for xenografts)
    - Genetic reagents (shRNAs, plasmids, constructs)
    - Computational tools for microarray analysis
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study investigating Wnt signaling in Schwann cell tumors.
    The extensive Methods section describes multiple experimental approaches including cell culture, molecular biology,
    immunohistochemistry, animal models, and bioinformatics analysis, indicating high likelihood of research tool usage.
    Clinical assessment tools are unlikely given the focus on cellular and molecular mechanisms rather than patient outcomes.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Extensive Methods section contains numerous research tools that should have been detected
    - Multiple tool categories present: antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools
    - All tool mentions have clear experimental context and vendor information
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains extensive research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    All 25 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine research tools with:
    - Clear experimental usage context in Methods section
    - Vendor information and technical specifications
    - Standard nomenclature for their respective tool types
    The suggested patterns would significantly improve detection of similar tools in future mining.
    No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated, but this study likely contains
    valuable phenotypic and functional data that could be extracted once tools are properly validated.
