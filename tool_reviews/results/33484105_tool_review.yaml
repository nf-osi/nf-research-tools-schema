  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on publication type (Lab Research with genomic analysis):
    - Computational tools (software, pipelines) - HIGHLY EXPECTED for WGS analysis
    - Genetic reagents - POSSIBLE for DNA extraction/library prep kits
    - Clinical assessment tools - UNLIKELY for this type of molecular study
    - Antibodies, cell lines, animal models - UNLIKELY for cfDNA plasma study
    - Advanced cellular models, PDX models - UNLIKELY for plasma-based study

    This is a molecular genomics study using cfDNA whole-genome sequencing with extensive
    computational analysis. Multiple computational tools and analysis pipelines are expected.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study involving cfDNA extraction, whole-genome sequencing, and
    extensive computational analysis. The publication should contain numerous computational tools
    for sequence analysis, copy number analysis, and fragmentomics. The extensive methods section
    describes multiple software tools and analysis pipelines that should have been captured.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    Critical mining failure - this publication contains numerous research tools that were completely missed:
    - 14 clear research tools identified in methods section
    - 5 genetic reagents (commercial kits and reagents with vendors)
    - 9 computational tools (software, platforms, analysis tools with versions)
    - All tools have clear usage context and vendor/version information
    - This represents a major failure of the mining algorithm for this publication type
  recommendations: |
    URGENT: Complete re-mining of this publication is required. The mining algorithm failed to capture
    any of the 14+ research tools clearly present in the methods section. This suggests:
    
    1. Mining patterns are inadequate for genomics/bioinformatics publications
    2. Commercial kit names with vendors are not being captured
    3. Software tools with version numbers are not being captured
    4. Sequencing platforms and instruments are not being captured
    
    All 14 identified tools should be added to the database as they represent genuine research tools
    with clear experimental usage context. The suggested patterns should be implemented to prevent
    similar mining failures in genomics publications.
    
    This publication demonstrates the need for specialized mining patterns for:
    - Molecular biology kits and reagents
    - Bioinformatics software and pipelines  
    - Sequencing platforms and instruments
    - Statistical analysis software
