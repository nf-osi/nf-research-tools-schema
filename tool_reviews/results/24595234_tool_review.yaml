    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a molecular biology study using Drosophila as a model system to test human NF2 gene function.
    Expected tools include: genetic reagents (transgenes, constructs), animal models (Drosophila strains),
    antibodies (for immunofluorescence), and potentially computational tools for analysis.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study using Drosophila genetics to functionally analyze human NF2 gene variants.
    The study involves creating transgenic flies, genetic rescue experiments, and immunofluorescence analysis.
    Multiple research tools are expected including genetic constructs, fly strains, antibodies, and microscopy equipment.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a clear laboratory research study
    - Multiple genetic reagents, antibodies, and equipment were missed in the initial mining
    - Drosophila-specific nomenclature and tools may not be well covered by current patterns
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The study uses standard molecular biology and Drosophila genetics approaches with clear tool usage.
    All 8 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine research reagents.
    New patterns should be implemented to better capture Drosophila genetic tools and standard lab equipment.
    The mining system needs improvement for model organism-specific nomenclature and genetic reagents.
