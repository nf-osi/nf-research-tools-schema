    This is a molecular biology/genetics study using Drosophila as a model system to study human NF2 gene function.
    Expected tools include:
    - Animal models (Drosophila strains, transgenic lines)
    - Genetic reagents (transgenes, plasmids, constructs)
    - Antibodies (for immunofluorescence)
    - Computational tools (for imaging, analysis)
    
    The publication has extensive Methods section describing experimental procedures, genetic crosses,
    immunofluorescence, microscopy, and quantitative PCR - all indicating active lab research.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a clear laboratory research study using Drosophila genetics to functionally analyze human NF2 gene variants.
    The study involves creating transgenic flies, genetic rescue experiments, immunofluorescence microscopy, and phenotypic analysis.
    Multiple research tools should be present including animal models, genetic reagents, antibodies, and computational tools.
    The extensive Methods section and experimental design strongly indicate this publication should contain numerous research tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: No tools were mined from this publication despite it being a clear laboratory research study
    - Publication contains extensive experimental methods with multiple research tools that should have been detected
    - 18 clear research tools were missed including animal models, genetic reagents, antibodies, and computational tools
    - Mining patterns appear to be inadequate for Drosophila genetics research
    - Standard molecular biology reagents and equipment were not detected
    - Antibodies with clear vendor information and dilutions were missed
  recommendations: |
    - ALL 18 identified tools should be added to the database - this represents a complete mining failure
    - Urgent need to add Drosophila-specific patterns for animal models and genetic reagents
    - Add patterns for standard molecular biology reagents (Trizol, mounting media, etc.)
    - Improve antibody detection patterns to catch host species + anti-target format
    - Add patterns for microscopy equipment and imaging software
    - Add patterns for qPCR systems and molecular biology kits
    - This publication demonstrates major gaps in current mining patterns for model organism research
    - Consider manual review of other Drosophila/model organism publications to identify similar missed tools
    - The 9 suggested patterns should be implemented to improve future mining accuracy
    - 7 high-quality scientific observations were extracted showing functional differences between NF2 isoforms
