  expectedToolTypes: |
    Unable to determine expected tool types because the input file 38086517_input.json 
    does not exist in the repository. The file should be located at:
    /home/runner/work/nf-research-tools-schema/nf-research-tools-schema/tool_reviews/inputs/38086517_input.json
    
    To complete this analysis, the following information would be needed:
    - Publication metadata (title, DOI, journal, year, queryType)
    - Abstract text
    - Full text sections (Methods, Introduction, Results, Discussion if available)
    - List of mined tools with their types and context
  overallAssessment: |
    Cannot perform tool validation because the required input file is missing.
    The file 38086517_input.json was not found in the expected location.
    This could indicate:
    1. The file has not been generated yet
    2. The PMID is incorrect
    3. The file is located in a different directory
    4. There was an error in the mining process for this publication

    CRITICAL ISSUE: Input file not found
    - The file 38086517_input.json does not exist in the repository
    - Located searched: /home/runner/work/nf-research-tools-schema/nf-research-tools-schema/tool_reviews/inputs/
    - Repository contains other input files (e.g., 38175707_input.json, 38216587_input.json) but not this specific PMID
    - Cannot proceed with tool validation without the required input data
  recommendations: |
    To complete the tool validation for PMID 38086517:
    
    1. VERIFY PMID: Confirm that 38086517 is the correct PubMed ID
    
    2. GENERATE INPUT FILE: Create the missing input file with the following structure:
       - Publication metadata (PMID, title, DOI, journal, year, queryType)
       - Abstract text
       - Full text sections (Methods, Introduction, Results, Discussion)
       - List of mined tools with types and context snippets
    
    3. FILE LOCATION: Place the file at:
       /home/runner/work/nf-research-tools-schema/nf-research-tools-schema/tool_reviews/inputs/38086517_input.json
    
    4. RETRY VALIDATION: Once the input file is available, re-run the tool validation process
    
    5. ALTERNATIVE: If this PMID should not be processed, remove it from the validation queue
    
    The tool validation workflow is ready to proceed once the input file becomes available.
    The analysis framework can handle all 9 tool types (antibodies, cell lines, animal models, 
    genetic reagents, computational tools, advanced cellular models, patient-derived models, 
    clinical assessment tools) and will extract scientific observations from validated tools.
