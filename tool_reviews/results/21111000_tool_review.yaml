    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is clearly a laboratory research study developing an in vivo tumor model using cell lines,
    animal models, and imaging techniques. Expected tools include cell lines (HEI-193), animal models
    (nude mice), antibodies (S100), and potentially computational tools for imaging analysis.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study developing a novel schwannoma tumor model using cell lines
    implanted in mice. The study involves experimental procedures with cell culture, animal surgery,
    and immunohistochemistry, making it highly likely to contain multiple research tools including
    cell lines, animal models, and antibodies.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining failed to capture any tools despite this being a clear lab research study
    - Multiple research tools are present including cell lines, animal models, antibodies, and genetic reagents
    - Mining patterns appear insufficient for capturing standard laboratory tools in NF research
  recommendations: |
    All 6 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine research tools used
    in this experimental study. The HEI-193 cell line, nude mice, S100 antibody, and reporter
    genes (mCherry, Fluc) are all legitimate research tools with clear experimental usage context.
    The microscope could be considered but is more of an instrument than a research reagent.
    New patterns should be implemented to catch similar tools in future NF research publications.
    No observations were extracted as no tools were initially validated.
