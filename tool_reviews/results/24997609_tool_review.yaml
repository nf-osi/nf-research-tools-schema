  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on this being a laboratory research study on NF1 and bone mineralization, expected tool types include:
    - Animal models (genetically modified mouse strains)
    - Antibodies (for Western blotting and immunodetection)
    - Cell lines and primary cell cultures (BMSCs, chondrocytes)
    - Genetic reagents (adenoviruses, recombinant proteins)
    - Computational tools (analysis software, statistical packages)
    
    This publication spans multiple experimental approaches including mouse genetics, cell culture, 
    molecular biology, histology, imaging, and biomechanical testing, requiring diverse tool categories.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study that extensively uses research tools across multiple categories.
    The study investigates NF1-related bone defects using genetically modified mouse models, primary cell cultures,
    molecular biology techniques, and specialized analytical equipment. The presence of a detailed Methods section
    with specific protocols, vendor information, and catalog numbers confirms extensive tool usage. This type of
    translational research study would be expected to contain numerous validated research tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Complete mining failure - zero tools detected despite extensive tool usage
    - This is a comprehensive laboratory research study with detailed Methods section
    - Contains multiple categories of research tools: animal models, antibodies, genetic reagents, computational tools
    - All tools have proper experimental context, vendor information, and catalog numbers
    - Mining patterns completely failed to detect standard research tool nomenclature
  recommendations: |
    - ALL 16 identified tools should be added to the database
    - This represents a complete mining system failure for a tool-rich publication
    - Implement the 8 suggested patterns to catch similar tools in future mining
    - Review mining algorithms for basic pattern recognition of:
      * Mouse strain nomenclature (knockout, conditional, Cre lines)
      * Antibodies with vendor/catalog information
      * Adenoviral vectors and recombinant proteins
      * Commercial assay kits with catalog numbers
      * Statistical and analysis software with versions
    - This publication demonstrates the need for comprehensive pattern coverage across all tool categories
    - The extracted observations show meaningful scientific findings that should be captured for validated tools
