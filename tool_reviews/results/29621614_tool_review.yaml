  expectedToolTypes: |
    Review articles typically do not contain research tools as they summarize and synthesize 
    existing literature rather than conducting original experimental work. The absence of 
    Methods, Results, and Discussion sections confirms this is a narrative review focusing 
    on Ras and Rap1 signaling pathways in cancer. Such publications may cite tools from 
    other studies but do not use tools themselves.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a review article that synthesizes existing knowledge about Ras and Rap1 GTPases 
    in cancer signaling. Review articles do not typically use research tools as they summarize 
    literature rather than conduct experiments. The absence of Methods, Results, and Discussion 
    sections confirms this publication would not contain genuine research tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a review article, not original research
    - No Methods section indicating experimental procedures
    - Only abstract available, no full text sections
    - Content focuses on literature synthesis rather than tool usage
  recommendations: |
    This publication correctly yielded zero tools during mining. Review articles should 
    generally be excluded from tool mining efforts as they cite tools from other studies 
    but do not use tools themselves. The mining algorithm correctly identified this as 
    containing no research tools. No changes needed to mining patterns based on this 
    publication. Future mining could potentially filter out review articles earlier 
    in the process to improve efficiency.
