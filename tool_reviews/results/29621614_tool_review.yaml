  hasMethodsSection: No
  likelyContainsTools: No
  expectedToolTypes: |
    Review Article → Typically does not contain research tools as it synthesizes existing literature
    rather than reporting original experimental work. May cite tools from other studies but does
    not use them directly. The absence of Methods, Results, and Discussion sections confirms
    this is a literature review rather than an experimental study.

    Expected tool types for this publication type: None (review articles cite but don't use tools)
    
    However, comprehensive scanning should still be performed for:
    - Cell lines mentioned in experimental context (e.g., MEFs, T24/EJ bladder cells)
    - Animal models referenced from other studies
    - Any computational tools used for analysis or figure generation
    - Clinical assessment tools if reviewing clinical studies
  overallAssessment: |
    This is clearly a review article that synthesizes existing literature on Ras and Rap1 GTPases
    in cancer biology. Review articles typically do not use research tools directly but instead
    cite and discuss tools from other published studies. The absence of Methods, Results, and
    Discussion sections confirms this is not an experimental study. While the publication mentions
    various cell lines, animal models, and experimental approaches, these are cited from other
    work rather than used in original experiments by the authors.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a review article, not an experimental study
    - No Methods section indicating this is literature synthesis rather than original research
    - All tool mentions are citations from other studies, not direct experimental usage
    - Missing Results and Discussion sections typical of experimental papers
    - Tool mining algorithms should be adjusted to recognize review articles and lower expectations
  recommendations: |
    This publication should have zero research tools as it is a review article that synthesizes
    existing literature rather than reporting original experimental work. The mining results
    correctly identified zero tools. The potentially missed tools (MEFs, T24/EJ cells, 3D models)
    are all citations from other studies rather than tools used by the authors.
    
    Recommendations:
    - No tools should be added to the database from this publication
    - Mining algorithms should include publication type detection to identify reviews early
    - Context analysis should distinguish between tool usage and literature citations
    - Patterns should be added to recognize review article language and historical citations
    - This serves as a good negative control case for tool mining validation
