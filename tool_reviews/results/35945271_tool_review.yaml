  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study investigating ataluren treatment in NF1 patient fibroblasts.
    Expected tool types include:
    - Cell lines (patient-derived fibroblasts, HEK293, Schwann cell lines)
    - Antibodies (multiple primary antibodies for Western blot)
    - Genetic reagents (siRNAs, plasmids, vectors)
    - Computational tools (ImageJ, Python, R packages, bioinformatics tools)
    - Animal models (Nf1 mouse models from Jackson Laboratory)
    
    The publication has extensive Methods section with detailed experimental procedures indicating
    active use of multiple research tool categories.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication is a comprehensive laboratory research study with extensive experimental methods
    that should contain numerous research tools across multiple categories. The complete absence of
    mined tools represents a significant mining failure, as the Methods section clearly describes
    usage of cell lines, antibodies, genetic reagents, computational tools, and animal models.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Complete mining failure - zero tools extracted from comprehensive lab research paper
    - Publication contains extensive experimental methods with clear usage of multiple tool categories
    - Methods section describes cell lines, antibodies, genetic reagents, computational tools, and animal models
    - All major tool categories are represented but none were captured by mining algorithms
    - This represents a systematic failure of the mining patterns to recognize standard research tools
  recommendations: |
    - URGENT: Complete overhaul of mining patterns needed - this is a comprehensive lab study with zero tools captured
    - All 20 identified tools should be added to improve mining coverage
    - Implement suggested patterns for antibodies with vendor information, specialized cell line nomenclature, 
      complex mouse strain names, siRNA naming conventions, and software usage contexts
    - This paper demonstrates major gaps in current mining capabilities for standard research tools
    - Consider this a high-priority case for pattern development and validation
    - The observations extracted show meaningful scientific findings that should be captured for validated tools
    - Mining system needs better recognition of vendor information, specialized nomenclature, and context phrases
