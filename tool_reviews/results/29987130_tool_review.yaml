  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a clinical case report with histopathological analysis. Expected tool types:
    - Antibodies (for immunohistochemistry staining)
    - Potentially clinical assessment tools (though none apparent in this case)
    - Computational tools are unlikely given the descriptive nature
    
    Case reports often use diagnostic tools like antibodies for tissue characterization
    but may not have formal Methods sections describing protocols.
  overallAssessment: |
    This case report describes a rare Pacinian neurofibroma associated with NF1. While it lacks a formal Methods section,
    it clearly describes immunohistochemical analysis using antibodies, which are legitimate research tools.
    Case reports typically contain fewer tools than experimental studies but may use diagnostic reagents for tissue characterization.

    details: |
      S-100 antibodies showed positive immunoreactivity in tumor cells of the Pacinian neurofibroma.
      This staining pattern was used for diagnostic confirmation and differential diagnosis from other
      neural tumors including ancient schwannoma and peripheral nerve sheath myxoma.
    foundIn: "discussion"
    contextSnippet: "Immunohistochemistry showed tumor cells with positive immunoreactivity for S-100 antibodies. Differential diagnoses included pacinian hypertrophy, pacinian hyperplasia, and NF."

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Mining completely missed S-100 antibodies, which are clearly mentioned as being used for immunohistochemistry
    - The publication is a case report without formal Methods section, but still contains legitimate tool usage
    - Current mining patterns may be too restrictive for clinical case reports that describe tool usage in Discussion sections
  recommendations: |
    - Add the missed S-100 antibodies to the tool database
    - Implement suggested patterns to catch similar antibody mentions in clinical contexts
    - Consider expanding mining to include Discussion sections for case reports, as they often describe diagnostic procedures there
    - The mining patterns should be updated to catch immunohistochemistry-related antibody usage
    - This case demonstrates that clinical publications can contain legitimate research tools even without formal Methods sections
