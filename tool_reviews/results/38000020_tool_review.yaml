  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study investigating drug combinations in MPNST models.
    Expected tool types include:
    - Cell lines (patient-derived NF1-MPNST cell lines, traditional cell lines)
    - Animal models (PDX models, mouse strains for xenografts)
    - Antibodies (for immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry)
    - Genetic reagents (shRNAs, plasmids, viral vectors)
    - Computational tools (RNA-seq analysis software, statistical analysis)
    - Patient-derived models (PDX models explicitly mentioned)
    
    The publication has extensive Methods section with detailed experimental procedures,
    indicating active use of research tools rather than just citations.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication is a comprehensive laboratory research study that extensively uses research tools
    across multiple categories. The detailed Methods section describes cell culture, animal experiments,
    molecular biology techniques, and computational analyses. The fact that no tools were mined suggests
    a significant failure in the mining process, as this paper clearly contains numerous research tools
    that should have been detected.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Complete mining failure - zero tools detected in a comprehensive lab research study
    - Publication contains extensive experimental methods with numerous research tools across all categories
    - Patient-derived cell lines (JH-2-002, JH-2-031, etc.) completely missed
    - Traditional cell lines (ST8814, NF90.8) not detected
    - PDX models explicitly mentioned but not recognized as patient-derived models
    - Major bioinformatics tools (GATK, DESeq2, Trimmomatic) not identified
    - Animal models (NRG mice) not detected despite Jackson Laboratory sourcing
    - Genetic reagents (plasmids with Addgene numbers) missed
  recommendations: |
    This represents a complete failure of the mining system for a publication rich in research tools.
    URGENT ACTIONS NEEDED:
    1. Implement all 8 suggested patterns to catch missed tool types
    2. Add patient-derived cell line naming conventions (institution-patient-sample format)
    3. Improve PDX model recognition when explicitly listed as "PDXs [model names]"
    4. Enhance bioinformatics tool detection with version numbers
    5. Add Addgene catalog number patterns for genetic reagents
    6. Improve mouse strain detection from major suppliers (Jackson Laboratory)
    7. Manual curator review required for this publication due to complete mining failure
    8. All 20 potentially missed tools should be added to the database
    9. The mining patterns need comprehensive overhaul based on this analysis
    10. Quality control measures needed to flag publications with zero tools when Methods sections are present
