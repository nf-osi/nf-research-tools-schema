  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a clinical neuroimaging study examining brain structure-cognition relationships in NF1 patients.
    Expected tool types:
    - Clinical assessment tools: Working memory assessments, cognitive batteries, behavioral rating scales
    - Computational tools: Neuroimaging analysis software, statistical packages
    - Potentially advanced cellular models: None expected for this type of study
    - Lab research tools: None expected for this neuroimaging study
    
    The study uses detailed cognitive assessments and neuroimaging analysis, so clinical assessment tools
    and computational tools are highly expected.
  overallAssessment: |
    This clinical neuroimaging study would typically contain clinical assessment tools (cognitive tests, 
    behavioral rating scales) and computational tools (neuroimaging analysis software). The study design
    involves detailed cognitive assessments of working memory and brain imaging analysis, making these
    tool types highly expected. No lab-based research tools would be expected for this type of study.

      The n-back task was programmed in-house using E-Prime software. Participants completed verbal and 
      visuospatial tasks at 4 levels of complexity (0-back, 1-back, 2-back, and 3-back tasks). For verbal 
      tasks, random letters were presented and participants responded when the letter matched 1, 2, or 3 
      letters before. For visuospatial tasks, blue squares were presented on a 2×2 grid and participants 
      responded when position matched 1, 2, or 3 positions before. All stimuli presented for 500ms with 
      1,500ms interstimulus interval. Accuracy calculated as proportion of correctly identified hits + 
      correct omissions within each block.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were mined from this publication despite containing multiple clinical assessment tools and computational tools
    - The mining system appears to lack comprehensive patterns for clinical assessment tools (cognitive tests, rating scales)
    - Neuroimaging analysis software and statistical packages were not detected
    - This represents a significant gap in tool detection for clinical neuroimaging studies
  recommendations: |
    This publication should have 12 tools added to the database:
    - 5 clinical assessment tools (n-back task, Corsi block task, WISC-IV, Vineland Scale, Conners scale)
    - 7 computational tools (E-Prime, PEBL, SPM12, MATLAB, DARTEL, MRIcroGL, marsbar)
    
    The mining system needs significant improvement for clinical assessment tools and neuroimaging software.
    New patterns should be added for:
    - Cognitive assessment tasks and neuropsychological tests
    - Parent/clinician rating scales and behavioral measures  
    - Neuroimaging analysis software and statistical packages
    - Software with version numbers and institutional affiliations
    
    This publication demonstrates that clinical studies contain substantial numbers of research tools that
    are currently being missed by the mining system. The 5 observations extracted show these tools have
    scientific value and usage details that should be captured.
