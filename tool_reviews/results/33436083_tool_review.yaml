    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a molecular biology/epigenomics study with extensive computational analysis and protein validation.
    Expected tools include computational analysis software, methylation arrays, antibodies for Western blotting,
    and potentially cell lines or tissue samples. The study involves both bioinformatics analysis and
    experimental validation work.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive lab research study combining epigenomic profiling with computational analysis
    and protein validation. The study uses methylation arrays, RNA-seq analysis, and Western blotting,
    indicating multiple research tool categories. Clinical samples are analyzed using laboratory methods
    rather than clinical assessment tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining failed to capture any tools despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple categories of tools were missed: antibodies with catalog numbers, computational tools with versions, and commercial reagents
    - The study contains extensive Methods section with detailed protocols indicating significant tool usage
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The study uses multiple antibodies for Western blotting, several R packages for bioinformatics analysis,
    commercial kits for sample preparation, and array platforms for data generation. All 13 potentially
    missed tools should be added as they represent genuine research tools with clear experimental usage.
    The suggested patterns would significantly improve future mining of similar epigenomics studies.
    No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated, but this study would likely
    contain valuable observations about differential signaling pathways and methylation patterns.
