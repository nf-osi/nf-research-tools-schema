      BLI provides a noninvasive method for longitudinal tumor monitoring with lower cost 
      and labor demands compared to traditional imaging (MRI, CT). Signal threshold of 
      100,000 photons/s effectively distinguishes engrafted from non-engrafted mice at 
      21 weeks post-injection. Method suitable for studies involving large numbers of mice.
    foundIn: "both"

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Complete failure to detect any research tools despite clear laboratory research study
    - NOD/SCID mice (standard immunodeficient strain) not recognized
    - Patient-derived xenograft model establishment not captured
    - Genetic reagents (lentiviral vectors) not detected
    - Imaging techniques not classified as computational tools
    - Primary cell culture systems not recognized as patient-derived models
  recommendations: |
    This publication represents a significant mining failure - zero tools were detected in a 
    clear laboratory research study that establishes and characterizes multiple research tools.
    All 6 potentially missed tools should be added to the database:
    
    1. NOD/SCID mice - well-established immunodeficient animal model
    2. Patient-derived xenograft model - novel intracranial schwannoma model
    3. Patient-derived cell cultures - primary tumor cultures
    4. Firefly luciferase lentivirus - genetic reagent for tracking
    5. Bioluminescent imaging system - computational/imaging tool
    6. FISH reagents - molecular analysis tools
    
    The suggested patterns should be implemented to capture similar tools in future mining.
    This study provides excellent examples of patient-derived model development with 
    quantitative characterization data that should be preserved in the database.
