  expectedToolTypes: |
    Review Article → Typically does not contain actual research tools used by the authors.
    Instead, reviews cite and discuss tools used in other studies without direct usage.
    May reference animal models, cell lines, computational tools, and clinical assessment tools
    from the literature, but these are citations rather than experimental usage.
    
    This review focuses on therapeutic strategies and clinical trials for NF1, so it may
    mention clinical assessment tools (diagnostic criteria) and reference animal models
    from other studies, but is unlikely to contain lab research tools used experimentally.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive review article about NF1 therapeutic strategies, not an experimental study.
    Review articles typically cite tools from other publications rather than using tools experimentally.
    While the text mentions animal models and diagnostic criteria, these are references to tools
    developed and used by other researchers, not tools used by the review authors themselves.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a review article, not experimental research
    - No Methods section indicating actual tool usage
    - All tool mentions are citations of work done by other research groups
    - Animal models mentioned in Box 2 are examples from literature, not tools used by authors
    - Diagnostic criteria in Box 1 are standard clinical practice, not research tools
    - No evidence of experimental work or tool development by the review authors
  recommendations: |
    This publication should have zero tools accepted. It is a comprehensive review article that
    cites and discusses tools used in other studies but does not use any research tools experimentally.
    
    Key points:
    - All animal model mentions (Krox20-Cre, Dhh-Cre, P0A-Cre, Plp-Cre, miniswine) are citations
    - Diagnostic criteria are clinical standards, not research assessment tools
    - No Methods section or experimental procedures described
    - Review format focuses on summarizing other researchers' work
    
    The mining algorithm correctly identified this as having no tools. The potentially missed
    tools are all false positives that would be inappropriate to include as they represent
    citations rather than actual tool usage.
    
    For future mining: Consider adding context filters to distinguish between tool usage
    ("we used", "we generated") vs tool citations ("has been developed", "was established")
    in review articles.
