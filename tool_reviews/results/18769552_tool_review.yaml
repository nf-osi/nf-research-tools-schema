    This is a laboratory research study using immunohistochemistry, FISH/CISH, and RT-PCR to analyze EGFR expression
    in MPNST samples. Expected tools include:
    - Antibodies (for immunohistochemistry)
    - Computational tools (for statistical analysis, RT-PCR analysis)
    - Genetic reagents (probes for FISH/CISH)
    - Animal models (mouse models mentioned in discussion)
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a clear laboratory research study with detailed Methods section describing experimental procedures.
    The study uses multiple molecular biology techniques (immunohistochemistry, FISH/CISH, RT-PCR) which require
    specific research tools including antibodies, probes, and analysis software. Tools are definitely expected
    and should have been detected by the mining process.

      EGFR expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in 36 out of 42 (86%) valuable patients with MPNST.
      Percentages were higher in the NF1 subgroup (95% versus 75%; P = .06). EGFR-positive cells were localized
      in "high-grade" areas, defined as areas with high-cellular density and high mitotic index. EGFR-positive
      areas segregate with high-grade features and proliferative index detected by Ki-67 expression.

      Survivin staining was positive in all cases of MPNST and showed diffuse distribution to all tumor areas,

      FISH analysis using LSI EGFR probe showed no amplification of EGFR locus in any of the eight MPNST samples
      tested. The mean number of spots detected was 2.42 (range 2.1 to 3.3). Only one case showed 5-6 spots
      in some tumor cells, but this was due to polysomy of chromosome 7 rather than specific EGFR amplification.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Mining process completely failed to detect any tools despite this being a clear lab research study
    - Multiple antibodies with specific clone names, vendors, and dilutions were not detected
    - FISH/CISH probes with vendor information were missed
    - Laboratory instruments and software were not identified
    - The publication contains extensive experimental methods using multiple research tools
  recommendations: |
    - ALL 11 high-confidence tools should be added to the database (shouldBeAdded: Yes)
    - The 2 mouse models mentioned in discussion need manual curator review (cited from other work)
    - Mining patterns need significant improvement to catch vendor names, clone designations, and technical terms
    - This represents a major failure of the mining system for a straightforward lab research paper
    - Suggested patterns should be implemented to prevent similar misses in future mining
    - Six high-quality scientific observations were extracted showing tool performance and experimental findings
    - The observations include quantitative data and proper ontology mapping
