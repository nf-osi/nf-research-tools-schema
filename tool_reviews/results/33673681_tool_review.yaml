    This is a molecular biology study developing and using minigene assays to characterize NF1 splicing variants.
    Expected tools include: cell lines (HEK293), genetic reagents (minigene constructs, vectors), 
    computational tools (bioinformatics software), and molecular biology reagents.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study with extensive Methods section describing molecular biology techniques.
    The study develops and uses minigene assays to characterize NF1 splicing variants, indicating high likelihood
    of research tool usage including cell lines, vectors, reagents, and computational analysis tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a clear laboratory research study
    - Multiple research tools are clearly present in the Methods section but were missed
    - Cell lines, genetic reagents, and computational tools are extensively used but not detected
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The study uses HEK293 cells, beta-globin vectors, multiple bioinformatics tools, and various
    molecular biology reagents. All 8 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent
    genuine research tools with clear experimental usage context. The mining patterns need
    significant improvement to catch standard molecular biology tools and reagents.
