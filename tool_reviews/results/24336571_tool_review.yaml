    This publication describes the development and application of a genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening system.
    Expected tool types include:
    - Genetic reagents (CRISPR-Cas9 components, guide RNA libraries, lentiviral vectors)
    - Computational tools (GeCKO library, screening analysis pipelines)
    - Cell lines (cancer cells, pluripotent stem cells, melanoma models)
    
    The publication should contain multiple tool types across genetic reagents and computational tools categories,
    with potential cell line usage for the screening experiments.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a methods-heavy laboratory research publication that developed a major screening platform (GeCKO library)
    and applied it across multiple experimental systems. The work clearly involves extensive tool development and usage,
    including genetic reagents (CRISPR components, viral vectors), computational tools (screening libraries, analysis),
    and cell culture systems. The absence of any mined tools suggests significant gaps in the mining patterns rather
    than a lack of tools in the publication.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were mined from this publication despite it being a major methods paper
    - This is a clear case of mining pattern inadequacy rather than absence of tools
    - The publication describes development of GeCKO library, a major screening platform
    - Multiple genetic reagents (CRISPR-Cas9, viral vectors, guide RNAs) are described
    - Only abstract text available - full text would likely contain many more tools
    - Missing patterns for CRISPR-related tools, screening libraries, and viral delivery systems
  recommendations: |
    This publication represents a significant failure of the mining system - zero tools were captured
    from a methods-heavy paper that developed and used multiple research tools. Key recommendations:
    
    1. Add CRISPR-specific patterns (CRISPR-Cas9, Cas9, guide RNA, gRNA, sgRNA)
    2. Add screening library patterns (GeCKO, genome-scale libraries)
    3. Add viral delivery system patterns (lentiviral, retroviral, adenoviral delivery)
    4. Add therapeutic compound patterns when used in research contexts
    5. Prioritize obtaining full text for methods-heavy publications
    6. All 6 potentially missed tools should be added to improve coverage
    7. The 7 suggested patterns would significantly improve CRISPR and screening tool detection
    
    No observations could be extracted due to lack of Results/Discussion sections, but full text
    would likely contain extensive experimental findings about the screening platform performance.
