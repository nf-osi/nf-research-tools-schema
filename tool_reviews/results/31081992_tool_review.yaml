    Clinical Study → clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, scales, outcome measures)
    
    This publication focuses on quality of life assessment in NF1 patients using validated questionnaires.
    The study specifically mentions using PedsQL scales, which are established clinical assessment tools.
    Even without a full Methods section, clinical studies routinely use validated instruments for patient
    assessment, making clinical assessment tools highly expected in this type of research.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a clinical study examining quality of life in pediatric NF1 patients using validated assessment
    instruments. Clinical studies of this type routinely employ standardized questionnaires and scales to
    measure patient-reported outcomes, making clinical assessment tools highly expected. The abstract
    explicitly mentions specific PedsQL scales, which are well-established clinical assessment tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Mining completely missed multiple clinical assessment tools despite clear usage context
    - PedsQL instruments are well-established, validated clinical assessment tools widely used in pediatric research
    - The abstract explicitly describes administration of these tools to 305 patients in a multi-site study
    - Individual subscales within PedsQL modules should be recognized as separate assessment tools
    - Clinical studies without traditional Methods sections can still contain valid tool usage
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains multiple clinical assessment tools that were completely missed by the mining process.
    The PedsQL (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory) instruments mentioned are well-established, validated clinical
    assessment tools widely used in pediatric research. All 8 identified tools should be added to the database:
    
    1. PedsQL NF1 Module (disease-specific quality of life assessment)
    2. PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales (generic quality of life assessment)
    3-8. Individual subscales (Speech, Communication, Worry, Pain, Skin Itch Bother, Skin Sensations)
    
    The mining patterns need significant improvement for clinical assessment tools, particularly:
    - Recognition of PedsQL instruments and modules
    - Detection of individual subscales within validated instruments
    - Better context recognition for clinical tool administration
    - Improved handling of publications with abstract-only content
    
    No observations could be extracted due to lack of Results/Discussion sections, but the tools themselves
    are clearly valid and should be captured for future research use.
