  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a clear laboratory research study
    - Extensive Methods section contains numerous research tools that were missed
    - Multiple categories of tools present: genetic reagents, bacterial strains, computational tools
    - Many tools have vendor information and version numbers indicating commercial availability
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The study uses extensive laboratory methods including protein expression, purification, and multiple analytical techniques.
    Key missed tools include: expression vectors, mutagenesis kits, bacterial strains, chromatography columns, analytical instruments, and specialized software.
    The mining patterns need significant improvement to capture structural biology tools, especially:
    1. Commercial reagent kits with vendor information
    2. Bacterial expression strains
    3. Chromatography columns and purification reagents
    4. Analytical software with version numbers
    5. Structural biology computational tools
    All 20 potentially missed tools should be added to improve coverage of structural biology research.
