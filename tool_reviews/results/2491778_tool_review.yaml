  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on publication type (genetic mapping/linkage analysis from 1989):
    - Genetic reagents: DNA markers, probes, restriction enzymes for linkage analysis
    - Computational tools: Statistical software for multipoint linkage analysis (though likely not explicitly named in 1989)
    
    However, this appears to be a genetic mapping study using chromosomal markers rather than 
    experimental research tools. The "markers" mentioned (D17Z1, EW 207) are chromosomal loci 
    used for linkage analysis, not research reagents that would be purchased or developed.
    
    Given the 1989 timeframe and focus on genetic mapping, this publication is unlikely to 
    contain the types of research tools typically mined (antibodies, cell lines, modern 
    computational tools, etc.).
  overallAssessment: |
    This 1989 genetic mapping study focuses on chromosomal localization of the NF1 gene using 
    linkage analysis. While it mentions DNA markers, these appear to be chromosomal loci rather 
    than research tools. The lack of a Methods section and the purely genetic mapping approach 
    suggest minimal use of experimental research tools. The study predates many modern molecular 
    biology tools and focuses on statistical genetic analysis rather than experimental manipulation.

    whyMissed: "Similar to D17Z1, this appears to be a chromosomal marker/locus used for genetic mapping rather than a research tool. The naming convention suggests it may be a DNA probe or RFLP marker, but without Methods section, cannot confirm if this represents a purchasable reagent."

suggestedPatterns:

    pattern: "chromosomal loci|genetic loci|RFLP marker|DNA probe"
    toolType: "genetic_reagent"
    examples: ["D17Z1", "EW 207"]
    reasoning: "These context phrases could help distinguish between chromosomal locations (not tools) and actual DNA probes/markers (potential tools). However, careful manual review would be needed as many genetic mapping studies reference loci rather than reagents."
    
  - patternType: "naming_convention"
    pattern: "^[A-Z]+\\s*\\d+$"
    toolType: "genetic_reagent"
    examples: ["EW 207"]
    reasoning: "This pattern might catch DNA probe/marker naming conventions from older genetic mapping studies, but would need careful validation to distinguish from chromosomal loci designations."

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication from 1989 predates many modern research tools typically mined
    - Only abstract available - no Methods section to confirm experimental procedures
    - Focus on genetic mapping/linkage analysis rather than experimental tool usage
    - Mentioned "markers" (D17Z1, EW 207) appear to be chromosomal loci rather than research reagents
    - Statistical analysis methods mentioned but no specific software tools named
  recommendations: |
    This publication should likely be excluded from tool mining efforts because:
    1. It's a 1989 genetic mapping study that predates most modern research tools
    2. The "markers" mentioned are chromosomal loci used for genetic mapping, not research reagents
    3. No Methods section available to confirm any experimental tool usage
    4. The focus is on statistical genetic analysis rather than experimental manipulation
    
    The mining algorithm correctly identified zero tools. The potential markers (D17Z1, EW 207) 
    would require expert genetic mapping knowledge to determine if they represent actual DNA 
    probes/reagents or just chromosomal landmarks. Given the 1989 timeframe and genetic mapping 
    context, they are likely the latter.
    
    For future mining: Consider excluding very old publications (pre-1990s) or publications 
    focused purely on genetic mapping/linkage analysis unless they explicitly mention 
    experimental procedures or reagent usage.
