    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a mouse genetics study investigating hematopoietic disease, so we expect:
    - Animal models (mouse strains with genetic modifications)
    - Genetic reagents (knockout/conditional alleles)
    - Computational tools (flow cytometry analysis software)
    - Antibodies (for flow cytometry)
    - Potentially cell lines (though focus appears to be primary cells)
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study using genetically modified mouse models to investigate the role of p19ARF in NF1-associated hematopoietic disease. The extensive Methods section describes mouse breeding, bone marrow transplantation, flow cytometry, and molecular analysis techniques. This type of study typically uses multiple research tools including mouse strains, antibodies, reagents, and analysis software.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a clear laboratory research study with extensive Methods section
    - Multiple mouse strains, antibodies, and analysis instruments are described in detail but were not captured
    - The mining appears to have completely missed standard laboratory research tools in a genetics study
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous legitimate research tools that were completely missed by the initial mining:
    - Multiple genetically modified mouse strains (Mx1-Cre, Nf1flox, Nf1fcr, p19 knockout)
    - Standard inbred mouse strains (C57BL/6J, 129/Sv)
    - Flow cytometry antibodies (anti-CD16/CD32)
    - Analysis software and instruments (CellQuest Pro, FACS Calibur, HemaVet Mascot)
    The suggested patterns should help capture similar tools in future mining. All identified tools except Prism 4.0 should be added as they represent legitimate research tools used in this study. Prism is generic statistical software and should not be added.
