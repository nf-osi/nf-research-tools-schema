  publicationTypeConfidence: 1.0
  hasMethodsSection: Yes
  likelyContainsTools: Yes
  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study that should contain multiple tool types:
    - Animal models: Multiple mouse strains and genetic lines are described
    - Antibodies: Extensive immunohistochemistry with numerous primary antibodies
    - Genetic reagents: Cre-lox system, fluorescent reporters, knockout alleles
    - Computational tools: Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis pipeline with multiple software packages
    - Cell lines: Not explicitly mentioned but tissue culture methods suggest possible use
    
    The publication combines mouse genetics, histology, single-cell genomics, and imaging - all requiring specialized research tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a high-quality laboratory research study investigating neurofibromatosis mechanisms using sophisticated experimental approaches.
    The detailed Methods section describes extensive use of genetically modified mouse models, immunohistochemistry protocols, and 
    single-cell RNA sequencing analysis. The complete absence of mined tools represents a major mining failure, as this publication
    contains numerous research tools across multiple categories that should have been detected.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Complete mining failure - zero tools detected despite extensive tool usage
    - Publication contains 18+ antibodies with catalog numbers that should have been detected
    - Multiple genetic reagents (Cre lines, reporters, knockouts) completely missed
    - Computational analysis pipeline with 8+ software tools not detected
    - Standard mouse strains not identified
    - This represents a systematic failure of all tool detection patterns
  recommendations: |
    - URGENT: Review and fix all mining patterns - this publication should have yielded 25+ tools
    - Implement antibody detection for format: "anti-TARGET (dilution; Vendor #catalog)"
    - Add genetic reagent patterns for Cre-lox system components
    - Improve computational tool detection for bioinformatics pipelines
    - Add mouse strain nomenclature patterns
    - This publication is an excellent test case for validating mining improvements
    - All 28 potentially missed tools should be added to improve mining coverage
    - The suggested patterns address the major gaps identified in this analysis
