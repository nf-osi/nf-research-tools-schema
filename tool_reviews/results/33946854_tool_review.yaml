  expectedToolTypes: |
    Review Article → Typically does not contain research tools as they summarize existing literature
    rather than conducting original experiments. May reference tools used in cited studies but
    does not use tools directly. The absence of Methods and Results sections confirms this is
    not experimental research. Review articles may mention:
    - Animal models in general terms when discussing literature
    - Computational tools if reviewing bioinformatics studies
    - But these are citations/references, not actual tool usage
  overallAssessment: |
    This is clearly a review article about hexokinase 2 in cancer, as evidenced by the title
    ("Prima Donna Playing Multiple Characters"), lack of Methods/Results sections, and content
    structure. Review articles typically do not use research tools directly but rather summarize
    findings from other studies that used tools. Any tool mentions would be citations rather
    than experimental usage, making them inappropriate for tool databases.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a review article, not experimental research
    - No Methods section indicating no original experimental work
    - No Results section indicating no original data
    - Generic mention of "mouse models" is citation/reference, not tool usage
    - Title structure ("Prima Donna Playing Multiple Characters") indicates review format
  recommendations: |
    All tool mining should be rejected for this publication because:
    1. This is a review article that summarizes existing literature rather than conducting experiments
    2. The absence of Methods and Results sections confirms no original research was conducted
    3. Any mentions of research tools (like "mouse models") are references to other studies, not direct usage
    4. Review articles should not contribute tools to research tool databases as they don't use tools experimentally
    5. The mining correctly identified zero tools, which is appropriate for this publication type
    6. No additional mining patterns are needed as the system correctly avoided false positives from review content
