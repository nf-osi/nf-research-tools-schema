  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a neuroimaging research study using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to analyze white matter integrity.
    Expected tool types:
    - Computational tools: MRI analysis software (FSL, PROBTRACKX, TBSS), statistical analysis tools
    - Potentially clinical assessment tools: Visual acuity measurements (logMAR)
    
    The study involves sophisticated image processing and statistical analysis, so computational tools are highly expected.
    Clinical assessment tools may be present for measuring visual outcomes.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a quantitative neuroimaging study with extensive computational analysis using DTI data from 93 children.
    The Methods section describes detailed image processing pipelines, statistical modeling, and specialized neuroimaging software.
    Multiple computational tools should be present for MRI data processing, tractography, and statistical analysis.

      FSL version 5.0.7 was used for DTI preprocessing and analysis. The software was used to register b=0 maps to standard space (Montreal Neurologic Institute 152 T1 map with 2mm slice thickness). The inverse transformation matrix was applied to map standard space regions to participant data.

      TBSS was used for voxelwise statistical analysis of FA data in all participants, adjusting for the natural logarithm of age. A nonlinear registration tool aligned all participants' FA data to common space, and a mean FA skeleton was created to represent white matter tract cores. Individual FA data were projected onto this skeleton for cross-subject statistical analysis.

      logMAR visual acuity measurements were used to classify patients into three groups: normal visual acuity (logMAR < 0.2), moderate visual acuity loss (0.2 ≥ logMAR > 0.4), and severe visual acuity loss (logMAR ≥ 0.4). The tool was effective in correlating with DTI measures, with 91% of patients with severe visual acuity loss having RD above the 95% CI for age.
    foundIn: "results"
    contextSnippet: "Of 24 patients with normal visual acuity (logMAR < 0.2 compared to age-based norms), 20 (83.3%) had mean RD of the optic radiations below the upper 95% CI for age"

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were mined from this publication despite clear computational tool usage
    - Multiple neuroimaging software tools (FSL, PROBTRACKX, TBSS) with version numbers were missed
    - Specific MRI scanner models used for data acquisition were not captured
    - Clinical assessment tool (logMAR) for visual acuity measurement was missed
    - The mining system appears to have completely failed to detect any tools in this neuroimaging study
  recommendations: |
    This publication should have yielded multiple computational tools and at least one clinical assessment tool:
    - FSL v5.0.7, PROBTRACKX, and TBSS are standard neuroimaging analysis tools that should be captured
    - Siemens MRI scanner models (Trio, Verio, Skyra, Prisma) are research instruments
    - logMAR is a validated clinical visual acuity assessment tool
    - The complete absence of mined tools suggests systematic issues with the mining patterns
    - Neuroimaging publications require specialized patterns to capture software tools and scanner models
    - Clinical assessment tools like logMAR need better pattern coverage
    - All 8 potentially missed tools should be added to improve mining accuracy
    - The suggested patterns would significantly improve detection of neuroimaging and clinical assessment tools
