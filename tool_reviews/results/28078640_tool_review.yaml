  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on the publication type (Questionnaire/Survey Development), this study would be expected to contain:
    - Clinical assessment tools (the quality of life questionnaire being developed/validated)
    - Possibly computational tools for statistical analysis and validation
    - Potentially other validated questionnaires used for comparison or validation

    This type of study typically develops or validates patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs),
    which are legitimate clinical assessment tools even though they may not involve traditional
    laboratory research methods.
  overallAssessment: |
    This appears to be a questionnaire development and validation study focused on quality of life
    assessment for pediatric NF1 patients. Such studies typically develop clinical assessment tools
    (questionnaires, scales) which are valid research tools. The absence of identified tools suggests
    potential mining gaps for clinical assessment instruments, especially newly developed ones.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication appears to be questionnaire development study but no clinical assessment tools were identified
    - This suggests significant gaps in mining patterns for clinical assessment instruments
    - Newly developed tools may not match existing pattern libraries focused on established instruments
    - Quality of life assessment tools are legitimate research instruments but may be under-represented in mining
  recommendations: |
    This publication likely contains clinical assessment tools that were missed during mining:
    1. The primary tool would be the newly developed NF1 quality of life questionnaire
    2. Validation studies typically use established instruments for comparison (e.g., PedsQL, SF-36)
    3. Statistical software used for psychometric validation should be captured
    4. Mining patterns need enhancement for clinical assessment tool development studies
    5. Consider adding patterns for "questionnaire development", "instrument validation", and "PROM" terminology
    6. Manual curator review recommended to identify specific tools mentioned in methods/results sections
