    Clinical Trial → clinical assessment tools (patient-reported outcomes, functional measures), 
    computational tools for imaging analysis (volumetric MRI analysis mentioned).
    
    This is a phase II clinical trial with clinical trial registration NCT01362803. Such studies
    typically use validated clinical assessment tools to measure patient outcomes, functional
    status, and treatment response. The mention of "volumetric magnetic resonance imaging analysis"
    suggests computational tools for image processing and volume measurement.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a phase II clinical trial evaluating selumetinib treatment in children with NF1.
    Clinical trials routinely use validated assessment tools including patient-reported outcome
    measures (PROs), functional assessments, and imaging analysis software. The study mentions
    "patient-reported (PRO), observer-reported, and functional outcome measures" which are
    legitimate clinical assessment tools that should have been captured by mining algorithms.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were mined from this clinical trial despite clear evidence of clinical assessment tool usage
    - Generic terms used for assessment tools (PRO, functional measures) without specific instrument names
    - Computational tools for volumetric imaging analysis mentioned but not captured
    - Pain assessment methods referenced but specific scales not identified
    - Mining patterns may be too restrictive for clinical trial terminology
  recommendations: |
    This publication represents a significant gap in clinical assessment tool mining. The study clearly
    uses patient-reported outcomes, functional assessments, and imaging analysis tools but none were
    captured. Recommendations:
    
    1. Expand patterns to capture generic clinical assessment terms (PRO, functional measures)
    2. Include computational imaging analysis patterns (volumetric analysis)
    3. Add pain assessment detection patterns
    4. Consider that clinical trials often use abbreviated or generic terms for validated instruments
    5. Manual review recommended to identify specific instruments used (may require full text access)
    
    The absence of any mined tools from a clinical trial is concerning and suggests systematic
    under-detection of clinical assessment tools. Future mining should be more sensitive to
    clinical trial terminology and assessment categories.
