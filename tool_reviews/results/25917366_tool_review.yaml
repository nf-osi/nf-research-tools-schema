    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a molecular neuroscience study investigating HCN channels in NF1 using mouse models, 
    electrophysiology, and behavioral testing. Expected tools include animal models (Nf1 mutant mice), 
    computational tools for data analysis, and potentially genetic reagents.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study with extensive Methods section describing animal models, 
    electrophysiology, and behavioral experiments. The study uses multiple Nf1 mouse models and 
    performs detailed molecular and behavioral analyses, making it highly likely to contain research tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple mouse models with specific genetic modifications were not captured
    - Behavioral assessment tools (Morris water maze, rotarod) were missed
    - Pharmacological reagents and analysis software were not recognized
    - Mining patterns appear insufficient for neuroscience research tools
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The study uses multiple Nf1 mouse models, behavioral assessment tools, electrophysiology analysis software,
    and pharmacological compounds. All potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine
    research tools used in the experimental procedures. The suggested patterns would significantly improve
    mining accuracy for neuroscience and mouse genetics studies. Manual curator review is recommended
    to validate the specific mouse strain nomenclature and ensure proper categorization.
