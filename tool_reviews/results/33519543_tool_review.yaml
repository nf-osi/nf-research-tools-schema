  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a clinical study comparing ASD symptom profiles across three RASopathies (NF1, Noonan syndrome, CFC).
    Expected tool types:
    - Clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, scales, diagnostic instruments) - PRIMARY
    - Computational tools (statistical analysis software) - SECONDARY
    
    The study uses standardized, validated clinical assessment instruments to measure autism symptoms,
    intellectual functioning, and ADHD symptoms. These are legitimate research tools used in clinical
    research and should be captured by mining algorithms. The publication has a detailed Methods section
    describing the administration and scoring of multiple assessment tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    This clinical study extensively uses validated clinical assessment tools for autism diagnosis and
    symptom measurement. The Methods section clearly describes the administration of multiple standardized
    instruments including ADOS-2, ADI-R, WASI-II, and Conners scales. These are well-established research
    tools in autism and neurodevelopmental research. The mining algorithm completely missed these tools,
    representing a significant gap in clinical assessment tool detection.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - COMPLETE MINING FAILURE: No tools were captured despite extensive use of validated clinical assessment tools
    - Missing all major clinical assessment tools: ADOS-2, ADI-R, WASI-II, Conners scales
    - Missing statistical software (SPSS) used for data analysis
    - Clinical assessment tool patterns appear to be completely absent from mining algorithm
    - This represents a systematic gap in clinical tool detection capabilities
  recommendations: |
    CRITICAL MINING GAPS IDENTIFIED:
    - All 5 missed tools should be added to the database - they are legitimate, validated research instruments
    - Implement suggested patterns immediately to capture clinical assessment tools in future mining
    - Clinical studies are a major source of research tools but appear to be poorly covered by current mining
    - Consider separate mining strategies for clinical vs. laboratory publications
    - ADOS, ADI-R, Wechsler scales, and Conners scales are gold-standard tools used across thousands of studies
    - The 5 scientific observations extracted demonstrate rich phenotypic data available from clinical tool usage
    - This publication type (clinical phenotyping study) should be prioritized for improved tool detection
