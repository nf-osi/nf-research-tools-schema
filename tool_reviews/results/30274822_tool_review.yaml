  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on publication type (Bioinformatics Analysis):
    - Computational tools (software, databases, statistical packages, web servers) - EXPECTED
    - Lab research tools (antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents) - NOT EXPECTED
    - Advanced cellular models (organoids, PDX) - NOT EXPECTED  
    - Clinical assessment tools - NOT EXPECTED
    
    This is a pure computational study developing a machine learning model for variant pathogenicity prediction.
    The Methods section extensively describes computational tools, databases, and statistical methods.
  overallAssessment: |
    This bioinformatics analysis publication would typically use multiple computational tools including databases,
    statistical software, machine learning frameworks, and web development tools. The Methods section extensively
    describes computational approaches, making computational tools highly expected. No lab bench work or clinical
    assessments are described, making other tool types unlikely.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: No tools were mined from this publication despite extensive computational tool usage
    - Mining system completely failed to detect computational tools in a bioinformatics study
    - At least 17 computational tools are clearly mentioned with proper citations and usage context
    - Tools include databases (LOVD, gnomAD, ExAC), prediction algorithms (SIFT, Polyphen2, CADD), 
      and software packages (SnpEff, H2O R package, shiny framework)
    - This represents a major gap in computational tool detection patterns
  recommendations: |
    - ALL 17 identified computational tools should be added to the mining results
    - Implement the 6 suggested patterns to improve computational tool detection
    - Review mining patterns for bioinformatics publications - current patterns are inadequate
    - Focus on "using [Tool]", "performed using [Tool]", and citation-based patterns
    - Database names followed by "database" should be reliably detected
    - R packages and web frameworks need better pattern coverage
    - This publication demonstrates the need for specialized patterns for computational studies
