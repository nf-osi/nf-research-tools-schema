    This is a radiomics and machine learning study that should contain multiple computational tools
    for image feature extraction, statistical analysis, and machine learning model development.
    The methods mention specific tools like "PyRadiomics package" and "Quantitative Imaging Feature Pipeline".
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a bioinformatics/machine learning study focused on developing radiomics-based classifiers
    to differentiate schwannomas from neurofibromas using MRI imaging data. Such studies typically
    use multiple computational tools for image processing, feature extraction, statistical analysis,
    and machine learning model development. The mining appears to have missed several computational tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    Major issues found during review:
    - No tools were mined from this publication despite clear computational tool usage
    - This is a bioinformatics/machine learning study that uses multiple computational tools
    - PyRadiomics package is explicitly mentioned as being used for feature extraction
    - Multiple machine learning algorithms (SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN) are used
    - Quantitative Imaging Feature Pipeline is mentioned as analysis platform
    - The mining system appears to have completely missed computational tools in this domain
  recommendations: |
    Overall recommendations for this publication:
    - All 6 identified computational tools should be added to the database
    - The mining patterns need significant improvement for computational tools, especially:
      * Machine learning algorithms mentioned with performance metrics
      * Python packages mentioned with "using the X package" phrasing
      * Analysis pipelines and platforms
    - This publication represents a clear case where computational tool mining failed completely
    - The suggested patterns should be implemented to catch similar tools in future mining
    - No observations could be extracted since no tools were validated, but the Results section
      would likely contain performance metrics and comparative analyses if available
    - This highlights the need for better computational tool detection in bioinformatics studies
