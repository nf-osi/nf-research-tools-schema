  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a genetic mapping study from 1989 that used DNA markers for linkage analysis.
    Expected tool types:
    - genetic reagents (DNA markers, probes)
    - computational tools (linkage analysis software, though likely not explicitly named in 1989)
    
    The study used 10 polymorphic DNA markers: HHH202, TH17.19, D17Z1, ERBA1, EW203, 
    EW206, EW207, EW301, CRI-L581, and CRI-L946. These are genetic reagents used for 
    mapping the NF1 gene locus.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a genetic mapping study that conducted linkage analyses using polymorphic DNA markers.
    While it lacks a formal Methods section (common for older publications), it clearly describes
    experimental work using specific genetic reagents (DNA markers) for chromosome mapping.
    The study should contain genetic reagents as research tools, specifically the DNA markers used.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Mining completely missed 10 genetic reagents (DNA markers) explicitly listed as experimental tools
    - No tools were mined despite clear experimental usage context ("markers were used in this study")
    - Genetic marker nomenclature patterns are not captured by current mining algorithms
    - This represents a significant gap in genetic reagent detection for mapping studies
  recommendations: |
    This publication should have 10 genetic reagents added to the database. All 10 DNA markers
    (HHH202, TH17.19, D17Z1, ERBA1, EW203, EW206, EW207, EW301, CRI-L581, CRI-L946) were
    explicitly stated as being "used in this study" for linkage analysis. The mining patterns
    need significant enhancement to capture genetic marker nomenclature, particularly:
    1. Context phrases like "markers were used in this study"
    2. Various DNA marker naming conventions (EW, CRI-L, TH, HHH, D#Z# patterns)
    3. Linkage analysis context phrases
    This is a clear case where experimental tools were completely missed due to inadequate
    pattern coverage for genetic mapping reagents.
