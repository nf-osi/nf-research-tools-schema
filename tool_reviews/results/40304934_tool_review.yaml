    This is a questionnaire/survey development study focused on creating patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs).
    Expected tool types:
    - Clinical assessment tools: The primary focus is developing and validating pain assessment instruments (PAINS-pNF, PII-pNF)
    - Computational tools: Qualitative analysis software (NVivo) for transcript analysis
    - Existing clinical assessment tools: NRS-11 and PII scales used as foundation for new instruments
    
    This publication type typically develops new clinical assessment tools and uses computational tools for data analysis.
    No lab research tools (antibodies, cell lines, animal models) are expected given the qualitative, clinical nature.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication is highly likely to contain research tools, specifically clinical assessment tools and computational analysis software.
    The study develops new patient-reported outcome measures (PAINS-pNF and PII-pNF) and uses existing validated scales (NRS-11, PII).
    Qualitative analysis software (NVivo) is used for transcript coding and thematic analysis. Clinical assessment tools are valid research tools
    even without traditional laboratory methods, as they are validated instruments for measuring patient outcomes in clinical research.

      The NRS-11 (Numeric Rating Scale-11) is a reliable and valid 0-10 pain intensity scale that has been recommended
      for use in clinical trials by consensus groups and pain experts, suitable for individuals ≥8 years. In this study,
      it was used as a foundation for developing the PAINS-pNF, with participants providing feedback about existing
      pain measures during cognitive debriefing sessions.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Complete failure to detect clinical assessment tools: The mining system missed all 7 research tools present in this publication
    - No patterns for clinical assessment tool detection: The system lacks patterns to identify established scales (NRS-11, PII) and newly developed instruments (PAINS-pNF, PII-pNF)
    - Missing computational tool detection: NVivo qualitative analysis software was not captured
    - Inadequate coverage of questionnaire/survey development studies: This publication type is rich in clinical assessment tools but was completely missed
  recommendations: |
    This publication demonstrates a critical gap in the mining system's ability to detect clinical assessment tools.
    All 7 tools identified should be added to the database:
    - 5 clinical assessment tools (NRS-11, Numeric Rating Scale-11, PII, Pain Interference Index, PAINS-pNF, PII-pNF)
    - 1 computational tool (NVivo software)
    
    The suggested patterns should be implemented to improve detection of:
    - Established clinical scales and questionnaires
    - Newly developed patient-reported outcome measures
    - Qualitative analysis software
    - Assessment tool development terminology
    
    This publication type (questionnaire/survey development) should be prioritized for pattern development as it consistently
    produces clinical assessment tools that are valuable research resources. The observations extracted provide important
    usage instructions and validation information for these tools.
