  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Complete failure to detect any research tools despite clear usage of multiple computational and clinical assessment tools
    - Mining patterns appear to miss statistical software, image analysis software, and clinical assessment devices
    - Specialized medical imaging analysis software (ADW 4.2) was not recognized
    - Clinical assessment devices with manufacturer/model information were not captured
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains multiple legitimate research tools that were completely missed by the initial mining:
    
    SHOULD BE ADDED:
    - IBM SPSS 24.0: Statistical analysis software with clear experimental usage
    - ImageJ v1.53: Image analysis software with detailed protocol description
    - ADW 4.2: Specialized DTI analysis software integrated with MRI system
    - Kowa AP7000 Precise Perimeter: Clinical visual field assessment device
    
    MAYBE ADD:
    - Heidelberg Engineering Spectralis OCT: High-precision clinical imaging device used for research
    - Visual Field Testing Protocol: Standardized clinical assessment methodology
    
    The mining patterns need significant improvement to capture:
    1. Statistical software with version numbers
    2. Image analysis software in medical contexts
    3. Clinical assessment devices with manufacturer/model information
    4. Specialized medical imaging analysis software
    5. Standardized clinical assessment protocols
    
    This represents a major gap in tool detection for clinical research publications that combine computational analysis with clinical assessment methods.
