  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a comprehensive lab research study combining genomic analysis, immunohistochemistry, 
    and tissue microarray construction. Expected tool types include:
    - Antibodies (for immunohistochemistry - NF1, phospho-ERK, etc.)
    - Cell lines (glioblastoma neurosphere lines mentioned)
    - Computational tools (R packages, QuPath, statistical analysis software)
    - Genetic reagents (potentially plasmids/constructs for cell line generation)
    
    The study involves extensive experimental procedures including tissue microarray construction,
    immunohistochemical staining, next-generation sequencing analysis, and statistical modeling.
    Multiple research tool categories are expected across both wet lab and computational domains.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication represents a high-quality translational research study that extensively uses 
    research tools across multiple categories. The comprehensive Methods section describes detailed 
    experimental procedures including antibody validation, tissue microarray construction, 
    immunohistochemistry protocols, and computational analysis pipelines. The study clearly 
    involves both wet lab techniques and bioinformatics analysis, making it highly likely to 
    contain numerous research tools that should have been detected by mining algorithms.

      NFC antibody was immunoreactive in one tumor with an NF1 truncating mutation (E2624*) that 
      was distal to the antibody recognition site. This truncation preserves a portion of the NFC 
      antibody epitope and was the most C-terminal truncation present in the cohort. Highlights 
      importance of interpreting IHC in concordance with genomic data.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Mining algorithm completely failed to detect any tools despite this being a 
      comprehensive lab research study with extensive tool usage
    - Multiple antibodies with specific clone names, catalog numbers, and vendor information 
      were not detected (NFC, iNF-07E, D2-40, #9101, MABE1820)
    - Cell lines with institutional naming conventions were missed (JHH-520, GBM1, JHH-0879)
    - Computational tools with version numbers were not captured (QuPath v0.4.3, R v4.3.1)
    - R packages specifically mentioned in analysis context were overlooked
    - Database management tools (REDCap) and web platforms (cBioportal) were not detected
  recommendations: |
    - URGENT: Complete overhaul of mining patterns needed - this represents a total failure 
      of the current mining system for a tool-rich publication
    - Implement all 8 suggested patterns to capture antibodies, cell lines, and computational tools
    - Add vendor-specific patterns for common research suppliers (Sigma-Aldrich, Cell Signaling, etc.)
    - Improve detection of software with version numbers and R package mentions
    - Consider institutional naming conventions for cell lines (institution-number format)
    - Add context-based detection for neurosphere lines and other specialized cell culture systems
    - This publication should be used as a benchmark case for testing improved mining algorithms
    - All 14 potentially missed tools should be added to the database with high confidence
    - The 8 extracted observations provide valuable scientific context for the validated tools
