    Cannot determine expected tool types without publication content.
    
    The input file (36332985_input.json) appears to be empty, preventing analysis of:
    - Publication metadata (title, journal, year, DOI)
    - Abstract text
    - Full text sections (Methods, Introduction, Results, Discussion)
    - List of mined tools with their types and context
    
    Without this information, it's impossible to assess what tool categories would be expected
    or to validate any mined tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    Unable to perform tool validation assessment due to empty input file.
    The file 36332985_input.json exists in the inputs directory but contains no readable content.
    This prevents analysis of publication type, content, and any mined tools that should be validated.

    CRITICAL ISSUE: Input file is empty or corrupted
    - File path: /home/runner/work/nf-research-tools-schema/nf-research-tools-schema/tool_reviews/inputs/36332985_input.json
    - File exists in directory but contains no readable content
    - Cannot perform any tool validation without publication metadata, text, and mined tools list
    - This appears to be a data pipeline issue affecting multiple input files in the directory
  recommendations: |
    IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
    1. Investigate why input file 36332985_input.json is empty
    2. Check data pipeline that generates these input files
    3. Verify that publication 36332985 exists in PubMed and can be retrieved
    4. Re-run tool mining process for this publication once data pipeline is fixed
    5. Consider checking other input files in the directory as they may have similar issues
    
    Once valid input data is available, this tool validation can be re-run to provide:
    - Detailed assessment of publication type and expected tools
    - Validation of each mined tool with confidence scores
    - Identification of potentially missed tools
    - Suggestions for improved mining patterns
    - Extraction of scientific observations from validated tools
