    Clinical Trial → clinical assessment tools (validated questionnaires, scales), computational tools for statistical analysis
    This is a randomized controlled trial comparing two interventions for quality of life in NF patients.
    Expected tools include validated QOL instruments, statistical software for analysis, and potentially
    patient-reported outcome measures. The study design indicates systematic data collection using
    standardized instruments rather than lab-based research tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a randomized clinical trial evaluating mind-body interventions for NF patients, which would
    typically use validated clinical assessment tools for measuring outcomes. The study design involves
    systematic data collection using standardized questionnaires and statistical analysis software.
    Clinical assessment tools are legitimate research instruments even without traditional lab methods.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a clinical trial with clear tool usage
    - Multiple validated clinical assessment instruments are used but not detected
    - Clinical data management platform (REDCap) and statistical software (SAS) are mentioned but missed
    - Mining patterns appear inadequate for clinical assessment tools and intervention programs
  recommendations: |
    All 6 potentially missed tools should be added to the database as they represent legitimate research tools:
    - WHOQOL-BREF and Perceived Stress Scale are validated clinical assessment instruments
    - REDCap is a standard clinical data management platform
    - 3RP-NF and HEP-NF are structured intervention programs developed for research
    - SAS v9.4 is statistical analysis software (though generic, version is specified)
    The suggested patterns would significantly improve detection of clinical assessment tools.
    No observations were extracted as no tools were initially validated, but clinical outcomes
    data would be available once tools are properly identified and validated.
