    Clinical Trial → clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, scales, outcome measures), computational tools for data analysis
    
    This randomized clinical trial evaluates mind-body interventions using validated clinical assessment instruments
    to measure quality of life outcomes. Clinical trials typically use:
    - Clinical assessment tools: Validated questionnaires and scales for measuring patient outcomes
    - Computational tools: Statistical software for data analysis and management platforms for data collection
    
    The study design and methods clearly indicate use of validated assessment instruments and statistical analysis software.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a well-designed randomized clinical trial that would be expected to use multiple research tools.
    Clinical trials require validated assessment instruments to measure outcomes and computational tools for data analysis.
    The mining process appears to have missed several important clinical assessment tools and computational tools that are clearly described in the methods section.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    Major issues found during review:
    - Mining process failed to capture any tools despite this being a clinical trial with clear tool usage
    - Four important research tools were completely missed: WHOQOL-BREF, Perceived Stress Scale, REDCap, and SAS v9.4
    - Clinical assessment tools (validated questionnaires/scales) were not detected despite being primary outcome measures
    - Computational tools for data collection and analysis were not captured
    - The mining patterns appear inadequate for clinical trial publications
  recommendations: |
    Overall recommendations for this publication:
    - All four missed tools should be added to the database as they are clearly validated research tools
    - The WHOQOL-BREF and Perceived Stress Scale are validated clinical assessment instruments widely used in research
    - REDCap and SAS are standard computational tools for research data management and statistical analysis
    - Mining patterns need significant improvement for clinical assessment tools and computational tools
    - Clinical trial publications require different mining strategies than laboratory research papers
    - The suggested patterns should be implemented to improve future mining of similar publications
    - This publication demonstrates a significant gap in the current mining approach for clinical research tools
