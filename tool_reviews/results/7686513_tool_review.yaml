    This is a molecular biology/genomics paper from 1993 describing the development and application of an exon-trapping system.
    Expected tools include genetic reagents (vectors, clones), cell lines for testing, and potentially computational tools for sequence analysis.
    The paper explicitly mentions developing a "newly constructed trapping vector pEXT2" and using "human glioblastoma A172 cell" line.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is clearly a laboratory research publication describing the development of a molecular biology tool (exon-trapping vector).
    The paper should contain multiple research tools including the newly developed vector pEXT2, cell lines (A172), and cosmid clones.
    Despite lacking detailed Methods sections in the available text, the abstract provides clear evidence of tool development and usage.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Mining system completely failed to detect any tools despite clear presence of research tools
    - pEXT2 vector (main subject of paper) was not detected
    - A172 cell line was not detected
    - Cosmid clones were not detected
    - This represents a significant false negative rate for this publication type
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains clear research tools that were completely missed by the mining system:
    1. pEXT2 should be added as a genetic reagent (newly developed trapping vector)
    2. A172 should be added as a cell line (human glioblastoma cell line)
    3. Cosmid clones should be added as genetic reagents
    
    The mining patterns need improvement to catch:
    - Vector naming conventions (pEXT2 pattern)
    - Standard cell line nomenclature (A172 pattern)
    - Molecular biology terminology ("trapping vector", "cosmid clones")
    
    No observations could be extracted due to lack of Results/Discussion sections in available text.
    This case highlights the importance of having comprehensive pattern matching for genetic reagents and cell lines.
