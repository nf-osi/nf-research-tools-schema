    This publication describes functional assays for variant classification, indicating extensive use of:
    - Cell lines for transfection experiments
    - Antibodies for protein detection and immunoprecipitation
    - Genetic reagents (plasmids, constructs) for functional testing
    - Computational tools for splice site prediction
    The methods section details molecular biology techniques requiring multiple tool types.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study focused on functional characterization of NF1 and SPRED1 variants using multiple experimental approaches. The detailed methods section describes cell culture, transfection, immunoprecipitation, and molecular cloning techniques that require extensive use of research tools. Clinical assessment tools are unlikely given the molecular focus, but computational tools, antibodies, cell lines, and genetic reagents are expected and extensively used.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining failed to capture any tools despite this being a methods-heavy laboratory research publication
    - Standard cell line naming conventions (HEK 293T, COS-7) were not detected
    - Multiple antibodies with species prefixes and clone identifiers were missed
    - Bioinformatics software with version numbers was not captured
    - Genetic reagents (constructs, plasmids, affinity beads) were not detected
    - Mining patterns appear insufficient for comprehensive tool detection in molecular biology methods
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains extensive research tools that were completely missed by initial mining. All 12 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine research tools used in experimental procedures. The suggested patterns would significantly improve mining accuracy for similar molecular biology publications. Manual curator review is recommended to validate the extensive tool usage described in the methods section. No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated, but this publication likely contains valuable functional data about NF1 and SPRED1 variants that could be captured after proper tool validation.
