  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on publication type (Clinical Study focusing on medical imaging analysis):
    - Computational tools → Expected for image analysis, statistical analysis, and data visualization
    - Clinical assessment tools → Unlikely, as this study focuses on imaging methodology rather than patient outcomes
    - Lab research tools → Unlikely, as this is an imaging study without laboratory experiments
    
    This is a clinical imaging study evaluating MRI segmentation methods for vestibular schwannomas.
    The study would primarily use computational tools for image processing, segmentation, and statistical analysis.
  overallAssessment: |
    This clinical imaging study would typically use computational tools for image analysis and statistical processing.
    The detailed Methods section describes imaging protocols and computational analysis methods, indicating likely tool usage.
    While classified as "bench" by PubMed query, this is actually a clinical study focusing on imaging methodology.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite clear computational tool usage in Methods section
    - Publication classified as "bench" by query but is actually a clinical imaging study
    - Mining patterns missed commercial software with vendor information (Simpleware)
    - Mining patterns missed statistical software (R) and R packages (ggplot2, tidyverse)
    - All missed tools are computational tools used for image analysis and statistical processing
  recommendations: |
    - Add all 4 identified computational tools to the mining results
    - Implement suggested patterns to catch commercial software with vendor information
    - Improve detection of statistical software and programming packages
    - Consider that single-letter software names (like "R") may need special handling
    - Review classification logic - this clinical imaging study was misclassified as "bench"
    - Focus computational tool mining on Methods sections where analysis procedures are described
    - No observations can be extracted since no tools were initially validated
