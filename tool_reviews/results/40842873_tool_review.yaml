    Clinical Study → clinical assessment tools, computational tools for analysis
    This study focuses on MRI imaging analysis and volumetric measurements, so computational tools
    for image processing and statistical analysis are expected. While it involves NF2-SWN patients,
    the primary focus is on imaging methodology rather than clinical outcomes, so clinical assessment
    tools are less likely but possible.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a clinical imaging study evaluating MRI voxel resolution effects on tumor volumetric analysis
    in NF2-SWN patients. The study uses computational tools for image processing, segmentation, and
    statistical analysis. Clinical assessment tools are not the primary focus but could be present for
    patient characterization or outcome measures.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite clear computational tool usage in methods
    - Simpleware image processing software with vendor information was missed
    - Generic statistical software (R, ggplot2, tidyverse) present but not NF-specific
    - Study focuses on imaging methodology rather than clinical outcomes
  recommendations: |
    Simpleware should be added as it's a specialized image processing tool used for tumor segmentation
    with clear vendor information and specific usage context. The generic R packages should not be
    added as they are ubiquitous statistical tools. The mining patterns should be improved to capture
    commercial software with vendor information. No clinical assessment tools were found as expected
    for this imaging methodology study. No observations were extracted since no tools were validated.
