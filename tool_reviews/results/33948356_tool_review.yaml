  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on the abstract mentioning "MPNST cell lines" and pathway analysis (p53/Sp1/tubulin), 
    this lab research study would be expected to contain:
    - Cell lines (MPNST cell lines mentioned)
    - Potentially antibodies (for pathway protein detection)
    - Potentially computational tools (for data analysis)
    - Potentially genetic reagents (for pathway manipulation)
    
    However, only the abstract is available, which limits tool detection. Full methods 
    section would likely contain specific cell line names, antibodies, and experimental reagents.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is clearly a laboratory research study testing cordycepin's anti-proliferative effects 
    on MPNST cell lines and investigating the p53/Sp1/tubulin pathway. Such studies typically 
    use multiple research tools including specific cell lines, antibodies for protein detection, 
    and various reagents. However, with only the abstract available, specific tool identification 
    is severely limited.

suggestedPatterns:
  - patternType: "context_phrase"
    pattern: "cell lines both"
    toolType: "cell_line"
    examples: ["MPNST cell lines both"]
    reasoning: "The phrase 'cell lines both' suggests experimental testing on multiple cell lines, indicating actual tool usage rather than just citation"
  - patternType: "term"
    pattern: "cordycepin|3'-deoxyadenosine"
    toolType: "genetic_reagent"
    examples: ["Cordycepin or 3'-deoxyadenosine"]
    reasoning: "Specific chemical compounds used as experimental agents should be captured as genetic reagents, especially when described as extracts used for treatment"
  - patternType: "context_phrase"
    pattern: "anti-proliferative effect on .+ cell lines"
    toolType: "cell_line"
    examples: ["anti-proliferative effect on MPNST cell lines"]
    reasoning: "This pattern indicates experimental testing on cell lines, suggesting actual tool usage in proliferation assays"

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Only abstract available - no Methods, Results, or Discussion sections
    - Generic mention of "MPNST cell lines" without specific cell line names
    - Potential chemical reagent (cordycepin) not captured by current mining patterns
    - Limited context prevents detailed tool validation
    - Full text would likely contain specific cell line names, antibodies, and experimental details
  recommendations: |
    This publication appears to be legitimate laboratory research that would contain multiple 
    research tools, but the abstract-only availability severely limits tool detection. The 
    mining patterns should be enhanced to capture:
    1. Generic cell line mentions when in experimental context ("cell lines both")
    2. Chemical compounds used as experimental agents (cordycepin/3'-deoxyadenosine)
    3. Context phrases indicating actual experimental usage vs. citation
    
    For future similar cases, consider flagging publications with experimental language 
    but no specific tools detected for manual review, as they may contain tools not 
    captured by current patterns. The full text of this paper would likely yield 
    multiple validated tools including specific MPNST cell line names and experimental reagents.
