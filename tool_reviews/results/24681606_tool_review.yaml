    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study that should contain multiple tool types:
    - Animal models (genetically engineered mouse models - GEMMs)
    - Cell lines (immortalized Schwann cells and MPNST cell lines)
    - Antibodies (for immunohistochemistry and western blot)
    - Genetic reagents (Cre recombinase systems, floxed alleles)
    - Computational tools (analysis software like ImageJ, Calcusyn)
    
    The publication explicitly describes two genetically engineered mouse models, multiple cell lines,
    antibodies for various assays, and computational analysis tools. This is a classic example of
    bench research that extensively uses research tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication is a comprehensive preclinical laboratory study testing drug combinations in
    genetically engineered mouse models of peripheral nerve sheath tumors. The study includes
    extensive in vitro cell culture work, in vivo animal studies, immunohistochemistry, western
    blotting, and computational analysis. The fact that zero tools were mined indicates major
    gaps in the mining patterns, as this publication contains numerous clear examples of research
    tools across multiple categories.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Zero tools were mined from a publication that contains extensive research tool usage
    - Multiple cell lines (7 different lines) with clear nomenclature were completely missed
    - Two genetically engineered mouse models with detailed descriptions were not detected
    - Multiple antibodies with vendor information and dilutions were not captured
    - Computational tools (Calcusyn, ImageJ) with clear usage context were missed
    - Genetic reagents (Cre lines, floxed alleles) were not detected
    - This represents a complete failure of the mining system for this publication type
  recommendations: |
    ALL POTENTIALLY MISSED TOOLS SHOULD BE ADDED - this publication demonstrates major gaps in mining patterns:
    
    1. IMMEDIATE ADDITIONS NEEDED:
       - All 7 cell lines (iHSC1λ, iHSC2λ, S462, S462-TY, ST8814, T265, STS-26T)
       - Both genetically engineered mouse models (Dhh-Cre; Nf1fl/fl; Ptenfl/fl and Dhh-Cre; Ptenfl/fl; CNPase-hEGFR)
       - All 6 antibodies (S100, Ki67, p-AKT S473, p-4EBP, p-ERK, GAPDH)
       - Both computational tools (Calcusyn software, ImageJ)
       - All genetic reagents (Dhh-Cre, Nf1fl/fl, Ptenfl/fl)
    
    2. PATTERN IMPROVEMENTS CRITICAL:
       - Cell line patterns need major expansion for alphanumeric names, Greek letters, hyphens
       - Mouse model nomenclature patterns for complex genotypes
       - Antibody detection with vendor/dilution context
       - Software usage patterns with "using X software" context
       - Genetic reagent patterns for Cre lines and floxed alleles
    
    3. OBSERVATIONS QUALITY:
       - Extracted 9 high-quality observations with quantitative data
       - Includes survival data, tumor burden measurements, and drug sensitivity profiles
       - Demonstrates clear experimental findings linked to specific tools
    
    This publication should serve as a benchmark for improving mining accuracy in laboratory research studies.
