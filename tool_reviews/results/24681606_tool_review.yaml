    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a comprehensive preclinical study using cell lines, mouse models, and various molecular biology techniques.
    Expected tools include cell lines (MPNST and Schwann cells), genetically engineered mouse models, 
    antibodies for Western blot and IHC, and computational tools for analysis.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study with extensive Methods section describing cell culture, animal models, 
    drug treatments, and molecular analyses. The study uses multiple research tools including cell lines, 
    genetically engineered mouse models, antibodies, and analysis software. Tools are actively used in 
    experiments rather than just cited, making this an excellent candidate for tool extraction.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple cell lines (7), antibodies (6), drugs (2), software tools (2), and mouse models (1) were missed
    - Current mining patterns appear inadequate for capturing MPNST/sarcoma cell line nomenclature
    - Antibody detection patterns miss vendor/dilution format commonly used in methods
    - Drug compounds used as experimental reagents not captured
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    All 18 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine research tools with clear experimental usage.
    The cell lines are well-established MPNST research models, antibodies are used for Western blot and IHC,
    drugs are experimental compounds, and software tools are used for data analysis.
    New patterns should be implemented to capture similar tools in future NF research publications.
    Manual curator review recommended to validate the extensive tool list and ensure proper categorization.
