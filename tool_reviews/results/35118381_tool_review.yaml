    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    
    This publication involves extensive experimental work with:
    - Cell culture (GL261 glioma cell line)
    - Animal models (C57BL6 mice, rabbits with VX2 tumors)
    - Multiple antibodies for immunofluorescence and flow cytometry
    - Bacterial strains (Clostridium novyi-NT)
    - Pharmacological agents (hydroxyurea, cyclophosphamide)
    - Imaging reagents (pimonidazole, luciferase)
    
    Expected to contain multiple tool types across antibodies, cell lines, animal models, and genetic reagents.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study investigating oncolytic bacterial therapy using Clostridium novyi-NT in mouse and rabbit tumor models. The publication contains extensive Methods sections describing cell culture, animal experiments, immunofluorescence staining, and pharmacological interventions. This type of experimental cancer research would typically utilize numerous research tools including cell lines, animal models, antibodies, and reagents. The fact that no tools were initially mined suggests significant gaps in the mining patterns, as this publication clearly contains multiple validated research tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Critical mining failure: This publication contains extensive experimental research with numerous validated tools, yet ZERO tools were initially mined
    - Missing cell line patterns: Standard cancer cell lines (GL261, VX2) not recognized
    - Missing antibody patterns: Multiple antibodies with clone names and targets not caught
    - Missing animal model patterns: Mouse strain nomenclature (C57BL6) not recognized
    - Missing reagent patterns: Pharmacological agents and specialized reagents not identified
    - Missing bacterial strain patterns: Therapeutic bacterial strains not caught
  recommendations: |
    URGENT: This publication demonstrates major gaps in the mining system. All 16 identified tools should be added to the database as they represent validated research tools with clear experimental usage context. The mining patterns need significant expansion to catch:
    1. Standard cancer cell line nomenclature (GL261, VX2, CT26)
    2. Mouse strain names (C57BL6, BALB/c, etc.)
    3. Antibody naming with clone numbers (1A8 anti-Ly6G)
    4. Pharmacological research reagents (hydroxyurea, cyclophosphamide)
    5. Specialized detection reagents (pimonidazole, Hypoxyprobe-1)
    6. Bacterial strains used therapeutically (C. novyi-NT)
    
    The 9 extracted observations provide valuable scientific data about tool performance and usage protocols. This publication serves as an excellent test case for improving mining coverage of laboratory research tools.
