    Review Article → Typically NO research tools expected. Review articles summarize existing knowledge
    and cite tools from other studies but do not use tools experimentally themselves.
    
    This 1972 review discusses neuroblastoma characteristics, spontaneous regression, diagnostic approaches,
    and treatment strategies. It mentions "in vitro studies" and "serum factor" from other research but
    does not describe original experimental work or tool usage.
    
    The publication predates most modern molecular biology tools and focuses on clinical observations
    and treatment approaches rather than experimental methodology.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is clearly a 1972 review article summarizing the state of neuroblastoma research at that time.
    Review articles typically do not use research tools experimentally but rather cite and discuss tools
    from other studies. The absence of Methods, Results, and Discussion sections confirms this is not
    original research. No research tools are expected in this type of publication.

    foundIn: "abstract"
    contextSnippet: "Approximately 90 percent of patients with neuroblastoma excrete abnormally high quantities of various catecholamines, thus providing a useful diagnostic tool"
    whyMissed: "The text mentions catecholamines as a 'diagnostic tool' but this refers to biomarkers/metabolites, not a research tool or clinical assessment instrument"

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a 1972 review article, not original research
    - No Methods section indicating experimental work
    - Only abstract available, no full text sections
    - Content focuses on clinical observations and treatment approaches, not tool usage
    - Predates most modern molecular biology and computational tools
    - "Diagnostic tool" mention refers to biomarkers (catecholamines), not research tools
  recommendations: |
    This publication should not be expected to contain research tools. It is a historical review
    article from 1972 that summarizes clinical knowledge about neuroblastoma without describing
    original experimental work. The mining correctly found no tools.
    
    The mention of catecholamines as a "diagnostic tool" is not a research tool but rather refers
    to biomarkers used for clinical diagnosis. This type of language could potentially create
    false positives in mining, but the current mining approach correctly avoided this.
    
    No action needed - the empty mining result is appropriate for this publication type.
