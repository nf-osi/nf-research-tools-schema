  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on publication type (Bioinformatics Analysis - GWAS study):
    - Computational tools (software, pipelines) → HIGHLY EXPECTED for GWAS analysis
    - Clinical assessment tools → POSSIBLE for phenotype measurement (CALM counting)
    - Lab tools (antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents) → UNLIKELY for pure GWAS
    - Advanced cellular models (organoids) → UNLIKELY for GWAS
    - Patient-derived models (PDX) → UNLIKELY for GWAS

    This is a genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyzing café-au-lait macule counts in NF1 patients.
    Such studies heavily rely on computational tools for genotyping, quality control, association testing,
    meta-analysis, and visualization. The extensive Methods section describes multiple software tools
    that should have been captured by mining.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a computational genomics study (GWAS) that would be expected to use numerous computational
    tools for data analysis. The extensive Methods section describes genotyping platforms, statistical
    software, and bioinformatics tools. The complete absence of mined tools (0 found) suggests significant
    mining failures rather than a true absence of research tools. GWAS studies are tool-intensive and
    should yield multiple computational tool mentions.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - COMPLETE MINING FAILURE: Zero tools found despite this being a computational genomics study
    - Publication is a GWAS analysis that heavily relies on computational tools for data processing
    - Methods section explicitly describes 10+ software tools that should have been captured
    - Mining patterns appear inadequate for bioinformatics/genomics terminology
    - Standard GWAS software (PLINK, EMMAX, METAL, Haploview) completely missed
    - Statistical software (R) and specialized tools (LocusZoom, LiftOver) not caught
    - Commercial platforms (Illumina arrays) not recognized as computational tools
  recommendations: |
    - ALL MINED RESULTS INVALID: No tools were found when 10+ computational tools are clearly present
    - URGENT PATTERN UPDATES NEEDED: Current mining completely fails for bioinformatics studies
    - Add patterns for standard GWAS software names (PLINK, EMMAX, METAL, Haploview, etc.)
    - Include context phrases like "performed with", "analyzed using", "was done using"
    - Recognize software version patterns (Tool v1.2.3, Tool 4.2)
    - Add hyphenated method names (ComPaSS-GWAS, Meta-analysis)
    - Include commercial platform names (Illumina products, vendor/product combinations)
    - Consider single-letter software names (R) in statistical contexts
    - This publication demonstrates major gaps in computational tool mining coverage
    - Manual curator review recommended for all bioinformatics/GWAS publications
    - No observations could be extracted due to absence of validated tools
