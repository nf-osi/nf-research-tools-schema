    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a molecular biology study investigating Merlin/NF2 tumor suppressor mechanisms using cell culture,
    biochemical assays, and animal models. Expected tools include cell lines (Meso-33, FC-1801), antibodies
    for immunofluorescence, recombinant proteins, and nude mice for xenograft studies.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study with extensive experimental methods including cell culture, biochemical
    assays, immunofluorescence, and animal studies. The publication should contain multiple research tools
    including cell lines, antibodies, recombinant proteins, and animal models. The detailed Methods section
    confirms active experimental usage of various research tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a lab research study with extensive experimental methods
    - Multiple cell lines (Meso-33, FC-1801, 293T) and animal models (nude mice) were missed
    - Numerous recombinant proteins and tagged constructs were not detected
    - Commercial reagent kits with vendor information were overlooked
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous research tools that were completely missed by the initial mining.
    The suggested patterns should be implemented to capture cell lines with alphanumeric naming,
    tagged recombinant proteins, and commercial reagent kits. All 11 potentially missed tools
    should be added as they represent genuine research tools used in the experimental procedures.
    The mining patterns need significant improvement to capture the diversity of tools used in
    molecular biology research.
