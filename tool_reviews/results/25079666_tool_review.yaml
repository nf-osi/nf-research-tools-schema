    This is a JoVE (Journal of Visualized Experiments) methods paper describing laboratory protocols
    for primary cell culture. Such publications typically describe:
    - Cell lines (both primary cultures and immortalized lines)
    - Genetic reagents (oncogenes, vectors for transduction)
    - Culture techniques and reagents
    - Potentially antibodies for cell characterization
    
    Note: Even though only the abstract is available, JoVE papers are specifically designed to
    describe detailed laboratory methods and would be expected to contain multiple research tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    This JoVE methods paper describes protocols for culturing primary human vestibular schwannoma cells,
    which strongly indicates the use of research tools including cell lines and genetic reagents.
    The abstract mentions specific tools (HEI193 cell line, HPV oncogenes) that should have been captured.
    Despite lacking full-text sections, this publication type typically contains detailed tool descriptions.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Zero tools were mined from a JoVE methods paper that clearly describes research tools
    - HEI193 cell line was completely missed despite being explicitly mentioned
    - HPV E6/E7 oncogenes were missed despite clear genetic reagent context
    - Only abstract text available, but JoVE papers typically contain detailed methods with many tools
    - Mining patterns appear insufficient for capturing cell lines and genetic reagents in this context
  recommendations: |
    This publication should have captured at least 3-4 research tools based on the abstract alone.
    The HEI193 cell line and HPV E6/E7 oncogenes are clear, well-established research tools that
    should be added to the database. The mining patterns need improvement to capture:
    1. Specific cell line names (HEI193)
    2. Oncogenes used as genetic reagents (HPV E6, E7)
    3. Context phrases indicating cell line immortalization
    4. Primary cell culture systems
    
    No observations could be extracted since only the abstract is available and no tools were
    initially validated. Future mining should prioritize JoVE papers as they are rich sources
    of research tools and methods.
