    model of neurofibromatosis type 2. Expected tool types include:
    - Animal models (zebrafish transgenic lines)
    - Genetic reagents (CRISPR-Cas9 components, plasmids, gRNAs)
    - Antibodies (for immunostaining and western blotting)
    - Computational tools (for image analysis and data processing)
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research publication describing the generation of a conditional zebrafish model 
    for neurofibromatosis type 2 using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. The publication has a comprehensive Methods 
    section detailing experimental procedures including transgenic line generation, immunohistochemistry, 
    western blotting, and imaging. This type of study would typically use multiple research tools including 
    animal models, genetic reagents, antibodies, and computational analysis tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a clear laboratory research publication
    - Multiple zebrafish transgenic lines were not detected (Tg nomenclature)
    - Standard antibodies (anti-pH3, anti-merlin, anti-Sox10) were missed
    - Common computational tools (ImageJ, GraphPad Prism) were not captured
    - CRISPR-related genetic reagents and plasmids were not identified
    - Bioinformatics tools (CHOP-CHOP, CRISPResso2) were not detected
  recommendations: |
    This publication represents a significant mining failure - 13 legitimate research tools were missed.
    The tools span multiple categories: animal models (4), antibodies (3), genetic reagents (2), and 
    computational tools (4). All missed tools should be added to the database as they represent genuine 
    research resources used in experimental procedures.
    
    Key improvements needed:
    1. Add zebrafish transgenic line nomenclature patterns (Tg format)
    2. Improve antibody detection for "anti-X antibody" format
    3. Add plasmid/vector naming patterns (p-prefix)
    4. Include common molecular biology software tools
    5. Add bioinformatics tool names for CRISPR analysis
    
    The observations extracted demonstrate the functional characterization of the zebrafish model,
    showing tumor development and cellular proliferation phenotypes that mirror human NF2 disease.
    This validates the utility of the generated tools for disease modeling research.
