    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a biomaterials and cell biology study developing an in vitro model system for NF1 research.
    Expected tools include: cell lines (NF1 patient-derived Schwann cells), antibodies (for immunofluorescence),
    computational tools (ImageJ for analysis), and potentially genetic reagents or advanced cellular models.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study developing electroconductive biomaterial scaffolds to study NF1 Schwann cell behavior.
    The study involves cell culture, immunofluorescence staining, proliferation assays, and electrical stimulation experiments.
    Multiple research tools are expected including cell lines, antibodies, analysis software, and custom biomaterial systems.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a clear laboratory research study
    - Multiple obvious research tools present in methods section were missed
    - Cell line nomenclature patterns need improvement for patient-derived lines
    - Antibody detection patterns missing vendor context phrases
    - ImageJ software detection needs version-aware patterns
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains multiple legitimate research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The cell lines (ipNF 95.11b, ipn 02.8) are patient-derived Schwann cell lines central to the study.
    Antibodies (s-100b, anti-rabbit IgG) are used for immunofluorescence with clear vendor information.
    ImageJ software is used for quantitative analysis with specific version numbers.
    Mining patterns need significant improvement for cell line nomenclature and antibody context phrases.
    All identified tools should be added to improve coverage of similar NF research publications.
