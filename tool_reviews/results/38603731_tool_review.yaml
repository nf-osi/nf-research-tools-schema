    Lab Research → computational tools (U-Net neural network, spectroscopy analysis software), 
    potentially clinical assessment tools (if patient outcomes measured), and possibly 
    genetic reagents or cell lines if molecular analysis involved cultured samples.
    This study combines spectroscopic analysis with machine learning, so computational 
    tools are highly expected. Clinical assessment tools may be present if patient 
    symptoms or outcomes were evaluated alongside the spectroscopic measurements.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study combining Raman spectroscopy with deep learning 
    for tissue analysis. The study involves ex vivo tissue analysis, computational 
    processing with neural networks, and statistical analysis, making computational 
    tools highly likely. The clinical context (surgical specimens from NF1 patients) 
    suggests possible clinical assessment tools for patient evaluation.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a clear lab research study with computational analysis
    - Multiple computational tools are clearly described in the methods section but were missed
    - The study uses custom-developed analysis methods that should be captured as tools
    - Specific instrument models with vendor information are present but not detected
  recommendations: |
    All 5 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine computational 
    tools used in the research. The U-Net neural network and SERDS method are core to 
    the analysis pipeline. PCA and LDA are statistical methods used for data analysis. 
    The Ventana spectrometer is a key instrument. The suggested patterns would help 
    capture similar computational tools in future mining. No observations were extracted 
    since no tools were initially validated, but once tools are added, the results 
    section should be reviewed for performance metrics and validation findings.
