  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a biomedical research study combining spectroscopy with computational analysis:
    - Computational tools (software, neural networks, analysis pipelines) - HIGHLY EXPECTED
    - Potentially some lab equipment/reagents for sample preparation
    - Clinical assessment tools are unlikely given the technical/analytical focus
    
    The study uses Raman spectroscopy, deep learning (U-Net), and statistical analysis methods,
    indicating multiple computational tools should be present. The experimental design with
    ex vivo tissue analysis suggests lab-based research tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication represents laboratory-based biomedical research combining spectroscopic analysis
    with machine learning for neurofibroma diagnosis. The study clearly describes experimental methods,
    computational analysis pipelines, and technical instrumentation, making it highly likely to contain
    research tools, particularly computational tools and analytical software.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: No tools were mined from this publication despite clear computational tool usage
    - Multiple computational tools are explicitly mentioned and used in the methodology
    - U-Net neural network, SERDS algorithm, PCA, LDA, and cross-validation are all computational tools
    - The mining system appears to have completely missed this category of tools
    - Analytical instrumentation (spectrometer) with vendor details was also missed
  recommendations: |
    - ALL 6 potentially missed tools should be added to the database
    - The mining patterns need significant improvement for computational tools
    - Focus on capturing machine learning methods (U-Net, neural networks)
    - Improve detection of statistical analysis methods (PCA, LDA, cross-validation)
    - Add patterns for analytical instrumentation with vendor information
    - This publication demonstrates a major gap in computational tool mining
    - No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated
    - Future mining should specifically target methods sections for computational workflows
