    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a drug discovery study using cell-based assays and in vivo models. Expected tools include:
    - Cell lines (schwannoma and meningioma systems mentioned)
    - Animal models (in vivo drug testing mentioned)
    - Computational tools (kinome and transcriptome analysis)
    - Potentially genetic reagents (isogenic cell systems)
    The abstract mentions "various model systems" and "isogenic schwannoma and meningioma cell systems"
    indicating significant tool usage.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study focused on drug discovery for NF2, involving both in vitro
    cell-based assays and in vivo animal models. The study clearly uses multiple research tools
    including cell lines, animal models, and computational analysis platforms. The mention of
    "fully characterized isogenic schwannoma and meningioma cell systems" and kinome/transcriptome
    data indicates substantial tool development and usage.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a clear laboratory research study
    - Multiple research tools are mentioned in the abstract including cell lines, small molecule compounds, and computational resources
    - The mining patterns appear to miss important categories like small molecule inhibitors and isogenic cell systems
    - Data repository URLs (Synapse) not captured as computational tools
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains multiple research tools that were completely missed by initial mining:
    - Small molecule inhibitors (GSK2126458, Panobinostat, CUDC-907) used as research reagents
    - Isogenic cell line systems specifically developed for NF2 research
    - Data repository resources (Synapse platform)
    - The mining patterns need significant enhancement to capture pharmaceutical compounds and engineered cell systems
    - All potentially missed tools should be added as they represent legitimate research tools used in this study
    - No observations could be extracted since no tools were validated, but the full text would likely contain rich phenotypic data
