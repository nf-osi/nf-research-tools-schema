    Review Article → Typically does not contain actual research tools used by the authors.
    Instead, reviews discuss tools and models used by others in the field.
    May mention:
    - Animal models (Drosophila strains, genetic lines) - but as citations, not usage
    - Genetic reagents (GAL4/UAS system, promoters) - but as general methodology, not specific tools
    - Computational tools - unlikely in this type of review
    - Clinical assessment tools - not relevant for this basic research review
    
    This review focuses on Drosophila as a model system for brain diseases, discussing
    general methodological approaches rather than specific experimental tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is clearly a review article that discusses Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism
    for studying brain diseases. Review articles typically cite and discuss research tools used
    by others but do not report original experimental work using specific tools. The absence
    of a Methods section and Results section confirms this is not an experimental study.
    While the text mentions general genetic systems (GAL4/UAS) and promoters, these are
    discussed as methodological concepts rather than specific research tools used in experiments.

suggestedPatterns:
  - patternType: "context_phrase"
    pattern: "exclude review articles from tool mining"
    toolType: "general"
    examples: ["This review considers what has been gleaned from", "Taken together, as a wide variety of Drosophila models"]
    reasoning: "Review articles discuss tools used by others but rarely report original tool usage. Mining should focus on experimental papers with Methods sections."
    
  - patternType: "context_phrase"
    pattern: "distinguish between 'available in' vs 'we used'"
    toolType: "genetic_reagent"
    examples: ["are available in Drosophila", "can be used in order to find"]
    reasoning: "Phrases like 'available in' or 'can be used' indicate general methodology discussion rather than specific tool usage by the authors."

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a review article, not an experimental study
    - No Methods section present, indicating no original experimental work
    - No Results section present, confirming this is not reporting new experiments
    - All tool mentions are general methodology discussions or citations of others' work
    - GAL4/UAS system and promoters mentioned as "available" tools, not tools used by authors
  recommendations: |
    This publication should not contribute any research tools to the database because:
    1. It is a review article that discusses methodology rather than reporting experimental work
    2. No Methods or Results sections indicate no original research was conducted
    3. All genetic systems mentioned (GAL4/UAS, promoters) are discussed as general methodology available in the field
    4. No specific experimental usage of any research tools by the authors
    5. Mining algorithms should be updated to exclude review articles or weight them much lower
    6. Context analysis should distinguish between "tools available in the field" vs "tools we used in our experiments"
    
    The mining correctly identified zero tools from this publication. The potentially missed tools
    are actually false positives that should remain excluded because they represent general
    methodology discussion rather than specific experimental tool usage.
