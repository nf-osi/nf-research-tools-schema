      NF1 mice had more robust dopaminergic and behavioral responses to salient visual stimuli,

      neurons in the VTA. These behavioral phenotypes relate to impaired executive function, 
      attention, and spatial learning.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining failed to capture any tools despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple categories of research tools were completely missed including animal models, antibodies, genetic reagents, cell lines, and computational tools
    - The Methods section contains extensive tool information with catalog numbers, RRIDs, and vendor details that should have been captured
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous high-quality research tools that were completely missed by initial mining. 
    The animal model (NF1 knockout mice), genetic reagents (viral vectors, biosensors), antibodies with catalog numbers, 
    and cell lines should all be added to the database. The mining patterns need significant improvement to capture 
    standard neuroscience research tools. Manual curator review is recommended to validate all potentially missed tools. 
    The observations extracted provide valuable phenotypic data for the NF1 mouse model that would benefit the research community.
