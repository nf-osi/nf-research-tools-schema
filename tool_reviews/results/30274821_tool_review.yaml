    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a comprehensive lab research study with in vitro and in vivo experiments, so we expect:
    - Cell lines (schwannoma cell lines mentioned)
    - Antibodies (immunoblotting and immunofluorescence described)
    - Animal models (xenograft studies in nude mice)
    - Genetic reagents (shRNA vectors, plasmids mentioned)
    - Computational tools (for analysis and imaging)
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study investigating schwannoma biology using both in vitro and in vivo approaches. The study includes cell culture experiments, genetic manipulations, drug treatments, immunological assays, and xenograft models. This type of research heavily relies on research tools including cell lines, antibodies, genetic reagents, and animal models. The detailed Methods section confirms extensive tool usage across multiple experimental approaches.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining failed to capture any tools despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple cell lines, antibodies, genetic reagents, and animal models are clearly present
    - Vendor information and catalog numbers are provided but not captured
    - Standard research tool nomenclature not recognized by current patterns
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous research tools that were completely missed by the initial mining:
    - 3 cell lines (HSCs, RT4-D6P2T, HEI-193) with vendor/source information
    - Multiple antibodies with catalog numbers from major vendors
    - Several genetic reagents including shRNA vectors and expression plasmids
    - Animal model (BALB/c nude mice) for xenograft studies
    - Imaging and analysis software tools
    All of these should be added to improve mining coverage. The suggested patterns would help capture similar tools in future publications. No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated, but this publication would likely contain valuable phenotypic and experimental observations once tools are properly captured.
