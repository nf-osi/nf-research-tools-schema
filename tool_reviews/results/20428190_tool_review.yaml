  title: "NF-1Score: a prediction score for internal neurofibromas in neurofibromatosis-1."
  queryType: "bench"  # From PubMed query (hint only)
  publicationType: "Clinical Study"
  publicationTypeConfidence: 0.95
  hasMethodsSection: Yes
  likelyContainsTools: Yes
  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on publication type (Clinical Study):
    - Clinical assessment tools: The study develops a clinical prediction score (NF-1Score) which is itself a clinical assessment tool
    - Computational tools: Statistical analysis requires software (Stata mentioned in methods)
    
    Note: Although queryType is "bench", this is clearly a clinical study developing a prediction score.
    The study involves retrospective analysis of patient data and statistical modeling, not laboratory research.
    Clinical studies commonly use computational tools for statistical analysis and may develop clinical assessment tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    This clinical study develops and validates a prediction score for internal neurofibromas in NF1 patients.
    The study would be expected to contain clinical assessment tools (the NF-1Score itself) and computational tools for statistical analysis.
    The retrospective design with logistic regression modeling indicates use of statistical software, which was confirmed (Stata v17.0 mentioned).

      The NF-1Score is computed by linear combination of four variables: at least two subcutaneous neurofibromas (OR=4.7), 
      age ≤30 years (OR=3.1), absence of cutaneous neurofibromas (OR=2.6), and fewer than six café-au-lait spots (OR=2.0). 
      The score ranges from 0 to 40 (mean 12.8±10.8). Probability of internal neurofibromas is calculated as 
      exp(-2.93+0.11×Score)/exp(1+(-2.93+0.11×Score)). The model showed good discrimination (AUC-ROC 0.75) and calibration 
      in both development and validation datasets.

      The NF-1Score demonstrated adequate discrimination with AUC-ROC of 0.75 in both development (208 patients) and 
      validation (191 patients) datasets. The model showed good calibration with probabilities agreeing well with 
      observed frequencies. Four variables were independently associated with internal neurofibromas and incorporated 
      into the final score. Further work is needed to establish score thresholds for identifying high-risk patients.
    foundIn: "both"
    contextSnippet: "discrimination was adequate (AUC-ROC, 0.75) in both data sets. The presence of internal neurofibromas can be accurately predicted using a simple clinical score. Further work will establish the score threshold that identifies patients at high risk for complications"

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Mining completely missed the primary clinical assessment tool (NF-1Score) that was developed in this study
    - Statistical software (Stata v17.0) with clear version and vendor information was not captured
    - Publication was classified as "bench" query type but is clearly a clinical study
    - No tools were mined despite clear presence of both clinical assessment and computational tools
  recommendations: |
    - Add the NF-1Score as a clinical assessment tool - this is the main contribution of the paper
    - Add Stata v17.0 as a computational tool used for statistical analysis
    - Improve mining patterns to capture clinical prediction scores and risk assessment tools
    - Enhance patterns for statistical software with version numbers
    - Consider reclassifying query type logic to better distinguish clinical vs bench research
    - The observations extracted provide valuable information about the performance and usage of the NF-1Score
