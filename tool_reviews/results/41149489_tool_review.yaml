  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple antibodies with catalog numbers were not detected (CD9, CD81, TOMM20, HSP90, AKT, p-AKT, ERK, p-ERK)
    - Flow cytometry antibodies with fluorophore conjugates were missed (HLA-DR, CD33, CD11b)
    - Analysis software with version numbers were not captured (FlowJo, ImageJ, Cytoscape, STRING)
    - Primary cell cultures were not recognized as research tools
    - Specialized equipment software (ZetaView) was not detected
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous research tools that were completely missed by the initial mining.
    The study uses primary schwannoma cell cultures, multiple Western blot antibodies, flow cytometry antibodies,
    and several analysis software packages. All 16 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent
    genuine research tools with clear experimental usage context. The suggested patterns would significantly
    improve detection of antibodies with vendor/catalog information and analysis software with versions.
    Manual curator review is recommended to validate the extensive tool usage in this comprehensive study.
