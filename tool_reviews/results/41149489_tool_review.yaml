  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: No tools were mined from this publication despite it being a comprehensive laboratory study
    - Mining system completely failed to detect 20+ clear research tools including:
      * 11 specific antibodies with catalog numbers and vendors
      * 6 computational tools with version numbers
      * 3 genetic reagents/assay kits
      * 1 primary cell line
    - All missed tools have clear vendor information, catalog numbers, or version numbers
    - This represents a major failure of the mining algorithm for laboratory research papers
  recommendations: |
    - ALL 20 identified tools should be added to the database - they are clearly legitimate research tools
    - The mining patterns need significant improvement to catch:
      * Antibodies with "anti-" prefix and fluorophore conjugates
      * Software tools with version numbers in parentheses
      * Commercial reagents with vendor and catalog information
      * Primary cell cultures
    - This publication should be completely re-processed with improved patterns
    - The failure to detect any tools from a clear laboratory study indicates systematic issues
    - Suggest manual review of similar publications to identify pattern gaps
    - No observations could be extracted due to missing Results/Discussion sections in input
