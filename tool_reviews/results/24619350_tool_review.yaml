    Clinical Study → clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, scales, patient-reported outcome measures), 
    possibly computational tools for statistical analysis. This is a longitudinal observational study 
    evaluating quality of life outcomes in NF2 patients using validated questionnaires. The study 
    specifically uses the NFTI-QOL (NF2 impact on quality of life) patient questionnaire as the 
    primary outcome measure, along with clinician-rated and genetic severity assessments.
  overallAssessment: |
    This clinical study evaluates quality of life in NF2 patients using validated assessment tools, 
    specifically the NFTI-QOL questionnaire. Clinical studies routinely use assessment tools 
    (questionnaires, scales) as research instruments to measure patient outcomes. The study also 
    uses statistical analysis software (SPSS) for data analysis, representing computational tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a clinical study that clearly uses validated assessment tools
    - The NFTI-QOL questionnaire is a validated clinical assessment tool specifically designed for NF2 patients
    - Clinical severity rating systems (ClinSev, GenSev) are assessment tools used to evaluate disease progression
    - Mining patterns appear to miss clinical assessment tools in favor of lab-based tools
  recommendations: |
    All four potentially missed tools should be added to the database:
    - NFTI-QOL is a validated NF2-specific quality of life questionnaire (high priority)
    - ClinSev and GenSev are clinical assessment scales for disease severity rating
    - SPSS is the statistical software used for analysis (lower priority as it's generic)
    The mining patterns need improvement to capture clinical assessment tools, particularly 
    disease-specific questionnaires and severity rating scales used in clinical studies.
    No observations were extracted as no tools were initially validated.
