    Clinical Study → clinical assessment tools, possibly computational tools for analysis
    
    This longitudinal clinical study evaluating quality of life in NF2 patients would be expected to contain:
    - Clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, scales, outcome measures) - PRIMARY
    - Computational tools for statistical analysis - SECONDARY
    
    The study focuses on validating and applying the NFTI-QOL questionnaire as an outcome measure,
    making clinical assessment tools the primary tool type expected. Statistical software for data
    analysis would also be expected given the quantitative nature of the study.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a longitudinal clinical study evaluating quality of life in 288 NF2 patients using validated
    questionnaires and statistical analysis. Clinical assessment tools are highly expected as the core
    methodology involves administering and validating the NFTI-QOL questionnaire. The study also compares
    with other established QOL instruments and uses statistical software for analysis, making both clinical
    assessment tools and computational tools likely to be present.

      NFTI-QOL demonstrated good internal reliability with Cronbach's alpha score of 0.85 and test-retest reliability r = 0.84. 
      The questionnaire comprises 8 questions with a maximum score of 24 reflecting greatest impact on QOL. 
      It can be completed in a few minutes and covers domains of balance/dizziness, hearing, facial weakness, sight, 
      mobility/walking, role/outlook on life, pain, anxiety, and depression. A five-point change or greater in total 
      NFTI-QOL score was statistically significant for an individual (95% CI).

      NFTI-QOL showed moderate correlation with clinician-rated severity (r = 0.41, p < 0.001; r = 0.46 for all visits) 
      but only weak correlation with genetic severity (r = 0.16, p < 0.05; r = 0.15 for all visits). 
      This suggests NFTI-QOL captures NF2 patient experiences not encompassed by clinical severity rating or genotype. 
      The mean NFTI-QOL score was 8.7 (SD 5.4) for first visits and 9.2 (SD 5.4) for all visits, similar to 
      published norm of 9.4 (5.5).

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Mining completely missed the primary clinical assessment tool (NFTI-QOL) that is the focus of the entire study
    - Statistical software (SPSS) explicitly mentioned for data analysis was not captured
    - Clinical assessment tool patterns appear to need significant improvement for questionnaire/scale detection
    - No tools were mined despite this being a clinical study with clear tool usage
  recommendations: |
    This publication represents a significant mining failure - zero tools were captured despite clear usage of clinical assessment tools and computational software. The NFTI-QOL questionnaire is the primary focus of the entire study and should have been captured with high confidence. SPSS usage for statistical analysis is explicitly stated in methods and should also have been captured.

    Key recommendations:
    1. NFTI-QOL should definitely be added as a clinical assessment tool - it's the main instrument being validated
    2. SPSS should be added as a computational tool - explicitly used for data analysis
    3. SF-36 and EuroQOL are mentioned but appear to be from previous work, not current study usage - manual review needed
    4. Clinical assessment tool patterns need major improvement to capture disease-specific questionnaires
    5. Statistical software detection patterns should be enhanced to catch explicit usage statements
    6. Four high-quality scientific observations were extracted about tool performance and validation
    
    This case highlights the need for better pattern coverage for clinical assessment tools, particularly disease-specific questionnaires that may not follow standard naming conventions.
