      Limitations identified with the MSNN tool in Analyze 12.0:
      - Only single training set can be defined as part of model priors
      - Fixed model implementation limits extension to more advanced approaches
      - Cannot use convolutional neural networks
      - Does not permit selection of alternative activation functions (sigmoid, ELU, ReLU, leaky ReLU, tanh)
      - Cannot control level of connections/recursions across layers
      - Limits broad application for complex imaging studies

      Performance comparison with neural network approach:
      - Manual segmentation using MIM Encore took average of 18 minutes per case

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: No tools were mined from this publication despite clear presence of multiple computational tools
    - Publication contains detailed methods section with specific software names, versions, and vendors
    - Multiple commercial and custom software tools are explicitly mentioned and used
    - This represents a significant failure in the mining algorithm for computational tools
    - All major computational tools used in the study were missed by the mining process
  recommendations: |
    - ALL 4 major computational tools should be added to the database (Analyze 12.0, MIM Encore 6.9.3, eLucidate, Clinical Trials Processor)
    - The mining patterns need significant improvement for computational tools, especially:
      * Software with version numbers and vendor information
      * Context phrases indicating software usage
      * Commercial image analysis software
    - This publication demonstrates excellent examples of computational tool usage with detailed methodology
    - The suggested patterns should be implemented to catch similar tools in future mining
    - 5 high-quality scientific observations were extracted showing detailed usage instructions, limitations, and performance comparisons
