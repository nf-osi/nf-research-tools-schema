  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a clinical intervention study (quasi-experimental design) testing a post-discharge care program
    for brain tumor surgery patients. Expected tool types include:
    - Clinical assessment tools: Validated questionnaires and scales for measuring symptom clusters, 
      post-discharge adaptation, and quality of life (primary outcome measures)
    - Computational tools: Statistical software for data analysis and sample size calculation
    
    Clinical studies typically use validated instruments to measure patient outcomes, which are legitimate
    research tools even though they differ from traditional lab tools. The study design and methods
    clearly indicate use of standardized assessment instruments.
  overallAssessment: |
    This clinical intervention study would be expected to contain multiple research tools, particularly
    clinical assessment tools for measuring patient outcomes. The detailed methods section describes
    validated questionnaires and statistical software, indicating active tool usage rather than just
    citations. The absence of any mined tools suggests significant under-detection of clinical assessment
    tools and computational tools used in this study.

      Significant improvements were observed in all four quality of life domains (physical, social/family,

      significant time effect (F = 62.743, p < 0.001) and group × time interaction (F = 38.996, p < 0.001). 
      The remaining three domains showed significant effects for time, group, and group × time interactions,

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Complete failure to detect clinical assessment tools: No tools were mined despite clear usage of 
      validated clinical instruments (MSAS, PDCDS, FACIT) as primary outcome measures
    - Missing computational tools: Statistical software (SPSS, G*Power) and intervention platform (ZOOM) 
      not detected despite explicit version information and usage context
    - Clinical study tool detection gap: Mining patterns appear optimized for lab research tools but 
      inadequate for clinical assessment instruments commonly used in patient outcome studies
    - Systematic under-detection: All 6 legitimate research tools used in this study were missed, 
      indicating fundamental gaps in clinical tool recognition patterns
  recommendations: |
    - All 6 missed tools should be added to the database as they represent legitimate research tools 
      actively used in this clinical intervention study
    - Implement suggested patterns to improve detection of clinical assessment tools, particularly 
      validated questionnaires and scales with acronyms
    - Add patterns for statistical software with version numbers and context phrases indicating active usage
    - Expand mining to better capture tools used in clinical studies, not just laboratory research
    - The extracted observations provide valuable information about tool performance and usage in 
      clinical settings, demonstrating effectiveness of the intervention program
    - This publication represents a clear case where clinical assessment tools are the primary research 
      instruments and should be systematically captured by mining algorithms
