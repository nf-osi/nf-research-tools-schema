  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on publication type (Review Article about cutaneous neurofibroma management):
    - Clinical assessment tools for symptom evaluation (pain scales, quality of life measures)
    - Possibly computational tools for literature analysis or data synthesis
    - Unlikely to contain lab research tools (antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents)
    - May reference clinical assessment instruments used in cited studies
    
    Note: Review articles typically cite tools from other studies but don't use them experimentally.
    The absence of Methods, Introduction, and Results sections strongly indicates this is not
    an experimental research paper that would develop or use research tools directly.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication appears to be a clinical review or management guideline focused on cutaneous
    neurofibroma treatment approaches. The absence of Methods, Introduction, and Results sections
    indicates it's not an experimental study that would typically use or develop research tools.
    Review articles may reference tools from cited studies but rarely use tools experimentally themselves.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a review article/clinical guideline, not experimental research
    - Missing critical sections (Methods, Introduction, Results) that would contain tool usage
    - No research tools identified in available text (abstract and discussion only)
    - Publication type does not typically use or develop research tools experimentally
  recommendations: |
    This publication should be excluded from research tool mining efforts because:
    1. It's a review article/clinical guideline rather than experimental research
    2. Lacks Methods section indicating no experimental procedures were performed
    3. Missing Introduction and Results sections that would typically contain tool mentions
    4. Focus is on clinical management rather than research methodology
    5. No tools were identified in the available text sections
    
    Recommendation: Remove this publication from the research tools database as it does not
    contain experimental research tools. Future mining should filter out review articles
    and clinical guidelines unless specifically looking for clinical assessment tools that
    are actually used (not just cited) in the publication.
