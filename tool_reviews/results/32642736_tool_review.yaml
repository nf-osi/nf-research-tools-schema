  expectedToolTypes: |
    Review articles typically do not contain research tools as they synthesize existing literature
    rather than report original experimental work. This publication focuses on therapeutic
    management approaches for cutaneous neurofibromas, discussing clinical treatments rather
    than research methodologies. No tool categories are expected:
    - Lab Research tools (antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents) - Not expected
    - Computational tools - Not expected (no data analysis described)
    - Advanced cellular models (organoids, PDX) - Not expected
    - Clinical assessment tools - Not expected (focuses on treatments, not outcome measures)
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a review article discussing current therapeutic approaches and future research
    directions for cutaneous neurofibroma management. Review articles synthesize existing
    literature and do not typically develop or use research tools. The content focuses on
    clinical treatments (surgical removal, laser therapy, drug trials) rather than research
    methodologies, making research tool usage highly unlikely.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a review article, not original research
    - No Methods section present (typical for reviews)
    - Content focuses on therapeutic interventions rather than research tools
    - Mentions of Ketotifen and CO2 laser are therapeutic treatments, not research tools
    - No experimental procedures or tool usage described
  recommendations: |
    This publication correctly yielded zero research tools during mining. Review articles
    typically do not contain research tools as they synthesize existing literature rather
    than report original experimental work. The mining algorithm performed appropriately
    by not identifying therapeutic interventions (Ketotifen drug, CO2 laser therapy) as
    research tools. No tools should be added, and no pattern modifications are needed
    based on this publication. This serves as a good example of appropriate negative
    results from the mining process.
