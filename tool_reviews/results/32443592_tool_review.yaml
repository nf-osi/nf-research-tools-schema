  overallAssessment: |
    This clinical study extensively uses validated assessment tools to characterize pain and neurological function in schwannomatosis patients.
    The study employs multiple standardized questionnaires, neurophysiological testing methods, and imaging techniques.
    Clinical assessment tools are the primary research instruments, supported by computational analysis software and some laboratory reagents.
    The comprehensive methods section indicates substantial tool usage that should have been captured by mining algorithms.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Complete failure of mining algorithm to detect any tools despite extensive tool usage
    - Multiple validated clinical assessment tools (HADS, PainDETECT, SF-36, SCL-90-R, FPI) completely missed
    - Computational analysis software (eQUISTA, Fieldtrip) not captured
    - Laboratory antibody with catalog number not detected
    - Genetic reagents (sequencing kits, MLPA probes) not identified
    - This represents a systematic failure across multiple tool categories
  recommendations: |
    This publication demonstrates a critical gap in the mining algorithm's ability to detect clinical assessment tools and specialized research software.
    All 10 potentially missed tools should be added to the database as they represent genuine research instruments used in this study.
    The suggested patterns should be implemented to improve detection of:
    1. Standardized clinical questionnaires and assessment scales
    2. Specialized analysis software with institutional affiliations
    3. Antibodies with vendor catalog information
    4. Commercial genetic analysis kits and probe sets
    The observations extracted show meaningful scientific findings that validate the utility of these tools in schwannomatosis research.
    This publication highlights the need for expanded pattern coverage in clinical research tool categories.
