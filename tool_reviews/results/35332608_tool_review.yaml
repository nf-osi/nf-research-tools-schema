  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on publication type (Bioinformatics Analysis):
    - Computational tools (software, databases, web applications, pipelines) - HIGHLY EXPECTED
    - Clinical assessment tools (Manchester Criteria for NF2) - POSSIBLE for phenotype classification
    - Lab research tools (antibodies, cell lines, animal models) - UNLIKELY (this is variant classification study)
    
    This is a computational genetics study focused on NF2 missense variant classification using
    multiple databases and in silico prediction tools. The study systematically compiles variants
    from clinical databases and applies computational classification frameworks. Expected tools
    include variant databases, prediction software, and classification guidelines.
  overallAssessment: |
    This bioinformatics study would be expected to contain multiple computational tools for variant
    analysis, database searches, and classification. The detailed Methods section describes systematic
    use of databases (LOVD, ClinVar, HGMD), prediction software (Alamut Visual, SIFT, PolyPhen-2),
    and classification frameworks (ACGS guidelines). Clinical assessment tools like Manchester Criteria
    are also used for phenotype classification.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    Major issues identified during review:
    - NO TOOLS WERE MINED despite this being a computational study with extensive tool usage
    - Mining system completely failed to detect 20+ computational tools explicitly mentioned
    - Multiple databases, software packages, and web applications with URLs were missed
    - Clinical assessment tool (Manchester Criteria) was not detected
    - This represents a significant failure of the mining system for bioinformatics publications
  recommendations: |
    Critical recommendations for this publication:
    - ALL 20 potentially missed tools should be added to the database
    - This publication demonstrates major gaps in computational tool mining patterns
    - The mining system needs significant improvement for bioinformatics/clinical genetics studies
    - Suggested patterns should be implemented to catch software versions, URLs, and database names
    - Clinical criteria and guidelines should be recognized as assessment tools
    - This type of systematic variant classification study is rich in computational tools
    - Future mining should specifically target Methods sections of bioinformatics papers
    - URL patterns and citation contexts are strong indicators of tool usage
