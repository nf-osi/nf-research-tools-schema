    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a structural biology/NMR study focused on protein characterization. Expected tools include:
    - Genetic reagents (plasmids, expression constructs)
    - Computational tools (NMR analysis software, structure prediction)
    - Cell lines (E. coli expression strains)
    The study involves protein expression, purification, and NMR analysis which typically requires multiple research tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a structural biology study using NMR spectroscopy to characterize the Spred1 EVH1 domain. The publication has detailed Methods describing protein expression, purification, and NMR analysis, indicating active laboratory work. Such studies typically use expression systems (E. coli strains, plasmids), purification reagents, and computational analysis tools. Clinical assessment tools are not expected for this type of basic research study.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a clear lab research study with detailed Methods
    - Multiple research tools are clearly present in the Methods section but were missed
    - The mining patterns appear to be insufficient for structural biology/NMR studies
    - Plasmid constructs, bacterial strains, and NMR software are standard tools that should be captured
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains multiple legitimate research tools that were completely missed by the initial mining:
    - The pET-Spred1(EVH1) plasmid construct should definitely be added as a genetic reagent
    - BL21(DE3) Star E. coli strain should be added as a cell line tool
    - NMRPipe, CcpNMR, and TALOS+ software should be added as computational tools
    - The suggested patterns would help capture similar tools in structural biology studies
    - No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated, but the missed tools could have associated observations about protein expression and structure
    - This case highlights the need for better pattern coverage of molecular biology tools
