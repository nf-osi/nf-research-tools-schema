  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a structural biology/NMR spectroscopy study, which typically uses:
    - Computational tools (NMR analysis software, structure prediction tools)
    - Genetic reagents (expression plasmids, bacterial strains for protein production)
    - Potentially antibodies or cell lines (though not evident in this protein structure study)
    
    The publication focuses on protein expression, purification, and NMR analysis, so computational
    tools for data processing and genetic reagents for protein production are highly expected.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a clear laboratory research publication focused on structural biology using NMR spectroscopy.
    The study involves protein expression, purification, and detailed NMR analysis, which requires
    specialized computational tools and genetic reagents. Tools are definitely expected and likely
    present in the detailed Methods section.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were mined from this publication despite it being a clear laboratory research study
    - Multiple computational tools (NMRPipe, CcpNMR, TALOS+) were missed
    - Genetic reagents (expression plasmid, bacterial strain) were missed
    - This represents a significant gap in the mining patterns for structural biology/NMR studies
  recommendations: |
    This publication should have yielded at least 5 research tools but none were captured by the mining process.
    All 5 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine research tools used in the study:
    - 3 computational tools for NMR data processing and analysis
    - 2 genetic reagents for protein expression
    
    The mining patterns need significant improvement for:
    - NMR analysis software (specialized field with unique tool names)
    - Expression vectors with complex nomenclature (pET series)
    - Bacterial strains with parenthetical modifications
    
    No observations were extracted as this is a methods/technical paper focused on NMR assignments
    rather than biological phenotypes or functional studies. The paper provides structural data
    but no phenotypic observations suitable for the observation schema.
