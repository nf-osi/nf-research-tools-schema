    Clinical Trial → clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, functional assessment scales, outcome measures)
    This publication should contain validated clinical assessment instruments used to measure:
    - Quality of life (PedsQL mentioned in abstract)
    - Behavioral assessments (CBCL mentioned in abstract)
    - Functional assessments (6-minute walk test, strength measures)
    - Safety assessments (biochemical tests)
    
    May also contain computational tools for statistical analysis, though these are less commonly mined.
    Lab tools (antibodies, cell lines, etc.) would not be expected in a clinical trial publication.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a legitimate Phase 2a clinical trial that extensively uses validated clinical assessment tools.
    The study employed multiple standardized instruments to measure safety, compliance, and efficacy outcomes.
    Clinical assessment tools are genuine research tools and should be captured by mining algorithms.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Mining algorithm completely missed this publication's clinical assessment tools
    - No tools were mined despite publication containing multiple validated instruments
    - Clinical assessment tools (PedsQL, CBCL, 6MWT, etc.) are legitimate research tools
    - This represents a significant gap in clinical tool detection patterns
  recommendations: |
    This publication demonstrates a major gap in clinical assessment tool mining patterns.
    Multiple validated clinical instruments were used but none were detected:
    
    CRITICAL MISSING TOOLS:
    - PedsQL (Pediatric Quality of Life) - widely used QoL assessment
    - CBCL/6-18 (Child Behavior Checklist) - standard behavioral assessment
    - 6-minute walk test (6MWT) - functional assessment tool
    - Handwriting Speed Test - motor function assessment
    
    PATTERN IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:
    - Add specific clinical assessment tool names (PedsQL, CBCL)
    - Include functional test patterns (6-minute walk test, handwriting speed)
    - Capture assessment context phrases ("assessed by", "measured using")
    - Recognize parent-reported questionnaire indicators
    
    OBSERVATIONS EXTRACTED:
    - Successfully identified functional improvements measured by these tools
    - Quality of life and motor activity observations linked to specific instruments
    - Demonstrates clinical utility and research value of these assessment tools
    
    This publication should have 5-9 clinical assessment tools added to improve mining coverage.
