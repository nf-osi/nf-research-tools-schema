  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a bioinformatics/genomics methodology paper describing NGS panel development and validation.
    Expected tool types:
    - Computational tools (software, pipelines, databases) - PRIMARY FOCUS
    - Genetic reagents (custom bait libraries, sequencing reagents) - SECONDARY
    
    NOT expected:
    - Antibodies, cell lines, animal models (not relevant to NGS panel development)
    - Clinical assessment tools (this is a methods development paper, not clinical study)
    - Advanced cellular models or PDX models (computational study only)
    
    The publication focuses on bioinformatics pipeline development, so computational tools should be abundant.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication describes the development and validation of a custom NGS panel for hereditary cancer testing,
    including a comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline. The study is primarily computational/bioinformatics focused
    and should contain numerous computational tools (software, databases, analysis pipelines). The presence of
    detailed Methods and Results sections with extensive bioinformatics workflows strongly indicates multiple
    research tools should be present, particularly computational tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: No tools were mined from this publication despite it being a comprehensive bioinformatics methodology paper
    - The publication extensively describes computational tools and software used in NGS analysis pipeline
    - At least 12 computational tools were clearly mentioned with usage context but not captured
    - Mining patterns appear to be inadequate for capturing standard bioinformatics tools
    - This represents a significant false negative rate for computational tool detection
  recommendations: |
    - ALL 12 identified computational tools should be added to the database
    - Mining patterns need significant improvement for bioinformatics tools
    - The suggested patterns should be implemented to capture standard genomics software
    - Consider adding patterns for programming languages (R, Python) when used in analysis context
    - Add patterns for commercial software with vendor information
    - This publication demonstrates the need for better computational tool mining coverage
    - No observations were extracted as no tools were initially validated, but the computational tools
      identified could have associated usage instructions and performance metrics from the Results section
