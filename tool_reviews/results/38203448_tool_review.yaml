  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: No tools were mined from this publication despite extensive experimental methods
    - This is a comprehensive laboratory research study with detailed protocols using multiple research tools
    - Mining algorithms completely failed to detect any of the numerous tools present in the methods section
    - Cell lines: 5 different MPNST cell lines and primary Schwann cells mentioned with clear context
    - Antibodies: 10+ antibodies listed with vendor information and experimental usage
    - Computational tools: 8+ software tools used for data analysis with version numbers
    - All tools have clear experimental context and vendor/version information
  recommendations: |
    URGENT: This represents a complete mining failure for a tool-rich publication. Recommendations:
    1. All 24 identified tools should be added to the database - they represent genuine research tools with clear experimental usage
    2. The suggested patterns should be implemented immediately to capture similar tools in future mining
    3. Review mining algorithms for basic pattern recognition failures (cell line names, antibody naming, software with versions)
    4. This publication should be used as a test case for validating improved mining algorithms
    5. Consider manual curation of similar high-impact molecular biology publications to identify systematic mining gaps
    6. No observations were extracted since no tools were initially mined, but this publication likely contains valuable tool performance data
    7. The mining system needs fundamental improvements in recognizing standard laboratory research tool naming conventions
