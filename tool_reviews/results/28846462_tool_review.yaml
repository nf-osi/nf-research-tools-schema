    This publication is clearly laboratory research focused on validating immunohistochemical markers
    (antibodies) for use in NF1 porcine models. The study involves comparative analysis between human
    and pig tissues using multiple specific antibodies. Despite being classified as "bench" research,
    the publication should contain numerous antibody tools used for immunohistochemical analysis.
    Animal models (porcine NF1 models) are also mentioned as the target application.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study focused on validating immunohistochemical markers for NF1 porcine
    models. The publication should contain multiple research tools, primarily antibodies used for
    immunohistochemical analysis. The study compares marker expression between human and pig tissues,
    indicating experimental usage of specific antibodies. Despite lacking a formal Methods section in
    the provided text, the abstract clearly describes experimental validation work that would require
    multiple antibody tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Mining completely failed to identify any tools despite clear experimental context
    - 17 specific immunohistochemical markers (antibodies) were explicitly listed but not captured
    - 1 animal model (NF1 porcine models) mentioned but not captured
    - Mining patterns appear inadequate for immunohistochemical marker identification
    - No full text sections available limited ability to extract detailed observations
  recommendations: |
    - ALL 18 missed tools should be added to the database - they represent genuine research tools
    - Mining patterns need significant improvement for immunohistochemical studies
    - The phrase "immunohistochemical markers" followed by parenthetical lists should be a strong signal
    - CD marker patterns (CD13, CD20, etc.) need to be included
    - Common protein marker names should be recognized as antibody targets
    - Full protein names should be captured alongside their abbreviations
    - Porcine model terminology needs better coverage
    - This represents a major gap in current mining capabilities for antibody-based studies
    - No observations could be extracted due to lack of Results/Discussion sections in provided text
