  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive laboratory research study
    - Multiple specific antibodies with clone numbers and vendors were missed
    - Computational tools with version numbers were not captured
    - Primary cell cultures with specific identifiers were overlooked
    - 3D culture systems representing advanced cellular models were not detected
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous research tools that were completely missed by the initial mining.
    The study uses multiple flow cytometry antibodies, computational analysis software, primary cell cultures,
    and 3D culture systems. All 11 potentially missed tools should be added to improve mining coverage.
    The suggested patterns would help capture similar tools in future NF research publications.
    No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated, but this study likely contains
    valuable phenotypic observations about NF1 patient-derived cells that could be captured once tools are validated.
