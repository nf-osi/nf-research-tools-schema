    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a laboratory research study using mouse models, primary cell cultures, molecular biology techniques,
    and computational analysis tools. Expected tools include animal models (Nf1 conditional knockout mice),
    antibodies (for Western blot), genetic reagents (adenoviral vectors), and computational tools (imaging software).
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study investigating bone healing defects in NF1 using conditional
    knockout mouse models, primary cell culture, molecular biology techniques, and biomechanical testing. The study
    clearly uses multiple research tools including genetically modified mouse strains, antibodies, viral vectors,
    and specialized software for analysis. The detailed Methods section confirms extensive tool usage.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple research tools were missed including conditional knockout mouse models, antibodies, viral vectors, and specialized equipment
    - The mining system failed to capture standard laboratory research tools with clear vendor information
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous legitimate research tools that were completely missed by the initial mining.
    The conditional knockout mouse models, antibodies, viral vectors, and specialized equipment should all be added.
    The suggested patterns would significantly improve detection of similar tools in future NF research publications.
    All potentially missed tools have high confidence scores and clear experimental usage context.
    The observations extracted demonstrate meaningful phenotypic findings related to bone healing defects in NF1.
