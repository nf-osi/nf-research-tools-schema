    Review Article → Typically does not contain research tools used by the authors themselves.
    Review articles synthesize existing literature and may cite tools from other studies, but do not
    typically report original experimental work using antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic
    reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX models, or clinical assessment tools.
    
    However, comprehensive reviews may occasionally mention specific assessment instruments or
    computational tools used for literature analysis, so a careful scan is still warranted.
    
    This particular review focuses on social communication in genetic syndromes, so it might
    reference clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, behavioral scales) from the literature
    it reviews, but would not be using them experimentally.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive review article synthesizing literature on social communication in NF1 and
    Noonan syndrome from 2010-2023. Review articles typically do not contain research tools used by
    the authors, as they synthesize existing research rather than conducting original experiments.
    The absence of Methods, Results, and Discussion sections confirms this is a literature review
    rather than an empirical study. Any tools mentioned would likely be citations from reviewed
    studies rather than tools used by the review authors.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a comprehensive review article, not original research
    - No Methods section indicating experimental procedures
    - Only abstract text available - no full text sections for detailed analysis
    - Review articles typically cite tools from other studies but do not use tools experimentally
    - No tools were mined, which is appropriate for this publication type
  recommendations: |
    This publication is correctly identified as containing no research tools. Review articles
    synthesize existing literature and do not typically conduct original experiments using
    research tools. The mining algorithm correctly identified zero tools, which is the expected
    result for this publication type.
    
    No action needed - the absence of mined tools is appropriate and accurate for this review article.
    Future mining should continue to exclude review articles from tool extraction unless they
    specifically describe methodological tools used for literature analysis (which is rare).
    
    The publication title clearly indicates it is a "Comprehensive Review" which should be a
    strong signal to exclude from tool mining in future iterations.
