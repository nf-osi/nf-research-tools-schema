    Based on this being a qualitative clinical study using semi-structured interviews:
    - Clinical assessment tools: Semi-structured interview guides, qualitative analysis frameworks
    - Computational tools: Qualitative data analysis software (NVivo mentioned in methods)
    - No lab research tools expected (antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, organoids, PDX)
    
    This is a patient experience study using interviews and qualitative analysis, so clinical assessment 
    tools and computational analysis tools are the primary expected categories.
  overallAssessment: |
    This qualitative clinical study examining patient experiences with NF1-associated plexiform neurofibromas 
    would typically use clinical assessment tools (interview guides, questionnaires) and computational tools 
    for qualitative data analysis. The study used semi-structured interviews and conventional content analysis 
    with NVivo software, indicating legitimate research tools were employed despite none being captured in the 
    initial mining.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a legitimate research study
    - Qualitative data analysis software (NVivo) with full version and vendor details was missed
    - Semi-structured interview guide (clinical assessment tool) was not captured
    - Current mining patterns appear inadequate for qualitative research methodologies
  recommendations: |
    This publication represents a significant gap in the current mining approach for qualitative clinical research:
    
    1. **Add NVivo as computational tool**: Clear software with version (1.7.2) and vendor (Lumivero) information
    2. **Add semi-structured interview guide as clinical assessment tool**: This is a legitimate research instrument
    3. **Consider conventional content analysis**: While methodological, it represents a systematic analytical approach
    4. **Improve patterns for qualitative research**: Current mining misses common qualitative research tools
    5. **No lab tools expected**: This is purely clinical/qualitative research, so absence of lab tools is appropriate
    
    The mining system needs better coverage of:
    - Qualitative data analysis software packages
    - Clinical interview instruments and guides
    - Qualitative analysis methodologies
    - Software citations with vendor/version information
