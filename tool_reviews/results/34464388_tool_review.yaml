    Clinical Study → clinical assessment tools (RECIST criteria), computational tools for genomic analysis
    This study uses ultra-low-pass whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics pipelines to analyze cell-free DNA,
    plus clinical imaging assessment tools. Expected tools include computational analysis software, sequencing
    platforms, and clinical assessment criteria.
  overallAssessment: |
    This clinical study combines genomic analysis with clinical assessment, making it likely to contain both
    computational tools (for sequencing analysis) and clinical assessment tools (RECIST criteria for tumor response).
    The methods section describes extensive bioinformatics workflows and clinical evaluation protocols.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a methods-heavy genomic analysis study
    - Multiple computational tools with version numbers were missed (ichorCNA, BWA, fastp, Samtools)
    - Clinical assessment tool (RECIST 1.1) was missed
    - Sequencing platforms (NovaSeq, HiSeq 4000) were not captured
    - Mining patterns appear insufficient for bioinformatics and clinical assessment tools
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous legitimate research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The study uses a comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline with specific versioned tools and clinical assessment criteria.
    All 10 potentially missed tools should be added - they represent genuine research tools with clear usage context.
    Mining patterns need significant enhancement for computational tools and clinical assessment criteria.
    No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated, but this study would likely contain
    performance metrics and usage notes for the computational tools if they were properly captured.
