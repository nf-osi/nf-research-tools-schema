  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a bioinformatics analysis study using computational genomics approaches to analyze cell-free DNA.
    Expected tool types:
    - Computational tools (software, pipelines, analysis packages) - PRIMARY
    - Genetic reagents (DNA extraction kits, library prep kits) - SECONDARY
    
    The study involves sequencing data analysis, copy number analysis, fragment size analysis, and statistical
    analysis, which typically require multiple computational tools and bioinformatics software packages.
    Clinical assessment tools are not expected as this is a molecular diagnostic development study.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication is a computational genomics study developing a liquid biopsy approach for cancer detection.
    It should contain numerous computational tools for sequencing data processing, bioinformatics analysis,
    and statistical analysis. The extensive methods section describes detailed computational workflows that
    would require multiple software tools and analysis packages. The complete absence of mined tools suggests
    significant gaps in the mining patterns for computational tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Zero tools were mined from a computational genomics study that clearly uses numerous software tools
    - Mining patterns appear to completely miss standard bioinformatics tools (fastp, BWA, Samtools, etc.)
    - Commercial reagent kits with vendor information were not captured
    - Statistical software (R, Prism) with versions were not detected
    - Specialized genomics tools (ichorCNA, MosDepth, deepTools) were missed
    - This represents a major gap in computational tool mining capabilities
  recommendations: |
    - ALL 14 identified tools should be added to the mining results
    - Implement the 6 suggested patterns to improve computational tool detection
    - Focus on capturing software tools with version numbers and vendor information
    - Add patterns for "using [TOOL]" and "performed with [TOOL]" contexts
    - This publication demonstrates significant gaps in mining bioinformatics tools
    - No observations were extracted as this is a methods development study without specific tool performance data
    - Future mining should prioritize computational tools in genomics/bioinformatics publications
