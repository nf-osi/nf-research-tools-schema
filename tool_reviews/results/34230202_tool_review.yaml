  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on publication type (Observational Study - Survey):
    - Clinical assessment tools → Potentially, if validated questionnaires were used
    - Computational tools → Unlikely, as this is a descriptive survey analysis
    - Lab research tools → No, this is not laboratory research
    
    This is a patient perspective survey study that collected opinions about cutaneous neurofibromas
    and treatment preferences. Such studies typically do not use research tools in the traditional sense,
    though they might use validated survey instruments or questionnaires if they exist.
    
    The study used an "online survey developed by multidisciplinary experts" but does not specify
    if this was a validated clinical assessment tool or a custom questionnaire.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a patient perspective survey study that assessed attitudes toward cutaneous neurofibroma
    treatments among adults with NF1. Survey/questionnaire studies rarely contain traditional research
    tools unless they use validated clinical assessment instruments. The methodology describes a custom
    survey rather than established validated tools, making research tool identification unlikely.

    whyMissed: "Custom survey instrument mentioned but may not be a validated clinical assessment tool - appears to be study-specific rather than a standardized instrument"

    examples: ["No examples found in this paper - suggestion for future mining"]
    reasoning: "Survey studies may use validated clinical assessment tools, but this study used a custom survey. Adding patterns to detect validated instruments would help distinguish between custom surveys and established clinical assessment tools."

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a patient perspective survey study, not laboratory research
    - No research tools were mined (correctly - none present)
    - Study used a custom survey rather than validated clinical assessment tools
    - Publication type makes research tool usage highly unlikely
  recommendations: |
    - Correctly identified as having no research tools
    - The mining algorithm appropriately found zero tools for this survey study
    - One potential tool (REiNS survey) was considered but rejected as it appears to be a custom
      study-specific instrument rather than a validated clinical assessment tool
    - Suggested adding patterns to better detect validated clinical assessment instruments in future
      survey studies, though this particular study would still yield zero tools
    - No manual curator review needed - the zero-tool result is accurate for this publication type
