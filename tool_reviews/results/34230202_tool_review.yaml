  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a questionnaire/survey development study that created and administered a custom survey instrument.
    Expected tool types:
    - Clinical assessment tools: The survey instrument itself is a clinical assessment tool for measuring
      patient perspectives, treatment preferences, and quality of life impacts related to cutaneous neurofibromas.
    - Possibly computational tools: May have used statistical software for survey data analysis, though not
      explicitly mentioned in the provided text.
    
    Note: This publication type typically does not use lab research tools (antibodies, cell lines, animal models,
    genetic reagents, organoids, PDX models) as it focuses on patient-reported outcomes rather than experimental research.
  overallAssessment: |
    This survey study would be expected to contain clinical assessment tools, specifically the custom survey
    instrument developed by the REiNS cNF Working Group. The survey measures patient perspectives on cutaneous
    neurofibroma burden, treatment preferences, and acceptable risk-benefit ratios - making it a valid clinical
    assessment tool for patient-reported outcomes in NF1 research.

      Survey successfully captured patient perspectives from 548 adults with NF1 regarding cutaneous neurofibroma burden.
      Key findings include: 75% of respondents considered 33-66% reduction in cNF number/size as meaningful treatment response;
      Most respondents (48-58%) willing to try available treatments but unaware of options beyond surgical removal;
      >65% reported being "very much" or "extremely willing" to try experimental treatments;
      Major barriers to clinical trial participation were cost and work time requirements.

      Survey eligibility criteria: self-reported NF1 diagnosis, age ≥18 years, ≥1 cutaneous neurofibroma, 
      and ability to read English. Survey was distributed through the largest international database of 
      individuals with any form of NF (n = 3,734 contacted). Response rate was approximately 15% (548/3,734).

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined from this publication, which is partially correct but missed the survey instrument
    - The custom survey developed by the REiNS cNF Working Group is itself a clinical assessment tool that should have been captured
    - Mining patterns may need improvement to recognize custom survey instruments and questionnaires developed by research groups
  recommendations: |
    This publication represents a missed opportunity to capture a valid clinical assessment tool. The REiNS cNF Working Group Survey
    should be added as it represents a specialized instrument for measuring patient perspectives on cutaneous neurofibromas in NF1.
    
    Key recommendations:
    1. Add the REiNS cNF Working Group Survey as a clinical assessment tool
    2. Improve mining patterns to capture custom survey instruments developed by research working groups
    3. Consider adding patterns for "online survey" and "survey developed by" contexts
    4. The survey instrument has clear clinical utility and should be included in the research tools database
    
    The observations extracted demonstrate the survey's effectiveness in capturing meaningful patient-reported outcomes
    that can guide clinical trial design and treatment development for cutaneous neurofibromas in NF1.
