  title: "PedsQL Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Module for children, adolescents and young adults: feasibility, reliability and validity"
  queryType: "clinical"
  publicationType: "Questionnaire/Survey Development"
  publicationTypeConfidence: 0.95
  hasMethodsSection: Yes
  likelyContainsTools: Yes
  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a questionnaire/survey development study focused on creating and validating the PedsQL 
    Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Module. Expected tool types:
    - Clinical assessment tools (the PedsQL NF1 Module itself - the primary tool being developed)
    - Clinical assessment tools (PedsQL Generic Core Scales used for validation)
    - Computational tools (statistical software for psychometric analysis - likely R, SPSS, or SAS)
    - Potentially other validated questionnaires used for comparison/validation

    Note: This publication type specifically develops clinical assessment tools, so the absence of 
    mined tools indicates critical gaps in mining patterns for questionnaire development terminology,
    patient-reported outcome measures, and clinical assessment instruments.
  overallAssessment: |
    This questionnaire development study should contain multiple clinical assessment tools, with the
    PedsQL NF1 Module being the primary tool under development. The complete absence of any mined
    tools represents a critical failure in the data pipeline - the publication text was never cached
    or processed, preventing any tool mining from occurring. This is a systematic data processing
    issue rather than a mining pattern problem.

    CRITICAL DATA PIPELINE FAILURE for PMID 29273891:
    - Input file exists but is empty (0 bytes)
    - Publication cache file (29273891_text.json) is missing from publication_cache directory
    - This indicates the publication text was never retrieved and cached
    - No tool mining could occur without publication text
    - This is a systematic data processing issue affecting multiple PMIDs (all 29 input files are empty)
    - The problem is upstream in the data pipeline, not with mining patterns
  recommendations: |
    URGENT DATA PIPELINE REPAIR REQUIRED: This is not a mining pattern issue but a fundamental
    data processing failure. The publication text for PMID 29273891 was never retrieved and cached.
    
    IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED:
    1. Investigate why publication cache file (29273891_text.json) is missing
    2. Check publication retrieval process for this PMID
    3. Verify API access and rate limiting issues
    4. Re-run publication text retrieval for PMID 29273891
    5. Investigate systematic failure affecting all 29 input files (all 0 bytes)
    6. Once text is cached, re-run tool mining process
    
    EXPECTED TOOLS AFTER PIPELINE REPAIR:
    - PedsQL Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Module (primary clinical assessment tool)
    - PedsQL Generic Core Scales (validation instrument)
    - Statistical analysis software (psychometric analysis)
    
    This publication should be a high-value case for clinical assessment tool mining once the
    data pipeline is repaired. The suggested patterns above should be implemented to improve
    clinical tool detection for future questionnaire development studies.
    
    NOTE: Cannot perform proper tool validation without publication text. This review is based
    on known publication metadata and expected content for PedsQL instrument development studies.
