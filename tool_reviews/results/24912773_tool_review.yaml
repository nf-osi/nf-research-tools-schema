  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on the publication type (Lab Research) and content analysis, this study should contain:
    - Computational tools (bioinformatics software, structural analysis tools, databases)
    - Potentially genetic reagents (protein constructs, expression vectors)
    - Possibly antibodies (if protein detection/validation was performed)
    
    This is a structural biology/bioinformatics study focusing on CD44 protein variant analysis,
    crystal structure analysis, and computational modeling. The extensive Methods section describes
    multiple computational approaches including sequence alignment tools, structural analysis software,
    and database searches. Such studies typically rely heavily on computational tools and may also
    use molecular biology reagents for protein expression and purification.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive structural biology and bioinformatics study that should definitely contain
    research tools, particularly computational tools. The detailed Methods section describes extensive
    use of bioinformatics software, databases, and structural analysis tools. The study involves
    sequence analysis, structural modeling, and hot spot analysis - all requiring specialized software.
    The absence of any mined tools suggests significant under-mining of computational tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Significant under-mining of computational tools: This bioinformatics/structural biology study
      extensively uses computational tools but none were detected by the mining algorithm
    - Methods section contains detailed descriptions of at least 10 computational tools with
      version numbers, vendor information, and specific parameters
    - Missing database tools (UniProt, NCBI, PDB) that are fundamental to bioinformatics research
    - Missing molecular visualization and analysis software (PyMOL, Flare, ChemSketch)
    - Missing sequence alignment tools (Clustal Omega, BLASTp, COBALT)
    - Missing web-based analysis tools (FTMap server)
  recommendations: |
    - All 10 identified computational tools should be added to the mining results
    - The mining algorithm needs significant improvement for detecting computational tools
    - Patterns should be added to catch software with version numbers and vendor information
    - Database mentions (UniProt, NCBI, PDB) should be recognized as computational tools
    - Context phrases like "analyzed using", "performed using", "obtained from" are strong indicators
    - Version numbers and vendor information are reliable indicators of software tools
    - Web-based tools with URLs should be captured
    - This publication demonstrates the need for better computational tool mining patterns
