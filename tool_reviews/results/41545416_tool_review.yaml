    Bioinformatics Analysis → computational tools (software, pipelines, mathematical modeling software)
    This is a mathematical modeling study that develops differential equations to model immune-glioma interactions.
    Expected tools include mathematical modeling software, simulation tools, and computational analysis platforms.
    May also contain references to experimental tools from literature that informed the model parameters.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a mathematical modeling study that develops a system of differential equations to model asthma-mediated control of optic glioma growth.
    The publication would typically use computational tools for mathematical modeling, simulation, and analysis.
    While it references biological entities (CCL4, CCR5, NF-κB), these appear to be model variables rather than experimental tools used in lab work.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a computational modeling study
    - MATLAB and ode15s solver were clearly used but not detected by mining patterns
    - Mathematical modeling studies require different pattern recognition than lab research
  recommendations: |
    The two computational tools (MATLAB and ode15s) should be added as they are explicitly used for all simulations.
    Mathematical modeling publications need better pattern coverage for computational tools.
    The suggested patterns would help capture similar tools in future mathematical modeling studies.
    No experimental observations were extracted as this is a theoretical modeling study without empirical results.
