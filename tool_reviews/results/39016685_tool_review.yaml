  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: No tools were mined from this publication despite it being a comprehensive laboratory research study
    - The publication contains extensive Methods section with detailed protocols using multiple research tools
    - At least 22 clear research tools were identified that should have been detected by mining
    - Cell lines from ATCC with standard nomenclature were missed
    - Antibodies with catalog numbers and clone names were missed
    - Genetic reagents including CRISPR constructs and siRNAs were missed
    - Computational tools for image analysis and proteomics were missed
    - This represents a significant failure of the mining system for this publication type
  recommendations: |
    - URGENT: Review and improve mining patterns for this publication type
    - All 22 identified tools should be added to the database with high confidence
    - Implement the 10 suggested patterns to catch similar tools in future mining
    - This publication demonstrates the need for better detection of:
      * Standard cell line nomenclature (U87-MG, U251-MG pattern)
      * NF-specific cell lines (ipnNF prefix pattern)
      * Antibodies with clone names in parentheses
      * Genetic reagents with Addgene numbers
      * Common computational tools (ImageJ/Fiji, R, microscopy software)
    - Consider manual curation of similar high-quality lab research publications
    - The mining system appears to have completely failed for this publication despite clear tool usage
