  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on publication type (Clinical Study with quantitative MRI analysis):
    - Clinical assessment tools: Visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain assessment mentioned
    - Computational tools: MATLAB, R, GraphPad Prism, 3D Slicer for image analysis
    - Potentially imaging tools/protocols: MRI sequences and analysis pipelines
    
    This is a clinical imaging study that uses computational analysis tools for quantitative MRI
    processing and statistical analysis. The study also uses clinical pain assessment scales.
    While no traditional lab tools are expected, computational and clinical assessment tools
    are highly likely to be present.
  overallAssessment: |
    This clinical study investigating DRG alterations in NF1 patients using quantitative MRI
    would be expected to contain computational tools for image processing and statistical analysis,
    as well as clinical assessment tools for pain evaluation. The detailed Methods section describes
    sophisticated image analysis workflows that require specialized software tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    Major issues found during review:
    - Mining completely failed to detect any tools despite clear presence of multiple computational and clinical assessment tools
    - Clinical assessment tool patterns appear to be missing (visual analogue scale)
    - Computational tool patterns are inadequate for detecting software with full citations and versions
    - Medical imaging software (3D Slicer) not detected despite clear usage context
    - Statistical software (R, GraphPad Prism) with version information not detected
  recommendations: |
    Critical recommendations for this publication:
    - All 5 missed tools should be added to the database - they represent genuine research tools used in the study
    - Mining patterns need significant improvement for clinical studies that use computational analysis
    - Clinical assessment tool patterns are clearly inadequate and need expansion
    - Computational tool patterns should better handle software citations with versions and URLs
    - This represents a complete mining failure for a publication type that should contain multiple tools
    - The suggested patterns should be implemented to prevent similar misses in clinical imaging studies
    - No observations can be extracted since no tools were validated, but the study does contain quantitative findings about DRG alterations
