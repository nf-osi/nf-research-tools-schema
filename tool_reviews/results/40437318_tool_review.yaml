    Clinical Study → clinical assessment tools (pain scales, quality of life measures), computational tools for image analysis
    This study uses quantitative MRI techniques and statistical analysis software, plus clinical pain assessment scales.
    Expected tools: MRI imaging protocols, image analysis software (MATLAB, 3D Slicer, R), pain assessment scales (VAS).
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a clinical imaging study comparing NF1 patients with/without pain to healthy controls using quantitative MRI.
    Clinical studies typically use assessment tools for patient evaluation and computational tools for data analysis.
    The presence of detailed Methods section with imaging protocols and statistical analysis indicates likely tool usage.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite clear tool usage in Methods section
    - Clinical assessment tools (VAS pain scale) not captured by current patterns
    - Computational tools with specific versions not detected
    - Mining patterns appear insufficient for clinical study tool types
  recommendations: |
    Several important tools were missed that should be added:
    - Visual analogue scale (VAS) is a validated clinical assessment tool used for patient selection
    - MATLAB and 3D Slicer are specialized computational tools with versions, indicating actual usage
    - R could be added but is generic statistical software
    - GraphPad Prism should not be added as it's generic statistical software
    - Patterns for clinical assessment tools and versioned software need improvement
    - No observations extracted as no tools were validated as accepted
