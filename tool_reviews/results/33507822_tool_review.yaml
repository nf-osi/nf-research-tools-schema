    Clinical Trial → clinical assessment tools (patient-reported outcome measures, pain scales, quality of life instruments), computational tools for pharmacokinetic analysis and statistical modeling
    
    This phase II clinical trial would be expected to use validated clinical assessment instruments to measure patient outcomes, pain, and quality of life. Additionally, computational tools for pharmacokinetic modeling and statistical analysis would be standard.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a phase II clinical trial testing mirdametinib in NF1 patients with plexiform neurofibromas. Clinical trials routinely use validated assessment tools to measure patient outcomes, including pain scales and quality of life instruments. The study also involves pharmacokinetic analysis which requires computational modeling tools. While no traditional lab research tools are expected, clinical assessment tools are legitimate research instruments in this context.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining failed to capture any tools despite this being a clinical trial with clear tool usage
    - Multiple validated clinical assessment instruments were used but not detected
    - Pharmacokinetic analysis software tools were missed despite detailed methodology
    - Clinical assessment tools are legitimate research instruments but may be under-represented in current mining patterns
  recommendations: |
    All six potentially missed tools should be added as they represent legitimate research instruments:
    - Three clinical assessment tools (NRS-11, Brief Pain Inventory, PedsQL NF1 module) are validated instruments
    - Two computational tools (Phoenix WinNonlin, NONMEM) are specialized pharmacokinetic analysis software
    - One clinical grading system (CTCAE v4.0) is a standardized assessment tool
    Mining patterns should be enhanced to better capture clinical assessment instruments and pharmacokinetic analysis software.
    No observations were extracted as no tools were initially validated, but the clinical outcomes data could provide valuable observations once tools are properly validated.
