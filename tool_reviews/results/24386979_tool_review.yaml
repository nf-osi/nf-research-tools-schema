    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    
    This is a laboratory research study investigating the interaction between Ras signaling and hydroquinone toxicity
    using both yeast and mammalian cell models. The study includes:
    - Yeast genetic studies with deletion strains and overexpression systems
    - Mouse models with conditional Nf1 knockout
    - Primary cell culture systems (bone marrow cells, erythropoietic cultures)
    - Molecular biology techniques and reagents
    - Statistical analysis software
    
    Expected tools include: animal models (mouse strains), cell lines (yeast strains), genetic reagents (plasmids, 
    deletion constructs), antibodies (for cell sorting), and computational tools (for data analysis).
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study that should contain multiple research tools. The publication
    describes detailed experimental methods using yeast genetic models, mouse models with conditional gene knockout,
    primary cell culture systems, and various molecular biology reagents. The extensive Methods section indicates
    active experimental usage of research tools rather than just citations. Tools are expected across multiple
    categories including animal models, genetic reagents, antibodies, and computational tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were mined from this publication despite it being a comprehensive laboratory research study
    - Multiple clear research tools were missed including yeast strains, mouse models, antibodies, and software
    - The mining system failed to capture standard genetic nomenclature (gene deletions with Δ symbol)
    - Antibody cocktails with specific targets and vendor information were not detected
    - Commercial reagents with catalog numbers were missed
    - Statistical software with version numbers were not captured
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous legitimate research tools that were completely missed by the mining system.
    All 17 identified tools should be added to the database as they represent genuine research tools with:
    - Clear experimental usage context in detailed Methods section
    - Vendor information and catalog numbers where applicable
    - Standard nomenclature for genetic reagents and cell lines
    - Version numbers for computational tools
    
    The mining patterns need significant improvement to capture:
    - Yeast genetic nomenclature (strain names, deletion symbols)
    - Antibody naming conventions with Greek letters
    - Mouse model Cre-lox system terminology
    - Software version patterns
    - Commercial product catalog numbers
    
    Seven high-quality scientific observations were extracted showing phenotypic differences between 
    genotypes in response to hydroquinone treatment, providing valuable functional data for the research tools.
