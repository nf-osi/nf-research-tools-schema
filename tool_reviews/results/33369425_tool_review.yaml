    This is a computational biophysics study using machine learning to analyze molecular dynamics simulations.
    Expected tool types:
    - Computational tools (software, analysis pipelines, ML algorithms) - HIGHLY EXPECTED
    - Potentially some lab reagents if experimental validation was performed
    
    The publication focuses on:
    - Molecular dynamics simulations using AMBER16, Schrödinger suite
    - Machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, SVM) implemented in MATLAB
    - Structural analysis tools (VMD, GROMACS)
    - Statistical analysis and visualization tools
    
    This type of study typically contains multiple computational tools for simulation, analysis, and visualization.
  overallAssessment: |
    This computational biophysics study extensively uses molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning
    to analyze protein-ligand interactions. The detailed Methods section describes multiple software packages,
    algorithms, and computational workflows. This publication type typically contains numerous computational
    tools and should yield high-quality tool mining results. However, no tools were actually mined from this
    publication, which represents a significant mining failure given the extensive computational methodology described.

    CRITICAL MINING FAILURE: This computational biophysics study contains extensive computational methodology
    but NO TOOLS were mined. Major issues identified:
    - Publication has detailed Methods section describing multiple software packages (AMBER16, Schrödinger, VMD, GROMACS, MATLAB)
    - At least 13 computational tools were clearly missed during mining
    - Tools are mentioned with specific version numbers and usage contexts
    - This represents a significant failure of the computational tool mining patterns
    - The study type (molecular dynamics + machine learning) should be high-yield for computational tools
  recommendations: |
    URGENT PATTERN UPDATES NEEDED:
    - Add patterns for major MD software (AMBER, GROMACS, Schrödinger)
    - Improve version number detection (e.g., "version X.X", "vX.X", "release YYYY-X")
    - Add patterns for MATLAB and its toolboxes
    - Include molecular visualization software (VMD, PyMOL, ChimeraX)
    - Add force field parameter sets (ff99SB, GAFF, CHARMM, etc.)
    - Improve context detection for "using", "performed with", "analyzed using"
    
    This publication demonstrates major gaps in computational tool mining that need immediate attention.
    The mining system failed to detect any of the 13+ computational tools clearly present in the Methods section.
    
    No observations could be extracted since no tools were validated.
    
    PRIORITY: Update computational tool patterns based on this analysis to prevent similar mining failures.
