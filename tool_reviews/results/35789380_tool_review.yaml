    This is a comprehensive lab research study investigating cancer biology mechanisms. Expected tool types include:
    - Cell lines: Multiple human and mouse MPNST cell lines mentioned with RRIDs
    - Animal models: Mouse xenograft models (CB-17 SCID mice) with specific strain identifiers
    - Genetic reagents: Multiple plasmids from Addgene, CRISPR constructs, shRNA libraries
    - Computational tools: Extensive bioinformatics analysis using named software with RRIDs
    - Antibodies: Western blot and ChIP-seq experiments require specific antibodies
    
    The publication contains extensive Methods section with detailed experimental procedures,
    indicating active tool usage rather than just citations.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a high-quality lab research publication with extensive experimental work including cell culture,
    animal studies, molecular biology techniques, and computational analysis. The detailed Methods section
    indicates active development and usage of multiple research tool categories. Tools are expected across
    all lab research categories given the comprehensive experimental approach.

    Critical mining failure - this publication contains extensive research tools that were completely missed:
    - 11 cell lines with RRIDs and catalog numbers not detected
    - 1 animal model (CB-17 SCID mice) with vendor and RRID not detected  
    - 9 genetic reagents (plasmids) with Addgene numbers and RRIDs not detected
    - 21 computational tools with versions and RRIDs not detected
    - All tools have clear identifiers (RRIDs, catalog numbers, versions) that should trigger detection
    - This represents a complete failure of the mining algorithm for a tool-rich publication
  recommendations: |
    URGENT: Complete overhaul of mining patterns needed. This publication should have yielded 40+ tools but found zero.
    
    Immediate actions needed:
    1. Add RRID-based detection patterns - RRIDs are universal tool identifiers
    2. Add Addgene plasmid number patterns for genetic reagents  
    3. Add software version detection patterns (v1.2.3, version 1.2.3)
    4. Add vendor name patterns (ATCC, Taconic, etc.)
    5. Add standard cell line naming patterns (hyphenated names, NCI- prefix, etc.)
    6. Add context phrase patterns ("gift from", "provided by", "obtained from")
    
    This publication demonstrates that the current mining approach is fundamentally inadequate
    for detecting research tools even when they are clearly identified with standard nomenclature
    and universal identifiers. The patterns suggested above would capture the majority of missed tools.
    
    All 42 potentially missed tools should be added to the database as they represent legitimate
    research tools actively used in this comprehensive experimental study.
