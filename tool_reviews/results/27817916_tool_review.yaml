  title: "Orbital/Periorbital Plexiform Neurofibromas in Children with Neurofibromatosis Type 1: Multidisciplinary Recommendations for Care."
  queryType: "clinical"  # From PubMed query (hint only)
  publicationType: "Other"  # This is a consensus statement/clinical recommendations paper
  publicationTypeConfidence: 0.95  # High confidence - clearly a consensus statement
  hasMethodsSection: No

  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on publication type (Clinical Consensus Statement/Recommendations):
    - Clinical assessment tools → Unlikely, as this is recommendations for care rather than a study using assessment instruments
    - Computational tools → Unlikely, no data analysis described
    - Lab research tools → Very unlikely, no experimental work described
    
    This is a consensus statement providing clinical care recommendations, not a research study that would typically use or develop research tools. The focus is on establishing clinical guidelines rather than conducting experiments or assessments.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication is a consensus statement providing multidisciplinary recommendations for clinical care of children with orbital/periorbital plexiform neurofibromas in NF1. It does not describe experimental research, clinical trials, or systematic assessments that would typically involve research tools. The absence of Methods, Results, and Discussion sections confirms this is a recommendations/guidelines paper rather than an empirical study. No research tools are expected in this type of publication.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a consensus statement/clinical recommendations paper, not an experimental study
    - No Methods section present, indicating no experimental procedures were performed
    - No Results or Discussion sections available for analysis
    - Publication focuses on establishing clinical care guidelines rather than conducting research
    - This publication type would not be expected to contain research tools
  recommendations: |
    This publication should not have been included in tool mining as it is a consensus statement providing clinical care recommendations rather than an experimental study. The mining correctly identified zero tools, which is appropriate for this publication type. 
    
    Recommendations:
    1. Consider filtering out consensus statements, clinical guidelines, and recommendation papers from tool mining pipelines
    2. Publications with titles containing "recommendations", "consensus", "guidelines", or "statement" may be good candidates for exclusion
    3. Publications without Methods sections should be flagged for manual review before tool mining
    4. The clinical query that identified this paper may need refinement to focus on actual clinical studies rather than clinical recommendations
    
    No tools were missed and no new patterns are needed for this publication type.
