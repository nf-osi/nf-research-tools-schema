  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a clinical neuroscience study using behavioral testing, EEG, and fMRI to examine motor deficits in NF1 patients.
    Expected tool types:
    - Clinical assessment tools: Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III), Stroop Colour and Word Test, Edinburgh Handedness Inventory
    - Computational tools: BrainVoyager QX, EEGlab toolbox, Matlab, Psychophysics Toolbox 3
    - Equipment/hardware: EEG systems, fMRI scanners, response recording devices
    
    Note: While queryType is "bench", this is actually a clinical study with human participants, not laboratory bench research.
    The study contains both clinical assessment tools and computational analysis tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    This clinical neuroscience study clearly uses multiple research tools including validated clinical assessment instruments,
    computational analysis software, and specialized equipment. The comprehensive Methods section describes detailed protocols
    for behavioral testing, EEG recording, and fMRI acquisition/analysis. Tools are expected and extensively used throughout
    the experimental procedures. The mining system appears to have missed multiple legitimate research tools.

      Groups did not differ regarding the Interference Index (independent-samples t tests, p > .05), 
      indicating similar ability to control over the interference effect. This suggests that executive 
      dysfunction did not underlie the observed motor deficits in NF1 patients, as both groups showed 
      comparable performance on this executive function measure.

      Full-scale IQ values were in the normal range for the NF1 patients (mean IQ ± SD 104.4 ± 13.7).

      intellectual impairment, as their IQ scores fell within the normal range.

      Time-frequency analysis revealed similar oscillatory patterns across NF1 and control groups that 
      mirrored motor behavior. Both groups exhibited marked cyclic synchronization/desynchronization 
      patterns in the mu and beta range (8-12 Hz and 20-26 Hz respectively), with no statistical 
      differences in power between groups across motor pacing frequencies.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Mining system completely failed to identify any tools despite this being a tool-rich publication
    - Multiple validated clinical assessment tools were missed (WAIS-III, Stroop Test, Edinburgh Handedness Inventory)
    - Several computational analysis tools were missed (BrainVoyager, EEGlab, Psychophysics Toolbox, Matlab)
    - Publication was classified as "bench" research but is actually a clinical study with human participants
    - No pattern recognition for clinical assessment tools or neuroimaging software
  recommendations: |
    This publication should have yielded 8+ research tools but the mining system found none. This represents
    a major failure in tool detection. Recommendations:
    
    1. Add all 8 identified tools to the database - they are clearly legitimate research tools with proper usage context
    2. Implement suggested patterns for clinical assessment tools (WAIS, Stroop, Edinburgh Handedness Inventory)
    3. Improve detection of neuroimaging software (BrainVoyager, EEGlab) and experimental presentation tools
    4. Add context phrase patterns for "assessed using", "analyzed using", "processed using"
    5. Improve vendor/version detection patterns for software identification
    6. Review classification system - "bench" query found a clinical study, suggesting query refinement needed
    7. All missed tools have clear experimental usage context and should be prioritized for addition
    8. The observations extracted show meaningful scientific findings related to tool performance and limitations
