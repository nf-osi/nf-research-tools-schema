    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a comprehensive laboratory study using mouse models, histological analysis, mechanical testing,
    and advanced imaging techniques. Expected tools include animal models (conditional knockout mice),
    antibodies for immunohistochemistry, computational tools for image analysis, and specialized equipment
    for mechanical and structural analysis.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a sophisticated laboratory research study investigating bone fragility mechanisms in NF1 using
    multiple experimental approaches. The extensive Methods section describes animal models, histological
    techniques, mechanical testing, and advanced imaging methods, indicating high likelihood of research
    tool usage. The study combines mouse genetics, tissue analysis, and quantitative measurements typical
    of modern biomedical research requiring specialized tools and reagents.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple clear research tools present in Methods section were missed
    - Animal models with standard genetic nomenclature not detected
    - Antibodies with catalog numbers and vendors not identified
    - Computational tools for image analysis and data processing not captured
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous legitimate research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The study uses conditional knockout mouse models (Nf1Prx1, Nf1Col1), specific antibodies with catalog numbers,
    and multiple computational tools for analysis. All identified tools should be added as they represent genuine
    research reagents and tools used in the experimental procedures. The mining patterns need significant improvement
    to capture mouse genetic nomenclature, antibody reagents, and analysis software. Manual curator review is
    recommended to validate the suggested tools and ensure complete tool capture for this publication type.
