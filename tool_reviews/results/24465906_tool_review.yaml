    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    
    This publication is a comprehensive laboratory study investigating bone fragility in NF1 using:
    - Conditional mouse models (animal models)
    - Immunohistochemistry (antibodies)
    - Advanced imaging and analysis (computational tools)
    - Human tissue samples (not PDX, but clinical specimens)
    
    Expected tool types: animal models, antibodies, computational tools
    Less likely: cell lines, genetic reagents, organoids, PDX, clinical assessment tools
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a high-quality laboratory research publication with extensive experimental methods investigating bone pathology in NF1.
    The study uses multiple mouse models, immunohistochemistry, advanced imaging techniques, and computational analysis.
    Should definitely contain research tools including animal models, antibodies, and computational software.
    The absence of any mined tools suggests significant mining failures that need to be addressed.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Complete mining failure - zero tools extracted from a publication rich in research tools
    - Missing animal models: Two conditional knockout mouse models (Nf1Prx1, Nf1Col1) not captured
    - Missing antibodies: Two antibodies with catalog numbers and vendor information not captured
    - Missing computational tools: Five software tools (NRecon, CTan, AxioVision, ImageJ, Labview) not captured
    - Pattern gaps: Current patterns fail to capture standard mouse model nomenclature and specialized software
  recommendations: |
    All 9 identified tools should be added to the database - this represents a complete mining failure.
    
    Priority additions:
    1. Animal models (Nf1Prx1, Nf1Col1) - core experimental models with extensive phenotypic data
    2. Antibodies with catalog numbers - clear research reagents with vendor information
    3. Computational tools - essential for data analysis and reproducibility
    
    Pattern improvements needed:
    - Add conditional knockout mouse nomenclature patterns (Nf1[tissue]+ mice)
    - Improve antibody detection for non-standard naming conventions
    - Add specialized imaging/analysis software patterns
    - Include vendor/catalog number context as strong tool indicators
    
    This publication provides excellent examples of tools that should be captured and demonstrates
    significant gaps in current mining patterns. The extracted observations show the scientific
    value of properly capturing these tools for phenotypic data linkage.
