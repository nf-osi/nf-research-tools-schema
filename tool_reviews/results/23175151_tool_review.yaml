  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Complete failure of mining system to detect any tools despite extensive experimental methods
    - Multiple categories of tools completely missed: 3 cell lines, 4 antibodies, 9 computational tools, 2 genetic reagents
    - No recognition of standard cell line nomenclature (sNF96.2, HEK293T, HT1080)
    - Antibodies with catalog numbers and vendor information not detected
    - Bioinformatics tools and software packages missed despite clear usage context
    - miRNA mimics and transfection reagents not caught
    - Mining patterns appear inadequate for comprehensive tool detection in molecular biology papers
  recommendations: |
    All 20 potentially missed tools should be added to the database as they represent genuine research tools used in this study.
    The mining system requires significant improvement in pattern recognition for:
    1. Cell line nomenclature and sourcing context
    2. Antibody detection with catalog numbers and vendors
    3. Bioinformatics software and computational tools
    4. Genetic reagents including miRNA mimics and controls
    5. Context phrases indicating experimental tool usage
    
    This publication demonstrates major gaps in current mining capabilities for laboratory research tools.
    The suggested patterns should be implemented to improve detection of similar tools in future mining.
    Manual curator review is recommended for this publication type to ensure comprehensive tool capture.
    
    Scientific observations were successfully extracted for validated tools, showing functional effects of miR-29c on cell migration and target gene expression.
