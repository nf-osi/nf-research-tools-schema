  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining failed to capture any tools despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple cell lines (sNF96.2, HEK293T, HT1080) were completely missed
    - Commercial antibodies with catalog numbers and vendors were not detected
    - Molecular biology kits and assays (TaqMan, miRNAeasy) were not captured
    - Computational tools (Bioconductor, limma, IncuCyte) were not identified
    - This represents a significant failure of the mining patterns for lab research tools
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains extensive research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    All 14 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine research reagents used in experiments.
    The mining patterns need significant improvement for cell lines, antibodies, commercial kits, and computational tools.
    New patterns should be implemented to capture standard naming conventions and vendor-specific terminology.
    No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated, but this study would contain valuable functional data about miR-29c effects.
