    Based on this being a computational methods development paper focused on deep learning for medical image segmentation:
    - Computational tools (software, frameworks, libraries) are highly expected
    - Programming languages and development environments likely used
    - Deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow) expected
    - Image processing libraries expected
    - Medical imaging software potentially used
    - No lab research tools (antibodies, cell lines, animal models) expected
    - No clinical assessment tools expected as this is methods development, not clinical study
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a computational methods development paper that proposes Deep Interactive Networks (DINs) for neurofibroma segmentation on whole-body MRI. 
    Such papers typically use extensive computational tools including deep learning frameworks, programming languages, image processing libraries, and medical imaging software.
    The mining system found zero tools, which is highly unusual for this type of computational research and suggests significant tools were missed.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Mining system completely failed to identify any computational tools in a methods development paper
    - This is a computational research paper that extensively uses and develops deep learning methods
    - At least 12 computational tools were clearly mentioned and should have been captured
    - Tools include both established methods (U-Net, V-Net, nnU-Net) and novel contributions (DINs, ExpDT)
    - Commercial software tools (3DQI, MEDx) were also missed
    - Classical computer vision algorithms (Random Walk, Graph Cut, Active Contour) were not captured
  recommendations: |
    - All 12 identified computational tools should be added to the mining results
    - The mining patterns need significant improvement for computational/bioinformatics papers
    - Need better recognition of deep learning architectures and medical imaging software
    - Pattern matching should include algorithm names, software tools, and method development phrases
    - This paper represents a complete mining failure - zero tools found when 12+ were clearly present
    - Suggests the current mining approach is heavily biased toward lab research tools and misses computational tools
    - No observations were extracted as this is a methods development paper without experimental validation on biological samples
