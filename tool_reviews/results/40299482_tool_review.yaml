    Based on the publication type (Clinical Study) and title mentioning "questionnaire" and "Apple Watch Sleep Assessment":
    - Clinical assessment tools: Custom questionnaire for sleep disorder assessment
    - Computational tools: Apple Watch Ultra model 2 with Sleep++ application for sleep parameter measurement
    - Potentially computational tools for statistical analysis (chi-square tests, t-tests mentioned)
    
    This is an observational case-control study comparing sleep disorders in NF1 patients vs. controls.
    The study uses both subjective (questionnaire) and objective (Apple Watch) assessment methods.
    No lab research tools (antibodies, cell lines, animal models) are expected.

  overallAssessment: |
    This clinical observational study is highly likely to contain research tools, specifically clinical assessment tools.
    The study explicitly describes developing and using a custom questionnaire for sleep disorder assessment and employs
    Apple Watch technology for objective sleep parameter measurement. These represent legitimate research tools for
    clinical data collection and patient assessment, even though this is not traditional laboratory research.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    Major mining gaps identified:
    - No tools were mined from this clinical study despite clear tool usage
    - Custom questionnaire development completely missed
    - Wearable device (Apple Watch) for clinical assessment not detected
    - Mobile application (Sleep++) for data collection not captured
    - Statistical analysis methods (chi-square, t-tests) not identified
    - Mining patterns appear optimized for lab research but miss clinical assessment tools
  recommendations: |
    Critical recommendations for this publication:
    - ADD all 5 potentially missed tools - this study clearly uses legitimate research tools
    - The custom questionnaire is a primary research tool (clinical assessment instrument)
    - Apple Watch Ultra model 2 is a validated clinical assessment device for sleep monitoring
    - Sleep++ application is the computational tool enabling data collection
    - Statistical methods (chi-square, t-tests) are computational tools for analysis
    - Mining patterns need significant enhancement for clinical assessment tools
    - Current patterns appear biased toward lab research and miss clinical study tools
    - This publication demonstrates major gaps in clinical tool detection capabilities
    - All suggested patterns should be implemented to improve clinical tool mining
    - No observations can be extracted since Results/Discussion sections were not provided
