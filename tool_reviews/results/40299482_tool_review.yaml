    Clinical Study → clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, scales), possibly computational tools for analysis
    This study specifically mentions questionnaire development and Apple Watch assessment, indicating clinical assessment tools.
    Statistical analysis methods may involve computational tools for data processing.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a clinical observational case-control study comparing sleep disorders in NF1 patients versus controls.
    The study develops and uses clinical assessment tools (questionnaire, Apple Watch sleep monitoring) which are valid research tools.
    Clinical studies routinely use validated instruments and devices for patient assessment, making tool usage highly expected.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining failed to capture clinical assessment tools despite clear usage in methods
    - Questionnaire development and administration not detected by current patterns
    - Wearable device (Apple Watch) used for clinical monitoring missed
    - Mobile application (Sleep++) for data collection not captured
    - Generic statistical tests identified but these are not NF-specific tools
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains legitimate clinical assessment tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The questionnaire, Apple Watch, and Sleep++ application are all valid research tools used for patient assessment.
    Current mining patterns need enhancement for clinical assessment tools, particularly questionnaires and wearable devices.
    Statistical tests (chi-square, t-tests) should not be added as they are generic across all research.
    No observations can be extracted since Results/Discussion sections are not available.
    Manual curator should review to confirm these clinical tools warrant inclusion in the database.
