    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools
    
    This is a molecular biology/cell biology study investigating mitochondrial metabolism in neurofibromatosis.
    Expected tools include:
    - Cell lines (MEFs, MPNST cells, human cell lines)
    - Animal models (knockout mice, xenograft models)
    - Genetic reagents (plasmids, vectors, CRISPR constructs)
    - Antibodies (for Western blots, immunohistochemistry)
    - Computational tools (analysis software, statistical packages)
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study with extensive experimental methods including cell culture,
    molecular biology techniques, animal experiments, and biochemical assays. The publication contains detailed
    Methods section describing experimental procedures, indicating active tool usage rather than just citations.
    Multiple research tool categories are expected and should be present throughout the methodology.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Mining completely failed to identify any tools despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - 25+ research tools were missed including essential cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, antibodies, and computational tools
    - Standard nomenclature patterns not recognized (MEF knockout notation, MPNST cell lines, Addgene plasmids)
    - Vendor information and catalog numbers not captured as tool indicators
    - Specialized instruments and software not identified despite clear usage context
  recommendations: |
    - URGENT: Complete overhaul of mining patterns needed - current system missed 100% of tools in this publication
    - Add patterns for knockout cell line nomenclature (Nf1−/−, Nf1+/+, etc.)
    - Include Addgene catalog numbers as strong indicators of genetic reagents
    - Recognize standard plasmid naming conventions (p[Name] vector, pcDNA constructs)
    - Add patterns for specialized cell lines (MPNST, neurofibroma cell lines)
    - Include vendor information patterns for instruments and reagents
    - Add software analysis context phrases ("analyzed with", "using", etc.)
    - Consider this publication as a test case for pattern validation
    - All 25 missed tools should be added to improve future mining accuracy
    - Multiple high-quality scientific observations were extracted showing tool efficacy and usage
