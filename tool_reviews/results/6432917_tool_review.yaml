    Lab Research → animal models, cell lines, computational tools, genetic reagents
    
    This is a 1984 laboratory study investigating melanoma ultrastructure using:
    - Animal experiments (BDF1 hybrid mice)
    - Tumor transplantation (B16/F10 melanoma)
    - Electron microscopy techniques
    - Statistical analysis software
    
    Expected tools: animal models (mouse strains), cell lines (B16 melanoma), 
    computational tools (GraphPad Prism), and various laboratory reagents.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a classic laboratory research publication with detailed experimental methods.
    The study uses animal models, transplantable tumor cell lines, and sophisticated
    microscopy techniques, indicating high likelihood of containing multiple research tools.
    The comprehensive Methods section describes specific procedures that would require
    validated research tools across multiple categories.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were mined from this publication despite clear laboratory research content
    - Multiple obvious research tools were missed including standard animal models, cell lines, and computational tools
    - Mining patterns failed to capture standard nomenclature for mouse strains (BDF1 hybrid mice)
    - Cell line designations with subclones (B16/F10) were not recognized
    - Statistical analysis software with version numbers was not detected
    - Scientific instruments with model numbers and vendor information were missed
  recommendations: |
    This publication should have yielded multiple validated tools across several categories:
    
    SHOULD BE ADDED:
    - BDF1 hybrid mice (animal model) - standard laboratory mouse strain
    - B16/F10 melanoma and B16 melanoma (cell lines) - well-established melanoma models
    - GraphPad Prism 6.0 (computational tool) - statistical analysis software
    - JEM-100CX microscope, LKB-III ultramicrotome, Gatan camera (computational tools) - scientific instruments
    
    PATTERN IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:
    - Better recognition of mouse strain nomenclature
    - Cell line naming with subclone designations
    - Scientific instrument model numbers with vendor information
    - Statistical software usage contexts
    
    OBSERVATIONS EXTRACTED:
    - Significant body weight and tumor growth differences under lighting conditions
    - Detailed cellular morphology changes and ultrastructural observations
    - Proper usage instructions for computational tools
    
    This represents a significant mining failure that missed 7 legitimate research tools
    from a classic laboratory research publication.
