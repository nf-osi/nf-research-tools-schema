    Based on publication type (Bioinformatics Analysis - genetic linkage study):
    - Computational tools (software, pipelines) - EXPECTED for linkage analysis
    - Genetic reagents - POSSIBLE (polymorphic markers mentioned)
    
    This is a 1987 genetic linkage analysis study using computational methods to analyze
    19 polymorphic markers across 15 neurofibromatosis families. While it lacks detailed
    Methods sections typical of modern papers, it explicitly mentions using computer
    software for analysis, making computational tools highly expected.
  overallAssessment: |
    This 1987 genetic linkage study would typically use computational tools for statistical
    analysis of genetic markers. The abstract explicitly mentions "computer programme M-Link"
    for linkage analysis, indicating computational tool usage. However, the publication lacks
    detailed Methods sections typical of modern papers, making tool identification challenging.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - One computational tool (M-Link) was clearly missed despite explicit mention in abstract
    - Publication from 1987 may use different terminology ("computer programme" vs "software")
    - Lack of detailed Methods section limits tool identification, but abstract contains clear tool usage
    - Mining patterns may be biased toward modern terminology and miss historical computational tools
  recommendations: |
    - Add M-Link as a computational tool - it's explicitly mentioned and widely used for genetic linkage analysis
    - Update mining patterns to capture older terminology for computational tools ("computer programme", "computer program")
    - Consider that older publications may have different section structures but still contain valid tool usage
    - This publication demonstrates that even brief abstracts can contain clear tool mentions that should be captured
    - The missed M-Link tool suggests mining patterns need improvement for historical bioinformatics software
