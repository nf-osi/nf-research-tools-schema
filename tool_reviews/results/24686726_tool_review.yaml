    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    
    This is a laboratory research study using zebrafish models to investigate glioma development.
    Expected tools include:
    - Animal models (zebrafish strains and transgenic lines)
    - Antibodies for immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence
    - Genetic reagents (plasmids, constructs, promoters)
    - Computational tools for microarray analysis and data processing
    - Cell culture reagents and molecular biology tools
    
    Note: Publications can contain MULTIPLE tool types. A clinical study may use computational tools
    for analysis. A lab study may use clinical assessment tools to measure phenotypes. Always scan
    for ALL 9 tool types regardless of publication type or queryType.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study that extensively uses research tools for zebrafish
    model development and characterization. The study involves transgenic zebrafish generation, 
    immunohistochemistry, microarray analysis, and molecular biology techniques. Multiple categories
    of research tools are expected and should be present throughout the methods and results sections.

    Major issues found during review:
    - No tools were mined despite this being a comprehensive laboratory research study
    - Multiple categories of research tools are extensively used but completely missed
    - 25 clear research tools identified that should have been captured
    - Mining patterns appear inadequate for zebrafish nomenclature and molecular biology tools
    - Antibodies with complete vendor/catalog information not recognized
    - Genetic constructs and reagents not captured
    - Computational tools and software not identified
  recommendations: |
    Overall recommendations for this publication:
    - All 25 identified tools should be added to the mining results
    - This represents a significant failure of the mining system for laboratory research
    - New patterns should be implemented to capture zebrafish transgenic nomenclature
    - Antibody detection patterns need improvement for vendor/catalog format
    - Genetic reagent patterns should include plasmids, vectors, and commercial kits
    - Software and computational tool detection needs enhancement
    - 7 high-quality scientific observations were extracted showing the value of this model system
    - This publication demonstrates the importance of comprehensive tool mining for model organism research
