    Clinical Trial → clinical assessment tools (quality of life measures, toxicity scales, response assessment tools), 
    possibly computational tools for statistical analysis, and imaging tools for volumetric MRI analysis.
    
    This is a Phase II clinical trial that mentions:
    - Quality of life (QOL) evaluation
    - Volumetric MRI analysis for response assessment
    - Toxicity evaluation
    - Statistical analysis (P-values reported)
    
    Expected tools: Clinical assessment tools for QOL measurement, imaging analysis software for volumetric MRI, 
    statistical software for analysis. The publication structure is typical of clinical trials with limited 
    methodological detail in the abstract/brief sections provided.
  overallAssessment: |
    This Phase II clinical trial would typically use multiple research tools including clinical assessment 
    instruments for quality of life measurement, imaging analysis software for volumetric MRI assessment, 
    and statistical software for data analysis. Clinical trials routinely employ validated questionnaires 
    and scales even when not explicitly detailed in brief publication formats. The mention of "quality of 
    life (QOL) also were evaluated" strongly suggests use of standardized clinical assessment tools, though 
    specific instruments are not named in the available text sections.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    Major issues found during review:
    - No tools were initially mined from this clinical trial publication
    - Limited methodological detail available (no Methods section in provided text)
    - Clinical trials typically use multiple research tools that may not be explicitly named in brief formats
    - Quality of life evaluation mentioned but specific instruments not identified
    - Volumetric MRI analysis mentioned but specific software not identified
    - Statistical analysis performed but software not specified
  recommendations: |
    Overall recommendations for this publication:
    - This clinical trial likely uses research tools that were missed by initial mining
    - Volumetric MRI analysis should be considered a computational tool (high confidence)
    - QOL evaluation likely involves clinical assessment tools but specific instruments unknown (moderate confidence)
    - Statistical analysis software was used but not specified (moderate confidence)
    - Consider adding patterns to catch imaging analysis methods and QOL evaluation phrases
    - Clinical trial publications often have limited methodological detail in abstracts/brief sections
    - Full text access might reveal specific tool names in detailed Methods sections
    - This represents a common challenge in mining clinical trial publications where tools are used but not explicitly named
