    This is a strategic review/think tank summary article that describes a collaborative effort to identify
    research priorities for cutaneous neurofibromas (cNF). The publication type is a strategic planning
    document rather than an experimental study. Expected tool types:
    - Unlikely to contain lab research tools (antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents)
    - Unlikely to contain computational tools (no data analysis described)
    - Unlikely to contain advanced cellular models or PDX models (no experimental work)
    - Possibly clinical assessment tools if discussing outcome measures for trials, but this appears
      to be high-level strategic planning rather than specific trial design
    
    The Methods section describes expert panel meetings and literature review, not experimental procedures.
    This is a coordination/planning document that sets research priorities rather than reporting tool usage.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication is a strategic planning document describing a think tank effort to identify research
    priorities for cutaneous neurofibroma therapeutics. It does not report experimental work or clinical
    studies that would typically use research tools. The "Methods" section describes expert panel coordination
    rather than laboratory or clinical procedures. No research tools are expected in this type of publication.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a strategic planning/think tank summary, not experimental research
    - No actual research tools are used or described
    - Methods section describes expert panel coordination, not laboratory procedures
    - This is a coordination document setting research priorities, not reporting tool usage
    - REiNS collaboration mentioned but as an initiative, not a specific assessment tool
  recommendations: |
    This publication correctly had zero tools mined. It is a strategic planning document that describes
    a think tank effort to identify research priorities for cutaneous neurofibroma therapeutics. No
    experimental work is reported, and no research tools are used or developed. The mining algorithm
    correctly identified this as not containing research tools. No changes to mining patterns are
    needed based on this publication, as it represents the type of strategic/planning document that
    should not yield tool extractions.
