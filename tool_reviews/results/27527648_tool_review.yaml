    Based on publication type (Clinical Study focusing on patient-reported outcomes):
    - Clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, scales, outcome measures) - HIGHLY EXPECTED
    - Computational tools for statistical analysis - POSSIBLY EXPECTED
    
    This is a clinical study by the REiNS (Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis) 
    International Collaboration that systematically reviewed and recommended patient-reported outcome (PRO) 
    measures for neurofibromatosis clinical trials. The study specifically focuses on pain and physical 
    functioning assessment tools, making clinical assessment tools the primary expected tool type.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication is a clinical study that systematically reviews and recommends validated patient-reported 
    outcome measures for neurofibromatosis clinical trials. Clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, scales, 
    outcome measures) are highly expected and explicitly mentioned in the Results section. The study methodology 
    involves reviewing existing PRO measures, which constitutes legitimate tool usage in the clinical research context. 
    This type of publication should contain multiple clinical assessment tools as the primary research focus.

      The REiNS PRO group recommends the Numeric Rating Scale-11 for assessing pain intensity in patients 
      aged 8 years and older in neurofibromatosis clinical trials. This recommendation is based on systematic 
      review using four main criteria: patient characteristics, item content, psychometric properties, and 
      feasibility for clinical trials.

      A final consensus recommendation for pain interference measures will be disseminated in future 
      publications based on additional research findings.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Mining completely failed to capture any clinical assessment tools despite this being a clinical study specifically focused on patient-reported outcome measures
    - Multiple validated clinical assessment tools (NRS-11, PROMIS scales, Pain Interference Index) were explicitly mentioned and recommended but not detected
    - Mining patterns appear inadequate for clinical assessment tools, particularly PROMIS system scales and standard pain assessment measures
    - This represents a significant gap in clinical tool detection capabilities
  recommendations: |
    - URGENT: Add comprehensive patterns for PROMIS scales and system (widely used in clinical research)
    - Add patterns for Numeric Rating Scale variations and abbreviations (NRS-X format)
    - Include "Index" as indicator for clinical assessment tools (Pain Interference Index, etc.)
    - Implement context-based detection for clinical assessment phrases ("to assess", "to evaluate", "to measure")
    - This publication demonstrates that clinical assessment tool mining needs substantial improvement
    - All 6 missed tools should be added to the database as they are validated clinical instruments recommended by expert consensus
    - The observations extracted provide valuable usage guidance and age-specific recommendations for these tools in neurofibromatosis research
