  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on the publication type (Review Article) about peripheral nerve sheath tumors in NF1:
    - Review articles typically do not use research tools directly but may cite tools from other studies
    - May reference animal models, cell lines, or genetic reagents used in cited research
    - Could mention clinical assessment tools for tumor evaluation
    - Computational tools for data analysis are unlikely in a review format
    - The focus on peripheral nerve sheath tumors suggests potential references to:
      * Animal models (NF1 knockout mice, tumor models)
      * Cell lines (Schwann cells, MPNST cell lines)
      * Clinical assessment tools (imaging, tumor grading systems)
    
    However, as a review article without a Methods section, any tool mentions would likely be 
    citations from other work rather than direct experimental usage.
  overallAssessment: |
    This appears to be a review article about peripheral nerve sheath tumors in neurofibromatosis type 1.
    Review articles typically synthesize existing literature rather than report new experimental work,
    so the absence of research tools is expected and appropriate. Any tools mentioned would likely be
    references to methods used in cited studies rather than tools used by the authors themselves.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication appears to be a review article, not primary research
    - No Methods section indicating experimental work
    - Any tool mentions would likely be citations from other studies, not direct usage
    - Mining correctly identified no tools as this is appropriate for a review article
  recommendations: |
    The mining results are appropriate for this publication type:
    - Review articles typically do not use research tools directly
    - The absence of mined tools is expected and correct
    - Any tools mentioned would be references to other studies' methods
    - No tools should be added from this publication
    - The mining patterns appear to be working correctly by not flagging review citations as tool usage
    - Consider developing patterns to better distinguish between direct tool usage vs. literature citations
