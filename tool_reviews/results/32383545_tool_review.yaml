  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a comprehensive lab research study focusing on cancer cell biology and mitochondrial function.
    Expected tool types include:
    - Cell lines (multiple cancer cell lines used for experiments)
    - Antibodies (for immunofluorescence, Western blot, immunohistochemistry)
    - Animal models (mouse xenograft models)
    - Genetic reagents (plasmids, shRNAs, fluorescent constructs)
    - Computational tools (image analysis software, data analysis tools)
    
    The study involves extensive experimental work including cell culture, molecular biology,
    microscopy, flow cytometry, and in vivo experiments, all of which require specific research tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication represents a typical lab research study that would extensively use research tools.
    The detailed Methods section describes numerous experimental procedures requiring specific tools.
    The complete absence of mined tools indicates a significant failure in the mining process,
    as this publication clearly contains dozens of research tools across multiple categories.

    CRITICAL MINING FAILURE: This publication contains extensive research tools but NONE were detected:
    - 10+ cell lines (HeLa, MDA-MB-231, S462, PN 04.4, 4T1, CT26, RAW 264.7, C2C12, COLO 741, MEC1)
    - 8+ antibodies with catalog numbers and vendors (anti-HK2, anti-MPP2, anti-GAPDH, ATP5A, etc.)
    - Animal models (Balb/c mice for xenograft studies)
    - 5+ computational tools (ImageJ, CellR, LAS AF, FACSDiva, VevoLAB)
    - Multiple genetic reagents (plasmids, shRNAs, fluorescent constructs)
    
    This represents a complete failure of the mining system for a tool-rich publication.
    The Methods section contains detailed experimental procedures with specific tool names,
    catalog numbers, and vendor information that should be easily detectable.
  recommendations: |
    URGENT MINING SYSTEM REVIEW REQUIRED:
    1. This publication should have 25+ tools detected across all categories
    2. The mining patterns are clearly inadequate for basic research tools
    3. Implement the 10 suggested patterns immediately to capture missed tools
    4. Review mining system architecture - basic cell line and antibody patterns are failing
    5. This publication demonstrates that many lab research studies are likely under-mined
    6. Consider manual curation for high-impact publications like this one
    7. The complete absence of detected tools in a methods-rich publication indicates systematic issues
    8. Test mining system against known tool-rich publications to validate improvements
