    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a laboratory research study involving drug screening on cell lines derived from NF1 patients and mouse models.
    Expected tools include cell lines, antibodies for characterization, animal models (genetically engineered mice),
    and computational tools for data analysis.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study involving drug combination screening on NF1-associated high-grade glioma cell lines.
    The study uses both human patient-derived and mouse model-derived cell lines, extensive antibody panels for characterization,
    and sophisticated computational analysis tools. Multiple research tool types are expected and extensively used throughout the experimental workflow.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Extensive use of cell lines (5 different lines), antibodies (15+ antibodies), animal models, and computational tools
    - All major tool categories are represented but were missed by initial mining
    - RRID identifiers and catalog numbers are present but not captured
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains extensive research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    All 23 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine research tools with proper documentation.
    The cell lines (TM-31, LN319, 17, 5653, 5746) and animal model (NPcis) are core to the study design.
    The antibody panel is well-documented with catalog numbers and vendors.
    Computational tools include both hardware (Incucyte system) and web-based analysis tools.
    The suggested patterns would significantly improve future mining of similar publications.
    No observations were extracted as no tools were initially validated, but this study would yield valuable phenotypic data once tools are properly captured.
