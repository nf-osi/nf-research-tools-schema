  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on publication type (Lab Research with immunohistochemical analysis and PET/CT imaging):
    - Antibodies (for immunohistochemical staining of glucose transporters, hexokinases, etc.)
    - Computational tools (for image analysis, statistical analysis)
    - Clinical assessment tools (for tumor staging, patient evaluation)
    - Potentially genetic reagents (for mutation analysis mentioned)
    
    This is a translational research study combining clinical imaging with laboratory-based 
    immunohistochemical analysis, so multiple tool types are expected across both bench and clinical categories.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a translational research study that combines clinical PET/CT imaging with laboratory-based 
    immunohistochemical analysis of tumor tissues. The study clearly describes experimental methods 
    including antibody-based protein detection, imaging analysis, and statistical modeling. Research 
    tools are definitely expected, particularly antibodies for immunohistochemistry, computational 
    tools for image analysis, and potentially clinical assessment tools for patient evaluation.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    Critical mining failure - this publication contains numerous research tools that were completely missed:
    - 8 antibodies used for immunohistochemical analysis (GLUT-1, GLUT-3, HK-1, HK-2, HK-3, MCT-4, VEGF, CD34, PD-L1/22C3)
    - 7 computational tools used for image analysis and statistical analysis (Pyradiomics, 3D Slicer, scikit-learn, Python, R, limma, sva)
    - The mining system failed to detect any tools despite clear experimental methods describing tool usage
    - This represents a complete failure of the mining algorithm for this publication type
  recommendations: |
    URGENT: Complete revision of mining patterns needed. This publication clearly demonstrates experimental 
    use of multiple research tools across antibodies and computational categories, yet none were detected.
    
    Specific recommendations:
    1. All 16 identified tools should be added to the database - they represent genuine research tools with clear experimental usage
    2. Implement the 5 suggested patterns to catch similar tools in future mining
    3. Review mining algorithm for immunohistochemical studies - this is a common experimental approach that should be reliably detected
    4. Add patterns for computational tools mentioned with version numbers and URLs
    5. The observations extracted show meaningful scientific findings that validate the tool usage
    
    This publication type (translational research with immunohistochemistry + imaging) is common in biomedical literature 
    and the mining system must be able to handle it effectively.
