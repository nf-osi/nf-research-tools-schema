    This is a comprehensive lab research study that should contain multiple tool categories:
    - Antibodies (extensive immunohistochemistry panel described)
    - Advanced cellular models (patient-derived organoids - the main focus)
    - Computational tools (RNA-seq analysis, bioinformatics pipelines)
    - Genetic reagents (cell culture media, growth factors, cytokines)
    - Patient-derived models (organoids derived from patient cNF tissue)
    
    The study involves organoid establishment, drug screening, genomic analysis, and molecular characterization,
    indicating it should contain tools across multiple categories.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication is a comprehensive lab research study developing patient-derived cutaneous neurofibroma organoids
    for drug screening. It contains extensive Methods sections with detailed protocols for organoid culture, 
    immunohistochemistry, genomic analysis, and high-throughput screening. The study should contain numerous research
    tools including antibodies, organoid models, computational analysis tools, and various reagents. The complete
    absence of mined tools suggests a significant failure in the mining process for this publication.

      High-throughput drug screening feasibility demonstrated with 43 targeted kinase inhibitors. Organoids 
      showed differential drug sensitivities that may be patient-specific and linked to different NF1 
      alterations. Shared vulnerabilities identified include sensitivity to copanlisib (PI3K inhibitor), 
      onalespib (Hsp90 inhibitor), linsitinib (IGF-1R inhibitor), and digoxin (Na+/K+ ATPase inhibitor), 
      which induced average residual viability ≤50% across all samples.
