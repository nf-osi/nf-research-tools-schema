    Lab Research → computational tools (bioinformatics software, analysis pipelines), genetic reagents (sequencing kits, primers, enzymes), potentially antibodies for validation
    
    This is a molecular diagnostics/bioinformatics study developing a deep sequencing method for mosaic variant detection.
    Expected tools include: NGS analysis software (alignment, variant calling, annotation), laboratory reagents (sequencing kits, PCR reagents), and potentially validation tools.
    
    Publications can contain MULTIPLE tool types. This study combines wet lab molecular biology with computational analysis,
    so both genetic reagents and computational tools are expected.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication describes a comprehensive laboratory and bioinformatics study developing a deep amplicon sequencing method
    for detecting somatic mosaic variants in NF2. The study includes extensive wet lab work (DNA extraction, PCR, sequencing)
    and computational analysis (alignment, variant calling, statistical analysis). Multiple research tools are expected and
    extensively used throughout the methodology. The complete absence of mined tools (0 total) indicates a significant
    mining failure rather than absence of tools.

    details: |
      MuTect showed limitations in detecting variants with very low allele fractions (~0.01) due to its downsampling strategy.
      Undetected variants in 1% dilution samples were likely affected by this limitation, particularly for SNV events.
    foundIn: "results"
    contextSnippet: "Undetected variants either fall in amplicons with lower coverage or, even if they are supported by a high number of reads, their allele fraction is low (~0.01). The latter case involves only SNVs events and is likely due to the downsampling strategy of MuTect."

    - CRITICAL: Complete mining failure - 0 tools detected despite extensive tool usage
    - Publication contains numerous computational tools (BWA MEM, GATK, MuTect, Annovar, etc.)
    - Multiple genetic reagents (sequencing kits, enzymes, dyes) with vendor information
    - All tools have clear experimental usage context with version numbers and parameters
    - Mining patterns appear to miss standard bioinformatics tools and commercial reagents
  recommendations: |
    URGENT: This publication represents a complete mining failure. Despite containing 17+ clear research tools
    with experimental usage context, ZERO tools were detected. This indicates fundamental gaps in mining patterns.
    
    Key recommendations:
    1. ADD all 17 identified tools - they have clear experimental usage with versions/vendors
    2. IMPLEMENT suggested patterns to capture bioinformatics tools (BWA, GATK, MuTect, Annovar)
    3. IMPROVE reagent detection for commercial kits with version numbers and vendor info
    4. ENHANCE software detection patterns for analysis tools with vendor information
    5. REVIEW mining algorithm - this level of failure suggests systematic issues
    
    All identified tools should be added as they represent genuine research tools with clear experimental usage.
    The observations extracted demonstrate the tools' practical applications and limitations in the research context.
