    Clinical Study → clinical assessment tools, possibly computational tools for analysis
    
    This publication specifically describes the testing and validation of the Distress Thermometer (DT) 
    and accompanying symptom checklist in pediatric NF1 patients. These are validated clinical assessment 
    tools that should be captured as research tools. The study involves 80 youth participants and evaluates 
    the usability, acceptability, and concordance of these assessment instruments.
    
    Expected tool types:
    - Clinical assessment tools (Distress Thermometer, symptom checklist)
    - Possibly computational tools for statistical analysis (though not explicitly mentioned)
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a clinical validation study that tests psychosocial screening tools in pediatric NF1 patients.
    The study clearly uses and evaluates clinical assessment tools (Distress Thermometer and symptom checklist)
    which are legitimate research instruments that should be captured. The absence of these tools in the mining
    results represents a significant gap, as clinical assessment tools are valid research tools even without
    traditional laboratory methods sections.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Significant gap in clinical assessment tool detection: Two clear clinical assessment tools were missed
    - The Distress Thermometer is a well-established, validated psychosocial screening instrument
    - The accompanying symptom checklist is also a legitimate clinical assessment tool
    - Current mining patterns appear inadequate for detecting clinical assessment tools in psychosocial studies
    - This represents a systematic issue where clinical validation studies are not properly capturing their primary research instruments
  recommendations: |
    This publication should have captured at least 2 clinical assessment tools:
    1. Distress Thermometer (DT) - a validated psychosocial screening tool
    2. Symptom checklist - an accompanying assessment instrument
    
    Both tools are clearly described as being tested for usability, acceptability, and clinical utility in pediatric NF1 patients.
    This is a clinical validation study where the assessment tools themselves are the primary research instruments.
    
    The mining patterns need significant improvement for clinical assessment tools, particularly:
    - Psychosocial screening instruments
    - Symptom assessment checklists
    - Patient-reported outcome measures
    - Clinical validation contexts
    
    This case highlights the need for better coverage of clinical research tools beyond traditional laboratory instruments.
    The suggested patterns should help capture similar clinical assessment tools in future mining efforts.
