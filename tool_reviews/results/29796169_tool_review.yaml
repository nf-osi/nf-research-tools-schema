  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on the publication focus on ATRX protein expression in neurofibromatosis-associated malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors:
    - Antibodies (primary: anti-ATRX antibodies for immunohistochemistry/Western blot)
    - Cell lines (MPNST cell lines, potentially NF1-deficient lines)
    - Animal models (potentially NF1 knockout or xenograft models)
    - Computational tools (image analysis software, statistical analysis packages)
    - Clinical assessment tools (potentially tumor grading systems or pathological scoring)
    
    Protein expression studies in cancer research typically require multiple tool types across categories.
    The absence of mined tools suggests either: (1) tools were mentioned using non-standard terminology,
    (2) methods were described generically without specific tool names, or (3) the mining patterns
    missed domain-specific terminology common in neurofibromatosis research.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication focuses on ATRX protein expression in neurofibromatosis-associated malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors,
    which strongly suggests laboratory-based research involving protein analysis techniques. Such studies typically require
    antibodies for detection, tissue samples or cell lines for analysis, and computational tools for data analysis.
    The absence of mined tools is surprising and may indicate gaps in the mining patterns for this research domain.

    pattern: "anti-[A-Z0-9]+ antibody|[A-Z0-9]+ antibody"

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Input file is completely empty (0 bytes, 0 lines) - no publication data available
    - Cannot perform tool validation without publication content (abstract, methods, results, discussion)
    - No tools were mined because there is no source text to mine from
    - File should contain publication metadata and full text for PMID: 29796169
    - This represents a complete failure of the data pipeline for this publication
  recommendations: |
    - URGENT: Fix data pipeline issue - input file must be populated with publication content
    - Cannot validate tools or extract observations without source text
    - Recommend investigating why publication data was not loaded into the input file
    - Once file is populated, re-run tool validation analysis
    - For ATRX protein expression studies, expect to find: antibodies, cell lines, computational tools
    - This publication should be flagged for manual data collection and re-processing
    - System should validate input file completeness before tool validation workflow
