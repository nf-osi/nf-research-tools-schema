    This is a laboratory research study examining ATRX protein expression in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) using immunohistochemistry. Expected tools include:
    - Antibodies (for immunohistochemistry)
    - Computational tools (for statistical analysis)
    - Potentially tissue microarrays as research tools
    - Patient databases as data sources
    
    The study involves experimental procedures (IHC staining, microscopy, statistical analysis) indicating active tool usage rather than just citations.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study with extensive methods describing immunohistochemical analysis of tumor samples. The publication clearly uses research tools including antibodies, statistical software, and tissue microarrays. Tools are expected and likely present based on the experimental design involving protein expression analysis, microscopy, and statistical evaluation of clinical outcomes.

      ATRX protein expression patterns in MPNSTs showed three distinct categories: retained (81-100%), mosaic (21-80%), and complete loss (0-20%). 57% (43/74) of MPNSTs showed aberrant ATRX expression (mosaic or loss) compared to only 7% (2/30) of plexiform and atypical neurofibromas (p < 0.0001, Fisher's Exact Test). The antibody successfully differentiated between malignant and pre-malignant lesions.

      In NF1-associated MPNSTs, aberrant ATRX expression was significantly associated with worse overall survival (p = 0.0276, log rank test). In multivariate analysis, aberrant ATRX expression was an independent poor prognostic factor with hazard ratio of 5.3 (95%CI: 1.367-20.433). No survival difference was observed in sporadic MPNSTs based on ATRX status.

    contextSnippet: "we did observe a statistically significant decrease in OS for patients with NF1-MPNSTs who have aberrant ATRX expression (Figure 4B, p = 0.0276, log rank test)... aberrant ATRX expression was found to be an independent poor prognostic factor with a hazard ratio of 5.3"

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining completely missed several clear research tools despite detailed methods section
    - ATRX antibody with full vendor/catalog information was not detected
    - Statistical software with version numbers were not captured
    - Tissue microarray as a research reagent was overlooked
    - Mining patterns appear insufficient for detecting antibodies with vendor information and computational tools in statistical analysis context
  recommendations: |
    All 4 potentially missed tools should be added to the database:
    1. ATRX antibody (Sigma, HPA001906) - clear experimental usage with detailed specifications
    2. SAS version 9.4 - statistical analysis software with version specified
    3. GraphPad Prism Version 7.03 - statistical software for specific analyses
    4. Tissue microarray - research reagent used for systematic tumor analysis
    
    The mining patterns need significant improvement to capture:
    - Antibodies with vendor/catalog information in immunohistochemistry context
    - Statistical software mentioned in methods with version numbers
    - Tissue microarrays and other specialized research reagents
    
    5 scientific observations were successfully extracted, primarily focusing on ATRX expression patterns, survival outcomes, and tool usage protocols. The observations provide valuable insights into tool performance and experimental findings.
