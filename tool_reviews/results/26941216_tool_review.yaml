  hasMethodsSection: Yes
  likelyContainsTools: Yes
  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a methodology/protocol paper focused on developing patient-reported outcome measures and core outcome sets for pediatric patients. Expected tool types include:
    - Clinical assessment tools: questionnaires, scales, outcome measures (Wong-Baker scale, Likert scales, PROMs)
    - Computational tools: qualitative analysis software (NVivo), data management tools (Microsoft Excel), survey platforms (eDelphi)
    
    The publication describes both methodological considerations for PRO development (abstract) and a specific protocol for developing a Core Outcome Set for pediatric brain tumor surgery (methods section). This dual focus suggests it may contain multiple types of assessment and analysis tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication is primarily a methodology/protocol paper that would be expected to contain clinical assessment tools and computational analysis tools. The abstract focuses on qualitative research methods for developing patient-reported outcome measures, while the methods section describes a detailed protocol for developing a Core Outcome Set using various assessment instruments and analysis software. Clinical assessment tools (scales, questionnaires) and computational tools (analysis software, survey platforms) are highly expected in this type of research.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined from this publication, but several clinical assessment tools and computational tools were missed
    - The publication has a dual focus: methodological considerations for PRO development (abstract) and a specific COS development protocol (methods)
    - The mining system appears to have missed several legitimate assessment tools and analysis software mentioned in the methodology
    - This type of methodology/protocol paper commonly contains assessment instruments and analysis tools that should be captured
  recommendations: |
    - Add the missed clinical assessment tools (Wong-Baker scale, Likert scale, eDelphi survey, semi-structured interviews) as they are legitimate research instruments
    - Add the computational tools (NVivo) as it's specifically mentioned for qualitative data analysis
    - Consider adding Microsoft Excel with lower confidence as it's mentioned for data management
    - Implement the suggested patterns to improve capture of assessment scales, survey methodologies, and qualitative analysis software
    - This publication demonstrates that methodology/protocol papers can contain valuable research tools that current mining patterns may miss
    - The mining system should be enhanced to better capture clinical assessment methodologies and qualitative research tools
