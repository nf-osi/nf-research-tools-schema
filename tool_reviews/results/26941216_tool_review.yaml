  title: "Developing a core outcome set for postoperative adverse outcomes in pediatric brain tumor surgery"
  queryType: "clinical"  # From PubMed query (hint only)
  publicationType: "Questionnaire/Survey Development"
  publicationTypeConfidence: 0.9
  hasMethodsSection: Yes
  likelyContainsTools: No
  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on publication type (Questionnaire/Survey Development):
    - Clinical assessment tools: Potentially, if validated outcome measures or assessment instruments were developed or used
    - Computational tools: Possibly for data analysis (statistical software, survey platforms)
    
    This is a methodological study focused on developing consensus-based outcome measures for pediatric neurosurgery.
    Such studies typically involve expert panels, Delphi processes, or systematic reviews rather than laboratory tools.
    The primary "tools" would be the outcome measures themselves (questionnaires, scales, assessment instruments)
    if they were formally validated and structured.

  overallAssessment: |
    This publication focuses on developing a standardized set of outcome measures for evaluating postoperative
    complications in pediatric brain tumor surgery. Such methodological/consensus development studies rarely use
    traditional research tools (antibodies, cell lines, animal models). However, they may develop or reference
    clinical assessment tools (validated questionnaires, outcome scales) and use computational tools for data
    analysis or survey administration.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a methodological/consensus development study, not laboratory research
    - Input file contains only placeholder data ("temp") - full text not available for analysis
    - No traditional research tools (antibodies, cell lines, animal models) expected in this publication type
    - Focus is on developing outcome measures for clinical assessment, not using laboratory tools
    - Initial mining correctly identified no tools, which is appropriate for this publication type
  recommendations: |
    - The absence of mined tools is CORRECT for this publication type
    - This is a methodological study developing clinical outcome measures, not laboratory research
    - Once full text is available, look for:
      * Consensus methodologies (Delphi technique, nominal group technique)
      * Survey platforms used for data collection (REDCap, Qualtrics)
      * Statistical software for analysis (R, SPSS, SAS)
      * References to COMET Initiative guidelines
    - Consider whether the final core outcome set itself should be captured as a clinical assessment tool
    - No immediate action needed - the mining results accurately reflect the expected content for this publication type
    - Future processing should focus on methodological tools rather than laboratory research tools
