    This is a narrative review focusing on AI applications in NF1-associated glial tumors. While it has a Methods section, this describes the review methodology (search strategy, inclusion/exclusion criteria) rather than experimental procedures. Review articles typically cite tools from other studies but don't use them directly for new experiments.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a narrative review article examining AI applications in NF1-associated glial tumors, not a primary research study. The Methods section describes literature search methodology rather than experimental procedures. While the review may discuss AI tools and datasets used in other studies, it's unlikely to contain actual research tools being used or developed by the authors themselves.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a narrative review article, not primary research
    - Methods section describes literature search methodology, not experimental procedures
    - No Results or Discussion sections available for analysis
    - Abstract indicates focus on reviewing AI methods rather than using/developing tools
    - All potentially missed tools are search databases/repositories used for literature review
  recommendations: |
    This publication should likely be excluded from tool mining as it's a narrative review examining AI applications in NF1 research rather than a primary study using research tools. The potentially missed tools (PubMed, Google Scholar, SYNAPSE, CTF data portal, BioArchives) are literature search resources rather than research tools. However, SYNAPSE and CTF data portal might be worth considering as they could be NF-specific data resources. The lack of Results/Discussion sections prevents extraction of scientific observations. Future mining should consider excluding narrative reviews unless they specifically develop new tools or provide comprehensive tool comparisons.
