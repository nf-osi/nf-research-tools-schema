  expectedToolTypes: |
    Review Article → Typically does NOT contain actual research tools used by authors.
    Review articles cite and discuss tools used in OTHER studies but do not use tools themselves.
    
    However, this specific review focuses on "AI-based tools" which could potentially include:
    - Computational tools (AI software, algorithms, platforms) if the authors developed or tested them
    - Clinical assessment tools if reviewing diagnostic/assessment applications
    
    But based on the methods section describing a "narrative review" with database searches,
    this appears to be a literature review that discusses tools rather than using them.
    
    Expected: Likely no actual research tools used by the authors themselves.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a narrative review article about AI applications in NF1-associated glial tumors.
    The methods describe a literature search and review methodology, not experimental procedures.
    Review articles typically cite and discuss tools from other studies but do not use research tools themselves.
    While the review focuses on "AI-based tools," these are discussed as subjects of review rather than tools used by the authors.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a narrative review article, not experimental research
    - No experimental tools were mined (correctly - review articles don't use research tools)
    - Methods section describes literature search methodology, not lab procedures
    - Limited text available (no Introduction, Results, or Discussion sections)
    - Query type "bench" is misleading - this is not bench research
  recommendations: |
    This publication was correctly identified as having no research tools. It is a narrative review
    that discusses AI applications in NF1 research but does not use experimental tools itself.
    
    The potentially missed tools (PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, SYNAPSE) are debatable - they are
    computational platforms used for literature search methodology rather than research tools in the
    traditional sense. These could be added if the mining scope includes research methodology tools.
    
    The query type "bench" appears to be incorrect for this publication - it should be classified
    as a review article. This suggests the PubMed query may need refinement to better distinguish
    between experimental research and review articles.
    
    No observations can be extracted since no tools were validated and no Results/Discussion sections
    are available.
