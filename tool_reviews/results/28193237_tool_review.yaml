    Based on publication type (Questionnaire/Survey Development):
    - Clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, scales, outcome measures) - PRIMARY EXPECTED
    - Computational tools for statistical analysis - SECONDARY (analysis software)
    
    This study develops and validates the INF1-QOL questionnaire and uses EuroQol for validation.
    Clinical assessment tools are the primary focus, with statistical analysis tools as secondary.
    No lab research tools (antibodies, cell lines, animal models) are expected in this type of study.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a questionnaire development and validation study that should contain clinical assessment tools.
    The study develops the INF1-QOL questionnaire and validates it against EuroQol, representing genuine
    clinical assessment tools. Statistical analysis methods are mentioned but represent analytical approaches
    rather than discrete research tools. This publication type typically contains validated clinical instruments.

      INF1-QOL showed good internal reliability (Cronbach's alpha 0.87) and was easy and quick to complete within ten minutes.
      The questionnaire comprises 14 items rated from zero to three, with maximum potential score of 42 where highest score denotes worst function.
      Mean total INF1-QOL score was 8.64 (SD 6.3), median 7.00, range 0-30. No significant correlations with age or gender were found.

      The highest impact on quality of life was moderate or severe problems with anxiety and depression (32%) and negative effects of NF1 on role and outlook on life (42%).
      INF1-QOL correlated highly with EuroQol (r = 0.82, p < 0.0001) and moderately with clinical severity (r = 0.34, p < 0.05).
      The questionnaire covers a broad range of themes representative of NF1 manifestations and will be useful in clinical practice and clinical trials.

      Clinical severity was assessed using Riccardi NF severity grade classification (1-4 scale). Grades 1 and 2 were combined as mild, grade 3 as moderate, and grade 4 as severe.
      Mean inter-rater reliability for grading clinical severity scores was 0.71 (range 0.65-0.79), with intra-class correlation of 0.92.
      Mean clinical severity score was 1.95 (SD 0.65). Distribution: 17 (34%) mild, 16 (32%) moderate, 17 (34%) severe disease.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Mining completely missed all clinical assessment tools in this questionnaire development study
    - No tools were detected despite this being a clinical study focused on tool development and validation
    - Three major clinical assessment tools were present but not captured: INF1-QOL (primary tool), EuroQol (validation tool), and Riccardi severity classification
    - Current mining patterns appear inadequate for detecting clinical assessment tools, particularly questionnaires and scales
  recommendations: |
    This publication represents a significant gap in clinical assessment tool mining. All tools should be added:
    
    1. INF1-QOL questionnaire - Primary tool being developed and validated
    2. EuroQol (EQ-5D) - Standard validation tool used for comparison
    3. Riccardi NF severity grade classification - Clinical severity assessment scale
    
    The mining patterns need substantial improvement for clinical assessment tools, particularly:
    - Better detection of questionnaire development contexts
    - Recognition of validation study designs
    - Improved pattern matching for clinical scale nomenclature
    - Enhanced context analysis for tool administration phrases
    
    This study provides excellent examples of clinical assessment tool usage and validation that should inform
    pattern development. The observations extracted demonstrate the rich scientific content available when
    tools are properly identified in clinical studies.
