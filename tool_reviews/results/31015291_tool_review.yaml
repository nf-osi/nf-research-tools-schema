    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a molecular biology study using proximity biotinylation to identify protein interactions.
    Expected tools include cell lines, antibodies, plasmids/genetic reagents, and computational tools
    for mass spectrometry analysis and data processing.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study investigating protein-protein interactions using proximity biotinylation
    and mass spectrometry. The extensive Methods section describes cell culture, molecular cloning, protein
    purification, and biochemical assays, indicating heavy use of research tools. Multiple tool types are
    expected including cell lines, antibodies, plasmids, and computational analysis tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a methods-heavy laboratory research publication
    - Multiple clear research tools present in Methods section were missed by mining patterns
    - Cell lines, antibodies, plasmids, and computational tools all present but not captured
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous legitimate research tools that were completely missed by
    the initial mining. The Methods section is extensive and describes multiple experimental
    approaches requiring various reagents. All 9 potentially missed tools should be added as
    they represent genuine research tools with clear experimental usage context. The suggested
    patterns would significantly improve capture of similar tools in future mining efforts.
    No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated.
