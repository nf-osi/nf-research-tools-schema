    This publication is a comprehensive laboratory research study investigating KRAS mutations using:
    - Cell line models (MOLM-13, 293T)
    - Genetic engineering (CRISPR/Cas9, plasmids)
    - Protein biochemistry (antibodies for Western blotting)
    - Structural biology (crystallography)
    - Computational analysis (data processing software)
    
    Expected to contain multiple tool types across cell lines, genetic reagents, antibodies, and computational tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a high-quality laboratory research study that extensively uses research tools across multiple categories.
    The comprehensive Methods section describes detailed experimental procedures including cell culture, genetic engineering,
    protein analysis, and structural biology. Tools are essential for this type of mechanistic study of KRAS function.

      MOLM-13 cells are dependent on oncogenic FLT3 signaling for survival and proliferation.
      Treatment with AC220 (FLT3 inhibitor) at 10 nM suppressed ERK phosphorylation and induced apoptosis.
      Cells expressing K-Ras G12D showed enhanced survival upon AC220 treatment with reduced cleaved caspase-3 positive cells.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: No tools were mined from this publication despite it being a comprehensive laboratory research study
    - The publication contains extensive experimental methods with clear tool usage across multiple categories
    - At least 16 research tools were missed including cell lines, antibodies, genetic reagents, and computational tools
    - All missed tools have clear vendor information, catalog numbers, or standard naming conventions
    - This represents a significant failure in the mining algorithm for this publication type
  recommendations: |
    - ALL 16 identified tools should be added to the database - they represent genuine research tools with proper documentation
    - The mining patterns need significant improvement to catch standard laboratory tools
    - Focus on vendor names (DSMZ, Addgene, CST, BD, Takara Bio, Thermo Fisher) as strong tool indicators
    - Plasmid naming conventions (p[Name]) and antibody patterns (anti-[target], clone information) need better coverage
    - Cell line names with vendor information should be reliably detected
    - Computational tools with version numbers (GraphPad Prism 8) and specialized software (MOSFLM, SCALA, CCP4) need patterns
    - This publication demonstrates the need for comprehensive pattern coverage across all tool types
    - The 5 observations extracted show good scientific content linking tools to experimental findings
