  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on the publication type (Lab Research) focusing on K-Ras T50I mutations and Raf activation,
    this study would be expected to contain multiple tool types:
    - Genetic reagents (K-Ras mutant constructs, plasmids, vectors)
    - Cell lines (likely cancer cell lines or engineered cell lines)
    - Antibodies (for K-Ras, Raf, phospho-proteins, signaling pathway components)
    - Computational tools (for sequence analysis, structural modeling, data analysis)
    - Animal models (potentially mouse models with K-Ras mutations)
    
    Molecular biology studies of oncogene mutations typically require extensive tool usage
    for protein expression, functional assays, and pathway analysis.
  overallAssessment: |
    This appears to be a laboratory research study investigating K-Ras T50I mutations and their
    effects on Raf activation, which is a fundamental topic in cancer biology and cell signaling.
    Such studies typically require extensive use of research tools including genetic constructs,
    cell lines, antibodies, and analytical software. The absence of mined tools suggests either
    incomplete mining or that this may be a review/computational study rather than experimental work.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Zero tools were mined from a laboratory research publication about K-Ras mutations
    - This suggests significant gaps in mining patterns for molecular biology tools
    - Oncogene research typically involves extensive tool usage that appears to be missed
    - May indicate need for better recognition of genetic constructs and mutant proteins
  recommendations: |
    This publication represents a significant mining failure - a molecular biology study about
    K-Ras mutations should contain numerous research tools. Key recommendations:
    
    1. IMMEDIATE REVIEW NEEDED: Manually examine the full text to identify missed tools
    2. PATTERN ENHANCEMENT: Add patterns for oncogene mutations, kinase assays, and engineered cell lines
    3. GENETIC REAGENT FOCUS: Improve recognition of mutant constructs and expression vectors
    4. ASSAY DETECTION: Better capture of biochemical and functional assays as computational tools
    5. CELL LINE RECOGNITION: Enhance detection of engineered/transfected cell lines
    
    The absence of any mined tools from this type of study indicates systematic mining issues
    that need immediate attention to improve coverage of molecular biology research tools.
