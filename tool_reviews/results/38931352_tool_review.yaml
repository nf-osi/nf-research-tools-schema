  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Complete failure of tool mining - 9 clear research tools were missed
    - Animal model with complex multi-gene nomenclature not detected
    - Multiple antibodies with vendor/dilution information not captured
    - PCR primers with sequences not identified as genetic reagents
    - Computational tools with version numbers not detected
    - No tools were initially mined despite extensive tool usage in methods
  recommendations: |
    This publication represents a significant mining failure with 9 clear research tools completely missed.
    The tools include:
    - 1 animal model (triple mutant mice from Jackson Laboratory)
    - 2 computational tools (ChemStation, VivoQuant with versions)
    - 3 antibodies (IDO, AHR, TDO2 with vendors and dilutions)
    - 3 genetic reagents (PCR primer sets for genotyping)
    
    All missed tools should be added to the database. The suggested patterns would significantly improve
    detection of similar tools in future mining. This case highlights the need for better patterns
    covering multi-gene animal models, versioned software, antibodies with experimental details,
    and PCR primers with sequences.
    
    No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated, but the publication
    contains extensive experimental data that would yield valuable observations once tools are properly identified.
