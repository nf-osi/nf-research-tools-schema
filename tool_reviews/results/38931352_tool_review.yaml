    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a preclinical imaging study involving radiotracer development, animal models, PET imaging, and immunohistochemistry.
    Expected tools include: animal models (NF1 mice), computational tools (imaging software), antibodies (for IHC), 
    and potentially genetic reagents (genotyping primers).
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study involving radiotracer development and preclinical PET imaging in NF1 mouse models.
    The study includes radiosynthesis, biodistribution studies, PET imaging, and immunohistochemistry, indicating high likelihood
    of research tool usage including animal models, imaging software, antibodies, and laboratory reagents.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a clear laboratory research study
    - Multiple research tools are clearly present in the methods section including animal models, software, antibodies, and genetic reagents
    - The mining system appears to have missed standard research tools that should have been detected
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains multiple legitimate research tools that were completely missed by the initial mining:
    - A genetically modified mouse model (Trp53, Nf1, Suz12 triple mutant) should definitely be added
    - Two imaging/analysis software tools with version numbers should be added
    - Three specific antibodies with vendor information should be added
    - PCR primers for genotyping should be added as genetic reagents
    The suggested patterns would help capture similar tools in future NF research publications.
    No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated, but this publication likely contains
    valuable phenotypic and methodological observations that could be extracted after tool validation.
