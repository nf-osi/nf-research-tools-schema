  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining failed to capture any tools despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple categories of tools were missed: animal models, cell lines, antibodies, genetic reagents, computational tools
    - Standard research tools like NOD/SCID mice, MPNST cell lines, and common antibodies were not detected
    - Vendor information format (Tool Name (Vendor)) not recognized by current patterns
    - Small molecule inhibitors and genetic reagents (siRNA, shRNA) not captured
    - Analysis software with version numbers not detected
  recommendations: |
    This publication should have yielded numerous validated tools across multiple categories. The mining patterns
    need significant improvement to capture: 1) MPNST-specific cell lines with numeric naming, 2) antibodies
    listed with vendor information, 3) standard mouse strains like NOD/SCID, 4) genetic reagents including
    siRNA/shRNA constructs and small molecule inhibitors, 5) analysis software with version numbers.
    All 28 potentially missed tools should be manually reviewed for addition to the database.
    The suggested patterns would significantly improve future mining accuracy for similar publications.
