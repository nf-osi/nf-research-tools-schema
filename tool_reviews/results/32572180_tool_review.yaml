  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is an epidemiological study analyzing long-term outcomes in childhood cancer survivors using the 
    Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) cohort. Expected tool types include:
    - Clinical assessment tools: Multiple validated questionnaires and scales for measuring psychosocial, 
      neurocognitive, and socioeconomic outcomes (BSI-18, BPI, CCSS Neurocognitive Questionnaire, ADL/IADL scales)
    - Computational tools: Statistical analysis software (SAS, R) for data analysis
    - Classification systems: CTCAE v4.0 for grading chronic health conditions, ICD-9/ICD-10 for mortality coding
    
    This study would NOT typically contain lab research tools (antibodies, cell lines, animal models) as it is 
    a retrospective cohort analysis using questionnaire data and medical records.
  overallAssessment: |
    This epidemiological study would be expected to contain clinical assessment tools for measuring patient outcomes
    and computational tools for statistical analysis. The study uses multiple validated questionnaires to assess
    psychosocial, neurocognitive, and functional outcomes in cancer survivors, which are legitimate research tools.
    Statistical software tools are also research tools when used for data analysis in scientific studies.

      The CCSS Neurocognitive Questionnaire includes subscales measuring task efficiency, emotional regulation,

      neurocognitive impairment, including executive dysfunction. Glioma survivors with NF1 had significantly 
      increased risk of impairment in all neurocognitive domains compared to siblings, and increased risk of

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were mined from this publication despite containing multiple validated clinical assessment tools
    - Mining system failed to detect clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, scales, classification systems)
    - Mining system failed to detect computational tools (statistical software with versions)
    - This represents a significant gap in clinical assessment tool detection capabilities
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains multiple legitimate research tools that were completely missed by the mining system:
    - 6 clinical assessment tools (BSI-18, BPI, CCSS Neurocognitive Questionnaire, CTCAE v4.0, ADL, IADL)
    - 2 computational tools (SAS version 9.4, R version 3.5.0)
    - 3 classification/database systems (NDI, ICD-9, ICD-10)
    
    All of these tools should be added to improve mining coverage for epidemiological and clinical studies.
    The suggested patterns would significantly improve detection of clinical assessment tools and computational tools.
    
    This case demonstrates that the mining system has poor coverage for clinical research tools, focusing too heavily
    on laboratory research tools. Clinical studies are a major source of research tools and should be better supported.
    
    The observations extracted show how these tools were used and their effectiveness in detecting differences between
    study populations, providing valuable scientific insights about tool performance in NF1 research.
