    This is a molecular biology/genomics study developing a targeted RNAseq method for detecting pathogenic 
    NF1 splicing variants. Expected tools include:
    - Computational tools (STAR mapper, QURNAs pipeline, bioinformatics software)
    - Genetic reagents (primers, probes, enrichment kits)
    - Cell culture reagents and protocols
    - Laboratory equipment and consumables
    
    The study involves RNA extraction, targeted sequencing, computational analysis, and method validation
    across multiple patient cohorts, indicating extensive use of research tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a clear laboratory research study with extensive methods describing RNA extraction, targeted 
    sequencing, and computational analysis. The publication should contain multiple research tools including 
    computational software, genetic reagents, and laboratory protocols. The complete absence of mined tools 
    (0 tools found) indicates a significant failure in the mining process, as the methods section clearly 
    describes numerous research tools and reagents.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Complete mining failure - 0 tools detected despite extensive methods section
    - Publication contains detailed laboratory methods with multiple computational tools, genetic reagents, and protocols
    - Methods section describes RNA extraction, targeted sequencing, bioinformatics analysis, and validation studies
    - At least 10 clear research tools were missed including custom software (QURNAs), standard bioinformatics tools (STAR, Picard, IGV, Alamut), sequencing instruments (NextSeq500), and commercial kits (NuGEN, Agilent, Qiagen)
    - Mining patterns appear inadequate for detecting bioinformatics tools and commercial reagents
  recommendations: |
    - ALL 10 identified tools should be added to the database as they represent genuine research tools
    - Implement suggested patterns to improve detection of bioinformatics software, sequencing instruments, and commercial kits
    - Review mining patterns for computational tools - many standard bioinformatics tools were missed
    - Add vendor-based patterns for commercial reagents (NuGEN, Agilent, Qiagen, etc.)
    - Include GitHub URL patterns for open-source bioinformatics tools
    - This publication demonstrates significant gaps in current mining capabilities for genomics/bioinformatics studies
    - No observations extracted as this requires validated tools first - should be revisited after tools are properly mined
