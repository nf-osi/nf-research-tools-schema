    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a comprehensive molecular biology study involving:
    - Primary cell culture (Schwann cells from patients)
    - Multiple cell lines (MPNST lines)
    - Gene expression profiling with microarrays
    - Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting
    - Viral transduction experiments
    - Computational analysis of genomic data
    Expected tools: antibodies, cell lines, genetic reagents (viral vectors), computational tools
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive lab research study combining genomics, cell biology, and molecular techniques.
    The extensive Methods section describes multiple experimental approaches requiring various research tools.
    Clinical assessment tools are unlikely given the focus on molecular mechanisms rather than patient outcomes.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining failed to capture any tools despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple categories of tools were missed: cell lines, antibodies, genetic reagents, computational tools
    - Standard nomenclature for MPNST cell lines not recognized
    - Antibodies with vendor information not captured
    - Viral vectors (lentiviral, adenoviral) not identified as genetic reagents
    - Microarray platforms and analysis software not recognized as computational tools
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    All 20 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine research tools used in experiments.
    The suggested patterns would significantly improve capture of similar tools in future NF research publications.
    No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated, but this study likely contains valuable phenotypic data about SOX9 function.
    Manual curator review is essential to validate the extensive tool usage described in the Methods section.
