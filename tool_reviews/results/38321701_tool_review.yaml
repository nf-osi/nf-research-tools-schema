    This is a questionnaire/survey development study that systematically evaluates patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for tinnitus assessment in NF2 patients. Expected tools include:
    - Clinical assessment tools (validated questionnaires, scales, PROMs)
    - Computational tools (for systematic review, scoring, analysis)
    
    This study type focuses on identifying and validating clinical assessment instruments rather than laboratory research tools. The methods involve systematic evaluation of existing questionnaires using standardized rating procedures.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication is highly likely to contain clinical assessment tools as it systematically evaluates 16 patient-reported outcome measures for tinnitus assessment. The study uses the PRO-RATE evaluation framework to compare questionnaires, making clinical assessment tools the primary expected tool type. While no traditional lab methods are present, this represents valid tool development/validation work in the clinical domain.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a tool evaluation study
    - The mining system missed several important clinical assessment tools that are central to this publication
    - This represents a systematic gap in mining clinical assessment tools from questionnaire development studies
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains multiple valid clinical assessment tools that were completely missed by the initial mining:
    - The Tinnitus Functional Index is the primary tool recommended by the study
    - PRO-RATE is the evaluation framework used to assess tools
    - Several other tinnitus questionnaires are mentioned and evaluated
    The mining patterns need significant enhancement for clinical assessment tools, particularly validated questionnaires and patient-reported outcome measures. This type of publication (systematic evaluation of clinical tools) should be a high-yield source for clinical assessment tools but was completely missed.
