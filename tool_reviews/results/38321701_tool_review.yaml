  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a questionnaire/survey development study that systematically evaluates patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) 
    for tinnitus assessment in NF2 patients. Expected tool types:
    - Clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, scales, outcome measures) - PRIMARY FOCUS
    - Computational tools (possibly for analysis, though not explicitly mentioned)
    
    The study specifically mentions evaluating 19 patient-reported outcome measures, with 16 undergoing formal review.
    These are legitimate clinical assessment tools that should have been captured by mining algorithms.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication is highly likely to contain clinical assessment tools as it is specifically focused on evaluating 
    and recommending patient-reported outcome measures for tinnitus in NF2 clinical trials. The study systematically 
    reviewed 19 PROMs and formally evaluated 16 using standardized criteria. The absence of mined tools represents 
    a significant mining failure, as multiple validated clinical assessment instruments are explicitly discussed.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL MINING FAILURE: This publication is entirely focused on clinical assessment tools (patient-reported outcome measures) 
      but zero tools were mined, representing a complete failure of the mining algorithm for this publication type
    - The study explicitly discusses 19 patient-reported outcome measures and formally evaluates 16 of them
    - Primary recommendation (Tinnitus Functional Index) was completely missed
    - Evaluation methodology tool (PRO-RATE) was missed
    - Generic terms like "patient-reported outcome measures" and "questionnaire" should trigger clinical assessment tool detection
  recommendations: |
    - ALL 4 potentially missed tools should be added to the database as they represent legitimate clinical assessment instruments
    - Mining patterns urgently need improvement for clinical assessment tools, particularly:
      * Specific instrument names (Tinnitus Functional Index, PRO-RATE)
      * Generic terms that indicate presence of assessment tools (PROM, questionnaire, scale)
      * Context phrases around clinical evaluation and outcome measurement
    - This publication demonstrates that clinical assessment tool mining is severely underdeveloped
    - No observations were extracted as this is a methodology/recommendation paper rather than an experimental study
    - Future mining should specifically target publications with "patient-reported outcome", "questionnaire", "assessment", and "clinical trial" terminology
