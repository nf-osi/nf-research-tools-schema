  likelyContainsTools: No
  expectedToolTypes: |
    Review Article → Typically does not contain actual research tools used by the authors.
    Review articles discuss and cite tools from other studies but do not report original experimental work.
    
    Expected tool types for this publication type:
    - None for direct experimental usage
    - Possibly computational tools mentioned in the context of reviewing bioinformatics approaches
    - Genetic reagents (antisense oligonucleotides) discussed conceptually but not as specific experimental tools
    
    Note: While the publication discusses antisense oligonucleotides as therapeutic tools, this is a review
    of the field rather than original research reporting specific oligonucleotide sequences, experimental
    protocols, or tool development.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a review article discussing the use of antisense oligonucleotides for correcting splicing defects
    in neurogenetic diseases. Review articles typically cite and discuss tools from other studies but do not
    report original experimental work or tool usage by the authors. The absence of Methods, Results, and
    Discussion sections confirms this is not an experimental study that would contain research tools.

    whyMissed: "Generic term 'antisense oligonucleotides' mentioned conceptually in review context, not as specific experimental reagents"

suggestedPatterns:
  - patternType: "context_phrase"
    pattern: "In this review, we discuss"
    toolType: "general"
    examples: ["In this review, we discuss the use of antisense oligonucleotides"]
    reasoning: "This phrase strongly indicates review article context where tools are discussed conceptually rather than used experimentally. Could help filter out false positives from review articles."
  - patternType: "context_phrase"
    pattern: "progress has been made towards clinical trials"
    toolType: "general"
    examples: ["progress has been made towards clinical trials"]
    reasoning: "This phrase indicates discussion of therapeutic development rather than current tool usage, typical of review articles discussing field progress."

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a review article, not original experimental research
    - No Methods section indicating this is not a lab study
    - Abstract language ("In this review, we discuss") clearly indicates review format
    - No full text sections available beyond abstract
    - Tools mentioned are discussed conceptually, not used experimentally
  recommendations: |
    This publication should not contribute any research tools to the database. It is a review article
    that discusses antisense oligonucleotides conceptually rather than reporting specific experimental
    tools or protocols. The mining correctly identified zero tools from this publication.
    
    Recommendations:
    - No tools should be added from this publication
    - The suggested patterns could help identify similar review articles in future mining
    - Review articles like this should be filtered out early in the mining pipeline
    - Focus mining efforts on experimental papers with Methods sections
    - Consider adding publication type classification to pre-filter review articles
