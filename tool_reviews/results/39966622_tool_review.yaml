    Bioinformatics Analysis → computational tools (software, pipelines, AI/ML models)
    This study develops an AI tool for medical image segmentation, so computational tools are expected.
    Clinical assessment tools are unlikely as this is a technical development study.
    Lab research tools are not expected as this is image analysis, not wet lab work.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a bioinformatics/AI development study focused on creating an automated segmentation tool for vestibular schwannomas in MRI images. The study involves computational tool development, image processing software usage, and AI/ML model training. Computational tools are highly expected, while traditional lab research tools (antibodies, cell lines) are not relevant to this image analysis work.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining failed to capture any tools despite this being a computational tool development study
    - Three clear computational tools were missed: Simpleware ScanIP (commercial software), DPP V1.0 (the main AI tool being developed), and DICE score (evaluation metric)
    - Mining patterns need improvement for image processing software and AI/ML tools with version numbers
  recommendations: |
    All three potentially missed tools should be added as they are legitimate computational tools used in this bioinformatics study.
    Simpleware ScanIP is commercial image processing software, DPP V1.0 is the main AI tool being developed, and DICE score is a standard evaluation metric.
    The suggested patterns would help capture similar tools in future mining.
    The observations extracted provide valuable performance metrics and usage information for these computational tools.
