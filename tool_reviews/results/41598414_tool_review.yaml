    Clinical Study → clinical assessment tools, possibly computational tools for analysis
    This study uses imaging technology (DG-HFUS device) and analysis software (SkinAid) to evaluate neurofibromas in NF1 patients. Expected tools include:
    - Medical devices/imaging equipment (DG-HFUS system)
    - Computational tools for image analysis (SkinAid software)
    - Potentially clinical assessment tools for patient evaluation
    - No lab research tools expected (antibodies, cell lines, animal models) as this is clinical imaging study
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a clinical imaging study evaluating a dermoscopy-guided high-frequency ultrasound system for NF1 neurofibroma assessment. The study would typically use medical devices, imaging equipment, and computational analysis tools. Clinical assessment tools for patient outcomes may also be present. No laboratory research tools are expected given the clinical nature of the study.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining failed to detect any tools despite clear presence of medical devices and software
    - Clinical imaging devices and analysis software not captured by current patterns
    - Diagnostic criteria as clinical assessment tools not recognized
    - No Results or Discussion sections available to extract scientific observations
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains legitimate research tools that were missed by initial mining:
    1. Dermus SkinScanner - specialized medical imaging device with computational capabilities
    2. SkinAid cloud software - image analysis software for clinical data
    3. Legius criteria - validated clinical diagnostic assessment tool
    All three should be added as they represent actual tools used in the study methodology.
    The suggested patterns would help capture similar medical devices, cloud-based analysis software, and clinical diagnostic criteria in future mining.
    No observations could be extracted due to missing Results/Discussion sections.
