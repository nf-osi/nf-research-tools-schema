  expectedToolTypes: |
    Clinical Study → clinical assessment tools, imaging devices, diagnostic equipment, computational tools for analysis
    
    This clinical imaging study would be expected to contain:
    - Clinical assessment tools: NF1 diagnostic criteria, patient selection criteria
    - Medical devices: Ultrasound imaging equipment, dermoscopy devices
    - Computational tools: Image analysis software, data management systems
    
    Note: While this is a clinical study, it involves specialized medical imaging equipment and 
    software that qualify as research tools. Clinical studies can contain multiple tool types
    including computational tools for data analysis and specialized medical devices.
  overallAssessment: |
    This clinical imaging study would typically use research tools including specialized medical devices
    (ultrasound equipment, dermoscopy systems) and computational tools (image analysis software).
    The study involves systematic evaluation of neurofibromas using advanced imaging techniques,
    which requires both hardware and software tools for data acquisition and analysis.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite clear presence of research tools
    - Mining patterns failed to capture medical devices and imaging software
    - Clinical diagnostic criteria not recognized as assessment tools
    - Limited text availability (only Methods section) may have affected mining
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains legitimate research tools that were completely missed by the mining process.
    The Dermus SkinScanner and SkinAid software should definitely be added as they are core tools used in the study.
    The Legius criteria reference is borderline but represents a standardized clinical assessment tool.
    
    Key recommendations:
    1. Add patterns to capture medical device names with manufacturer information
    2. Improve computational tool detection for image analysis software
    3. Consider diagnostic criteria as clinical assessment tools when actively used
    4. The suggested patterns would significantly improve mining accuracy for clinical imaging studies
    
    No observations could be extracted due to absence of Results and Discussion sections.
    This highlights the importance of having complete publication text for comprehensive tool validation.
