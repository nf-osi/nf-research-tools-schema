  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on the experimental design described (immunohistochemistry, multiparameter flow cytometry, 
    and comparative transcriptomic studies), this publication should contain:
    - Antibodies (for IHC and flow cytometry targeting CD163, PD-1, PD-L1, H3K27me3)
    - Computational tools (for transcriptomic analysis and data processing)
    - Potentially clinical assessment tools (for progression-free survival analysis)
    
    The study involves fresh and FFPE tissue analysis with multiple experimental techniques,
    indicating substantial tool usage that was not captured by the initial mining.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study with clear experimental methods that would require multiple 
    research tools. The study uses immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and transcriptomics - all 
    techniques that require specific antibodies and computational analysis tools. The complete absence 
    of mined tools suggests significant under-detection by the mining algorithm.

      The proportion of CD163+ myeloid cells within the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) 
      correlated with poorer progression-free survival in patients with MPNST. This indicates 
      that higher levels of CD163+ tumor-associated macrophages are associated with worse 
      clinical outcomes and potentially more aggressive tumor behavior.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Complete failure of mining algorithm to detect any tools despite clear experimental study
    - Multiple antibodies used for immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry not detected
    - Computational tools for transcriptomic analysis not captured
    - Pattern matching appears to miss protein markers when mentioned without explicit "antibody" keyword
    - Expression-based mentions (CD163+, PD-L1 expression) not recognized as antibody usage
  recommendations: |
    This publication represents a significant mining failure - it's a clear laboratory research study 
    with multiple experimental techniques that require specific research tools, yet none were detected. 
    The mining algorithm needs substantial improvement to capture:
    
    1. Protein markers mentioned in expression context (CD163+, PD-L1 expression) as antibody usage
    2. Immune checkpoint molecules (PD-1, PD-L1) that require antibody detection
    3. Epigenetic modifications (H3K27me3) that require specific antibodies
    4. Computational tools implied by transcriptomic studies
    
    All 6 potentially missed tools should be added to improve coverage. The suggested patterns 
    would significantly improve detection of immunology-focused research tools. The extracted 
    observations provide valuable scientific insights about tumor-associated macrophages and 
    immune evasion mechanisms in NF1-associated tumors.
