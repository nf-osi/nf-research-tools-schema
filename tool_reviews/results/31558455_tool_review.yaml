    This is a clinical study protocol examining autism spectrum disorder in children with NF1.
    Expected tool types:
    - Clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, scales, diagnostic instruments) - HIGHLY EXPECTED
    - Computational tools for neuroimaging analysis - LIKELY
    - Neuroimaging protocols and sequences - POSSIBLE
    
    The publication describes extensive clinical assessment batteries including validated questionnaires,
    diagnostic interviews, cognitive tests, and behavioral rating scales. These are legitimate research
    tools used to measure patient outcomes and should be captured.
  overallAssessment: |
    This clinical study protocol extensively describes validated clinical assessment tools including
    diagnostic instruments (ADI-R, ADOS-2), standardized questionnaires (SRS-2, BRIEF, CBCL), and
    cognitive test batteries (WISC-V, WPPSI-IV, NEPSY-II). These are genuine research tools used for
    patient assessment and outcome measurement. The complete absence of mined tools suggests significant
    under-detection of clinical assessment tools in this publication type.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    Critical mining failure for clinical assessment tools:
    - This is a clinical study protocol extensively describing validated clinical assessment instruments
    - Zero tools were mined despite 20+ legitimate clinical assessment tools being described
    - Tools include gold-standard diagnostic instruments (ADI-R, ADOS-2), cognitive tests (WISC-V, WPPSI-IV), 
      behavioral rating scales (CBCL, BRIEF), and specialized questionnaires (SRS-2, Sensory Profile 2)
    - Both full names and standard abbreviations were missed
    - Clinical assessment tools are legitimate research tools for measuring patient outcomes
    - This represents a systematic failure to detect clinical assessment tools in protocol papers
  recommendations: |
    URGENT: Major revision needed for clinical assessment tool detection:
    1. Add patterns for standard clinical assessment tool names and abbreviations
    2. Include context phrases like "items assessing", "standardised questionnaires", "diagnostic assessment"
    3. Recognize that clinical study protocols contain extensive tool descriptions
    4. All 21 missed tools should be added to the database - they are validated research instruments
    5. Clinical assessment tools are as important as lab tools for research reproducibility
    6. Consider separate mining strategies for different publication types (protocol vs. results papers)
    7. This publication demonstrates clinical assessment tools can be extensively described without traditional "usage" language
