  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a comprehensive molecular profiling study combining histopathology, immunohistochemistry, 
    next-generation sequencing, copy number analysis, and DNA methylation profiling. Expected tool types:
    - Antibodies (for immunohistochemistry)
    - Computational tools (for bioinformatics analysis)
    - Genetic reagents (sequencing kits, reagents)
    - Potentially animal models (if referenced for validation)
    
    The study uses multiple platforms including NGS panels, methylation arrays, and various software
    for data analysis, making it highly likely to contain research tools across multiple categories.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication represents a high-quality laboratory research study with extensive molecular profiling
    methods. The detailed Methods section describes numerous experimental procedures that would require
    specific research tools including antibodies, sequencing reagents, and computational analysis software.
    The absence of mined tools appears to be a significant mining failure rather than a true absence of tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Complete mining failure: No tools were detected despite extensive use of research tools
    - Publication contains 10+ antibodies with detailed vendor/protocol information
    - Multiple genetic reagents including NGS panels, extraction kits, and methylation arrays
    - Numerous computational tools for bioinformatics analysis with version information
    - This represents a significant false negative rate in the mining algorithm
  recommendations: |
    This publication should have ALL 29 identified tools added to the database. The complete
    absence of mined tools represents a major failure of the mining algorithm for this type
    of comprehensive molecular profiling study. Key recommendations:
    
    1. Add all 29 identified tools (10 antibodies, 5 genetic reagents, 14 computational tools)
    2. Implement the 7 suggested patterns to catch similar tools in future mining
    3. Review mining algorithm for systematic issues with vendor names in parentheses
    4. Consider special handling for comprehensive molecular profiling studies
    5. The extracted observations provide valuable protocol information for tool usage
    
    This publication represents an ideal example of tool-rich laboratory research that
    should serve as a benchmark for mining algorithm performance.
