  title: "Assessing interobserver variability and accuracy in the histological diagnosis and classification of cutaneous neurofibromass."
  queryType: "clinical"  # From PubMed query (hint only)
  publicationType: "Observational Study"
  publicationTypeConfidence: 0.95  # High confidence - clear observational design evaluating pathologist agreement
  hasMethodsSection: Yes
  likelyContainsTools: Yes  # Digital pathology tools and database systems are research tools
  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on this observational pathology study, expected tool types include:
    - Computational tools: Digital pathology scanners, image viewers, databases (REDCap), statistical analysis software
    - Clinical assessment tools: Potentially histopathological classification systems or diagnostic criteria
    
    This is NOT a lab research study, so antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, 
    organoids, and PDX models are not expected. However, the digital pathology workflow and 
    data management systems represent legitimate computational research tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    This observational pathology study evaluates interobserver agreement among pathologists reviewing 
    digitized histological slides. While not traditional lab research, it uses several research tools 
    including digital pathology scanners, image analysis software, and database systems. The study 
    design focuses on developing standardized diagnostic criteria, which could constitute clinical 
    assessment tools for pathological diagnosis.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined from this publication, but several computational tools were missed
    - Digital pathology workflow uses specialized equipment and software that constitute research tools
    - REDCap database system is a widely used research platform that should be captured
    - Mining patterns need improvement for digital pathology and clinical research tools
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains several legitimate computational research tools that were missed by the 
    initial mining process:
    1. Aperio XT scanner - specialized digital pathology equipment
    2. CaloPix viewer - image analysis software with vendor information
    3. REDCap database - research data management platform
    4. Aperio SVS files - proprietary digital pathology file format
    
    The mining patterns should be enhanced to better capture:
    - Digital pathology equipment (scanners, viewers)
    - Research database platforms (REDCap, etc.)
    - Specialized file formats and standards
    - Clinical research computational tools
    
    While this is not a traditional lab study, it represents legitimate use of research tools in 
    clinical/observational research that should be captured for completeness.
