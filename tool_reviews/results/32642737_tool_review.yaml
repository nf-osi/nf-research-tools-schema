    Clinical Study → clinical assessment tools, computational tools for analysis
    This is a pathology study evaluating diagnostic agreement, which may use:
    - Digital pathology tools/software for image analysis
    - Database systems for data collection (REDCap mentioned)
    - Statistical analysis software
    - Imaging/scanning equipment
    - Clinical assessment frameworks for diagnostic concordance
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a clinical pathology study focused on diagnostic agreement among pathologists reviewing neurofibroma histology. While it lacks traditional lab research tools, it uses digital pathology infrastructure, data management systems, and statistical analysis tools. The study develops diagnostic criteria which could be considered a clinical assessment framework.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining found no tools despite clear tool usage in methods
    - Digital pathology infrastructure (scanners, viewers, databases) not captured
    - Clinical research data management tools (REDCap) missed
    - Specialized imaging equipment and software overlooked
  recommendations: |
    This publication demonstrates significant gaps in computational tool mining for clinical/pathology studies. The study uses several important research tools:
    1. Aperio XT scanner - should definitely be added as digital pathology equipment
    2. CaloPix viewer - specialized pathology software with vendor info
    3. REDCap database - standard clinical research data platform
    4. Aperio SVS format - proprietary digital pathology format
    
    Mining patterns need expansion to capture digital pathology workflows and clinical research infrastructure. These tools are essential for modern pathology research but currently missed by existing patterns.
