    Bioinformatics Analysis → computational tools (software, pipelines, databases)
    This publication describes the development and application of PERADIGM, a computational framework
    for rare disease gene mapping using phenotype embeddings. Expected tools include:
    - The PERADIGM framework itself (newly developed)
    - Standard bioinformatics tools (PLINK for quality control)
    - Machine learning frameworks (Word2Vec embedding model)
    - Databases (UK Biobank dataset)
    - Programming languages and statistical software for implementation
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a computational methods paper that develops and validates a new bioinformatics framework (PERADIGM)
    for rare disease gene discovery. The study uses machine learning approaches and large-scale genomic datasets,
    making computational tools the primary expected resource type. The detailed Methods section describes extensive
    computational analyses, quality control procedures, and algorithm development.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a computational methods paper
    - The main contribution (PERADIGM framework) was completely missed
    - Standard bioinformatics tools (PLINK, Word2Vec) used in the analysis were not captured
    - Large-scale dataset (UK Biobank) used as primary resource was not identified
  recommendations: |
    All four potentially missed tools should be added to the mining results:
    - PERADIGM is the primary novel computational tool developed in this study
    - PLINK is a standard bioinformatics tool used for quality control
    - Word2Vec is the machine learning framework underlying the embedding approach
    - UK Biobank 200K dataset is the primary data resource
    The suggested patterns would help capture similar computational frameworks and datasets in future mining.
    No observations were extracted as this is a methods development paper without specific phenotypic findings.
