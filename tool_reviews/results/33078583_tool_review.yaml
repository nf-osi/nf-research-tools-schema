  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple mouse genetic reagents (Cre lines, floxed alleles) were missed
    - Numerous antibodies with catalog numbers were not captured
    - Standard bioinformatics tools (STAR, DESeq2, MaxQuant, ImageJ) were missed
    - Mining patterns appear insufficient for capturing standard molecular biology tools
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The study uses multiple mouse genetic reagents, antibodies, and computational tools that should
    have been captured. Patterns need significant improvement to capture:
    1. Cre recombinase lines and floxed alleles (genetic reagents)
    2. Antibodies with vendor/catalog information
    3. Standard bioinformatics software with versions
    All 12 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine research tools
    used in experimental procedures described in the Methods section.
