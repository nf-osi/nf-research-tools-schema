    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study using mouse models, immunostaining, proteomics, 
    transcriptomics, and various molecular biology techniques. Expected tool types include:
    - Animal models (multiple knockout mouse lines)
    - Antibodies (for immunostaining and Western blots)
    - Genetic reagents (Cre lines, floxed alleles, reporter constructs)
    - Computational tools (for RNA-seq, proteomics, statistical analysis)
    
    No clinical assessment tools, organoids, or PDX models are expected based on the study design.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a high-quality laboratory research publication that extensively uses research tools across multiple categories.
    The study involves creating and characterizing muscle-specific knockout mouse models, requiring sophisticated
    genetic reagents, antibodies for tissue analysis, and computational tools for omics data analysis. The comprehensive
    Methods section and experimental approach strongly indicate extensive tool usage for molecular biology, histology,
    proteomics, and transcriptomics experiments.

    Critical mining failure - this publication contains extensive research tools that were completely missed:
    - 4 genetic reagents (Cre lines, floxed alleles, reporter constructs)
    - 21 antibodies (for immunostaining and Western blots with full vendor information)
    - 7 computational tools (bioinformatics software, analysis tools, imaging software)
    - 2 animal models (knockout mouse lines)
    
    The mining system failed to capture any tools despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    with detailed Methods section containing extensive tool usage information.
  recommendations: |
    URGENT: Complete overhaul of mining patterns needed. This publication represents a total mining failure
    with 32+ research tools completely missed. Key recommendations:
    
    1. Add patterns for genetic reagents (Cre lines, floxed alleles, reporter constructs)
    2. Implement comprehensive antibody detection with vendor/catalog number patterns
    3. Add computational tool patterns for bioinformatics software with version numbers
    4. Include animal model naming conventions for knockout mice
    5. Add vendor-based detection patterns (Sigma, Cell Signaling, etc.)
    6. Implement context-based detection for "analyzed using", "performed with" phrases
    
    All 32 missed tools should be added to the database. The current mining system is inadequate
    for detecting standard laboratory research tools. This publication demonstrates the need for
    comprehensive pattern updates across all tool categories.
    
    Scientific observations: Successfully extracted 6 high-quality observations covering multiple
    phenotypic categories including body weight, lifespan, organ development, metabolism, and
    cellular phenotypes with quantitative data and statistical significance.
