    Clinical Study → clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, scales, outcome measures), possibly computational tools for analysis
    
    This qualitative study specifically focuses on pain assessment in NF1 patients and uses multiple validated clinical assessment instruments in their methodology. The study involves focus groups and interviews, which are standard clinical research methods. Given the focus on pain assessment and the detailed methods describing use of validated questionnaires, clinical assessment tools are highly expected.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a qualitative clinical research study examining patient and provider perspectives on chronic pain assessment in NF1. The study uses established clinical assessment tools (questionnaires and scales) to screen participants and collect data. Clinical assessment tools are definitely expected and should be present, as the methods section explicitly describes using validated instruments like BPI-SF, PHQ-9, GAD-7, and SCID-SR. The mining appears to have missed several clinical assessment tools that are clearly mentioned in the methods.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Mining completely failed to capture any clinical assessment tools despite this being a clinical study
    - Multiple validated clinical assessment instruments (BPI-SF, PHQ-9, GAD-7, SCID-SR) explicitly mentioned in methods were missed
    - Computational tools used for data collection (Qualtrics) and analysis (ATLAS.ti) were also missed
    - This represents a significant gap in clinical assessment tool mining patterns
  recommendations: |
    - All 11 potentially missed tools should be added to the database
    - The mining patterns for clinical assessment tools need significant improvement to capture standard validated instruments
    - Both full names and abbreviated forms of clinical tools should be captured (e.g., "Brief Pain Inventory Short Form" and "BPI-SF")
    - Survey platforms and qualitative analysis software should be included in computational tool patterns
    - This publication demonstrates the need for better coverage of clinical research tools
    - No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated, but the missed tools would likely have usage observations in the methods section
