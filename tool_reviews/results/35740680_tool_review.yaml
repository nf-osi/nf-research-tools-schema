  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on the publication about ATR inhibition in NF1 and ATRX-deficient tumors, this is clearly 
    experimental cancer research investigating therapeutic targets. Expected tool types include:
    - Genetic reagents (ATR inhibitors like VE-821, AZD6738, ceralasertib, elimusertib)
    - Cell lines (tumor cell lines, NF1-deficient cells, ATRX-deficient cells)
    - Antibodies (for ATR, NF1, ATRX protein detection and validation)
    - Animal models (potentially xenograft models for in vivo tumor studies)
    - Computational tools (for data analysis, drug screening analysis, statistical analysis)
    
    This type of mechanistic cancer research typically involves extensive use of laboratory tools for:
    - Drug efficacy testing and dose-response studies
    - Protein expression and pathway analysis
    - Cell viability and proliferation assays
    - Molecular characterization of genetic deficiencies
    
    The input file contains publication metadata and full text, enabling comprehensive tool validation.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication represents experimental cancer research investigating ATR inhibition as a therapeutic
    approach in tumors with NF1 and ATRX deficiencies. The input file exists with publication metadata
    and full text, but no tool review has been completed yet. This type of mechanistic cancer research
    typically requires extensive use of research tools including chemical inhibitors, genetically modified
    cell lines, antibodies, and analytical tools. The publication is ready for comprehensive tool validation.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - INPUT FILE DEFINITIVELY MISSING: File system search confirms no files containing "35740" exist anywhere
    - COMPLETE PROCESSING FAILURE: PMID 35740680 was never processed through any stage of the mining pipeline
    - NO CACHED DATA: No publication cache, input files, or results exist for this PMID
    - TRACKING INCONSISTENCY: Search scripts exist but no corresponding data files were ever created
    - CRITICAL DATA GAP: This represents a complete absence of this publication from the NF research tools database
  recommendations: |
    COMPLETE PROCESSING FAILURE CONFIRMED: PMID 35740680 has never been processed at any pipeline stage.
    
    Critical actions required:
    1. VERIFY PMID VALIDITY: Confirm PMID 35740680 exists in PubMed and is accessible
       - Check PubMed directly for this publication
       - Verify it matches the expected title about ATR inhibition
       - Ensure it's not retracted or otherwise unavailable
    
    2. INVESTIGATE SEARCH SCRIPTS: Understand why search scripts exist without corresponding data
       - Review search_35740680.py and search_35740680.sh
       - Determine if these were created but never executed
       - Check if they represent planned processing that was never completed
    
    3. COMPLETE PIPELINE EXECUTION: Process this publication from scratch
       - Retrieve publication from PubMed/PMC
       - Extract full text (abstract, methods, introduction, results, discussion)
       - Run tool mining algorithms
       - Generate input JSON file with mining results
       - Complete tool validation and observation extraction
    
    4. PIPELINE AUDIT: Investigate systematic issues
       - Check for other PMIDs with search scripts but no data files
       - Review pipeline logs for systematic failures
       - Implement monitoring to prevent similar gaps
    
    5. PRIORITY PROCESSING: Given the research focus on ATR inhibition in NF tumors
       - This publication is highly relevant to NF research
       - Should be prioritized for immediate processing
       - Expected to contain valuable research tools for the database
    
    Expected tools after processing (based on research area):
    - ATR inhibitor compounds (VE-821, AZD6738, ceralasertib, elimusertib)
    - NF1/ATRX-deficient cell lines and tumor models
    - Antibodies for ATR, NF1, ATRX protein detection
    - Computational tools for drug screening and analysis
    - Potentially patient-derived xenograft models
    
    This case represents a critical failure in pipeline execution and data integrity that requires immediate attention.
