      SPM 8 was used for coregistration of contrast enhanced T1W MRIs to motion corrected PET images.
      The software successfully performed rigid body transformations for image alignment, enabling
      accurate overlay of anatomical and functional imaging data. This coregistration was critical

    - No tools were initially mined from this publication despite it being a computational imaging study
    - Multiple computational tools were clearly mentioned with specific versions and usage contexts
    - The mining system appears to have missed several well-established software packages (SPM, SPSS, Analyze)
    - Commercial software with vendor information was not detected (Brainlab iPlan)
    - Specialized PET reconstruction software was not captured
  recommendations: |
    This publication should have 6-8 computational tools added to the database:
    - High confidence tools: SPM 8, SPSS version 23, Analyze version 11, Brainlab iPlan software (should definitely be added)
    - Medium confidence tools: e7_tools, HRRT user community software (should likely be added)
    - Lower confidence tools: OSEM algorithm, TXTV method (may be too generic/methodological)
    
    The mining patterns need significant improvement for computational tools, especially:
    - Software with version numbers (SPM 8, SPSS version 23, Analyze version 11)
    - Commercial software with vendor information (Brainlab iPlan)
    - Specialized imaging reconstruction software
    
    All identified tools have clear usage contexts and are essential for the study methodology.
    The observations extracted demonstrate practical usage and performance of these tools in
    a clinical research setting.
