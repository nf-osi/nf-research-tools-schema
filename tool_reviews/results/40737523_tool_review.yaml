  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on publication type (Questionnaire/Survey Development):
    - Clinical assessment tools: Likert scale questionnaire (25 statements), survey instruments
    - Computational tools: Survey platforms (Qualtrics), transcription software (Zoom transcription), 
      qualitative analysis software (Dedoose)
    
    This study develops and validates a clinical assessment instrument (Likert scale questionnaire)
    to evaluate clinician perspectives on 3D volumetric analysis tools. The questionnaire itself
    is a clinical assessment tool. Additionally, the study uses computational tools for data
    collection and analysis.
    
    Note: While the study discusses a 3D volumetric analysis tool under development, this tool
    is the SUBJECT of study, not a tool USED in the research methodology.
  overallAssessment: |
    This qualitative pilot study develops and validates a clinical assessment instrument (25-statement
    Likert scale questionnaire) to evaluate clinician perspectives on 3D volumetric analysis tools.
    The questionnaire itself represents a clinical assessment tool, and the study employs computational
    tools for survey administration and qualitative data analysis. Tools are expected and present.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    Major issues identified during review:
    - No tools were mined from this publication despite clear presence of research tools
    - Clinical assessment tools (Likert scale questionnaire) were completely missed
    - Computational tools for survey administration and qualitative analysis were not captured
    - Current mining patterns appear to focus heavily on lab tools and miss clinical research tools
    - This represents a significant gap in tool coverage for clinical/survey research publications
  recommendations: |
    Strong recommendations for this publication:
    - ADD the 5 identified tools that were missed during initial mining
    - This publication clearly contains legitimate research tools used in the methodology
    - The Likert scale questionnaire is a validated clinical assessment instrument
    - Computational tools (Qualtrics, Dedoose, Zoom transcription) are essential research infrastructure
    - Implement suggested patterns to improve capture of clinical assessment tools and survey platforms
    - This publication demonstrates need for better coverage of qualitative research methodologies
    - Consider expanding mining patterns to include survey research and qualitative analysis tools
