  title: "Clinician Perspectives of a Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Based 3D Volumetric Analysis Tool for Neurofibromatosis Type 2-Related Schwannomatosis: Qualitative Pilot Study."
  queryType: "clinical"
  publicationType: "Questionnaire/Survey Development"
  publicationTypeConfidence: 0.95
  hasMethodsSection: Yes
  likelyContainsTools: Yes
  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a questionnaire/survey development study examining clinician perspectives on imaging analysis tools.
    Expected tools:
    - Clinical assessment tools: Likert scale questionnaire (25 statements), survey instruments
    - Computational tools: 3D volumetric analysis software being developed (AI-driven tool)
    - Potentially missed: Qualtrics survey platform, Zoom transcription, Dedoose qualitative analysis software
    
    Note: This is NOT a lab research study - it's qualitative research about tool development rather than
    actual experimental usage of research tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    This qualitative pilot study develops and validates a survey instrument to assess clinician perspectives
    on 3D volumetric analysis tools for NF2-related schwannomatosis. While it discusses an AI-driven 3D
    volumetric tool under development, the study itself uses survey methodology and qualitative analysis
    rather than experimental lab techniques. Clinical assessment tools (questionnaires) and computational
    analysis tools are expected for this publication type.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a tool development/validation study
    - Publication focuses on survey methodology and qualitative analysis rather than experimental lab work
    - Multiple computational tools (Qualtrics, Dedoose, Zoom) and clinical assessment tools (Likert questionnaire) were missed
    - The 3D volumetric analysis tool being evaluated is under development, not experimentally used
    - This is qualitative research about tools rather than experimental usage of tools
  recommendations: |
    - Add the missed clinical assessment tool (Likert scale questionnaire) and computational tools (Qualtrics, Dedoose, Zoom transcription)
    - The 3D volumetric analysis tool should be captured as it's the main focus of evaluation, even though under development
    - Improve mining patterns for survey research tools and qualitative analysis software
    - Consider that clinical/survey studies use different tool types than lab research
    - No experimental observations to extract since this is survey methodology research
    - Manual review recommended for the AI-driven 3D volumetric tool classification
