    Clinical Study → clinical assessment tools (WISC-III found), computational tools for EEG analysis
    
    This neurophysiological study uses EEG/ERP measurements in human participants with NF1.
    Expected tools include:
    - Clinical assessment tools: WISC-III intelligence scale (found)
    - Computational tools: MATLAB, STIM 2, Scan 4.5, IBM SPSS Statistics (found)
    - No lab research tools expected (antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents)
    - No advanced cellular models or patient-derived models expected
  overallAssessment: |
    This clinical neurophysiological study examines visual processing in NF1 patients using EEG recordings.
    The study design involves human participants and neurophysiological measurements, making it likely to contain
    computational tools for data analysis and clinical assessment tools for participant characterization.
    Traditional lab research tools (antibodies, cell lines, animal models) are not expected in this type of study.

      MATLAB R2008a was used to generate visual stimuli for the EEG experiments. The software was used
      in conjunction with STIM 2 presentation software to create circular horizontal Gabors (sinewave
      gratings modulated by a Gaussian window) for achromatic, red-green, and blue-yellow visual stimulation.
      Stimuli were calibrated for specific chromatic properties using cone contrast space calculations.

      Scan 4.5 (Neuroscan) was used for comprehensive EEG data analysis including: automated eye blink
      artifact correction using spatial principal component analysis, bandpass filtering (1-100 Hz),
      epoch extraction, artifact rejection (>100 μV threshold), VEP averaging, and spectral analysis
      using fast Fourier transforms. The software enabled both time-domain and frequency-domain analyses
      of visual evoked potentials.

      The Portuguese adapted version of WISC-III was administered to all NF1 participants and a subset
      of controls (n=8). Mean full-scale IQ for NF1 group was 97 (SD=16), while control subgroup scored
      124 (SD=17). The assessment confirmed the typical downward IQ shift in NF1 populations. Importantly,
      neurophysiological differences (alpha oscillations) persisted even when comparing IQ-matched
      subgroups, indicating that EEG abnormalities were not simply due to general cognitive differences.

      STIM 2 stimulation software (Neuroscan) was used to present visual stimuli with precise timing
      and display parameters. The system operated at 1,280 × 1,024 × 32 resolution with NVIDIA GeForce
      6600 graphics processing, presented on a CRT monitor at 85 Hz refresh rate. The software enabled
      precise control of stimulus timing for phase-reversal paradigms and integration with EEG trigger
      systems for synchronized data acquisition.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite clear presence of computational and clinical assessment tools
    - Mining patterns missed standard software tools with version numbers and vendor information
    - Clinical assessment tools (WISC-III) were not detected despite clear administration context
    - Publication was classified as "bench" query but is actually a clinical neurophysiological study
  recommendations: |
    All 5 identified tools should be added to the mining results:
    - MATLAB, STIM 2, Scan 4.5, and IBM SPSS Statistics are clearly computational tools with version/vendor info
    - WISC-III is a validated clinical assessment tool administered to study participants
    - The mining patterns need improvement to catch software tools with parenthetical version/vendor information
    - Context phrases like "analysis was performed with" and "administered" should be added to improve detection
    - This publication demonstrates the need for better computational tool and clinical assessment tool mining patterns
    - All extracted observations provide valuable usage information for these tools in neurophysiological research
