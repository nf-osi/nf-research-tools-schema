publicationMetadata:
  pmid: "36148553"
  title: "UNKNOWN - Input file not found"
  queryType: "unknown"
  publicationType: "Unknown - Cannot determine without input file"
  publicationTypeConfidence: 0.0
  hasMethodsSection: "Unknown"
  likelyContainsTools: "Unknown"
  expectedToolTypes: |
    Cannot determine expected tool types without access to the publication content.
    The input file /home/runner/work/nf-research-tools-schema/nf-research-tools-schema/tool_reviews/inputs/36148553_input.json
    does not exist in the repository.
    
    To complete this validation, the following would be needed:
    1. Publication metadata (title, journal, year, DOI)
    2. Abstract text
    3. Full text sections (Methods, Introduction, Results, Discussion)
    4. List of mined tools with their types and context
    
    Based on the PMID being in the 36000000 range, this would be a relatively recent publication
    (likely 2022-2023), but without the actual content, no tool validation can be performed.
  overallAssessment: |
    Unable to assess publication type or tool usage without access to the input file.

    CRITICAL ISSUE: Input file not found
    - The file /home/runner/work/nf-research-tools-schema/nf-research-tools-schema/tool_reviews/inputs/36148553_input.json does not exist
    - Cannot perform tool validation without publication content
    - Repository contains input files for many other PMIDs but not 36148553
    - A search script (search_36148553.py) exists in the root directory, suggesting this PMID was of interest
  recommendations: |
    To complete the tool validation for PMID 36148553:
    
    1. LOCATE OR CREATE INPUT FILE:
       - Check if the publication data exists elsewhere in the system
       - Run the search_36148553.py script if it exists to generate the input file
       - Manually retrieve publication data from PubMed if needed
    
    2. VERIFY PMID ACCURACY:
       - Confirm that 36148553 is the correct PMID
       - Check for any typos in the publication identifier
    
    3. GENERATE INPUT DATA:
       - Retrieve publication metadata (title, journal, year, DOI)
       - Extract full text sections (abstract, methods, introduction, results, discussion)
       - Run tool mining algorithms to identify potential research tools
       - Create properly formatted JSON input file
    
    4. RERUN VALIDATION:
       - Once input file is available, perform comprehensive tool validation
       - Follow the standard workflow for publication type assessment
       - Validate each mined tool against the criteria
       - Extract scientific observations from validated tools
    
    Without the input file, no meaningful tool validation can be performed.
    This represents a gap in the dataset that needs to be addressed.
