  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study that should contain multiple tool categories:
    - Animal models (transgenic mouse lines with specific genetic modifications)
    - Cell lines (primary tumor cultures and established cell lines)
    - Antibodies (for western blotting, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence)
    - Genetic reagents (shRNA constructs, plasmids, viral vectors)
    - Computational tools (ImageJ for quantification, GraphPad Prism for statistics)
    
    The study involves both in vitro cell culture experiments and in vivo mouse model studies,
    indicating extensive use of research tools across multiple categories.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication represents a high-quality laboratory research study investigating schwannoma
    and meningioma tumor biology using both mouse models and human primary cell cultures. The
    comprehensive Methods section describes extensive experimental procedures that would require
    numerous research tools. The complete absence of mined tools indicates a significant failure
    in the mining process, as this publication clearly contains dozens of legitimate research tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Complete failure of mining system: Zero tools detected despite publication containing 20+ legitimate research tools
    - Missing all major tool categories: animal models, cell lines, antibodies, genetic reagents, computational tools
    - Failed to detect standard research tool naming conventions (fl/fl alleles, Cre lines, cell line names)
    - No recognition of antibodies with catalog numbers and vendors
    - Computational tools (ImageJ, GraphPad Prism) not detected despite explicit usage context
    - Small molecule compounds/inhibitors not recognized as genetic reagents
    - Plasmid vectors and viral packaging systems not detected
  recommendations: |
    This represents a catastrophic failure of the mining system for a publication rich in research tools.
    ALL 24 potentially missed tools should be added to the database as they represent legitimate,
    well-documented research tools with clear experimental usage. The mining patterns need major
    improvements to detect:
    
    1. Standard mouse genetics nomenclature (fl/fl, Cre lines)
    2. Cell line naming conventions with explicit context
    3. Antibodies with catalog numbers and vendor information
    4. Plasmid and vector naming patterns
    5. Software tools mentioned in analysis context
    6. Small molecule compounds used as research reagents
    
    The 10 suggested patterns should be implemented immediately to prevent similar failures.
    This publication should serve as a test case for validating improved mining algorithms.
    
    Scientific observations were successfully extracted for the identified tools, showing good
    experimental characterization of tool performance and limitations. The observations include
    quantitative data on tumor growth inhibition, cellular effects, and usage protocols.
