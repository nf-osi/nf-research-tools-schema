  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on publication type (Clinical Study focused on outcome measure recommendations):
    - Clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, scales) - HIGHLY EXPECTED
    - Computational tools for analysis - POSSIBLE but not primary focus
    
    This publication specifically aims to recommend social skills assessment tools for NF1 clinical trials.
    The methods describe systematic review of existing clinical assessment instruments.
    Lab tools (antibodies, cell lines, animal models, etc.) are NOT expected in this type of study.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a clinical recommendations paper that systematically reviews and recommends social skills 
    assessment tools for use in NF1 clinical trials. Clinical assessment tools are highly expected and 
    appropriate for this publication type. The study methodology involves evaluating existing validated 
    instruments rather than developing new tools or conducting lab experiments.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    Major mining gaps identified:
    - Two primary clinical assessment tools (SRS-2, SSIS-RS) that are the main outcomes of this study were completely missed
    - Computational databases (PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov) used in methodology were not captured
    - This represents a significant failure to capture the core tools discussed in this clinical recommendations paper
  recommendations: |
    Critical recommendations for this publication:
    - ADD the two clinical assessment tools (SRS-2, SSIS-RS) as these are the primary recommendations of the study
    - ADD the computational databases (PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov) as these are methodological tools
    - This publication demonstrates that clinical assessment tool mining patterns need significant improvement
    - The suggested patterns should be implemented to catch similar validated clinical instruments
    - No observations were extracted as this is a recommendations paper rather than an experimental study
    - Future mining should better recognize clinical recommendations papers as rich sources of assessment tools
