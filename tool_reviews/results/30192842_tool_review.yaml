    Based on publication type (Bioinformatics Analysis):
    - Computational tools (software, pipelines) - EXPECTED
    - Clinical assessment tools (neuropsychological tests) - EXPECTED
    
    This study combines neuroimaging analysis with cognitive assessment, so both computational
    tools for image processing/machine learning AND clinical assessment tools for cognitive
    evaluation are expected. The study uses 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging, neuropsychological testing,
    and machine learning approaches.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a computational neuroimaging study that should contain multiple research tools.
    The study uses sophisticated image processing (SPM8, Matlab), machine learning (Gaussian
    Process Regression in R), and standardized neuropsychological assessments (WAIS-III,
    WISC-III, etc.). The mining found zero tools, which appears to be a significant
    under-detection given the clear presence of computational and clinical assessment tools.

      The NF1 group had significantly inferior performance compared to controls in intelligence

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Mining detected zero tools despite clear presence of multiple computational and clinical assessment tools
    - Publication contains extensive use of neuroimaging software (SPM8, Matlab), machine learning tools (R, kernlab), and standardized neuropsychological assessments
    - This represents a major under-detection failure - at least 12 legitimate research tools were missed
    - Both computational tools and clinical assessment tools are clearly present and actively used in the study
  recommendations: |
    - ALL 12 potentially missed tools should be added to the database - they represent legitimate research tools with clear experimental usage
    - The mining patterns need significant enhancement to detect:
      1. Standard neuroimaging software (SPM, Matlab with versions)
      2. R packages and functions in computational contexts
      3. Standardized neuropsychological assessment tools
      4. Clinical assessment instruments with proper naming conventions
    - This publication demonstrates that current mining is severely under-detecting computational tools and clinical assessment tools
    - The suggested patterns should be implemented to improve detection of similar tools in future mining
    - Quality control processes should flag publications with zero detected tools for manual review, especially in computational/clinical domains
