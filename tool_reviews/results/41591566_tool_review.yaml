  title: "FAP expression as a marker of malignant transformation enabling in vivo characterization in peripheral nerve sheath tumors: a multimodal and translational study."
  queryType: "bench"
  publicationType: "Lab Research"
  publicationTypeConfidence: 0.95
  hasMethodsSection: Yes
  likelyContainsTools: Yes
  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a multimodal translational study combining:
    - Lab Research → antibodies, computational tools, genetic reagents (RNA profiling panels)
    - Clinical Research → clinical imaging tracers/techniques
    - Bioinformatics Analysis → computational tools (R packages, analysis pipelines)
    
    The study integrates immunohistochemistry, transcriptomics analysis, and clinical PET/CT imaging,
    so it should contain antibodies, computational tools, and potentially clinical assessment tools.
    The comprehensive methods section indicates extensive use of research tools across multiple categories.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication is a comprehensive translational research study that clearly uses multiple research tools.
    The detailed methods section describes immunohistochemistry protocols, computational analysis pipelines,
    and clinical imaging techniques. Tools are expected across antibodies, computational tools, and clinical
    imaging reagents. The fact that no tools were initially mined suggests significant gaps in the mining patterns.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Mining patterns failed to detect multiple clear research tools including:
      * Specific antibody with clone number and vendor (anti-FAP ab207178)
      * Multiple R/Bioconductor packages (Seurat, GEOquery, Biobase, Slingshot)
      * Commercial molecular profiling platforms (TruSight RNA Panel, Illumina EPIC)
      * Spatial transcriptomics platform (10X Genomics Visium)
      * Clinical PET radiotracer ([68Ga]Ga-LNTH-1363S)
    - Patterns are missing for vendor information, R package detection, and clinical imaging reagents
  recommendations: |
    - ALL 10 identified tools should be added to the database - they represent genuine research tools with clear experimental usage
    - Implement the 6 suggested patterns to improve detection of similar tools in future mining
    - Review mining patterns for R/Bioconductor packages - many bioinformatics tools are being missed
    - Add patterns for commercial molecular profiling platforms and spatial transcriptomics
    - Include patterns for PET/SPECT radiotracers in clinical assessment tools
    - Consider adding vendor location patterns as strong indicators of research tools
    - No observations extracted as no tools were initially validated, but the Results/Discussion sections likely contain relevant findings about FAP expression patterns
