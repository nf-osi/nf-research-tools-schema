  expectedToolTypes: |
    Cannot assess expected tool types due to empty input file. The input file 
    /tool_reviews/inputs/33669386_input.json exists but contains no data.
    
    This could indicate:
    - Publication data extraction failed
    - File was created but never populated
    - Publication is inaccessible or behind paywall
    - Processing error occurred during data collection
    
    Without publication content, cannot determine what tool types would be expected.

  overallAssessment: |
    Unable to perform tool validation due to empty input file. Publication 33669386 is queued
    for processing but has not yet been successfully processed through the data extraction
    pipeline. The empty input file indicates this publication is pending data collection rather
    than representing a completed analysis with zero tools found.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - STATUS: Publication 33669386 is queued for processing but not yet completed
    - Input file 33669386_input.json exists but is empty (awaiting data population)
    - No publication metadata, full text, or mined tools available for validation
    - Cannot perform tool validation without publication content
    - Represents a pending processing case rather than a processing failure
  recommendations: |
    PROCESSING STATUS: Publication 33669386 is in the processing queue but incomplete.
    
    NEXT STEPS:
    1. COMPLETE DATA EXTRACTION: Run the publication data extraction pipeline for PMID 33669386
       - Extract publication metadata (title, abstract, DOI, journal, year, queryType)
       - Retrieve full text sections (Methods, Introduction, Results, Discussion)
       - Perform tool mining across all sections
       - Populate the input JSON file with extracted data
    
    2. RETRY TOOL REVIEW: Once input file is populated, re-run tool validation process
    
    3. PIPELINE MANAGEMENT: 
       - Track processing status to avoid duplicate reviews of incomplete files
       - Implement status indicators to distinguish empty (pending) vs failed extractions
       - Consider processing priority based on publication relevance to NF research
    
    4. CURRENT STATUS: Mark as "PENDING_DATA_EXTRACTION" rather than "FAILED"
    
    This publication should be revisited once the data extraction pipeline successfully
    populates the input file with publication content and mined tools.
