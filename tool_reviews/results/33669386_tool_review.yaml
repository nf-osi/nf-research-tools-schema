  expectedToolTypes: |
    Review articles typically do not contain research tools used in original experiments.
    They may mention tools in the context of discussing other studies, but these would be
    citations rather than actual tool usage. This review focuses on animal models as
    research subjects rather than tools used to study them.
    
    Expected tool types for this publication type:
    - Unlikely to contain: antibodies, cell lines, genetic reagents, computational tools,
      organoids, PDX models, clinical assessment tools
    - May mention: animal models (as research subjects, not tools)
    
    Note: Animal models mentioned in reviews are typically research subjects being
    discussed, not tools being used by the authors for experiments.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive review article discussing spontaneous and engineered large
    animal models of neurofibromatosis type 1. Review articles synthesize existing
    literature rather than report original experimental work, so they typically do not
    use research tools directly. Any tools mentioned would be in the context of
    discussing other studies' methodologies. The absence of a Methods section confirms
    this is not an experimental study.

    shouldBeAdded: No
    reasoning: "While Cre-Lox is a genetic tool, it's mentioned here in a review context discussing limitations of existing models, not as a tool used by the authors"

    whyMissed: "This gene editing technology is mentioned as an enabling technology in the field"
    confidence: 0.2
    shouldBeAdded: No
    reasoning: "CRISPR/Cas9 is mentioned in general terms as a field advancement, not as a specific tool used in experiments by the authors"

    foundIn: "introduction"
    contextSnippet: "...advances in gene editing and reproductive technologies like CRISPR/Cas9 and somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) have enabled researchers..."
    whyMissed: "This reproductive technology is mentioned alongside CRISPR as an enabling technology"
    confidence: 0.2
    shouldBeAdded: No
    reasoning: "SCNT is mentioned as a general reproductive technology advancement, not as a specific tool used by the authors"

    whyMissed: "This appears to be an animal model developed by the authors, but mentioned in review context"
    confidence: 0.4
    shouldBeAdded: Maybe
    reasoning: "While this could be considered a tool, it's mentioned in the context of the authors' previous work being reviewed, not as a tool actively used in this publication"

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a review article, not original experimental research
    - No Methods section present, confirming lack of experimental procedures
    - All tool mentions are in the context of discussing other studies' work
    - No original experimental data or tool usage reported
    - Tools mentioned (Cre-Lox, CRISPR, SCNT) are discussed as field technologies, not actively used
  recommendations: |
    This publication should not contribute any tools to the database as it is a review article
    that synthesizes existing literature rather than reporting original experimental work.
    The mining correctly identified zero tools. The potentially missed tools identified are
    all mentioned in review context (discussing other studies' methods) rather than active
    usage by the authors. Review articles are valuable for understanding the field but do
    not typically contain research tools that should be cataloged in a tools database.
    
    Future mining should consider adding patterns to better distinguish between:
    1. Active tool usage ("we used", "we analyzed with", "we generated")
    2. Review context ("studies have used", "researchers rely on", "advances in")
    3. Citation context ("as described by", "previously reported", "established methods")
    
    No observations were extracted as this review does not report original experimental
    findings about specific tools.
