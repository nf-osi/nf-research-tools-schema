    Lab Research → antibodies, computational tools, genetic reagents, potentially advanced cellular models
    
    This publication describes laboratory research involving:
    - Immunohistochemistry (antibodies expected)
    - Next-generation sequencing (computational tools expected)
    - PCR and molecular biology (genetic reagents expected)
    - Crypt isolation technique (potentially advanced cellular models)
    - Statistical analysis (computational tools expected)
    
    The publication spans multiple tool categories as it combines wet lab molecular biology 
    with computational analysis and statistical methods.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study that develops and validates a crypt isolation 
    technique for genetic analysis of colorectal carcinomas. The study clearly uses multiple research 
    tools including antibodies for immunohistochemistry, computational software for sequencing analysis, 
    and statistical tools for data analysis. The presence of detailed Methods, Results, and Discussion 
    sections with experimental procedures strongly indicates genuine tool usage rather than just citations.

      The p53 antibody clone DO-7 from DAKO was used successfully for immunohistochemistry 
      following the NordicQC method. The antibody showed reliable performance in detecting 
      p53 protein expression patterns across different mutation types. Inter-rater variability 
      for assessment of p53 expression by independent observers showed very good agreement.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive laboratory research study
    - Multiple clear research tools were missed including antibodies, computational software, and genetic reagents
    - The mining system failed to detect tools with vendor information and version numbers
    - Laboratory equipment and automated platforms were not captured
    - R packages and statistical software were not identified
  recommendations: |
    All 10 potentially missed tools should be added to the database as they represent genuine research 
    tools used in this laboratory study. The tools include:
    
    HIGH PRIORITY (should definitely be added):
    - p53 antibody clone DO-7 (DAKO) - specific antibody with clone information
    - MiSeq Reporter software (Illumina) - bioinformatics tool for sequencing analysis
    - Illumina Variant Studio version 2.2 - variant annotation software
    - JMP Pro 16.1 (SAS Institute) - statistical analysis software
    - R version 4.3.1 - programming language for statistical analysis
    - irr package - R package for inter-rater reliability
    - sample size package - R package for sample size calculations
    - Illumina custom panel - genetic reagent for targeted sequencing
    
    MEDIUM PRIORITY (consider adding):
    - DAKO autostainer Link48 - automated laboratory platform
    - SZ60 dissecting microscope (Olympus) - laboratory equipment
    
    The 7 suggested patterns should be implemented to improve future mining accuracy, particularly 
    for antibody clones, software with version numbers, and R packages. The 6 scientific observations 
    provide valuable usage information and performance data for the validated tools.
