    This is a 1982 pathology study using immunohistochemistry to detect S-100 protein in various tumor types.
    Expected tools include:
    - Antibodies (anti-S-100 antibody for immunohistochemical detection)
    - Potentially tissue samples/specimens (though these are typically not considered "tools")
    
    The study uses "peroxidase-antiperoxidase immunohistochemical method" which requires specific antibodies
    and reagents, but only the abstract is available for analysis.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory pathology study that would typically use research tools, specifically antibodies
    for immunohistochemical detection of S-100 protein. The study design involves experimental analysis
    of tumor specimens using established immunohistochemical methods. However, only the abstract is available,
    limiting detailed tool identification. The lack of Methods section makes it difficult to identify
    specific reagents, antibodies, or protocols used.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined from this publication despite clear use of immunohistochemical methods
    - Only abstract available - no Methods section to provide detailed tool information
    - Publication from 1982 may have different reporting standards for reagent details
    - Clear evidence of antibody usage (S-100 detection) but not explicitly stated in mineable format
  recommendations: |
    This publication clearly describes laboratory research using immunohistochemical methods, which requires
    specific antibodies and reagents. The mining system missed these tools, likely because:
    1. Only abstract was available (no detailed Methods section)
    2. 1982 publication may not follow modern reagent reporting standards
    3. Tools were described functionally rather than by specific product names
    
    Recommendations:
    - Add patterns to detect immunohistochemical methods as indicators of antibody usage
    - Consider protein detection contexts as evidence of corresponding antibodies
    - Improve pattern matching for older publications with different reporting styles
    - Manual review recommended to determine if S-100 antibody should be added retroactively
    
    No observations could be extracted due to lack of Results/Discussion sections.
    The abstract only provides methodology and general findings without specific quantitative data.
