    Review Article → Typically does not contain actual research tools, but may reference tools from other studies.
    
    Since this is a review article about NF1 therapeutic targets without Methods or Results sections,
    it would not be expected to contain experimental research tools like antibodies, cell lines, 
    animal models, or genetic reagents. Any mentions of NF1/NF2 would likely refer to the disease
    or genes rather than actual research tools.
    
    Review articles may occasionally mention computational tools used for analysis or clinical
    assessment tools in the context of discussing other studies, but would not typically use
    these tools experimentally themselves.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a review article about NF1 therapeutic targets that lacks experimental Methods and Results
    sections, indicating it does not report original research involving laboratory tools. Review articles
    typically synthesize existing literature rather than conducting new experiments, so research tools
    would not be expected. Any gene/disease mentions (NF1, NF2) would refer to the condition rather
    than experimental reagents.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a review article about NF1 therapeutic targets, not original research
    - No Methods section present, indicating no experimental procedures
    - No Results section present, indicating no experimental findings
    - Publication type does not support the presence of research tools
    - Any NF1/NF2 mentions would refer to disease/genes, not experimental tools
  recommendations: |
    This publication should not be expected to contain research tools since it is a review article
    without experimental methods. The mining correctly identified zero tools. Review articles
    synthesize existing literature rather than report new experimental work, so the absence of
    tools is appropriate and expected. No further action needed for this publication.
