    Review Article → Typically does not contain actual research tools used by the authors.
    Review articles discuss and cite tools from other studies but do not typically use
    antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids,
    PDX models, or clinical assessment tools in original experiments. They may mention
    tools in the context of discussing other research, but these would be citations
    rather than actual tool usage.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a review article discussing emerging therapeutic targets for NF1, as evidenced
    by the title and the lack of Methods, Results, and Discussion sections. Review articles
    typically do not conduct original experiments and therefore do not use research tools
    directly. Any tool mentions would likely be citations from other studies rather than
    actual tool usage by the authors.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a review article, not original research
    - No Methods section indicating experimental procedures
    - No Results or Discussion sections with experimental findings
    - Limited text content available (only Abstract and Introduction)
    - No tools were mined, which is appropriate for a review article
  recommendations: |
    This publication should not be expected to contain research tools as it is a review article.
    The absence of mined tools is correct and appropriate. Review articles discuss therapeutic
    targets and cite tools from other studies but do not typically use tools in original
    experiments. No further action needed - the mining results are accurate for this
    publication type. This publication could be excluded from future tool mining efforts
    as review articles are not primary sources of research tool usage.
