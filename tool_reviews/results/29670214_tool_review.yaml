  majorIssuesFound: |
    Critical mining failure - this comprehensive laboratory research publication contains numerous 
    research tools that were completely missed by the initial mining:
    - 0 tools were initially mined despite this being a substantial lab research paper
    - Multiple antibodies with full vendor information were not detected
    - Cell lines including patient-derived primary cultures were missed
    - Genetic reagents including plasmids, siRNAs, and synthetic constructs were not found
    - Computational tools with URLs (ImageJ) were not caught
    - Advanced cellular models (structured PDMS substrates) were not detected
    - Patient-derived models (primary fibroblasts from NF1 patients) were missed
    - Commercial reagents and kits with vendor information were not found
  recommendations: |
    URGENT: Complete overhaul of mining patterns needed for this publication type.
    
    1. **Immediate Action Required**: All 15+ identified tools should be manually added to the database
    2. **Pattern Enhancement**: Implement the 9 suggested patterns to catch similar tools in future mining
    3. **Vendor Detection**: Improve patterns to catch tools with vendor information in parentheses
    4. **Cell Line Patterns**: Add patterns for alphanumeric cell line codes and patient-derived lines
    5. **Antibody Patterns**: Enhance detection of "Anti-" prefix antibodies with vendor info
    6. **Software URLs**: Add patterns to catch software with web URLs
    7. **Substrate Detection**: Add patterns for specialized culture substrates (PDMS, hydrogels)
    8. **Patient-Derived Models**: Improve detection of primary cultures from patient samples
    9. **Quality Control**: This represents a major gap - similar lab research papers likely have similar missing tools
    
    The observations extracted demonstrate functional rescue experiments and provide valuable 
    scientific insights about neurofibromin replacement therapy. This publication is a rich 
    source of both tools and scientific observations that were completely missed by initial mining.
