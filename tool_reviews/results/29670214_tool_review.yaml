  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple categories of research tools are clearly present in the Methods section
    - Mining patterns appear to be missing key tool types used in molecular biology
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The study uses cell lines (Sf21, DH10Multibac), genetic reagents (synNF1, pFastBacHta, siRNAs),
    antibodies (anti-ERK1/2, anti-GAPDH), and computational tools (ImageJ). All 12 potentially
    missed tools should be added as they represent genuine research tools with clear experimental
    usage context. The suggested patterns would help capture similar tools in future mining.
    No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated.
