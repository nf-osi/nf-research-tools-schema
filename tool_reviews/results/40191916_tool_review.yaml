  likelyContainsTools: Yes
  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a bioinformatics analysis focused on genome assembly and analysis, so computational tools are expected:
    - Computational tools (sequencing platforms, assembly software, analysis pipelines)
    - Animal models (the Wisconsin Miniature Swine itself as a biomedical model)
    - Genetic reagents (DNA extraction kits, sequencing libraries)
    
    The publication describes developing a genome assembly for a swine model, so both the computational tools used for assembly/analysis and the animal model itself are relevant research tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication describes genome sequencing and assembly of Wisconsin Miniature Swine, which involves extensive use of computational tools for sequencing, assembly, and analysis. The swine model itself is also a research tool being characterized. The comprehensive Methods section indicates substantial tool usage across sequencing platforms, bioinformatics software, and analysis pipelines.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a methods-heavy bioinformatics publication
    - The publication contains extensive computational tool usage with specific versions and repositories
    - The Wisconsin Miniature Swine model itself is a research tool that should be captured
    - Many standard bioinformatics tools are mentioned with version numbers indicating active usage
  recommendations: |
    This publication should have captured many computational tools and the animal model:
    - The Wisconsin Miniature Swine is a legitimate animal model research tool being characterized
    - Multiple bioinformatics tools with version numbers indicate active computational analysis
    - Tools with GitHub repositories and specific versions are strong indicators of tool usage
    - The mining patterns need improvement to capture bioinformatics workflows and animal models
    - All 20 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine research tool usage
    - No observations were extracted as no tools were initially validated, but the genome assembly results could provide technical observations about the tools' performance
