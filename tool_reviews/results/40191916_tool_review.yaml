  likelyContainsTools: Yes
  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on this being a genome assembly and bioinformatics analysis study, expected tool types include:
    - Computational tools (genome assembly software, bioinformatics pipelines, analysis tools)
    - Genetic reagents (DNA extraction kits, sequencing library preparation kits)
    - Animal models (Wisconsin Miniature Swine™ as the research subject and biomedical model)
    
    This publication focuses on developing genomic resources for a biomedical research model, so it primarily
    contains computational tools for genome assembly and analysis, along with the animal model itself.
    Clinical assessment tools are not expected in this type of genomics study.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a genome assembly and bioinformatics study that extensively uses computational tools for sequencing
    data processing, genome assembly, and comparative genomics analysis. The publication describes the development
    of genomic resources for the Wisconsin Miniature Swine™ biomedical research model. Multiple computational
    tools and genetic reagents are used throughout the methodology, making this a tool-rich publication that
    should have captured numerous research tools during mining.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Complete failure to capture any tools despite this being a tool-rich bioinformatics publication
    - 20+ computational tools with specific versions were used but not detected
    - Multiple genetic reagents (DNA extraction kits, sequencing kits) were missed
    - The main research subject (Wisconsin Miniature Swine™ animal model) was not captured
    - No Results or Discussion sections available to extract scientific observations
  recommendations: |
    This publication represents a significant mining failure - despite being a computational genomics study
    with extensive tool usage, zero tools were captured. The paper uses 20+ computational tools with
    specific versions, multiple commercial genetic reagents, and describes a proprietary animal model.
    
    Key recommendations:
    1. Implement the suggested patterns to capture versioned software tools
    2. Add patterns for commercial kits with vendor information in parentheses
    3. Include patterns for animal model names with trademark symbols
    4. Add context-based patterns for computational tool usage phrases
    5. Consider git commit hash patterns for development tools
    
    The mining system needs significant improvement to handle bioinformatics publications effectively.
    All 24 missed tools should be added to improve coverage of genomics and computational biology studies.
