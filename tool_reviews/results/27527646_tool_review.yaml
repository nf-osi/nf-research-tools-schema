    Clinical Study → clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, scales, cognitive tests)
    This publication specifically focuses on evaluating and recommending standardized cognitive 
    assessment tools for NF clinical trials. The abstract mentions specific assessment instruments
    including the Digit Span subtest from Wechsler scales and Conners scales, which are validated
    clinical assessment tools used for cognitive evaluation.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a methodological/recommendation paper that evaluates cognitive assessment tools for use
    in NF clinical trials. The publication specifically reviews and compares various performance 
    measures and behavioral rating questionnaires, making specific recommendations for standardized
    tools. Clinical assessment tools are highly expected and should be present.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Mining completely missed clinical assessment tools despite this being a methodological paper
      specifically about cognitive assessment tool evaluation and recommendations
    - Three major clinical assessment tools were explicitly mentioned and evaluated:
      Digit Span subtest, Wechsler scales, and Conners scales
    - The abstract clearly states these tools were "reviewed" and "given highest ratings"
      indicating systematic evaluation of assessment instruments
    - No tools were detected despite clear presence of validated clinical assessment instruments
  recommendations: |
    This publication represents a significant mining failure for clinical assessment tools.
    The paper explicitly evaluates and recommends specific cognitive assessment instruments
    for use in NF clinical trials. All three missed tools should be added:
    
    1. Digit Span subtest - specific cognitive performance measure
    2. Wechsler scales - comprehensive cognitive assessment battery  
    3. Conners scales - behavioral rating questionnaire for attention
    
    The suggested patterns should be implemented to catch similar assessment tools in
    methodological and clinical research papers. This type of tool evaluation/recommendation
    paper is exactly where clinical assessment tools should be reliably detected.
    
    No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated, but the
    publication does contain evaluative information about the psychometric properties
    and utility of these assessment tools that could be valuable for researchers.
