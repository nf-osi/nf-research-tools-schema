    This is primarily a review article that catalogs purinergic receptor expression, but contains some original experimental data:
    - Cell lines: The authors mention "cultured mouse Schwann cells (SCs)" which indicates use of primary cell cultures
    - Computational tools: qPCR is mentioned for analyzing receptor expression
    - Animal models: Mouse-derived cells are used (embryonic day E12.5-derived cultured mouse SCs)
    
    While primarily a review, the authors performed original qPCR experiments to catalog purinergic receptor mRNA expression in cultured mouse Schwann cells, indicating some experimental work was conducted.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication is primarily a review article that synthesizes existing literature on purinergic signaling in peripheral nervous system glial cells. However, it contains original experimental data where the authors performed qPCR analysis on cultured mouse Schwann cells to catalog purinergic receptor expression. The experimental component involves cell culture techniques and molecular biology methods, suggesting some research tools were likely used but not captured in the mining process.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were mined from this publication despite containing experimental data
    - Publication is primarily a review but includes original qPCR experiments on cultured cells
    - Mining patterns failed to capture primary cell culture systems and molecular biology techniques
    - The experimental component involves cell culture and qPCR analysis that should have been detected
  recommendations: |
    This publication demonstrates a significant gap in mining coverage for review articles that contain original experimental data. While primarily a review, the authors performed qPCR analysis on cultured mouse Schwann cells, representing legitimate research tools that were completely missed. The mining patterns should be enhanced to:
    1. Capture primary cell culture systems (cultured mouse Schwann cells)
    2. Detect molecular biology techniques when used experimentally (qPCR)
    3. Identify co-culture systems as specialized research tools
    4. Better handle publications that combine review content with original experimental data
    
    All 4 potentially missed tools should be added to improve future mining accuracy, particularly for hybrid review/experimental publications.
