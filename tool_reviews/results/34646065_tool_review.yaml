  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on this clinical retrospective study with genetic analysis:
    - Computational tools: Statistical software (SPSS), genetic analysis tools
    - Genetic reagents: PCR primers, TaqMan assays for NF1 copy-number analysis
    - Clinical assessment tools: Potentially survival assessment scales or staging systems
    
    This study combines clinical data collection with molecular genetic analysis, so both
    computational tools for statistics and genetic reagents for mutation analysis are expected.
    The study also uses immunohistochemistry (S100B staining) which may involve antibodies.
  overallAssessment: |
    This clinical study includes substantial molecular genetic analysis components that would
    require research tools. The Methods section describes NF1 gene mutation analysis using
    PCR, Sanger sequencing, and TaqMan copy-number assays, indicating use of genetic reagents.
    Statistical analysis using SPSS software is also described. While primarily a clinical
    study, the genetic analysis component makes research tools highly likely.

      The frequency of whole-gene deletions (14.8%) detected in the 27 germline NF1 mutations
      associated with MPNSTs was higher than the 4-5% rate typically seen in general NF1 patient
      population. This finding supports previous reports that individuals with such deletions
      have greater risk for MPNSTs, possibly related to increased plexiform neurofibroma burden.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite clear evidence of research tool usage
    - Statistical software (SPSS 25) with version and vendor information was missed
    - Genetic reagents (TaqMan assays) with specific catalog numbers were missed
    - Molecular techniques (PCR, Sanger sequencing) were not captured
    - Immunohistochemistry reagents (S100B antibody) were not identified
    - Statistical analysis methods (Kaplan-Meier) were not recognized as computational tools
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains several genuine research tools that were completely missed by
    the initial mining process. The most critical omissions are:
    
    1. SPSS 25 - Clear computational tool with version and vendor information
    2. TaqMan NF1 copy-number assays - Specific genetic reagents with catalog numbers
    
    These tools should definitely be added to the database. The molecular techniques (PCR,
    Sanger sequencing) and statistical methods (Kaplan-Meier) represent borderline cases
    that may warrant inclusion depending on tool definition scope.
    
    The mining patterns need significant improvement to capture:
    - Statistical software with version numbers
    - Genetic reagents with vendor/catalog information
    - Immunohistochemistry antibodies
    - Statistical analysis methods as computational tools
    
    Three high-quality scientific observations were extracted, primarily focusing on tool
    usage instructions and performance characteristics in the context of NF1/MPNST research.
