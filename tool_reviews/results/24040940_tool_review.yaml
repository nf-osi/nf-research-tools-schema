  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining failed to capture any tools despite this being a clear lab research publication
    - Multiple cell lines (NF96.2, NF02.2, NF94.3) with ATCC source were missed
    - Antibodies with clear vendor/catalog information were not detected
    - Specialized bioinformatics tools (XenoBase, PGSEA, CMAP) were not captured
    - Microarray platforms were not recognized as genetic reagents
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    All 10 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine research tools used
    in the experimental methods. The suggested patterns would significantly improve detection of
    MPNST cell lines, antibodies with catalog numbers, and specialized bioinformatics tools.
    No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated, but the Results section
    likely contains valuable phenotypic data about drug resistance and molecular characteristics.
