    Clinical Study → clinical assessment tools, possibly computational tools for analysis
    
    This is a multi-center clinical study analyzing autism traits in NF1 patients using validated
    assessment instruments. Expected tools include:
    - Clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, scales) for measuring autism and ADHD symptoms
    - Computational tools for statistical analysis (factor analysis, mixture modeling, correlation analysis)
    
    Note: Clinical studies often have different structure than lab research - assessment tools are
    valid research tools even without traditional Methods sections.
  overallAssessment: |
    This clinical study would definitely use research tools, specifically validated clinical assessment
    instruments for measuring autism and ADHD symptoms in a large patient cohort (n=531). The study
    mentions specific standardized scales and sophisticated statistical analyses that would require
    computational tools. Clinical assessment tools are legitimate research tools even in the absence
    of traditional laboratory methods.

      SRS-2 T scores were continuously distributed and pathologically shifted in the NF1 cohort.
      13.2% (95% CI, 10.3%-16.1%) of individuals scored within the most severe range (above the
      first percentile of the general population distribution). T scores of ≥75 were associated
      with categorical ASD diagnosis. The first principal component explained 30.9% of the
      variance in SRS-2 scores, demonstrating robust unitary factor structure.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Mining completely missed clinical assessment tools despite this being a clinical study
    - No tools were initially mined from a publication that clearly uses validated assessment instruments
    - Mining patterns appear to be heavily biased toward laboratory research tools
    - Statistical analysis methods (computational tools) were also missed
  recommendations: |
    This publication should have captured at least 2-4 research tools:
    - Social Responsiveness Scale, second edition (SRS-2) - DEFINITELY should be added
    - Conners Rating Scale - DEFINITELY should be added  
    - Statistical analysis methods (mixture modeling, PCA) - POSSIBLY should be added
    
    The mining system needs better patterns for clinical assessment tools, which are legitimate
    research tools widely used in clinical research. The complete absence of mined tools from
    this clinical study indicates a significant gap in mining coverage for clinical research.
    
    Key improvements needed:
    1. Add patterns for validated clinical assessment scales and questionnaires
    2. Include T-score threshold patterns as indicators of standardized instruments
    3. Consider statistical analysis methods as computational tools in clinical studies
    4. Expand beyond laboratory-focused tool mining to include clinical research tools
    
    The observations extracted demonstrate meaningful scientific findings about tool performance
    and characteristics that would be valuable for the research community.
