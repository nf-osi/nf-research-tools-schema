    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    
    This is a molecular biology/cell biology study investigating mTOR signaling in NF2-deficient meningioma models.
    Expected tools include: cell lines (meningioma models), antibodies (for immunoblotting), genetic reagents 
    (vectors, constructs), and computational tools (RNA-seq analysis software). The extensive Methods section
    confirms experimental lab work with multiple tool categories present.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a classic laboratory research publication with extensive experimental methods including cell culture,
    genetic manipulation, RNA-seq, immunoblotting, and drug screening. The Methods section is comprehensive and
    describes detailed protocols using numerous research tools. Tools are absolutely expected and essential for
    this type of molecular biology research. The publication should contain multiple tool types across cell lines,
    antibodies, genetic reagents, and computational tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Mining completely failed - 0 tools extracted from a publication with 80+ research tools
    - Publication has extensive Methods section with detailed experimental procedures
    - Multiple tool categories present: cell lines, antibodies, genetic reagents, computational tools
    - Clear laboratory research with molecular biology, cell culture, RNA-seq, immunoblotting
    - Mining patterns appear inadequate for capturing standard research tools
    - Cell line names (Ben-Men-1, NF2 AC-CRISPR, MN1-LF) not captured
    - Antibody targets not recognized as antibodies despite clear context
    - Genetic reagents (vectors, constructs) not captured
    - Computational tools with versions not captured
    - Supplier information present but not utilized for tool identification
  recommendations: |
    - URGENT: Complete overhaul of mining patterns needed
    - All 15+ identified tools should be added to the database
    - Implement suggested patterns to capture similar tools in future mining
    - Focus on context phrases like "cell lines included", "antibodies recognizing"
    - Add vendor-based patterns for antibody identification
    - Capture software tools with version numbers
    - This publication represents a mining system failure requiring immediate attention
    - No observations extracted due to missing Results/Discussion sections in input
    - Consider expanding input to include full text sections for observation extraction
