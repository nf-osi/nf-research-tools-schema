  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on publication type (Bioinformatics Analysis):
    - Computational tools (software, packages, databases, pipelines) - PRIMARY EXPECTATION
    - Possibly some databases and web applications for analysis
    
    This is a pure bioinformatics study using publicly available datasets (GSE108524, GSE141801)
    to identify hub genes and drug candidates. The study involves multiple computational analyses
    including weighted correlation network analysis, differential expression analysis, pathway
    enrichment, protein-protein interaction analysis, and drug connectivity mapping.
    
    No lab research tools (antibodies, cell lines, animal models) are expected since this is
    a computational analysis of existing datasets.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a bioinformatics study that should contain multiple computational tools and databases.
    The abstract explicitly mentions several R packages, databases, and analytical methods used
    for gene expression analysis, network construction, and drug discovery. Despite being classified
    as "bench" research, this is purely computational work that would not use traditional lab tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    Major issues found during review:
    - Complete failure to mine computational tools from a bioinformatics study
    - Multiple explicitly mentioned R packages, databases, and analytical methods were missed
    - The mining patterns appear inadequate for capturing bioinformatics tools
    - Abstract contains clear usage context for 6-7 computational tools that should have been captured
    - This represents a significant gap in computational tool mining capabilities
  recommendations: |
    Overall recommendations for this publication:
    - All 6-7 missed computational tools should be added to the mining results
    - This publication demonstrates major gaps in computational tool mining patterns
    - Need better patterns for R packages (especially those in quotes)
    - Need better patterns for bioinformatics databases (STRING, miRTarBase, etc.)
    - Need patterns for standard resources (Gene Ontology, KEGG)
    - Consider case-insensitive matching for database names
    - The "bench" query classification was misleading - this is pure computational work
    - No traditional lab tools are expected or present in this bioinformatics analysis
    - Mining patterns should be updated to capture the suggested patterns above
    - This publication should be re-processed with improved computational tool patterns
