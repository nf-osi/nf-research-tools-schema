  expectedToolTypes: |
    Cannot assess expected tool types due to empty input file.
    The file 35066574_input.json exists in the inputs directory but contains no data.
    This represents a data processing issue rather than a publication analysis problem.
  overallAssessment: |
    The input file for PMID 35066574 exists but is completely empty. This prevents any analysis of the publication
    content, tool mining results, or validation of research tools. This appears to be a data processing or file
    generation issue that needs to be addressed at the data pipeline level.

toolValidations: []  # No tools to validate - empty input file

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Input file 35066574_input.json is completely empty
    - No publication metadata available for analysis
    - No abstract, methods, or other sections present
    - No mined tools to validate
    - This represents a data pipeline failure rather than a publication analysis issue
  recommendations: |
    This case requires data pipeline investigation rather than tool validation:
    
    1. **Data Pipeline Issue** - The empty file suggests a problem in the publication data extraction
       or file generation process for PMID 35066574
    
    2. **File Generation Problem** - Check the upstream processes that should populate this JSON file
       with publication metadata, abstract, sections, and mined tools
    
    3. **Quality Control** - Implement checks to identify empty input files before tool validation
    
    4. **Reprocessing Needed** - PMID 35066574 should be reprocessed through the data pipeline
       to generate proper input file content
    
    5. **No Tool Validation Possible** - Cannot perform meaningful tool validation without publication
       content and mining results
    
    This file should be flagged for data pipeline review and reprocessing rather than tool validation.
