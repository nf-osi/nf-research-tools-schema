  expectedToolTypes: |
    Review articles typically do not contain research tools as they synthesize existing literature
    rather than report original experimental work. They may cite tools used in other studies but
    do not use tools themselves. The absence of Methods, Results, and Discussion sections confirms
    this is a literature review rather than an experimental study. Review articles focus on
    summarizing and interpreting published research rather than conducting new experiments.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is clearly a review article that discusses the structure and function of neurofibromin
    and its role in NF1. Review articles synthesize existing literature and do not conduct original
    experiments, so they would not be expected to use research tools directly. Any tool mentions
    would likely be citations from other studies rather than actual tool usage.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a review article, not original research
    - No Methods section present, confirming lack of experimental work
    - No Results or Discussion sections with experimental findings
    - Abstract focuses on summarizing existing knowledge rather than reporting new experiments
    - Title uses "review" language ("beyond the GAP") suggesting comprehensive overview
  recommendations: |
    This publication should be excluded from tool mining as it is a review article that does not
    conduct original experimental work. Review articles may mention tools from other studies but
    do not use tools themselves. The mining algorithm correctly identified zero tools, which is
    appropriate for this publication type. Future mining should consider filtering out review
    articles or treating them separately, as they have fundamentally different content patterns
    than experimental research papers. No manual curator review is needed as the absence of tools
    is correct for this publication type.
