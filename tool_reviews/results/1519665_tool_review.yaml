    This is a methods development paper for in situ hybridization technique using digoxigenin-labeled 
    oligonucleotide probes. Expected tools include:
    - Genetic reagents (oligonucleotide probes, digoxigenin-11-dUTP)
    - Potentially antibodies (for digoxigenin detection, though not explicitly mentioned)
    - Tissue samples (though these are pathology specimens, not research models)
    
    The paper describes synthesis of DNA probes for specific genes and application to tissue sections,
    indicating active tool development and usage rather than just citations.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research publication describing the development and optimization of a 
    nonradioactive in situ hybridization technique. The authors synthesized specific oligonucleotide 
    probes and applied them to tissue sections, indicating active tool development and experimental usage. 
    Despite lacking a formal Methods section (common for older publications), the abstract describes 
    clear experimental procedures and tool applications that would typically contain research tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    Major issues found during review:
    - No tools were mined from this publication despite clear evidence of genetic reagent usage
    - Multiple specific oligonucleotide probes were synthesized and used but not detected
    - Digoxigenin-11-dUTP labeling reagent was missed
    - Control probes (nonsense sequences) were not detected
    - This represents a significant mining failure for genetic reagents in older publications
  recommendations: |
    Overall recommendations for this publication:
    - This publication should have yielded 7 genetic reagent tools but none were detected
    - The mining patterns need significant improvement for detecting genetic reagents, especially:
      * Oligonucleotide probes and DNA probes
      * Digoxigenin labeling reagents
      * Gene-specific probe nomenclature
      * Control reagents (nonsense sequences)
    - Consider that older publications (1992) may use different terminology than modern papers
    - The abstract-only format may require different parsing strategies
    - All 7 potentially missed tools should be added to improve database completeness
    - The suggested patterns would significantly improve genetic reagent detection
    - No observations could be extracted due to lack of Results/Discussion sections
