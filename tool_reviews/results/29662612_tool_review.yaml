  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a laboratory research publication focused on molecular biology, cell biology, yeast genetics, and cancer research.
    Expected tool types include:
    - Cell lines (mammalian cancer cell lines, immortalized cell lines)
    - Animal models (genetically modified yeast strains as NF1 disease models)
    - Antibodies (for immunofluorescence, western blotting, flow cytometry)
    - Genetic reagents (plasmids, siRNA, genomic libraries)
    - Computational tools (image analysis, statistical analysis, flow cytometry analysis, microarray analysis)
    
    The publication has extensive Methods section describing experimental procedures using multiple tool categories.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication is a comprehensive laboratory research study investigating mechanisms of NF1 deficiency using multiple experimental approaches.
    The study clearly uses and develops research tools across multiple categories. The extensive Methods section describes detailed protocols
    for cell culture, yeast genetics, immunofluorescence, western blotting, flow cytometry, microarray analysis, and metabolic profiling.
    This type of publication should contain numerous validated research tools, making the complete absence of mined tools a significant oversight.

    - CRITICAL MINING FAILURE: No tools were mined from this publication despite it being a comprehensive laboratory research study
    - Publication contains extensive Methods section with detailed experimental protocols
    - Multiple clear research tools present: 3 cell lines, 5 yeast strains, 10 antibodies, 3 genetic reagents, 8 computational tools
    - All tools have clear experimental usage context with vendor information, catalog numbers, and detailed protocols
    - This represents a complete failure of the mining system for a tool-rich publication
  recommendations: |
    - ALL 28 identified tools should be added to the database - they represent clear, validated research tools
    - The mining patterns need significant improvement to capture standard laboratory tools
    - Cell line nomenclature (U87-MG, U251-MG) should be recognized
    - Yeast strain patterns (MLY, MDW prefixes) need to be added
    - Antibody patterns with catalog numbers and vendor info should be captured
    - Common computational tools (ImageJ, Prism, FlowJo) should be recognized
    - siRNA with catalog numbers should be captured as genetic reagents
    - This publication demonstrates the need for comprehensive pattern updates across all tool categories
    - The 8 suggested patterns should be implemented to prevent similar mining failures
    - Scientific observations were successfully extracted for validated tools, showing experimental usage and effectiveness
