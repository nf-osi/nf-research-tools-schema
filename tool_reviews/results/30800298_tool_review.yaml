  title: "The impact of plexiform neurofibromas on adults with neurofibromatosis type 1: A qualitative study"
  queryType: "clinical"
  publicationType: "Qualitative Study"
  publicationTypeConfidence: 0.95
  hasMethodsSection: Yes
  likelyContainsTools: No
  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a qualitative study examining patient experiences and the psychosocial impact of plexiform 
    neurofibromas in adults with NF1. Expected tool types for this publication type:
    
    - Clinical assessment tools: Potentially validated questionnaires or interview guides for measuring 
      quality of life, psychological impact, or patient-reported outcomes
    - Computational tools: Possibly qualitative data analysis software (NVivo, ATLAS.ti, etc.)
    
    NOT expected:
    - Lab research tools (antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, organoids, PDX)
    - These are not relevant for qualitative interview-based studies
    
    Note: Qualitative studies typically use interview guides, thematic analysis frameworks, or 
    validated psychosocial assessment instruments rather than laboratory research tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    This qualitative study focuses on patient experiences and psychosocial impacts, which would not 
    typically involve laboratory research tools. The study design suggests interviews or surveys to 
    understand patient perspectives, potentially using validated clinical assessment tools for measuring 
    quality of life or psychological outcomes. No laboratory methods or experimental procedures would 
    be expected in this type of research.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a qualitative study examining patient experiences, not laboratory research
    - No research tools were mined, which is appropriate for this publication type
    - Qualitative studies use different types of research instruments (interview guides, analysis frameworks) 
      that may not be captured by mining patterns designed for laboratory tools
    - The absence of mined tools is correct and expected for this study design
  recommendations: |
    - No tools need to be rejected since none were mined
    - This publication correctly identified as not containing traditional research tools
    - Consider expanding mining patterns to capture qualitative research instruments:
      * Interview guides and protocols
      * Qualitative analysis frameworks and software
      * Patient-reported outcome measures specific to qualitative research
    - The mining system performed correctly by not identifying false positive tools
    - Future improvements could include patterns for qualitative research methodology tools
    - No observations were extracted as this study focuses on patient experiences rather than 
      experimental findings about research tools
