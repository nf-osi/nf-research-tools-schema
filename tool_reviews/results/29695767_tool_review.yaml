  expectedToolTypes: |
    Review Article → Typically NO research tools expected
    - Review articles summarize existing literature and do not conduct original experiments
    - May cite tools used in other studies but do not use tools themselves
    - Focus is on synthesizing knowledge rather than generating new experimental data
    - Clinical assessment tools, lab reagents, and computational tools are not expected
    - Any tool mentions would likely be citations of other work, not actual usage

    Note: This publication discusses cNF biology, pathogenesis, clinical trials, and research directions
    but does not describe original experimental work that would require research tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive review article summarizing current understanding of cutaneous neurofibromas
    in NF1. Review articles typically do not use research tools as they synthesize existing literature
    rather than conduct original experiments. The absence of a Methods section confirms this is not
    an experimental study. Any research tools mentioned would be citations from other studies, not
    tools used by the authors.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a review article, not original research
    - No Methods section present, confirming lack of experimental procedures
    - No tools were mined, which is appropriate for this publication type
    - Abstract focuses on summarizing existing knowledge rather than reporting new experiments
  recommendations: |
    The mining results are CORRECT for this publication. Zero tools were appropriately identified
    because this is a review article that does not conduct original experiments. Review articles
    may mention tools used in other studies but do not use tools themselves. The mining algorithm
    correctly identified this as a non-experimental publication and did not extract false positive
    tool mentions. No action needed - the empty tool list is the expected and correct result.
