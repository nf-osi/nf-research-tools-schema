      Computer program successfully used for primer design for TBP, RPLP0, and 489 target genes.
      Primers were designed with assistance of this software to ensure gene specificity and avoid
      amplification of contaminating genomic DNA. Amplicons were designed to be between 70 and 120

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined from this publication despite it being a laboratory research study
    - Multiple computational tools and genetic reagents were missed during mining
    - Publication contains detailed Methods section with specific tool usage information
    - Mining patterns failed to detect commercial reagent kits, laboratory instruments, and software tools
    - Vendor information and model numbers were not captured by existing patterns
  recommendations: |
    This publication should have multiple tools added to the database:
    - 7 tools were potentially missed during initial mining
    - All missed tools have high confidence scores (0.85-0.95) and clear usage context
    - Tools include both computational tools (PCR systems, analysis software) and genetic reagents (enzyme kits, reagents)
    - New mining patterns should be implemented to catch similar tools in future publications
    - The study provides detailed usage instructions and protocols for each tool
    - 5 scientific observations were extracted showing successful tool usage and performance characteristics
    - This represents a significant gap in the mining system's ability to detect laboratory tools with vendor/model information
