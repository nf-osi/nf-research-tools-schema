    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a molecular profiling study using real-time RT-PCR to analyze gene expression in tumor samples.
    Expected tools include: computational tools (RT-PCR analysis software, statistical software), 
    genetic reagents (primers, probes), and potentially antibodies (S100 immunostaining mentioned).
    Clinical assessment tools unlikely given the molecular focus.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory-based molecular profiling study using real-time quantitative RT-PCR to analyze 489 genes
    in tumor samples. The comprehensive Methods section describes RNA extraction, primer design, PCR protocols,
    and statistical analysis, indicating active use of research tools rather than just citations.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a clear laboratory research study
    - Multiple research tools are explicitly mentioned in the Methods section with vendor information
    - The mining system missed standard molecular biology reagents and instruments
    - PCR-related tools (instruments, software, reagents) were not captured
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains multiple legitimate research tools that were completely missed by the initial mining.
    The tools found include PCR instruments, analysis software, primer design software, and molecular biology reagents.
    All have clear vendor information and are described in experimental context in the Methods section.
    The suggested patterns should help capture similar tools in future molecular biology publications.
    No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated as accepted.
