    This is a mass spectrometry-based proteomics study with immunohistochemistry validation. Expected tools include:
    - Computational tools for mass spectrometry data analysis (Spectronaut, R packages)
    - Antibodies for immunohistochemistry validation
    - Laboratory equipment and reagents for sample processing
    - Bioinformatics tools for Gene Ontology analysis
    
    Note: Publications can contain MULTIPLE tool types. This study combines wet lab techniques (mass spec, IHC) 
    with computational analysis, so both lab reagents and software tools are expected.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a clear laboratory research study using mass spectrometry proteomics and immunohistochemistry to compare 
    tumor and normal tissue. The study involves extensive wet lab methods and computational analysis, making it highly 
    likely to contain multiple research tools including antibodies, computational software, and laboratory reagents. 
    The detailed Methods section describes specific protocols that would require various research tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Mining system completely failed to detect any tools despite this being a tool-rich publication
    - Multiple high-confidence computational tools missed (Spectronaut, R, Xcalibur)
    - Several antibodies with clear catalog/clone information missed
    - Laboratory instruments and systems not detected
    - No patterns appear to exist for mass spectrometry software detection
    - Missing patterns for antibodies with clone information
  recommendations: |
    This publication represents a significant mining failure - zero tools were detected despite containing 
    at least 10 clear research tools. Major recommendations:
    
    1. IMMEDIATE PATTERN ADDITIONS NEEDED:
       - Software with vendor information in parentheses
       - Antibodies with clone designations
       - R packages with version numbers
       - Laboratory instrument model names
    
    2. TOOL CATEGORIES MISSED:
       - All computational tools (5+ missed)
       - All antibodies (3 missed)
       - Laboratory instruments (2+ missed)
    
    3. SYSTEMATIC ISSUES:
       - No patterns exist for mass spectrometry software
       - Antibody detection limited to basic "anti-" patterns
       - Version numbers not being captured
       - Vendor information not being used as tool indicators
    
    4. QUALITY CONTROL:
       - Publications with detailed Methods sections should trigger manual review if zero tools found
       - Proteomics/mass spectrometry studies should have computational tool requirements
    
    5. OBSERVATIONS:
       - Successfully extracted 5 usage instruction observations for the missed tools
       - All observations provide valuable protocol and application information
       - Demonstrates the scientific value of proper tool detection
    
    This case highlights critical gaps in the mining system that need immediate attention.
