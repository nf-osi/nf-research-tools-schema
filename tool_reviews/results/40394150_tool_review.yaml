  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple computational tools (mass spec software, statistical packages) were missed
    - Several antibodies used for immunohistochemistry validation were not captured
    - The mining appears to have missed tools with vendor/catalog information
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The study uses sophisticated mass spectrometry analysis software, statistical packages, and
    validation antibodies that should all be captured. The patterns suggested would help identify
    similar tools in proteomics studies. All potentially missed tools should be added as they
    represent genuine research reagents used in the experimental workflow. No observations were
    extracted since no tools were initially validated, but the Results section likely contains
    relevant findings about protein expression differences.
