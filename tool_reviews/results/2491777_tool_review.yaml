  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on publication type (genetic linkage mapping study):
    - genetic reagents (DNA probes, markers) - PRIMARY expected type
    - computational tools (linkage analysis software) - SECONDARY expected type
    
    This is a molecular genetics study from 1989 using DNA probes for linkage mapping.
    The study mentions multiple genetic markers/probes (HHH202, D17Z1, EW203, etc.)
    which are genetic reagents used for genotyping and linkage analysis.
    
    Note: While queryType is "bench", this is specifically a genetic mapping study,
    not typical lab bench work with antibodies/cell lines. The tools are genetic
    markers and potentially computational tools for lod score calculations.
  overallAssessment: |
    This 1989 genetic linkage mapping study would typically use genetic reagents (DNA probes/markers)
    and computational tools for linkage analysis. The study describes using multiple chromosome 17
    markers for genotyping families and calculating lod scores, which requires both molecular
    reagents and statistical analysis software. However, no tools were mined despite clear
    mentions of genetic markers like HHH202, D17Z1, EW203, etc.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: All genetic markers/probes were missed by mining (9 tools not detected)
    - Mining patterns completely failed to capture genetic reagent nomenclature from 1980s
    - Standard genetic mapping markers (D17Z1, D17S37, etc.) not recognized
    - Laboratory-specific probe names (HHH202, EW-series) not captured
    - Plasmid-based probes (pA10-41) not detected
    - Context phrases like "typed with probes" not triggering genetic reagent detection
  recommendations: |
    URGENT: This publication reveals major gaps in genetic reagent mining patterns.
    - ADD all 9 missed genetic markers as validated tools
    - IMPLEMENT suggested nomenclature patterns for D[chr]S/Z markers, EW-series, HHH-series, pA-series
    - ADD context phrase patterns like "typed with probes", "lod scores versus markers"
    - REVIEW other 1980s-1990s genetic mapping papers for similar missed tools
    - CONSIDER that genetic mapping studies are rich sources of genetic reagents
    - UPDATE mining to better capture historical genetic marker nomenclature
    - This represents a systematic failure to detect an entire class of genetic tools
