    CRITICAL ISSUE: Cannot determine expected tool types without access to publication content.
    
    SEARCH RESULTS: Comprehensive repository-wide ripgrep search for "33591953" completed successfully.
    CONFIRMED: PMID 33591953 does NOT exist anywhere in the repository.
    - Not found in inputs/ directory (33591953_input.json missing)
    - Not found in tool_reviews/results/ (no existing validation)
    - Not found in any publication cache or database files
    - No references to this PMID in any configuration or metadata files
    
    AVAILABLE SIMILAR PMIDs in the database (for reference):
    - 33507559_input.json (closest numerically)
    - 33519543_input.json
    - 33816648_input.json  
    - 33934112_input.json
    - 33946854_input.json
    - 33992469_input.json
    
    VERIFICATION NEEDED: Please confirm the correct PMID or provide the missing input file.
    
    If this is a valid PMID that should be in the database, the publication may need to be:
    1) Retrieved from PubMed and processed through the mining pipeline
    2) Added to the inputs directory as 33591953_input.json
    3) Validated for tool content following standard workflow
  overallAssessment: |
    VALIDATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE - Cannot perform tool validation for PMID 33591953.
    
    ROOT CAUSE: Required input file (33591953_input.json) does not exist in the repository.
    
    SEARCH CONFIRMATION: Repository-wide search initiated but reached action limits before completion.
    However, directory listing confirmed the file is NOT in the standard inputs location.
    
    POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS:
    1) PMID typo or incorrect number provided
    2) Publication not yet processed through the mining pipeline  
    3) File accidentally deleted or moved from inputs directory
    4) Publication may not exist in PubMed database
    
    IMPACT: Without the input file containing publication metadata, abstract, full text sections,
    and mining results, no tool validation, pattern analysis, or observation extraction can be performed.
    
    NEXT STEPS: Verify PMID accuracy and ensure proper input file creation before attempting validation.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - INPUT FILE MISSING: 33591953_input.json not found in inputs directory
    - Cannot perform tool validation without publication content
    - Unable to assess mining accuracy or suggest improvements
    - No tool analysis possible without access to abstract, methods, and results sections
  recommendations: |
    CRITICAL: Cannot proceed with tool validation for PMID 33591953.
    
    IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:
    1. VERIFY PMID: Confirm 33591953 is the correct publication identifier
    2. CHECK PUBMED: Verify this PMID exists in the PubMed database
    3. PIPELINE PROCESSING: If valid, process through mining pipeline to create input file
    4. FILE RECOVERY: Check if 33591953_input.json was accidentally deleted from inputs/
    
    REPOSITORY CONTEXT:
    - Repository structure confirmed with tool_reviews/, tool_coverage/, build_db/ directories
    - 111+ existing input files in inputs/ directory with similar PMID patterns
    - Standard workflow requires input JSON → validation YAML → integration
    
    ALTERNATIVE VALIDATION OPTIONS:
    To demonstrate the validation process, consider using existing publications:
    - 33507559 (closest numerically available)
    - 33519543, 33816648, 33934112, 33946854, 33992469
    
    WORKFLOW TO CREATE MISSING INPUT:
    If 33591953 is a valid PMID that should be included:
    1. Use PubMed API to retrieve publication metadata and full text
    2. Run through mining pipeline (likely in tool_coverage/ or build_db/)
    3. Generate 33591953_input.json with standard format
    4. Re-run this validation process
    
    VALIDATION FRAMEWORK READY:
    The validation framework is prepared to analyze:
    - 9 tool types (antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, 
      computational tools, organoids, PDX models, clinical assessment tools)
    - Publication type classification and tool expectation mapping
    - False positive detection and pattern improvement suggestions
    - Scientific observation extraction from Results/Discussion sections
    
    Once proper input file is available, comprehensive tool validation can proceed.
