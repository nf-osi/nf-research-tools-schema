  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on the publication type (Review Article about targeting Ras proteins in cancer):
    - Review articles typically cite tools from other studies but do not use them experimentally
    - May mention computational tools used for analysis or figure generation
    - Unlikely to contain lab research tools (antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents)
    - May reference clinical assessment tools from cited studies
    - Focus is on summarizing existing research rather than conducting new experiments

    Note: Without a Methods section, this publication is unlikely to describe experimental
    usage of research tools. Any tool mentions would likely be citations from other work.
  overallAssessment: |
    This appears to be a review article about targeting activated Ras proteins in cancer therapy.
    Review articles typically synthesize existing literature rather than conduct original experiments,
    making them unlikely sources of research tools. The absence of a Methods section strongly
    suggests no experimental work was performed, confirming this is not a primary research study
    that would use lab tools, animal models, or clinical assessment instruments.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a review article, not primary research
    - No Methods section indicating experimental work
    - No research tools were mined, which is appropriate for this publication type
    - Review articles typically cite tools from other studies rather than use them experimentally
  recommendations: |
    The mining results are appropriate for this publication type. Review articles about
    cancer therapeutics rarely contain research tools that would be used experimentally.
    Any tool mentions would likely be citations from primary research papers.
    
    Recommendations:
    - No tools need to be added or removed - the empty result is correct
    - Consider excluding review articles from future mining to focus on primary research
    - If review articles are included, focus on computational tools used for analysis/figures
    - The suggested patterns could help capture software mentioned in review methodology
    - No observations can be extracted since no tools were validated
