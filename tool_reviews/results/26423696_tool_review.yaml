  expectedToolTypes: |
    Review Article - Typically does not contain actual research tools used by the authors.
    Review articles discuss and cite tools from other studies but do not report original
    experimental work. Expected tool types would be minimal or none:
    - Computational tools: Unlikely, unless bioinformatics review with original analysis
    - Lab tools (antibodies, cell lines, animal models): Very unlikely
    - Clinical assessment tools: Very unlikely
    - Advanced cellular/patient-derived models: Very unlikely
    
    This publication appears to be a comprehensive review of Ras targeting strategies
    in cancer therapy, focusing on therapeutic approaches rather than research methodology.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is clearly a review article discussing therapeutic strategies for targeting Ras proteins
    in cancer. Review articles typically synthesize existing literature rather than report original
    experimental work, making research tool usage highly unlikely. The absence of Methods, Results,
    and Discussion sections confirms this is not an experimental study that would use research tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a review article, not original research
    - No Methods section indicating experimental work
    - Only abstract available, no full text sections
    - Content focuses on therapeutic strategies rather than research methodology
    - No experimental tools mentioned in the abstract
  recommendations: |
    This publication should be excluded from tool mining efforts as it is a review article
    that does not report original experimental work. Review articles discuss tools used
    by others but do not themselves use research tools. The mining algorithm correctly
    identified zero tools from this publication. No further action needed.
    
    For future mining: Consider filtering out review articles early in the process
    to avoid unnecessary processing. Review articles can be identified by:
    - Publication type metadata
    - Absence of Methods sections
    - Language patterns ("review", "comprehensive overview", "recent progress")
    - Focus on therapeutic strategies rather than experimental methods
