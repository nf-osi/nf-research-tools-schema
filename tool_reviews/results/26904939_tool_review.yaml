  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining failed to capture any tools despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple categories of research tools are extensively used but not detected
    - Mouse strain nomenclature (fl/fl, Cre) not recognized by current patterns
    - Antibodies with vendor information not caught
    - 3D culture systems (spheres) not detected
    - Genetic reagents (transposons, lentiviral vectors) missed
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains extensive use of research tools across multiple categories that were completely 
    missed by initial mining. The patterns suggested should significantly improve detection of:
    1. Conditional knockout mouse strains with (fl/fl) notation
    2. Cre recombinase transgenic mice
    3. Antibodies with anti- prefix and vendor information
    4. 3D sphere culture systems
    5. Genetic reagents from repositories like Addgene
    6. Transposon systems for mutagenesis
    All 13 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine research tools used in experiments.
