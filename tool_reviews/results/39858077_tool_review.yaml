  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on this being a mixed-methods clinical study examining medication adherence:
    - Clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, scales, outcome measures) - EXPECTED
    - Computational tools (statistical software for data analysis) - EXPECTED
    - Lab research tools (antibodies, cell lines, animal models) - NOT EXPECTED
    - Advanced cellular models or patient-derived models - NOT EXPECTED
    
    This is a clinical adherence study using validated questionnaires and technology-based monitoring,
    so clinical assessment tools and computational analysis tools are the primary expected categories.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a mixed-methods clinical study investigating medication adherence patterns in adults with NF1
    taking selumetinib. The study design includes validated questionnaires, custom assessment tools, 
    technology-based monitoring systems, and statistical analysis software. Clinical assessment tools
    are highly expected and appropriate for this publication type, even without traditional laboratory methods.

      PROMIS depression short form (8 items) demonstrated excellent internal reliability (α = 0.916–0.972).
      Raw scores were converted to T-scores (M = 50, SD = 10). Higher depression scores were correlated 
      with poorer MEMS™ adherence rates, suggesting depression may be a risk factor for medication 
      non-adherence in NF1 patients.

      Better adherence from MEMS™ and pill count data in cycles 1–4 was related to lower baseline

      adherence patterns in NF1 patients taking selumetinib.

      MEMS™ caps proved feasible for adherence monitoring in NF1 patients, with 91.7% of participants 
      completing at least the first two cycles. However, challenges included battery expiration (n=5), 
      forgetting to replace caps (n=1), cap malfunction (n=1), and one participant withdrawal due to 
      dislike of the system. Mean MEMS™ adherence rates were consistently lower than pill counts and 
      diaries by at least 12 percentage points across all time periods.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - SIGNIFICANT MINING FAILURE: This clinical study contains multiple validated clinical assessment tools 
      that were completely missed by the mining process
    - All PROMIS instruments (depression, pain interference, cognitive function) were missed despite being 
      well-known validated patient-reported outcome measures
    - Technology-based adherence monitoring system (MEMS™) was missed
    - Statistical analysis software (SPSS) was missed
    - Custom questionnaires developed for the study were missed
    - The mining appears to have failed to detect any tools despite this being a methods-rich clinical study
  recommendations: |
    - ALL 9 potentially missed tools should be added to the database - this represents a complete mining failure
    - The clinical assessment tool mining patterns need significant improvement to catch PROMIS instruments
    - Technology-based monitoring systems like MEMS™ should be included in clinical assessment tool patterns
    - Software version detection needs improvement (SPSS 29.0.1 should have been caught)
    - Custom questionnaires with clear descriptions should be detected
    - This publication demonstrates the need for better clinical assessment tool mining in adherence studies
    - The suggested patterns should be implemented to prevent similar mining failures in clinical studies
    - Quality control processes should flag publications with detailed methods sections but zero mined tools
