    Review articles typically do not contain research tools as they synthesize existing literature
    rather than report original experimental work. They may cite tools used in other studies but
    do not use tools themselves. This publication discusses mitochondrial metabolism in cancer
    from a theoretical perspective without experimental methods or tool usage.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive review article that synthesizes existing knowledge about mitochondrial
    metabolism in cancer cells. Review articles do not typically use research tools themselves,
    instead citing and discussing findings from other studies. The absence of a Methods section
    and the theoretical nature of the content confirm this is not an experimental study.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a review article, not original research
    - No Methods section present indicating no experimental work
    - Content is entirely theoretical/synthetic, discussing existing literature
    - No research tools are used or developed in this publication
  recommendations: |
    This publication should not be included in research tool databases as it is a review article
    that does not use, develop, or validate any research tools. The mining correctly identified
    zero tools, which is appropriate for this publication type. Review articles synthesize
    existing literature and may cite tools used in other studies, but they do not constitute
    tool usage themselves. No further action needed - the empty tool list is correct.
