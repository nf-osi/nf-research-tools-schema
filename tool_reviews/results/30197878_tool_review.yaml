  expectedToolTypes: |
    Cannot determine expected tool types due to missing input data.
    The input file (30197878_input.json) exists but contains no content.
    Without access to the publication metadata, abstract, or full text sections,
    it is impossible to assess what types of research tools might be present.
  overallAssessment: |
    Unable to perform tool validation due to empty input file. The file 30197878_input.json
    exists in the inputs directory but contains no publication data, metadata, abstract,
    or mined tools to evaluate. This represents a data pipeline issue that should be
    investigated and resolved before tool validation can proceed.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Critical Issue: Input file (30197878_input.json) is empty
    - No publication metadata available for analysis
    - No abstract or full text content to review
    - No mined tools to validate
    - Cannot perform any aspect of the tool validation workflow
  recommendations: |
    This publication cannot be processed for tool validation due to missing input data.
    Recommendations:
    1. Investigate why the input file is empty - possible data pipeline failure
    2. Re-extract publication data for PMID 30197878 from source
    3. Verify the publication exists and is accessible
    4. Re-run the tool mining process once valid input data is available
    5. Consider implementing data validation checks to catch empty input files
    6. This case should be flagged for manual investigation by the data pipeline team
