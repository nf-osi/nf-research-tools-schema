  hasMethodsSection: No  # Based on input data showing hasMethodsSection: false
  likelyContainsTools: Yes
  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on the title mentioning "β-III-spectrin immunohistochemistry", this appears to be a lab research study
    evaluating an immunohistochemical diagnostic approach. Expected tool types include:
    - Antibodies (β-III-spectrin antibody for immunohistochemistry)
    - Potentially tissue samples or cell lines for validation
    - Computational tools for image analysis or statistical analysis
    - Clinical assessment tools if diagnostic performance is evaluated
    
    The title suggests this is methodological research developing/validating a diagnostic tool,
    which would typically involve antibody-based immunohistochemistry protocols.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication appears to be lab-based research focused on developing β-III-spectrin immunohistochemistry
    as a diagnostic tool for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). Such studies typically involve
    extensive use of research tools including specific antibodies, tissue samples, and analytical methods.
    However, no publication content was available for analysis, preventing tool validation.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No publication content (abstract, methods, results, discussion) was available for analysis
    - Input file contained only metadata with empty text sections
    - No tools were mined, likely due to lack of content
    - Title suggests immunohistochemistry study which should contain antibody tools
    - Unable to perform comprehensive tool validation without full text access
  recommendations: |
    This publication requires re-processing to extract full text content before meaningful tool validation can occur.
    The title strongly suggests this is a lab research study involving β-III-spectrin immunohistochemistry, which
    would typically involve specific antibodies and potentially other research tools. Key recommendations:
    
    1. Re-extract publication content - abstract, methods, results, discussion sections
    2. Re-run tool mining pipeline with complete text
    3. Focus on antibody detection patterns for immunohistochemistry studies
    4. Look for tissue sample/specimen mentions in diagnostic validation studies
    5. Check for statistical analysis software used in diagnostic performance evaluation
    
    Without full text access, this review cannot provide meaningful validation of research tools.
    The publication should be flagged for content re-extraction and re-analysis.
