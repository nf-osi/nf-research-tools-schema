    Bioinformatics Analysis → computational tools (software, pipelines, databases)
    This publication focuses on computational prediction of NF1 mutation pathogenicity using multiple
    bioinformatics tools and databases. Expected tools include prediction software, structural modeling
    tools, and mutation databases. No lab research tools expected as this is purely computational.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a computational bioinformatics study using multiple prediction tools and databases to analyze
    NF1 mutations. The study employs sophisticated computational pipelines including PredictSNP, iStable,
    Align-GVGD, and AlphaFold3 for mutation impact prediction and structural modeling. Clinical assessment
    tools are not expected as this focuses on computational prediction rather than patient evaluation.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining failed to capture any computational tools despite this being a bioinformatics study
    - Multiple well-defined computational tools with URLs and version numbers were missed
    - Pattern matching appears insufficient for bioinformatics tool detection
    - Database resources (HGMD, ClinVar, UniProt) were not recognized as computational tools
  recommendations: |
    All 8 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent legitimate computational resources
    used in this bioinformatics analysis. The tools include prediction algorithms (PredictSNP2, iStable,
    Align-GVGD), structural modeling (AlphaFold3), mutation analysis (SNPeffect 4.0), and databases
    (HGMD, ClinVar, UniProt). Mining patterns need improvement for bioinformatics tool detection,
    particularly for web-based tools with URLs and version numbers. No observations extracted as
    Results/Discussion sections were not available.
