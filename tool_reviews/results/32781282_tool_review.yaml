    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a laboratory animal study using mouse models to investigate metabolic phenotypes in NF1.
    Expected tools include animal models (Nf1+/- mice), computational tools for data analysis,
    and potentially genetic reagents for genotyping.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study using mouse models to investigate metabolic phenotypes
    associated with NF1. The publication has a comprehensive Methods section describing experimental
    procedures including animal husbandry, metabolic testing, and tissue analysis. Research tools
    are highly expected, particularly animal models and computational analysis tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Initial mining failed to capture any tools despite this being a clear laboratory research study
    - Mouse model nomenclature (Nf1+/-, C57BL/6J) not recognized by current patterns
    - Specialized research instruments with vendor names missed
    - Standard heterozygous knockout notation not captured
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains multiple legitimate research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The Nf1+/- mouse model is the primary research tool and should definitely be added.
    Patterns for mouse strain nomenclature need significant improvement to capture heterozygous knockouts and inbred strains.
    Specialized research instruments should be captured when they have vendor names and model numbers.
    GraphPad Prism should be excluded as generic statistical software.
    The observations extracted show clear phenotypic characterization of the mouse model.
