  expectedToolTypes: |
    Review articles typically do not contain research tools as they summarize and synthesize 
    existing literature rather than report original experimental work. While review articles 
    may mention tools used in cited studies, they do not typically use tools themselves.
    
    This review focuses on genetic sequencing efforts and genomic technologies in MPNST research,
    so it might reference computational tools or sequencing platforms in passing, but would not
    be using them experimentally.
    
    Expected tool types: None (review article)
    Possible mentions: Computational tools (cited from other studies)
  overallAssessment: |
    This is clearly a review article that summarizes genetic sequencing efforts in MPNST research
    over three decades. Review articles synthesize existing literature rather than conduct original
    experiments, so they are unlikely to contain genuine research tools. Any tool mentions would
    likely be citations from other studies rather than experimental usage.

    examples: ["Here, we review", "This review summarizes", "We reviewed"]
    reasoning: "Review articles synthesize existing literature and rarely contain original research tools. Adding filters to exclude review articles would reduce false positives."

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a review article, not original research
    - Only abstract text available, no Methods/Results/Discussion sections
    - No experimental work described, only literature synthesis
    - Generic mentions of "genetic sequencing" and "genomic technologies" are too broad to be specific tools
  recommendations: |
    This publication should be excluded from tool mining efforts as it is a review article that
    synthesizes existing literature rather than conducting original research. Review articles may
    mention tools used in cited studies but do not use tools experimentally themselves.
    
    Key recommendations:
    1. Add filters to exclude review articles from tool mining pipelines
    2. Look for phrases like "Here, we review", "This review", "We reviewed" as exclusion criteria
    3. Publications without Methods sections and only abstracts are likely reviews or commentaries
    4. Focus tool mining efforts on original research articles with experimental methods
    
    No tools should be added from this publication as it contains no experimental tool usage.
    The mining correctly identified zero tools, which is the expected result for a review article.
