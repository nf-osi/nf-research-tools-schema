  queryType: "unknown"  # From PubMed query (hint only)

  hasMethodsSection: No
  likelyContainsTools: No
  expectedToolTypes: |
    Review Article → Typically contains NO research tools as these are secondary analyses of existing literature.
    Review articles summarize and synthesize findings from primary research but do not conduct original experiments.
    They may CITE tools used in other studies but do not USE tools themselves.
    
    Expected tool types for this publication type: None
    
    The abstract clearly states "Here, we review genetic sequencing efforts in human MPNST samples over the past three decades"
    indicating this is a literature review, not primary research.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is clearly a review article that synthesizes existing literature on the genetic landscape of MPNST over three decades.
    Review articles do not conduct original experiments and therefore do not use research tools directly.
    The absence of Methods, Introduction, and Results sections, combined with only Abstract and Discussion sections,
    strongly supports this being a review/commentary rather than primary research. No tools are expected or appropriate for this publication type.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a review article, not primary research
    - No Methods section indicating experimental work
    - Only Abstract and Discussion sections available (incomplete manuscript)
    - Review articles synthesize existing literature rather than using research tools
    - No experimental procedures described that would require tools
  recommendations: |
    This publication should be EXCLUDED from tool mining efforts because:
    
    1. **Publication Type**: This is a review article that synthesizes existing literature on MPNST genetics
       over three decades. Review articles do not conduct original experiments.
    
    2. **No Experimental Content**: The publication lacks Methods, Introduction, and Results sections,
       which are essential for identifying tool usage in primary research.
    
    3. **Appropriate Mining Result**: The mining algorithm correctly identified ZERO tools, which is
       the expected result for a review article.
    
    4. **No Tools Missed**: No research tools were missed because review articles don't use tools.
       They may cite tools from other studies, but citation ≠ usage.
    
    5. **Mining Strategy**: Review articles should be filtered out early in the mining pipeline
       to focus computational resources on primary research publications that actually use tools.
    
    6. **Quality Control**: This case demonstrates the mining system is working correctly by
       not generating false positives from a publication type that shouldn't contain tools.
    
    RECOMMENDATION: Mark this publication as "Review Article - No Tools Expected" and exclude
    from future tool mining efforts. Focus mining on primary research publications with
    experimental methods sections.
