  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on the title "Therapeutic targets in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours", this appears to be a review article focused on therapeutic targets rather than experimental research. Review articles typically:
    - Synthesize existing literature rather than report new experimental data
    - Discuss therapeutic targets conceptually without using specific research tools
    - May mention tools from other studies but don't use them experimentally
    - Lack Methods sections describing experimental procedures
    
    Expected tool types: None for experimental usage. May contain citations of tools from other studies, but these would be false positives for mining purposes since the tools are not being used in this publication.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication appears to be a review article about therapeutic targets in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs). Review articles typically synthesize existing literature and discuss concepts rather than report original experimental work. They rarely contain genuine research tools since they don't describe new experiments or methodologies. Any tool mentions would likely be citations from other studies rather than tools used by the authors. The absence of a Methods section strongly supports this being a review rather than an experimental study.

suggestedPatterns:
  - patternType: "context_phrase"
    pattern: "review of|systematic review|literature review|therapeutic targets|current understanding"
    toolType: "general"
    examples: ["therapeutic targets in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours"]
    reasoning: "These phrases could help identify review articles early in the mining process to avoid false positive tool extraction. Review articles should be flagged for different processing since they typically don't contain experimental tools."
  
  - patternType: "term"
    pattern: "(?i)\\b(therapeutic target|drug target|treatment target)s?\\b"
    toolType: "general"
    examples: ["therapeutic targets"]
    reasoning: "Publications focused on therapeutic targets are often reviews or conceptual papers rather than experimental studies. This pattern could help classify publication type to set appropriate tool mining expectations."

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication appears to be a review article focused on therapeutic targets
    - No Methods section indicating experimental work
    - Review articles typically don't use research tools experimentally
    - Any tool mentions would likely be citations from other studies (false positives)
    - Zero tools mined is the expected result for this publication type
  recommendations: |
    This publication represents a successful case where the mining system correctly identified zero tools. 
    The publication appears to be a review article about therapeutic targets in malignant peripheral nerve 
    sheath tumours, which would not be expected to contain experimental research tools. 
    
    Recommendations:
    1. This result validates that the mining system can appropriately handle review articles
    2. Consider implementing publication type classification early in the mining pipeline
    3. Review articles could be flagged for different processing or excluded from tool mining
    4. The suggested patterns could help identify similar review articles in the future
    5. No manual curator review needed - zero tools is the correct result
    
    This case demonstrates that "no tools found" can be a correct and valuable result when the publication 
    type doesn't warrant tool extraction.
