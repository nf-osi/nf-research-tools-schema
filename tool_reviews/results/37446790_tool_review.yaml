    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a molecular/cell biology study involving gene knockout, cell culture, protein analysis, and transcriptomics.
    Expected tools include: cell lines (C2C12), antibodies (for Western blot), genetic reagents (CRISPR/Cas9),
    and computational tools (for RNA-seq analysis).
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study involving cell culture, genetic manipulation, and molecular analysis.
    The study uses multiple research tools including cell lines, antibodies, genetic reagents, and computational
    analysis tools. Clinical assessment tools are not expected in this basic research context.

    pattern: "purchased from.*ATCC"
    toolType: "cell_line"
    examples: ["C2C12 line...purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)"]

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a clear lab research study with extensive tool usage
    - Multiple antibodies with catalog numbers and vendors were missed
    - Standard cell line (C2C12) from ATCC was not detected
    - CRISPR/Cas9 genetic reagent was missed
    - Computational tools (DESeq2, HiSeq XTen) for RNA-seq analysis were not captured
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous legitimate research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    All 10 potentially missed tools should be added as they have clear tool-specific context, vendor information,
    and catalog numbers. The mining patterns need significant improvement to capture:
    1. Cell lines from standard repositories (ATCC)
    2. Antibodies with catalog numbers and vendors
    3. CRISPR/Cas9 genetic reagents
    4. Bioinformatics software with version numbers
    5. Laboratory instruments and sequencing platforms
    No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated, but this study would likely
    contain valuable phenotypic observations about NF1 knockout effects on osteogenic differentiation.
