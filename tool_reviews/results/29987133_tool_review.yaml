  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on publication type (Clinical Trial for cutaneous neurofibromas):
    - Clinical assessment tools → Expected (outcome measures, quality of life scales, symptom assessments)
    - Computational tools → Possible (statistical analysis software, data management systems)
    - Lab research tools → Unlikely (antibodies, cell lines, animal models not expected in trial design)
    
    Clinical trials typically use validated assessment instruments to measure patient outcomes,
    treatment efficacy, and quality of life. Even if no tools were initially mined, clinical
    assessment tools are highly likely to be present in the methods or results sections.

  overallAssessment: |
    Clinical trial design publications typically contain clinical assessment tools such as validated
    questionnaires, outcome scales, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). These are essential
    for measuring treatment efficacy and patient outcomes. The absence of initially mined tools suggests
    either the mining patterns missed clinical assessment tools or the publication focuses on trial
    methodology without reporting specific instruments used.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No research tools were initially identified in a clinical trial publication
    - Clinical trials typically contain clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, scales, outcome measures)
    - Mining patterns may be inadequate for capturing clinical assessment instruments
    - Statistical analysis software commonly used in trials may have been missed
    - Publication type suggests high likelihood of clinical assessment tools being present
  recommendations: |
    CRITICAL FINDING: Zero tools identified in a clinical trial publication is highly unusual and suggests
    significant gaps in mining patterns for clinical assessment tools.
    
    IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED:
    1. Manual review of the full text is essential - clinical trials almost always use assessment tools
    2. Enhance mining patterns for clinical assessment instruments (SF-36, PedsQL, PROMIS, VAS, etc.)
    3. Add context patterns for clinical tool usage ("administered", "completed", "assessed using")
    4. Include statistical software patterns (SAS, SPSS, R) commonly used in trial analysis
    5. Review other clinical trial publications to identify systematic mining gaps
    
    EXPECTED TOOLS IN CLINICAL TRIALS:
    - Quality of life questionnaires (SF-36, PedsQL, PROMIS)
    - Pain assessment scales (VAS, NRS, Wong-Baker)
    - Functional assessment instruments
    - Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs)
    - Statistical analysis software for data processing
    
    This publication should be flagged for priority manual curation to identify missed clinical tools
    and improve future mining accuracy for clinical trial publications.
