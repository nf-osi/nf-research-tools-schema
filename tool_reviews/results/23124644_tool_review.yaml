    Clinical Study → clinical assessment tools (imaging quality scales), computational tools for image analysis
    
    This is a clinical imaging study evaluating MRI techniques for peripheral nerve tumors. Expected tools include:
    - Clinical assessment tools: imaging quality rating scales, measurement protocols
    - Computational tools: image analysis software, statistical analysis packages, tractography software
    - NOT expected: antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, organoids, PDX models
    
    Publications can contain multiple tool types. Clinical studies often use computational tools for data analysis
    and may employ standardized assessment instruments for measurements.
  overallAssessment: |
    This clinical imaging study would typically use computational tools for image analysis and processing,
    as well as clinical assessment tools for standardized evaluation of image quality and measurements.
    The study describes specific imaging protocols (DTI, DWI) and analysis methods (tractography, ADC, FA)
    that likely involve specialized software tools, though these may not be explicitly named.

      Image quality assessment using 3-point scale showed excellent results:
      - All anatomic MR imaging studies (29/29, 100%) received "good" quality
      - 20/21 (95%) DWI studies received "good" quality  
      - 21/24 (79%) DTI studies received "good" quality
      This demonstrates the scale's utility for standardized image quality evaluation in clinical imaging studies.

    contextSnippet: "All anatomic (29/29, 100%) MR imaging studies received \"good\" quality; 20/21 (95%) DWI and 21/24 (79%) DTI studies received \"good\" quality."

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined from this clinical imaging study
    - Several potential computational and clinical assessment tools may have been missed
    - The study describes specialized imaging analysis methods that likely require dedicated software
    - Clinical assessment scales for image quality evaluation were not captured
  recommendations: |
    This publication appears to have missed several potential tools:
    1. The "3-point scale" for image quality assessment is a standardized clinical tool
    2. DTI and tractography analysis methods require specialized computational software
    3. Consider adding patterns to capture imaging analysis methods and rating scales
    4. The mining may be too restrictive for clinical imaging studies that use specialized analysis tools
    5. One usage instruction observation was extracted showing the effectiveness of the 3-point scale
    6. Manual curator review recommended to determine if these imaging analysis methods qualify as research tools
