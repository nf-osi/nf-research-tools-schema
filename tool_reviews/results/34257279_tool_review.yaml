    This is a Drosophila genetics study investigating neurofibromin function, so we expect:
    - Animal models (Drosophila strains, mutants)
    - Genetic reagents (transgenes, RNAi lines, Gal4 drivers)
    - Antibodies (for Western blot, immunohistochemistry)
    - Computational tools (image analysis, statistical software)
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study using Drosophila genetics to investigate neurofibromin function in metabolism.
    The comprehensive Methods section describes extensive experimental procedures including fly genetics, respirometry, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry.
    This type of study typically uses multiple research tools including fly strains, antibodies, genetic constructs, and analysis software.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive Drosophila genetics study
    - Extensive Methods section contains numerous research tools that should have been detected
    - Missing detection of standard Drosophila genetic nomenclature and resource center patterns
    - Antibodies with catalog numbers and vendors not detected
    - Computational tools and analysis software not captured
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains extensive research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The study uses multiple Drosophila strains, genetic reagents, antibodies, and computational tools.
    All 17 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine research resources.
    The suggested patterns would significantly improve detection of Drosophila genetics tools.
    This represents a major gap in the current mining approach for model organism genetics studies.
    Manual curator review is recommended to validate the genetic reagents and establish proper categorization.
