  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on publication type (Lab Research with minipig model):
    - Animal models (minipig strains/lines) - HIGHLY EXPECTED
    - Computational tools (pharmacokinetic analysis software) - EXPECTED
    - Genetic reagents (if NF1 mutations were induced/characterized) - POSSIBLE
    - Clinical assessment tools (if behavioral/phenotypic assessments were performed) - POSSIBLE
    - Antibodies (if protein analysis was performed) - POSSIBLE
    
    This is a pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics study using a large animal model, which typically
    requires specialized animal strains, analytical software, and potentially molecular tools for
    characterization. The fact that NO tools were mined is concerning and suggests potential
    under-detection of animal models and computational tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    This lab research study using a neurofibromatosis type 1 minipig model should contain multiple
    research tools, particularly animal models and computational analysis tools. Pharmacokinetic
    studies require specialized software for data analysis and well-characterized animal models.
    The complete absence of mined tools suggests significant under-detection, especially for
    animal model nomenclature and computational tools used in PK/PD analysis.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Zero tools mined from a lab research study using animal models - indicates significant under-detection
    - Animal model (NF1 minipig) mentioned in title but not captured by mining patterns
    - Pharmacokinetic studies typically use specialized analysis software that may not be detected
    - Large animal model nomenclature may not be covered by current mining patterns
    - Publication type suggests multiple tool categories should be present
  recommendations: |
    - URGENT: Review and expand animal model patterns to include large animal models (minipigs, non-human primates)
    - Add pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis software to computational tool patterns
    - Implement disease-specific animal model patterns (e.g., "NF1 minipig", "ALS mouse")
    - Consider context-based detection for computational tools in PK/PD studies
    - Manual curator should review this publication to identify all missed tools
    - Use this publication as a test case for improved mining patterns
    - The complete absence of tools from a clear lab research study indicates systematic mining gaps
