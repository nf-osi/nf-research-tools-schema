    This is a proteomic screening study analyzing human schwannoma tumors using multiple experimental approaches.
    Expected tools include: antibodies (for immunohistochemistry and protein detection), computational tools 
    (for proteomic data analysis), and potentially cell lines (schwannoma cells mentioned in culture).
    The study uses RTK arrays, reverse-phase protein arrays (RRPA), and immunohistochemistry - all requiring
    specific antibodies and reagents.
  overallAssessment: |
    This laboratory research study clearly uses multiple research tools for proteomic analysis of human schwannomas.
    The methods describe RTK arrays, reverse-phase protein array (RRPA), and immunohistochemistry approaches,
    all of which require specific antibodies, reagents, and computational tools for data analysis.
    The fact that no tools were initially mined suggests significant gaps in the mining patterns.

      Ki67 levels are linked to YAP, p-Her3, and PDGFβ expression levels in human schwannomas.
      This indicates that Ki67 (a proliferation marker) correlates with specific signaling pathway
      components, suggesting these pathways control tumor cell proliferation.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a clear laboratory research study
    - Multiple obvious research tools were missed: Ki67 antibody, RTK arrays, RRPA platform, schwannoma cell cultures
    - The mining patterns appear to have significant gaps for proteomic research tools
    - Standard immunohistochemistry and protein array approaches were not detected
  recommendations: |
    This publication clearly contains multiple research tools that were completely missed by the initial mining.
    The tools identified (Ki67 antibody, RTK arrays, RRPA, schwannoma cells) should all be added to the database.
    The mining patterns need significant improvement to capture:
    1. Standard protein markers like Ki67
    2. Proteomic screening platforms (RTK arrays, RRPA)
    3. Cell culture systems mentioned in experimental context
    4. Antibody-based techniques like immunohistochemistry
    
    All 4-5 missed tools should be manually added, and the suggested patterns should be implemented
    to prevent similar gaps in future mining. The observations extracted provide valuable scientific
    insights about YAP signaling networks in schwannomas and tool performance characteristics.
