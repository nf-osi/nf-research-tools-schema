    This is a zebrafish retina regeneration study with extensive molecular biology, transgenic animal work, 
    immunofluorescence, and gene expression analysis. Expected tools include:
    - Animal models (zebrafish transgenic strains, mouse strains)
    - Antibodies for immunofluorescence
    - Genetic reagents (morpholinos, plasmids, primers)
    - Computational tools for analysis
    
    No clinical assessment tools expected as this is basic laboratory research.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study investigating Tgfb3 signaling in zebrafish retina 
    regeneration. The extensive Methods section describes detailed experimental procedures using transgenic 
    zebrafish, immunofluorescence, molecular biology techniques, and gene expression analysis. This type 
    of study would typically use numerous research tools including animal models, antibodies, genetic 
    reagents, and computational tools for data analysis.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: No tools were mined from this publication despite extensive tool usage
    - This is a comprehensive laboratory research study with detailed Methods section
    - Contains numerous research tools across multiple categories:
      * 8 zebrafish transgenic strains (animal models)
      * 1 mouse strain (animal model)  
      * 8 antibodies with catalog numbers and RRIDs
      * 5 genetic reagents (morpholinos, plasmids, kits)
      * 1 computational tool (CRISPRscan)
    - Mining patterns failed to detect standard zebrafish nomenclature
    - Missing patterns for morpholino reagents
    - Missing patterns for zebrafish-specific antibodies (Zpr-1, Zn-5)
    - Web-based computational tools not detected
  recommendations: |
    - ALL 22 identified tools should be added to the database
    - This represents a complete mining failure for a tool-rich publication
    - Implement suggested patterns to improve zebrafish tool detection:
      * Transgenic strain naming conventions (promoter:reporter format)
      * Morpholino reagent patterns
      * Zebrafish International Resource Center antibodies
      * Standard mouse strain nomenclature
    - Add context patterns from key resources tables
    - Include web-based computational tool URL patterns
    - This publication demonstrates need for model organism-specific mining patterns
    - Consider manual curation of zebrafish publications to identify additional patterns
    - No observations could be extracted since no tools were validated
