  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a bioinformatics analysis study that developed and validated a computational tool (RENOVO-NF1).
    Expected tool types:
    - Computational tools (primary focus) - software, databases, prediction algorithms, analysis pipelines
    - Potentially genetic reagents if experimental validation was performed
    
    The study involves variant interpretation, database analysis, and machine learning model development,
    which typically requires extensive use of computational tools, databases, and bioinformatics software.
  overallAssessment: |
    This bioinformatics study clearly contains numerous computational tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The publication describes development of RENOVO-NF1 predictor and uses multiple databases (ClinVar, GnomAD, 1000 Genomes),
    prediction algorithms (PolyPhen-2, SIFT, MutationTaster, etc.), and analysis software (R, ANNOVAR).
    The absence of any mined tools represents a significant failure in computational tool detection.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Complete failure to detect computational tools in a bioinformatics study
    - Primary tool RENOVO-NF1 (main subject of paper) was not detected
    - Multiple major databases (ClinVar, GnomAD, 1000 Genomes) with URLs and versions missed
    - Statistical software (R, cutpointR) with version numbers missed
    - Bioinformatics tools (ANNOVAR, PolyPhen-2, SIFT, MutationTaster) missed
    - Prediction algorithms and databases with clear usage context missed
    - Pattern matching appears to completely fail for computational tools
  recommendations: |
    - ALL 15 identified tools should be added to the mining results
    - This represents a systematic failure in computational tool detection
    - The suggested patterns should be implemented immediately to catch:
      * Software with version numbers
      * Databases with URLs
      * Tools mentioned with usage verbs (analyzed using, predicted with, etc.)
      * Lists of algorithms/tools
    - Manual review of other bioinformatics papers is recommended to identify similar gaps
    - No observations were extracted as this would require validated tools first
    - Priority should be given to improving computational tool mining patterns
