    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study on NF2-related schwannomatosis with extensive experimental methods including:
    - Animal models (genetically engineered mouse models)
    - Cell lines (human and murine schwannoma cell lines)
    - Antibodies (for immunohistochemistry, Western blot, immunofluorescence)
    - Genetic reagents (CRISPR-Cas9 constructs, plasmids)
    - Computational tools (analysis software, bioinformatics pipelines)
    
    The study involves in vivo therapeutic studies, cell culture experiments, molecular biology techniques, and comprehensive data analysis.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a high-quality laboratory research publication that extensively uses research tools across multiple categories. The study investigates FAK and MEK inhibition in NF2-related schwannomatosis using genetically engineered mouse models, multiple cell lines, numerous antibodies for various assays, genetic manipulation tools, and sophisticated computational analysis pipelines. The comprehensive Methods section describes detailed experimental procedures that would require numerous research tools. The absence of any mined tools suggests significant gaps in the mining process for this publication type.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Complete failure of mining system: No tools were captured despite this being a comprehensive laboratory research study
    - Missed 29 clearly identifiable research tools across all major categories
    - Failed to capture standard research identifiers (RRIDs, catalog numbers, strain nomenclature)
    - No recognition of mouse strain genotype nomenclature (flox/flox, +/-, -/-)
    - Antibodies with catalog numbers and vendor information not captured
    - Cell lines with ATCC/RRID identifiers not captured
    - Computational tools with version numbers and RRIDs not captured
    - CRISPR/genetic reagents with catalog numbers not captured
  recommendations: |
    - CRITICAL: Complete overhaul of mining patterns needed for this publication type
    - Add patterns for mouse strain nomenclature (genotype notation)
    - Add patterns for RRID identifiers (IMSR_JAX, CVCL, SCR prefixes)
    - Add patterns for catalog numbers in parentheses with vendor names
    - Add patterns for ATCC cell line identifiers (CRL-XXXX)
    - Add patterns for software version numbers
    - Add patterns for phospho-specific antibody nomenclature
    - Add context phrases for tool acquisition ("purchased from", "obtained from")
    - This publication demonstrates that current mining is inadequate for comprehensive lab research papers
    - All 29 missed tools should be added to improve future mining accuracy
    - The extracted observations show the rich scientific content available when tools are properly identified
