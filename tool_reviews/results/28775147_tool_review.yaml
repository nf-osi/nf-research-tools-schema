  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on NF2/schwannoma research with genetic models and drug treatments:
    - Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools
    - Potential for advanced cellular models (organoids) and patient-derived models (PDX)
    - Computational tools for data analysis
    
    This type of research typically involves multiple tool categories including experimental
    models, molecular reagents, and analytical software.
  overallAssessment: |
    This appears to be a laboratory research publication focusing on NF2 and schwannoma treatment
    with genetic models and drug treatments. Such studies typically use multiple research tools
    including animal models, cell lines, antibodies, and computational analysis tools. The presence
    of comprehensive methods and experimental sections strongly suggests tool usage, making the
    zero tools identified during mining highly suspicious and likely indicating missed tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    Critical mining failure detected:
    - Zero tools identified in a laboratory research publication about NF2/schwannoma
    - Publication has comprehensive methods section indicating experimental work
    - Research involves genetic models, drug treatments, and experimental methodologies
    - High likelihood of multiple missed research tools across categories
    - Mining patterns appear insufficient for this research domain
  recommendations: |
    Urgent review required for this publication:
    - Complete re-mining needed with enhanced patterns for NF2/schwannoma research
    - Manual curator should review full text for missed tools
    - Focus on animal models (knockout mice), cell lines (schwannoma), antibodies (NF2)
    - Check for drug compounds, genetic reagents, and computational analysis tools
    - This represents a significant mining system failure that needs investigation
    - Consider this publication as a test case for improving mining accuracy
    - No observations could be extracted due to lack of validated tools
