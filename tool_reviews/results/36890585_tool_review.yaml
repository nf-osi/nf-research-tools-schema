  majorIssuesFound: |
    Critical mining failure - no tools were extracted despite this being a comprehensive
    laboratory research study with extensive tool usage:
    - Multiple genetically modified mouse strains (6 different animal models)
    - Primary antibodies for immunohistochemistry (4 different antibodies)
    - Specialized computational tools for analysis (5 different software packages)
    - Proteomics reagents (TMTpro labeling system)
    
    The mining system completely failed to identify any tools in a publication that
    contains at least 15 clearly identifiable research tools with proper experimental
    context, vendor information, and usage descriptions.
  recommendations: |
    URGENT: Complete mining system failure requires immediate investigation:
    
    1. **Mining Algorithm Review**: The current mining patterns are inadequate for
       detecting standard laboratory tools. All 15 missed tools have clear experimental
       context and should have been easily identified.
    
    2. **Pattern Enhancement**: Implement the 9 suggested patterns immediately to catch:
       - Mouse strain nomenclature (Nf1+/-, flox/flox, Cre strains)
       - Antibody descriptions with species/clonality
       - Software with version numbers
       - Proteomics reagents
    
    3. **Quality Control**: This publication should be used as a test case to validate
       mining improvements. A successful mining should identify 15+ tools.
    
    4. **Manual Curation**: All tools listed in potentiallyMissedTools should be added
       to the database as they represent genuine research tools with proper experimental
       validation.
    
    5. **System Testing**: Test the mining system on similar neuroscience publications
       to ensure this is not a systematic failure across the field.
