  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple mouse strains, antibodies, and computational tools are clearly present in methods
    - Mining patterns appear to miss standard mouse nomenclature and antibody descriptions
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous genuine research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The study uses multiple transgenic mouse strains, primary antibodies, and specialized analysis software.
    All 13 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent legitimate research tools with proper context.
    The suggested patterns would significantly improve detection of mouse models and antibodies in future mining.
    Manual curator review recommended to verify the extensive tool usage described in methods.
