  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple categories of research tools are clearly present but were missed
    - 22 distinct research tools identified across cell lines, animal models, antibodies, genetic reagents, computational tools, and advanced cellular models
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains extensive research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    All 22 identified tools should be added as they represent genuine research tools with clear experimental usage.
    The suggested patterns should be implemented to improve detection of similar tools in future mining.
    This represents a significant gap in the current mining approach for comprehensive lab research studies.
