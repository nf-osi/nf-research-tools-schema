  majorIssuesFound: |
    Major issues found during review:
    - NO TOOLS WERE MINED despite this being a computational study with extensive ML methodology
    - Multiple explicit computational tools mentioned in methods section were completely missed
    - XGBoost, Yellowbrick, HoloViews, Phecode, and CCSR are all clearly named tools used in the study
    - The mining system appears to have failed to detect any computational tools in this bioinformatics paper
    - This represents a significant gap in computational tool detection patterns
  recommendations: |
    Overall recommendations for this publication:
    - This publication should NOT have zero tools - it's a computational study with many ML tools
    - At least 6-9 computational tools should be added based on explicit mentions in the methods
    - High-confidence tools (XGBoost, Yellowbrick, HoloViews, Phecode, CCSR) should definitely be added
    - The mining patterns need significant improvement for computational tools detection
    - Focus on ML frameworks, algorithms, and data analysis libraries
    - Look for explicit library/software mentions with descriptive context
    - This case demonstrates major gaps in the current mining approach for bioinformatics papers
