    Lab Research → animal models, computational tools, genetic reagents
    
    This is a biomedical engineering/optical spectroscopy study that uses mouse models of genetic muscle disease.
    Expected tools include:
    - Animal models (multiple mouse strains and genetic models)
    - Computational tools (MATLAB, analysis software, statistical packages)
    - Genetic reagents (transgenic mouse lines, knockout constructs)
    - Potentially antibodies or reagents for histological staining
    
    The publication involves experimental procedures, animal work, data analysis, and histological validation,
    making it highly likely to contain multiple research tool types.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a clear lab research publication involving biomedical engineering and optical spectroscopy applied to mouse models
    of muscle disease. The study develops and validates a fiber-optic spectroscopy system using multiple mouse strains including
    genetic knockout models. The presence of detailed Methods, Results, and histological validation strongly indicates extensive
    use of research tools. The complete absence of mined tools represents a significant mining failure.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Complete mining failure: Zero tools extracted from a publication rich in research tools
    - Multiple mouse models not detected despite clear experimental usage
    - Standard software (MATLAB) not captured despite extensive usage description
    - Genetic reagent nomenclature (floxed alleles) not recognized
    - Scientific equipment with model numbers not detected
    - This represents a systematic failure of mining patterns for lab research publications
  recommendations: |
    This publication demonstrates critical gaps in mining patterns that need immediate attention:
    
    1. URGENT: Add mouse model nomenclature patterns - this is fundamental for biomedical research
    2. Implement genetic reagent patterns for floxed alleles and transgenic constructs
    3. Add software detection patterns with usage context (MATLAB, Arduino)
    4. Include scientific equipment patterns with manufacturer/model numbers
    5. Add context-based detection for "mouse models of", "transgenic mice", etc.
    
    All 10 missed tools should be added to the database as they represent genuine research tools
    with clear experimental usage. The observations extracted show significant phenotypic findings
    that demonstrate the scientific value of these animal models.
    
    This mining failure highlights the need for comprehensive pattern coverage in lab research domains.
