    Lab Research → animal models, computational tools, genetic reagents, potentially antibodies for histology
    This is an experimental study using mouse models of genetic muscle disease with optical spectroscopy
    measurements and histological analysis. Expected tools include animal models (NF1 and mdx mice),
    computational analysis software (MATLAB), and potentially reagents for tissue processing and staining.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study using animal models and optical measurement techniques to analyze
    muscle tissue pathology. The study involves experimental procedures on mouse models, tissue processing,
    and computational analysis, making it highly likely to contain research tools including animal models,
    computational tools, and laboratory reagents.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a clear laboratory research study
    - Multiple mouse models and computational tools were missed by the mining process
    - Standard mouse strain nomenclature and genetic model designations not captured
    - MATLAB and Arduino computational tools used in experimental setup were missed
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains multiple legitimate research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The study uses several mouse models (Nf1Prx1-/-, mdx, C57BL/6, Nf1flox/flox, Prx1-Cre) and computational
    tools (MATLAB, Arduino) that should be added to the database. The mining patterns need improvement for
    mouse strain nomenclature and standard computational tools used in experimental setups. All 8 potentially
    missed tools should be manually reviewed and likely added as they represent genuine research tools used
    in this NF-related muscle pathology study.
