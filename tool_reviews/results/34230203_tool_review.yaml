    This is a systematic evaluation of patient-reported outcome measures (clinical assessment tools).
    Expected tool types:
    - Clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, scales, patient-reported outcome measures)
    - Possibly computational tools for systematic review/analysis
    
    The publication specifically evaluates 21 different hearing-related assessment instruments
    (10 for hearing function, 11 for hearing-related quality of life) and recommends specific
    tools for NF2 clinical trials. These are legitimate clinical assessment tools that should
    have been captured by the mining process.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication is a systematic evaluation of clinical assessment tools for hearing function
    and quality of life in NF2 patients. It should contain multiple validated clinical assessment
    tools as the entire purpose is to review and recommend specific patient-reported outcome measures.
    The mining process appears to have completely missed the clinical assessment tools that are
    the primary focus of this study.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Mining process completely failed to identify clinical assessment tools in a publication specifically about evaluating clinical assessment tools
    - The abstract and methods clearly mention specific validated instruments (Self-Assessment of Communication, Self-Assessment of Communication-Adolescent)
    - This represents a significant gap in clinical assessment tool mining patterns
    - The publication evaluates 21 different hearing-related assessment measures but none were captured
  recommendations: |
    This publication should have captured multiple clinical assessment tools as it is entirely focused on
    evaluating patient-reported outcome measures for hearing function and quality of life. The mining
    patterns for clinical assessment tools need significant improvement to capture:
    1. Specific validated questionnaire names (Self-Assessment of Communication)
    2. Context phrases indicating systematic evaluation of assessment tools
    3. Recommendation statements for clinical trial endpoints
    
    All three potentially missed tools should be added to the database. The suggested patterns should
    be implemented to improve future mining of clinical assessment tool publications. This represents
    a clear case where the mining process failed to identify the primary research tools that are the
    entire focus of the publication.
