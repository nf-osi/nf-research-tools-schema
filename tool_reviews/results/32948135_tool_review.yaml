    This is a laboratory research study investigating the effects of 3-bromopyruvate on MPNST cell lines
    and mouse fibroblasts. The study includes extensive experimental methods with cell culture, 
    immunohistochemistry, metabolic assays, and statistical analysis. Expected tools include:
    - Cell lines (human MPNST lines and mouse fibroblasts)
    - Antibodies for immunohistochemical analysis
    - Computational tools for data analysis
    - Genetic reagents (plasmids, constructs)
    - Laboratory reagents and assay kits
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study that extensively uses multiple research tools.
    The study investigates anticancer effects using established cell lines, immunohistochemical markers,
    and computational analysis tools. Tools are expected and extensively used throughout the experimental design.
    The mining system appears to have failed to detect any tools, which is a significant oversight given
    the clear experimental nature and detailed methods section of this publication.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Complete mining failure: No tools were detected despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple established cell lines (S462, NSF1, T265, B8 fibroblasts) were not detected
    - Six different antibodies with full catalog information were missed
    - Computational tools (MATLAB, pathoZoom) with version information were not captured
    - Genetic reagents (pSG5 vector, PSME3 cDNA) were not detected
    - This represents a systematic failure of the mining system for this publication type
  recommendations: |
    - All 15 identified tools should be added to the database - they represent genuine research tools with clear experimental usage
    - The mining patterns need significant enhancement to capture:
      * MPNST-specific cell line names (S462, NSF1, T265)
      * DAKO antibody catalog number patterns
      * Software version specifications
      * Plasmid vector naming conventions
      * cDNA construct patterns
    - This publication demonstrates excellent tool usage documentation with vendor information, catalog numbers, and detailed experimental protocols
    - The extracted observations provide valuable phenotypic and usage data for the identified tools
    - Priority should be given to implementing the suggested patterns to prevent similar mining failures
