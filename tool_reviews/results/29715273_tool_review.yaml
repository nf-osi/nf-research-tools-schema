    This publication is a comprehensive laboratory study investigating NF2/Merlin protein expression and function
    in oligodendrocytes using multiple experimental approaches including immunohistochemistry, cell culture,
    transfection experiments, Western blotting, RT-PCR, and various functional assays. Expected tools include:
    - Animal models (transgenic mice)
    - Cell lines (multiple immortalized and primary cultures)
    - Antibodies (for immunostaining and Western blot)
    - Genetic reagents (plasmids for transfection)
    - Computational tools (image analysis, statistical software)
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a classic laboratory research publication that extensively uses research tools across multiple categories.
    The comprehensive Methods section describes detailed experimental procedures using animal models, cell lines,
    antibodies, genetic reagents, and computational tools. The fact that no tools were initially mined indicates
    major gaps in the mining patterns, as this publication contains numerous clearly identifiable research tools
    with specific catalog numbers, vendor information, and experimental usage contexts.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive laboratory research study
    - Mining patterns failed to capture standard research tools including:
      * Mouse strain nomenclature (NG2-EYFP mice, C57Bl6/J mice)
      * Cell line names with various formats (OLN93, SC4, RT4-D6PT2, TC620, Oli-neu, CG4)
      * Standard antibody naming (anti-Merlin, anti-Olig2, anti-MBP, anti-GFP, anti-Ki67)
      * Plasmid names (pcNf2hflag, pcDNA3.1)
      * Common computational tools (ImageJ, R, XCELLigence)
    - Patterns appear to miss tools with catalog numbers and vendor information
    - Context-based detection seems insufficient for this publication type
  recommendations: |
    URGENT PATTERN IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:
    - Add mouse strain nomenclature patterns including transgenic strains
    - Expand cell line detection to include alphanumeric combinations and hyphens
    - Improve antibody detection with 'anti-' prefix patterns
    - Add plasmid/vector naming conventions (pc*, p* patterns)
    - Include common computational tools (ImageJ, R, XCELLigence, RTCA)
    - Add vendor/catalog number detection patterns
    - Implement context-based detection for tool sourcing phrases
    
    This publication demonstrates major gaps in current mining coverage. All 21 missed tools should be added
    to improve future mining accuracy. The suggested patterns would significantly improve detection of
    standard laboratory research tools across multiple categories.
    
    OBSERVATIONS: Successfully extracted 8 scientific observations covering cellular phenotypes and
    usage instructions for validated tools. Observations include quantitative data on cell proliferation,
    morphology changes, and tool performance characteristics.
