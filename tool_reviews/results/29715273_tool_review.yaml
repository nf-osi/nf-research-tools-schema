  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple categories of research tools are clearly present in the Methods section
    - Mining patterns appear to have missed standard research tools with clear nomenclature
    - Cell lines, antibodies, animal models, and genetic reagents are extensively described
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous genuine research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The Methods section is comprehensive and describes multiple experimental approaches using standard
    research tools. All 14 potentially missed tools should be added to the database as they represent
    legitimate research reagents with proper attribution and catalog information. The suggested patterns
    would significantly improve mining accuracy for similar publications. No observations were extracted
    since no tools were initially validated, but this study would likely contain valuable phenotypic
    and functional observations about NF2/Merlin in oligodendrocytes once tools are properly validated.
