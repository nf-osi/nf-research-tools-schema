  likelyContainsTools: Yes
  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a protocol/methods paper describing the use of a novel peptide (HK2pep) for biochemical analysis.
    Expected tool types:
    - Genetic reagents (the HK2pep peptide itself is a designed reagent)
    - Computational tools (peptide design likely required computational modeling/design software)
    - Cell lines (for testing peptide effects, though not mentioned in available abstract)
    - Antibodies (for detecting HK2 and assessing detachment, though not mentioned in available abstract)
    
    Note: Limited to abstract only - full Methods section would likely reveal additional tools including
    cell culture reagents, detection antibodies, imaging tools, and computational analysis software.
  overallAssessment: |
    This Bio-protocol paper describes a novel peptide-based approach for detaching hexokinase 2 from 
    mitochondrial membranes. As a protocol paper, it would typically describe specific reagents, tools, 
    and methods needed to perform the described technique. However, only the abstract is available for 
    analysis, which limits tool identification. The mining found zero tools, which is likely an 
    underestimate given that this is a methods paper that would normally detail specific reagents and protocols.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Zero tools were mined despite this being a protocol/methods paper that would typically contain multiple research tools
    - Only abstract text is available - Methods, Results, and Discussion sections are missing, severely limiting tool identification
    - The custom-designed peptide HK2pep was not captured, indicating gaps in genetic reagent pattern recognition
    - Protocol papers typically describe specific reagents, cell lines, antibodies, and computational tools that are not visible in the abstract alone
  recommendations: |
    This publication requires full-text access to properly identify research tools. The abstract alone suggests this is a 
    methods paper that would contain multiple tools including the HK2pep peptide, likely cell lines for testing, detection 
    antibodies, and computational tools for peptide design. The mining should be re-run with full text when available.
    
    Key recommendations:
    - Obtain full text including Methods section for comprehensive tool identification
    - Add the identified HK2pep peptide as a genetic reagent
    - Implement suggested patterns for better peptide/reagent recognition
    - Consider that protocol papers may have different tool mention patterns than research articles
    - No observations can be extracted without Results/Discussion sections
