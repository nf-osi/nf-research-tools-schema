    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a laboratory research study using mouse models, mass spectrometry, and computational analysis.
    Expected tools include animal models (NF1 mouse strains), computational tools (MATLAB, analysis software),
    and antibodies for immunohistochemistry validation.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a laboratory research study using 3-D MALDI imaging mass spectrometry to analyze protein distributions
    in NF1 mouse optic glioma models. The study involves extensive experimental methods including mouse models,
    tissue processing, mass spectrometry, computational analysis, and immunohistochemistry validation, making it
    highly likely to contain multiple research tools across several categories.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a methods-heavy laboratory research publication
    - Multiple clear research tools present in methods section were missed by initial mining
    - Animal models, computational tools, and antibodies all present with standard nomenclature
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous legitimate research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    All 8 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent standard research tools with clear usage context.
    The mouse models (Nf1flox/flox;GFAP-Cre, C57BL/6) are fundamental to the study design.
    Computational tools (MATLAB, FlexImaging, Scaffold, etc.) are essential for the mass spectrometry analysis.
    The anti-S100A10 antibody is used for validation experiments with proper dilution and vendor information.
    The suggested patterns would help capture similar tools in future NF research publications.
