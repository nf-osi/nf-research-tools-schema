      TRAP1 knockout in U87 cells resulted in decreased F-ATP synthase ATPase activity and increased 
      sensitivity to permeability transition pore (PTP) opening. Cells showed enhanced mitochondrial 
      depolarization after treatment with cl-HK2pep peptide. TRAP1 ablation also affected the 
      interaction between CyPD and OSCP, with increased CyPD binding to F-ATP synthase in the 
      absence of TRAP1.

      sMPNST cells were used for split-GFP experiments to demonstrate protein-protein interactions 
      in mitochondria. The cells successfully showed direct mitochondrial interactions between 
      TRAP1 and OSCP, and between TRAP1 and CyPD. TRAP1 knockout enhanced the binding between 
      CyPD and OSCP, as measured by increased GFP reconstitution (>1300 cells analyzed).

      ImageJ software was used in conjunction with LAS AF software for analyzing split-GFP 
      experiments. The software was used to quantify the percentage of cells showing protein 
      interactions by calculating the ratio between green (GFP-positive) and red (total) cells, 
      with at least 2500 cells analyzed for each experimental condition.

      Prism 6.0 software was used for protein quantification and statistical significance assessment 
      in mass spectrometry experiments. The software was used with Benjamini-Hochberg procedure 
      correction for multiple comparisons. Results with p-value lower than 0.05 were considered 
      significant, with significance levels indicated as ***p<0.001, **p<0.01, *p<0.05.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were mined from this publication despite it being a comprehensive laboratory research study
    - Multiple clear research tools are present with standard naming conventions and catalog numbers
    - Cell lines, antibodies, genetic reagents, and computational tools are extensively used
    - Mining patterns appear to have significant gaps in coverage
    - Vendor information and catalog numbers are present but not detected
  recommendations: |
    This publication represents a significant failure of the mining system. Despite being a high-quality 
    laboratory research paper with extensive Methods section and clear tool usage, zero tools were detected. 
    The following actions are recommended:
    
    1. IMMEDIATE: Add all 14 identified tools to the database - they are clearly valid research tools
    2. PATTERN UPDATES: Implement the 6 suggested patterns to improve future mining coverage
    3. SYSTEM REVIEW: Investigate why basic patterns for cell lines (U87, HEK 293T), antibodies with 
       catalog numbers, and common software (ImageJ, Prism) failed to trigger
    4. VALIDATION: Test updated patterns against this publication to ensure proper detection
    5. QUALITY CONTROL: This publication should be used as a benchmark for mining system performance
    
    The extracted observations demonstrate that when tools are properly identified, meaningful scientific 
    data can be captured about their usage and performance characteristics.
