    Clinical Study → clinical assessment tools, possibly computational tools for analysis
    
    This publication specifically focuses on evaluating patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures
    for neurofibromatosis clinical trials. The study systematically reviews and rates different
    clinical assessment tools, particularly pain intensity scales. Clinical assessment tools
    (questionnaires, scales, outcome measures) are the primary tool type expected.
    
    Note: Publications can contain MULTIPLE tool types. While this is primarily a clinical study,
    it could potentially use computational tools for analysis, though none are evident in the
    available text sections.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication is a clinical study that systematically evaluates patient-reported outcome
    measures for use in neurofibromatosis clinical trials. The study specifically reviews and
    rates clinical assessment tools, particularly pain intensity scales, making it highly likely
    to contain validated clinical assessment tools. The REiNS PRO Working Group developed criteria
    to evaluate PRO measures and applied systematic review processes, indicating methodical
    assessment of clinical tools rather than just observational research.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Critical mining failure: No tools were captured despite clear presence of clinical assessment tools
    - The publication explicitly discusses and evaluates three validated pain assessment scales
    - Mining patterns appear to lack coverage for clinical assessment tools, particularly pain scales
    - The systematic review nature of the study makes these tools highly reliable and well-documented
    - All missed tools have strong validation context and psychometric data mentioned
  recommendations: |
    This publication represents a significant mining failure - four validated clinical assessment tools
    were completely missed despite being explicitly discussed and systematically evaluated. The tools
    (NRS-11, Visual Analogue Scale, Faces Pain Scale-Revised) are well-established pain assessment
    instruments with strong psychometric properties.
    
    All four missed tools should be added to the database as they represent genuine clinical assessment
    tools that are actively used and recommended for neurofibromatosis clinical trials. The publication
    provides valuable usage guidance and comparative evaluation data.
    
    The mining patterns urgently need enhancement for clinical assessment tools, particularly:
    1. Pain assessment scales and their abbreviations
    2. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROs)
    3. Context phrases indicating systematic tool evaluation
    4. Compound tool names with hyphens and revisions
    
    Three high-quality usage observations were extracted providing implementation guidance for these
    clinical assessment tools in NF research contexts.
