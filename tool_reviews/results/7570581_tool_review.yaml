  hasMethodsSection: No
  likelyContainsTools: Yes
  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on publication type (Lab Research) and content analysis:
    - genetic_reagent: cDNA clones are mentioned (N-isoform 10, N-isoform 11)
    - computational_tool: Molecular analysis and sequence comparison likely used
    - cell_line: In vitro translation systems mentioned
    
    This is molecular biology research involving cDNA cloning and protein analysis.
    Despite being from 1995, this type of work typically uses multiple research tools
    including cloning vectors, expression systems, and analytical software.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a molecular biology research paper describing the cloning and characterization
    of neurofibromin isoforms. The work involves cDNA cloning, in vitro translation, and
    molecular weight determination - all indicating active lab research that would use
    genetic reagents and potentially computational tools for sequence analysis.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    Major issues identified during review:
    - No tools were initially mined despite clear evidence of molecular biology research
    - Only abstract text available - full Methods section would likely contain more tools
    - Multiple cDNA clones described that should be captured as genetic reagents
    - In vitro translation systems mentioned but not captured
    - Publication from 1995 may have different terminology that current patterns miss
  recommendations: |
    Overall recommendations for this publication:
    - Add the missed cDNA clones (N-isoform 10, N-isoform 11) as genetic reagents
    - Consider adding in vitro translation system as a genetic reagent
    - Implement suggested patterns to catch similar isoform naming conventions
    - This publication demonstrates that older papers (1995) may use different terminology
    - Full text access would likely reveal additional tools (vectors, cell lines, enzymes)
    - The mining patterns may need adjustment for historical molecular biology terminology
