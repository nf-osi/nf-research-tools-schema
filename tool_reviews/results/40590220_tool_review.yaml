    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study with extensive experimental methods including:
    - Animal model studies (mouse genetics and behavior)
    - Cell culture experiments (multiple cell lines)
    - Molecular biology techniques (Western blotting, immunoprecipitation)
    - Biochemical assays (ubiquitination, protein interactions)
    - Behavioral testing (multiple standardized assays)
    - Computational analysis (image analysis, statistical software)
    
    Expected to contain ALL major lab tool categories except organoids and PDX models.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication represents a comprehensive laboratory research study investigating neurofibromin regulation
    in NF1 haploinsufficiency using multiple experimental approaches. The extensive Methods section describes
    detailed protocols for animal studies, cell culture, molecular biology, and behavioral testing, indicating
    heavy usage of research tools across multiple categories. The complete absence of mined tools (0 detected)
    represents a critical failure of the mining system for this tool-rich publication.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Complete mining failure - 0 tools detected from a tool-rich laboratory research publication
    - Methods section contains extensive experimental protocols using multiple tool categories
    - 26+ research tools clearly identifiable that should have been mined
    - Mining patterns appear inadequate for standard research tool nomenclature
    - No recognition of vendor/catalog number patterns
    - Behavioral assessment tools not recognized as clinical assessment tools
    - Standard software tools (ImageJ, GraphPad Prism) not detected
    - Mouse strain nomenclature completely missed
    - Cell line names with ATCC numbers not recognized
    - Antibodies with catalog numbers not detected
  recommendations: |
    This publication represents a complete failure of the mining system. ALL 26+ identified tools should be added:
    
    IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED:
    1. Add all 26 identified tools to the database - they represent genuine research tools with clear experimental usage
    2. Implement the 10 suggested patterns to catch similar tools in future mining
    3. Review mining algorithms for basic pattern recognition failures
    4. Add vendor/catalog number recognition patterns
    5. Include behavioral assessment tools as valid clinical assessment tools
    6. Expand software tool recognition beyond basic bioinformatics tools
    
    TOOL CATEGORIES TO ADD:
    - Animal Models: 3 mouse strains with genetic modifications
    - Cell Lines: 3 standard research cell lines with ATCC numbers
    - Antibodies: 7 research antibodies with catalog numbers
    - Genetic Reagents: 5 plasmids, siRNAs, and cDNA constructs
    - Computational Tools: 4 software packages for analysis
    - Clinical Assessment Tools: 4 standardized behavioral tests
    
    This publication demonstrates the mining system needs fundamental improvements to achieve acceptable recall rates for laboratory research publications.
