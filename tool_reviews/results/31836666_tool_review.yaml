  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Mining patterns failed to capture numerous genetic reagents (plasmids, vectors)
    - Cell line patterns missed both bacterial strains and insect cell lines
    - Computational tool patterns missed specialized biophysical analysis software
    - Addgene catalog numbers not recognized as genetic reagent indicators
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains extensive research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The study involves protein expression, purification, structural characterization, and cellular assays.
    Key missed categories include: Gateway cloning vectors, bacterial/insect expression cell lines,
    CRISPR-generated cell lines, and specialized computational tools for biophysical analysis.
    All 16 potentially missed tools should be added to improve mining coverage for structural biology studies.
    The suggested patterns would significantly improve detection of similar tools in future publications.
