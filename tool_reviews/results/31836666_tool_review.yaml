  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a laboratory research study involving extensive biochemical and structural characterization
    of neurofibromin protein. Expected tool types include:
    - Cell lines (HEK293T, NF1-null HEK293T, insect cells for protein expression)
    - Genetic reagents (plasmids, constructs, expression vectors)
    - Computational tools (software for data analysis, structural modeling)
    - Antibodies (for Western blotting and immunoprecipitation)
    
    The study involves protein purification, biophysical analyses, electron microscopy, analytical
    ultracentrifugation, and cell-based assays - all indicating extensive tool usage.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication represents a comprehensive laboratory research study with extensive experimental
    methods including protein expression, purification, biophysical characterization, and cell-based
    assays. The presence of a detailed Methods section and multiple experimental approaches strongly
    indicates the use of numerous research tools. The mining result showing zero tools is clearly
    incorrect and represents a significant failure in tool detection.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Mining completely failed to detect any tools despite extensive experimental methods
    - Publication contains numerous cell lines, genetic reagents, antibodies, and computational tools
    - Methods section describes detailed protocols using multiple research tools
    - At least 32 distinct research tools were missed by the mining process
    - This represents a complete failure of the tool detection system for this publication type
  recommendations: |
    This publication demonstrates a catastrophic failure of the mining system. Despite being a
    comprehensive laboratory research study with extensive tool usage, zero tools were detected.
    
    IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED:
    1. All 32 identified tools should be added to the database
    2. The 8 suggested patterns should be implemented to improve future mining
    3. Mining patterns need major revision for biochemical/structural biology publications
    4. Cell line detection patterns are completely inadequate
    5. Computational tool detection needs significant improvement
    6. Antibody detection with catalog numbers is failing
    7. Plasmid/vector detection patterns are missing
    
    This publication type (protein biochemistry/structural biology) appears to be poorly covered
    by current mining patterns. A systematic review of similar publications is recommended to
    identify additional pattern gaps.
    
    The 6 observations extracted demonstrate successful experimental usage of multiple tools,
    providing valuable information about tool performance and protocols.
