  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a neuroimaging study comparing brain anatomy between children with RASopathies 
    and typically developing children. Expected tool types:
    - Computational tools: Neuroimaging analysis software (FreeSurfer, FSL, SPM, etc.) for 
      T1-weighted image processing, vertex-based analysis, and Desikan ROI parcellation
    - Clinical assessment tools: Potentially diagnostic instruments for RASopathies, autism 
      spectrum disorder, or ADHD assessment (though not explicitly mentioned)
    
    The study uses sophisticated neuroimaging analysis methods that would require specialized 
    computational tools, even though none were explicitly mentioned in the available text.
  overallAssessment: |
    This neuroimaging study would definitely require computational tools for MRI data processing 
    and analysis. The mention of "vertex-based analysis" and "Desikan ROI parcellation" indicates 
    use of neuroimaging software packages like FreeSurfer. However, the available text sections 
    are quite brief and may not contain the detailed Methods section where software would typically 
    be mentioned. The lack of mined tools likely represents incomplete text extraction rather than 
    absence of tools in the actual publication.

    details: |
      Children with RASopathies showed convergent cortical effects compared to typically developing children:
      - Increased surface area in the precentral gyrus
      - Decreased surface area in occipital regions  
      - Thinner cortical thickness in the precentral gyrus
      
      Divergent subcortical effects were syndrome-specific:
      - Noonan syndrome: decreased volumes in striatal and thalamic structures
      - NF1: increased volumes in hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus
    foundIn: "results"
    contextSnippet: "Compared to TD, RASopathies had convergent effects on SA and CT, exhibiting increased SA in the precentral gyrus, decreased SA in occipital regions, and thinner CT in the precentral gyrus. RASopathies exhibit divergent effects on subcortical volumes..."

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were mined from this publication despite it being a neuroimaging study
    - The available text sections appear to be abbreviated/summarized rather than full text
    - Neuroimaging studies typically require specialized computational tools (FreeSurfer, FSL, SPM) 
      that are not mentioned in the brief methods description
    - The lack of mined tools likely reflects incomplete text extraction rather than absence of tools
  recommendations: |
    This publication likely contains computational tools that were not captured due to incomplete 
    text extraction. The brief methods section mentions sophisticated neuroimaging analyses 
    (vertex-based analysis, Desikan parcellation) that would require specialized software.
    
    Recommendations:
    1. Obtain the full Methods section text to identify specific neuroimaging software used
    2. Consider adding patterns for neuroimaging analysis methods that indirectly indicate tool usage
    3. The neuroanatomical findings represent valid scientific observations about RASopathies
    4. This type of study would benefit from more comprehensive text extraction to capture 
       computational tools mentioned in detailed methodology sections
