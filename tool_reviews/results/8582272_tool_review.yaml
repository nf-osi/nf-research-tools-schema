      Normal fascicle formation by perineurial cells failed to occur in the absence of neurofibromin. Fascicles were reduced in number and showed abnormal morphology when normal neurons and Schwann cells were cultured with fibroblasts lacking neurofibromin for up to 37 days.

      Proliferation was increased in a majority of fibroblast cell strains analyzed from embryos lacking neurofibromin. This suggests that mutations in the neurofibromatosis type I gene affect fibroblast behavior that might contribute to neurofibroma formation.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a clear laboratory research study with extensive use of research tools
    - Multiple animal models (knockout mice strains) were missed due to genetic nomenclature not being recognized
    - Primary cell culture systems were not captured by current cell line patterns
    - PCR reagents and primers with specific names and vendors were not identified
    - The mining patterns appear to miss standard laboratory research tools used in NF research
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous research tools that were completely missed by the initial mining. The suggested patterns should be implemented to capture:
    1. Genetic nomenclature for knockout mouse strains (Nf1+/-, Nf1-/-)
    2. Primary cell culture systems (Schwann cells, fibroblasts, DRG cultures)
    3. PCR reagents and custom primers with vendor information
    4. Standard mouse strain names (C57BL/6J)
    All potentially missed tools should be added as they represent legitimate research tools used in this study. The observations extracted show clear phenotypic differences in the knockout model system.
