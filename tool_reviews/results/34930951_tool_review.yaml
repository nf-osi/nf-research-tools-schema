  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on the publication type (Lab Research) focusing on hydrogel development for retinal ganglion cell therapy:
    - HIGHLY EXPECTED: cell lines (retinal ganglion cells, possibly RGC-5 or primary cells), 
      genetic reagents (biomaterials like gelatin, hyaluronic acid with specific grades/sources),
      computational tools (image analysis software like ImageJ, statistical analysis),
      antibodies (for cell characterization and viability assessment)
    - LIKELY: animal models (rodent models for retinal studies, possibly rats or mice),
      advanced cellular models (3D cultures, potentially retinal organoids)
    - POSSIBLE: clinical assessment tools (if functional vision outcomes measured),
      patient-derived models (if using patient-derived retinal cells)
    
    This bioengineering/regenerative medicine study combining materials science with cell biology
    would typically require extensive tool usage for hydrogel synthesis, cell culture, characterization,
    and in vivo validation. The complete absence of mined tools is highly suspicious.
  overallAssessment: |
    This lab research publication on hydrogel-based retinal cell therapy would absolutely be expected to use numerous research tools.
    A study developing biomaterial scaffolds for cell replacement therapy requires: biomaterial reagents, cell lines,
    characterization antibodies, viability assays, imaging tools, and likely animal models for validation.
    The fact that ZERO tools were mined suggests major deficiencies in the mining patterns rather than a genuine absence of tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Zero tools mined from a lab research publication that should contain 10+ research tools
    - File contains full publication content (abstract, methods, results, discussion) but mining yielded nothing
    - This represents a complete mining failure for bioengineering/biomaterials research
    - Missing patterns for: biomaterial reagents, retinal cell biology tools, hydrogel chemistry
    - Publication about gelatin-hyaluronic acid hydrogels for retinal therapy requires extensive tool usage
  recommendations: |
    This case represents a CRITICAL mining failure for bioengineering research that requires immediate attention:
    
    1. BIOMATERIALS MINING PATTERNS (URGENT):
       - Add comprehensive patterns for gelatin (Type A/B, bloom strength, vendor catalogs)
       - Add hyaluronic acid patterns (molecular weight specifications, crosslinking grades)
       - Add crosslinking agent patterns (EDC, NHS, glutaraldehyde, genipin)
       - Add polymer characterization tools (rheometer, DSC, SEM, FTIR)
    
    2. RETINAL RESEARCH TOOLS (HIGH PRIORITY):
       - Add retinal ganglion cell patterns (RGC-5, R28, primary RGCs)
       - Add retinal marker antibodies (Brn3a, Thy1, RBPMS, β-III tubulin)
       - Add vision research models (retinal injury models, optic nerve crush)
       - Add retinal assessment tools (ERG, OCT, histological stains)
    
    3. CELL VIABILITY AND CHARACTERIZATION:
       - Add LIVE/DEAD assay patterns (calcein AM, ethidium homodimer)
       - Add proliferation assays (MTT, alamarBlue, BrdU, Ki67)
       - Add cell morphology tools (phalloidin, DAPI, immunofluorescence)
       - Add microscopy platforms (confocal, fluorescence, phase contrast)
    
    4. COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS TOOLS:
       - Ensure ImageJ/FIJI detection with plugin mentions
       - Add statistical software patterns (GraphPad Prism, R, SPSS)
       - Add image analysis workflows (cell counting, morphometry)
    
    5. MANUAL REVIEW AND BENCHMARKING:
       - Use this publication as benchmark for tissue engineering tool detection
       - Manually extract all tools from the full text to identify pattern gaps
       - Test new patterns against this and similar bioengineering publications
    
    PRIORITY: CRITICAL - Bioengineering/tissue engineering research is highly relevant to NF studies
    (nerve repair, tumor microenvironment, regenerative approaches). Current patterns are inadequate.
