  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple research tools are clearly present in the Methods section including mouse strains, 
      primary cell cultures, viral vectors, antibodies, and analysis platforms
    - The mining system appears to have missed standard research tools with clear experimental context
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous legitimate research tools that were completely missed by 
    the initial mining. All 13 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine
    research reagents used in the experimental procedures. The suggested patterns would help
    capture similar tools in future mining. No observations were extracted since no tools were
    initially validated, but this study would likely contain valuable phenotypic observations
    about Nf1 knockout effects on astrocyte proliferation once tools are properly identified.
