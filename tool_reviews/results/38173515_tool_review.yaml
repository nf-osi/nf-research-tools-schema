  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a computational methods development paper that should contain:
    - Computational tools (primary focus - image analysis software development)
    - Possibly clinical assessment tools (volumetric measurement methods for clinical trials)
    
    The paper develops image segmentation algorithms for medical imaging analysis, which are
    computational tools. It also describes methods for clinical volumetric assessment of
    tumors, which could be considered clinical assessment tools for monitoring treatment response.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication develops computational image analysis methods for medical imaging and should
    definitely contain computational tools. The authors developed "SSTMean" and reference "SSTMini"
    segmentation algorithms, implemented in MATLAB. The mining completely missed these tools, indicating
    significant gaps in computational tool detection patterns.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Mining completely failed to detect any computational tools in a methods development paper
    - Primary algorithm "SSTMean" (the main contribution) was not detected
    - Comparison algorithm "SSTMini" was not detected  
    - Standard software tools (MATLAB, FSLeyes) were not detected
    - Image processing techniques and statistical methods were not detected
    - This represents a major gap in computational tool mining patterns
  recommendations: |
    - ALL 4-6 missed tools should be added to the database (SSTMean, SSTMini, MATLAB, FSLeyes definitely; Gaussian filter and Bland-Altman plots possibly)
    - Implement suggested patterns immediately to catch algorithm development papers
    - Review mining patterns for computational tools - they appear inadequate for methods papers
    - Add patterns for custom algorithm acronyms and comparative algorithm mentions
    - Improve detection of software with version numbers and neuroimaging tools
    - No observations were extracted as this is a methods paper without biological findings
    - This publication demonstrates significant mining gaps that need urgent attention
