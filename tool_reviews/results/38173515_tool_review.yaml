    Bioinformatics Analysis → computational tools (software, pipelines, image analysis tools)
    This publication develops a computational method for medical image analysis, specifically for
    volumetric quantification of plexiform neurofibromas using MRI data. Expected tools include:
    - Image analysis software (MATLAB, FSLeyes)
    - Statistical analysis tools
    - Custom algorithms/scripts for segmentation
    - MRI analysis pipelines
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a methods development paper focused on creating a semi-automatic segmentation algorithm
    for MRI-based tumor volume quantification. The publication develops computational tools and
    compares different image analysis approaches, making it highly likely to contain research tools.
    The Methods section describes detailed computational procedures and software usage.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a computational methods paper
    - Multiple computational tools are clearly present in the Methods section
    - MATLAB with specific version number used for algorithm implementation
    - FSLeyes neuroimaging software used for manual segmentation validation
    - Custom algorithms (SSTMean, SSTMini) developed/used for tumor segmentation
  recommendations: |
    All four potentially missed tools should be added to the mining results:
    - MATLAB (v9.9.0) is clearly used for algorithm implementation
    - FSLeyes is used for manual tumor tracing and validation
    - SSTMean is the novel algorithm developed by the authors
    - SSTMini is a comparison algorithm from previous work
    The mining patterns need improvement to capture computational tools in medical imaging contexts.
    No observations were extracted as no tools were initially validated, but the Results section
    likely contains performance metrics for these computational tools.
