  title: "Modeling human cancer predisposition syndromes using CRISPR/Cas9 in human cell line models."
  queryType: "bench"  # From PubMed query (hint only)
  publicationType: "Review Article"
  publicationTypeConfidence: 1.0  # Very clear from title and abstract content
  hasMethodsSection: No
  likelyContainsTools: No
  expectedToolTypes: |
    Review articles typically do not contain actual research tools being used experimentally.
    They may mention tools conceptually or cite tools from other studies, but do not typically
    report original experimental usage. This review discusses CRISPR/Cas9 methodology and
    various cancer predisposition syndromes, but as a review it would cite tools rather than
    use them directly. Expected tool types would be minimal or none for direct usage.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a review article that discusses CRISPR/Cas9 approaches for modeling cancer predisposition
    syndromes. Review articles typically cite tools from other studies rather than reporting original
    experimental usage. Without Methods, Results, or Discussion sections, there is no experimental
    context that would indicate direct tool usage.

    whyMissed: "Generic reference to 'human cell lines' without specific cell line names or experimental context"

suggestedPatterns:
  - patternType: "context_phrase"
    pattern: "exclude review articles from tool mining"
    toolType: "general"
    examples: ["This review focuses on", "We examine", "We discuss the possibilities"]
    reasoning: "Review articles typically cite tools rather than use them experimentally. Patterns that identify review articles could help filter out false positives from conceptual tool mentions."
  - patternType: "context_phrase"
    pattern: "require experimental context for CRISPR/Cas9 mentions"
    toolType: "genetic_reagent"
    examples: ["we used CRISPR", "cells were transfected with", "guide RNAs targeting"]
    reasoning: "CRISPR/Cas9 is often mentioned conceptually in reviews. Requiring specific experimental usage context would reduce false positives."

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a review article, not original research
    - No Methods, Results, or Discussion sections available
    - Only abstract text available for analysis
    - CRISPR/Cas9 and cell lines mentioned conceptually, not experimentally
    - Review articles typically cite tools from other studies rather than report original usage
  recommendations: |
    This publication should not contribute any tools to the database. It is a review article that
    discusses CRISPR/Cas9 approaches conceptually rather than reporting original experimental usage.
    The mining algorithm correctly identified zero tools. The mentions of CRISPR/Cas9 and human cell
    lines are too generic and lack experimental context. Future mining should consider filtering
    out review articles or requiring stronger experimental context for tool identification.
    No observations can be extracted since no tools were validated and no experimental sections
    are available.
