    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This is a single-cell RNA sequencing study with extensive computational analysis, flow cytometry,
    and immunohistochemistry. Expected tools include: computational tools (R packages, analysis software),
    antibodies (for flow cytometry and IHC), potentially cell lines or primary cells, and various
    laboratory reagents for sample processing.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study involving single-cell RNA sequencing, flow cytometry,
    and immunohistochemistry on human schwannoma samples. The publication contains extensive methods describing
    computational analysis pipelines, antibody usage, and sample processing protocols. Multiple research tools
    are expected across computational, antibody, and reagent categories.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple specific antibodies with clone numbers and catalog numbers were missed
    - Several R packages for single-cell analysis were not captured
    - Commercial reagent kits and laboratory equipment were not detected
    - The mining patterns appear to be missing key computational tools and antibody identifiers
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous research tools that were completely missed by the initial mining.
    The study uses multiple specific antibodies with clone numbers and catalog numbers, several R packages
    for computational analysis, and commercial reagent kits. The mining patterns need significant improvement
    to capture: 1) Antibodies with clone numbers and vendor information, 2) R packages mentioned in methods,
    3) Single-cell analysis protocols like Smart-seq2, 4) Image analysis software like QuPath, and
    5) Commercial reagent kits. All 12 potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine
    research tools used in this study. No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated.
