  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a laboratory research publication focused on single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of schwannoma tumors.
    Expected tool types include:
    - Antibodies (for cell sorting and immunohistochemistry)
    - Computational tools (for scRNA-seq analysis, data processing, statistical analysis)
    - Genetic reagents (cell dissociation kits, fluorescent dyes)
    - Advanced cellular models (primary tumor cells, single-cell suspensions)
    
    The publication involves extensive wet lab procedures (tumor dissociation, cell sorting, immunostaining) 
    and computational analysis (scRNA-seq processing, clustering, differential expression), making it highly 
    likely to contain multiple research tools across several categories.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing study that should contain numerous research tools.
    The detailed Methods section describes extensive experimental procedures including tumor processing,
    cell sorting with multiple antibodies, single-cell sequencing, and computational analysis pipelines.
    The absence of mined tools suggests significant gaps in the mining process rather than lack of tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: No tools were mined from this publication despite extensive experimental methods
    - Publication contains detailed Methods section with numerous research tools
    - Multiple antibodies with clone numbers and vendors completely missed
    - Computational tools (R packages, analysis software) not detected
    - Commercial reagents and kits with vendor information not captured
    - Single-cell RNA sequencing protocols not recognized
    - Flow cytometry reagents and instruments not identified
  recommendations: |
    This publication represents a major failure of the mining system. Despite being a comprehensive
    laboratory research study with extensive experimental methods, zero tools were detected.
    
    IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED:
    1. Add all 14 identified tools to the database - they represent clear research tools with vendor/catalog information
    2. Implement the 8 suggested patterns to capture similar tools in future mining
    3. Review mining patterns for antibodies - multiple clear examples were missed
    4. Improve computational tool detection for R packages and analysis software
    5. Add patterns for commercial reagent kits and fluorescent dyes
    
    TOOL CATEGORIES COMPLETELY MISSED:
    - Antibodies: 5 clear examples with clones and catalog numbers
    - Computational tools: 5 software packages and analysis tools
    - Genetic reagents: 4 commercial reagents and kits
    
    This publication should serve as a test case for validating improved mining patterns.
    The high-quality Methods section provides excellent examples of how research tools are
    typically described in scientific literature.
