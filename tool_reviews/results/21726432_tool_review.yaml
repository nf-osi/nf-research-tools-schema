    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    This study combines laboratory research (mouse models, molecular biology techniques) with clinical 
    biomarker analysis. Expected tools include animal models (Nf1 conditional knockout mice), antibodies 
    (anti-MIA), molecular biology reagents (primers, enzymes), and computational tools for analysis.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a translational research study combining laboratory mouse model work with clinical biomarker 
    validation. The study uses conditional Nf1 knockout mice, molecular biology techniques (qRT-PCR, 
    in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry), and clinical sample analysis. Multiple research tool 
    types are expected including animal models, antibodies, genetic reagents, and computational tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a clear laboratory research study
    - Multiple research tools are present in the methods section but were not captured
    - Animal models with specific genetic modifications (Nf1Prx1, Nf1flox) were missed
    - Commercial reagents and antibodies with vendor information were not detected
    - Analysis software with version numbers were not recognized
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous legitimate research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The study uses conditional knockout mice, specific antibodies, molecular biology reagents, and analysis software.
    All 10 potentially missed tools should be added to improve mining coverage for NF research.
    The suggested patterns would significantly improve detection of NF-specific mouse models and laboratory tools.
    Manual curator review is recommended to validate the genetic nomenclature and ensure proper tool classification.
