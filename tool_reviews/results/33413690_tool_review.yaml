    This is clearly a laboratory research study using single-cell RNA sequencing, qPCR, immunohistochemistry,
    and histological analysis. Expected tool types include:
    - Antibodies (for immunohistochemistry)
    - Computational tools (Cell Ranger, Seurat, R packages)
    - Genetic reagents (qPCR primers)
    - Cell culture reagents and kits
    
    The publication combines molecular biology, bioinformatics, and histological techniques, so multiple
    tool categories are expected.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study that should contain multiple research tools.
    The methods section describes detailed experimental procedures including single-cell RNA sequencing,
    qPCR, immunohistochemistry, and histological analysis. Such studies typically use numerous research
    tools including antibodies, computational software, and molecular biology reagents. The fact that
    no tools were initially mined suggests significant gaps in the mining patterns.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive laboratory research study
    - Mining patterns completely failed to detect 14+ clear research tools including:
      * 4 antibodies with vendor/catalog information
      * 2 major computational tools (Cell Ranger, Seurat) with version numbers
      * 8 molecular biology reagents and instruments with specific product names
    - All missed tools have clear experimental usage context in detailed Methods section
    - This represents a major failure of the mining system for this publication type
  recommendations: |
    - ALL 14 identified tools should be added to the database - they are clearly genuine research tools
    - The mining patterns need significant improvement to catch:
      * Antibodies with standard naming (species + anti-target)
      * Vendor/catalog number patterns in parentheses
      * Major bioinformatics software (Cell Ranger, Seurat)
      * Commercial kits and reagents with product names
      * Laboratory instruments with model numbers
    - This publication demonstrates that current mining is missing many legitimate tools
    - Suggest comprehensive review of mining patterns for laboratory research publications
    - Consider adding patterns for standard molecular biology workflows (RNA-seq, qPCR, IHC)
