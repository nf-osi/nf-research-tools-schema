    Lab Research → antibodies, cell lines, animal models, genetic reagents, computational tools, organoids, PDX
    
    This publication is a comprehensive laboratory research study involving:
    - Immunohistochemistry (antibodies expected)
    - Next generation sequencing (computational tools expected)
    - Telomere-specific FISH/CISH assays (genetic reagents expected)
    - Tissue sample analysis (potential cell lines or animal models)
    
    The study analyzes 426 tumor samples with detailed molecular techniques, so multiple tool types
    are expected across antibodies, computational tools, and genetic reagents categories.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study that should definitely contain research tools.
    The methods section describes extensive experimental procedures including immunohistochemistry,
    FISH/CISH assays, next generation sequencing, and statistical analysis. The complete absence
    of mined tools suggests significant mining failures rather than genuine absence of tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Complete mining failure - 0 tools found in a comprehensive lab research study
    - Multiple antibodies with catalog numbers completely missed (ATRX, DAXX, H3K27me3, anti-Cy3/Cy5)
    - Genetic reagents (PNA probes) with specific sequences missed
    - Extensive computational tools missed (16+ software tools with versions)
    - All tools have clear vendor information, catalog numbers, or version numbers
    - Methods section contains detailed protocols that should trigger tool detection
  recommendations: |
    URGENT: This represents a complete mining system failure. A comprehensive laboratory study 
    with detailed methods yielded zero tools, indicating fundamental problems with mining patterns.
    
    Immediate actions needed:
    1. Review and fix antibody detection patterns - multiple clear antibodies with catalogs missed
    2. Add computational tool patterns for software with versions (GraphPad, SAS, R, BWA, etc.)
    3. Add genetic reagent patterns for probes and PNA sequences
    4. Test patterns against this publication to ensure they capture the missed tools
    5. Consider this a high-priority test case for pattern validation
    
    All 17 potentially missed tools should be added to the database as they represent clear,
    unambiguous research tools with proper vendor/catalog information or version numbers.
    
    The 5 usage instruction observations provide valuable protocol information for antibodies
    and genetic reagents that could benefit other researchers.
