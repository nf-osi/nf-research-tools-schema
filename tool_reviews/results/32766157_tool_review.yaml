  expectedToolTypes: |
    Review Article → Typically does not contain research tools
    - Review articles synthesize existing literature and rarely describe original experimental work
    - May cite tools from other studies but do not use them experimentally
    - Focus is on summarizing and analyzing published findings rather than conducting new research
    - Absence of Methods and Results sections strongly indicates this is not experimental research
    - HSP90 modulators topic suggests pharmacological/therapeutic focus rather than tool development
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication is a review article about HSP90 chaperone modulators in cancer, lacking both Methods and Results sections.
    Review articles typically synthesize existing literature rather than conduct original experimental work, making research tool usage highly unlikely.
    The absence of experimental sections and the review nature of the content strongly suggest no genuine research tools would be present.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Publication is a review article, not original experimental research
    - No Methods section present, indicating no experimental procedures
    - No Results section present, indicating no experimental findings
    - Review articles typically cite tools from other studies but do not use them experimentally
    - HSP90 modulators topic focuses on therapeutic compounds rather than research tools
  recommendations: |
    This publication should not contain any research tools based on its review article nature:
    - Review articles synthesize existing literature rather than conduct original experiments
    - Absence of Methods and Results sections confirms lack of experimental work
    - Any tool mentions would likely be citations from other studies, not experimental usage
    - Mining algorithms should consider publication type and section structure to avoid false positives
    - Future mining could benefit from early classification of review vs. experimental articles
    - No manual curator review needed - clear case of inappropriate publication type for tool mining
