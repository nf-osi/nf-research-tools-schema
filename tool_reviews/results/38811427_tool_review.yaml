  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a questionnaire validation study, which should contain:
    - Clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, scales, outcome measures)
    - Possibly computational tools for statistical analysis (R, SPSS, etc.)
    
    The study validates the Dutch cNF-Skindex and uses established instruments (EQ-5D-5L, SF-36)
    for convergent validity testing. Statistical methods mentioned include Cronbach's alpha,
    Spearman correlations, exploratory factor analysis, and multivariable linear regression,
    which may involve statistical software tools.
  overallAssessment: |
    This questionnaire validation study should definitely contain clinical assessment tools.
    The abstract explicitly mentions three validated instruments: cNF-Skindex (Dutch version),
    EQ-5D-5L, and SF-36. These are legitimate research tools used to measure quality of life
    outcomes in patients with neurofibromatosis. The mining system failed to detect any of
    these tools, representing a significant gap in clinical assessment tool detection.

    pattern: "cNF-Skindex|Dutch cNF-Skindex"
    toolType: "clinical_assessment_tool"
    examples: ["cNF-Skindex", "Dutch cNF-Skindex"]
    reasoning: "Disease-specific quality of life instruments often follow naming pattern of disease abbreviation + instrument type. This pattern would catch neurofibromatosis-specific tools."

    pattern: "EQ-5D-5L|EQ-5D|EuroQol"
    toolType: "clinical_assessment_tool"
    examples: ["EQ-5D-5L"]
    reasoning: "EuroQol instruments are widely used quality of life measures in clinical research. Multiple variants exist (EQ-5D-3L, EQ-5D-5L) that should be captured."

  - patternType: "term"
    pattern: "SF-36|SF-12|Short Form"
    toolType: "clinical_assessment_tool"
    examples: ["SF-36"]
    reasoning: "SF-36 and SF-12 are among the most commonly used generic health-related quality of life instruments. These should be standard patterns for clinical assessment tool mining."

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - Complete failure to detect clinical assessment tools in a questionnaire validation study
    - Mining system appears to lack patterns for standard quality of life instruments (SF-36, EQ-5D-5L)
    - Disease-specific questionnaire naming conventions not recognized (cNF-Skindex)
    - Localized instrument versions not detected (Dutch cNF-Skindex)
    - No computational tools detected despite statistical analysis methods mentioned
  recommendations: |
    This publication represents a significant gap in clinical assessment tool mining. Four legitimate
    clinical assessment tools were completely missed:
    
    1. cNF-Skindex - Disease-specific quality of life questionnaire (primary tool being validated)
    2. Dutch cNF-Skindex - Localized version of the questionnaire
    3. EQ-5D-5L - Standard quality of life instrument used for validation
    4. SF-36 - Widely used generic health-related quality of life instrument
    
    All four tools should be added to the mining results. The mining system needs significant
    improvement in clinical assessment tool detection, particularly for:
    - Standard quality of life instruments (SF-36, EQ-5D variants)
    - Disease-specific questionnaires with abbreviated naming
    - Localized/translated versions of instruments
    - Context recognition for psychometric validation studies
    
    Additionally, statistical software tools may have been missed (abstract mentions multiple
    statistical methods but no software is specified). Future mining should look for computational
    tools in the context of statistical analysis, even when only abstract text is available.
    
    No observations could be extracted since no tools were validated, but this publication would
    likely contain valuable psychometric data about the instruments if full text were available.
