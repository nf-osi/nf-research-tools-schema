    This is a questionnaire validation study, which typically contains:
    - Clinical assessment tools (questionnaires, scales) - PRIMARY FOCUS
    - Computational tools for statistical analysis (secondary)
    
    The study validates the Dutch version of the cNF-Skindex questionnaire and uses other validated instruments (EQ-5D-5L, SF-36) for convergent validity testing. Statistical software is used for psychometric analysis.
  overallAssessment: |
    This questionnaire validation study is highly likely to contain clinical assessment tools as the primary research focus. The study validates a disease-specific quality of life instrument and uses established questionnaires for comparison. Statistical analysis tools may also be present for psychometric evaluation, though these are typically generic software packages.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a questionnaire validation study
    - Clinical assessment tools (questionnaires) are the primary research instruments but were not detected
    - The mining system appears to miss disease-specific questionnaires and standard clinical assessment tools
    - Electronic data capture systems used for questionnaire administration were also missed
  recommendations: |
    All four potentially missed tools should be added as they represent genuine research instruments:
    - cNF-Skindex: Primary tool being validated, disease-specific QoL questionnaire
    - EQ-5D-5L and SF-36: Standard validated instruments for convergent validity
    - Castor EDC: Electronic data capture system for questionnaire administration
    
    The mining patterns need enhancement for clinical assessment tools, particularly disease-specific questionnaires and standard health status instruments. No observations were extracted as no tools were initially validated, but the validated questionnaires would likely have psychometric properties reported in Results/Discussion sections.
