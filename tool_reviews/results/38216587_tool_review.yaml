    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study involving:
    - Cell lines (HEI-193 schwannoma cells, HEK-293T, Human/Mouse Schwann cells)
    - Antibodies (extensive immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry panels)
    - Computational tools (multiple bioinformatics pipelines and software)
    - Genetic reagents (CRISPR libraries, plasmids, sgRNAs)
    - Advanced cellular models (primary patient-derived schwannoma cell cultures)
    - Patient-derived models (primary human vestibular schwannomas)
    
    The study uses single-cell/single-nuclei RNA sequencing, ATAC-seq, mass cytometry (CyTOF), 
    DNA methylation profiling, proteomics, metabolomics, and extensive molecular biology techniques.
    All major tool categories except clinical assessment tools are expected.
  overallAssessment: |
    This publication represents a highly sophisticated laboratory research study that extensively 
    uses research tools across multiple categories. The comprehensive Methods section describes 
    detailed experimental procedures using cell lines, antibodies, computational analysis pipelines, 
    genetic reagents, and patient-derived models. The fact that no tools were initially mined 
    suggests significant gaps in the mining patterns, as this paper should contain dozens of 
    research tools across multiple categories.

      HEI-193 schwannoma cells showed reduced growth and proliferation in response to radiotherapy 
      treatment (1.8 Gy x 5 fractions or 12.5 Gy x 1 fraction). Radiotherapy blocked Hedgehog 
      target gene expression and induced expression of inflammatory apolipoproteins and immediate 
      early genes. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed 15 distinct cell states after radiotherapy, 
      with activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress, interferon signaling, and p53 signaling pathways.

      Human Schwann cells exhibited primary cilia that accumulated Smoothened protein and activated

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: No tools were mined from this publication despite it being a comprehensive 
      laboratory research study with extensive use of research tools
    - The mining patterns appear to have significant gaps in detecting:
      * Standard cell line names (HEI-193, HEK-293T, etc.)
      * Antibodies with catalog numbers and vendor information
      * Computational tools with version numbers (minfi, Seurat, DESeq2, etc.)
      * CRISPR reagents and libraries
      * Patient-derived primary cell cultures
    - This represents a major failure of the mining system for a tool-rich publication
  recommendations: |
    - ALL 18 potentially missed tools should be added to the database
    - The 6 suggested patterns should be implemented to improve mining coverage
    - This publication demonstrates the need for better pattern coverage across all tool types
    - The mining system needs significant improvement to catch standard research tools
    - Consider manual curation of high-impact publications like this Nature Communications paper
    - The observations extracted show the scientific value that can be captured from tool usage
    - Future mining should prioritize publications from high-impact journals with comprehensive methods sections
