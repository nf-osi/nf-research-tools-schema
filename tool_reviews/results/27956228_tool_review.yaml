  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a comprehensive lab research study
    - Extensive use of research tools across multiple categories was missed
    - CRISPR screening libraries, cell lines, mouse models, antibodies, and computational tools all present
    - Mining patterns appear insufficient for capturing tools in genomics/cancer research contexts
  recommendations: |
    This publication contains numerous high-quality research tools that were completely missed by initial mining.
    The study uses sophisticated CRISPR screening technology, multiple mouse models, specific cell lines,
    antibodies with vendor information, and a comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline. All 17 potentially
    missed tools should be added as they represent genuine research tools with clear experimental usage.
    The suggested patterns would significantly improve mining accuracy for similar genomics studies.
    Manual curator review is recommended to validate the extensive tool usage described in the Methods section.
