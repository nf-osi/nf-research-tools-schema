  expectedToolTypes: |
    This is a laboratory research publication focused on developing patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models
    and 3D microtissue platforms for MPNST drug screening. Expected tool types include:
    - Patient-derived models (PDX models, which are explicitly described)
    - Advanced cellular models (3D microtissues, organoid-like structures)
    - Animal models (NRG mice, NOD-Rag1 null IL2rg mice)
    - Cell lines (ST88-14 MPNST cell line mentioned)
    - Antibodies (multiple antibodies listed for flow cytometry and immunofluorescence)
    - Computational tools (multiple bioinformatics tools and software mentioned)
    - Genetic reagents (various kits and reagents for cell processing)
    
    The publication spans multiple tool categories as it involves both model development and
    computational analysis of genomic data.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a comprehensive laboratory research study that extensively uses and develops multiple types of research tools.
    The detailed Methods section describes PDX model establishment, 3D microtissue fabrication, genomic analysis pipelines,
    and drug screening protocols. The complete absence of mined tools suggests significant gaps in the mining algorithm,
    as this publication clearly contains numerous antibodies, computational tools, animal models, and advanced cellular models.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - CRITICAL: Complete mining failure - zero tools detected from a publication rich in research tools
    - Publication contains extensive Methods section with detailed protocols using numerous research tools
    - Multiple tool categories present: antibodies (10+), computational tools (12+), animal models (2), cell lines (1), advanced cellular models (1), patient-derived models (1), genetic reagents (3)
    - Mining patterns appear to miss standard bioinformatics tools, antibody naming conventions, mouse strain nomenclature, and commercial kit terminology
    - No Results or Discussion sections provided, preventing observation extraction
  recommendations: |
    - URGENT: Review and expand mining patterns to capture the tool types identified in this publication
    - Add patterns for bioinformatics software (Trimmomatic, GATK, BWA-MEM, etc.)
    - Add patterns for antibody targets without 'anti-' prefix but with catalog numbers
    - Add patterns for mouse strain nomenclature (NRG, NOD-Rag1 null IL2rg)
    - Add patterns for commercial kits with catalog numbers and vendor information
    - Add patterns for 3D culture models and PDX terminology
    - Consider context-based mining around phrases like "using", "analyzed with", "antibodies and stains"
    - This publication demonstrates significant gaps in current mining coverage
    - All 28 potentially missed tools should be added to improve future mining accuracy
    - The 10 suggested patterns would significantly improve tool detection for similar publications
