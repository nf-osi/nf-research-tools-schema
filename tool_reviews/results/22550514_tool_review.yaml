  expectedToolTypes: |
    Review Article → May reference various research tools from cited studies including:
    - Cell lines and cellular models (SKPs, stem cells)
    - Animal models (mouse models of NF1)
    - Antibodies/markers (S100β)
    - Genetic reagents (NF1 knockout constructs)
    
    This review specifically discusses experimental models and tools for NF1 research,
    so it's likely to mention tools even without original experimental data.
    However, tools mentioned may be from cited studies rather than used directly.
  overallAssessment: |
    This is a review article discussing skin-derived precursor cells as modeling tools for NF1 research.
    While it lacks Methods/Results sections typical of experimental papers, it extensively discusses
    various cellular and animal models used in NF1 research. The publication would be expected to
    reference research tools from the literature it reviews, making tool mentions likely but primarily
    as citations rather than direct experimental usage.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    Major issues found during review:
    - Mining algorithm failed to detect any tools despite clear tool mentions in the text
    - Publication is a review article, so tools mentioned are primarily from cited studies rather than direct experimental usage
    - Several cellular models and research tools are discussed as the main focus of the review
    - S100β marker detection suggests antibody usage but was not captured
    - Genetic notation for knockout cell lines (NF1(-/-), NF1(+/-)) was not recognized
  recommendations: |
    Overall recommendations for this publication:
    - The mining algorithm needs significant improvement to capture tools mentioned in review articles
    - At least 4-6 legitimate research tools were missed, particularly cellular models and markers
    - New patterns should be added to capture genetic notation and stem cell terminology
    - Review articles should be treated as valid sources of tool information, even without Methods sections
    - The SKPs mentioned are both the subject of study AND research tools, requiring nuanced classification
    - Consider adding context-aware mining that recognizes when tools are discussed as research models
    - S100β and similar protein markers need better pattern recognition for antibody detection
