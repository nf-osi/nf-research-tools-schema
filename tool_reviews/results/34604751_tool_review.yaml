  expectedToolTypes: |
    Based on publication type (Clinical Study with imaging analysis):
    - Computational tools for image analysis and volumetric measurements (Osirix software mentioned)
    - Clinical assessment tools for patient evaluation and outcome measures
    - Potentially medical devices/equipment (MR-HIFU system, MRI scanners)
    
    Note: This is a clinical feasibility study using retrospective MRI analysis, so computational
    tools for image processing and measurement are expected. Clinical assessment tools may be
    present for patient selection criteria and outcome evaluation.
  overallAssessment: |
    This clinical feasibility study evaluates MR-HIFU treatment for NF1 patients using retrospective
    MRI analysis. The study involves computational image analysis tools (Osirix software) and clinical
    assessment methods for patient evaluation. Tools are expected for image processing, volumetric
    analysis, and potentially clinical outcome measures, though the focus is on technical feasibility
    rather than traditional lab research tools.

  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were mined from this publication despite clear usage of computational tools
    - Osirix imaging software with version info was completely missed - this is a clear computational tool
    - Statistical analysis methods (Chi-squared, Wilcoxon, Kruskal-Wallis) were not captured
    - Clinical diagnostic criteria (NIH criteria for NF1) represents a clinical assessment tool
    - Medical device systems (MR-HIFU) mentioned but not captured as tools
  recommendations: |
    This publication should have yielded several computational tools and potentially clinical assessment tools:
    
    DEFINITELY ADD:
    - Osirix software (v10.0.0) - clear computational tool with vendor/version info used for image analysis
    
    CONSIDER ADDING:
    - Statistical tests (Chi-squared, Wilcoxon, Kruskal-Wallis) if statistical methods are considered tools
    - NIH diagnostic criteria for NF1 as clinical assessment tool
    - Profound Sonalleve V2 system as medical device/computational tool
    
    PATTERN IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:
    - Add patterns for medical imaging software (Osirix, ImageJ, etc.)
    - Include statistical test methods in computational tool patterns
    - Capture diagnostic criteria as clinical assessment tools
    - Improve detection of medical device systems with version numbers
    
    This represents a significant gap in tool mining - clear computational tools with specific versions
    and vendors were completely missed, suggesting the current patterns are insufficient for clinical
    imaging studies.
