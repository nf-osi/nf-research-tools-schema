  majorIssuesFound: |
    - No tools were initially mined despite this being a clear laboratory research study
    - Multiple cell lines (T265, S462, NSF1, BRGN, HSC) were completely missed
    - Antibodies with clear vendor information were not captured
    - Computational tools including well-known software (GraphPad Prism, CLC Genomics Workbench) were missed
    - Python libraries used for analysis were not detected
    - Mining patterns appear to be insufficient for this type of molecular biology study
  recommendations: |
    This publication represents a significant failure of the mining system - 14 clear research tools were missed
    from a well-structured methods section. The tools include:
    
    CELL LINES (5): T265, S462, NSF1 (MPNST lines), BRGN (control), HSC (primary Schwann cells)
    ANTIBODIES (2): S100 primary antibody, Anti-Mouse IgG secondary antibody  
    COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS (7): CLC Genomics Workbench, GraphPad Prism, CosinorPy, NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, SciPy
    
    All tools should be added to the database. The mining patterns need significant improvement to catch:
    1. MPNST cell line naming conventions
    2. Primary cell lines with catalog numbers
    3. Control cell lines with non-standard names
    4. Antibodies with vendor information
    5. Computational tools and Python libraries used in analysis
    
    No observations were extracted since no tools were initially validated, but this publication likely contains
    valuable experimental findings about circadian gene expression in MPNST cells that should be captured once
    tools are properly identified.
