PMID:39472976,172,NFC antibody,Antibody,Usage Instructions,"The NFC monoclonal antibody recognizes a C-terminal epitope within the last 281 amino acids 
of human neurofibromin. Demonstrated 86% sensitivity for detecting tumors with confirmed NF1 
genomic loss. Used at 1:10 dilution for immunohistochemistry. Inter-core heterogeneity noted 
within tumors, with seven displaying mixture of cores showing both retained and absent 
immunoreactivity. High concordance (82%) between independent scorers.

PMID:39472976,172,iNF-07E antibody,Antibody,Usage Instructions,"iNF-07E is a monoclonal antibody that recognizes amino acids 863–867 of NF1. Demonstrated 
57% sensitivity for detecting tumors with confirmed NF1 genomic loss. Used at 1:20 dilution 
for immunohistochemistry. Minimal inter-core heterogeneity observed, with no tumors 
exhibiting cores with both intact and absent staining.

PMID:39472976,172,NFC antibody,Antibody,Issue,"NFC antibody was immunoreactive in one tumor with an NF1 truncating mutation (E2624*) that 
was distal to the antibody recognition site. This truncation preserves a portion of the NFC 
antibody epitope and was the most C-terminal truncation present in the cohort. Highlights 
importance of interpreting IHC in concordance with genomic data.

PMID:35118381,vdab184,GL261,Cell Line,Tumor Growth,"GL261 glioma cells formed subcutaneous tumors that reached sizes of 400-500 mm³ when implanted in C57BL6 mice. This tumor size was selected to ensure consistent C. novyi-NT germination, as inconsistent germination was observed in smaller tumors in this model.
