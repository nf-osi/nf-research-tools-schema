  "methods": "Materials and Methods Drosophila maintenance Flies were raised on  Drosophila  cornmeal/agar food medium according to standard protocols and housed at 25 °C, 60% relative humidity, on a 12:12 h light:dark cycle. The  nf1  mutation was backcrossed six generations into the control genetic background wCS10. RNAi lines were obtained from the Vienna  P1 Drosophila  RNAi Center, Gal4/+ control crosses consisted of an empty attP control line (VDRC #60100). UAS-dicer2 was included to potentiate the RNAi effect [ 97 ], and was included all genotypes containing the UAS-RNAi. Male flies were used for all experiments, unless otherwise specified, to prevent egg accumulation in behavioral and respirometry chambers. Behavioral analysis Spontaneous grooming was quantified in an open field [ 44 ,  98 ]. Individual animals were aspirated into an open field area, 15.4 mm in diameter and 2.85 mm in height, consisting of an opaque white PLA boundary wall covered on the top and bottom with clear polycarbonate sheets. The arena was illuminated from below with light from white light-emitting diodes that was diffused through a sheet of white acrylic. Light intensity was measured at 720 lm/m 2  in the location of the fly. Videos were recorded at 7.5 frames per second, 1,616 × 1,240, lossless Motion JPEG 2000 compression using a camera mounted above the chamber (FLIR Teledyne Blackfly S) fitted with a 25 mm lens (Edmund Optics). Five-min videos were recorded 30 min following the introduction into the open-field arena. Grooming was manually scored via frame-by-frame analysis, recording the start and stop frame for each grooming bout. Grooming was calculated as the percent of total time grooming during the 5-minute video. Metabolic analysis CO 2  production was quantified via respirometry [ 11 ,  55 ]. Respirometers were constructed by gluing together a 1 ml pipette tip and 50 μl capillary micropipette. Soda lime was placed into each pipette tip between two foam pieces. Flies were sorted under CO 2  anesthesia and allowed to recover for at least 24 h before beginning the experiment. Four flies of the same genotype were aspirated into each respirometer, and the top was sealed with non-hardening modeling clay. Pipette seal was monitored and any that leaked were excluded from analysis. Sixteen respirometers were hung on a custom-made rack in a latch-lid chamber. One control respirometer was left empty in each experiment. The bottom of the chamber was filled with a red water-based dye and the chamber lid was closed/sealed with vacuum grease. The chamber was placed in an incubator and allowed to equilibrate at 25 °C for 1 h. Images were captured every 15 min with PhenoCapture 3.3. The liquid meniscus level was measured in each respirometer after 3 h using Fiji 2.0. Where appropriate, data were normalized to the mean of the control genotypes. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) Heads were collected from adult flies (5–10 days post-eclosion; 30 heads per genotype). Each sample was added to QIAzol Lysis Reagent (Qiagen, catalog #79306) and homogenized using a mortar and pestle. RNA was isolated with the Qiagen RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit. Complimentary DNA library was constructed using LunaScript RT Master Mix (New England Biolabs, catalog #E3025L) with the Random Primer Mix (New England Biolabs, catalog #S1330S). Nf1 gene expression was quantified in fly head samples using Luna Universal qPCR Master Mix (New England Biolabs, catalog #M3003L). Primer sequences were as follows: 5’ -CTTTTGGCACGTTTCGAGGAT-3’ (Nf1_F), 5’ -GGTAGCGCGATATGTGGATCA-3’ (Nf1_R), 5’ -ATGCTAAGCTGTCGCACAAATG-3’ (Rpl32_F), and 5’ -GTTCGATCCGTAACCGATGT-3’ (Rpl32_R). Five biological replicates, with three technical replicates each, were analyzed for each genotype. Analysis of gene expression was performed using standard ΔΔCt analysis. Gene expression was normalized to Rpl32, and log2 fold change was calculated. Western blot analysis For analysis of pERK/ERK/β-tubulin, lysates of five-day old adult fly heads were prepared using RIPA buffer supplemented with Pierce Protease and Phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Scientific). Protein samples were mixed with NuPAGE 4x LDS Sample Buffer (Invitrogen), resolved on 4–15% Tris-Glycine Mini-PROTEAN TGX Stain-Free Protein Gels (Bio-Rad) with Tris Glycine SDS. Gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes and 5% BSA in TBST was used for blocking. Primary antibodies used were rabbit pERK (CST, 9101, 1:1000), rabbit ERK (CST, 4695, 1:1000), and mouse anti-β-tubulin (DHSB, E7, 1:10000). The membranes were washed with TBST, followed by secondary antibody incubation for 1 hour at room temperature. Secondary antibodies used: goat anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) Alexa 800 (Invitrogen, A32730, 1:10000) and donkey anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L), Alexa 680 (Invitrogen, A10043, 1:5000). Membranes were stripped using NewBlot PVDF stripping buffer (LI-COR, 928–40032) after blotting with pERK/β-tubulin, then reblocked in 5% BSA and incubated with ERK/β-tubulin antibodies overnight. Images were captured with an Odyssey XF Imaging System (LI-COR). Immunohistochemistry and imaging Five to ten-day-old adult flies were dissected fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in in Schneider’s  Drosophila  medium and processed as previously described [ 99 ]. Samples were stained with primary antibodies for 3 hours at room temperature and 4 C overnight, followed by secondary antibodies for 3 hours at room temperature and 4 days at 4 C. Incubations were performed in blocking serum (3% normal goat serum). Samples were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) for imaging. The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-GFP (1:1000, Invitrogen), mouse anti-brp (nc82) (1:50, DSHB), goat anti-rabbit IgG, and goat anti-mouse IgG (1:800, Alexa 488 or Alexa 633, respectively, Invitrogen). Mitochondria were fluorescently labeled by expressing UAS-4mtGCaMP3 and immunostaining the GFP subunit of the GCaMP molecule. Cellular nuclei were labeled with DAPI (1:1000, Invitrogen). A Leica SP8 confocal microscope with LAS X software was used to obtain images following standard protocols. Transmission Electron Microscopy and ultrastructure analysis Drosophila  head and flight muscle ultrastructure was imaged following standard Electron Microscopy procedures using a Ted Pella Bio Wave processing microwave with vacuum attachments. The tissue was covered in 2% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% Glutaraldehyde, in 0.1 M Sodium Cacodylate buffer at pH 7.2. After dissection the heads were incubated for 3 days in fixative in a cold room rotator. All processing from fixative to Ethanol were done on ice. The pre-fixed heads were then fixed again in the microwave vacuum processor, followed by 3x millipore water rinses, post-fixed with 1% aqueous osmium tetroxide, and rinsed again 3x with millipore water. Concentrations from 30–100% of Ethanol were used for the initial dehydration series, followed with Propylene Oxide as the final dehydrant. Samples were gradually infiltrated with 3 ratios of propylene oxide and Embed 812, finally going into 3 changes of pure resin under vacuum. Samples were allowed to infiltrate in pure resin overnight on a rotator. The samples were embedded into flat silicone molds and cured in the oven at 62 °C for three days. The polymerized samples were thin-sectioned at 48–50 nm and stained with 1% uranyl acetate for ten minutes followed by lead citrate for one minute before TEM examination. Grids were viewed in a JEOL 1400 Plus transmission electron microscope at 80kV. Images were captured using an AMT XR-16 mid-mount 16 mega-pixel digital camera. Statistical analysis Normality of data was assessed with the D’ Agostino Pearson Test. In figures, box plots graph the median as a line, the interquartile range (IQR) as a box, and whiskers extend to the min/max values. Hypothesis testing was carried out using t tests or ANOVA followed by Šidák’s multiple comparisons tests (parametric), or Wilcoxon rank-sum test or Kruskal-Wallis omnibus test followed by Dunn multiple comparisons tests (nonparametric). Two-way comparisons were carried out with a two-way ANOVA followed by Šidák’s multiple comparisons tests. For RNAi and Gal4-mediated overexpression, the experimental group was compared to heterozygous Gal4/+ and UAS/+ controls and considered positive only if it significantly differed from both controls in the same direction. For double RNAi experiments, the double RNAi group was compared to both single RNAi groups; controls lacking one or both of the drivers and effectors were run in key control experiments. Statistics and graphing were carried out with Graphpad Prism, version 10.1.1.",
  "introduction": "Introduction Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a multisystemic genetic disorder characterized by a spectrum of clinical manifestations, including tumors such as cutaneous and plexiform neurofibromas, optic gliomas, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Cutaneous symptoms include neurofibromas and a range of cutaneous, skeletal, and ocular symptoms. Additional manifestations include neurological symptoms and growth/metabolism-related symptoms such as short stature, metabolic changes, sleep disruption, cognitive/behavioral alterations, and fatigue [ 1 – 12 ]. The condition is caused by loss of function mutations in the Neurofibromin 1 gene, which encodes a large protein called neurofibromin (Nf1). Nf1 is a major Ras-GAP, which directly binds Ras, accelerates the hydrolysis of Ras-GTP, and thereby functions as a negative regulator of Ras signaling [ 13 ,  14 ]. Loss of Nf1 upregulates the activity of multiple downstream pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling (Raf-MEK-ERK) and PI3K/Akt/mTOR. Further, cAMP/PKA levels are reduced [ 12 ,  15 – 20 ]. The MAPK signaling pathway, MEK in particular, is a target for treatment of plexiform neurofibromas in NF1 [ 21 ,  22 ], though with potentially significant adverse reactions [ 23 – 25 ]. This raises several questions, including whether other NF1 symptoms could be targeted with similar approaches. NF1 patients exhibit a range of nontumor symptoms, including increased frequency of learning deficits, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorder [ 26 ]. These cognitive and behavioral symptoms presumably result from neuronal dysfunction caused by the mutations in the  Neurofibromin 1  gene. Animal models exhibit deficiencies in behavioral tasks and neuronal function indicative of cognitive dysfunction [ 2 ,  12 ,  27 – 29 ]. These result from alterations in Ras/ERK and/or dopamine/cAMP signaling. The potential efficacy of targeting MEK (or other MAPK signaling molecules) for treating cognitive and behavioral symptoms in NF1 is unknown. A second major question is whether other signaling pathways could be targeted to treat NF1 symptoms – either alone or in combination with MEK – possibly with fewer side effects. Metabolic alterations represent an understudied aspect of NF1 which may contribute to the development of other symptoms [ 11 ,  12 ,  30 – 32 ]. Patients experience a range of metabolic changes, including reduced cerebral glucose metabolism in the thalamus [ 33 ], lower blood glucose [ 34 ], reductions in muscle mass [ 35 ], decreased muscular strength and force [ 32 ,  36 ], alterations in muscle growth and metabolism, and increased resting energy expenditure [ 32 ]. Mouse models of NF1 similarly exhibit metabolic phenotypes, including altered muscle growth and muscle lipid mobilization [ 30 ,  37 – 39 ]. In the fruit fly,  Drosophila  melanogaster, loss of Nf1 alters metabolism [ 12 ], increasing energy expenditure [ 11 ], reducing triglyceride [ 11 ] and glycogen [ 40 ] levels, increasing fat turnover [ 11 ], increasing ROS production and decreasing lifespan [ 41 ], shifting locomotor activity [ 42 – 45 ], and altering metabolism-sleep interactions [ 40 ,  46 ]. Some of these effects are mediated by Nf1 in neurons [ 11 ,  40 ,  42 – 46 ], suggesting that central control of metabolism is affected. Though patient and animal model studies show metabolic dysfunction caused by the loss of Nf1 function, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Furthermore, it is unknown whether the molecular mechanisms underlying metabolic alterations are similar to those driving cognitive and behavioral alterations. Since there are multiple phenotypes in NF1, and the neurofibromin protein is a Ras-GAP that exerts pleiotropic effects on multiple signaling pathways downstream of Ras, a major question is whether different downstream signaling pathways exhibit differential involvement in NF1 phenotypes. For instance, are the NF1 cognitive/behavioral symptoms more dependent on one pathway (e.g., MEK) while the metabolic alterations more dependent on another (e.g., mTOR)? We tested this using the genetically tractable  Drosophila  NF1 model, which allows precise dissection of signaling pathway function  in vivo . Using this model, we compared the signaling requirements for two NF1 phenotypes in  Drosophila : behavioral alterations and metabolic dysregulation.",
  "results": "Results Neurofibromin exerts behavioral effects via MEK, with no requirement for Akt signaling To dissect the mechanisms by which Neurofibromin 1 affects organismal physiology, we first examined its effect on behavior in  Drosophila . Genomic  nf1  mutations or pan-neuronal Nf1 loss of function increases spontaneous grooming in an Nf1 Ras GAP-related domain-dependent manner [ 43 ]. To test the underlying cellular signaling mechanisms downstream of Ras, we implemented an  in vivo  genetic analysis approach. Nf1 was knocked down pan-neuronally with RNAi [ 11 ,  43 ,  44 ], either alone or in combination with knockdown of a second signaling molecule downstream of Ras ( Fig. 1B ). Flies were monitored in open field arenas for 5 minutes and grooming behavior was quantified ( Fig. 1A , C ). The phenotype is present in both males and females [ 45 ]. In the first set of experiments, we targeted the MAPK signaling cascade, knocking down Nf1 along with MEK ( Fig. 1B , C ). MEK is a known modifier of neurofibromatosis type 1 phenotypes and therapeutic target for treatment of plexiform neurofibromas [ 21 ,  22 ]. Knocking down Nf1 in neurons increased spontaneous grooming frequency ( Fig. 1C ), as expected [ 43 – 45 ]. Knockdown of MEK did not, on its own, affect behavior ( Fig. 1C ). However, when knocking down both MEK and Nf1, the MEK knockdown occluded the behavioral effect of knocking Nf1 down ( Fig. 1C ). This suggested that MEK was necessary for the Nf1 effect on the behavioral phenotype. To validate the double RNAi approach, we tested whether introducing a second RNAi alters Nf1 mRNA relative to the single Nf1 RNAi via quantitative PCR (qPCR). Nf1 mRNA levels were significantly reduced in both the single Nf1 knockdown and double Nf1+MEK knockdowns, and there was no significant difference in Nf1 mRNA expression between the single and double knockdowns ( Fig. 1E ). This demonstrated that there was no dilution of the Nf1 knockdown when expressing a second RNAi line using the same Gal4 driver. Next, we examined how knocking down Nf1 and/or MEK affected downstream ERK phosphorylation. Western blot analysis showed increased phosphorylated ERK (pERK) following Nf1 knock down in neurons without affecting total ERK ( Fig. 1F ). Knocking down Nf1 and MEK concurrently occluded the effect of Nf1 knockdown, normalizing pERK levels. This demonstrated that the double RNAi lines effectively modulated the targeted signaling pathways (MEK/ERK), providing further validation of the genetic approach. Nf1 modulates multiple signaling pathways downstream of Ras, including Raf/MEK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways ( Fig. 1B ). Therefore, we next tested whether PI3K/Akt signaling is involved in regulating the behavioral phenotype. There are multiple PI3K isoforms [ 47 ], complicating loss-of-function analysis. Therefore, we tested Akt, which exists as a single isoform in  Drosophila  [ 48 ]. In contrast to MEK, knocking down Akt did not occlude the Nf1 effect on behavior – there was no significant difference in grooming between the single Nf1 knockdown and double Nf1 + Akt knockdown ( Fig. 1D ). This suggested that reducing the expression of MEK, but not Akt restored a behavioral phenotype (excessive grooming caused by loss of Nf1 in neurons). Thus, Nf1 affected behavior via selective effects on MAPK signaling in this signaling context. Metabolic effects of neurofibromin are mediated by coordinated actions of MEK/ERK and Akt/mTOR/S6K/4E-BP The above data suggest Nf1 signals through MEK (but not Akt) to regulate behavior. Beyond behavioral regulation, Nf1 also regulates other phenotypes [ 11 ,  18 ,  20 ,  41 ,  46 ,  49 – 53 ]. Could these phenotypes exhibit differential dependence on Nf1-regulated signaling cascades? To begin exploring this, we examined Nf1-dependent metabolic regulation. Loss of Nf1 disrupts metabolic homeostasis, increasing CO 2  production (and O 2  consumption) [ 11 ,  12 ,  54 ], which correlates with organismal metabolic rate [ 55 ]. Like the behavioral phenotype [ 43 ], the Nf1-dependent metabolic phenotype is Ras dependent [ 11 ]. We utilized this phenotype to probe the cellular signaling mechanisms of Nf1 effects on metabolism ( Fig. 2A ). Prior metabolic studies focused on male flies, so we initially compared CO 2  production between  nf1  mutants and wCS10 controls in both sexes. In both males and females, there was a significant increase in CO P1 2  production in  nf1  mutants relative to controls ( P1 Fig. 2B ). The Nf1 metabolic effect maps to a set of neurons labeled with the PCB-Gal4 driver [ 11 ]. When knocking Nf1 down in these neurons, CO 2  production was increased ( Fig. 2C ). We knocked Nf1 down in these metabolism-regulating neurons to examine the dependence of the metabolic phenotype on signaling cascades downstream of Ras, using a similar double knockdown approach as above ( Fig. 2D ). First, we examined MAPK signaling, beginning with MEK. Knocking down MEK alone did not affect metabolic rate (CO 2  production), but combining it with Nf1 knockdown occluded the effect of the Nf1 knockdown on metabolic rate ( Fig. 2E ). Moving one step downstream in the MAPK pathway, we observed a similar effect with ERK. Knocking down ERK alone did not affect metabolic rate, yet it occluded the Nf1 effect on metabolic rate when both were knocked down simultaneously ( Fig. 2F ). This suggested that MEK/ERK signaling is required for Nf1-dependent metabolic modulation. The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a well-studied nutrient sensor and metabolic regulator [ 56 ]. It is downstream of Nf1 and activated by Ras-PI3K-Akt ( Fig. 3A ). Alterations in Akt and mTOR modulate growth and cancer phenotypes in NF1 [ 57 – 60 ]. To test the role of mTOR, and its activators/effectors in Nf1-dependent metabolic regulation, we carried out double knockdown experiments as above. There are multiple PI3K genes (in  Drosophila , Pi3K92E, Pi3K59F, Pi3K68D, and Pi3K21B) and some PI3K isoforms can functionally compensate for one another [ 47 ]. Therefore, we targeted the loss-of-function manipulation one step downstream, to Akt, which exists as a single isoform in  Drosophila  [ 48 ]. Knocking down Akt on its own did not affect metabolic rate ( Fig. 3B ). However, when Akt and Nf1 knockdown were combined, the Akt knockdown occluded the metabolic effect of Nf1 knockdown ( Fig. 3B ). Thus, in contrast to the behavioral phenotype, the Nf1 metabolic phenotype was dependent on Akt. Given this positive result with Akt, we moved further down the mTOR signaling pathway, testing Raptor, an mTOR complex 1 obligate subunit. Knocking down Raptor did not affect metabolism on its own, but, similar to Akt, occluded the Nf1 effect on metabolism ( Fig. 3C ). mTOR is a protein kinase that plays key roles in cell growth and metabolism, in part via regulating protein synthesis [ 61 ]. Activation of mTOR is positively coupled to protein synthesis via activation of S6K and inhibition of the translational repressor 4E-BP [ 56 ,  62 ]. Therefore, we tested whether targeting one or both of these downstream effectors could modulate the Nf1 metabolic effect. Knocking down both S6K ( Fig. 3D ) and 4E-BP ( Fig. 3E ) occluded the Nf1 metabolic effect. This demonstrated that targeting mTOR complex 1 effectors ameliorated the Nf1 metabolic phenotype. These findings reveal several key conclusions. First, Nf1 affects metabolism through coordinated actions of MAPK and mTOR signaling. Second, the Nf1 metabolic effect is susceptible to modulation of either pathway. This starkly contrasts with the behavioral phenotype, which is normalized by genetic manipulation of MEK but not Akt. Third, the metabolic effect can be rescued by downregulating any one of multiple nodes within the mTOR signaling pathway, including multiple molecules along the vertical axis of the pathway (including Akt, Raptor, and their downstream targets), as well as at least two independent parallel nodes within the pathway (S6K and 4E-BP). Thus, the metabolic phenotype is highly sensitive to any one of multiple perturbations that push signaling back toward normal levels. Neurofibromin mediates metabolic effects via Ras signaling independent of cAMP Loss of Nf1 decreases cAMP and PKA levels in flies (and other model systems) ( Fig. 4A ) [ 15 ,  17 ,  20 ,  51 ,  63 – 65 ]. Therefore, we tested whether reduced cAMP levels contribute to the metabolic phenotype. As a first pass, we knocked down the type-1 adenylyl cyclase Rutabaga [ 66 ] with RNAi expressed in PCB+ neurons. This did not significantly alter metabolic rate relative to the heterozygous Gal4/+ or UAS/+ controls ( Fig. 4B ). This suggested that dysregulation of cAMP signaling in metabolism-controlling neurons did not mimic the Nf1 metabolic phenotype. In a complementary approach, we moved one step downstream in the signaling pathway, knocking down the PKA catalytic subunit 1 (PKA-C1). Knocking down PKA-C1 did not mimic the Nf1 metabolic effect ( Fig. 4C ), further suggesting that reducing cAMP/PKA signaling does not produce the metabolic effect observed in Nf1 loss-of-function conditions. A previous study reported that expression of Nf1 with a patient-derived mutation in the Ras GAP-related domain of Nf1 failed to rescue the Nf1 metabolic effects [ 11 ], initially implicating Ras signaling as the potential mechanism. The data above show that knocking down MAPK or mTOR pathways downstream of Ras can rescue the Nf1 effects on metabolism ( Figs. 2 ,  3 ), and that reducing cAMP/PKA levels does not phenocopy the Nf1 effect ( Fig. 4 ). Thus, Nf1 affects metabolism via a neuronal mechanism that depends on Ras and downstream pathways that are likely independent of cAMP/PKA. Modulation of mTOR/S6K rescues Nf1 behavioral effects independent of Akt The above data revealed that behavioral effects of Nf1 knockdown were occluded by secondary loss of MEK but not Akt. In contrast, metabolic effects were occluded by both MAPK and mTOR pathway manipulations. There is significant crosstalk between signaling pathways, including ERK and mTOR [ 67 ] ( Fig. 5A ). Moreover, mTOR is a central metabolic regulator that is activated by multiple signaling pathways such as AMPK [ 56 ,  62 ]. We therefore asked whether the behavioral effects of loss of Nf1 could be rescued by modulating signaling at/below the level of mTOR, where multiple signaling pathways converge ( Fig. 5A ). To address this, we first tested whether knockdown of Raptor occluded the Nf1 effect on grooming. Raptor knockdown alone did not affect behavior but double knockdown with Nf1 occluded the effect ( Fig. 5B ). Next, we moved one step downstream in the pathway, testing whether S6K occluded the Nf1 effect on grooming. Double knockdown of Nf1 and S6K also occluded the effect of Nf1 knockdown alone ( Fig. 5C ). Thus, knocking down either Raptor or S6K rescued behavior in an Nf1 deficient background. Since MEK, but not Akt, was necessary for behavioral rescue, this suggests that either crosstalk between the pathways ( Fig. 5A ) could be responsible or additional inputs to mTOR (e.g., AMPK) could modulate behavioral responses independent of Akt. Loss of Nf1 modulates metabolic rate via interneurons, with additional contributions from muscle After establishing the downstream signaling of Nf1 for behavioral and metabolic regulation, we turned to the question of where Nf1 acts to produce effects, particularly in terms of metabolic effects. Loss of Nf1 in neurons increases CO 2  production, and the PCB-Gal4 driver is the most restricted driver that produces a phenotype when used to knock Nf1 down [ 11 ]. Yet the driver expresses in more tissues than just neurons (the driver exhibits robust fat body expression [ 68 ], though this does not drive the phenotype [ 11 ]); whether additional tissues contribute to the Nf1-dependent change in metabolic rate has not been ruled out. To explore the potential roles of various tissues on Nf1-dependent metabolic modulation, we knocked Nf1 down in a variety of metabolically relevant tissues with RNAi. Knockdown of Nf1 in neurons with the PCB-Gal4 driver increased metabolic rate ( Fig. 2C ), and this is the narrowest driver identified to date [ 11 ]. The driver contains several distinct subsets of neurons, as well as additional tissues in adult animals ( Fig. 6 ). To identify which cells are responsible for the metabolic effect, we first parsed the neuronal subsets labeled by the driver, labeling cells with mCD8::GFP ( Fig. 6A – C ). These include sensory neurons from the halteres and wings ( Fig. 6B ), interneurons in the central brain and ventral nervous cord (VNC) ( Fig. 6A ), and insulin-producing cells [ 11 ]. A prior study found that loss of Nf1 in insulin-producing cells does not affect metabolism [ 11 ], leaving sensory neurons and interneurons as remaining candidates. To test the role of sensory neurons, we knocked down Nf1 in neurons innervating the campaniform sensillae (CS), a type of sensory neurons in the wings and halteres ( Fig. 6B ). The DB331-Gal4 driver labels haltere CS afferents [ 69 ] and knocking down Nf1 with this driver did not detectably alter metabolic rate ( Fig. 6E ). In a complementary experiment, we knocked Nf1 down in wing campaniform sensillae using R12C07-Gal4 [ 69 ]. Similar to DB331, we did not detect a difference in metabolic rate when knocking Nf1 down with R12C07 ( Fig. 6E ). This suggests that while the PCB-Gal4 driver drives expression in campaniform afferents, these neurons are not responsible for the alterations in metabolic rate. This leaves interneurons in the central nervous system as the likely cell-autonomous neuronal source of the neuronal Nf1 metabolic effect. Next, we examined PCB-Gal4 for any non-neuronal Nf1 metabolic contributions. In addition to the brain and ventral nervous system, the Gal4 driver strongly labels neurosecretory cells in the corpora cardiaca (CC) ( Fig. 6C ). A previous study reported that knocking Nf1 down with either of two CC drivers, Akh-Gal4 and Tk-Gal4 did not affect metabolic rate [ 11 ]. Nonetheless, given the strong expression of PCB-Gal4 in the CC, we further challenged the role of this driver in Nf1-dependent metabolic regulation here. Knocking down Nf1 with an additional CC-selective Gal4 driver, R64D11-Gal4, did not alter metabolism ( Fig. 6E ), confirming that Nf1 in the CC does not cell-autonomously regulate metabolism. Beyond the CC, additional cell types regulate metabolism, including the fat body and oenocytes ( Fig. 6C ). The fat body is a primary lipid storage site, with similar function to mammalian adipose tissue [ 70 ], yet Nf1 knockdown in the fat body does not affect metabolism [ 11 ,  68 ]. Oenocytes are hepatocyte-like neurosecretory cells in the fly abdomen that respond to nutrient state, synthesize very long-chain fatty acids, and regulate energy homeostasis [ 71 ] ( Fig. 6C ). Knocking Nf1 down with either of two oenocyte-expressing drivers, OK72 and desat, did not significantly affect metabolic rate ( Fig. 6E ). There was a slight decrease in the experimental group relative to controls, resulting in a main effect in the ANOVA. However, the experimental group did not significantly differ from both Gal4/+ and UAS/+ groups using either driver. Furthermore, the trend was in the downward direction and therefore could not account for the Nf1 effect on metabolism. Thus, we conclude that Nf1 does not impact metabolic rate via functions in the CC, fat body, or oenocytes. The above data implicate neurons in the PCB-Gal4 driver. This driver labels a set of neurons in the central brain and VNC [ 11 ]; the metabolic phenotype is suppressed by the ventral nervous system-biased tsh-Gal80 repressor [ 11 ], suggesting that the VNC is a likely locus of Nf1 metabolic effects. To gain insight into the neurons that could be responsible for the phenotype, we labeled nuclei of PCB-Gal4+ cells with nuclear-localized GFP (GFP.nls) and counted the labeled cells in the VNC ( Fig. 6D ). There were 981 labeled cell bodies across the VNC, with 208 in the prothoracic neuromeres (ProNm), 148 in the accessory metathoracic neuromeres (AMNp), 213 in the mesothoracic neuromeres (MesoNm), 257 in the metathoracic neuropil (MetaNm), and 155 in the abdominal neuromere (ANm) ( Fig. 6D ). We observed no evidence of glial-like labeling in mCD8::GFP labeled brain ( Fig. 6C ) or VNC ( Fig. 6A ), so these GFP.nls labeled cell bodies likely represent neuronal somata. The VNC contains approximately 23,000 neurons [ 72 ], so the 981 labeled neurons in the PCB-Gal4 driver represent approximately 4.3% of the total neurons that have cell bodies within the VNC. Overall, this suggests that PCB-Gal4+ non-neuronal cells (oenocytes and corpora cardiaca), neurons innervating the VNC (campaniform sensillae afferents in the haltere tract), as well as other candidates (insulin-producing cells, peptidergic cells, and fat body [ 11 ]) are not responsible for the Nf1 effect on metabolism. Thus, interneurons within the VNC are the likely major modulators of Nf1-dependent neuronal metabolic effects. Muscle tissue is an additional candidate for non-neuronal Nf1 effects on metabolism [ 30 ,  35 ,  73 ]. Muscle movement and maintenance are energetically costly – in insects, skeletal (flight) muscles consume the largest amount of energy in proportion to the animal’s weight [ 74 ,  75 ]. Additionally, Nf1 exerts effects on metabolic parameters in mammalian muscle tissue [ 30 ,  38 ,  73 ,  76 ]. To test whether loss of Nf1 in muscle contributes to the organismal metabolic phenotype, we knocked Nf1 down using four Gal4 drivers that include muscle expression: Mef2, c179, 24B, and R22H05. Metabolic rate was increased when Nf1 was knocked down with Mef2, c179, and R22H05, but not 24B. Among these drivers, 24B is expressed in muscle broadly through development, but its expression drops progressively after eclosion [ 77 ]. Therefore, the lack of effect when knocking Nf1 down with 24B suggests that Nf1 could impact metabolism via post-developmental effects in adult flies, though differences in the expression patterns between the drivers (across muscle or off-target outside muscle) could also be responsible. The effect size of the metabolic phenotype when knocking Nf1 in muscle ( Fig. 7I ) was smaller than when knocking down Nf1 with the PCB-Gal4 driver ( Fig. 2C ) or pan-neuronal knockdown [ 11 ]. This suggested that the muscle contributions are either secondary to neuronal contributions or due to off-target expression of Gal4 in neurons within the muscle-selective Gal4 drivers. To test whether the effect of Nf1 knockdown using these drivers was due solely to muscle or a combination of muscle and neurons, we used a muscle-selective MHC-Gal80 to repress Mef2-Gal4 expression in muscle. This manipulation only marginally suppressed the Mef2-Gal4 phenotype – metabolic rate in flies expressing Nf1RNAi under control of the MHC-Gal80;Mef2-Gal4 combination were not significantly different from either the Mef2-Gal4>Nf1RNAi or the heterozygous controls ( Fig. 7J ). Thus, the metabolic effect may be dominated by neuronal expression in the driver(s); for instance, Mef2-Gal4 contains robust expression in the brain (along with skeletal and visceral muscle) [ 78 ]. Overall, these data suggest that interneurons within the VNC are the major source of the Nf1 metabolic effect, with additional contribution from Nf1 in muscle. Nf1 deficiency did not detectably alter neuronal structure or mitochondria Alterations in metabolism could result from changes in mitochondrial structure and/or function. Loss of Nf1 impacts ROS production [ 41 ] and mitochondrial bioenergetics in an oncogenic context [ 31 ]. To test whether mitochondria were altered, we first labeled neuronal mitochondria pan-neuronally with a genetically-encoded, mitochondrial-targeted fluorescent protein, and analyzed mitochondria in the VNC ( Fig. 7A – D ). At the light microscopy level, we detected no significant differences in mitochondria number between controls and  nf1  mutants ( P1 Fig. 7B ). There were also no differences in mitochondrial volume ( Fig. 7C ) or sphericity ( Fig. 7D ) between  nf1  mutants and controls. Analysis of electron micrographs taken from the protocerebrum neuropil area were unremarkable, revealing no major qualitative differences between  P1 nf1  mutants and wCS10 controls with respect to overall neuropil morphology, synaptic T-bar and vesicle distribution and size, and membrane integrity ( P1 Fig. 7 E , F ). Quantification of mitochondrial area revealed a decrease in mitochondria size in protocerebral neurons ( Fig. 7 G , H ). While this difference was statistically significant, the magnitude was modest, and there was little shift in the distribution of mitochondria sizes ( Fig. 7G ). Thus, these data suggest that neither mitochondrial regulation (e.g., via fission/fusion) nor neuronal ultrastructure were detectably altered in  nf1  mutant neurons. Altered muscle mitochondrial morphology in  nf1  mutants As loss of Nf1 affected metabolism via effects in muscle (as well as neurons) ( Fig. 7I ), we asked whether muscle morphology and mitochondria were affected by Nf1 deficiency. To test this, we examined electron micrographs of  nf1  mutants and controls. Ultrastructural analysis of  P1 Drosophila  flight muscle revealed qualitative and quantitative changes in mitochondria. There was visibly abnormal spacing between adjacent mitochondria in  nf1  mutant muscle ( P1 Fig. 7 K , L ). Further, the mitochondria were larger in  nf1  mutants, exhibiting an increase in cross-sectional area relative to wCS10 controls, which was accompanied by a rightward shift in the distribution in the mutants ( P1 Fig. 7 M , N ). Thus, there were robust changes in muscle mitochondria ultrastructure. Overall, loss of Nf1 affected neurons and muscle differently at the ultrastructural level, with muscle exhibiting notable alterations in mitochondrial structure.",
  "discussion": "Discussion Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a monogenetic disorder that affects diverse and complex behavioral, cellular, and organismal phenotypes. While the disorder results from mutations in a single gene, its protein product regulates a variety of diverging downstream signaling pathways. This raises the question of whether multiple neurofibromatosis type 1 phenotypes exhibit similar or differing dependence on the signaling pathways downstream of Nf1 and Ras. To test this, we implemented  in vivo  genetic analysis of signaling pathways in  Drosophila  - a robust platform for dissecting the action of individual signaling molecules on organismal phenotypes. Two human disorder-relevant organismal phenotypes – behavior (grooming) and metabolic modulation – exhibited differing dependence on signaling pathways immediately downstream of Nf1/Ras. Nf1-dependent behavioral alteration was rescued by manipulation of MEK but not Akt. In contrast, the Nf1 metabolic phenotype was rescued by both MEK and Akt ( Fig. 8 ). The Nf1 metabolic phenotype exhibited striking reliance on multiple signaling molecules. These were spread across at least two parallel signaling pathways (MAPK and mTOR), included hits distributed vertically along the same pathways (MEK/ERK, Akt/Raptor), and included one pair of molecules situated in parallel within the same pathway (S6K/4E-BP). Despite the breadth of these hits across multiple pathways/loci, each molecule was individually necessary for the Nf1 effect on metabolism – knocking any of them down occluded the Nf1 effect on metabolism. This suggests that Nf1-dependent metabolic modulation results from coordinated actions of MAPK (Raf-MEK-ERK) and mTOR (PI3K-Akt-mTOR-S6K/4E-BP) signaling. Considering the pathways examined in the present study, the Nf1 metabolic phenotype appears to be dependent on a wider range of signaling molecules than the behavioral (grooming) phenotype. A major difference in pathway dependency between the behavioral and metabolic phenotypes was Akt - behavioral effects of Nf1 knockdown were normalized by knocking down MEK but not Akt ( Fig. 8 ). This suggests that Nf1 exerts behavioral effects via more selective effects on MAPK signaling at high levels of the signaling cascade (proximal to Ras). Within the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, there are multiple isoforms of signaling molecules at several levels of the pathway. For instance, in  Drosophila , there are multiple PI3K proteins/isoforms (PI3K92E/Dp110, PI3K68D/cpk, PI3K59F/Vps34, and Pi3K21B), like mammals. This complicates analysis with loss-of-function approaches, as different isoforms could compensate one another. Therefore, we focused our analysis on Akt and mTOR. In mammals, there are three isoforms of Akt (AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3), and knockout of each can produce differing effects [ 79 ]. In  Drosophila , there is only one Akt gene, facilitating unambiguous genetic dissection of the role of Akt in cellular signaling. Here we leveraged this to test the role of Akt in mediating Nf1 effects. Targeting deep levels of the mTOR signaling pathway (Raptor and S6K) normalized both Nf1 behavioral effects and metabolism. Thus, Akt was not required for the Nf1 behavioral effect, but mTOR and S6K were. This suggests that mTOR complex 1 and S6K contribute to the behavioral phenotype but are pathologically hyperactivated by Nf1 in an Akt-independent manner. Crosstalk between MAPK and mTOR signaling pathways is one way in which this could occur. Multiple points of crosstalk between these pathways have been reported, including ERK-mediated phosphorylation of Raptor and cross-activation via intermediates such as RSK and TSC1/2 ( Fig. 8 ) [ 67 ]. The existence of such crosstalk facilitates potential treatment of NF1 behavioral phenotypes in several ways. For instance, it could be possible to target a small set of upstream signaling molecules (e.g., MEK) or any one of a larger set of downstream signaling molecules representing their direct targets (e.g., ERK) or indirect targets (e.g., mTOR). Further preclinical studies will be needed to identify viable approaches. Nf1’s metabolic effects were Akt-dependent, which likely functioned through activation of downstream mTOR signaling. Akt activates the Raptor-containing mTOR complex 1 via a signaling pathway involving TSC1/2 and Rheb [ 61 ]. mTOR complex 1 is a conserved central metabolic regulator [ 80 ], exerting effects on cellular growth and metabolic processes [ 61 ]. The dependence of the Nf1 metabolic phenotype on both MAPK and Akt/mTOR signaling pathways is reminiscent of signaling in various cancers. For instance, both MEK and Akt are hyperactivated in optic gliomas, and inhibition of either pathway reduces several optic glioma phenotypes [ 59 ]. Similarly, inhibition of Akt and MEK synergistically suppresses NF1 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) growth [ 81 ]. The cellular mechanism remains to be fully elucidated, though it could involve metabolic alterations; Akt promotes mitochondrial fusion and elongation [ 82 ]. Whether this represents a similar mechanism to that driving alterations in organismal metabolic alterations is unclear – we detected no major changes in neuronal morphology, though there was evidence for changes in muscle mitochondria. Multiple signaling pathways have been implicated in neurofibromatosis type 1 phenotypes, including Ras/MAPK, Ras/PI3K/mTOR, and cAMP/PKA. The commonly-studied MAPK signaling pathway is implicated in multiple phenotypes, and MEK is the target for current FDA-approved treatments [ 21 ,  22 ]. Nf1 also regulates cAMP in a Ras-dependent manner via the activation of atypical protein kinase C (PKCζ) in neurons [ 83 ]. In the present study, we did not find evidence for cAMP effects on the Nf1 metabolic effect, as cAMP/PKA manipulations did not phenocopy the nf1 mutant phenotype. One caveat is that – given this lack of phenocopy – we did not attempt to normalize cAMP/PKA levels in the mutant background. mTOR is hyperactivated in neurofibromatosis type 1 and regulates some neurofibromatosis type 1 phenotypes, particularly tumors [ 84 ,  85 ]. Both Ras/ERK and cAMP/PKA signaling regulate aspects of cognition in animal models [ 63 ,  86 ,  87 ]. Ras signals through a variety of additional effectors, including RalGEF/RalA, TIAM1, PLC, RASSF1/5. Several of these pathways have been implicated in neurofibromatosis type 1 tumor phenotypes. RalGEF/RalA is a Ras effector pathway that is overactivated in NF1 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) [ 88 ,  89 ]. RASSF1 expression is altered in NF1 MPNST via DNA promoter methylation-induced silencing, and this is associated with poor prognosis [ 90 ]. Ras-TIAM1-Rac signaling is implicated in proliferation of plexiform neurofibromas, as genetic disruption of Rac prevents tumor formation [ 91 ]. Combination therapies targeting multiple pathways may be an effective strategy both for cancers [ 92 ,  93 ] and other phenotypes, such as the cognitive and behavioral symptoms. At the circuit/systemic level, Nf1 exerts a primary effect in neurons to modulate the Nf1 metabolic phenotype, with a secondary contribution from muscle tissue. The critical neurons are some set of the 981 VNC interneurons labeled by the PCB-Gal4 driver. In addition to the interneurons the PCB-Gal4 driver labels multiple other cell types, including campaniform sensillae in the halteres and wings, corpora cardiaca, and fat body. Tissue-specific RNAi experiments in the present and a prior study [ 11 ] revealed no effect of knocking Nf1 down in these cell types, suggesting that these tissues may not contribute. Oenocytes represent an additional potential site of systemic metabolic effects, which we tested here. Caveats to these experiments include the possibility of potential shifts in Gal4 expression patterns of the drivers over development/lifespan [ 94 ], developmental effects of Nf1 on neurons [ 43 ], “off-target” expression sites [ 95 ], or nonlinear expression levels across labeled cells. To minimize the potential for these confounds, we have tested multiple lines covering each of these cells/tissues. Thus, multiple lines of evidence support a role for neurons and muscle in mediating Nf1 effects on metabolism. In addition to the neuronal effects of Nf1, knocking down Nf1 with muscle-selective Gal4 drivers altered metabolism and increased CO 2  production. Suppressing muscle expression of the Mef2-Gal4 driver with MHC-Gal80 did not significantly affect the metabolic rate, reinforcing the interpretation that muscle is not the primary/only source of the Nf1 metabolic effect. Subcellular changes in nf1 mutants included differences in mitochondrial ultrastructure between  nf1  mutants and wild-type controls. In the nervous system, there were no major morphological differences in neurons between nf1 mutants and controls in terms of overall neuronal morphology or synaptic structure, though there was a small shift in the distribution of mitochondrial size. In muscle, there was a more pronounced shift in mitochondrial size, which was accompanied by a qualitative change in mitochondrial appearance (increased spacing). This change in mitochondrial appearance was subtle, yet readily detectable in  Drosophila  flight muscle since the mitochondria line up end-to-end. In comparison, mitochondria in mice with biallelic Nf1 inactivation in muscle appear normal, though there is significant muscle atrophy, metabolic dysregulation, and ultimately lethality [ 30 ]. The mitochondrial changes in  Drosophila  were reminiscent of swollen mitochondria reported in another study [ 96 ]. Loss of nf1 drives mitochondrial dysregulation [ 41 ], which could contribute to changes in mitochondrial regulation and morphology. Overall, this study revealed how loss of Nf1 modulates two organismal phenotypes through effects on two major Ras effector pathways: MAPK and mTOR. The results suggest that multiple pathway nodes could be targeted to approach NF1 phenotypes, particularly the metabolic alterations. Yet some of the phenotypes exhibit differential dependence on certain signaling nodes, a feature that could be exploited to target different NF1 phenotypes independently. While MAPK and mTOR are two of the major, well-studied Ras effectors, Ras signals through a wide range of effectors. Future studies will be required to address these signaling pathways more broadly. The diversity and complexity of Ras signaling represents both a challenge and an opportunity for identifying new therapeutic targets for NF1 and other Rasopathies.",
