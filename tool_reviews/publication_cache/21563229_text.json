  "abstract": "This study examined the effects of 22 putative splicing mutations in the NF2 gene by means of transcript analysis and information theory based prediction. Fourteen mutations were within the dinucleotide acceptor and donor regions, often referred to as (AG/GT) sequences. Six were outside these dinucleotide regions but within the more broadly defined splicing regions used in the information theory based model. Two others were in introns and outside the broadly defined regions. Transcript analysis revealed exon skipping or activation of one or more cryptic splicing sites for 17 mutations. No alterations were found for the two intronic mutations and for three mutations in the broadly defined splicing regions. Concordance and partial concordance between the calculated predictions and the results of transcript analysis were found for 14 and 6 mutations, respectively. For two mutations, the predicted alteration was not found in the transcripts. Our results demonstrate that the effects of splicing mutations in NF2 are often complex and that information theory based analysis is helpful in elucidating the consequences of these mutations.",
