  "abstract": "Conditional biallelic Nf2 mutation in the mouse promotes manifestations of human  neurofibromatosis type 2.  Giovannini M(1), Robanus-Maandag E, van der Valk M, Niwa-Kawakita M, Abramowski  V, Goutebroze L, Woodruff JM, Berns A, Thomas G.  Author information: (1)INSERM U434, Fondation Jean Dausset, CEPH, Paris, France.  Hemizygosity for the NF2 gene in humans causes a syndromic susceptibility to  schwannoma development. However, Nf2 hemizygous mice do not develop schwannomas  but mainly osteosarcomas. In the tumors of both species, the second Nf2 allele  is inactivated. We report that conditional homozygous Nf2 knockout mice with  Cre-mediated excision of Nf2 exon 2 in Schwann cells showed characteristics of  neurofibromatosis type 2. These included schwannomas, Schwann cell hyperplasia,  cataract, and osseous metaplasia. Thus, the tumor suppressor function of Nf2,  here revealed in murine Schwann cells, was concealed in hemizygous Nf2 mice  because of insufficient rate of second allele inactivation in this cell  compartment. The finding of this conserved function documents the relevance of  the present approach to model the human disease.  PMCID: PMC316733 PMID: 10887156 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",
