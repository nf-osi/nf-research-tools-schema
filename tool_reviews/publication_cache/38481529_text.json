Approval was received from the local committee of the Ile de France (Declaration DC-2010-1101/CPP dossier n\u00b0 Am6136-2-COL2828), and written informed consent was received from patients.  NF1 -1 and  NF1 -2 hiPSC lines carry the nonsense heterozygous mutation c.1721 + 3A>G located at intron 15 in the  NF1  gene and c.2412del at exon 21, respectively, leading to the formation of a premature stop codon resulting in the expression of a truncated neurofibromin. Two control  NF1  (+/+) hiPSC lines ( WT -1 and  WT -2) purchased from Phenocell were also generated from control donors. The parental (+/+) control hiPSC line used for Crispr/Cas9 engineering corresponds to the  WT -1 line. HiPSCs were maintained and expanded with the StemMACS\u2122 iPS-Brew XF medium (Miltenyi Biotec) on Matrigel \u00ae  hESC-qualified Matrix (Corning)-coated culture dishes. Cultures were changed every 2\u00a0days and passaged every 5\u20137 days with StemPro Accutase Cell Dissociation Reagent (Gibco). 2.2 Mesenchymal stem cell differentiation HiPSCs were differentiated into mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) using protocols for differentiation published by  Denis et al. (2011) . Briefly, 1.10 4  to 4.10 4  hiPSCs/cm 2  were seeded on 0.1% gelatin (Sigma)-coated dishes with knockout\u2122 DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 1% non-essential amino acids (Gibco), 1% Glutamax\u2122 (Gibco), 0.1% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (Gibco), 1\u00a0mM ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (Sigma), and 10\u00a0ng/mL FGF2 (Tocris). The medium was changed every 2\u20133 days. MSCs were passaged with Trypsin-EDTA 1\u00d7 (Gibco) each time they reached 80% confluence until they showed a characteristic fibroblastic spindle shape. 2.3 Adipocytic differentiation MSCs were seeded at 20,000 cells/cm 2  on 0.1% gelatin (Sigma)-coated dishes and cultured in the MSC medium previously described. At 80% of confluence, the medium was switched to StemMACS\u2122 AdipoDiff Media, human (Miltenyi Biotec) for 10 days with medium changes every 2\u20133 days. 2.4 Osteogenic differentiation MSC seeded at 10,000 cells/cm 2  on Collagen I (100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, Gibco)-coated plates were cultured in MSC medium, as previously described. At confluence, the medium was switched to osteogenic differentiation medium containing modified Eagle medium alpha (Gibco), 16.5% FBS, 100\u00a0nM dexamethasone (Sigma), 200\u00a0\u00b5M ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (Sigma), and 10\u00a0mM  \u03b2 -glycerophosphate (Sigma) for 14\u201320 days with medium changes every 2\u20133 days. 2.5  NF1  (+/\u2212) and  NF1  (\u2212/\u2212)-knockout isogenic hiPSC line generation by CRISPR/Cas9 Single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were designed using CRISPOR software ( http://crispor.tefor.net ) and synthesized by IDT\u2122 (Integrated DNA Technologies). sgRNA1 (5\u2032-TAACTGCGCAACCTTCTTTA-3\u2032) and sgRNA2 (5\u2032-GTTAGCAGTTATAAATAGCC-3\u2032) target the exon 6 of  NF1  gene. Target-specific crispr RNA (crRNA) and trans-activating crispr RNA (tracrRNA) were synthesized by IDT. We electroporated 2.10 5  control  NF1  (+/+) hiPSCs with 120\u00a0pmol of each sgRNA (obtained by duplexing crRNA and tracrRNA) and 100\u00a0pmol of  Streptococcus pyogenes  Cas9 protein (gift from Jean-Paul Concordet, MNHN/CNRS UMR 7196/INSERM U1154) using the P3 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector \u00ae  X Kit (Lonza) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Transfected hiPSCs were then seeded in StemMACS\u2122 iPS-Brew XF medium supplemented with Clone R \u00ae  (STEMCELL Technologies) in 24-well plates coated with Matrigel \u00ae  hESC qualified Matrix (Corning). After 48\u00a0h from transfection, the hiPSCs were harvested for high-resolution melting analysis and seeded back to obtain isolated clones using limiting dilution cloning in a 96-well plate. After 10\u201314 days of expansion, clones were analyzed for editing. 2.6 Identification of edited clones The genomic DNA of single colonies was extracted using QuickExtract DNA extraction solution (Lucigen) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Targeted locus was amplified by PCR using MeltDoctor\u2122 HRM Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and primers (5\u2032-TGC\u200bTCT\u200bGAG\u200bTTG\u200bTAT\u200bTTG\u200bTGT\u200bTAA\u200bC-3\u2032, 5\u2032-GAG\u200bAGG\u200bTTG\u200bTAA\u200bCTT\u200bACC\u200bTTT\u200bTCC\u200bA-3\u2032) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. PCR reactions were analyzed using a QuantStudio 12K Flex Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The protocol was 95\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min, then 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15\u00a0s and 60\u00b0C for 1\u00a0min, followed by 95\u00b0C for 10\u00a0s and 60\u00b0C for 1\u00a0min; then, the temperature was increased by 0.025\u00b0C/s until 95\u00b0C 15\u00a0s, followed by cooling to 60\u00b0C. Curves were analyzed using QuantStudio\u2122 12K Flex software. Clones showing editing were selected, and corresponding PCR products were sequenced by Sanger sequencing (Eurofins). To ensure the purity of each edited clone, corresponding PCR products were subcloned using a TOPO\u2122 TA Cloning\u2122 Kit for Sequencing, with One Shot\u2122 TOP10 Chemically Competent  E. coli  (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. At least 30\u00a0TA clones for each CRISPR cell line were analyzed by Sanger sequencing (Eurofins). 2.7 Surface antigen flow cytometry analysis Expression of cell surface antigens on hiPSCs or mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) was analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells were dissociated into single-cell suspension with Accutase (Invitrogen) and Tryple Express enzyme (Gibco) for hiPSCs and MSCs, respectively. Cells were incubated in PBS containing 2% fetal bovine serum with fluorescent dye-conjugated antibodies (listed in  Supplementary Table S1 ) for 30\u00a0min on ice. Staining with the isotypic antibody was performed as a control. Analysis was performed on a MACSQuant \u00ae  system (Miltenyi Biotec). Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (FlowJo LLC). 2.8 Protein extraction and Western blot analysis Total proteins were extracted in RIPA lysis buffer (Sigma) containing 1% protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) and 10% phosphatase inhibitor (Roche). Proteins were quantified using the Pierce BCA Protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and loaded using NuPAGE\u2122 3%\u20138% and Tris - acetate (Invitrogen). Total proteins were then transferred to PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad) with a Trans-Blot Turbo Transfert system (Bio-Rad), blocked with Odyssey blocking buffer (OBB) containing 0.1% Tween-20, and incubated overnight with the primary anti-neurofibromin antibody (abcam, ab17963, 1/1000) diluted in the OBB containing 0.1% Tween-20. The membrane was then incubated for 1\u00a0h with the corresponding IRDye secondary antibodies (LI-COR). Immunoreactive protein bands were revealed using an Odyssey CLx Imager (LI-COR) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Anti-beta-Actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, sc4778, 1/10,000) or anti-vinculin (abcam, ab129002, 1/1000) was used to verify equal protein loading. 2.9 BODIPY staining Adipocytic differentiation was monitored after staining lipid droplets. Briefly, cells were permeabilized with FCM permeabilization buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), stained with BODIPY\u2122 493/503 (Invitrogen, 1/100 in PBS) and Hoechst (Invitrogen, 1/3000 in PBS) for 20\u00a0min, and rinsed. 2.10 Alkaline phosphatase staining and quantification Osteogenic differentiation was tested on day 14 for staining of alkaline phosphatase activity. Cells were washed, fixed with ethanol 95%, and stained with the SIGMA FAST \u2122 BCIP/NBT kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The quantification of ALP activity was performed using 1-Step\u2122 PNPP Substrate Solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The results were normalized with the total viable cell number monitored with the CellTiter-Glo assay \u00ae  (Promega) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. 2.11 Alizarin red staining Calcium deposition was detected with alizarin red staining solution (Merck Millipore) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, after 20 days of culture, cells were washed, fixed with ethanol 70%, incubated for 20\u00a0min with alizarin red solution, and rinsed before microscopy observation. 2.12 RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR Total RNAs were extracted using the RNeasy Micro/Mini Kit (Qiagen) and were reverse transcribed (RT) using the Superscript\u2122 III reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen) with a mix of random hexamers and oligo dT according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was carried out with the primers listed in  Supplementary Table S2  and Luminaris Color HiGreen qPCR Master Mix, low ROX (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a QuantStudio 12K Flex Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The amplification was performed using 95\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min, followed by 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15\u00a0s and 60\u00b0C for 1\u00a0min. The relative gene expression level was calculated with the 2-delta delta Ct method and normalized to 18S expression. 2.13 Statistical analysis All data were processed using GraphPad Prism 9 \u00ae . Data were analyzed using the non-parametric Mann\u2013Whitney test for side-by-side comparison.  p- values \u22640.05 were considered significant.",
