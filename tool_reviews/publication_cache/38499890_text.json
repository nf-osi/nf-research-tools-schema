  "title": "The PlexiQoL, a patient-reported outcome measure on quality of life in neurofibromatosis type 1-associated plexiform neurofibroma: translation, cultural adaptation and validation into the Dutch language for the Netherlands.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Half of the patients with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) develop one or more tumours called plexiform neurofibromas, which can have a significant impact on Quality of Life (QoL). The PlexiQoL questionnaire is a disease-specific QoL measure for adults with NF1-associated plexiform neurofibromas. The aim of this study was to adapt and validate a Dutch version of the PlexiQoL for the Netherlands. METHODS: The PlexiQoL was translated using the dual-panel methodology, followed by cognitive debriefing interviews to assess face and content validity. The psychometric properties were evaluated by administering the questionnaire on two separate occasions to a sample of adults with NF1 and plexiform neurofibromas. Feasibility was evaluated by the presence of floor/ceiling effects. Reliability was assessed by evaluating Cronbach's alpha coefficient and test-retest reliability, using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to check for known group validity. The Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) questionnaire was used as comparator questionnaire to evaluate convergent validity. RESULTS: The translation and cognitive debriefing interviews resulted in a Dutch version of the PlexiQoL that reflected the original concept and underlying semantic meanings of the UK English version. Forty participants completed the validation survey. The Dutch PlexiQoL demonstrated excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's \u03b1 0.825) and test-retest reliability (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.928). The questionnaire detected differences in PlexiQoL scores between participants based on self-reported general health and disease severity. Convergent validity was confirmed for relevant NHP subsections. CONCLUSIONS: The Dutch PlexiQoL demonstrated excellent psychometric properties and can be reliably used to measure plexiform neurofibroma-related QoL in adults with NF1 in the Netherlands.",

The psychometric properties were evaluated by administering the questionnaire on two separate occasions to a sample of adults with NF1 and plexiform neurofibromas. Feasibility was evaluated by the presence of floor/ceiling effects. Reliability was assessed by evaluating Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient and test-retest reliability, using Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficients. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to check for known group validity. The Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) questionnaire was used as comparator questionnaire to evaluate convergent validity. Methods The PlexiQoL The PlexiQoL consists of 18 items with a dichotomous response option (True / Not True). The number of times that a participant chooses \u2018True\u2019 is summed to produce a score ranging from 0 to 18, with a higher score indicating poorer QoL. The development and validation of the original PlexiQoL was conducted in the UK and US simultaneously [ 18 ]. It demonstrated excellent internal consistency (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 0.90) and reproducibility (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.90), and it could distinguish between groups of patients based on general health perceptions and perceived plexiform neurofibroma severity (known groups validity) in the developmental sample. The validation of the Dutch PlexiQoL for the Netherlands consisted of three stages: translation, assessment of face and content validity, and further psychometric evaluation (feasibility, reliability, convergent validity, and known groups validity). Translation The dual panel translation methodology as recommended by Hunt et al. was employed to translate the UK English version of the PlexiQoL into Dutch [ 20 ]. This methodology emphasises the importance of achieving conceptual equivalence in the translated items to the original. This method of translation does not involve back-translation. Rather, for non-English speaking countries, two stages are conducted; a linguistic stage (to provide the initial translation into the target language) and a lay stage (where items are assessed for comprehension and \u2018naturalness\u2019 of language). This methodology has been used in all needs-based PRO adaptations [ 21 \u2013 23 ]. The method was adapted slightly due to the COVID-19 pandemic: a video conference call system was used instead of performing in-person meetings. The linguistic meeting included an expert linguist who was fluent in English and Dutch, with Dutch as their native language as well as a researcher from the UK PlexiQoL development team. The role of this individual was to guide the process, and to explain the precise conceptual meaning of the items to the linguist. The purpose of this stage was to suggest translations for the instructions, items, and response categories, while ensuring that the Dutch translations captured the underlying semantic meaning behind each item. If consensus could not be reached, proposals for alternative translations of the item were sent to the lay people for consideration. The translated version was then presented to lay people by individual interviews. The lay interviews were held with two male and three female monolingual Dutch-speaking individuals from the Netherlands, aged between 22 and 65 years, who did not have NF1, and who had low to average educational backgrounds. This criteria was to ensure that the final wording was at an appropriate level for typical patients. The lay people were recruited via a market research company in the Netherlands. During the interviews, the items of the questionnaire were assessed for comprehension and the \u2018naturalness\u2019 of the language used. In particular, participants were asked whether the phrasing of the items was acceptable or whether these should be changed to make the items more natural or simpler in Dutch, whilst maintaining the original meaning. In addition, the lay people were presented with three different translations of the response options \u2018True/Not true\u2019 to see which one was preferred, because in Dutch there are multiple ways of saying this in response to the respective question (\u2018does this statement apply to you\u2019). Face and content validity The purpose of the Cognitive Debriefing Interviews (CDIs) was to test the applicability, relevance and comprehensiveness of the instrument as seen by relevant patients. Ten CDIs were conducted with adults that had NF1-associated plexiform neurofibroma. It is recommended to perform five to eight interviews [ 24 ], however, in order to keep it consistent with other needs-based measures and allowing for adequate variation in age, gender and disease severity in patients, ten were conducted. The verbal probing technique was utilised [ 25 ]. Patients were asked to participate in the CDIs when they visited the Neurology outpatient clinic of the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Participants had to meet the revised diagnostic criteria for NF1 [ 26 ] and have at least one plexiform neurofibroma. All invited participants agreed to participate (response rate 100%). In the one-to-one, semi-structured interviews, participants were asked to complete the questionnaire in the presence of a trained interviewer using a video call system. As such, the interviewer could observe difficulties or hesitation when completing specific items. After completing the questionnaire, scripted verbal probes were used to ask the participants whether they considered the items relevant, applicable, and comprehensible and if they believed that any important aspects of their experience with NF1-associated plexiform neurofibroma had been omitted. This was combined with additional unscripted probes for items where the interviewees showed difficulties or hesitation when completing the questionnaire. Further psychometric evaluation The psychometric properties of the Dutch PlexiQoL were evaluated through a postal survey. Adults who met the revised diagnostic criteria for NF1 [ 26 ] and who had one or more plexiform neurofibroma were recruited when they visited the Neurology outpatient clinic of the Erasmus Medical Centre from July 2022 through April 2023. This was a new sample of participants who had not taken part in the previous CDIs. The PlexiQoL was administered to the participants on two occasions, with 14 days between the two administrations. At the first administration, the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) was included as a comparator questionnaire [ 27 ]. The NHP is a generic health profile questionnaire that provides an indication of a patient\u2019s perceived emotional, social and physical health problems. It consists of 38 items that cover six subsections: physical mobility, pain, energy level, emotional reactions, sleep and social isolation. For each section, scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater perceived distress. In addition, a form was included to collect basic demographic information, including sex, age, the self-perceived general health and severity of the plexiform neurofibroma (both rated on a 4-point Likert scale), current treatment for the plexiform neurofibroma, and other health problems. The second administration consisted of the PlexiQoL and a shortened version of the demographic form, inquiring about the perceived general health, plexiform neurofibroma severity, and other health problems. Additional clinical information was extracted from the electronic health records of the participants. Extracted items consisted of the location of the plexiform neurofibroma, the presence of certain plexiform neurofibroma-related complications (pain which required drug intervention, neurological deficits, and disfigurement), other NF1-related disease manifestations (osseous lesions, optic pathway glioma (OPG), other brain glioma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour), mutation type (familial/de novo), and the presentation of NF1 (generalised/segmental). Statistical analysis The statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 28.0. Non-parametric tests were used given the ordinal nature and non-normal distribution of the data. PlexiQoL and NHP scores were computed according to their respective scoring instructions. For the descriptive analyses the mean, standard deviation (SD) and range were calculated for continuous variables, and count and frequency for categorical variables. Mann-Whitney U or Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to see if there were differences in PlexiQoL scores between participants grouped by demographic factors. The feasibility of the PlexiQoL was assessed by determining the response rate, percentage of missing answers, and the presence of floor and/or ceiling effects. Floor and ceiling effects were considered significant if\u2009\u2265\u200915% of the participants scored the lowest or highest absolute value on the questionnaire [ 28 ]. For all analyses, significance was based on a two-sided p-value of <\u20090.05. Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 was calculated to evaluate the internal consistency, which measures the extent to which the items of the questionnaire are interrelated. A Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 of \u2265\u20090.70 is considered adequate [ 29 ]. The test-retest reliability of the Dutch PlexiQoL was assessed by calculating the Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficients between the PlexiQoL scores of the first and second administration for each participant. A value of \u2265\u20090.75 indicates that the questionnaire has adequate test-retest reliability, showing low levels of random measurement error [ 30 ]. Convergent validity was assessed by the Spearman rank correlation coefficients between the scores of the PlexiQoL and the scales of the comparator measure (NHP) that measure the same or related constructs in QoL. It was hypothesized that the PlexiQoL score would correlate significantly with all sections of the NHP, with exception of the \u2018Pain\u2019 and \u2018Sleep\u2019 section, based on the items contained in the PlexiQoL. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to investigate whether the PlexiQoL would be able to discriminate between groups of participants based on self-reported health perceptions, plexiform neurofibroma severity, treatment for plexiform neurofibroma yes/no, the presence of other health problems, and the presentation of NF1 (general vs. segmental) (known groups validity). Effect sizes were assessed using Cohen\u2019s  d ; 0.20\u2009\u2264\u2009 d \u2009<\u20090.50 were considered small, 0.50\u2009\u2264\u2009 d \u2009<\u20090.80 as medium, and  d \u2009\u2265\u20090.80 were considered large [ 31 ].",
