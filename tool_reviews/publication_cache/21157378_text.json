  "title": "Neurofibromatosis-1 heterozygosity increases microglia in a spatially and temporally restricted pattern relevant to mouse optic glioma formation and growth.",
  "abstract": "Whereas carcinogenesis requires the acquisition of driver mutations in progenitor cells, tumor growth and progression are heavily influenced by the local microenvironment. Previous studies from our laboratory have used Neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) genetically engineered mice to characterize the role of stromal cells and signals to optic glioma formation and growth. Previously, we have shown that Nf1+/- microglia in the tumor microenvironment are critical cellular determinants of optic glioma proliferation. To define the role of microglia in tumor formation and maintenance further, we used CD11b-TK mice, in which resident brain microglia (CD11b+, CD68+, Iba1+, CD45low cells) can be ablated at specific times after ganciclovir administration. Ganciclovir-mediated microglia reduction reduced Nf1 optic glioma proliferation during both tumor maintenance and tumor development. We identified the developmental window during which microglia are increased in the Nf1+/- optic nerve and demonstrated that this accumulation reflected delayed microglia dispersion. The increase in microglia in the Nf1+/- optic nerve was associated with reduced expression of the chemokine receptor, CX3CR1, such that reduced Cx3cr1 expression in Cx3cr1-GFP heterozygous knockout mice led to a similar increase in optic nerve microglia. These results establish a critical role for microglia in the development and maintenance of Nf1 optic glioma.",

  "methods": "Materials and Methods Mouse and human specimens Mice were used in accordance to established Animal Studies Protocols at the Washington University School of Medicine.   ( Nf1 flox/- ; GFAP-Cre ),  Nf1 +/-GFAP CKO  ( Nf1 flox/- ; GFAP-Cre; CD11b-TK ), CD11b-TK ( Nf1 +/-GFAP CKO-TK 22 ),   ( Cx3cr1+/GFP 23 ),  , wild type (WT) and  Nf1 +/- ;Cx3cr1+/GFP  mice were all maintained on a C57BL/6 background. The  Nf1 +/-  optic gliomas lack the Rosenthal fibers and eosinophilic granular bodies that are characteristic of human pilocytic astrocytomas, but otherwise closely resemble pediatric low-grade gliomas, based on the presence of discrete optic nerve/chiasm masses composed of hyperproliferating astrocytes with large hyperchromatic nuclei, low proliferative indices, new blood vessel formation, microglia infiltration, Olig2-immunoreactive cells, and contrast enhancement on small-animal MRI ( Nf1 +/-GFAP CKO 8 ); there is no evidence of endothelial hyperplasia or necrosis. Human tumor specimens were used in accordance with established guidelines under an active and approved Human Studies Protocol. Human glioma specimens were studied using 2 individual tissue microarrays developed at the Mayo Clinic Foundation and Washington University School of Medicine, as previously reported ( 24 ,  25 ). Non-neoplastic human brain samples from the neocortex were obtained from autopsy materials acquired under an approved Human Studies Protocol at the Washington University School of Medicine. Immunohistochemistry Mice were perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Optic nerves and optic chiasms were dissected and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4\u00b0C. All specimens were then processed for paraffin embedding and sectioning in the Ophthalmology Histology Core or the Histology and Microscopy Core at Washington University School of Medicine. Slides were deparaffinized in xylene and subjected to antigen retrieval. After the washing and blocking steps, sections were incubated overnight with rabbit anti-Iba1 (1:3000; Wako, Richmond, VA), mouse anti-Ki67 (1:500; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), or rat anti-CD34 (1:50; BD Biosciences) followed by incubation with biotinylated secondary antibodies (1:200; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) at room temperature (RT) for 1 hour. Immunoreactivity was visualized with the Vectastain ABC system and 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine, Vector NovaRED, or Vector SG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). All sections were photographed using a digital camera attached to a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope. For each optic nerve counted, 3 photographs were taken at a magnification of 10\u00d7 for at least 4 mice/group, including the optic chiasm and the right or left optic nerve just anterior to the chiasm ( Supplemental Fig. 1A ). For brainstem and neocortex regions, 4 photographs were taken at a magnification of 10\u00d7 for at least 4 mice/group ( Supplemental Fig. 1B, C ). The total number of Iba1-positive cells was quantitated in the mouse pre-chiasmatic optic nerves, chiasm, brainstem, and neocortex, as previously described, with the investigator blinded to the genotype and treatment ( 26 ). All Iba1-positive cells were counted regardless of morphology (amoeboid vs. ramified). In the human tumors, the number of Iba1-positive cells was calculated as a percentage of the total number of nucleated cells. Immunofluorescence After transcardial perfusion with Ringer's solution (147 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 2.2 mM CaCl 2 \u00b72H 2 O, with 2.5 USP units/mL heparin sodium injection, 0.02mg/mL lidocaine HCL), WT mouse optic nerves and chiasms were dissected and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4\u00b0C. Tissues were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), embedded in OCT embedding media (Tissue-Tek, Miles, Inc., Elkhart, IN), cut into 10-\u03bcm sections in a cryostat, collected on Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and stored at -20\u00b0C. Slides were washed, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate buffer, blocked, incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with rabbit anti-Iba1 (1:2000), rat anti-CD11b (M1/70, 1:10; BD Biosciences), or mouse anti-Ki67 (1:500; BD Biosciences), followed by incubation with fluorescent secondary antibodies (1:200 goat anti-rat A488, goat anti-rabbit A568, or goat anti-mouse A488; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 1 hour at RT. In all cases, no specific immunostaining was observed in the negative control samples. Images were acquired using an Olympus multichannel confocal microscope in the Washington University Bakewell Neuroimaging Core Facility and Image J image analysis software ( http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/ ; Wayne Rasband, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD) was used to obtain a single collapsed image from an optical stack. Ganciclovir treatment Ganciclovir (GCV; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and administered at a dosage of 50 mg/kg. For the experiments focused on determining the acute effects of microglia ablation on optic glioma proliferation,   mice were divided into 2 groups: One group received daily intraperitoneal GCV injections for 2 weeks starting at 3 weeks or 3 months of age, while the other group received daily intraperitoneal injections of vehicle (PBS) starting at 3 weeks or 3 months of age. Nf1 +/-GFAP CKO-TK Flow cytometry Microglia from mice were collected using previously described procedures with minor modifications ( 27 ). Briefly, for each experiment, optic nerves and chiasms harvested from 7 to 10 mice, transcardially perfused with Ringer's solution, were homogenized through a 70-\u03bcm nylon filter (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), enzymatically digested in Hanks Buffered Salt Solution without calcium and magnesium containing 0.05% collagenase I (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1 \u03bcg/mL N\u03b1-Tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone hydrochloride (TLCK, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.01 mg/mL bovine deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I, Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mM Hepes buffer (pH7.4) for 1 hour at RT, and filtered through a 40-\u03bcm nylon filter (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Brainstem specimens were similarly processed to obtain cells for flow cytometry controls. A discontinuous Percoll gradient (Amersham/GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI) of 30%, 37%, and 70% allowed for collection of an enriched macrophage and microglia sample from the 37% to 70% interface. Alternately, magnetic cell sorting using CD11b microbeads after myelin removal (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) were used to extract the CD11b+ microglia population. After Fc blocking with a CD16/32 antibody (BD Biosciences), cell surface staining was performed with anti-CD45-APC (30-F11, BD Biosciences) and anti-CD11b-PerCP-Cy5.5 antibodies. In some experiments, cells were fixed and permeabilized with the BD Cytofix/Cytoperm Fixation/Permeabilization Kit (BD Biosciences) and then stained with CD68-R-PE (FA-11, AbD Serotec, Oxford, UK) or rabbit anti-Iba1 (Wako) conjugated to R-PE using the Zenon Rabbit IgG Labeling Kit (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). Isotype and fluorescence minus one controls were used to determine nonspecific staining. Flow cytometry data were collected on a BD FACScan flow cytometer retrofitted with a second laser (Cytek, Fremont, CA) using CellQuest (BD Biosciences) and Rainbow software (Cytek) in the High Speed Cell Sorter Core Facility at the Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University, and the data were subsequently analyzed using FlowJo (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR). Viable cells were gated by FSC and SSC characteristics, and the appropriate controls were used for compensation and to determine negatively and positively stained populations, as previously described ( 28 ). Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR Real-time PCR (quantitative PCR) was performed using SYBR Green detection according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was extracted from   and WT optic nerve using Trizol. cDNA was synthesized from total RNA samples using the Ominiscript kit (Qiagen, Alameda, CA). Amplification was performed in 96 well plates in a real-time sequence detection system instrument (Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time System, Hercules, CA). Primer sequences for  Nf1 +/-  were 5\u2032-AGGCCTGTTATTTGGGCGACAT-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032AGCGAGGACCACCAACAGATTT-3\u2032 (reverse). Primer sequences for  Cx3cr1  were 5\u2032-AAATGGGTCCAAGACGCCATGA-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-ACATTGTCCACCCGCTTCTCAA-3\u2032 (reverse). Bio-Rad CFX Manager software was used to convert the fluorescent data into cycle threshold (CT) measurements. The \u0394\u0394CT method was used to calculate changes in fold expression relative to WT optic nerve using \u03b2-actin as an internal control. Cx3cl1 Statistical analyses Student   tests, along with Grubbs' test to determine outliers, were performed for all statistical analyses. Mean and SEM were used for all graphs. For all experiments involving cell quantitation, the investigators were blinded to mouse genotype and treatment. t",
