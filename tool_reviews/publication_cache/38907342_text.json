  "title": "snRNA-seq of human cutaneous neurofibromas before and after selumetinib treatment implicates role of altered Schwann cell states, inter-cellular signaling, and extracellular matrix in treatment response.",
  "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is caused by loss of function variants in the NF1 gene. Most patients with NF1 develop skin lesions called cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs). Currently the only approved therapeutic for NF1 is selumetinib, a mitogen -activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor. The purpose of this study was to analyze the transcriptome of cNF tumors before and on selumetinib treatment to understand both tumor composition and response. We obtained biopsy sets of tumors both pre- and on- selumetinib treatment from the same individuals and were able to collect sets from four separate individuals. We sequenced mRNA from 5844 nuclei and identified 30,442 genes in the untreated group and sequenced 5701 nuclei and identified 30,127 genes in the selumetinib treated group. We identified and quantified distinct populations of cells (Schwann cells, fibroblasts, pericytes, myeloid cells, melanocytes, keratinocytes, and two populations of endothelial cells). While we anticipated that cell proportions might change with treatment, we did not identify any one cell population that changed significantly, likely due to an inherent level of variability between tumors. We also evaluated differential gene expression based on drug treatment in each cell type. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was also used to identify pathways that differ on treatment. As anticipated, we identified a significant decrease in ERK/MAPK signaling in cells including Schwann cells but most specifically in myeloid cells. Interestingly, there is a significant decrease in opioid signaling in myeloid and endothelial cells; this downward trend is also observed in Schwann cells and fibroblasts. Cell communication was assessed by RNA velocity, Scriabin, and CellChat analyses which indicated that Schwann cells and fibroblasts have dramatically altered cell states defined by specific gene expression signatures following treatment (RNA velocity). There are dramatic changes in receptor-ligand pairs following treatment (Scriabin), and robust intercellular signaling between virtually all cell types associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) pathways (Collagen, Laminin, Fibronectin, and Nectin) is downregulated after treatment. These response specific gene signatures and interaction pathways could provide clues for understanding treatment outcomes or inform future therapies.",

Written informed consent was obtained from patients participating in clinical trial number  NCT02839720 . Demographics for tumor samples used for either snRNA-seq or histology are provided in Table\u00a0 1 . Tumors pre- and post-treatment were different because the whole tumor was removed for each sample. Information includes sex, age, tumor location (body region), change in individual tumor size post-treatment, change in size of tumors located in the same body region post treatment, change in size of all tumors measured post treatment, the number of cycles of selumetinib, dose of selumetinib, and the assay for which the tumor was utilized (snRNASeq or histology/immunofluorescence). With one exception, all on-treatment biopsy samples used in this study were obtained within 8\u00a0h of the patients receiving preceding selumetinib dose, which correlates with the expected peak selumetinib concentrations. Biopsy from patient 1 was taken off treatment for 4\u00a0weeks prior to sample collection. Due to lack of power, variability within and between patients, and unavailable measurements, no attempts were made to correlate changes in tumor size of treated samples and any changes in gene or pathway expression.

Nuclei were isolated via 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009Genomics protocol. Briefly, cNF samples were broken into finer pieces via scissors and then added to chilled lysis buffer (10\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl\u2009+\u200910\u00a0mM NaCl\u2009+\u20093\u00a0mM MgCl2\u2009+\u20090.1%NP40\u2009+\u20090.2ug RNAse inhibitor) for 15\u00a0min with periodic mixing via wide bore tip pipets. After lysis nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation. The nuclei pellets were resuspended in wash buffer (1% BSA in PBS\u2009+\u20090.2ug RNAse inhibitor) and passed through a 40uM strainer to remove cellular debris and centrifuged again. Nuclei were then stained with 1\u20131.5ug (depending on pellet size) of TotalSeq\u2122 anti-Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins Hashtag Antibody\u2019s (B0451, B0452, B0453, or B0457) for 30\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. cNF nuclei pellets were then washed three times in wash buffer, after which the nuclei were resuspended in a final volume of 200\u2013300 uL of wash buffer. Prior to sorting the nuclei were stained with propidium iodine and FACs sorted on a BD Aria. After sorting for a pure population of nuclei the samples proceeded to the 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009snRNA-seq protocol. Data Processing Nuclei were sequenced via Illumina\u2019s NovaSeq6000 system, and resulting sequencing files were run through the Cell Ranger pipeline v7.1.0. Data analysis was completed using R (v 4.3.0\u2013v 4.3.1) Seurat [ 24 ,  25 ] (v4.3.0\u2013v5) and refdata-gex-GRCh38-2020-A (GRCh38 human genome reference) was used to analyze the snRNA-seq data. Nuclei were filtered based on having 200\u2009<\u2009x\u2009<\u20094000 feature/genes per cell and having\u2009<\u20095% mitochondrial genes. All samples in each group were integrated together using Seurat for a final data set consisting of 11,545 nuclei and 30,442 identified genes. Cells were integrated based on the top 2000 differentially expressed (DE) genes in the combined dataset. Principle component analysis (PCA) was conducted to determine the number of dimensions to use for UMAP construction (based on elbow plot, 50 dimensions were used). To account for technical and sample variation, Harmony batch correction was conducted and used for downstream analysis. A UMAP was constructed, and clusters were determined using a resolution of 0.4. This yielded a total of 14 clusters. Using canonical genes from the literature and PanglaoDB database [ 26 ] for cell type identification, cell clusters were labeled manually to identify cell types (Supplemental Table 1). We observed two distinct endothelial cell populations (named endothelial cells 1 and 2), keratinocytes, melanocytes, pericytes, fibroblasts, myeloid cells, and Schwann cells. Each identified cell type was subset and DE genes for untreated and selumetinib treated were computed. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) [ 27 ] was utilized on the differentially expressed dataset (minimum PCT 5% and minimum Log2FC |0.25| or |0.5| depending on the cell population) to determine significantly altered signaling pathways between treated and untreated cells. Python  conversion and ForceAtlas2 Upon the analysis we converted the finalized.h5Seurat object to.h5ad using SeuratDisk Convert() function for further Python-dependent analysis. By connecting scanpy [ 28 ], palantir, and scFates [ 29 ] packages, we generate an advanced version of ForceAtlas2 [ 30 ] embedding. This was achieved by modifying the default functions with palantir.utils run_diffusion_maps() on the pregenerated PCA projections, and using the palantir embedding for analyzing the neighbors. Upon that, we generated a ForceAtlas2 embedding to be used in the downstream analysis. Cell\u2013cell communication atlas explorer After processing our snRNA-seq dataset in Seurat, downstream analysis in CellChat was conducted. CellChat was run using all cell types that were identified within the snRNA-seq dataset. We utilized the entire CellChat database for analysis. Due to the sequencing depth of our snRNA-seq data set (mean reads per cell 32,871\u2013253,196) we did not use the optional function for projecting to the PPI database. In the function computeCommunProb we used default settings while changing the type parameter to \u201ctruncatedMean\u201d and the trim parameter to 0.1. In the filterCommunication function we set the min.cells parameter to 10. After the initial CellChat objects were made for both the treated samples and control samples separately, we utilized the function getMaxWeight to directly compare the cell signaling communication pathways between the control and treated samples. RNA velocity Upon performing the main Seurat processing, we used the Cell Ranger output folder to apply samtools, velocyto and scvelo packages to perform the bash- and Python-dependent analysis. samtools and velocyto were used to generate the.loom spliced/unspliced output out of the standard cell ranger.bam output. We sorted the possorted_genome_bam.bam file using samtools (-t CB -O BAM) to generate cellsorted_possorted_genome_bam.bam file. This file was used to create the.loom file with the function velocyto run10x. The reference genome used for generating the.loom file is GRRCh38, and the repeat annotation mask was obtained for the genome from the UCSC genome browser in.gtf format. The dataset in.h5seurat format was converted into.h5ad using SeuratDisk package, and the downstream analysis was performed using the scanpy and scvelo [ 31 ] packages in Jupyter Notebook. We merged.loom files with the.h5ad integrated dataset to quantify the first and second order moments (means and uncentered variances) among nearest neighbors in PCA space by utilizing the scvelo.pp.moments() function. Upon that, we estimate velocity (scvelo.tl.velocity()) and project the results with velocity embedding graph upon utilizing the scFates package ForceAtlas2 dimensionality reduction method (basis\u2009=\u2009\u2018draw_graph_fa\u2019). Scriabin cell\u2013cell interactions We performed the analysis following the standard tutorial with a few modifications. Modifications include custom relabeling the \u2018sender-of-interest\u2019 and \u2018receiver-of-interest\u2019 populations for the sender- and receiver- focused analysis. The population of interest was relabeled to be the sender of interest, to avoid the package limitation of pairwise comparison, we included all the rest of the populations by allowing them to carry the same label, and vice versa for the population of interest to be the receiver of interest. Statistical analysis Two-way t-test was used for differences in cell proportions. Cell culture Immortalized cutaneous neurofibroma Schwann cell lines (icNF 97.2a, icNF 97.2b, and icNF 98.4d) were obtained from Dr. Margaret Wallace. Genotypes are as follows (numbering per NM_0000267.3): icNF 97.2a: germline c.233delA; somatic c.1929delG; icNF 97.2b: germline c.233delA; somatic c.1391\u2009+\u20092delTA; and icNF 98.4d: germline c.6641\u2009+\u20091G\u2009>\u2009T; somatic c.6253delG. Cell lines were isolated from cNF tumors and immortalized using the normal human telomerase (hTERT) and murine Cdk4 genes as previously described [ 32 ]. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM)\u2009+\u200910% fetal bovine serum, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009penicillin\u2013streptomycin, and 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009L-Glutamine using standard culture procedures. Plates were coated in 4ug/mL of laminin and incubated for 30\u00a0min before culturing. RT-qPCR icNF cell lines were treated with selumetinib at 5uM and RNA was harvested after 48\u00a0h using a Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s directions. RT-qPCR was performed on a 384 well plate using a Luna Universal One-Step RT-qPCR kit (NEB cat# E3005) with the following QuantiTech Qiagen primers:  KCNMA1  (cat# QT00024157),  PRKCE  (cat# QT00016352),  OPCML  (cat# QT01005361),  GRIK2  (cat# QT00016597),  CADM2  (cat# QT00048888),  CREB5  (cat# QT00054488),  CAMK1D  (cat# QT00036344), and  ITGB8  (cat# QT00038507) using a Roche LightCycler480 Real Time PCR machine (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Cycling parameters were as follows: one round of 55\u00b0 C for 10\u00a0min; 45 cycles of: 95  o  C for 1\u00a0min, 95  o  C for 10\u00a0s, 60\u00a0 o C for 30\u00a0s. Relative quantification was calculated using the ddCt method with GAPDH as the internal control. Immunofluorescence staining Frozen cNFs were directly embedded in Tissue-Tek\u00ae O.C.T. Compound and once frozen sectioned on a cryostat at 10 microns and collected onto slides. Frozen sections were then used for immunofluorescence staining. Briefly, sections were thawed and treated with acetone, dried and washed three times in PBS. Sections were blocked with SuperBlock\u2122 T20 (PBS) Blocking Buffer (ThermoFisher cat# 37516) and put in primary antibody at 4\u00a0\u00b0C overnight (CD11b at 1:100 dilution (abcam Cat # ab52478) for myeloid cells and SOX10 at 1:500 dilution (abcam Cat # ab155279) for Schwann cells.) The following day slides were washed three times in PBS and then treated with secondary antibody Goat anti-Rabbit, Alexa Fluor\u2122 488 1:2000 and Goat anti-Rabbit, Alexa Fluor\u2122 594 1:2000 for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. Slides were again washed three times in PBS and mounted in anti-fade with DAPI (Invitrogen Cat# P36931 ) prior to sealing and imaging on Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope.",

  "introduction": "Introduction Pathogenic variants in the  NF1  gene  (NF1)  lead to neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a neurogenetic disorder affecting\u2009~\u20091:3000 individuals [ 1 ].  NF1  encodes neurofibromin, a multidomain protein that acts as a GTPase activating protein that downregulates Ras signaling to control cellular transcription and proliferation [ 2 ]. NF1 is characterized by a variety of clinical features, including the development of benign skin lesions called cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs) that occur due to biallelic reduction/loss of  NF1  expression in the Schwann cell lineages [ 3 ]. cNFs are abnormal growths between\u2009<\u20091\u00a0mm to several cm in diameter that present as soft nodules along peripheral nerves in the dermis layer of skin [ 4 ,  5 ]. They are observed in\u2009>\u200999% of adult affected individuals [ 6 ]. While cNFs do not progress to malignancy, affected individuals often consider them to be a highly burdensome feature of the disorder due to symptoms such as pain, itching, and irritation, as well as physical disfigurement that can occur due to the hundreds to thousands of cNFs that can develop [ 4 ,  7 ,  8 ]. cNFs are composed of Schwann-lineage cells, infiltrating immune cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells embedded in a collagenous extracellular matrix (ECM) [ 9 \u2013 11 ]. Collagen makes up to 50% of the tumor\u2019s dry weight and prior studies suggest the ECM plays a significant role in the development and maintenance of the microenvironment in cNFs [ 4 ,  10 ,  12 \u2013 14 ]. Fibroblasts are responsible for ECM deposition and reorganization, and transcriptomic studies have identified collagen VI as being the most highly expressed collagen in cNFs by fibroblasts [ 10 ]. Collagen helps maintain basement membrane integrity and promotes angiogenesis and inflammation through unknown paracrine signaling mechanisms [ 10 ]. The only approved therapy for NF1 involves the downstream inactivation of Ras signaling through the MEK inhibitor selumetinib. Selumetinib has been approved to treat children with inoperable, symptomatic plexiform neurofibromas (pNFs) [ 15 ]. Therapeutic effects are primarily attributed to the inhibition of cell proliferation [ 16 ], though other mechanisms may be involved. Unfortunately, while tumors regress, they do not disappear and may regrow after treatment has stopped. Many patients experience toxic side effects, and others (about 30%) don\u2019t respond [ 17 ]. Thus, further studies to determine why some patients don\u2019t respond to treatment are needed. Ideally, a gene signature that correlates with either positive or negative selumetinib response could be developed, as has been done for a large and diverse panel of cell lines, could be developed [ 18 ]. While MEK activation is a prerequisite for selumetinib sensitivity, as Ras has additional effectors independent of Raf (e.g. PI3K), these effectors may mediate resistance to MEK inhibitors. Transcriptomic studies of selumetinib on human pNFs are not yet reported, though one group has evaluated the proteome of mouse pNF tumor cells treated with MEK inhibitor PD0325901 [ 19 ]. This study looked at mouse dorsal root ganglion cells cultured ex vivo and treated for 3\u00a0days with 1 ug/ml  PD032590 . Subsequent proteomic analysis suggests that the ECM and intercellular communication play a robust role in development of neurofibromas and that MEK inhibition results in inhibition of the ECM profile and TGF-  signaling. \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\upbeta$$\\end{document} \u03b2 Currently there are no approved medical therapies for cNFs, though several are in clinical trials. We took advantage of one such clinical trial investigating cNF response to multiple monthly cycles of oral selumetinib ( NCT02839720 ). Herein, we provide transcriptomic evaluation of matched patients pre- and on- selumetinib treated cNFs using snRNA-seq to evaluate the response to selumetinib treatment. We define cell populations, evaluate differential gene expression and pathway analysis, evaluate intrinsic and extrinsic cellular signaling through RNA velocity [ 20 ], Scriabin [ 21 ], and CellChat [ 22 ,  23 ] to assess how cNF tumors are impacted by selumetinib. While we find minimal changes in cellular composition (primarily involving Schwann and myeloid cells) and gene expression post- treatment, we see major differences in cell communication post-treatment. RNA velocity analysis indicates evidence for altered cell states in Schwann cells and fibroblasts post treatment, implicating them as the primary target cells for selumetinib. There are also changes in utilization of receptor ligand pairs, suggesting an important role of the ECM in cNF cellular signaling.",
  "results": "Results snRNA-sequencing of cutaneous neurofibromas before and on- selumetinib treatment A total of 11,545 nuclei were used for analysis in Seurat. Using both mitochondrial content and number of features to filter out low quality nuclei or doublets we obtained 5,844 total nuclei and 30,442 genes from untreated tumors, and 5,701 nuclei and 30,127 genes were obtained from 4 match-paired treated tumors for a total of 8 tumors (Fig.\u00a0 1 A and Supplemental Fig.\u00a01A). The nuclei were sequenced with a high read depth ranging from 32,871\u2013253,196 mean reads per nuclei depending on the sample. Using canonical genes from PanglaoDB and literature for specific cell types, we identified cells as: Schwann cells, fibroblasts, myeloid cells, two distinct populations of endothelial cells (endothelial 1 and 2), pericytes, keratinocytes, and a population of melanocytes (Fig.\u00a0 1 A and Supplemental Fig.\u00a01B). A cell frequency bar graph was created to compare the cellular composition of control and treated samples (Fig.\u00a0 1 B,  C ). Although we see variation in cell frequency based on treatment in the Endothelial 1 cells (frequency 0.548 to 0.439), Schwann cells (frequency 0.063 to 0.119), and Myeloid cell (frequency 0.01 to 0.029) populations, upon statistical analysis using a two-way t-test there were no statistically significant differences (Fig.\u00a0 1 C). Individual sample frequencies and fold changes between control and selumetinib treated cNFs are available in Supplemental Table\u00a02. Fig.\u00a01 snRNA-seq of cutaneous neurofibromas pre (control or Con) and post treatment (Tx) with selumetinib.

( B ) Summative bar-graph of cell type frequency between untreated control and selumetinib treated cNFs. Cell types are color coded as per the legend. ( C ) Table lists each cell type and frequency along with value of t-test between control and treated samples. ( D ) Topmost differentially expressed genes between selumetinib treated and control Schwann cells along with significant p-values and average log2 fold changes (FC) (red lettering indicates genes selected for RT-qPCR validation). Positive log2FC indicates increased expression and negative log2FC indicates decreased expression in selumetinib treated samples compared to control Differential gene expression (DGE) We evaluated each cell type for DGE based on treatment. Schwann cells are presumably the most clinically relevant, and the list of the top 20 up and down regulated genes are shown in Fig.\u00a0 1 D. The log2 fold changes were modest; raw data for all cell types is in Supplemental Tables 3\u201311. Ingenuity Pathway analysis ( IPA ) exhibits decreases in calcium and opioid signaling post treatment All cell populations were selected to assess pathway differences in the selumetinib treated tumors compared to untreated tumors. Full IPA pathway analysis for all cell types identified are available in Supplemental Table\u00a012. While multiple pathways display significant z-scores, we call particular attention to a few pathways for each cell type. In Schwann cells, we observed a significant deactivation of \u201cCalcium Signaling\u201d (Z score \u2212\u20092.309) and deactivation of \u201cOpioid Signaling Pathway\u201d (Z-score\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20091.789) (Fig.\u00a0 2 A). These two pathways are possibly linked. Calcium signaling is altered in patient-derived NF1\u2009\u00b1\u2009human keratinocytes [ 33 ] and is also increased in Nf1\u2009\u00b1\u2009mouse neurons [ 34 ]. Calcium signaling is involved in pain transmission and the neurofibromin\u2013CRMP2 signaling cascade which affects calcium channel activity and regulates nociceptive neurotransmission [ 35 ]. We also see decreased \u201cIntegrin Signaling\u201d (Z-score \u2212\u20092.236). Integrins expressed in tumor cells contribute to tumor progression and integrin adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) provides the traction required for malignant tumor cell invasion [ 36 ]. We observed the anticipated decrease in \u201cERK/MAPK signaling\u201d as selumetinib is a MEK inhibitor, though this decrease did not reach significance in this cell type. Dot plots were obtained from differentially expressed genes for each pathway in Schwann cells (Fig.\u00a0 2 B\u2013E) which allowed us to view specific genes in each pathway and the percent of cells expressing each gene. In myeloid cells we observed a significant deactivation of \u201cERK/MAPK signaling\u201d and significant deactivation of \u201cTGF-\u03b2 Signaling\u201d (Z-score\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20092.065 and \u2212\u20092.333 respectively). We also saw decreased Calcium signaling (z score\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20091.941) (Fig.\u00a0 2 F). In fibroblasts, we again observed significant deactivation of \u201cCalcium Signaling\u201d (Z-score\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20092.309) (Fig.\u00a0 2 G). We also saw reduction in \u201cIntegrin Signaling\u201d (Z-score\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.707) and Opioid Signaling (Z-score\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20091.897). While the Endothelial cells 1 population was the most frequent cell type in both control and treated tumors (Fig.\u00a0 1 B, C), their gene expression seems least affected by treatment, and it had reduced \u201cCalcium Signaling\u201d (Z-score\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20091.342) (Fig.\u00a0 2 H). These same pathways are depicted for all other cell types in Supplemental Fig.\u00a02A\u2013D. Note decreased calcium (Z-score \u2212\u20092.673) and opioid signaling (Z-score \u2212\u20092.197) in Endothelial 2 cells (Supplemental Fig.\u00a02A). Fig.\u00a02 Ingenuity Pathway analysis (IPA) of selected cell populations exhibit changes in signaling. ( A ,  F \u2013 H ) Bar graphs showing select pathways pre- and post- selumetinib treatment in Schwann cells ( A ), myeloid cells ( F ), fibroblasts ( G ), and endothelial cells ( H ). ( B \u2013 E ) Dot plots for indicated signaling pathways (ERK/MAPK, Calcium, opioid, and Integrin) in Schwann cells. \u201cNP\u201d indicates that the pathway was not present To investigate specific genes involved in these pathway changes, dot plots were created from differentially expressed genes related to \u201cOpioid Signaling Pathway\u201d and \u201cCalcium Signaling\u201d in Fibroblasts (Supplemental Figs.\u00a02E, F) and \u201cCalcium Signaling\u201d in myeloid cells (Supplemental Fig.\u00a02H) and endothelial 1 cells (Supplemental Fig.\u00a02H). These data indicated that both opioid and calcium signaling are altered in multiple cell types following selumetinib treatment and allowed us to define specific genes for later validation. RNA Velocity Analysis indicates selumetinib treatment alters cell states and gene signatures in Schwann cells and fibroblasts To evaluate how RNA expression and cell state changes between control and treated cells, we utilized the RNA velocity cell fate trajectory reconstruction approach. FA2-based plots were generated and utilized to view the trajectory of various cell populations (Fig.\u00a0 3 A). Notably the Schwann cells and the fibroblasts showed different trajectories between control and treated groups (Schwann cells are circled in red, Fig.\u00a0 3 B). We also observe changes for the myeloid population, although the cell number was insufficient to build the trajectories. Schwann cell subset trajectory analysis indicated altered cell states following treatment (Fig.\u00a0 3 C). For untreated Schwann cells, we observe two main cell states, with a short one-way transition between them for the non-treated group (Fig.\u00a0 3 D).

For the fibroblast population, we observed heterogeneity: one (Cluster 5) and two unique branches, representing cell state trajectories in non-treated and treated groups (Cluster 2 and 14) (Fig.\u00a0 3 E\u2013G). The non-treated fibroblast population (Cluster 5) is characterized by  PRRX1, COL14A1,  and  CDH11,  and the populations in the treated condition (clusters 2 and 14) carry the profile of  ZBTB16, PID1, KAZN,  and  PTPRG, RORA, DLCK1,  respectively (Supplemental Fig.\u00a03). Our RNA velocity data indicated that both Schwann cells and fibroblast are undergoing cell state changes following selumetinib treatment.

( E ) RNA Velocity analysis of fibroblasts in untreated ( F ) vs treated ( G ) shows several distinct states and trajectories, characterized by different transcriptomic patterns, highlighting the heterogeneity of fibroblasts subpopulations Scriabin analysis shows the change in cell\u2013cell interaction upon treatment at single-cell resolution We evaluated a new single-cell-resolved interaction analysis through binning (Scriabin)\u2014an adaptable and computationally efficient method for cell\u2013cell communication (CCC) analysis. Scriabin dissects complex communicative pathways at single-cell resolution by combining curated ligand\u2013receptor interaction databases, models of downstream intracellular signaling, anchor-based dataset integration and gene network analysis to recover biologically meaningful CCC edges at single-cell resolution [ 37 ]. Our cell\u2013cell interactions analysis demonstrates that before treatment (and in comparison to other cell types) cNF Schwann cells do not express unique ligands or receptors as each is expressed in at least one other cell type (Supplemental Fig.\u00a03). The Schwann cell population is similar to fibroblasts in terms of ligand and receptor expression (Supplemental Figs.\u00a03 and 4A). However, selumetinib induced a major shift in the ligands-receptors profile of Schwann cells that distinguished them from other populations (Fig.\u00a0 4 B). The strongest connectivity for the non-treated group is shown between Schwann cells (blue-green color in Fig.\u00a0 4 A) and Endothelial 1 (olive color in Fig.\u00a0 4 A) via NCAM1-FGFR1, FGF2-FGFR1, EREG-EGFR (Fig.\u00a0 4 A). Upon treatment the Schwann cells lose most of the ligand-receptor pathways that interact with Endothelial 1 cells and retain only NCAM1-FGFR1 (Fig.\u00a0 4 B). The strongest interaction for Endothelial cells 1 (olive colored Fig.\u00a0 4 B) upon treatment was with Fibroblasts (green color in Fig.\u00a0 4 B) through CXCL12-ACKR3 axis (Fig.\u00a0 4 B). This interaction was not detected prior to treatment, since Schwann cells had a similar receptor-ligand profile to fibroblast at this point. The Myeloid cells (lavender colored in Fig.\u00a0 4 A) lose their interleukin signaling after treatment as evidenced by decrease in strength of IL4-IL4R and IL4-IL13RA1 upon treatment. Fig.\u00a04 Scriabin analysis shows the change in cell\u2013cell interaction upon treatment at single-cell resolution. Top differentially expressed ligand-receptor pairs in untreated ( A ) vs, treated ( B ). Focused analysis of Schwann cell communication at the single-cell resolution allows us to study them as senders (ligand expression,  C ,  D ) and receivers (receptor expression,  E ,  F ) in untreated ( C ,  E ) and treated ( D ,  F ). This is in comparison to all other cell types being merged We profiled Schwann cell ligand and receptor parameters before and after treatment (Fig.\u00a0 4 C\u2013F). As Scriabin analysis is mainly oriented to analyze one population that is the sender-of-interest and receiver-of-interest in the dataset, we defined \u201cSchwann cells\u201d and have merged all non-Schwann cell classes to be used as comparator. Before treatment Schwann cells were characterized by expression of ligands: ADIPOQ, CXCL8, TGFA, THPO (circled in blue in Fig.\u00a0 4 C) and receptors CDH2, GFRA3, HKDC1, KCNH2, and MAL (circled in green in Fig.\u00a0 4 E). Upon treatment major ligands included: ADIPOQ, AGT, BMP7, CXCL8, IL22, TGFA (circled in red Fig.\u00a0 4 D). Treatment induced receptors include ADAM23, ADGRL3, CDH4, KCNIP4, SLITRK6 (circled in black Fig.\u00a0 4 F). TGFA ligand is present both before and after treatment in Schwann cells, while the TGF  program switched from TGF \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\upbeta$$\\end{document} \u03b2 1 to TGF \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\upbeta$$\\end{document} \u03b2 2 upon treatment (denoted with black arrows in Fig.\u00a0 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\upbeta$$\\end{document} \u03b2 4 E,  F ). CellChat details dynamic intra- and inter-cellular signaling in cNFs involving the ECM both pre- and post- selumetinib treatment To get a more complete picture regarding how cells were communicating we implemented CellChat analysis. CellChat predicts major cell signaling inputs and outputs and how those cells and signals coordinate for functions using network analysis and pattern recognition approaches [ 22 ]. Summary heatmaps of incoming and outgoing signaling patterns for all cell types in both control and treated samples are provided in Supplemental Fig.4. Bar graphs at the top of each heat map indicate only modest changes between cell types overall. However, since prior literature suggests that the ECM plays a major role cNF biology, we looked specifically at these pathways. CellChat analysis indicated a significant role for cell\u2013cell communication in ECM-related pathways in these neurofibromas, which was affected by selumetinib treatment. Consistent with neurofibromas containing significant quantities of extracellular matrix, there was robust cell adhesion signaling in our dataset detailing Laminin, Collagen, Fibronectin (FN1), and Nectin signaling to and from multiple cell types (Fig.\u00a0 5 A\u2013D). While laminin signaling appeared to be robust even with selumetinib treatment, Collagen signaling was diminished slightly in treated tumors, as untreated pericytes and fibroblasts had robust connections, as indicated by purple and pink pathways, but pericytes from treated tumors did not signal as strongly to treated fibroblasts. FN1 signaling initiates from endothelial cells in untreated samples (brown pathways in Fig.\u00a0 5 C) but was dramatically inhibited in treated cells. Nectin signaling was also diminished in treated cells, as untreated endothelial cells send robust signals that are diminished in treated samples.

We saw changes in TGF-  signaling (Fig.\u00a0 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\upbeta$$\\end{document} \u03b2 5 E). While control samples showed endothelial 1 cells receiving signaling from themselves and endothelial 2 cells, treated samples show TGF-  signaling from myeloid cells and pericytes to the endothelial 1 cells, Schwann cells and keratinocytes and each other. PARS (protease activated receptors) signaling was present in untreated samples, but not detected in treated samples (Fig.\u00a0 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\upbeta$$\\end{document} \u03b2 5 F). PARs play a role in a multitude of physiological processes including pro-inflammatory response and pain sensation [ 38 ]. PARs may also control TGF-  signaling [ \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\upbeta$$\\end{document} \u03b2 39 ,  40 ]. Another pathway that was observed only in the untreated samples is the SELE (E-Selectin) signaling pathway (Fig.\u00a0 5 G). In the control samples we observe moderate to strong signaling from the endothelial 1 cell population to all other cell types. E-selectin is a cell adhesion molecule expressed only on endothelial cells. Like other selectins, E-selectin plays an important part in inflammation. Additionally, E-selectin is inhibited by TGF-  [ \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\upbeta$$\\end{document} \u03b2 41 ]. As collagens, ECM and basement membrane proteins have already been implicated to play a role in both neurofibroma development and MEK inhibitor response in mouse DRG cells[ 19 ], we evaluated our data for similarities. GO Cellular component analysis of our snRNA-seq data from Schwann cells indicates that collagen containing extracellular matrix (GO0062023), ECM (GO0031012), and extracellular region (GO0005576) all were among the top terms characterizing cNF response to selumetinib (Supplemental Fig.\u00a05A). When we examined the expression of ECM proteins from the cellular component GO in different cell classes, we saw statistical changes (FC\u2009>|0.5| and adj P value\u2009<\u20090.1) in many including: ITIH5 in Schwann cells and fibroblasts, COL14A1 in all cells, Schwann cells, and fibroblasts, FN1 in endothelial cell 2, and COL4A1 in endothelial cell 2 (Supplemental Fig.\u00a05B). Immunofluorescence staining of cutaneous neurofibromas and qRT-PCR analysis of cNF derived Schwann cell lines reveals no differences in cell frequencies or gene expression with selumetinib treatment To investigate the differences in cell frequencies before and after selumetinib treatment, three sets of tumors were used for immunofluorescence staining to evaluate the frequency of Schwann cells and Myeloid cells in the microenvironment between control and treated samples using cell type- specific markers (SOX10 for Schwann cells (green) and CD11b for myeloid cells (red); DAPI nuclear stain (blue)) (Fig.\u00a0 6 A,  C ). Densitometry was performed using ImageJ and histograms were generated showing the quantified fluorescence for each cell type after normalization to DAPI-stained nuclei (Fig.\u00a0 6 B,  D ). As suggested by the snRNA-Seq dataset, there was no significant difference in the proportion of myeloid and Schwann cells after selumetinib treatment. Notably, there was significant variability in the number of cNF Schwann cells between the patients, with two of three patients having an increase in total Schwann cells in their neurofibromas. Similarly, there was significant variability in cNF myeloid cells based on the patient and two of three patients showed decreases in myeloid cells. Hence, variability between and within patients is large. Fig.\u00a06 Validation of cell frequency and DGE from snRNASeq.

( F ) q RT-PCR analysis of specified genes in untreated control cells and cells treated with 5uM selumetinib for 48\u00a0h (expression on y-axis is normalized delta-delta Ct) As Schwann cells are critical to the NF1 phenotype and formation of neurofibromas, we further assessed DGE data specifically in Schwann cells. Selected genes from the top DGE genes list (Fig.\u00a0 1 E, genes highlighted in red text) ( CADM2, GRIK2, KCNMA1,  and  OPCML ) and selected genes from opioid signaling ( CAMK1D, CREB5,  and  PRKCE ), calcium signaling ( CAMK1D  and  CREB5 ) and Integrin signaling ( ITGB8 ) (Fig.\u00a0 2 B) were selected for RT qPCR analysis. We utilized three different cNF immortalized Schwann cell lines from NF1 patients (icNF97.2a and icNF97.2b from one patient, and icNF98.4 from another patient). These 3 cell lines were selected as they are human Schwann cell lines that were derived specifically from cutaneous neurofibromas, similar lines are not available commercially. Cells were treated with 5 uM Selumetinib for 48\u00a0h. Despite pERK inhibition with selumetinib treatment based on Western blots (Fig.\u00a0 6 E), data analysis from qPCR revealed no significant difference in gene expression after selumetinib treatment of these cultured Schwann cells (Fig.\u00a0 6 F).",
  "discussion": "Conclusion We find that while cNFs have well-described and extensive ECM, they also have an active microenvironment with all cell types signaling to each other. This signaling is particularly robust for extracellular matrix signaling pathways. Treatment with selumetinib alters cell state and signaling primarily in Schwann cells, fibroblasts, and myeloid cells. Each cell type displays a unique gene signature and ligand- receptor interactions upon response to selumetinib that upon future study and validation may be able to predict or enhance tumor response.",
