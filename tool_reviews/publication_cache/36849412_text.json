  "abstract": "Individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 develop rat sarcoma virus (RAS)-mitogen-activated protein kinase-mitogen-activated and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (RAS-MAPK-MEK)-driven nerve tumors called neurofibromas. Although MEK inhibitors transiently reduce volumes of most plexiform neurofibromas in mouse models and in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients, therapies that increase the efficacy of MEK inhibitors are needed. BI-3406 is a small molecule that prevents Son of Sevenless (SOS)1 interaction with Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncoprotein (KRAS)-GDP, interfering with the RAS-MAPK cascade upstream of MEK. Single agent SOS1 inhibition had no significant effect in the DhhCre;Nf1",
