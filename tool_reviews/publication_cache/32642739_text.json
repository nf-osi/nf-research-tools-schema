Author information: (1)Pediatric Oncology Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of  Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.  Up to 10% of all pediatric cancer patients may have an underlying germline  mutation which predisposed them to develop a malignancy. With more patients  being tested for and diagnosed with genetic tumor predisposition syndromes,  there has been improved characterization of their many nonmalignant  manifestations. However, designing and implementing clinical trials to treat the  nonmalignant tumor and non-tumor manifestations of these syndromes poses many  unique challenges. Unlike trials for malignancies where tumor response and  survival can be used as straightforward trial endpoints, the nonmalignant  manifestations are often chronic, evolve more slowly over time, and may not be  immediately life-threatening. Therefore, they will likely require a different  approach to both testing and treatment with a focus on more functional and  patient-reported outcome trial endpoints. The recent success of treatment trials  for the benign tumors plexiform neurofibromas in the tumor predisposition  syndrome neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) can be used as a model for the  development of clinical trials in other tumor predisposition syndromes. In this  article, we review the unique challenges associated with targeting the  nonmalignant aspects of these conditions as well as some of the lessons learned  from the NF1 experience which may be applied to other syndromes in the future.
