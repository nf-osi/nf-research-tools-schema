The variable manifestation of phenotypes that occur in patients with  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) includes benign and malignant neurocutaneous  tumors for which no adequate treatment exists. Cell-based screening of known  bioactive compounds library identified the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)  inhibitor Cantharidin and the L-type calcium channel blocker Nifedipine as  potential candidates for NF1 pharmacotherapy. Validation of screening results  using human NF1-associated malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) cells  showed that Cantharidin effectively impeded MPNST cell growth, while Nifedipine  treatment significantly decreased local tumor growth in an MPNST xenograft  animal model. These data suggest that inhibitors of PP2A, as well as calcium  channel blockers, might be used in broader MPNST preclinical studies as single  agents or in combinatorial therapeutic strategies.
