  "abstract": "Vestibular schwannoma (VS) is the most common tumor of the cerebellopontine angle. Despite the increasing diagnosis of sporadic VS over the past decade, the use of traditional microsurgeries to treat VS has decreased. This is likely a result of the adoption of serial imaging as the most common initial evaluation and treatment strategy, especially for small-sized VS. However, the pathobiology of VSs remains unclear, and elucidating the genetic information of tumor tissue may reveal novel insights. The present study performed a comprehensive genomic analysis of all exons in the key tumor suppressor and oncogenes from 10 small (<15 mm) sporadic VS samples. The evaluations identified",
