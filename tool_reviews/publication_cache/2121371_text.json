  "abstract": "The von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis locus, NF1, encodes a protein with homology restricted to the catalytic region of the RAS GTPase-activating protein, GAP, and with extensive homology to the IRA1 and IRA2 gene products of the yeast S. cerevisiae. A segment of the NF1 cDNA gene, expressed in yeast, can complement loss of IRA function and can inhibit both wild-type and mutant activated human H-ras genes that are coexpressed in yeast. Yeast expressing the NF1 segment have increased H-ras GTPase-stimulating activity. These studies indicate that the NF1 gene product can interact with RAS proteins and demonstrate structural and functional similarities and differences among the GAP, IRA1, IRA2, and NF1 proteins.",
