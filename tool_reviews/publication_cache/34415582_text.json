  "title": "Notch signaling via Hey1 and Id2b regulates M\u00fcller glia's regenerative response to retinal injury.",
  "abstract": "Zebrafish M\u00fcller glia (MG) respond to retinal injury by suppressing Notch signaling and producing progenitors for retinal repair. A certain threshold of injury-derived signal must be exceeded in order to engage MG in a regenerative response (MG's injury-response threshold). Pan-retinal Notch inhibition expands the zone of injury-responsive MG at the site of focal injury, suggesting that Notch signaling regulates MG's injury-response threshold. We found that Notch signaling enhanced chromatin accessibility and gene expression at a subset of regeneration-associated genes in the uninjured retina. Two Notch effector genes, hey1 and id2b, were identified that reflect bifurcation of the Notch signaling pathway, and differentially regulate MG's injury-response threshold and proliferation of MG-derived progenitors. Furthermore, Notch signaling component gene repression in the injured retina suggests a role for Dll4, Dlb, and Notch3 in regulating Notch signaling in MG and epistasis experiments confirm that the Dll4/Dlb-Notch3-Hey1/Id2b signaling pathway regulates MG's injury-response threshold and proliferation.",

Zebrafish were kept at 26\u201328\u00b0C with a 14/10 hr light/dark cycle. Adult male and female fish from 6 to 12 months of age were used in these studies.  1016 tuba1a:GFP ,  gfap:GFP ,  hsp70:DN-MAML-GFP, gfap:mCherry  and  tp1:mCherry , fish were previously described( Fausett & Goldman, 2006 ;  Johnson et al., 2016 ;  Kassen et al., 2007 ;  Parsons et al., 2009 ;  L. Zhao et al., 2014 ). We generated  hsp70:dll4-P2A-GFP, hsp70:GFP-P2A-dlb, hsp70:GFP-P2A-hey1 ,  hsp70:id2b-P2A-GFP, ubi:Cas9 ,  u6:dll4-gRNAs  and  1,2 u6:n3-gRNAs  transgenic fish using standard recombinant DNA techniques and Tol2 vector backbone. Expression constructs were injected into single cell zebrafish embryos as previously described ( 1,2 Fausett & Goldman, 2006 ). Fish were anesthetized in tricaine and retinas were injured with needle pokes (2\u20134 injuries/retina for analysis of proliferation and protein expression on retinal sections and 10 injuries/retina for PCR, ATACseq and RNAseq), as previously described( Fausett & Goldman, 2006 ). Cell proliferation assays To investigate cell proliferation, fish received an IP injection of EdU (10 \u03bcl of 10mg/ml stock) 3 hours before sacrifice and Click-It chemistry was used for detection as previously described ( Wan & Goldman, 2017 ). Some fish received an IP injection of BrdU (20 mM) 3 hours before sacrifice which was detected using anti-BrdU immunofluorescence as previously described ( Fausett & Goldman, 2006 ). RNA isolation and PCR Total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen). cDNA synthesis and PCR reactions were performed as previously described ( Fausett, Gumerson, & Goldman, 2008 ;  R. Ramachandran et al., 2010a ). Real-time qPCR reactions were carried out using Green 2x LO-ROX qPCR mix (ASI) on an iCycler real-time PCR detection system (BioRad). The \u0394\u0394Ct method was used to determine relative expression of mRNAs in control and injured retinas and normalized to either  gapdh  or  gapdh  mRNA levels. Individual comparisons were done using unpaired 2-tailed Student t-test. ANOVA with Fisher\u2019s PLSD post hoc analysis was used for multiple parameter comparison. Error bars are standard deviation (SD). s ATACseq and RNAseq ATACseq experiments were performed in triplicate, RNAseq experiments were done in triplicate except comparisons of uninjured and injured retina which were done in duplicate. We used uninjured  gfap:GFP  and  1016 tuba1a:GFP  transgenic fish at 2 days post injury (dpi) to investigate injury-dependent changes in MG. We used uninjured  gfap:GFP  fish treated with DMSO or DAPT for 24 hours, or  gfap:GFP  and  gfap:GFPgfap:GFP;hsp70:DN-MAML  fish treated with heat shock once every 6 hours over a 24 hour period to investigate Notch-dependent changes in MG. Fish were a mix of males and females. GFP+ MG dissociated from dissected fish retinas were FACS purified as previously described ( Powell et al., 2013 ;  R. Ramachandran et al., 2010a ). Retinas were injured with 10 needle poke injuries and 12 injured  1016 tuba1a:GFP  retinas yielded ~70,000 GFP+ cells. Two retinas from uninjured  gfap:GFP  fish yielded ~225,000 GFP+ cells. For ATACseq nuclei were isolated from GFP+ cells; transposase treatment and PCR amplification were as previously described ( Buenrostro, Wu, Chang, & Greenleaf, 2015 ). For RNAseq, RNA was purified from GFP+ cells and RNA quality and quantity analyzed on a Bioanalyzer (Agilent). RNA rin numbers were above 8. polyA RNA was used prepare cDNA libraries that were generated by the U of M\u2019s Advance Genomics Core and DNA was sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform. Sequencing reads were analyzed by the University of Michigan\u2019s Bioinformatics Core. Reads were mapped to the zebrafish genome (GRZc11). The number of reads for each expressed gene was determined and differentially expressed genes were restricted to those exhibiting at least a 1.5-fold difference in expression with threshold abundance greater than 5 Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads to eliminate very low abundant transcripts whose estimates of fold-change are unreliable. For each sample used in ATACseq experiments we obtained >25 million reads with alignment rates between 80\u201389%. Total peaks called were >125,000. Transcription site enrichment scores ranged from 7.2\u20139.9. Fraction of reads in peaks were >0.2. For RNAseq experiments each sample yielded >30 million reads with alignment rates of 80\u201385%. Differentially expressed genes had an adjusted P value \u2264 0.05, FDR \u2264 0.05, and a fold change \u2265 \u00b1 1.5. Bulk RNA-seq data analysis of MG and nonMG MG RNAseq data generated from  gfap:GFP  transgenic fish treated +/\u2212 NMDA or intense light were obtained from  Hoang et al., 2020 . The original raw sequencing reads were processed by the authors as described ( Hoang et al., 2020 ). Briefly, RNAseq libraries were prepared from FACS purified GFP+ MG and GFP- nonMG with a result of 45 to 55 million reads per library. Each condition contained two biological replicates, and FPKM were calculated using raw counts. Using this dataset, we identified genes of interest and the corresponding FPKM across samples were averaged and formulated into heat maps using R for visualization. scRNAseq data analysis of control and NMDA-treated retinas Retinal scRNAseq data from control and NMDA damaged fish retinas were obtained from  Hoang et al., 2020 . Briefly, the authors used Cell Ranger from 10x Genomics to map zebrafish reads from scRNAseq to the genome with an average of 1000 to 1500 genes and 2500 to 3250 unique molecular identifiers per cell. Variable genes were identified and clustered with K-nearest neighbors and shared nearest neighbor modularity optimization through Seurat. Doublets were eliminated with an in-house algorithm, and marker genes were used to annotate cell types for each cell cluster identified. Using this dataset, we identified the scaled and normalized average expression of our genes of interest across cell clusters, and the percentage of cells per cluster expressing these genes were calculated using R. Dot plots were created using Seurat for visualization. CRISPR-based gene editing Gene editing was performed as previously described ( Hwang et al., 2013 ;  Vejnar, Moreno-Mateos, Cifuentes, Bazzini, & Giraldez, 2016 ). Briefly, we used CRISPRscan to identify 3\u20136 gRNAs that target the gene of interest ( Moreno-Mateos et al., 2015 ). gRNA DNA template synthesis using gRNA primer, universal primer, and  in vitro  transcription are as previously described ( Vejnar et al., 2016 ). gRNAs are tested for editing efficiency by injecting single cell embryos with  in vitro  transcribed gRNA, along with Cas9-nanos RNA; 2\u20134 days later, editing efficiency is determined using genomic DNA in T7 endonuclease 1 (T7E1) mismatch detection assays and PCR ( Sentmanat, Peters, Florian, Connelly, & Pruett-Miller, 2018 ). For stable gene editing in transgenic fish, we generated  Ubi:Cas9;cmlc2:GFP  ( Ubi:Cas9 ) transgenic fish using standard recombinant DNA protocols and Tol2 vectors. We also generated Tol2 vectors harboring two gRNAs targeting a single gene under the control of two  u6a  promoters as previously described ( Yin et al., 2015 ). We chose to express 2 gRNAs for each gene to improve editing efficiency and generate large deletions. Stable transgenic lines were established as previously described and are referred to as  u6:gene-gRNA  ( 1,2 Fausett & Goldman, 2006 ). For gene editing in transgenic lines,  Ubi:Cas9  fish and  u6:gene-gRNA  were bred to each other and  1,2 Ubi:Cas9;u6:gene-gRNA  fish (F1 generation) were used for gene editing experiments. Gene editing in transgenic fish was confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing. For gene editing in F0 fish, we injected zebrafish embryos with previously validated  1,2 in vitro  transcribed gRNAs 1,2  and  Cas9-nanos  mRNA. Embryos were raised to adults and genomic DNA from fin clips was used in T7E1 mismatch detection assay and PCR to confirm gene editing ( Sentmanat et al., 2018 ). We obtained similar results regardless of whether genomic DNA was isolated from retina or fin clips. MOs, gRNAs, and qPCR Primers used in this study All MOs, gRNAs, and primers used in this study are listed in  Table Supplement 7 . Morpholino (MO) functional assays MOs were obtained from Gene Tools, LLC and the sequences are listed in  Table Supplement 7 . All MOs have a lissamine tag. Unless otherwise stated, MOs were used at 1 mM concentration. For testing splice blocking  dll4 -and  hey1 -targeting MO, we injected either control MO or experimental MO (~1ng) into single cell zebrafish embryos. RNA was extracted from embryos at 24\u201348hrs post injection and assayed for  dll4  or  hey1  mRNA by PCR. For testing  dlb -,  n3 -, and  id2b -targeting MOs, we generated  pCS2+dlb-EGFP ,  pCS2+n3-EGFP  and  pCS2+id2b-EGFP  constructs that contained either  dlb ,  n3 , or  id2b  MO target site upstream of the EGFP initiator AUG. Plasmids were linearized with Not1 restriction enzyme and capped sense RNA was synthesized using SP6 RNA polymerase using Invitrogen\u2019s mMESSAGE mMACHINE\u2122 SP6 Transcription Kit (Invitrogen, #AM1340) according to manufactures directions. Following purification, the capped RNA was dissolved in nuclease free water containing 0.2% phenol red and injected with experimental or control MO into single cell zebrafish embryos. Each embryo received approximately 50 pg of RNA and 250 pg of control or experimental MO. MO\u2019s were delivered to adult fish via intravitreal injection at the time of retinal injury and cellular uptake was facilitated by electroporation as previously described ( Fausett et al., 2008 ). Luciferase assay A 3kb region upstream of the  hey1  gene\u2019s transcription start site was amplified by PCR and cloned into Xho1/Kpn1 sites of the  pXP1  plasmid to create  3kb-hey1:luciferase . Using Q5\u00ae Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (NEB, E0554), we generated mutations in each of the two most highly conserved Rbpj binding sites (m1 and m2,  Fig. 7a ). Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. To study  hey1  promoter activity, we transfected HEK 293T cells plated in 24 well tissue culture plates with wt and mutant  3kb-hey1:luciferase , +/\u2212 CMV:NICD and  SV40:Renilla  as internal control using lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen). Two days after transfection, cells were washed with PBS, lysed, and luciferase and Renilla activities measured using a Luminometer (Turner Biosystems). Luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla activity. Heat shock and pharmacological inhibitors For heat shock, fish were immersed in a water bath at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr before returning to system water at 28\u00b0C. For extended periods of heat shock, this was repeated every 6 hrs. To inhibit Notch signaling we used DAPT (Cayman, Cat # 13197) prepared in DMSO as a 10mM stock and diluted 1/250 in fish water for immersion. Control fish were treated with vehicle. Fish were exposed to DAPT for 24 hours. Immunofluorescence and TUNEL assay Zebrafish samples were prepared for immunofluorescence as previously described ( Fausett & Goldman, 2006 ;  R. Ramachandran et al., 2010a ;  R. Ramachandran, Reifler, A., Parent, J.M and Goldman, D., 2010 ). Primary antibodies used in this study: Rabbit anti-GFP, Thermo Fisher, Cat. # A6455 (1/1000); Mouse anti-mCherry, Abcam, Cat. # ab125096 (1:500); and mouse anti-glutamine synthetase (GS), Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. #MAB302 (1/500). Secondary antibodies used were: Alexa Flour 555 Donkey anti Mouse-IgG (H+L), Thermo Fisher Cat. #  A31570  (1:500); Alexa flour 555 Donkey anti Rabbit IgG (H+L), Thermo Fisher, Cat # A31572 (1:500); Alexa Flour 488 donkey anti mouse Thermo Fisher Cat. # A21202 (1:500); Alexa Flour 488 goat anti rabbit Thermo Fisher Cat. # A11008 (1:500). We used an  in situ  Cell Death Fluorescein Kit (Millipore Sigma, Cat. # 11684795910) to detect apoptotic cells. Microscopy and cell quantification Images were captured by a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope or a Leica DM2500 microscope. EdU and BrdU labelling were used to identify and quantify proliferating cells in retinal sections as previously described ( Fausett & Goldman, 2006 ;  R. Ramachandran et al., 2010a ;  Wan & Goldman, 2017 ;  Wan et al., 2012 ;  Wan et al., 2014 ). The width of the proliferative zone was quantified at the center of the injury site where the largest number of proliferating cells reside. Statistical analysis Unless otherwise indicated, sample size is 3 fish and experiments were repeated at least 3 times. Statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism. Error bars are standard deviation (SD). Two-tailed Student\u2019s  t  test was used for single parameter comparison; all measurements were taken from distinct samples.
