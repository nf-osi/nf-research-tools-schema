  "abstract": "Optic glioma, a slow-growing tumor, is associated with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) mutations and increased midkine (MDK) production. A connection between asthma and optic glioma has previously been observed, but the mechanisms are unclear. To elucidate the role of asthma in the regulation of glioma formation, we investigated the role of T cells and the subsequent pathways in the regulation of microglia, a key player in the glioma tumor microenvironment (TME). While asthma is often linked to chronic inflammation, our mathematical analysis and experimental evidence suggest that inflammation can play a key role in suppressing the proliferation of optic glioma cells via immune reprogramming of T cells and the delicate control of signaling networks in microglia. Our mathematical model unveils the complex interactions between tumor and immune cells in optic glioma. Our results indicate that asthma-induced T cell reprogramming inhibits tumor growth by promoting the release of decorin and a subsequent suppression of CCR8 and the intercellular binding kinetics in microglia, followed by blocking of CCL5 production in TME via suppression of NFκB. We developed anti-cancer strategies by leveraging this asthma-induced immune regulation.",
