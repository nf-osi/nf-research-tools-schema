  "methods": "Methods Experimental model and subject details Human subjects Annotated surgical samples were obtained from non-consecutive patients (n = 15) that underwent surgery by authors HNM and PC between 2014 – 2022 ( clinicaltrials.gov  identifier  NCT00060541 ) ( Sup. Table S1 ). The study was conducted at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD and approved by the Combined Neuroscience Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Bethesda, MD. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient for research study participation, and the study was conducted according to the standards set by the IRB. All patients underwent a suboccipital retro-sigmoid approach for microscope-assisted tumor resection. Vestibular schwannomas were removed in piecemeal fashion and sent for histopathological examination following formalin fixation and paraffin embedding (FFPE). Research specimens were flash frozen for  in-vitro  assays. Animal subjects Periostin-CRE mice were provided by S. Conway (Indiana University) and as previously described , mice were crossed with NF2 7 fl/fl  mice (RIKEN Bioresource Research Centre) to generate Periostin-CRE;NF2 fl/fl  mice. Age-matched CRE-littermates were used as experimental controls. All experiments included male and female animals in approximately equal numbers. Mice were housed in specific pathogen-free conditions and fed  ad lib  with standard rodent diet and water. Mice were kept no longer than 9 months to avoid substantial mortality observed in NF2 fl/fl  mice after this time point. 5-month-old mice were treated with vehicle control or 30mg/kg of TEAD auto-palmitoylation inhibitor (VT3989, Vivace Therapeutics, San Mateo, CA) for 21 days by oral gavage. Mice were killed using carbon dioxide and cervical dislocation. Tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and dorsal root ganglia were dissected for further analysis. Animal experiments were approved by the Plymouth University Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Board, and conformed to UK Home Office regulations under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 following ARRIVE guidelines. Method details Key resources table: Sup. Table S10 . Single cell RNA sequencing Tumor samples were stored and transported in 0.9% NaCl or RPMI 1640 on ice. Samples were chopped into ~2–4mm 3  sized pieces and dissociated using the Human Tumor Dissociation Kit in gentleMACS C tubes using the gentleMACS dissociator (Bergisch Gladbach, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany). Samples were briefly centrifuged at 300 rpm for 30 seconds and filtered through a 70-nm strainer. The single cell suspensions were washed with 10 mL RPMI 1640 and re-centrifuged at 2100 rpm for 5 minutes at 4°C. Single-cell suspensions then underwent red blood cell (RBC) lysis using the RBC Lysis Solution 10X (Bergisch Gladbach, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany). Non-viable cells were removed using a Dead Cell Removal Kit (Bergisch Gladbach, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany). Single cell suspension quality, number and viability were assessed with a dual fluorescence cell counter Luna-FL (Logos Biosystems, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea). A total of 8,000–10,000 cells from each tumor cell suspension were washed twice with PBS+0.04% BSA and resuspended to a final concentration of 1000 cells per mL. 10X Genomics’ Chromium instrument and Single Cell 3′ Reagent kit (V3 and 3.1) were used to prepare individually barcoded scRNAseq libraries following the manufacturer’s protocol. Library quality was assessed by BioAnalyzer traces (Agilent BioAnalyzer High Sensitivity Kit) and quantified using the Qubit system. Sequencing was performed on the Illumina NextSeq machine, using the 150-cycle High Output kit with 28 bp read 1, 8 bp sample index, and 91 bp read 2. Following sequencing, bcl files were demultiplexed into FASTQ, aligned to human transcriptome GRCh38, and single-cell 3′ gene counting was performed using the standard 10X Genomics’s CellRanger mkfastq software (V3.0.2). Single nuclei multiome sequencing Nuclei were isolated from frozen tissues using an adaptation of a previously established protocol . Samples were washed with 800uL of Detergent-Lysis Buffer (0.1% Triton-X). Tissues were chopped into small pieces, homogenized in a 7mL Dounce Homogenizer (Fisher Scientific # 501945204) on ice, and passed through a 70 mm MACS strainer (Miltenyi Biotech #130-098-462). Nuclei were spun down at 3200 xg for 5 minutes at 4°C and processed using the Chromium nuclei isolation kit (10x Genomics #1000494). Briefly, nuclei were resuspended in 1mL of low sucrose buffer, and gently layered above 4 mL of high sucrose buffer taking care not to disrupt the density gradient. The gradient was spun down at 3200 xg for 20 minutes at 4°C, then resuspended in Nuclei Resuspension Buffer. Aliquots of resuspended nuclei were stained with Acridine Orange dye (Logos Biosystems #  65 F23001 ) and counted using an automated fluorescence cell counter (Logos Biosystems #  L20001 ). Nuclei were immediately processed using a Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression Assay (10X Genomics, # 1000285) following manufacturer recommendations. Nuclei were loaded onto a Next GEM Chip J (10X Genomics # 1000230), targeting a yield of 3,000 nuclei. Library preparation was performed according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Libraries were pooled and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 machine using a pair of High-Output Reagent Kits v2.5 with 150 cycles (Illumina # 20024907). Sequencing reads were demultiplexed and aligned to the hg38 reference genome using the 10X Genomics Cell Ranger software (arc v2.0.1) mkfastq function with default settings, and counts were generated using the Cell Ranger-arc count function. Single cell/nuclei RNA and multiome analysis Filtered and raw .h5 files from Cell Ranger were processed in RStudio using Seurat v5.0.1.  Cell Free RNA contamination and doublets was estimated and removed using the SoupX 66  and DoubletFinder 67  R packages. For quality control, nuclei and cells exhibiting high mitochondrial RNA content (>25%), low transcript complexity (fewer than 300 detected genes; nFeature_RNA < 300), or low total read counts (nCount_RNA < 500) were excluded, yielding 77,930 nuclei and 15,500 cells after filtering. The data was log normalized using NormalizeData(), and variable features were identified using FindVariableFeatures(). The data was scaled using ScaleData() before principal component analysis using RunPCA(). Single-nuclei samples underwent marker-based classification using scSorter 68 , referencing Schwann cells and associated schwannoma microenvironment canonical cell markers. Cell-based classification was validated by manually comparing predictions from scSorter with clusters identified by uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) and unsupervised clustering functions: RunUMAP(dims=1:30), FindNeighbors(dims = 1:30), FindClusters(resolution = 0.5). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified for each cell class using the Seurat FindAllMarkers() function with the default settings (Log2-fold change >0.25, and gene must be expressed in >25% of cells in that cluster). S and G2M cell cycle phase scores were determined using the CellCycleScoring() function in Seurat. 69 Copy number variants (CNVs) were first identified using the R-packages InferCNV  with endothelial cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and pericytes marked as reference cells. In parallel, CONICSmat 70  was used to produce UMAP plots that describe inferred chromosomal expression. Chromosome 22q loss was determined using the inflection point of the chromosome 22q expression density plot in samples that had adequate loss in Schwann cells as visualized using the FeaturePlot() function (n= 7). ‘The common upregulated genes among the single-nucleus samples (n=6) of the cells denoted as having a loss in the 22q chromosome with an average fold change of greater than 0 and an adjusted p-value less than 0.05 were used to create a merlin depletion score (MDS) using the tl.rank_genes_groups() function in Scanpy. 71  MDS class was determined for Schwann cells based merlin depletion score quartiles: +σ > 2σ > −σ as merlin-depleted (Schwann 72 mer− ), merlin-intermediate (Schwann mer+/− ), and merlin-intact (Schwann mer+ ). Similar module scoring was done using DEGs from NF2-depleted cell-lines for validation and for genes involved in the hippo pathway. For additional validation, normal Schwann cells were sourced from 2 Normal spinal cord public datasets ( GSE190444 , n = 8 from 7 donors;  GSE243077 , n = 9)  and one normal auricular nerve dataset ( 32 , 33 GSE230375 , n = 2)  on NCBI-GEO. All samples were preprocessed using the same pipeline described above. Normal Schwann cells (n = 2,395) were then combined with VS tumors’ Schwann cells, and the merlin depletion score was recalculated. 18 Individual datasets were integrated using the CCA integration method from the Seurat v4  R-package integration workflow to remove batch effects while preserving biological variation. Integration anchors were found using FindIntegationAnchors() with the number of dimensions set to 30, and each sample’s gene expression matrix was integrated into one object via IntegrateData(). Integrated objects were scaled, run through a PCA analysis, and clustered through Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). The Schwann cells and macrophages were isolated from the integrated object and were processed through the standard Seurat pipeline. Unsupervised clustering of each subset of the integrated object were manually labelled after cross-referencing with existing literature using the FindAllMarkers() function and based on gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using the clusterProfiler 73  R-package and GSEApy 74  python package. Cell-cell communication networks were identified using the CellChat 75  R package. 76 snRNAseq data was visualized using the Scanpy python package. To assess sample-level transcriptomic similarity of cell types between VS nf2  and VS spo , cosine similarity distances between all sample–cell type pairs were computed using the tools.Distance() function in Pertpy.  A Mann–Whitney U test was then applied to evaluate differences in transcriptomic similarity within versus between VS 77 nf2  and VS spo  samples across cell types. For RNA velocity and lineage tracing analysis, the python package scvelo  was used to calculate RNA velocities using the unfiltered expression matrix from 10x Cell Ranger software, and ratios of spliced to unspliced mRNA calculated from velocyto. 78  The CellRank 44  python package was used to compute a transition matrix, initial and terminal states, cell lineage fate probabilities, and lineage specific gene drivers. Partition-based graph abstraction (PAGA) 45  was used to infer directional graph based on RNA velocity. 79 To assess global chromatin accessibility, the ATACseq reads and fragments for each sample were integrated together and preprocessed for quality control using ArchR  with peaks identified using MAC2 80  for 36,129 cells. The ATAC ArchR project was subset for Schwann cells and BigWig files were generated for each MDS class. Using deepTools 81 , the count matrices of peaks identified by MACS2 and gene regions (TSS-1000bp to TES+1000bp) were computed for each BigWig files and were visualized using plotHeatmap(). pyCirclize 82  was used to plot the relative fragment coverage for Schwann 83 mer− , and Schwann mer+  across the entire genome (bin size = 2.5 million base pairs) and Wilcoxon test was used to determine statistical significance. Individual gene coverage plot was generated using a custom python function. For transcription factor activity, preprocessed chromatin accessibility profiles from ArchR were analyzed using pycisTopic to perform topic modeling, grouping peaks into co-accessible topics. Peaks were annotated with transcription factor motifs, and per-cell topic distributions were obtained. For 17,154 cells with matched snATAC-seq and snRNA-seq data, SCENIC+  was used to integrate chromatin accessibility with gene expression, linking accessible motif-enriched peaks to nearby genes. Gene regulatory networks were constructed and refined by motif enrichment, peak accessibility, and correlation with target gene expression. Motif enrichment was performed using the hg38 cisTarget databases (hg38_screen_v10_clust) together with motif-to-gene annotations (motifs-v10nr_clust-nr.hgnc). Finally, gene regulon activity was quantified in each cell using enrichment-based scoring, yielding cell-level transcription factor activity profiles. SCENIC+ was also used to visualize the top five transcription factors in each stromal cell type and Schwann MDS class. Selected transcription factor activities in Schwann cells were further scaled and smoothed across the merlin depletion score using pyGAM 48 . 84 Perturbation analysis was performed using SCENIC+ to evaluate the regulatory influence of TEAD1. The perturbation was simulated by setting TEAD1 activity to 0, and propagating the effect through the inferred regulatory network over five iterations. Significant changes in gene expression and MDS before and after perturbation were assessed using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIPseq) Surgical tissues were fragmented into 2–4 mm 3  pieces and cross linked using 1% paraformaldehyde (Sigma #F8775) for 10 minutes, followed by glycine quench for 5 minutes at room temperature. ChIP was performed using an EZ-Magna ChIP kit (Millipore Sigma #17–10086) following manufacturer’s instructions. Sonication was optimized for the tissue type, and fragment sizes ~ 200kb were verified using gel electrophoresis. Sonication was conducted on wet ice using 10 cycles of 10 seconds on, 50 seconds off at 75% power (Qsonica #Q125–110). Immunoprecipitation was performed overnight at 4 °C on a rotating rocker using 10 mL of specific antibodies. After elution and reversal of cross-linking, DNA fragments were purified, and libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq ChIP Library Preparation Kit following manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina # IP-202–1012). Sequencing was performed on an Illumina NextSeq machine using the NextSeq 500/550 Mid Output Kit v2.5 with 150 Cycles (Illumina # 20024904). Data was analyzed using the Galaxy ChIP-seq pipeline. Briefly, raw QC reads were filtered using adapter trimming program Trimmomatic, followed by alignment using BWA. Next, normalized bigwig files were created and scaled using BEDTools.  DeepTools was used to generate gene-body meta-profiles from bigWig files and to calculate genome-wide IP enrichment. Peaks were annotated relative to gene features using MACS2. MACS2 peaks were further analyzed in R using ChIPseeker 85  and GenomicRanges. 86 87 DNA methylation Tissue sections (5 μm) were cut from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded surgically derived vestibular schwannoma specimens. DNA was isolated and purified (Qiagen DNeasy #69556). After sodium bisulfite conversion using the Zymogen EZ DNA Methylation kit (#D5001), 1ug each of methylated and unmethylated DNA was analyzed using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC chip (#20087706). Samples were randomly assigned to plates. Signal intensities were retrieved and poorly performing probes were removed (P value > 0.01 for > 1% CpGs, ch probes, normal rs probes, CpGs on sex chromosomes, SNP probes, cross-reactive probes, invariable probes). Data was processed and analyzed using the MissMethyl R package.  Beta values were calculated for each probe and adjusted for cell type composition. Probes associated with genes of interest were identified and compared across samples. P values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using false discovery rate analysis with Benjamini-Hockberg statistics. Cluster Heatmap and UMAP visualizing beta values for bulk DNA methylation of CNS tumors were created using standard Python packages. 88 Germline genotyping Germline genetic testing was performed by whole genome sequencing (WGS) of peripheral blood mononuclear cell pellets in NF2 patients. Briefly, DNA was extracted using the Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA extraction kit (Catalog no: 80204, Qiagen, USA) and quantified on the Qubit 4 fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA). Genomic DNA (500 ng) was used to construct sequencing-ready libraries with the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (E7645) and NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina (E7395) (New England Biolabs, USA). Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq X instrument (Illumina, USA) and resulting FASTQ files were processed using the NF-core Sarek pipeline to call single nucleotide and copy number variants.  Variant annotation was performed using ANNOVAR (version 2020-06-08) and snpEff (version 5.2). 89  High impact loss-of-function variants affecting coding and splice site regions of the canonical NF2 RefSeq transcript ( 90 , 91 NM_000268.4 ) were retained for further analysis and classified according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and Association for Molecular Pathology guidelines. 92 Multiplex immunohistochemistry Multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) was performed on 5 μm-thick paraffin-embedded sections. Sections were deparaffinized and treated using a standard antigen unmasking step in 10 mM Tris/EDTA buffer pH 9.0. Sections were then blocked with Human BD Fc Blocking solution (BD Biosciences #564219) and treated with TrueBlack Reagent (Biotium #23014-T) to quench intrinsic tissue autofluorescence. The sections were then immunoreacted for 1 hour at RT using 1 μg/ml cocktail mixture of immuno-compatible antibodies. Primary antibodies were either directly conjugated or indirectly labelled with secondary antibodies using the following spectrally compatible fluorophores: Alexa Fluor 430, Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 546, Alexa Fluor 594, Alexa Fluor 647, IRDye 800CW. After washing off excess antibodies, sections were counterstained using 1 μg/ml DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific #D1306) for visualization of cell nuclei. Slides were then mounted using Immu-Mount medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific #FIS9990402) and imaged using an Axio Imager.Z2 slide scanning epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a 20X/0.8 Plan-Apochromat (Phase-2) non-immersion objective (Zeiss), a high-resolution ORCA-Flash4.0 sCMOS digital camera (Hamamatsu), a 200W X-Cite 200DC broad band lamp source (Excelitas Technologies), and 7 customized filter sets (Semrock). Image tiles (600 × 600 μm viewing area) were individually captured at 0.325 micron/pixel spatial resolution, and tiles were seamlessly stitched into whole specimen images using the ZEN 2 image acquisition and analysis software program (Zeiss). Pseudocolored stitched images were exported to Adobe Photoshop and overlaid as individual layers to create multicolored merged composites. For quantitative analysis, raw TIFF images from mIHC were downsampled using the Lempel–Ziv–Welch lossless compression algorithm. Nuclear segmentation was performed in QuPath  using the Cell Detection module on the DAPI channel (Background radius = 0; Median filter radius = 0; Sigma = 3; Minimum area = 10 px; Maximum area = 1000 px; Threshold = 5; Cell expansion = 20). A total of 2,721,272 cells were identified across all tumor samples. Random Forest classifiers were trained to determine marker positivity and annotate cells. Anndata objects were constructed from exported measurements, and the Leiden algorithm was applied to cluster marker-positive cells into cell types. VEGFA 93 +  cells were defined by thresholding at the mean expression value. To investigate how hypoxic stress may lead to angiogenesis, vessels were annotated by creating spatial clusters of endothelial cells using DBSCAN , computing convex hull of cluster, and then thresholding the circularity of this structure to ensure all vessels used for analysis were of regular and comparable shapes (circularity >= 0.7). Normalized distances between Schwann VEGFA + cells and Vessels were then calculated relative to the mean intercellular distance within each sample. 94 RNAscope in situ hybridization mRNA was visualized using RNAscope  in situ  hybridization (ACDBio, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions . Briefly, probes were warmed for 10 minutes at 40°C in a water bath, then cooled to room temperature. Probes C2, C3 and C1 were mixed in a 1:1:50 ratio. 5 μm-thick paraffin-embedded tumor sections were deparaffinized and placed in HybEZ Slide Racks. Probes were hybridized to target mRNAs by incubating probe mixtures in a HybEZ oven using a HybEZ Humidity Control Tray for 2 hours at 40 °C. Slides were washed twice for 2 minutes at room temperature using 1X Wash Buffer. Slides were sequentially incubated in AMP 1-FL for 30 minutes at 40 °C using the HybEZ oven, AMP 2-FL for 15 minutes at 40 °C, AMP 3-FL for 30 minutes at 40 °C, and AMP 4-FL for 15 minutes at 40 °C, with two 1X Wash Buffer washes between incubation steps. Slides were counterstained with DAPI for 30 seconds at room temperature, then mounted using fluorescent mounting medium. 95 Slides were imaged using an Axio Imager.Z2 slide scanning epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a 20X/0.8 Plan-Apochromat (Phase-2) non-immersion objective (Zeiss), a high-resolution ORCA-Flash4.0 sCMOS digital camera (Hamamatsu), a 200W X-Cite 200DC broad band lamp source (Excelitas Technologies), and customized filter sets (Semrock). Image tiles (600 × 600 μm viewing area) were individually captured at 0.325 micron/pixel spatial resolution, and tiles seamlessly stitched into whole specimen images using the ZEN 2 image acquisition and analysis software program (Zeiss). Pseudocolored stitched images were then exported to Adobe Photoshop and overlaid as individual layers to create multicolored merged composites. For quantification, image analysis was performed as described for mIHC. Raw TIFF files were downsampled using the Lempel–Ziv–Welch compression algorithm, and nuclear segmentation was performed in QuPath (Cell Detection parameters as above). A total of 39,699 cells were identified across all tumor samples. Random Forest classifiers were trained to determine marker positivity and annotate cells. Anndata objects were generated from exported data, and the Leiden algorithm was used to cluster marker-positive cells into cell types. VEGFA +  cells were defined by thresholding at the mean expression value. Western immunoblotting Tissue samples were washed with ice-cold PBS and whole-cell lysates were collected on ice using a radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer (Thermo Scientific #89900) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Halt protease inhibitor, Sigma-Aldrich #539137). Whole-cell lysates were quantified using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Thermo Scientific #23227). Proteins were electrophoretically separated on 4%–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen #NP0321BOX) and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes with the Trans-Blot Transfer Turbo System (Bio-Rad). After blocking membranes for 1 hour in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 0.05% TBS-Tween at room temperature, they were incubated overnight at 4° C with primary antibodies. Membranes were washed with TBS-Tween and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature while rocking. Membranes were developed with ECL (Super Signal West Pico PLUS, Thermo Fisher #34579). Immunoreactive signal was detected and imaged using the ChemiDoc MP Imaging System (Bio-Rad). Xenium Spatial Transcriptomic Analysis Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections were processed for spatial transcriptomic profiling using the Xenium In Situ Analyzer (10x Genomics) following the manufacturer’s FFPE Cell Segmentation workflow with minor optimizations to incubation times and reagent preparation. FFPE sections (10 μm) were mounted onto Xenium slides and baked at 60 °C for 2 hours to ensure adhesion and complete paraffin softening. Sections were deparaffinized through serial xylene and graded ethanol washes, followed by rehydration in 70% ethanol and water. After equilibration at room temperature, slides were assembled into Xenium cassettes. Tissue decrosslinking was performed in Xenium FFPE Tissue Enhancer containing 8 M urea and diluted Perm Enzyme B at 37 °C for 40 min on a Bio-Rad C1000 Touch Thermocycler. Following three 1-min washes in PBS + 0.05% Tween-20 (PBST), custom probes corresponding to a 300-gene panel were resuspended in TE buffer and combined with Xenium Probe Hybridization Buffer and additional TE to prepare the hybridization mix. Probe mix was briefly heated to 95 °C for 2 min to equilibrate, cooled on ice, and then added to each cassette for hybridization at room temperature for 16–18 hours on a thermomixer. Post-hybridization washes, ligation, and rolling-circle amplification were performed sequentially using the manufacturer’s reagents (Modules A and B) and thermocycler programs, with intermediate PBST washes between each step. Amplified products were fixed and blocked in Xenium Block & Stain Buffer before incubation with the Multi-Tissue Stain mixture for nuclear segmentation, which proceeded overnight at 4 °C. Slides were treated with Xenium Stain Enhancer and Autofluorescence Reduction reagents in subdued light, followed by a graded ethanol dehydration and rehydration series. Tissues were equilibrated in PBST, stained with Xenium Nuclei Stain Buffer, and prepared for instrument loading. Two slides were run simultaneously on the Xenium Analyzer following the manufacturer’s automated imaging and chemistry protocol. Four reagent bottles (nuclease-free water, Buffers A and B, and Probe Removal Buffer containing DMSO, KCl, and Tween-20) were loaded along with fresh Modules A and B and standard Xenium consumables. Image acquisition and transcript decoding were performed automatically by the Xenium Analyzer software. After completion of the run, slides were removed, rinsed in PBST, and stored at 4 °C in the dark for subsequent H&E staining. Raw Xenium output files were exported for downstream analysis. The raw Xenium output files for eight vestibular schwannoma (VS) samples were preprocessed, filtered for quality control (minimum of 10 counts per cell, retaining 1,219,325 cells after filtering), and integrated using Scanpy and the SpatialData  packages in Python. Cell type, sub-classes, and MDS class were classified through annotation transfer from the integrated single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing datasets using TACCO. 96 40 To explore NF2 transcript sub-cellular localization, cellular and nuclear boundaries were delineated with the Xenium Multi-Tissue Stain Mix. Spatial transcript localization and quantification were performed in Python using GeoPandas and Shapely to assign transcript coordinates to segmented cells based on sub-cellular spatial localization. Fisher’s exact test was used to determine nuclear or cytosolic enrichment of NF2 transcripts in Schwann MDS class and stromal cells. Neighborhood enrichment scores were computed across the integrated object using Squidpy  to examine inter-cellular interaction in VS. These interactions were further explored by identifying spatial niches with CellCharter 30  based on the scVI 43  latent space and Squidpy-derived spatial neighborhood graph across the integrated object. The optimal number of niches was determined by cluster stability analysis, and CellCharter was further applied to quantify cell type and subclass enrichment within each niche. 97 To continue to investigate how hypoxic stress may lead to angiogenesis, DBSCAN clustering was used to define Schwann Hypoxic Regions (spatial clusters of hypoxic Schwann cells) and Vessel (spatial clusters of endothelial cells). The centroids of Schwann Hypoxic Regions and Vessel were correlated (Pearson’s r) and normalized distances between Schwann Hypoxic cells and Vessels were calculated relative to the mean intercellular distance within each sample. All visualizations were generated using Scanpy, Squidpy, Seaborn  and Matplotlib. 98 Quantification and statistical analysis Statistical details of experiments have been included in the figure legends. Comparative analysis was performed using paired or unpaired T tests after testing for variance equality, and using Welch’s approximation for degrees of freedom, or using one/two-way ANOVAs where appropriate. P values < 0.05 two-tailed were considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, California), or appropriate python packages. Primary Cell Culture Clinical tissue samples were collected aseptically after surgery in cold DPBS. The tissue was minced into small pieces using a sterile scalpel and suspended in cold DPBS. Contaminated blood was removed by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 minutes under cold conditions. The tissue samples were then resuspended in 1 ml of a Trypsin-EDTA and Collagenase solution (1:1 mixture of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA and 0.2% Collagenase) and incubated for 30 minutes in a CO 2  incubator at 37°C. To neutralize the effect of Trypsin, 5 ml of complete medium was added, followed by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 minutes. After carefully removing the supernatant, the digested tissues were suspended in complete medium and plated onto Petri dishes and left undisturbed for 3–5 days in a CO 2  incubator at 37°C. Cells were cultured in Schwann media in presence of 10% FBS and used for experiments after 2–3 passages. We derived primary cells from patient of NF2 schwannoma - S2290, NF2 meningioma – S2348, Sporadic vestibular NF2 schwannoma - S2470. The normal Schwann cells were bought from Neuromics Inc, and all the primary cells were cultured in Schwann growth medium (SGM001). Cell Viability Assays Cultured cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 10,000 cells/well and allowed to grow for 16 hours prior to treatment. Cells were then treated with increasing concentrations (0.06 μM, 0.124 μM, 0.25μM, 0.5 μM, 1 μM, 2 μM, 4μM) of compounds #1, 2, 3, and 4 for 24, 48, and 72 hours before the viability assay. Cell viability was measured using the CellTiter-Glo kit (Promega #G7571) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After a 30-minute incubation at room temperature, luminescence intensity was recorded using a Synergy Neo2 microplate reader (BioTek). Co-immunoprecipitation (IP) Confluent cells (treated or untreaded) were harvested using 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA (Gibco #25200–056) and rinsed with ice cold PBS. Cell pellet from each plate (10 cm) was treated with 0.5 ml ice-cold 1X cell lysis (Cell signaling #9803) and incubated on ice for 10 min with mild vertexing in between. centrifuged for 10 min at 4°C, 14,000 × g and the supernatant were collected to a new tube. The protein was estimated using standard BCA method and stored at −800°C for further use of WB or CoIP. Following the Cell signaling Immunoprecipitation protocol Pan-TEAD Primary antibody (#13295) at a dilution of 1:100 was allowed to bind overnight with rotation to form the immunocomplex. The immunocomplex was allowed to bind further with equilibrated magnetic beads (#73778) for one hr at room temperature with rotation followed by five times wash with 500 μl of 1X cell lysis buffer. Pan-TEAD protein or complex was eluted with 3X SDS sample buffer after heating the sample at 95–100°C for 5 min. Samples were analyzed by western blot Western Blot Analysis Cell lysates containing 20 μg of protein were used for sample preparation. Proteins were electrophoretically separated on 4%–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen #NP0321BOX) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes using the Trans-Blot Transfer Turbo System (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked for 1 hour at room temperature in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) prepared in 0.05% TBS-Tween. Following blocking, membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies. After incubation, membranes were washed with TBS-Tween and then incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature with gentle rocking. Protein bands were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent (SuperSignal West Pico PLUS, Thermo Fisher #34579). Immunoreactive signals were visualized and imaged using the ChemiDoc MP Imaging System (Bio-Rad). The antibodies used in this study were primarily from Cell Signaling Technology, including anti-pan-TEAD (S13295), anti-YAP (4912S), anti-TAZ (83669S), anti-VEGF-A (50661S), anti-rabbit (7074S), and anti-mouse (7076S). Additional antibodies were obtained from other suppliers: Thermo Fisher (anti-MCSF, 21113), Origene (anti-IL34, TA811728), and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (anti-NRG1, sc-393006; anti-Vinculin, sc-59803; anti-GAPDH, sc-47724). For immunoprecipitation (IP) samples, we used the Mouse Anti-Rabbit IgG HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (#5127) to avoid masking caused by denatured IgG heavy chains (~50 kDa).",
  "introduction": "Introduction In mammalian Schwann cells, TEA domain family (TEAD) proteins interact with YAP (Yes-associated protein) and its paralogue, TAZ (Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif) to regulate key homeostatic function including myelination.  The TEAD/YAP-TAZ axis is regulated by merlin 9 – 11 , which is encoded by the  12 , 13 NF2  gene in humans. Schwann cell tumors (schwannomas) in humans can occur at central or peripheral nervous system nerves. Schwannomas occur frequently in association with the vestibular nerves, leading to sensorineural hearing loss, and brainstem compression. In humans, unilateral vestibular schwannomas (VS) occur sporadically (VS spo ) , or bilaterally with neurofibromatosis type 2 syndrome (NF2) – VS 1 nf2 .  VS formation is driven by sub-haploid  2 NF2  gene dosage , typically by biallelic loss. 3 \n 4 , 5 NF2 /merlin, suppresses tumorigenesis via phosphorylation and inactivation of YAP.  In human schwannomas, a near universal loss of merlin is typically mediated either via inactivating mutations, or 22q loss. 14 , 15  Epigenetic regulation of merlin activity or  3 – 5 , 16 NF2  dosing is considered unlikely. While there is some evidence of clonal variation of  NF2  dose within schwannomas , sub-clonal mechanisms likely explain the phenotypic or proliferative variability within tumors – intra-tumoral heterogeneity. 17 6 , 18 Intra-tumoral heterogeneity often underlies the potential for recurrence, and resistance to targeted treatments in human tumors. Although, the exact mechanisms of intra-tumoral heterogeneity in VS remain unknown, heterogeneity is found at transcriptional, protein expression, and cellular proliferative potential levels.  VS 19 – 21 spo , may arise from one or two hits at the NF2 locus , and cellular merlin expression varies significantly even across the same tumor. In patients with NF2, a majority of VS 4 nf2  contain a single second-hit at the  NF2  locus , and some VS 16 , 22 , 23 nf2  may be polyclonal in origin.  We hypothesized that apparent intra-tumoral heterogeneity of Schwann cell transcriptome hides strong signals of cellular selection and fitness that could have a potential in designing targeted therapies for Schwannomas. 24 Here, we analyzed VS spo  and VS nf2  with a multi-omics approach to understand the biological implications of intra-tumoral heterogeneity. We leveraged the wide spectrum of  NF2 /merlin status between  NF2 -intact (non-Schwann cells in VS spo) , -haploid (non-Schwann cells in VS nf2 ), and -lost (tumor driving Schwann cells in VS) to establish a distinct transcriptomic signature of merlin activity. We then found that Schwann cells with the lowest merlin activity drive tumor progression via paracrine, macrophage chemotactic, and angiogenic signaling. We found that transcription factor TEAD1 drives tumorigenic signaling in merlin depleted cells, and that effect that can be reversed by TEAD1 inhibition. We used an emerging TEAD1 inhibitor (VT3989)  to show targeted activity against  8 NF2 -loss Schwann cells in mice , and in human-derived VS tumor cell cultures. 7",
  "results": "Results VS nf2  and VS spo  share common Schwann cell states We performed a multi-omic analysis of VS nf2  (n=10; 8 patients), and VS spo  (n = 6) with overlapping single cell transcriptomic, chromatin accessibility, and spatial studies ( Fig. 1A ). Each sample was associated with detailed phenotypic and genotypic data ( Fig. 1B ;  Sup. Table S1 ). Clustering and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP)  mapping did not reveal sample-specific distribution bias ( 25 Fig. 1C ), allowing us to apply a robust annotation strategy for the single cell (scRNAseq; 15,500 cells) and single nucleus (snRNAseq; 77,930 cells) datasets ( Fig. 1D ;  Sup. Table S2 ). For spatial RNA in-situ hybridization (RNAish; RNAscope, ACDBio, USA; 36,699 cells), multiplexed immunohistochemistry (mIHC; 2,721,272 cells), and high-resolution in-situ hybridization based spatial transcriptomic (stRNAish; Xenium, 10X Genomics, USA; 1,219,325 cells), we applied annotation strategies informed by snRNAseq dataset ( Sup. Figs. S1A  and  S1B ; see  Methods ). To understand the effect of assay preparation on downstream analysis, we performed parallel scRNAseq and snRNAseq in four tumors ( Sup. Fig. S1C ). Single nucleus assays captured the cell class membership ( Sup. Fig. S1D ,  Sup. Table S3 ) with higher accuracy, and were enriched for ribosomal genes ( Sup. Fig. 1E ). However, clustering and cell-classification was unhindered ( Sup. Fig. 1C ), allowing us to integrate datasets for downstream analysis. Following assay validation, we asked if VS nf2  and VS spo  could be driven by divergent mechanisms. For genotyping, we performed germline whole genome sequencing for patients with VS nf2  ( Sup. Table S1 ). The coarse-grained UMAP distribution appeared unbiased ( Sup. Fig. S2A ), with comparable cell class memberships ( Fig. 1E ) across assays. Transcriptomically, Schwann cells from VS nf2  and VS spo  were indistinguishable ( Fig. 1F ,  Sup. Fig. S2B ), however, macrophages and other stromal cells demonstrated variability across the germline genotypes. Patients with NF2 are haploid for NF2/merlin activity, however Schwann cells acquire biallelic  NF2  loss in VS regardless of the germline status. With inferred copy number analysis we found a similar distribution of 22q−/− Schwann cells ( Sup Fig S2A ) in VS nf2 /VS spo , however, we found discrepancies in macrophage population distribution ( Sup Figs S2C , and  S2D ). VS nf2  were enriched for M2-like macrophages  ( 26 Sup. Figs. S2E , and  S2F ), that demonstrated dysregulation of hippo, and cell-adhesion pathways ( Sup Fig S2G ), likely due to their  NF2  haploid status. Next, we analyzed whether epigenomic patterns could distinguish VS nf2  and VS spo . With bulk DNA methylation analysis, we found that VS nf2  and VS spo  were located within a subcluster of Schwann tumors ( Fig. 1G ) and clustering did not separate VS nf2  from VS spo  ( Sup. Fig. S2H ). When comparing VS nf2  with VS spo , we found that Schwann cells were indistinguishable, however the germline haploid  NF2  dosage appeared to result in an M2-like macrophage phenotype in VS nf2 . In subsequent analyses, we focused on Schwann cell states across all VS that could be driving tumor progression. Merlin dosage determines Schwann cell states Mammalian cells are sensitive to  NF2 /merlin  dosage.  27 NF2  haploinsufficiency and/or merlin depletion deterministically affects the cellular phenotype. In schwannomas, chromosome 22q loss (via loss of heterozygosity or biallelic deletion) is not always the mode of NF2/merlin inactivation, making the identification of Schwann cells with merlin depletion challenging. To overcome this, we first defined a consistent transcriptomic signature of  NF2 /merlin loss ( Fig. 2A ) that was independent of the underlying genetic mechanism. Leveraging tumors with a distinct signal for chromosome 22q loss (e.g., snVS03 and snVS13), we identified 158 genes that were consistently upregulated in Schwann cells and used these to derive a merlin depletion score (MDS) ( Fig. 2B ). Across tumors, the MDS correlated strongly with hippo signaling pathway  and  28 NF2 -knockout cell-line  derived scores (r = 0.46–0.70) but not with 22q copy-loss status (r = −0.40), indicating that it reflects merlin functional depletion rather than chromosomal dosage ( 29 Sup. Fig. S3A ;  Sup. Table S4 ). The MDS showed improved discrimination for identifying Schwann cell populations with merlin loss compared to the hippo pathway activation score , and transcriptomic signatures derived from experimental  28 NF2  knockout cells (HS01, HS11, Syn01, Syn05)  ( 29 Sup. Figs. S3B  and  S3C ). To evaluate how coherently each score mapped onto the single-cell manifold, we computed Moran’s I score using the UMAP embedding as a generic spatial framework.  The MDS consistently displayed the highest autocorrelation across tumors (mean Moran’s I = 0.84 ± 0.06), exceeding values for hippo, HS01/HS11, and Syn01/Syn05 ( 30 Sup. Fig. S3D ). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the MDS provides the most discriminative and biologically coherent measure of merlin functional loss across both VS nf2 , and VS spo , and it was therefore used for downstream analyses. The Schwann cells were then subset, re-clustered, and sub-classified according to the dominant gene expression patterns ( Sup. Fig. 4A ,  Sup. Tables S5 ), that matched with previous Schwann cell sub-classification schema  ( 31 Sup. Fig. 4B ). There were no significant differences in sub-class membership between VS nf2  and VS spo  (p = 0.5, Mann-Whitney test) ( Fig. 2D ). We noted a gradient in the MDS across the Schwann cells ( Figure 2E ), allowing us to re-classify cells according to quartiles for MDS: +σ > 2σ > −σ as merlin-depleted (Schwann mer- ), merlin-intermediate (Schwann mer+/− ), and merlin-intact (Schwann mer+ ) ( Fig. 2F ). The transcriptomes of publicly available normal Schwann cells  (2,395 cells) were confirmed to have a Schwann 18 , 32 , 33 mer+  MDS signature ( Fig. 2G ). The myelinating subset of Schwann cells were the largest, and macrophage-like (MΦ-like) cells were the smallest sub-class of Schwann mer- ( Figure 2H ). Hippo signaling (via YAP/TAZ stimulated gene expression)  pathway was highly upregulated in Schwann 14 , 15 mer−  ( Fig. 2I ,  Sup. Table. S6 ). We found highly coordinated elevations in hippo signaling ( TEAD s,  YAP1 ,  WWTR1 ), Schwann cell activation ( NRG1 ,  NRG2 ), macrophage recruitment ( CSF1 ,  IL34 ), and angiogenesis ( VEGFA ,  FGF2 ) along the MDS pseudotime ( Fig. 2J ), suggesting a congruence between MDS and tumorigenic signaling driving Schwannoma progression.  Myelinating Schwann sub-class appeared to drive major outgoing signaling, while the hypoxia Schwann sub-class was driving VEGFA signaling ( 34 – 36 Sup. Fig. 4C ). Ligand-receptor interaction analysis revealed that Schwann mer−  contributed to a majority of the outgoing signals from Schwann cells to the VS microenvironment (including IL2, VEGF, NRG, and CSF1 signaling) ( Fig. 2K ). Schwann mer−  were promiscuous senders and receivers, with other receivers being Schwann mer+/− , Schwann mer+ , endothelial cells and macrophages (Mφ) ( Fig. 2L ). Clinically, Schwann mer−  abundance in VS was highly correlated with tumor growth rate (Pearson coefficient = 0.61) ( Fig. 2M ). Taken together, our findings suggest that merlin depletion in a subset of Schwann cells could be a primary driver of VS tumor progression. Nuclear retention of NF2 mRNA is related to high MDS in Schwann cells Merlin immunoreactivity is a poor indicator of the underlying mechanisms of  NF2 /merlin inactivation.  To overcome the limitations of protein-level 37 , and spot-aggregated spatial transcriptomics 31 , 38 , we investigated VS tissues with high-resolution spatial transcriptomics platform (stRNAish). Using a custom 300-gene probe-set ( 39 Sup. Table S7 ), we investigated the sub-cellular localization, and consequences of NF2/merlin inactivation spatially. Following label-transfers from snRNAseq datasets  ( 40 Sup. Fig. S5A ), we identified the canonical cell classes, Schwann/macrophage subclasses, and Schwann merlin status (VS nf2 , n=4; VS spor , n=4) ( Fig. 3A ). We had noted that neither chromatin accessibility at the  NF2  locus ( Sup. Fig. S5B ) nor  NF2  transcript ( Sup. Fig. S5C ) expression was associated with Schwann MDS at the single cell level. We asked if nuclear retention of the  NF2  transcript  played a role in merlin gene expression status and MDS. We found that Schwann 41 mer-  retained nuclear NF2 mRNA compared to Schwann cells with lower MDS ( Fig. 3B ). Tumor cells frequently demonstrate enlargement of nuclear size , a phenomenon we observed in increasing nuclear size in Schwann cells with increasing MDS ( 42 Fig. 3C ), but, without a change in total cell size. We found that global chromatin discompaction of Schwann mer−  compared to Schwann mer+  cells in snATACseq dataset ( Sup. Fig. 5D ); a phenomenon that could underlie nuclear expansion. Correspondingly, we found that the nuclear retained mRNA in Schwann mer−  was significantly enriched for RNA preprocessing ( Sup. Fig. S5E ). VS tumor progression is driven by distinct transcriptomic and protein expression spatial niches We next explored the inter-cellular interactions between Schwann subclasses and stromal (non-Schwann) cells that could underlie progression of VS. Cell-level neighborhood enrichment analysis  revealed that M2-like macrophages were closely associated with repair-like Schwann subclass, while T-cells were closely associated with IFN response Schwann subclass ( 30 Fig. 3D ). We expanded the analysis and identified 6, non-overlapping spatial niches  across VS specimens that demonstrated relative enrichment of Schwann subclasses, and stromal cells ( 43 Fig. 3E ). We explored the hypoxic, proliferating, and macrophage activating niches further ( Fig. 3F ). In the hypoxia niche, we found enrichment of hypoxia, myelinating and stress sub-classes of Schwann cells ( Fig. 3F ,  top row ); sub-classes associated with high MDS scores (see  Fig. 2H ). In the hypoxia niche, we found an enrichment of Schwann cells expressing  VEGFA , likely driving angiogenesis ( Fig 3G ,  top ). The proliferating niche was enriched for myelinating and proliferating Schwann sub-classes, and proliferating macrophage cells; with a corresponding enrichment of proliferating Schwann cells with high  MKI67  expression ( Fig. 3G ,  middle ). The macrophage activating niche was enriched with M1- and M2-like macrophages and Schwann stress sub-class; with an expected higher expression of  CSF1R  in the macrophages in this niche ( Fig 3G ,  bottom ). We extended the niche analysis to explore the role of MDS in VS tumor progression. We asked which MDS classes were in proximity to Schwann sub-classes, to find that Schwann hypoxia sub-class were closely associated with Schwann mer−  ( Fig. 3H ;  top ). Meanwhile, Schwann myelinating sub-class were most closely associated with Schwann mer+  ( Fig. 3H ;  middle ), suggesting that the MDS scores are correlated with spatial niches for hypoxia, and proliferation respectively. For the macrophage proliferation niche, Schwann stress sub-class cells (expressing  CSF-1 ) were in close proximity to  CSF-1R  expressing macrophages ( Fig. 3H ;  bottom ). Clinically, VS tumor growth-rates were correlated with the vessel niche, and expectedly, the proliferating niche. The VS tumor volume at clinical presentation was correlated with the stable Schwann cell niche ( Fig. 3I ). We explored the relationship of the transcriptomic niches with the protein expression level landscape with multiplexed immunohistochemistry (mIHC,  Fig. 3J ). We approached this question by focusing on how hypoxic stress may lead to angiogenesis in VS tumors. Following cell classification of mIHC datasets (see  Methods ), we identified Schwann cells with VEGFA protein expression suggesting local hypoxic stress ( Fig. 3K ). The tumor blood vessels were then marked ( Fig. 3L ), and their distance from the centroids of hypoxic regions analyzed in stRNAish ( Fig. 3M ) and mIHC datasets. We found that smaller, presumably newly sprouted, blood vessels were closer to the hypoxic regions. The hypoxic regions were further removed from larger, more mature blood vessels ( Fig. 3M ), suggesting alleviation of local hypoxic pressure. Lastly, we found evidence of temporal/spatial progression in niches. When comparing the association of blood vessels with VEGFA+ Schwann cells, we found that Schwann cells with VEGFA protein expression were likely to be closer to blood vessels that the Schwann cells with  VEGFA  mRNA transcript ( Fig. 3N ). Taken together, our findings suggest that distinct vascular and proliferative spatial niches that are related to Schwann MDS mediated VS tumor growth. Schwann MDS is a plastic transcriptional cell state dependent on TEAD1 activity We sought to understand if Schwann MDS was indicative of plastic transcriptional states. With a robust analysis strategy using RNA velocity , and lineage tracing analysis ( 44 Fig. 4A ) , we identified macrostates across Schwann cell MDS and sub-class states. Unsupervised initial cell states were identified as Mφ-like/Schwann 45 mer+  cells. Terminal states were Schwann mer−  cells belonging to the myelinating and stress subclasses. Broadly, lineage inference suggested directional cell state transitions between Schwann mer+  and Schwann mer−  cell states via Schwann mer+/−  state. Schwann MDS was aligned with the RNA velocity latent time, and consequently, the expression of hippo genes, Schwann/macrophage activating genes, and angiogenic genes ( Fig. 4B ,  Sup. Fig. 6 ). We extended cellular plasticity analysis by leveraging concurrent single nucleus ATACseq (snATACseq) data. We found evidence of elevated chromatin accessibility globally ( Sup. Fig. 5D ), and at genes ( Fig. 4C ) in Schwann mer−  cells. We investigated whether Schwann mer−  cells exhibited a systematic chromatin accessibility at tumor driving loci, and found elevated accessibility at promoters and enhancers for key genes ( NRG1 ,  CSF1 , and  VEGFA ) and  TEAD1  ( Fig. 4D ). Since,  TEAD1  is critical for Schwann cell development , and underpins hippo activation in tumors 10 , 46 , we asked if Schwann MDS was driving tumor formation via TEAD-hippo axis. We performed TEAD1 chromatin immunoprecipitation DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) in human VS tumor primary cell cultures. We found TEAD1 binding to promoters of genes including  15 , 47 MYC ,  CSF1  and  VEGFA  ( Sup. Table S8 ), and an overall pro-tumorigenic signaling (e.g. ‘Regulation of cell growth’ pathway) ( Fig. 4E ). A majority of the gene loci (n = 120) identified in ChIP overlapped with the genes comprising the MDS score, confirming the convergence of MDS mediated signaling on TEAD1 transcription factor ( Fig. 4F ;  Sup. Table S9 ). We leveraged concurrent snRNAseq and snATACseq dataset to infer transcription factor activity across the canonical cell classes and cell states in VS.  We found that TEAD1 was a key transcription factor driving Schwann 48 mer−  phenotype ( Fig. 4G ). Along the MDS pseudotime, inferred TEAD1 activity was highly correlated with a transition from Schwann mer+  to Schwann mer−  cell state ( Fig. 4H ). VS tumors with elevated inferred TEAD1 activity were highly correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.44) with increased growth rates ( Fig. 4I ). With  in-silico  TEAD1 activity perturbation, we found a reversal of plastic Schwann mer−  state towards a Schwann mer+  state ( Fig. 4J ).  In-silico  TEAD1 perturbation predicted a reduction in Schwann MDS across all sub-classes, and significant reductions in expression of tumor-driving genes -  NRG1 ,  CSF1 , and  VEGFA  across all Schwann sub-classes ( Fig. 4K ). The effect of  in-silico  perturbation on gene expression was limited to TEAD1 ( Fig. 4L ). Taken together our findings suggest that Schwann MDS is a transcriptional cell state that is dependent on TEAD1 activity, and that suppressing TEAD1 activity could lead to a suppression of tumorigenic pathways in VS. TEAD1 inhibition reverses merlin-loss mediated tumorigenic pathways Merlin loss drives tumor formation via YAP/TAZ-TEAD complex , an event that is disrupted by TEAD auto-palmitoylation inhibition 49 . We leveraged the demonstrated anti-tumor effect of small TEAD palmitoylation inhibitors (TEADi; Vivace Therapeutics, San Mateo) on Periostin;Cre-NF2 50 , 51 fl/fl  mice . We treated 5-month-old Periostin;Cre-NF2 7 , 52 fl/fl  mice with intraperitoneal TEADi for 21 days ( Figure 5A ), and harvested dorsal root ganglia as previously reported . We measured the abundance of vegfa in dorsal root ganglia ( 7 Figures 5B  and  5C ). We found a two-fold increase in normalized expression of vegfa in Cre+ mice, that was reversed with TEADi treatment. We found a decrease in Schwann cell associated vegfa signal with TEADi treatment ( Figure 5D ) in dorsal root ganglia of treated mice. We did not find a change in the abundance or vegfa signal associated with the neuron cell bodies in dorsal root ganglia. These results suggested that TEADi treatment can target a key tumorigenic signal in Schwannomas with inhibition of vegfa. We then asked if pharmacologic TEADi strategy could be translated to human patients with schwannomas and NF2-related tumors. We tested four TEADi – VT104, VT106, VT3989, and VT107 (4 μM each, for 6 hours) in a single-blind  in-vitro  experimental design. With co-immunoprecipitation, we found minimal interaction of YAP and TAZ with TEAD (anti-panTEAD pulldown), whereas, a robust interaction was seen human tumor cells in primary culture (VS nf2 , VS spo , and NF2-related meningioma – Men nf2 ). TEADi effectively inhibited YAP/TAZ-TEAD interaction in human tumor primary tumor cultures ( Figure 5E ). In the same set of primary cells, we found that TEADi treatment inhibited the expression of Schwann proliferation ( NRG1 ), macrophage chemotactic ( MCSF  and  IL-34 ), and angiogenic ( VEGFA ) factors ( Figure 5F ). Additionally, we treated the available VS spo  cells cultures with VT3989 and found similar effects on YAP/TAZ-TEAD interaction, and downstream tumorigenic signal mediators ( Sup. Figs. S7A  and  S7B ). In single-blind experiments, we next tested the differential efficacy of the four TEADi molecules on differential tumor cell survival  in vitro . VT104 and VT106 demonstrated a robust therapeutic window, with minimal effects on normal Schwann cells when compared with schwannoma cells ( Figure 5G ). Both VT104 and VT106 appeared to be non-toxic to normal Schwann cells, while reducing the viability of tumor cells by 15 to 21% within 24 hours. Due to the scarcity of primary human tumor cell cultures, we then tested VT104 (4μM) on the 4 available primary tumor cell lines and found a reduction in tumor cell survival by at least 15% within 24 hours ( Figure 5H ). We found similar effects on survival of normal Schwann cells, as well as on VS spo  primary cell cultures with the other TEADi (VT016, VT3989, and VT107) ( Sup. Figs. S7C  and  S7D ). Taken together, these findings suggest that a broad class of TEAD auto-palmitoylation inhibitors may be used as targeted therapy for schwannomas, and other  NF2 /merlin loss driven human tumors.",
  "discussion": "Discussion We report that intra-tumoral heterogeneity of Schwann cells driven by differences in merlin activity in Schwann cells. We found that the merlin depletion score (MDS) is a transcriptomic surrogate for Schwann cell merlin activity. The MDS allowed us to identify Schwann mer−  cells that demonstrated the potential for driving tumor progression by at least three different mechanisms: a. paracrine Schwann cell activation of Schwann mer+/−  and Schwann mer+  cells (via  NRG1 ), b. macrophage chemotaxis and activation (via  CSF1  and  IL34 ) , and c. angiogenesis (via  53 , 54 VEGFA ).  MDS-based Schwann cell heterogeneity was detectable as spatial niches in both transcriptomic and protein-expression level analyses. Although, we did find evidence of polyclonality in VS 55 – 57 nf2  previously , we did not find strong evidence of polyclonality underlying tumor heterogeneity in the current study. Instead, the MDS formed the transcriptomic basis for spatial intratumoral heterogeneity of merlin immunoreactivity. 24 21 In this study, we harnessed a multi-omic analysis to study whether VS nf2  and VS spo  have differences in molecular pathogenesis.  We did not find transcriptomic, or protein expression level differences in the Schwann cell populations of VS 58 , 59 nf2  and VS spo . Instead, both VS nf2  and VS spo  demonstrated plastic Schwann cell states along the MDS spectrum. Similar to prior studies , Schwann cells could be sub-classified based on their transcriptomic phenotypes; sub-classes we found to be strongly related to their MDS status. Furthermore, a robust lineage inference strategy revealed the relatedness, and potentially plastic Schwann cell states that were driven by TEAD1 transcription factor activity. 31 , 38 , 39 We validated the centrality of TEAD1 to MDS, and ultimately to the mechanisms driving VS tumor progression with  in-silico ,  in vivo , and  ex vivo  analyses. These results allow us to infer the potential utility of TEAD1 inhibition  as a targeted therapeutic strategy in VS 7 , 50 , 51 , 60 nf2  and VS spo , as well as potentially other  NF2 /merlin driven schwannomas. We believe that targeting TEAD1 offers tissue-specificity for Schwann cell-derived tumors since TEAD1 is a lineage-specific transcription factor for Schwann cells.  Our results also offer insight into the available therapeutic window with pharmaceutical TEAD1 inhibition. Recent Phase1/2 clinical data from the use of VT3989 attests to the safety in human populations. 9 , 10  We found that TEAD auto-palmitoylation inhibition with TEADi was selective against human-derived schwannoma cells, while sparing normal Schwann cells ( 8 Fig. 5G ). We found that despite a strong predilection for TEAD1 expression in normal Schwann cells, TEAD1 did not interact with YAP/TAZ complex, a phenomenon readily observed in the schwannoma cells ( Fig. 5E ). Exposure to TEADi prevented TEAD1-YAP/TAZ interaction and inhibited the tumor promoting signals along at least three axes (Schwann proliferation, macrophage chemotaxis/activation, and angiogenesis). TEAD1 inhibition potentially reverses Schwann cell phenotype from a high to a low MDS state and may prevent VS tumor escape seen when targeting the angiogenic pathways  or MEK inhibition alone. 61 – 63 64 Limitations We did not perform a detailed survey of the clonal genetic evolution of Schwann cells in VS tumors with single-cell resolution DNA sequencing. However, given the low mutational burden of VS tumors , we suspect that the Schwann cell variation may be driven by epigenetic factors, partly by changes in chromatin accessibility. Currently, the safety, and long-term tolerability of TEAD1 inhibition is lacking in human patients with benign tumors such as VS. We are now creating a clinical trial to test the efficacy of TEAD1 inhibition in human patients with both VS 16 nf2  and VS spo  tumors. Conclusions We found that in VS nf2  and VS spo , tumor-driving merlin-depleted Schwann (Schwann mer- ) cells exhibited elevated hippo activity that was predominantly driven by TEAD1.  In-silico  TEAD1 perturbation led to a reversal to merlin-intact Schwann phenotype. These findings, and tumor cell growth suppression were confirmed in NF2 fl/fl;Peri-Cre  mouse model , and in human-derived schwannoma cells with a TEAD auto-palmitoylation inhibitors. 7  Our computational, and experimental results confirm that TEAD1 inhibition could be a potent, targeted strategy for schwannomas, and other NF2-related tumors. 8",
