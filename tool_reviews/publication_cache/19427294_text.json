Author information: (1)Department of Developmental Biology, The University of Texas Southwestern  Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390-9133, USA.  Comment in     Cell Stem Cell. 2009 May 8;4(5):371-2. doi: 10.1016/j.stem.2009.04.010.  The tumor predisposition disorder neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is one of the  most common genetic disorders of the nervous system. It is caused by mutations  in the Nf1 tumor-suppressor gene, which encodes a GTPase-activating protein  (GAP) that negatively regulates p21-RAS. Development of malignant nerve tumors  and neurofibromas occurs frequently in NF1. However, little is known about the  molecular mechanisms mediating the initiation and progression of these complex  tumors, or the identity of the specific cell type that gives rise to dermal or  cutaneous neurofibromas. In this study, we identify a population of  stem/progenitor cells residing in the dermis termed skin-derived precursors  (SKPs) that, through loss of Nf1, form neurofibromas. We propose that SKPs, or  their derivatives, are the cell of origin of dermal neurofibroma. We also  provide evidence that additional signals from nonneoplastic cells in the tumor  microenvironment play essential roles in neurofibromagenesis.
