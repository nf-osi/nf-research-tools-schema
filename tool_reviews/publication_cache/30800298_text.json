  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the impact of plexiform neurofibromas on the lives of adults with neurofibromatosis type 1. BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a complex neurogenetic syndrome that affects many aspects of health and functioning. A common manifestation of neurofibromatosis type 1 is plexiform neurofibromas, non-cancerous tumours that can cause disfigurement, pain and neurologic disability. Patient-reported outcome measures used in this condition have addressed symptoms and functional ability but not how the condition affects patients' lives, particularly, their ability to meet their human needs. METHODS: Unstructured qualitative interviews were conducted with adults with neurofibromatosis type 1-associated plexiform neurofibromas in the United Kingdom and United States. Interviewees were encouraged to describe how plexiform neurofibromas affected their ability to meet their needs. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. The UK and US transcripts were combined and theoretical thematic analysis was conducted. RESULTS: In all, 42 interviews (United Kingdom = 20, United States = 22) were conducted. Transcripts revealed 696 statements on the impact of plexiform neurofibromas on need fulfilment. Five major themes emerged: appearance, relationships, independence, role fulfilment and pleasure. CONCLUSION: Neurofibromatosis type 1-associated plexiform neurofibromas have a major effect on individuals' ability to meet their needs. An understanding of need fulfilment will complement information generated from traditional patient-reported outcome measures, particularly in a multi-faceted syndrome such as neurofibromatosis type 1.",
