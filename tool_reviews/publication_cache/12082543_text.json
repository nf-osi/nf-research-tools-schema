Euclid Avenue, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA. gutmannd@neuro.wustl.edu  The neurofibromatoses represent two of the most common inherited tumor  predisposition syndromes affecting the nervous system. Individuals with  neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) are prone to the development of astrocytomas and  peripheral nerve sheath tumors whereas those affected with neurofibromatosis 2  (NF2) develop schwannomas and meningiomas. The development of traditional  homozygous knockout mice has provided insights into the roles of the NF1 and NF2  genes during development and in differentiation, but has been less instructive  regarding the contribution of NF1 and NF2 dysfunction to the pathogenesis of  specific benign and malignant tumors. Recent progress employing novel mouse  targeting strategies has begun to illuminate the roles of the NF1 and NF2 gene  products in the molecular pathogenesis of NF-associated tumors.
