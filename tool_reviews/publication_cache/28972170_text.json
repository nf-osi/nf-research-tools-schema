  "abstract": "Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix or to surrounding cells plays a key role in cell proliferation and differentiation and is critical for proper tissue homeostasis. An important pathway in adhesion-dependent cell proliferation is the Hippo signaling cascade, which is coregulated by the transcription factors Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). However, how cells integrate extracellular information at the molecular level to regulate YAP1's nuclear localization is still puzzling. Herein, we investigated the role of β1 integrins in regulating this process. We found that β1 integrin-dependent cell adhesion is critical for supporting cell proliferation in mesenchymal cells both",
