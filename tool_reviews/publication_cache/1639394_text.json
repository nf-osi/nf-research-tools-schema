  "title": "A yeast artificial chromosome contig encompassing the type 1 neurofibromatosis gene.",
  "abstract": "The yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) system (Burke et al., 1987, Science 236: 806-812) allows the direct cloning of large regions of the genome. A YAC contig map of approximately 700 kb encompassing the region surrounding the type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF1) locus on 17q11.2 has been constructed. A single YAC containing the entire NF1 locus has been constructed by homologous recombination in yeast. In the process of contig construction a novel method of YAC end rescue has been developed by YAC circularization in yeast and plasmid rescue in bacteria. YACs containing homology to the NF1 region but mapping to another chromosome have also been discovered. Sequences of portions of the homologous locus indicate that this other locus is a nonprocessed pseudogene.",
