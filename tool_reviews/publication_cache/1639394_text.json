  "abstract": "A yeast artificial chromosome contig encompassing the type 1 neurofibromatosis  gene.  Marchuk DA(1), Tavakkol R, Wallace MR, Brownstein BH, Taillon-Miller P, Fong CT,  Legius E, Andersen LB, Glover TW, Collins FS.  Author information: (1)Department of Human Genetics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48109.  The yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) system (Burke et al., 1987, Science 236:  806-812) allows the direct cloning of large regions of the genome. A YAC contig  map of approximately 700 kb encompassing the region surrounding the type 1  neurofibromatosis (NF1) locus on 17q11.2 has been constructed. A single YAC  containing the entire NF1 locus has been constructed by homologous recombination  in yeast. In the process of contig construction a novel method of YAC end rescue  has been developed by YAC circularization in yeast and plasmid rescue in  bacteria. YACs containing homology to the NF1 region but mapping to another  chromosome have also been discovered. Sequences of portions of the homologous  locus indicate that this other locus is a nonprocessed pseudogene.  DOI: 10.1016/0888-7543(92)90140-n PMID: 1639394 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",
