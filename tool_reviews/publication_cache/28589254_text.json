  "methods": "Methods \n 18 F-FDG PET data from a cohort of 54 patients (24 female, 30 male, mean age 35.1\u00a0years) with neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1), and clinically suspected malignant transformation of neurofibromas into MPNSTs, were included. Scans were performed to a standard clinical protocol at 1.5 and 4\u00a0h post-injection. Six first-order [including three standardised uptake value (SUV) parameters], four\u00a0second-order (derived from grey-level co-occurrence matrices) and four high-order (derived from neighbourhood grey-tone difference matrices) statistical features were calculated from tumour volumes of interest. Each patient had histological verification or at least 5\u00a0years clinical follow-up as the reference standard with regards to the characterisation of tumours as benign ( n \u00a0=\u00a030) or malignant ( n \u00a0=\u00a024). Patients and methods A cohort of 54 consecutive patients with NF1 and clinical suspicion of malignant transformation of symptomatic neurofibromas, referred from our national neurofibromatosis service for  18 F-FDG PET/CT scans, was identified. There were 30 male (mean age 34.7\u00a0years, range 12 to 73\u00a0years) and 24 female patients (mean age 35.5\u00a0years, range 9 to 86\u00a0years). An institutional review board waiver was obtained for retrospective analysis of these data. \n 18 F-FDG PET/CT scans were all acquired to the same protocol in the same institution on one of two scanners (Discovery VCT or DST, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) which were cross-calibrated to within 3% [ 15 ]. Patients were fasted for at least 6\u00a0h prior to administration of 350 (+/\u2212 10%) MBq  18 F-FDG (scaled to body weight/70 in paediatric patients) and were only acquired if the blood glucose measurement was less than 10\u00a0mmol/l. Scans were acquired according to the institutional standard clinical protocol for NF1 patients with an acquisition at approximately 1.5\u00a0h (101.5 +/\u2212 15\u00a0min) from the upper thigh to the base of skull followed by an acquisition at approximately 4\u00a0h (251.7 +/\u2212 18.4\u00a0min) of the symptomatic tumour site only, all at 5\u00a0min per bed position [ 2 ]. Images were all reconstructed using an ordered subset expectation maximisation algorithm (2 iterations, 20 subsets) with a reconstructed slice thickness of 3.27\u00a0mm and pixel size 4.7\u00a0mm. The CT component of the scans was acquired at 120 kVp and 65 mAs without administration of oral or intravenous contrast agent. The reconstructed PET datasets were imported into in-house texture analysis software implemented in MATLAB (Release 2016a, The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). Voxel intensities within the symptomatic tumour VOI were resampled to yield 64 discrete bins. Whilst most patients had multiple neurofibromas, only the symptomatic tumours were analysed. Since many of the tumours showed only low-grade FDG uptake, it was not possible to adequately segment the tumour regions directly from the PET data by freehand or by using semi-automated methods such as percentage threshold or fuzzy locally adaptive Bayesian methods [ 16 ]. Regions of interest were, therefore, drawn on the corresponding CT images where tumours were more easily defined (Fig.  1 ) by an experienced operator with radiology and nuclear medicine training and over 20\u00a0years experience. To assess inter-observer variability, a random subset of 16 patients had VOIs defined on 1.5- and 4-h scans by a separate operator blinded to the initial observer measurements and clinical data. \n Fig. 1 \n 18 F-FDG PET and CT ( left ) with corresponding images with ROIs ( right ). A symptomatic but benign left posterior thigh neurofibroma (SUVmax\u00a0=\u00a02.83) As well as SUVs (mean, maximum and peak, all normalised to body weight in kilogrammes), three first-order (SD, entropy and uniformity), four\u00a0second-order GLCM parameters (contrast, entropy, uniformity and homogeneity) and four high-order NGTDM parameters (coarseness, contrast, busyness and complexity) were calculated from the resulting VOIs. Second-order features were calculated from GLCMs measuring the grey-level distribution between pairs of voxels and high-order features were derived from three-dimensional matrices taking into consideration neighbouring voxels in adjacent planes. All these features have been previously described in detail [ 13 ,  14 ] and the chosen parameters have previously shown utility and/or robustness when used in clinical  18 F-FDG PET data of cancers [ 17 \u2013 22 ]. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (v22, Chicago, IL, USA) and MedCalc (v16.8.4, Ostend, Belgium) software. The data distributions were tested for normality using the Shapiro\u2013Wilk test. As data were not normally distributed differences between benign and malignant tumours were tested with the Mann\u2013Whitney U test for each parameter and correlations between parameters with Spearman correlation. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were also used to compare the ability of each parameter to classify tumours as benign or malignant and the area under ROC curves (AUROC) were calculated. Comparisons between AUROC were made as described by DeLong et al. [ 23 ]. Separate assessment was made by combining SUVmax with other parameters that did not show a correlation with SUVmax. Statistical significance was assumed when  p \u00a0<\u00a00.05. Inter-observer variation was assessed with intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs).",

  "introduction": "Introduction Neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) is an inherited disease characterised by multiple neurofibromas in which there is an increased risk of malignant transformation to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs) [ 1 ]. Non-invasive differentiation of benign symptomatic neurofibromas from those with malignant transformation is a clinical challenge. Standardised uptake value (SUV) or tumour-to-liver ratio measurements from  18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18 F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) have previously been described as an accurate method to detect MPNSTs in this patient group [ 2 \u2013 6 ]. Qualitative scoring of heterogeneity of  18 F-FDG PET on a three-point scale has also been described where MPNSTS displayed a more heterogeneous uptake of tracer with similar discriminatory power to maximum SUV (SUVmax) [ 7 ]. There is increasing interest in the quantitative measurement of heterogeneity in medical images of cancer patients, including computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and PET. There is evidence that the use of heterogeneity parameters may improve characterisation, segmentation, prognostication and therapy response assessment compared to standard metrics such as size or lesion activity [ 8 \u2013 12 ]. The most commonly used methods involve the measurement of statistically based parameters including first-, second- and high-order features. First-order features include global parameters such as SUV but also heterogeneity parameters, such as standard deviation (SD), first-order entropy and first-order uniformity. These are derived from intensity volume histograms of a tumour volume of interest (VOI) [ 8 ,  10 ,  12 ]. Second-order features, most often derived from grey-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM), measure the relationship between pairs of voxels [ 13 ] and high-order features, most often derived from neighbourhood grey-tone difference matrices (NGTDM), measure the relationship between three of more voxels in the same or adjacent planes [ 14 ]. Our hypothesis was that quantitative heterogeneity parameters from  18 F-FDG PET could improve differentiation of benign symptomatic neurofibromas from MPNSTs compared to standard PET metrics such as SUV and our aim was to compare discriminative ability in a retrospective cohort of patients with NF1 whose tumours had been well-characterised.",
  "results": "Results Thirty patients had benign tumours and 24 had MPNSTs confirmed either histologically ( n \u00a0=\u00a030) or by at least 5\u00a0years of follow-up ( n \u00a0=\u00a024). Thirty-six symptomatic tumours were on the trunk and 18 in the extremities. Good inter-observer agreement was found for measurement of all parameters with ICC varying from 0.86 (NGTDM contrast and GLCM contrast) to 1.0 (SUVmax and SUVpeak) on 1.5-h and 4-h scans. Median (and range) malignant and benign tumour volumes were 60.0\u00a0cm 3  and 23.2\u00a0cm 3 , respectively (8.3\u2013303.9 and 3.3\u2013164.1\u00a0cm 3 , respectively,  p \u00a0=\u00a00.004). On 1.5-h scans, there was a significant difference between benign and malignant tumours for all SUV and other first-order parameters, for none of the second-order parameters and for all four high-order parameters. At 4\u00a0h, the results were the same, except second-order entropy was significantly different; high-order contrast was not (Table  1 ). Only percentage change SUVmean and SUVpeak showed significant differences between benign and malignant lesions (Table  1 ). For ROC analysis, SUV and other first-order parameters, second-order entropy and all high-order parameters showed ability to discriminate at 1.5 and 4\u00a0h (except high-order contrast at 4\u00a0h; Table  2 ). SUVmax showed the highest AUROC at 1.5\u00a0h (0.992) and SUVpeak at 4\u00a0h (0.997), closely followed by SUVmax (0.996). SD showed the best discrimination from the other first-order features (0.967 and 0.99 at 1.5 and 4\u00a0h, respectively; Fig.  2 ). Coarseness showed the best discrimination from the high-order features (0.894 and 0.888 at 1.5 and 4\u00a0h, respectively; Table  2 ; Fig.  3 ). The percentage change in SUVmean and SUVpeak showed some discriminatory ability (AUROC 0.722 and 0.688, respectively; Table  2 ). \n Table 1 Differences between benign and malignant tumours for each

GLCM parameters performed poorly in discriminating tumours and, so, were not further assessed, but the combined parameter SUVmax/NGTDM contrast was further evaluated to see if there was incremental value from this combination (Tables  1  and  2 ). Whilst combining the parameters in this way showed a better performance than NGTDM contrast alone, it did not show any additional value over SUVmax.",
  "discussion": "Conclusion In patients with NF1, MPNSTs showed greater heterogeneity and greater levels of  18 F-FDG uptake than benign symptomatic neurofibromas. First-order heterogeneity parameters were as discriminative as SUVmax. Although high-order features also showed the ability to differentiate benign and malignant tumours, these had lesser discriminatory ability compared to SUVmax.",
