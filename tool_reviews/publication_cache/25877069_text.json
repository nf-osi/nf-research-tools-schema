  "title": "Establishment of immortalized murine mesothelial cells and a novel mesothelioma cell line.",
  "abstract": "Mesothelial cells are susceptible to asbestos fiber-induced cytotoxicity and on longer time scales to transformation; the resulting mesothelioma is a highly aggressive neoplasm that is considered as incurable at the present time Zucali et al. (Cancer Treatment Reviews 37:543-558, 2011). Only few murine cell culture models of immortalized mesothelial cells and mesothelioma cell lines exist to date. We generated SV40-immortalized cell lines derived from wild-type (WT) and neurofibromatosis 2 (merlin) heterozygote (Nf2+/-) mice, both on a commonly used genetic background, C57Bl/6J. All immortalized mesothelial clones consistently grow in DMEM supplemented with fetal bovine serum. Cells can be passaged for more than 40 times without any signs of morphological changes or a decrease in proliferation rate. The tumor suppressor gene NF2 is one of the most frequently mutated genes in human mesothelioma, but its detailed function is still unknown. Thus, these genotypically distinct cell lines likely relevant for malignant mesothelioma formation are expected to serve as useful in vitro models, in particular to compare with in vivo studies in mice of the same genotype. Furthermore, we generated a novel murine mesothelioma cell line RN5 originating from an Nf2+/- mouse subjected to repeated crocidolite exposure. RN5 cells are highly tumorigenic.",

  "methods": "Materials and Methods Isolation of mouse primary mesothelial cells and mesothelioma cells from a NF2+/\u2212 mouse. Mesothelial cells were isolated from 4 to 6\u00a0months old WT and Nf2+/\u2212 mice, all on a C57Bl/6J background using a previously described protocol (Bot  et al. \n 2003 ). Briefly, mice were killed and the peritoneal cavities were exposed by incision and removal of the fur. The peritoneal cavities were washed with injecting approximately 50\u00a0ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Sigma, St. Louis) via a syringe equipped with a 25G\u2009\u00d7\u20095/8\u2033 needle (BD microlance 3, Becton Dickinson AG, Allschwil, Switzerland) using a peristaltic pump and a second needle (23G, 0.6\u2009\u00d7\u200925\u00a0mm) to allow exit of the PBS solution. Perfusion was maintained until the exiting PBS solution was clear, i.e., devoid of mobile and poorly attached cells. Residual PBS was aspired with a syringe, and the peritoneal cavity was filled with 5\u00a0ml of 0.25% Trypsin/EDTA solution (Gibco, Basel, Switzerland). The body temperature of mouse corpses was maintained at around 37\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min via an infrared heating lamp. The suspension containing the detached cells was collected with a syringe; cells were centrifuged for 10\u00a0min at 300\u00d7 g . Cells mostly comprising primary mesothelial cells were grown in modified Connell\u2019s medium composed of Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM)/F12\u2009+\u2009GlutaMax (Gibco), 15% fetal calf serum (FCS), 0.4\u00a0\u03bcg/ml hydrocortisone, 10\u00a0ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 1% ITS (insulin, transferrin, selenium), 1\u00a0mM sodium pyruvate, 0.1\u00a0mM beta-mercaptoethanol, 1% non-essential amino acids, 1% penicillin\u2013streptomycin, and 2% Mycokill (PAA) (Connell and Rheinwald  1983 ). The  Nf2  alleles (WT or mutated) were genotyped using the common forward primer (NF2_FW 5\u2032-GGGGCTTCGGGAAACCTG G-3\u2032), and either NF2_RV WT (5\u2032-GTCTGGGAAGTCTGTGGAGG-3) or NF2_RV mutant (5\u2032-CTATCAGGACATAGCGTTGG-3\u2032) primers. The cell line RN5 was isolated from an Nf2+/\u2212 mouse that was repeatedly injected with crocidolite starting at 8\u00a0wk of age (7\u2009\u00d7\u2009400\u00a0\u03bcg). Briefly, a clearly discernible tumor localized on the liver was dissected from the mouse 21\u00a0wk after the first injection. The tissue was incubated in a 0.25% Trypsin/EDTA solution for 10\u00a0min; tumor cells were dissociated by mild trituration and cultured in DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, Basel, Switzerland), and 1% PS (100\u00a0U/mL penicillin and 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL streptomycin). Cell culture and growth curves. Primary mesothelial cells from the two genotypes (WT and Nf2+/\u2212) were immortalized by transduction with SV40 small and large T antigen. Transduction was performed using lentivirus that were produced as previously described (Blum and Schwaller  2013 ). The transfer plasmid pCMV/TO SV40 was obtained from Addgene (# 22298). Primary cells were seeded at a density of 10,000 cells/cm 2 ; 24\u00a0h post-seeding cells were transfected with lentivirus at an MOI of 5. Proliferation was monitored using the Incucyte Live Cell Imaging System (Essen Bioscience, Michigan). After passaging, cells were seeded at a very low density (1\u20132 cells/cm 2 ) in 10-cm Petri dishes. Individual and well-delimited clones were picked and transferred into 96-well plates and frozen at passages 7\u201310 following standard protocols. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was performed as previously described (Blum and Schwaller  2013 ). Western blot assay for mesothelin, SV40 large T-antigen, and \u03b2-actin. Cells were grown in 75-cm 2  cell culture flasks (TPP, Trasadingen, Switzerland) until they reached nearly 100% confluence. Subsequently, cells were trypsinized and pelleted (500\u00d7 g , 3\u00a0min), then washed three times with CMF-PBS. Proteins were extracted with RIPA buffer [50\u00a0mM Tris, 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, pH\u00a07.4], incubated for 30\u00a0min on ice, and centrifuged 30\u00a0min at 17,000\u00d7 g  at 4\u00b0C, and the supernatant was collected. The DC assay (BioRad) was performed to quantify the proteins following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Protein samples were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide SDS gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were checked with Ponceau S staining for equal loading. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk PBS for 1\u00a0h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with antibodies recognizing mesothelin (dilution 1:2,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, clone B-3), SV40 large T-antigen (1:2000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Pab101), and \u03b2-actin (1:20,000; Sigma-Aldrich, clone ac-74). Secondary biotinylated antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:20,000, and the ABC system (Vectastain, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was applied. The HRP substrate (Millipore, Luminata Forte) was incubated for 3\u00a0min on the membrane and analyzed on a Western blot reader (FluorChem E System, Bucher Biotec, Basel, Switzerland). Soft agar assay. The procedure of the soft agar assay was adapted from a previously described protocol (Provost  et al. \n 2012 ). Shortly, 0.5% of base agar was prepared by melting 1% of agar (LuBioScience, Lucerne, Switzerland) in a microwave oven and adding of prewarmed (40\u00b0C) 2\u00d7 RPMI completed with 20% FCS and antibiotics (penicillin-streptomycin) and allowed to equilibrate to 37\u00b0C. Equal volumes of the solutions were mixed to give final concentrations of 0.5% agar, 1\u00d7 RPMI, and 10% FCS. One milliliter was added per well in six-well plates and set aside to solidify. Top agar was prepared by melting 0.7% agarose (PeqLab, Erlangen, Germany) in a microwave oven and cooled down to 40\u00b0C and then supplemented with an equal volume of 2\u00d7 RPMI with 20% FCS also at approximately 40\u00b0C. Cells (5000) in a volume of 1\u00a0ml of 0.35% agarose in 1\u00d7 RPMI\u2009+\u200910% FCS was added to the solidified agar. Plates were incubated for 17\u00a0d in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 . Twice per week, the plates were supplied with 0.5\u00a0ml of cell culture medium. Subcutaneous xenograft model. WT C57Bl/6J mice (6\u20138\u00a0wk old;  n \u2009=\u20093\u20135 animals depending on the group) were inoculated s.c. with 4\u2009\u00d7\u200910 5  cells by injection of the cell suspension (50\u00a0\u03bcl in PBS containing 20% matrigel) into the right dorsal flank. Cells included immortalized mesothelial cells (iMeso-WT1 and iMeso-NF3), the MM cell line RN5, and the previously described murine MM cell line AK7 (Cordier Kellerman  et al. \n 2003 ), the latter also on a C57Bl/6J background. Tumors were measured with a caliper weekly as soon as palpable; the volume was calculated using the formula  a \u2009\u00d7\u2009 b \n 2 \u2009\u00d7\u20090.5, where  a  is the large and  b  the small diameter of an ellipse. For the immunohistochemistry, deparaffinized sections were subjected to antigen retrieval using sodium citrate, pH\u00a06, then were processed as previously described (Frei  et al. \n 2011 ). Primary antibodies used were anti-wide spectrum cytokeratin and anti-vimentin (Abcam Ab9377, 1:100 and Ab92547, 1:500, respectively). Immunofluorescence experiments. Cells were seeded on glass coverslips and incubated with the appropriate cell culture medium until a confluence of 70\u201390% was reached. Then, the cells were fixed with 4% PFA, permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100, and blocked with TBS solution containing donkey serum (10%). Cells were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with the primary antibodies at the indicated dilutions: mouse monoclonal anti-pan-cytokeratin, clone Lu-5 (BMA Biomedicals, Augst, Switzerland, T-1302; 1:500), or rabbit polyclonal anti-desmin (Sigma D8281; 1:500). After washing, the cell-containing coverslips were incubated with secondary antibodies for 1\u00a0h with either DyLight488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA; 1:1,000) or Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories; 1:1,000). The cells were counterstained with DAPI (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR; 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) and mounted with Hydromount solution (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA). Images were acquired with a LEICA fluorescent microscope DM6000B (Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a Hamamatsu camera C4742-95 (Bridgewater, NJ).",
