  "abstract": "Partial Blindness to Submicron Topography in NF1 Haploinsufficient Cultured  Fibroblasts Indicates a New Function of Neurofibromin in Regulation of  Mechanosensoric.  Kaufmann D(1), Hoesch J, Su Y, Deeg L, Mellert K, Spatz JP, Kemkemer R.  Author information: (1)Institute of Human Genetics, University of Ulm, Ulm, Stuttgart, Germany.  Cells sense physical properties of their extracellular environment and translate  them into biochemical signals. In this study, cell responses to surfaces with  submicron topographies were investigated in cultured human NF1 haploinsufficient  fibroblasts. Age-matched fibroblasts from 8 patients with neurofibromatosis type  1 (NF1(+/-)) and 9 controls (NF1(+/+)) were cultured on surfaces with grooves of  200 nm height and lateral distance of 2 μm. As cellular response indicator, the  mean cell orientation along microstructured grooves was systematically examined.  The tested NF1 haploinsufficient fibroblasts were significantly less affected by  the topography than those from healthy donors. Incubation of the NF1(+/-)  fibroblasts with the farnesyltransferase inhibitor FTI-277 and other inhibitors  of the neurofibromin pathway ameliorates significantly the cell orientation.  These data indicate that NF1 haploinsufficiency results in an altered response  to specific surface topography in fibroblasts. We suggest a new function of  neurofibromin in the sensoric mechanism to topographies and a partial  mechanosensoric blindness by NF1 haploinsufficiency.
