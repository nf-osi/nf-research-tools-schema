  "abstract": "We previously discovered a sex-by-genotype defect in microglia function using a heterozygous germline knockout mouse model of Neurofibromatosis type 1 (Nf1\u2009\u00b1\u2009mice), in which only microglia from male Nf1\u2009\u00b1\u2009mice exhibited defects in purinergic signaling. Herein, we leveraged an unbiased proteomic approach to demonstrate that male, but not female, heterozygous Nf1\u2009\u00b1\u2009microglia exhibit differences in protein expression, which largely reflect pathways involved in cytoskeletal organization. In keeping with these predicted defects in cytoskeletal function, only male Nf1\u2009\u00b1\u2009microglia had reduced process arborization and surveillance capacity. To determine whether these microglial defects were cell autonomous or reflected adaptive responses to Nf1 heterozygosity in other cells in the brain, we generated conditional microglia Nf1-mutant knockout mice by intercrossing Nf1",

  "methods": "Materials and methods Ethics statement All procedures involving the handling of living mice were performed in strict accordance with the German Animal Protection Law, and were approved by the Regional Office for Health and Social Services in Berlin (Landesamt f\u00fcr Gesundheit und Soziales, Berlin, Germany, Permit Number G0164/19, X9005/18, A0376/17). Adult mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation or by transcardial perfusion of PBS or PFA after intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (Narcoren, Merial GmbH, Hallbergmoos, Germany). All efforts were made to minimize suffering. Similarly, all mice used at Washington University were performed under an approved Animal Studies protocol. Mice Wild type and  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009[ 5 ] mice used in this study were either bred onto a wild type or MacGreen (Csf1r-eGFP; [ 58 ] C57/BL6 background. Conditional microglia-specific  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009mice: CX3CR1-Cre ER  [ 71 ] were intercrossed with  Nf1 flox/flox  [ 1 ] and R26R-EYFP mice [ 63 ] to generate litters heterozygous for Cre ER  expression from the CX3CR1 locus, a conditional (flox)  Nf1  allele and a conditional (LoxP-stop-LoxP; LSL) eYFP transgene in the Rosa26 locus ( Nf1 flox/wt ; Cx3cr1-Cre ER ; LSL-eYFP mice; termed  Nf1 flox/wt CX3CR1-Cre ER  mice). Tamoxifen (100\u00a0mg/kg body weight) was administered intraperitoneally between days P30 and P40 on 5 consecutive days to include Cre recombinase activity in CX3CR1 +  cells. Wild type ( Nf1 wt/wt ; Cx3cr1-Cre ER ; LSL-eYFP mice; termed WT) mice had the same genotype with the exception that they had no  Nf1 flox  allele. Conditional non-microglia-specific  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009mice: hGFAP-Cre +/+  were intercrossed with  Nf1 flox/flox  [ 1 ] to generate litters heterozygous for Cre ER  expression from the GFAP locus and a conditional (flox)  Nf1  allele ( Nf1 flox/wt ; hGFAP-Cre; termed  Nf1 flox/wt ; hGFAP-Cre mice). Wild type ( Nf1 wt/wt ; hGFAP-Cre; termed WT) mice had the same genotype with the exception that they had no  Nf1 flox  allele. All mice were maintained under a 12\u00a0h/12\u00a0h dark\u2013light cycle with food and water supply ad libitum, in accordance with German laws and IACUC recommendations (U.S.A.) for animal protection. All data in the current study are from 12\u201316\u00a0week old mice. Sexes and genotypes are indicated. Immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy Mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital (Narcoren, Merial Hallbergmoos, Germany) and transcardially perfused with phosphate buffered salt solution (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, decapitated and sectioned in the sagittal plane at 40\u00a0\u03bcm thickness using a sliding microtome (Leica SM2000 R, Leica Biosystems GmbH, Nussloch, Germany). Free-floating 40\u00a0\u03bcm sections were incubated in 5% donkey serum (EMD Millipore Corp., Burlington, Massachusetts, USA) and 0.1% Triton-X (Carl Roth\u00ae, Karlsruhe, Germany) in Tris-buffered saline solution (TBSplus) together with the primary antibodies over-night at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. The following primary antibodies were used: goat monoclonal Iba-1 antibody targeting microglia (1:300; Abcam, Cambridge, UK); chicken polyclonal GFP antibody targeting eYFP (1:250; Abcam, Cambridge, UK); mouse anti-NeuN targeting neurons (1:00; Synaptic Systems). After washing, secondary antibodies were prepared in TBSplus. Iba-1 was visualized with donkey anti-goat IgG conjugated with Cy5 or Alexa488 fluorophores (both 1:200; Dianova, Hamburg, Germany); eYFP was visualized with donkey anti-chicken IgY conjugated with Alexa488 or Cy5 (both 1:200; Dianova), NeuN with donkey anti-mouse IgG (H\u2009+\u2009L) conjugated with Cy3 (1:200; Dianova). Sections were incubated with secondary antibodies at room temperature for 2\u00a0h and then mounted on glass slides with Aqua Polymount mounting medium (Polysciences Europe GmbH, Hirschberg an der Bergstra\u00dfe, Germany). Cell nuclei were stained using 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1:500; Dianova) before mounting. Images were acquired with either a Zeiss LSM700 (inverse) or a Leica SPE (upright; Leica Biosystems GmbH, Nussloch, Germany) using 40X oil immersion objectives. Z-stacks were taken at 1\u00a0\u03bcm z-step size, 35 steps to cover the whole thickness of the slice. Morphological analysis Morphological analysis of microglia was performed on 3-dimensional fluorescence images using Imaris\u2009\u00d7\u200964 version 9.6\u20139.9 (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland) algorithms. Microglial cells in which the nucleus was at least 15\u00a0\u00b5m away from the image border were selected for analysis. The modules \"Filament tracer\" and \"Surface\" were used for microglia reconstruction. A total of 50 cells from 3 different mice were analyzed for each group. The background was minimized with an appropriate filter width (20\u201340\u00a0\u00b5m) and the region of the analyzed cell was selected manually. The parameters Filament Length, Filament No, Dendrite Branch Pts, Filament No, Sholl Intersections, and Soma Volume were obtained from the specific values calculated by Imaris. Although tracing was performed automatically by the algorithm, we individually verified that processes originated from one defined cell. False connections were removed manually which were commonly less than 1%. The number of Sholl intersections was defined as the number of process intersecting concentric spheres, defining the spatial distribution of segments as a function of distance from the soma (Sholl analysis). All spheres have their center at the soma (beginning point) with a 5\u00a0\u00b5m step resolution for the spheres. Acute brain slice preparation Acute cortical brain slices were prepared as previously described [ 4 ]. In brief, mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation, and their brains removed and cooled in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing (in mM): 230 Sucrose, 2.5 KCl, 10 MgSO 4 , 0.5 CaCl 2 , 1.25 NaH 2 PO 4 , 26 NaHCO 3 , and 10 D-glucose, pH\u00a07.4; gassed with 95% O 2 / 5% CO 2 . Brains were then mounted on a vibratome (HM650V, Thermo Scientific, Massachusetts, USA), and 250\u00a0\u00b5m thick coronal brain slices were generated and kept at room temperature for experiments for up to 5\u00a0h in gassed ACSF containing (in mM): 134 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.3 MgCl 2 , 2 CaCl 2 , 1.26 K 2 HPO 4 , 26 NaHCO 3 , and 10 D-glucose (pH 7.4). Acute brain slices were used for patch clamp recordings and in situ 2-photon live-cell imaging. Two-photon imaging and laser lesioning Live imaging of microglial processes was performed on 250\u00a0\u00b5m coronal brain slices from  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009or  Nf1 flox/wt mice and their WT littermates using a custom-built two-photon laser-scanning microscope (Till Photonics, Gr\u00e4felfing, Germany). EGFP or eYFP was excited by a Chameleon Ultra II laser (Coherent, Dieburg, Germany) at a wavelength of 940\u00a0nm. A 40X water-immersion objective (NA 0.8, Olympus, Hamburg, Germany) was used, with scanned 60\u00a0\u00b5m thick z-stacks and a step size of 3\u00a0\u00b5m covering a field of 320\u2009\u00d7\u2009320\u00a0\u00b5m. Laser lesions were set to 40\u00a0\u00b5m under the slice surface in the cortex by focusing the laser beam, set to a wavelength of 810\u00a0nm and to maximum power in the selected imaging volume, and scanned until autofluorescence of the injured tissue was visible. This procedure resulted in lesions of\u2009~\u200920\u00a0\u00b5m in diameter in the middle of the observed region. For the recording of microglia surveillance, no laser lesion was performed. IGOR Pro 6.37 (Lake Oswego, USA) was used for data analysis as in Davalos et al. [ 13 ] and Madry et al. [ 42 ]. The sequences of 3D image stacks were converted into sequences of 2D images by a maximum intensity projection algorithm. Grayscale images were first converted into binary form using a threshold. For quantification of laser lesion-induced movements, microglial response to focal lesion was defined as EGFP\u2009+\u2009pixel count in a proximal circular region 45\u00a0\u00b5m around the lesion site over time (Rx(t)). Distal fluorescence of the first time point was determined within a diameter of 45\u00a0\u00b5m to 90\u00a0\u00b5m around the lesion site for normalization (Ry(0)). Microglial responses were represented as R(t)\u2009=\u2009(Rx(t)-Rx(0))/Ry(0). For the quantification of baseline surveillance, cells of interest were individually selected by manually drawing a region of interest (ROI) around an area including all their process extensions throughout the 20\u00a0min movie and erasing data around that ROI. Starting with the second frame, we subtracted from each binarized frame the preceding frame and counted the number of pixels\u2009<\u20090 (retracting\u2009=\u2009PR) and\u2009>\u20090 (extending\u2009=\u2009PE). The surveillance index for each frame is then given by the sum of PR ad PE. The surveillance index of a given cell was then calculated by averaging the indices of the first 20 images in the movie. For ramification index (RI), we used the equation RI\u2009=\u2009(peri/area)/(2*sqrt(pi/area)), where peri and area are respectively the perimeter and area of a given cell in pixels. For the quantification of these two parameters, the ImageAnalyzeParticles operation in IGOR Pro 6.37 was applied on binarized images in which all analyzed microglia were manually examined and, if necessary, somata and processes connected. Electrophysiological recordings A conventional patch-clamp amplifier was used (EPC9, HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany). Acute 250\u00a0\u00b5m coronal brain slices were prepared from  Nf1 flox/wt  and WT mice, and microglial cells were identified by their transgenic EYFP fluorescence on an epifluorescent microscope. Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glasses and had resistances of 4\u20146 MOhm. The following intracellular solution was used (in mM): KCl,\u00a0130; MgCl 2 ,\u00a02; CaCl 2 ,\u00a00.5; Na-ATP,\u00a02; EGTA,\u00a05; HEPES,\u00a010 and sulforhodamine 101,\u00a00.01 (Sigma Aldrich,) and had an osmolarity of 280\u2014290\u00a0mOsm/L adjusted to a pH of 7.3 with KOH. The extracellular solution contained (in mM): NaCl,\u00a0134; KCl,\u00a02.5; MgCl 2 ,\u00a01.3; CaCl 2 ,\u00a02; K 2 HPO 4 ,\u00a01.25; NaHCO 3 ,\u00a026; D-glucose,\u00a010; pH\u00a07.4; 310\u2014320\u00a0mOsm/L and was gassed with carbogen (95% O 2 / 5% CO 2 ). Experiments with series resistances less than\u2009~\u200965\u00a0MOhm were used for data analysis. All experiments were performed in the voltage-clamp configuration. To obtain current\u2013voltage curves during continuous recordings, the membrane was clamped every 5\u00a0s from a holding potential of -70 or -20\u00a0mV (before and during the ATP response, respectively) to a series of de- and hyperpolarizing voltages ranging from -140\u00a0mV to 60\u00a0mV with 20\u00a0mV increment, 100\u00a0ms in duration. Membrane currents were averaged for quantification between 30 and 45\u00a0ms after clamping the membrane to a given value from the resting potential. Membrane capacitance was quantified based on an exponential fit of the current decay in response to a -10\u00a0mV test pulse. The same pulse was used to quantify series resistance from the peak amplitude of the membrane capacitance currents. Comparisons of membrane currents between different groups were always normalized to the membrane capacitance. Microglia isolation by MACS 12\u201316\u00a0week male and female mice were transcardially perfused with ice-cold Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) to harvest the brain. Brains were subsequently homogenized at 0\u20134\u00a0\u00b0C in dissection buffer (HBSS, 45% glucose, 1\u00a0M HEPES) and cell pellets were resuspended in 25\u00a0ml of 22% Percoll (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). 5\u00a0ml PBS were added as a layer on top. Centrifugation was performed for 20\u00a0min at 950\u00a0g with medium acceleration and no brakes to remove myelin and debris. Pellets were resuspended in ice-cold MACS buffer and incubated with anti-mouse CD11b antibodies coupled to magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) for 15\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Cells were resuspended in MACS buffer and passed through medium-sized MACS columns (Miltenyi Biotech) attached to a magnet. The flow-through was discarded and the cells were flushed out of the columns in MACS buffer, collected by centrifugation, and stored at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C for cAMP ELISA. Mass spectrometry and proteomic analysis Global proteome analysis was conducted using isobaric TMTpro 16-plex labeling (Thermo Fisher Scientific) essentially as described in Mertins et al. [ 46 ]. Samples were lysed in urea buffer and digested with trypsin (Promega). Of each sample, 12\u00a0\u00b5g peptide was assigned to channels 1 through 13 as well as channel 15 in a randomized fashion. Channel 16 was used as a booster channel and loaded with 70\u00a0\u00b5g of a mix of the remaining peptide material. Channel 14 was kept empty. The combined TMT cassette was deeply fractionated using high-pH HPLC separation into 30 fractions using a 1290 Infinity II LC System (Agilent Technologies). An estimate of 1\u00a0\u00b5g of each fraction was injected into LC\u2013MS analysis on an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in data-dependent mode using a 110\u00a0min gradient on an EASY-nLC 1200 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with an in-house packed column (C18-AQ 1.9\u00a0\u00b5m beads,Dr. Maisch Reprosil-Pur 120). For database search, MaxQuant version 1.6.10.43 [ 12 ] was used whilst enabling TMTpro 16-plex reporter ion quantitation with a PIF setting of 0.5. Downstream analysis was done in R. For quantitation, a complete data matrix was required for the experimental conditions (14 out of 16 channels). Reporter ion\u00a0intensities were normalized and\u00a0scaled using median-MAD normalization.. For significance calling two-sample moderated t-tests were applied (limma R package; [ 56 ]. P-values were adjusted using the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg method. Statistics All data are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM. A combination of one-way ANOVA tests with Bonferroni post hoc tests were employed using Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) to compare data between the four experimental groups. Significance is given as *** p\u2009<\u20090.001, ** p\u2009<\u20090.01, * p\u2009<\u20090.05, n.s.\u00a0p\u2009>\u20090.05.",

  "introduction": "Introduction Microglia are highly adaptive cells, comprising 5% of the cells in the central nervous system, which serve numerous functions critical to brain homeostasis and response to disease [ 43 ,  68 ]. Changes in microglia function can originate from cell-intrinsic alterations in their innate properties or reactions to environmental stimuli (cell-extrinsic). For example, APOE4 genotype confers transcriptomic and functional alterations in primary mouse microglia in vitro [ 41 ], while microglia-specific ApoE loss reduces A-beta plaque size in a mouse model of Alzheimer\u2019s disease [ 28 ]. Conversely, neurons and macroglia (oligodendrocytes and astrocytes) can communicate with microglia to influence their migration and phagocytosis through the elaboration of paracrine factors (e.g., chemokines; [ 25 ,  52 ] and/or expression of cell surface proteins (e.g., CD47; [ 38 ]. This adaptability is underscored by multiple reports demonstrating that microglia can undergo changes in gene expression and function when they are analyzed in vitro relative to their in vivo state [ 6 ,  43 ,  49 ,  62 ]. In this fashion, understanding microglia function requires a consideration of both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous properties. We have previously demonstrated that microglia from mice heterozygous for a germline inactivating mutation in the Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene exhibit sexually dimorphic impairments in purinergic function [ 17 ,  18 ]. Using in situ analysis of microglia function, we showed that microglia from male, but not female,  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009mice exhibit impaired phagocytosis, ATP-evoked membrane currents, and lesion-induced process accumulation relative to their wild-type counterparts. While these results could be interpreted as revealing cell-intrinsic effects of  Nf1  mutation on microglia function, it is equally possible that the observed abnormalities result from indirect effects on microglia, operating through the impact of  Nf1  mutation on other cell types (astrocytes, neurons, oligodendrocytes). This idea derives from recent studies in which we found that neurons with a heterozygous  Nf1  mutation elaborate paracrine factors that act on T cells [ 21 ] and oligodendrocyte precursor cells [ 50 ] to modify their function. To distinguish cell-autonomous from non-cell-autonomous microglia defects, we leveraged two different Cre driver lines to heterozygously delete the  Nf1  gene in either microglia or neural progenitor cells and their progeny (astrocytes, neurons, oligodendrocytes) in vivo. Surprisingly, we found that heterozygous  Nf1  loss in microglia had no effect on microglia function, whereas heterozygous  Nf1  loss in neural progenitor cells (and their progeny) recapitulated the sexually dimorphic microglial defects observed in  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009mice.",
  "results": "Results Proteomic analysis reveals differences in microglial protein expression between male WT and  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009mice To define  Nf1 -dependent alterations in murine microglia, we performed an unbiased proteomic analysis. Microglia were isolated from whole brains of male and female WT and  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009mice (12- 16\u00a0weeks of age) by MACS using CD11b antibodies and subjected to proteomics analysis as previously described Mertins et al. [ 46 ] using TMTpro isobaric labeling. Hierarchical clustering of normalized intensities of all significantly differentially expressed proteins (adjusted p value: adj. p\u2009<\u20090.05) led to a clear separation into male and female, as well as WT and  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009subclusters (Fig.\u00a0 1 A), indicating that differences in microglia protein expression occurred between, rather than within, groups. Clustering of differentially expressed genes revealed three major clusters, where cluster 2 and 3 were dominated by morphology- and membrane-related Gene Ontology (GO) networks and cluster 1 by transcriptional and mRNA-modifying terms (Additional file  1 ). Interestingly, among the data set there was a large number of differentially expressed proteins between male WT and  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009microglia (2474), but none between female WT and  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009microglia (Fig.\u00a0 1 B). As expected, and in accordance with our previous studies [ 20 ,  65 ], there were sex-dependent differences in the proteomes from WT microglia (3165 significantly regulated proteins), which were eliminated in the context of  Nf1  mutation (only five significantly regulated proteins observed). Consistent with a heterozygous  Nf1  mutation, there was a\u2009~\u200950% reduction in neurofibromin expression in  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009relative to WT microglia (male: p\u2009=\u20090.0006; female: p\u2009=\u20090.0003; Fig.\u00a0 1 C). Fig. 1 Proteomic analysis reveals sex-specific differences in WT and  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009microglia  A:  Heatmap of significantly regulated proteins (adj. p\u2009<\u20090.05) in male and female WT and  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009microglia. Cluster analysis revealed high in-group similarities, indicating that each sample did highly correlate to samples from the same group and less to those from other groups. Furthermore, differentially expressed genes clustered into 3 different major clusters which are annotated and analyzed in more detail in Additional File  1 : Fig. S1.B: Number of significantly regulated proteins between the indicated pairwise comparisons. Note that there were many expressional differences between male WT and  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009, as well as between male and female WT, microglia. Only a few significant differences were found between male  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009vs. female  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009microglia and female WT vs. female  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009microglia.  C:  Comparison of  Nf1  protein levels in the analyzed samples. As expected,  Nf1  expression was reduced by\u2009~\u200950% in male and female  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009compared to WT samples.  D:  GO term analysis of proteins upregulated in male  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009compared to male WT microglia. Analysis was performed using Metascape [ 74 ]. Note that many terms refer to microglia morphology and surveillance.  E : Volcano Plot comparing proteomic data from male WT and  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009microglia. Position of  Nf1  is highlighted by an orange circle; those of the purinergic receptors  P2ry12 ,  P2rx4  and  P2rx7  by black squares Focusing more on male WT and  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009microglia, we performed a GO analysis of the 789 proteins with increased expression in male  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009versus WT microglia using Metascape [ 74 ]. Many of the GO terms were related to cytoskeletal organization (Fig.\u00a0 1 D), suggesting  Nf1 -dependent alterations in morphology or motility. Conversely, analysis of the downregulated proteins revealed GO terms that were associated with regulation of transcription and mRNA transport (Additional file  1 : Fig. S2. There were three purinergic receptors found in our proteomic data set;  P2ry12 ,  P2rx4  and  P2rx7 , and in accordance to data from our previous study, these proteins were not differentially expressed between WT and  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009groups (Fig.\u00a0 1 E). Fig. 2 Microglia surveillance is reduced in male  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009mice due to decreased ramification  A:  Sample images of male and female WT and  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009microglia during 2-photon live cell recording. The MacGreen transgenic mouse lines express GFP in microglia and the cells can be visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Each image is an overlay of the time points t\u2009=\u20090 (red) and t\u2009=\u200920\u00a0min (green), thus, process extensions appear in green, retractions in red and resting parts in yellow. Scale bars denote 10\u00a0\u00b5m.  B:  Time course of increase of the number of surveyed pixels in maximum-intensity projections of images of male ( left ) and female ( right ) WT and  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009microglia. The first value in the curves is equal to the area of the cell in the first image frame.  C:  Comparison of surveillance ( left ) and ramification ( right ) indices of microglia from male and female WT and  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009microglia.  D:  Microglia surveillance normalized to cell area is an expression of the process motility independently of ramification. Note that the normalized surveillance was not different between male WT and male  Nf1 \u2009+\u2009 / Male  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009microglia exhibit reduced surveillance and ramification Based on the proteomic pathway findings, we next analyzed microglial properties related to cytoskeletal organization. First, we examined surveillance in acute cortical slices from 12\u201316\u00a0week old male and female mice, as previously reported Madry et al. [ 42 ]. The microglial cells in the slices were identified by transgenic EGFP labeling in WT and  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009mice intercrossed with MacGreen (Csfr1-EGFP) mice. To avoid any bias toward microglia activation at the slice surface [ 24 ,  27 ], all experiments were performed on microglial cells located 50\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcm below the surface of the slice within 4\u00a0h of acute slice preparation. Consistent with the proteomic results, the determined surveillance parameters of male  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009microglia were reduced relative to their WT counterparts. The cumulative time courses of the surveyed area in maximum intensity projections (Fig.\u00a0 2 A and  B ) indicate that the initial rate of surveillance within 5\u00a0min was reduced in male  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009microglia (74\u2009\u00b1\u20096\u00a0\u00b5m 2 /min; n\u2009=\u2009106 cells/4 mice; p\u2009<\u20090.0001) relative to male WT microglia (129\u2009\u00b1\u20099 \u00b5m 2 /min; n\u2009=\u200953\u00a0cells/2 mice), and that the cumulative area surveyed after 40\u00a0min was also smaller in male  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009(1488\u2009\u00b1\u200975\u00a0\u00b5m 2 ; p\u2009<\u20090.0001) relative to male WT (2384\u2009\u00b1\u2009117\u00a0\u00b5m 2 ) microglia. Consequently, the surveillance index, which is a measure of the process retractions and extensions per unit time, was reduced in male  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009microglia (86.4\u2009\u00b1\u20095.1\u00a0\u00b5m 2 /min) compared to male WT microglia (153.5\u2009\u00b1\u20098.7\u00a0\u00b5m 2 /min; p\u2009<\u20090.0001; Fig.\u00a0 2 C). Second, we determined the ramification index, which is a normalized parameter expressing the ratio of the cell perimeter to the perimeter of a perfect circle with the same area as the cell and, thus, depends only on cell shape, rather than its overall size [ 36 ]. As shown in Fig.\u00a0 2 C, male  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009microglia had a ramification index (4.8\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1; n\u2009=\u2009106 cells/4 mice) that was smaller than that observed for male WT microglia (6.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2; n\u2009=\u200953\u00a0cells/2 mice; p\u2009<\u20090.0001). The number of surveyed pixels and the surveillance index (Fig.\u00a0 2 B and  C ) might depend on the number and length of microglia processes or their speed of movement [ 36 ,  42 ]. We therefore normalized the surveillance indices to the mean area of each cell and found that there were no differences between male WT (0.25\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02\u00a0min \u22121 ) and male  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009(0.23\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\u00a0min \u22121 , p\u2009=\u20090.3007) microglia (Fig.\u00a0 2 D). Based on these results, we conclude that the decreased surveillance of male  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009microglia largely arises from their decreased ramification, rather than altered cell motility. Importantly, in female mouse brains, there were no differences in the surveillance of WT and  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009microglia processes (Fig.\u00a0 2 A and  B , neither in the initial rates of surveillance (0\u20135\u00a0min; female WT: 134\u2009\u00b1\u200910\u00a0\u00b5m 2 /min; n\u2009=\u200978\u00a0cells/3\u00a0mice; female  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009: 108\u2009\u00b1\u20099\u00a0\u00b5m 2 /min; n\u2009=\u200995/3\u00a0mice; p\u2009=\u20090.0629) nor in the cumulative areas surveyed after 40\u00a0min (female WT: 2375\u2009\u00b1\u200990\u00a0\u00b5m 2 ; female  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009: 2242\u2009\u00b1\u200986\u00a0\u00b5m 2 ; p\u2009=\u20090.2891). In addition, the surveillance indexes were similar in female WT (162.1\u2009\u00b1\u20096.5) and  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009(146.7\u2009\u00b1\u20096.3; p\u2009=\u20090.0907) microglia. Taken together, these data demonstrate a sexually dimorphic reduction of ramification, resulting in reduced surveillance in  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009microglia. To explore microglia cytoskeleton-dependent processes in more detail, we analyzed microglial morphology in fixed male and female WT and  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009mouse cortical brain slices (Fig.\u00a0 3 ). Confocal images were taken with a 40X oil immersion objective on a Zeiss LSM700 inverse microscope at a resolution of 0.156\u2009\u00d7\u20090.156\u00a0x\u00a01\u00a0\u00b5m/voxel and an excitation wavelength of 639\u00a0nm. Three-dimensional rendering was applied using Imaris software (Fig.\u00a0 3 A) to perform 3D Scholl analysis and quantify the average soma volumes, total process lengths and number of branch points per cell. As observed with microglia surveillance and ramification, only microglia from male  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009mice were less ramified relative to their WT counterparts, as indicated by the quantification of intersected processes within Scholl spheres at increasing distances from the soma (n\u2009=\u200950 cells from 3\u00a0mice per group; Fig.\u00a0 3 B). This result reflects reduced number of branch points per microglia in male  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009(39\u2009\u00b1\u20091) compared to WT mice (61\u2009\u00b1\u20092; p\u2009<\u20090.0001; Fig.\u00a0 3 C), whereas female WT (48\u2009\u00b1\u20092) and female  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009(51\u2009\u00b1\u20091; p\u2009=\u20090.3627) microglia had similar numbers. In addition, the cumulative process length per microglia was longer in male WT microglia (782\u2009\u00b1\u200920\u00a0\u03bcm) relative to male  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009microglia (526\u2009\u00b1\u200914\u00a0\u03bcm; p\u2009<\u20090.0001; Fig.\u00a0 3 D), but no differences were observed between female WT (667\u2009\u00b1\u200917\u00a0\u03bcm) and female  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009(670\u2009\u00b1\u200914\u00a0\u03bcm; p\u2009=\u20090.9988) microglia. In contrast to microglia process ramification, heterozygous  Nf1  loss had no impact on microglial soma volumes (Fig.\u00a0 3 E), which were similar in male and female WT microglia (209\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u00a0\u03bcm 3  and 197\u2009\u00b1\u20097\u00a0\u03bcm 3 , respectively) and in  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009male and female microglia (196\u2009\u00b1\u20095 \u03bcm 3  and 198\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u00a0\u03bcm 3 , respectively). Collectively, these data provide additional support for a sex-by-genotype effect of  Nf1  heterozygosity on microglia process ramification. Fig. 3 Microglia morphology is altered in male  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009mice  A:  Representative confocal microscopic images (left) and 3-dimensional rendering (right) of a male WT and  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009microglial cell in the cortex (layer 2\u20136). Scale bars denote 20\u00a0\u00b5m.  B:  Sholl analysis of male ( top ) and female ( bottom ) WT and  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009microglia. The number of intersected processes was plotted against their distance from the soma. Male  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009cells have a significantly reduced number of Sholl intersections in a radius of 5\u201340\u00a0\u03bcm around the soma compared to male WT microglia.  C:  Summary of the number of intersections of male and female WT and  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009microglia.  D:  Summary of the total process length of male and female WT and  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009microglia.  E:  Summary of the soma volumes of male and female WT and  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009microglia. Number of quantified cells (mice): 50 (3) for each group Microglia morphology and function is not altered by microglia-intrinsic heterozygous  Nf1  loss To determine whether the observed  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009sexually dimorphic microglia alteration in ramification was a direct consequence of  Nf1  mutation on microglia biology (cell-intrinsic effect), we generated mice in which  Nf1  was heterozygously deleted in microglia (Fig.\u00a0 4 A). CX3CR1-Cre ER  [ 71 ] were intercrossed with  Nf1 flox/flox  [ 1 ] and R26R-EYFP mice [ 63 ] to generate litters heterozygous for Cre ER  expression from the CX3CR1 locus, a single conditional (flox)  Nf1  allele, and a conditional (LoxP-stop-LoxP; LSL) eYFP transgene in the Rosa26 locus ( Nf1 flox/wt ; Cx3cr1-Cre ER ; LSL-eYFP mice; termed  Nf1 Cx3cr1-Cre flox/wt ER  mice). Tamoxifen (100\u00a0mg/kg body weight) was intraperitoneally administered between P30 and P40 for five consecutive days to induce Cre recombinase activity in CX3CR1 +  cells. WT (Cx3cr1-Cre) mice had the same genotype ( Nf1 \u2009+\u2009/\u2009+\u2009; Cx3cr1-Cre ER ; LSL-eGFP), except they lacked a conditional  Nf1  allele. As a control for the successful activation of Cre ER  in WT and  Nf1 Cx3cr1-Cre flox/wt ER  mice by tamoxifen treatment, cortical brain slices were immunostained with Iba1 and YFP antibodies. We observed a clear induction of microglial YFP expression in mice treated with tamoxifen at both neonatal and adult stages (Fig.\u00a0 4 B). There was also weak expression of YFP in non-microglial cells, mainly in neuronal cells independent of Cre ER  activation, as YFP was also seen in CX3CR1 wt/wt  mice, which do not express Cre ER  recombinase (Additional file  1 : FigS3). These unexpected findings likely reflect non-specific, off-target, expression of YFP from the Rosa26 locus, as has been previously reported for other reporter strains [ 73 ]. Fig. 4 Microglia morphology is not altered by intrinsic  Nf1  reduction  A:  CX3CR1-Cre ER  mice were intercrossed with  Nf1 flox/flox  and R26R-EYFP to obtain litters that carry a heterozygous knock-in of Cre ER  at the CX3CR1 locus, a heterozygous knock-in of a flox cassette in the  Nf1  locus, and a homozygous, floxed eYFP transgene in the Rosa26 locus ( Nf1 Cx3cr1-Cre flox/wt ER ). Tamoxifen was administered between P30 and P40 on five consecutive days to activate Cre recombinase in microglia.  B:  Confocal microscopic images indicating the successful induction of microglial YFP reporter expression by tamoxifen treatment in the cortex of two male WT mice.

The number of intersected processes was plotted against their distance from the soma. There was no difference in the distribution of process branches around the soma between the four investigated groups.  D-F:  Summary of the number of intersections per cell (D), the total process length (E) and the soma volumes (F) for male and female WT and  Nf1 Cx3cr1-Cre flox/wt ER  microglia. Number of quantified cells (mice): 50 (3) for each group To determine the effect of heterozygous  Nf1  loss in microglia, cortical brain slices from male and female WT and  Nf1 Cx3cr1-Cre flox/wt ER  mice were analyzed (Fig.\u00a0 4 C). Confocal images were taken with a 40X oil immersion objective on a Leica SPE upright microscope at a resolution of 0.179\u2009\u00d7\u20090.179\u00a0x\u00a00.9\u00a0\u00b5m/voxel and an excitation wavelength of 635\u00a0nm. Three-dimensional rendering was applied using Imaris software to generate 3D quantification of microglia morphology. Interestingly, unlike microglia from  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009mice, in which  Nf1  is heterozygously deleted in all cells, neither male nor female  Nf1 Cx3cr1-Cre flox/wt ER  microglia exhibited changes in process ramification relative to their WT counterparts (Fig.\u00a0 4 C). Additionally, there were similar numbers of branch points per microglia in male  Nf1 Cx3cr1-Cre flox/wt ER  (38\u2009\u00b1\u20092, n\u2009=\u200950) relative to male WT (40\u2009\u00b1\u20092; n\u2009=\u200950; p\u2009=\u20090.3670; Fig.\u00a0 4 D) microglia, which were also similar in female WT (40\u2009\u00b1\u20092; n\u2009=\u200950) and female  Nf1 Cx3cr1-Cre flox/wt ER  (38\u2009\u00b1\u20091; n\u2009=\u200950; ANOVA p\u2009=\u20090.8230) microglia. Likewise, quantification of intersected processes within Scholl spheres at increasing distances from the soma revealed a similar distribution in microglia from  Nf1 Cx3cr1-Cre flox/wt ER  and WT mice of either sex (Fig.\u00a0 4 C). There was no difference in the cumulative process length per microglial cell (male WT: 588\u2009\u00b1\u200917\u00a0\u03bcm; male  Nf1 Cx3cr1-Cre flox/wt ER : 567\u2009\u00b1\u200916\u00a0\u03bcm; female WT: 650\u2009\u00b1\u200923\u00a0\u03bcm; female  Nf1 Cx3cr1-Cre flox/wt ER : 603\u2009\u00b1\u200917\u00a0\u03bcm; n\u2009=\u200950 cells/3\u00a0mice per group; ANOVA p\u2009=\u20090.0711; Fig.\u00a0 4 E). There was also no effect of microglia-restricted heterozygous  Nf1  loss on microglia soma volumes (Fig.\u00a0 4 F), which were similar in male and female WT (194\u2009\u00b1\u20096\u00a0\u03bcm 3  and 186\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u00a0\u03bcm 3 , respectively) and  Nf1 Cx3cr1-Cre flox/wt ER  (183\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u00a0\u03bcm 3  and 187\u2009\u00b1\u20097\u00a0\u03bcm 3 , respectively; ANOVA p\u2009=\u20090.0502) mice. Collectively, these data demonstrate that microglia-specific heterozygous  Nf1  loss does not affect microglial morphology. Second, to determine whether  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009microglial functional defects were cell-autonomous, we measured microglial responses in acute brain slices of adult (12\u00a0-16\u00a0weeks) male and female WT and  Nf1 Cx3cr1-Cre flox/wt ER  mice following a laser lesion by two-photon imaging (Additional File  1 : FigS4). The movement of microglial processes was quantified by determining the fluorescence distribution within the area of concentric circles (diameter: 20\u00a0\u00b5m and 90\u00a0\u00b5m) around the lesion site. In contrast to our previous findings using germline  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009mice [ 17 ,  18 ], YFP-based fluorescence in mice was much weaker; however, detection of process movements was still possible (Additional File  1 : Fig. S4A). No translocation of microglial cell bodies was seen during the observation period. In addition, similar to morphology (Fig.\u00a0 4 ), there were no defects in directed process motility of microglia from  Nf1 Cx3cr1-Cre flox/wt ER  mice. The process response of male WT microglia 30\u00a0min following laser lesion was 24.6\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8 (n\u2009=\u20098), which was not different from that observed in male  Nf1 Cx3cr1-Cre flox/wt ER  (25.4\u2009\u00b1\u20094.0; n\u2009=\u20098; p\u2009=\u20090.9097). There were also no differences in process movements of female WT (27.4\u2009\u00b1\u20095.3; n\u2009=\u20098) relative to female  Nf1 Cx3cr1-Cre flox/wt ER  microglia (23.7\u2009\u00b1\u20095.2; n\u2009=\u200912; p\u2009=\u20090.6275). Process movement in response to injury [ 17 ,  18 ,  20 ,  27 ,  42 ] is a P2RY12-mediated function in microglia [ 13 ,  48 ]. Microglial membrane current responses following the application of low (10\u00a0\u00b5M) ATP concentrations largely depend on P2RY12 activation [ 17 ,  18 ], which activates K +  currents through THIK-1 [ 3 ,  4 ,  20 ,  42 ,  67 ]. For these reasons, we analyzed purinergic responses of microglia in acute cortical slices from 12 to 16\u00a0weeks-old male and female  Nf1 Cx3cr1-Cre flox/wt ER  mice following tamoxifen administration at P30-40 using standard whole-cell patch clamp techniques in the voltage-clamp configuration. Microglial cells were identified in situ by eYFP fluorescence. WT and  Nf1 Cx3cr1-Cre flox/wt ER  microglial cells responded to 10\u00a0\u00b5M ATP with the induction of an outwardly rectifying current that reversed close to the equilibrium potential for potassium (Additional File  1 : Fig. S4D-F). We next assessed the specific conductance between\u2009+\u200920\u00a0mV and\u2009+\u200960\u00a0mV to compare these currents in male and female microglia. The conductance of microglial ATP-evoked potassium currents was 13.5\u2009\u00b1\u20094.6\u00a0pS/pF and 13.6\u2009\u00b1\u20092.3\u00a0pS/pF for male and female WT microglia, respectively (n\u2009=\u20093 and n\u2009=\u200911 cells, respectively; p\u2009=\u20090.9823, Additional File  1 : Fig. S3H). There were no differences in microglial purinergic responses in male  Nf1 Cx3cr1-Cre flox/wt ER  (15.0\u2009\u00b1\u20093.4\u00a0pS/pF; n\u2009=\u200914; p\u2009=\u20090.8550 vs. male WT) or female  Nf1 Cx3cr1-Cre flox/wt ER  (14.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.1\u00a0pS/pF; n\u2009=\u200914; p\u2009=\u20090.8060 vs. female WT) mice, indicating that the microglia-specific heterozygous  Nf1  loss has no impact on P2RY-dependent membrane responses. Additionally, we compared the membrane characteristics of male and female WT and  Nf1 Cx3cr1-Cre flox/wt ER  microglia, and repetitively patch clamped cortical microglia at potentials between \u2212170 and\u2009+\u200960\u00a0mV, starting from a holding potential of \u221270\u00a0mV. As shown in Additional File  1 : Fig. S5, current density\u2013voltage relations were characterized by a high input resistance and a small inwardly rectifying conductance between -40 and -170\u00a0mV, consistent with previous studies [ 33 ]. The reversal potentials, indicative of the resting membrane potential, were also similar among groups. There were no differences in the apparent membrane capacitance between the two sexes and genotypes. Taken together, these findings establish that the male microglia defects observed in  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009mice were unlikely to be cell-autonomous. Microglia defects result from heterozygous  Nf1  loss in other brain cells Based on the above findings, we considered the possibility that the sex by genotype effects reflected microglia responses to heterozygous  Nf1  mutation in other brain cells (e.g. neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes). To address this question, we generated mice in which  Nf1  is heterozygously deleted in non-microglial cells (neural progenitor cells by embryonic day 16.5, hGFAP-Cre mice; by intercrossing  Nf1 flox/flox  and hGFAP-Cre mice [ 1 ]). To investigate microglia morphology, cells were analyzed as before, to quantify average soma volume, total process length and the number of branch points per cell (Fig.\u00a0 5 ). Interestingly, microglia from male, but not female,  Nf1 flox/wt ; hGFAP-Cre mice had decreased ramification. The quantification of intersected processes within Scholl spheres at increasing distances from the soma (n\u2009=\u200950 cells from 3\u00a0mice per group; Fig.\u00a0 5 A) revealed fewer intersections within a distance of 15\u201340\u00a0\u00b5m from the soma in male  Nf1 flox/wt ; hGFAP-Cre, compared to WT microglia. In addition, the number of branch points per microglial cell was reduced in male  Nf1 flox/wt ; hGFAP-Cre (32\u2009\u00b1\u20091) compared to WT microglia (42\u2009\u00b1\u20091; p\u2009<\u20090.0001; Fig.\u00a0 5 B), whereas female WT (35\u2009\u00b1\u20091) and female  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009(35\u2009\u00b1\u20091; p\u2009>\u20090.9999) microglia were similar. Similar to  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009mice (see Fig.\u00a0 3 ), there was a sexually dimorphic decrease in the cumulative process lengths in male  Nf1 flox/wt ; hGFAP-Cre microglia (500\u2009\u00b1\u200914\u00a0\u03bcm) relative to male WT microglia (652\u2009\u00b1\u200916\u00a0\u03bcm; p\u2009<\u20090.0001; Fig.\u00a0 5 C), and no differences were observed between female  Nf1 flox/wt ; hGFAP-Cre (544\u2009\u00b1\u200916\u00a0\u03bcm) and female WT (530\u2009\u00b1\u200914\u00a0\u03bcm; p\u2009=\u20090.9018) microglia. In contrast to microglia process ramification, heterozygous  Nf1  loss in non-microglial cells had no impact on soma volume (Fig.\u00a0 5 D), which were similar in all groups (male WT: 185\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u00a0\u03bcm 3 , male  Nf1 flox/wt ; hGFAP-Cre: 178\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u00a0\u03bcm 3 , female WT: 189\u2009\u00b1\u20095 \u03bcm 3 , female  Nf1 flox/wt ; hGFAP-Cre: 178\u2009\u00b1\u20096\u00a0\u03bcm 3 , ANOVA p\u2009=\u20090.1818). Collectively, these findings indicate that the sex-by-genotype effects of  Nf1  reduction in microglia reflect the contributions of other cell types and are not cell-intrinsic to microglia.

  "discussion": "Discussion In the present study, we report proteomic changes and defects in cortical microglia process ramification in male, but not female,  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009mice. Using two different Cre driver lines, we demonstrate that the sexually dimorphic microglia defects observed in germline  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009mice do not originate from heterozygous  Nf1  loss in microglia, but rather reflect responses to signals from sex- and  Nf1 -dependent alterations in other cell types in the brain. Leveraging mice in which heterozygous  Nf1  loss occurs in neural progenitor cells and their progeny (neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes), but not in microglia, we show that heterozygous  Nf1  loss in the cellular environment mimics the sexually dimorphic microglia defects observed in germline  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009mice. Taken together, these observations suggest that environmental factors from other brain cells induce microglia responses important for the formation and progression of NF1-related brain dysfunction. Microglia are essential for the development and progression of numerous brain diseases [ 68 ], including neurodegenerative [ 72 ] and psychiatric disorders [ 44 ,  55 ], as well as brain tumors [ 23 ]; however, there is a great degree of heterogeneity between microglia associated with each brain disorder. In the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, microglia facilitate the destruction of neuronal networks due to their ability to prune synapses [ 29 ,  29 ,  30 ,  30 ,  34 ], whereas the loss of phagocytic and surveillance activity contributes to enhanced A\u00df plaque burden at later stages [ 35 ,  67 ]. Similarly, schizophrenia is initiated and closely linked to inflammatory mechanisms [ 10 ], leading to a pro-inflammatory microglial phenotype [ 44 ,  45 ]. In high-grade (malignant) gliomas, microglia are transcriptionally reprogrammed by tumor-derived factors and act as tumor-supporting cellular elements [ 22 ,  23 ,  68 ], whereas in low-grade gliomas, microglia are essential for tumor growth in response to cytokines released by T lymphocytes [ 7 ,  14 ,  21 ,  51 ]. The findings in the current study exclude a cell-autonomous effect of heterozygous  Nf1  loss on microglia. As such,  Nf1  differs from other genes that directly affect microglia function through intrinsic mechanisms, such as  Cx3cr1  [ 52 ,  53 ],  P2ry12  [ 27 ,  61 ],  Gabbr1  [ 19 ],  Chrm3  [ 11 ],  Apoe  [ 28 ],  Tgfbr2  [ 75 ],  Bmal1  [ 66 ],  Il6  [ 57 ] , Il10  [ 31 ,  70 ] or  Bdnf  [ 47 ]. It should, however, be noted that all of these genes \u2013 in addition to their microglia-intrinsic effects\u2014can also alter the behavior and function of non-microglial cells in a cell-autonomous fashion. Similarly, defects in neuronal  Bdnf  or  Bmal1  expression [ 26 ] [ 60 ] or macroglia cells [ 16 ] can influence microglia function. In contrast, microglia can also respond to genetic mutation in other cell types: whereas microglia in a mouse model of Rett\u2019s syndrome ( Mecp2 -/-) excessively engulf, and thereby eliminate, presynaptic inputs at end stages of disease, conditional loss of  Mecp2  in microglia had little effect on synapse loss [ 59 ]. In addition, conditional loss of the calcitonin receptor ( Calcr ) in proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons of the hypothalamus leads to increased body weight gain, increased adiposity, and glucose intolerance [ 8 ] as a result of microglial  IL-6  release [ 32 ,  37 ]. However,  Calcr  loss in selective in microglia had no effect on body weight or glucose tolerance (Coester et al .  2022). In the setting of  Nf1  heterozygosity, it is most likely that non-microglial cells (astrocytes, neurons or oligodendrocytes) are the initiating elements for the observed microglia morphological and functional changes. We acknowledge that it is conceivable that  Nf1  mutational effects on microglia might require heterozygous  Nf1  loss during embryonic development, prior to the Cre-mediated excision time point chosen for our experiments, which would require additional experimentation. Nonetheless, the simplest explanation for our findings suggest that normal microglia have the capacity to respond to paracrine or cell surface-bound cues provided by male  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009neurons or macroglia. In keeping with this mechanism, we found that  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009neurons secrete midkine, which can induce the expression of Ccl4 in both wild type and  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009T cells (Guo et al .  2019). Further investigation will be required to determine whether both male and female wild type microglia can alter their biological properties in response to  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009neurons or macroglia, or whether this sex by gene effect operates at the level of the neuron (or microglia). To this end, we have previously demonstrated sexually dimorphic differences between male and female  Nf1 \u2009\u00b1\u2009neurons [ 15 ], which reflect sex by genotype effects on cyclic AMP generation and dopamine homeostasis. Additional studies will be necessary to determine whether differences in neuronal dopamine (or other paracrine factors) underlie the sexually dimorphic differences observed in microglia [ 2 ,  19 ,  39 ,  40 ,  64 ,  69 ]. Understanding how this intercellular crosstalk is established and maintained will provide new insights into our understanding of sex differences and the interplay between risk factors and cellular function in the brain.",
