  "title": "Capturing the wide variety of impaired fracture healing phenotypes in Neurofibromatosis Type 1 with eight key factors: a computational study.",
  "abstract": "Congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia (CPT) is a rare disease which normally presents itself during early childhood by anterolateral bowing of the tibia and spontaneous tibial fractures. Although the exact etiology of CPT is highly debated, 40-80% of CPT patients are carriers of a mutation in the Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) gene, which can potentially result in an altered phenotype of the skeletal cells and impaired bone healing. In this study we use a computational model of bone regeneration to examine the effect of the Nf1 mutation on bone fracture healing by altering the parameter values of eight key factors which describe the aberrant cellular behaviour of Nf1 haploinsufficient and Nf1 bi-allelically inactivated cells. We show that the computational model is able to predict the formation of a hamartoma as well as a wide variety of CPT phenotypes through different combinations of altered parameter values. A sensitivity analysis by \"Design of Experiments\" identified the impaired endochondral ossification process and increased infiltration of fibroblastic cells as key contributors to the degree of severity of CPT. Hence, the computational model results have added credibility to the experimental hypothesis of a genetic cause (i.e. Nf1 mutation) for CPT.",

  "methods": "Materials and Methods The multiscale computational model of bone regeneration was established previously and has been described in detail elsewhere 14 17 . In brief, at the tissue level the various key processes of bone regeneration are captured with 10 partial differential equations (PDEs) of the taxis-reaction-diffusion type which describe the evolution in time and space of the mesenchymal stem cell density ( c ), fibroblast density ( m c ), chondrocyte density ( f c ), osteoblast density ( c c ), fibrous matrix density ( b m ), cartilaginous matrix density ( f m ), bone matrix density ( c m ), generic osteochondrogenic growth factor concentration ( b g ), vascular growth factor concentration ( bc g ) and oxygen tension ( v n ). Note that only one generic osteochondrogenic growth factor ( g ) is included, which represents the effect of multiple growth factors present in the fracture callus. The influence of this generic growth factor on differentiation is either chondrogenic or osteogenic depending on the local oxygen tension. bc The formation of the blood vessel network is modelled at the level of the individual endothelial cell with a discrete agent-based approach. The computational model includes three different processes that determine the development of the discrete vascular tree, i.e. sprouting (the formation of a new branch, headed by a \u201ctip cell\u201d or \u201cleader cell\u201d), vascular growth (the extension of the branch due to the growth of \u201cstalk cells\u201d or \u201cfollower cells\u201d) and anastomosis (the fusion of two branches). The sprouting behaviour of the endothelial cells is derived from the agent-based model of Bentley  et al. 18  and is captured with eight intracellular variables, which are unique to every endothelial cell ( Fig. 1B ). The growth of a blood vessel is modelled by computing the movement of the corresponding tip cell where the tip cell speed depends on the active VEGFR-2 concentration and the tip cell direction is influenced by chemotactic (angiogenic growth factor) and haptotactic (collagen fibres in the extracellular matrix) signals. When a tip cell encounters another blood vessel or when it migrates outside the geometrical domain (illustrated in  Fig. 1C\u2013D ), an anastomosis is formed during which the leading endothelial cell loses its tip cell phenotype. The newly established connection between the vessels allows for blood flow and the delivery of oxygen and nutrients. Only the endothelial cells that are part of a vascular loop are sources of oxygen. The geometrical domain of the computational model is deduced from the real callus geometry at three weeks post-fracture in a standardised femoral rat fracture model 19 . We assume a simplified axisymmetrical representation of the geometry so that only a quarter of the domain is simulated ( Fig. 1C\u2013D ). The parameter values are derived from extensive literature reviews where possible and estimated if no relevant data was available 13 14 15 16 . Both the model variables and the parameter values were non-dimensionalised using proper scaling factors and will be described in their non-dimensionalised form throughout this work 13 14 15 16 . After non-dimensionalisation, the system was also complemented by suitable initial and boundary conditions to ensure the existence, uniqueness and non-negativity of the solution ( Fig. 1D ). To examine the effect of the  Nf1  mutation on bone fracture healing, the parameter values of the factors describing the aberrant cellular behaviour of  Nf1  haploinsufficient and  Nf1  bi-allelically inactivated cells were altered ( Table 1 ). A wide range of parameter values (Nf1 range) was investigated to account for the variable proportion of  Nf1  haploinsufficient and  Nf1  bi-allelically inactivated cells in the pseudarthrosis region. In particular, a larger deviation of the parameter values from the normal case represents a higher proportion of bi-allelically inactivated cells. In the current study we have investigated the influence of eight factors described in the literature as contributors to the poor fracture healing outcome in CPT. These factors include the increased invasion of fibrous lesion cells ( c ) f,BC 1 , increased fibroblastic proliferation ( A ) f 0 1 , increased fibroblastic differentiation ( F 4 ) 23 , reduced osteogenic differentiation ( Y 11 ) 1 9 , reduced endochondral ossification ( Y 3 ) ,cb 1 , reduced cartilage formation ( P ) mc 1 , increased fibrous tissue formation ( P ) mf 23  and increased angiogenic growth factor production ( G ) gvc 1 10 . In order to determine the (relative) importance of the eight factors listed in  Table 1 , a large sensitivity analysis using \u201cDesign of Experiments\u201d (DOE) was conducted 24 25 . DOE (or experimental design) is a statistical tool that generates an array of combinations of different parameter values within a predefined parameter space. Next, the computer simulations were performed with these parameter combinations, utilizing high-performance computational resources provided by the VSC (Flemish Supercomputer Center). Finally the results were statistically analysed. Since the computational model of bone regeneration is highly non-linear and uniform designs also cope well with the addition and removal of runs, a uniform design was chosen for the sensitivity analysis. The parameter space ( Table 1 , Nf1 range) was determined by varying the parameter values of the eight factors mostly in one direction with respect to the normal case, in this way biasing the DOE design to a CPT phenotype. Using the parameter ranges listed in  Table 1  (Nf1 range), a uniform design with 200 runs, i.e. 200 parameter combinations, was generated (see also  supplementary material ). The space-filling design evenly spreads out the parameter combinations over the eight-dimensional parameter space which can be checked with scatterplots and histograms ( Fig. 2 ). The responses (i.e. model outcomes) that were studied in the sensitivity analysis are listed in  Table 2  (see also  supplementary material ). In order to calculate the tissue fractions, the spatial images were first made binary using tissue-specific thresholds (0 means that the tissue is not present and 1 means that the tissue is present in a grid cell). Subsequently, an equal weight was assigned to the different tissues, i.e. if a grid cell contained three tissues, the area of that grid cell was divided by three in the final calculations of the tissue (area) fractions. Since a pseudarthrosis is defined by the tissues present in the fracture gap area (1a-2-3a in  Fig. 1D ), all the responses were calculated for this area. An additional response \u201cCI\u201d (complication index) was introduced to assess the degree of severity of CPT (Equation  1 ). More specifically, the CI ( ) combines two continuous responses (i.e. the amount of fibrous tissue   and fibroblasts  , each varying between 0 and 1 for a low and high amount respectively) with a Boolean response   (i.e. bony union or non-union represented by 0 or 1 respectively): A typical parameter combination for which the value of the CI is small is one or which the degree of severity of CPT is small, or in other words, when the fracture healing proceeds fairly normally. Conversely, a typical parameter combination for which the value of the CI is large, is one for which the degree of severity of CPT is large, or in other words, when the fracture healing is severely impaired. The uniform designs were generated and analysed with JMP (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA) using a Gaussian process with a Gaussian covariance function. Unlike an ANOVA-type of analysis, Gaussian processes do not only estimate the importance of individual parameters, but also the influence of the parameters on the outcome of a model. Hence, a Gaussian process will determine the best-fitting statistical model that can predict the model outcome for a certain combination of input parameters ( Figs 3 ,  4 ,  5 ). Since the result of a Gaussian process is a statistical model, care should be taken when interpreting the predictions. In order to assess the accuracy of the statistical predictions an actual versus predicted plot generated by JMP is helpful. In this plot the actual results, i.e. the outcomes calculated by the computational model, are compared with those predicted by the statistical model ( Fig. 3 ). In a perfect statistical fit, all the points would be located on a 45-degree line.  Fig. 3  (left) shows that the statistical model predicts a good fit for the CI response on Day 7. However, the Gaussian model does not capture the number of fibroblasts on Day 7 well, as illustrated by the large deviations from the 45-degree line in  Fig. 3  (right). Since the statistical predictions are accurate for all outcomes except the number of fibroblasts on Day 7 and Day 21 (results not shown), the results on the number of fibroblasts on Day 7 and Day 21 will not be used for further interpretation.",

  "results": "Results A non-union resembling a CPT phenotype was predicted by the computational model when all the parameter values were altered according to  Table 1  (Nf1 case). Due to the hampered osteogenic and endochondral ossification, a limited number of osteoblasts were formed resulting in a non-union ( Fig. 4C\u2013F ). The fracture site was however predicted to be filled with chondrocytes and fibroblasts which resulted in the formation of a fibrocartilaginous \u2018hamartoma\u2019 ( Fig. 4D,E ). Although plenty of chondrocytes were present, the amount of cartilage was limited due to the impaired formation of cartilage matrix ( Fig. 4B ). The main effects, i.e. the most important factors that influence a specific outcome of the model, are summarised in  Table 3 . Note that the number of fibroblasts on Day 7 and Day 21 were not well predicted by the statistical model and thus not used for further interpretation. Since the bone tissue fraction was zero on Day 7, the statistical model did not calculate any main effects for this response. The most important factors influencing the defined responses were  P  (rate of cartilage formation),  mc A  (rate of fibroblastic proliferation),  f0 P  (rate of fibrous tissue formation),  mf c  (duration of fibroblast invasion) and  f_BC Y  (rate of endochondral ossification). The factors  3cb F  (rate of fibroblastic differentiation),  4 Y  (rate of osteogenic differentiation) and  11 G  (rate of angiogenic growth factor production) contributed less to the outcomes of the defined response space. The factor  gvc P  influenced all outcomes except the amount of fibrous tissue on Day 7 and the CI on Day 7. As a result this factor appeared to be crucial for the fracture healing outcome and was studied in more detail. mc In order to study the main effects of the CI response in more detail, marginal model plots are a helpful tool. These plots show the actual and predicted values of the output variable as a function of only one factor when disregarding the influence of other factors.  Figure 5  shows the marginal model plots for the CI value as a function of  c ,  f_BC A ,  f0 F ,  4 Y ,  11 Y ,  3cb P ,  mc P  and  mf G . Firstly, it can be noted from  gvc Figs 5 ,  6  that a wide range of CI values (0.01-0.89) were predicted by the computational model. Secondly,  Fig. 5  shows that the dots, indicating the actual values of the CI response, split into two classes, one for which the CI value was high, resulting in impaired healing and one for which the CI value was low. For the factors  c ,  f_bc A ,  f0 F ,  4 Y ,  11 P ,  mf G , dots were present in both classes, regardless of their respective parameter values. However, for cartilage formation ( gvc P ) values below 0.05 and endochondral ossification ( mc Y ) values below 200, the CI value was always high, leading to an impaired bone healing phenotype ( 3cb Fig. 5 , arrows). Therefore,  Y  and  3cb P  discriminated between the two classes (which also corresponded to the results of  mc Table 3 ). Y  and  3cb P  also discriminated between the high and low CI values on Day 35 and Day 49 ( mc Fig. 6 ). However, on Day 35 and Day 49 some low CI values were predicted for  P  and  mc Y  parameter values below 0.05 and 200 respectively ( 3cb Fig. 6 , arrows). A closer look at the marginal model plots of the CI value on Day 49 showed that the influence of  Y  and  3cb P  can be modulated by other factors ( mc Fig. 7 ). The green circle shown in  Fig. 7  represents a single case where a low CI value was calculated even though the cartilage formation ( P ) value was low. Indeed, the limited cartilage production rate ( mc P ) was compensated by a relatively high endochondral ossification rate ( mc Y ). Furthermore, the duration of fibroblast infiltration ( 3cb c ) and the rate of fibroblast proliferation ( f_BC A ) were low, which resulted in a small number of fibroblasts and a low CI value. f0 Interestingly,  c  values below 10 led to intermediate values of the CI response ( f_BC Fig. 8 , arrow). The actual dots still belonged to the upper class but did not span the entire range of high CI values. Moreover, the CI values of these simulations were even reduced on Day 35 and Day 49. Consequently, a non-dimensional value of  c  above 10 was imperative for CI values above 0.5 and especially at later time points. f_BC",
  "discussion": "Conclusion In this study we used a well-established multiscale computational model of bone regeneration to integrate the state-of-the-art experimental knowledge on the effect of the  Nf1  mutation on bone fracture healing. We have shown that by altering the parameter values of eight key factors, attributed in the literature to the presence of a  Nf1  mutation, all the distinctive characteristics of a pseudarthrosis can be predicted, i.e. the formation of a hamartoma including a large quantity of fibrous tissue, some cartilage and limited endochondral ossification. Furthermore, the computational model is able to capture a wide variety of impaired fracture healing phenotypes associated with  Nf1  through different combinations of altered parameter values. A large sensitivity analysis using \u201cDesign of Experiments\u201d (DOE) identified that an impaired endochondral ossification process and an increased infiltration of fibroblastic cells are key elements for the development of a congenital pseudarthrosis in the computational model. Hence, the computational model results have added credibility to the experimental hypothesis of a genetic cause (i.e.  Nf1  mutation) for CPT. Future research efforts should be focused on the characterisation of the endochondral ossification pathway in  Nf1  haploinsufficient and  Nf1  bi-allelically inactivated cells and that of the  in vivo  fracture healing microenvironment of CPT patients as well as on the identification of other potential mechanisms of action in order to obtain a full understanding of the etiology of CPT and improve current treatment strategies.",
