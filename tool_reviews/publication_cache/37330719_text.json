  "title": "Existing and Developing Preclinical Models for Neurofibromatosis Type 1-Related Cutaneous Neurofibromas.",
  "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is caused by a nonfunctional copy of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene that predisposes patients to the development of cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs), the skin tumor that is the hallmark of this condition. Innumerable benign cNFs, each appearing by an independent somatic inactivation of the remaining functional NF1 allele, form in nearly all patients with NF1. One of the limitations in developing a treatment for cNFs is an incomplete understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and limitations in experimental modeling. Recent advances in preclinical in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo modeling have substantially enhanced our understanding of cNF biology and created unprecedented opportunities for therapeutic discovery. We discuss the current state of cNF preclinical in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo model systems, including two- and three-dimensional cell cultures, organoids, genetically engineered mice, patient-derived xenografts, and porcine models. We highlight the models' relationship to human cNFs and how they can be used to gain insight into cNF development and therapeutic discovery.",
