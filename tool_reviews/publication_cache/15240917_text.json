  "title": "Survival of Human Neurofibroma in Immunodeficient Mice and Initial Results of Therapy With Pirfenidone.",
  "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type I is a common tumor predisposing disease in humans. Surgical therapy can be applied only in selected patients with resectable masses. Hence, development of new therapies for this disease is urgent. We used human neurofibroma implants in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) as a model to test the toxicity and potential efficacy of pirfenidone, a new therapeutic agent. Two hundred twelve human neurofibromas were transplanted into various locations in 59 experimental animals, and 30 mice with implants received oral pirfenidone for up to six weeks. Survival of neurofibromas in animals treated with pirfenidone was lower than in the control group $(P=.02)$. Tumors did not change histologic appearance or vascularization in response to pirfenidone. Treatment with pirfenidone, a new antifibrotic agent, inhibits survival of some tumors without causing toxicity in animals.",

  "methods": "MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals Mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) were\nused as recipients of human neurofibroma\nxenotransplants.  SCID mice have a deficiency in the\nDNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), which results in\ninefficient recombination of DNA ends generated during\nthe course of antigen receptor recombination [ 15 ].\nThis defect blocks lymphopoiesis at early stages of T-\nand B-cell development and prevents the mounting of\nimmune responses against the grafts. Two hundred twelve human neurofibromas were transplanted into\nvarious locations in 59 experimental animals, 30 in the\nepineurium of the sciatic nerve, and 182 under the skin of the\nneck, back, and skin of the ear.  Thirty mice with implants\nreceived oral pirfenidone for up to six weeks, and 29 animals\nwere monitored for survival of tumors without therapy. Human neurofibromas Human neurofibromas were obtained from four patients with\nneurofibromatosis who underwent removal of plexiform neurofibroma\ndue to pain, compression, or other clinical indications.  One\ntumor was described as a nodular plexiform neurofibroma, while\nthe other 3 had appearance of diffuse plexiform neurofibroma.\nTumor tissue that would normally be discarded was used for these\nexperiments.  Each tumor was initially evaluated by frozen\nsection histology, and if confirmed to be a neurofibroma, tumor\ntissue was prepared for implantation.  The size of the tumors\nranged from 2\u2009cm to 4\u2009cm at the greatest diameter.  The\ntissue was placed into sterile culture medium with an antibiotic\nand cut into 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2\u2009mm (1\u20132 milligrams)\npieces.  Two hundred and twelve tumor fragments were obtained by\ncutting neurofibromas originating from four different patients.\nTumors were weighed and measured by a caliper (two largest\nperpendicular diameters) before implantation.  Part of the tumor\nwas evaluated by histology as described below. Surgical procedure Surgical procedures were conducted under sterile conditions.\nEach mouse was anesthetized using 5% halothane inhalation\nfollowed by 1%\u20132% halothane for maintenance. Tumor fragments\nwere implanted subcutaneously in the area of back, neck, and on\nthe posterior surface of the ear.  Prior to incision, the skin\nwas thoroughly cleaned with 70% ethanol and Betadine solution.\nIncisions were performed longitudinally oriented on the skin of\ndesignated areas. The implantation pockets were dissected with\nmicroscissors. Care was taken to minimize mechanical trauma to\nthe graft. After implantation of the tumor grafts, skin was\nclosed with resorbable (Chromic catgut 5/0) suture.  We used\nmethod previously described by Lee et al for implantation of\nneurofibroma fragment into the epineurium of the sciatic nerve\n[ 16 ].  Tumor implants were secured with a Prolene 8/0\nsurgical suture. Pirfenidone therapy Tumors were implanted in four different occasions, depending on\navailability of the human donor. After the implantation of\nxenografts from each donor, animals were randomized into two\ngroups.  Thirty SCID mice with implanted tumor fragments in\nvarious body locations were treated with oral pirfenidone (at a\ndose of 500\u2009mg/kg per day).  Therapy was initiated the second\nday after tumor implantation.  The remaining 29 untreated mice \nwith implants from the same tumors were used as controls. Assessment of tumor growth The animals with tumor implants in the epineurium\nand under the skin of neck and back were followed for up to\nsix weeks.  The survival and size of tumor implants in\nsubcutaneous locations were assessed by external palpation\nthrough the skin of the neck and back and measurement of the\nperpendicular diameters prior to tumor removal. Animals were sacrificed 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 weeks after tumor\nimplantation.  Neurofibroma implants were recovered,\nweighed, and measured for the largest surface area.  Tumor\ntissue was prepared for routine histology and\nimmunostaining.  The authors were masked to a treatment\nstatus of animals at the time of tumor measurement to\nminimize bias. Two animals with tumor implants under the skin of ear were\nfollowed for twelve months without therapy.  Tumor appearance and\nsize of tumors were assessed by inspection and direct outside\nmeasurement of the two largest perpendicular diameters and\ncalculation of area, using a caliper with 0.025\u2009mm accuracy\n(Skilltech, Hempe Manufacturing Co, Inc, New Berlin,\nWis) ( Figure 1a ). Measurements were performed two weeks \nafter implantation and then monthly thereafter. Figure 1 (a) Viability of human neurofibroma xenograft in SCID mouse ear for 12 months after\nimplantation, without therapy with pirfenidone.  Human\nneurofibromas confirmed by frozen section histology were cut in\n2 \u00d7 2\u2009mm pieces and implanted subcutaneously into the\near of SCID mice.  Tumor size was assessed by inspection and\ndirect outside measurement of the two largest perpendicular\ndiameters and area calculation, using a caliper with 0.025\u2009mm\naccuracy. (b) Neurofibroma xenotransplants in the ear were stable\nin size for twelve months after implantation. The line shows an\naverage size of four tumor implants in the ears, based on area calculation. Figure 2 Evaluation for content of collagen in human neurofibroma\nxenografts in SCID mouse.  Sections from formalin-fixed,\nparaffin-embedded tissues were stained with Masson's Trichrome\nand slides were examined using a brightfield microscope.  Original\ntumor tissue  (a) and the xenotransplant recovered 6 weeks after\nimplantation without therapy (b) or with pirfenidone\ntreatment (c). Samples from the original tumor and 6-week-old\nimplants were stained with Trichrome suggesting the presence of\nsimilar content of collagen.  Tumors recovered from animals\ntreated with pirfenidone did not display difference in Trichrome\nstaining, suggesting that 6-week therapy did not influence the\ncontent of collagen. Figure 3 Localization of S-100 in human neurofibroma transplanted\ninto SCID mouse.  Tissue samples from original tumors and from\nhuman neurofibroma xenografts were snap-frozen, cryo-sectioned,\nstained with rabbit antibodies specific for human S-100 and\nstudied by immunofluorescence microscopy.  Fluorescence is\nlocalized in Schwann cells in the original tumor (a) and in tumor\nxenografts recovered 6 weeks after implantation from nontreated\nanimal (b) and from animal receiving pirfenidone (c). The\npresence of S-100 in the xenografts confirms persistence of\nSchwann cells in implanted tumors. Positivity for S-100 was not\nchanged by treatment with pirfenidone for 6 weeks. Figure 4 GS IB4 lectin binding in human neurofibroma\nimplanted into SCID mouse.  Sections from formalin-fixed,\nparaffin-embedded tissues from original tumors and from human\nneurofibroma xenografts were incubated with\nfluorescein-conjugated IB4. Slides were examined using an\nepifluorescent microscope. Fluorescence indicates binding of\nlectin to Gal \u03b1 1-3Gal on blood vessel cells of nonprimates.\nOriginal human tumor (a) does not show fluorescence. Human\nneurofibroma xenotransplant from nontreated animal  (b) and human\nneurofibroma xenotransplant from animal treated with pirfenidone\nfor 6 weeks (c) show fluorescence suggesting that vessels were of\nhost origin since they bound GS IB4.  The host origin\nof blood vessels was not changed in response to therapy with pirfenidone. Table 1 Survival of human neurofibroma xenografts in different locations of SCID mice, without therapy.

Histology and immunohistochemistry Tumor specimens were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin,\n pH  = 7.2, for up to 18 hours at room temperature (RT), then\nembedded in paraffin using a tissue processor (model PTP 1530,\nVentana Medical Systems, Tucson, Ariz). Sections prepared from\nthese blocks were placed on positively charged microscope slides\n(Superfrost Plus, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, Pa). The\nsections were then deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated\nusing graded ethanol solutions.  For immunohistochemical methods,\nendogenous peroxidase was quenched by incubation of the sections\nwith 1.5%   H  in 50% methanol. 2 O 2 Human S-100 A and B protein was detected using rabbit antiserum\n(Dako Corp, Carpinteria, Calif) diluted with phosphate-buffered\nsaline (PBS),  pH  = 7.2, containing 5% bovine serum\nalbumin (BSA), and applied to sections.  The rabbit anti-S-100\nantibodies were detected using affinity purified biotinylated\nF(ab')2 swine anti-rabbit IgG (Dako), followed by horseradish\nperoxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Dako), both diluted in 5%\nPBS/BSA. Specimens were counterstained with alum-hematoxylin\nsolution, dehydrated using graded ethanols, cleared in xylene,\nand coverslipped with a synthetic mounting medium. Binding of  Griffonia Simplicifolia  (GS) lectin\nI, isolectin B4 (IB4), a lectin which binds to Gal \u03b1 1-3Gal in porcine tissues, was\ntested in tissue sections prepared as described above [ 17 ].\nThe sections were treated with a microwave-assisted carbohydrate\nrevealing (MCR) by incubating them with 75\u2009mL of\n10\u2009mM citric acid,  pH  = 6.0, and subjecting them to\nmicrowave at high power (800 watt, Panasonic, Secaucus, NJ) inside a beaker \ncontaining 400\u2009mL distilled water up to 15 minutes. The volume was maintained at a\nconstant level during heating by the addition of distilled water\nas required.  Sections were then incubated for 15 minutes at RT\nwithin the residual solution prior to application of the lectin.\nFluorescein-conjugated IB4 (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame,\nCalif) diluted in PBS,  pH  = 7.2, containing 5% BSA, was\napplied to the sections at RT for one hour and then rinsed with\nPBS. Slides were then coverslipped with a 1 : 8 dilution of\nVectashield-DAPI (1.5\u2009 \u03bc g/mL\n4, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, Vector Laboratories) in PBS,\n pH  = 8.6, and stored in the dark at 4 \u00b0 C. Sections\nfrom formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were also stained\nwith hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson's Trichrome\n[ 18 ]. Slides were examined using a brightfield or\nepifluorescent  microscope, and digital photomicrographs were\nobtained utilizing a high-resolution CCD digital camera (SPOT II,\nDiagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, Mich) mounted to the microscope\n(Leica DMRD, Leica Microsystems, Inc, Bannockburn, Ill) and SPOT II software.
