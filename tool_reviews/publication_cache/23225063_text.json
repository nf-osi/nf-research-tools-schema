  "abstract": "Dopamine deficiency underlies learning deficits in neurofibromatosis-1 mice.  Diggs-Andrews KA(1), Tokuda K, Izumi Y, Zorumski CF, Wozniak DF, Gutmann DH.  Author information: (1)Departments of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis,  MO 63110, USA.  Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are prone to learning and  behavioral abnormalities, including problems with spatial learning and  attention. The molecular etiology for these deficits is unclear, as previous  studies have implicated defective dopamine, cyclic adenosine monophosphate  (cAMP), and Ras homeostasis. Using behavioral, electrophysiological, and primary  culture, we now demonstrate that reduced dopamine signaling is responsible for  cAMP-dependent defects in neuron function and learning. Collectively, these  results establish defective dopaminergic function as a contributing factor  underlying impaired spatial learning and memory in children and adults with NF1,  and support the use of treatments that restore normal dopamine homeostasis for  select individuals.
