  "methods": "Methods Animal studies All mice were housed in the Animal Care Facility at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, and all procedures were approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and conformed to NIH guidelines. All mice strains were maintained in a room with 12/12 (day/night) light cycle with a temperature of 70\u201372\u2009\u00b0F.  K14 Cre mice were available from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). All mice were maintained on a mix C57bl/6 background. DMBA/TPA treatment was performed according to Abel et al. . using a single dose of DMBA (25\u2009\u03bcg) and a bi-weekly schedule for TPA (4\u2009\u03bcg) over 23 weeks. The  22 PLP CreERT2;  Nf1 f/\u2212 ;  ROSA -LacZ mice  was conditionally activated with a single subcutaneous dose of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (40\u2009\u03bcg) dissolved in 100% ethanol on the first postnatal day. Genotyping was performed by PCR as reported elsewhere 31 . A total number of 59 mice (DMBA/TPA study) and 216 mice (MPNST study) were used in this report. For the DMBA/TPA study, full randomization was not possible to maximize the number of same sex mice and enrolled on treatment or vehicle at 3 months old. The investigators were not blinded to the group allocation during the experiment. No mice were excluded for any reasons. 14 , 23 , 26 , 67 Histology and Immunohistochemistry Tissues were fixed in 10% formalin-buffered solution for at least 48\u2009h. Then tissues were paraffin embedded (Rushabh Instruments LLC), were sectioned at 5\u2009\u03bcm using a microtome (Leica RM2135), and were allowed to dry on superfrost glass slide at room temperature (r.t.). H&E staining was performed using Gill 3 hematoxylen (Thermo Scientific, 72604), followed by short washes with High Def (Statlab, SL103) and Bluing reagent (Fischer 22-220-106) and eosin-Y with phaloxine (Thermo Scientific, 71304) as counterstaining. For X-Gal staining, tissue were initially incubated in 4% para-formaldehyde (10\u2009min, r.t.), were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 1\u00d7 followed by incubation into X-Gal staining solution (4-chloro-5-bromo-3-indolyl-b-galactoside (X-Gal) (1\u2009mg/ml), potassium ferrocyanide (4\u2009mM), potassium ferricyanide (4\u2009mM), MgCl 2  (2\u2009mM) in PBS) for 24\u201348\u2009h before fixation by 10% formalin-buffered solution. Tissue slides were counterstained with Nuclear Fast Red (Millipore, HC609588) for 5\u2009min. For immunohistochemistry, the Vecta Stain Elite ABC kit (Vectorlabs, PK-6100) was used according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The following primary antibodies were used in the immunohistochemistry studies: K1 (BioLegend, 905601, 1:100), NF1 (Santa Cruz; sc-67, 1:100), H3K27Me3 (Cell Signaling, 9733\u2009S, 1:500), and S100 (DAKO, Z0311, 1:5000). All histologies were repeated in at least three biological replicates. The pathologist (T.V.) was blinded to the mice genotype when performing the histological review. Western blot Epidermis was enzymatically digested with dispase and physically separated from dermis using tweezers. Purified cells were lyzed and analyzed by immunoblot analysis with the following antibodies: NF1 (Santa Cruz; H-12, 1:100); K1 (BioLegend, 905601, 1:1000); LUMICAN (Santa Cruz; sc-166871, 1:200). All western blot were repeated in three biological replicates. See Supplementary Figure\u00a0 1  for uncropped blots related to Fig.\u00a0 2d . Genotyping by PCR DNA was prepared by adding NaOH 50\u2009mM (300\u2009\u03bcl) to a freshly cut mouse tail (5\u2009mm) and incubating it (100\u2009\u00b0C, 2\u2009h). Then, the digested tail was briefly vortexed and neutralized with Tris pH 7.5 (30\u2009\u03bcl). Next, 3\u2009\u03bcL of DNA was added to a master mix containing 2\u00d7 Taq RED Master Mix (Apex, 5200300-1250) (5\u2009\u03bcl) and forward and reverse primers (1\u2009\u03bcM, 2\u2009\u03bcl) and was submitted to PCR cycling (94\u2009\u00b0C, 3\u2009min, followed by 35 cycles (94\u2009\u00b0C, 15\u2009s; 60\u2009\u00b0C, 45\u2009s; and 72\u2009\u00b0C, 45\u2009s) and final elongation (72\u2009\u00b0C, 5\u2009min). The resulting PCR products were fractionated on 2% agarose gel. T cell proliferation assay Following the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations, CD3 +  T cells were purified from the lymph nodes of  Nf1 +/+  and  Nf1 +/\u2212  mice (age 3\u20136 months) using pan-T-cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). Purified CD3 +  T cells (2\u2009\u00d7\u200910 5 /well) were cultured for 2 days in 96-well plates (in triplicate) precoated with indicated doses of anti-CD3 Ab (eBioscience; cat. no. 16-0031-86) alone or anti-CD28 mAb (eBioscience; cat. no. 16-0281-85). After pulsing with  3 H-thymidine (1\u2009\u03bcCi/well [0.037 MBq/well]) for 20\u201322\u2009h, cells were collected and evaluated for  3 H radioactivity. For each experimental group, the T cell proliferation assay was performed in two pooled biological and three technical replicates.  DTH assay Nf1 +/+  ( n \u2009=\u20093) and  Nf1 +/\u2212  ( n \u2009=\u20093) mice (age 3\u20136 months) were sensitized for DTH on day 0 by painting 2% oxazolone (Sigma) in acetone\u2013olive oil (4:1 in volume) on shaved abdominal skin (sensitization). Mice were challenged on day 6 by painting 1% oxazolone and solvent control onto right and left ears, respectively (elicitation). Thereafter, DTH was assessed daily for 2 days by measuring ear thickness and calculating changes in ear swelling (thickness of right ear minus thickness of control left ear). For each experimental group, the T cell proliferation assay was performed in three biological replicates. Immunophenotyping of draining lymph node For proliferation, draining lymph node cells (2\u2009\u00d7\u200910 5 /well) of  Nf1 \n +/\u2212  and  Nf1 \n +/\u2212  mice were cultured without stimulation for 3 days and pulsed with  3 H-thymidine (1\u2009\u03bcCi/well [0.037 MBq/well]) for 20\u2009h. For CD69 expression, LN cells were stained with FITC-anti-CD69 mAb (eBioscience; cat. no. 11-0691-85; 1:100) or FITC-isotypic control hamster IgG (BD Pharmingen; cat. no. 11114\u2009C; 1:100) in the presence or absence of Ab directed at T cell (CD4 [eBioscience; cat. no. 17-0042-83; 1:100], CD8 [Lifetech; cat. no. A15836; 1:100], FoxP3 [eBioscience; cat. no. 12-57773-80; 1:100]), B-cell (B220 [eBioscience; cat. no. 11-0452-85; 1:100]), and pan hematopoietic (CD45 [eBioscience; cat. no. 25-0451-82; 1:100) cell surface marker and examined by FACS for surface expression of CD69 in each leukocyte subpopulation. Live cells were isolated from dead cells by staining with 7-aminoactinomycin D (Biolegend; 420403; 1:100). Analysis was performed in technical triplicates on three pooled biological replicates. See Supplementary Figure  2  for FACS gating strategies. Statistical analysis A two-tailed  t- test and Fisher exact test were applied as appropriate to evaluate statistical significance ( P \u2009<\u20090.05). Variation was estimated using standard deviation with a 95% confidence level (Fig.\u00a0 6 ). The distribution of the data in Fig.\u00a0 5a  is normal as judged by the kurtosis and skewness values.",

  "introduction": "Introduction Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a tumor predisposition syndrome occurring in 1 in about 3000 births . It is caused by a mutation of the tumor suppressor gene  1 NF1 , which encodes a negative regulator of the Ras signaling pathway and mainly affects the neural-crest-derived tissue types (e.g. Schwann cells and melanocytes). The phenotype of  NF1  loss-of-function is very broad and encompasses many organ systems at different time points over a lifetime . Indeed, some tumors arising from the nervous system such as plexiform neurofibromas (pNF) can manifest congenitally but occur in about half of all NF1 patients who are examined by whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and have a small chance of progression to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). Low-grade astrocytomas (mostly optic pathway gliomas) occur in 15\u201320% of young children with NF1 but are rarely, if ever, congenital. In contrast, some NF1 hallmarks such as cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs), caf\u00e9 au lait macules (CALMs), and iris hamartomas (Lisch nodules) may manifest later in life and be highly penetrant (>99% at age 20). 2 To explain the high phenotypic variability of NF1, the state-of-the-art working model describes at least three classes of factors . The first factor is the nature of the  3 NF1  germline mutation. A very small subset of  NF1  mutations can be associated with specific NF1 manifestations in patients , indicating that the nature of the mutation may not be a strong determinant. The second factor describes the presence of certain modifiers of neurofibroma that include, but are not limited to, genetic factors 4 \u2013 7 , sex hormones 8 , and the tumor microenvironment 9 \u2013 13 . The third factor is related to the inactivation of  1 , 14 NF1  in a specific cell type at a precise moment during a lifetime, the known spatio-temporal loss of  NF1 . A clear example is illustrated by the subtype of patients with the disease manifested in only a fraction of their bodies, hence segmental NF1. The likely explanation is somatic mosaicism, where the first  NF1  mutation occurs later in embryonic development between the blastocyst and the neuroblast stage in such a way that some cells are spared and remain wild type for  NF1 . In some occasions, the disease region may be so discrete that the NF1 diagnostic criteria cannot be met, which would explain the case of a single isolated neurofibroma that can be misinterpreted as a sporadic pNF. Another influential factor may be the nature of the second  NF1  mutation . Thus, our current knowledge and framework to study NF1 is insufficient to predict, even broadly, the prognosis and phenotypic progression of most NF1 patients. 15 Recently, the advent of next generation sequencing revealed a high mutation frequency for the  NF1  gene in a number of sporadic cancers that are not typically associated with NF1 patients . In some extreme instances, such as desmoplastic melanoma, the  16 NF1  gene is mutated in up to 90% of the cases. Strikingly, only a single case of desmoplastic melanoma was reported so far in NF1 patients. One possible explanation would be that the  NF1 +/\u2212  microenvironment is refractory to malignancy, but this idea contrasts with the established pro-tumorigenic role of the  Nf1 +/\u2212  microenvironment in the context of neurofibromagenesis . In fact, NF1 is considered a tumor predisposition syndrome, as NF1 patients have an increased risk of developing multiple neoplasms  14 . In this paper, we reconcile these discrepancies by compiling experimental and clinical evidence favoring a new framework to study the role of  17 NF1  in tumorigenesis in both NF1 and non-NF1 contexts. In brief, we discover that an  Nf1 +/\u2212  microenvironment accelerates the formation of benign tumors but impairs further progression to malignancy. Analysis of benign and malignant tumors commonly associated with NF1 patients, as well as those with high  NF1  gene mutation frequency, reveals an antagonistic role for  NF1  heterozygosity in tumor initiation and malignant transformation and helps to reconciliate the role of the  NF1  gene in both NF1 and non-NF1 patient contexts.",
  "results": "Results Loss of  Nf1  in keratinocytes does not enhance skin tumors Despite the characteristic cNF and CALMs, no other skin problem or skin disease is widely associated with NF1 patients even though neurofibromin is expressed in keratinocytes . Because the cycles of proliferation and differentiation in keratinocytes occur at a much faster pace than in cells from the nervous system (e.g. Schwann cells), we reasoned that even if a keratinocyte undergoes biallelic  18 \u2013 20 NF1  inactivation, it would be discarded and shed off from the skin rapidly. This would explain why squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is such a rare event in NF1. Intriguingly, previous studies show indirect evidence suggesting that loss of  Nf1  in keratinocytes may sensitize these cells to tumor development in the context of the two-step carcinogenesis protocol . Briefly, the first step of this protocol consists of applying the mutagenic substance 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) to induce an activating mutation in the HRAS oncogene, whereas the second step uses a promoting agent such as 12- 21 O -tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) to create an inflammation-rich and tumor-prone microenvironment . Strikingly,  22 Nf1 +/\u2212  mice  (mimicking NF1 patient predisposition mutation) submitted to the two-step carcinogenesis protocol have a much higher rate of papilloma (a precursor lesion to the malignant SCC) development compared to that of the wild-type littermates 23 . This is surprising as mutated HRAS was reported to be unresponsive to RasGAPs such as  21 Nf1 . Importantly, and in agreement with the virtual absence of phenotypes from keratinocytes of NF1 patients,  24 Nf1 +/\u2212  murine keratinocytes do not spontaneously transform into a tumor in vivo unless additional mutational events are induced . Therefore, we reasoned that enhancement of DMBA/TPA-induced tumors in  21 , 23 Nf1 +/\u2212  mice was either due to the  Nf1 +/\u2212  keratinocytes (independent of its Ras function) or due to an  Nf1 +/\u2212  non-keratinocyte cell in the microenvironment. To directly address the first possibility, we decided to develop a new mouse model that would knockout  Nf1  specifically in keratinocytes ( K14 Cre;  Nf1 f/f ) and challenge it to the two-step carcinogenesis protocol. For this purpose, we crossed the  K14 Cre mice  with the  25 Nf1 f/f  mice  to ultimately obtain  14 K14 Cre;  Nf1 f/f  mice. Next, we submitted 28  K14 Cre;  Nf1 f/f  mice and 22 of their control littermates to the two-step carcinogenesis protocol (Fig.\u00a0 1a ) . After 23 weeks of TPA treatment,  22 K14 Cre;  Nf1 f/f  mice and their control littermates began to develop at least one papilloma. Next, we aged our mice for further tumor development. Interestingly, most tumors evaluated progressed to SCC (Fig.\u00a0 1b, c ). Histological examination by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) indicates that the majority of the typical papilloma architecture (hyperplastic epidermis surrounding the stroma) progressed to differentiated SCC in tumors from both  Nf1 f/f  (Fig.\u00a0 1d ) and  K14 Cre;  Nf1 f/f  (Fig.\u00a0 1e ) mice. In addition, immunohistochemistry using keratin 1 (K1, an epithelial cell marker that is lost upon cancer progression ) antibodies confirmed the low expression of K1 in tumor samples from both  22 Nf1 f/f  (Fig.\u00a0 1f ) and  K14 Cre;  Nf1 f/f  (Fig.\u00a0 1g ) mice, although K1 is highly expressed in normal margin epidermis (Fig.\u00a0 1h, i ). Overall, we could not discriminate mice genotypes based on histology. Of note, there was no statistical difference (exact Fischer test value\u2009=\u20091) between the number of mice bearing a tumor in the  Nf1 f/f  group (14%) vs the  K14 Cre;  Nf1 f/f  group (11%) (Fig.\u00a0 1j ). These results indicated that  Nf1  biallelic inactivation in keratinocytes does not enhance DMBA/TPA-induced malignant tumors and ruled out the possibility that the sensitization phenotype initially observed by Atit et al.  may be due to some Ras-independent function of  21 Nf1  in keratinocytes. Consistently, Atit et al.  was not able to demonstrate the  21 Nf1  loss of heterozygosity or the loss of  Nf1  expression in keratinocytes of their papillomas. Hence, we reasoned that the sensitization to tumor development observed by Atit et al.  in the  21 Nf1 +/\u2212  mice was the consequence of  Nf1  gene dosage in one or more non-keratinocyte cell (a cell from the microenvironment).

A fraction of  Nf1 f/f  (3 out of 22 (14%) and  K14 Cre;  Nf1 f/f  (3 out of 28 (11%) developed at least one tumor (papilloma or SCC) To further validate the  K14 Cre;  Nf1 f/f  mouse model, expected genotypes were confirmed by PCR (Fig.\u00a0 2a, b ). We also evaluated the extent of Cre recombinase action to delete NF1 in the epidermis by four means. First, we analyzed the  Nf1- deleted band from mice\u2019s skin tail by PCR . Indeed, the  26 Nf1 -deleted band is virtually absent from  K14 Cre;  Nf1 f/f  mice, whereas the band is still present in skin from  Nf1 f/f  mice (Fig.\u00a0 2c ). Second, we prepared protein extract from purified epidermis and dermis from  K14 Cre;  Nf1 f/f  and  Nf1 f/f  mice and analyzed the extent of NF1 knockout by western-blotting (Fig.\u00a0 2d ). Third, we performed immunohistochemistry in skin from  K14 Cre;  Nf1 f/f  and  Nf1 f/f  mice using anti-NF1 antibodies (Fig.\u00a0 2e, f ). Fourth, we crossed the  K14 Cre;  Nf1 f/f  mice with the  ROSA -LacZ reporter mouse and observed specific signal in the epidermis upon X-Gal staining (Fig.\u00a0 2g, h ). Overall, we did not identify any skin phenotype in  K14 Cre;  Nf1 f/f  mice (Fig.\u00a0 2i, j ). Fig. 2 Loss of  Nf1  in keratinocytes does not trigger obvious skin phenotype.

Scale bar is equal to 50\u2009\u03bcm Dual role of  Nf1 +/\u2212  microenvironment in skin tumorigenesis To determine the contribution of an  Nf1 +/\u2212  microenvironment to the development of papillomas, additional mice were submitted to the two-step carcinogenesis protocol as described in Fig.\u00a0 1a . Papilloma development was assessed each week by visual inspection of the dorsal skin. Strikingly, a large fraction of  Nf1 +/\u2212  mice (44%, 4 out of 9) developed papilloma, whereas no (0 out of 50)  Nf1 f/f  (wild-type  Nf1  in all tissues) or  K14 Cre;  Nf1 f/f  ( Nf1  knockout in keratinocytes but wild type in all other tissues) mice, here after called  Nf1 +/+  mice (all  Nf1 +/+  mice are from Fig.\u00a0 1  in the previous section), showed any sign of papilloma formation at week 19 (Fig.\u00a0 3a ). Eventually, some  Nf1 +/+  mice developed papilloma but to a much lesser extent (12%, 6 out of 50; Fischer exact test value\u2009=\u20090.036). This indicates that an  Nf1 +/\u2212  microenvironment accelerate papilloma formation. Fig. 3 Antagonistic role of  Nf1 +/\u2212  microenvironment in DMBA/TPA-induced tumors.  a  Incidence of mice developing tumor under DMBA/TPA treatment as a function of time. A fraction of\u00a0mice with  Nf1 +/+  (6 out of 50; 12%) and  Nf1 +/\u2212  (4 out of 9; 44%) microenvironment\u00a0developed at least one tumor (papilloma or SCC). Fischer exact test statistic was performed.  b  Tumors from six\u00a0mice with  Nf1 +/+  and five  Nf1 +/\u2212 microenvironment\u00a0were reviewed by a pathologist and classified as papilloma (benign) or SCC (malignant) based on  c \u2013 f . Fischer exact test statistic was performed. Representative  c, \n d  H&E-stained and  e, \n f  IHC using K1 antibodies in histological sections of dissected DMBA/TPA-treated dorsal skin from  c ,  e \n Nf1 +/+  and  d ,  f \n Nf1 +/\u2212 . Scale bar is equal to 50\u2009\u03bcm To determine the influence of an  Nf1 +/\u2212  microenvironment on the progression from papillomas to SCC, we further aged the mice that developed papillomas from both genotypes ( Nf1 +/+  and  Nf1 +/\u2212 ) for an additional period of 23 weeks. Strikingly, in the following months after TPA treatment, the gross morphology of all the papillomas evaluated from the  Nf1 +/\u2212  mouse model did not progress further and remained benign. However, most of the tumors from the  Nf1 +/+  mice did progress to frank malignant carcinoma lesions (Fischer exact test value\u2009=\u20090.015; Fig.\u00a0 3b ). Histological examination by H&E confirmed that most tumors from the  Nf1 +/+  mice progressed to differentiated SCC (Fig.\u00a0 3c ), whereas all tumors from  Nf1 +/\u2212  mice maintained their typical papilloma architecture (Fig.\u00a0 3d ). In addition, immunohistochemistry using the epithelial marker K1 confirmed its expression only in tumors from  Nf1 +/\u2212  mice (Fig.\u00a0 3e, f ). This indicated that an  Nf1 +/\u2212  microenvironment repressed the progression from the benign papilloma to SCC. Altogether, these results illustrate the antagonistic role of the  Nf1 +/\u2212  microenvironment regarding cancer progression, in which it fosters de novo benign tumorigenesis but impairs malignant transformation. Dual role of  Nf1 +/\u2212  microenvironment in the clinical context In the context of NF1, patients are by definition heterozygous for the  NF1  gene due to inactivation of one copy of  NF1  in all their somatic cells, but these patients rarely develop papillomas or SCC. Therefore, we extensively and systematically searched the literature for clinical data on NF1-associated benign and malignant tumors (Supplementary Table\u00a0 1 ). First, we noticed that the NF1-associated neoplasms have an early onset (Supplementary Table\u00a0 1 ). Indeed, the penetrance is close to 100% by age 20 for cNFs and iris hamartomas that are characteristic of NF1 patients. In fact, the great majority of benign lesions in NF1 patients develop with much less frequency in the general population. In other words, the development of these tumors and hamartomas seems to be promoted by an  Nf1 +/\u2212  microenvironment. Thus, our initial observation from the pre-clinical model representing a non-NF1-associated tumor (i.e. the DMBA/TPA-induced tumor) is mirrored clinically in the context of NF1. Second, most NF1-associated neoplasms are of the benign type and rarely, if ever, progress to malignant tumors (Supplementary Table\u00a0 1 ). This is especially true for the tumors characteristic of NF1 patients. For the group of NF1-related tumors with much lower penetrance: low-grade pilocytic astrocytomas, low-grade gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), and most pheochromocytomas are rarely malignant in people with NF1. In fact, the prognosis is actually better for NF1 patients compared to non-NF1 patients for low-grade pilocytic astrocytomas and GISTs (Supplementary Table\u00a0 1 ). Third, we noticed that sporadic cancer with high mutation frequency for the  NF1  gene (e.g. melanoma, glioblastoma, lung, skin, and ovarian cancer), rarely, if ever, develop in NF1 patients, although they have already lost one copy of  NF1  (Supplementary Table\u00a0 1 ; Supplementary Table\u00a0 2 ). This argues in favor of a model where the  NF1 +/\u2212  microenvironment impairs certain carcinogenesis. Altogether, these human clinical data align well with our conclusion derived from the DMBA/TPA-induced tumor study (Fig.\u00a0 3 ), in which an  Nf1 +/\u2212  microenvironment played an antagonistic role throughout the stepwise cancer progression. A new mouse model of progression from neurofibroma to MPNST An apparent exception to this rule seems to be MPNST, which broadly refers to a collection of malignant sarcomas with connection to the nerve structure. MPNST can develop sporadically in non-NF1 patients, as a consequence of radiation therapy, or in the context of NF1. Little is known about the contribution of the  Nf1 +/\u2212  microenvironment on the progression from pNF (benign) to MPNST (malignant). This is due in part to the lack of an animal model describing the transition from pNF to MPNST . Myelin-specific proteolipid protein (PLP) is expressed in myelinating Schwann cells from precursor stages and lasts throughout their mature stages 27 \u2013 29 . In a  30 PLP-CreERT2  pNF model, we have previously demonstrated that Schwann cells are susceptible to pNF development when  Nf1  is ablated with tamoxifen induction at the immature Schwann cell stage (new born) . In the course of a study on the role of the stem cell factor in pNF development using the  31 PLP CreERT2;  Nf1 f/f  mice , our lab observed that some pNF further transformed into MPNST spontaneously (Fig.\u00a0 32 4a, b ). These sarcomas developed with connection to the nerve structure (Fig.\u00a0 4b ). To make sure that these tumors originated from  Nf1 \u2212/\u2212  Schwann cells, we crossed the  PLP CreERT2;  Nf1 f/f  mice to  ROSA -LacZ reporter mice and observed a specific signal from cancer cells upon X-Gal staining (Fig.\u00a0 4c ). As opposed to pNF, MPNST often present the loss of a Schwann cell differentiation marker such as S100 (Fig.\u00a0 4d ) as well as the epigenetic repressive marker H3K27Me3 (Fig.\u00a0 4e ). Of note, some tumors show a mixture of neurofibroma histology and MPNST histology with much higher cellularity (Fig.\u00a0 4f ), mirroring initial observations on human clinical samples . Thus, the  33 PLP CreERT2;  Nf1 f/f  mice are an excellent model to decipher the role of the  Nf1 +/\u2212  microenvironment in the context of the spontaneous progression from pNF to MPNST. Fig. 4 A novel mouse model to study the sequential progression from plexiform neurofibroma to MPNST.  a ,  b  Representative gross image of  a \n PLP CreERT2;  Nf1 f/f  mouse that develops MPNST in the right sciatic nerve and  b  its dissected spinal cord along with peripheral nerves.  c \u2013 f  Representative  c  X-Gal staining ( PLP CreERT2;  Nf1 f/f ;  ROSA -LacZ), IHC using  d  S100 and  e  H3K27 (arrow head) antibodies and  f  H&E in histological sections of dissected MPNST from  PLP CreERT2;  Nf1 f/f . Scale bar is equal to 50\u2009\u03bcm Dual role of  Nf1 +/\u2212  microenvironment in NF1-associated tumor To evaluate the contribution of the  Nf1 +/\u2212  microenvironment to cancer progression in a mouse model that develops NF1-associated benign and malignant tumors, we analyzed a cohort of 216  PLP CreERT2;  Nf1 f/f  ( Nf1  knockout in Schwann cells, but wild type in all other tissues) and  PLP CreERT2;  Nf1 f/\u2212  ( Nf1  knockout in Schwann cells, but heterozygous in all other tissues) mice. Although we could observe high penetrance of pNF even in  PLP CreERT2;  Nf1 f/f  mice, pNF develops much faster in the  PLP CreERT2;  Nf1 f/\u2212  (Fig.\u00a0 5a ). At one year of age, the majority of  PLP CreERT2;  Nf1 f/\u2212  (77 out of 104, 74%) mice already developed pNF and showed the clinical signs of pNF (scruffy fur, limping, paralysis), whereas only a minority of  PLP CreERT2;  Nf1 f/f  (32 out of 112, 29%) mice did (Fig.\u00a0 5a ). Next, mice that developed pNF were further aged to evaluate their capacities to progress to MPNST. Strikingly, no MPNST developed in  PLP CreERT2;  Nf1 f/ \u2212  mice (0 out of 104, 0%), whereas all MPNST observed arose from  PLP CreERT2;  Nf1 f/f  mice (10%, 11 out of 112) (exact Fischer test value\u2009=\u20090.001) (Fig.\u00a0 5b ). It is likely that given more time, some  PLP CreERT2;  Nf1 f/\u2212  mice will develop MPNST as in patients with NF1. However, it is clear that at the time of sacrification secondary to morbidity from the pNF, we only observed MPNST development in  PLP CreERT2;  Nf1 f/f  mice. This indicates that in the context of NF1-associated tumors, the  Nf1 +/\u2212  microenvironment has the capacity to accelerate the formation of benign lesions (pNF) but restrain the further progression to frank sarcoma (MPNST), as observed with models of non-NF1-associated papilloma and SCC (i.e. DMBA/TPA-induced skin tumors). Fig. 5 Antagonistic role of  Nf1 +/\u2212  microenvironment in plexiform neurofibroma and MPNST formation.  a  Incidence of mice with plexiform neurofibroma (pNF).  b  Tumor were classified as pNF (benign) or MPNST (malignant) based on histology.

Scale bar is equal to 50\u2009\u03bcm Our results suggest a novel framework to study the role of  NF1  in tumorigenesis and predict that identifying the cells and factors responsible for slowing down malignant progression may be of significance to NF1 patients. To get mechanistic insights about the cells involved, we proceed with a systematic histological evaluation highlighting the key hallmarks of pNF (Fig.\u00a0 5c\u2013j ). We found no obvious difference by H&E (Fig.\u00a0 5c, d ), S100 immunohistochemistry (Schwann cells) (Fig.\u00a0 5e, f ), trichrome staining (collagen) (Fig.\u00a0 5g, h ), and toluidine blue (mast cells) (Fig.\u00a0 5i, j ) when we compared pNF from  PLP CreERT2;  Nf1 f/f  and  PLP CreERT2;  Nf1 f/\u2212  mice. In fact, human cNF and pNF have almost identical histology although some pNF further progress to MPNST but not cNF. Therefore, we reasoned that the cell types slowing down malignant progression may be driven by a minor population of cells not obviously picked up by routine histological evaluation. Nf1 +/\u2212  background enhances T cell proliferation and function Although largely unexplored, there is some evidence in the NF1 literature suggesting that NF1 patients have an enhanced immunosurveillance system that could impair malignant transformation . Therefore, we further turned our attention to the immune system in  34 , 35 Nf1 +/\u2212  mice. We isolated T cells from lymph nodes and submitted them to an in vitro T cell proliferation assay, an established and classic method to determine the reactivity and functional status of the T lymphocytes . We found that  36 Nf1 +/\u2212  T cells are more hyperproliferative when stimulated with anti-CD3 than their wild-type counterparts (Fig.\u00a0 6a, b ). Most importantly, to evaluate the functional responses of T cells to antigens in vivo, we utilized the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) assay, a classic method for evaluating T cell-mediated immune responses . The DTH reaction is divided into the sensitization and elicitation phases. During the initial phase of this model, the ears from  37 , 38 Nf1 +/\u2212  or  Nf1 +/+  mice are immunized by topical application of oxazolone antigen. The second phase is initiated 5\u201312 days after sensitization, whereby the previously sensitized mice are challenged by topical application of the same antigen at the ears. The DTH response is evaluated 24\u2009h post-challenge by measuring the ear thickness. The skin thickness, which is a surrogate for a massive immune cell infiltration and enhanced immunity, was more pronounced in  Nf1 +/\u2212  mice (Fig.\u00a0 6c ). There was also much higher cellularity and the T cells were more hyperproliferative in the draining lymph nodes of  Nf1 +/\u2212  mice (Fig.\u00a0 6d, e ). Detailed FACS analysis indicates again that the number of activated T cells, including the fraction of activated cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, is higher in the draining lymph nodes of  Nf1 +/\u2212  mice compared to  Nf1 +/+  mice (Fig.\u00a0 6f\u2013i ). Altogether, this indicates that the  Nf1 +/\u2212  background enhances the immunity by increasing the number of hyperproliferative  Nf1 +/\u2212  T cells and augmenting the functional responses of T cells, the major contributors to immune surveillance responsible to clear out malignant cells, to antigens in vivo.

  "discussion": "Discussion The goal of the present report is to propose a novel framework to study the role of  NF1  in tumorigenesis that integrates a number of apparent discrepancies in the published NF1 literature together with the current reported data. On the one hand, our model stipulates that an  Nf1 +/\u2212  microenvironment accelerates the formation of benign tumors (Fig.\u00a0 7 ). Using two independent mouse models, we observed a faster appearance of benign tumors in the context of NF1- (Fig.\u00a0 5a ) and non-NF1- (Fig.\u00a0 3a ) associated tumors. This is in agreement with the findings of the Parada  and Gutmann 14  labs in the context of pNF and astrocytoma (low-grade optic glioma), respectively, in which they concluded that an  39 Nf1 +/\u2212  microenvironment is critical for these tumors\u2019 formation. Their results help explain why NF1 patients are predisposed to these benign tumors and why sporadic pNFs are a rare event. However, other investigators described mouse models where neurofibromas are much less dependent on the  Nf1 +/\u2212  microenvironment . This discrepancy may be due to different pools of neurofibroma cells of origin targeted by different Schwann cell Cre lines. Importantly, in all mouse models reported so far, including non-NF1-related tumor models, there was either no impact or a positive impact toward formation of benign tumors. Thus, this suggests that in both humans and mice the  40 \u2013 42 Nf1 +/\u2212  microenvironment favors the development of benign tumors. Fig. 7 NF1  heterozygosity fosters de novo tumorigenesis but impairs malignant transformation. Schematic summarizing the antagonistic role of  NF1 +/\u2212  microenvironment on the sequential cancer progression from normal to benign to malignant tumor On the other hand, our model predicts that an  Nf1 +/\u2212  microenvironment prevents further progression to frank malignant lesions (Fig.\u00a0 7 ). At first glance, this statement may seem paradoxical to the established cancer predisposition feature of the  NF1  gene. It is true that NF1 patients have a higher lifetime risk of developing a cancer compared to the general population . However, as summarized in Supplementary Table\u00a0 17 1 , the great majority of the tumors found in NF1 patients will rarely, if ever, progress to an aggressive malignant tumor. Indeed, the malignant state of a tumor is not used as a diagnostic criteria for NF1 . Although NF1 patients have a 10\u201315 years shorter life expectancy, the mean age at diagnosis for most tumors with high  2 NF1  mutation frequency falls within their lifetime (Supplementary Tables\u00a0 1  and\u00a0 2 ), ruling out the arguments that NF1 patients would not live long enough to actually develop frank cancers. Since NF1 patients have a 10% lifetime chance of being ultimately diagnosed with MPNST and the incidence of MPNST is very low in the general population, this leads to the general idea that NF1 patients, harboring an  NF1 +/\u2212  microenvironment, are more susceptible to this cancer development. In support of this theory, NF1 patients have a worse prognosis compared to that of sporadic MPNST cases. However, due to its deeper anatomical location, NF1-associated MPNST is typically diagnosed at a later stage compared to non-NF1 patients, which could explain the poorer prognosis of NF1 patients with MPNST (and not necessarily because of the  NF1  status of the microenvironment) . 43 \u2013 45 The consistent experimental and clinical evidence present in this study predicts that the number of MPNST cases in NF1 patients is actually much lower due to the antagonistic role of the  NF1 +/\u2212  microenvironment, considering the size and number of pNF in NF1 patients. Indeed, one of the major confounding factors in the current interpretation of death certificates and cohort studies resides in the lack of data describing precursor lesions of MPNST. It is conceivable that a population with an increased chance of developing benign lesions (i.e. NF1 patients with pNF) is more prone to develop MPNST than the general population (i.e. non-NF1 patients without pNF). To delineate the contribution of  NF1  heterozygosity to malignancy, one would have to evaluate the percentage of non-NF1 patients with pNF that ultimately develop MPNST. Unfortunately, most, if not all, MPNST (either from NF1 or non-NF1 patients) are rarely diagnosed at the level of the precursor pNF lesion due to their deep anatomical location, precluding anyone from conclusively answering this critical question. In other words, our model predicts that the incidence of MPNST, and breast cancer  as well as juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) 46 \u2013 50  that are associated with NF1, would be much higher in NF1 patients if it were not due to the repressive role of the  51 \u2013 53 NF1 +/\u2212  microenvironment. Some other NF1-associated tumors worth mentioning (e.g. gliomas, GISTs, pheochromocytomas) may have been referred to as malignant in the literature. Generally, they are not malignant, although some cases of high-grade astrocytoma, malignant GIST, and malignant pheochromocytoma were reported in NF1 patients (Supplementary Table\u00a0 1 ) and have a more benign course compared to their sporadic counterpart. This is reflected in their better prognosis (Supplementary Table\u00a0 1 ). Our results suggest a novel framework to study the role of  NF1  in tumorigenesis (Fig.\u00a0 7 ). Importantly, it predicts that identifying the cells and factors responsible for (1) accelerating benign tumor formation and (2) slowing down malignant progression may be of significance to NF1 patients. Regarding the former mechanism, it is interesting to note that drastically reducing the number of mast cells abrogated the neurofibromatogenesis accelerating capacity of the  Nf1 +/\u2212  microenvironment in our PLPcreERT2 mouse model . We conclude that mast cells are not absolutely required for neurofibroma but will make neurofibroma grow faster in this model. The targeting of mast cells is not unfamiliar to the NF1 field. Since mast cells are known to secrete histamine, which is largely involved in allergic reactions, mast cells have been first hypothesized as responsible for skin pruritus 32 . Still, today there is no conclusive evidence regarding the cause of pruritus in the context of cNF. In a series of landmark papers 54 , the positive correlation of mast cell depletion and loss of the acceleration of pNF formation, coupled to the drastic effect of a mast cell inhibitor in an NF1 patient with morbid pNF, stimulated the Clapp group to launch a clinical trial targeting advanced pNF. Disappointingly, the great majority of the patients did not respond to the mast cell inhibitor treatment 55 \u2013 57 . Our new framework predicts that mast cell inhibitors may be more effective towards early tumor development as a mean of delaying tumor onset rather than targeting mechanisms of neurofibroma maintenance. 58 Recently, independent labs have reported macrophages as an emerging hallmark of neurofibroma . Macrophage density correlates with disease progression 32 , 59 , suggesting a pro-tumorigenesis role for macrophages. Pharmacological inhibition of macrophage proliferation correlates with neurofibroma volume reduction in vivo 59 . However, the compound used is a non-specific dual mast cell and macrophage inhibitor, precluding any definitive conclusion on the functional role of macrophages in vivo. In the context of optic pathway glioma, another NF1-associated benign tumor,  59 Nf1 +/\u2212  microglia (macrophage-like cells) enable tumor growth . Thus,  60 Nf1 +/\u2212  macrophages in the tumor microenvironment have an established pro-tumorigenesis role and interfering with macrophage function may be of therapeutic interest for NF1 patients. The field of cancer immunology holds great promises in leveraging the natural capacity of immune surveillance to fight against cancer. Indeed, there is indirect evidence from a case report of NF1 patients undergoing organ transplants that suggests that immune surveillance in NF1 patients suppress malignant transformation . Here, we discovered that  35 Nf1 +/\u2212  T cells are hyperproliferative and have an enhanced immunity signature, including expanding the fraction of activated cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. This suggests that an  Nf1 +/\u2212  microenvironment may empower NF1 patients with an enhanced immune surveillance system and may explain why most NF1 patients do not develop MPNST. Indeed, in NF1 patients, a negative correlation between the number of activated T cells and the progression from pNF to MPNST in NF1 patients was recently reported . Importantly, this mechanism is not perfectly effective, as some NF1 patients do develop malignant tumors. Therefore, we reasoned that if the putative enhanced immune surveillance capacity of NF1 patients is a major force contributing to the malignant progression impairment, then it will be proportionally effective in highly immunogenic tumors. Indeed, the few malignant tumors associated with NF1 patients, such as MPNST and breast cancer, have a low immunogenic potential 34 , and the cancer types with high mutation frequency for the  61 \u2013 63 NF1  gene that are not associated with NF1 patients, such as skin, lung, ovarian, melanoma, and bladder cancers, are highly immunogenic . Altogether, we propose that the enhanced function of some  64 , 65 NF1 +/\u2212  immune cells in the tumor microenvironment of NF1 patients may favor the benign tumor state (i.e.  NF1 +/\u2212  mast cells, macrophages), but can also impair malignant transformation (i.e.  NF1 +/\u2212  T cells). In summary, we present consistent evidence in both human and mouse models that the  NF1 +/\u2212  microenvironment has an antagonistic role in tumorigenesis: accelerating development of benign tumors and restraining further progression to malignant cancer. Our novel framework to study the role of  NF1  in tumorigenesis integrates the concept of  NF1  as a tumor predisposition gene, knowledge derived from the Krox20-Cre;  Nf1  mouse model f /\u2212 , while at the same time explaining why NF1 patients develop mostly benign tumors instead of developing the cancer types with high  14 , 66 NF1  mutation rates as seen in the general population. Further elucidating the mechanisms underlying the impairment of cancer progression by tumor microenvironment cells harboring a tumor suppressor genes in the haploinsufficient state, such as  NF1 +/\u2212 , may translate into novel therapeutic strategies.",
