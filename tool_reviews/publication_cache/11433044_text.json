Author information: (1)Department of Medical Genetics, University Hospital Ghent-OK5, De Pintelaan  185, 9000 Ghent, Belgium.  A reliable and robust method for measuring the expression of alternatively  spliced transcripts is an important step in investigating the significance of  each variant. So far, accurate quantification of splice variants has been  laborious and difficult due to the intrinsic limitations of conventional  methods. The many advantages of real-time PCR have made this technique  attractive to study its application in quantification of splice isoforms. We use  skipping of exon 37 in the NF1 gene as a model to compare and evaluate the  different strategies for quantitating splice variants using real-time PCR. An  overview of three different possibilities for detecting alternative transcripts  is given. We propose the use of a boundary-spanning primer to quantify isoforms  that differ greatly in abundance. We describe here a novel method for creating a  reliable standard curve using one plasmid containing both alternative  transcripts. In addition, we validate the use of an absolute standard curve  based on a dilution series of fluorometrically quantified PCR products.
