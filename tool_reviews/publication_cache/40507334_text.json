  "abstract": "One of the hallmarks of cancer cells is their failure to respond to the cellular mechanism of apoptosis. The B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) family of proteins regulate apoptosis. Their ability to do so can be measured using several methods that in turn anticipate the fate of the cancer cell in response to apoptosis-inducing treatment. These assays ultimately identify the readiness of the cancer cell to undergo apoptosis, which is referred to as the mitochondrial priming state. These metrics, however, have been challenging to implement in the clinic.",
