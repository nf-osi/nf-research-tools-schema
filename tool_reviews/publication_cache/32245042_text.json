  "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1)-related Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors (MPNST) are highly resistant sarcomas that account for significant mortality. The mechanisms of therapy resistance are not well-understood in MPNSTs, particularly with respect to kinase inhibition strategies. In this study, we aimed to quantify the impact of both the genomic context and targeted therapy on MPNST resistance using reverse phase phosphoproteome array (RPPA) analysis. We treated tumorgrafts from three genetically engineered mouse models using MET (capmatinib) and MEK (trametinib) inhibitors and doxorubicin, and assessed phosphosignaling at 4 h, 2 days, and 21 days. Baseline kinase signaling in our mouse models recapitulated an MET-addicted state (NF1-MET), P53 mutation (NF1-P53), and HGF overexpression (NF1). Following perturbation with the drug, we observed broad and redundant kinome adaptations that extended well beyond canonical RAS/ERK or PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. MET and MEK inhibition were both associated with an initial inflammatory response mediated by kinases in the JAK/STAT pathway and NFkB. Growth signaling predominated at the 2-day and 21-day time points as a result of broad RTK and intracellular kinase activation. Interestingly, AXL and NFkB were strongly activated at the 2-day and 21-day time points, and tightly correlated, regardless of the treatment type or genomic context. The degree of kinome adaptation observed in innately resistant tumors was significantly less than the surviving fractions of responsive tumors that exhibited a latency period before reinitiating growth. Lastly, doxorubicin resistance was associated with kinome adaptations that strongly favored growth and survival signaling. These observations confirm that MPNSTs are capable of profound signaling plasticity in the face of kinase inhibition or DNA damaging agent administration. It is possible that by targeting AXL or NFkB, therapy resistance can be mitigated.",

Murine MPNST Tumorgrafts and Treatment Immediately following the euthanasia of tumor-bearing mice, 15\u201325 mg portions of each tumor were transplanted into the flank of NSG-SCID mice using a 10 gauge trochar. Tumors were measured twice weekly and euthanized when the tumor size exceeded 2500 mm 3 . When the tumor volume reached approximately 150 mm 3 , mice were randomized into treatment groups, treated, and euthanized as independent groups at 4-h, 2-day, or 21-day time points (or until mice reached the euthanasia criteria). Respective doses across all treatment combinations were capmatinib (30 mg/kg twice daily vial oral gavage), trametinib (1 mg/kg daily via oral gavage), and doxorubicin (1 mg/kg once via subcutaneous injection). For the 4-h time point, all animals were euthanized 4 h after a single dose. For the 2-day time point, capmatinib-treated animals received three total doses and were euthanized 4 h after the final treatment, whereas trametinib-treated animals received two total doses before euthanasia. Tumors were immediately harvested and either snap-frozen or formalin-fixed for further analysis. Three representative tumors were assessed by RPPA for each time point, treatment, and genotype group. Capmatinib and trametinib were obtained from Novartis. Doxorubicin was obtained from LC Laboratories. All animal experimentation in this study was approved by the Van Andel Institute\u2019s Internal Animal Care and Use Committee (XPA-19-04-001). 2.2. Sample Collection and Preparation for RPPA Downstream Analysis Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen within 20 min upon surgical resection to preserve the integrity of the phosphoproteome. Specimens were then embedded in an optimal cutting temperature compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA, USA), cut into 8 \u03bcm cryo-sections, mounted on uncharged glass slides, and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until microdissected. Each slide was fixed in 70% ethanol (Sigma Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany), washed in deionized water, stained with hematoxylin (Sigma Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) and blued in Scott\u2019s Tap Water substitute (Electron Microscopy Sciences), and dehydrated through an ethanol gradient (70%, 95%, and 100%) and xylene (Sigma Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany). In order to prevent protein degradation, complete protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland) were added to the ethanol, water, hematoxylin, and Scott\u2019s Tap Water substitute [ 17 ]. For each sample, an average of 15,000 tumor cells was isolated from the surrounding microenvironment using a Pixcell II LCM system (Arcturus, Mountain View, CA, USA). Microdissected cells were lysed in a 1:1 solution of 2\u00d7 Tris-Glycine SDS Sample buffer (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent (Pierce, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with 2.5% of 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany). Cell lysates were boiled for 8 min and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. 2.3. Reverse Phase Protein Microarray Construction and Immunostaining Using an Aushon 2470 arrayer (Aushon BioSystems, Billerica, MA, USA) equipped with 185 \u03bcm pins, samples and standard curves for internal quality assurance were printed in triplicate onto Oncyte Avid nitrocellulose-coated slides (Grace Bio-labs, Bend, OR, USA), as previously described [ 17 ]. A Sypro Ruby Protein Blot Stain (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) protocol was used to stain selected arrays to quantify the total amount of protein within each sample. Before immunostaining, each array was first incubated with Reblot Antibody stripping solution (Chemicon) for 15 min at room temperature, followed by two washes in PBS. To minimize potential nonspecific bindings, arrays were then incubated in I-block solution (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 1 h. Each array was tested with a single primary antibody using an automated system (Dako, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The antibody specificity was tested by immunoblotting using a wide panel of cell lysates, as previously described [ 17 , 18 ]. Negative control arrays were incubated with the anti-rabbit secondary antibody only to account for unspecific binding and background noise. A commercially available catalyzed signal amplification system (Dako, Santa Clara, CA, USA) coupled with a biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories) and a streptavidin-conjugated IRDye680 (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA) were used for the amplification and detection of the fluorescent signal. Arrays were probed with a total of 99 antibodies targeting protein kinases involved in major cellular functions, and the results of the broad screening were previously published. Antibody and Sypro Ruby-stained arrays were scanned using a laser-based PowerScanner (TECAN, M\u00f6nnedorf, Switzerland). Acquired images were analysed using the MicroVigene software version 5.1 (Vigene Tech, Carlisle, MA, USA). This commercially available software performs spot finding, averages the triplicates, subtracts the background from the negative control slide(s), and normalizes each sample to the corresponding amount of total protein measured by Sypro Ruby staining. Intra- and inter-assay reproducibility of the RPPA platform has been previously reported [ 19 , 20 ]. 2.4. Statistical Methods Tumor growth analysis : Linear mixed-effects models, with random slopes and intercepts, and false discovery rate-adjusted contrasts, were used to estimate and compare tumor growth rates for the different mono and combo therapies. For visualization of the changes in tumor growth, the tumor volume was imputed using the last observation carried forward, until the animal was euthanized. Curves terminated once >50% of mice had been euthanized in the respective treatment group. All analyses were conducted using R v3.2.2 ( https://cran.r-project.org/ ), with an assumed level of significance of \u03b1 = 0.05. Proteomic analysis : Fold change in expression for each phosphosite was calculated by log 2  transformation of the treatment relative to the vehicle mean for that genotype group. Fold change was ranked-ordered by the median of the treatment group for each genotype and for each condition, the top and bottom 15 proteins from the ranked list were plotted in balloon plots. A total of 98 protein sites passed quality control metrics and were used for analysis. Fold change in the expression for each protein was calculated as the protein expression relative to the vehicle mean for that genotype-time group. Proteins were rank-ordered on the  y -axis by the median transformed fold change for each treatment-genotype-time group and plotted from highest to lowest fold change. Each column represents a single animal. For the 4-h and 2-day time points, animals were plotted randomly on the x-axis. For the 21-day time point, animals were plotted on the  x -axis based on tumor size (largest to smallest) at sacrifice, corresponding to tumors 4\u20136, respectively, in the associated tumor-graft plots. The balloon color indicates the log 2  fold change in protein expression. Proteins with a greater than 4-fold increase or decrease in expression relative to the vehicle were plotted as log 2  fold change >2 or <\u22122, respectively. The balloon size indicates the absolute protein expression normalized to the total protein input and background. Head-tail balloon-maps were created by plotting the 30 proteins with the highest and lowest fold change in expression for each treatment-genotype-time group. Plots were generated using R v3.6.1. For pospho-AXL and phospho-NFkB correlation analysis, normality was first assessed by a Shapiro\u2013Wilk normality test. Correlations were analyzed by two-sided Spearman\u2019s rank correlation rho. For correlation plots, data were fit by stat_smooth using loess with span = 1 using ggplot2 (v3.2.1). Missing data points (due to a failure to meet RPPA quality control standards) were omitted from the analysis. All analyses were done using R (v3.6.2). 2.4.

  "introduction": "1. Introduction Targeting the RAS/ERK signaling pathway is an effective treatment for numerous cancers with hyper-activation of the RAS pathway. The most striking clinical responses to inhibitors of BRAF, MEK, and EGFR have been observed in melanoma and lung cancers where RAS pathway activation is intrinsic. Even though these targeted therapies have resulted in an extension of the overall survival in these inherently aggressive cancers, the clinical response is often transient and complete remission is rare. Resistance to kinase inhibition is a significant clinical challenge and numerous studies have identified multifactorial and heterogeneous mechanisms of resistance to kinase inhibition [ 1 ].  Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive, highly chemoresistant sarcomas arising from Schwann cells that are a leading cause of death in patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) [ 2 , 3 ]. Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is caused by germline mutations in the  NF1  gene and is the most common single-gene disorder, affecting 1 in 3000 live births. The  NF1  gene encodes neurofibromin, a GTPase-activating protein that negatively regulates RAS (including HRAS, NRAS, and KRAS), where the loss of NF1 leads to deregulated RAS signaling. Deregulated RAS signaling caused by the loss of neurofibromin is both permissive and instructive for MPNST progression (3\u20135). Recent clinical trials have focused on targeting members of the RAS signaling pathway or the PI3K/mTOR pathway. To date, these trials have failed to identify consistent therapeutic vulnerabilities in MPNSTs; however, few studies have examined why these therapies failed. These clinical results highlight our limited knowledge of the mechanisms that drive resistance to kinase inhibition in MPNSTs. In addition to loss of the  NF1  gene, NF1-related MPNSTs exhibit highly complex genomic alterations that result in substantial tumor suppressor gene loss and oncogene copy number variations [ 4 , 5 ]. How MPNST genomic alterations affect therapy resistance is currently unclear. Recently, we performed a genomic analysis of longitudinally collected MPNST samples. This study revealed the early concomitant presence of  MET ,  HGF , and  EGFR  amplifications, as well as the site-specific expansion of these loci over time and treatment. These data point to an adaptive mechanism involving RTK signaling for both malignant transformation and clonal selection in MPNSTs [ 6 ]. To advance our understanding of the MPNST therapeutic response and resistance to RAS pathway inhibition, we developed diverse preclinical NF1-related MPNST models, including an \u201cMET-addicted\u201d model of NF1-related MPNSTs (NF1-MET), an  Nf1/Trp53 -deficient model (NF1-P53), and an NF1 model (P53 WT ,  Hgf -amplified) [ 7 , 8 , 9 ]. Using these MPNST models, we determined that P53 deficiency significantly exacerbates resistance to MEK inhibition; however, combined MEK and MET inhibition overcame therapy resistance [ 6 ]. Importantly, these results demonstrated that NF1-related MPNSTs maintain multiple signaling dependencies beyond RAS, and that genomic determinants, such as P53 and RTK genomic alterations, profoundly influence the therapy response. Kinome reprogramming is a powerful barrier to a durable treatment response to kinase inhibition [ 10 , 11 , 12 ]. These signaling adaptations occur as a result of the compensatory activation of evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways that drive growth and proliferation, especially when central pathways such as RAS/MEK and PI3K/mTOR are blocked by drugs [ 13 ]. Kinome adaptation leads to diverse mechanisms of therapy resistance that can be classified as three categories, all of which can occur simultaneously during treatment [ 1 ]. The most common resistance mechanism is defined as \u201cpathway reactivation\u201d, which can occur through multiple mechanisms that reinforce oncogenic signaling in the face of strong target inhibition. The second common mechanism of resistance is \u201cpathway bypass\u201d, which occurs when oncogenic pathways are activated at a downstream convergence point by a parallel pathway, despite effective upstream inhibition (e.g., PI3K/AKT/ERK activation during MEK inhibition). The third resistance mechanism is \u201cpathway indifference\u201d, where the cancer cells transition to an alternative survival state that is independent of the targeted oncogenic pathway. Each of these resistance mechanisms have been observed in response to kinase inhibition in cancers with RAS-activation dependencies. Efforts to delineate patterns of therapy resistance have been valuable in understanding the treatment response and the identification of targets for salvage therapy. Even though genetic mechanisms of resistance (e.g., somatic mutations or gene amplifications) have been a major focus of resistance research, the impact of phosphoproteomic changes in therapeutic resistance has been increasingly acknowledged [ 1 ]. The mechanisms that regulate adaptive kinome reprogramming in NF1-deficient cancers are not well-elucidated. In this study, we aimed to define both mechanisms and categories of resistance to standard chemotherapy and targeted kinase inhibition in NF1-related MPNSTs in order to identify 1) novel therapeutic strategies that correlate with the genomic status or 2) salvage therapies that are focused on the emerging \u2018resistant\u2019 tumor populations. Kinome reprogramming can be heavily influenced by genomic alterations (i.e., amplification and mutation) of kinases, the overexpression of other kinases, or ligand activation [ 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 ]. Our genomic analysis of MPNST progression identified genomic events during human MPNST progression that heighten RTK signaling, AKT/mTOR activation, and cell survival [ 6 ]. To understand how these genomic contexts influence the therapy response to kinase inhibition, we conducted a phosphoproteomic analysis using a reverse phase protein array (RPPA) in our established MPNST mouse models. RPPA is a powerful research tool that simultaneously interrogates a broad range of phosphosites across the entire kinome, including activating, inactivating, and alternative sites. Using this comprehensive analytical technique, we confirmed substantial signaling heterogeneity following kinase inhibition in NF1-related MPNSTs leading to therapy resistance, including examples of pathway reactivation, bypass, and indifference. Our data verifies that a broad range of signaling pathways are activated as a result of effective MET, MEK, and MET/MEK blockade, most notably, AXL, NF\u03baB, RAS/RAF/MEK, and AKT/mTOR pathways. Interestingly, the patterns of kinome adaptation were distinct based on the kinase target and the genomic context of the tumor. We also demonstrated that administration of the DNA damaging reagent doxorubicin resulted in a distinct pattern of kinome adaptation that was partially, but not fully, mitigated by MET and MEK inhibitors. Categorizing these patterns of therapy resistance is valuable for inferring patient stratification and the identification of targets for salvage therapy.",
  "results": "3.2. Kinome Response to MEK Inhibition Results in Bypass Activation The recent clinical success of MEK inhibition with selumetinib in NF1 plexiform neurofibromas and recent preclinical MPNST treatment studies highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting MEK in NF1-related MPNSTs [ 28 , 29 , 30 ]. To evaluate the kinome response to MEK inhibition in NF1-deficient MPNSTs with distinctive genomic backgrounds, we used the MEK inhibitor trametinib (Novartis, Cambridge, MA, USA). Trametinib is a reversible, highly selective, allosteric inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2, which is FDA approved for melanoma, lung cancer, and anaplastic thyroid cancers with BRAF mutations. MEK inhibition significantly decreased tumor growth in all of the MPNST lines, yet substantial response heterogeneity was observed in the NF1-MET and NF1-P53 tumors ( Figure 2 A\u2013C) [ 6 ]. The most uniform tumor inhibition was observed in the NF1 MPNST tumors, whereas some NF1-P53 tumors still displayed aggressive growth after 21 days. As with capmatinib, RAS and AKT pathway inactivation (i.e., ERK1/2, mTOR, S6, and p90RSK) was observed after 4 h of trametinib in the NF1-MET and NF1-P53 tumors ( Figure 2 D,E). Interestingly, broader kinome activation was not observed in these same genomic contexts, suggesting that NF1-MET and NF1-P53 tumors maintain a limited MEK dependency due to innate resistance ( Figure 2 A,B,D,E;  Figure S2 ). Interestingly, by 2 days, trametinib treatment induced a similar response to capmatinib in the NF1-MET tumors, strongly activating EGFR (Y1068), AXL (Y702), PKCz (L410/T403), and NF\u03baB (S536) ( Figure 2 D;  Figure S5 ). In contrast, trametinib treatment resulted in the differential regulation of EGFR (Y1068) and AXL (702) in NF1-P53 tumors, as AXL (702) was upregulated, while EGFR (Y1068) was the most repressed site after 2 days ( Figure 2 D,E). AXL (Y07) was also highly induced after 2 days of trametinib treatment in the NF1 tumors ( Figure 2 F), suggesting that AXL activation may be a universal early response to MEK inhibition, regardless of the genetic context of the MPNST. Adaptive kinome reprogramming in response to trametinib was distinct for each model. In the NF1-MET tumors, AXL (Y702) remained activated after 21 days of treatment. 4EBP1 (T37/T46), CHK1 (S345), and AKT (e.g., SGK and AKT) phosphorylation was observed in response to long-term MEK inhibition ( Figure 2 D;  Figure S5 ). These results implicate a bypass mechanism of resistance to MEK inhibition, particularly in disparate signaling nodes within the AKT and mTOR pathways (i.e., SGK, CHK1, AKT, 4EBP1, and HSP27). Notably, after 21 days of treatment, 90% of NF1-P53 tumors had increasing growth trends and a negligible kinome response to MEK inhibition ( Figure 2 B,E). ERK was consistently inhibited by trametinib in these resistant tumors, confirming that ERK pathway reactivation was not required to maintain growth. In the NF1 tumors, AKT/mTOR and protein translation pathway effectors were the strongest targets activated by MEK inhibition. Collectively, the NF1-MET kinome response to both MET and MEK inhibition suggests that RTK-dependent MPNSTs may survive kinase inhibition both by the engagement of alternative RTKs (i.e., AXL and EGFR) and increasing AKT/mTOR signaling pathways.",
  "discussion": "4. Discussion Currently, there is no effective chemotherapy for NF1-related MPNSTs. Despite ongoing clinical trialing efforts, neither RTK nor downstream kinase inhibition has resulted in meaningful improvements in survival, despite well-founded attempts to target both the RAS/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. Fundamentally, RAS deregulation as a result of  NF1  deficiency appears to be more difficult to target than constitutive RAS activation. One possible reason for this difference is that fewer discrete signaling dependencies exist with  NF1  tumor suppressor loss than cancers that are critically dependent on RAS signaling as a result of activating RAS or EGFR mutations. That is to say, NF1-related MPNSTs are less susceptible to the perturbation of oncogenic signaling, unless a genomic event such as  MET  or  HGF  amplification exhausts the negative feedback loops that drive kinome adaptation. Our data confirms substantially broad and redundant kinome adaptation in NF1-related MPNSTs in response to MET or MEK inhibition. What is even more impressive is the diversity of early and late response mediators which sit atop prominent signaling cascades that regulate growth, proliferation, inflammation, and apoptosis. These data strongly point to an evolutionary advantage in clonal selection for cell populations that maintain this degree of signaling plasticity. Based on our findings, any successful treatment strategy that relies solely on kinase inhibition will be difficult to sustain. Even in our most ideal treatment scenario where the potent MET inhibitor capmatinib suppressed growth in MET-addicted MPNSTs, kinome adaptation occurred within 21 days, leading to a slight resumption in growth by the end of the study time frame. Proteomic profiling analysis provided significant insight into how the genomic context influenced the therapy response, particularly in the case of oncogene addiction. The \u201cMET-addicted\u201d NF1-MET tumor model is highly responsive to MET inhibition. We confirmed this finding with proteomic profiling by showing a sharp decrease in MET activation and downstream signaling immediately after capmatinib treatment. Even though MET inhibition was sustained at 2 days, strong AXL and AKT activation indicated the initiation of pathway reactivation and pathway bypass signaling. After 21 days of capmatinib treatment, resistant populations reprogrammed the kinome via AXL and EGFR. Besides activation of the AKT/mTOR pathway, ERK reactivation was consistently present in NF1-MET tumors, even in the minor cell populations that survived combined MET-MEK inhibition. In contrast to the MET-addicted tumors, few, if any, signaling dependencies were present in the capmatinib-treated NF1-P53 tumorgrafts. Interestingly, the pace and strength of kinome adaptations in NF1-P53 tumors were considerably reduced compared to NF1-MET and NF1 tumors. One possible reason for this observation is that MET inhibition failed to cause sufficient cellular stress to necessitate broad kinome adaptation in innately-resistant NF1-P53 tumors. MEK inhibition was confounded by a higher degree of innate resistance than MET inhibition and resulted in greater response heterogeneity and variability in kinome activation within genotype groups. As observed with MET inhibition in NF1-P53 tumors, less robust kinome activation was observed in response to trametinib in NF1-P53 tumors. In both capmatinib- and trametinib-treated tumors, inflammatory signaling was present at the 4-h time point, whereas kinase signaling associated with proliferation and invasion dominated at 2 days and 21 days. Inflammation has not been widely studied in MPNSTs; however, it is a key determinant of neurofibroma progression and Schwann cell homeostasis [ 40 , 41 , 42 ]. Based on our data, all treatments were associated with an initial inflammatory response directly mediated by the kinome. Multiple targets were implicated, including key members of the JAK/STAT signaling cascade; however, NFkB was the most consistently activated target. NFkB activation results in pleiotropic effects, including broad transcriptional activation, cytokine production, and cell survival. It is an early response element to cellular stress with a known ability to activate multiple kinases. How NFkB contributes to kinome adaptation is currently unknown. These results suggest that further investigations into the inflammatory signaling and the impact of the tumor microenvironment may identify additional therapeutic targets for NF1-related MPNSTs. AXL receptor activation was a consistent kinome adaptation observed in all of the MPNST models in response to kinase inhibition and doxorubicin treatment. Recently, AXL has been implicated in therapy resistance to multiple targeted therapies and cancer types, including MPNST. Resistance is often mediated through AXL dimerization with other RTKs, leading to the bypass of the RTK inhibitor effect [ 43 , 44 ]. For example, in ovarian tumors, AXL dimerizes with MET, EGFR, and HER2, leading to sustained ERK activation [ 45 ]. In response to ERK and MEK inhibition, AXL/MITF-mediated drug resistance is observed among mutant BRAF and NRAS melanoma cell lines [ 46 ]. AXL overexpression has also been observed in resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapies, such as docetaxel, in prostate cancer [ 47 ]. A principal role of AXL appears to be sustaining a mesenchymal phenotype, which is a mechanism of resistance to diverse anticancer therapies [ 43 ]. We demonstrated that AXL and NFkB activation are highly correlated, regardless of the treatment type or model genotype. These results strongly point to a unifying mechanism of therapy resistance in NF1-related MPNSTs. Therefore, further investigations into the efficacy of AXL or NFkB inhibition in conjunction with RAS pathway inhibitors in MPNSTs are warranted. In summary, the phosphoproteomic profiling of MET and MEK inhibition revealed distinct pathways of drug resistance involving AXL activation, ERK reactivation, and inflammatory kinase signaling. As expected from our previous studies, P53-null MPNSTs were innately resistant to kinase inhibition and demonstrated the most heterogeneous kinome responses; however, combined MET-MEK inhibition exposed potential vulnerabilities in these tumors. As with other RAS-activated tumors, pathway reactivation and bypass signaling are common mechanisms of therapeutic resistance. The results in this study point toward specific vulnerable signaling nodes in MPNSTs that may be exploited through novel combination therapeutic approaches.",
