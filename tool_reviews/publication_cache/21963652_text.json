  "abstract": "PET imaging for attention deficit preclinical drug testing in  neurofibromatosis-1 mice.  Brown JA(1), Xu J, Diggs-Andrews KA, Wozniak DF, Mach RH, Gutmann DH.  Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis,  MO 63110, USA.  Attention system abnormalities represent a significant barrier to scholastic  achievement in children with neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1). Using a novel mouse  model of NF1-associated attention deficit (ADD), we demonstrate a presynaptic  defect in striatal dopaminergic homeostasis and leverage this finding to apply  [(11)C]-raclopride positron-emission tomography (PET) in the intact animal.  While methylphenidate and l-Deprenyl correct both striatal dopamine levels on  PET imaging and defective attention system function in Nf1 mutant mice,  pharmacologic agents that target de-regulated cyclic AMP and RAS signaling in  these mice do not. These studies establish a robust preclinical model to  evaluate promising agents for NF1-associated ADD.  Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
