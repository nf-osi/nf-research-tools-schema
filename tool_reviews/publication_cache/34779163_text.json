  "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant neoplastic disease caused by mutations in the NF1 gene and one of the most challenging diseases to treat. Patients have a characteristic phenotype with neurofibromas as the main features in different forms, including numerous cutaneous neurofibromas, plexiform neurofibromas involving the primary nerves, or malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors with a very short survival period after malignant transformation. NF1 patients also suffer from multi-system involvement, with a high rate of deformity and disability, making complete surgical resection more difficult. Currently, there is no consensus on the diagnosis and treatment of NF1 in China, and different disciplines have different understandings of NF1. Multidisciplinary systematic evaluations and cooperative treatments are the keys to improve the treatment, quality of life, and prognosis of NF1 patients. In 2020, the Department of Plastic Surgery of the Ninth People's Hospital of Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine led the establishment of the first multi-center collaboration group for NF1 in China. Furthermore, the group had worked with renowned experts from the various departments including surgical oncology, medical oncology, dermatology, reproductive medicine,",
