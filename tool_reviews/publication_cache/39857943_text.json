  "abstract": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a rare but aggressive soft-tissue sarcoma characterized by poor response to therapy. The primary treatment remains surgical resection with negative margins. Nonetheless, in the setting of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), the five-year survival rate is at 20-50%, with recurrence occurring in up to 50% of individuals. For patients with metastatic and unresectable disease, current treatment options include cytotoxic chemotherapy, which offers minimal benefit, and most patients die within five years of diagnosis. Despite advances in targeted therapy focusing on inhibiting Ras signaling and its downstream effectors, clinical trials report minimal clinical benefit, highlighting the need to explore alternative pathways in MPNST pathogenesis. Here, we discuss the role of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, UBR5, in cancer progression and immune modulation across various malignancies, including breast, lung, and ovarian cancer. We focus on mechanisms by which UBR5 contributes to tumorigenesis, focusing on its influence on tumor microenvironment and immune modulation. Additionally, we explore UBR5's roles in normal tissue function, DNA damage response, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance, illustrating its multifaceted contribution to cancer biology. We discuss evidence implicating UBR5 in immune evasion and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target to enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy in MPNST, a tumor typically characterized by an immune cold microenvironment. We outline current immune-based strategies and challenges in MPNST management, ongoing efforts to shift the immune landscape in MPNST, and ultimately, we suggest that targeting UBR5 could be a novel strategy to potentiate ICB therapy-mediated anti-tumor immune response and clinical outcomes, particularly in MPNST patients with inoperable or metastatic disease.",
