  "abstract": "Phase I trial and pharmacokinetic study of sorafenib in children with  neurofibromatosis type I and plexiform neurofibromas.

Author information: (1)Pediatric Oncology Branch, NCI, CCR, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.  aekim@childrensnational.org  BACKGROUND: Sorafenib targets multiple pathways thought to be crucial in growth  of plexiform neurofibroma (PN) in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).  Sorafenib has been tolerated with manageable toxicities in adults and children  with refractory cancer. We conducted a separate study in this population.  Monitoring long-term toxicities such as effects on growth and obtaining  additional pharmacokinetic data were of importance due to the young age and long  duration of therapy seen in previous phase I trials in children with NF1. PROCEDURE: Children ≥3 and ≤18-year-old with NF1 and inoperable PN were  eligible. Sorafenib was administered orally twice daily for consecutive 28-day  cycles. Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined from toxicities observed  during the first three cycles. RESULTS: Nine children enrolled, median age 8 (6-12) years. At the starting  115 mg/m(2) /dose (n = 5), two experienced dose-limiting grade 3 pain in their  PN. At the de-escalated 80 mg/m(2) /dose (n = 4), approximately 40% of the  pediatric solid tumor MTD, two had dose-limiting toxicity (grade 3 rash and  grade 4 mood alteration), exceeding the MTD. At 80 mg/m(2) /dose, the median  AUC(0-12 hours) at steady-state was 39.5 µg hours/ml. Toxicities appeared to  correspond with decreases in quality of life (QOL). No tumor shrinkage was  observed. CONCLUSIONS: Children with NF1 and PN did not tolerate sorafenib at doses  substantially lower than the MTD in children and adults with malignant solid  tumors. Future trials with targeted agents for children with NF1 may require a  more conservative starting dose and separate definitions of dose limiting  toxicities (DLT) than children with cancer.
