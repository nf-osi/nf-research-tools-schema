  "abstract": "Nf1 deficiency cooperates with oncogenic K-RAS to induce acute myeloid leukemia  in mice.  Cutts BA(1), Sjogren AK, Andersson KM, Wahlstrom AM, Karlsson C, Swolin B, Bergo  MO.  Author information: (1)Wallenberg Laboratory, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska University  Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.  Hyperactive RAS signaling is caused by mutations in RAS genes or a deficiency of  the neurofibromatosis gene (NF1) and is common in myeloid malignancies. In mice,  expression of oncogenic K-RAS or inactivation of Nf1 in hematopoietic cells  results in myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) that do not progress to acute  myeloid leukemia (AML). Because NF1 is a RAS-GTPase-activating protein it has  been proposed that NF1 deficiency is functionally equivalent to an oncogenic  RAS. It is not clear, however, whether Nf1 deficiency would be redundant in  K-RAS-induced MPD development or whether the 2 mutations would cooperate in  leukemogenesis. Here, we show that the simultaneous inactivation of Nf1 and  expression of K-RAS(G12D) in mouse hematopoietic cells results in AML that was  fatal in primary mice within 4 weeks and transplantable to sublethally  irradiated secondary recipients. The data point to a strong cooperation between  Nf1 deficiency and oncogenic K-RAS.  DOI: 10.1182/blood-2009-02-205146 PMID: 19710506 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",
