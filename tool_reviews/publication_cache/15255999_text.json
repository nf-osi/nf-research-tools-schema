  "title": "Molecular profiling of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors associated with neurofibromatosis type 1, based on large-scale real-time RT-PCR.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder with a complex range of clinical symptoms. The hallmark of NF1 is the onset of heterogeneous (dermal or plexiform) benign neurofibromas. Plexiform neurofibromas can give rise to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), and the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. RESULTS: To obtain further insight into the molecular pathogenesis of MPNSTs, we used real-time quantitative RT-PCR to quantify the mRNA expression of 489 selected genes in MPNSTs, in comparison with plexiform neurofibromas. The expression of 28 (5.7%) of the 489 genes was significantly different between MPNSTs and plexiform neurofibromas; 16 genes were upregulated and 12 were downregulated in MPNSTs. The altered genes were mainly involved in cell proliferation (MKI67, TOP2A, CCNE2), senescence (TERT, TERC), apoptosis (BIRC5/Survivin, TP73) and extracellular matrix remodeling (MMP13, MMP9, TIMP4, ITGB4). More interestingly, other genes were involved in the Ras signaling pathway (RASSF2, HMMR/RHAMM) and the Hedgehog-Gli signaling pathway (DHH, PTCH2). Several of the down-regulated genes were Schwann cell-specific (L1CAM, MPZ, S100B, SOX10, ERBB3) or mast cell-specific (CMA1, TPSB), pointing to a depletion and/or dedifferentiation of Schwann cells and mast cells during malignant transformation of plexiform neurofibromas. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that a limited number of signaling pathways, and particularly the Hedgehog-Gli signaling pathway, may be involved in malignant transformation of plexiform neurofibromas. Some of the relevant genes or their products warrant further investigation as potential therapeutic targets in NF1.",

  "methods": "Methods Patients and Samples Samples of 14 plexiform neurofibromas and 9 MPNSTs were obtained by surgical excision from patients with NF1 at Henri Mondor hospital (Creteil, France). The plexiform neurofibromas (deep lesions involving a plexus of nerves) were large, had a nodular aspect, and severely deformed the affected tissues. They were all S100-positive by immunostaining. The main clinical and histological characteristics of the 9 patients with MPNSTs are shown in Table  1 . The MPNSTs all arose from plexiform neurofibromas and showed very weak S100 immunostaining. Ten dermal neurofibromas were used as \"normal\" controls, as they are not at risk of developing into malignant MPNSTs. Neurofibromas are heterogeneous benign tumors composed of Schwann cells, neurons, fibroblasts, mast cells and other cells, and have no \"normal\" tissue equivalent. The 489 gene expression levels in plexiform neurofibromas and MPNSTs were thus expressed relative to the expression levels in dermal neurofibromas. The dermal neurofibromas were obtained by laser excision from patients free of plexiform neurofibromas. They affected the dermis and subcutis, and were soft, slightly elevated, painless and smaller than 20 mm. Immediately after surgery the tumor samples were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00b0C until RNA extraction. Real-time RT-PCR Theoretical basis Reactions are characterized by the point during cycling when amplification of the PCR product is first detected, rather than the amount of PCR product accumulated after a fixed number of cycles. The larger the starting quantity of the target molecule, the earlier a significant increase in fluorescence is observed. The parameter C t  (threshold cycle) is defined as the fractional cycle number at which the fluorescence generated by cleavage of a TaqMan probe (or by SYBR green dye-amplicon complex formation) passes a fixed threshold above baseline. The increase in fluorescent signal associated with exponential growth of PCR products is detected by the laser detector of the ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), using PE Biosystems analysis software according to the manufacturer's manuals. The precise amount of total RNA added to each reaction mix (based on optical density) and its quality (i.e. lack of extensive degradation) are both difficult to assess. We therefore also quantified transcripts of two endogenous RNA control genes involved in two cellular metabolic pathways, namely  TBP  (Genbank accession  NM_003194 ), which encodes the TATA box-binding protein (a component of the DNA-binding protein complex TFIID), and  RPLP0  (also known as 36B4;  NM_001002 ), which encodes human acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0. Each sample was normalized on the basis of its  TBP  (or  RPLPO ) content. Results, expressed as N-fold differences in target gene expression relative to the  TBP  (or  RPLPO ) gene, and termed \"N target \", were determined as  , where the \u0394Ct value of the sample was determined by subtracting the average Ct value of the target gene from the average Ct value of the  TBP  ( or RPLP0 ) gene [ 56 , 57 ]. The N target  values of the samples were subsequently normalized such that the mean of the dermal neurofibroma N target  values was 1. Primers and controls Primers for  TBP ,  RPLP0  and the 489 target genes (List in annex; supplementary information) were chosen with the assistance of the Oligo 5.0 computer program (National Biosciences, Plymouth, MN). We conducted searches in dbEST, htgs and nr databases to confirm the total gene specificity of the nucleotide sequences chosen as primers, and the absence of single nucleotide polymorphisms. In particular, the primer pairs were selected to be unique relative to the sequences of closely related family member genes or of the corresponding retropseudogenes. To avoid amplification of contaminating genomic DNA, one of the two primers was placed at the junction between two exons, if possible. In general, amplicons were between 70 and 120 nucleotides long. Gel electrophoresis was used to verify the specificity of PCR amplicons. For each primer pair, we performed no-template control (NTC) and no-reverse-transcriptase control (RT negative) assays, which produced negligible signals (usually > 40 in Ct value), suggesting that primer-dimer formation and genomic DNA contamination effects were negligible. RNA extraction Total RNA was extracted from frozen tumor samples by using the acid-phenol guanidinium method. The quality of the RNA samples was determined by electrophoresis through agarose gels and staining with ethidium bromide, the 18S and 28S RNA bands being visualized under ultraviolet light. cDNA Synthesis Total RNA was reverse transcribed in a final volume of 20 \u03bcl containing 1X RT buffer (500 \u03bcM each dNTP, 3 mM MgCl2, 75 mM KCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3), 20 units of RNasin RNase inhibitor (Promega, Madison, WI), 10 mM DDT, 100 units of Superscript II RNase H-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France), 3 \u03bcM random hexamers (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) and 100 ng of total RNA. The samples were incubated at 20\u00b0C for 10 min and 42\u00b0C for 30 min, and reverse transcriptase was inactivated by heating at 99\u00b0C for 5 min and cooling at 5\u00b0C for 5 min. PCR amplification All PCR reactions were performed using an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems) and either the TaqMan \u00ae  PCR Core REAGENTS Kit or the SYBR \u00ae  Green PCR Core Reagents kit (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems). Ten microliters of diluted sample cDNA (produced from 2 ng of total RNA) was added to 15 microliters of the PCR master-mix. The thermal cycling conditions comprised an initial denaturation step at 95\u00b0C for 10 min, and 50 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 65\u00b0C for 1 min. Statistical Analysis As the mRNA levels did not fit a Gaussian distribution, (a) the mRNA levels in each subgroup of samples were characterized by their median values and ranges, rather than their mean values and coefficients of variation, and (b) relationships between the molecular markers and clinical and histological parameters were tested using the non parametric Mann-Whitney  U  test [ 58 ]. Differences between two populations were judged significant at confidence levels greater than 95% (p < 0.05). To visualize the capacity of a given molecular marker to discriminate between two populations (in the absence of an arbitrary cutoff value), we summarized the data in a ROC ( receiver operating characteristic ) curve [ 59 ]. This curve plots the sensitivity (true positives) on the  Y  axis against 1-specificity (false positives) on the  X  axis, considering each value as a possible cutoff. The AUC (area under curve) was calculated as a single measure for the discriminatory capacity of each molecular marker. When a molecular marker had no discriminatory value, the ROC curve lies close to the diagonal and the AUC is close to 0.5. In contrast, when a molecular marker has strong discriminatory value, the ROC curve moves to the upper left-hand corner and the AUC is close to 1.0.",

  "introduction": "Background Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous disorder affecting 1 in 3000 individuals worldwide [ 1 ]. The NF1 gene, located on chromosome 17q11.2, was identified by positional cloning, and its protein product, neurofibromin, functions as a tumor suppressor [ 2 , 3 ]. Neurofibromin contains a central domain homologous to the Ras-GTPase-activating protein family (Ras-GAPs), which function as negative regulators of Ras proteins [ 4 ]. The main clinical features of NF1 are  caf\u00e9 au lait  macules, skinfold freckling and iris Lisch nodules. Patients are at an increased risk of both benign and malignant tumors, and NF1 is thus classified as a tumor predisposition syndrome. The most common tumors are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors (neurofibromas), which vary greatly in both number and size, and may be dermal or plexiform [ 5 ]. In contrast to dermal neurofibromas, which are typically small and grow as discrete lesions in the dermis, plexiform neurofibromas can develop internally along the plexus of major peripheral nerves and become quite large [ 6 ]. Both dermal and plexiform neurofibromas are heterogeneous tumors mainly composed of Schwann cells (60\u201380%), together with neurons, fibroblasts, mast cells and other cells. About 5% of patients with NF1, neurofibromas (mainly plexiform neurofibromas) progress to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). More than 80% of MPNSTs are high-grade malignant tumors, corresponding to WHO grade III-IV [ 7 ]. MPNSTs are resistant to conventional therapies, and their deep-seated position and locally invasive growth hinder complete surgical resection. The 5-year survival rate among patients with MPNSTs ranges from 30\u201350%. Schwann cells are considered to be the progenitors of both neurofibromas and MPNSTs, but recent data suggest that other cell types may contribute to the development of these tumors [ 8 ]. The molecular mechanisms responsible for malignant progression of neurofibromas are largely unknown. Only a few relevant genetic alterations have so far been identified [ 9 , 10 ]. In keeping with its role as a classical tumor suppressor gene,  NF1  loss of heterozygosity (LOH) has been found in NF1-associated MPNSTs (but also in benign neurofibromas) [ 11 ].  TP53  mutations have been identified in MPNSTs but not in benign neurofibromas, indicating that the p53-mediated pathway is involved in tumor progression [ 12 - 14 ]. Consistent with the role of p53 in the progression of MPNSTs, mice that harbor both  NF1  and  TP53  mutations develop MPNSTs [ 15 ]. Alterations of other genes ( p16/CDKN2A ,  p14/ARF ,  p27/KIP1 ,  EGFR ) are frequent in MPNSTs but not in neurofibromas [ 16 - 20 ]. Taken together, these studies suggest that loss of NF1 initiates tumor formation, and that malignant progression requires additional genetic lesions. The recent development of efficient tools for large-scale analysis of gene expression has provided new insights into the involvement of gene networks and regulatory pathways in various tumoral processes [ 21 ]. These methods include cDNA microarrays, which can be used to analyze the expression of thousands of genes at a time, and real-time RT-PCR assays for more accurate and quantitative expression analysis of smaller numbers of candidate genes [ 22 ]. To obtain further insight into the molecular pathogenesis of MPNSTs, we used real-time quantitative RT-PCR to quantify the mRNA expression of a large number of selected genes in pooled MPNST samples, in comparison with pooled plexiform neurofibroma samples. We assessed the expression level of 489 genes involved in various cellular and molecular phenomena associated with tumorigenesis. We focused particularly on the expression of genes related to MPNSTs, and genes expressed during Schwann cell differentiation. Forty genes of interest were further investigated in nine individual MPNSTs (all arising from plexiform neurofibromas), in comparison with 14 plexiform neurofibromas.",
  "results": "Results We first quantified the mRNA expression level of the 489 genes (see list in annex;  Additional file 1 ) in an MPNST pool, a plexiform neurofibroma pool and a dermal neurofibroma pool. We then selected for further study those genes whose expression in the MPNST pool differed markedly (> 10-fold) from that in both the plexiform neurofibroma pool and the dermal neurofibroma pool. These robust selection criteria (a cutoff of 10-fold expression difference in the MPNST pool) ensure identification of gene with marked interest. The mRNA expression of the genes thus identified was then determined in 9 individual MPNSTs (Table  1 ) in comparison with 14 plexiform neurofibromas.

The mean  TBP  gene Ct (threshold cycle) values for the four tumor samples were 26.18 \u00b1 0.39 (MPNST pool), 26.23 \u00b1 1.45 (plexiform neurofibroma pool) and 26.30 \u00b1 0.47 (dermal neurofibroma pool). Very low levels of target gene mRNA, that were only detectable but not reliably quantifiable by means of real-time quantitative RT-PCR assays, mainly based on fluorescence SYBR Green methodology (Ct >32), were observed for 50 (10.2%) of the 489 genes in the MPNST, plexiform and dermal neurofibroma pools. Forty (9.1%) of the 439 remaining genes were expressed at a different level (> 10-fold) in the MPNST pool compared to both the dermal neurofibroma and plexiform neurofibroma pools; 27 (6.1%) genes were upregulated and 13 (3.0%) were down-regulated. The  NF1  gene expression level did not differ between the dermal neurofibroma, plexiform neurofibroma and MPNST pools: the N NF1  values (see Patients and Methods) were 1.00, 1.39 and 1.45, respectively. This lack of difference was probably due to the fact that the  NF1  gene is ubiquitously expressed and therefore expressed in the different cell components of the neurofibromas and MPNSTs, and that NF1 -/-  Schwann cells represent only a fraction of the total Schwann cell population in tumor samples. mRNA expression of the 27 upregulated genes in 9 MPNSTs and 14 plexiform neurofibromas The expression level of the 27 upregulated genes identified by pooled sample analysis was then determined individually in 9 MPNSTs and 14 plexiform neurofibromas. Sixteen (59.3%) of the 27 genes were significantly upregulated in the 9 MPNSTs (P < 0.05; Table  2 ).

The others down-regulated genes were involved in extracellular matrix remodeling ( ITGB4 ,  TIMP4 ) and in the Hedgehog-Gli signaling pathway ( DHH ,  PTCH2 ). The capacity of each of these 12 genes to discriminate between MPNSTs and plexiform neurofibromas was then tested by ROC curve analysis.

The mRNA levels indicated in Tables  2  and  3  (calculated as described in  Materials and Methods ) are expressed relative to the endogenous control  TBP  mRNA level, to control for the starting amount and quality of total RNA. Similar results were obtained with a second endogenous control,  RPLP0  (also known as  36B4 ). Indeed, the 16 upregulated genes and the 12 down-regulated genes were also significantly up-regulated or down-regulated in the MPNSTs relative to the plexiform neurofibromas.",
  "discussion": "Conclusions In conclusion, this study points to the involvement of several altered molecular pathways, and especially the Hedgehog-Gli signaling pathway, in the tumorigenesis of NF1-associated MPNST. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the genetic (or epigenetic) mechanisms responsible for the altered gene expression. It will be of interest to study the genes identified here in sporadic MPNSTs and in other neurological tumors (medulloblastomas, oligodendrogliomas, astrocytomas, neuroblastomas and schwannomas).",
