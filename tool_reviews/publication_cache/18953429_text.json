  "abstract": "The neurofibromatosis 2 tumor suppressor gene product, merlin, regulates human  meningioma cell growth by signaling through YAP.  Striedinger K(1), VandenBerg SR, Baia GS, McDermott MW, Gutmann DH, Lal A.  Author information: (1)Brain Tumor Research Center, Department of Neurological Surgery, University  of California, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized  by the occurrence of schwannomas and meningiomas. Several studies have examined  the ability of the NF2 gene product, merlin, to function as a tumor suppressor  in diverse cell types; however, little is known about merlin growth regulation  in meningiomas. In Drosophila, merlin controls cell proliferation and apoptosis  by signaling through the Hippo pathway to inhibit the function of the  transcriptional coactivator Yorkie. The Hippo pathway is conserved in mammals.  On the basis of these observations, we developed human meningioma cell lines  matched for merlin expression to evaluate merlin growth regulation and  investigate the relationship between NF2 status and Yes-associated protein  (YAP), the mammalian homolog of Yorkie. NF2 loss in meningioma cells was  associated with loss of contact-dependent growth inhibition, enhanced  anchorage-independent growth and increased cell proliferation due to increased  S-phase entry. In addition, merlin loss in both meningioma cell lines and  primary tumors resulted in increased YAP expression and nuclear localization.  Finally, siRNA-mediated reduction of YAP in NF2-deficient meningioma cells  rescued the effects of merlin loss on cell proliferation and S-phase entry.  Collectively, these results represent the first demonstration that merlin  regulates cell growth in human cancer cells by suppressing YAP.
