Author information: (1)Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710.  The von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1) gene has been localized to the  pericentromeric region of chromosome 17. We have screened six multigenerational  families with multiple, tightly linked markers to aid in mapping this region of  the chromosome. More than 150 members in six families were typed with probes  including HHH202, D17Z1, EW203, EW206, EW207, EW301, pA10-41, D17S37, and  D17S36. Two-point lod scores for NF1 versus all markers were calculated. HHH202  demonstrated the tightest linkage to NF1 with theta = .0, z = 3.86 (95%  confidence limits [CL] of theta = .0-.13), suggesting that HHH202 be considered  as a potential candidate marker for use in carrier detection and prenatal  diagnosis. Pairwise marker-to-marker lod scores were used in examining the most  likely order of subsets of the markers. Of those tested, the most likely order  was (pter)-pA10-41-EW301-D17Z1-HHH202-NF1-E W206-EW207-EW203-(qter). In  addition, we have ascertained an NF1 x NF1 half-cousin mating in which there are  four affected family members who are potentially homozygous for the disease  gene. Two of these four individuals have been sampled and typed for marker loci.  When their D17Z1 genotypes are considered, the probability that both these  individuals are heterozygous is 85%.
