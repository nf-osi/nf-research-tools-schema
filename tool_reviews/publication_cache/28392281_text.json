The future of precision medicine is heavily reliant on the use of human tissues  to identify the key determinants that account for differences between  individuals with the same disorder. This need is exemplified by the  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) neurogenetic condition. As such, individuals with  NF1 are born with a germline mutation in the NF1 gene, but may develop numerous  distinct neurological problems, ranging from autism and attention deficit to  brain and peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Coupled with accurate preclinical  mouse models, the availability of NF1 patient-derived induced pluripotent stem  cells (iPSCs) provides new opportunities to define the critical factors that  underlie NF1-associated nervous system disease pathogenesis and progression. In  this review, we discuss the generation and potential applications of iPSC  technology to the study of NF1.  Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
