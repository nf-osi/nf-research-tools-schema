  "abstract": "Merlin, encoded by the NF2 gene, is a tumor suppressor that acts by inhibiting mitogenic signaling and is mutated in Neurofibromatosis type II (NF2) disease, although its molecular mechanism is not fully understood. Here, we observed that Merlin inhibited Wnt/β-catenin signaling by blocking phosphorylation of LRP6, which is necessary for Wnt signal transduction, whereas mutated Merlin in NF2 patients did not. Treatment with Wnt3a enhanced phosphorylation of Ser518 in Merlin via activation of PAK1 in a PIP2-dependent manner. Phosphorylated Merlin dissociated from LRP6, allowing for phosphorylation of LRP6. Tissues from NF2 patients exhibited higher levels of β-catenin, and proliferation of RT4-D6P2T rat schwannoma cells was significantly reduced by treatment with chemical inhibitors of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Taken together, our findings suggest that sustained activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling due to abrogation of Merlin-mediated inhibition of LRP6 phosphorylation may be a cause of NF2 disease.",
