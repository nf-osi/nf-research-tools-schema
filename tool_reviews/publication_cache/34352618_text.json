  "abstract": "The UMi031-A-2 hiPSC line contains a CRISPR-induced homozygous, Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) mutation (L64P (CTG > CCG)) in the NF2 gene that encodes a merlin tumor suppressor. This line was generated from an unaffected iPSC line using CRISPR technology and characterized for pluripotency and karyotypic stability. The c.191 T > C variant in NF2 is associated with a syndromic nervous system tumor disorder leading to the development of bilateral vestibular schwannomas. Once differentiated into Schwann cells, UMi031-A-2 can serve as a resource for the analysis of signaling pathways deregulated upon merlin defects and provide a pre-clinical platform for testing therapies for NF2 schwannomas.",
