  "title": "Icariin Promotes Osteogenic Differentiation in a Cell Model with NF1 Gene Knockout by Activating the cAMP/PKA/CREB Pathway.",
  "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder, with up to 50% of patients clinically displaying skeletal defects. Currently, the pathogenesis of bone disorders in NF1 patients is unclear, and there are no effective preventive and treatment measures. In this study, we found that knockout of the NF1 gene reduced cAMP levels and osteogenic differentiation in an osteoblast model, and icariin activated the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway to promote osteoblast differentiation of the NF1 gene knockout cell model by increasing intracellular cAMP levels. The PKA selective inhibitor H89 significantly impaired the stimulatory effect of icariin on osteogenesis in the NF1 cell model. In this study, an osteoblast model of NF1 was successfully constructed, and icariin was applied to the cell model for the first time. The results will help to elucidate the molecular mechanism of NF1 bone disease and provide new ideas for the clinical prevention and treatment of NF1 bone disease and drug development in the future.",

Transcriptome sequencing. The gene expression profile of the 2-7 cell line during icariin-induced osteoblast differentiation was analyzed with RNA-seq technology. When cultures in 25 cm 2  culture bottles reached confluence, the medium was replaced by a differentiation medium with or without icariin, and incubation was continued for seven days. The total RNA of each sample was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Albuquerque, NM, USA). The quality of the RNA was assessed by Sangon Biotech Co.

Finally, PCR products were purified (AMPure XP system), and the libraries were quantified and pooled. After RNA-seq library construction, paired-end sequencing of the library was performed on HiSeq XTen sequencers (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). DESeq2 (version 1.12.4) was used to determine differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between two samples. Genes were considered to be significantly differentially expressed with q-value < 0.001 and |FoldChange| > 2. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed to identify which DEGs were significantly enriched in GO terms or metabolic pathways.

Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Albuquerque, NM, USA) according to the manual. Then, the RNA samples were reverse transcribed into cDNA using a PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (TaKaRa, Japan). Real-time quantitative PCR detection was performed to determine the mRNA expression levels of NF1, ALP, Runx2, Osx and Col1a1 with FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master (Rox) on a LightCycler \u00ae  480 II Real-Time PCR System (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The conditions were 95 \u00b0C for 5 min, 95 \u00b0C for 30 s, and 45 cycles of 60 \u00b0C for 30 s and 72 \u00b0C for 45 s.

Cells seeded in 25 cm 2  culture bottles were lysed with cold RIPA Lysate reagent (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The protein concentrations were measured with the BCA assay kit. Proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to 0.45 \u00b5m PVDF membranes (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Hesse-Darmstadt, Germany). After the membranes were blocked, they were incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with the diluted primary antibodies against the following molecules: neurofibromin, PKA, phosphorylated PKA, CREB, phosphorylated CREB and GAPDH. Then, the membranes were washed with TBST and incubated with diluted secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature.

  "introduction": "1. Introduction Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), also known as von Recklinghausen disease, is an autosomal dominant disease with an incidence of 1:3000 [ 1 ]. The National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) defines this condition as a typical rare disorder. Clinically, NF1 is mainly characterized by peripheral nerve and brain tumors, pigmented lesions, visceral dysfunction, and distinctive skeletal lesions. Up to 50% of NF1 patients will have bone dysplasia [ 2 ]. Several skeletal manifestations are clinically associated with NF1, including osteopenia or osteoporosis, macrocephaly, short stature, scoliosis, kyphoscoliosis, chest wall and sphenoid dysplasia, and congenital tibial pseudarthrosis [ 3 ]. The most common skeletal feature is decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and an increased incidence of osteoporosis [ 4 , 5 ]. However, the mechanism of bone disease in NF1 patients is unclear, and there are no effective preventive and therapeutic measures. Surgery is the main treatment for skeletal disorders in NF1 patients. However, postoperative deformities may develop further, the incidence of pseudarthrosis is high, and some patients require amputation, resulting in substantial pain and economic burdens on patients [ 3 ]. Recently, gene studies have confirmed that mutation of the NF1 gene is an essential cause of NF1 [ 6 ]. The NF1 gene encodes neurofibromin, a multifunctional, cytoplasmic protein involved in several cellular signaling pathways. Its main functional area is the GAP-related domain (GRD), which has homology with the GTP-activated protein (GAP) family. This protein promotes the activated form of Ras bound to GTP to hydrolyze to the non-activated form of Ras bound to GDP, thereby acting as a negative regulator that terminates RAS-mediated signaling pathways [ 7 ]. In addition to the Ras GTPase function, neurofibromin also contains a domain rich in cysteine and serine, which may be related to regulating the activity of adenylate cyclase (AC), so the deletion of neurofibromin also leads to a dysfunctional of cAMP signaling pathway [ 8 ]. Mutations in one or two NF1 alleles result in the loss of effects of neurofibromin, leading to a dysfunctional downstream signaling pathway and ultimately to abnormal cell proliferation and tumor growth [ 9 ]. Abnormally regulated osteoblast and osteoclast activity is present in patients with NF1. Haploid dysfunction of NF1 may affect the function of bone cells, resulting in decreased bone mass and mineral content [ 10 , 11 ]. Data from clinical studies have demonstrated a significantly increased incidence of fractures in adult and elderly patients with NF1 compared with those not affected by the disease [ 12 , 13 ]. Bone biopsies from children with NF1 showed that osteoblasts in pseudo joints were less responsive to osteogenic differentiation signals than those from unaffected sites [ 14 ]. During normal intramembranous and endochondral osteogenesis in humans and animals, neurofibromin expression can be detected in osteoblasts and mature osteocytes [ 15 ]. Wu et al. demonstrated that neurofibromin plays a key role in regulating the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into osteoblasts in NF1+/\u2212 mice [ 16 ]. Research on a mouse model lacking the osteoblast NF1 allele revealed decreased osteoblast function and a high bone turnover phenotype characterized by increased collagen synthesis and bone formation, delayed mineralization, and increased osteoclasts mediated by RANKL [ 17 ]. Icariin, as the main active component of Epimedium, can significantly promote the calcification and maturation of osteoblasts, inhibit the bone resorption activity of osteoclasts, and induce their apoptosis [ 18 , 19 ]. A recent study showed that icariin could promote osteoblast gene expression and prevent osteoporosis by activating the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway [ 20 ]. Osteopenia and osteoporosis are the most common symptoms of the skeletal system in NF1 patients [ 4 , 5 , 21 ]. The loss of neurofibromin in NF1 disease leads to abnormalities of the cAMP signaling pathway. Therefore, cAMP can be used as a key factor to link icariin to the treatment of NF1 bone diseases. In this study, we employed a lentiviral vector carrying the CRISPR/CAS9 system to transfect C2C12 cells for targeted knockout of the NF1 gene. CRISPR/Cas9 is a technology that enables precise editing of specific sites in the genome of any species. Single or multiple gene knockouts at the cellular level can be performed using this technique. C2C12 is a subclone of a mouse myoblast cell line established by D. Yaffe and O. Saxel [ 22 ]. This line can differentiate in different directions to skeletal muscle, bone, and cartilage under different induction conditions. Therefore, the C2C12 mouse myoblast line is widely used as a model cell of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells and is often used in studying bone cell development [ 23 , 24 , 25 ]. Finally, two stable C2C12 cell lines with NF1 gene knockout were obtained, and an osteoblast differentiation cell model with NF1 gene knockout was successfully constructed. After the deletion of the NF1 gene, we found that the expression of neurofibromin was decreased, and the intracellular cAMP level was reduced compared with those of the normal control group. Moreover, the osteogenic differentiation of the cell model was significantly impaired. Next, icariin was added during the osteogenic differentiation process of the NF1 gene knockout cell model to observe its effect. Finally, we found that icariin could promote the osteogenic differentiation of the NF1 gene knockout C2C12 cell model, and this effect was mediated by activating the intracellular cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling pathway. This research will help elucidate the molecular mechanism of NF1 skeletal disorders. This study will provide new ideas and targets for the prevention and treatment of NF1 skeletal diseases and contribute to drug research in the future. Therefore, there is important theoretical significance and application value.",

Two Lines of C2C12 Cells with NF1 Gene Knockout Were Successfully Constructed We used the CRISPR/Cas9 single-vector lentivirus LV-NF1-sgRNA to introduce the Cas9 protein and sgRNA sequence into C2C12 cells to knock out the NF1 gene. Through identification assays, 2\u22127 and 2\u221212 with the NF1 gene knockout were successfully selected. We divided the cells into four groups: the normal control group C, the negative control group NC transfected with negative lentivirus, and the group of stable cell lines (2\u22127 and 2\u221212) transfected with the positive lentivirus LV-NF1-sgRNA. As shown in  Figure 1 A, we designed and synthesized primers upstream and downstream of the sgRNA target site and performed gene sequencing on the four groups of cells. The sequencing results showed that nested peaks appeared at the position of the corresponding sgRNA in the 2\u22127 and 2\u221212 cell lines; however, group C and group NC did not show nesting peaks. The results confirmed that gene editing was carried out at the correct target after LV-NF1-sgRNA transfection. As shown in  Figure 1 B, the mRNA expression levels of NF1 in the 2\u22127 and 2\u221212 groups were significantly lower than those in groups C and NC. The difference was statistically significant. Similarly, as shown in  Figure 1 C, the protein expression levels of neurofibromin in the four groups were evaluated by Western blotting. The results showed that the expression of neurofibromin in group C and group NC was normal. However, neurofibromin expression was undetectable in 2\u22127 and 2\u221212 cell lines. As shown in  Figure 1 D, immunofluorescence staining was used to detect the expression of neurofibromin in the four groups. The results showed that the expression of neurofibromin in group C and group NC was normal, and the fluorescence signal was obvious. However, neurofibromin was almost undetectable in groups 2\u22127 and 2\u221212, and no obvious fluorescence was observed. The results were consistent with those of Western blotting. Through the above series of identification, we successfully constructed two stable C2C12 cell lines with NF1 gene knockout, namely, 2\u22127 and 2\u221212. This result laid the foundation for further study of the osteogenic differentiation in cells with NF1 gene knockout. 2.2. The Osteogenic Differentiation and the Intracellular cAMP Level of the C2C12 Cells with NF1 Gene Knockout Were Significantly Reduced Two strains of C2C12 cells with NF1 gene knockout and the normal control group cells were all induced to undergo osteogenic differentiation. The cells were collected at 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 days of induction to detect the expression of osteogenic differentiation marker genes, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and ALP staining. Then, we investigated the effect of neurofibromin loss on C2C12 cells in terms of intracellular cAMP levels by ELISA. As shown in  Figure 2 A, the mRNA expression levels of ALP, Runx2, Osx and Col1a1 in the 2\u22127 group were significantly lower than those in the control group at different time points of osteogenic differentiation. The difference was statistically significant. As shown in  Figure 2 B, consistent with the 2\u22127 group, the mRNA expression levels of ALP, Runx2, Osx and Col1a1 in the 2\u221212 group were also significantly lower than those in the control group at different time points of osteogenic differentiation. The difference was statistically significant. As shown in  Figure 2 C, ALP staining in the control group became increasingly deeper with the prolongation of osteogenic differentiation time. However, the extent and scope of ALP staining in the two NF1 cell models were lighter and smaller than those in the control group at any time of osteogenic differentiation. The result was more pronounced in the 2\u22127 group. As shown in  Figure 2 D, both NF1 knockout cell lines 2\u22127 and 2\u221212 showed decreased ALP activity at different time points of osteogenic differentiation compared with the control cells. The trend was consistent with the expression of osteogenic differentiation marker genes and ALP staining in the two NF1 cell models. As shown in  Figure 2 E, after knocking out the NF1 gene, we observed the intracellular cAMP levels in 2\u22127 and 2\u221212 decreased, which was statistically significant compared with the control group. In conclusion, the above results showed that the osteogenic differentiation and the intracellular cAMP levels of the 2\u22127 and 2\u221212 strains with NF1 gene knockout were significantly lower than those of the normal control cells. 2.3. Icariin Improved the Osteogenic Differentiation of the NF1 Gene Knockout Cell Models at the Later Stage of the Osteogenic Induction Process A previous study showed that 10 \u22125  M icariin was the optimal concentration to promote the osteogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells [ 26 ]. Therefore, we used this concentration of icariin to induce osteogenic differentiation in the NF1 cell models of the subsequent experiments. The two NF1 cell lines with or without icariin treatment were collected at 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 days of osteogenic differentiation to detect the expression of osteogenic differentiation marker genes, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and ALP staining. As shown in  Figure 3 A, the viability of the cells gradually increased with the time of icariin addition, which was observed in both cell lines 2\u22127 and 2\u221212. The difference was statistically significant. This suggested that icariin has a proliferative effect on the NF1 knockout cells. As shown in  Figure 3 B, the ALP activity of the 2\u22127 and 2\u221212 groups treated with icariin was higher than those of the control group without icariin, especially at the later stage of the induction process, on the fifth and seventh days of osteogenic induction. As shown in  Figure 3 C, in the 2\u22127 group, the extent and scope of ALP staining with icariin were stronger than those without icariin treatment at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days of osteogenic differentiation. The observations in the 2\u221212 group were consistent with those in the 2\u22127 group. The extent and scope of ALP staining were also deeper and larger after the addition of icariin at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days of osteogenic differentiation. As shown in  Figure 3 D, the expression levels of osteogenic differentiation marker genes in the 2\u22127 group induced with icariin were higher than those without icariin treatment, especially at the later stage of the induction process, and the increase was the most significant at seven days of osteogenic differentiation. As shown in  Figure 3 E, consistent with the 2\u22127 group, the expression levels of osteogenic differentiation marker genes in the 2\u221212 group induced with icariin was higher than those without icariin treatment, and the increase was significant at both 5 and 7 days of osteogenic differentiation. The above results indicated that icariin could promote osteogenic differentiation in C2C12 cells with NF1 gene knockout. 2.4. RNA-Seq Analysis of Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) before and after Icariin Treatment during the Induction of Osteogenesis in the NF1 Cell Model Suggested cAMP Pathway Activation The differentially expressed genes were analyzed by comparing the gene expression profiles of the NF1 cell model before and after icariin treatment by transcriptome sequencing technology. The differentially expressed genes were labeled in the corresponding pathways, which can directly reflect the influence of gene expression differences in metabolic pathways and provide clues for further exploring the mechanism by which icariin promotes the osteogenic differentiation of the NF1 cell model. As shown in  Figure 4 A, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were clustered into two separate groups that coincided with the icariin-treated and untreated 2\u22127 group cells.  Figure 4 B shows that a total of 6404 DEGs, including 4732 upregulated and 1672 downregulated genes, were obtained from the comparison between icariin-treated and untreated 2\u22127 group cells. Next, we identified the ten most significantly upregulated and downregulated genes, and information about these genes is shown in  Table 1 . Information about genes is listed from top to bottom according to the significance of the differentially expressed genes. The results could help us better understand and verify the differentially expressed genes. The dot plot generated by the enrichment analysis using the KEGG database is shown in  Figure 4 C. KEGG analysis of DEGs in the icariin-treated 2\u22127 group cells compared with untreated cells suggested that the drug affected the cAMP signaling pathway. We next performed a KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the 6404 DEGs and determined that a subset of DEGs was specifically enriched in the cAMP signaling pathway. The cAMP metabolic pathway in this RNA-seq analysis is shown in  Figure 5  and intuitively reflects the impact of the gene expression differences in the cAMP metabolic pathway. From the cAMP signaling pathway, we found that PKA and CREB lie downstream of cAMP. We were interested in the cAMP signaling pathway because the intracellular cAMP level significantly decreased after NF1 gene knockout. 2.5. Icariin Activated the cAMP/PKA/CREB Pathway in the NF1 Cell Model Our previous bioinformatics analysis provided a clue to explore further the mechanism by which icariin promotes osteogenic differentiation in the NF1 cell model. The next step was to verify changes in the expression of downstream essential proteins and target genes. After adding icariin to the osteogenic differentiation medium, we examined the changes in intracellular cAMP levels of the 2\u22127 cell line and control C2C12 cell at six different time points: 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 120 min. As shown in  Figure 6 A, the concentration of cAMP began to increase after 15 min in both the 2\u22127 cell and control cell. The increase continued with the extension of dosing time and reached the highest level at 120 min. This trend was consistent within 2\u22127 and the control group. The results of the Western blot are shown in  Figure 6 B. PKA (p-PKA) and phosphorylation of CREB (p-CREB) were significantly activated after treatment with icariin in the 2\u22127 NF1 cell model. With the extension of icariin treatment, we found that the expression of p-PKA and p-CREB became more pronounced, while the expression of total PKA and total CREB remained unchanged. In addition, the Western blot results were confirmed by the immunofluorescence assay of p-PKA, as shown in  Figure 6 C. The expression of p-PKA in the icariin 2\u22127 cell group was significantly higher than that in control 2\u22127 cell group at 120 min after icariin administration, so a more obvious fluorescence signal could be observed, while there was no visible positive expression of p-PKA in the control group. The above results showed that the increase in intracellular cAMP levels and the expression of p-PKA and p-CREB continued with the extension of icariin dosing time and reached the highest level at 120 min. Therefore, we indicated that icariin activated the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway in the NF1 cell model. 2.6. A PKA Inhibitor (H89) Inhibited Icariin-Induced Osteogenesis by Blocking the cAMP/PKA/CREB Signaling Pathway in the NF1 Cell Model To further verify the role of cAMP signaling in the mechanism by which icariin enhances osteogenic differentiation in the NF1 cell model, we introduced a PKA inhibitor, H89, whose addition could block the activation of cAMP signaling. The 2\u22127 cell line was treated with osteogenic differentiation medium with or without icariin and H89 for seven days. We divided the cells into four groups: the control group, icariin group, H89 group and icariin+H89 group. As shown in  Figure 7 A, compared with those in the icariin group, the protein expression of p-PKA and p-CREB in the icariin+H89 group was weakened, indicating that H89 decreased the increase in p-PKA and p-CREB protein expression caused by icariin, while the expression of total PKA and total CREB did not change. Icariin-induced cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway activation was weakened by adding H89. Next, we examined the effect of H89 on the osteogenic differentiation of the NF1 cell model in terms of mRNA expression of osteogenic markers, ALP activity and ALP staining. As shown in  Figure 7 B, the mRNA expression levels of osteogenic differentiation marker genes in the icariin group were significantly higher than those in the control group. However, the mRNA expression level of the icariin+H89 group was significantly lower than those of the icariin group, while there was no statistically significant difference between the control group and the H89 group. The results indicated that H89 relieved the stimulatory effect of icariin on various osteogenic differentiation markers. Similarly, as shown in  Figure 7 C, ALP activity was significantly higher in the icariin group than in the control group. However, the increase in ALP activity in the icariin+H89 group was abolished. Consistent with the mRNA expression and ALP activity, the same trend of ALP staining is shown in  Figure 7 D. The extent and scope of ALP staining in the icariin group were deeper and larger than those in the icariin+H89 group. We found that the ability of icariin to enhance osteogenic differentiation in the NF1 cell model was impaired after H89 addition. In conclusion, the above results demonstrated that icariin enhanced the osteogenic differentiation of the NF1 cell model by activating the cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling pathway.",
  "discussion": "3. Discussion Icariin is widely used clinically as a bone-protective agent in treating fractures and osteoporosis [ 27 ]. Studies had shown that when human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and primary osteoblasts of mice were cultured in vitro for osteogenic induction, the addition of icariin can promote the differentiation of primary cells into osteoblasts and promote the expression of osteoblast marker genes [ 28 , 29 ]. Icariin can also inhibit the differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells into adipocytes and simultaneously increase the number of mature osteoblasts [ 30 ]. Recent studies have shown that icariin plays an essential role in promoting osteogenic differentiation of various types of osteoblasts, such as the human osteoblast line hFOB 1.19, the mouse osteoblast line MC3T3 and the mouse embryonic-derived mesenchymal stem cell line C3H10T1/2 [ 18 , 29 , 31 ]. In addition to osteogenic effects, several studies have shown that icariin inhibits the formation of various osteoclasts and prevents bone loss. Icariin suppressed osteoclastic differentiation and activity in a dose-dependent manner in the mouse osteoclast cell line RAW 264.7 [ 32 ]. Another study in postmenopausal women showed that icariin increased the bone anabolic marker and suppressed TRAF6 protein in peripheral blood osteoclast-precursor monocytes [ 33 ]. Zhang\u2019s group found that the higher the icariin concentration was, the greater the extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis and chondrogenic marker gene expression were [ 34 ]. Li et al. demonstrated that icariin can promote the synthesis of glycosaminoglycans and collagen in chondrocytes, which has a strong chondrogenic effect [ 35 ]. Studies have shown that icariin exhibits potent estrogenic bioactivity, antihyperglycemic effects, inhibition of glucocorticoids and stimulation of new bone formation, which can protect animal models of osteoporosis induced by ovariectomy, diabetes, glucocorticoids and OPG gene knockout [ 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 ]. In our research, by determining the expression of marker genes of osteogenic differentiation, such as ALP, Runx2, Osx and Col1a1, the activity and staining of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), we verified that icariin promotes osteoblast differentiation of the NF1 gene knockout cell model in vitro. We found that icariin increased the expression level of osteogenic markers and the activity or staining of ALP in a time-dependent manner. Therefore, icariin shows potential for the treatment of bone disorders in NF1. The results will provide new ideas for the clinical prevention and treatment of NF1 bone disease and drug development in the future. RNA-Seq analysis of DEGs in our research suggested cAMP pathway activation after icariin treatment in the NF1 cell model. This phenomenon might be related to the involvement of neurofibromin in regulating adenylate cyclase activity [ 40 ]. The et al. showed that NF1\u2212/\u2212 flies exhibited a 20 to 25% reduction in body size compared to normal flies. The fact that an exogenous increase in cAMP concentration rescued the abnormal phenotype suggested that neurofibromin can regulate the total growth of  Drosophila  through a separate RAS-independent cAMP pathway [ 41 ]. Our research found that the level of intracellular cAMP was significantly decreased in the cell models with NF1 gene knockout compared with the normal control cells, which might be the key to the induction of osteogenic disorders in NF1 cell models. Icariin was added during the induction of osteogenic differentiation, the level of intracellular cAMP was increased, the downstream pathway of cAMP was activated, and the osteogenic differentiation of the NF1 cell model was improved. Many studies have demonstrated that the cAMP/PKA signaling system, a key regulator of osteogenic lineage differentiation, regulates osteogenic differentiation and mineralization [ 42 ]. The role of the cAMP/PKA pathway in osteogenesis is supported by several studies. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is an anabolic drug approved by the United States FDA for the treatment of osteoporosis. Many studies have shown that PTH promotes osteogenic differentiation by activating the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway [ 43 , 44 ]. Aditi\u2019s group used MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts and UMR106 rat osteosarcoma cells to demonstrate that cAMP is a second messenger delivered through the Cx43 protein and overexpression of Cx43 can significantly enhance cAMP activity and thus enhance osteoblast function [ 45 ]. Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells pretreated with cAMP or forskolin (an adenylate cyclase activator) showed enhanced osteogenic differentiation in vivo by activating the cAMP/PKA pathway [ 42 , 46 ]. Pentoxifylline is a nonselective phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor that can promote osteoblast differentiation and increase bone formation by increasing cAMP levels in vitro and in vivo [ 47 ]. RNA-seq analysis in our research suggested that the DEGs not only markedly participated in cAMP signaling pathways but were also involved in Axon guidance and Rap1 signaling pathway. Enrichment of these highly related pathways may also be the mechanism of icariin in preventing and treating NF1 with skeletal defects. During the development of the nervous system, axons extend through complex environments. Ma et al. showed that mouse nerves with embryonic ectoderm development (EED) deficient Schwann cells display slow axonal regeneration with significantly decreased expression of axon guidance genes. RNA-seq analysis of EED-deficient mice identified polycomb repressive complex2-regulated molecular pathways that may contribute to the transition to malignancy in neurofibromatosis [ 48 ]. Rap1, like Ras, belongs to the GTPases of the Ras family. Both hypo- and hyperactivation of Ras/Rap signalling impair the capacity of synaptic plasticity. Moreover, accumulating reports have linked genetic defects that either increase or decrease Ras/Rap signaling with several mental disorders associated with learning disability, such as NF1 [ 49 ]. Stornetta et al. demonstrated that NF1 gene inactivation in astrocytes results in reduced cAMP generation and attenuated calcium influx and Rap1 activation. These results showed that neurofibromin positively influences cAMP generation and activation of cAMP growth regulatory targets in astrocytes and expands the role of the NF1 gene in astrocyte growth regulation [ 50 ]. The effect on cAMP is also consistent with our results in the NF1 osteoblast model. The RNA-seq and enrichment data could be deeply analyzed, showing the biological implications of the enriched pathways possibly affected by icariin. These issues are worth exploring in the future. In summary, we concluded that icariin could promote the osteogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells with NF1 gene knockout, and the stimulatory effect was mediated by the activation of the cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling pathway. The results of this study will provide new ideas and new targets for the prevention and treatment of NF1 bone disease and drug development from a new perspective, which has important theoretical significance and application value. However, this study also has some limitations. First, the specific connected sites and mechanisms between icariin and neurofibromin are still unclear. Next, it is necessary to construct an NF1 mouse model for further in vivo studies. For these goals, work in this direction is ongoing in our laboratory.",
