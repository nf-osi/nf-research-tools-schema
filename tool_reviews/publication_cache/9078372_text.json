  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Animal models of carcinogenesis have been produced in transgenic mice by directing the expression of oncogenes such as SV40 T antigen and myc to different tissues by creating fusions with promoter/enhancer elements of various mammalian or viral genes. RESULTS: A transgenic mouse line was created in which SV40 T antigen is under the control of the mouse nerve growth factor (NGF) promoter. While the oncogene is expressed in a wide range of NGF producing tissues, it specifically causes the development of either neurofibromas or neurofibrosarcomas similar to those found in the human disease neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). These tumours are completely penetrant and appear after a mean latency of about 8 months. In contrast to the previously reported neurofibromatosis mouse model HTLV-1 tax, the tumours in these transgenic mice arise in Schwann cells rather than perineural fibroblasts and have a very restricted tissue distribution. In a cell line cloned from a neurofibroma from these mice, NGF was detected in the culture medium at levels similar to those produced by cultured primary Schwann cells. CONCLUSION: As all animal model for a heritable neurocristopathy resembling NF1, this mouse should allow study of the pathology and treatment of this disease.",
