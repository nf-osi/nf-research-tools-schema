  "abstract": "ALTERED CALCIUM CURRENTS AND AXONAL GROWTH IN Nf1 HAPLOINSUFFICIENT MICE.  Wang Y(1), Brittain JM, Wilson SM, Hingtgen CM, Khanna R.  Author information: (1)Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Indiana University School of  Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.  Mutations of the neurofibromin gene (NF1) cause neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1),  a disease in which learning disabilities are common. Learning deficits also are  observed in mice with a heterozygous mutation of Nf1 (Nf1(+/-)). Dysregulation  of regulated neurotransmitter release has been observed in Nf1(+/-) mice.  However, the role of presynaptic voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels mediating this  release has not been investigated. We investigated whether Ca(2+) currents and  transmitter release were affected by reduced neurofibromin in Nf1(+/-) mice.  Hippocampal Ca(2+) current density was greater in neurons from Nf1(+/-) mice and  a greater fraction of Ca(2+) currents was activated at less depolarized  potentials. In addition, release of the excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate,  was increased in neuronal cortical cultures from Nf1(+/-) mice. Dendritic  complexity and axonal length were also increased in neurons Nf1(+/-) mice  compared to wild-type neurons, linking loss of neurofibromin to developmental  changes in hippocampal axonal/cytoskeletal dynamics. Collectively, these results  show that altered Ca(2+) channel density and transmitter release, along with  increased axonal growth may account for the abnormal nervous system functioning  in NF1.
