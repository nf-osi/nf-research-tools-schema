Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor gene product, neurofibromin,  functions in part as a Ras-GAP, and though its loss is implicated in the  neuronal abnormality of NF1 patients, its precise cellular function remains  unclear. To study the molecular mechanism of NF1 pathogenesis, we prepared NF1  gene knockdown (KD) PC12 cells, as a NF1 disease model, and analyzed their  molecular (gene and protein) expression profiles with a unique integrated  proteomics approach, comprising iTRAQ, 2D-DIGE, and DNA microarrays, using an  integrated protein and gene expression analysis chart (iPEACH). In NF1-KD PC12  cells showing abnormal neuronal differentiation after NGF treatment, of 3198  molecules quantitatively identified and listed in iPEACH, 97 molecules  continuously up- or down-regulated over time were extracted. Pathway and network  analysis further revealed overrepresentation of calcium signaling and  transcriptional regulation by glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the up-regulated  protein set, whereas nerve system development was overrepresented in the  down-regulated protein set. The novel up-regulated network we discovered,  \"dynein IC2-GR-COX-1 signaling,\" was then examined in NF1-KD cells. Validation  studies confirmed that NF1 knockdown induces altered splicing and  phosphorylation patterns of dynein IC2 isomers, up-regulation and accumulation  of nuclear GR, and increased COX-1 expression in NGF-treated cells. Moreover,  the neurite retraction phenotype observed in NF1-KD cells was significantly  recovered by knockdown of the dynein IC2-C isoform and COX-1. In addition,  dynein IC2 siRNA significantly inhibited nuclear translocation and accumulation  of GR and up-regulation of COX-1 expression. These results suggest that dynein  IC2 up-regulates GR nuclear translocation and accumulation, and subsequently  causes increased COX-1 expression, in this NF1 disease model. Our integrated  proteomics strategy, which combines multiple approaches, demonstrates that  NF1-related neural abnormalities are, in part, caused by up-regulation of dynein  IC2-GR-COX-1 signaling, which may be a novel therapeutic target for NF1.
