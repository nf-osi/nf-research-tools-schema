  "title": "L-carnitine supplementation for muscle weakness and fatigue in children with neurofibromatosis type 1: A Phase 2a clinical trial.",
  "abstract": "Reduced muscle tone, muscle weakness, and physical fatigue can impact considerably on quality of life for children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Human muscle biopsies and mouse models of NF1 deficiency in muscle show intramyocellular lipid accumulation, and preclinical data have indicated that L-carnitine supplementation can ameliorate this phenotype. The aim of this study is to examine whether daily L-carnitine supplementation is safe and feasible, and will improve muscle strength and reduce fatigue in children with NF1. A 12-week Phase 2a trial was conducted using 1000\u2009mg daily oral levocarnitine tartrate supplementation. Recruited children were between 8 and 12\u2009years old with a clinical diagnosis of NF1, history of muscle weakness and fatigue, and na\u00efve to L-carnitine. Primary outcomes were safety (self-reporting, biochemical testing) and compliance. Secondary outcomes included plasma acylcarnitine profiles, functional measures (muscle strength, long jump, handwriting speed, 6-minute-walk test [6MWT]), and parent-reported questionnaires (PedsQL\u2122, CBCL/6-18). Six children completed the trial with no self-reported adverse events. Biochemical tests for kidney and liver function were normal, and the average compliance was 95%. Plasma acylcarnitine levels were low, but within a range not clinically linked to carnitine deficiency. For strength measures, there was a mean 53% increase in dorsiflexion strength (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.89-60.75; p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) and mean 66% increase in plantarflexion strength (95% CI 12.99-134.1; p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). In terms of muscle performance, there was a mean 10% increase in long jump distance (95% CI 2.97-16.03; p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and 6MWT distance (95% CI 5.88-75.45; p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Comparison with the 1000 Norms Project data showed a significant improvement in Z-score for all of these measures. Parent reports showed no negative impact on quality of life, and the perceived benefits led to the majority of individuals remaining on L-carnitine after the study. Twelve weeks of L-carnitine supplementation is safe and feasible in children with NF1, and a Phase 3 trial should confirm the efficacy of treatment.",

  "methods": "2 SUBJECTS AND METHODS 2.1 Study design and participants This open\u2010label, single\u2010arm, single center, Phase 2a clinical trial was designed to assess the safety and compliance of L\u2010carnitine supplementation in children with NF1. The trial was registered on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry with ACTRN number 12618002021257 (Study protocol:  https://anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?ACTRN=12618002021257 ). The study was approved and monitored by the Sydney Children's Hospital Network Human Research Ethics Committee (reference no. HREC/18/SCHN/288). Participants were children between 8 and 12\u2009years of age that fulfilled: (1) the National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference diagnostic criteria for NF1, (2) reported a history of muscle weakness and/or physical fatigue, and (3) were na\u00efve to L\u2010carnitine supplementation. The clinic provides NF1 specialist services to children in the Greater Sydney Metropolitan Region. Prior to the initial assessment, a medical history of all participants was obtained from the parent(s), and the participant's medical file. Participants were excluded from the study if they met any of the following criteria: (1) severe cognitive impairment, (2) insufficient English, (3) seizures, (4) skeletal abnormalities, e.g. tibial bowing and pseudarthrosis, acute foot or lower limb injuries, e.g. fracture and ankle sprain, or (5) incapacity to comply with a research protocol, e.g. prolonged absence. Written informed consent was obtained from all parents and assent from children as developmentally appropriate. 2.2 Procedures All participants were allocated a daily dose of 1000\u2009mg Levocarnitine tartrate (Musashi, Vitaco Health Australia Pty Ltd). Hard capsules (500\u2009mg) were consumed twice daily for 12\u2009weeks. The families were instructed to provide the children with the capsules at breakfast and dinner time, roughly 10\u00a0h apart. L\u2010carnitine is an over\u2010the\u2010counter nutraceutical supplement taken to improve fatty acid oxidation and energy production. L\u2010carnitine supplementation is used to treat primary carnitine deficiency. However, as L\u2010carnitine supplementation had never been previously clinically trialed in NF1, we started the first three participants 1 month apart. As there were no adverse events in these children, the remaining three participants were started on L\u2010carnitine supplementation at fortnightly intervals. L\u2010carnitine was dispensed from the Pharmacy Department of The Children's Hospital at Westmead. Functional assessments and questionnaires were carried out at the Kids Research Clinical Research Centre, The Children's Hospital at Westmead. A trained clinical evaluator took all functional assessments in the same order at baseline (0\u2009weeks) and end of study (12\u2009weeks). Questionnaires were completed by the parents at baseline and 12\u2010weeks posttreatment. Blood was collected and analyzed by the Pathology Department of The Children's Hospital at Westmead. Blood samples were collected at baseline and 12\u2010weeks posttreatment, and urine was collected at 12\u2009weeks. Participants were given the option to continue L\u2010carnitine supplementation at their own cost after the study endpoint (12\u2009weeks), and were followed up after 3\u00a0months. The participants were asked whether they chose to continue L\u2010carnitine treatment, and what their regimen was. They were also asked to complete the same set of questionnaires after this period. 2.3 Outcome measures The primary outcome measures for this study were safety and compliance. Safety was primarily analyzed by adverse event self\u2010reporting. A weekly phone call was made to each participant's family to ensure any safety concerns or adverse events were expressed. Additionally, there were three in\u2010person consultations for each participant, which were scheduled prior to each functional assessment. Biochemical safety assessments included plasma liver function ( Supporting Table\u00a01 ), urine chemistry ( Supporting Table 2 ), circulating triglycerides and cholesterols, and acylcarnitine profiling ( Supporting Table 3 ). At the final consultation, participants returned any remaining capsules. The numbers of remaining capsules were counted to assess their compliance. The intervention was declared safe and feasible if: (1) no more than one of the six participants withdrew due to experiencing an adverse event attributable to treatment, and (2) at least four of the six participants were able to complete at least 75% of the prescribed dose of treatment and comply with study requirements. Secondary outcomes were functional assessments, including body fat, measures of muscle strength (grip, dorsiflexion and plantarflexion), gait, power (long jump), fine motor function (hand writing speed test), gross motor function (6\u00a0minute\u2010walk\u2010test [6MWT]) and quality of life (Pediatric Quality of Life and Child Behavior Checklist for ages 6\u201318). Body fat was measured using the MC\u2010780MA Tanita Tokyo body composition analyzer. The MC\u2010780MA body composition analyzer divides the human body into five sections; left leg, right leg, trunk, left arm, and right arm, measuring impedance by a tetrapolar 8\u2010point tactile electrode at 50\u2009kHz. Maximal isometric strength of three muscle groups involved in prime movements, including grip strength, ankle dorsiflexion, and plantarflexion were tested using hand\u2010held dynamometry by a trained clinical evaluator (Citec; CIT Tehcnics, Harren, the Netherlands). To meet the independence requirements for statistical analysis, the measurements from only the dominant limb were included for each participant, and this was kept consistent for every study visit (Menz,\u00a0 2004 ). Three repetitions were performed per muscle group, and an average measurement of strength was determined from this. Gait was assessed by heel and toe walking, which was scored on a 3\u2010point scale of difficulty: \u201cno,\u201d \u201csome,\u201d and \u201cyes\u201d to further examine dorsiflexion and plantarflexion strength. Power was measured by a standing long jump on a padded mat. Fine motor endurance was evaluated by the Handwriting Speed Test (Wallen et al.,  1996 ) that gives a raw score in letters per minute, and gross motor endurance by the 6MWT, which was completed barefoot on a point\u2010to\u2010point, 25\u2010m long, flat, straight, hard surfaced track. Quality of life was assessed by parent reported questionnaires, including the Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL\u2122) Generic 4.0 and Neuromuscular (3.0) modules, and The Child Behavior Checklist for ages 6\u201318 or CBCL/6\u201018 (\u00a9ASEBA 2020). The PedsQL\u2122 Generic 4.0 module consists of physical, psychosocial, and total summary scores, and the PedsQL\u2122 Neuromuscular 3.0 module consists of neuromuscular disease, communication, family resources, and neuromuscular total summary scores. Both are scored on a scale ranging from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating worse health. The CBCL/6\u201018 (\u00a9ASEBA 2020) consists of 113 questions, scored on a 3\u2010point Likert scale (0\u00a0=\u2009absent, 1\u00a0=\u2009occurs sometimes, 2\u00a0=\u2009occurs often) that tests for empirically based syndrome scales. To fall within the clinical range of a syndrome scale means that the parent\u2010reported results from that questionnaire indicate their child clinically manifest the syndrome. 2.4 Statistical analysis We analyzed the treatment effect by calculating average % change from baseline compared to 12\u2010weeks posttreatment for all outcome measures for each participant ( n \u00a0=\u00a06), and confidence intervals for improvement were also calculated. Spearman's rank\u2010order correlation efficiency was applied to determine a weight specific dosage effect. Participant functional assessments from baseline and 12\u2010weeks posttreatment were compared to reference data to generate Z\u2010score changes (negative Z\u2010score is indicative of motor impairment based on age and sex\u2010matched normative data). Hand\u2010dynamometry strength measures, long jump, and 6MWT were compared to reference data obtained from the 1000 Norms Project, an observational study investigating outcome measures of self\u2010reported health and physical function in 1000 healthy individuals aged 3 to 101\u2009years (McKay et al.,\u00a0 2016 ). Handwriting speed was compared to normative data adapted from Cermak ( 1989 ) and Wechsler ( 1974 ). Height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) Z\u2010scores were generated using USCDC2000 reference data. 2.5 Role of the funding source This study was funded by the Children's Tumor Foundation (US). The funding source had no involvement in the following: study design, collection, analysis, and interpretation of data, in the writing of the report, and in the decision to submit the paper for publication.",

  "introduction": "1 INTRODUCTION Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the most common autosomal dominant genetic disorder, with a birth incidence of 1:3000 globally (Friedman,\u00a0 2002 ). NF1 is caused by inactivating mutations in the  NF1  gene located on chromosome 17q11.2 (Shen et al.,\u00a0 1996 ). The  NF1  gene encodes neurofibromin, a RAS\u2010specific GTPase activating protein that modulates the biological activity of RAS proteins (Shen et al.,\u00a0 1996 ), and thus  NF1  is classified as a tumor suppressor gene. While tumors are often the focus of clinical management at all stages of life, children with NF1 can be challenged by reductions in lean tissue mass, global muscle weakness, and problems in fine and gross motor functioning (Cornett et al.,\u00a0 2015 ; Dulai et al.,\u00a0 2007 ; Summers et al.,\u00a0 2015 ). They also express higher levels of physical and cognitive fatigue (Vassallo et al.,\u00a0 2020 ). In a study of self\u2010concept, approximately 30% of children and adolescents with NF1 reported a low self\u2010concept for physical and sporting abilities (Barton & North,\u00a0 2007 ). There are currently no effective interventions for managing the physical limitations associated with NF1. Summers et al.\u00a0( 2018 ) showed that double inactivation of  Nf1  in murine muscle leads to intramyocellular lipid accumulation, which was also observed in NF1 patient muscle biopsies Summers et al.,\u00a0 2018 ). This phenotype was reminiscent of metabolic myopathies, a series of conditions that are often managed by L\u2010carnitine supplementation and/or dietary enrichment with medium\u2010chain fatty acids. Treatment of the  Nf1 \n \n \n Prx1 \n \u2212/\u2212  mouse with this intervention led to a decrease in the accumulation of long\u2010chain fats in the muscle, leading to a 45% increase in grip strength following a 12\u2010week treatment. L\u2010carnitine is a vital molecular component of several energy producing pathways (Bremer,\u00a0 1983 ). Greater than 95% of the body's total carnitine is localized in skeletal muscle, where it is necessary for the transport of long\u2010chain fatty acids through the mitochondrial membrane for beta\u2010oxidation (Stephens et al.,\u00a0 2007 ). Normally, the body's requirements for carnitine are met by the consumption of meat, but endogenous synthesis and increased renal absorption efficiency can contribute to whole\u2010body carnitine homeostasis. Impairments in L\u2010carnitine synthesis, transport or metabolism can result in primary or secondary deficiencies, which can in turn lead to elevated levels of intramyocellular lipid in muscle biopsies (Vasiljevski et al.,\u00a0 2018 ). Carnitine deficiency often results in muscle weakness and increased physical fatigue. L\u2010carnitine supplementation is frequently recommended to patients with carnitine deficiency syndromes. Primary carnitine deficiency responds dramatically to oral carnitine therapy, with a complete reversal of clinical symptoms within a month (Al\u2010sharefi & Bilous,\u00a0 2015 ; Tomlinson et al.,\u00a0 2018 ). Patients with other disorders that feature a secondary carnitine deficiency, such as kidney disease and dialysis patients, and very long chain acyl\u2010CoA dehydrogenase deficiency can also receive benefits from carnitine replacement therapy (Ahmad,\u00a0 2001 ; Touma et al.,\u00a0 2001 ). L\u2010carnitine supplementation has never been examined as a clinical treatment for muscle weakness or physical fatigue in the context of NF1. Hence, this study represents the first proof\u2010of\u2010concept trial to examine compliance, safety, and efficacy of levocarnitine tartrate treatment in children with NF1\u2010associated muscle weakness and fatigue. While prior studies have tested L\u2010carnitine for pediatric and adult conditions, deficiencies in fatty acid metabolism in NF1 muscle identified by preclinical studies justify safety testing in this specific patient group. To explore evidence for a secondary carnitine deficiency or other metabolic deficit, patients were assessed in terms of their plasma acylcarnitine profile. Our hypotheses were that: (1) daily 1000\u2009mg levocarnitine tartrate supplementation (two divided doses) in children with NF1\u2010associated muscle weakness and fatigue would be safe, feasible, and acceptable to families; (2) changes in strength and endurance measures may be detectable; and (3) plasma acylcarnitine profiling may show evidence of a secondary carnitine deficiency.",
  "results": "3 RESULTS Between June and August 2019, a total of six participants were recruited at the Neurogenetics/Neuromuscular clinic located in The Children's Hospital at Westmead. All participants fulfilled clinical diagnostic criteria for NF1, a medical history of muscle weakness and physical fatigue and were na\u00efve to L\u2010carnitine supplementation. Demographics and clinical characteristics for the six participants are summarized in Table\u00a0 1 . Four (67.7%) were male and two (33.3%) were female. The mean age was 10.7\u2009years ( SD  1.2), and BMI Z\u2010score was \u22120.32. All participants were assigned the predetermined daily dose of 1000\u2009mg levocarnitine tartrate ( n \u00a0=\u00a06). The mean calculated daily weight\u2010specific dose was 31.6\u00a0mg/kg/day ( SD  10.5), based on weight measurements collected at baseline. All participants completed the predetermined treatment duration of 12\u2009weeks. All bottles of L\u2010carnitine supplements were returned at the completion of the study.

Kidney and liver function were normal, and there were no clinically significant changes in circulating fats following 12\u2009weeks of L\u2010carnitine supplementation. There were no withdrawals, and all participants completed \u226584% of the treatment course (calculated as a percentage; number of capsules taken/168*100), with a mean compliance of 95\u2009\u00b1\u20096.2%. Therefore, 1000\u2009mg/daily levocarnitine tartrate treatment was deemed safe and feasible. Acylcarnitine profiling revealed no abnormalities in plasma acylcarnitine levels (Table\u00a0 2 ). Mean baseline levels of acylcarnitines included total carnitine 39.3 (Ref: 5\u2013106,  SD  9.2), free carnitine 31.8 (Ref: 3\u201360,  SD  9.6), acetyl\u2010carnitine 6 (Ref: 2\u201339,  SD  1.5), propionylcarnitine 0.4 (Ref: 0.12\u20130.97,  SD  0.2), and isovalerylcarnitine 0.1 (Ref: 0.00\u20130.22,  SD  0.1). Following 12\u2009weeks of L\u2010carnitine supplementation, levels of acylcarnitines were total carnitine 54.5 (Ref: 5\u2013106,  SD  6.8), free carnitine 44.5 (Ref: 3\u201360,  SD  5.6), acetyl\u2010carnitine 8.3 (Ref: 2\u201339,  SD  1.8), propionylcarnitine 0.7 (Ref: 0.12\u20130.97,  SD  0.3), and isovalerylcarnitine 0.2 (Ref: 0.00\u20130.22,  SD  0.1).

There was a mean reduction in fat mass by 0.8% ( SD  4.5,  p \u00a0=\u00a00.76), and mean reduction in fat amount by 2.8% ( SD  4.4,  p \u00a0=\u00a00.21), neither statistically significant (Figure\u00a0 1a ). The average BMI Z\u2010score decreased from \u22120.32 at baseline to \u22120.41 at 12\u2010weeks posttreatment.

Each symbol denotes participants 1\u20136 Following 12\u2009weeks of L\u2010carnitine supplementation, there was no significant improvement in grip strength (95% CI \u22122.49 to 10.15;  p \u00a0=\u00a00.18); however, there was a mean 53% increase in dorsiflexion strength (95% CI 8.89\u201360.75;  p \u00a0=\u00a00.02) and a mean 66% increase in plantarflexion strength (95% CI 12.99\u2013134.1;  p \u00a0=\u00a00.03) (Figure\u00a0 1b ). Standing long jump distance was significantly greater on average by 10% after the 12\u2010week treatment course (95% CI 2.97\u201316.03;  p \u00a0=\u00a00.01) (Figure\u00a0 1c ). A mean 10% improvement was also observed for the 6MWT after 12\u2010weeks of L\u2010carnitine supplementation (95% CI 5.88\u201375.45;  p \u00a0=\u00a00.03). To note, the 6MWT of participant two was excluded due to cramping during testing time. Furthermore, handwriting speed was increased by 15% on average; however, due to the considerable variability in participant performance, this failed to reach statistical significance (95% CI \u22127.38 to 20.24;  p \u00a0=\u00a00.28) (Figure\u00a0 1c ). Functional outcome measures collected throughout the study were compared to age and sex matched normative data. NF1 participants performed below average on every outcome measure at baseline, with the exception of participant six who generated a positive Z\u2010score for dorsiflexion strength and handwriting speed, and participants three and four who also had a positive Z\u2010score for handwriting speed (Figure\u00a0 2 ). After 12\u2009weeks of L\u2010carnitine supplementation, there was an average Z\u2010score improvement of dorsiflexion strength from \u22121.57 to \u22120.32 (95% CI 0.17\u20132.33;  p \u00a0=\u00a00.03) and plantarflexion strength from \u22121.98 to \u22120.15 (95% CI 0.08\u20133.59;  p \u00a0=\u00a00.04).

Due to varied parent perception when scoring their child, there was large variability in the starting scores resulting in statistical significance being unattainable for this outcome measure. Other domains, including psychosocial health summary, neuromuscular disease summary, communication summary, and family resources summary scores showed no significant differences suggesting that L\u2010carnitine supplementation does not interfere with participant's quality of life.

Majority of the children (4/6) fell within the clinical range of >2 syndrome scales at baseline. This was reduced to 2/6 children following 12\u2010weeks posttreatment ( Supporting Table 6 ). However, no statistically significant differences could be detected due to sample size and interparticipant variability (Figure\u00a0 4 ). FIGURE 4 CBCL/6\u201018 syndrome scale scores.

Three families continued supplementation with L\u2010carnitine. One family ceased treatment, however recommenced after fatigue symptoms returned. Two families did not continue treatment, with both families recognizing that NF1 cognitive and social behaviors were confounding their view of L\u2010carnitine supplementation for their child's muscle weakness and fatigue, and one family awaiting the published trial results to reconsider L\u2010carnitine.",
  "discussion": "4 DISCUSSION The primary goal of this Phase 2a, proof\u2010of\u2010concept clinical trial was to establish the safety and feasibility of L\u2010carnitine as a therapeutic intervention for NF1 muscle weakness and physical fatigue. Critically, there were no side effects of L\u2010carnitine supplementation or adverse events reported and no abnormalities seen in liver and kidney function tests. These data are consistent with L\u2010carnitine being well tolerated in both children and adolescents, as it is part of a normal diet (albeit in lower amounts). The safety of L\u2010carnitine supplementation has previously been demonstrated in a number of different pediatric cohorts, including primary carnitine deficiency, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and Rett syndrome (Ellaway et al.,\u00a0 1999 ; Geier et al.,\u00a0 2011 ; Kilic et al.,\u00a0 2012 ). However, this represents its first trial in a pediatric NF1 population. The high compliance rate of 95%, with no withdrawals suggesting that daily L\u2010carnitine supplementation is a well\u2010received therapeutic approach to treat muscle weakness and fatigue in NF1 children. A daily dose of 1000\u2009mg was predetermined for all participants. Future studies could better control for weight\u2010specific dose, which varied from 17.7 to 46.5\u00a0mg/kg/day in our cohort. Correlation analysis revealed no association between dose and functional outcomes, although this analysis had limited power. In prior pediatric studies, a 50\u2009mg/kg/day dose of L\u2010carnitine supplementation is commonly practiced with high safety and proven efficacy and this likely represents a suitable starting dose for those na\u00efve to the therapy. Anecdotal reports and clinical studies suggest that dose escalation could merely increase the incidence and severity of side effects, such as nausea and vomiting (Geier et al.,\u00a0 2011 ; Goin\u2010Kochel et al.,\u00a0 2019 ). There were clinical concerns that kidney or liver function had the potential to be particularly affected in NF1 children as these organs are sensitive to metabolic changes; however, no evidence for this was seen. The use of L\u2010carnitine in NF1 children with muscle weakness who suffer from seizures remains a question for future study. Such individuals were excluded from recruitment due to contraindications with L\u2010carnitine, although these risks are poorly substantiated. A review of encephalopathy patients on valproic acid found no data suggesting that seizures were worsened by L\u2010carnitine supplementation (Zeiler et al.,\u00a0 2016 ). Therefore, future studies may include removing this as an exclusion criterion. It has been suggested that NF1 could benefit from being described as a lipid\u2010storage metabolic myopathy (11). This concept is supported by the potential efficacy of L\u2010carnitine seen in this trial. The efficacy of L\u2010carnitine supplementation has already been demonstrated in some secondary mitochondrial disorders (Ellaway et al.,\u00a0 1999 ; Malaguarnera & Cauli,\u00a0 2019 ; Zhang et al.,\u00a0 2010 ). This category of conditions includes spinal muscular atrophy (Harpey et al.,\u00a0 1990 ), Parkinson's disease (Park et al.,\u00a0 2018 ), Rett syndrome (Shulyakova et al.,\u00a0 2017 ), and ASD (Siddiqui et al.,\u00a0 2016 ). Further mechanistic studies and mitochondrial function analysis may reveal that NF1 has features of a secondary mitochondrial disorder, although it will be important to rule out a primary mitochondrial disease) in cases of NF1 by gene panel testing of oxidative phosphorylation\u2010related genes. It was speculated that individuals enrolled in the study may show clinical deficiency in carnitine that could explain their muscle weakness and/or fatigue. While plasma acylcarnitine profiling revealed no clinical deficiency, many individuals were toward the lower end of the normal range. Comparison to a control cohort would be necessary to assess a secondary carnitine deficiency in NF1 children. More importantly, plasma carnitine concentrations do not always reflect the carnitine concentration observed in skeletal muscle. For example, hemodialysis patients frequently exhibit normal plasma carnitine, but have a low muscle carnitine concentration (Moorthy et al.,\u00a0 1983 ; Savica et al.,\u00a0 1983 ). However, muscle biopsies are highly invasive and would represent a major barrier to trial recruitment. Our study has several limitations. Children with NF1 and muscle weakness and fatigue are a poorly defined subcohort yet represent the precise group that would be most engaged with finding a muscle\u2010targeted therapy. Thus, while this trial design did not use a randomized or placebo\u2010controlled design, it captures a stratification of the NF1 community most likely to adopt routine L\u2010carnitine supplementation. Moreover, this limitation was balanced by comparing individual cases before and after therapy, and to a normative group from the 1000 Norms Project data set. As previously noted, the lack of an L\u2010carnitine dose normalized to weight is another limitation, but one that was necessary within the practicalities of commercially available carnitine preparations. Indeed, this has proved advantageous to families looking to sustain their supplement use after the study endpoint. Finally, from the initial conception this study aimed to examine safety and compliance within a small cohort and was not designed to completely accommodate the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of children with NF1 and was not powered toward functional outcomes. Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish whether function improvement is an effect of the treatment, a placebo effect or the effect of a natural history. Further, sex\u2010specific effects/caveats of L\u2010carnitine supplementation may be a consideration. Hence, it was always anticipated that this would represent a precursor to a larger multicenter trial. In summary, our data demonstrate that 1000\u2009mg daily levocarnitine tartrate is safe and feasible in children with NF1\u2010associated muscle weakness and fatigue. Efficacy data suggest possible improvements in muscle strength and energy levels. However, we propose that a multisite, randomized, double\u2010blind placebo\u2010controlled trial with a consistent dosage regimen of 50\u2009mg/kg/day would be the optimal approach to firmly establish the efficacy of L\u2010carnitine supplementation. A greater childhood age range, which could be compared to age\u2010, sex\u2010, height\u2010, and weight\u2010matched controls, would also improve future study data.",
