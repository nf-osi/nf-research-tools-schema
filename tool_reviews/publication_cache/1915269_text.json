  "abstract": "The GTPase stimulatory activities of the neurofibromatosis type 1 and the yeast  IRA2 proteins are inhibited by arachidonic acid.  Golubić M(1), Tanaka K, Dobrowolski S, Wood D, Tsai MH, Marshall M, Tamanoi F,  Stacey DW.  Author information: (1)Department of Molecular Biology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, OH 44195-5285.  Three proteins, GTPase activating protein (GAP), neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) and  the yeast inhibitory regulator of the RAS-cAMP pathway (IRA2), have the ability  to stimulate the GTPase activity of Ras proteins from higher animals or yeast.  Previous studies indicate that certain lipids are able to inhibit this activity  associated with the mammalian GAP protein. Inhibition of GAP would be expected  to biologically activate Ras protein. In these studies arachidonic acid is shown  also to inhibit the activity of the catalytic fragments of the other two  proteins, mammalian NF1 and the yeast IRA2 proteins. In addition, phosphatidic  acid (containing arachidonic and stearic acid) was inhibitory for the catalytic  fragment of NF1 protein, but did not inhibit the catalytic fragments of GAP or  IRA2 proteins. These observations emphasize the biochemical similarity of these  proteins and provide support for the suggestion that lipids might play an  important role in their biological control, and therefore also in the control of  Ras activity and cellular proliferation.
