HKII expression was stably interfered by infecting cells with a lentivirus carrying the following shRNAs (Sigma) against mouse HKII mRNA: \n \n CCGGCATCACCCTGCTGGTTCTAAACTCGAGTTTAGAACCAGCAGGGTGATGTTTTTG; CCGGCGGTACAGAGAAAGGAGACTTCTCGAGAAGTCTCCTTTCTCTGTACCGTTTTTG. Scrambled shRNA (Sigma) was used as negative control. Transduced cells were selected in 1.0\u00a0\u03bcg/ml puromycin. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses Histological and immunohistochemical analyses were performed both on primary human samples (colorectal carcinoma,  n \u00a0=\u00a06; breast carcinoma,  n \u00a0=\u00a06; MPNST,  n \u00a0=\u00a06; lymph nodes deriving from B\u2010cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients,  n \u00a0=\u00a06) and on samples derived from mouse tumor models (PN tumors; CT26 and 4T1 subcutaneous grafts in Balb/c mice). In detail, 4\u2010\u03bcm\u2010thick tissue sections were obtained from formalin\u2010fixed paraffin\u2010embedded tissue samples and representative tumor areas were selected on H&E\u2010stained slides for immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. IHC was performed using primary goat polyclonal anti\u2010HK2 (sc\u20106521, Santa Cruz) and rabbit monoclonal anti\u2010MPP2 (ab92536, Abcam) antibodies. Antigen retrieval was performed with heat/EDTA in the Bond\u2010Max automated immunostainer (Leica Biosystems), as previously described  40 . Cell lysates and Western immunoblot analysis Cells lysis (5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 5  for each assay) was performed in Tris 20\u00a0mM, NaCl 150\u00a0mM, EDTA 2\u00a0mM, EGTA 2\u00a0mM, and Triton X\u2010100 0.5% supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors (Sigma). Protein quantification was performed with BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific\u2010Pierce). After SDS/PAGE gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose Hybond\u2010C Extra membranes (Amersham, Uppsala; Sweden) and immunostained with goat polyclonal anti\u2010HK2 (clone sc\u20106521, Santa Cruz), anti\u2010GAPDH (#2118, Cell Signaling), ATP5A (ab14748, Abcam), anti\u2010UQCRC2 (ab14745, Abcam), rabbit monoclonal anti\u2010MMP2 (ab92536, Abcam), rabbit monoclonal anti\u2010MMP9 (ab137867, Abcam) rabbit polyclonal, and TOM20 (sc\u201011415, Santa Cruz) antibodies. Peptide synthesis HK2pep, SCRpep, cl\u2010HK2pep, and cl\u2010SCRpep were synthesized by automatic solid\u2010phase procedures using a multiple peptide synthesizer (SyroII, MultiSynTech GmbH) on a pre\u2010loaded Wang resin (100\u2013200 mesh) (Novabiochem). The fluoren\u20109\u2010ylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) strategy was used throughout the peptide chain assembly, utilizing O\u2010(7\u2010azabenzotriazol\u20101\u2010yl)\u2010 N , N , N \u2032, N \u2032\u2010tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU) as coupling reagent. The side\u2010chain protected amino acid building blocks used were as follows: Fmoc\u2010Tyr(tert\u2010butyl), Fmoc\u2010Glu(tert\u2010butyl), Fmoc\u2010Ser(tertbutyl), Fmoc\u2010Thr(tert\u2010butyl), Fmoc\u2010His(trityl), Fmoc\u2010Asn(trityl), and Fmoc\u2010 Arg(2,2,4,6,7\u2010pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran\u20105\u2010sulfonyl). Cleavage of the peptides was performed by reacting the peptidyl\u2010resins with a mixture containing TFA/H20/thioanisole/ethanedithiol/phenol (10\u00a0ml/0.5\u00a0ml/0.5\u00a0ml/0.25\u00a0ml/750\u00a0mg) for 2.5\u00a0h. Crude peptides were purified by a preparative reverse\u2010phase HPLC. Molecular masses of the peptide were confirmed by mass spectroscopy on a MALDI TOF\u2010TOF using a Applied Biosystems 4800 mass spectrometer. The purity of the peptides was about 95% as evaluated by analytical reverse\u2010phase HPLC.

The fluoren\u20109\u2010ylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) strategy was used throughout the peptide chain assembly. Activation of entering Fmoc\u2010protected amino acids (0.3\u00a0M solution in DMF) was performed using 0.5\u00a0M Oxyma in DMF/0.5\u00a0M DIC in DMF (1:1:1 molar ratio), with a 5 equivalent excess over the initial resin loading. Coupling steps were performed for 7\u00a0min at 75\u00b0C. Fmoc\u2010deprotection steps were performed by treatment with a 20% piperidine solution in DMF at room temperature (1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0min). Following each coupling or deprotection step, peptidyl\u2010resin was washed with DMF (4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03.5\u00a0ml). Upon complete chain assembly, resin was washed with DCM (5\u00d7 3.5\u00a0ml) and gently dried under a nitrogen flow. Resin\u2010bound peptide was treated with an ice\u2010cold TFA, TIS, water, and thioanisole mixture (90:5:2.5:2.5 v/v/v/v, 4\u00a0ml) for 2\u00a0h. Crude peptides were purified by a preparative reverse\u2010phase HPLC. Molecular masses of the peptide were confirmed by mass spectroscopy using a Bruker Esquire 3000\u00a0+\u00a0instrument equipped with an electro\u2010spray ionization source and a quadrupole ion trap detector (QITD). The purity of the peptides was about 95% as evaluated by analytical reverse\u2010phase HPLC. Peptide conjugation with fluorescent dyes (ATTO) was performed by reacting peptide thiol groups with maleimide\u2010ATTO dyes. Briefly, peptides were dissolved at a 5\u00a0mg/ml concentration in PBS buffer (pH 7.2) and 1.1 equivalents of maleimide\u2010dye were added to the solution. Reaction was monitored by HPLC until completion and then the product isolated by preparative HPLC. HK2pep cleavage assay Human recombinant MMP9 (911MP, R&D) was reconstituted following manufacturer's instructions in a buffer composed by 50\u00a0mM Tris, 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 10\u00a0mM CaCl 2 , and 0.05% Brij\u221235 (w/v) at pH 7.5 and activated with  p \u2212aminophenylmercuric acetate (Sigma). hMMP9 (20\u00a0nM) was incubated for 4\u00a0h with 1\u00a0\u03bcg HK2pep in a final 100\u00a0\u03bcl volume; samples were analyzed by mass/spec as described above. Measurement of hexokinase enzymatic activity Hexokinase enzymatic activity was measured monitoring NADPH formation at 37\u00b0C with Infinite M200 spectrophotometer (TECAN) in a buffer containing 50\u00a0mM Tris, 10\u00a0mM MgCl 2 , 4\u00a0mM ATP, 2\u00a0mM glucose, 0.1\u00a0U/ml G6PDH, and 1\u00a0mM NADP, pH 7.4. Experiments were carried out either using Human HK2 recombinant protein (0.5\u00a0\u03bcg; HXK0703, ATGEN) or total cell lysate (20\u00a0\u03bcg) were exposed for 30\u00a0min to 10\u00a0\u03bcM cl\u2010HK2pep. To discriminate between HK1 and HK2 activities in cells, samples were heated to 46\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min in order to inactivate thermo\u2010sensitive HK2 activity. Immunofluorescence (IF) analyses IF experiments were carried out 24\u00a0h after transfection with TransIT \u00ae \u2010LT1 (Mirus) on cells fixed in 4% PFA, quenched with NH 4 Cl (0.24% in PBS), and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X\u2010100. Primary antibodies (rabbit monoclonal anti\u2010HK2, H.738.7, Thermo Scientific; mouse monoclonal anti\u2010TOM20, sc\u201017764, Santa Cruz) were diluted 1:150 in blocking solution (2% BSA, 10% goat serum, and 0.2% gelatin in PBS) and incubated for 90\u00a0min, at RT; AlexaFluor488/555/647\u2010conjugated secondary antibodies (Life Technologies) were diluted 1:300 in blocking solution and incubated 45\u00a0min at RT. Images were collected on a Leica SP5\u2010II confocal microscope and equipped with a 100\u00d7/1.4\u00a0N.A. Plan Apochromat objective. A WLL laser was used to excite each specific dye, and a HyD (Leica) was employed for signal collection. After background subtraction, Pearson's co\u2010localization coefficient was calculated with the  ImageJ Co\u2010localization  Analysis plugin. Displayed images were processed with the automatic ImageJ plugin  Enhance image  to improve signal intensity, but analyses were performed on raw, background\u2010subtracted data. For measurements of co\u2010localization with the split\u2010GFP\u2010based probe for ER\u2010mitochondria contacts (SPLICS L )  20 , TOM20 and HK2 channels were background subtracted, a threshold (the mean fluorescence intensity for each cell) was imposed, and the % of pixels co\u2010localized with SPLICS L  was calculated, as described  41 . The plasmids encoding mt\u2010YFP, mt\u2010RFP, and ER\u2010CFP were previously described  41 . Mitochondrial Ca 2+  measurements For FRET\u2010based ER Ca 2+  measurements, cells were transfected with the ER\u2010targeted D4ER Ca 2+  probe and mounted into an open\u2010topped chamber in Krebs\u2013Ringer modified buffer (mKRB, in mM: 140 NaCl, 2.8 KCl, 2 MgCl 2 , 10 HEPES, 11 glucose, pH 7.4 at 37\u00b0C) supplemented with CaCl 2  1\u00a0mM; imaging was performed with a DM6000 inverted microscope (Leica, HCX Plan Apo 40\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0oil objective, NA 1.25), as previously described  42 . Excitation light was generated every 5s by a 410\u00a0nm LED (Led Engin LZ1\u201000UA00 LED). ImageJ was used for off\u2010line analysis of FRET experiments. YFP and CFP images were background\u2010subtracted and analyzed selecting specific regions of interest (ROIs) on each cell. The ratio (R) between YFP and CFP emissions was calculated for each frame. For GCAMP6f Ca 2+  measurements, cells were transfected with a cDNA encoding mitochondrial and nuclear GCAMP6f  41 . To perform Ca 2+  measurements, medium was replaced with mKRB buffer supplemented with 1\u00a0\u03bcM CsH (Adipogen) and with 1\u00a0mM CaCl 2  or 500\u00a0\u03bcM EGTA. Where indicated, specific drugs were added to the buffer and pre\u2010incubated for 30\u00a0min with BAPTA\u2010AM (5\u00a0\u03bcM, Thermo Fisher Scientific) or 1\u00a0h with Xestospongin C (5\u00a0\u03bcM, Santa Cruz), CsA (5\u00a0\u03bcM, Sigma), C63 (5\u00a0\u03bcM), or PD150606 (50\u00a0\u03bcM, Calbiochem). Fluorescence was recorded with an inverted microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 100, Fluar 40\u00d7 oil objective, NA 1.30) in the 500\u2013530\u00a0nm range (by a band\u2010pass filter, Chroma Technologies). Probes were sequentially excited at 475\u00a0nm and at 410\u00a0nm, respectively, for 180 and 300\u00a0ms, every 5\u00a0s. Excitation light, produced by a monochromator (polychrome V; TILL Photonics), was filtered with a 505\u00a0nm DRLP filter (Chroma Technologies). After background subtraction, images were analyzed with ImageJ, calculating the ratio (R) between emissions generated by exciting cells at 475 and 410\u00a0nm, respectively, in specific ROIs comprising the entire mitochondrial network. [Ca 2+ ] is proportional to R. For aequorin Ca 2+  measurements, cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding low\u2010affinity mitochondrial matrix aequorin (mit\u2010Aeqmut), which was reconstituted by incubating cells for 1\u00a0h in mKRB, supplemented with CaCl 2  1\u00a0mM and native coelenterazine (5\u00a0\u03bcM, Biotium). Measurements were performed as previously described  41 . IP 3  measurement assay In order to assess changes in intracellular IP 3  levels, cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding the GFP\u2010tagged pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of PLC\u2010\u03b41 (GFP\u2010PHD). Quantification of IP 3  generation was evaluated as variations in cytosolic GFP\u2010PHD fluorescence (F) normalized to initial cytosolic fluorescence (F0), due to the release of GFP\u2010PHD from the plasma membrane upon PIP2 cleavage and IP 3  generation  43 . Only cells (~80%) in which a plasma membrane localization of GFP\u2010PHD was evident were selected for analysis. Images were collected on a DM6000 inverted microscope (Leica, HCX Plan Apo 40\u00d7 oil objective, NA 1.25). Excitation light was generated every 5\u00a0s by a 460\u00a0nm LED (Led Engin). Measurements of mitochondrial membrane potential Mitochondrial membrane potential was analyzed using the fluorescent potentiometric compound tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM, 20\u00a0nM; Invitrogen). Cells were incubated in mKRB or DMEM without phenol red and with CsH (1\u00a0\u03bcM) to inhibit P\u2010glycoproteins. Recordings were performed either with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX71 or Leica DMI600B) or with a flow cytometer (FACSCanto II, Becton Dickinson). For live microscope experiments, recordings were carried out every 30 sec using CellR software (Olympus) or LAS AF software (Leica). For flow cytometry analyses, TMRM signals are measured every 15\u00a0min and analyzed with FACSDiva software (Becton Dickinson). Movies were realized using CellR software (Olympus). Cell viability assays Cell viability was assessed either by cytofluorimetry or by fluorescence microscopy. Cytofluorimetric recordings of phosphatidylserine exposure on the cell surface (increased staining of FITC\u2010conjugated Annexin V; Roche) and loss of plasma membrane integrity (7\u2010AAD staining; Sigma) were repeated every 15\u00a0min on a FACSCanto II instrument and analyzed with FACSDiva software. Double\u2010negative cells were considered viable. Fluorescence microscope recordings were performed with Leica DMI600B microscope and acquired with LAS AF software in the presence of Annexin V\u2010FITC, 7\u2010AAD, and TMRM pre\u2010incubated for 45\u00a0min. Images and movie obtained with LAS AF software were analyzed with ImageJ software. Isolation of B lymphocytes Cell samples that matched standard morphological and immunophenotypic criteria for B\u2010CLL were collected from 22 therapy\u2010free patients after obtaining informed consent according to the Declaration of Helsinki. This study was authorized by the Ethics Committee of the Padova University Hospital (Approve Code: n. 3529/AO/14). Patient characteristics are reported in Table\u00a0 1 . Cells were separated by Ficoll\u2010Hypaque gradient centrifugation (Euroclone), and B cells were purified from the PBMCs by removing T cells with the sheep erythrocyte rosetting method  44 . Untreated peripheral blood B cells were isolated from the PBMCs of healthy donors by negative selection with the RosetteSep for isolation of B cells (StemCell Technologies). All samples were used when they contained \u2265\u00a095% CD19 +  cells, as assessed by flow cytometry. \n In vitro  tumorigenesis assays For soft agar assays, cells in DMEM medium supplemented with 0.5% serum were mixed with low melting point agarose (Promega) at a final 0.6% concentration and plated on a bottom layer of DMEM with 1% LMP agarose. Fresh medium (DMEM 4% serum) was added every 3 rd  day. At day 15 th , colonies were stained with Crystal Violet 0.005% and analyzed with ImageJ software. For focus forming assays, cells were seeded in standard DMEM medium with 10% FBS, which was replaced with DMEM 0.5% FBS after cells reached confluence. Treatment with peptides was performed after formation of foci; dead cells were highlighted by Trypan Blue staining. Images were acquired using a Leica DMIL LED microscope equipped with a Leica ICC50 HD camera. \n In vivo  tumorigenesis assays Colon cancer CT26 cells or breast cancer 4T1 cells were allografted in Balb/c mice according to a protocol approved from Italian Health Ministry (authorization number: 547/2016\u2010PR). Briefly, 100,000 CT26 cells or 200,000 4T1 cells were injected subcutaneously in the flank of male or female animals, respectively, in a 100\u00a0\u03bcl final volume containing 30% Matrigel (Corning). Tumors were visible under the skin after 7\u20139\u00a0days and measured with caliper (two major axes). Tumor volume was calculated using the formula: (a*b 2 )/2. Ultrasound inspections of representative tumors were performed using Vevo 2100 (Visualsonic, Fujifilm). Acquisitions, measurements, and 3D reconstructions of tumors were done using VevoLAB 1.7.0.7071 software. Peptides were injected as described in the text. Measurements of extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) \n In vivo  ECAR was measured in order to assess changes in glycolytic activity in a kinetic mode on cell monolayers with an extracellular flux analyzer (Agilent Seahorse XF24), as described  45 . ECAR values were then normalized for the protein content of each sample.",

  "introduction": "Introduction Hexokinases are a family of four isoforms that catalyze phosphorylation of glucose, making it available for utilization in glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, glycogenesis, and hexosamine biosynthesis  1 . HK2, the most active isozyme, is markedly expressed in cells characterized by a high rate of glucose consumption, such as adipose, skeletal, and cardiac muscle. During the neoplastic process, metabolic changes are required to allow cell growth in conditions of fluctuating nutrient and oxygen availability  2 . HK2 plays a major role in this metabolic rewiring  3 ,  4 ,  5 , being induced by oncogenic K\u2010Ras activation  6  or in response to (pseudo)hypoxia  7 ,  8 . HK2 is mainly bound to the outer mitochondrial membrane, where it can gain privileged access to newly synthesized ATP, thus increasing efficiency in glucose usage  9 , while following glucose deprivation HK2 elicits autophagy by inhibiting mTORC1  10 . HK2 binding to mitochondria is increased by Akt phosphorylation, a key metabolic event occurring downstream to many signaling pathways hyperactivated in tumor cells  11 , and by interactions with DMPK and Src kinases  12 , whereas it is inhibited by the Akt\u2010antagonizing phosphatase PHLPP and by hexokinase enzymatic product glucose\u20106\u2010phosphate  10 . Moreover, mitochondrial HK2 takes part in the protection of cancer cells from noxious stimuli through poorly defined mechanisms that include antagonizing the activity of pro\u2010apoptotic Bcl\u20102 family proteins and increasing anti\u2010oxidant defenses through interaction with the fructose\u20102,6\u2010bisphosphatase TIGAR, which elicits pentose phosphate pathway induction  13 . In cancer patients, HK2 induction is related to stage progression, acquisition of invasive and metastatic capabilities, and poor prognosis  14 . HK2 promotes neoplastic growth in glioblastoma multiforme  15 , confers chemoresistance in epithelial ovarian cancer  16 , and is required for tumor onset and maintenance in mouse models of lung and breast cancer, where its genetic ablation is therapeutic without adverse effects  6 . Thus, HK2 constitutes a promising target for developing anti\u2010neoplastic strategies, but the clinical use of hexokinase inhibitors is hampered by lack of specificity or side effects  17  potentially associated with glucose metabolism derangement. A possible alternative approach is detaching HK2 from mitochondria, as we and others have previously shown that this can induce opening of a mitochondrial channel, the permeability transition pore (PTP), and consequently cell death  12 ,  13 ,  18 ,  19 . However, both a detailed comprehension of the molecular mechanisms leading to cell damage and the development of a HK2\u2010targeting tool that is operational in  in\u00a0vivo  tumor models are required to translate this information into the groundwork for future anti\u2010neoplastic approaches. Here, we demonstrate that in neoplastic cells, HK2 localizes in MAMs, specific subdomains of interaction between mitochondria and ER. HK2 detachment from MAMs rapidly elicits a massive Ca 2+  flux into mitochondria and consequently a calpain\u2010dependent cell death. We ignite this process with a HK2\u2010targeting peptide composed by modular units that can be adapted to  in\u00a0vivo  delivery, without affecting hexokinase enzymatic activity and with no adverse effects on animal models.",
  "results": "Results and Discussion HK2 localizes in MAMs of neoplastic cells Dissection of submitochondrial HK2 localization can provide important functional clues, as mitochondria compartmentalize specific activities in domains formed by multiprotein platforms. After confirming that HK2 associates with tumor cell mitochondria (Fig\u00a0 1 A), we have found that it specifically localizes in MAMs by merging the fluorescence of HK2\u2010conjugated antibodies with mitochondria\u2010targeted YFP and ER\u2010targeted CFP (Fig\u00a0 1 B) or with a split\u2010GFP\u2010based probe for ER\u2010mitochondria contacts (SPLICS L )  20  (Fig\u00a0 1 C). These experiments have been extended to diverse HK2\u2010expressing tumor cell models (Fig\u00a0 EV1 A and B), and their quantification indicate both that 70\u201380% of HK2 localizes in MAMs and that most cellular MAMs harbor HK2 proteins (Fig\u00a0 1 D\u2013F). Interestingly, the use of a short\u2010range, split\u2010GFP\u2010based approach (SPLICS S )  20  designed to identify proteins localized in the tighter MAM fraction does not detect HK2 (Fig\u00a0 EV1 C). The SPLICS L  analysis also showed that HK2 is significantly enriched in MAMs with respect to TOM20, a protein that is uniformly distributed in the outer mitochondrial membrane (Fig\u00a0 EV1 D). MAMs are dynamic structures that control the exchange between ER and mitochondria of ions and lipids, tuning complex biological processes such as ER stress, autophagy, cell death and maintenance of glucose homeostasis  21 ,  22 ,  23 . A pivotal role of MAMs is the regulation of Ca 2+  fluxes from ER to mitochondria through IP3Rs  24 ; thus, HK2 displacement from MAMs could affect intracellular Ca 2+  dynamics, raising the possibility that a Ca 2+  dyshomeostasis can ensue and damage neoplastic cells. Figure 1 HK2 locates in MAM of cancer cells and is displaced by HK2pep \n \n A Immunofluorescence staining of HK2 with an AlexaFluor488\u2010conjugated antibody in HeLa cells expressing mitochondria\u2010targeted RFP.

Design of a peptide that displaces HK2 from MAMs without affecting hexokinase enzymatic activity To investigate this possibility and to generate a tool with a potential anti\u2010tumor activity  in\u00a0vivo , we have conceived a HK2\u2010targeting cell penetrating peptide (CPP), dubbed HK2pep (Fig\u00a0 1 G). HK2pep is designed with a modular structure composed of: (i) a N\u2010terminal HK2 tail, which acts as the active moiety by displacing HK2 from the outer mitochondrial membrane (in the negative control, SCRpep, this HK2\u2010specific sequence is substituted by a scrambled one); (ii) a polycation stretch required for plasma membrane permeation; (iii) a polyanion sequence that shields polycation charges; and iv) a matrix metalloprotease 2 and 9 (MMP2/9) target sequence that links the two charged stretches. As previously observed with similar actionable CPPs  25 , the metalloprotease target sequence inhibits cell uptake of the peptide until its polycation sequence is unmasked by MMP2/9 cleavage. MMPs are highly expressed in a variety of tumor types, where they induce extracellular matrix remodeling and favor cancer cell invasiveness  26 . Hence, HK2pep should be preferentially activated inside neoplasms, and its subsequent entry through the plasma membrane would then lead to HK2 displacement from mitochondria and eventually cancer cell death. Moreover, HK2pep is not permeable across the endothelium of normal blood vessels, but its dimension (about 5\u00a0kDa) allows passage across the fenestrated endothelium that perfuses many cancer types. The active moiety of HK2pep (i.e., the cleaved peptide, cl\u2010HK2pep, Fig\u00a0 1 G) is indeed able to enter cells, to interact with mitochondria (Fig\u00a0 EV2 A), and to induce HK2 detachment from MAMs in <\u00a02\u00a0min (Figs\u00a0 1 H and  EV2 B). cl\u2010HK2pep does not perturb hexokinase enzymatic activity either on the purified enzyme (Fig\u00a0 1 I) or on cell samples, where it is equally ineffective on HK2 and on the widespread isozyme HK1 (Figs\u00a0 1 J and  EV2 C). Moreover, the use of a subtoxic peptide concentration indicates that it does not affect the glycolytic activity of the target cell (Fig\u00a0 EV2 D). Figure EV2 Related to Fig\u00a0 1 . Characterization of cl\u2010HK2pep \n \n HeLa cells expressing mitochondrial\u2010targeted RFP are treated for 2\u00a0min with either cl\u2010SCRpep or cl\u2010HK2pep (1\u00a0\u03bcM each) labeled with the green fluorophore ATTO 488. The yellow signal indicates mitochondrial localization of the peptide. Scale bar: 15\u00a0\u03bcm. HK2 displacement from HeLa mitochondria after a 2\u2010min treatment with cl\u2010HK2pep is shown by loss of merging signal analyzed as in Fig\u00a0 1 C. cl\u2010SCRpep is used as a negative control, and Pearson's co\u2010localization coefficient is indicated in figure (cl\u2010SCRpep  n \u00a0=\u00a040 cells; cl\u2010HK2pep  n \u00a0=\u00a051 cells;  P \u00a0<\u00a00.01 with Student's  t \u2010test). Scale bar: 15\u00a0\u03bcm. Effect of 10\u00a0\u03bcM cl\u2010HK2pep on glucose phosphorylation in CT26 cell extracts, where both total hexokinase activity and HK1/HK2\u2010specific activities are measured (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD,  n \u00a0=\u00a03 independent experiments). Extracellular acidification rate measurements performed on HeLa cells treated with either cl\u2010SCRpep or cl\u2010HK2pep (200\u00a0nM; mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM,  n \u00a0=\u00a03 independent experiments, Student's  t \u2010test analysis n.s.). HK2 detachment from MAMs elicits a Ca 2+  flux into mitochondria via IP3Rs and plasma membrane that causes mitochondrial depolarization In accord with a role played by several MAM proteins in the regulation of Ca 2+  homeostasis, cl\u2010HK2pep prompts cycles of ER Ca 2+  release and refill (Fig\u00a0 2 A) and boosts cytosolic IP 3  levels (Fig\u00a0 2 B). This IP 3  rise is prevented by pre\u2010incubation with the IP3R inhibitor Xestospongin C (Xe\u2010C; Fig\u00a0 2 B) and by chelating cytosolic Ca 2+  (Fig\u00a0 EV3 A), and delayed with respect to the Ca 2+  release from ER (compare Fig\u00a0 2 A and B). These observations are consistent with cl\u2010HK2pep eliciting a primary Ca 2+  efflux from ER that prompts a surge in cytosolic IP 3 \n 27 . Indeed, Ca 2+  enhances PLC activity that generates IP 3 \n 28 , further amplifying ER Ca 2+  release via IP3Rs. Figure 2 \n HK 2 detachment from  MAM s prompts Ca 2+  influx and depolarization in mitochondria following  IP 3R opening \n Data information: Experiments throughout the figure are carried out on HeLa cells; cl\u2010SCRpep, negative control of cl\u2010HK2pep (2\u00a0\u03bcM each).

I Co\u2010immunoprecipitation between HK2 and GRP75. Mitochondria can promptly take up Ca 2+  released from ER, resulting in modulation of the activity of Krebs cycle enzymes and preventing deregulated increases in cytosolic [Ca 2+ ]  24 ,  29 . cl\u2010HK2pep treatment rapidly boosts mitochondrial [Ca 2+ ] in a stable and Xe\u2010C\u2010sensitive way ( Movie EV1  and Fig\u00a0 2 C\u2013E), rising mitochondrial [Ca 2+ ] to about 50\u00a0\u03bcM (Fig\u00a0 2 F). However, chelation of extracellular Ca 2+  only induces a transient mitochondrial [Ca 2+ ] peak of about 12\u00a0\u03bcM (Fig\u00a0 2 F), indicating that cl\u2010HK2pep administration elicits both Ca 2+  release from ER and Ca 2+  entry through plasma membrane, probably as a secondary effect  30 , and that mitochondria take up Ca 2+  from both sources. HK2 targeting also prompts a sudden and massive mitochondrial depolarization (Fig\u00a0 2 G and H,  Movies EV2  and  EV3  and Fig\u00a0 EV3 B\u2013E), which follows the increase in mitochondrial [Ca 2+ ] (Fig\u00a0 EV3 F and G). This depolarization is inhibited by chelating cytosolic or extracellular Ca 2+  and by the IP3R inhibitor Xe\u2010C (Fig\u00a0 2 I and J,  Movie EV4  and Fig\u00a0 EV3 H). Therefore, the HK2\u2010targeted peptide causes mitochondrial Ca 2+  overload as a consequence of Ca 2+  release form ER via IP3Rs and of Ca 2+  entry through plasma membrane. This signaling is further supported by the observation that HK2 co\u2010immunoprecipitates with GRP75 (Fig\u00a0 EV3 I), a chaperone that directly interacts with IP3R at MAMs and favors mitochondrial Ca 2+  uptake upon IP 3 \u2010dependent Ca 2+  release from the ER. This interaction is in line with the observation that HK2 locates to loose mitochondria\u2010ER contacts sites (Fig\u00a0 1 C and F), which can accommodate the bulky IP3R\u2010Grp75\u2010VDAC complexes  24 . The HK2\u2010targeting peptide triggers calpain\u2010dependent cell death Overcoming the efflux and the buffering capacity of Ca 2+  in mitochondria can induce the permeability transition pore (PTP), a high conductance channel the opening of which commits cells to death  31 ,  32 . PTP opening is independently inhibited by two unrelated molecules, Cyclosporin\u2010A (CsA) and C63, but this inhibitory effect can be overwhelmed by intense stimuli of PTP induction  33 . We find that both CsA and C63 do not affect mitochondrial Ca 2+  uptake following cl\u2010HK2pep treatment (Fig\u00a0 3 A), but markedly delay mitochondrial depolarization (Fig\u00a0 3 B and  Movies EV5  and  EV6 ), indicating that this occurs downstream to PTP induction. Figure 3 \n HK 2pep induces  PTP \u2010 and calpain\u2010dependent cell death \n Data information: Experiments throughout the figure are carried out on HeLa cells; cl\u2010SCRpep, negative control of cl\u2010HK2pep (2\u00a0\u03bcM each), where indicated, the caspase inhibitor Z\u2010VAD\u2010fmk or the calpain inhibitor PD150606 (50\u00a0\u03bcM each) are pre\u2010incubated 1\u00a0h before peptide treatment. Experiments using TMRM or GCAMP6f probes are analyzed as in Fig\u00a0 A, B Effects of the PTP desensitizers CsA or C63 (5\u00a0\u03bcM each, 1\u00a0h pre\u2010incubation) on mitochondrial Ca 2+  levels recorded with GCAMP6f (A) and on mitochondrial membrane potential assessed with TMRM (B) in cells treated with cl\u2010HK2pep. C\u2013F Cell death induction by cl\u2010HK2pep; in the cytofluorimetric analyses reported in C, E, and F, viable cells are double negative for Annexin V\u2010FITC and 7\u2010AAD staining and measured 15\u00a0min after peptide treatment; in the kinetic experiment shown in D (scale bar: 50\u00a0\u03bcm), viable cells are double negative for Annexin V\u2010FITC and 7\u2010AAD and TMRM positive.

In C, F, and G, data are presented as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD of at least three independent experiments. In C *** P \u00a0<\u00a00.001 with Student's  t \u2010test; in F and G,  P \u00a0<\u00a00.0001 with a two\u2010way ANOVA (cl\u2010HK2pep treatment versus cl\u2010HK2pep+PD150606 or cl\u2010SCRpep treatments); Bonferroni post\u2010test in graph *** P \u00a0<\u00a00.001 (cl\u2010HK2pep versus cl\u2010SCRpep and cl\u2010HK2pep versus PD150606\u00a0+\u00a0cl\u2010HK2pep). The HK2\u2010targeting peptide abruptly elicits cell death in all tested cancer cell models (Fig\u00a0 3 C). The effect of cl\u2010HK2pep did not change when cells were kept in the absence of glucose or were treated with HK inhibitors (Fig\u00a0 EV4 A and B), indicating that it is independent of HK2 enzymatic activity. Peptide administration triggers mitochondrial depolarization in most tumor cells after 2\u20134\u00a0min, followed by phosphatidylserine exposure on the cell surface and plasma membrane rupture in <\u00a01\u00a0h (Fig\u00a0 3 D and E,  Movie EV7 ). Even though these are typical apoptotic changes, none of them is affected by the pan\u2010caspase inhibitor Z\u2010VAD\u2010fmk (Figs\u00a0 3 E and  EV4 C\u2013E). However, the broad\u2010spectrum calpain inhibitor PD150606 abrogates cl\u2010HK2pep\u2010dependent induction of mitochondrial depolarization and cell death (Figs\u00a0 3 E\u2013G and  EV4 F\u2013L) without affecting the mitochondrial Ca 2+  rise triggered by the peptide (Fig\u00a0 3 H). Taken together, these data indicate that HK2 displacement from MAMs does not trigger a classical apoptotic pathway, but rather activates a cell death process relying on the Ca 2+ \u2010dependent proteases calpains  34 . We also evaluated the effect of cl\u2010HK2pep administration on non\u2010transformed cell types. Mouse RAW 264.7 macrophages and mouse C2C12 myoblasts express HK2 (Fig\u00a0 EV4 M), even though it is barely located in MAMs (Fig\u00a0 EV4 N). Treatment with cl\u2010HK2pep is poorly effective in inducing death of these cell models (Fig\u00a0 EV4 O and P), and it does not elicit any apoptosis in HK2\u2010negative hepatocytes (Fig\u00a0 EV4 Q).

Cell death is assessed by cytofluorimetry as in Fig\u00a0 3 C (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD, three independent experiments). The HK2\u2010targeting peptide kills primary B\u2010chronic lymphatic leukemia (B\u2010CLL) cells and inhibits neoplastic growth of colon and breast cancer cells In order to test its efficacy as a potential anti\u2010neoplastic treatment, we studied the effect of cl\u2010HK2pep on freshly isolated leukemia cells obtained from B\u2010CLL patients. B\u2010CLL is the most common leukemia form that accounts for about 40% of all adult leukemias  35 . Although in the last years several new molecules, including anti\u2010CD20 antibodies as well as kinase inhibitors, have become available for B\u2010CLL therapy, the disease remains incurable and B\u2010CLL patients usually relapse and/or become refractory. Induction of HK2 contributes to rituximab resistance  36 , and release of MMP9 increases motility of B\u2010CLL cells  37 ; hence, B\u2010CLL constitutes an interesting model for testing the effectiveness of HK2pep. HK2 is poorly detectable in non\u2010transformed B cells, whereas it is expressed in B\u2010CLL cells of all patients that we have analyzed (Fig\u00a0 4 A and B) independently of their mutation status (Table\u00a0 1 ). All these patients\u2019 cells undergo a massive mitochondrial depolarization and cell death in the first 15\u00a0min of cl\u2010HK2pep treatment (Fig\u00a0 4 C\u2013E). These events are calpain\u2010dependent (Fig\u00a0 4 C\u2013E) and in all analyzed samples HK2 targeting completely erases B\u2010CLL cells (Fig\u00a0 4 F), whereas it is less effective in inducing death in non\u2010neoplastic, CD19 +  B cells (Fig\u00a0 4 G). Figure 4 \n HK 2pep kills primary B\u2010 CLL  cells \n \n A Representative IHCs in human reactive lymphoid tissue, where HK2 expression is mainly restricted to proliferating blasts within germinal centers (center) and in patient B\u2010CLL cells.

HK2\u2010expressing B\u2010CLL cells (B; GAPDH and respiratory complex III subunit UQCRC2 are cytosol and mitochondrial loading controls, respectively) undergo mitochondrial depolarization assessed by TMRM staining (C) and cell death, measured by cytofluorimetric analysis of Annexin V\u2010FITC and 7\u2010AAD staining (D\u2010G). Cells are treated with 5\u00a0\u03bcM cl\u2010HK2pep; PD150606 (50\u00a0\u03bcM) is pre\u2010incubated for 1\u00a0h. Experiments are carried out on samples from at least 10 patients and on CD19 + , primary B lymphocytes from 5 healthy controls.

John Wiley & Sons, Ltd We have then evaluated the effect of targeting HK2 on solid tumors. Silencing HK2 expression hampers the ability of cancer cells to form colonies (Fig\u00a0 5 A and B), and HK2 targeting with both cl\u2010HK2pep and the entire HK2pep inhibits  in\u00a0vitro  tumorigenic growth by killing cancer cells (Fig\u00a0 5 C and D). Efficacy of the entire HK2pep indicates that its active moiety is released by MMP2/9 cleavage and that this peptide can be used on  in\u00a0vivo  neoplastic models in which HK2 and MMP2/9 are expressed (Figs\u00a0 5 E and  EV5 A). We observe that intratumor injections of either cl\u2010HK2pep or entire HK2pep significantly decrease the volume of allograft\u2010injected colon cancer cells (Fig\u00a0 5 F), and the same result is achieved by intraperitoneal injection of entire HK2pep on both colon and breast cancer allografts (Figs\u00a0 5 G and H, and  EV5 C and D,  Movies EV8  and  EV9 ). Peptide administration does not cause any harm in treated animals, as assessed by lack of weight loss and of tissue damage (Fig\u00a0 EV5 B and E), whereas it decreases mitotic index and enhances apoptosis inside tumor masses (Fig\u00a0 EV5 F).

Our results indicate that HK2 specifically locates in MAMs and that unhinging HK2 from MAMs swiftly elicits calpain\u2010dependent death in cancer cells by funneling Ca 2+  into mitochondria from ER and extracellular milieu. This signaling pathway is unprecedented, even though it is consistent with emerging evidences of a role played by MAMs in the maintenance of glucose homeostasis  23 . We unveil a role of HK2 in handling intracellular Ca 2+  fluxes, which suggests that HK2 can act as a regulatory hub to integrate glucose metabolism with Ca 2+ \u2010mediated biochemical events, spanning from physiological responses to metabolic fluctuations to death induction under stress conditions. Hence, HK2 could contribute to the orchestration of the biochemical crosstalk between ER and mitochondria, with relevant implications both in the physiology and in several pathological conditions of HK2\u2010expressing tissues, including diabetes, ischemic damage of the heart or muscle wasting diseases, notwithstanding tumors. HK2 shuttling to mitochondria is modulated by Akt\u2010dependent threonine phosphorylation  11  and HectH9\u2010dependent, non\u2010proteolytic lysine ubiquitination  38 . These data place mitochondrial localization of HK2 in a multifaceted network of regulatory events, and the functional interaction between HK2 and IP3Rs that we observe further adds to this network. A thorough dissection of the dynamic modulation of these interactions will be instrumental for the comprehension of the effects of HK2 displacement from MAMs. Importantly, non\u2010tumor cells expressing HK2 are much more refractory to peptide toxicity than neoplastic cells. This is a promising observation under a therapeutic perspective. Nonetheless, it is necessary to understand whether MAM composition differs between tumor and non\u2010tumor cells, and how this affects HK2 activity and localization, as well as to connect cell response to HK2pep to the pattern of calpain expression, in order to draw an exhaustive picture of the mode of peptide action and to preview its effectiveness in specific settings. The use of CPPs as vectors for the delivery of molecules with anti\u2010cancer activity constitutes an active field of investigation, even though the transfer of this approach to the clinical practice has been hampered up to now by several shortcomings, such as the lack of cell specificity and the short duration of action  39 . Here, we combine several strategies to overcome these limitations. HK2pep is an activatable peptide composed by assembled modular units that can be adapted to the specific tumor(s) to be targeted. The MMP2/9 cleavage site allows the selective activation of HK2pep where these metalloproteases are highly expressed, as in the microenvironment of several tumors, but cleavage sites for other extracellular matrix components can be envisaged and tailored to specific neoplastic types. The limited size of HK2 pep (<\u00a05\u00a0kDa) allows its passage through the fenestrated endothelium that characterizes many malignancies, and the rapidity of action of its cleaved form can circumvent problems connected with timing of degradation or excretion. Moreover, the absence of any inhibitory effect of HK2pep on the enzymatic activity of hexokinases minimizes the risk of non\u2010specific damage caused by alterations of glucose metabolism at secondary sites. Hence, our approach to displace HK2 from MAMs integrates selectivity, efficacy, and lack of off\u2010target effects and could be evolved toward the development of novel anti\u2010neoplastic strategies, conceivably in combination with other chemotherapeutic approaches that target different liabilities of neoplastic cells.",
