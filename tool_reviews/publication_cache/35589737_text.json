  "abstract": "Neuronal activity is emerging as a driver of central and peripheral nervous system cancers. Here, we examined neuronal physiology in mouse models of the tumor predisposition syndrome Neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1), with different propensities to develop nervous system cancers. We show that central and peripheral nervous system neurons from mice with tumor-causing Nf1 gene mutations exhibit hyperexcitability and increased secretion of activity-dependent tumor-promoting paracrine factors. We discovered a neurofibroma mitogen (COL1A2) produced by peripheral neurons in an activity-regulated manner, which increases NF1-deficient Schwann cell proliferation, establishing that neurofibromas are regulated by neuronal activity. In contrast, mice with the Arg1809Cys Nf1 mutation, found in NF1 patients lacking neurofibromas or optic gliomas, do not exhibit neuronal hyperexcitability or develop these NF1-associated tumors. The hyperexcitability of tumor-prone Nf1-mutant neurons results from reduced NF1-regulated hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel function, such that neuronal excitability, activity-regulated paracrine factor production, and tumor progression are attenuated by HCN channel activation. Collectively, these findings reveal that NF1 mutations act at the level of neurons to modify tumor predisposition by increasing neuronal excitability and activity-regulated paracrine factor production.",

  "methods": "Methods All experiments were performed in compliance with active Animal Studies Committee protocols at Washington University and UT Southwestern. Mice All experiments were performed under active Animal Studies Committee protocols at Washington University School of Medicine (Washington University in St Louis Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee) and UT Southwestern (UT Southwestern Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee). According to these ethics committees, any animals with compromised motion/eating habits or an unhealthy appearance are euthanized. No animals were euthanized due to their tumor burden or as a result of the treatments performed in this study. Mice were maintained on a 12 light/ dark cycle in a barrier facility, at 21\u2009\u00b0C and 55% humidity, and had ad libitum access to food and water. Heterozygous  Nf1  c.5425\u2009C\u2009\u2009>\u2009\u2009T ;  Arg1809Cys-mutant mice were generated by CRISPR/ Cas9 engineering directly into C57Bl/6J embryos, resulting in mice with one wild-type  Nf1  allele and one missense R1809C mutation. The mutation was confirmed by direct sequencing (IDT Technologies). R1809C  Nf1 -mutant mice, as well as heterozygous R681X  and c.3827G\u2009>\u2009C 35 , 36 \n 43 Nf1 -mutant mice were backcrossed to C57Bl/6J and wild-type littermates were used as controls. For pNF studies, mice were generated with the R1809C mutation or a neomycin cassette inserted in exon 31  as the germline  46 Nf1  allele and somatic  Nf1  inactivation in Hoxb7-Cre cells  ( 78 Nf1 flox/- ;Hoxb7-Cre;  Nf1 flox/1809 ;Hoxb7- Cre). In addition, conditional knockout  Nf1 flox/flox ;  Hoxb7- Cre mice were used. Optic glioma-prone mice were generated with the R1809C mutation or a neomycin cassette inserted in exon 31  as the germline  46 Nf1  allele and somatic  Nf1  inactivation in neuroglial progenitor cells  ( 79 Nf1 f/1809 ; hGFAP-Cre or  Nf1 f/neo ; hGFAP-Cre mice). Littermate  Nf1 flox/flox  mice were used as controls. For light/dark-rearing experiments, eight  Nf1 +/neo  mice were reared in the dark for 4 weeks from 4 weeks of age. Eight littermate controls were reared in normal 12\u2009h light/dark cycles. For in vivo lamotrigine treatment of NF1-pNFs, 8-week-old athymic nude mice (Charles River, Stock No. 490) underwent surgery to implant pNF progenitor cells. Mice of both sexes were randomly assigned to all experimental groups without bias, and the investigators were blinded until the final data analysis during all of the experiments. Human-induced pluripotent stem cells and neuronal differentiation NF1 patient heterozygous germline  NF1  gene (Transcript ID NM_000267) mutations were CRISPR/Cas9-engineered into a single commercially available male control human iPSC line (BJFF.6) by the Washington University Genome Engineering and iPSC Core Facility (GEiC). hiPSCs were authenticated based on morphology, as well as by immunocytochemical expression of pluripotency markers. Human iPSCs were differentiated into neural progenitor cells after 7 days of embryoid body formation (StemDiff Neural induction media; STEMCELL Technologies), followed by embryoid body dissociation and plating in PLO/Laminin-coated flasks in 50% DMEM/F12, 50% Neurobasal medium supplemented with N2, B27, 2\u2009mM GlutaMAX (all Gibco), 10\u2009ng/mL hLIF, 3\u2009\u03bcM CHIR99021 and 2\u2009\u03bcM SB431541 (all STEMCELL Technologies). NPCs were subsequently differentiated either into excitatory CNS neurons following incubation in neurobasal medium supplemented with B27, 2\u2009mM glutamine, and 50\u2009U/mL penicillin/streptomycin for a minimum of 2 weeks, or into GABAergic CNS neurons following incubation in neurobasal medium supplemented with 1\u2009\u03bcM cAMP, 10\u2009ng/mL BDNF, 10\u2009ng /mL GDNF, and 10\u2009ng/mL IGF1 . For sensory neuron differentiation, iPSCs were incubated for 8 days in DMEM/F12 supplemented with LDN-193189, CHIR99021, A83-01, RO4929097, SU5402, retinoic acid, and 10% knockout serum replacement followed by 4 weeks of neurobasal medium supplemented with NT3, nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and glial-derived neurotrophic factor. No commonly misidentified cell lines were used in this study. 47 Spinal cord dissection and optic nerve processing Mice were transcardially perfused at 3 months of age with Ringer\u2019s solution and 4% paraformaldehyde. Whole spinal cords were isolated following the removal of gross and muscle tissue and the breaking of vertebral column bones under a microdissection microscope. The entire spinal cord and peripheral nerves were rinsed and fixed in 10% formalin-buffered solution. DRG diameters were measured as previously reported  and tumor volumes were calculated as volume\u2009=\u2009length\u2009\u00d7\u2009width 53 , 80 2 \u2009\u00d7\u20090.52, which approximates the volume of a spheroid . Optic nerves were isolated, imaged using a Leica DFC 3000\u2009G camera, and their volumes were calculated as previously described 53 , 80 . Using ImageJ, four diameter measurements were taken to estimate the thickness of each optic nerve beginning at the chiasm (D 81 0 ), at 150 (D 150 ), 300 (D 300 ), and 450\u2009\u00b5m (D 450 ) anterior to the chiasm. The following equation was used to calculate the estimated optic nerve volume in each of the three sections, the sum of which was ultimately used to calculate the total optic nerve volume: V 1 \u2009=\u20091/12  \u03c0 h (D 0 2 \u2009+\u2009D 0 D 150 \u2009+\u2009D 150 2 ). Primary hippocampal, RGC, and DRG neuron cell culture Primary neuron cultures were generated from postnatal day 4\u201310 WT,  Nf1 +/neo  or  Nf1 +/1809  mice. Hippocampi were dissected in Hibernate-A (Gibco) and primary hippocampal neurons were established after papain dissociation, following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Worthington). Hippocampal neurons were grown for 7 days prior to analyses. Retinae were dissected in Hibernate-A (Gibco), dissociated in papain (Worthington) and ovomucoid inhibitor (Worthington) before being filtered with CD11b magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotech) to deplete microglia. The remaining RGCs were plated on poly-D-lysine (Sigma)-coated plates and incubated in neurobasal media supplemented with N2, T3, transferrin, BSA, progesterone, putrescine, sodium selenite,  l -glutamine, insulin, N-acetyl cysteine, and forskolin. RGC neurons were grown for 4 days prior to analyses. DRG tissues were isolated in HBSS (Gibco), dissociated in papain (Worthington biochemical) and collagenase type I (STEMCELL Technologies), prior to being strained (70\u2009\u00b5m), plated in fibronectin (Fisher)-coated plates, and incubated in 10% fetal bovine serum in DMEM (Gibco). DRG neurons were grown for 7 days. T\u00a0cell and microglia isolation Four to six-week-old WT and  Nf1 +/1809  mouse spleens were homogenized into single-cell suspensions by digestion in PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 0.6% sodium citrate. The homogenates were subsequently washed and incubated with 120 Kunitz units of DNase I for 15\u2009min following red blood cell lysis (eBioscience). Cells were then filtered through a 30\u2009\u00b5M cell strainer to obtain a single-cell suspension. T cells were maintained at 2.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910 6  cells ml \u22121  in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. T cells were treated with 100\u2009ng/\u00b5L midkine (R&D Systems) for 48\u2009h. Microglia isolation was performed on 4\u20136-week-old WT and  Nf1 +/1809  mouse brains using the multi-tissue dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biochemicals) following published protocols . The resulting cells, microglia attached to a monolayer of astrocytes, were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 1\u2009mM  7 l -glutamine, 1\u2009mM sodium pyruvate, 0.6% D-(\u2009+\u2009)-glucose, 1\u2009ng/ml GM-CSF, 100\u2009\u03bcg/ml P/S, and 10% FBS. From 11 days in vitro onwards, the cells were incubated in medium without GM-CSF and at 13 days in vitro, the cells were treated with 6000\u2009pg/mL of recombinant Ccl4 (R&D Systems) for 24\u2009h. At 14 days in vitro, the microglia were mechanically dissociated from the astrocyte layer by gentle shaking (200\u2009g, 5\u2009h, 37\u2009\u00b0C). T-cell and microglia conditioned media were collected for subsequent ELISA experiments, both from control and treated cells following 22\u2009\u00b5M filtration. sh NF1  Schwann cell and  Nf1 \u2212/\u2212  DRG-NSC cultures Normal human Schwann cells (Sciencell) were incubated in SCM (Sciencell) on PDL-coated plates following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and were infected with sh NF1  1\u20133 lentiviral particles (Sigma; 39714, 39715, 39717).  NF1  knockdown was confirmed by western blotting.  Nf1 flox/flox ;  Cre  ( Nf1 \u2212/\u2212 )  DRG dorsal nerve root sphere cells (DRG-NSCs) were isolated from E13.5 embryo DRG/nerve roots , and were infected with Ad-CMV-Cre. DRG-NSCs were incubated in DMEM supplemented with heparin, glucose, HEPES, L-glutamine, N2, B27, sodium carbonate, EGF and bFGF in ultralow cell attachment flasks, or fibronectin-coated flasks for 2D cell proliferation assays. 48 Sensory neuron conditioned media protein analysis and validation of candidate proteins Control,  NF1  or  +/R 1809C NF1 +/R681X  sensory neurons were washed with PBS and were incubated with artificial cerebral spinal fluid (aCSF) for 24\u2009h prior to collecting conditioned media (CM). The media was treated with protease inhibitors (Cell Signaling Technologies), was snap\u00a0frozen, and sent to Applied Biomics for 2D gel electrophoresis analysis. The conditioned media was run on a 2D electrophoresis gel and the proteins were separated by size and pH, as per the vendor\u2019s specifications. The resulting digital images of the 2D gels of CTL,  NF1 +/R681X  and  NF1 +/R1809C  conditioned media (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 6B ) were digitally superimposed pairwise by Applied Biomics (CTL vs  NF1 +/R681X  and CTL vs  NF1 +/R1809C ) in order to detect differentially expressed proteins between each of the  NF1 -mutant neurons and the controls. In total, 176 dots (proteins) were upregulated or downregulated more than 1.5-fold relative to the CTL conditioned media, each dot was assigned a random identification number, and the intensity of the relative expression of each protein was translated into numerical values by the vendor. From the 176 differentially regulated proteins, only six (circled in blue; Fig.\u00a0 5E ) were upregulated more than 1.5-fold in  NF1 +/R681X  but not  NF1 +/R1809C  relative to CTL sensory neuron CM. As such, the identity of these six proteins alone was determined by mass spectrometry by Applied Biomics, following vendor specifications (Source data). No large-scale mass spectrometry or raw proteomics data was generated for these analyses. The concentration of each of these six identified proteins was assayed in independently generated CTL and  NF1 -mutant Schwann cell growth-promoting ( NF1 C383X ,  NF1 R681X ,  NF1 E2207X ) and NF1-mutant non-Schwann cell growth-promoting ( NF1 R1809C ) sensory neurons (Fig.\u00a0 5F  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 6D\u2013H ) conditioned media by respective ELISA assays. Small-molecule treatments A subset of mouse and human CNS and PNS neurons were treated with tetrodotoxin (TTX; 1\u2009\u00b5M), pan-RAS inhibitor IN-1 (1\u2009\u00b5M), lamotrigine (LTR; 200\u2009\u00b5M), or ZD7288 (ZD; 30\u2009\u00b5M) for 3\u2009min prior to collection of cells or conditioned media. A subset of sh NF1  SCs and  Nf1 \u2212/\u2212  DRG NSCs were treated with collagenase (0.001\u2009U/mL), human COL1A2 (12.5\u2009pg/mL), or mouse Col1a2 (12.5\u2009pg/mL) for 24\u2009h. Multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings and analyses Primary hippocampal (300,000 cells/well), RGC (300,000 cells/well), or DRG neurons (150,000 cells/well) from each of the strains assayed (WT , Nf1 +/neo ,  Nf1 +/1809 ) were plated on AXION Biosystems 48-well MEA plates and grown for 10 days in their respective optimal growth media. Each well included neurons from a single mouse. A minimum of six individual mice originating from a minimum of three independent litters were analyzed. Neurons isolated from each animal were plated in a minimum of triplicate technical replicate wells of the MEA plate. For experiments involving pharmacological treatments, neurons isolated from each  Nf1 +/neo  mouse were plated in a minimum of six individual wells, with a minimum of three wells serving as the vehicle-treated controls and a minimum of three wells as the treated cohort. All efforts were taken to ensure even spreading of the neurons throughout each well. Not all 16 electrodes present within each well were within the optimal proximity to neurons and as such not all electrodes detected action potentials (APs). To account for this variation, all metrics were normalized to the number of the active electrodes only. In addition, as the number of active electrodes/well varied between technical replicates of each animal, the AP firing rate of all the replicate wells of each animal was averaged. As such, each data point graphed represents the average of all technical replicates for each given animal. All neurons were recorded for 3\u2009min at a 4.5 standard deviation threshold level and 5000\u2009Hz as a digital filter using AXION Biosystems integrated studio (AxIS) version 2.5.1 software. AP firing rates were calculated from the total number of APs/3\u2009min and are represented as APs/min, only accounting for active electrodes. Representative traces of action potentials were extracted using the AXION Biosystems neural metric tool and Offline sorter x64 version 4 software. Calcium imaging of neurons Primary RGC (150,000 neurons/well) or DRG (75,000 neurons/well) neurons were plated onto poly-D-lysine and laminin-coated 96-well plates for 10 days. At 10 days, the cells were treated with Fluo-8/AM (1345980-40-6, AAT Bioquest), PowerLoad (P10020, ThermoFisher) and Probenecid (P36400; ThermoFisher) for 30\u2009min at 37\u2009\u00b0C and for another 30\u2009min at room temperature. The neurons were subsequently washed with HBSS and incubated for a minimum of 10\u2009min in fresh culture medium supplemented with 5% neuro-background suppressor (F10489; ThermoFisher). The neurons were imaged on a Nikon spinning disk upright epi-fluorescence confocal microscope equipped with a \u00d710 dry objective, and a 488\u2009nm wavelength laser was used for wide-field imaging. The neurons were stimulated by a Ti LAPP DMD (Deformable Mirror Device) LED source for ultrafast photo-stimulation, with 0.1\u2009mW applied during each recording for Fluo-8 excitation. Fluo-8 images were collected at 15\u2009Hz (2048\u2009\u00d7\u20092048 pixels, 1\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm) and the duration of each region of interest (ROI) was limited to 10\u2009min. The fluorescence intensity and optical response to depolarizing membrane potential transients (\u0394F/F) were calculated in Matlab programming environment to generate single-neuron activity traces. The \u0394F/F threshold was set at 4 standard deviation beyond baseline fluorescence. Following data acquisition, the duration and shape of each AP spike were compared by merging all the spikes in the same time window. Neurons from each animal were seeded in six wells and a minimum of three neurons were recorded per well. Data recorded from a minimum of 18 neurons per animal were averaged. Each data point represents a single animal. Immunohistochemistry and Immunocytochemistry All spinal cord and optic nerve fixed tissues as well as human brain tissue, lymph nodes, normal sural nerve, cutaneous neurofibromas or plexiform neurofibromas, and mouse sciatic nerve, cutaneous or plexiform neurofibromas were paraffin-embedded, serially sectioned (5\u2009\u03bcm) and immunostained with GFAP, Iba1, Ki67, CD3, Midkine, GAP43, CD34, Factor XIIIa, SOX10, neurofilament-200, and Col1a2 (Supplementary Table\u00a0 1 ). Immunohistochemical staining was performed using the Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) and appropriate biotinylated secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (StatLab). Primary RGCs, hippocampal neurons, DRG neurons, sh NF1  Schwann cells, and hiPSC-sensory neurons were immunostained with appropriate primary (RGCs: Rbpms, Tuj-1; hippocampal neurons: GAD65, Glutamine synthetase, Tuj-1; DRG neurons: Peripherin, ISL1, Tuj-1; SCs: EGR2, S100\u03b2, OCT6, SOX10; sensory neurons: peripherin, BRN3A, SMI32, ISL1, p75NTR, Nestin, Tuj-1) and secondary Alexa-fluor-conjugated antibodies (Supplementary Table\u00a0 1 ). Images were acquired using Image Studio Lite Version 5.2 software, and LAS AF Lite 3.2.0 software and analyzed using ImageJ 1.53a software, as well as Adobe Photoshop version 21.1.1. RAS, midkine, COL1A2, Ccl4, Ccl5 ELISA assays RAS activity (ThermoFisher), COL1A2 (Fisher Scientific,), Ccl4 (R&D Systems), Ccl5 (Fisher), and Midkine (mouse; LSBio; human; Abcam) ELISAs were performed on homogenized cell pellets (RAS-GTP) or filtered (0.22\u2009\u00b5m) conditioned media (COL1A2, Ccl4, Ccl5, Midkine) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Each assay was performed using a minimum of four independently generated biological replicates. Data from all of these colorimetric assays were collected on a Bio-Rad iMark microplate reader and analyzed using MPM6 v6.3 (Bio-Rad Laboratories) software. Western blotting Western blotting was performed on snap-frozen cells and tissues. Samples were lysed in RIPA buffer (Fisher) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Cell Signaling) and were blotted using appropriate primary (s-Nlgn3, neurofilament-200, peripherin, BRN3A, ISL1, CALCA, \u03b1-tubulin, \u03b2-actin; Supplementary Table\u00a0 1 ) and NIR-conjugated secondary antibodies (Licor). Images were captured and analyzed using the Li-Cor Image Studio Lite Version 5.2 software and are representative of more than three independently generated biological replicates. Quantitative real-time PCR Total RNA was extracted following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (QIAGEN) and reverse-transcribed using a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) qPCR was performed using TaqMan gene expression assays ( Mdk ,  Col1a2 ,  COL1A2 ,  Nlgn3, Adam10, NLGN3, ADAM10 ,  Hcn1-4 ; Supplementary Table\u00a0 2 ) and TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. All reactions were performed using the Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time PCR system equipped with Bio-Rad CFX Manager 3.1 software. Gene expression levels of technical replicates were estimated by \u0394\u0394Ct method using  GAPDH  or  Gapdh  (Supplementary Table\u00a0 2 ) as reference genes. In vivo mouse lovastatin and lamotrigine treatments In total, 17  Nf1 flox/neo ;  GFAP -Cre ( Nf1 -OPG) mice were intraperitoneally administered vehicle (saline in 1% methylcellulose;  n \u2009=\u20099) or 25\u2009mg/ Kg body weight lamotrigine (Selleckchem;  n \u2009=\u20098) from four to six weeks of age, three times a week. The mice were then aged to 12 weeks for optic nerve and RGC analysis. For lovastatin treatments, 20  Nf1 -OPG mice were administered with 10\u2009mg/kg/day lovastatin (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies;  n \u2009=\u200910) or vehicle (saline in 1% methylcellulose;  n \u2009=\u200910) by oral gavage for 4 weeks, 5 days a week, beginning at 12 weeks of age, for 8 weeks. The mice were analyzed at 20 weeks of age. For pNF analyses,  Nf1  DRG-NSCs were implanted in sciatic nerves of 8-week-old athymic nude mice as previously described \u2212/\u2212 . Briefly, the mice underwent surgery to create a pocket by displacing the quadriceps muscle and exposing their sciatic nerve. In all, 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910 49 6 \n Nf1 \u2212/ \u2212  DRG-NSCs were implanted in the pocket around the sciatic nerve, such that the cells could be in direct contact with the nerve before the muscle and skin were sutured. Following recovery from the surgery, the mice were intraperitoneally administered vehicle (saline in 1% methylcellulose;  n \u2009=\u20095) or 25\u2009mg/kg body weight lamotrigine (Selleckchem;  n \u2009=\u20095) three times a week for 6 weeks prior to histological analysis. Published RNA database analysis The analysis for this paper was generated using Partek Flow software, version 10.0 using publicly available datasets (GEO: GSE14038;  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE14038 , Supplementary Table\u00a0 3 ). RNA-seq reads were aligned to the Ensembl release 100 top-level assembly with STAR version 2.7.8a. Gene counts and isoform expression were derived from Ensembl output. Sequencing performance was assessed for the total number of aligned reads, total number of uniquely aligned reads, and features detected. Normalization size factors were calculated for all gene counts by CPM to adjust for differences in sequencing depth. Genes not expressed on average with greater than two count-per-million were excluded from further analysis. Gene-specific analysis was then performed using the lognormal with shrinkage model (limma-trend method) to analyze for expression differences between conditions. Short hairpin constructs, lentiviral production, and neuronal infection Human sh COL1A2  and mouse sh Col1a2  lentiviral particles (TRCN0000090043; TRCN0000090045; TRCN0000335210) were generated as previously described .  61 NF1 +/R681X  or  Nf1 +/neo  sensory neurons were infected with three independent sh COL1A2  lentiviral particles or shRNA scrambled control particles (sc-108080; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 24\u2009h. Neuronal media was refreshed and conditioned media was collected for subsequent assays 48\u201372\u2009h post infection. Quantification and statistical analysis All statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism software (versions v5, v_8.2.1, and v_9.3.1). Paired or unpaired two-tailed Student\u2019s  t  tests or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey\u2019s, Dunnett\u2019s, or Bonferroni post-test correction using GraphPad Prism 5 software. Statistical significance was set at  P \u2009<\u20090.05, and individual p values are indicated within each graphical figure. A minimum of three independently generated biological replicates was employed for each of the analyses. Numbers ( n ) are noted for each individual analysis.

  "introduction": "Introduction While the acquisition of genetic or epigenetic aberrations in preneoplastic cells is an obligate event in tumor formation and progression, cancer\u00a0growth is also dictated by paracrine factors produced by non-neoplastic cells in the local tumor microenvironment . These tumor\u2013stroma interactions are nicely illustrated in the setting of the neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) genetic cancer predisposition syndrome. Patients with NF1, born with a germline mutation in the  1 \u2013 4 NF1  tumor suppressor gene, are prone to developing various tumors, including central and peripheral nervous system tumors, as well as malignancies of the adrenal glands, muscle, blood, and breast . In NF1 nervous system tumors, paracrine factors from T cells, monocytes (macrophages, microglia), and mast cells generate a supportive tumor microenvironment necessary for continued peripheral (neurofibromas) and central (gliomas) nervous system tumor expansion 5 . As such, plexiform neurofibroma (pNF) formation and growth is controlled by the interplay of mast cells, macrophages, leukocytes, and fibroblasts through paracrine factor elaboration 6 \u2013 11 , whereas T cells 10 \u2013 16  and microglia 7 , 17 , 18  influence glioma growth through cytokine (Ccl4, Ccl5) signaling. 6 , 19 \u2013 21 In addition to the critical contributions from immune system cells, we have recently shown that  NF1  mutation in neurons synergizes with light-induced retinal ganglion cell activity to regulate neuroligin-3 (NLGN3) shedding and  Nf1 -optic pathway glioma ( Nf1- OPG) initiation and growth . This finding builds upon prior reports establishing that neurons and neuronal activity increase high-grade glioma growth through the secretion of paracrine factors, like NLGN3 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), in an activity-dependent manner 22  or by forming bona fide AMPA receptor-dependent neuron-to-glioma synapses 23 , 24 . Moreover, these effects of neuronal activity on high-grade glioma growth are amplified by glioma-induced hyperexcitability of neurons 25 , 26 . 26 \u2013 31 To further elucidate the contribution of neuronal activity to central and peripheral nervous system tumor development, we focused on NF1, where affected individuals are prone to developing tumors intimately associated with nerves, including OPGs and pNFs . Using these preclinical models, we previously demonstrated that different germline  32 \u2013 34 Nf1  mutations have dramatically different effects on plexiform neurofibroma and OPG formation in mice , suggesting that the specific  17 , 35 , 36 NF1  germline mutation may regulate tumorigenesis at the level of non-neoplastic cells. In this study, we leveraged a common, naturally occurring  NF1  missense mutation (c.5425C\u2009>\u2009T; p.Arg1809Cys) found in patients with NF1 who do not develop OPGs or neurofibromas. Exploiting this unique mutation, we employed a combination of human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) and  Nf1 -mutant mouse lines to demonstrate that central (retinal ganglion cells; RGCs) and peripheral (sensory neurons and dorsal root ganglion cells; DRGs) nervous system neurons support tumor growth by secreting paracrine factors necessary for tumor progression in an  Nf1  mutation- and neuronal activity-dependent manner. In contrast to mice with other NF1 patient germline  NF1  gene mutations, mice with the Arg1809Cys mutation, like NF1 patients with this mutation, do not form pNFs or OPGs and their DRGs and RGCs, respectively, do not exhibit the RAS-independent neuronal hyperexcitability seen in tumor-forming  Nf1 -mutant central and peripheral nervous system neurons. Based on prior studies revealing that the  NF1  protein, neurofibromin, binds to and regulates hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels  and that HCN channels directly modulate neuronal excitability 37 , we now show that HCN channel dysregulation is responsible for  38 , 39 Nf1 -mutant central and peripheral nervous system neuronal hyperexcitability and consequently increased tumor-driving paracrine factor release, such that HCN channel targeting (using the anti-seizure medication lamotrigine) blocked  Nf1 -OPG progression in vivo. Moreover, we demonstrate that tumor-causing  Nf1  mutations in neurons regulate neuronal production of paracrine factors through both visual experience (light)-evoked neuronal activity, as well as HCN channel dysregulation-mediated baseline neuronal hyperexcitability, highlighting the essential role of neuronal activity in NF1-associated nervous system tumor progression.",
  "results": "Results Arg1809Cys  Nf1 -conditional mutant mice do not develop optic pathway gliomas The NF1 patient c.5425C\u2009>\u2009T p.Arg1809Cys  NF1  mutation  was engineered in mice on a C57Bl/6J background by CRISPR/Cas9 targeting and confirmed by direct sequencing. Wild-type (WT) and heterozygous Arg1809Cys  40 Nf1- mutant mice ( Nf1 +/1809 ) were born from heterozygous  Nf1  parents with the expected Mendelian ratios (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 +/1809 1A ). However, no homozygous  Nf1 1809/1809  mice were born, suggesting embryonic lethality, as seen with conventional  Nf1  knockout mice . Heterozygous mice had similar weights as WT littermate controls and two genetically engineered mouse (GEM) strains harboring different germline NF1 patient-derived germline  41 , 42 Nf1  gene mutations (c.2041C\u2009>\u2009T, p.R681X ; c.3827G\u2009>\u2009C, p.R1276P 35 , 36 ) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 43 1B ). Like patients with the R1809C germline  NF1  gene mutation who lack OPGs (Fig.\u00a0 1A ) , mice harboring a germline  40 , 44 , 45 Nf1 R1809C  mutation with somatic loss of  Nf1  in neuroglial progenitor cells, the optic glioma initiating cells ( Nf1 f/1809 ; hGFAP-Cre mice (F1809C)), did not develop OPGs at 3 months of age (0/8; Fig.\u00a0 1B ). In contrast, all  Nf1 f/neo ; hGFAP-Cre mice ( Nf1 -OPG), where the germline  Nf1  inactivation results from the insertion of a neomycin cassette into exon 31 of the  Nf1  gene , developed OPGs (6/6) with increased optic nerve volumes (0.079\u2009mm 41 , 42 3  Fig.\u00a0 1C ), proliferative indices (5.9% Ki67 +  cells), microglia (11.8% Iba1 +  cells), T cells (7 CD3 +  cells) and GFAP +  cells, as previously reported  (Fig.\u00a0 46 1D ). Importantly, optic nerves from  Nf1 f/1809 ; hGFAP-Cre mice were indistinguishable from  Nf1 f/f  controls (CTL) with respect to optic nerve volume ( Nf1 f/1809 ; hGFAP-Cre, 0.05\u2009mm 3  CTL, 0.057\u2009mm 3 ), proliferative index ( Nf1 f/1809 ; hGFAP-Cre, 0.8%; CTL, 1.03 Ki67 +  cells), microglia content ( Nf1 f/1809 ; hGFAP-Cre, 6.4%; CTL, 6.8% Iba1 +  cells), T-cell content ( Nf1 f/1809 ; hGFAP-Cre, 1.2; CTL, 1 CD3 +  cells) and GFAP immunoreactivity (Fig.\u00a0 1C, D ). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that mice with the Arg1809Cys germline  Nf1  mutation, like their human counterparts, do not develop OPGs.

OPG-associated  Nf1 -mutant CNS neurons are hyperexcitable Prior studies from our laboratories have shown that OPG growth in  Nf1- mutant mice ( Nf1 f/neo ; hGFAP-Cre) is initiated by neuronal activity-dependent paracrine signaling . In these mice, neuroligin-3 (Nlgn3) is shed in the  22 Nf1 -mutant ( Nf1 ) optic nerve in an activity-dependent manner, such that genetic or pharmacological blockade of Nlgn3 shedding inhibits glioma initiation and progression +/neo . Based on these findings, we first examined the neuronal activity of primary WT,  22 Nf1 +/neo , and  Nf1 +/1809  RGCs using multi-electrode arrays (Fig.\u00a0 2A ) or calcium imaging (Fig.\u00a0 2B ) after 10 days in vitro. We found that the  Nf1 +/neo , but not the  Nf1 +/1809 , neurons had increased activity relative to WT RGCs, as measured by action potential (AP) firing rates (2.5\u20133.9-fold increase relative to WT control; Fig.\u00a0 2A, B ). No change in neuronal action potential amplitudes were noted in  Nf1 +/neo  or  Nf1 +/1809  neurons relative to WT controls (Fig.\u00a0 2C ). This suggests that  Nf1  mutations associated with tumor formation cause RGC neurons to be hyperexcitable. Fig. 2 OPG-associated  Nf1- mutant neurons have increased activity and OPG-promoting factor production.

H ,  I  Midkine protein expression is elevated in ( H ) the  Nf1 +/neo  conditioned media (CM) from RGCs in vitro ( n \u2009=\u20097 for all groups;  P \u2009<\u20090.0001), and ( I ) the RGC layer of  Nf1 +/neo  mice relative to WT and  Nf1 +/1809  mice ( n \u2009=\u20095 for each group).

OPG-associated  Nf1 -mutant CNS neurons secrete tumor-promoting factors in an activity-dependent manner To determine whether increased RGC activity triggers the secretion of the two known neuronal OPG-promoting factors, Nlgn3 and midkine , we assessed their transcript and protein expression levels both in vitro and in vivo. Optic nerves (ONs), RGCs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 7 , 22 2A ), and RGCs within the intact retinae from  Nf1 +/neo , but not  Nf1 +/1809 , mice had increased expression of  Nlgn3  RNA (2.0\u20132.3-fold increase; Fig.\u00a0 2D, G ), soluble cleaved Nlgn3 protein (s-Nlgn3; Fig.\u00a0 2E ),  Mdk  RNA (1.6-fold increase; Fig.\u00a0 2F ) and midkine protein (2.2-fold increase; Fig.\u00a0 2H, I ) expression relative to WT controls. Increased midkine expression was also detected in RGCs from  Nf1 +/R681X -mutant mice (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 2B ), another mouse strain that develops optic gliomas following somatic  Nf1  inactivation in neuroglial progenitors, as well as in  Nf1 +/neo , but not  Nf1 +/1809 , mouse primary hippocampal neurons (Supplementary Figs.\u00a0 2 A and  3A, B ). In addition, hippocampal neurons from  Nf1 +/neo  mice similarly exhibited hyperexcitability (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 3C ). The correlation between neuronal midkine production and tumor risk is reinforced in human iPSC-derived central nervous system neurons (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 2C ). Midkine expression is increased both in excitatory (Fig.\u00a0 2J ) and inhibitory (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 2D ) neurons harboring  NF1  mutations that are found in NF1 patients that develop OPGs (c.1149\u2009C\u2009\u2009>\u2009\u2009A, p.Cys381X; c.2041\u2009C\u2009\u2009>\u2009\u2009T, pArg681X; c.6619\u2009C\u2009\u2009>\u2009\u2009T, p.Gln2207X) , but not in  47 NF1 +/R1809C  neurons, relative to controls (CTL). Similarly,  Adam10  transcript expression was only increased in  Nf1 +/neo , but not in  Nf1 +/1809 , mouse retinae, ONs, and RGCs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 2F\u2013H ). In contrast, neither  Nf1 +/neo  nor  Nf1 +/1809  PNS (DRG) sensory neurons had increased  Nlgn3  (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 2I ) or midkine (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 2J, K ) expression relative to WT controls, highlighting the selective upregulation of Nlgn3 and midkine in CNS, rather than in PNS, neurons. As part of a neuron-immune-cancer cell axis in  Nf1 -OPG,  Nf1 -mutant neurons secrete midkine to induce T-cell Ccl4 expression, which in turn, results in microglial elaboration of Ccl5, an obligate OPG growth factor . To ascertain whether this molecular circuitry is intact in mice harboring the  7 , 18 , 19 Nf1 +/1809  mutation, and to exclude defects in other stromal cells (T cells and microglia) that might be additionally responsible for the observed lack of optic gliomas in  Nf1 f/1809 ; hGFAP-Cre mice, we examined the ability of  Nf1 +/1809  T cells and microglia to secrete Ccl4 in response to midkine and Ccl5 in response to Ccl4, respectively (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 2L, M ). Both  Nf1 +/1809  T cells and microglia responded to midkine and Ccl4, respectively, similar to their  Nf1 +/neo  counterparts . Therefore, the lack of OPG formation likely reflects the failure of  7 Nf1 +/1809  neurons to produce glioma-promoting trophic factors. Importantly, blockade of  Nf1 +/neo  neuronal activity with 1\u2009\u00b5M tetrodotoxin (TTX) (\u2009>\u200980-fold decrease; Fig.\u00a0 2K, L ) reduced midkine levels (1.9-fold decrease; Fig.\u00a0 2M ), similar to TTX effects on Nlgn3 , confirming that both Nlgn3 and midkine secretion are neuronal activity-dependent and reversible by pharmacological treatment. 22 HCN channel activity regulates midkine production in OPG-associated  Nf1  RGCs To determine whether light-induced retinal ganglion cell neuronal activity regulates midkine secretion in the optic nerve,  Nf1 +/neo  mice were reared either in 12\u2009h light/dark cycles or completely in the dark for 4 weeks starting at 4 weeks of age. The retinae of dark-reared animals had decreased levels of  Nlgn3  (48% decrease; Fig.\u00a0 3A ) relative to light/dark-reared controls. In stark contrast, retinal  Mdk  RNA and protein expression were not affected by the decrease in visual experience (Fig.\u00a0 3B, C ), suggesting an alternative mechanism for neuronal activity-dependent midkine production. Fig. 3 OPG-associated  Nf1- mutant neuronal hyperexcitability is HCN channel-dependent. A  Neuroligin ( Nlgn3; \n P \u2009<\u20090.0001) but not ( B ) midkine ( Mdk ; ns not significant) transcript relative expression is decreased in retinae of  Nf1 +/neo  mice following dark-rearing from 4 to 8 weeks.

Based on prior experiments demonstrating that HCN channels control neuronal hyperexcitability and that the  Nf1  mutation regulates HCN channel function , we examined the effect of  37 Nf1  mutation on HCN channel function and neuronal excitability.  Hcn1  and  Hcn2  account for the majority of retinal  Hcn  channel expression; however,  Nf1  mutation ( Nf1 +/neo ) does not alter  Hcn  levels (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 2N ). To ascertain whether HCN channel function was responsible for the increased neuronal activity and Nlgn3/midkine production, we treated  Nf1 +/neo  RGC neurons with 200\u2009\u00b5M lamotrigine (LTR), an HCN channel agonist, and assayed neuron activity for 3\u2009min (Fig.\u00a0 3D, E ). Lamotrigine reduced the firing rates in  Nf1 +/neo  RGC neurons (\u2009>\u200980% decrease; Fig.\u00a0 3D, E ). In striking contrast, while lamotrigine treatment of either heterozygous  Nf1 +/neo  or OPG-bearing  Nf1 f/neo ; hGFAP-Cre mice in vivo did not change  Nlgn3  or  Adam10  RNA expression (Fig.\u00a0 3F  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 2O\u2013R ),  Mdk  RNA (Fig.\u00a0 3G ) and protein levels were reduced in  Nf1 +/neo  retinae (1.9\u20132.3-fold decrease; Fig.\u00a0 3H, I  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 2Q ), optic nerves (1.7\u20132-fold decrease; Supplementary Figs.\u00a0 2 P and  3R ) and RGCs (2.2-fold decrease; Fig.\u00a0 3H ) relative to vehicle-treated controls. Conversely, treatment of WT and  Nf1 +/1809  neurons with 30\u2009\u00b5M of the HCN channel antagonist ZD7288 (ZD) resulted in a 14\u201315-fold increase in RGC neuron midkine production (Fig.\u00a0 3J ) but did not alter  Nlgn3  or  Adam10  RNA expression (Fig.\u00a0 3K ). Identical results were obtained using hippocampal neurons (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 3A\u2013H ), supporting the idea that baseline neuronal hyperexcitability mediated by HCN function is a shared feature of  Nf1 -mutant CNS neurons. As a complementary genetic approach, we infected wild-type neurons using three separate short hairpins against  Hcn1  and  Hcn2 . Both alone and in combination, infection of RGC and DRG neurons with the sh Hcn1/2  constructs resulted in rapid neuronal death within 6\u2009hours (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 4A, B ), demonstrating that  Hcn1  and  Hcn2  presence is required for neuronal survival. Similarly, incubation of neurons with TTX, a drug that abolishes neuronal activity, also induces neuronal death within 6\u2009hours(Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 4C ). Together, these data reveal the existence of an HCN channel-dependent mechanism for  Nf1 -mutant CNS tumor-associated neuronal midkine production. Increased  Nf1 -mutant neuron activity is not RAS-dependent As the  NF1  protein (neurofibromin) functions a negative regulator of RAS activity (RAS-GTPase-activating protein), RAS-GTP levels were increased by 2.3\u20132.7-fold in  Nf1 +/1809  RGC and hippocampal neurons relative to WT controls, similar to  Nf1 +/neo  neurons (Fig.\u00a0 3L  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 3I ) and other mouse strains harboring NF1 patient-specific  Nf1  germline mutations . The finding of similarly increased RAS-GTP in  47 Nf1 +/1809  CNS neurons suggests that RAS deregulation is not responsible for the failure of  Nf1 f/1809 ; hGFAP-Cre mice to form tumors. However, it does not exclude RAS as a potential signaling effector downstream of HCN channel activity. In this respect, treatment of  Nf1 +/neo  neurons with the pan-RAS inhibitor, IN-1, reduced RAS-GTP levels (Fig.\u00a0 3M  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 3I ), as well as midkine expression (Fig.\u00a0 3N  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 3J ). In addition, systemic treatment of  Nf1 +/neo ; hGFAP-Cre mice with the RAS inhibitor lovastatin decreased RGC midkine expression in vivo (Fig.\u00a0 3O ), indicating that RAS operates to control midkine expression. Conversely, whereas inhibition of  Nf1 +/neo  neuronal activity by TTX and lamotrigine reduced RAS hyperactivation (Fig.\u00a0 3P  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 3K ), RAS (IN-1) inhibition had no effect on neuronal activity (Fig.\u00a0 3Q, R  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 3L ). Taken together, these results position RAS-mediated neuron midkine production downstream of HCN channel activity, and demonstrate that increased baseline excitability of tumor-associated  Nf1 -mutant neurons is RAS-independent. Increased HCN channel activity prevents OPG progression in vivo To determine whether HCN channel function is critical for OPG formation,  Nf1 f/neo ; hGFAP-Cre ( Nf1 -OPG) mice received intraperitoneal injections of lamotrigine from 6 to 8 weeks of age, at the time of early tumor evolution. Consistent with neuronal activity mediating  Nf1 -OPG progression, HCN activation by lamotrigine reduced OPG development at 3 months of age. Lamotrigine treatment did not decrease optic nerve volumes (1.5-fold increased volumes relative to WT controls; Fig.\u00a0 3S ), unlike dark-reared  Nf1 -OPG mice or those genetically lacking  Ngln3 , where tumor initiation was completely prohibited. However, lamotrigine treatment resulted in reduced optic nerve proliferation (%Ki67 22 +  cells; 5.7-fold decrease), as well as microglia (%Iba1 +  cells; 1.7-fold decrease) and T-cell (CD3 +  cells; 1.6-fold decrease) content, relative to vehicle-treated  Nf1 -OPG mice, comparable to WT mouse optic nerves (Fig.\u00a0 3S, T ). These results indicate that HCN channel-regulated midkine production is necessary for tumor progression, rather than initiation, but establish HCN channel activity as a targetable regulator of neuronal activity-dependent tumor progression. Arg1809Cys  Nf1 -conditional mutant mice do not develop plexiform neurofibromas Since patients with the R1809C germline  NF1  gene mutation also do not develop plexiform neurofibromas (pNFs)  (Fig.\u00a0 40 , 44 , 45 4A ), we engineered  Nf1 +/1809  mice with somatic loss of the conditional  Nf1  allele ( Nf1 flox ) in Schwann cell progenitors, the cells of origin of pNFs . The resulting  48 , 49 Nf1 f/1809 ; Hoxb7-Cre mice were analyzed and compared to conventional  Nf1 -mutant ( Nf1 f/neo ; Hoxb7-Cre) mice that develop pNFs . Unlike  50 Nf1 f/neo ; Hoxb7-Cre mice (11/16), and  Nf1 f/f ; Hoxb7-Cre mice (7/13),  Nf1 f/1809 ; Hoxb7-Cre mice did not develop pNFs at 6 months of age (0/52; Fig.\u00a0 4B ). Moreover,  Nf1 f/1809 ; Hoxb7-Cre mice exhibited neither enlarged DRGs (Fig.\u00a0 4C ) nor histological features of pNFs (Fig.\u00a0 4D, E ), and their DRGs contained fewer total cells, as well as fewer SOX10 +  Schwann cell precursors, the cell of origin for these pNF tumors (Fig.\u00a0 4F, G ), demonstrating that mice harboring the  Nf1  R1809C mutation fail to develop pNFs.

Tumor-associated  NF1- mutant, but not  NF1 +/R1089C , sensory neurons produce COL1A2 in an activity-dependent manner We next sought to ascertain whether  Nf1 -mutant peripheral sensory neurons similarly exhibit increased activity. As such, we analyzed action potential firing rates of WT,  Nf1 +/neo , and  Nf1 +/1809  DRG neurons using multi-electrode array and calcium-imaging recordings (Fig.\u00a0 5A, B ). As observed in  Nf1 +/neo  CNS neurons,  Nf1 +/neo , but not  Nf1 +/1809 , DRG neurons exhibited 3.4-fold increased action potential firing rates relative to WT controls (Fig.\u00a0 5A, B  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 6A ). Moreover, both TTX and lamotrigine reduced neuronal hyperexcitability (\u2009>\u200985% reduction in action potential firing rate; Fig.\u00a0 5C, D ) relative to vehicle-treated controls. These results establish that  Nf1  mutation confers HCN channel activity-regulated sensory neuron hyperexcitability.

Based on our findings in the CNS, we hypothesized that PNS tumor (plexiform neurofibroma) growth is also dependent upon neuron activity-dependent paracrine factor secretion. Since neuronal trophic factors that mediate plexiform neurofibroma preneoplastic cell ( NF1  Schwann cells; sh \u2212/\u2212 NF1  SCs, Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 1A ) growth have not yet been identified, we leveraged hiPSC-derived sensory neurons that harbor heterozygous  NF1  mutations found in patients with (c.1149\u2009C\u2009\u2009>\u2009\u2009A, p.Cys381X; c.2041\u2009C\u2009\u2009>\u2009\u2009T, pArg681X; c.6619\u2009C\u2009\u2009>\u2009\u2009T, p.Gln2207X; Group 1) or without (c.5425\u2009C\u2009\u2009>\u2009\u2009T; p.Arg1809Cys; Group 2) neurofibromas (Fig.\u00a0 5E  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 5B, C ). As Schwann cells are the proliferative neoplastic cells in neurofibromas, their in vitro proliferation was used as a proof-of-principle measure of their potential to proliferate within a neurofibroma in vivo. We found that conditioned media (CM) from group 1, but from not group 2,  NF1 -mutant neurons increased preneoplastic sh NF1  Schwann cell proliferation (3.4\u20133.6-fold increase in Ki67 +  Schwann cells; Fig.\u00a0 5E  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 5D ). Leveraging these observations, we performed unbiased protein secretome analyses on CM from control, and representative sensory neurons from group 1 ( NF1 R681X ) and group 2 ( NF1 R1809C ; Fig.\u00a0 5F  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 6B, C ). The secreted proteins from both  NF1 -mutant neurons were compared to those of the controls and each differentially regulated protein was assigned an arbitrary identification number. From the 176 differentially regulated proteins, the expression of six proteins was uniquely increased more than 1.5-fold in the tumor-associated  NF1 R681X  CM but not in the non-tumor-associated  NF1 R1809C  CM relative to control CM (Fig.\u00a0 5F ). As a secondary validation, CM from independently generated sensory neurons was used to confirm the presence and concentration of the six identified proteins. Of these, only COL1A2 was elevated in the CM from the tumor-associated group 1, but not in the non-tumor-associated group 2, hiPSC-sensory neurons, as well as in mouse  Nf1 +/neo  but not  Nf1 +/1809  DRG neurons (2.4\u20133.2-fold increase; Fig.\u00a0 5G, H  and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 6D\u2013H ). Importantly, both  Nf1 +/neo  mouse DRG (Fig.\u00a0 5I ) and  NF1 R681X  hiPSC-sensory neuron CM (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 6I ) increased  Nf1 \u2212  DRG-NSCs (murine Schwann cell progenitors) proliferation (2-8\u20133.1-fold increase in %Ki67 / \u2212 +  cells) relative to control and  Nf1 +/1809  or  NF1 R1809C  neuron CM. Notably, COL1A2 was uniquely expressed by  NF1 -mutant PNS, but not CNS, neurons (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 6J ). COL1A2 is both necessary and sufficient for preneoplastic  NF1 -null Schwann cell proliferation in vitro To determine whether COL1A2 can increase  NF1 -deficient preneoplastic Schwann cell proliferation in vitro, human sh NF1  SCs and murine  Nf1  DRG NSCs were treated with COL1A2 at the concentration quantified in sensory neuron CM (12.5\u2009\u00b5g/mL). As such, COL1A2 treatment increased the proliferation of sh \u2212/\u2212 NF1  SCs and  Nf1  DRG NSCs (2.5\u20132.9-fold increase in Ki67 \u2212/\u2212 +  cells) to levels similar to  NF1 -mutant sensory neuron CM. The increase in proliferation conferred by  NF1 -mutant sensory neuron CM or COL1A2 alone was completely abrogated by neuron treatment with collagenase (Fig.\u00a0 6A ), as well as by genetic  COL1A2  short hairpin-mediated genetic reduction (sh COL1A2  1\u20133; 65.1% reduction, Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 6K, L  and Fig.\u00a0 6A ), or  Col1a2  (sh Col1a2  1\u20133 ;  70.2% reduction, Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 6M, N  and Fig.\u00a0 6A ). In addition, both human (Fig.\u00a0 6B ) and murine (Fig.\u00a0 6C ) cutaneous and plexiform neurofibromas exhibited strong COL1A2 immunoreactivity, in contrast to minimal expression in normal sural and sciatic nerves, lymph nodes, or brain. Similar to neuroligin-3 autocrine regulation of tumoral NLGN3 production , incubation of sh 22 \u2013 24 NF1  SCs and  Nf1  DRG NSCs with COL1A2 induced a feed-forward increase in  \u2212/ \u2212 COL1A2  transcript levels (Fig.\u00a0 6D ). This feed-forward induction suggests a paracrine effect of neuronal COL1A2 on preneoplastic Schwann cell  COL1A2  transcription. Consistent with these findings, Schwann cells isolated from human cNFs or pNFs express higher levels of  COL1A2  relative to non-neoplastic SCs (Fig.\u00a0 6E ). Together, these findings establish COL1A2 as a unique neuronal-secreted factor critical for pNF-associated\u00a0 NF1  neoplastic Schwann cell proliferation. \u2212/\u2212 Fig. 6 COL1A2 is necessary and sufficient for  NF1 -deficient Schwann cell growth in vitro.

COL1A2 secretion is neuronal activity-dependent To determine whether neuronal excitability similarly controls PNS mitogen secretion, we analyzed Col1a2 in CM from TTX- and lamotrigine-treated  Nf1 +/neo  DRG neurons. Similar to midkine in their CNS counterparts, both TTX and lamotrigine reduced  Nf1 +/neo  DRG neuronal Col1a2 secretion (3.6-, 1.8-fold reduction, respectively; Fig.\u00a0 7A, B ), while ZD7288 increased DRG Col1a2 secretion in WT and  Nf1 +/1809  DRG neurons (2\u20132.8-fold increase; Fig.\u00a0 7C ). In addition, RAS activity was higher in both  Nf1 +/neo  and  Nf1 +/1809  DRG neurons (2.1-fold increase, Fig.\u00a0 7D ). The increased RAS activity in  Nf1 +/neo  DRG neurons was reduced following neuronal activity inhibition either by TTX or lamotrigine exposure (2.5\u20132.7-fold decrease; Fig.\u00a0 7E ). In addition, RAS inhibition had no effect on DRG neuronal activity (Fig.\u00a0 7F, G ), but reduced COL1A2 expression both in mouse (4.5-fold reduction, Fig.\u00a0 7H ) and human (2.6-fold reduction; Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 6P ) sensory neurons, and decreased  Nf1 \u2212  DRG-NSC proliferation in vitro (Fig.\u00a0 / \u2212 7I ). These findings demonstrate that Col1a2 is secreted by tumor-associated  Nf1 +/neo  sensory neurons in an HCN channel activity-dependent manner. Fig. 7 Col1a2 secretion is regulated by HCN channel-regulated sensory neuron activity. A ,  B  TTX (1\u2009\u00b5M;  A ; vehicle  n \u2009=\u20096, TTX  n \u2009=\u20096;  P \u2009<\u20090.0001) and lamotrigine (LTR; 200\u2009\u00b5M;  B ; vehicle  n \u2009=\u20099, LTR  n \u2009=\u20099;  P \u2009=\u20090.0001) reduce  Nf1 +/neo  DRG neuron Col1a2 secretion by 73 and 47% relative to vehicle-treated controls.  C  ZD7288 (ZD; 30\u2009\u00b5M) increases Col1a2 secretion in WT ( n \u2009=\u200910 in both groups;  P \u2009<\u20090.0001) and  Nf1 +/1809  ( n \u2009=\u20094 in both groups;  P \u2009=\u20090.0103) DRG neurons.  D  RAS activity is increased in both  Nf1 +/neo  and  Nf1 +/1809  DRG neurons relative to controls ( n \u2009=\u20095 in all groups;  P \u2009<\u20090.0001), ( E ) and is inhibited following TTX and LTR treatment ( n \u2009=\u20096 in all groups;  P \u2009<\u20090.0001).  F ,  G  IN-1 has no effect on DRG neuronal activity, as measured by ( F ) multi-electrode array (vehicle  n \u2009=\u20096, IN-1  n \u2009=\u20093, ns not significant), or ( G ) calcium-imaging recordings (vehicle  n \u2009=\u200918, IN-1  n \u2009=\u200918; ns, not significant). Right: representative ( F ) spike plots of entire multi-electrode array well recordings over 30\u2009s, and ( G ) traces of neuronal activity over 3\u2009min.  H  IN-1 reduces Col1a2 secretion by 77.9% in  Nf1 +/neo  DRG neurons.  n \u2009=\u20096 for both groups,  P \u2009=\u20090.0001.

Gross images and representative immunostaining of mouse pNFs demonstrate that LTR treatment reduces pNF size, partly restores neuronal histology (H&E), reduces proliferation (Ki67 +  cells) and decreases Col1a2 production.

Finally, to determine whether HCN channel function can govern pNF progression in vivo, mice harboring NF1-pNFs received intraperitoneal injections of lamotrigine for 6 weeks. HCN activation reduced pNF size, partly restored neuronal histology, and reduced both proliferation (Ki67 +  cells), as well as Col1A2 immunoreactivity, within the tumors (Fig.\u00a0 7J ). Together, these data firmly establish that HCN channel-mediated sensory neuron Col1a2 production regulates pNF progression in vivo.",
  "discussion": "Discussion Exploiting a unique, naturally occurring germline mutation in patients with the NF1 tumor predisposition syndrome who fail to develop neurofibromas or optic gliomas (Arg1809Cys), we employed hiPSCs and genetically engineered mice to identify two distinct mechanisms underlying neuronal activity regulation of nervous system tumor progression (Fig.\u00a0 8 ). Fig. 8 Proposed model for  NF1  mutation-induced, neuronal hyperexcitability-regulated low-grade tumor growth. A  Tumor-associated  NF1 -mutant sensory neurons have increased baseline neuron excitability and deregulated HCN channel function, leading to elevated COL1A2 secretion. COL1A2, in turn, increases  NF1 \u2212/ \u2212  Schwann cell proliferation to stimulate pNF growth.  B  Tumor-associated  NF1- mutant retinal ganglion cell (RGC) activity is governed by two distinct mechanisms. First, visual experience (light)-induced activity enhances RGC production of soluble-Nlgn3 (s-Nlgn3), which drives OPG initiation and cell growth. Second, tumor-associated  NF1- mutant RGCs have increased intrinsic baseline neuronal hyperexcitability, which is controlled by HCN channel function. Increased baseline HCN channel-regulated RGC excitability triggers increased midkine production to induce a T-cell (Ccl4) and microglial (Ccl5) signaling cascade that governs OPG progression and growth. PNS, peripheral nervous system, CNS, central nervous system, pNF, plexiform neurofibroma, OPG, optic pathway glioma. Small elements of this schematic were designed on BioRender.com. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. In this study, and similar to what is observed in patients with NF1 , we first show that  40 , 44 , 45 Nf1 +/1809  mice do not form pNFs or OPGs. Consistent with the lack of tumor formation, Arg1809Cys-mutant neurons do not induce Adam10-mediated cleavage and shedding of Nlgn3, a growth factor required for murine  Nf1 -OPG initiation and growth . In addition, we previously described a neuron-immune-cancer cell axis 22 , where neurons indirectly regulate  7 Nf1 -OPG progression through their effects on T-cell Ccl4-mediated induction of microglial growth factor (Ccl5) production. Since  Nf1 +/1809  T cells produce Ccl4 in response to midkine and  Nf1 +/1809  microglia produce Ccl5 in response to Ccl4, the Arg1809Cys mutation appears to operate at the level of the neuron, such that human and mouse neurons with this mutation fail to increase midkine expression or activate optic glioma-infiltrating T cells to drive  Nf1 -OPG progression. Importantly, tumor initiation may also be influenced by the germline  Nf1  mutation acting on the tumor cells of origin , requiring investigations of the impact of the  51 NF1  Arg1809Cys mutation on third ventricle neural progenitors (OPG)  and Sox10 52 + , GAP43 +  Schwann cell precursors (neurofibroma) . 48 \u2013 50 , 53 Second, we identified COL1A2 as a sensory neuron-derived paracrine factor important for  NF1 -deficient Schwann cell proliferation. Of note, Schwann cells are the neoplastic cells of two distinct types of tumors, neurofibromas, and schwannomas, which differ both in pathology and immunohistochemical profiles. Specifically, neurofibromas, which occur both sporadically and in the setting of NF1, are heterogeneous tumors with small and wavy nuclei, excess \u201cshredded\u201d type collagen, and are immunopositive for neurofilament expression. In contrast, schwannomas arising either sporadically or in patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) and Schwannomatosis are encapsulated tumors with more homogeneous Schwann cell proliferation, larger nuclear sizes, and the presence of hyalinized vessels . The importance of collagen to neurofibroma-associated Schwann cell growth is underscored by the observation that collagen accounts for the majority of the extracellular matrix in human neurofibromas and as much as 50% of neurofibroma dry weight 54 . While type 1 collagens increase Schwann cell and Schwann cell progenitor adhesion, survival, and proliferation 55 , we show that  56 \u2013 58 NF1  mutation in human and mouse peripheral sensory neurons induces activity-dependent production of COL1A2, which, similar to NLGN3 in the brain , induces a feed-forward loop of  22 \u2013 24 COL1A2  transcription in Schwann cells and Schwann cell progenitors, resulting in elevated tumoral collagen levels. While the abundance of collagen and its production by other cell types (fibroblasts) in neurofibromas  prompted human clinical trials with broad-spectrum anti-fibrotic agents, like Pirfenidone, no efficacy was observed 11 , possibly due to the low abundance of collagen-synthesizing fibroblasts in pNFs 59 . Ongoing studies are focused on determining whether targeting of sensory neuron-specific COL1A2 production will reduce neurofibroma growth. 60 Third, examination of  NF1 +/1809  neurons revealed unique non-RAS functions for the  NF1  protein, neurofibromin. In this regard,  NF1 +/1809  neurons exhibit elevated RAS activity, similar to neurons with  NF1  mutations from patients who develop neurofibromas or optic gliomas. However,  Nf1 +/1809  neurons do not exhibit increased action potential firing rates necessary to drive Nlgn3 and midkine (retinal ganglion cells) or COL1A2 (sensory neurons) secretion. These findings uncouple RAS regulation from the control of baseline neuronal excitability, and suggest that other non-RAS-dependent mechanisms account for these neurofibromin-regulated effects in neurons. While there are a few examples of non-RAS-dependent functions for neurofibromin  additional studies will be necessary to determine whether the  37 , 47 , 61 \u2013 63 NF1  Arg1809Cys mutation, located within the PH-like domain of neurofibromin , affects the conformation of the protein relative to neurofibromin dimerization 64 , secondary structure 65 , or associations with other neurofibromin-binding partners in neurons 40 , 64 . 66 \u2013 68 Fourth, we demonstrate that  NF1  mutation regulates neuronal hyperexcitability intrinsically through HCN channel function, and this hyperexcitability is evident in visual experience-evoked activation. The finding of hyperexcitability parallels prior studies of  Nf1 +/neo  sensory neurons, which have greater numbers of action potentials, lower firing thresholds, lower rheobase currents, and shorter firing latencies . Herein, we demonstrate that baseline  69 NF1  regulation of neuronal hyperexcitability involves dysregulated HCN channel function (midkine, COL1A2 production) . HCN channels are voltage-operated cation channels expressed in RGC 37 . and DRG neurons 70 , 71 . Inhibition of HCN channel signaling with antagonists, such as ZD7288, increases neuron firing rates in vivo 71 \u2013 73 , paralleling the effects of HCN channel agonist (LTR) and antagonist (ZD7288) treatments on CNS and PNS neuron hyperexcitability and activity-dependent regulation of midkine and Col1a2 expression. Additionally, RGC hyperexcitability in the context of visual experience and consequent Adam10/Nlgn3 production are required for  74 Nf1 -OPG initiation, such that  Nf1 -optic glioma-prone mice do not develop tumors if reared in the dark during critical periods of tumorigenesis, or if  Nlgn3  is genetically or pharmacologically blocked . As light-induced activity did not affect RGC midkine expression and Adam10/Nlgn3 production was not dependent on HCN channel function, we postulate that  22 Nf1 -OPG initiation relies on light-mediated RGC activation and Nlgn3 shedding, whereas OPG progression requires both Nlgn3 shedding and HCN channel-regulated baseline neuronal activity and midkine production. Taken together, the findings reported herein advance our growing appreciation of neurons as active participants in tumor biology. While we conclusively establish that neuronal hyperexcitability drives mouse  Nf1  OPG and pNF progression, future work using genetically engineered mouse strains and ectopic gene delivery methods will be necessary to demonstrate that midkine and Col1a2 expression are solely sufficient to maintain murine OPG and pNF growth in vivo, respectively. Additional efforts will include the identification of key modulators of central and peripheral nervous system neuron-dependent tumorigenesis. This presents unique opportunities to repurpose FDA-approved compounds that target neuron-produced mitogens (e.g., collagenase ) or HCN channels (e.g., Lamotrigine; Ivabradine 75 ) for the treatment of NF1-associated nervous system tumors, expanding the toolbox for targeting neuron-low-grade tumor interactions in cancer. 76 , 77",
