  "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1-derived Schwann cells isolated from malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) overexpress PDGF receptor-\u03b2 and generate an aberrant intracellular calcium increase in response to PDGF-BB. Using the human MPNST Schwann cell line ST88-14, we demonstrate that, in addition to a transient phosphorylation of Akt, PDGF-BB stimulation produces an atypical sustained phosphorylation of Akt that is dependent on calcium and calmodulin (CaM). The sustained Akt phosphorylation did not occur in PDGF-BB-stimulated normal human Schwann cells or ST88-14 cells stimulated with stem cell factor, whose receptor is also overexpressed in ST88-14 cells. The sustained Akt phosphorylation induced by PDGF-BB was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with either the intracellular calcium chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl) ester (BAPTA-AM) or the CaM antagonist W7, whereas the transient portion was not inhibited. Akt also co-immunoprecipitated with CaM in a PDGF-BB-dependent manner, suggesting that direct interaction between Akt and CaM is involved in the sustained phosphorylation of Akt. Furthermore, we provide evidence that anti-apoptotic effects of PDGF-BB on serum-deprived ST88-14 cells can be inhibited by W7, implicating the PDGF-BB-induced activation of calcium/CaM in promoting cell survival, presumably through sustained Akt activation. We conclude that the activation of the calcium/CaM/Akt pathway resulting from stimulation of overexpressed PDGF receptor-\u03b2 may contribute to the survival and tumorigenicity of MPNST cells.",
