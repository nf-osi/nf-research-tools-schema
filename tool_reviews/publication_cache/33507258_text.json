  "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Understanding RAS dependency and mechanisms of RAS activation in non-V600 BRAF variant cancers has important clinical implications. This is the first study to date to systematically assess RAS dependency of BRAF alterations with real-world cancer genomic databases. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate RAS dependency of individual BRAF alterations through alteration coexistence analysis using cancer genomic databases. DESIGN AND SETTING: A cross-sectional data analysis of 119\u202f538 nonredundant cancer samples using cancer genomics databases including GENIE (Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange) and databases in cBioPortal including TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) (accessed March 24, 2020), in addition to 2745 cancer samples from Mayo Clinic Genomics Laboratory (January 1, 2015, to July 1, 2020). Frequencies and odds ratios of coexisting alterations of RAS (KRAS, NRAS and HRAS) and RAS regulatory genes (NF1, PTPN11 and CBL) were calculated for individual BRAF alterations, and compared according to the current BRAF alteration classification; cancer type specificity of coexisting alterations of RAS or RAS regulatory genes was also evaluated. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome measurement is enrichment of RAS (KRAS, NRAS and HRAS) alterations in BRAF variant cancers. Secondary outcome measurement is enrichment of RAS regulatory gene (NF1, PTPN11, and CBL) in BRAF variant cancers. RESULTS: A total of 2745 cancer samples from 2708 patients (female/male ratio: 1.0) tested by Mayo Clinic Genomics Laboratory and 119\u202f538 patients (female/male ratio: 1.1) from GENIE and cBioPortal database were included in the study. In 119\u202f538 nonredundant cancer samples, class 1 BRAF alterations and BRAF fusions were found to be mutually exclusive to alterations of RAS or RAS regulatory genes (odds ratio range 0.03-0.13 and 0.03-0.73 respectively), confirming their RAS independency. Both class 2 and class 3 BRAF alterations show variable and overlapping levels of enriched RAS alterations (odds ratio range: 0.03-5.9 and 0.63-2.52 respectively), suggesting heterogeneity in RAS dependency and a need to revisit BRAF alteration classification. For RAS-dependent BRAF alterations, the coexisting alterations also involve RAS regulatory genes by enrichment analysis (for example, S467L shows an odds ratio of 8.26 for NF1, 9.87 for PTPN11, and 15.23 for CBL) and occur in a variety of cancer types with some coalterations showing cancer type specificity (for example, HRAS variations account for 46.7% of all coexisting RAS alterations in BRAF variant bladder cancers, but 0% in non-small cell lung cancers). Variant-level assessment shows that BRAF alterations involving the same codon may differ in RAS dependency. In addition, RAS dependency of previously unclassified BRAF alterations could be assessed. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Current BRAF alteration classification based on in vitro assays does not accurately predict RAS dependency in vivo for non-V600 BRAF alterations. RAS-dependent BRAF variant cancers with different mechanisms of RAS activation suggest the need for different treatment strategies.",

  "methods": "Methods Targeted next generation sequencing data from 2745 cancer samples (lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and melanoma) that have undergone clinical testing at Mayo Clinic Genomics Laboratory from January 1, 2015, to July 1, 2020, were collected with ACE (Advanced Cohort Explorer). This study was approved by the institutional review board at Mayo Clinic Rochester. A waiver was granted by the institutional review board at Mayo Clinic Rochester because the study is a retrospective data analysis with deidentified data. In addition, targeted next generation sequencing data from 79\u2009720 samples from 75\u2009191 patients in GENIE database (v.7.0, public release: January 2020, access date: March 24, 2020), and 176 nonduplicate studies available in cBioPortal (access date: March 24, 2020)  including 46\u2009697 samples from 44\u2009347 patients were also collected. Both GENIE and cBioPortal databases are publicly available to the entire scientific community. We removed duplicated patients and only kept their earliest record, resulting in a total number of 119\u2009538 non-Mayo samples. We removed duplicate records and kept only the earliest record, resulting in a total number of 119\u2009538 non-Mayo samples. 9 , 10 Statistical Analysis To analyze the coexistence pattern of genes of interest ( KRAS ,  NRAS ,  HRAS ,  NF1 ,  PTPN11 ,  CBL ), distributions of samples based on  BRAF  alteration status ( BRAF altered  and  BRAF unaltered ) and alteration status of genes of interest were summarized in 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 contingency tables. The SNVs and indels, fusions (for  BRAF ), and copy number alterations ( RAS  amplification and  NF1  loss) were included in the analysis. Variants with less than 2 Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer counts were excluded as passenger alterations. Odds ratios (ORs) and frequencies of coalterations were calculated for individual  BRAF  alterations.  BRAF  alteration classification was based on previous studies.  The \u03c7 1 , 2 2  test was used with the 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 contingency tables to test whether alterations coexist or are mutually exclusive to each other. The 95% CIs of ORs were calculated as exp(ln(OR)\u00b11.96*SE(ln(OR))). Standard error SE(ln(OR)) was calculated as [(1/ A )\u2009+\u2009(1/ B )\u2009+\u2009(1/ C )\u2009+\u2009(1/ D )] 1/2 , where A, B, C, D are 4 numbers in the 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 contingency table. For contingency table with a value of 0, we applied Haldane-Anscombe correction by adding 0.05 to each cell and then calculated OR and its CI.  P  value was calculated through \u03c7 2  test for each contingency table. A  P \u2009<\u2009.05 was considered statistically significant. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology ( STROBE ) reporting guideline for cross-sectional studies as applicable.",

  "introduction": "Introduction BRAF  alterations have been classified into class 1, 2, and 3 based on dimer formation, enzyme activity, and  RAS  dependence from in vitro experiments.  Different classes of  1 , 2 BRAF  alterations differ in mechanism of action and require different treatment strategies.  Class 3 alterations are different from class 1 (V600) and class 2 (non-V600 activating alterations) in that they are  3 , 4 , 5 , 6 RAS -dependent with impaired kinase activity.  Class 2  1 , 2 BRAF  alterations were defined as  RAS  independent, and as activating  BRAF  alterations they are expected to be mutually exclusive to  RAS  alterations similar to class 1  BRAF  alterations. However, some class 2  BRAF  alterations were reported to coexist with  RAS  alterations.  In contrast, class 3  7 , 8 BRAF  variants, defined as  RAS  dependent, can be found without coexisting  RAS  alterations.  Variation coexistence analysis using cancer genomics database provides evidence for functional interactions between activated  7 , 8 RAS  and  BRAF  alterations, and thus can support in vivo  RAS  dependency or independency. However, such analysis requires a large cancer genomics database, and most published clinical studies are limited in size to systematically assess  RAS  dependency with real-world clinical data. Herein with 119\u2009538 nonredundant cancer samples in GENIE (Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange)  and cancer alteration databases in cBioPortal including TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) (accessed March 24, 2020), in addition to 2745 cancer samples sequenced at Mayo Clinic Genomics Laboratory (January 1, 2015, to July 1, 2020), we systematically assessed  5 RAS  dependence of  BRAF  alterations by examining their coexisting alterations of  RAS  and other  RAS  regulatory genes including  NF1 ,  PTPN11 , and  CBL . We aim to evaluate existing BRAF alteration classifications and understand the spectrum of coexisting alterations of  RAS  pathway genes and cancer types in which they occur. In addition, leveraging the size of the database, variant level assessment of  RAS  dependency can be performed for some previously unclassified  BRAF  alterations.",
  "results": "Results A total of 2745 cancer samples from 2708 patients (female/male ratio: 1.0) tested by Mayo Clinic Genomics Laboratory and 119\u2009538 patients (female/male ratio: 1.1) from GENIE and cBioPortal database were included in the study. Targeted gene alteration data from 2708 patients tested by Mayo Clinic Genomics Laboratory showed that both class 3 and class 2  BRAF  alterations have higher frequencies of coexisting  RAS  alterations than class 1 (10 of 38 [26.3%] for class 3, 4 of 22 [18.1%] for class 2, and 1 of 304 [0.3%] for class 1;  P \u2009<\u2009.001 by \u03c7 2  for both class 3 vs class 1 and class 2 vs class 1). The  Table  lists the  BRAF  alterations that coexist with  RAS  alterations among the Mayo Clinic tested patient cohort. Shown by large genomic database analysis using GENIE and cancer alteration databases in cBioPortal, 5767 cases harbored  BRAF  alterations, 3761 of which belong to class 1, 529 class 2, 651 class 3, and 282  BRAF  fusions, with the remaining unclassifiable. Among them, 138 (3.6%) cases with class 1  BRAF  alterations, 107 (20.2%) class 2, 212 (32.6%) class 3, and 8 (2.8%) cases with  BRAF  fusions harbor alterations in  RAS  or  RAS  regulatory genes. As shown in  Figure 1 , both  BRAF  class 1 alterations and fusions are mutually exclusive to coexisting  RAS  alterations ( P \u2009<\u2009.001 by \u03c7 2  for both; odds ratios range from 0.003-0.13 and 003-0.73, respectively) (eTable in the  Supplement ),  but class 2 and class 3 alterations show heterogeneous and overlapping levels of ORs for coexisting  2 , 11 RAS  alterations (odds ratio range: 0.03-5.9 and 0.63-2.52 respectively) ( Figure 1 A). Some class 2 alterations show high ORs of  RAS  coalteration supporting their RAS dependence (eg, p.E586K [OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.6-9.2] and p.F595L [OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.5-8.4]). Some class 3  BRAF  alterations (such as N581S) show lower OR (0.63) of coexisting  RAS  alterations than many class 2 alterations ( Figure 1 A-B and the eTable in the  Supplement ). Table.

Figure 1.  Summary of Coexisting Alterations of  RAS  and  RAS  Regulatory Genes for Individual  BRAF  Alterations A, Coalteration associations between  BRAF  alterations and  RAS  ( KRAS ,  NRAS , and  HRAS ) alterations. Individual dots represent different alterations in the class. Size of dots represents numbers of patients with this alteration. B, Coalteration associations between  BRAF  alterations and  RAS ,  NF1 ,  PTPN11 , and  CBL  alterations. Colors represent log2 odds ratio, and positive values were normalized to a \u22125 to 0 range, and negative values were normalized to a 0 to 5 range. For  BRAF  alterations showing  RAS  dependency, coalterations of  NF1 ,  PTPN11  and  CBL  also exist ( Figure 1 B), supporting a variety of mechanisms of  RAS  activation in these tumors. With the variant level assessment, our study suggests alterations involving the same codon may have different  RAS  dependency. For example, p.G469E shows much higher frequency of coalterations of  RAS  or  RAS  regulatory genes than p.G469A (20 of 34 [58.8%] vs 21 of 162 [13.0%];  P \u2009<\u2009.001 by \u03c7 2 ) ( Figure 1 B). In addition,  RAS  dependency manifested as enriched alterations of  RAS  or  RAS  regulatory genes is a common phenomenon in various types of tumors ( Figure 2 ), not limited to melanoma as previously suggested.  Relative cancer type-specific coalterations exist. While  2 KRAS  is the overall dominant gene that is coaltered,  HRAS  contributed to most coalteration cases in bladder cancer, and  NF1  coalteration preferably occurs in melanoma and endometrial cancer. In addition, our study assessed  RAS  dependency of previously unclassified alterations. For example, p.E501K (OR, 4.3; 95% CI, 1.9-10.0), p.S363F (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.0-12.0), p.R354Q (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.1-9.9), and p.E26D (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.2-5.1) show enriched coexisting  RAS  or  RAS  regulatory genes (eTable in the  Supplement ), suggesting that they are  RAS  dependent.

Colors reflect percentage of coalterations among all  BRAF  alterations within the cancer type.",
  "discussion": "Conclusions These findings suggest that there are different mechanisms of  RAS  activation for  RAS -dependent  BRAF  alterations in a wide variety of cancer types, including alterations of  RAS  genes and  RAS  regulatory genes. In addition, current  BRAF  alteration classification based on in vitro assays does not accurately predict  RAS  dependency in vivo for non-V600  BRAF  alterations.",
