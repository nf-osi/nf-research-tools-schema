  "title": "Nf2/Merlin controls spinal cord neural progenitor function in a Rac1/ErbB2-dependent manner.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Individuals with the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) cancer predisposition syndrome develop spinal cord glial tumors (ependymomas) that likely originate from neural progenitor cells. Whereas many spinal ependymomas exhibit indolent behavior, the only treatment option for clinically symptomatic tumors is surgery. In this regard, medical therapies are unfortunately lacking due to an incomplete understanding of the critical growth control pathways that govern the function of spinal cord (SC) neural progenitor cells (NPCs). METHODS: To identify potential therapeutic targets for these tumors, we leveraged primary mouse Nf2-deficient spinal cord neural progenitor cells. RESULTS: We demonstrate that the Nf2 protein, merlin, negatively regulates spinal neural progenitor cell survival and glial differentiation in an ErbB2-dependent manner, and that NF2-associated spinal ependymomas exhibit increased ErbB2 activation. Moreover, we show that Nf2-deficient SC NPC ErbB2 activation results from Rac1-mediated ErbB2 retention at the plasma membrane. SIGNIFICANCE: Collectively, these findings establish ErbB2 as a potential rational therapeutic target for NF2-associated spinal ependymoma.",

Materials and Methods Ethics Statement All mice were maintained in strict accordance with recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health and active animal studies protocols approved by the Animal Studies Committee at the Washington University School of Medicine (Protocol #20110111). All surgery was performed under isoflurane anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. All efforts were made to optimize experiments and reduce the number of animals used. Human spinal cord and ependymoma sections were obtained from St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital (Memphis TN) and the Washington University School of Medicine Tissue Procurement Core ( http://pathology.wustl.edu/research/cores/ltp/request.php ), and used under an Institutional Review Board approved Human Studies Protocol (#201103323) to comply with ethical standards as well as government and institutional regulations. No direct patient consent was necessary, as these specimens were de-identified. Mice \n Nf2 \n flox/flox  mice carrying a LoxP insertion in the  Nf2  gene  [13]  were maintained at the Washington University School of Medicine. Male and female embryos (E12.5) from mice maintained on a mixed C57BL/6 and FVB/N background were used for all experiments. Culture and Generation of  Nf2 \u2212/\u2212 Neurospheres Spinal cords dissected from E12.5 mouse  Nf2 \n flox/flox  embryos were used to generate NPCs as previously reported  [14] . Briefly, spinal cords were removed from embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) decidua of timed-pregnant females and processed to obtain single-cell suspension of neural progenitors (neurospheres). Dissected spinal cords were digested with trypsin digest buffer containing 0.2% BSA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 0.5 mg/ml DNase I (Sigma), and 10% trypsin-EDTA stock (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) in HBSS at 37\u00b0C for 15 min in a volume of 0.7 ml per litter. Equal volumes of 10% FBS medium containing 10% FBS (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) and low glucose DMEM/(Sigma) were added, and spinal cords were triturated with fire-polished Pasteur pipettes. Pelleted cells were washed with dissociation medium containing 15 mM HEPES (Sigma), 0.5% glucose in HBSS. Cells were finally resuspended in NSC medium containing a 5\u22363 mixture of DMEM low glucose: Neurobasal medium (Life Technologies), 0.5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM L-glutamine, 5 IU of penicillin, and 5 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 1% N2 supplement (Life Technologies), 2% B27 supplement (Life Technologies), 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Sigma), and 20 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Following infection with adenovirus containing either LacZ (wild-type (WT) NPCs) or Cre ( Nf2 \u2212/\u2212 NPCs), merlin expression was determined by Western blotting (6 days after adenovirus infection). NPC Assays Neurospheres were trypsinized (as described above) and plated into individual wells of ultralow-binding 24-well plates with complete NPC medium containing EGF and FGF. For assays in which the diameter and average number of neurospheres were measured, single neurospheres from WT and  Nf2\u2212/\u2212  NPCs were selected, trypsinized and individually plated into a single well of a 24-well plate. After 6 days, the size (diameter/cell growth) and number (clonogenic expansion) of the resulting secondary neurospheres was determined using Metamorph analysis software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale CA). Six wells per group per experiment were counted for these studies. For the proliferation assays, neurospheres from each group were trypsinized, 10 4  cells were seeded in triplicate, and the number of cells assessed by direct cell counting (at 4, 6, and 8 days). Three wells per group per experiment were counted for these studies. Apoptosis was determined by counting the percent of cleaved caspase-3 +  cells (1\u2236500 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly MA) or Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL; Roche, Indianapolis IN)-immunoreactive cells relative to the total number of DAPI (4\u2032, 6\u2032-diamidino-2-phenylindole)-positive cells. Pharmacologic inhibitor experiments used 10 4  cells per well (NSC23766, 10 \u00b5M; AG825, 10 \u00b5M; Sigma, St. Louis MO) for 6 days. All experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. Viral Transduction Murine stem cell virus (MSCV) infection was employed to express human WT or mutant (L64P patient mutation) merlin, mutant ErbB2 (V659E; Martine Roussel, St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital, Memphis TN), or dominant-negative Rac1 (Rac1 N17 ) as previously described  [15] . Mouse  Erbb2  (GenBank accession numbers  NM_001003817.1  and  XM_109715 .3-689) small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) lentiviral plasmids were obtained from the Washington University Genome Institute and generated as previously reported  [16] . PLKO virus was used as an empty vector control. Viruses used are listed in  Table S1 . Neurospheres were trypsinized and plated with complete NSC media (as described above) in ultralow-attachment 100 mm dishes (Corning, NY) and virus was added (MOI-10) at 37\u00b0C overnight. Cells were then pelleted, plated in fresh complete NSC media and allowed to grow for 6 days. Neurospheres were then trypsinized and infected with adenovirus (as described above), and allowed to grow for 6 days. Cells were then trypsinized and assays were established accordingly. Western Blotting Western blots were performed as previously described  [17] . Briefly, neurospheres (after 6 days in culture) were lysed in MAPK lysis buffer (20 mM Tris (pH 7.0), 10 mM EGTA, 400 mM B-glycerophosphate, 1% NP-40, 2.5 mM MgCl 2 , and 2 mM sodium orthovanadate with protease inhibitors (leupeptin, aprotinin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). For all experiments, 30 \u00b5g of protein per sample were loaded in each lane. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA) prior to detection with phospho-specific antibodies. Antibodies that detect the total expression of the corresponding signaling intermediate as well as \u03b1-tubulin were used as controls for equal protein loading and quantitation. Active Rac1 (Rac1-GTP) was determined by PAK1-PBD affinity chromatography (Rac1 activation Assay Kit, Millipore, Bedford MA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. Appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling, Beverly MA) were used for detection by enhanced chemiluminescence (New England Biolabs, Beverly MA). Antibodies used are listed in  Table S2 . Subcellular Fractionation Subcellular fractionation was performed as previously described  [18] . Briefly, following hypotonic (10 mM HEPES at pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM KCl, protease inhibitors) lysis, nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation, and supernatants were subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000\u00d7g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C to generate cytosolic and membrane fractions. Equal percentages of each fraction (10 \u00b5l per lane (200 \u00b5l of total volume)) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Immunohistochemistry and Immunocytochemistry Sections were treated with citrate antigen retrieval solution (10 mM, pH 6.0) and stained with pErbB2 (1\u223650 dilution) as previously described  [14] . Images were acquired on a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope (Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a Leica EC3 optical camera and Leica Application Suite 2.10 (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Immunocytochemistry was performed on trypsinized NPCs grown in 50 \u00b5g/mL poly-D-lysine-coated and 10 \u00b5g/mL fibronectin-coated 24-well plates containing defined medium (5\u22363 mixture of DMEM low glucose (Life Technologies): neurobasal medium (Life Technologies), 0.5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM L-glutamine, 5 IU penicillin, and 5 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies) supplemented with 1% N2 supplement (Life Technologies) and 2% B27 supplement (Life Technologies)) without growth factors. After 5 days in culture, cells were fixed and stained with appropriate primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight. For fluorescence detection, Alexa Fluor-tagged secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene OR) were used and cells were counterstained with DAPI. Statistical Analysis Statistical significance (p<0.05) was determined using the appropriate test as described in figure legends using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad Inc., La Jolla CA).",
