  "abstract": "The carbon and nitrogen components of glutamine are used for multiple biosynthetic processes by tumors. Glutamine metabolism and the therapeutic potential of glutamine antagonists (GA), however, are incompletely understood in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), an aggressive soft tissue sarcoma observed in patients with neurofibromatosis type I. We investigated glutamine dependence of MPNST using JHU395, a novel orally bioavailable GA prodrug designed to circulate inert in plasma, but permeate and release active GA within target tissues. Human MPNST cells, compared with Schwann cells derived from healthy peripheral nerve, were selectively susceptible to both glutamine deprivation and GA dose-dependent growth inhibition.",
