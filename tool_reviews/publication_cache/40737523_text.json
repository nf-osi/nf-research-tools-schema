  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Accurate monitoring of tumor progression is crucial for optimizing outcomes in neurofibromatosis type 2-related schwannomatosis. Standard 2D linear analysis on magnetic resonance imaging is less accurate than 3D volumetric analysis, but since 3D volumetric analysis is time-consuming, it is not widely used. To shorten the time required for 3D volumetric analysis, our lab has been developing an automated artificial intelligence-driven 3D volumetric tool. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to survey and interview clinicians treating neurofibromatosis type 2-related schwannomatosis to understand their views on current 2D analysis and to gather insights for the design of an artificial intelligence-driven 3D volumetric analysis tool. METHODS: Interviews examined for the following themes: (1) shortcomings of the currently used linear analysis, (2) utility of 3D visualizations, (3) features of an interactive 3D modeling software, and (4) lack of a gold standard to assess the accuracy of 3D volumetric analysis. A Likert scale questionnaire was used to survey clinicians' levels of agreement with 25 statements related to 2D and 3D tumor analyses. RESULTS: A total of 14 clinicians completed a survey, and 12 clinicians were interviewed. Specialties ranged across neurosurgery, neuroradiology, neurology, oncology, and pediatrics. Overall, clinicians expressed concerns with current linear techniques, with clinicians agreeing that linear measurements can be variable with the possibility of two different clinicians calculating 2 different tumor sizes (mean 4.64, SD 0.49) and that volumetric measurements would be more helpful for determining clearer thresholds of tumor growth (mean 4.50, SD 0.52). For statements discussing the capabilities of a 3D volumetric analysis and visualization software, clinicians expressed strong interest in being able to visualize tumors with respect to critical brain structures (mean 4.36, SD 0.74) and in forecasting tumor growth (mean 4.77, SD 0.44). CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians were overall in favor of the adoption of 3D volumetric analysis techniques for measuring vestibular schwannoma tumors but expressed concerns regarding the novelty and inexperience surrounding these techniques. However, clinicians felt that the ability to visualize tumors with reference to critical structures, to overlay structures, to interact with 3D models, and to visualize areas of slow versus rapid growth in 3D would be valuable contributions to clinical practice. Overall, clinicians provided valuable insights for designing a 3D volumetric analysis tool for vestibular schwannoma tumor growth. These findings may also apply to other central nervous system tumors, offering broader utility in tumor growth assessments.",

A Likert scale questionnaire was used to survey clinicians\u2019 levels of agreement with 25 statements related to 2D and 3D tumor analyses. Methods Study Sample This study involved surveys and interviews with clinicians specializing in the treatment and diagnosis of NF2-related schwannomatosis. To be eligible for inclusion, participants had to be clinicians directly involved in the care of NF2-SWN patients and willing to complete a survey or participate in an interview. NF2-SWN patients were not included, as the software is intended primarily as a clinical tool rather than a visualization tool for patients. Clinicians with direct experience in diagnosing and treating NF2-SWN across various specialties, including neurology, neuro-oncology, neurosurgery, neuroradiology, and pediatrics, whose names were found on the Children\u2019s Tumor Foundation website were recruited for this study. Upon identifying clinicians\u2019 names and contact information, emails were subsequently sent to these clinicians, outlining the proposed 3D segmentation software and inviting them to participate in a survey and an interview. Ethical Considerations Ethics approval was obtained from the Yale University Institutional Review Board (approval number: 2000034426) through an exempt review. Verbal informed consent was obtained from all interviewed and surveyed participants before the collection of data, and the institutional review board waived the need for written consent. The clinicians providing the data were deidentified but were not anonymous. No vulnerable populations were included in the data collection of this study. Additional consent was not necessary for any secondary analyses of the collected data. No compensation was provided for participation in this study. Survey Data Collection and Analysis Surveys were conducted via Qualtrics and included 25 statements organized into eight categories as follows: (1) linear/volumetric analysis, (2) markers of VS tumor progression, (3) surgical planning for 2D MRI scans of VS tumors, (4) 3D volumetric analysis, (5) 3D visualization of VS tumors, (6) surgical planning using 3D models of VS tumors, (7) postintervention monitoring, and (8) general questions ( Textbox 1 ). The survey questions were structured as a Likert scale questionnaire, where clinicians indicated their level of agreement with each statement on a scale of 1 to 5, ranging from \u201ccompletely disagree\u201d to \u201ccompletely agree.\u201d Additionally, clinicians were asked demographic questions about their clinical specialties, years of experience, and the number of VS cases they had treated. Textbox 1. A total of 25 total statements were addressed in both the interviews and in the questionnaire. In the surveys, all clinicians selected 1 out of 5 choices based on how much they agreed with each statement. In the interviews, clinicians had the opportunity to share open-ended responses to the statements. \n Category 1: 2D linear/volumetric analysis \n 1. Linear analysis of vestibular schwannoma (VS) tumors reflects tumor size 2. Volumetric analysis of tumors reflects tumor size 3. Linear measurements are sensitive to small changes in tumor diameter 4. Two different clinicians can review the same magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but calculate two different tumor sizes. 5. The orientations of bi- and uni-dimensional linear measurements can change from one MRI to the next for a single patient. 6. Patient position in MRI machines influences the orientations of MRI scans, affecting linear measurements. 7. It can be difficult to make a decision about tumor growth from a series of linear measurements due to the lack of clear progression thresholds. \n Category 2: markers of VS tumor progression \n 8. Change in tumor size is the most important marker of VS tumor progression 9. Edema and mass effects on surrounding critical structures are good markers of VS tumor progression. \n Category 3: surgical planning with 2D MRI scans of VS tumors \n 10. It is simple to determine the best approach to tumor resection before operation (location or angle of entry, how to best maximize extent of resection while avoiding functional areas) from 2D MRI scans. 11. The cranial nerves and blood vessels that need to be avoided during intervention can easily be determined through analysis of MRI scans. \n Category 4: 3D volumetric analysis \n 12. 3D volumetric measurements would be more helpful in determining clearer thresholds of tumor growth than linear measurements.  13. 3D volumetric analysis would standardize measurements by reducing variation in measurements of tumor size taken by different clinicians.  14. 3D volumetric analysis would lead to more informed clinical decision-making. \n Category 5: 3D visualization of VS tumors \n 15. 3D volumetric measurements must be combined with 3D visualization of the VS tumor to be clinically meaningful. 16. The ability to interact with 3D models of VS tumors in the cerebral space (rotate, zoom, adding or removing structures from view) would provide information helpful for surgical planning. 17. Growth in tumor boundaries observed by overlaying 3D models of VS tumors from MRI scans collected over time is easier to interpret than comparing the same MRI scans in 2D. 18. 3D visualization of VS tumors and their location relative to critical brain structures (cranial nerves, brainstem, etc.) would be helpful in patient care. 19. Knowing regions of rapid versus slow tumor growth on VS tumors would be helpful in treatment planning. \n Category 6: surgical planning with 3D models of VS tumors \n 20. 3D visualization of VS tumors in the surrounding cerebral space (relative to critical brain structures) would aid in surgical planning. 21. 3D models of VS tumors would lead to more informed decisions of the type of intervention to perform (eg, different approaches of tumor resection and gamma knife) \n Category 7: postintervention monitoring \n 22. Being able to distinguish between post-op changes and residual tumor progression would significantly improve clinical decision-making (ex. After gamma knife). 23. Automatic diagnosis of tumor progress, regression/response, or stability according to changes in size over time would aid treatment planning. \n Category 8: general \n 24. Having the ability to forecast tumor growth will significantly improve clinical decision-making. 25. 3D visualizations of VS tumors would significantly improve patient education by allowing patients to see their tumors in 3D space. In the end, individual survey statement responses were statistically analyzed and means and SD were reported. Higher means indicated that clinicians agreed more with the statement. Following statistical analysis, survey statements relating to tangible features or capabilities of the software were grouped together, and the top four features that clinicians favored based on mean agreement levels were determined. Interview Data Collection and Analysis Two members of the research team (AH and DW) with prior training in conducting semistructured interviews and focus groups jointly facilitated each focus group discussion (FGD) session; the senior author (FB) conducted all the individual interviews. The topics discussed within these discussions mirrored the 25 survey statements reframed as open-ended questions ( Textbox 1 ). The FGD sessions lasted approximately one hour, and the individual interviews lasted approximately 30 minutes. Audio recordings from the FGDs and individual interviews were then transcribed verbatim by Zoom\u2019s transcription feature and returned to the research team for proofreading and subsequent analysis. The data analysis team (AH, DW, and FB) met regularly to develop the codebook and note potential emergent themes. Interview sessions and data analysis continued simultaneously and iteratively until the team determined that data saturation had been reached [ 17 ]. Beginning with an initial set of codes derived from the domains included in the Interview Guide, the coding team members independently coded each transcript to identify potential additional codes. The team then discussed the merits of each existing or new code and created definitions for each for inclusion in the final version of the codebook. The codes were inductively developed, grounded in the data, iteratively reviewed, and revised based on the team\u2019s discussion of additional independently coded transcripts. The total interobserver agreement of the reviewers was assessed over the course of the reviews. The overall total interobserver agreement was 92% across the study. The codes assigned to each quote were then reviewed for a final time by the first author as part of entering the coded transcripts using Dedoose. Using thematic analysis, the team identified patterns across the entire data set to arrive at a final, parsimonious set of themes. The analysis also examined the data for any \u201cnegative\u201d instances where the data did not fit the domains or themes or where no information on specific topics queried was obtained. In addition to the qualitative analysis, descriptive statistics were generated to describe the study sample.",
