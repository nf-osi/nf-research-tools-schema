  "title": "Oscillatory motor patterning is impaired in neurofibromatosis type 1: a behavioural, EEG and fMRI study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type1 (NF1) is associated with a broad range of behavioural deficits, and an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission has been postulated in this disorder. Inhibition is involved in the control of frequency and stability of motor rhythms. Therefore, we aimed to explore the link between behavioural motor control, brain rhythms and brain activity, as assessed by EEG and fMRI in NF1. METHODS: We studied a cohort of 21 participants with NF1 and 20 age- and gender-matched healthy controls, with a finger-tapping task requiring pacing at distinct frequencies during EEG and fMRI scans. RESULTS: We found that task performance was significantly different between NF1 and controls, the latter showing higher tapping time precision. The time-frequency patterns at the beta sub-band (20-26\u00a0Hz) mirrored the behavioural modulations, with similar cyclic synchronization/desynchronization patterns for both groups. fMRI results showed a higher recruitment of the extrapyramidal motor system (putamen, cerebellum and red nucleus) in the control group during the fastest pacing condition. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated impaired precision in rhythmic pacing behaviour in NF1 as compared with controls. We found a decreased recruitment of the cerebellum, a structure where inhibitory interneurons are essential regulators of rhythmic synchronization, and in deep brain regions pivotally involved in motor pacing. Our findings shed light into the neural underpinnings of motor timing deficits in NF1.",

  "methods": "Methods We studied a cohort of 21 participants with NF1 and 20 age- and gender-matched healthy controls, with a finger-tapping task requiring pacing at distinct frequencies during EEG and fMRI scans. Methods Subjects Twenty-one adults with NF1 were recruited from a database used in previous studies [ 19 ] and in collaboration with the Portuguese Association of Neurofibromatosis. They all had a definite diagnosis of NF1 in accordance with the criteria of the National Institutes of Health (National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference, 1988). The control group (20 age- and gender-matched participants) was recruited via advertisement in the local community. Exclusion criteria for all participants included psychiatric disorders, neurologic illness affecting brain function other than NF1, brain tumor burden, intelligence quotient (IQ) lower than 75, epilepsy and traumatic brain injury. One control was excluded due to neurological illness. None of the NF1 patients were diagnosed with ADHD or had a formal diagnosis of learning disabilities. None of the participants were taking medication for treating anxiety or depression in the year before the study, and none of them were ever medicated with anticonvulsants. All the participants but one were right-handed as assessed by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory [ 29 ] and had normal or corrected to normal visual acuity. Intellectual function was assessed by using the Portuguese-adapted version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-3rd edition (WAIS-III) [ 30 ]. Two control participants were unavailable to complete the IQ assessment. Full-scale IQ values were in the normal range for the NF1 patients (mean IQ\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD 104.4\u2009\u00b1\u200913.7). All the participants performed the standard Stroop Colour and Word Test [ 31 ] composed by two congruent conditions [word (W) and colour (C)] and one incongruent (interference) condition [colour-word (CW)]. Participants had 45\u00a0s to complete each task condition. An Interference Index was calculated according to the method proposed by Golden [ 31 ]: incongruent score (IG)\u2009=\u2009CW\u2009\u2212\u2009[(W\u2009\u00d7\u2009C)/(W\u2009+\u2009C)]. Groups did not differ regarding this index (independent-samples  t  tests,  p \u2009>\u2009.05), indicating similar ability to control over the interference effect. Three participants were excluded from the EEG analysis. One due to a malfunction in the trigger recording system and two due to differences in the cap system (ground positioning and channel locations). Two participants exceeded the limits of movement during the functional magnetic resonance (3\u00a0mm in, at least, one axis), and thus were excluded from that analysis. Our final sample for the EEG analysis was composed of 19 patients with NF1 and 19 controls. The clinical group ( n \u2009=\u200919, 10 females, age range 23.8\u201351.8, mean age\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation [SD] 36.1\u2009\u00b1\u20096.7) and the control group ( n \u2009=\u200919, 11 females, age range 22.5\u201355.0, mean age\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD 37.1\u2009\u00b1\u20097.2) were matched for age ( U \u2009=\u2009160.0,  p \u2009=\u20090.549) and gender ( \u03c7 2  (1)\u2009=\u2009.106,  p \u2009=\u20090.744). The final sample for the fMRI analysis was composed of 19 patients with NF1 and 20 controls. The clinical group ( n \u2009=\u200919, 11 females, age range 23.8\u201351.8, mean age\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation [SD] 36.5\u2009\u00b1\u20097.0) and the control group ( n \u2009=\u200920, 12 females, age range 22.5\u201355.0, mean age\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD 36.8\u2009\u00b1\u20097.1) were matched for age ( U \u2009=\u2009182.5,  p \u2009=\u20090.833) and gender ( \u03c7 2  (1)\u2009=\u2009.018,  p \u2009=\u20090.894). Task Participants performed a previously validated audio-paced tapping paradigm [ 26 ] at three incremental frequencies (1, 3 and 5\u00a0Hz). Participants were asked to tap using both index fingers either simultaneously (\u201csynchronous\u201d condition) or alternating the tapping (\u201calternating\u201d or \u201casynchronous\u201d condition) as prompted by a cue shown in a computer screen (\u201cA\u201d for the alternating condition and an \u201cS\u201d for the synchronous condition). All participants were familiarized with the task and the interface before the beginning of the recording sessions. The paradigm was designed and presented using the Psychophysics Toolbox 3 [ 32 ,  33 ], running on Matlab R2013b (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). For the fMRI task, a total of 24 blocks of the motor paradigm, 8 per frequency (4 synchronous and 4 alternating), were presented. Block duration was 9\u00a0s either for the finger tapping or for the baseline. The cues were presented in a 698.40\u2009\u00d7\u2009392.85\u00a0mm LCD monitor (NordicNeuroLab, Bergen, Norway), placed ~\u2009156\u00a0cm away from the participants\u2019 head. Audio was provided through MR-compatible headphones. Behavioural data (tapping timings) were recorded using the MRI-compatible response box Lumina LP-400 (Cedrus Corporation, San Pedro, CA, USA). Regarding the EEG acquisition, we acquired four runs, each composed of five repetitions of the main sequence (1, 3 and 5\u00a0Hz, each frequency executed in two variations, synchronous and alternating). Blocks lasted 12\u00a0s and were composed by a baseline period of 3\u00a0s (where the participant fixated the central cross and did not execute any movements) and 9\u00a0s of task (see Fig.\u00a0 1 ). The cueing paradigm was presented in a laptop placed ~\u200950\u00a0cm in front of the participant. Participants were instructed to fixate the centre of the screen during the EEG task, and behavioural data were recorded using the \u201cZ\u201d and \u201cM\u201d buttons of a common keyboard. Fig. 1 Experimental design of the behavioural task during the EEG task (concerning the fMRI design, see text). The participants were instructed to make an audio-paced tapping using both index fingers, synchronously or alternately, as indicated by the visual cue. The tapping frequency was set at 1, 3 or 5\u00a0Hz, and it was set by a beep MR recordings and analysis MR scans were acquired in a 3T Magnetom Tim Trio scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany), using a 12-channel birdcage head coil. A T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo sequence was acquired with a repetition time of 2530\u00a0ms, echo time of 3.42\u00a0ms, resolution of 1\u00a0mm 3  isotropic voxel, flip angle of 7\u00b0, matrix size 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256 and a field of view of 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256\u00a0mm. Functional data were acquired using echo-planar imaging sequences, using voxel size 3\u00a0mm 2  and slice thickness of 3\u00a0mm, no gap between slices, 43 slices acquired parallel to the anterior commissure-posterior commissure line, repetition time 3000\u00a0ms, echo time 30\u00a0ms, flip angle of 90\u00b0, matrix size 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256 and a field of view of 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256\u00a0mm. In total, 147 volumes were acquired. A T2-weighted fluid attenuation inversion recovery sequence was used to identify unidentified bright objects, and it was acquired using a 1\u00a0mm 3  voxel, repetition time 5\u00a0s, echo time 388\u00a0ms, inversion time 1.8\u00a0s, field of view 250\u2009\u00d7\u2009250\u00a0mm, matrix size 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256 and160 slices. The complete processing pipeline and analysis of the functional data was done using BrainVoyager QX 2.8.2 (Brain Innovation, Maastricht, The Netherlands). Data were corrected for (1) slice scanning time differences using cubic spline interpolation, (2) motion artifacts by combining trilinear and sinc function based methods for interpolation in the three axes and (3) filtered in the time domain using an approach with Fourier basis set using 2\u00a0cycles per time course. Functional data were automatically co-registered to the anatomical T1 (and manually verified) and subsequently normalized to the Talairach atlas. Spatial smoothing was applied using a Gaussian kernel with a full width at half maximum of 6\u00a0mm. Statistical analyses were performed at the group level using a general linear model approach. The predictor\u2019s model was obtained by convolution of the boxcar function with a standard 2-gamma hemodynamic response function. Motion parameters were also included in the model as regressors of no interest. Random effects analysis (RFX) was performed, and the results were corrected for multiple comparisons using false discovery rate (FDR) with a fixed  p  value of 0.05 and minimum cluster extension of 20 voxels. EEG recordings and analysis Electroencephalographic signals were recorded using a 64 electrodes cap (QuickCap, NeuroScan, USA) with electrodes placed according to the extended 10/20 system. In order to ensure the quality of the signal, all electrode impedances were kept below 20\u00a0k\u03a9. The continuous signal was amplified and recorded at a sampling rate of 1\u00a0kHz, low pass filter at 200\u00a0Hz, through a SynAmps2/RT amplifier. Data were acquired using Scan 4.5 (NeuroScan, Compumedics, Charlotte, NC), and the acquisition reference was set to an electrode located at a half distance between CZ and FCZ. The processing was performed using the EEGlab toolbox [ 34 ] for Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA). The EEG signal was downsampled to 400\u00a0Hz and digitally filtered between 1 and 100\u00a0Hz. A notch filter (47.5\u201352.5\u00a0Hz) was applied, and epochs from \u2212\u20093000 to 9000\u00a0ms were obtained locked to the stimuli onset. Epoch rejection was done automatically by scanning the entire dataset using a rejection threshold of 120\u00a0\u03bcV for all electrodes followed by visual inspection to ensure the data was free from artifacts. Channels with abnormal noise activity were interpolated using spherical spline interpolation. The HEO/VEO channels were excluded from further analysis, and the recordings were re-referenced to the average of all remaining channels. We proceeded to epoch division by trigger data, i.e. we separated the time-frequency epochs by sub-task type (1, 3 and 5\u00a0Hz tapping, synchronous and alternated). All the participants met the minimum criterion (more than 40%) of the trials per condition available for analysis. Time-frequency decomposition was done using the function  pop_newtimef() , with Morlet wavelet, beginning with a 7-cycle at 6\u00a0Hz and increasing linearly with frequency (maximum of 30\u00a0cycles at 50\u00a0Hz). We calculated 400 timepoints (with an effective time window from \u2212\u20092600 to 6080\u00a0ms) and set the baseline from the beginning of the epoch until 100\u00a0ms before the onset of the stimulus. Electrodes corresponding to motor areas were clustered (FC1, FC2, CZ, C1, C3, C2 and C4). We truncated the time analysis intervals (from \u2212\u20092000 to 6000\u00a0ms) in order to avoid boundary effects on time-frequency spectra. Further analysis was performed in the time-course variation for three sub-bands of mu, beta and gamma frequencies (respectively, 8\u201312, 20\u201326 and 40\u201344\u00a0Hz intervals). Beta range (20\u201326\u00a0Hz range) was defined around the desynchronization peak that matches the motor pattern. The choice of the interval of low gamma was based on our previous work [ 35 \u2013 37 ] and was set up to 44\u00a0Hz to avoid power line interferences in the time-frequency analysis. The bands were not juxtaposed, in order to avoid information contamination between bands. Frequency-domain evaluations were performed specifically for beta sub-band variations, since they exhibit a marked sinusoidal profile, matching motor responses. For that, we computed the power per subject at the exact frequency of tapping. Statistics for group comparisons Measurements of motor performance were done in data recorded during EEG recordings because larger amounts of data could be recorded. The statistical comparison between groups was performed using one-way multivariate ANOVAs (MANOVAs) to determine whether there are any differences between the independent variable (group) based on the dependent continuous variables (tapping at three different frequencies: 1, 3 and 5\u00a0Hz), for synchronous and asynchronous conditions. Similarly, we used MANOVA to test group differences on EEG data.

  "introduction": "Background Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the most common autosomal dominant neurogenetic condition with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 3000 individuals [ 1 \u2013 3 ]. The disorder is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene that encodes neurofibromin. This protein is involved in cell proliferation and differentiation [ 4 ], and its loss may explain abnormalities in the brain structure, which include increased volume of the cortical and subcortical structures, and white and gray matter abnormalities [ 5 \u2013 9 ]. Behavioural difficulties are also frequent and encompass a wide range of cognitive deficits, which include perceptual impairments, attention and learning disabilities [ 10 \u2013 12 ]. Moreover, there is a tendency for those symptoms to persist or even increase in severity with age [ 2 ]. Motor skill and time perception impairments have been reported in NF1 children [ 13 ]. Debrabant and colleagues [ 14 ] studied temporal perception (motor timing indexed by the reaction time decrease upon presentation of predictable stimuli). They found that the clinical group responded with an increased reaction time to such temporally predictable stimuli (as defined by regular interstimulus intervals) when compared to typically developing children [ 14 ]. Accordingly, a comprehensive study by Hyman on motor and cognitive function in NF1 showed that fine motor coordination deficits and slowing of motor speed were present in approximately 20 and 30% of the NF1 cohort, respectively [ 10 ]. Using a more broad motor performance test battery, Rietman and colleagues found that 61% of the studied cohort had motor problems [ 15 ]. Although knowledge on the cognitive and behavioural deficits in NF1 is increasing, the neural mechanisms underlying such impairments are still poorly understood. Previous studies addressing other cognitive domains have proposed that abnormalities in the balance of the excitatory and the inhibitory activity underlie a basic disease mechanism. Initial studies in mouse models of NF1 indicated that lack of neurofibromin causes increased GABA (\u03b3-aminobutyric acid)-mediated neurotransmission and showed a relationship between enhanced inhibitory activity and behavioural profile [ 16 \u2013 18 ]. However, studies in human patients have shown a pattern of GABA alterations that include reduced GABA levels and GABA A  receptor density [ 19 \u2013 21 ]. In order to reconcile these differences across species, a recent study investigated pre- and post-synaptic GABA levels in an NF1 mouse model employing magnetic resonance spectroscopy (the only technique available to measure GABA levels in vivo in humans) combined with molecular approaches [ 22 ]. This study showed that the pattern of GABA alterations in mice is region specific and that this pattern is not always consistent across species. Thus, although mutations in the NF1 gene do seem to impact the GABA system and those can have behavioural and cognitive consequences [ 21 ], their pattern across species and brain regions do\u00a0not seem to be trivial. Importantly, lower GABA levels may still be consistent with enhanced inhibitory activity. This is the case for example in the hippocampus, where low GABA levels coexist with very high post-synaptic receptor density [ 22 ] and increased inhibitory post-synaptic potentials [ 18 ]. Here, we hypothesized that rhythmic taping performance is impaired in NF1 and that it is related to abnormal physiology and brain activity patterns. Inhibition is involved in the function of motor central pattern generators\u2014neuronal circuits that when activated can produce rhythmic motor patterns [ 23 ]\u2014and in the control of frequency and stability of motor rhythms [ 24 ,  25 ]. We therefore aimed to explore the link between behavioural control of motor rhythms, brain oscillations and brain activity in regions involved in motor pacing. To reach that goal, we choose a finger-tapping task so we can precisely measure the participant\u2019s performance either during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or electroencephalography (EEG). We used synchronous and asynchronous finger-tapping tasks. The latter requires alternated finger tapping, which implies interhemispheric inhibitory control, in contrast with the synchronous variant. In both synchronous and asynchronous conditions, finger tapping was performed in incremental rates, 1, 3 and 5\u00a0Hz, to vary the performance load. The latter frequency has been shown to be the most discriminative of disease states in cerebellar disorders (in particular genetic ataxias) where rhythmic motor control is impaired [ 26 ]. We hypothesized that the NF1 cohort would perform worse at rhythmic pacing than the healthy group, and we aimed to identify the neural correlates of such impaired temporal patterning. Since oscillatory pacing can be related to the modulation of populations of inhibitory interneurons [ 27 ,  28 ], we expected that behavioural differences would be reflected in the power of the beta band. We used the same pacing paradigm during functional scans to induce effects in the BOLD (blood-oxygen-level dependent) signal in motor-related areas during task performance. We aimed to unravel the neural underpinnings of abnormal motor coordination.",
