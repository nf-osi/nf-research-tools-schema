  "title": "Loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 22 in ovarian carcinoma is distal to and is not accompanied by mutations in NF2 at 22q12.",
  "abstract": "Frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) has been reported on 22q in ovarian carcinoma, implying the presence of a tumour-suppressor gene. The neurofibromatosis type 2 gene (NF2) at 22q12 is a plausible candidate. Analysis of 9 of the 17 exons of NF2 by single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) in 67 ovarian carcinomas did not detect any somatic mutations, suggesting that NF2 is not involved in the pathogenesis of ovarian carcinoma. LOH data support this conclusion and that the putative tumour-suppressor gene lies distal to NF2, beyond D22S283.",
