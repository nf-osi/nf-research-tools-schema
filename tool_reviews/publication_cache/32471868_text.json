Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common cancer predisposition syndrome caused  by mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene. NF1 encodes neurofibromin, a  GTPase-activating protein for RAS proto-oncogene GTPase (RAS). Plexiform  neurofibromas are a hallmark of NF1 and result from loss of heterozygosity of  NF1 in Schwann cells, leading to constitutively activated p21RAS. Given the  inability to target p21RAS directly, here we performed an shRNA library screen  of all human kinases and Rho-GTPases in a patient-derived NF1-/- Schwann cell  line to identify novel therapeutic targets to disrupt PN formation and  progression. Rho family members, including Rac family small GTPase 1 (RAC1),  were identified as candidates. Corroborating these findings, we observed that  shRNA-mediated knockdown of RAC1 reduces cell proliferation and phosphorylation  of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in NF1-/- Schwann cells.  Genetically engineered Nf1flox/flox;PostnCre+ mice, which develop multiple PNs,  also exhibited increased RAC1-GTP and phospho-ERK levels compared with  Nf1flox/flox;PostnCre- littermates. Notably, mice in which both Nf1 and Rac1  loci were disrupted (Nf1flox/floxRac1flox/flox;PostnCre+) were completely free  of tumors and had normal phospho-ERK activity compared with Nf1flox/flox  ;PostnCre+ mice. We conclude that the RAC1-GTPase is a key downstream node of  RAS and that genetic disruption of the Rac1 allele completely prevents PN tumor  formation in vivo in mice.  © 2020 Mund et al.
