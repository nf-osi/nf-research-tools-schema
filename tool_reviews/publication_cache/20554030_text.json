Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine, St.  Louis, MO 63110, USA.  Tumorigenesis requires interactions between tumor progenitors and their  microenvironment. We found that low cAMP levels were sufficient for  tumorigenesis in a mouse model of Neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1)-associated optic  pathway glioma (OPG). We hypothesized that the distinct pattern of glioma in NF1  reflected spatiotemporal differences in CXCL12 effects on cAMP levels. Thus, we  sought to alter the pattern of gliomagenesis through manipulation of  CXCL12-CXCR4 pathway activation in Nf1 OPG mice. Forced CXCL12 expression  induced glioma at a low frequency. Further, treatment of Nf1 OPG mice with  AMD3100, a CXCR4 antagonist, did not attenuate glioma growth. Thus, it appears,  CXCL12 alone cannot promote gliomagenesis in NF1 mice.
