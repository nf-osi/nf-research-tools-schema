  "title": "STAT3 inhibition reduces macrophage number and tumor growth in neurofibroma.",
  "abstract": "Plexiform neurofibroma, a benign peripheral nerve tumor, is associated with the biallelic loss of function of the NF1 tumor suppressor in Schwann cells. Here, we show that FLLL32, a small molecule inhibitor of JAK2/STAT3 signaling, reduces neurofibroma growth in mice with conditional, biallelic deletion of Nf1 in the Schwann cell lineage. FLLL32 treatment or Stat3 deletion in tumor cells reduced inflammatory cytokine expression and tumor macrophage numbers in neurofibroma. Although STAT3 inhibition downregulated the chemokines CCL2 and CCL12, which can signal through CCR2 to recruit macrophages to peripheral nerves, deletion of Ccr2 did not improve survival or reduce macrophage numbers in neurofibroma-bearing mice. Interestingly, Iba1+; F4/80+;CD11b+ macrophages accounted for ~20-40% of proliferating cells in untreated tumors. FLLL32 suppressed macrophage proliferation, implicating STAT3-dependent, local proliferation in neurofibroma macrophage accumulation, and decreased Schwann cell proliferation and increased Schwann cell death. The functions of STAT3 signaling in neurofibroma Schwann cells and macrophages, and its relevance as a therapeutic target in neurofibroma, merit further investigation.",
