  "abstract": "Recently the M17S1 gene, encoding an epidermal antigen thought to play a role in cell adhesion, was mapped to chromosome bands 17q11-q12, placing it in the vicinity of the gene for the genetic disorder neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1). The pleomorphic cutaneous lesions of NF1 and the precedent for other genes being embedded within the NF1 gene prompted us to investigate whether the M17S1 gene mapped near, or within, the NF1 gene. Genetic linkage analyses revealed that M17S1 was tightly linked to NF1 and mapped within the interval bounded by D17S58 and D17S54. Physical mapping of an M17S1 cDNA on somatic cell hybrids, yeast artificial chromosomes, and an NF1 patient with a deletion involving an entire NF1 allele demonstrated that M17S1 is located at least 180 kb centromeric to the NF1 gene. The distance between the genes suggests that M17S1 is unlikely to contribute to the NF1 phenotype since a gross chromosomal rearrangement would be required to disrupt expression of both genes.",
