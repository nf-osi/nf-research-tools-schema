  "title": "Multiple endocrine neoplasia associated with von Recklinghausen's disease.",
  "abstract": "Details were studied of three patients with duodenal carcinoid tumour in association with neurofibromatosis and phaeochromocytoma, and of four patients with duodenal carcinoid and either von Recklinghausen's disease or phaeochromocytoma. The rarity of these endocrine tumours, together with the unusual morphological features and somatostatin content of the two duodenal carcinoids examined, suggest that this combination of tumours is not a chance association. It is suggested that this linkage of neurofibromatosis, phaeochromocytoma, and duodenal carcinoid is a specific multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome.",
