Author information: (1)Pediatric Oncology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.  BACKGROUND: Pirfenidone, an oral anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic agent with  activity in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, may mediate anti-tumor activity in  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and plexiform neurofibromas (PN) by inhibition of  fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis. The primary objective of this  open label, single arm phase II trial was to evaluate the activity of  pirfenidone in children and young adults with inoperable PN. PROCEDURE: Patients (3-21 years) with NF1-related progressive PN received  pirfenidone at the previously determined optimal dose (500 mg/m(2) orally, q8h)  on a continuous dosing schedule (one cycle = 28 days). Volumetric MRI analysis  was used to assess response. Progression was defined as ≥ 20% PN volume increase  compared to baseline. Pirfenidone would be considered active if it doubled the  median time to progression (TTP) compared to the TTP on the placebo arm of a  phase II trial with the farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib, which used  near identical eligibility criteria. Toxicities, objective response rate, and  quality of life (QOL) also were evaluated. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were enrolled and tolerated pirfenidone well with  intermittent nausea and vomiting as the most frequent toxicities. A dose  reduction was required in only three patients. The median TTP for pirfenidone  was 13.2 months compared to 10.6 months for the placebo control group from the  tipifarnib trial (two-tailed P = 0.92; one-tailed P = 0.46). No objective  responses were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Pirfenidone was well tolerated, but did not demonstrate activity as  defined in this trial and does not warrant further evaluation in children with  NF1 and progressive PN.  © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
