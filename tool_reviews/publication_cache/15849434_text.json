  "abstract": "Alix/AIP1 is a multifunctional adaptor protein involved in endocytosis, cell adhesion, and cell death. By yeast two-hybrid screening we identified a novel Alix/AIP1-interacting protein named Rab GTPase-activating protein-like protein (RabGAPLP). Interaction between Alix and RabGAPLP was confirmed by pull-down assays using fusion proteins of either glutathione-S-transferase (GST) or chitin-binding domain (CBD) and lysates of cultured mammalian cells expressing the respective proteins. Partial colocalization of FLAG-tagged RabGAPLP and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused Alix was observed at cell edges and filopodia-like structures by fluorescence confocal laser scanning microscopic analysis. The identity of RabGAPLP to merlin-associated protein (MAP), one of the interacting partners of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene product (merlin), implies cross-talk of membrane traffic and cell adhesion.",
