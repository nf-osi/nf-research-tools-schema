  "abstract": "The impact of coexisting genetic mutations on murine optic glioma biology.  Kaul A(1), Toonen JA(1), Gianino SM(1), Gutmann DH(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis,  Missouri.  BACKGROUND: Children with the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) tumor  predisposition syndrome are prone to the development of optic pathway gliomas  resulting from biallelic inactivation of the NF1 gene. Recent studies have  revealed the presence of other molecular alterations in a small portion of these  NF1-associated brain tumors. The purpose of this study was to leverage Nf1  genetically engineered mouse strains to define the functional significance of  these changes to optic glioma biology. METHODS: Nf1+/- mice were intercrossed with Nf1(flox/flox) mice, which were then  crossed with Nf1(flox/flox); GFAP-Cre mice, to generate Nf1(flox/mut); GFAP-Cre  (FMC) mice. These mice were additionally mated with conditional KIAA1549:BRAF  knock-in or Pten(flox/wt) mice to generate Nf1(flox/mut); f-BRAF; GFAP-Cre  (FMBC) mice or Nf1(flox/mut); Pten(flox/wt); GFAP-Cre (FMPC) mice, respectively.  The resulting optic gliomas were analyzed for changes in tumor volume,  proliferation, and retinal ganglion cell loss. RESULTS: While KIAA1549:BRAF conferred no additional biological properties on  Nf1 optic glioma, FMPC mice had larger optic gliomas with greater proliferative  indices and microglial infiltration. In addition, all 3 Nf1 murine optic glioma  strains exhibited reduced retinal ganglion cell survival and numbers; however,  FMPC mice had greater retinal nerve fiber layer thinning near the optic head  relative to FMC and FMBC mice. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these experiments demonstrate genetic cooperativity  between Nf1 loss and Pten heterozygosity relevant to optic glioma biology and  further underscore the value of employing genetically engineered mouse strains  to define the contribution of discovered molecular alterations to brain tumor  pathogenesis.  © The Author(s) 2014.
