  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Measurement of pain interference in children is challenged by a lack of validated measures with a parent proxy report. This study investigated the psychometric properties of the Pain Interference Index (PII), a six-item questionnaire originally developed in Swedish, in chronically ill youth. METHODS: We adapted the PII for English-speaking participants and created a parallel parent proxy measure. Respondents indicate how much pain has interfered with the child's life in the past 2 weeks (0-6 scale); higher scores indicate more pain interference. Eligible participants included individuals 6-25 years with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and cancer. Internal consistency was assessed; validity was examined by correlating PII scores with existing measures of pain interference (Modified Brief Pain Inventory [MBPI]) and pain intensity (visual analogue scale [VAS]), and with measures of disease severity. RESULTS: Among 60 participants (mean age 14.7 years, range 6-24) and their parents, PII internal consistency was 0.84 and 0.96, respectively. PII scores correlated with MBPI (r\u2009=\u20090.81, P\u2009<\u20090.0001) and VAS (r\u2009=\u20090.55, P\u2009<\u20090.0001) scores and differentiated between patients with mild vs moderate/severe NF1 disease severity (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The PII-Parent was significantly correlated with the mothers' and fathers' VAS rating of the child's pain intensity (Ps\u2009<\u20090.01). CONCLUSIONS: Internal consistency of the English PII is high; validity is supported by the PII's correlations with other measures of pain interference and pain intensity, and with disease severity in patients with NF1. Preliminary data indicate that the English PII is a reliable, valid, feasible pain interference measure for youth with NF1 and cancer.",

  "methods": "Methods. We adapted the PII for English-speaking participants and created a parallel parent proxy measure. Respondents indicate how much pain has interfered with the child\u2019s life in the past 2 weeks (0\u20136 scale); higher scores indicate more pain interference. Eligible participants included individuals 6\u201325 years with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and cancer. Internal consistency was assessed; validity was examined by correlating PII scores with existing measures of pain interference (Modified Brief Pain Inventory [MBPI]) and pain intensity (visual analogue scale [VAS]), and with measures of disease severity. Materials and Methods Eligible patients included children, adolescents, and young adults (6\u201325 years of age) with NF1 or cancer (solid tumor or leukemia) who were enrolled on a medical research protocol at a government research institute. (We included participants up to 25 years as measures that span from childhood to young adulthood are preferable for longitudinal research.) Next, patients must have been accompanied by at least one parent who was willing to participate. If more than one parent was present, both were invited to participate. Sixty-three families who were identified as eligible were approached during routine out-patient clinic visits (92%) or in their room on the inpatient unit (8%). Of these, three chose not to participate due to lack of interest or time (response rate = 95.2%). Patients were administered a battery of four questionnaires in randomized order. In addition to the PII, patients completed previously validated measures of pain interference (Modified Brief Pain Inventory [MBPI] [ 23 ]) and pain intensity (Faces Pain Scale-Revised [FPS-R] [ 24 ]; Pain Rating Scale [PRS] [ 25 ]). Parents completed the PII-P and the parent version of the PRS in random order to assess their child\u2019s pain interference and pain intensity, respectively. Parent report versions of the PII and PRS were administered in random order as well. Demographic and medical information were obtained through medical chart review. Additionally, a nurse practitioner (A. B.) rated all patients with NF1 in terms of symptom severity (mild, moderate, or severe) and number of NF1-related disease complications. Due to a smaller number of patients with NF1 who were rated as moderate or severe compared with mild, the moderate and severe ratings were combined into one category (moderate/severe). Measures PII The original PII measure is a six-item self-report questionnaire that assesses pain interference using the past 2 weeks as a recall period [ 22 ]. Respondents rate items on a 0\u20136 scale to indicate how much pain has interfered with various activities, and the total score is the mean of the six items. Preliminary reliability of the Swedish version is good (Cronbach\u2019s alpha = 0.84). Initial translation of the items into English was performed by the Swedish research group that developed the instrument (R.W.), consisting of bilingual (i.e., Swedish and English) psychologists. The English translation was analyzed by the first and third authors (American psychologists familiar with the topic). A few adjustments were made to improve the precision (adding examples) and flow (replacing \u201cmanage\u201d with \u201cdo\u201d) of the text. Next, the English version was translated back to ascertain that it reflected the same item content as the original version. No further adjustments were required, and the questionnaire was considered adequate by both the originator of the instrument and the American authors. The final English version is presented in  Appendix 1 . PII-Parent The six-item PII-P is formatted and scored in the same manner as the self-report PII, with total scores ranging from 0 to 6. The authors changed the items on the PII to reflect the parent\u2019s point of view, such that the parents respond about the extent to which pain interferes with their child\u2019s daily life. MBPI The MBPI, adapted from the adult Brief Pain Inventory [ 26 ], is a 12-item self-report questionnaire that measures pain interference and has been used with children and adolescents ages 8\u201320 years [ 23 , 27 ]. Patients are asked to indicate the extent to which pain interfered with various activities in the past week, with scores ranging from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes). A total score is obtained by taking the mean of the scores for all 12 items; thus, the total score can range from 0 to 10. Cronbach\u2019s alpha reliability estimates range from 0.77 to 0.91 [ 23 , 27 ], and construct validity is strong as demonstrated through its association with concurrent pain intensity [ 27 ]. FPS-R The FPS-R is a one-item tool designed to provide an overall indicator of pain intensity at the time of the assessment [ 24 ]. Respondents choose one of six faces with varying expressions to indicate how much pain they feel. The faces are scored as 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 points, so 0 = no pain and 10 = very much pain. The FPS-R has been validated in children as young as 4 years [ 28 ]. PRS The PRS is a two-item visual analogue scale (VAS) developed by the authors (P. W. and S. M.) that assesses pain intensity by asking the respondent to draw a mark on a 100-mm line to indicate his or her 1) current level of pain and 2) most important pain in the past week. Only the second item was included in analyses for this study. The phrase \u201cmost important pain\u201d was used to enable patients to identify the pain that was most important to them as many of them have pain in multiple locations. The PRS includes verbal descriptors (low, medium, high, extreme) and a face at each anchor to help patients orient their position on the line, as recommended by Averbuch and Katzper [ 29 ]. The distance in millimeters from the beginning of the line to the patient\u2019s mark is the score. VAS scales are commonly used to assess pain in pediatric populations, and evidence exists to support their reliability and validity [ 30 ]. The PRS has been used in children with medical conditions involving chronic pain [ 25 ]. PRS-Parent The Pain Rating Scale-Parent version (PRS-P) is similar to the VAS self-report PRS in terms of item content and format. Parents are asked to draw a mark on a 100-mm line to indicate their child\u2019s level of pain currently, and on another line, they indicate their child\u2019s most important pain in the past week; the second item was included in the current analyses. Like the self-report PRS, the PRS-P lines also include verbal descriptors (low, medium, high, extreme) and a face at each anchor to help orient the respondent\u2019s position on the line. Scores for each item can range from 0 to 100. NF1 Disease Severity The nurse practitioner who typically conducts physical examinations with the patients with NF1 completed two measures of disease severity based on the results of her examination and retrospective chart review. First, the NF Disease Severity Scale, adapted by our group from Ablon [ 31 ], asks the medical professional to rate the patient\u2019s symptoms as mild, moderate, or severe. Verbal descriptions for each category are provided and ask the rater to consider how the patient\u2019s symptoms affect their overall physical well-being and daily functioning. The second indicator of disease severity, the NF1 Disease Complications Scale, is a checklist designed by a multi-disciplinary team of medical experts in NF1 at the National Institutes of Health. A medical professional notes the presence/absence of 18 diagnoses and physical complications related to NF1 (e.g., scoliosis, chronic headaches, pseudoarthrosis). The total severity score is the sum of the endorsed diagnoses. Inter-rater reliability and construct validity of this measure have been supported [ 32 ]. Statistical Analyses Cronbach\u2019s coefficient alphas were calculated for the PII and for the PII-P, with mothers\u2019 and fathers\u2019 data examined separately. Pearson correlations between the two PII scales and the other pain scales (MBPI, FPS-R, PRS) were computed to assess concurrent validity. Analyses of variance (ANOVAs) and chi-square tests of independence were used to compare disease type (cancer and NF1) on demographic variables (patient age, gender, race, parent education). No differences were significant, except that patients with cancer were slightly older ( M  age = 15.9 \u00b1 4.0) than patients with NF1 ( M  age = 13.6 \u00b1 4.4;  F  = 4.65,  P  < 0.05). Thus, age was entered as a covariate in the analyses that examine differences between disease groups on pain scores. We also categorized patients by age to further examine differences between younger and older children in PII scores; we first separated children into groups of 6\u201312 years vs 13 years and older, and then into groups of 6\u20139 years vs 10 years and older to assess the validity of the PII in young children. Separate analyses were conducted using data from the NF1 patient group to investigate construct validity; specifically, Pearson correlations and ANOVAs were used to explore relationships between PII scores and disease severity. ANOVAs with post hoc Tukey comparisons and correlations were used to determine differences on the pain measures across pain medication status (yes or no) and demographic variables. Alpha was set at 0.05.",

  "introduction": "Introduction Chronic pain is common among children with a variety of medical illnesses. For example, many children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) experience pain due to symptoms such as plexiform neurofibromas [ 1 ] and chronic headaches [ 2 ]. NF1-related pain can be addressed with pain medication, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anticonvulsants, and narcotics. However, many patients taking these medications experience side effects [ 3 \u2013 5 ] and continue to report pain [ 6 ]. Among children with cancer, nearly half report experiencing pain related to disease processes and treatments, and about one-third report that their pain occurs often or very often [ 7 ]. Opioids are probably the most common treatment of pain in patients with cancer [ 8 ], and a significant portion of children taking opioids experiences breakthrough pain [ 9 ]. Importantly, pain can have a substantial impact on quality of life [ 10 \u2013 12 ]. Recent research has pointed to the importance of considering not just pain intensity but also the extent to which pain interferes with daily functioning [ 13 ]. Pain interference refers to the degree to which pain interferes with or limits an individual\u2019s daily activities. It correlates with anxiety and negative mood and with pain intensity in adults [ 14 , 15 ]. The amount of pain interference patients experience has been found to relate to decreased sleep [ 16 ] and poorer overall survival [ 17 ] among various patient groups. To date, most of the research on pain interference has been conducted with adults. There are few measures of pain interference that have been validated with children, and consequently, little is known about how pain impacts the daily lives of children with chronic health conditions. Ideally, a child pain interference measure should have strong psychometric properties and have utility in both clinical and research settings as pain interference questionnaires increasingly are being included as outcomes in clinical trials involving patients with diseases such as cancer [ 18 , 19 ] and sickle cell anemia [ 20 ]. Brevity and cost are considerations as well, particularly for multisite studies. Finally, in addition to a child self-report form, the measure should have a parent report form as well as a parallel adult self-report form that can be given in research protocols including a wide age range of participants (children through adults) and in longitudinal investigations where adolescents may transition to adulthood during the course of the study [ 21 ]. To our knowledge, no currently existing measures fulfill all of these specifications. The Pain Interference Index (PII) is a freely available six-item questionnaire meant to assess the degree to which pain has interfered with daily activities in the past 2 weeks. This measure initially was developed and validated in Sweden with a group of children and adolescents ages 8\u201318 years with longstanding idiopathic pain [ 22 ]. In collaboration with the Swedish researchers, the authors of the current study translated the measure to English and also created a parallel parent report version (PII-P) and an adult self-report version. The primary objective of the present study was to assess the reliability and validity of the English-language PII pediatric and parent proxy scales. We also wanted to explore the feasibility of the PII measures, in terms of ease of administration and completion of the forms, and missing data.",
  "results": "Results Demographic and Medical Characteristics Descriptive statistics for demographic and medical variables are presented in  Table 1 . Sixty youth (58% male) and their accompanying caregivers (46 mothers, 18 fathers, one grandmother) participated in this study. The mean age of the patients was 14.7 years (standard deviation = 4.3 years; range 6.6\u201324.1 years). The mean level of parent education was 13.5 \u00b1 2.1 years (range 9\u201318 years). Most patients (80%) were Caucasian. The most common medical diagnoses were NF1 (52%), medullary thyroid carcinoma (18%), Ewing\u2019s sarcoma (15%), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (8%). Twenty-two percent of patients were taking prescription pain medication. No significant relationships emerged between demographic variables (child age, gender, parent education) and any of the pain scales ( P s > 0.05). Further, with age as a covariate, the relationship between disease type and PII scores was not significant ( P  > 0.05). Feasibility All individuals who agreed to participate completed all the measures in about 5\u201310 minutes, with the PII requiring about 1\u20132 minutes. One 9-year-old child with NF1 and severe attention and learning problems seemed to have difficulty understanding the measure and required additional explanations of items. No other patients or parents reported difficulty, and there were no missing data points. Reliability Cronbach\u2019s coefficient alpha was 0.84 (unstandardized) for the patient PII, and 0.94 and 0.96 for the parent PII (mothers and fathers, respectively). Patient and parent scores on the PII were correlated ( r  = 0.62,  P  < 0.0001), but patients\u2019 scores were significantly lower, indicating less pain interference, than their parents\u2019 scores (1.1 vs 1.5,  t  = 3.28,  P  = 0.002),  d  = 0.39. This difference did not vary by patient age group, gender, or disease ( P s > 0.05). To investigate this finding further, we analyzed the difference between patient and parent mean scores on specific items. Parents indicated significantly more interference than the children on items assessing the impact of pain on mood ( t  = 2.39,  P  = 0.02) and sleep ( t  = 2.58,  P  = 0.01). Construct Validity PII scores were highly correlated with MBPI scores ( r  = 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.70\u20130.88;  P  < 0.0001) and with scores on the PRS ( r  = 0.54, CI: 0.35\u20130.71;  P  < 0.0001). Patients\u2019 PII scores correlated significantly with their mothers\u2019 PRS scores ( r  = 0.43, CI: 0.16\u20130.64;  P  = 0.003) and were close to being significantly related to their fathers\u2019 scores ( r  = 0.48, CI: \u22120.01\u20130.73;  P  = 0.051). The relationship between the PII and the FPS-R pain scale could not be evaluated reliably due to a lack of variance in FPS-R scores; 52 patients scored \u201c0,\u201d seven patients scored \u201c2,\u201d and one patient scored \u201c4\u201d on this measure. Parents\u2019 scores on the PII-P were correlated with the parent PRS ( r  = 0.68, CI: 0.40\u20130.73;  P  < 0.0001). Additionally, patients who were taking prescription pain medication obtained significantly higher pain interference scores on the PII (N = 13;  M  = 1.92 \u00b1 1.01) than those not taking pain medication (N = 47;  M  = 0.90 \u00b1 1.02;  F  = 10.2,  P  < 0.01; see  Table 2 ). Similar results were obtained on the PII-P, with mean scores higher for children who were taking pain medication ( M  = 2.63 \u00b1 1.06) vs those who were not ( M  = 1.29 \u00b1 1.33;  F  = 11.09,  P  < 0.01). As individuals with NF1 comprised the largest patient subgroup (N = 31), we examined the relationship between PII scores and disease severity in this group. NF1 Disease Severity Scale ratings completed by the nurse practitioner were available for 30 of the 31 patients with NF1. Patients rated as moderate/severe (N = 14,  M  = 1.61 \u00b1 1.0) scored significantly higher on the PII compared with patients rated as mild (N = 16;  M  = 0.58 \u00b1 0.75;  F  = 9.95,  P  = 0.004). The difference in PII-P scores between the moderate/severe group ( M  = 2.01 \u00b1 1.4) vs the mild group ( M  = 1.52 \u00b1 1.5) was not statistically significant ( P  = 0.37). A trend was apparent wherein higher scores on the NF1 Disease Complications Scale were related to higher PII scores but not significantly so ( r  = 0.33,  P  = 0.07).",
  "discussion": "Conclusions In sum, the PII and PII-P appear to be reliable, valid, and feasible measures to assess pain interference in children and adolescents ages 6\u201325 years with chronic illness. It is one of the few validated pain interference tools that has both a self-report and parent report version. In addition, our group is validating a parallel self-report PII for adults so that the same measure can be used in children through adults. These freely available questionnaires have the potential to provide useful information in primary care settings when brief assessments are prioritized, as well as in specialized pain clinics. Moreover, researchers are urged to consider using the PII and PII-P in clinical trials, where reliable and valid measures are essential.",
