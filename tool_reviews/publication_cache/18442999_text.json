  "abstract": "Nf1+/- mice have increased neointima formation via hyperactivation of a Gleevec  sensitive molecular pathway.  Lasater EA(1), Bessler WK, Mead LE, Horn WE, Clapp DW, Conway SJ, Ingram DA, Li  F.  Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine,  Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the  NF1 tumor suppressor gene. Neurofibromin is encoded by NF1 and functions as a  negative regulator of Ras activity. Somatic mutations in the residual normal NF1  allele within cancers of NF1 patients is consistent with NF1 functioning as a  tumor-suppressor. However, the prevalent non-malignant manifestations of NF1,  including learning and bone disorders emphasize the importance of dissecting the  cellular and biochemical effects of NF1 haploinsufficiency in multiple cell  lineages. One of the least studied complications of NF1 involves cardiovascular  disorders, including arterial occlusions that result in cerebral and visceral  infarcts. NF1 vasculopathy is characterized by vascular smooth muscle cell  (VSMC) accumulation in the intima area of vessels resulting in lumen occlusion.  We recently showed that Nf1 haploinsufficiency increases VSMC proliferation and  migration via hyperactivation of the Ras-Erk pathway, which is a signaling axis  directly linked to neointima formation in diverse animal models of vasculopathy.  Given this observation, we tested whether heterozygosity of Nf1 would lead to  vaso-occlusive disease in genetically engineered mice in vivo. Strikingly,  Nf1+/- mice have increased neointima formation, excessive vessel wall cell  proliferation and Erk activation after vascular injury in vivo. Further, this  effect is directly dependent on a Gleevec sensitive molecular pathway.  Therefore, these studies establish an Nf1 model of vasculopathy, which mirrors  features of human NF1 vaso-occlusive disease, identifies a potential therapeutic  target and provides a platform to further dissect the effect of Nf1  haploinsufficiency in cardiovascular disease.
