  "abstract": "A T50I substitution in the K-Ras interswitch domain causes Noonan syndrome and emerged as a third-site mutation that restored the in vivo transforming activity and constitutive MAPK pathway activation by an attenuated KrasG12D,E37G oncogene in a mouse leukemia model. Biochemical and crystallographic data suggested that K-RasT50I increases MAPK signal output through a non-GTPase mechanism, potentially by promoting asymmetric Ras:Ras interactions between T50 and E162. We generated a \"switchable\" system in which K-Ras mutant proteins expressed at physiologic levels supplant the fms like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) dependency of MOLM-13 leukemia cells lacking endogenous KRAS and used this system to interrogate single or compound G12D, T50I, D154Q, and E162L mutations. These studies support a key role for the asymmetric lateral assembly of K-Ras in a plasma membrane-distal orientation that promotes the formation of active Ras:Raf complexes in a membrane-proximal conformation. Disease-causing mutations such as T50I are a valuable starting point for illuminating normal Ras function, elucidating mechanisms of disease, and identifying potential therapeutic opportunities for Rasopathy disorders and cancer.",

  "methods": "Methods MOLM-13 cell line. Early-passage MOLM-13 cells (DSMZ) were cultured in RPMI media (HyClone) containing 10% FBS (Corning), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Thermo Fisher), and 1% GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher). Ribonucleoprotein-based editing. We incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 minutes 160 \u03bcM CRISPR RNA and 160 \u03bcM trans-activating CRISPR RNA (Dharmacon) that were resuspended in 10 mM Tris pH 7.4 buffer (GE Healthcare). An equal volume of Cas9 (MacroLab Core Facility, UC Berkeley) was added and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 15 minutes. The mixture with 5 \u03bcL of 100 \u03bcM enhancer template (IDT) was added to 2 \u00d7 10 6  MOLM-13 cells for nucleofection. Nucleofection was performed with SF Cell Line 4D-Nucleofector X Kit S and code DJ-110 (4D-Nucleofector X Unit; Lonza). Single-cell clone generation. We plated 1 cell/well 5 days after nucleofection to isolate single-cell clones, which were confirmed for  KRAS  KO by genomic DNA isolation, PCR amplification and purification, and Sanger sequencing analysis (GENEWIZ; Synthego ICE). Plasmids, cloning, and mutagenesis. The plasmids pCW57.1 (Addgene plasmid 41393), pDONR223  KRAS \n WT  (Addgene plasmid 81751), and pDONR223  KRAS \n G12D  (Addgene plasmid 81651) were used to generate dox-inducible  KRAS  constructs with Gateway LR Clonase enzyme mix (Thermo Fisher). EGFP was Gibson cloned from FgH1tUTG (a gift from Catherine Smith at UCSF) to the N-terminus of  KRAS  on pCW57.1  KRAS . mCherry- KRAS  constructs were generated using pCW57.1 EGFP -KRAS  as backbone, and the mCherry sequence of pHR-SFFV- KRAS -dCas9-P2A-mCherry (a gift from Luke Gilbert at UCSF) was used to replace EGFP by Gibson cloning.  KRAS  mutagenesis on the aforementioned inducible vectors was performed with the QuikChange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent). Lentiviral transduction and cell sorting. Lentiviral backbone, packaging vector (dR8.91), and envelope (pMD2G) were transfected into 293T lenti-X cells (Takara Bio) with TransIT-LT1 (Mirus Bio). Supernatant was collected 48 hours after transfection and applied to  KRAS  clones with polybrene for transduction. Cells were spin-infected at 800 KO g  for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C. After puromycin selection, cells were treated with 2 \u03bcg/mL dox (Sigma) for 24 hours and sorted for EGFP + , mCherry + , or double-positive cells. For clone 24, EGFP +  sorted cells were subsequently sorted to isolate a population that did not express EGFP in the absence of dox. Immunoblotting. Whole-cell lysates were collected and 30 \u03bcg of protein per sample was used for immunoblotting. Hsp90 (BD 610418, clone 68) or \u03b2-actin (Cell Signaling Technology [CST] 4967) Abs were used for loading controls. Additional primary Abs used for detecting were as follows: KRAS (Sigma; WH0003845M1, clone 3B10-2F2; does not detect proteins with E162L mutation), EGFP (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 11575712, clone F56-6A1.2.3), mCherry (CST 43590, clone E5D8F), p-ERK1/2 (CST 4370, clone D13.14.4E), ERK1/2 (CST 9107, clone 3A7), p-S6 (CST 4858, clone D57.2.2E), S6 (CST 2317, clone 54D2), NRAS (Proteintech; 10724-1-AP, clone Ag1081), Bcl-2 (CST 3498, clone D17C4), Mcl-1 (CST 94296, clone D2W9E), PARP (CST 9532, clone 46D11), cleaved caspase-3 (CST 9661; cleavage adjacent to Asp175), and cleaved caspase-7 (CST 9491; cleavage adjacent to Asp198). Ras-GTP assays were performed with the Active RAS Pull-Down Kit (Thermo Fisher). CC3, annexin V, and EdU assays. CC3 expression levels were assessed by flow cytometry after plating 20,000 cells/well in 96-well, round-bottom plates (Corning) and then treating them with or without 2 \u03bcg/mL dox (Sigma) and DMSO (Sigma) or 10 nM AC220 (Selleckchem) for 48 hours. Fixed and permeabilized cells were stained with a CC3 Ab (BD Horizon; catalog 560627) for 1 hour and analyzed on the Attune NxT flow cytometer (Thermo Fisher) at the UCSF HDFCCC LCA Core Facility. Annexin V and EdU were similarly assessed by flow cytometry after treating with dox and AC220 for 48 and 24 hours, respectively, then following the staining protocols as specified by their respective manufacturers: Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD 556547) and Click-iT Plus EdU Flow Cytometry Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher  C10634 ). Cell viability analysis. We plated 1,000 cells/well in opaque, 96-well, flat-bottom plates (PerkinElmer), then treated them with or without 2 \u03bcg/mL dox (Sigma) and AC220 (Selleckchem) for 72 hours. Cell viability was analyzed with CTG (Promega). Recombinant K-Ras GTP-hydrolysis assay. Constructs to make recombinant K-Ras proteins (residues 1\u2013169) were gene synthesized and subcloned into pET-29b +  bacterial expression vectors with an N-terminal His6 fusion tag followed by a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site (ENLYFQG) by GenScript. Resulting plasmids were transformed into BL21 CodonPlus (DE3) RIPL  E .  coli  strain to generate recombinant proteins. Intrinsic and GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis assays have been described previously ( 51 ,  52 ). Crystallization and structure determination. K-Ras T50I  protein (38.5 mg/mL) was set up using the sitting drop method at 4\u00b0C. Protein was diluted 1:1 with mother liquor (0.2 M calcium chloride, 20% PEG3,350). Crystal was soaked in a solution containing the mother liquor with 20% (vol/vol) glycerol, followed by flash-freezing. X-ray diffraction data were collected at beamline 8.3.1 at the Advanced Light Source (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory). Data were processed and scaled using MOSFLM and SCALA in the CCP4 package ( Supplemental Table 1 ). Structure was solved by molecular replacement using the structure of a GDP-bound K-Ras G12C  protein (PDB: 4LDJ) as a starting mode and refined until there was no further improvement. Structural biology data have been deposited in the Worldwide PDB (PDB: 7T1F). Statistics. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8.

  "introduction": "Introduction Ras proteins are small GTPases that cycle between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states to regulate diverse cellular processes. In cancer cells, highly prevalent somatic mutations that alter amino acids 12, 13, and 61 impair intrinsic GTP hydrolysis, induce resistance to GAP stimulation, and/or increase the rate of nucleotide exchange. Consequently, these mutant Ras proteins accumulate in the GTP-bound state, constitutively increase effector pathway signaling, and drive aberrant cell proliferation and survival. The development of K-Ras G12C  inhibitors with antitumor activity has demonstrated the feasibility of targeting these previously \u201cundruggable\u201d oncoproteins and showed that  KRAS -mutant cancers remain addicted to hyperactive Ras in vivo ( 1 \u2013 3 ). Studies of tumor specimens obtained at disease progression indicate selective pressure to restore oncogenic Ras signaling through both on- and off-target adaptive resistance mechanisms ( 4 ,  5 ). These observations are consistent with previous work that emphasized the importance of developing effective strategies to both potently inhibit mutant Ras signal output and target possible bypass mechanisms ( 6 ,  7 ). A distinct class of germline  KRAS  and  NRAS  mutations causes Rasopathy developmental disorders ( 8 \u2013 10 ). These alleles encode gain-of-function K-Ras proteins that are biochemically and functionally attenuated in comparison with Ras oncoproteins, allowing compatibility with embryonic development ( 8 ). Strikingly, some of these mutant proteins harbor substitutions in amino acids distant from Ras effector or nucleotide binding sites and exhibit normal intrinsic GTPase activity, responsiveness to GAPs, and nucleotide exchange ( 9 \u2013 11 ). Interestingly, approximately 40% of Rasopathy  BRAF  mutations alter amino acids predicted to mediate interactions between Ras and the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of B-Raf ( 12 ). Prior to interacting with Ras and being recruited to the plasma membrane (PM), Raf is held in an autoinhibited state by 14-3-3 scaffold proteins and MEK ( 13 ). The Raf-CRD occupies the center position of this complex. Recent functional studies showed that many Rasopathy B-Raf mutant proteins are characterized by impaired kinase autoinhibition and that this correlates with their phenotypic severity ( 14 ). In the absence of effector engagement, Ras-GTP likely exists in a membrane-distal state, which increases its interaction range to recruit Raf to the PM ( 15 ). Subsequent K-Ras binding to the exposed surfaces of Raf releases CRD-mediated autoinhibitory interactions and integrates kinase domain\u2013exposed Raf into a membrane-proximal signaling conformation ( 13 ,  16 ). Recently solved co-crystal structures of active Ras in complex with Raf conserved region 1 ( 17 ,  18 ) confirmed earlier predictions that efficient Raf activation by Ras requires both a high-affinity interaction with the Ras binding domain (RBD) of Raf and low-affinity binding to the CRD ( 19 ,  20 ). In the Ras signalosome, both Ras and the Raf-CRD are involved in membrane lipid binding based on NMR-guided characterization of nanodisc-bound Ras:Raf complexes ( 21 ). A germline  NRAS  mutation encoding a threonine-to-isoleucine substitution at codon 50 (T50I) causes Rasopathy disorders ( 10 ). Somatic  KRAS  mutations were subsequently identified in a few melanomas and colorectal cancers ( T50I 22 ,  23 ). An unrelated line of investigation converged on T50I when a  Kras  oncogene impaired for Raf binding due to a second-site E37G substitution initiated T lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a murine retroviral transduction and transplantation system ( G12D 24 ). Two of these leukemias independently acquired T50I as a third-site mutation that restored the oncogenic activity of  Kras . Taken together, these diverse observations in different disease contexts support an unexpected role of T50 in regulating Ras activity. T50 is located on the b2\u2013b3 loop of Ras between the effector-binding switch 1 and 2 regions and was predicted to activate signal output through a non-GTPase mechanism, based on biochemical and structural studies and in silico modeling ( G12D,E37G 10 ,  24 ). Here, we describe comprehensive analyses of mutant K-Ras4b proteins (hereafter referred to as K-Ras) containing T50I as a single mutation and in combination with substitutions at other residues implicated in Ras:Ras lateral assembly. We solved the crystal structure of K-Ras T50I  bound to GDP and generated a disease-relevant isogenic cell line model system for functional and biochemical studies wherein various K-Ras proteins were expressed at physiologic levels in cells lacking endogenous K-Ras. Integrating our results with recently published models of Ras:Raf activation based on co-crystal structures and functional studies ( 13 ,  17 ,  18 ), we propose that T50I enhances Ras signal output by promoting asymmetric lateral assembly of individual Ras molecules at the PM and by possibly enhancing the interaction of Ras with the Raf-CRD. Together, this work underscores the value of disease-relevant mutations as a starting point for interrogating mechanistic questions. We further describe a versatile approach for generating isogenic models for interrogating Ras function and testing the specificity and selectivity of candidate therapeutics that can be applied to other cancers characterized by druggable driver kinase mutations.",
  "results": "Results Our previous in silico analysis suggested that T50I might promote Ras/MAPK activation by bringing together the G domains of neighboring Ras molecules in an asymmetric manner ( 24 ). In this model, the interswitch b2\u2013b3 loop\u2013mediated asymmetric protein\u2013protein interface allows flexible, higher order assembly via head to tail juxtaposition ( Supplemental Figure 1A ; supplemental material available online with this article;  https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.168445DS1 ). This contrasts with symmetric dimer models proposed by others from analyses of subunit packing in published structures of Ras ( 25 \u2013 28 ). Cirstea et al. solved the crystal structure of H-Ras T50I  bound to GTP ( 10 ) and performed molecular dynamic simulations that implicated the Ras b2\u2013b3 loop and \u03b15 helix as a cryptic third-switch region that undergoes a conformational change upon GTP binding (switch III) ( 29 ) ( Supplemental Figure 1B ). On the basis of these data, they speculated that T50I enhances MAPK signaling by reorienting the G domains of Ras monomers relative to the PM ( 10 ). To gain additional insights into how T50I might increase Ras signal output and overcome the deleterious effects of an E37G mutation, we first reviewed the K-Ras G12D  structure (Protein Data Bank [PDB]: 5USJ) in the context of recent co-crystal structures of K-Ras in complex with the RBD of Raf (PDB: 4G0N; 6VJJ) or with the RBD and CRD (PDB: 6XI7; 7JHP). The observation that E37 of Ras forms cross \u03b2-strand salt bridges with R59 and R67 of Raf ( 30 ) ( Supplemental Figure 1C ) provides a molecular explanation for the decreased Raf binding, reduced transforming activity, and impaired MAPK pathway activation of K-Ras G12D,E37G  ( 24 ,  31 ). Because T50 is located more than 25 \u00c5 away from E/G37 ( Supplemental Figure 1C ), a large-scale structural change must occur for the T50I mutation to directly compensate for the loss of cross\u2013\u03b2-strand interactions due to the E37G substitution. We formally tested this possibility by solving the crystal structure of GDP-bound K-Ras T50I  (PDB: 7T1F). The WT K-Ras (K-Ras WT ) and K-Ras T50I  structures are very similar, with a backbone root mean square deviation of 0.7 \u00c5 between them ( Supplemental Figure 1D ). Isolated on the solvent-exposed side of a \u03b2-sheet, the impact of the T50I substitution on the overall structure is minimal, and a direct structural link between T50 and E37 can be ruled out ( Supplemental Figure 1 , C and D). Despite substantial differences in the C-terminal hypervariable domains of H-Ras and K-Ras4b, the structures of K-Ras T50I -GDP and H-Ras T50I -GTP ( 10 ) are highly similar after accounting for the expected effects of GDP versus GTP binding. We next asked if recombinant K-Ras T50I  has a reduced rate of intrinsic GTP hydrolysis or impaired GAP sensitivity, as commonly observed in oncogenic and Rasopathy K-Ras mutant proteins ( 1 ,  8 ,  9 ,  11 ,  32 ). Recombinant K-Ras WT , K-Ras T50I , oncogenic K-Ras G12D , and K-Ras G12D,T50I  proteins (residues 1\u2013169) were generated and loaded with [ 32 P] \u03b3-GTP to assess intrinsic GTPase activity and sensitivity to the GAP domains of p120GAP and neurofibromin ( 32 ,  33 ). K-Ras WT  and K-Ras T50I  exhibited similar intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rates and sensitivity to GAP stimulation ( Supplemental Figure 2 , A and B). As expected, K-Ras G12D  showed impaired intrinsic GTP hydrolysis and resistance to GAPs, which were unaffected by a secondary T50I substitution ( Supplemental Figure 2 , A and B). Together, these data support the idea that T50I enhances MAPK signaling through a non-GTPase mechanism. A broadly applicable model system for investigating how  KRAS  mutations modulate cellular phenotypes and MAPK signaling would ideally be characterized by (a) a tissue context or cell lineage in which Ras proteins regulate cell fate decisions and  RAS  mutations occur in cancer, (b) dependence on MAPK signaling for survival and proliferation, and (c) the flexibility to inducibly express individual mutant K-Ras proteins in the presence of endogenous levels of H-Ras and N-Ras. The fms like tyrosine kinase 3\u2013mutant ( FLT3 -mutant) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line MOLM-13 fulfills these criteria. Somatic  NRAS  and  KRAS  mutations are prevalent in AML, become undetectable during remission, and reappear or are replaced by a different signaling mutation at relapse ( 34 \u2013 36 ).  NRAS/KRAS  mutations frequently emerge at relapse in patients treated with clinical FLT3 inhibitors, and Ras oncoprotein expression rescues  FLT3 -mutant leukemia cell lines from drug-induced apoptosis ( 37 ). We reasoned that MOLM-13 cells could be engineered as a \u201cswitchable\u201d system by using the clinical inhibitor quizartinib (AC220) to suppress oncogenic FLT3 signaling and then assessing the biologic and biochemical consequences of expressing different Ras proteins at physiologic levels ( 38 ). Accordingly, we performed CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to generate independent MOLM-13 single-cell clones characterized by biallelic frameshift  KRAS  mutations and loss of K-Ras protein expression ( Figure 1A ; see complete unedited blots in the supplemental material).  KRAS -knockout ( KRAS ) clones 1 and 24 displayed similar sensitivities to AC220 as parental MOLM-13 cells ( KO Supplemental Figure 3 , A and B). These cells were transduced with lentivirus to stably express doxycycline-inducible (dox-inducible) K-Ras proteins fused to an N-terminal\u2013enhanced GFP (EGFP) cassette. We used the EGFP marker to isolate  KRAS  cells with similar EGFP\u2013K-Ras levels and titrated the dox concentration to mimic endogenous K-Ras expression ( KO Figure 1, B and C ). Treatment with 2 \u03bcg/mL dox induced physiologic levels of WT and mutant EGFP\u2013K-Ras protein expression in a high percentage of MOLM-13  KRAS  cells ( KO Figure 1, B and C , and  Supplemental Figure 3C ). MOLM-13 cells are dependent on oncogenic FLT3 signaling for survival and proliferation ( 37 ,  39 ). We assessed the ability of EGFP\u2013K-Ras WT  and of individual K-Ras mutant proteins to inhibit apoptosis and maintain MAPK pathway activation upon exposure to a dose of AC220 (10 nM) that suppressed ERK phosphorylation. In addition to investigating  KRAS  cells expressing EGFP\u2013K-Ras KO WT , EGFP-K-Ras T50I , and EGFP-K-Ras G12D , we generated isogenic clones expressing an E162L substitution that in silico structural analysis predicted would cooperate with T50I to promote Ras:Ras clustering ( Supplemental Figure 4 ). Expressing EGFP\u2013K-Ras G12D  at endogenous levels enhanced the survival of MOLM-13 clone 24 cells upon AC220 treatment, as indicated by a reduction in the percentage of cells positive for cleaved caspase-3 (CC3) and EGFP ( Figure 2A ). By contrast, EGFP\u2013K-Ras WT  and EGFP\u2013K-Ras T50I  did not rescue these cells from AC220-induced death. This observation is consistent with the modest gain-of-function properties of T50I and other germline Rasopathy mutations ( 9 \u2013 11 ,  32 ). However, introducing T50I as a second-site mutation significantly augmented the pro-survival activity of K-Ras G12D , and cells expressing a K-Ras G12D,T50I,E162L  triple-mutant protein exhibited the lowest percentage of CC3 +  cells ( Figure 2A ). The observation that E162L augments the pro-survival activity of K-Ras G12D,T50I  is consistent with the idea that this mutation promotes Ras:Ras lateral assembly ( Supplemental Figure 1A  and  Supplemental Figure 4 ). Similarly, studies in which we used CellTiter-Glo (CTG) to quantify metabolically active cells showed that K-Ras G12D,T50I  conferred partial resistance to AC220, which was further augmented in cells expressing K-Ras G12D,T50I,E162L  ( Figure 2, B and C ). CC3 and CTG analyses of MOLM-13  KRAS  clone 1 corroborated the findings in clone 24 ( KO Supplemental Figure 5 , A and B). Previous studies proposed a key role for D154 in alternative models of Ras dimerization and reported that a D-to-Q substitution impaired oncogenic activity and decreased MAPK pathway activation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking endogenous  Hras ,  Nras , and  Kras  expression ( 40 ,  41 ) ( Supplemental Figure 6 ). This idea is difficult to reconcile with recently solved Ras:Raf-RBD-CRD co-crystal structures ( 17 ,  18 ) and studies of Raf-CRD binding to nanodiscs ( 21 ) showing that D154 is in close proximity to the PM when Ras is bound to Raf and would not accommodate another Ras molecule nearby. To address the biochemical and phenotypic consequences of expressing this mutation at physiologic levels in an isogenic system, we generated MOLM-13  KRAS  cells expressing EGFP\u2013K-Ras KO D154Q  or EGFP\u2013K-Ras G12D,D154Q . Despite some interclonal variability, EGFP\u2013K-Ras D154Q  expression had minimal overall effects on AC220-induced apoptosis ( Figure 2, A\u2013C , and  Supplemental Figure 5 , A and B). Surprisingly, D154Q enhanced the pro-survival activity of K-Ras G12D  as a second-site mutation ( Figure 2A  and  Supplemental Figure 5A ). Accordingly, MOLM-13  KRAS  cells expressing EGFP\u2013K-Ras KO G12D,D154Q  exhibited significantly higher AC220 IC 50  values compared to cells expressing EGFP\u2013K-Ras G12D  ( Figure 2, B and C , and  Supplemental Figure 5B ). We conclude that D154Q has minimal effects on K-Ras function as a single mutation and unexpectedly augments the pro-survival activities of K-Ras G12D  in MOLM-13  KRAS  cells. KO To evaluate the possibility that any second-site substitution would nonspecifically alter K-Ras G12D  function, we generated  KRAS  cells expressing EGFP\u2013K-Ras KO G12D,T50D . Structural modeling predicted that T50D would have limited effects on EGFP\u2013K-Ras G12D  activity, which is what was observed ( Figure 2, A\u2013C , and  Supplemental Figure 5 ). Furthermore, recombinant K-Ras T50D  proteins exhibited normal intrinsic GTP hydrolysis, confirming that this mutation does not alter GTPase activity ( Supplemental Figure 2A ). Basal Ras-GTP levels are elevated in MOLM-13  KRAS  cells that express EGFP-K-Ras KO G12D  ( Figure 3A , DMSO) and persist after exposure to AC220 ( Figure 3A , AC220). By contrast, AC220 treatment efficiently suppressed Ras activation in cells expressing EGFP\u2013K-Ras WT , EGFP\u2013K-Ras T50I , or EGFP\u2013K-Ras D154Q  ( Figure 3A , right). Residues S235 and S236 of S6 ribosomal protein (S6) are phosphorylated downstream of both MAPK and PI3K/Akt in myeloid-lineage cells ( 42 ). Phosphorylated (p-) ERK1/2 and S6 S235/236  levels were constitutively elevated in MOLM-13 cells due to oncogenic FLT3 signaling ( Figure 3B , DMSO) and were fully suppressed by AC220 treatment in cells expressing EGFP\u2013K-Ras WT , EGFP\u2013K-Ras T50I , or EGFP\u2013K-Ras D154Q  ( Figure 3B , AC220). By contrast, cells expressing EGFP\u2013K-Ras G12D  with and without additional mutations maintained variable degrees of ERK and S6 activation, which correlated with Ras-GTP levels ( Figure 3, A and B ). Similarly, the biochemical profiles of the full panel of MOLM-13  KRAS  cells were concordant with functional data generated in CC3 and CTG assays ( KO Figure 2, A\u2013C ;  Figure 3, A and B ; and  Supplemental Figure 5 ). Western blot analysis verified the changes in CC3 protein levels detected by flow cytometry in response to AC220 and dox treatment ( Figure 3C ). Additional markers of apoptosis including cleaved PARP, cleaved caspase-7, and annexin V were all robustly induced by AC220 treatment in clone 24 MOLM-13  KRAS  cells. Consistent with the CC3 data, these responses were variably suppressed by dox-induced expression of K-Ras mutant proteins with K-Ras KO WT  and K-Ras T50I  similar to parental MOLM-13 cells, K-Ras G12D  and K-Ras G12D,T50D  characterized by modest effects, and K-Ras G12D,D154Q  and the K-Ras G12D,T50I,E162L  triple-mutant protein exhibiting potent anti-apoptotic activity ( Figure 3C  and  Supplemental Figure 7 ). Whereas expression of the pro-survival protein Bcl-2 was unaffected by treatment with AC220 and/or dox, Mcl-1 was dynamically modulated, exhibiting markedly reduced expression in K-Ras G12D,D154Q  and K-Ras G12D,T50I,E162L  cells ( Figure 3C ). S-phase analysis using 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) labeling revealed profound cell cycle arrest upon AC220 exposure in parental MOLM-13 and MOLM-13  KRAS  cells, which was partially reversed by dox-induced expression of different EGFP\u2013K-Ras proteins in accordance with biochemical and IC KO 50  data ( Supplemental Figure 8 ). Together, these results verify the dependence of MOLM-13 cells on mutant  FLT3  expression for survival and proliferation ( 37 ,  38 ) and demonstrate the variable ability of different mutant K-Ras proteins to suppress these phenotypes. An unresolved question in Ras biology is whether (and how) K-Ras WT  proteins antagonize the oncogenic activity of mutant K-Ras in cancer cells. An appealing explanation for this putative tumor suppressor activity is that K-Ras WT  proteins undergo rapid GTP hydrolysis, which destabilizes mutant K-Ras\u2013GTP clusters and attenuates signal output ( 43 \u2013 45 ). Recent studies demonstrated phenotypic tumor suppressor activity of K-Ras WT  in primary mouse AML cells and in human lung and colorectal cancer cell lines and also showed that loss of  KRAS  provided a fitness advantage and sensitized cells to MEK inhibition ( WT 40 ,  46 ). We explored this question by generating isogenic MOLM-13  KRAS  clone 24 cells that stably express dox-inducible mCherry\u2013K-Ras KO WT  and/or mCherry\u2013K-Ras G12D  and then isolating EGFP + /mCherry +  cells by sorting to ensure uniform K-Ras expression upon dox treatment. mCherry\u2013K-Ras WT  and mCherry\u2013K-Ras G12D  had similar effects in  KRAS  cells as the corresponding EGFP-tagged proteins ( KO Supplemental Figure 9 , A and B). Interestingly, mCherry\u2013K-Ras G12D  exhibited more potent pro-survival activity than did EGFP\u2013K-Ras G12D  ( Supplemental Figure 9 , A and B), which correlated with higher p-ERK and p-S6 levels ( Supplemental Figure 9C ). Next, we coexpressed mCherry\u2013K-Ras and EGFP\u2013K-Ras in  KRAS  clone 24 cells and observed similar phenotypes as with either protein alone. Specifically, cells that coexpressed EGFP\u2013K-Ras KO WT /mCherry\u2013K-Ras WT  remained sensitive to AC220 treatment, whereas approximately 90% of cells coexpressing EGFP\u2013K-Ras G12D /mCherry\u2013K-Ras G12D  were resistant to apoptosis ( Figure 4A ). Furthermore, EGFP\u2013K-Ras WT  and mCherry\u2013K-Ras WT  proteins partially antagonized the anti-apoptotic activity of EGFP\u2013K-Ras G12D  with mCherry\u2013K-Ras WT  showing more potent effects than did EGFP\u2013K-Ras WT  ( Figure 4A ). Coexpressing mCherry\u2013K-Ras WT  with either EGFP\u2013K-Ras G12D,T50I  or EGFP\u2013K-Ras G12D,T50I,E162L  only modestly reduced the potent pro-survival activities of these proteins ( Figure 4B ). Because of the low levels of apoptosis in cells expressing EGFP\u2013K-Ras G12D,T50I  and EGFP\u2013K-Ras G12D,T50I,E162L , we performed CTG analyses to compare the effects of coexpressing either mCherry\u2013K-Ras WT  or mCherry\u2013K-Ras G12D . Consistent with the CC3 data, AC220 IC 50  values were uniformly lower in cells expressing mCherry\u2013K-Ras WT  versus mCherry\u2013K-Ras G12D  ( Figure 4C ). Interestingly, coexpressing mCherry\u2013K-Ras G12D  with EGFP\u2013K-Ras T50I  or EGFP\u2013K-Ras G12D  increased calculated AC220 IC 50  values to a similar extent, which supports an unexpected trans effect of the T50I mutation in promoting resistance ( Figure 4D ). The biochemical effects of coexpressing various EGFP\u2013 and mCherry\u2013K-Ras proteins correlated with the results of CC3 and CTG assays ( Supplemental Figure 10 ). Together, these data indicate that isogenic MOLM-13  KRAS  cells are a robust system for interrogating the putative tumor suppressor activity of K-Ras KO WT  proteins. Notably, mutant K-Ras proteins that potently antagonized apoptosis and maintained effector activation upon AC220 exposure were less sensitive to inhibition by K-Ras WT  coexpression ( Figure 4, A\u2013C ).",
  "discussion": "Discussion Although key structural details of the assembly of Ras:Raf signaling complexes in solution and at the PM have emerged recently ( 13 ,  17 ,  18 ), much remains to be learned regarding Ras lateral assembly and how this might affect Raf activation. Crystal structures of H-Ras T50I  and K-Ras4b T50I  and the normal intrinsic and GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis of recombinant K-Ras4b T50I  strongly support a non-GTPase mechanism for increased signal output, as suggested by others ( 10 ). Accordingly, we reasoned that interrogating T50I and additional amino acid substitutions implicated in the putative Ras:Ras interface would provide functional insights relevant to recent models of Raf activation at the PM ( 15 ,  17 ,  18 ,  40 ,  41 ,  47 ). The general approach described here is applicable for investigating Ras functions in other cancer cell line models characterized by driver kinase mutations such as  EGFR- mutant lung adenocarcinoma and  BRAF -mutant melanoma cell lines. Our data showing that K-Ras G12D  protects MOLM-13  KRAS  cells from apoptosis upon AC220 exposure align with findings from studies of human patients with AML, showing that  KO NRAS  and  KRAS  mutations cause adaptive resistance to clinical FLT3 inhibitors ( 37 ). Whereas K-Ras T50I  had minimal effects as a single mutation, this substitution potently augmented the activity of K-Ras G12D  in phenotypic assays. This observation is consistent with extensive data indicating that germline  NRAS  and  KRAS  mutations are less activated than somatic oncogenic mutations ( 9 \u2013 11 ,  32 ). T50I enhances the oncogenic activity of K-Ras G12D  by increasing MAPK signaling, explaining the ability of this mutation to rescue impaired Raf binding by K-Ras G12D,E37G  ( 24 ). Lateral clustering of K-Ras is hypothesized to enhance Raf dimerization and MAPK pathway activation ( 43 \u2013 45 ). On the basis of structural modeling, we predicted that a third-site E162L mutation might confer additional stability to K-Ras G12D,T50I  by increasing the \u201cstickiness\u201d of the Ras:Ras interaction and thereby augmenting clustering. Our studies of isogenic MOLM-13  KRAS  cells expressing K-Ras KO G12D,T50I,E162L  support this hypothesis and align with the asymmetric Ras:Ras assembly model presented in  Supplemental Figure 1 . Informed by published data and models of Ras activation at the PM proposed by other investigators ( 15 ,  17 ,  18 ,  47 ), we speculate that T50I and E162L enhance stepwise Raf recruitment and activation by promoting G-domain\u2013mediated Ras:Ras lateral clustering and increasing local concentrations of K-Ras with a spatial organization that favors Raf binding and activation with subsequent formation (\u201ccasting\u201d) of a membrane-proximal signaling complex likely facilitated by Ras binding to the Raf-CRD as well as by the association of the Raf-CRD with the PM. Accordingly, we hypothesize that a T50I or E162L mutation increases hydrophobicity at the Ras surface, thereby promoting lateral assembly through an asymmetric interaction with another K-Ras molecule and subsequent Raf recruitment and activation ( Figure 5 ). Alternatively, and consistent with recently solved co-crystal structures of Ras bound to the Raf-RBD-CRD ( 17 ,  18 ), isoleucine 50 may stabilize the interaction between Ras and the Raf-CRD at the core of the Ras:Raf signaling complex upon formation of a stable Ras:Raf membrane-proximal monomer ( Figure 5 ). Specifically, substitution of T50 with the bulkier isoleucine would allow direct hydrophobic interactions with both F141 and F163 of Raf that could enhance binding ( Supplemental Figure 11 ). Because the affinity between Ras and the Raf-CRD is low, even a moderate improvement in binding might potentiate MAPK signaling. This idea is consistent with predictions that efficient Raf activation by Ras requires both a high-affinity interaction with the RBD and low-affinity binding to the CRD ( 19 ,  20 ). The possibilities that T50I augments asymmetric Ras lateral clustering and enhances binding to the Raf-CRD are not mutually exclusive, because the former occurs before Raf recruitment and the latter is dependent on formation of a membrane-proximal Ras:Raf monomer followed by Raf dimerization. Direct interactions between individual K-Ras molecules are not essential in this model, consistent with recent studies of Ras dimerization ( 48 ) ( Figure 5 ). In summary, we developed a versatile and disease-relevant system for interrogating the consequences of expressing mutant K-Ras proteins at physiologic levels. Using a T50I mutation found in Rasopathy developmental disorders and that overcomes the deleterious effects of an E37G substitution in leukemogenesis as a starting point for investigating non-GTPase mechanisms of Ras/MAPK activation, we integrated functional and biochemical data with recently solved, multicomponent, co-crystal structures. Together, these studies support the idea that productive MAPK activation by K-Ras is regulated by higher order complex formation and lateral assembly at the PM. The system described here will facilitate studies addressing key biologic questions such as isoform-selective Raf activation by Ras ( 47 ) and the tumor suppressor activity of WT Ras while also unveiling new therapeutic opportunities for targeting aberrant Ras/Raf/MAPK signaling in Rasopathy disorders and cancer. Furthermore, this approach can be extended to generate isogenic models for evaluating the specificity and inhibitory activity of next-generation chemical inhibitors of common oncogenic Ras proteins and for discovering how single- and second-site mutations alter sensitivity to these drugs ( 49 ,  50 ).",
