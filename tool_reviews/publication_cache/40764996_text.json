  "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis (NF) presents a significant clinical challenge due to its complex genetic basis, diverse clinical manifestation, and substantial impact on a patient's quality of life (QoL). This paper explores the multifaceted approach required to manage NF in Canada, emphasizing the integration of advanced diagnostic tools, targeted treatments, and comprehensive support systems. Healthcare providers, researchers, patient advocacy groups, and policymakers must collaborate to ensure NF patients receive the best possible care and support. This disease poses devastating consequences to families, and there has been a lack of awareness of this issue in Vancouver and, generally, in British Columbia. Currently, there is no clinic dedicated explicitly to NF in Metro Vancouver, and patients diagnosed with this disease must be flown to Toronto to get treated. The process is costly and inefficient, demanding changes. Some recent improvements in the field of NF have been noted, such as the use of gene therapy and MEK inhibitors. However, the long-term effect of this treatment is largely unknown and should be viewed with caution. This underscores the importance of enhancing psychological interventions to address the mental health challenges faced by NF patients. Specific gene sequences for different types of NF have also been mentioned in the article to offer insights on potential targets for gene-editing technology like CRISPR. Through ongoing advancements in medical science and a commitment to patient-centered care, this paper envisions significant improvements in the management and treatment of this complex condition.",

  "introduction": "Introduction NF is a rare disease in children that encompasses a group of genetic disorders that cause tumors to form on nerve tissue. The three main types are NF Type 1, NF Type 2, and Schwannomatosis. These conditions can lead to various health issues, including skin changes, bone deformities, and, in some cases, malignancies. NF Type 1 was first characterized in detail by the German pathologist Friedrich von Recklinghausen in 1882. Since then, significant progress has been made in understanding NF’s genetic and molecular basis, though treatment options remain limited [ 6 ]. Globally, NF Type 1 occurs in approximately 1 in 3000 individuals, while NF Type 2 is less common, affecting about 1 in 25,000–30,000 people [ 14 ]. In Canada, NF is classified as a rare disease, which presents unique challenges in terms of diagnosis, treatment, and support. As such, research specific to the Canadian population is crucial for developing effective healthcare policies and ensuring equitable access to treatment for affected individuals [ 2 ]. Recent studies have shown that the QoL for patients with NF in Canada can be significantly impacted, with factors such as pain and physical appearance as major predictors of mental well-being [ 11 ]. Moreover, advancements in medical research, such as the development of MEK inhibitors like Selumetinib, which have shown effectiveness in treating plexiform neurofibromas in NF Type 1 patients, are promising [ 8 ]. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of NF in Canadian patients is essential for improving treatment outcomes and developing targeted therapies.",

  "discussion": "Conclusion NF embodies a profound clinical challenge rooted in its intricate genetic foundation and diverse manifestations. In Canada, managing NF as a rare disease, particularly affecting children, necessitates a sophisticated approach, integrating advanced diagnostics, targeted therapies, and comprehensive support systems. While the healthcare framework facilitates specialized care and access to innovative treatments, hurdles like diagnostic delays, limited treatment accessibility, and socioeconomic disparities persist. The advent of targeted therapies like MEK inhibitors opens a new era of promising outcomes, and the potential of gene therapy looms on the horizon. Long-term studies, personalized medicine, and enhanced diagnostic tools are essential for future advancements. Moreover, bolstering psychosocial support is critical to improving the holistic well-being of NF patients. Through the concerted efforts of healthcare providers, researchers, patient advocates, and policymakers, there lies many hopes for transformative progress in treating and managing NF in Canada.",
