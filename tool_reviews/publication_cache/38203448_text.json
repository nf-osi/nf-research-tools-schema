  "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) stands as a prevalent neurocutaneous disorder. Approximately a quarter of NF1 patients experience the development of plexiform neurofibromas, potentially progressing into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). FT895, an HDAC11 inhibitor, exhibits potent anti-tumor effects on MPNST cells and enhances the cytotoxicity of cordycepin against MPNST. The study aims to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying FT895's efficacy against MPNST cells. Initially, our study unveiled that FT895 disrupts mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Post-FT895 treatment, reactive oxygen species (ROS) in MPNST notably increased, while mitochondrial DNA copy numbers decreased significantly. Seahorse analysis indicated a considerable decrease in basal, maximal, and ATP-production-coupled respiration following FT895 treatment. Immunostaining highlighted FT895's role in promoting mitochondrial aggregation without triggering mitophagy, possibly due to reduced levels of XBP1, Parkin, and PINK1 proteins. Moreover, the study using CHIP-qPCR analysis revealed a significant reduction in the copy numbers of promoters of the MPV17L2, POLG, TFAM, PINK1, and Parkin genes. The RNA-seq analysis underscored the prominent role of the HIF-1\u03b1 signaling pathway post-FT895 treatment, aligning with the observed impairment in mitochondrial respiration. In summary, the study pioneers the revelation that FT895 induces mitochondrial respiratory damage in MPNST cells.",

  "methods": "4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Cell Culture The S462TY cell line was a kind gift from Dr. Timothy Cripe (Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital Columbus, Columbus, OH, USA) [ 43 ]. The MPNST cell lines STS26T, T265, and ST8814 have been reported before [ 44 ] and were gifted by Dr. Nancy Ratner (Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital, Cincinnati, OH, USA). The cultures were supplemented with DMEM and 10% fetal bovine serum in a humid incubator at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO 2 . All MPNST cell lines, except STS26T, were derived from NF1 patients. STS26T is a sporadic MPNST with no known NF1 mutation [ 45 ]. Normal human Schwann cells (HSC) (ScienCell Research Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were grown on the poly-L-lysine-coated tissue culture plates. 4.2. Reactive Oxygen Species Detection To identify the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), a cell-permeable fluorescent probe, oxidized 2\u2032,7\u2032-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) (Sigma-Aldrich, Taipei, Taiwan), was used as a fluorescent ROS probe. MPNST cells treated with DMSO or 10 \u03bcM of FT895 for 24 h were loaded with 1 \u03bcM DCFDA and incubated for 20 min. The fluorescent signal of oxidized DCFDA was excited by a 488 nm laser and detected by the FITC channel in FACSverse Flow Cytometry (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). The data were analyzed by v10.8 of FlowJo\u2122 software. 4.3. Mitochondrial DNA Copy Number Genomic DNA was extracted using the Genomic DNA Kit (Geneaid Biotech Ltd., Taoyuan, Taiwan) and quantified with SpectraMax \u00ae  i3x (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). The relative DNA copy number (mitochondrial DNA to nuclear DNA) of three mitochondrial genes, ND2, ND4L, and nuclear GAPDH, was measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). The primer sets are listed as follows: ND2 forward: CATATACCAAATCTCTCCCTC, ND2 reverse: GTGCGAGATAGTAGTAGGGTC; ND4L forward: TAGTATATCGCTCACACCTC, ND4L reverse: GTAGTCTAGGCCATATGTG; GAPDH forward: GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC, GAPDH reverse: GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC. The mitochondrial copy number (mtCN) was quantified using the delta CT (\u0394CT) of mtDNA and nuclear DNA (\u0394Ct = CT [mtDNA] \u2212 CT [GAPDH]). The fold change was calculated by 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394CT . \u0394\u0394CT was determined by \u0394CT [FT895 treated] \u2212 \u0394CT [DMSO control]. 4.4. Metabolism Assay MPNST cells were plated in a Seahorse XFe24 microplate (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and allowed to adhere overnight. An XFe24 FluxPack sensor cartridge (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) is equilibrated in XF Calibrant at 37 \u00b0C overnight. Before performing the assay, cells were washed twice in a standard XF DMEM medium supplemented with pyruvate, glutamine, and glucose. Cells were then incubated in 675 \u03bcL of XF DMEM media for one hour at 37 \u00b0C with atmospheric CO 2 . The Mito Stress assay was run as described in the test kit protocol (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with 1 \u03bcM oligomycin and 0.5 \u03bcM rotenone/antimycin A. The concentration of carbonyl cyanide-4 (trifluoromethoxy)-phenylhydrazone (FCCP) for each MPNST cell line was 1 \u03bcM for S462TY, 1.5 \u03bcM for STS26T, and 2 \u03bcM for T265 and ST8814 cells. The data were collected to determine the changes in oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). The analysis was performed with Seahorse Wave Pro software (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA,  https://www.agilent.com.cn/zh-cn/product/cell-analysis/real-time-cell-metabolic-analysis/xf-software/software-download-for-seahorse-wave-pro-software , accessed on 19 December 2023). 4.5. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay and Quantitative PCR The ChIP assay was performed following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for the Pierce Magnetic ChIP Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). In brief, the chromatin extracted from the control and treated cells was digested with MNase and sheared by sonication to a size of less than 400 bp. The fragments were centrifuged (9000\u00d7  g ) at 4 \u00b0C for 5 min. Ten percent of the diluted supernatant (input) was collected and served as the control template. The sheared chromatin was immunoprecipitated with 5 \u03bcg of anti-XBP1 antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) overnight. Magnetic beads and a magnetic separation device (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were employed to pull down the protein/DNA complexes from the crude chromatin mixture. After elution, the DNA from immunoprecipitated samples and the inputs were recovered by phenol/chloroform. The input DNA and antibody-bound chromatin DNA were then subjected to quantitative PCR to quantify the DNA copy number. The primers to amplify the promoter region of the  POLG ,  MPV17L2 ,  NOTCH2 ,  PINK1 ,  PARK2  (encodes Parkin),  PPARGC1A  (encodes PGC1\u03b1), and  TFAM  genes were designed. The primer sequences are as follows:  POLG  forward: CAATCT CGCAGGGACTTGCT,  POLG  reverse: CAATGTGAACGTAGTCGCCG;  MPV17L2  forward: CCCATAGGCTGGCACAGAAA,  MPV17L2  reverse: GGCGTTCTATCCCAAGGTCG;  PINK1  forward: GGCAAGCTGCTATCTTGGGA,  PINK1  reverse: CTCAATGCCGTTAGGCTGCT;  PARK2  forward: CCTTGGCTAGAGCTGCAACA,  PARK2  reverse: TCAGGCCCAGCAATCTTACG;  PPARGC1A  forward: CGTCACGAGTTAGAGCAGCA,  PPARGC1A  reverse: TCCCCAGTCACATGACAAAGC;  TFAM  forward: TTAGGTTTGCGAATCCCCGC,  TFAM  reverse: CGTAACAGACAGTCCTGCATCC. The primer set used to quantify the mRNA level of  SLC2A1  encoding GLUT1 and housekeeping gene  GAPDH  are as follows:  SLC2A1  forward: CTGGCATCAACGCTGTCTTC,  SLC2A1  reverse: GTTGACGATACCGGAGCCAA;  GAPDH  forward: ACCCACTCCTCCACCTTTGA,  GAPDH  reverse: CTGTTGCTGTAGCCAAATTCGT. 4.6. Western Blot Equal amounts of the protein lysate from control and treated cells were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to a PVDF membrane. After blocking with 5% skim milk for one hour at room temperature, the membrane was probed with the specific primary antibody overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The primary antibodies used in the study include anti-GAPDH (Proteintech Group Inc., Rosemont, IL, USA), anti-\u03b1-tubulin (Proteintech Group Inc., Rosemont, IL, USA), anti-XBP1u (Abcepta, Reservoir Victoria, Australia), anti-XBP1s (Cell Signaling), anti-Parkin (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), anti-PINK1 (Genetex, Hsinchu, Taiwan), anti-LC3B (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), and anti-GLUT1 (Proteintech Group Inc., Rosemont, IL, USA) antibodies. Then, the membranes were washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 to remove unbound antibodies. The membrane was then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for two hours. The protein signals were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence method, and the snapshot images were captured by the UVP BioSpectrum 810 Imaging System (UVP, Cambridge, UK). 4.7. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy Cells were grown on Ibid tissue culture dishes (IB-81156, Ibidi, Gr\u00e4felfing, Germany) overnight and were treated with FT895 for 24 h. Treated cells were washed with PBS twice and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature (RT) for one minute, followed by fixing with cold methanol at \u221220 \u00b0C for 20 min. The fixed cells were blocked with PBS containing 5% fetal bovine serum for one hour at RT. For immunostaining, the primary antibodies, anti-ATP5H (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and anti-LC3 antibodies (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), were added into the wells and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The cell nuclei were stained with DAPI for 10 min at RT, and the cells were mounted using a mounting medium for microscopy. The confocal images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 880 (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). 4.8. Bulk RNA-Seq Analysis Total RNAs were isolated from the S462TY cells both with and without 6 h treatment with 10 \u00b5M FT895 by the phenol/chloroform extraction method. RNA libraries were prepared by the Illumina Truseq Stranded mRNA Kit. RNA sequencing was carried out on a NovaSeq 6000 system, and the read quality was checked with FASTQC. To align the reads, we employed HISAT2 version 2.2.1 [ 46 ] against the GRCh38 human genome. Read counts were normalized by StringTie version 2.2.1 [ 47 ]. Differential expression analysis was analyzed by DEGseq version 1.48.0 ( https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/manuals/DEGseq/man/DEGseq.pdf , accessed on 19 November 2023). For the examination of transcriptional gene set enrichment, the GSEA KEGG method with ClusterProfiler version 4.2.2 [ 48 ] was applied. We also conducted protein\u2013protein interaction analysis using STRING version 11.5 ( https://string-db.org/ , accessed on 19 November 2023). 4.9. Statistics and Data Analysis All the experimental values were presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM (standard error of the mean). The analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 9. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student\u2019s  t -test. A  p -value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.",

  "introduction": "1. Introduction Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant neurological disorder with a prevalence rate of 1 in 3500 [ 1 ]. NF1 is caused by mutations in the tumor-suppressive gene,  NF1 , which result in aberrant activation of the RAS signaling pathway [ 1 ]. The distinguishing features of NF1 include pigmentation of the skin and cutaneous neurofibromas that develop alongside peripheral nerves. These neurofibromas primarily consist of neoplastic Schwann cells, tissue matrix, and fibroblasts [ 2 ]. Approximately 25% of the NF1 patients develop one or more plexiform neurofibromas (PN) [ 3 ], which can transform into an aggressive sarcoma or malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). NF1 patients have a 5\u201313% lifetime risk of developing an MPNST [ 3 , 4 ]; however, the relative risk is higher for those patients with a large plexiform neurofibroma [ 3 , 4 ]. MPNSTs exhibit significant resistance to chemotherapy and radiation therapies. Currently, complete surgical removal remains the sole effective treatment for MPNSTs. However, surgical excision is frequently constrained by factors such as the tumor\u2019s dimensions, proximity to major blood vessels, adjacency to vital organs, or the potential for early metastatic spread. The frequent instances of recurrence and metastasis contribute to a notably low five-year survival rate among individuals with NF1-associated MPNSTs [ 5 , 6 ]. FT895 is a histone deacetylase 11 (HDAC11)-specific inhibitor with an IC 50  of 3 nM. It showed more than 1000-fold inhibitory activity for HDAC11 over other histone deacetylases (HDACs) [ 7 ]. Several studies have demonstrated the potential of using FT895 to reduce the proliferation of tumor cells in vitro. For example, FT895 effectively hindered the proliferation of JAK2-driven myeloproliferative neoplasms through the inhibition of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway [ 8 ]. Another noteworthy finding is the FT895\u2019s ability to diminish the self-renewal capacity of cancer stem cells from non-small-cell lung cancer. It effectively restrains the expansion of drug-resistant cancer stem cells by down-regulating the expression of Sox2, an essential transcription factor for maintaining pluripotency. Additionally, FT895 exerts a suppressive effect on the stemness of lung adenocarcinoma cells and decreases the viability of cells resistant to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) [ 9 ]. We recently showed a synergistic effect between cordycepin and FT895 in suppressing the proliferation of MPNST cells both in vitro and in vivo [ 10 ]. This study also revealed that the increase in MPNST cells\u2019 cordycepin sensitivity is mediated through the disruption of the Hippo signaling pathway by reducing the expression of key transcription factor TEAD1 (TEA domain transcription factor 1) and its associated protein, TAZ (TAFAZZIN, Tafazzin, phospholipid-lysophospholipid transacylase) [ 10 ]. However, the mechanisms responsible for the functional disturbance of MPNST cells following FT895 treatment remain unclear. Aside from its HDAC11 inhibitory activity, this study aims to investigate the impact of FT895 treatment on MPNST cells, particularly focusing on mitochondrial dysfunction since TAZ is involved in the synthesis of phospholipid cardiolipin, a key component of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Our findings suggest that FT895 potentially influences mitochondrial functions, resulting in a reduction in the expression of proteins associated with both its function and biogenesis. This is the first time we have demonstrated the impact of FT895 on mitochondria.",
  "results": "2. Results 2.1. Treatment of FT895 Induced the Production of Reactive Oxygen Species in MPNST Cells When cells were treated with HDAC inhibitors, the balance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants in cells was disrupted [ 11 ]. Oxidative stress can lead to cell death when the generation of ROS overwhelms the antioxidant defenses in cells. FT895 is a selective HDAC inhibitor; therefore, the initial focus to uncover the mechanism underlying FT895\u2019s synergistic effect on the cytotoxicity of cordycepin in MPNST cells is to examine the generation of ROS. One of the most straightforward methods to measure ROS is to use the permeable 2\u2032-7\u2032-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) with flowcytometry analysis. Upon subjecting four different MPNST cell lines to a 24 h treatment of 10 \u03bcM FT895, a discernible shift in the 2\u2032-7\u2032-DCFDA peak denoting the cells with accumulated ROS became evident ( Figure 1 a). Further analysis to determine the mean fluorescent intensity revealed a significant increase in ROS levels in S462TY, STS26T, and T265 cells, while a modest elevation of ROS in ST8814 cells after treatment ( Figure 1 b). To confirm whether the rise in ROS levels resulted from HDAC11 inhibition, we administered SIS17, a different selective HDAC11 inhibitor, to S462TY and STS26T. SIS17 exhibits a strong binding affinity to HDAC11, with an IC50 value of 0.83 \u00b5M, similar to FT895. Notably, it does not interfere with the activity of other HDACs, as demonstrated by Son et al. [ 12 ]. Following 24 h treatment with 10 \u00b5M SIS17, we assessed the intracellular ROS levels. The FACS data revealed no discernible shift in the SIS17-treated S462TY and STS265T cells ( Figure 1 c). Moreover, there is no significant difference in the mean fluorescent intensities of SIS17 in S463TY and STS26T cells compared to those treated with DMSO ( Figure 1 d). The acetylated histone H3 (Ac-H3) levels in MPNST cells after treatment with 10 \u03bcM of FT895 were also investigated; however, FT895 did not significantly increase the Ac-H3 level in the four MPNST cell lines ( Figure 1 e). These results indicate that the rise in ROS levels after FT895 treatment might not be attributed to HDAC11 inhibition. Instead, it is plausible that the functional alterations in mitochondria could contribute to the substantial increase in ROS production following treatment. The quantity of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA-CN) holds great potential as a biomarker for mitochondrial dysfunction [ 13 ]. We employed primer sets specifically designed to target the mitochondrial genes ND2 and ND4L regions on the mitochondrial chromosome. Following a 24 h exposure to 10 \u03bcM FT895, the levels of mtDNA-CN based on both ND2 and ND4L genes exhibited a significant reduction in all four different MPNST cells ( Figure 1 f). These findings imply a potential impact on the mitochondrial function of the MPNST cells after FT895 treatment. 2.2. FT895 Interferes with the Mitochondrial Respiration After administering the FT895 treatment, there was a notable reduction in mitochondrial DNA copies, suggesting a potential influence on mitochondrial activity and generation. To further explore the impact of FT895 on mitochondrial function, we conducted a direct assessment of mitochondrial respiration activities using the Mito Stress Test. Following a 24 h exposure to 10 \u03bcM FT895, we measured the oxygen consumption rate (OCR). As shown in  Figure 2 a, kinetic measurements showed the reduced activities of mitochondrial respiration when FT895 was administered to S462TY, T265, and ST8814 cell lines, while STS26T showed a modest alteration. Furthermore, S462TY and T265 displayed no reaction to the treatment involving an ATP synthase inhibitor, oxidative phosphorylation uncoupler, and complex I/III inhibitors, whereas STS26T and ST8814 exhibited only a partial response. Data analysis found that, in comparison to the DMSO group, the FT895 group exhibited a significant decrease in basal respiration, maximal respiration, and ATP-production-coupled respiration in four cell lines ( Figure 2 b\u2013d). When considering the data on extracellular acidification (ECAR), which reflects the acidification of the culture media due to lactate produced from glycolysis, we noted that FT895 induced a relatively less active state in S462TY and T265 cells, whereas STS26T cells became more energetically active ( Figure 2 e). Furthermore, STS8814 cells appeared to show a preference for the glycolytic pathway as their energy source following FT895 treatment. These findings imply that S462TY and T265 cells exhibit a higher sensitivity to the mitochondrial inhibition caused by FT895 compared to STS26T and ST8814 cells. Given that the OCR remained consistently low in response to 24 h FT895 treatment in S462TY and T265, we examined the impact of a shorter FT895 treatment duration on mitochondria in these cell lines. A six-hour exposure to 10 and 20 \u03bcM FT895 suppressed mitochondrial respiration in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in significant reductions in both basal and maximal respiration ( Figure 2 f\u2013h). These findings indicate that FT895 influences mitochondrial function as early as 6 h after treatment, and the effect continues at least for 24 h. 2.3. FT895 Promotes Mitochondrial Aggregation without Triggering Mitophagy To examine both the cell\u2019s characteristics and organelle integrity, we used forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) from flower cytometry to examine the impact of FT895 on cells. The FSC signal can distinguish cells based on their size, whereas the SSC signal arises from the interaction of light with intracellular structures such as granules and the nucleus, providing insights into the internal complexity or granularity of the cells. This granularity information is particularly useful for detecting any alterations in mitochondria following the treatment. While analyzing FT895-treated MPNST cells using FACS, we observed an upward shift in side scatter (SSC), particularly in S462TY cells, indicating an increase in cellular granularity (see  Figure 3 a). Mitophagy is the process responsible for removing damaged mitochondria from cells, involving the sequestration of mitochondria by autophagosomes. The presence of an elevated number of autophagosomes within cells can lead to light deflection, resulting in a high SSC signal on FACS. To explore the possible involvement of autophagosomes in S462TY after FT895 treatment, we labeled mitochondrial ATP synthase ATP5H (ATP5PD, ATP synthase peripheral stalk subunit D) and the autophagosome marker LC3B (MAP1LC3B, microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta) in S462TY cells and tracked the localization of mitochondria and autophagosomes. There was no noticeable co-localization of LC3B with mitochondria following FT895 treatment, indicating that abnormal mitophagy was not the cause of the defective mitochondria ( Figure 3 b). Instead, we observed aggregated mitochondria positioned around the nucleus periphery after FT895 treatment. This finding explains the upward shift in SSC and aligns with the previous report suggesting that apoptotic stimulation induces mitochondrial aggregation in fibrosarcoma cells [ 14 ]. 2.4. FT895 Impairs the Mitochondrial Dynamic Pathway To further study the mechanism of the disruption of mitochondrial function without triggering mitophagy by FT895, we examined the expression of PINK1 (PTEN-induced kinase 1) and Parkin (PRKN, Parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase) in FT895-treated MPNST cells. Our experiment revealed a decrease in PINK1 and Parkin protein levels in S462TY, STS26T, T265, and STS8814 cells following FT895 treatment ( Figure 4 a). These results imply that FT895 compromises the PINK1-Parkin pathway, potentially contributing to the deficiency in mitophagy. X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) is a transcription factor that undergoes activation when there is endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. This splicing event results in the formation of a spliced variant, XBP1s [ 15 ]. The XBP1s exerts control over mitophagy by regulating PINK1 expression at the transcriptional level. Additionally, PINK1-dependent phosphorylation of XBP1s influences its transcriptional activity, leading to its translocation into the nucleus [ 16 ]. Given the crucial interplay between PINK1 and XBP1s in governing mitophagy, we then evaluated the expression of XBP1 in MPNST cells treated with FT895. Notably, the mRNA sequences of unspliced (XBP1u) and spliced (XBP1s) XBP1 mRNA differ by 26 nucleotides at the 5\u2032 region, making it challenging to distinguish them accurately using quantitative PCR. However, the removal of these 26 nucleotides induces a frameshift in XBP1s, resulting in distinct amino acid sequences compared to XBP1u. To examine the XBP1 proteins in FT895-treated MPNST cells, we employed anti-XBP1u (unspliced XBP1) and anti-XBP1s antibodies. The results revealed a constant XBP1u level in MPNST cells and a decrease in the XBP1s level in S462TY, T265, and ST8814 cells after FT895 treatment ( Figure 4 b). This finding corroborates the notion that the disruption of the XBP1s-PINK1-Parkin pathway may contribute to the lack of mitophagy in FT895-treated cells. 2.5. XBP1s Regulates Mitochondria-Related Genes at the Transcriptional Level XBP1, a transcription factor, is known to modulate a range of cellular processes, including the management of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, immune responses, and the progression of tumors [ 15 , 17 ]. We further explored whether XBP1 can epigenetically modify the transcription of genes related to mitochondria. It has been found that the promoters\u2019 binding sites for XBP1s include the ACGT core and CAAT box motifs [ 18 ]. Herein, we selected the candidate genes MPV17L2, POLG, TFAM, PGC1\u03b1, PINK1, and Parkin, which are related to mitochondrial function and biogenesis, as well as the ACGT core and CAAT box motifs in the promoter region ( Figure 5 a). MPV17L2 (MPV17 mitochondrial inner membrane protein like 2) is a protein located in the inner mitochondrial membrane that interacts with the mitochondrial ribosome and facilitates mitochondrial translation [ 19 ]. POLG (DNA polymerase gamma, catalytic subunit) operates as the catalytic subunit of mitochondrial DNA polymerase, responsible for the replication of the mitochondrial genome [ 20 ]. TFAM (transcription factor A, mitochondrial) is a protein encoded in the nucleus that oversees mitochondrial transcription and the quantity of mitochondrial DNA copies [ 21 ]. PGC1\u03b1 (PPARGC1A, PPARG coactivator 1 alpha), a transcriptional co-activator, is recognized as a key regulator in the transcriptional control of mitochondrial biogenesis and quality [ 22 ]. The protein levels of XBP1s decreased in MPNST cells after FT895 treatment ( Figure 4 b). To investigate the possible XBP1s-mediated transcriptional control on MPV17L2, POLG, TFAM, PGC1\u03b1, PINK1, and Parkin genes, a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay with an XBP1s antibody was employed. This allowed us to capture DNA fragments bound to XBP1s, which were subsequently quantified through qPCR with primers that are specific for the promoter regions of the genes listed above. As shown in  Figure 5 b, the XBP1s-mediated transcriptional activities for MPV17L2, POLG, TFAM, PINK1, and Parkin notably decreased in S462TY, STS26T, and T265 cells after FT895 treatment but had no effect in ST8814 cells. Among these cell lines, only S462TY displayed reduced transcriptional activity for PGC1\u03b1 ( Figure 5 b). The mRNA expression levels of Parkin, PINK1, PGC1\u03b1, POLG, and MPV17L2 were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR. The levels of Parkin, PINK1, POLG, and MPV17L2 were significantly decreased in all four MPNST cell lines, including ST8814 ( Figure 5 c). Concerning the differential expression in ST8814, it might be a cell-line-specific phenomenon. Since several transcription factors are responsible for the regulation of PINK1 and Parkin expression, e.g., NRF2, NRF2, and NF\u03baB [ 23 , 24 , 25 ], the reduction in PINK1 and Parkin expression might be achieved by different mechanisms in ST8814 with the FT895 treatment. There is no significant difference in the expression levels of PCG1\u03b1 in T265 and ST8814 cells after FT895 treatment, albeit a significant decrease in the levels in S462TY and STS26T cells ( Figure 5 c). The reduction in promoter DNA sequences signifies a decrease in transcriptional efficiency, which may lead to impaired mitochondrial metabolism and biogenesis in the MPNST cells following FT895 treatment. The decrease in PINK1 and Parkin protein levels aligns with these findings as well ( Figure 4 a). 2.6. RNA-Seq Reveals the Gene Expression Affected by FT895 in MPNST Cells To assess the impact of FT895, we employed RNA-seq to elucidate its effects on the transcriptome. Here, we specifically selected S462TY cells due to their sensitivity to FT895. To obtain early-stage gene expression changes, the 6 h FT895 treatment was selected. The gene set enrichment analysis with ClusterProfiler demonstrated that among the top 10 KEGG pathways affected, the HIF-1\u03b1 signaling pathway featured prominently, which aligns with our observation of FT895-induced mitochondrial respiration impairment (see  Figure 6 a). Furthermore, the enrichment analysis demonstrated that FT895 treatment activated pathways associated with carbohydrate metabolism and tumor survival signaling, including fructose and mannose metabolism, as well as breast cancer-related signaling (see  Figure 6 a). Detailed information regarding these pathways can be found in  Table 1 . Using the STRING database to analyze the functional protein association networks, we identified SLC2A1, the gene encoding glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), as the central node in the network (see  Figure 6 b). Previous studies have established that activation of the HIF-\u03b1 signaling pathway leads to an increase in GLUT1 expression [ 26 ]. Further investigation of the mRNA expression of GLUT1 in MPNST cells showed increased expression in S462TY, T265, and ST8814 but not in STS26T cells after treating FT895 ( Figure 7 a). The changes in GLUT1 protein levels in MPNST cells were consistent with the mRNA expression with FT895 treatment ( Figure 7 b). These findings suggest that genes related to carbohydrate metabolism were up-regulated in response to the loss of mitochondrial function after FT895 treatment.",
  "discussion": "5. Conclusions Our findings showed that FT895 damaged MPNST cells by compromising mitochondrial functions, which resulted in increased ROS levels, a reduction in mitochondrial DNA copy numbers, and impairment of mitochondrial respiration. The mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction might result from the down-regulation of XBP1s, which controls the biogenesis and mitophagy of mitochondria at the transcriptional level. The RNA-seq analysis outlined a mechanism for the mitochondrial dysfunction post-FT895 treatment, potentially involving the HIF-1\u03b1 signaling pathway coupled with the dysregulation of glucose-energy production. These findings highlight the potential for a combined therapeutic approach utilizing FT895 alongside other drugs with different mechanisms to combat MPNST.",
