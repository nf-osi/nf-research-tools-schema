  "abstract": "In a non-selected sample of children with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) the prevalence rate of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and predictive value of an observational (ADOS)-and questionnaire-based screening instrument were assessed. Complete data was available for 128 children. The prevalence rate for clinical ASD was 10.9%, which is clearly higher than in the general population. This prevalence rate is presumably more accurate than in previous studies that examined children with NF1 with an ASD presumption or solely based on screening instruments. The combined observational- and screening based classifications demonstrated the highest positive predictive value for DSM-IV diagnosis, highlighting the importance of using both instruments in children with NF1.",
