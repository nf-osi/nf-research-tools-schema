  "abstract": "Insights into optic pathway glioma vision loss from mouse models of  neurofibromatosis type 1.  Freret ME(1), Gutmann DH(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis,  Missouri.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common cancer predisposition syndrome caused  by mutations in the NF1 gene. The NF1-encoded protein (neurofibromin) is an  inhibitor of the oncoprotein RAS and controls cell growth and survival.  Individuals with NF1 are prone to developing low-grade tumors of the optic  nerves, chiasm, tracts, and radiations, termed optic pathway gliomas (OPGs),  which can cause vision loss. A paucity of surgical tumor specimens and of  patient-derived xenografts for investigative studies has limited our  understanding of human NF1-associated OPG (NF1-OPG). However, mice genetically  engineered to harbor Nf1 gene mutations develop optic gliomas that share many  features of their human counterparts. These genetically engineered mouse (GEM)  strains have provided important insights into the cellular and molecular  determinants that underlie mouse Nf1 optic glioma development, maintenance, and  associated vision loss, with relevance by extension to human NF1-OPG disease.  Herein, we review our current understanding of NF1-OPG pathobiology and describe  the mechanisms responsible for tumor initiation, growth, and associated vision  loss in Nf1 GEM models. We also discuss how Nf1 GEM and other preclinical models  can be deployed to identify and evaluate molecularly targeted therapies for OPG,  particularly as they pertain to future strategies aimed at preventing or  improving tumor-associated vision loss in children with NF1.  © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
