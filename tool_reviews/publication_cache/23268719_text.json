  "abstract": "A neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-based bioassay-guided phytochemical investigation on Zanthoxylum armatum collected in Nepal led to the isolation of new timuramides A-D (1-4) and six known sanshools (5-10). The structures of all compounds were established by using modern spectroscopic techniques, including 1D and 2D NMR analysis and comparison with previously reported data. Most of the compounds inhibited growth of an Nf1- and p53-deficient mouse glioma cell line at noncytotoxic concentrations.",
