  "abstract": "PURPOSE: Provide an in-depth description of the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in youth diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and their families. DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were drawn from qualitative interviews conducted for a larger study aimed at developing the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory\u2122 (PedsQL\u2122) NF1 module. RESULTS: Youth with NF1 and their families experience a wide range of concerns related to HRQoL due to the varied symptom expression and uncertain trajectory of the disorder. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Pediatric nurses should routinely assess for HRQoL in this population and develop strategies tailored to those concerns that require intervention.",
