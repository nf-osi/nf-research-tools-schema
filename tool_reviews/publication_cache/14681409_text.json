Author information: (1)Lister Hill Center for Biomedical Communications, National Library of  Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Building 38A, 8600 Rockville Pike,  Bethesda, MD 20894, USA. olivier@nlm.nih.gov  The Unified Medical Language System (http://umlsks.nlm.nih.gov) is a repository  of biomedical vocabularies developed by the US National Library of Medicine. The  UMLS integrates over 2 million names for some 900,000 concepts from more than 60  families of biomedical vocabularies, as well as 12 million relations among these  concepts. Vocabularies integrated in the UMLS Metathesaurus include the NCBI  taxonomy, Gene Ontology, the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), OMIM and the  Digital Anatomist Symbolic Knowledge Base. UMLS concepts are not only  inter-related, but may also be linked to external resources such as GenBank. In  addition to data, the UMLS includes tools for customizing the Metathesaurus  (MetamorphoSys), for generating lexical variants of concept names (lvg) and for  extracting UMLS concepts from text (MetaMap). The UMLS knowledge sources are  updated quarterly. All vocabularies are available at no fee for research  purposes within an institution, but UMLS users are required to sign a license  agreement. The UMLS knowledge sources are distributed on CD-ROM and by FTP.  DOI: 10.1093/nar/gkh061 PMCID: PMC308795 PMID: 14681409 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",
