  "abstract": "Vertebrate embryogenesis requires the precisely timed specification of 3 germ cell layers- ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm- which give rise to tissues and organs in the developing organism. The tumor suppressor gene NF2, moesin-ezrin-radixin like (MERLIN) tumor suppressor (Nf2) is expressed in all 3 germ layers during mouse development and its homozygous deletion causes embryonic lethality. People with heterozygous NF2 mutations typically develop Schwann cell tumors, especially vestibular schwannoma, but the specific role of NF2 in human embryonic development is unclear. Here, human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are used to demonstrate that NF2 is essential for endoderm specification and formation in humans. Although endoderm differentiation is not impaired in hiPSCs with heterozygous NF2 mutation, NF2 knockout (NF2",
