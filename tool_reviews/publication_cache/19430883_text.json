  "abstract": "Suggested response criteria for phase II antitumor drug studies for  neurofibromatosis type 2 related vestibular schwannoma.

Author information: (1)Department of Neurology and Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital,  Boston, MA 02114, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a tumor suppressor gene syndrome characterized  by multiple schwannomas, especially vestibular schwannomas (VS), and  meningiomas. Anticancer drug trials are now being explored, but there are no  standardized endpoints in NF2. We review the challenges of NF2 clinical trials  and suggest possible response criteria for use in initial phase II studies. We  suggest two main response criteria in such trials. Objective radiographic  response is defined as a durable 20% or greater reduction in VS volume based on  post-contrast T1-weighted MRI images collected with 3 mm or finer cuts through  the internal auditory canal. Hearing response is defined as a statistically  significant improvement in word recognition scores using 50-word recorded lists  in audiology. A possible composite endpoint incorporating both radiographic  response and hearing response is outlined. We emphasize pitfalls in response  assessment and suggest guidelines to minimize misinterpretations of response. We  also identify research goals in NF2 to facilitate future trial conduct, such as  identifying the expectations for time to tumor progression and time to  measurable hearing loss in untreated NF2-related VS, and the relation of both  endpoints to patient prognostic factors (such as age, baseline tumor volume, and  measures of disease severity). These data would facilitate future use of  endpoints based on stability of tumor size and hearing, which might be more  appropriate for testing certain drugs. We encourage adoption of standardized  endpoints early in the development of phase II trials for this population to  facilitate comparison of results across trials of different agents.
