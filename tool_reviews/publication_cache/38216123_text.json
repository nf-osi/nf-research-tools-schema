  "title": "NF1 deficiency drives metabolic reprogramming in ER+ breast cancer.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: NF1 is a tumor suppressor gene and its protein product, neurofibromin, is a negative regulator of the RAS pathway. NF1 is one of the top driver mutations in sporadic breast cancer such that 27\u00a0% of breast cancers exhibit damaging NF1 alterations. NF1 loss-of-function is a frequent event in the genomic evolution of estrogen receptor (ER)+ breast cancer metastasis and endocrine resistance. Individuals with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF) - a disorder caused by germline NF1 mutations - have an increased risk of dying from breast cancer [1-4]. NF-related breast cancers are associated with decreased overall survival compared to sporadic breast cancer. Despite numerous studies interrogating the role of RAS mutations in tumor metabolism, no study has comprehensively profiled the NF1-deficient breast cancer metabolome to define patterns of energetic and metabolic reprogramming. The goals of this investigation were (1) to define the role of NF1 deficiency in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer metabolic reprogramming and (2) to identify potential targeted pathway and metabolic inhibitor combination therapies for NF1-deficient ER\u00a0+\u00a0breast cancer. METHODS: We employed two ER+ NF1-deficient breast cancer models: (1) an NF1-deficient MCF7 breast cancer cell line to model sporadic breast cancer, and (2) three distinct, Nf1-deficient rat models to model NF-related breast cancer [1]. IncuCyte proliferation analysis was used to measure the effect of NF1 deficiency on cell proliferation and drug response. Protein quantity was assessed by Western Blot analysis. We then used RNAseq to investigate the transcriptional effect of NF1 deficiency on global and metabolism-related transcription. We measured cellular energetics using Agilent Seahorse XF-96 Glyco Stress Test and Mito Stress Test assays. We performed stable isotope labeling and measured [U- RESULTS: Our results revealed that NF1 deficiency enhanced cell proliferation, altered neurofibromin expression, and increased RAS and PI3K/AKT pathway signaling while constraining oxidative ATP production and restricting energetic flexibility. Neurofibromin deficiency also increased glutamine influx into TCA intermediates and dramatically increased lipid pools, especially triglycerides (TG). Lastly, NF1 deficiency alters the synergy between metabolic inhibitors and traditional targeted inhibitors. This includes increased synergy with inhibitors targeting glycolysis, glutamine metabolism, mitochondrial fatty acid transport, and TG synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: NF1 deficiency drives metabolic reprogramming in ER+ breast cancer. This reprogramming is characterized by oxidative ATP constraints, glutamine TCA influx, and lipid pool expansion, and these metabolic changes introduce novel metabolic-to-targeted inhibitor synergies.",

IncuCyte proliferation analysis was used to measure the effect of  NF1  deficiency on cell proliferation and drug response. Protein quantity was assessed by Western Blot analysis. We then used RNAseq to investigate the transcriptional effect of  NF1  deficiency on global and metabolism-related transcription. We measured cellular energetics using Agilent Seahorse XF-96 Glyco Stress Test and Mito Stress Test assays. We performed stable isotope labeling and measured [U\u2013 13 C]-glucose and [U\u2013 13 C]-glutamine metabolite incorporation and measured total metabolite pools using mass spectrometry. Lastly, we used a Bliss synergy model to investigate  NF1 -driven changes in targeted and metabolic inhibitor synergy. 2 Methods 2.1 Generation of an  NF1  sporadic human breast cancer model To evaluate the energetic and metabolic effect of  NF1  deficiency in ER\u00a0+\u00a0sporadic human breast cancer, we utilized the ER\u00a0+\u00a0MCF7 human adenocarcinoma cell line. We targeted  NF1 's RASGAP GRD domain with clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) guides to the 21st exon and established multiple  NF1 -deficient cell lines of which one was chosen for this analysis, NF1-45 ( Figure\u00a01 A). The NF1-45 cells have a 5-bp deletion that introduces a premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated protein product after exon 21 ( Figure\u00a01 A).

Figure\u00a01 2.2 NF-related rat breast cancer models To understand the energetic and metabolic effect of  Nf1  deficiency in NF-related breast cancer, we employed our previously developed and described NF-related spontaneous rat mammary adenocarcinoma models [ 1 ]. To generate these models, we targeted  Nf1 's RASGAP GRD domain with CRISPR guides to the 20th exon. We generated three distinct  Nf1  indels in exon 20 that caused either in-frame or premature stop deletions. The  Nf1  inframe indel (Nf1-IF) rats have a 54bp deletion in exon 20 ( Figure\u00a01 B) [ 1 ]. The  Nf1  premature stop indel (Nf1-PS) rats have an 8-bp deletion in exon 20 that introduces a premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated protein product after exon 20 ( Figure\u00a01 B) [ 1 ]. The  Nf1  in-frame premature stop indel (Nf1-IFPS) rats have a 57-bp deletion in exon 20 that results in a unique messenger RNA (mRNA) isoform with an additional 140-bp deletion in exon 21 [ 1 ]. The exon n21 mRNA deletion introduces a premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated protein product after exon 21 ( Figure\u00a01 B) [ 1 ]. The IF, PS, and IFPS indels model \u201c Nf1  deficiency\u201d and induce aggressive, 100\u00a0% penetrant, multi-focal, ER/PR\u00a0+\u00a0mammary adenocarcinomas in both female and male rats [ 1 ]. To perform  in\u00a0vitro  energetic and metabolic experiments using our NF-related rat breast cancer model, we utilized isolated,  ex\u00a0vivo  rat mammary fat pad fibroblasts from each genetic background: Nf1-WT, Nf1-IF, Nf1-PS, Nf1-IFPS [ 46 ]. We also used isolated,  ex\u00a0vivo  adenocarcinoma cell lines from each of the  Nf1 -deficient rat models: Nf1-IF, Nf1-PS, Nf1-IFPS [ 46 ]. Although mammary epithelial cells (MECs) are our proposed tumor cell of origin, our isolated MECs do not passage  in\u00a0vitro , so we used isolated fibroblasts to have a rat  ex\u00a0vivo Nf1 -WT to  Nf1 -deficient control since the rat tumor cell lines do not have a  Nf1 -WT control. 2.3 Cell culture Human ER\u00a0+\u00a0MCF7 breast cancer cells (HTB-22), were grown in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) no phenol red (Gibco, Cat# 21063029), 10\u00a0% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (VWR, Cat# 1300-500), 5\u00a0mL penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco, Cat# 15070063). Rat-derived fibroblast lines were grown in DMEM/F12 no phenol red (Gibco, Cat# 15070063), 10\u00a0% FBS, and 5\u00a0mL gentamycin (Gibco, Cat# 15750060). Rat adenocarcinoma-derived tumor cell lines were grown in MEC media, which is DMEM/F12 no phenol red (Gibco, Cat# 21041-025), 10\u00a0% horse serum (Gibco, Cat# 16050-122), 20\u00a0ng/mL EGF (Sigma, Cat# E9644), 0.5ug/mL hydrocortisone (Sigma, Cat# H088), 100\u00a0ng/mL cholera toxin (Sigma, Cat# C8052), and 10ug/mL insulin (Sigma, Cat# I6634). All cells were grown at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in a 5\u00a0% CO 2  incubator. Mycoplasma testing (ATCC, Cat# 30-1012-K) every 6 months confirmed cells were not infected. 2.4 IncuCyte proliferation analysis Cells were grown in their respective medias (see section  2.3 ) and treated with 10\u00a0nM beta-estradiol (Sigma, Cat# E2758) for 48hr in a Sartorius IncuCyte. Cell proliferation was measured via cell confluency and doublings per day were calculated via the equation: Doublings per day\u00a0= (final confluency/starting confluency)/assay duration (2 days). 2.5 3-dimensional culture of cells on matrigel MCF7 cells were plated into 8-well chamber slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# 154534) at a density of 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 4  cells/well in 100uL growth-factor-reduced-Matrigel (GFR-Matrigel) (Corning, Cat# 354230). After Matrigel solidification, overlay MEC media was added (see section  2.3 ). Cells were fed with fresh MEC media every 3 days and imaged on Day 3, 6, and 10. Day 10 is shown. 2.6 RNAseq RNAseq was performed on MCF7 NF1-EV and NF1-45 cell lines using 3 biological replicates. For each technical replicate, 1.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 5  cells were plated into a well of a 6-well plate (Corning, Cat# 3506). After 24hr. RLT buffer (Rneasy kit, Qiagen, Cat# 74104) was added to each well. The RLT buffer and cells were added to an Mpbio lysing matrix E tube (Mpbio, Cat# 6914100), and cells were homogenized for 20s in an Mpbio homogenizer (Mpbio). The supernatant was transferred to a QIAshredder column (Qiagen, Cat# 79654), and an equal volume of 70\u00a0% ethanol (Pharmco, Cat# 111000200) was added to the flow-through. The flow-through and ethanol mixture was transferred to an Rneasy column and the RNA was extracted following the manufacturer's instructions. The Van Andel Genomics Core prepared RNA libraries from 500\u00a0ng of total RNA using a KAPA mRNA Hyperprep kit (v4.17, Kapa Biosystems). RNA was sheared to 300-400bp. Before amplification, cDNA fragments were ligated to IDT for Illumina TruSeq UD Indexed adapters (Illumina Inc). Library quality was assessed using Aglient DNA High Sensitivity chip (Agilent Technologies, Inc.), QuantiFluor \u00ae dsDNA System (Promega Corp.), and Kapa Illumina Library Quantification qPCR assays (Kapa Biosystems). Indexed libraries were combined and 100bp, paired-end sequences was performed using an Illumina NovaSeq6000 sequencer using a S4, 200-cycle sequencing kit (Illumina Inc.) to a depth of 70M reads per sample. Illumina RTA3 was used for base-calling, and NCS output was demultiplexed and converted to FastQ with Illumina Bcl2fastq v1.9.0. Trim Galore v0.6.0 was used to trim sequencing adapters from demultiplexed FASTQ files ( https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/ ). GENCODE was used to map FASTQ files to GRCh38 (release 33 with STAR v2.7.8a basic two-pass mode) [ 47 ]. Raw counts were extracted from reverse strand alignments, and principal component analysis was computed using iDEP 9.1. Fold change was calculated using normalized counts per million. Msigdbr [ 48 ] and clusterProfiler [ 49 ] packages were used to perform Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using 10,000 permutations and genes ranked by fold change. For the metabolism-related GSEA analysis, we manually curated a list of metabolism-related Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and REACTOME pathways from a list of all KEGG and REACTOME pathways. The data was then queried for pathways with significantly increased or decreased enrichment across 5 or more comparisons (NF1-45 vs. NF1-EV, Nf1-IF fibroblasts vs. Nf1-WT fibroblasts, Nf1-PS fibroblasts vs. Nf1-WT fibroblasts, Nf1-IFPS fibroblasts vs. Nf1-WT fibroblasts, Nf1-IF tumor vs. Nf1-WT whole mammary fat pad (MFP), Nf1-PS tumor vs. Nf1-WT whole MFP, and Nf1-IFPS tumor vs. Nf1-WT MFP). 2.7 Total protein expression Western blots Cells were grown in their respective medias (see section  2.3 ) and treated with 10\u00a0nM beta-estradiol for 48hr before lysate collection. Cells were washed with ice-cold 1X PBS (Gibco, Cat# 10010023), scraped, and lysed in Rb buffer (20\u00a0mM TrisHCL, pH 7.6; 5\u00a0mM EDTA; 150\u00a0mM NaCl; 0.5\u00a0% NP-40; 50\u00a0mM NaF; 1\u00a0mM beta-glycerophosphate) supplemented with PhosSTOP (Roche, Cat# 04906837001) and protease inhibitors (Sigma, Cat# 11873580001). Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was carried out using antibodies against neurofibromin \u2013 Bethyl (Bethyl, Cat# A300-140A, primary 1:500, secondary 1:2000), H12 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Cat# sc-376886, primary 1:500, secondary 1:2000), and iNF-07E (gifted by iNFiXion Bioscience, Biointron, Cat# B21900201, primary 1:500, secondary 1:2000) \u2013 voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) (Invitrogen, Cat# PA1-954A, primary 1:1000, secondary 1:3000), and \u03b2-tubulin (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat#2146, primary 1:500, secondary 1:2000). 2.8 ER, RAS, and PI3K esolute signaling Western blots The MCF7 cells were grown in their aforementioned media (see section  2.3 ) and treated with 10\u00a0nM beta-estradiol in DMEM no phenol red, 2\u00a0% charcoal-stripped FBS (cFBS) (Sigma, Cat# 12676029, Lot#18A392), and 5\u00a0mL penicillin-streptomycin for 24hr before lysate collection. Cells were washed with ice-cold 1X PBS, scraped, and lysed in Rb buffer supplemented with PhosSTOP and protease inhibitors. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was carried out using antibodies against neurofibromin (Bethyl), pER\u03b1 S118 (Sigma, Cat# SAB450399), Er\u03b1 E115 (Abcam, Cat# 32063), pERK T202/Y204 (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat#9101L), ERK (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat#4695S), pAKT S473 (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat#9271L), AKT (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat#9272S), and \u03b2-tubulin. 2.9 Seahorse XF-96 energetic analysis Cells were grown in their respective medias (see section  2.3 ) and treated with 10\u00a0nM beta-estradiol for 48hr before plating for the Seahorse assay. Cells were trypsinized (Gibco, Cat# 25300-054), collected, quenched, and spun down. Cells were counted with an automated BioRad cell counter (BioRad, Cat# TC20) and plated in poly- d -lysine-coated (Gibco, Cat# A38904-01) Seahorse XF-96 assay plates (Agilent, Cat# 101085-004). Cells were plated with the goal of \u223c80\u201390\u00a0% final confluency, so MCF7 cells were plated at 30,000 cells per well, fibroblasts at 5,000 cells per well, and tumor cells at 15,000 cells per well. Cells were spun down and allowed to fully adhere to the plates for 4hr at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in a 5\u00a0% CO 2  incubator. After 4hr, growth media was gently removed by pipetting, and 180\u00a0\u03bcL Seahorse XF DMEM media (Agilent, Cat# 103575-100) was added to each well. Seahorse Mito Stress Test XF DMEM assay media contained 25\u00a0mM glucose (Fischer Scientific, Cat#D16-500), 4\u00a0mM glutamine (Sigma, Cat#25030-081), and 1\u00a0mM pyruvate (Gibco, Cat#11360-070). Seahorse Glyco Stress Test XF DMEM assay media contained 4\u00a0mM glutamine. The assay was performed according to Agilent Mito Stress Test and Glyco Stress Test instructions. Extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) shown are per 5000 cells. ATP metrics were calculated following Mookerjee et\u00a0al., 2017 [ 50 ] and using the CEAS R Package [ 51 ]. 2.10 Stable isotope labeling and metabolomics For stable isotope labeling experiments with  in\u00a0vitro  MCF7 NF1-EV and NF1-45 cells, cells were grown in DMEM no phenol red, 10\u00a0% FBS, 5\u00a0mL penicillin-streptomycin, and treated with 10\u00a0nM beta-estradiol for 48\u00a0h. Cells were washed in PBS and incubated in DMEM no phenol red, no glucose, no glutamine (Gibco, Cat# A1443001), 10\u00a0% dialyzed FBS (dFBS) (Dialyzed from VWR, Cat# 1300-500), 5\u00a0mL penicillin-streptomycin, and 10\u00a0nM beta-estradiol with either 25\u00a0mM [U\u2013 13 C]-glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Cat# CLM-1396-PK) and 4\u00a0mM [U\u2013 12 C]-glutamine (Gibco, Cat# 21051-040) or 25\u00a0mM [U\u2013 12 C]-glucose (Fischer Scientific, Cat#D16-500) and 4\u00a0mM [U\u2013 13 C]-glutamine (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Cat# CLM-1822-H-PK) for 2\u00a0h. After 2hr, cells were washed 2X with ice-cold NaCl saline (Gibco Cat# S8776), snap-frozen on dry ice, and stored at\u00a0\u221280\u00a0\u00b0C. Metabolites were extracted using a modified Bligh Dyer method [ 52 ]. This modified Bligh Dyer extraction involves the addition of ice-cold methanol (Fisher Chemical, Cat# A456-4) to the cell plate (Corning, Cat# 3506) from which cells are scraped and transferred to an Eppendorf tube containing ice-cold chloroform (Millipore Sigma, Cat# 1024441000) and water (Fisher Chemical, Cat# W6-4), with a final v/v ratio of 2:2:1.8 methanol to chloroform to water. The cell extract was then vortexed for 10\u00a0s and incubated on wet ice for 30\u00a0min. The samples were then vortexed again for 10\u00a0s and spun down at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min at 13,000rpm to achieve aqueous and organic phase separation. The aqueous and organic phases were collected and dried down in a speedvac. 2.11 LC-MS method (aqueous) For liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis, the aqueous dry-down was resuspended in 50\u00a0\u03bcL of 50:50 acetonitrile (Fisher Scientific, Cat# A955) and water. The resuspended metabolite extracts were analyzed on an Orbitrap ID-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a Thermo Vanquish Horizon LC system. Each sample injection was 2\u00a0\u03bcL. The Van Andel Institute Mass Spectrometry Core performed chromatographic separation using Acquity BEH Amide (1.7\u00a0\u03bcm, 2.1\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0150\u00a0mm) analytical columns (Waters, Eschborn, Germany, Cat#176001909). These columns were fitted with a pre-guard column (Waters, 1.7\u00a0\u03bcm, 2.1\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05\u00a0mm; Cat# 186004799) and used an elution gradient with two solvents. Solvent A was LC/MS grade water, and Solvent B was 90\u00a0% LC/MS grade acetonitrile. For negative mode analysis, both mobile phases contained 10\u00a0mM ammonium acetate (Millipore Sigma, Cat# 73594-100G-F), 0.1\u00a0% ammonium hydroxide (Fisher Scientific, Cat# A470-250), and 5\u00a0\u03bcM medronic acid. For positive mode analysis, both mobile phases included 10\u00a0mM ammonium formate and 0.1\u00a0% formic acid (Fisher Chemical, Cat# A11710X1-AMP). The 20-minute gradient at 400\u00a0\u03bcL/min consisted of the following phases: 0\u20131.0\u00a0min (100\u00a0% B to 90\u00a0% B), 1.0\u201312.5\u00a0min (90\u00a0% B to 75\u00a0% B), 12.5\u201319\u00a0min (75\u00a0% B to 60\u00a0% B), and 19\u201320\u00a0min (60\u00a0% B). After each run, the column was re-equilibrated over 20\u00a0min. The column temperature was maintained at 40\u00a0\u00b0C. The heated electrospray ionization (H-ESI) source used a spray voltage of\u00a0\u22122500\u00a0V (negative mode) or 3500\u00a0V (positive mode). The isotopically labeled experimental replicates were collected in full-scan mode with an MS1 scan range from 70 to 1000\u00a0 m / z , a mass resolution of 120,000 FWHM, RF lens at 35\u00a0%, and automatic gain control. The unlabeled samples were used for data-dependent MS2 (ddMS2) fragmentation and were annotated using AquireX workflow. ddMS2 data was obtained with MS1 resolution set at 60,000, MS2 resolution at 30,000, an intensity threshold of 2.0 x 104, and dynamic exclusion activated after a single trigger for a duration of 10\u00a0s. MS2 fragmentation comprised HCD at 20\u00a0%, 35\u00a0%, and 50\u00a0% collision energies, which was followed by CID at 15\u00a0%, 30\u00a0%, and 45\u00a0% with an activation Q of 0.25. Both MS2 scans used standard automatic gain control and a maximum injection time of 54\u00a0ms. The total cycle time for MS1 and ddMS2 scans was 0.6\u00a0s. 2.12 LC-MS method (organic) The organic dry-down was resuspended in 50\u00a0\u03bcL of 50:50 isopropanol (Fisher Scientific, Cat# A461-4):water. The resuspended metabolite extracts were analyzed on an Orbitrap ID-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a Thermo Vanquish Horizon LC system. Each sample injection was 2\u00a0\u03bcL. The Van Andel Institute Mass Spectrometry Core performed chromatographic separation using C30 (2.6\u00a0\u03bcm, 2.1\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0150\u00a0mm) analytical columns (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# 27826\u2013152130). These columns were fitted with a pre-guard column (1.7\u00a0\u03bcm, 2.1\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05\u00a0mm; Waters, Cat# 186004799) and used an elution gradient with two solvents. Solvent A was 60\u00a0% acetonitrile, 40\u00a0% water, 0.1\u00a0% formic acid, 10\u00a0mM ammonium formate (Fisher Scientific, Cat# A11550), and Solvent B was 90\u00a0% isopropanol, 8\u00a0% acetonitrile, 2\u00a0% water, 0.1\u00a0% formic acid, 10\u00a0mM ammonium formate. The 30-minute gradient at 400\u00a0\u03bcL/min consisted of the following phases: 0\u20131.0\u00a0min (75%A), 1.0\u20133.0\u00a0min (75%A to 60%A), 3\u201319\u00a0min (60%A to 25%A), 19\u201320.5\u00a0min (25\u00a0% A to 10\u00a0% A), 20.5\u201328\u00a0min (10\u00a0% A to 5\u00a0% A), and 28.1\u201330\u00a0min (5\u00a0%\u20130%A). After each run, the column was re-equilibrated over 15\u00a0min. The column temperature was maintained at 50\u00a0\u00b0C. The heated electrospray ionization (H-ESI) source used a spray voltage of\u00a0\u22122800\u00a0V (negative mode) or 3250\u00a0V (positive mode). The isotopically labeled experimental replicates were collected in full-scan mode with an MS1 scan range from 200 to 1000\u00a0 m / z , a esoluteion of 240,000 FWHM, RF lens at 45\u00a0%, and automatic gain control. The unlabeled samples were used for data dependent MS3 (ddMS3) fragmentation. ddMS2 scans were collected with HCD fragmentation settings (Assisted Collision Energy Mode, Normalized HCD Collision Energies at 15\u00a0%, 30\u00a0%, 45\u00a0%, 75\u00a0%, and 110\u00a0% energy levels, Orbitrap resolution: 15,000). A  m / z  184 mass trigger, indicative of phosphatidylcholines, was used for CID fragmentation (Collision energy: 35\u00a0%, activation time: 10\u00a0ms, Orbitrap resolution: 15,000). CID MS3 scans were triggered by specific acyl chain losses for detailed analysis of mono-, di-, and tri-acylglycerides (Collision energy: 35\u00a0%, activation time: 10\u00a0ms, Ion trap detection at Rapid Scan Rate). 2.13 LC-MS data analysis Lipid identifications were assigned using LipidSearch (v5.0, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Data was analyzed using Compound Discoverer (v 3.2, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Compounds were identified via retention compared external standards and MS2 spectral matching using the mzCloud database (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Mass isotopologue distribution analysis was performed using isotopologue peak area data from labeled and unlabeled samples, natural abundance correction was performed using an internal VAI matrix-based algorithm like those described in Fernandez et\u00a0al., 1996 and Trefely et\u00a0al., 2016. PCA analysis was performed using the FactoMineR R package. 2.14 FBS dialysis To deplete glucose and glutamine from the FBS used during stable isotope labeling, we prepared dialyzed FBS. In short, FBS was pipetted into SnakeSkin\u2122 Dialysis Tubing, 10K MWCO, 35\u00a0mm, 10.5m (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# 88245). The tubing was clamped closed using SnakeSkin Dialysis clips (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# 68011). The FBS-containing dialysis tubing was suspended in 1X PBS (1:300 ratio of FBS:PBS) using a foam Eppendorf tube holder. The PBS was stirred around the FBS-containing tubing using a magnetic stir bar and stir plate for 2hr at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, after which the PBS was discarded and replaced. The PBS was then stirred around the FBS-containing tubing for 3hr at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, after which the PBS was discarded and replaced. Lastly, the PBS was stirred around the FBS-containing tubing for 18\u201320hr at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, after which the FBS was pipetted out of the tubing, filtered with a 0.22\u00a0\u03bcM filter (VWR, Cat# 28145-501), aliquoted, and stored at\u00a0\u221220\u00a0\u00b0C. In total, the FBS was dialyzed against 1X PBS for approximately 24hr. Mass spectrometry was used to confirm metabolite depletion ( Supplementary Fig.\u00a02 ). 2.15 Targeted and metabolic inhibitor  in\u00a0vitro  drug studies MCF7 cells were grown in DMEM no phenol red, 10\u00a0% FBS, 5\u00a0mL penicillin-streptomycin and treated with 10\u00a0nM beta-estradiol and the targeted and/or metabolic inhibitors for 48hr in a Sartorius IncuCyte: Tamoxifen (4OHT) (Sigma, Cat# H7904), Cobimetinib (COB) (Genentech, gifted), Everolimus (EVE) (Selleckchem, Cat# S1120), 2-Deoxy- d -glucose (2DG) (Sigma, Cat# D8375), bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide (BPTES) (Cayman Chemical Company, Cat# 19284), Etomoxir (EX) (Cayman Chemical Company, Cat# 11969), PF-04620110 (Cayman Chemical Company, Cat# 16425), PF-06424439 (Cayman Chemical Company, Cat# 17680). Cell proliferation was measured via cell confluency and doublings per day were calculated via the equation: Doublings per day\u00a0= (final confluency/starting confluency)/assay duration (2 days). Synergy was calculated using the SynergyFinder R package.",

  "introduction": "1 Introduction Recent genomic analyses have identified that the tumor suppressor gene neurofibromin 1  (NF1)  is a driver of inherited breast cancer, sporadic breast cancer, and endocrine resistance [ [2] ,  [3] ,  [4] ,  [5] ,  [6] ,  [7] ,  [8] ,  [9] ]. The  NF1  gene product, neurofibromin, is a primary human rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (RAS) GTPase activating protein (GAP) and negatively regulates RAS pathway signaling. Neurofibromin's GAP-related domain (GRD) binds RAS and stimulates RAS GTPase activity [ 1 , 10 ]. Germline  NF1  mutations cause Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF), the most common autosomal dominant single-gene disorder, affecting 1:3000 live births [ 10 ]. Both men and women with NF have an increased risk of dying from breast cancer [ [11] ,  [12] ,  [13] ,  [14] ]. Women <40 years old with NF have a 6.5-fold increased risk of breast cancer and a 2-fold higher lifetime risk of breast cancer compared to the general population [ 13 ]. NF-related breast cancer is associated with adverse prognostic factors and decreased overall survival compared to sporadic breast cancer [ 11 , 12 , 15 ]. Recent studies have revealed that  NF1  is a genetic driver of sporadic breast cancer [ 2 , 8 , 9 ], and  NF1  shallow deletions are present in up to 27\u00a0% of breast cancers [ 1 ]. Moreso,  NF1  loss-of-function mutation is a frequent event in the evolution of endocrine-resistant estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer [ 4 , 16 ]. RAS signaling is hyperactivated in approximately 50\u00a0% of tumors, but RAS mutations are only found in 4\u00a0% of breast cancers, suggesting that  NF1  loss of function may be driving many RAS-active breast cancers [ 17 , 18 ]. Because mutations and indels are detected throughout the  NF1  gene and all lead to variable levels of loss of function, we refer to these states of altered neurofibromin function as \u201c NF1  deficiency\u201d [ 10 , 19 ]. The results in both NF-related and sporadic breast cancer emphasize the impact of  NF1  deficiency and deregulated RAS in breast cancer and in resistance to endocrine therapy. Activated oncogenes and inactivated tumor suppressors contribute to tumorigenesis by reprogramming cellular energetics and metabolism towards macromolecular synthesis \u2013 a phenomenon termed \u201cmetabolic reprogramming\u201d [ 20 , 21 ]. A canonical example of cancer metabolic reprogramming is the Warburg Effect, defined as a shift towards aerobic glycolysis to support biosynthetic processes [ 20 , 22 , 23 ]. Metabolic reprogramming can introduce novel therapeutic targets [ 20 , [24] ,  [25] ,  [26] ,  [27] ,  [28] ,  [29] ,  [30] ,  [31] ]. It is well established that RAS-activating mutations drive metabolic programming and introduce energetic and metabolic dependencies that can be therapeutically exploited [ [24] ,  [25] ,  [26] ,  [27] ,  [28] ,  [29] ,  [30] ,  [31] ]. For example,  RAS -mutant cells are vulnerable to glutamine depletion and autophagy inhibition [ 29 , [32] ,  [33] ,  [34] ]. Targeting RAS-driven metabolic reprogramming can also sensitize cells to targeted pathway inhibitors, demonstrating therapeutic synergy between metabolic and non-metabolic inhibitors [ 27 , 29 ]. Despite numerous studies interrogating the role of RAS mutation in tumor metabolism, no study has investigated  NF1 -driven metabolic reprogramming in breast cancer. Of the limited number of  NF1 -related metabolic analyses, most have been done in  NF1  knock-out (KO) systems. Although valuable, KO models don't account for RASGAP-independent effects. Neurofibromin's GRD accounts for only 10\u00a0% of the total neurofibromin protein, but many studies assume functional equivalence between  NF1  KO and GRD inactivation. Additionally, mutations throughout the  NF1  gene are NF and cancer-causal despite differential RASGAP effect. This data taken together underscores the utility of  NF1  mutational analyses.  NF1 - KO models have been shown to decrease mitochondrial respiration [ 35 , 36 ], increase nutrient scavenging [ 37 , 38 ], increase lipid droplets [ 39 ], increase resting energy expenditure [ 40 ], and induce a switch from carbohydrate to lipid catabolism [ 39 , 40 ]. In non-breast cancer models,  NF1 -mutation has been shown to increase glutamine [ 41 ] and \u03b2-oxidation dependence [ 42 ]. Additionally, individuals affected by NF have lower fasting blood glucose, lower body mass indexes, increased lipid oxidation, and decreased carbohydrate catabolism compared to controls [ [43] ,  [44] ,  [45] ]. These analyses underscore the necessity of defining and targeting  NF1 -driven metabolic reprogramming in breast cancer. The goals of this investigation were (1) to define the role of  NF1  deficiency in ER\u00a0+\u00a0breast cancer metabolic reprogramming and (2) to identify potential targeted pathway and metabolic inhibitor combination therapies for  NF1 -deficient ER\u00a0+\u00a0breast cancer. Our results revealed that  NF1  deficiency enhanced cell proliferation, altered neurofibromin isoform expression, and increased RAS and PI3K/AKT pathway signaling while constraining oxidative adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and restricting energetic flexibility.  NF1  deficiency also increased glutamine influx into TCA intermediates and dramatically increased lipid pools, particularly triglycerides (TG). Lastly, we demonstrate that  NF1  deficiency is associated with a synergistic response to a combination of RAS pathway and TG synthesis inhibitors in clinically relevant breast cancer models.",
  "results": "3 Results 3.1 NF1  deficiency increases cell proliferation and increases RAS and PI3K/AKT pathway signaling To evaluate the metabolic effect of  NF1  mutation in ER\u00a0+\u00a0sporadic human breast cancer, we designed and employed a novel  NF1- deficient ER\u00a0+\u00a0MCF-7 human adenocarcinoma cell line model, NF1-45 ( Figure\u00a01 A). The NF1-45 cells have a 5-bp GRD deletion that introduces a premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated protein product after exon 21 ( Figure\u00a01 A). To evaluate the metabolic effect of  NF1  deficiency in an NF context, we derived  ex\u00a0vivo  fibroblast and mammary adenocarcinoma cell lines from our previously described  Nf1 -deficient rat models [ 1 ]. The  Nf1  in-frame indel (Nf1-IF) rats have a 54bp deletion in exon 20 ( Figure\u00a01 B) [ 1 ]. The  Nf1  premature stop indel (Nf1-PS) rats have an 8-bp deletion in exon 20 that introduces a premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated protein product after exon 20 ( Figure\u00a01 B) [ 1 ]. The  Nf1  in-frame premature stop indel (Nf1-IFPS) rats have a 57-bp deletion in exon 20 that results in a unique messenger RNA (mRNA) isoform with an additional 140-bp deletion in exon 21 [ 1 ]. The exon n21 mRNA deletion introduces a premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated protein product after exon 21 [ 1 ]. The  Nf1  IF, PS, and IFPS indels model \u201c Nf1  deficiency\u201d and induce aggressive, penetrant, multi-focal, ER/PR\u00a0+\u00a0mammary adenocarcinomas in both female and male rats. The Nf1-PS rats have the earliest onset tumors (8 weeks), followed by Nf1-IFPS (10 weeks), followed by Nf1-IF (1 year). Before performing energetic and metabolic analyses, we aimed to characterize our novel MCF7, fibroblast, and tumor cell lines. To evaluate the impact of  NF1 -deficiency on cell proliferation, cells were grown for 48hr with 10\u00a0nM estradiol (E2) in a Sartorius IncuCyte, and cell doublings were measured via confluence over time. Of note, unless otherwise stated, all assays were conducted in the presence of estradiol to better replicate an  in\u00a0vivo  environment. Compared to  NF1 -WT controls (NF1-EV and Nf1-WT),  NF1 -deficient cells proliferate faster in 2D ( Figure\u00a01 C). When compared to the NF1-EV control, NF1-45 developed larger 3D spherical colonies, indicating greater tumor potential ( Figure\u00a01 D). Since neurofibromin is the primary RAS-GAP, alteration of neurofibromin leads to dysregulated RAS-pathway signaling, and RAS pathway signaling can activate the parallel PI3K-AKT pathway ( Figure\u00a01 E). Neurofibromin can also indirectly activate and directly inhibit ER signaling and alter cellular localization ( Figure\u00a01 E) [ 53 ]. Given the relationship between, neurofibromin, ER, RAS, and PI3K-AKT signaling, we performed western blot analysis to characterize neurofibromin expression and ER, RAS, and PI3K-AKT signaling ( Figure\u00a01 F and G). Neurofibromin expression was evaluated using several distinct antibodies that recognize the 125\u00a0kDa and 250\u00a0kDa isoforms in human and rat cells ( Figure\u00a01 F,  Supplementary Fig.\u00a01 ). In the MCF7 cells,  NF1  deficiency resulted in decreased expression of the neurofibromin 250\u00a0kDa isoform ( Figure\u00a01 F). Next neurofibromin expression was measured in mammary tumor cells and mammary fibroblast cells isolated from the  Nf1 -deficient rat model. Similar to what we previously observed, the 125\u00a0kDa isoform was strongly expressed in the  Nf1 -deficient mammary tumor cells, whereas in the  Nf1 -deficient mammary fibroblasts we observed a decrease in the 250\u00a0kDa isomer [ 1 ]. When we measured ER signaling via phosphorylation at the ERK activation-associated S118 site, we saw that NF1-45 cells had decreased active and total ER\u03b1 activation at baseline and following estradiol (E2) stimulation ( Figure\u00a01 G). Conversely, when we evaluated ERK signaling, we found that  NF1  deficiency dramatically increased active T202/Y204-phosphorylated ERK, which is indicative of increased RAS-pathway signaling ( Figure\u00a01 G). We then probed against the activation-associated AKT S473 phosphorylation sites and saw a modest increase in PI3K-AKT pathway signaling ( Figure\u00a01 G). To summarize our phenotyping results,  NF1  deficiency increases 2D and 3D cell proliferation, alters neurofibromin isoform expression, decreases ER signaling, and increases RAS and AKT signaling. 3.2 NF1  deficiency alters global transcription and metabolism-related transcriptomic networks To better understand the impact of  NF1  deficiency on global and metabolism-related transcription, we performed RNAseq and utilized principal component analysis (PCA) to visualize the variability across  NF1 -WT and  NF1 -deficient cells ( Figure\u00a02 A). PCA displayed the global shift in gene expression in the  NF1 -deficient cells compared to the  NF1 -WT controls ( Figure\u00a02 A). To evaluate the effect of  NF1  deficiency on metabolism-related transcription, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). We queried the data for metabolism-related KEGG and REACTOME pathways that significantly increased or decreased in enrichment across our  NF1 -deficient models. We found that  NF1  deficiency altered oxidative phosphorylation-related (OXPHOS) transcription ( Figure\u00a02 B), a finding that is phenotypically paralleled in our energetic analyses ( Figure\u00a03 ). We also found that  NF1  deficiency decreased fatty acid (FA) metabolism, membrane lipid production-related transcription, and branched-chain amino acid degradation-related transcription ( Figure\u00a02 B). Our RNAseq analysis demonstrates that  NF1  indels alter metabolism in breast cancer. Next, we sought to define the impact of  NF1  mutations on cellular energetics (glycolysis and OXPHOS) and amino acid and lipid metabolism. Figure\u00a02  A)  NF1  deficiency alters global transcription and metabolism-related transcriptomic networks. NF1 -deficient cells are transcriptionally distinct across cell types and models (n\u00a0=\u00a03). PCA coordinates were generated using iDEP 9.1. B)  NF1  deficiency alters the metabolic transcriptome. GSEA enrichment analysis for metabolism-related KEGG and Reactome pathways. Each bubble represents the pathway enrichment score for each  NF1 -deficient vs.  NF1 -WT comparison. The list of metabolism-related KEGG and REACTOME pathways was manually curated from a list of all KEGG and REACTOME pathways in all models. Figure\u00a02 Figure\u00a03  A)  NF1  deficiency constrains oxidative ATP production. NF1  deficiency decreases basal and maximal OCR across models. Monensin is an ionophore that pushes cells to the maximal glycolytic range. 2DG is a competitive hexokinase inhibitor. Oligomycin (oligo) is a complex V inhibitor, fluoro-carbonyl cyanide phenylhydrazone (FCCP) is an uncoupling agent, and rotenone and antimycin A (Rot/AntiA) are complex I and complex III inhibitors, respectively.

Tumor cells: n\u00a0=\u00a02, 28 technical replicates per biological replicate.

E)  NF1  deficiency restricts OXPHOS JATP production. JATP values were calculated using CEAS (R Package). The bar represents the geometric mean, and the black, horizontal lines represent the 95\u00a0% confidence interval boundaries. MCF7: n\u00a0=\u00a02, 12 technical replicates per biological replicate.

F)  NF1  deficiency impacts OCR without altering total mitochondrial load as measured by Western blot analysis of voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) expression. Immunoblotting was carried out using antibodies against VDAC and \u03b2-tubulin. Figure\u00a03 3.3 NF1  deficiency constrains oxidative ATP production Cellular energetics describes how energy is captured and used by cells. Our analysis focused on core aspects of energy metabolism: glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), and the electron transport chain (ETC). To measure cellular energetics in real-time, we used the Seahorse XF-96 Mito Stress Test and Glyco Stress Test assays. The Seahorse machine has two main outputs: extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR). ECAR measures media acidification and is a proxy of glycolysis. OCR measures media oxygen depletion and is a proxy of OXPHOS (O 2  is the final electron transport chain [ETC] electron acceptor). Cellular energetics were modulated using the following compounds: glucose (glc) is a substrate for glycolysis, monensin is an ionophore, 2-deoxy- d -glucose (2DG) is a competitive hexokinase inhibitor, oligomycin (oligo) is a complex V inhibitor, fluoro-carbonyl cyanide phenylhydrazone (FCCP) is an uncoupling agent, and rotenone and antimycin A (Rot/AntiA) are complex I and complex III inhibitors, respectively. Across our human and rat models,  NF1  deficiency decreased basal and maximal OXPHOS ( Figure\u00a03 A). When we calculated the ATP produced from glycolysis and OXPHOS and visualized those values in two dimensions, we found that  NF1  deficiency restricted energetic flexibility ( Figure\u00a03 B). Despite oxidative constraints, only NF1-45 cells have glycolytic \u201ccompensation\u201d at basal conditions, but all  NF1 -deficient lines have smaller max bioenergetic scopes, a metric calculated by multiplying the JATP glycolysis x JATP OXPHOS ( Figure\u00a03 C). Bioenergetic scope describes the theoretical energetic space in which a cell can operate, so the larger the bioenergetic scope, the greater the energetic flexibility. When we compared  NF1 -WT and  NF1 -deficient ATP production from glycolysis and OXPHOS, we found that  NF1 -deficient cells have decreased OXPHOS ATP production ( Figure\u00a03 D,E). Of note, not all  NF1 -deficient models had negative or significant Reactome respiratory electron transport and KEGG oxidative phosphorylation gene set enrichment scores despite their OXPHOS deficit ( Figure\u00a02 B). These divergent RNAseq and OCR data harken to a fundamental question within the ETC field; how are the transcription, translation, assembly, and oxidative function of ETC proteins related? To understand whether this decrease in OXPHOS capacity was due to a decrease in total mitochondrial load, we performed Western Blot analysis and analyzed voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) expression. When we compared our  NF1 -deficient models to their WT controls, we saw no appreciable difference in VDAC expression ( Figure\u00a03 F). 3.4 NF1  deficiency increases intracellular lipid pools To define the  NF1 -deficient metabolome, we performed untargeted metabolomics and stable isotope labeling. We compared intracellular metabolite pools, labeled pool sizes (PS), and labeled pool fractional enrichment (FE) between  NF1 -WT and  NF1 -deficient MCF7 cells and visualized this difference with PCA analysis ( Figure\u00a04 A). Across all queries,  NF1 -deficient cells are distinct, and this difference is most pronounced when comparing total metabolite pools ( Figure\u00a04 A). Because we detected an  NF1 -driven OXPHOS loss, we wanted to understand how glucose and glutamine were incorporated into TCA intermediates via mass isotopologue distribution. [U\u2013 13 C]-glucose TCA incorporation is facilitated by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and pyruvate carboxylase (PC), which respectively catalyze the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. [U\u2013 13 C]-glucose TCA entry via PDH leads to M+2 TCA intermediates, while entry via PC leads to M+3 TCA intermediates ( Figure\u00a04 B). [U\u2013 13 C]-glutamine is incorporated into glutamate and \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1-KG) as M+5, and \u03b1-KG oxidation leads to M+4 TCA labeling and reductive carboxylation results in M+3 TCA metabolites except for citrate, which is M+5 ( Figure\u00a04 D). When we compared the ratio of M+3 glutamate to M+5 glutamate, we observed no difference between NF1-EV and NF1-45 cells, suggesting no difference in the rate of TCA cycling ( Supplementary Fig.\u00a02D ). When we compared relative glucose incorporation into TCA intermediates via oxidative and reductive pathways, we found a small but significant decrease in glucose incorporation in NF1-45 cells ( Figure\u00a04 C). Conversely, when we compared the relative glutamine incorporation into TCA intermediates via oxidative and reductive pathways, we saw a small but significant increase in glutamine incorporation in the NF1-45 cells ( Figure\u00a04 E). This data suggests a small but statistically significant  NF1 -driven shift in TCA carbon source from glucose to glutamine. We next analyzed the total aqueous and organic metabolite pools and determined that  NF1  deficiency increased select TCA and REDOX intermediates and increased levels of many lipid species, particularly triglycerides (TG) ( Figure\u00a04 F). This  NF1 -dependent increase in intracellular TG is consistent with previous findings in  NF1 -deficient muscle cells [ 39 ]. Next, we wanted to understand the impact of  NF1  deficiency on lipid class pools, and we found an increase in lipid levels across all classes except phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylserine (PS), and sphingomyelin (SM) ( Figure\u00a04 G).

Figure\u00a04 3.5 NF1  mutation increases synergy between RAS pathway and triglyceride synthesis inhibitors We next wanted to understand if metabolic inhibitors targeting NF1-driven metabolic changes synergize with traditional targeted inhibitors in  NF1 -deficient ER\u00a0+\u00a0breast cancer cells. For targeted RAS and PI3K/AKT inhibitors, we evaluated the antiproliferative effects of Tamoxifen (4OHT), Cobimetinib (COB), and Everolimus (EVE) ( Figure\u00a01 E;  Supplementary Fig.\u00a03A ). For metabolic inhibitors, we evaluated the antiproliferative effects of the following metabolic inhibitors: 2DG, bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide (BPTES), Etomoxir (EX), PF-04620110 (DGAT1i), and PF-06424439 (DGAT2i) ( Figure\u00a05 A). We tested the glycolysis inhibitor, 2DG, because we saw increased glycolysis in NF1-45 cells ( Figure\u00a03 D). 2DG inhibits glycolysis via competitive hexokinase inhibition, so we anticipated increased 2DG sensitivity in NF1-45 cells. We tested the glutaminase (GLS) inhibitor, BPTES, because we saw increased glutamine incorporation into TCA intermediates in NF1-45 cells ( Figure\u00a04 E). GLS catalyzes the conversion of glutamine to glutamate, and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) catalyzes the conversion of glutamate to \u03b1-ketoglutarate, which can then enter the TCA cycle, so we anticipated increased BPTES sensitivity in NF1-45 cells. We next tested the carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1) inhibitor, Etomoxir (EX), because we saw increased palmitoyl and oleoyl carnitine (AcCa) species, intermediates in mitochondrial FA transport, in NF1-45 cells ( Figure\u00a04 G). This increase in AcCa species suggested increased or impeded mitochondrial FA transport, a process facilitated by CPT1, so we anticipated increased Etomoxir sensitivity in NF1-45 cells. Lastly, we chose to test the diacylglycerol o-acyltransferase 1 and 2 (DGAT1, DGAT2) inhibitors, PF-04620110 (DGAT1i), and PF-06424439 (DGAT2i), because we saw a \u223c2.5X increase in total TG species in NF1-45 cells ( Figure\u00a04 G). DGATs catalyze the final step in TG synthesis, so we anticipated increased DGAT1i and DGAT2i sensitivity in NF1-45 cells. Because DGAT2 had \u223c2X higher expression than DGAT1 in MCF7 cells, we chose to test DGAT2i as a single agent and DGAT1/2i in combination ( Supplementary Fig.\u00a03B ). When comparing single-agent antiproliferative effects, we found that NF1-45 cells were more sensitive to ER\u03b1 inhibition by 4OHT, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibition by COB, and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition by EVE ( Figure\u00a05 B). NF1-45 cells were also more sensitive to each metabolic inhibitor tested ( Figure\u00a05 B). Next, we combined each targeted and metabolic inhibitor to investigate genotype-driven synergy changes using a Bliss Synergy model and the SynergyFinder R package ( Figure\u00a05  and  Supplementary Figs.\u00a03C\u2013G ). A synergy score of less than\u00a0\u221210 indicates that the drug-drug interaction is likely antagonistic, a synergy score between\u00a0\u221210 and 10 indicates that the drug-drug interaction is likely additive, and a synergy score greater than 10 indicates that the drug-drug interaction is likely synergistic [ 54 ]. When we evaluated 2DG synergy with RAS, ER, and PI3K/AKT inhibitors, we saw a \u223c1.5X  NF1 -dependent increase in synergy between 2DG and 4OHT, COB, and EVE ( Figure\u00a05 C,  Supplementary Fig.\u00a03C ). This  NF1 -dependent increase in 2DG-targeted inhibitor synergy could be due to increased glycolytic glucose use, but the loss of lipid, nucleotide, and TCA precursor species could also account for  NF1 -driven synergy. When we evaluated BTPES synergy with RAS, ER, and PI3K/AKT inhibitors, we saw \u223c2X more synergy between BPTES and 4OHT and \u223c3.5X more synergy between BPTES and COB in the  NF1 -deficient NF1-45 cells ( Figure\u00a05 D,  Supplementary Fig.\u00a03D ). When we evaluated Etomoxir synergy with RAS, ER, and PI3K/AKT inhibitors, we saw \u223c1.5X more synergy Etomoxir and 4OHT, \u223c2X more synergy between Etomoxir and COB, and a small increase in synergy between Etomoxir and EVE in NF1-45 cells ( Figure\u00a05 E,  Supplementary Fig.\u00a03E ). When we evaluated DGAT2i synergy with RAS, ER, and PI3K/AKT inhibitors, we saw a \u223c1.5-2X increase in synergy between DGAT2i and COB and a \u223c3X increase in synergy between DGAT2i and EVE in NF1-45 cells ( Figure\u00a05 F,  Supplementary Fig.\u00a03F ). When we evaluated DGAT1/2i synergy with RAS, ER, and PI3K/AKT inhibitors, we saw a \u223c4X increase in synergy between DGAT1/2i and 4OHT, a \u223c1.5X increase in synergy between DGAT1/2i and COB, and a 1.5X increase in synergy between DGAT1/2i and EVE ( Figure\u00a05 G,  Supplementary Fig.\u00a03G ). Taken together, these results underscore the  NF1 -driven energetic and metabolic changes seen in our Seahorse XF-96 and mass spectrometry experiments. We also provide evidence connecting  NF1 -driven metabolic reprogramming to inhibitor sensitivity and synergy. Indeed,  NF1 -deficient NF1-45 cells have increased glycolysis and increased glycolysis inhibitor sensitivity and synergy, increased TCA glutamine incorporation and increased GLS inhibitor sensitivity and synergy, increased AcCa pools and increased CPT1 inhibitor sensitivity and synergy, and increased TG pools and increased DGAT1/2 inhibitor sensitivity and synergy. When we compared the antiproliferative effects of all our combination strategies ( Supplementary Figs.\u00a04\u20135 ) and their respective Bliss synergies ( Figure\u00a05  and  Supplementary Figs.\u00a03C\u2013G ), we found that inhibition of RAS and triglyceride synthesis most effectively halted proliferation in  NF1 -deficient NF1-45 cells ( Figure\u00a05 H). These findings pave the way for future  in\u00a0vivo  experiments and highlight potential combination treatments for  NF1 -deficient, ER\u00a0+\u00a0breast cancer .

  "discussion": "5 Conclusion In conclusion, this study demonstrates that  NF1  deficiency drives metabolic reprogramming in ER+ breast cancer.  NF1 -driven ER\u00a0+\u00a0breast cancer metabolic reprogramming is characterized by increased proliferation, constrained oxidative ATP production, increased glutamine TCA influx, and lipid pool expansion. These metabolic changes introduce novel single-agent sensitivity and metabolic-to-targeted inhibitor synergies. This study highlights neurofibromin's ability to alter cellular metabolism across cell types and model organisms.",
