  "title": "High resolution nerve ultrasound in neurofibromatosis type 1: a prospective and descriptive study.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the value of high resolution nerve ultrasound (HRUS) RESULTS: Sixty patients were enrolled, 37 in the PNS group and 23 in the non-PNS group. HRUS was abnormal in 52 patients (87\u00a0%), 34 in the PNS group (92\u00a0%) and 18 in the non-PNS group (78\u00a0%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.24). Patients with continuous nerve enlargements (high PN tumor load) were easily distinguished with HRUS. 85\u00a0% of patients with normal NCS have nerve enlargements on HRUS. CONCLUSIONS: HRUS helps to assess PN tumor burden in NF1. NCS did not have additional value. SIGNIFICANCE: HRUS might be useful as a screening tool for PN in NF1, especially in settings with less MRI availability.",
