  "abstract": "Advances in molecular biology have resulted in novel therapy for neurofibromatosis 2-related (NF2) tumours, highlighting the need for robust outcome measures. The disease-focused NF2 impact on quality of life (NFTI-QOL) patient questionnaire was assessed as an outcome measure for treatment in a multi-centre study. NFTI-QOL was related to clinician-rated severity (ClinSev) and genetic severity (GenSev) over repeated visits. Data were evaluated for 288 NF2 patients (n = 464 visits) attending the English national NF2 clinics from 2010 to 2012. The male-to-female ratio was equal and the mean age was 42.2 (SD 17.8) years. The analysis included NFTI-QOL eight-item score, ClinSev graded as mild, moderate, or severe, and GenSev as a rank order of the number of NF2 mutations (graded as mild, moderate, severe). The mean (SD) 8.7 (5.4) score for NFTI-QOL for either a first visit or all visits 9.2 (5.4) was similar to the published norm of 9.4 (5.5), with no significant relationships with age or gender. NFTI-QOL internal reliability was good, with a Cronbach's alpha score of 0.85 and test re-test reliability r = 0.84. NFTI related to ClinSev (r = 0.41, p < 0.001; r = 0.46 for all visits), but weakly to GenSev (r = 0.16, p < 0.05; r = 0.15 for all visits). ClinSev related to GenSev (r = 0.41, p < 0.001; r = 0.42 for all visits). NFTI-QOL showed a good reliability and ability to detect significant longitudinal changes in the QOL of individuals. The moderate relationships of NFTI-QOL with clinician- and genetic-rated severity suggest that NFTI-QOL taps into NF2 patient experiences that are not encompassed by ClinSev rating or genotype.",
  "methods": "Methods Ethical approval The study was approved as a clinical evaluation, with study number 3711, by the Clinical Audit Group committee at Guy’s and St Thomas’ National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust, London. Participating centres, inclusion and exclusion criteria NIFTI-QOL data were collected for all patient visits to the national NF2 services at Guy’s and St. Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge University NHS Foundation Trust, Central Manchester University Hospitals Foundation Trust, and satellite NF2 services from April 2010 to October 2012. Individuals who did not fulfil the diagnostic criteria for generalised or mosaic NF2, or who were aged <16 years were excluded from the study. Age and gender were recorded for all patients. Clinician-rated severity Clinician-rated severity was assessed as severe, moderate, or mild and was determined during the clinical visit. Severe disease was classified as symptomatic presentation at age <20 years with at least two symptomatic or large tumours >1.5 cm, in addition to VS and including tumours removed previously. Individuals who were diagnosed with a central nervous system tumour before the age of 12 years and had at least one other symptomatic tumour were also rated as severe. Patients older than 30 years at presentation with no more than two symptomatic or large tumours >1.5 cm including VS and tumours excised previously were assessed as mild. Moderate disease was classified as not meeting mild or severe criteria [ 1 ,  3 ]. Genetic-rated severity Genetic severity was rated as severe, moderate, or mild. Truncating mutations in exons 1–13 in all cells were rated as severe. Moderate disease included (1) deletion not involving the promoter region or exon 1, (2) splice site mutations in exons 1–8, and (3) mosaicism of truncating mutations in exons 1–13 in blood. Mild disease was classified as (1) a missense mutation or an in-frame deletion, (2) a large deletion involving the promoter region or exon 1, (3) a splice-site mutation in exons 9–15, (4) mosaicism (excluding moderate criteria), and (5) no mutation identified on blood analysis [ 1 ,  6 ,  7 ,  15 ,  17 – 19 ]. Clinical assessment and NFTI-QOL At each clinic visit, patients underwent clinical assessment and completed the NFTI-QOL, an eight-item questionnaire (and a free-response section) with a maximum score of 3 per item (four-point scale, range 0–3, with three as the most impaired) and total score of 24 [ 14 ]. Patients who were unable to complete the questionnaire due to visual or motor difficulties were assisted by a specialist nurse. Statistics The NFTI-QOL, clinical, and genetic data were analysed with SPSS using correlation, linear regression, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) tools as required.",
