  "abstract": "The Protein 4.1 family contains at least two members that function as tumour suppressors, the neurofibromatosis 2 gene product merlin and the recently identified differentially expressed in adenocarcinoma of the lung (DAL-1)/Protein 4.1B molecule. DAL-1/Protein 4.1B loss is observed in a variety of tumours, including breast and lung cancers as well as meningiomas. We have previously demonstrated that DAL-1/Protein 4.1B interacts with some but not all merlin-binding proteins, raising the possibility that DAL-1/Protein 4.1B associates with additional unique proteins specific to its function as a negative growth regulator. Using yeast two-hybrid interaction cloning, we identified three 14-3-3 isoforms, beta, gamma and eta, to be DAL-1/Protein 4.1B-binding proteins. These interactions were verified by using glutathione S-transferase affinity chromatography in vitro and co-immunoprecipitation in vivo. The interaction of 14-3-3 with DAL-1/Protein 4.1B was specific, as 14-3-3 did not bind to the related Protein 4.1 family members merlin, ezrin or radixin. The DAL-1/Protein 4.1B domain that mediates 14-3-3 binding was mapped to residues Pro(244) and Leu(280) within the 4.1/ezrin/radixin/moesin domain. The identification of this novel DAL-1/Protein 4.1B-interacting protein represents the first step towards elucidating its potentially unique mechanism of action.",
