Author information: (1)Center for Developmental Biology and Department of Pathology, University of  Texas Southwestern Medical Center, 6000 Harry Hines Blvd., Dallas, TX  75235-9133, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized  by increased incidence of benign and malignant tumors of neural crest origin.  Mutations that activate the protooncogene ras, such as loss of Nf1, cooperate  with inactivating mutations at the p53 tumor suppressor gene during malignant  transformation. One hundred percent of mice harboring null Nf1 and p53 alleles  in cis synergize to develop soft tissue sarcomas between 3 and 7 months of age.  These sarcomas exhibit loss of heterozygosity at both gene loci and express  phenotypic traits characteristic of neural crest derivatives and human NF1  malignancies.
