  "abstract": "Tissue injury and tumorigenesis share many cellular and molecular features, including immune cell (T cells, monocytes) infiltration and inflammatory factor (cytokines, chemokines) elaboration. Their common pathobiology raises the intriguing possibility that brain injury could create a tissue microenvironment permissive for tumor formation. Leveraging several murine models of the Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) cancer predisposition syndrome and two experimental methods of brain injury, we demonstrate that both optic nerve crush and diffuse traumatic brain injury induce optic glioma (OPG) formation in mice harboring Nf1-deficient preneoplastic progenitors. We further elucidate the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms, whereby glutamate released from damaged neurons stimulates IL-1β release by oligodendrocytes to induce microglia expression of Ccl5, a growth factor critical for Nf1-OPG formation. Interruption of this cellular circuit using glutamate receptor, IL-1β or Ccl5 inhibitors abrogates injury-induced glioma progression, thus establishing a causative relationship between injury and tumorigenesis.",
  "methods": "Materials and methods Mice All experiments were performed under an active and approved Animal Studies Committee protocol at Washington University School of Medicine (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee). Mice were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle in a barrier facility with ad libitum access to food and water. Several lines of mice were used for these experiments, including  Nf1 ; hGFAP-Cre mice ( flox/flox Nf1 +  mice with somatic  / + Nf1  gene inactivation in neuroglial progenitors [ 7 ]),  Nf1 flox/mut ; GFAP-Cre ( Nf1 OPG ) mice ( Nf1 +  mice with somatic  /− Nf1  gene inactivation in neuroglial progenitors at E16.5),  Nf1 +  mice (neomycin sequence insertion within exon 31 of the murine  / − Nf1  gene [ 11 ]), and  Nf1 flox/R1809C ; GFAP-Cre ( Nf1 R1809C ) mice ( Nf1 +  mice with somatic  /R1809C Nf1  gene inactivation in neuroglial progenitors at E16.5 [ 5 ]). Littermate  Nf1 flox/flox  mice were used as controls. Mice of both sexes were randomly assigned to all experimental groups without bias, and the investigators were blinded until the final data analysis. In accordance with Washington University IACUC guidelines, animals with compromised motion/eating habits or an unhealthy appearance were euthanized; however, no mice were euthanized due to tumor burden or as a result of the treatments performed in this study. Optic nerve crush Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a sterile mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). After a surgical level of anesthesia was achieved, a small incision was made in the conjunctiva with spring scissors, beginning inferior to the globe and around the eye temporally, according to published protocols [ 15 ]. The exposed optic nerve was grasped approximately 1–3 mm distal to the globe for 10 s, with only pressure from the action of the self-clamping forceps to press on the nerve. After 10 s, the optic nerve was released and the forceps removed, allowing the eye to rotate back into place. Optic nerve crush was performed both unilaterally and bilaterally in separate experiments. At least 5 mice per group were used in all experiments. Traumatic brain injury Traumatic brain injuries were performed using the modCHIMERA model as previously described [ 51 ], with sole exception being an impact energy of 0.77 ± 0.009 Joules (J). In brief, prior to initiation of the brain injury mice were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane for 2 min and 15 s followed by maintenance at 2.5% for the remainder of the experiment. The entire experiment took 5–7 min per animal. After the initial induction of anesthesia, a custom helmet was placed on the animals’ head and the animal was positioned such that the impact would occur on the midline of the skull 4 mm posterior to the lateral canthus of the eye. Immediately following the impact, eye lubricant was applied to the eyes, the animal was monitored for effective breathing, and recovery occurred in a warming box until the animal fully regained ambulatory function. At least 5 mice per group were used in all experiments. Optic nerve volume determinations Isolated optic nerves were photographed using a Leica S9D with a Flexicam C3 camera, and their volumes calculated as previously described [ 16 ]. Using ImageJ (version 10.1), four diameter measurements were taken to estimate the thickness of each optic nerve, beginning at the chiasm (D 0 ), at 150 µm (D 150 ), 300 µm (D 300 ), and 450 µm (D 450 ) anterior to the chiasm. The volumes for regions 1, 2, and 3 at the three 150 μm high-truncated cones were merged using the diameter (D0, D150, D300, and D450) values from each optic nerve measurement. The following equation was used to calculate optic nerve volumes: V 1  = 1/12  π h (D 0 2  + D 0 D 150  + D 150 2 ). Immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry Mice were euthanized and transcardially perfused with Ringers solution, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) fixation. Fixed tissue was processed for paraffin embedding. Serial 4-μm paraffin sections of the optic nerve were immunostained with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies (Additional file  1 : Table S1) and developed using the Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, PK4000). For immunocytochemistry, sections of optic nerve were immunostained with appropriate primary and secondary Alexa-fluor-conjugated antibodies (Additional file  1 : Table S1). Images of the optic nerve chiasm were acquired using Zeiss AxioScan-Z1 and Leica ICC50W microscopes with LAS EZ software or a Leica DMi8 fluorescent microscope with LAS X software. Microglia isolation Microglia were isolated from D-PBS-perfused mouse brains. Single cell suspensions were generated with the multi-tissue dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biochemicals) using established protocols [ 16 ]. The resulting cells were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 1 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.6% D-glucose, 1 ng/ml GM-CSF, 100 μg/ml P/S, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). At 14 days in vitro, microglia were mechanically dissociated from the astrocyte layer by gentle shaking (200 g, 5 h, 37 °C). 5 × 10 5  microglia per replicate were used for the IL-1β treatment experiments. Oligodendrocyte isolation Mixed glial cultures were generated from 1 to 2-day-old mice pups as described previously [ 17 ]. Briefly, the cerebra of mice pups were dissected, minced, and digested at 37 °C using a neural tissue dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, catalog #130-092-628) to generate a single-cell suspension. Cells were plated into 75-cm 2  flasks and grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C and 5% CO 2  for the next 10 days. After 6–8 days, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) can be visualized growing upon a mesh of astrocytes. On the 10th day, OPCs were purified from mixed glial cells by shaking. Cells were shaken initially for 1 h at 200 rpm to remove microglia, refed, and shaken again for 18–20 h at 37 °C at 200 rpm. OPCs were collected by centrifugation at 10 min at 100 ×  g . OPCs were then cultured in oligodendrocyte medium (Sciencell, catalog #1621). PDGF-AA (Sigma) was added at 10 ng/ml to Sato medium for allow for oligodendrocyte growth. RNA extraction and real-time PCR Using the NucleoSpin® RNA Plus kit (Takara-740984.205), total RNA was isolated from the optic nerves of mice according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Isolated RNA was then reverse transcribed into cDNA using the Applied Biosystems High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (#4374967) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed by TaqMan gene expression (Additional file  1 : Table S2). ΔΔCT values were calculated using  Gapdh  as an internal control. All reactions were performed using the QuantStudio 3 system (Applied Biosystems). For each experiment, two mice were used per sample and 3 or 4 samples were included in each experiment. Western blotting Total protein was extracted from cells and snap frozen tissues using RIPA buffer supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail and quantified using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Fisher scientific, PI23225). 40 µg of total protein lysate was separated in precast SDS–polyacrylamide gels (Biorad 432,156) by electrophoresis and transferred onto PVDF membranes, followed by blocking in 5% w/v nonfat dry milk and incubation with the indicated antibodies (Additional file  1 : Table S1) overnight. Proteins were detected with IRDye-conjugated secondary antibodies using the LI-COR Odyssey Imaging system and Image Studio v5.2. RNAScope  in situ  hybridization RNA in situ hybridization was performed using the Multiplex Fluorescent V2 Assay kit (ACDBio) in combination with Opal Dyes (Akoya Biosciences) as per manufacturer’s instructions. The in situ probes are listed in the (Additional file  1 : Table S3). Images of the optic nerve chiasm were acquired on an ICC50W fluorescent microscope with Leica Application Suite X software or with a Leica DMi8 fluorescent microscope using LAS X software. RNA sequencing and analysis RNA from sham control, optic nerve crush, and TBI mice was isolated and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq platform. RNA-seq reads were then aligned and quantitated to the Ensembl release 101 primary assembly with an Illumina DRAGEN Bio-IT on-premise server running version 3.9.3-8 software. Analyses were conducted using Partek Flow version 10.0. Bulk RNA-seq reads were qualified to annotation model mm10—Ensambl release 102 v2. All gene counts were normalized by median normalization. Differential genetic analysis was performed for differences between crush and control samples using DESeq2, excluding features with average coverage < 1. Differential genetic analysis results were filtered to include only genes with  p -value ≤ 0.05 and fold change ≥ 2. Pathway analysis was then conducted using DAVID 2021, Knowledgebase v2022q4 with annotation pathways GOTERM_BP_DIRECT, GOTERM_CC_DIRECT, and GOTERM_MF_DIRECT. Excel was used to create a bar plot of the number of genes in selected pathways. In vivo  mouse treatments Four-week-old  Nf1 OPG  mice were treated with 10 mg/kg NFκB inhibitor (NFκB-IN; Caffeic acid phenethyl ester, Fisher Scientific, 274310), 275 mg/kg PLX3397-containing or control chow pellets (Free Base), 1 mg/ml anti-IL-1β neutralizing antibodies (R&D System 1060-DE-100), anti-IgG2a control antibodies (R&D Systems), or memantine hydrochloride (20 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection. Optic nerves were harvested when the mice reached 12 weeks of age, and the percentage of Ki67 +  cells and volume measurements determined as previously reported [ 16 ]. At least 5 mice per group were used in all experiments. Quantification and statistical analysis GraphPad Prism software was used for data analysis. To determine differences between two groups, a two-tailed Student’s  t  test was used, whereas multiple comparisons were analyzed by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons. Statistical significance was set at  P  ≤ 0.05. All experiments were independently repeated at least three times with at least three biological replicates.",
