  "abstract": "The mechanism of vulnerability to pediatric low-grade gliomas (pLGGs)-the most common brain tumor in children-during development remains largely unknown. Using mouse models of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated pLGGs in the optic pathway (NF1-OPG), we demonstrate that NF1-OPG arose from the vulnerability to the dependency of Mek-Erk/MAPK signaling during gliogenesis of one of the two developmentally transient precursor populations in the optic nerve, brain-derived migrating glial progenitors (GPs), but not local progenitors. Hyperactive Erk/MAPK signaling by Nf1 loss overproduced GPs by disrupting the balance between stem-cell maintenance and gliogenesis of hypothalamic ventricular zone radial glia (RG). Persistence of RG-like GPs initiated NF1-OPG, causing Bax-dependent apoptosis in retinal ganglion cells. Removal of three Mek1/Mek2 alleles or transient post-natal treatment with a low-dose MEK inhibitor normalized differentiation of Nf1",

A172V METHODS EXPERIMENTAL MODEL DETAILS Mice All experiments were conducted following the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) under protocols 2023–0044 and 2025–0007 and the National Institute of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.  Mapk1 A172V  mice were generated by the CCHMC Transgenic Animal and Genome Editing Core using CRISPR technology to introduce the A172V mutation plus a Sal1 site for genotyping. The correctly edited mutant allele founder mice (confirmed via Sanger sequencing) were bred to CD1 mice and maintained on this background. Heterozygous mutant mice ( Mapk1 A172V/+ ) were bred to produce wildtype, heterozygous, and homozygous mutant offspring. Mice were PCR genotyped with the following primers: Mapk1–5’-GTTTTCCTTGTTACTGATACTGCC and Mapk1–3’- ACTGAAGATGGTGACTCCTAAGC to amplify a 324 bp product which was subsequently digested with Sal1 restriction enzyme to produce 200bp and 124 bp products only in mutant mice. All mice were group housed by sex (up to four per cage) in standard shoebox cages on a 14/10 light/dark cycle with  ad libitum  access to food (LabDiet, Cat# 5010) and water. Mice were weighed at postnatal day (PD) 9, 21, 30, 44, 58, 72, 86, 100, and 150. Behavioral experiments were conducted after mice reached adulthood (after 12 weeks of age). Male and female mice were tested in all experiments. Marble burying, sucrose splash test, dark-light testing, novel object recognition, open field testing, and the looming stimulus assay were performed in the Robinson Lab at CCHMC. All other behavioral tests were performed at the Animal Behavior Core at CCHMC. METHOD DETAILS Behavioral Assays Marble burying: The protocol used was adapted from Angoa-Pérez et al . Mice were introduced to a cage filled halfway with clean, leveled corncob bedding. In each cage, 15 opaque black marbles were arranged in an approximately equidistant 3 × 5 grid. After 30 minutes, the number of marbles buried was recorded. A marble was considered “buried’ if at least 2/3 of the marble was submerged. The mean number of marbles buried was calculated for each genotype. 1 Sucrose splash test: The protocol used was adapted from Frisbee et al . Mice were sprayed with 10% sucrose solution on the upper neck between the ears and allowed to roam in a clean, empty cage for 5 minutes. Sessions were recorded using a Basler acA2040–120 um camera with an Edmunds Optics TECHSPEC 6mm C Series fixed focal length lens, and experimenters examined behavior every 5 seconds. Total grooming and latency to groom were calculated for each mouse. 2 Open field test: Recordings of each session were taken through a camera (Basler acA2040–120 um an Edmunds Optics TECHSPEC 6mm C Series fixed focal length lens). Mice were placed in the corner of a large plastic 55 cm × 45 cm storage container facing the wall and allowed to explore for 30 minutes. Ethovision ™  XT (Noldus Information Technology, Wageningen, the Netherlands) was used to determine the distance traveled and the time spent in the center of the arena. Novel object recognition: The protocol used was adapted from Bevins and Besheer . Specifically, in 55 cm × 45 cm arenas, two objects were placed equally spaced apart and fixed to the bottom of the container with Gorilla mounting putty. The objects were toy building blocks that were identical in size and color. Mice were allowed 10 minutes to explore the arena during the familiarization phase before being returned to their home cage. One hour later, the mice were returned to the same arena, but one of the objects was changed to a novel object, which was different in size and color from the original. The left-right location of the novel object was counterbalanced between mice. Again, mice were allowed to explore the objects for 10 minutes before being removed and placed back into their home cage. Videos for familiarization and novel object exploration were obtained with a Basler acA2040–120 um camera with an Edmunds Optics TECHSPEC 6mm C Series fixed focal length lens, and mouse position was tracked using Ethovision 3 ™  XT software. Interaction with an object was determined when the nose of the mouse entered a region of interest that measured a circle with a 12 cm diameter around the object. The time of interaction was measured, and the discrimination ratio was calculated (time spent with novel object – time spent with familiar objects/total time interacting with both objects). Dark-light box: The behavioral apparatus was a 37 cm × 20 cm arena that was one third covered by an opaque, infrared light (IR)-lucent shelter with an opening for mouse entry. The entire arena was exposed to bright light. Mice could move freely between dark and light sides. Behavior was recorded and tracked using Ethovision ™  XT. An IR light backlit panel was used under the arena to allow the software to detect the mouse inside of the shelter. Mice were placed in the lit side of the arena, facing toward the wall and away from the shelter. The latency to cross into the shelter, time spent in the shelter, time spent in the open arena, and crossings between the shelter and exposed arena were measured over a 10-minute period. Looming: The looming stimulus assay was performed as described . The clear acrylic arena measured 20.3 cm (w) × 61 cm (l) × 40.6 cm (h) and contained an (IR) light-lucent shelter at one side (the opening was the width of the arena) to serve as the escape location. A 9 cm petri dish was placed at the opposite end of the apparatus to encourage exploration of the ‘threat zone’ in the open arena. A 15.6-inch LCD monitor was placed above the threat zone to present a train of five looming stimuli (expanding black discs with a maximum diameter of 19.5 cm encompassing 27 degrees of visual angle) when the mouse entered the threat zone. The entire arena and monitor were placed inside a light and sound attenuating enclosure that could be closed during testing to minimize environmental stimuli during performance of the assay. An IR backlight (880 nm back-lit collimated backlight, Advanced Illumination) was used to allow mouse tracking in the light-attenuated chamber. To avoid overheating from the backlight, the arena was elevated on 4 small clear pedestals that were inaccessible to the mice, allowing airflow and space between the light and the floor of the arena. Mouse behavior was recorded using a Pylon camera with an Edmunds Optics TECHSPEC 6mm C Series fixed focal length lens positioned above the arena to allow for a full field of view. Ethovision 4 , 5 ™  XT was used for real-time tracking and was synchronized with Bonsai  to trigger the looming stimulus in the LCD monitor when the mouse entered the threat zone after a 10-minute habituation period. After the train of looming discs was presented, mice were recorded for 3 minutes before being returned to their home cage. Mice were excluded from analysis if they never entered the threat zone and thus never triggered a looming stimulus after 20 minutes. 6 Morris water maze: The arena was a pool that measured 150 cm in diameter and 51 cm high that contained a platform that was submerged 1–1.5 cm below the water level. The water was kept at ~21°C. Mice were tracked using Anymaze software (Stoelting Company, Wood Dale, IL). There were 3 phases of the experiment: training, acquisition, and reversal learning. The starting quadrant was rotated in acquisition and reversal phases so no mouse started in the same quadrant on consecutive trials. Distance, speed, latency, and path efficiency were recorded for each phase; however, because of the coat color of the mice only latency was obtained. Training occurred on day 1 of testing. During this phase, curtains were drawn to cover external cues in the room. A 10 cm diameter platform with an orange ball was mounted to the platform. There was a 90-second time limit per trial with an inter-trial interval (ITI) of at least 10 minutes. If a mouse failed to find the platform at least twice within 6 trials, they were retested 4–6 hours later. Mice who found the platform moved on to the next phase of the experiment, while mice who failed to find the platform when retested were excluded (4  Mapk1 A172V/+  mice). The acquisition phase occurred on days 2–7 with 5 days of learning and 1 memory (probe) trial on day 7. There were 4 trials each day with a 90-second limit per trial and an ITI of at least 10 minutes. During this phase, curtains were open to expose distal cues on the walls that mice could use to navigate the pool. The 10 cm diameter camouflaged platform was submerged 1–1.5 cm below the water surface. On the final day, during the probe trial, the platform was removed from the water bath to measure spatial memory for the platform on previous days. The final phase was reversal testing, which measures cognitive flexibility and was performed over 6 days of testing. The phase was identical to the acquisition phase, but a 7 cm diameter platform was placed into the opposite quadrant during the 5 days of learning. The platform was then removed during the probe trial on day 6. Contextual fear conditioning: The experiment was conducted using the San Diego Instruments Freeze Monitor system (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA). The system contained a conditioning chamber with a metal bar floor for foot shock delivery (1.0 mA) and a photobeam array to record the start and end of freezing episodes. The test took place over two days. The first day was the habituation phase, which consisted of 5 minutes of acclimation followed by 9 intervals of shock delivered during the last 2 seconds of the 30-second ITI. This lasted 10 minutes. The second day was to test the mouse’s contextual memory. The mice were placed in the same chamber as day 1, but no foot shocks were delivered. This phase was 6 minutes long. Freezing behavior was measured in both phases. 24 Hour home cage monitoring: The test was performed after P60 for two consecutive 24-hour recording periods using the HomeCage Photobeam Activity System (San Diego Instruments). Mice were individually housed in a static cage within the apparatus that contained a Napa Nectar gel and food pellets. After testing, mice returned to their home cage with their cage mates. Locomotor activity was measured as beam breaks per hour over 48 hours of testing. Pre-pulse inhibition (PPI): The test was performed in an SR-LAB apparatus (San Diego Instruments). Mice were placed in an acrylic cylindrical holder attached to an acrylic base plate with a piezoelectric accelerometer transducer to detect movement. During the session a fan was on, creating background ambient noise. Mice were given a 5-minute acclimation period before testing began. Pulses were 20-ms mixed frequency white noise bursts at 120 dB intensity. Pre-pulses were 59, 70, or 80 dB and were presented in counterbalanced order in a 20-trial block Latin Square. Peak response amplitude (Vmax) was recorded. MEK Inhibitor in Milk Treatment MEK inhibitor (MEKi) PD0325901 (Selleck Chemicals, Cat# 1036) was administered to lactating dams as described . In brief, MEKi was dissolved in 0.5% methylcellulose and 0.2% Tween-80, which was used as the vehicle control. Cages were randomly selected for MEKi or vehicle treatment before pups were born, and MEKi (5mg/kg, which delivers~1–2% of the maternal dose to pups via the milk 7 ) or vehicle was delivered to lactating dams via oral gavage once a day from PD0.5 until PD21. Mice were euthanized for genotyping at PD21. 8 Blood Collection and Analysis Trunk blood was collected from PD14 old mice into MiniCollect tubes with K2EDTA (Greiner Bio-One, Monroe, NC) following rapid decapitation. Samples were analyzed using a Heksa Element HT5 hematology analyzer to obtain a complete blood count with 5-part differential (Antech Diagnostics, Vermont, VIC, Australia). Samples were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA to determine differences between all 3 genotypes ( Mapk1 +/+ , Mapk1 A172V/+ ,  and  Mapk1 A172V/A172V  mice). Tissue Extraction and Analysis Brain protein extraction: Brains were extracted from E16.5, P15, and P100 mice following rapid decapitation. The cerebellum and hindbrain were removed and the forebrain was collected. One half of the forebrain was homogenized. RIPA Lysis Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were added prior to homogenization. Then the tissue was agitated for 1 hour at 4°C and centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 14 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was aliquoted and stored at −80°C until use. Protein was quantified using protocol 5.2 Microplate Assay Protocol of Detergent Compatible (DC) Protein Assay Instruction Manual (BioRad) and used for Western blots. Western blot: Cell lysates were heated for 5 minutes at 95°C with 6X Laemmli SDS sample buffer, reducing (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples were loaded onto a 10% Mini-PROTEAN TGX Gel (BioRad) and run at 150 V until separated. Protein was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF) (BioRad) for 45 minutes at 100V. The PVDF membrane was blocked in Intercept Blocking Buffer (LI-COR) for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by incubation in primary antibody (pERK, Cell Signaling Technology, #4370, 1:1000; ERK, Cell Signaling Technology, #4696, 1:1000 or Cell Signaling Technology, #4695, 1:1000; and β-actin, Cell Signaling Technology, #3700, 1:1000) diluted in Intercept Antibody Diluent (LI-COR) at 4°C overnight. The following day, the membrane was washed 3 times for 5 minutes each with TBS-T before being incubated with the secondary antibody (IRDye 680RD Goat anti-Mouse IgG, LI-COR, #926–68070, 1:10,000 or 1:20,000; IRDye 800CW Donkey anti-Rabbit, LI-COR, #926–32213, 1:10,000 or 1:20,000) that was diluted in Intercept Antibody Diluent (LI-COR) for 1 hour at room temperature. The blot was then washed in TBS-T 3 times for 10 minutes followed by one wash for 10 minutes in TBS. Signals were visualized on the Odyssey CLx (LI-COR) using ImageStudio Ver 5.2 (LI-COR). Data was analyzed through Fiji and GraphPad Prism 10.1.2. If applicable, the PVDF membrane was stripped in Restore Western Blot Stripping Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), followed by 30 minutes at room temperature in Intercept Blocking Buffer (LI-COR) before being incubated in the new primary antibody overnight at 4°C and repeating the second day protocol. Phosphoproteomics: Phosphoproteomic quantification via mass spectrometry was performed at the UC Proteomics Laboratory at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine using forebrain samples from P15 mice (4  Mapk1 +/+  mice and 4  Mapk1 A172V/+  mice, 2 males and 2 female samples per genotype). The brain tissue was frozen using liquid nitrogen directly in Kimble Kontes homogenizer tubes (item# 749520–0000), broken up within the tube with a small spatula, and homogenized in urea lysis buffer, which contained: 9 M urea, 20 mM HEPES, 1 mM b-glycero-phosphate, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mM activated sodium orthovanadate. The samples were adjusted to 1 mL total volume and probe sonicated at 15 W for 15 seconds for 3 cycles. Unsolubilized material was pelleted via centrifugation, and samples were placed in new tubes. 3 mg aliquots were removed from each sample, and the volume was adjusted up to 1 mL with undiluted urea lysis buffer. The samples were digested with modified trypsin (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Cat#  LS003740 ) overnight at 37°C. The digested peptides were purified and concentrated by passing them over a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters Corp., Cat# WAT051910), dried in a SpeedVac, and resuspended in binding/equilibration buffer from the Thermo Fisher High-Select TiO 2  Phosphopeptide Enrichment Kit (Cat# A39223), which was used for peptide enrichment according to the manufacturer instructions. Eluted samples were dried in a SpeedVac and resuspended in 0.1% formic acid. 10% of each enriched sample was analyzed by nanoscale liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (Orbitrap Eclipse). All downstream analysis of the mass spectrometry data was performed using R v.4.5.0. Phosphosites were filtered for a high FDR and a Site Localization Score (ptmRS module) greater than 0.75 and unambiguous. The  PhosR  package was used for filtering, imputation, and scaling. Phosphopeptides with greater than 25% missing values across all samples were filtered out. For remaining phosphopeptides, site and condition specific imputation was performed if at least 50% of a given phosphopeptide was present in the defined condition ( Mapk1 +/+  and  Mapk1 A172V/+  WT). Differentially abundant phosphopeptides were identified using a t-test (p <0.05) and a fold change cutoff of |1.5|. The following packages were used for subsequent downstream analysis:  ReactomePA  (Reactome Pathway analysis),  ggplot2  (bargraphs and volcano plot),  ggpubr  (stats on bargraphs), and  ssGSEA2  (post-translational modification-signature enrichment analysis or PTM-SEA). For the PTM-SEA analysis, the ptm.sig.db.all.uniprot.mouse.v2.0.0 database was used, with all other parameters set to their default states. NMR Metabolomics: The NMR based metabolomics experiments were performed at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center Translational Metabolomics Facility (RRID: SCR_022636). Liver tissue samples were extracted using modified Bligh and Dyer methods  to obtain polar metabolites. The extraction solvent volumes were determined based on the average water content of mouse liver tissue (72.8%). Plasma samples were processed according to the published protocol 9 – 11 . Briefly, the plasma samples were filtered through pre-washed 3 kDa spin filters and the filtrate was mixed with NMR buffer up to the final volume of 220uL. NMR data collection and processing were performed with a Bruker Avance III HD 600 MHz spectrometer using Topspin 3.6 software (Bruker Analytik, Rheinstetten, Germany), as previously described 12 . Total of 49 liver and 40 plasma metabolites were assigned based on the chemical shifts on 1D 1H-NOESY, 2D-TOCSY and -HSQC NMR experiments with reference spectra found in databases, Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) 13 , and Chenomx 14 ®  NMR Suite profiling software (Chenomx Inc. version 8.1). The metabolites were quantified by Chenomx software based on the internal standard, TMSP and were normalized to tissue weights or plasma volume prior to statistical analysis by R studio and MetaboAnalyst . Log transformation and mean centering data scaling were applied prior to multivariate analysis in MetaboAnalyst. 15 Immunohistochemistry Tissue Collection and Cryostat Sectioning: Mice were transcardially perfused with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The brain was extracted into PFA at 4°C overnight. The following day, the brains were transferred to 20% sucrose for cryoprotection. Brains were mounted in Tissue-Tek O.C.T Compound (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and sectioned in the cryostat at −20°C into 12 μm serial sections and mounted on slides. Slides were stored at −80°C until use. Immunohistochemistry: In Coplin jars, warmed citrate buffer was poured over slides for antigen retrieval for a maximum of 5 minutes. Slides were then bleached with 0.33% H 2 O 2  for 10 minutes and washed three times for 5 minutes each with 1X KPBS. Slides were then incubated in primary antibodies overnight in a humid chamber (Nk x2 .2, Abcam, #ab191077, 1:1000; GFAP, Agilent, #Z0334, 1:2000; PDGFRα, R&D Systems, #AF1062, 1:1000, and Myrf, ABclonal, #A16355, 1:1000). The following day, slides were washed in 1X KPBS for 5 minutes three times. A biotinylated secondary antibody was added (Biotin-SP (long spacer) AffiniPure ®  Donkey Anti-Goat IgG (H+L), Jackson ImmunoResearch, #705–065-147, 1:500; Biotin-SP (long spacer) AffiniPure ®  Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L), Jackson Immuno, # 711–065-152, 1:500) for 2 hours at room temperature in a humid chamber. Slides are washed three times for 5 minutes each in 1X KPBS and incubated in Avidin-Biotin Complex (ABC) (Vector Laboratories) for 1 hour in a humid chamber at room temperature. Slides are washed again three times for 5 minutes in 1X KPBS. Diaminobenzidine (DAB) is then added to slides in a humid chamber for 5 minutes, then washed in 1X KPBS three times for 5 minutes. Slides are left to dry overnight before being coverslipped. To coverslip, slides are rehydrated for 5 minutes before dehydrated in a series of ETOH washes (70%, 95%, and 100%) for 5 minutes each. Slides are then put into two washes of xylene for 5 minutes each and cover slipped with DPX mountant media (Sigma-Aldrich). CellProfiler (ver 4.2.8) was used to quantify the images. Heart Immunohistochemistry: Histological analysis was conducted on formalin-fixed tissues, paraffin-embedded, sectioned at 5–8 μm, and stained either with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or with Russell-Movat pentachrome stain . Whole-heart H&E-stained sections were viewed on a Zeiss Discovery V8 stereomicroscope and imaged with an Axiocam 820 camera. Valve pentachrome-stained sections were viewed on a Zeiss Axio Imager Z1 with an Axiocam 305 camera. Images were viewed and measured using Zeiss ZEN Blue software. The myocardial thickness for each sample was measured at three positions for each ventricle: the dorsal, lateral, and ventral surface. Equal number of sections were selected at random for each set of comparisons. 16 Skull Skeletal Preps: Heads from PD7  Mapk1 +/+  and  Mapk1 A172V/+  pups were deskinned and fixed in ethanol for 2 days. Skulls were then washed in Alcian blue dye (Sigma Aldrich) overnight at room temperature to stain for cartilage. Skulls were rinsed with ethanol for two days and cleared with 1% KOH for 6 hours until clear. After clearing, skulls were counterstained with Alizarian red stain (Sigma Aldrich) for 24 hours to visualize bone. Finally, skulls were cleared with fresh 20% glycerol/1% KOH solution daily until the clearing was complete and stored in a 50% glycerol/50% ethanol solution. Skulls were imaged using a Zeiss Discovery V8 stereomicroscope with an Axiocam 820 color camera and ZEN Blue software. QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS All statistical tests were conducted using R or GraphPad Prism version 10.5 (GraphPad). Sex was considered as a variable in a two-way or three-way ANOVA when appropriate. If no sex differences were found, the statistical testing was performed with the sexes combined. Parametric tests were conducted unless the data was found to be nonparametric using the D’Agostino-Pearson test for normality. For data that had small sample sizes, we used the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality instead. A Welch’s correction was used for t-tests if sample variances were significantly different. For body mass data, a mixed-effects model with the Geisser-Greenhouse correction was used instead of a repeated-measures ANOVA to account for missing values. The Bonferroni correction was used for  post hoc  testing after an ANOVA if any variable had three or more levels. A Dunn’s  post hoc  test was used for Kruskal-Wallis tests, and the Fisher’s Least Significant Difference (LSD) test was used for all other  post hoc  tests. Inheritance data was calculated using a Chi-square test of independence. Survival data was calculated using the log-rank test and plotted using a Kaplan-Meier plot. For correlations, we used Pearson’s correlation coefficient to determine the strength of a relationship between two variables, and linear regressions were run to generate regression lines on the graphs. All source data used to produce the figures and the results of statistical testing procedures are provided in the Source Data and Statistical Analysis file.",
