Loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene causes the autosomal dominant condition,  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Children and adults with NF1 suffer from  pathologies including benign and malignant tumors to cognitive deficits,  seizures, growth abnormalities, and peripheral neuropathies. NF1 encodes  neurofibromin, a Ras-GTPase activating protein, and NF1 mutations result in  hyperactivated Ras signaling in patients. Existing NF1 mutant mice mimic  individual aspects of NF1, but none comprehensively models the disease. We  describe a potentially novel Yucatan miniswine model bearing a heterozygotic  mutation in NF1 (exon 42 deletion) orthologous to a mutation found in NF1  patients. NF1+/ex42del miniswine phenocopy the wide range of manifestations seen  in NF1 patients, including café au lait spots, neurofibromas, axillary  freckling, and neurological defects in learning and memory. Molecular analyses  verified reduced neurofibromin expression in swine NF1+/ex42del fibroblasts, as  well as hyperactivation of Ras, as measured by increased expression of its  downstream effectors, phosphorylated ERK1/2, SIAH, and the checkpoint regulators  p53 and p21. Consistent with altered pain signaling in NF1, dysregulation of  calcium and sodium channels was observed in dorsal root ganglia expressing  mutant NF1. Thus, these NF1+/ex42del miniswine recapitulate the disease and  provide a unique, much-needed tool to advance the study and treatment of NF1.
