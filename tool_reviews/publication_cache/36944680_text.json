  "abstract": "Schwannomas are common sporadic tumors and hallmarks of familial neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) that develop predominantly on cranial and spinal nerves. Virtually all schwannomas result from inactivation of the NF2 tumor suppressor gene with few, if any, cooperating mutations. Despite their genetic uniformity schwannomas exhibit remarkable clinical and therapeutic heterogeneity, which has impeded successful treatment. How heterogeneity develops in NF2-mutant schwannomas is unknown. We have found that loss of the membrane:cytoskeleton-associated NF2 tumor suppressor, merlin, yields unstable intrinsic polarity and enables Nf2",
