  "abstract": "Noonan syndrome and neurofibromatosis type 1 are genetic conditions linked to pathogenic variants in genes of the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling pathway. Both conditions hyper-activate signalling of the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and exhibit a high prevalence of neuropsychiatric disorders. Further, animal models of Noonan syndrome and neurofibromatosis type 1 and human imaging studies show white matter abnormalities in both conditions. While these findings suggest Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinas pathway hyper-activation effects on white matter, it is unknown whether these effects are syndrome-specific or pathway-specific. To characterize the effect of Noonan syndrome and neurofibromatosis type 1 on human white matter's microstructural integrity and discern potential syndrome-specific influences on microstructural integrity of individual tracts, we collected diffusion-weighted imaging data from children with Noonan syndrome (",
