  "title": "Unraveling the development of cutaneous neurofibromas in neurofibromatosis type 1.",
  "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder that leads to the formation of cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs), benign nerve sheath tumors that develop in the skin and significantly impact the quality of life of patients. cNF development begins with bi-allelic NF1 loss in the Schwann cell (SC) lineage, followed by the recruitment of a complex tumor microenvironment consisting of fibroblasts, immune cells, blood vessels, axons, and a dense extracellular matrix. Despite its high prevalence and clinical impact, the molecular mechanisms underlying cNF formation remain poorly understood. Here, we used an Nf1 knockout (Nf1-KO) mouse model combined with immunohistochemistry and single cell transcriptomics in order to investigate the mechanisms driving cNF development. Our results showed that mutant SCs accumulate in the skin of young mice weeks prior to the onset of cNF. However, these cells remain quiescent until triggered by skin trauma, which induces their proliferation and the rapid formation of cNFs. Using a trauma-induced Nf1-KO model with scRNAseq, we designed a transcriptomic atlas of growing and mature cNFs, as well as adjacent apparently healthy skin. This analysis identified a population of non-myelinating Aquaporin1",

  "methods": "Materials and methods Animals The following mouse lines were used and genotyped as described in the original publications:  Prss56 Cre/Cre ,  R26 tdTom/tdTom ;  Prss56 Cre/Cre ,  R26 tdTom/tdTom ,  Nf1 flox/flox ;  Nf1 flox/flox ;  Nf1 +/\u2212 ; and B6D2F1 ( https://janvier-labs.com/en/fiche_produit/b6d2f1-mouse/ ). We bred  Prss56 Cre/Cre ,  R26 tdTom/tdTom ,  Nf1 flox/flox  mice with the  Nf1 flox/flox  or  Nf1 +/\u2212  mice to generate  Prss56 Cre/+ ,  R26 tdTom/+ ,  Nf1 flox/flox  ( Nf1 -KO) and  Prss56 Cre/+ ,  R26 tdTom/+ ,  Nf1 flox/\u2212  ( Nf1 -KO het ) mutants, respectively.  Prss56 Cre/Cre ,  R26 tdTom/tdTom  mice were crossed with B6D2F1 mice to generate  Prss56 Cre/+ ,  R26 tdTom/+  controls. All animal manipulations were approved by a French Ethical Committee (10/01/2020, reference number APAFIS#25551-2020031115016451 v6) and were performed according to French and European Union regulations. Human tissue specimens A total of 16 cNFs were surgically removed and collected from the forearm of individuals with NF1. Of these cNFs, nine were classified as sessile, five as globular, and two as flat. 4 The cNFs were defined as small (diameter\u2009<\u20095\u00a0mm) and 12 as medium (5\u00a0mm\u2009<\u2009diameter\u2009<\u200910\u00a0mm). The study was authorized by the ethical committee of the Henri-Mondor Hospital (ID RCB: 2019-A01100-57/SI:19.09.05.52652) and all participants provided their written informed consent. Housing conditions Mice used in this study were housed in a temperature- and humidity- controlled vivarium with a 12-hour dark/light cycle and free access to food and water at the IMRB pathogen-free facility. To investigate the mechanisms that initiate the development of cNFs, males were separated at weaning (1 month, 1 male/cage) and then until sacrifice. To obtain growing cNFs, males were housed in groups with 3\u2009\u2212\u20095 siblings/cage and then until sacrifice. Stabilized cNFs were obtained from males that were housed in groups (3\u2009\u2212\u20095 males/cage), and then separated (1 male/cage) 1 week prior to the experiment. Induced skin incision procedure P45 males kept alone since weaning were anesthetized with isoflurane and their dorsal skin was shaved and sterilized with 70% ethanol. A 5% lidocaine cream was then applied to the whole dorsal skin for 2\u00a0min. The 5\u00a0mm-long full-thickness incisional skin lesions (2 per mouse) were made with scissors in an area filled with tomato\u2009+\u2009traced cells. The mice were monitored for the following days to ensure that no infection occurred at the injury site. Animals were sacrificed on Days 6, 8, and 14 ( n \u2009=\u20092 mice/stage,  N \u2009=\u20092 incisions/mouse) post-injury, and their skin was harvested and processed for immunohistochemistry analysis. EdU labeling P45 male mice, kept alone since weaning, were injected intraperitoneally with EdU at a dose of 20\u00a0\u00b5g/g of body weight twice a day for 4 consecutive days starting on postnatal day P45 and harvested 72\u00a0h later. Five  Nf1 -KO and four control mice were sacrificed, and their skin was dissected and fixed for 2\u00a0h at 4\u00a0\u00b0C in 4% PFA. EdU detection was performed on 14\u00a0\u03bcm-thick cryosections using the Click-IT Plus EdU Alexa Fluor 488 Imaging Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, followed by immunolabeling for tomato. Macroscopic analysis For the macroscopic analysis of the presence of cNFs, mice were anesthetized, and their back skins were shaved. The dorsal skins were imaged using the \u03d5-eye\u2122 live optical imaging device from the Bioemtech company. Image processing and analysis were performed using Image J software. Skin processing for immunohistochemistry Animals were shaved, depilated, and perfused transcardially (except for manually injured skins) with 50mL PBS to remove blood. For sectioning, dorsal skins of Nf1-KOi mice were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, then washed with PBS, dehydrated in 30% sucrose overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, embedded in gelatin/sucrose (PBS/15% sucrose/7.5% gelatin), and frozen on dry ice. Samples were sectioned at 14\u00a0\u03bcm thickness on SuperFrost Plus slides. IHC was performed on mouse frozen sections using the following primary antibodies: rat anti-tomato (1:1000; Kerafast #EST203), rabbit anti-RFP (1:1000; Rockland #600-401-379), goat anti-CD45 (1:100; Bio-Techne #AF114), goat anti-PDGFR\u03b1 (1:100; R&D system #AF1062), rabbit anti-Ki67 (1:200; Abcam #ab15580), rabbit anti-P-ERK (1:250; Cell Signaling #9101), goat anti-cKIT (1:100; R&D system #AF1356), rat anti-F4/80 (1:400; Abcam #ab6640), rat anti-MBP (1:200; Chemicon Millipore #MAB386), goat anti-POSTN (1:400; BioTechne #AF2955), rabbit anti-TNC (1:100; Abcam #ab108930), rabbit anti-PGP9.5 (1:100; Abcam #ab108986), rabbit anti-nestin (1:100; Abcam # ab221660), mouse A488-anti-Aqp1 (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotech #sc-25287). IHC was performed on frozen sections of patient cNFs using the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-PGP9.5 (1:100; Abcam #ab108986), mouse anti-S100\u03b2 (1:300; Abcam #ab218516). Fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson Immuno Research. Briefly, sections were blocked with 10% normal donkey serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2\u00a0h at room temperature. Sections were incubated with the primary antibodies in the same blocking solution overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, then washed and incubated with the secondary antibodies in 1% normal donkey serum, 0,3% Triton X-100 in PBS solution at room temperature. Sections were counterstained with Hoechst 33,342 to detect nuclei and mounted in Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech). For wholemounts, dorsal skins from  Nf1 -KOi mice were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 2\u00a0h at 4\u00a0\u00b0C and washed with PBS. The samples were then cleared with Rapiclear \u00ae  1.52 reagent (SunJin Lab, #RC152001) and mounted in the same reagent. Imaging and immunostaining qualitative and semiquantitative analyses Images were captured with a Zeiss LSM 900 confocal microscope equipped with a 20X objective. They were acquired in the.czi format before being processed and analyzed using Image J software. For all semi-quantitative analyses, raw full-stack images were stacked, processed to remove autofluorescent background, saved as.tif images, and automatically processed for the proportion of tomato\u2009+\u2009SCs and MBP\u2009+\u2009myelinating SCs using specific Image J macros. Results were processed in GraphPad Prism 10 software and presented as mean +/- SEM. Skin processing for single cell RNA sequencing 3-hour dissociation protocol Animals were anesthetized, shaved, depilated, and perfused transcardially with 50mL PBS to remove any blood. Their skin was carefully dissected, and adipose tissue was removed with scalpels, which was supplemented by three successive washes in 30mL RPMI. Each piece of skin was then carefully placed in a petri dish, epidermis side down, and treated with 15mL of 0.15% trypsin-EDTA for another 30\u00a0min at 37\u00b0. After this incubation, the skins were removed from the trypsin-EDTA solution and placed in a PBS/5%FBS solution at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, where the detached epidermis was gently scraped off with scalpels. The skins were then washed three times in 30mL of RPMI before being exposed to the trypsin-EDTA medium for another 30\u00a0min at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. After this second incubation, the enzymatically dissociated epidermis was scraped off using the same procedure. After a final rinse with RPMI, the skins were carefully dissected under a Leica epi-fluorescence microscope to isolate cNFs and HLS regions, which were then finely minced on a -20\u00a0\u00b0C metal block using scissors and scalpels. The minced tissue (0.5\u00a0g per tube) was then immersed in 10mL of prewarmed RPMI medium containing Liberase DH (0.25\u00a0mg/mL) and placed in a 37\u00a0\u00b0C water bath for 3\u00a0h. To achieve complete dissociation, the skin tissue was mechanically dissociated every 30\u00a0min with a 1mL pipette. After 40\u00a0min of dissociation, DNAseI was added to the medium. After 3\u00a0h of incubation, the dissociation tubes were immediately placed on ice. Any remaining skin pieces were then mechanically dissociated using an up-and-down motion, first with a 1mL pipette and then with a glass Pasteur pipette precoated with FBS. To stop the action of the enzymes, 30mLof RPMI containing 10% FBS was added to each tube. The tubes were then centrifuged at 300\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min. After discarding the supernatant, the pellet was gently resuspended in 5mL RPMI and filtered through a 100\u00a0\u03bcm filter, followed by a 70\u00a0\u03bcm filter, and finally a 30\u00a0\u03bcm filter to remove any remaining tissue fragments or cellular debris. The cells were then centrifuged again at 300\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min and resuspended in a solution of PBS/1% BSA. To assess cell viability, DAPI viability dye was added at a concentration of 5\u00a0\u00b5g/mL. The prepared cells were then sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) at the IMRB FACS facility. The sorting process was based on cell DAPI labeling and tomato fluorescence to ensure selection of viable and relevant cell populations. 18-hour dissociation protocol Animals were anesthetized, shaved, depilated, and perfused transcardially with 50mL PBS to remove any blood. Their skin was carefully dissected, and adipose tissue was removed with scalpels, which was supplemented by three successive washes in 30 mL RPMI. Each piece of skin was then carefully placed in a petri dish, epidermis side down, and treated with 15mL of 0.15% trypsin-EDTA for 30\u00a0min at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. After this incubation, the skins were removed from the trypsin-EDTA solution and placed in a PBS/5%FBS solution at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, where the detached epidermis was gently scraped off with scalpels. The skins were then washed three times in 30mL RPMI before being exposed to the trypsin-EDTA medium for another 30\u00a0min at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. After this second incubation, the enzymatically-dissociated epidermis was scrapped of using the same procedure. After a final rinse with RPMI, the skins were carefully dissected under a Leica epi-fluorescence microscope to isolate cNFs and HLS regions. Small pieces (2\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u00a0mm) of each sample type were cut and then immersed (six pieces per well) in 2\u00a0ml-DMEM medium containing 10% FBS, 10% penicillin/streptomycin, and Liberase DH (0.25\u00a0mg/mL). The filled 6-well plate was then placed into an incubator (37\u00a0\u00b0C, 5% CO2) for 18\u00a0h overnight without shaking. The next day, to stop the action of the enzymes, 8mL DMEM medium containing 10% FBS was added to each well, which was followed by gentle mechanical dissociation with a 1mL pipette. The tubes were then centrifuged at 300\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min. After discarding the supernatant, the pellet was gently resuspended in 5mL of DMEM and filtered through a 100\u00a0\u03bcm filter, which was followed by a 70\u00a0\u03bcm filter, and finally a 30\u00a0\u03bcm filter to remove any remaining tissue fragments or cellular debris. The cells were then centrifuged again at 300\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min and resuspended in a solution of PBS/1% BSA. To assess cell viability, DAPI viability dye was added at a concentration of 5\u00a0\u00b5g/mL. The prepared cells were then sorted using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) at the IMRB FACS facility. The sorting process was based on DAPI labeling of the cells to ensure the selection of viable cell populations. Single-cell RNA sequencing Approximately 25,000 cells were loaded into one channel of the Chromium system using the V3.1 single-cell reagent kit (10X Genomics) to generate single-cell GEMs. After capture and lysis, cDNAs were synthesized, and then amplified by PCR for 12 cycles according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (10X Genomics). The amplified cDNAs were used to generate Illumina sequencing libraries, each of which was sequenced on a Nextseq500 Illumina flow cell. Bioinformatic analyses BCL files were processed using 10x Genomics Cell Ranger 7.0.1. Reads were mapped to a custom mouse transcriptome based on the GRCm39 release 108 transcriptome, to which we added sequences such as  tdTomato . For both the custom transcriptome construction and the BCL to count matrix pipeline, we designed two pipelines using Nextflow [ 10 ] and Singularity containerization [ 17 ]. Count matrices were processed from raw matrices to the figures using RStudio and Rmarkdown in order to generate fully traceable notebook for each analysis. To ensure version stability, a singularity container containing R version 3.6.3 (10.5281/zenodo.13145083) and all specific versions for all the packages of interest was developed and used to compile notebooks. Each data set, which corresponded to one biological replicate from one experimental condition, was analyzed individually from its raw count matrix using the Seurat V3 package [ 29 ]. Cells with less than 2 6  UMIs or less than 600 genes were filtered out. Doublet cells were removed using the scDblFinder tool and scds in hybrid mode. Then, cells with more than 20% of UMI related to mitochondrial genes or more than 40% related to ribosomal genes were filtered out. The UMI count matrix for the remaining cells was normalized using the LogNormalize method implemented in the Seurat V3 package. From the normalized count matrix, we used AddModuleScore to annotate cells for cell types using specific marker sets. Finally, cells were clustered using Seurat\u2019s FindClusters function with a resolution of 1, on 20 principal components of a 100-dimensional PCA obtained using Seurat\u2019s RunPCA function from 3,000 highly variable features. The same pipeline was used to combine either of all 12 whole skin data sets or all 11 cutaneous tomato\u2009+\u2009data sets. The data sets of interest were merged using base\u2019s merge function. Genes expressed in fewer than five cells were removed. PCA was performed on the individual data sets. Sampling effect was removed on the PCA using the RunHarmony function from the harmony package [ 15 ,  16 ]. To generate UMAP, the function RunUMAP from the Seurat Package was used. Cells were clustered on the harmonized PCA. To smooth out possible mis-annotation, cell type annotations were grouped by cluster. To same procedure was used to build the four-cell type-related data sets. Cells were extracted from each individual data set based on single cell or cluster smoothen annotation. After the first processing as for the atlas, possible contaminating cells were automatically removed by clustering and marker genes. A second processing was applied to selected cells. For each cell type-related data set, the sample effect was removed from the normalized count matrix using the harmony package, with UMAPs obtained. Cells were clustered on the corrected space and re-annotated. Annotation was smoothed at the cluster level. For differential expression, the Wilcoxon test from Seurat\u2019s FindMarkers function was used. Differentially expressed genes were filtered based on adjusted p-value less than 0.05. To assign a collagen gene score to each cell, the AddModuleScore function from the Seurat package and a gene set containing collagen-encoding genes were applied: \u201c Col1a1 \u201d, \u201d Col1a2 \u201d, \u201d Col2a1 \u201d, \u201d Col3a1 \u201d, \u201d Col4a1 \u201d, \u201d Col4a2 \u201d, \u201d Col4a3 \u201d, \u201d Col4a4 \u201d, \u201d Col4a5 \u201d, \u201d Col4a6 \u201d, \u201d Col5a1 \u201d, \u201d Col5a2 \u201d, \u201d Col5a3 \u201d, \u201d Col5a4 \u201d, \u201d Col6a1 \u201d, \u201d Col6a2 \u201d, \u201d Col6a3 \u201d, \u201c Col6a4 \u201d, \u201d Col6a5 \u201d, \u201d Col6a6 \u201d, \u201d Col7a1 \u201d, \u201d Col8a1 \u201d, \u201c Col8a2 \u201d, \u201d Col9a1 \u201d, \u201c Col9a2 \u201d, \u201d Col9a3 \u201d, \u201d Col10a1 \u201d, \u201d Col11a1 \u201d, \u201c Col11a2 \u201d, \u201d Col11a3 \u201d, \u201d Col12a1 \u201d, \u201d Col13a1 \u201d, \u201d Col14a1 \u201d, \u201d Col15a1 \u201d, \u201d Col16a1 \u201d, \u201d Col17a1 \u201d, \u201d Col18a1 \u201d, \u201d Col19a1 \u201d, \u201d Col20a1 \u201d, \u201d Col21a1 \u201d, \u201d Col22a1 \u201d, \u201d Col23a1 \u201d, \u201d Col24a1 \u201d, \u201d Col25a1 \u201d, \u201d Col26a1 \u201d, \u201d Col27a1 \u201d, \u201d Col28a1 \u201d.",

  "introduction": "Introduction Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by the heterozygous loss of the  NF1  gene, resulting in overactivation of the RAS signaling pathway [ 28 ,  34 ]. Affecting approximately 1 in 3,000 births, NF1 presents with a broad spectrum of symptoms affecting nearly every organ. A hallmark of NF1 is the development of cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs), benign nerve sheath tumors that form at nerve endings in the skin. Nearly all NF1 patients develop cNFs, which, despite their benign nature, are often considered the most distressing feature due to disfigurement, itching, and pain. As a result, cNFs pose a substantial clinical burden for individuals with NF1, significantly affecting their quality of life [ 18 ]. These tumors typically appear at puberty, exhibit transient growth, and their triggers remain unknown. Current treatment options are limited to surgical or laser ablation, which are often impractical due to the high tumor burden and risk of scarring [ 7 ,  18 ,  23 ]. However, advances in in vitro and animal models are improving our understanding of cNF pathogenesis and facilitating the discovery of novel therapies [ 30 ]. Notably, recent clinical trials with a topical MEK inhibitor have shown promising results, with partial tumor regression observed after one month of treatment [ 29 ]. cNFs arise from the Schwann cell (SC) lineage after biallelic loss of  NF1 . However, the precise timing of this somatic mutation and the specific SC subtype, myelinating (mSCs), non-myelinating (nmSCs), the latter including terminal SCs, remain unclear. Beyond  NF1  SCs, cNFs contain a complex microenvironment including fibroblasts, macrophages, mast cells, vascular and neuronal components, all embedded in a dense, collagen-rich extracellular matrix [ \u2212/\u2212 23 ]. To further investigate cNF pathogenesis, we developed an  Nf1-KO  mouse model ( Prss56 ,  Cre/+ R26 ,  Tom/+ Nf1 ) that recapitulates cNF formation. This model targets the biallelic loss of  fl/fl Nf1  and expresses a fluorescent tomato ( Tom ) reporter in  Prss56 -expressing boundary cap (BC) cells and their derivatives [ 27 ]. BCs are neural crest-derived cells located at nerve entry and exit zones that give rise to SCs that populate nerve roots and terminal nerve endings in the skin, key sites of neurofibroma formation in NF1 patients [ 11 ]. While  Nf1-KO  mice develop rare small cNFs from 1 year of age, we demonstrated that skin trauma promotes tumor formation. Building on these findings, we established a cNF-inducible model ( Nf1-KOi ) in which cNFs are induced by bite wounds in group-housed males. This model revealed that cNF development follows three distinct stages: initiation, progression, and stabilization, each characterized by specific cellular dynamics. In particular, SC proliferation and MAPK pathway activation occur during initiation and progression, whereas mature tumors contain quiescent SCs with silenced MAPK activity [ 9 ]. Using the  Nf1-KOi  model, we performed single-cell transcriptomic analysis at the progression and stabilization stages and revealed that a BC-derived SC subpopulation, identified as subepidermal glia, is likely the cell of origin for cNFs. Furthermore, we found that tumor SCs, in collaboration with fibroblasts and pericytes, contribute to fibrosis. Finally, we discovered that during the progression phase, tumor SCs overexpress set of genes that govern axonal growth and branching, likely responsible for the abnormally dense and disorganized innervation of cNFs in mice and patients.",
  "results": "Results Loss of  Nf1  in BC-derived Schwann cells lineage transiently promote their proliferation We investigated how loss of  Nf1  in BC-derived Schwann cells (SCs) influences their proliferative activity in young (P45)  Nf1-KO  mice before the onset of cNFs. In mutant skin, the number of SCs was 37% higher than in controls; however, they remained quiescent and showed no MAPK activation, as indicated by EdU incorporation and pERK staining (Fig.\u00a0 1 a-c). This suggests that mutant SCs likely underwent a transient proliferative phase before this time point, consistent with our previous findings of increased SC proliferation around birth [ 25 ]. \n \n Fig. 1 Effects of  Nf1  loss in BC-derived cutaneous SCs. ( a ) Wholemounts of young (P45) control and  Nf1 -KO mouse skins showing distribution of Tom +  BC-derived Schwann cells (Tomato + ). ( b ) Immunostaining showing respectively Tom +  BC-derived Schwann cells (Tomato + ), dividing cells (EdU + ), pERK\u2009+\u2009cells (pERK + ) and myelinating SCs (MBP + ) in P45 control and  Nf1 -KO skins.

Scale bars: 50\u00a0\u03bcm ( a ,  b ), 1\u00a0cm ( d ). hf: hair follicles. P45: Postnatal Day 45. P365: Postnatal Day 365. SCs: Schwann cells. BC: Border capsules. cNFs: cutaneous neurofibromas. TOG: grouped. dpi: days post injury To determine whether the increased SC population consisted primarily of mSCs or nmSCs, we performed myelin (MBP) staining on mutant and control skin at P45. Mutant nerves showed a higher proportion of nmSCs (MBP\u207b,Tom\u207a), whereas the proportion of mSCs (MBP\u207a,Tom\u207a) remained unchanged compared to controls (Fig.\u00a0 1 a-c). This suggests that loss of  Nf1  transiently stimulates proliferation specifically in the nmSC lineage, without affecting mSCs. Despite this excess of mutant nmSCs, none of the  Nf1-KO  mice developed cNFs prior to 1 year of age in the absence of trauma. This indicates that skin trauma, in combination with loss of  Nf1 , is essential for cNF development in this model (Fig.\u00a0 1 d). A single-cell resolution transcriptomic atlas of growing and mature mouse cNFs To elucidate the cellular and molecular landscape driving the development of cNF in mice, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) on cNFs, adjacent healthy-looking skin (HLS), and control healthy skin (HS) at both the growth (P90) and stabilization (P365) stages. To optimize cell dissociation while preserving transcriptomic integrity, we compared a 3-hour versus an 18-hour (overnight) dissociation protocol. The overnight protocol yielded a higher proportion of non-keratinocyte cells (41\u201343% at 3\u00a0h vs. 68\u201370% at 18\u00a0h), including SCs (2\u20133% vs. 8\u201310%, respectively; Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 1 a-c). However, transcriptomic comparisons revealed protocol-dependent differences in SCs and nerve fibroblasts (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 1 d-e). Specifically, more genes were upregulated in cNFs relative to HLS in the 3-hour condition than in the 18-hour condition in both SCs (530 vs. 270 genes) and fibroblasts (285 vs. 70 genes). Notably, fibroblasts exhibited reduced collagen gene expression in cNFs compared to HLS when using the 18-hour protocol (collagen gene expression score: 0.21 in the 3-hour protocol vs. -0.07 in the 18-hour protocol). These results suggest that while prolonged dissociation improves cellular representation, it compromises transcriptomic integrity, leading to homogenization with HLS profiles. On this basis, we selected the 3-hour dissociation protocol for this study. Our scRNAseq analysis included both control and  Nf1-KOi  mice. Control mice provided data from HS, while mutant mice provided data from cNFs and adjacent HLS. Because Tom\u207a SCs comprised a small fraction of total skin cells (\u2264\u20094% in cNFs, \u2264\u20091.5% in HS, as determined by FACS; Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 1 f), we performed scRNAseq on both whole skin cells and FACS-isolated Tom\u207a cells for each sample type. To minimize inflammation-related variability, mutant male mice were isolated for 1 week prior to sacrifice in stabilization phase experiments to ensure that analyses focused on cNF-specific changes rather than injury-induced effects (Fig.\u00a0 2 a, M&M). Two different scRNAseq atlases were generated. The first, a whole skin dataset, included all major skin cell types after enzymatic and computational exclusion of keratinocytes. The second, a Tom\u207a SC dataset, focused on Tom\u207a SCs after computational removal of infrequently detected melanocytes. Cell types were annotated using specific markers, and the presence of tomato reporter expression in the Tom\u207a SC dataset was confirmed (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 2 a-b). The whole skin dataset identified fibroblasts, muscle cells, SCs, melanocytes, vascular cells, and immune cells. As expected, the Tom\u207a SC data set revealed distinct mSC and nmSC populations. \n \n Fig. 2 Single-cell transcriptomic atlas of murine cutaneous neurofibromas.

HLS: healthy appearing skin. HS: healthy skin. SCs: Schwann cells i Cellular composition varied between conditions in both data sets (Fig.\u00a0 2 b-c). In the whole skin data set, the proportion of immune cells increased in growing cNFs, consistent with previous IHC observations of acute inflammation at this stage. In the Tom\u207a SC data set, the proportion of Tom\u207a nmSCs progressively increased from HS and HLS to cNFs in both growth and stabilization phases (Fig.\u00a0 2 c). Taken together, we have generated the first comprehensive transcriptomic atlases of dermal skin cells and Tom\u207a SCs derived from mouse cNFs, along with their corresponding control tissues. Aqp1 high  Nes low  nmSCs are likely population of origin of cNFs Given the established role of the SC lineage in the origin of cNFs, our initial focus was on profiling this population. The data set included mSCs and nmSCs (Fig.\u00a0 2 b). As noted above, the proportion of nmSCs increased in growing and mature cNFs. IHC analysis confirmed this trend, showing a higher proportion of Tom\u2009+\u2009nmSCs in cNFs compared to their HLS or HS, while the proportion of Tom\u2009+\u2009mSCs remained consistent with that of their corresponding HLS or HS (Fig.\u00a0 3 a). These results suggest that nmSCs are the primary cellular component of cNFs, while mSCs are unlikely to play a role in their development. To further investigate the contribution of each SC population towards cNF pathogenesis, we identified differentially expressed genes in mSCs and nmSCs in the growing and mature cNFs relative to their adjacent HLS. A subset of collagen-encoding genes was specifically upregulated in nmSCs, reaffirming their pivotal role in cNF development (Fig.\u00a0 3 b). Given these findings, we focused on Tom\u2009+\u2009nmSCs derived from cNFs in the growth and stabilization phases. Transcriptomic analysis revealed multiple nmSC subpopulations, each characterized by unique marker expression patterns (Fig.\u00a0 3 c, Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 3 a-b). Among these, aquaporin1 (Aqp1) and nestin (Nes) emerged as key markers for distinguishing nmSC subtypes. Based on their expression levels, four distinct subpopulations were identified: (i) Aqp1 high Nes high , (ii) Aqp1 high Nes low , (iii) Aqp1 low Nes med  and (iv) Aqp1 low Nes low  (proliferating nmSCs marked by  Mki67 ,  Birc5 , and  Top2a , indicating growth of cNFs [ 8 ]). To align these subpopulations with known cutaneous nmSC subtypes, including lanceolate glia, subepidermal glia, arrector-pili glia and classical nmSCs, we performed AQP1 and NESTIN immunostaining in young control skin (P45). This analysis identified: (i) TOM\u2009+\u2009AQP1 high NESTIN low  multipolar cells predominantly at the epidermis-dermis junction, likely corresponding to subepidermal glia, (ii) TOM\u2009+\u2009AQP1 high NESTIN high  cells near hair follicles, representing lanceolate and arrector-pili glia and (iii) TOM\u2009+\u2009AQP1 low NESTIN med  cells aligned with deeper dermal nerves, corresponding to classical nmSCs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 3 c). We then assessed the relative abundance of these nmSC subtypes in cNFs compared to adjacent HLS or control HS at different disease stages. A significant enrichment of Aqp1 high Nes low  (+\u2009123% in growing cNFs, +\u2009230% in mature cNFs) and Aqp1 low Nes med  (+\u200958% in growing cNFs, +\u200946% in mature cNFs) populations was observed, supporting their involvement in cNF development (Fig.\u00a0 3 d). \n \n Fig. 3 Profiling of Tom\u2009+\u2009SCs from mouse cNFs.

P365: Postnatal Day 365. Scale bars: 50\u00a0\u03bcm Since fibrosis accounts for almost half of the cNF volume and is mainly composed of collagen, we examined the profibrotic activity of these SC subpopulations. The Aqp1 high Nes low  SCs exhibited increased expression of collagen-related genes compared to other SC populations (Fig.\u00a0 3 e). During the stabilization phase, these cells expressed higher levels of collagen types I, III, and V in cNFs relative to HLS (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 3 d). During the progression phase, a broader spectrum of collagen genes was upregulated including: Aqp1 high Nes low : Collagen types I, III, IV, V, VI, VIII, XI, XV, XVIII, XXVIII and Aqp1 low Nes med : Collagen types I, III, V, VIII, XI, XII, XVIII, XXVIII (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 3 d). Given their enrichment in cNFs and increased profibrotic activity, we propose that Aqp1 high Nes low  SCs could be the cells of origin. To further investigate this hypothesis, we analyzed the transcriptomic changes in growing and mature cNFs compared to HLS or HS. This revealed an upregulation of several matrisome-associated genes, including  Postn ,  Tnc ,  Tgfbi , and  Abi3bp  (Fig.\u00a0 3 f). cNFs show dense and disorganized innervation pattern We observed that  Nf1 -mutant nmSCs in growing cNFs specifically express genes involved in axon guidance, growth, and branching compared to HS, HLS, and mature cNFs (Fig.\u00a0 4 a). This gene expression profile includes both axon repulsion and axon attraction functions. Within this population, Aqp1 high Nes low  SCs overexpress genes encoding the neurotrophic factor NGF and the pan-neuronal marker UCHL1 (PGP9.5) (Fig.\u00a0 4 c). This \u201caxon guidance and growth\u201d signature prompted us to investigate cNF innervation in mutant mice and NF1 individuals. \n \n Fig. 4 Mutant SCs express genes that regulate axon growth and branching.

P365: Postnatal Day 365. Scale bars: 50\u00a0\u03bcm We first performed IHC on growing and mature cNFs and HLS in mice using PGP9.5. During the growing phase, cNFs exhibited an unusually dense and disorganized network of PGP9.5\u2009+\u2009axons compared to HLS, along with Tom\u2009+\u2009SCs expressing this marker, confirming our scRNAseq findings. This aberrant axonal phenotype persisted into the stabilization phase, indicating a persistent, pathological innervation of cNFs (Fig.\u00a0 4 d). Next, we analyzed cNF innervation in 16 NF1 patients using PGP9.5 in combination with the SC marker S100\u03b2. As a control, we examined HLS from the contralateral skin side. All 16 cNFs showed a dense and disorganized axonal network (Fig.\u00a0 4 e). Because PGP9.5 is a pan-neuronal marker, we could not determine the specific neuronal subtypes that innervate cNFs. However, the close contact between tumor SCs and axons suggests that almost all mutant SCs remain associated with the extra-numerical axons in cNFs. This is in contrast to plexiform NFs, where tumor SCs are reported to detach from axons [ 33 ]. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that cNF development is associated with abnormally dense and disorganized innervation. Tumor SCs express genes involved in axon guidance and growth, which could contribute to this phenotype. Dermal and nerve-associated fibroblasts contribute to fibrosis in cNFs Fibroblasts (Fb) are the second major cellular component of cNFs and a major source of fibrosis. To better understand their role, we analyzed Fb within the whole skin data set. First, Fb were extracted and annotated using specific markers (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 4 a) [ 12 ], allowing for the identification of multiple Fb populations, including dermal papilla (anagen DP| telogen DP-FIB), dermal sheath (DS-FIB), hypodermal/adventitial fibroblasts (Hyp-FIB| Adv-FIB), as well as endoneurial (Endo-FIB) and perineurial Fbs (Peri-FIB). Because it was difficult to distinguish between dermal and epineurial Fbs, these groups were combined into a single population (Dermal-FIB| Epi-FIB) (Fig.\u00a0 5 a). \n \n Fig. 5 Characterization of fibroblast subpopulations and ECM from cNFs.

Scale bars: 50\u00a0\u03bcm Analysis of Fb proportions in different conditions demonstrated significant changes (Fig.\u00a0 5 b). In mutant HLS compared to HS, the proportion of Endo-FIB increased from 1.5% to ~\u20096%, Peri-FIB from 1% to ~\u20093%, and Dermal| Epi-FIB from 6.5 to 11%. In growing cNFs (P90), the proportion of Dermal| Epi-FIB further increased to 19%, DS-FIB from 10 to 17%, and Hyp-FIB| Adv-FIB from 1 to 4%. In mature cNFs (P365), these differences persisted, with Dermal| Epi-FIB increasing to 20% and Peri-FIB to 7%. Taken together, dermal and nerve-associated Fb populations were more abundant in growing and mature cNFs compared to HS. However, no evidence of increased proliferation was observed in these populations based on the expression of  Mki67 ,  Birc5 , (data not shown), and  Top2a  (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 4 c). Analysis of collagen gene expression revealed an upregulation in all Fb populations in growing cNFs (Fig.\u00a0 5 c-d). This \u201cfibrogenic\u201d signature became more selective in mature cNFs (P365), where collagen gene activation was restricted to Dermal| Epi-FIB, DS-FIB, and Peri-FIB. The sustained increase in collagen expression in Dermal| Epi-FIB throughout cNFs development suggests that this population plays a key role in cNFs fibrosis. Further transcriptional analysis of Dermal| Epi-FIB revealed the upregulation of matrisome-related genes, along with  TIMPs  and  MMPs , which regulate extracellular matrix remodeling in growing and mature cNFs (Fig.\u00a0 5 e). Unexpectedly, two matrisome-related genes,  Postn  and  Tnc , were co-activated in both Dermal| Epi-FIB and Aqp1 high Nes low  nmSC populations. While Postn was elevated in Dermal| Epi-FIB cells in both growing and mature cNFs,  Tnc  upregulation was restricted to growing tumors. Both POSTN and TNC are glycoproteins involved in fibrosis through activating fibroblasts and stimulating collagen production [ 3 ,  21 ]. In addition, POSTN promotes inflammation [ 2 ] and itching [ 20 ], while TNC has been associated with abnormally dense skin innervation [ 5 ] that is characteristic of cNFs. To assess the expression of POSTN and TNC in mouse cNFs, we performed IHC. Increased levels of POSTN were detected in both growing and mature cNFs compared to HLS or HS. POSTN was also observed in cNFs from  Nf1 -KOi het  mice, indicating that  Nf1  heterozygosity in the cNFs microenvironment does not affect their development (Fig.\u00a0 5 f). To investigate TNC expression, we used a skin trauma model in  Nf1-KO  mice, where a small incision promotes local cNFs growth within two weeks [ 25 ]. TNC levels were assessed at 6-, 8-, and 14 days post-injury (dpi). At 6 and 8 dpi, TNC expression was increased in both Nf1-KO and control skin. However, by 14 dpi, TNC expression remained elevated in the mutant but decreased sharply in controls (Fig.\u00a0 5 g). These results reveal a persistently high expression of both POSTN and TNC during cNFs development, underscoring their critical roles in this process. Pericytes contribute to ECM remodeling of cNFs To investigate the contribution of vascular cells towards cNF development, we performed vasculature staining using the endothelial marker Pecam on HS, HLS, and cNFs (Fig.\u00a0 6 a). Vascular density in cNFs remained unchanged throughout the growth and maturation phases compared to HLS, except for a modest increase in growing cNFs compared to HS (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 5 a). Using the whole skin cell atlas, we analyzed the transcriptomic profiles and proportions of vascular cells in cNFs by extracting and annotating each cell type using specific markers [ 13 ] (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 5 b). This analysis identified pericytes, vascular endothelial cells and lymphatic endothelial cells (Fig.\u00a0 6 b). Consistent with the IHC findings, the proportions of these populations remained stable across conditions (Fig.\u00a0 6 c). \n \n Fig. 6 Pericytes contribute to ECM production of cNFs.

HS: healthy skin. P45: Postnatal Day 45. P90: Postnatal Day 90. P365: Postnatal Day 365 In growing cNFs, pericytes exhibited upregulation of collagen- and matrisome-related genes compared to HLS and HS (Fig.\u00a0 6 d, Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 5 c), suggesting their involvement in ECM remodeling (Fig.\u00a0 6 e). In particular, ECM proteases, including  Mmp14 ,  Adam12 , and  Adamts1/2/9 , were upregulated along with basal membrane proteins, including laminins ( Lama2 ,  Lama4 ,  Lamb1 ,  Lamc 1), nidogens ( Nid1 ), and proteoglycans ( Tnc ,  Postn ,  Fbn1 ) [ 11 ]. Interestingly,  Tnc  and  Postn  upregulation in pericytes mirrored expression patterns observed in Dermal| Epi-FIB fibroblasts and Aqp1\u207aNes\u207b nmSC populations. In addition, increased expression of  Loxl2 , known to stabilize collagen crosslinking within the ECM [ 30 ,  32 ], highlights the role of pericytes in ECM dynamics during cNF progression (Fig.\u00a0 6 e). Immune landscape of cNFs A small proportion of immune cell populations (300\u2013900 cells per condition) were isolated, and their transcriptomic signatures were determined and compared with IHC profiling from our previous study [ 8 ]. Using a specific set of markers\u00b2\u00b2, we identified macrophages, dendritic cells, Langerhans cells, T cells, NK cells, and mastocytes in all samples analyzed (Fig.\u00a0 7 a and b). Consistent with our previous findings [ 8 ], the proportion of macrophages was increased in growing cNFs compared to mature cNFs, HS, and HLS, suggesting a transient tumor infiltration. Further analysis of cNF-infiltrating macrophages revealed upregulation of  Mrc1 , which encodes the M2-like macrophage-associated CD206 protein (Figs.\u00a0 7 d\u2013e). In addition, macrophages in growing cNFs exhibited increased expression of  Spp1  and  Trem2 , genes associated with organ fibrosis and tumorigenesis (Fig.\u00a0 7 d). Although  Tgfb1  was not differentially expressed, it was highly expressed in macrophages in all conditions (Fig.\u00a0 7 f). \n \n Fig. 7 Immune landscape of cNFs.

P365: Postnatal Day 365. SCs: Schwann cells Unexpectedly, T cells were the predominant immune cell type under all conditions in our data set (Fig.\u00a0 7 c). To further investigate their role in cNFs, we examined distribution of T cells in growing and mature cNFs using IHC and the CD3 marker (Fig.\u00a0 7 e). Despite their presence in the scRNAseq dataset, T cells were almost absent within cNFs themselves, localizing instead near hair follicles and the subepidermal border. This distribution suggests a minimal direct contribution of T cells to cNF development.",
  "discussion": "Discussion Despite the widespread occurrence of cNFs in almost all NF1 patients, their pathogenesis remains poorly characterized. A major limitation has been the lack of animal models that develop such benign tumors. In this study, we used a model that faithfully reproduces stepwise development of cNFs to construct a comprehensive transcriptomic atlas of tumor SCs and their microenvironment. Consistent with our previous study [ 8 ], we demonstrated that tumor SC proliferation is restricted to the growth phase. Furthermore, we showed that cNF growth is associated with increased profibrotic activity through the synergistic action of Fbs, tumor SCs, and pericytes, all of which orchestrate the synthesis of collagen and matrisome components. Finally, we discovered that tumor SCs express a set of genes that regulate axon growth and branching, likely contributing to the abnormally dense and disorganized innervation of cNFs. Collectively, our results highlight fibrosis and innervation as potential therapeutic targets, which suggests that targeting tumor SC proliferation in mature cNFs is unlikely to be effective. We have developed a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas of control mouse skin, growing and mature cNFs, and their adjacent healthy-appearing skin. To optimize skin dissociation while preserving transcriptomic integrity, we compared short and long dissociation protocols. Although the long dissociation protocol yielded a higher proportion of non-keratinocyte cells and SCs, it significantly altered the transcriptomic signature of these cells. Therefore, we believe that by using a short dissociation procedure, our atlas accurately captures the transcriptomic activities of the major cell types in both control and mutant conditions. This dissociation time information should be carefully taken account of, when generating an unbiased transcriptomic atlas of cNFs from NF1 individuals. Brosseau et al. previously performed a single-cell transcriptomic analysis of human cNFs [ 5 ]. However, several limitations of their study hinder direct comparison with our current atlas. First, their scRNA-seq data were derived exclusively from cNF tissue, without inclusion of adjacent healthy skin. Instead, they compared tumor-derived fibroblasts to previously published datasets from normal skin, raising concerns due to potential differences in dissociation protocols, patient backgrounds and anatomical sites. Moreover, their use of a prolonged overnight dissociation protocol may have altered the transcriptional profiles of cells, particularly non-tumoral cells like fibroblasts, as we have demonstrated in this study. Additionally, their dataset predominantly comprised fibroblasts, with limited representation of tumoral SCs, precluding analysis of their transcriptomic activity. Finally, while our study characterizes two distinct cNF developmental stages (progression and stabilization), their analysis likely focused on mature, stabilized tumors, as most cNFs in NF1 patients are quiescent with minimal MAPK pathway activity [ 9 ]. Our results point to the Aqp1 high Nes low  SC population as the likely cell of origin for cNFs in our model. IHC validation revealed that Aqp1 high Nes low  cells correspond to subepidermal glia located at the epidermis-dermis interface, where they envelop sensory nerve endings [ 1 ]. Their proximity to the skin surface and intimate contact with nerve endings, which are structures that are rich in molecular sensors for detecting various thermal and mechanical stimuli, suggest that such signals could serve as potential triggers for cNF tumorigenesis. Surprisingly, despite their initial location at the epidermis-dermis junction, the majority of cNFs in our model and in NF1 individuals are found in the deep dermis. Notably, we frequently observed a reduced density of Tom\u2009+\u2009SCs and innervation in the regions overlying cNFs in both mice and NF1 subjects. Accordingly, we hypothesize that \u201cactivated subepidermal glia\u201d and their associated nerve endings could retract from their original position at the epidermis-dermis interface into the deeper dermis, potentially affecting the perception of thermal or mechanical stimuli at the tumor site. Monitoring subepidermal glia after localized skin trauma could provide further insight into this process. A hallmark of the  Nf1  mutant Aqp1 high Nes low  population is the activation of genes involved in axon growth, navigation, and branching during cNF development. We demonstrated that the innervation of both mouse and patient-derived cNFs is defasciculated, overly dense, and disorganized, which strongly suggests that tumor SCs contribute to this phenotype. In addition, we found that almost all tumor SCs remain in contact with the extra-numerical axons. While the function of this aberrant axonal network remains unclear, it is plausible that it helps tumor SCs maintain axon contact. This observation is in stark contrast with pNFs, where numerous SCs detach from axons and retain their proliferative activity [ 33 ]. Given that subepidermal glia engulf small-diameter nociceptive nerve endings [ 1 ], we propose that the abnormal innervation observed in cNFs corresponds to this type of sensory neuron. Interestingly, this neuronal population includes peptidergic neurons that secrete the neuropeptides CGRP or substance P, with well-established roles in cancer and other skin diseases [ 4 ,  7 ,  24 ,  26 ]. Further studies are needed to further elucidate the role of sensory neurons in cNF growth and maturation. Additionally, using the  Prss56  NF1 mouse model, we observed that skin trauma promotes cNFs development, while Pan et al. [ 25 ] demonstrated that light exposure can drive optic glioma initiation in an NF1 mouse model. Interestingly, both triggers, skin trauma and light exposure, enhance neuronal activity, providing valuable insights into the role of neurons in NF1-associated tumors progression. Another critical finding of our study is the increased profibrotic activity observed in the Aqp1 high Nes low  SC population, pericytes, and dermal/epineurial Fbs. This activity is associated with the expression of a gene set encoding collagen and matrisome components that support the active synthesis and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Most of these cells are quiescent or exhibit only transient proliferation, suggesting that fibrosis in this context occurs primarily within a quiescent cellular environment. In addition to the Aqp1 high Nes low  SC population, dermal/epineurial Fbs and pericytes show increased expression of the  Tnc  and  Postn  genes. POSTN, whose expression is regulated by TGF-\u03b2 in the skin, is a key contributor to ECM synthesis and assembly and plays a pivotal role in fibrosis pathogenesis through interactions with ECM components and integrin receptors [ 14 ,  22 ,  31 ,  34 ]. POSTN can also recruit M2 macrophages [ 2 ,  36 ,  38 ] and directly interact with sensory neurons to induce itching [ 19 ,  20 ]. Conversely, TNC, although not essential for ECM organization, is often upregulated in pathological conditions including wound healing, inflammation, tumorigenesis, and fibrosis [ 3 ,  18 ,  23 ,  35 ,  37 ]. TNC interacts with ECM components such as POSTN and cell surface receptors to influence cell proliferation, adhesion, and migration. It has also been implicated in abnormal nerve growth in the skin [ 6 ]. Given their diverse roles in fibrosis and related pathologies, TNC and POSTN are emerging as promising therapeutic targets for cNFs. Finally, our study has several limitations. First, while the rapid sample dissociation protocol effectively preserves the transcriptomic signature, it reduces the total number of cells, potentially leading to the omission of rare immune cell populations. The use of single-nucleus RNA sequencing on the same sample types will help address this concern. In addition, all analyses were performed on mouse skin samples. Findings related to the pathological innervation of cNFs and tumor SC quiescence were subsequently validated using cNFs from patients. However, without performing transcriptomic analysis of patient tumors under optimal conditions, it remains challenging to determine the extent to which the transcriptomic signature of mouse cNFs accurately reflects that of patients.",
