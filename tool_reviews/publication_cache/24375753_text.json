  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Children with neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) are at risk for developing numerous nervous system abnormalities, including cognitive problems and brain tumors (optic pathway glioma). Currently, there are few prognostic factors that predict clinical manifestations or outcomes in patients, even in families with an identical NF1 gene mutation. In this study, we leveraged Nf1 genetically engineered mice (GEM) to define the potential role of sex as a clinically relevant modifier of NF1-associated neuronal dysfunction. METHODS: Deidentified clinical data were analyzed to determine the impact of sex on optic glioma-associated visual decline in children with NF1. In addition, Nf1 GEM were employed as experimental platforms to investigate sexually dimorphic differences in learning/memory, visual acuity, retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death, and Nf1 protein (neurofibromin)-regulated signaling pathway function (Ras activity, cyclic adenosine monophosphate [cAMP], and dopamine levels). RESULTS: Female patients with NF1-associated optic glioma were twice as likely to undergo brain magnetic resonance imaging for visual symptoms and 3\u00d7 more likely to require treatment for visual decline than their male counterparts. As such, only female Nf1 GEM exhibited a decrement in optic glioma-associated visual acuity, shorter RGC axons, and attenuated cAMP levels. In contrast, only male Nf1 GEM showed spatial learning/memory deficits, increased Ras activity, and reduced dopamine levels. INTERPRETATION: Collectively, these observations establish sex as a major prognostic factor underlying neuronal dysfunction in NF1, and suggest that sex should be considered when interpreting future preclinical and clinical study results.",

Materials and Methods Human subjects De-identified data from individuals \u226418 years with an established diagnosis of NF1  managed in the St. Louis Children\u2019s Hospital Neurofibromatosis Clinical Program (1994-2013) were collected under an approved Human Studies Protocol at the Washington University School of Medicine. 9 Mice Nf1 +/- GFAP CKO ( Nf1 flox/mut ;GFAP-Cre,  Nf1 -CKO) and littermate control ( Nf1 flox/flox ; CTL) mice were maintained on an inbred C57BL/6 background with  ad libitum  access to food and water. All experiments were performed on 3-4-month-old mice, unless otherwise stated, under an approved Animal Studies Committee protocol at the Washington University School of Medicine. Immunostaining Western blots were performed using pDARPP32 (1:500, Cell Signaling), DARPP32 (1:1000, Cell Signaling), pERK1/2 (1:1000, Cell Signaling), and ERK1/2 (1:1000, Cell Signaling) primary antibodies. Ras activation (Millipore), cAMP (New East Biosciences), TUNEL (Roche Diagnostics), and dopamine (Rocky Mountain Diagnostics) measurements were determined following manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Each experiment was performed with samples from at least three independently-generated cohorts. Behavioral testing Morris Water Maze testing for spatial learning and memory was conducted as previously described . Three days after completing cued (visible but variable platform location; 4 trials/day, 2 consecutive days) trials, spatial learning acquisition was evaluated during the place condition (submerged, hidden platform, constant location; 4 trials/day, 5 consecutive days). Escape path length and latency, and swimming speeds were calculated for all cued and place trials. Retention performance was evaluated during probe trials (platform removed) conducted 1-h after the last place trial on the third and fifth days. Time spent in the target quadrant and spatial bias (time in the target quadrant versus each of the other quadrants) were also analyzed. Visual acuity (n=20 mice per group) was assessed using the virtual optokinetic system (VOS) under photopic conditions (1.8 log cd/m 10 2 ) , as previously described. Contrast thresholds were measured at a frequency of 0.128 cycles/degree and a speed of 5.4 degrees/sec. 10",
