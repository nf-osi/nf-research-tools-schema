  "abstract": "Expression of the GTPase activating domain of the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)  gene in Escherichia coli and role of the conserved lysine residue.  Wiesmüller L(1), Wittinghofer A.  Author information: (1)Max-Planck-Institut für Medizinische Forschung, Abteilung Biophysik,  Heidelberg, Germany.  Comment on     J Commun Disord. 2020 Jan - Feb;83:105942. doi:  10.1016/j.jcomdis.2019.105942.  A small catalytic domain from the neurofibromatosis type 1 gene, NF1-333,  consisting of 333 amino acids between residues 1197 and 1528, including an  additional N-terminal methionine, was expressed in Escherichia coli as a soluble  protein. Its catalytic activity under non-saturating conditions is similar to  the full-length p120-GAP but different from truncated GAP-334. Under saturating  conditions its kcat and KM are lower. Lys-1422, which is totally conserved in  all GAP proteins, was mutated and the properties of the mutant protein  investigated. Lys-1422 seems to be essential for the stability of the proteins  and not for its catalytic activity.  PMID: 1587809 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",
