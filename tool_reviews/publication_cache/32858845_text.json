Selection of NF1 Ontologies The complete list of NF1 gene ontologies (GO) and phenotype ontologies were obtained in the AmiGO and Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) databases, respectively. In modifier studies, the selection of which phenotypes to study is a key step, and in NF1, several phenotypic features are time-dependent [ 19 ]. Then, we selected from both lists (GO and HPO) the ontologies related to the less frequent and variable characteristics and not necessarily time-dependent, presented by NF1 patients, as reported in the literature and in our clinical experience in the Oncogenetics clinics of Hospital de Cl\u00ednicas de Porto Alegre [ 16 , 78 , 79 ]. For example, cutaneous neurofibromas are common and may occur in up to 99% of NF1 patients in a cohort; this is a variable characteristic, mainly in the number of neurofibromas, but it is less variable when considering their presence in NF1 patients. Thus, we focused on ontologies related to characteristics that occur in a smaller number of patients to try to explain the variability of less common but more aggressive NF1 symptoms, such as breast cancer, delayed mental development, plexiform neurofibromas, and facial dysmorphism. The processes and phenotypes selected for the analysis involved NF1 and NF1-related signaling pathways, such as the MAPK cascade and regulation of the Ras pathway, considering the upper ontology in the hierarchy of each database. Hence, some ontologies were not selected because there was an upper term in the hierarchy that encompassed these ontologies. It is worth mentioning that we followed a guide for the correct selection of ontologies to try to limit the bias introduced by the choice of terms and keywords [ 80 ]. The processes were evaluated by two independent researchers and selected for subsequent analysis when both researchers considered it relevant.  4.2. Systems Biology Analysis Networks were generated using STRING database v.11, comprising protein\u2013protein interactions (PPI) for  Homo sapiens . Only experimental interactions were selected, with a minimum required interaction score set in 0.400 (default). The assembled networks were transferred to Cytoscape v.3.7.2 software, with which the network statistics was obtained. Big nodes represented proteins with high betweenness centrality scores and warm colors comprised proteins with high closeness centrality measures. Comparison between networks was performed with DyNet application for Cytoscape v.3.7.2. Complex networks comprising HPO selected phenotypes, gene expression, and PPI networks were assembled using the PhenomeScape app, also in Cytoscape v.3.7.2, using the default settings. 4.3. Gene Expression Evaluation RNA-seq and microarray secondary analysis were performed using studies selected in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases. For the GEO studies, we looked for  NF1  knockdown or knockout assays and selected only the ones performed in human tumor cells. The data extraction was performed manually, and the robust multiarray averaging (RMA) normalization was applied using  oligo  or  affy  R packages (R v.3.6.2). The differentially expressed genes were obtained using the  limma  package (R v.3.6.2).  Firstly, for TCGA, we selected seven somatic tumors with nonsense mutations in  NF1  ( NF1 -ns): bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), brain lower grade glioma (LGG), breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC), colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), and pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PCPG). Despite tumors having a somatic origin, this information can be useful to check how alterations in  NF1  could affect the global gene expression in a specific tissue/tumor (phenotype). We then compared these samples against wild type  NF1  tumors to check which genes were differentially expressed only in the  NF1 -ns group. The gene expression analysis for TCGA data was performed by extracting the data with  TCGAbiolinks  package and evaluating differential gene expression with  edgeR  package. All analyses were performed in R v.3.6.2. 4.4. Random Walk Analysis The heterogeneous networks comprising both the genes and phenotypes selected were assembled in the  RandomWalkRestartMH  package, in R v.3.6.2, and the random walk analysis was performed with the same package. 4.5. Database Research  Other databases consulted to obtain data for the potential NF1 phenotype-modifier genes were: (1) BioGrid, for curated protein interactions; (2) PINOT tool, for literature data on curated protein interactions; (3) STRING database, for protein\u2013protein interactions; and (4) The Human Reference Protein Interactome (HuRI), for the binary protein\u2013protein interactions. 4.6. Variant Datasets To explore variants in our candidate genes already reported in the general population or with clinical significance, we consulted The Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) v 2.1.1 and the ClinVar archive. For gnomAD, variants were classified according to its annotation. In ClinVar, only variants reported by at least one submitter as a germline were considered and classified according to their interpretations. Finally, an additional analysis was performed consulting the 79,720 tumor samples made available by the AACR Project GENIE and the 10,967 samples from the TCGA PanCancer Atlas studies, using the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics. Samples were filtered according to their mutational status:  NF1 -mutated patients including only nonsense, frameshift, and splicing; and patients with selected variants in our candidate genes, if available. Then, the clinical data were accessed and confronted with the mutational status to check which cancer types were predominant when  NF1  was exclusively altered and when  NF1  variant co-occurred with variants in our candidate genes.",

  "introduction": "1. Introduction  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a disease with a worldwide birth incidence of 1 in 2500 and a prevalence of at least 1 in 4000 [ 1 ]. The main clinical features are caf\u00e9-au-lait spots, axillary and inguinal freckling, cutaneous and subcutaneous neurofibromas, and Lisch nodules, occurring in almost every NF1 patient. Other less -ommon characteristics are scoliosis, macrocephaly, learning disabilities, plexiform neurofibromas, and multiple other benign and malignant tumors [ 2 , 3 ]. Inter-familial and intra-familial variability in NF1 is extensive: cutaneous neurofibromas may vary in number from dozens to thousands; about 30% to 50% of patients are affected by large plexiform neurofibromas; only about 10% of them develop malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), an aggressive sarcoma and one of the most critical symptoms [ 2 , 4 , 5 ]. Other tumors outside the central nervous system occur in different frequencies between NF1 patients: low grade pilocytic astrocytomas, pheochromocytoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, thyroid tumors, ovary and lung tumors, breast cancer, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, osteosarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma [ 3 , 4 , 5 ]. NF1 is caused by dominant loss-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor gene  NF1 , which encodes neurofibromin, an interactor of Ras GTPase proteins [ 6 ]. Although NF1 is a monogenic disorder of dominant character, only a few associations between a specific  NF1  variant and the disease phenotype have been reported to date. Four genotype\u2013phenotype correlations are well described in the literature: NF1 patients harboring microdeletions have been reported to have an increased risk of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, lower average intelligence, connective tissue dysplasia, skeletal malformations, and dysmorphic facial features [ 7 , 8 , 9 ]; the 3-bp in-frame deletion c.2970_2972delAA was previously associated with absence of neurofibromas [ 10 ]; the missense variant p.Arg1809Cys was associated with developmental delay and/or learning disabilities, pulmonic stenosis, and Noonan-like features, but no external plexiform neurofibromas [ 11 ]; and missense mutations affecting  NF1  codons 844\u2013848 were associated with a more severe clinical presentation [ 12 ].  Apart from the aforementioned correlations, NF1patients with the same mutation may develop severe symptoms or a mild clinical expression [ 13 , 14 , 15 ]. Modifier genes, environmental factors, epigenetic factors, or a combination of them may be responsible for the remaining variability [ 16 , 17 ]. Modifier genes include any genes, protein-coding sequences, microRNA, and long noncoding RNA that influence one or various features of the NF1 phenotype. Primarily, modifier genes were found to be associated with phenotype variation in NF1 in large family studies, and posteriorly, NF1 animal models and knock-in and knockdown strategies have reinforced these assumptions [ 18 ]. Several strategies to discover and understand modifiers genes have been developed to help to explain the NF1 variability and were reviewed recently [ 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 ]. These strategies have identified important candidate modifier genes, and some hypotheses and associations have been established so far [ 16 , 20 , 22 ]. However, many NF1 characteristics and variability remain unexplained. Systems biology is an integrative field that combines molecular biology experiments and computational analysis. Its aim is to understand the simplest interactions in the complexity of an organism by the evaluation of interaction networks [ 26 , 27 ]. By integrating genomics, proteomics, and phenotype information, it is possible to evaluate how each of these elements acts as disturber-mechanism in a specific network. This strategy consists of a very effective and economical approach to explore the disease, and might even be applied if there is little information obtained from differential gene expression studies. Hence, through systems biology tools it is possible to perform genomics research by introducing a forward or reverse strategy. The former is a strategy used by evaluating the candidate genes and how they could explain the phenotype, whilst the second strategy starts from the outcome (here NF1), and evaluates which the genes and mechanisms could be connected to it [ 28 ]. The use of a deep phenotype characterization is a good approach in conditions with heterogeneous phenotypes, when combined with next-generation sequencing data [ 29 ]. For a better comprehension of these molecular mechanisms, ontologies databases have been widely used for a correct assortment of the gene function and in the phenome characterization [ 30 ]. In this context, by using this approach, the present study searches for novel candidate NF1 modifier genes. Considering that the modifier genes could play a role in the NF1 signaling pathway or other related and unrelated pathways, in silico analyses were performed through systems biology tools involving the  NF1  gene, its protein\u2013protein interaction network, and its related genes or phenotype ontologies. Network statistics suggested ten candidate genes and mathematical models highlighted the roles of two of them as NF1 phenotype modifiers.",

To better comprehend the parameters used in each analysis, please see the Methods section. 2.1. Gene and Phenotype Ontologies Analyses Gene Ontology (GO) describes a biological domain considering three aspects: molecular function, cellular component, and biological process. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides a standardized vocabulary of phenotypic abnormalities encountered in human diseases. NF1 GO biological processes and NF1 HPO were analyzed by two coworkers individually. The chosen ontologies are listed in  Table S1 . HPO selection provided 1697 genes related to NF1 phenotype (OMIM 162200), whilst GO filter yielded 1449 genes included in the same ontologies previously selected for the  NF1  gene. When comparing both strategies, it was observed that HPO and GO analysis had 265 genes in common ( Figure 2 a). To assemble a network of the ontologies\u2019 selected genes, we used the STRING tool, observing protein\u2013protein interactions (PPI) that were previously described by experimental assays. The separate networks generated for GO and HPO analyses are represented in  Figure S1 and Figure S2 , respectively. A combined network, comprising NF1 direct interactions (first neighbors) for both GO and HPO strategies is available in  Figure 2 b. 2.2. Network Statistics To verify the nodes with relevant roles in the information flow from the network assembled in the previous section ( Figure 2 ), systems biology network statistics were applied using Cytoscape v.3.7.2 software. Two main parameters were observed: (I) betweenness centrality, a measure based on the communication paths, meaning the nodes with high betweenness centrality could be important in the control of the information flow; and (II) the closeness centrality measure, which is based on the fastness of this information flow (from the central node to the others) [ 31 ]. The resulting network had 1561 nodes, making it difficult to visualize the main nodes. A simplified version, representing only the first neighbors, can be assessed in  Figure 3 . According to this strategy, AKT1 presents the highest levels of betweenness and closeness centrality. However, despite NF1 being a highly connected protein in the network evaluated, it presented low levels of betweenness and closeness centrality, as can be observed by the node size (small) and color (light yellow, compared to the dark orange elements). Hence, we aimed to evaluate HPO and GO networks separately using the same approach to minimize the possibility of overlooking potential phenotype-modifier genes, as described in the following section. 2.3. Forward and Reverse Genetics Strategies As mentioned before, GO and HPO databases are related, respectively, to the gene function and phenotype association. Hence, the observations of their independent networks, previously represented in  Figures S1 and S2 , were based on the forward and reverse genetics concepts.  When evaluating betweenness and closeness centrality by the forward genetics strategy (GO network), six genes were selected:  AKT1, RAF1, LIMK1, BRAF, EGFR , and  PTEN . In the other analysis, the reverse genetics approach (evaluating the HPO network) provided six genes as well:  PAK1, VCP, AKT1, SMARCA4, RAF1 , and  PTEN . Together, the strategies provided nine candidate genes for neurofibromatosis phenotype modifiers. Besides, the network communities were evaluated, and  AKT1  was identified as the network main hub, whilst the  RAF1  gene had the highest score for authority. The authority score estimates the importance of the node itself, and the hub score measures this importance based on the other nodes which are linked to the main hub. Despite the network statistics having provided these candidates, we wanted to observe whether or not their expression was altered in the absence of  NF1 . Therefore, the next step was designed to conduct gene expression analyses to evaluate this hypothesis. 2.4. Differential Gene Expression Networks To comprehend the differential gene expressions (DGEs) of the candidate phenotype-modifier genes, we performed secondary expression analysis on the data available in two public repositories: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Using the GEO database,  NF1  knockdown and knockout assays were selected:  GSE14038  and  GSE115406 . The log fold-change (logFC) and false discovery rate (FDR) values for the ten potential modifier genes in each dataset are presented in  Table S2 . In TCGA, we selected seven different types of tumors for which samples with nonsense mutations in  NF1  were available. We evaluated tumors that presented  NF1  nonsense mutations against tumors with wildtype  NF1 . The logFC and adjusted  p -values, after the FDR correction, for the seven tumors evaluated and ten candidate genes are available in  Table S3 . Despite the somatic origins of these tumors, we believe this information is valuable in order to check how NF1-loss could affect the global gene expression in a tissue/site-specific way, and check for signatures more related to a certain phenotype.  For both TCGA and GEO assays, few genes were evidenced to be significantly differentially expressed, demonstrating that the expression of all the candidates, and for the  NF1  gene, is strictly regulated. We did not identify a variable expression profile between the tumors evaluated, and knockout assays. Therefore, we performed other systems biology analysis with the PhenomeScape application v.1.0.4 from Cytoscape software, assembling a complex network ( Figure 1 , step 3). For that, we used as input (I) the ontologies selected from HPO database ( Figure 1 , step 1); (II) the network generated in STRING tool, as also mentioned in step 1 ( Figure 1 ); and (III) expression data from studies selected from GEO database ( Figure 1 , step 2). The resulting upregulated genes (overexpressed) were presented in red and the downregulated (lower expression) in green. These networks are available in  Figures S3\u2013S7 .  NF1  is downregulated (lower expression) in the knockdown and knockout studies, and upregulated (overexpressed) in the evaluation of malignant tumors when compared to benign neurofibromas.  NF1  is absent from the network when its expression is not significantly altered in the expression dataset. Besides the genes previously selected in the forward and reverse genetics analysis, when evaluating the complex networks, we observed that the  SDC2  gene also had its expression altered when  NF1  was affected. Furthermore,  SDC2  is the first neighbor of  NF1 , which means both genes share a direct protein\u2013protein interaction.  2.5. Systems Biology Approaches Reveal 10 NF1 Phenotype-Modifier Candidate Genes  Table 1  shows the final list of the 10 genes selected as potential phenotype-modifiers in this study and summarizes the strategies by which they were found. We then generated a complex network comprising all the candidate phenotype-modifier genes selected so far, and the NF1 phenotypes they are related to ( Figure 4 ); the phenotypes were provided by the PhenomeScape tool, according to the data available in HPO database. Finally, we used a mathematical model to evaluate whether one of those genes could be a stronger candidate as a phenotype-modifier than the others, which is described in the following section. 2.6. Random Walk Analysis A random walk is a mathematical model known as a random process. It is based on the idea that a gene (node) is an imaginary particle that performs a succession of random steps (interactions) in a network [ 32 ]. Our aim was to evaluate whether these random steps could lead the gene to the phenotype, which was set as neurofibromatosis type 1 (OMIM 162200). For this goal, we performed the random walk analysis with the  RandomWalkRestartMH  package in R v.3.6.2. According to this mathematical model, the  NF1  gene only had to take \u201cone step\u201d (one interaction) to reach the phenotype OMIM 162200. The genes  SDC2  and  VCP  had to take only two steps (two interactions) ( Figure 5 ), whilst the other eight candidates needed more interactions to cause the syndrome ( Figure S8 ). Genes  LIMK1  and  PAK1  also needed a higher number of potential interactions, and hence more steps, than the others. With this analysis, we confirmed all the candidates as potential phenotype-modifier genes. However, the results using this model pointed to  SDC2  and  VCP  as being more directly connected to the NF1 phenotype. 2.7. Literature Review and Genomic Databases Evaluation To check for genetic variants already described in our 10 candidate genes, we looked at two databases: The Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD v. 2.1.1), which spans 125,748 exomes and 15,708 genomes from unrelated individuals; and ClinVar, which aggregates information about genomic variation and its relationship to human health. For gnomAD, we found a total of 11,211 variants ( Table 2 ).  SMARCA4  and  EGFR  have the highest numbers of variants (2575 and 2000, respectively);  SDC2  and  PTEN  the lower (335 and 456, respectively). In ClinVar, germline variants were reported for all genes (N = 5216), with the exception of  SDC2 . Almost half (46.4%) of them were submitted as variants of uncertain significance (VUS).  EGFR  has the highest rate of VUS (67.3%), while all the 36  LIMK1  variants are classified as benign/likely benign (B/LB). On the opposite way,  PTEN  and  BRAF  have the highest number of pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants, corresponding to 32.5% and 23.9% of all reported variants, respectively ( Table 3 ).  Finally, we also explored TCGA and Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) datasets to check for tumor samples harboring both genetic alterations in one of our candidate genes and  NF1 . Due to lack of samples or to the higher mutational and clinical heterogeneity, we managed to make reasonable assumptions only for  AKT1, VCP , and  SDC2 . More details are presented in the discussion section.",
  "discussion": "5. Conclusions We presented here a not yet explored systems biology strategy to investigate  NF1  phenotype modifiers. The public availability of multi-omics datasets makes possible the use of robust tools to generate complex networks including protein\u2013protein interactions, differential expression data, and phenotypes, reinforced by mathematical models such as random-walk. Combining all these strategies, we found 10 candidate genes as potential NF1 phenotype modifiers. Resources and time may be scarce to carry out association studies and systems biology analyses makes possible to better explain the genetic heterogeneity of this complex syndrome. Our results must be interpreted cautiously in clinical application and may guide further in-vitro and in-vivo validation studies, saving time and financial resources. The approach presented here may guide further in-vitro and in-vivo validation studies, saving time and financial resources.",
