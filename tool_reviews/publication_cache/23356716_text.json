  "abstract": "Miniaturized handheld confocal microscopy identifies focal brain invasion in a  mouse model of aggressive meningioma.  Peyre M(1), Clermont-Taranchon E, Stemmer-Rachamimov A, Kalamarides M.  Author information: (1)AP-HP, Hôpital Beaujon, Service de Neurochirurgie, Clichy, France.  Invasion of the brain parenchyma by a meningioma classified by histological  criteria as World Health Organization (WHO) grade I meningioma, implies that the  tumor has greater likelihood of recurrence and a biological behavior similar to  the more aggressive WHO grade II meningiomas. It is therefore important to  detect microscopic foci of brain invasion during surgery in order to maximize  the resection and/or adapt imaging follow-up. In this study, we tested the  sensitivity of two handheld confocal imaging devices to detect foci of brain  invasion in two types of meningioma mouse models: in a genetically engineered  mouse model and in a syngeneic xenograft model. Confocal imaging offered precise  images of meningothelial and fibroblastic mouse meningiomas as well as malignant  meningiomas, which corresponded exactly to the pathological findings. Imaging  showed a sharp definition of the brain-tumor interface and enabled  identification of embedded nerves and vessels. Importantly, in both mouse models  used in this study, extension of tumor along Virchow-Robin spaces into adjacent  brain was detected by imaging. In conclusion, this novel technique, following  validation in clinical trials, may open new possibilities for use in operating  rooms to influence both decision making during the surgery and planning for  additional treatments.  © 2013 The Authors; Brain Pathology © 2013 International Society of  Neuropathology.
