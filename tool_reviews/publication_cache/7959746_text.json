  "abstract": "The gene for type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF1) is most highly expressed in brain and spinal cord, although low levels of mRNA can be found in nearly all tissues. As a first step in investigating the regulation of NF1 gene expression, we have cloned and sequenced the promoter regions of the human and mouse NF1 genes and mapped the transcriptional start sites in both species. We report here that the 5' ends of the human and murine NF1 genes are highly conserved. While no discernable TATA or CCAAT box sequences are seen, transcription initiates at identical sites in both species, 484 nucleotides upstream of the ATG initiation codon in the human gene. The human and mouse NF1 genes share particularly high sequence homology (95%) between nucleotides -33 and +261 and contain several perfectly conserved transcription factor binding site motifs, including a cAMP response element, several AP2 consensus binding sites, and a serum response element. The high conservation of these sequences indicates that they are likely to be significant in the regulation of NF1 gene expression.",
