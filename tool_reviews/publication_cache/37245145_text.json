  "abstract": "Cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs) are the most common tumor in people with the rasopathy neurofibromatosis type 1. They number in hundreds or even thousands throughout the body, and currently, there are no effective interventions to prevent or treat these skin tumors. To facilitate the identification of novel and effective therapies, essential studies including a more refined understanding of cNF biology and the role of RAS signaling and downstream effector pathways responsible for cNF initiation, growth, and maintenance are needed. This review highlights the current state of knowledge of RAS signaling in cNF pathogenesis and therapeutic development for cNF treatment.",
