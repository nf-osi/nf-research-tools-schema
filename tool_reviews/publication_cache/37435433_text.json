  "methods": "Methods NF1  variants in sporadic cancers were compiled using data curated on the c-Bio database and compared with published germline variants and Genome Aggregation Database data. Pathogenicity was determined using Polyphen and Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant prediction tools. Methods Somatic  NF1  variants in sporadic cancers were assembled from cBioPortal.  Duplicate samples, defined as having the same sample identification number and variant, were eliminated. Cancer types harboring fewer than 13  2 NF1  variants were excluded.  NF1  gene variant type and location were compared with all published germline  NF1  variants from patients known to have NF1 based on clinical diagnostic criteria  and Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) data. 3 , 4  To evaluate variant location, the neurofibromin protein was divided into tertiles, representing amino acids 1–939, 940–1878, and 1879–2818. 5  Pathogenicity was determined using Polyphen and Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant. Two-sample  3 t  tests were used to compare the percentage of germline and sporadic variants in each neurofibromin tertile. The Fisher exact test was used to compare the frequency of germline and sporadic variant types. Statistical significance was set at  p  < 0.05. R Script adapted from Plot Protein was used to map variants onto the  NF1  isoform P21359-2 (NP_000258.1).  Additional data and references are provided in eTables 1 and 2 and eReferences ( 6 links.lww.com/NXG/A533 ). Data Availability Data were deidentified and available in publicly accessible databases or from published reports, not requiring institutional review board approval or new data deposition.",
