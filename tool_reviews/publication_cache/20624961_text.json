  "abstract": "Neurofibromin regulates corticostriatal inhibitory networks during working  memory performance.  Shilyansky C(1), Karlsgodt KH, Cummings DM, Sidiropoulou K, Hardt M, James AS,  Ehninger D, Bearden CE, Poirazi P, Jentsch JD, Cannon TD, Levine MS, Silva AJ.  Author information: (1)Department of Neurobiology, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095,  USA.  Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is one of the most common single-gene causes of  learning disabilities. Here, we use behavioral working memory probes and  electrophysiological studies in a mouse model of NF1 (Nf1 heterozygous null  mutants; Nf1(+/-)) to demonstrate that (i) Neurofibromin regulates prefrontal  and striatal inhibitory networks, specifically activity-dependent GABA release  and (ii) is required for working memory performance, with inhibition-dependent  working memory deficits seen in Nf1(+/-) mice. We find that increased inhibition  in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is sufficient to alter persistent activity in  a biophysical model of an mPFC microcircuit, suggesting a possible mechanism for  Nf1(+/-) working memory deficits. Accordingly, working memory assays applied  during functional MRI (fMRI) studies in human subjects with NF1 reveal  hypoactivation of corticostriatal networks, which is associated with impaired  working memory performance. Collectively, these integrative mouse and human  studies reveal molecular and cellular mechanisms contributing to working memory  deficits in NF1.
