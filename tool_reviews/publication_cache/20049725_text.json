  "title": "Integrative genomic analyses of neurofibromatosis tumours identify SOX9 as a biomarker and survival gene.",
  "abstract": "Understanding the biological pathways critical for common neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) peripheral nerve tumours is essential, as there is a lack of tumour biomarkers, prognostic factors and therapeutics. We used gene expression profiling to define transcriptional changes between primary normal Schwann cells (n = 10), NF1-derived primary benign neurofibroma Schwann cells (NFSCs) (n = 22), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (MPNST) cell lines (n = 13), benign neurofibromas (NF) (n = 26) and MPNST (n = 6). Dermal and plexiform NFs were indistinguishable. A prominent theme in the analysis was aberrant differentiation. NFs repressed gene programs normally active in Schwann cell precursors and immature Schwann cells. MPNST signatures strongly differed; genes up-regulated in sarcomas were significantly enriched for genes activated in neural crest cells. We validated the differential expression of 82 genes including the neural crest transcription factor SOX9 and SOX9 predicted targets. SOX9 immunoreactivity was robust in NF and MPSNT tissue sections and targeting SOX9 - strongly expressed in NF1-related tumours - caused MPNST cell death. SOX9 is a biomarker of NF and MPNST, and possibly a therapeutic target in NF1.",

  "methods": "MATERIALS AND METHODS NF acquisition Diagnosis of NF1 used published criteria (Gutmann et al,  1997 ). We snap froze tumour tissues at the time of surgery from patients undergoing treatment at Massachusetts General Hospital. Tissues were obtained from the Neuro-Oncology Tissue Repository at Massachusetts General Hospital in accordance with IRB-approved protocols. We obtained blocks of corresponding paraffin-embedded tumours from MGH-pathology files. Histological review of all specimens was performed by a neuropathologist (ASR) and tumours were classified and graded using current WHO classification. For Schwann cell isolation, we froze tumour in 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), 40% foetal bovine serum (FBS), 10% dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) or directly cultured cells. Live purified Schwann cell cultures were shipped to Cincinnati Children's Hospital, incubated in fresh media until 70\u201380% confluent and cells flash-frozen prior to RNA isolation. Schwann cell isolation We generated NHSCs from trauma victims (Casella et al,  1996 ), and Schwann cells from dermal NFs as described previously (Serra et al,  2000 ). After mechanical trituration and digestion with enzymes, we resuspended cells in Schwann cell media (SCM/DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, antibiotics, 0.5 mM IBMX, 10 nM \u03b2-heregulin, 0.5 \u00b5M forskolin and 2.5 \u00b5g/ml insulin) and seeded onto poly- l -lysine and laminin coated plates. For  NF1 +/\u2212 Schwann cells, we kept forskolin constant. For  NF1 \u2212/\u2212 cells, we provided forskolin in pulses of 1 day every 3\u20134 days in SCM-no forskolin. We assessed the purity of Schwann cell cultures by immunofluorescent staining with an S-100\u03b2 antibody (Serra et al,  2000 ). After 3\u20135 passages, >95% pure Schwann cell cultures were obtained. When a somatic mutation of a tumour was identified, we assessed purity according to genotype ( Table S10  of Supporting Information). In  NF1 \u2212/\u2212 Schwann cell cultures, complete loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was observed. We generated plexiform NFSC cultures, 70\u201395% S100\u03b2-positive, as described previously (Wallace et al,  2000 ). We maintained cells in media lacking forskolin to enrich for  NF1 \u2212/\u2212 cells, and harvested for RNA after 4\u20136 passages. NF1 mutation analysis We carried out mutational analysis of  NF1  in Schwann cells from dermal and plexiform NFs and in solid tumours as described previously. Additional details are provided in  Table S10  of Supporting Information (Ars et al,  2000 ; Serra et al,  2001 ; Upadhyaya et al,  2006 ). MPNST cell cultures We maintained MPNST cell lines ST88-14, STS26T, S520, S462, 88-3, 90-8 and YST1 as described previously (Miller et al,  2006 ). We isolated RNA from cells under standard growth conditions for each cell line. RNA isolation and microarray hybridization We isolated total RNA from frozen tissue and cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and verified RNA integrity with an Agilent Bioanalyser 2100 (with typical 28S/18S ratios = 2 \u00b1 0.1). We generated biotinylated cDNA probes from a single round of DNA displacement synthesis amplification of 20 ng total RNA (Ovation Biotin RNA Amplification and Labelling System; NuGen) for hybridization to the whole-genome Affymetrix GeneChip HU133 Plus 2.0 using the Affymetrix protocol. We used an Affymetrix Gene Array scanner and GeneChip Operating Software V1.4 to scan and quantify GeneChips using default settings. We processed 86 samples in 9 batches, including: 9 universal tissue reference samples, 10 NHSC samples, 11 dNFSC samples, 11 pNFSC samples, 13 MPNST cell line samples, 13 dNF, 13 pNF and 6 MPNSTs. We used Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0 to generate \u2018CEL\u2019 files for each sample that were normalized using the Robust Multichip Analysis (RMA) algorithm as implemented in Bioconductor/R (Irizarry et al,  2003 ). Microarray data quality control and power analysis We assessed array images for spatial defect using the GEODEX (Kim et al,  2006 ) and a deleted residuals approach (Persson et al,  2005 ). Chips with high spatial artefacts or large deviations from outliers ( n  = 2) were discarded. One normalization control sample failed quality control and we re-ran the entire batch of samples. Data analysis strategy We used a custom GeneChip library file (CDF) based on Refseq target definitions (Hs133P REFSEQ Version 8) to provide accurate interpretation of GeneChip data (Dai et al,  2005 ). To identify gene expression changes relative to NHSCs, we applied a two-stage referencing strategy: we set the normalized gene expression level value for each transcript in each sample to its ratio relative to the expression of that transcript's measurement in the universal tissue reference; then, we set the normalized gene expression level value for each transcript in each sample to its ratio relative to the median expression of that transcript's measurements across NHSCs. An ANOVA ( p  \u2264 0.001) was used to compare NHSCs, dNFSCs, pNFSCs and MPNST cell lines. Statistical comparisons and data visualization were performed using GeneSpring GX v7.3.1 (Agilent Technologies). We corrected results from the primary analysis for multiple testing effects by applying the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate correction (Benjamini et al,  2001 ) (FDR \u2264 0.001). Transcripts were assigned to empirically defined expression patterns using the  k -means clustering algorithm, which generally finds a clustering solution with a smaller within-cluster sum of distances (meaning a more homogeneous cluster) than hierarchical clustering techniques. We used Pearson correlation as a similarity measure and iteratively clustered genes until convergence, then tested an additional five random clusters to ensure that the optimal clustering solution had been identified. To identify genes sharing common gene expression patterns in cultured cells and solid tumours, we re-clustered each cluster across NHSCs, NFs and MPNSTs. We identified three principle patterns of gene expression and genes were assigned to each using  k -means clustering. We pooled sub-clusters displaying a similar pattern of gene expression in NFs and MPNSTs as the original cultured cell cluster with all other similarly expressed sub-clusters. A total of 1,708 transcripts were obtained that were subsequently used to generate a heat map including the entire sample set. We identified statistically over-represented Gene Ontologies and both KEGG and BioCarta pathways ( p  < 0.05) using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) 2007 at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) (Huang da et al,  2007 ). We used the Gene Association to Anatomic and Clinical Abnormalities (GATACA) web server to select genes based upon association with nerve development, NF1 or MPNST. Schwann cell development orthologues comparison We used a data set in which Schwann cells were isolated from mouse embryos using PLP promoter-driven GFP at various stages of development (Buchstaller et al,  2004 ), and re-analysed the files processed by the GEO database-deposited Microarray Suite (Affymetrix). Probe sets were normalized per chip by a median intensity distribution and then referenced to the median of each probeset across the 19 microarrays in the data set. Probe sets were filtered for those identified by Microarray Suite as \u2018Present\u2019 in \u22652 of the 19 arrays, resulting in 8,617 probe sets. An ANOVA ( p  \u2264 0.2) was used to identify the differential expression between E9, E12, E14, E16, E18 and P0. We corrected the results for multiple testing effects by applying the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate correction (FDR \u2264 0.2). The 4,750 identified probe sets were subjected to hierarchical tree clustering using Pearson correlation similarity measure for genes (average linkage) and distance correlation similarity measure for samples (average linkage). Three major clusters were identified with dominant expression at E9 (neural crest), E12\u2013E14 (Schwann cell precursor) and E18\u2013P0 (immature Schwann cell) (Fig S1 of Supporting Information). We eliminated redundant probe sets, lack of corresponding gene orthologues and platform-specific gene representation differences using orthologue gene mapping, and then tabulated the overlap between each developmental signature and each cluster from the NF1 tumour signature. Contingency tables were constructed and we performed Fisher's exact test with  R  to identify developmental signatures that were statistically significant. The paper explained PROBLEM: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common inherited human diseases worldwide. Effective therapies are lacking. Peripheral nerve sheath tumours (neurofibromas) are the hallmark of NF1. They consist of benign dermal and plexiform subtypes, but plexiform neurofibroma can transform to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (MPNST), a highly aggressive, life-threatening sarcoma. Neurofibromas are composed of multiple cell types, including Schwann cells, the pathogenic cell type of NF1. The molecular changes that drive tumourigenesis are largely unknown. RESULTS: The authors used DNA microarrays to profile the gene expression in normal Schwann cells, Schwann cells cultured from primary benign neurofibromas (dermal and plexiform subtypes), MPNST cell lines and solid tumours. It was found that neurofibromas repress gene programmes normally expressed in late-developing immature Schwann cells, while MPNSTs activate gene programmes normally expressed earlier in the development at the neural crest stage. Strong expression of the transcription factor SOX9 is seen in neurofibroma and MPNST tissue sections, while schwannomas show weak or absent expression. Synovial sarcomas, which may histologically mimic MPNST, are mainly negative. Reduction of SOX9 expression in MPNST cell lines causes cell death. IMPACT: SOX9 expression provides a biomarker of neurofibroma and MPNST. Therapeutics aimed at decreasing SOX9 expression or SOX9 transcriptional targets represent a strategy for killing MPNST cells. SOX9 target gene identification We used Genome TraFac 3  for genome-wide detection of compositionally similar  cis -clusters in gene orthologues between mouse and human to determine putative SOX9 target genes, identifying SOX9  cis -elements within orthologue-conserved regions (\u226570% sequence similarity based on BlastZ alignment) upstream of each first exon in 2,000 flanking basepairs (Jegga et al,  2007 ). We identified 394 unique genes containing potential SOX9 binding sites and transcripts dysregulated in NF-related cultures and tumours. We used Fisher's exact test to calculate the statistical significance of over-represented SOX9 target genes in the gene list. qPCR We conducted cDNA synthesis (Invitrogen Superscript II) and qPCR (ABI 7500 Sequence Detection System) as described previously (Miller et al,  2006 ). Primer sequences for target validation are shown in  Table S11  of Supporting Information. For technical validation of microarray data, a result of \u2265 \u00b1 2-fold in the same direction was considered as confirmation compared to expression of \u03b2-actin ( Table S7  of Supporting Information). Western blot analysis We created cell lysates and conducted Western blotting as described previously (Miller et al,  2006 ), probed membranes with anti-SOX9 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; 1:700), then re-probed with anti-\u03b2-actin (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. #4967) as a loading control. We detected signals using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (BioRad; Hercules, CA) and the ECL Plus developing system (Amersham Biosciences; Piscataway, NJ). Immunohistochemistry We performed SOX9 immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections with polyclonal anti-SOX9 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Antigen retrieval was achieved with microwaving in sodium citrate (pH 6), followed by incubation with the primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C (1:75) and visualization with an avidin\u2013biotin complex (Vectastatin Elite ABC kit; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). We scored SOX9 immunostaining semi-quantitatively for the number of positive cells, as the staining intensity was similar in all samples (strong). The number of positive cells was scored as <25% (+1, some), 25\u201375% (+2, many) and >75% (+3, maximum). Immunofluorescent detection of SOX9 in cultured cells was conducted using a 1:200 dilution of primary anti-SOX9 antibody followed by a TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody and 4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) visualization of nuclei. Viral infection For lentiviral shRNA infection, we infected MPNST cells at 70\u201390% confluence with lentiviral particles containing shRNAs targeting SOX9 (Open Biosystems; TRC library) or GFP (Addgene). The CCHMC Viral Vector Core 4  produced virus using a four plasmid packaging system. We incubated lentiviral particles with the MPNST cells (MOI \u223c 10) in the presence of polybrene (8 \u00b5g/ml; Sigma) for 24 h followed by selection in puromycin at a concentration (2 ug/ml) that killed uninfected cells within 3 days. For SOX9 and GFP adenoviral infections (Paul et al,  2003 ), we incubated viral particles with NHSCs or NFSCs (MOI = 300\u2013500) for 2 h, replaced the growth medium and harvested cells for RNA isolation 48 or 120 h post-infection. MTS assay We plated MPNST cells (4 \u00d7 10 3 ) in triplicate and incubated overnight in a 96-well plate for infection with shGFP or shSOX9 lentiviral particles as described previously. Cells were maintained in the presence or absence of puromycin (2\u00b5g/ml) to account for infection efficiency. We conducted MTS assays for viable cell number on days 3\u20137 post-infection using the CellTiter 96\u00ae Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) staining for cell death We plated MPNST cells (2 \u00d7 10 4 ) in quadruplicate wells of LabTek chamber slides (Nalge-Nunce International), and then infected them with shSOX9 or shGFP lentiviral particles. After 3 days in the presence or absence of puromycin, we fixed cells in 4% paraformaldehyde for the detection of nuclear DNA fragmentation with the DeadEnd Fluorometric TUNEL System (Promega; Madison, WI). One well without terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase was used as the negative control. We counted cells in five random fields in triplicate wells. We expressed Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) positive apoptotic cells as a percentage of total cells visualized by DAPI.",
