  "abstract": "Further exclusion data for the Von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis gene: a  genetic linkage study of 19 polymorphic markers.  Upadhyaya M(1), Sarfarazi M, Huson SM, Harper PS.  Author information: (1)Institute of Medical Genetics, University of Wales College of Medicine, Heath  Park, Cardiff.  Linkage analysis on a panel of 15 Von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (VRNF)  families with 19 polymorphic markers was carried out using the computer  programme M-Link. Our findings have excluded VRNF from a significant proportion  of the genome.  DOI: 10.1136/jmg.24.9.534 PMCID: PMC1050262 PMID: 3118035 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",
