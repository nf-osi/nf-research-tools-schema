  "abstract": "The neurofibromin GAP-related domain rescues endothelial but not neural crest  development in Nf1 mice.  Ismat FA(1), Xu J, Lu MM, Epstein JA.  Author information: (1)Division of Cardiology, Department of Pediatrics, The Children's Hospital of  Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA. ismat@email.chop.edu  Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1; also known as von Recklinghausen's disease) is a  common autosomal-dominant condition primarily affecting neural crest-derived  tissues. The disease gene, NF1, encodes neurofibromin, a protein of over 2,800  amino acids that contains a 216-amino acid domain with Ras-GTPase-activating  protein (Ras-GAP) activity. Potential therapies for NF1 currently in development  and being tested in clinical trials are designed to modify NF1 Ras-GAP activity  or target downstream effectors of Ras signaling. Mice lacking the murine homolog  (Nf1) have mid-gestation lethal cardiovascular defects due to a requirement for  neurofibromin in embryonic endothelium. We sought to determine whether the GAP  activity of neurofibromin is sufficient to rescue complete loss of function or  whether other as yet unidentified functions of neurofibromin might also exist.  Using cre-inducible ubiquitous and tissue-specific expression, we demonstrate  that the isolated GAP-related domain (GRD) rescued cardiovascular development in  Nf1(-/-) embryos, but overgrowth of neural crest-derived tissues persisted,  leading to perinatal lethality. These results suggest that neurofibromin may  possess activities outside of the GRD that modulate neural crest homeostasis and  that therapeutic approaches solely aimed at targeting Ras activity may not be  sufficient to treat tumors of neural crest origin in NF1.
