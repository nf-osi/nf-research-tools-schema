Comment in     Cell. 2008 Oct 31;135(3):408-10. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2008.10.009.  Interactions between tumorigenic cells and their surrounding microenvironment  are critical for tumor progression yet remain incompletely understood. Germline  mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene cause neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1),  a common genetic disorder characterized by complex tumors called neurofibromas.  Genetic studies indicate that biallelic loss of Nf1 is required in the  tumorigenic cell of origin in the embryonic Schwann cell lineage. However, in  the physiologic state, Schwann cell loss of heterozygosity is not sufficient for  neurofibroma formation and Nf1 haploinsufficiency in at least one additional  nonneoplastic lineage is required for tumor progression. Here, we establish that  Nf1 heterozygosity of bone marrow-derived cells in the tumor microenvironment is  sufficient to allow neurofibroma progression in the context of Schwann cell Nf1  deficiency. Further, genetic or pharmacologic attenuation of c-kit signaling in  Nf1+/- hematopoietic cells diminishes neurofibroma initiation and progression.  Finally, these studies implicate mast cells as critical mediators of tumor  initiation.  DOI: 10.1016/j.cell.2008.08.041 PMCID: PMC2788814 PMID: 18984156 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",
