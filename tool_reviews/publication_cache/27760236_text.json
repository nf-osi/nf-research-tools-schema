  "title": "Disease Burden and Symptom Structure of Autism in Neurofibromatosis Type 1: A Study of the International NF1-ASD Consortium Team (INFACT).",
  "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Recent reports have demonstrated a higher incidence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and substantially elevated autistic trait burden in individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). However, important discrepancies regarding the distribution of autistic traits, sex predominance, and association between ASD symptoms and attentional problems have emerged, and critical features of the ASD phenotype within NF1 have never been adequately explored. Establishing NF1 as a monogenic cause for ASD has important implications for affected patients and for future research focused on establishing convergent pathogenic mechanisms relevant to the potential treatment targets for ASD. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the quantitative autistic trait (QAT) burden in a pooled NF1 data set. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Anonymized, individual-level primary data were accumulated from 6 tertiary referral centers in the United States, Belgium, United Kingdom, and Australia. A total of 531 individuals recruited from NF1 clinical centers were included in the study. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Distribution of ASD traits (Social Responsiveness Scale, second edition [SRS-2], with T scores of \u226575 associated with a categorical ASD diagnosis); attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) traits (4 versions of Conners Rating Scale, with T scores of \u226565 indicating clinically significant ADHD symptoms); ASD symptom structure, latent structure, base rate derived from mixture modeling; and familiality. RESULTS: Of the 531 patients included in the analysis, 247 were male (46.5%); median age was 11 years (range, 2.5-83.9 years). QAT scores were continuously distributed and pathologically shifted; 13.2% (95% CI, 10.3%-16.1%) of individuals scored within the most severe range (ie, above the first percentile of the general population distribution) in which the male to female ratio was markedly attenuated (1.6:1) relative to idiopathic ASD. Autistic symptoms in this NF1 cohort demonstrated a robust unitary factor structure, with the first principal component explaining 30.9% of the variance in SRS-2 scores, and a strong association with ADHD symptoms (r\u2009=\u20090.61). Within-family correlation for QAT burden (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.73 in NF1-affected first-degree relatives) exceeded that observed in the general population and ASD family samples. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study provides confirmation that the diversity of mutations that give rise to NF1 function as quantitative trait loci for ASD. Moreover, the within-family correlation implicates a high degree of mutational specificity for this associated phenotype. Clinicians should be alerted to the increased frequency of this disabling comorbidity, and the scientific community should be aware of the potential for this monogenic disorder to help elucidate the biological features of idiopathic autism.",

  "methods": "Methods Anonymized, individual-level primary data were pooled from 6 tertiary referral centers: Washington University School of Medicine ; University of California, San Francisco 8 ; Children\u2019s National Health System 9 ; University Hospital of Leuven 10 ; The University of Manchester 11 ; and The Children\u2019s Hospital at Westmead. For all patients, diagnosis of NF1 was established using the National Institutes of Health diagnostic criteria. 12  Data were collected for a total of 691 unique individuals. Following data cleaning and removal of reports with missing items that exceeded published reliability thresholds, 531 total patients were available for analysis. Individuals ranged in age from 2.5 to 83.9 years (median, 11 years). A total of 247 of the patients (46.5%) were males; there was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of males across sites. Detailed information on the samples collected at each site are summarized in  6 Table 1 . An ASD-enriched subsample (n = 79) recruited for inclusion in an NF1-ASD clinical trial ( eTable 1 in the Supplement ) was also included for the purpose of comparison factor analysis and subsequent sensitivity analysis. Data collection at each site was approved by the respective institutional review boards (University of California, Los Angeles, Institutional Review Board; University of California, San Francisco, Human Research Protection Program; Washington University Human Research Protection Office; Greater Manchester South Ethics Committee; Greater Manchester West Ethics Committee; Leuven University Hospital Ethics Committee; Children\u2019s National Medical Center Institutional Review Board, and Sydney Children\u2019s Hospitals Network Human Research Ethics Committee), and written informed consent was obtained for each participant. The cooperative data-sharing and analysis plan was reviewed by the Washington University Human Research Protection Office, and the analysis of pooled data was designated as nonresearch given the use of deidentified existing data. Measurement of Quantitative Autistic Traits The Social Responsiveness Scale, second edition (SRS-2) is an extensively validated, 65-item quantitative trait measure  designed to ascertain the presence and severity of social communicative and repetitive behaviors that characterize ASD. Items are rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale and contribute to 2 empirically derived subscales that correspond to the criterion domains for ASD as described in the  16 DSM-5 .  T scores of 60 or higher indicate clinically significant ASD symptoms, and T scores of 75 or higher are associated with categorical ASD diagnosis, with a sensitivity of 0.85 and specificity of 0.75 for generating a consensus diagnosis of ASD. 1  For children, the ratings were completed by parents or guardians. For adults, the ratings were completed by either self-report (10 [1.8%]) or by a parent, spouse, or close friend. Ten individuals younger than 30 months and 71 with invalid SRS reports owing to missing data (median, 65 missing items; range, 7\u201365) were excluded from analysis. 17 Measurement of Attention Problems Four versions of the Conners ADHD rating scales were used across sites: Conners, third edition,  Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale, 18  Conners Parent Rating Scale\u2013Revised, 19  and Conners ADHD/ 20 DSM-IV  Scales.  This system exhibits robust sensitivity (92.3%) and specificity (94.5%) for generating a consensus diagnosis of ADHD. 21  Items are rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale and generate categorical scores characterizing impairments in ADHD including hyperactivity, inattentiveness, and an ADHD index (AI) score, which are comparable across measurement instruments. Total AI scores of 65 or higher indicate clinically significant ADHD symptomatology. 22 Statistical Analysis Categorical variables are reported as frequencies and proportions and compared using logistic regression methods. Continuously distributed traits adhering to both conventional normality assumptions and homogeneity of variances are reported as mean (SD) and compared using analysis of variance methods. Nonparametric equivalents were used for data with nonnormative distributions. Within-family association of quantitative ASD impairment was investigated using intraclass correlation, implementing a 2-way random effects model. Correlations between neurobehavioral traits were investigated using Pearson correlation coefficient. A weighted least-squares factor analysis with oblique rotation was applied to evaluate the factor structure of ASD traits with and without inclusion of the ASD-enriched sample. Highest-loading items on the first principal component generated from factor analysis of the ASD-enriched sample were used to derive a principal factor score that was subsequently tested in sensitivity analysis against a subset of cases from The University of Manchester, in which categorical research diagnoses had been previously derived.  With the use of empirically derived SRS factors, a series of mixture models (MPlus, version 7.3) 13  were used to investigate the presence of latent classes ( 23 eMethods in the Supplement ).  Data were analyzed in SPSS, version 23 (IBM Corp). 24 \u2013 26 27",
