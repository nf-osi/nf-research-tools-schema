  "title": "Machine learning in rare disease.",
  "abstract": "High-throughput profiling methods (such as genomics or imaging) have accelerated basic research and made deep molecular characterization of patient samples routine. These approaches provide a rich portrait of genes, molecular pathways and cell types involved in disease phenotypes. Machine learning (ML) can be a useful tool for extracting disease-relevant patterns from high-dimensional datasets. However, depending upon the complexity of the biological question, machine learning often requires many samples to identify recurrent and biologically meaningful patterns. Rare diseases are inherently limited in clinical cases, leading to few samples to study. In this Perspective, we outline the challenges and emerging solutions for using ML for small sample sets, specifically in rare diseases. Advances in ML methods for rare diseases are likely to be informative for applications beyond rare diseases for which few samples exist with high-dimensional data. We propose that the method community prioritize the development of ML techniques for rare disease research.",
