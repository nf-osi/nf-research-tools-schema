  "abstract": "Distinct functional domains of neurofibromatosis type 1 regulate immediate  versus long-term memory formation.  Ho IS(1), Hannan F, Guo HF, Hakker I, Zhong Y.  Author information: (1)Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York 11724, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a dominant genetic disorder that causes tumors  of the peripheral nervous system. In addition, >40% of afflicted children have  learning difficulties. The NF1 protein contains a highly conserved  GTPase-activating protein domain that inhibits Ras activity, and the C-terminal  region regulates cAMP levels via G-protein-dependent activation of adenylyl  cyclase. Behavioral analysis indicates that learning is disrupted in both  Drosophila and mouse NF1 models. Our previous work has shown that defective cAMP  signaling leads to the learning phenotype in Drosophila Nf1 mutants. In the  present report, our experiments showed that in addition to learning, long-term  memory was also abolished in Nf1 mutants. However, altered NF1-regulated Ras  activity is responsible for this defect rather than altered cAMP levels.  Furthermore, by expressing clinically relevant human NF1 mutations and deletions  in Drosophila Nf1-null mutants, we demonstrated that the GAP-related domain of  NF1 was necessary and sufficient for long-term memory, whereas the C-terminal  domain of NF1 was essential for immediate memory. Thus, we show that two  separate functional domains of the same protein can participate independently in  the formation of two distinct memory components.
