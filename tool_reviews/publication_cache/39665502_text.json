  "methods": "2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Participants For this prospective study, participants with NF1 and NS were recruited from May 2021 through December 2023 across the United States and Canada. Typical developing (TD) participants were recruited using local networks and social media advertising limited to the San Francisco Bay area. Sixty\u2010six members of the participant population were reported previously (NF1  n \u2009=\u200920, NS  n \u2009=\u200922, TD  n \u2009=\u200926) (Siqueiros\u2010Sanchez et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2024 ). Proof of genetic testing was required for individuals with NF1 or NS to demonstrate the presence of appropriate mutations. The inclusion criteria for all NF1 and NS participants are as follows (a) age from 5\u2009years, 0\u2009months to 17\u2009years, 11\u2009months; (b) intelligence quotient (IQ) criterion \u2265\u200970; and (c) gestational age >\u200934\u2009weeks. Participants with NF1 and focal areas of signal intensity with no mass effect and/or low\u2010grade optic pathway glioma were not excluded. TD participants were group\u2010matched to participants with NF1 and NS based on age, sex, handedness, socioeconomic status, pubertal status, and ethnicity. For all participants, the exclusion criteria includes (a) presence of neurological or psychiatric disease (e.g., psychotic symptoms); (b) sensory deficits that would preclude participation in assessments or imaging; (c) history of significant head trauma with loss of consciousness; (d) use of psychotropic medications or currently taking medications with central nervous system effects within 5 half\u2010lives of the scan; (e) contraindications to MRI (e.g., metal implants, orthodontia, claustrophobia); (f) history of alcohol or drug use; (g) premature birth (<\u200934\u2009weeks); (h) low birth weight (<\u20092000\u2009g); (i) history of head trauma with loss of consciousness; neurological disorders known to affect cognitive development or brain structure; (j) known presence of gliomas in cerebellum, brainstem, or basal ganglia; and (k) contraindications to MRI. Additionally, participants with NF1 were excluded if they received an MEK inhibitor or chemotherapy, and/or show presence of cerebellar, brainstem, tectal plate, and basal ganglia gliomas. Participants with NF1 and NS are not excluded if they show clinical symptoms associated with typical syndromic cognitive\u2010behavioral features (e.g., inattention, anxiety, learning disorder, or autistic traits). Pubertal status was determined using Tanner staging (Marshall and Tanner\u00a0 1970 ,  1969 ). A full\u2010scale IQ\u2009\u2265\u200970, acquired using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence 2nd Edition, was required to maximize study compliance (Wechsler\u00a0 1999 ). Legal guardians provided written informed consent and participants aged over 7\u2009years provided complementary written assent. The Stanford University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board approved all procedures in this work involving human subjects. All procedures comply with the ethical standards of the national and institutional committees on human experimentation and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008. Eligible participants in this study included 32 children with NF1, 35 with NS, and 36 TD. 2.2 Imaging Protocol The MRI scan was completed on a GE Premier 3.0 Tesla whole\u2010body system using a standard 48\u2010channel head coil (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI). Structural data were collected using a whole\u2010brain high\u2010resolution T1\u2010weighted magnetization\u2010prepared rapid gradient\u2010echo (MPRAGE) sequence. DWI data were collected using a multi\u2010shell acquisition with  b \u2009=\u2009500\u2009s/mm 2  (6 directions),  b \u2009=\u20091000s/mm 2  (15 directions),  b \u2009=\u20092000s/mm 2  (15 directions), and  b \u2009=\u20093000\u2009s/mm 2  (60 directions). Further parameters are detailed in the Data\u00a0 S1 . DWI data were preprocessed (author MR) using FSL 6.0.5 (FMRIB Analysis Group, Oxford, UK), with  topup  susceptibility\u2010induced distortion correction and  eddy  for correction of eddy currents\u2010induced distortions and subject movements (Andersson and Sotiropoulos\u00a0 2016 ; Andersson, Skare, and Ashburner\u00a0 2003 ). 2.3 Image Analysis The data analysis pipeline is visualized in Figure\u00a0 S1 . NODDI is a multi\u2010compartment biophysical model, which models the diffusion signal as a combination of three compartments: cerebrospinal fluid, extracellular, and intracellular, represented by the free water volume fraction, orientation dispersion index (ODI), and neurite density index (NDI), respectively (Zhang et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2012 ; Kamiya, Hori, and Aoki\u00a0 2020 ). NDI estimates the density of axons and dendrites whereas ODI represents their orientational coherence (Zhang et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2012 ). NODDI can be applied to both grey and white matter. In white matter, higher values of NDI represent greater density of axons, whereas higher values of ODI indicate greater axon fanning and bending. In grey matter, elevated NDI indicates decreased density of dendrites, whereas higher ODI suggests more dispersion of dendrites. The NODDI maps were generated using the NODDI Matlab Toolbox v. 1.05 (UCL, UK) through fitting to the preprocessed diffusion data in MATLAB R2023b (Mathworks, Natick, MA). DKI models the diffusion\u2010weighted signal in a similar manner to the diffusion tensor, but with an additional term  K  to account for the kurtosis of the diffusion distribution (Wu and Cheung\u00a0 2010 ). DKI sequences utilize high  b  values to probe the complex neural microstructure and quantify the degree of diffusion restriction. The DKI maps for MK were generated using the  dtifit  command in FSL by including the  kurtdir  argument for multi\u2010shell data (Jbabdi et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2012 ). MK is the average kurtosis in all directions; a higher value indicates greater barriers to diffusion. Similar kurtosis values have been found in white matter and subcortical regions, possibly because both contain myelinated neurons (Maiter et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2021 ). The maps for each participant were quality checked prior to analysis (JP) (Figure\u00a0 S2 ). Average values of NDI, ODI, and MK were extracted from each of the following six regions\u2010of\u2010interest (ROIs): amygdala, caudate, hippocampus, pallidum, putamen, and thalamus. These ROIs comprise grey and white matter, whereas the tracts are predominantly white matter. ROIs and white matter tracts were selected based on prior diffusion tensor imaging studies where significant alterations to parameters such as fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity were found in NF1 and NS (Siqueiros\u2010Sanchez et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2024 ; Fattah et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2021 ; Karlsgodt et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2012 ; Tam et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2021 ). TRActs Constrained by UnderLying Anatomy (TRACULA) delineated 42 major white matter tracts using probabilistic tractography (Yendiki et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2011 ). Further details are in the Data\u00a0 S1 . 2.4 Statistical Analysis For each ROI and white matter tract, an analysis of variance was used to assess between\u2010group differences including age and sex as covariates. The presence of T2\u2010hyperintensities was included as an additional covariate in analysis of subcortical ROIs. Post hoc analysis was conducted using independent samples pairwise  t\u2010 tests corrected using the Tukey\u2013Kramer test for unequal groups. Data were visually examined for approximate normality. The Bonferroni correction was applied to address the issue of multiple comparisons. Bonferroni corrected  p  values\u2009<\u20090.05 were considered statistically significant. At least 18 subjects were required in each group to meet a minimum detectable effect size of  d \u2009=\u20090.88, as calculated based on prior diffusion tensor imaging studies on NS and NF1 (Fattah et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2021 ; Tam et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2021 ). Further details are available in the Data\u00a0 S1 . Statistical analysis was completed by JP in R 4.3.1 (R Core Team, 2023). Multivariate approaches were used to complement our univariate results. For tract\u2010based data, we used principal components analysis (PCA) to extract features and reduce dimensionality. PCA is a data\u2010driven technique designed to capture the most significant sources of variability in the data. The weights of the loadings in the principal components may also reveal the patterns or combinations of variables that contribute most to the variability in the data (feature extraction). Prior to PCA, missing data were imputed using a predictive mean matching algorithm performed by the  Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations  ( MICE ) package in R. 2.92% of data were imputed. The data were then normalized and PCA was conducted using the  prcomp  function in R, which performs PCA using the singular value decomposition approach. Univariate results suggested microstructural alterations to subcortical regions may distinguish NS and NF1, therefore subcortical diffusion parameters were entered into a linear discriminant analysis. Linear discriminant analysis determines the extent to which two or more groups can be separated by maximizing the ratio of between\u2010class variance to the within\u2010class variance. This analysis may identify key subcortical regions or diffusion parameters that demonstrate microstructural differences between NF1 and NS. Linear discriminant analysis was used to predict the probability of belonging to a group (TD, NF1, NS) based on continuous predictor variables (NDI, ODI, MK). The data were centered and linear discriminant analysis was then conducted using the  lda  function within the MASS package in R. Leave\u2010one\u2010out cross\u2010validation was used to test the linear discriminant functions. Leave\u2010one\u2010out cross\u2010validation is performed by using all the observations except the  n th to construct the discriminant function, and then said discriminant function is used to classify the  n th observation. This procedure is repeated for all observations in the dataset.",

  "introduction": "1 Introduction Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) can have severe impacts on functioning, yet treatment options are limited (Homberg et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2016 ). Development of appropriate treatments is hindered by the heterogeneity of NDDs and the prevalence of comorbidities (Parenti et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2020 ). Elucidating the neurobiological mechanisms underlying NDDs is crucial for the identification of targets for treatment. Many NDDs have a genetic basis, therefore neuroimaging studies with a \u201cgenetics\u2010first\u201d approach may provide insight into the neural structure while limiting the heterogeneity that hinders conclusions. While extensive animal research supports this approach (Homberg et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2016 ), research on human clinical populations is lacking. Rasopathies are NDDs caused by genetic mutations in the Ras/ mitogen activated protein kinase (Ras\u2010MAPK) signaling pathway (Tidyman and Rauen\u00a0 2016 ). Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and Noonan syndrome (NS) are common Rasopathies with well\u2010established genetic origins. Mutations in  PTPN11 ,  LZTR1 ,  KRAS ,  SOS1 , or  RAF1  genes cause NS, whereas a mutation in  NF1  causes NF1 (Tidyman and Rauen\u00a0 2016 ). Autism spectrum disorder, attention\u2010deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and oppositional defiant disorder are frequent comorbidities (Garg et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2017 ; Naylor et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2023 ); with several genes implicated in NS also associated with autism spectrum disorder (Pinto et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2014 ). Preclinical studies of NF1 and NS indicate pronounced neural alterations unique to each condition (Kang and Lee\u00a0 2019 ), however, clinical neuroimaging studies in affected individuals suggest similar aberrations (Siqueiros\u2010Sanchez et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2024 ). Neuroimaging methods with greater specificity are needed to elucidate differences, should they exist, between the conditions in clinical populations with implications for treatment and translation. The clear genetic origins of NF1 and NS enable us to gain insights at the cellular level from mouse models of these conditions. In NF1, the  NF1  gene is inactivated which leads to a reduction in neurofibromin expression. Neurofibromin is believed to function as a negative growth regulator for astrocytes, and thus astrocyte production is among the cellular consequences of the  NF1  mutation (Gutmann et\u00a0al.\u00a0 1999 ). Neuron formation, on the other hand, tends to be downregulated in NF1 (Hegedus et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2007 ). In NS, mutations such as  PTPN11 , which encode the protein SHP2, stabilize SHP2 in the active conformation such that the Ras\u2010MAPK pathway is consistently activated. The downstream cellular effects include increased neurogenesis and a reduction in astrocyte formation (Gauthier et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2007 ; Ehrman et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2014 ). Additionally, there is evidence in NS of activated inflammatory microglia, which may play a role in the inhibition of astrocyte formation (Antony\u00a0 2011 ). Recent advances in MRI techniques may allow a more specific revealing of underlying neural microstructure in NF1 and NS. Diffusion\u2010weighted imaging (DWI) techniques are uniquely sensitive to cellular architecture (Alexander et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2019 ). Neurite orientation density and dispersion imaging (NODDI) and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) are two such techniques that enable insights into features of tissue at the microscopic level. Prior work shows that NODDI and DKI are sensitive to alterations in glial cell density (Yi et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2019 ; Zhuo et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2012 ). For example, the orientation dispersion index (ODI) derived from NODDI has previously demonstrated sensitivity to microglial proliferation (Yi et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2019 ), while the mean kurtosis (MK) measure derived from DKI was associated with astrocyte proliferation (Zhuo et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2012 ). NODDI and DKI show promise for the detection of distinct patterns of glial cell alterations evident in NF1 and NS. To our knowledge, advanced DWI techniques such as NODDI and DKI have not yet been applied across the brain to clinical populations with NF1 and NS. A previous study of 17 participants with NF1 examined T2\u2010hyperintensities using NODDI and DKI, however, they did not compare to controls nor to another clinical syndrome (Billiet et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2014 ). NODDI and DKI were applied previously to NDDs such as autism spectrum disorder and ADHD (Kraguljac et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2023 ; Connaughton et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2022 ). The results, however, do not indicate a clear pattern across studies. Our study aims to explore the potential of a genetics\u2010first approach in conjunction with advanced diffusion techniques to identify more consistent patterns. Through our genetics\u2010first approach, we can use findings from animal research on NF1 and NS to draw inferences about the microstructural basis of our imaging findings. Successful identification of microstructural differences between NS and NF1 using these diffusion models would suggest that NODDI and DKI may be useful tools for elucidating the pathophysiology underlying further NDDs. We investigated the potential of NODDI and DKI to elucidate microstructural alterations in NF1 and NS. We hypothesized that alterations to NODDI and DKI would yield disparate findings in NF1 and NS consistent with pre\u2010clinical models. For example, results would reflect the promotion of gliogenesis and decreased neurogenesis in NF1, and the opposite in NS (Gutmann et\u00a0al.\u00a0 1999 ; Hegedus et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2007 ; Gauthier et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2007 ; Ehrman et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2014 ; Antony\u00a0 2011 ). Identification of differences between NF1 and NS would suggest a genetics\u2010first approach in conjunction with advanced DWI may assist in understanding the neurobiology of NDDs and development of new treatments. A better understanding of the distinct effects of Ras\u2010MAPK mutations on the brain, and the ability to non\u2010invasively image these manifestations, would be of value for future clinical trials aiming to develop targeted treatments and improve treatment efficacy in these populations.",

Lower NDI values were found in NF1 and in NS compared to TD (Figures\u00a0 2  and  S3 ). NDI was lower in NF1 compared with NS in the amygdala, hippocampus, pallidum, and thalamus (all  p \u2009<\u20090.0001), with the largest effect observed in the thalamus (an estimated difference of 0.044 [95% CI: 0.034, 0.053],  d \u2009=\u20092.36). Overall, NDI detected the greatest number of differences between groups and therefore showed the most sensitivity of the three diffusion measures investigated.

ODI demonstrated the least sensitivity to changes of the three measures investigated, and the results did not show a clear pattern across the groups. We found evidence of decreased ODI in NF1 compared with NS in the caudate (estimate 0.021 [95% CI: 0.002, 0.040],  p \u2009=\u20090.044,  d\u2009= \u20090.77) and thalamus (estimate 0.018 [95% CI: 0.010, 0.026]  p \u2009<\u20090.0001,  d \u2009=\u20091.39). The pattern of MK results was like NDI where NF1\u2009<\u2009NS\u2009<\u2009TD. Lower MK was found in NF1 compared with TD in the hippocampus, pallidum, thalamus (all  p \u2009<\u20090.0001), and putamen ( p \u2009=\u20090.22). When comparing TD and NS, lower MK was found in NS compared with TD in the thalamus only ( p \u2009=\u20090.017). MK was lower in NF1 compared with NS in the hippocampus ( p \u2009<\u20090.0001), pallidum ( p \u2009=\u20090.0009), putamen ( p \u2009=\u20090.014), and thalamus ( p \u2009<\u20090.0001). 3.3 Tract\u2010Based Analysis of  NDI ,  ODI , and  MK \n The number of participants included in analysis for each tract is shown in Table\u00a0 S3 . In each of the 39 white matter tracts, we found lower NDI values in NF1 and NS compared to TD (all  p \u2009<\u20090.0001) (Figures\u00a0 3  and S4). The means and confidence intervals for each tract are shown in Table\u00a0 S4 . The largest effects were found between TD and NF1 in the middle cerebellar peduncle (an estimated difference of 0.078 [95% CI: 0.060, 0.095],  p \u2009<\u20090.0001,  d \u2009=\u20093.03, Figure\u00a0 4 ), left optic radiation (estimate 0.064 [95% CI: 0.046, 0.082],  p \u2009<\u20090.0001,  d \u2009=\u20092.05), left corticospinal tract (estimate 0.067 [95% CI: 0.050, 0.085],  p \u2009<\u20090.0001,  d \u2009=\u20092.08), and right corticospinal tract (estimate 0.068 [95% CI: 0.051, 0.084],  p \u2009<\u20090.0001,  d \u2009=\u20092.20). Only one tract showed evidence of differences between the clinical groups. Lower NDI was found in NF1 compared with NS in the middle cerebellar peduncle (estimate 0.038 [95% CI: 0.021, 0.056],  p \u2009<\u20090.0001,  d \u2009=\u20091.32, Figure\u00a0 4 ).

FIGURE 4 The neurite density index (NDI) in the middle cerebellar peduncle is significantly different between all three groups (NF1, NS, TD): (A) axial, (B) sagittal, and (C) coronal views of the middle cerebellar peduncle; and (D) boxplots of the NDI values in the middle cerebellar peduncle in each group.

Lower ODI was found in NF1 compared to TD in nine of the tracts; in TD compared with NS in three tracts; and in NF1 compared with NS in 18 tracts. The largest effects (Cohen's  d \u2009>\u20091) were found between TD and NF1 in two tracts, and between NF1 and NS in six tracts. The right arcuate fasciculus (estimate 0.012 [95% CI: 0.003, 0.021],  p \u2009=\u20090.0056,  d \u2009=\u20091.00) and right superior longitudinal fasciculus II (estimate 0.014 [95% CI: 0.005, 0.024],  p \u2009=\u20090.0021,  d \u2009=\u20091.14) were lower in ODI in NF1 relative to TD. Comparisons between NF1 and NS showed reduced ODI in NF1 in the right arcuate fasciculus (estimate 0.015 [95% CI: 0.006, 0.024],  p \u2009=\u20090.0008,  d \u2009=\u20091.06), right middle longitudinal fasciculus (estimate 0.013 [95% CI: 0.006, 0.020],  p \u2009=\u20090.0001,  d \u2009=\u20091.26), left cingulum bundle\u2010dorsal (estimate 0.011 [95% CI: 0.004, 0.019],  p \u2009=\u20090.0020,  d \u2009=\u20091.01), left superior longitudinal fasciculus II (estimate 0.015 [95% CI: 0.005, 0.025],  p \u2009=\u20090.0011,  d \u2009=\u20091.06), left optic radiation (estimate 0.013 [95% CI: 0.006, 0.020],  p \u2009=\u20090.0002,  d \u2009=\u20091.16), and right optic radiation (estimate 0.012 [95% CI: 0.005, 0.020],  p \u2009=\u20090.0006,  d \u2009=\u20091.07). Like NDI, MK was lower in NS compared to TD in all 39 tracts ( p \u2009<\u20090.01). MK was also lower in NF1 compared with TD in all tracts except the rostrum of the corpus callosum and the left extreme capsule. Comparisons between NF1 and TD showed the greatest effects were in the middle cerebellar peduncle (estimate 0.119 [95% CI: 0.088, 0.151],  p \u2009<\u20090.0001,  d \u2009=\u20092.34), left optic radiation (estimate 0.081 [95% CI: 0.054, 0.108],  p \u2009<\u20090.0001,  d \u2009=\u20091.87), and right corticospinal tract (estimate 0.077 [95% CI: 0.052, 0.103],  p \u2009<\u20090.0001,  d \u2009=\u20091.73). The only difference between the clinical groups was found also in the middle cerebellar peduncle where MK was lower in NF1 compared to NS (estimate 0.057 [95% CI: 0.026, 0.089],  p \u2009<\u20090.0001,  d \u2009=\u20091.15). Given the similar findings in NDI and MK, we tested the associations between these parameters using Pearson correlations. The results suggest the parameters are highly positively correlated, particularly in the white matter tracts. For example, MK and NDI were positively correlated in the middle cerebellar peduncle ( R \u2009=\u20090.81,  p \u2009<\u20090.001) (Figure\u00a0 S5 ). 3.4 Multivariate Analysis To complement the univariate results, values for each white matter tract were entered into a principal components analysis. The first component alone represented 49.0% of the variance with similar contributions from each tract (Figures\u00a0 5A  and  S6 ). The second component represented 11.6% of the variance (cumulative variance of 60.6%) again with similar contributions from each tract. The eigenvalues for the first 10 principal components are detailed in Table\u00a0 S5 . A biplot representation of the loadings in PC1 and PC2 suggest some discrimination between TD and the clinical groups (NF1, NS). Subjects in the clinical groups generally have lower values on PC1 compared to subjects in the TD group. Given that NDI and MK values contribute the most to PC1, we can infer that lower values of NDI and MK are generally found in clinical groups compared to TD. Upon visual inspection of the biplot with respect to PC2, subjects in the clinical and TD groups appear to have similar loadings. ODI values contributed the most to PC2, suggesting the groups may have similar ODI values. These inferences consolidate our pattern of univariate results. FIGURE 5 Multivariate analysis. (A) Biplot of first and second principal components generated from principal components analysis of tract data. The values of the datapoints represent loadings on each principal component while colors indicate group membership (blue for TD, pink for NF1, and orange for NS). (B) Scatterplot showing separation between groups TD (blue), NF1 (pink), and NS (orange) following linear discriminant analysis of subcortical ROI data. NDI\u2009=\u2009neurite density index; NF1\u2009=\u2009neurofibromatosis type 1; NS\u2009=\u2009Noonan Syndrome; ROI\u2009=\u2009region\u2010of\u2010interest; TD\u2009=\u2009typical developing. As the univariate results showed several differences between clinical groups in the subcortical regions, we tested the ability of the subcortical diffusion values to classify the subjects into groups using linear discriminant analysis. The discriminant functions classified participants with NF1, TD, and NS with 98%, 85%, and 84% accuracy respectively. Two linear discriminant functions were generated, LD1 and LD2 (Table\u00a0 S6 ). For LD1, NDI in the thalamus contributed the most with a weighting of \u22121.92. Following the leave\u2010one\u2010out cross\u2010validation, the accuracy of the model in classifying NF1 remained high at 97.2% though there were drops in accuracy for TD and NS classifications to 71% and 70% respectively. Precision, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy percentages in training and following cross\u2010validation are shown in Table\u00a0 S7 . The highest rates were found for the NF1 group. Following cross\u2010validation, the precision, sensitivity, and specificity of NF1 classification were 96%, 96%, and 98.4%, respectively. Precision, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of TD and NS classification were similar, with values between 61% and 79%. Figures\u00a0 5B  and  S6  show that the NF1 observations can be separated from TD and NS observations, however TD and NS observations show overlap.",
  "discussion": "4 Discussion Development of effective treatments for NDDs is hindered by the heterogeneity of the disorders and limited understanding of the underlying neurobiology. This study utilized a genetics\u2010first approach to investigate the potential of advanced DWI techniques to elucidate the microstructural abnormalities existent in the brains of children with NF1 and NS. Analysis of white matter tracts found widespread differences between TD and the clinical groups. The middle cerebellar peduncle showed differences between NF1 and NS in both NDI and MK ( p \u2009<\u20090.001). Principal components analysis confirmed that the clinical groups differ most from TD in white matter tract\u2010based NDI and MK, whereas ODI values appear similar across the groups. The subcortical regions showed several differences between NF1 and NS, to the extent that a linear discriminant analysis could classify participants with NF1 an accuracy rate of 97%. These results may have important implications for future neuroimaging research in clinical populations with NDDs. NODDI and DKI demonstrated the ability to image microstructure unique to NF1 and NS, suggesting the specificity of these tools may be valuable for improving understanding of brain microstructure particularly through the translation of pre\u2010clinical cellular findings to human clinical populations. Prior diffusion tensor imaging studies on children with NF1 and NS found widespread reduced fractional anisotropy and increased mean diffusivity in both conditions (Siqueiros\u2010Sanchez et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2024 ; Fattah et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2021 ; Tam et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2021 ). Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity are sensitive to disruptions in microstructural integrity; however, they are also nonspecific measures and difficult to interpret in voxels with complex microstructural properties (e.g., crossing fibers) (Wheeler\u2010Kingshott and Cercignani\u00a0 2009 ). Preclinical studies suggest microstructural differences between NF1 and NS (Gauthier et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2007 ; Lee et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2010 ), however, previous neuroimaging studies in the clinical populations yielded largely identical results in both conditions (Siqueiros\u2010Sanchez et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2024 ; Fattah et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2021 ; Tam et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2021 ). Our results, particularly in the subcortical regions and the middle cerebellar peduncle, suggest microstructural abnormalities that are unique to each condition. Use of diffusion models with greater specificity, NODDI and DKI, enabled improved elucidation of the brain structure in clinical populations with NF1 and NS. Our observations in NF1 and NS are in alignment with pre\u2010clinical evidence. In NF1, proliferation of astrocytes may disturb the spacing between axons and drive a decrease in observed NDI and MK (Gutmann et\u00a0al.\u00a0 1999 ). In NS, observed reductions in NDI and MK are likely due to defects in the oligodendrocyte lineage and the consequent reduction in myelinated axons (Ehrman et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2014 ). Diffusion parameters in the subcortical regions seemed to distinguish NF1 and NS more so than in the white matter tracts, suggesting the grey matter may be the major source of differences between the two conditions. At a cellular level, it is not yet clear why grey matter may be responsible for between\u2010group differences in NF1 and NS. A previous pre\u2010clinical study of NF1 found astrocyte proliferation restricted to the grey matter (Zhu et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2001 ), though more recent work indicates astrocyte proliferation in both white and grey matter (Zhu et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2005 ). The thalamus, a primarily grey matter region, showed lower values of NDI, MK, and ODI in NF1 compared to NS. NDI and MK in the thalamus also contributed the strongest weighting to the linear discriminant function. The thalamus has previously been highlighted in NF1 due to the presence of T2\u2010hyperintensities (Calvez et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2020 ). However, our sensitivity analysis showed that even when all participants with T2\u2010hyperintensities were excluded, the significant results in the thalamus remain. Other studies have also demonstrated that alterations to DWI parameters persist regardless of the presence of T2\u2010hyperintensities (Baudou et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2020 ). The presence of T2\u2010hyperintensities therefore is not the sole influence on differences between NF1 and NS in the thalamus. Further research is needed to understand the effects of NF1 and NS on grey matter. Future studies may consider use of diffusion models such as Soma and Neurite Density Imaging (SANDI), which might provide deeper insight into grey matter microstructure (Palombo et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2020 ). Of the white matter tracts, the middle cerebellar peduncle emerged as the only tract where NDI and MK were both lower in NF1 compared with NS. The middle cerebellar peduncle is the major afferent pathway to the cerebellum, a region often implicated in NF1 due to the presence of T2\u2010hyperintensities (Billiet et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2014 ). This tract is vulnerable to abnormalities, for example myelin abnormalities and intra\u2010myelinic edema\u2014both of which have been implicated in NF1 (Baudou et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2020 ; Morales and Tomsick\u00a0 2015 ). Future research may further examine the middle cerebellar peduncle to understand the importance of its role in NDDs. The strengths of this study lie in the genetics\u2010first approach and application of advanced DWI techniques to NDDs. By focusing on NDDs with specific genetic mutations, we reduced heterogeneity that typically hinders NDD studies. NF1 and NS have similar behavioral profiles and previous DWI of these clinical populations suggested comparable microstructural abnormalities (Siqueiros\u2010Sanchez et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2024 ). However, the specificity conferred by NODDI and DKI models enabled elucidation of microstructural differences between the conditions. The findings in this work suggest NODDI and DKI show potential for identification of treatment targets in the brain in NS and NF1. Furthermore, these diffusion models may be valuable for monitoring the effects of treatment on brain microstructure. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply NODDI and DKI across the whole brain to clinical populations with NF1 and NS. However, this work is not without limitations. The sample sizes are small, particularly in the NF1 group ( n \u2009=\u200925). Furthermore, several of the differences between TD and NS, particularly in the subcortical regions, were small. This may limit generalizability of the findings. Application of these diffusion MRI models to larger and more diverse samples would be valuable as validation of the findings in the current work. Additionally, given that DWI indirectly assesses alterations to brain microstructure, we are not able to derive with certainty the primary drivers of the differences in NDI and MK between the clinical groups. Further research on preclinical models coupled with neuroimaging is needed to assess the major influences on NDI and MK in these populations. Future studies may also explore whether the identified differences in diffusion parameters are associated with unique patterns of behavior in each condition to better understand the brain\u2010behavior relationships in NS and NF1. This study provides evidence of the ability of NODDI and DKI to enhance understanding of NDDs in clinical populations particularly when used in conjunction with a genetics\u2010first methodology. Future research should consider the use of advanced diffusion MRI techniques to elucidate the microstructure underlying NDDs in clinical populations. Use of a genetics\u2010first approach may assist in identifying the distinct neurobiology in NDDs with a genetic basis, such as in autism spectrum disorder and ADHD. These approaches enable greater insight into the underlying neurobiology in NDDs and ultimately may assist in the development of more effective treatments for NDDs.",
