  "abstract": "Objective Meningiomas commonly recur following gross total resection (GTR), and the risk of recurrence is difficult to predict using current classification schemes\u00a0such as the World Health Organization (WHO) tumor grade. This study aimed to create a predictive model of recurrence risk following GTR of WHO grade 1 meningiomas based on histopathological and epidemiological factors.\u00a0 Methods A retrospective chart review was completed for all patients at our institution who underwent their first surgery for a WHO grade 1 meningioma between 2017 and 2022. Those with genetic predispositions, such as neurofibromatosis type 2, were excluded. Baseline characteristics, including histopathology findings, were obtained, and we used a\u00a0Risk-calibrated Superspase Linear Integer Model (Risk-SLIM) with a five-fold cross-validation (CV) to create a predictive model of recurrence over an average follow-up of three years.\u00a0 Results Univariate analysis of our selected variables revealed a significant predictive association between WHO grade 1 meningioma recurrence and subtotal resection but not with any other variable. However, the meningioma recurrence score (MRS) generated by our machine learning algorithm revealed multiple predictive factors of recurrence, including age, female gender, and various histopathologic features, including the Ki-67/MIB-1 index. Conclusions Machine learning algorithms like the one we present here may help identify patients at high risk of recurrence of their WHO grade 1 meningioma, and they are more likely to benefit from closer postoperative surveillance or adjuvant treatment, even when GTR is achieved.",

  "methods": "Materials and methods Following institutional board review approval, a retrospective chart review was conducted of all patients presenting with cranial meningioma who underwent surgery between 2017 and 2022. Individual charts were then reviewed to identify relevant patients and extract operative and histopathologic characteristics. Histopathologic characteristics were collected from patients\u2019 postoperative pathology reports. Patients with WHO grade 2 and grade 3 meningiomas and those with a history of genetic variants that increase the probability of developing meningiomas, such as neurofibromatosis type 2, were removed from this study. Variables were selected given their association with recurrence in prior studies and the frequency at which neuropathologists reported them at our institution. Recurrence was determined at routine\u00a0outpatient follow-up visits with advanced imaging, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showing regrowth of the tumor near the surgical lesion. Patients missing any of the previously mentioned variables were excluded. Variables were stratified categorically to simplify the prediction model and increase the effect size for each factor.\u00a0Continuous and categorical variables were initially analyzed using either the Mann-Whitney U test or Fisher\u2019s exact test. Statistical significance was deemed at p-values of <0.05 for each test. A new modeling method known as the Risk-Calibrated Superspase Linear Integer Model (Risk-SLIM) was created to reduce the variability in risk assessment using machine learning techniques. This technique created an optimized risk score with superior risk calibration using an optimized area under the curve (AUC). The AUC is a score to identify the performance of the model. The Risk-SLIM method has been used in various risk prediction models and has been shown to produce excellent results with external validation. Using this method, a risk stratification score was created to identify patients at high risk for WHO grade 1 meningioma recurrence. To assess risk validation, we also examined the average calibration error (CAL), the mean-squared error between the predicted probability and the observed score. The CAL exhibits how close the model score is to the observed score. Following the creation of our model, a five-fold cross-validation (CV) was utilized. Specifically, the data were randomly split into five separate parts, where the model was trained using four of the five folds, and then the model was tested using the last fold of the model. These were denoted as five-fold CV AUC and five-fold CV CAL errors, respectively. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was conducted to evaluate the predictive ability of the proposed model. All statistics and models were conducted in Python version 3.10 (Python Software Foundation, Wilmington, Delaware, US).",

  "introduction": "Introduction Meningiomas represent the most common primary tumor of the adult central nervous system (CNS), with an estimated annual incidence in the United States of approximately 8.6 per 100,000 people and a median age at diagnosis of 66 years [ 1 , 2 ]. Among all meningiomas discovered on neuroimaging, approximately 32-39% are asymptomatic, and approximately 3% of all neuro-autopsies performed on patients over the age of 60 years identify a meningioma; therefore, the true incidence is likely underestimated [ 3 , 4 ]. The most common presenting symptoms of meningiomas include cerebral dysfunction (48.5%), headache (48.2%), cranial nerve deficits (38.9%), motor changes (30.7%), and seizures (23.6%). Importantly, initial symptoms are often nonspecific, which may lead to delayed neuroimaging [ 5 ]. The World Health Organization (WHO) 2021 Classification of CNS tumors classifies meningiomas into grades 1, 2, and 3, which define approximately 70%, 28%, and 3% of meningiomas, respectively, and are associated with estimated 10-year relative survival rates of 96.8%, 90.2%, and 30.4%, respectively [ 6 ]. Surgical resection is generally indicated for symptomatic meningiomas or those whose location could make resection treacherous if they were to grow. Radiation therapy is commonly pursued adjuvantly when histological margins are positive or as the primary treatment when surgical resection is contraindicated. Historically, the completeness of the initial surgical excision has been recognized as the strongest predictor of meningioma recurrence. In 1957, Simpson reported 10-year recurrence rates after grade 1, 2, and 3 resections of 9%, 19%, and 29%, respectively, bringing focus to the degree of resection [ 7 ]. Following advances in imaging, adjuvant therapies, such as stereotactic radiosurgery, and molecular profiling of meningiomas, the Simpson grade has mainly been supplanted by other outcome measures; however, the extent of tumor resection and the volume of residual tumor remain significant predictors of long-term outcomes [ 8 ]. More recent reports that have considered WHO grade have shown that, among patients undergoing radiation therapy or surgical resection, recurrence rates for WHO grade 1 and 2 meningiomas are approximately 0.00-2.36 and 7.35-11.46 per 100-person-years, respectively [ 9 ]. Even among patients with WHO grade 1 meningiomas status post histologically demonstrated gross total resection, approximately 20-39% will recur within 10 years [ 10 ]. Thus, there remains a need to consider individual predictors of recurrence beyond WHO grade to help distinguish patients who are likely to benefit from closer surveillance or adjuvant treatment from those at risk of overtreatment. It has long been observed that meningiomas occur at a female-to-male ratio of approximately 3:2 and may undergo rapid growth during pregnancy, suggesting possible hormonal influences in its pathogenesis [ 11 ]. One meta-analysis from 2013 showed associations between meningioma and hormone replacement therapy, post-menopause, and parity [ 12 ]. However, large-scale epidemiological studies have produced equivocal findings on the relationship between the biological behavior of meningiomas and their expression of such receptors as sex steroid hormones and vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, among others [ 13 ]. Despite our growing understanding of tumor biology through gene expression and biomarkers, classifying meningiomas has historically relied on histological appearance. As a result, retrospective studies on meningioma outcomes are primarily limited to the histopathologic features that have been the standard clinical practice to document\u00a0such as the presence of peritumoral edema, nuclear atypia, such as macronuclei, sheeting, small cells, psammoma bodies, bone invasion, and the measured Ki-67/MIB-1 labeling index [ 14 - 16 ]. The multifactorial nature of meningioma recurrence risk and inherent subjectivity in histological characterization make it challenging to apply these data to individual patients or in decision-making regarding their treatment and post-treatment surveillance. Thus, a machine learning algorithm that integrates these evidence-based yet disparate predictive factors may be of clinical value. We sought to develop an algorithm to predict the risk of recurrence of WHO grade 1 meningioma based on age, sex, history of radiation therapy, and the previously mentioned histopathologic features, which neuropathologists at our institution have a standard for documenting. Our objective in developing such an algorithm was to shed light on some of the proper granularity among meningiomas classified as WHO grade 1 and better understand which factors may increase one\u2019s risk of recurrence.",
  "results": "Results Following individual chart review, 250 patients were identified as undergoing resection for meningiomas between 2017 and 2022, with an average follow-up time of 3.01 years. Of these, 13 (5.2%) patients experienced recurrence at an average follow-up of 6.88 years, and 3 (1.2%) patients experienced 2 or more recurrences 14-24 months after their second resection. A univariate analysis of the clinical, operative, and histopathologic characteristics between the non-recurrence and recurrence groups was conducted following the chart review. For univariate analysis, gross total resection was significantly associated with non-recurrence, with p = 0.006. Ki-67/MIB-1 index > 5% was trending toward a significant association with recurrence (p = 0.07). No significant difference was noted for any other patient, tumor, or histopathologic feature (p > 0.05)\u00a0(Table  1 ).

  "discussion": "Conclusions The meningioma recurrence score (MRS) efficiently predicts recurrence risk in patients with WHO grade 1 meningioma, even when surgical GTR is achieved. Validating this tool across other institutions and geographic areas and expanding it to include gene expression variables can improve discussions between providers and patients about an individual\u2019s risk of postoperative recurrence and the risks and benefits of postoperative surveillance and adjuvant treatment options.",
