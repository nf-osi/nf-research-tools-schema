  "abstract": "The neurofibromatoses (neurofibromatosis type 1, neurofibromatosis type 2 and schwannomatosis) are rare disorders having clinical manifestations that vary greatly from patient to patient. The rarity and variability of these disorders has made it challenging for investigators to identify sufficient numbers of patients with particular clinical characteristics or specific germline mutations for participation in interventional studies. Similarly, because the natural history of all types of neurofibromatosis (NF) is variable and unique for each individual, it is difficult to identify meaningful clinical outcome measures for potential therapeutic interventions. In 2012, the Children's Tumor Foundation created a web-based patient-entered database, the NF Registry, to inform patients of research opportunities for which they fit general eligibility criteria and enable patients to contact investigators who are seeking to enroll patients in approved trials. Registrants were recruited through CTF-affiliated NF clinics and conferences, through its website, and by word-of-mouth and social media. Following online consent, demographic information and details regarding manifestations of NF were solicited on the Registry website. Statistical analyses were performed on data from a cohort of 4680 registrants (the number of registrants as of October 9, 2015) who met diagnostic criteria for one of the 3 NF conditions. The analyses support our hypothesis that patient-reported symptom incidences in the NF Registry are congruent with published clinician-sourced data. Between April 26, 2013 and July 8, 2016, the registry has been useful to investigators in recruitment, particularly for observational trials, especially those for development of patient-reported outcomes.",
  "methods": "Methods Organization and recruitment to the registry The registry questionnaires [ S1 Text ] and consent language [ S2 Text ] were developed in collaboration with two clinicians who are co-authors of this paper (BK, DV). The questionnaires were piloted in 50 patients and minor modifications were made. The NF registry protocol and informed consent were approved by the Western Institutional Review Board on April 16, 2012. It is Study Number 1131422, WIRB Protocol Number 20120455. All WIRB-approved research is required to be conducted research in accordance with the protocol, applicable laws and regulations, and the principles of research ethics as set forth in the Belmont Report. All participants or their parent/legal guardians provided online informed consent prior to entering any data in the database. Recruitment took place through the CTF website, NF-related Facebook groups, at the annual CTF Patient Forum, through NF clinics and the CTF volunteer network, and through word of mouth and social media. All registrants were required to supply name, sex, date of birth, race/ethnicity, mailing address, phone number and email address. The purpose of collecting race and ethnicity data was to fulfill Western Institutional Review Board reporting requirements, and to identify gaps in recruitment of specific groups. All registrants completed a demographics and family history section. Depending on the type of NF reported, they were directed to a specific questionnaire for NF1, NF2 or SCHW. Disease-specific questionnaires captured features of current published diagnostic criteria [ 12 , 13 , 14 ] and a variety of disease manifestations. They also posed quality of life questions. Participants were offered options with regard to being contacted by registry coordinators, including no contact. For purposes of the present analyses, studies that have recruited through the Registry are classified as either observational; survey (i.e., patient-reported outcomes or quality of life); or interventional. Interventional studies are divided into psycho-social interventions and drug/device interventions. Data are available regarding how many registrants opened e-mails inviting them to participate in a study; however, data regarding the proportion that contacted the investigator, were screened or actually enrolled are not available. Information collected The criteria for diagnosis of NF1 were published by an NIH consensus development conference in 1988 [ 12 ]. The criteria for diagnosis of NF2 are the modified NIH consensus criteria as described by Evans in 2009 [ 13 ]. The criteria for diagnosis of SCHW are those detailed by Plotkin et al. in 2011 [ 14 ]. These criteria were used to create curation guidelines used by the Registry host (once known as PatientCrossroads, rebranded as AltaVoice, and recently acquired by and known as Invitae [ 15 ] to assign categories of “Criteria Met” or “Criteria Not Met” to each participant account. Participants were invited to upload copies of their genetic testing results to their profiles. In addition to soliciting information related to confirmation of their diagnoses, the presence and age at onset of other probably or possibly NF-related symptoms were collected. Registrants were also asked to identify their key concerns related to their disorder. Registry platform Data storage, security and confidentiality A state-of-the-art web-based, patient opt-in registry (maintained by Invitae) [ 15 ] was used for data capture. Patients or parent/guardians of minor patients provided answers to a disease-specific questionnaire via a secure web portal. The registry website could be accessed on mobile devices but was not optimized for them. Although the current questionnaires are currently available only in English, translation of the registry into multiple languages is planned. HIPAA privacy security rules are enforced by policies and procedures that protect the confidentiality and security of protected health information. The database design is such that participant identifying information is stored in data tables separate from participant medical information. Access to patient identifying information is restricted to authorized personnel at CTF and Invitae. Additional database security features of this registry target multiple levels, including data element (e.g., restricted access to fields), user (e.g., password authentication access), application (e.g., role-based access to features, access audit trails) and hosting services (e.g., firewall, secure sockets layer). Invitae uses MySQL Server as the back-end relational database. All server requests are transmitted over SSL and use several layers of data and access protection, with a dedicated, managed Cisco router firewall and a redundant array of independent disks to ensure data recovery if a hard drive fails between backups. Back up (system-level and database-level) performed nightly is retained for 30 days with monthly backups stored for 1 year at the data center. Approval and execution of requests for use Information on applying for access to de-identified data or for trial recruitment is available on the NF Registry website [ 16 ]. Requests for registry use are reviewed by the CTF Clinical Program Director and by the Data Access Committee, a group comprised of NF experts and NF patients and family members. All studies and recruitments must be approved by the investigator’s Institutional Review Board. Only de-identified data can be shared by CTF with investigators. Following approval by the Data Access Committee, The CTF Clinical Program Director extracts from the database a list of registrants reporting the manifestation(s) of NF specific to the study and any other specified characteristics such as age range or geographic location. Search results are used to generate an email list of potentially eligible participants, who receive an email from sent from the Invitae platform. The text provides a lay-level description of the study and the investigator’s contact information. The email advises the recipient to contact his or her healthcare provider to ask whether the study may be suitable for them. The registrant may initiate contact with the investigator to explore study participation. Curation and quality control Data curation was carried out by Invitae according to guidelines set by CTF based on current diagnostic criteria [ 12 , 13 , 14 ]. Each registrant was assigned a status of “Criteria Met” or “Criteria Not Met” according to disease-specific criteria. Participants with NF2 and SCHW were additionally asked “Have you been diagnosed with [disorder] by a doctor” or, in the case of NF2, whether an  NF2  mutation had been identified by molecular testing. (In the case of NF1, genetic testing was not required for “Criteria Met” status because NF1 is most often diagnosed by clinical signs.) Curation also entailed querying registrants by email or telephone for incomplete or incorrect data such as implausible or impossible birthdates. Periodically, all registrants were sent email reminders to update their information. Methods for statistical analysis A dataset for the present analysis was frozen as of October, 9, 2015 by extracting data from all accounts assigned a post-curation status of “Criteria Met” to Excel spreadsheets [S3 Table] using the reporting modules built into the registry. The spreadsheets were converted to text files (comma-separated) and imported into the R Statistical Environment V 3.2.4 [ 17 ]. Tabulations were performed using the stat.table function of the Epi package [ 18 ]. Statistical analyses were performed using the Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon signed rank tests (for continuous variables) and ordered categorical variables and the Chi - Square Test (for unordered categorical variables). In comparing more than 2 categories, the approach was to first perform an omnibus test of the entire set; if that test was significant then the categories were tested pairwise against each other. A  p  value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant and  p  values were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. Unless otherwise specified, when participants entered or updated their data in multiple sessions over time, the data used for analysis was the most recent data entered.
