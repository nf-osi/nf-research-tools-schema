  "abstract": "Gene expression changes in the lungs induced by paraquat (PQ) administration were studied in rats using DNA microarrays that were detectable for 1,090 genes per DNA microarray. The rats were subjected to subacute PQ exposure (7 mg/kg, s.c., daily for eight administrations). Two days after the final administration, the rats were divided into two groups. Group 1 experienced significant body weight loss and displayed signs of subacute PQ toxicity, but Group 2 showed no significant effects due to the PQ treatment. A control group, Group 3, was also included. In the comparison of the gene expression levels in the animals from Group 1 or Group 2 to the control animals treated by vehicle, 48 genes in Group 1 and 29 genes from Group 2 were differentially expressed. The twenty-eight genes were common to these two groups. These differentially expressed genes following paraquat treatment were classified as follows: 5 neurotransmitter receptor genes; 4 transporter genes; 4 voltage-gated ion channel genes; 2 lipid metabolism enzyme genes; 2 G-proteins involved in endocytosis and exocytosis genes; 7 cytokine genes; 4 ADP ribosylation genes involved in cell death and regeneration; CFTR gene, which is the causal gene for cystic fibrosis; neurofibromatosis type 1 gene, which is the causal gene for the neurofibromatosis type 1 that is known to accompany pulmonary fibrosis; and the causal gene for spinocerebellar ataxia. These genes may prove to be the keys for the elucidation of the mechanism of PQ toxicity, e.g. PQ-induced pulmonary fibrosis.",

Ethics Statement The ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Animal Ethics Committee, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) [Approval No.: USM/Animal Ethics Approval/2012/(75)(398)] in accordance with the Institutional Guidelines for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes. Eight-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from the Animal Research and Service Centre, Health Campus, USM, Kubang Kerian, Kelantan, Malaysia. All animals were individually housed in a well-ventilated animal room maintained with a 12-hour/12-hour light/dark cycle and a temperature of 25 ± 2°C. The animals were allowed access to food pellets and water ad libitum unless otherwise stated. All rats were acclimatized to the animal room conditions for at least one week before the experiments started. 2.2. Tualang Honey The Tualang honey (AgroMas®) used in this study was supplied by the Federal Agricultural Marketing Authority (FAMA), Kedah, Malaysia. The honey samples were filtered, concentrated to 20% (w/v) water content at 40°C, and sterilized by gamma irradiation at 25 kGy [Sterilgamma (M) Sdn. Bhd., Selangor, Malaysia]. The same batch of honey was used throughout the analysis. 2.3. Experimental Design A total of 75 rats were randomly divided into five groups of 15 animals each: control (N), honey (TH), paraquat (PQ), paraquat + honey (PQ + TH), and paraquat + ubiquinol (PQ + QH). Throughout the experiment, groups N and PQ were treated with distilled water (2.0 mL/kg/day, p.o.), groups TH and PQ + TH were treated with Tualang honey (AgroMas, FAMA, 1.0 g/kg/day, p.o.), and group PQ + QH was treated with ubiquinol (0.2 g/kg/day, p.o.) once per day ( Figure 1 ). The dose of Tualang honey was chosen based on previous studies that showed protective effects against other oxidative stress-related diseases [ 21 ,  31 – 33 ], while the selected ubiquinol dose was based on the studies by Cleren et al. [ 34 ] and Matthews et al. [ 35 ]. Two weeks after the respective treatments, rats were administered intraperitoneal injections of vehicle (0.9% NaCl, 1.0 mL/kg; Group N and TH) or PQ (Sigma-Aldrich, 10 mg/kg; Group PQ, PQ + TH and PQ + QH) once per week for four consecutive weeks. One week after the final injection of saline or PQ, the rats were fasted overnight and sacrificed for biochemical ( n  = 8 per group) or immunohistochemical ( n  = 7 per group) analyses. Body weight changes, renal profile, and liver profile were included as general health assessments. 2.4. Biochemical Analysis 2.4.1. Sample Collection The rats ( n  = 8 per group) were fasted overnight and were deeply anaesthetized with intramuscular injection of ketamine (90 mg/kg) plus xylazine (5 mg/kg). Blood samples (5 mL) were collected via the portal vein into plain tubes and were allowed to clot at 4°C before being centrifuged at 3000 ×g for 15 min. The serum yielded was aliquoted and temporarily stored at 4°C before being outsourced to a private laboratory (BP Healthcare, Malaysia) for tests of renal and liver function. Immediately after blood collection, brain and lung samples were rapidly dissected out, rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (1x, pH 7.4) to remove any residual blood, and stored at −80°C for subsequent biochemical analyses. 2.4.2. Preparation of Tissue Homogenate The midbrain region was identified and dissected according to the method described by Heffner et al. [ 36 ]. The harvested midbrain region and the right lung were homogenized in ice-cold potassium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4) to produce a 10% (w/v) homogenate using a motor-driven Teflon-glass homogenizer. The samples were then centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4°C. Aliquots of the resulting supernatant were used for the measurement of total protein; the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST); and the total levels of glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA), using commercially available assay kits. The assay kits for quantifying total protein, SOD, GPx, GR, GST, total GSH, and MDA were purchased from Cayman Chemical Company (USA). The assay kit for CAT was purchased from BioAssay Systems (USA). Additionally, the midbrain tyrosine hydroxylase (TyrH) concentration was measured using an ELISA kit from Cusabio Biotech, China. 2.5. Immunohistochemical Analysis of Tyrosine Hydroxylase 2.5.1. Sample Collection The rats ( n  = 7 per group) were fasted overnight, deeply anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine mixture, and perfused transcardially with prechilled PBS buffer, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde prepared in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) [ 37 ]. The brains were removed from the cranium and postfixed in the same fixative for another 48–72 hours at 4°C before being processed for tyrosine hydroxylase (TyrH) immunohistochemistry. 2.5.2. Tyrosine Hydroxylase Immunohistochemistry Midbrain dopaminergic neurons were stained with TyrH antibody for evaluation of midbrain damage based on the number of TyrH-positive neurons in the SNpc region. After the fixation period, the striatum and midbrain were identified and dissected according to the rat brain atlas [ 38 ]. The coronal sections containing the striatum (anterior-posterior [A-P] = +1.5 to −1.0 mm from bregma) and substantia nigra (AP = −4.8 to −6.5 mm from bregma) were collected for immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of TyrH. The sectioned tissues were processed using an automated tissue processor before being embedded in paraffin blocks. Tissue sections (3  μ m thick) were prepared using a rotary microtome and were then mounted on poly-L-lysine-coated slides. Prior to IHC staining of TyrH, the slides were heated overnight in an oven at 60°C to increase tissue adherence. A tissue section from the striatum (as a positive control) and a tissue section from the liver (as a negative control) were included in each batch of staining. Briefly, the tissue sections were deparaffinized with xylene, rehydrated in decreasing concentrations of ethanol, and washed with 1x Tris buffered saline (TBS) wash buffer (pH 7.6; Dako, Denmark) and double-distilled water (ddH 2 O). The rehydrated tissue sections were microwaved with citrate buffer (pH 6; Dako, Denmark) for antigen retrieval, blocked with peroxidase-blocking solution (REAL™, Dako, Denmark), and incubated overnight with TyrH antibody raised in rabbit (AB152, Millipore, 1 : 10,000 dilution) at 4°C. The tissues were then rinsed with 1x TBS wash buffer, incubated with horseradish peroxidase- (HRP-) conjugated secondary antibody, and exposed to diaminobenzidine (DAB) as a substrate (REAL EnVision Detection Systems, K5007, Dako, Denmark). The HRP reacts with the DAB substrate to produce a brown product. The slides were then counter-stained with hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), subsequently dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol, cleared with xylene, and sealed with coverslips. The slides were examined under a light microscope (Olympus BX41, Japan). The number of TyrH-positive neurons in the SNpc region was determined in three sections from each rat. The SNpc was delineated with reference to the rat brain atlas [ 38 ]. The TyrH-positive neurons were identified by dense cytoplasmic immunolabeling. 2.6. Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS software version 22.0 (Armonk, NY, USA). Data that were normally distributed are presented as the mean (standard deviation). The differences among the means of the groups were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). If the ANOVA showed a significant difference, Tukey's post hoc test was performed to determine the pairwise differences of the means. Data that were not normally distributed are expressed as the median (interquartile range [IQR]). The differences among the medians of the groups were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and if significant, the Mann-Whitney  U -test was performed for pairwise comparisons of the medians. Differences were considered statistically significant when  p  < 0.05. 2.3. Experimental Design A total of 75 rats were randomly divided into five groups of 15 animals each: control (N), honey (TH), paraquat (PQ), paraquat + honey (PQ + TH), and paraquat + ubiquinol (PQ + QH). Throughout the experiment, groups N and PQ were treated with distilled water (2.0 mL/kg/day, p.o.), groups TH and PQ + TH were treated with Tualang honey (AgroMas, FAMA, 1.0 g/kg/day, p.o.), and group PQ + QH was treated with ubiquinol (0.2 g/kg/day, p.o.) once per day ( Figure 1 ). The dose of Tualang honey was chosen based on previous studies that showed protective effects against other oxidative stress-related diseases [ 21 ,  31 – 33 ], while the selected ubiquinol dose was based on the studies by Cleren et al. [ 34 ] and Matthews et al. [ 35 ]. Two weeks after the respective treatments, rats were administered intraperitoneal injections of vehicle (0.9% NaCl, 1.0 mL/kg; Group N and TH) or PQ (Sigma-Aldrich, 10 mg/kg; Group PQ, PQ + TH and PQ + QH) once per week for four consecutive weeks. One week after the final injection of saline or PQ, the rats were fasted overnight and sacrificed for biochemical ( n  = 8 per group) or immunohistochemical ( n  = 7 per group) analyses. Body weight changes, renal profile, and liver profile were included as general health assessments.",
