  "abstract": "Transplacental induction of peripheral nervous tumor in the Syrian golden  hamster by N-nitroso-N-ethylurea. A new animal model for von Recklinghausen's  neurofibromatosis.  Nakamura T(1), Hara M, Kasuga T.  Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, Toranomon Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.  Multiple peripheral nervous tumors were induced in 45 of 60 (75.0%) Syrian  golden hamsters by transplacental administration of N-ethyl-N-nitro-sourea.  Moreover, melanomas, pheochromocytomas, and Wilms' tumors developed in six  (10.0%), three (5.0%), and 13 (21.7%) animals, respectively. The histologic,  immunohistochemical, and electron microscopic findings of the peripheral nervous  tumors were similar to those of human neurofibroma, and their growth pattern and  distribution resembled those of human von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis  (VRNF). The occurrence of melanoma, pheochromocytoma, and proliferative foci of  melanin-containing cells in neurofibroma suggests that the targets of ENU in  hamsters are the neural crest-derived cells. With its high incidence of Wilms'  tumor, the hamster with ENU-induced tumors is considered to be a good animal  model for human neurocristopathy, including VRNF.
