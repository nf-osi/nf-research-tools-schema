  "abstract": "Multiple peripheral nervous tumors were induced in 45 of 60 (75.0%) Syrian golden hamsters by transplacental administration of N-ethyl-N-nitro-sourea. Moreover, melanomas, pheochromocytomas, and Wilms' tumors developed in six (10.0%), three (5.0%), and 13 (21.7%) animals, respectively. The histologic, immunohistochemical, and electron microscopic findings of the peripheral nervous tumors were similar to those of human neurofibroma, and their growth pattern and distribution resembled those of human von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis (VRNF). The occurrence of melanoma, pheochromocytoma, and proliferative foci of melanin-containing cells in neurofibroma suggests that the targets of ENU in hamsters are the neural crest-derived cells. With its high incidence of Wilms' tumor, the hamster with ENU-induced tumors is considered to be a good animal model for human neurocristopathy, including VRNF.",
