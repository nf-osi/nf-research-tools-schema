  "abstract": "High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HG-SOC)-often referred to as a \"silent killer\"-is the most lethal gynecological malignancy. The fallopian tube (murine oviduct) and ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) are considered the main candidate tissues of origin of this cancer. However, the relative contribution of each tissue to HG-SOC is not yet clear. Here, we establish organoid-based tumor progression models of HG-SOC from murine oviductal and OSE tissues. We use CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to introduce mutations into genes commonly found mutated in HG-SOC, such as Trp53, Brca1, Nf1 and Pten. Our results support the dual origin hypothesis of HG-SOC, as we demonstrate that both epithelia can give rise to ovarian tumors with high-grade pathology. However, the mutated oviductal organoids expand much faster in vitro and more readily form malignant tumors upon transplantation. Furthermore, in vitro drug testing reveals distinct lineage-dependent sensitivities to the common drugs used to treat HG-SOC in patients.",
  "methods": "Methods Mice Wild-type  C57BL/6  and  B6J.129(B6N)-Gt(ROSA)26Sor  (JAX stock #026175) tm1(CAG-cas9*,-EGFP)Fezh/J  mice strains were used for derivation of wild-type and  36 Cas9/GFP -expressing organoids, respectively. For mutant organoid transplantations, NOD scid gamma ( NSG; NOD.Cg-Prkdc \n scid Il2rg tm1Wjl /SzJ  mice were used. Transplantation experiments were performed after institutional review by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW) with project license of AVD8010020151 and research protocol HI17.1001. Human specimens The patient tumor material was collected from consenting patients undergoing surgical resection at the University Medical Center (UMC) Utrecht Hospital. Tissue collection was approved by the medical ethical committee UMC Utrecht under the biobanking protocol: 14-472 HUB-OVI. All patients participating in this study signed the informed consent forms. Derivation of oviductal organoids For organoid derivation, ovaries and oviducts were dissected from mice and carefully separated under the stereo microscope. Oviducts were first placed into a collagenase solution (1 mg/mL of collagenase from  Clostridium histolyticum , Sigma, C9407) in AdDF+++ (advanced DMEM/F12 supplemented with 1x Glutamax, 10 mM HEPES and penicillin-streptomycin, all from Invitrogen) with ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632, 10 µM). The tissue was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h while shaking followed by vigorous mechanical sharing using a fire-polished glass pipette and centrifugation for 5 min at 450 ×  g . The material was further digested with TrypLE (Gibco, Cat. 12605-010) for 5 min at 37 °C, washed several times with ice-cold AdDF+++ and embedded in Basement Membrane Extract (Cultrex ®  BME RGF type 2, Amsbio, Cat. 3533-005-02). The cell-BME suspension was plated on a pre-warmed suspension culture plate (Greiner) and allowed to solidify at 37 °C for 30 min before addition of medium. The basal culture medium for oviductal organoids includes 20% R-spondin conditioned medium (made in-house), 1% Noggin conditioned medium (U Protein Express), 1x B27 (Gibco), 1.25 mM n-Acetylcystein (Sigma), 50 ng/ml EGF (Peprotech), and 500 nM A83-01 (Tocris). WNT inhibitor IWP2 (3 μM, Stemgent) was used for showing WNT-independency of oviductal organoids. For induction of ciliogenesis, DAPT (10 µM, Tocris) was added to the WNT-deprived culture medium and analysis was performed 2 weeks after the start of the treatment. The organoids could be reproducibly derived from over four independent isolations. Derivation of OSE organoids Ovaries were subjected to more gentle treatment with pronase solution (1 mg/ml of Pronase E, Sigma) in AdDF+++ with ROCK inhibitor at 37 °C for 30 min while shaking. This method allows removal of OSE cells from the surface of the ovaries while leaving rest of the tissue intact. After digestion the ovaries were gently sheared a few hundred times by using an adjusted 1-ml pipette tip (tip hole needs to be cut large enough for the ovaries to enter without breaking them) to detach the loosened OSE sheets from the surface of the ovaries. Next, the supernatant containing epithelial fragments was transferred to another tube, pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 450 ×  g  and further digested with TrypLE for 5 min at 37 °C. After several washes with ice-cold AdDF+++, the cells were embedded in BME and plated on pre-warmed culture plates as described above. The minimal required medium for OSE organoids contains all the factors present in the oviductal organoid medium (see above), but is additionally supplemented with 50% conditioned WNT3a (made in-house) and 0.1 μM β-Estradiol (Sigma). Addition of FGF2 during initial passages can improve the organoid outgrowth. WNT inhibitor IWP2 was used for demonstrating WNT-dependency of OSE organoids. For ciliogenesis assay, cultures were grown in the presence of DAPT for 2 weeks until analysis. The organoids could be reproducibly derived from over four independent isolations. Organoid growth assay Organoids were removed from BME and trypsinized with TrypLE. Cells were washed in medium and passed through a 40 μm cell strainer to ensure a single-cell suspension. Cells were diluted in trypan blue to exclude dead cells and counted using a haemocytometer. One-thousand cells were plated with 5-μl BME drops into 48-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, 677102) and overlaid with 250-μl medium. Images of the organoids were taken every day for a week, organoid sizes were measured (12 organoids per line) using ImageJ software (version 1.51j8). Subsequently, from the resulting data, the growth curves were constructed in Microsoft Excel 2019. Experiment was repeated twice. Flow cytometry To assess the apoptosis in organoids, the cells were stained and analyzed by flow cytometry. Organoids were collected and dissociated into single-cell suspension via trypsinization. The cells were stained with Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit (88-8007-72, eBioscience) according to the manufacturer′s instructions. A BD FACSCanto II system was used to analyze the samples. The assay was performed twice. The gating strategy is provided in the Supplementary Fig.  5 . Immunohistochemistry Tissues were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C followed by dehydration and paraffin embedding. To prepare organoids for histological stainings, intact BME drops containing organoids were collected from the culture plates and incubated in Cell Recovery Solution (Corning, Cat. 354253) on ice for 30 min, occasionally inverting the tube, to dissolve BME. Organoids were then allowed to settle to the bottom of the tube by free gravitation, supernatant removed and the material fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 1 h. After fixation, the organoids were washed in PBS, and embedded into paraffin blocks. Sections were cut and hydrated before staining. Sections were subjected to H&E staining or immunohistochemistry by using antibodies listed in the Table  2 . The images were acquired on Leica DM4000 microscope and processed using Leica LAS X software. Table 2 Antibody specifications.

About 16 h later, organoids were harvested and fixed in 4% formalin overnight at 4 °C. Prior to the whole-mount staining, the fixed organoids were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton-X (Sigma), 2% donkey serum (BioRad) in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C and blocked with 0.1% Tween-20 (Sigma) and 2% donkey serum in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Subsequently, organoids were stained with mouse anti-γH2A.X primary antibody (1:500, Millipore, clone JBW301) overnight at 4 °C, followed by four washes with PBS and incubation with secondary goat anti-mouse AF-647 antibody (1:250, Thermo Fisher, catalog number A-21235) for 2 h at room temperature in the dark and washed again with PBS. DAPI was used to counterstain nuclei. Organoids were mounted and imaged on an SP8 confocal microscope (Leica). Fluorescent microscopic images of γH2A.X were quantified as follows: Based on the staining, the nuclei were classified as γH2A.X-positive or -negative. The fraction of positively stained nuclei over all nuclei is displayed as one datapoint per organoid. At least 10 organoids were quantified per line over two independent experiments. Karyotyping About 2–3 days after splitting of the organoids, the cultures were treated with 0.1 μg/mL colcemid (Gibco, Cat. 15210-040) added to the culture media for 6 h. Organoids were then collected and dissociated into single cells using TrypLE. Single cells were swollen by addition of pre-warmed 75 mM KCl and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Cells were fixed by slow drop-wise addition of ice-cold methanol:acetic acid (3:1) while gently tapping the cell suspension. Slides were mounted with DAPI-containing Vectashield, imaged on a DM6000 Leica microscope with a ×100 objective, and quantified by manual chromosome counting. At least 15 spreads per clone were analyzed. Organoid transfection and genotyping For generating mutant organoid lines for selected genes ( Trp53 ,  Brca1 ,  Nf1 , and  Pten ), the CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing was used. The single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were designed by using the CRISPR Design tool (Zhang Lab, MIT). For all the genes two separate sgRNAs were designed, and, based on the in vitro screening assay, the better performing sgRNA was chosen for each gene for the following organoid experiments. The sequences of the final sgRNAs are shown in the Table  3 . Table 3 Sequences targeted by designed sgRNAs. Gene Exon (F—forward, R—reverse) Targeted sequence Trp53 Exon 3, F AAGTCACAGCACATGACGG Brca1 Exon 6, F GCGTCGATCATCCAGAGCGT Nf1 Exon 8, F CCAGGACATCTCCAAGGATG Pten Exon 6, R ATATACATAGCGCCTCTGAC For organoid transfection experiments about 640 μl of BME with  Cas9 -expressing oviductal or OSE organoids were collected from the plate (about 4/12-wells) and dissociated into single cells using TrypLE, washed with AdDF++ (without antibiotics), resuspended in high-density in 500 μl of growth medium with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor (without antibiotics) and transferred to a well on a 24-well culture plate. The sgRNA transfection was performed by using the Stemfect RNA Transfection Kit (Stemgent) according to the manufacturer′s instructions. Briefly, 12.5 μl of transfection buffer was mixed together with 1 μl of transfection reagent and incubated at room temperature for 10 min followed by addition of the sgRNA mixture containing 12.5 μl of transfection buffer and 5 μg of appropriate sgRNAs. The total volume of transfection mixture (ca 25 μl) was incubated at room temperature for 15 min before adding it to the cell suspension and the plate was placed in a humidified incubator at 37 °C for 4–5 h. After incubation, cells were collected and plated according to the standard protocol and covered with full medium containing 10 μM ROCK inhibitor. Around 2–3 days post transfection, the medium was exchanged with the growth medium containing 10 µM Nutlin-3a (Cayman Chemical) to select for p53 mutant organoids. Within two weeks clonal organoid outgrowth could be readily observed, the organoids were picked, expanded and screened for mutations in targeted genes. If the triple mutants were not obtained after the first round of transfection, an additional transfection was performed. For genotyping, genomic DNA was isolated using DirectPCR lysis reagent (Viagen). Primers for the PCR amplification using GoTaq Flexi DNA polymerase (Promega) were as follows: Trp53_for, 5′-CAGGAAGCCAAAGGGTGAAGA-3′, Trp53_rev, 5′-CCCATCTACAGTCCCCCTTG-3′; Brca1_for, 5′-TGGAGTGCAAGTGAAAGCCT-3′, Brca1_rev, 5′-ACCGACAATTAAGATGGAGTGCT-3′; Nf1_for, 5′- CCCGGGAAACTATCAGCCTT-3′, Nf1_rev, 5′-CTGTTTGACCTAGCATGGACA-3′; Pten_for, 5′- TGCAGTACAGAGACCATTGACT-3′, Pten_rev, 5′-CGACACACAGACAGCTAAGAA-3′. Products were cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector system I (Promega) and subsequently Sanger sequenced by Macrogen Europe (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) using universal T7 sequencing primer. Western blot Organoids were treated with 10 µM Nutlin-3a to activate p53 pathway 24 h prior to the harvesting. Samples were lysed using RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% Na-Deoxycholate, 1% NP-40) containing Complete protease inhibitors (Roche). Protein content was quantified using standard Bradford assay (BioRad) and equal amounts of protein (a′ 20 µg) were run on gradient polyacrylamide gel (4–15%; BioRad) and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked and probed with antibodies directed against p53 (sc-6243, 1:250, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and GAPDH (LN2100751, 1:1000, Labned). Uncropped versions of the western blots are provided in the Supplementary Fig.  6 . The results were confirmed twice. RNA isolation, cDNA preparation, and qRT-PCR For qPCR analysis, RNA was isolated from organoids and tissues using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Cat. 74104) following the manufacturer′s instructions including DNaseI treatment. For qPCR, RNA was reverse transcribed from 500 ng of total RNA using GoScript and random primer (both Promega). qPCR was performed with three biological replicates in duplicates using the indicated primers, SYBR Green Mixture (BioRad) and BioRad CFX Manager Version 3.1. Gene expression was quantified using the delta-delta-Ct method and normalized against β-Actin housekeeping gene. qPCR primers used in this study were as follows: β-Actin_for, 5′-GTCGAGTCGCGTCCACC-3′, β-Actin_rev, 5′-GTCATCCATGGCGAACTGGT-3′; Pax8_for, 5′-GATGCCTCACAACTCGATCA-3′, Pax8_rev, 5′-AAGGATCTTGCTTACACAGC-3′; Foxj1_for, 5′-ACCAAGATCACTCTGTCGG-3′, Foxj1_rev, 5′-GATGGAATTCTGCCAGGTG-3′; Dnah5_for, 5′-ATGGACTGACTTCTCGCCTC-3′, Dnah5_rev, 5′-GTCGTTGCGTCAGAACTCG-3′; Trp73_for, 5′-GGGAGCAACAGGCTCTGAAT-3′; Trp73_rev, 5′-GCTCTGCTTGAATGCACGTT-3′. Library preparation and RNA-seq analysis For RNA-seq analysis, RNA was isolated from the organoids and tissues using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions or standard Tryzol extraction protocol, respectively. In both cases DNaseI treatment was included. In vitro transcription was performed using 1–5 ng cDNA as template and RNA was reverse transcribed into a sequencing library. After preparation, the quality and quantity of the libraries were checked with Bioanalyzer2100 DNA High Sensitivity chips (Cat. 5067-4626) and Qubit (Qubit ®  dsDNA HS Assay Kit, Cat. Q32854); all samples had a RIN value of 10. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina NextSeq500 by using 75-bp paired-end sequencing. Paired-end reads from Illumina sequencing were aligned to the mouse genome (GRCm38 assembly) with BWA . The raw data file consists of a total number of reads for each gene (without UMI correction) that were uniquely mapped to the transcriptome (with a mapping quality above 60), and that had the appropriate transcription direction. DESeq2 (v1.18.0) package was used to normalize count data and for differential gene expression analysis in program R (R version 3.5.1, Bioconductor version 3.8 (BiocManager 1.30.4)). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed using GSEA software v3.0 beta2. 55 In vitro drug screen Two days prior to the start of the assay, organoids were disrupted into single cells using TrypLE and filtered using a 70-μm nylon cell strainer (BD Falcon). The cells were subsequently counted, and resuspended in 5% BME/growth medium (25,000 cells/mL) prior plating in 40 μl volume (Multi-drop Combi Reagent Dispenser, Thermo Scientific, catalog no. 5840300) in 384-well plates (Corning, catalog no. 4588). The drugs were added 2 days after plating the cells using the Tecan D300e Digital Dispenser (Tecan). Nutlin-3a (Cayman Chemical, catalog no. 10004372), niraparib (Selleckchem, catalog no. S2741), and paclitaxel (Sigma, catalog no. T7402) were dissolved in DMSO. Cisplatin (Sigma, catalog no. C2210000) was dissolved in PBS containing 0.3% Tween-20, which was required to dispense the drug using the HP printer. All wells were normalized for the solvent used. DMSO percentage never exceeded 1% and PBS/Tween-20 percentage never exceeded 2%. Drug exposure was performed in quadruplicates for each concentration shown. Five days (120 h) after the addition of the drugs, ATP levels were measured using the CellTiter-Glo 3-D Reagent (Promega, catalog no. G9681) according to the manufacturer′s instructions, and luminescence was measured using a Spark multimode microplate reader (Tecan). Results were normalized to vehicle (100%) and baseline control (Staurosporine 1 μmol/L; 0%). Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software (version 7.04) and lines were fitted using the option “log(inhibitor) vs normalized response–variable slope”. Drug screening results were confirmed in quadruplicates ( n  = 4) over two independent experiments. In vivo transplantation assays Before transplantations, wild-type or mutant oviductal and OSE organoids were harvested and broken into smaller injectable fragments via mechanical shearing with a fire-polished glass pipette. Cells were then resuspended in 10% BME in PBS and ~100,000 cells were injected per location. Both subcutaneous and orthotopic injections were performed. For each mutation combination, two separate clones were transplanted. At least two mice were used for orthotopic and one mouse for subcutaneous transplantations per clone. Ear clipping was used for animal recognition. The mice were sacrificed up to 4 months (ca 120 days) after injections. Tumor volumes were measured and estimated by formula: Tumor volume = (length × width 2 )/2, where length represents the largest tumor diameter and width the perpendicular tumor diameter. Tumor volume was measured on all the OSE-derived tumors and randomly selected oviductal-derived tumors. All the tumors were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis. KI67- and cleaved Caspase-3-positive cells were quantified using ImageJ software. From  n  = 4 tumors also organoids were derived. Establishment of tumor-derived organoids A small piece of a tumor tissue was dissected, mechanically dissociated and cells were extracted by collagenase treatment as described in the Methods above (same protocol as under Derivation of oviductal organoids). Cultures were grown under Nutlin-3a selection to specifically promote the outgrowth of the tumor cells and inhibit the growth of host cells.
