  "introduction": "1 INTRODUCTION Colorectal cancer (CRC) is rare in children, with most diagnoses occurring in individuals over the age of 50 years. Currently recognized CRC predisposition syndromes in younger individuals include constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (CMMRD), Lynch syndrome, and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). \n \n 1 \n CMMRD is a rare childhood hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome characterized by a biallelic mutation in one of four DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes,  MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 , or  PMS2 . The general prevalence of pathogenic variants of these genes is approximately 0.051% for  MLH1 , 0.035% for  MSH2 , 0.132% for  MSH6 , and 0.140% for  PMS2 . \n  CMMRD increases the risk for childhood‐onset CRC, gliomas, glioblastomas, non‐Hodgkin lymphoma, and endometrial and urinary tract cancers. In contrast, monoallelic mutations in these same four DNA MMR genes result in Lynch syndrome, associated with adult‐onset colorectal, endometrial, gastric, ovarian, pancreatic, urinary tract, prostate, biliary tract, small intestinal, brain, and sebaceous gland cancers. 2 \n \n ,  3 \n \n  Mutations in other genes involved in DNA repair can also increase cancer risk. For instance, monoallelic mutations of the  4 \n MUTYH  gene confer a slightly elevated lifetime risk for colorectal, duodenal, ovarian, bladder, and endocrine cancers. \n \n 5 \n CMMRD has been documented in few cases to be linked with the development of various cancers including colon cancer in young adult patients. \n  Previous literature describes cases of children with parents diagnosed with CMMRD syndrome, particularly those with germline biallelic  6 \n MSH6  mutations, presenting with café‐au‐lait macules and a history of multiple family cancers. \n  However, reported cases of CRC development in children with multiple inherited cancer‐related genes are not well‐represented in current literature. This report describes the case of a boy with CMMRD, a monoallelic  7 \n MUTYH  mutation, and biparental history of Lynch syndrome who developed lymphoma and early‐onset CRC.",

  "discussion": "3 DISCUSSION This case highlights the clinical overlap between CMMRD and NF1, as both can involve mutations to the  NF1  gene. CMMRD patients may develop somatic  NF1  mutations due to defective mismatch repair, while classical NF1 involves germline mutations affecting all cells. This genetic overlap can lead to shared features such as café‐au‐lait macules and Lisch nodules, sometimes causing CMMRD to be misdiagnosed as NF1. Thus, in patients presenting with café‐au‐lait macules, CMMRD should remain on the differential, especially in patients with familial history of cancer syndromes. The gold standard for a definitive diagnosis of CMMRD requires genetic testing, typically through a blood sample, to identify a germline biallelic mutation in one of the four MMR genes. This is combined with clinical features such as early‐onset cancers (e.g. brain tumors, hematological malignancies, and CRCs) often in young individuals, as well as nonmalignant signs like café‐au‐lait spots or a family history of similar cancers. \n  Given the patient's biparental history of Lynch syndrome and the mother's diagnosis of endometrial adenocarcinoma, the risk of inheriting two mutated DNA mismatch repair alleles—and developing CMMRD—should have been considered earlier. Despite the eventual diagnosis of CMMRD, the patient was not referred to gastroenterology until hematochezia occurred. A higher index of suspicion and broader criteria for early genetic testing and surveillance in patients presenting with café‐au‐lait macules, coupled with a personal history of CMMRD‐related malignancies, could have led to timely intervention before cancer signs emerged. While genetic testing is not routinely performed for patients with café‐au‐lait macules alone, their presence, alongside a history of lymphoma and parental Lynch syndrome diagnoses, represented a missed opportunity for earlier diagnosis and intervention before the patient's first colon cancer. This case underscores the importance of effectively communicating genetic test results with care teams to ensure timely cancer surveillance in predisposition syndromes. Additionally, sharing a diagnosis with family members allows relatives to be assessed for related syndromes and monitored appropriately. In cases of CMMRD, siblings should undergo genetic testing and ongoing evaluation for features of the condition. 8 \n Although CRCs associated with CMMRD are diagnosed at an average age of 16 years, it is important to recognize that they may occur earlier; cases requiring more aggressive intervention at an early stage must not be overlooked due to low suspicion. \n  Although a colonoscopy was performed 6 months before diagnosis of CRC, a higher index of suspicion for potential malignancy might have allowed for complete polypectomy before progression to adenocarcinoma. In this case, while the largest polyps found were removed at each endoscopy, there was potentially room for removal of more polyps that could have fit the criteria. This certainly raises the question of whether a more extensive polypectomy could have been performed and served beneficial. Due to the low incidence of CRC in children, pediatric endoscopic training is not highly focused on cancer surveillance measures. This case emphasizes that training should include heightened awareness of considering rare hereditary colon cancer syndromes in differential diagnoses as well as in determining aggressiveness of treatment. Training should also emphasize the importance of thoroughly and individually assessing each polyp for fitting the criteria for polypectomy, as overlooking even one could have drastic consequences. Lower thresholds for complete polypectomies should be considered in cases of aggressive CRC predisposition syndromes such as CMMRD. 9 \n From a genetic counseling perspective, this case illustrates how broader testing can complicate risk analysis due to additional findings, such as an  MUTYH  mutation. Given the rarity of CMMRD, limited data exists on how multiple predispositions interact and whether the risks are independent, additive, or compounding. In this case, an additive effect seems plausible, given the younger‐than‐average onset of CMMRD‐related CRC and rapid progression from tubular adenoma to adenocarcinoma within 6 months. This could be due to an expedited adenoma‐to‐carcinoma sequence and/or microsatellite instability linked to CMMRD. \n  Nonetheless, with few documented cases, the exact effects of concurrent MMR and  10 \n MUTYH  mutations on clinical outcomes remain unclear. Finally, the repeated mention of polyposis syndrome and FAP in the medical record highlights the need for increased awareness of CMMRD in clinical practice. It is crucial to differentiate CMMRD from other syndromes with overlapping features, such as FAP, juvenile polyposis, Turcot syndrome, Li‐Fraumeni syndrome, and Peutz‐Jeghers syndrome, to ensure proper diagnosis and management. \n  Emphasizing CMMRD in the differential diagnosis of polyposis syndromes could promote earlier detection and more personalized management, improving outcomes. 11 \n In summary, this case underscores the importance of a broader approach to genetic testing in individuals presenting with signs consistent with CMMRD, given the significant overlap with other genetic conditions. Additionally, recognizing the potential for CRC in children with two parents with Lynch syndrome can promote earlier detection and intervention and better outcomes. Understanding additional mutations in patients with CMMRD is crucial for optimizing diagnosis and management.",
