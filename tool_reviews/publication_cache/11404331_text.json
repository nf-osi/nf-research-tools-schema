  "abstract": "A systematic screen for dominant second-site modifiers of Merlin/NF2 phenotypes  reveals an interaction with blistered/DSRF and scribbler.  LaJeunesse DR(1), McCartney BM, Fehon RG.  Author information: (1)Developmental, Cell and Molecular Biology Group, Department of Biology, Duke  University, Durham, North Carolina 27708-1000, USA.  Merlin, the Drosophila homologue of the human tumor suppressor gene  Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2), is required for the regulation of cell proliferation  and differentiation. To better understand the cellular functions of the NF2 gene  product, Merlin, recent work has concentrated on identifying proteins with which  it interacts either physically or functionally. In this article, we describe  genetic screens designed to isolate second-site modifiers of Merlin phenotypes  from which we have identified five multiallelic complementation groups that  modify both loss-of-function and dominant-negative Merlin phenotypes. Three of  these groups, Group IIa/scribbler (also known as brakeless), Group  IIc/blistered, and Group IId/net, are known genes, while two appear to be novel.  In addition, two genes, Group IIa/scribbler and Group IIc/blistered, alter  Merlin subcellular localization in epithelial and neuronal tissues, suggesting  that they regulate Merlin trafficking or function. Furthermore, we show that  mutations in scribbler and blistered display second-site noncomplementation with  one another. These results suggest that Merlin, blistered, and scribbler  function together in a common pathway to regulate Drosophila wing epithelial  development.
