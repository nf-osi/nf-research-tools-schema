  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Meningiomas are tumors originating from the membranous layers surrounding the central nervous system, and are generally regarded as \"benign\" tumors of the brain. Malignant meningiomas are rare and are typically associated with a higher risk of local tumor recurrence and a poorer prognosis (median survival time <2 years). Previous genome-wide association studies and exome sequencing studies have identified genes that play a role in susceptibility to meningiomas, but these studies did not focus specifically on malignant tumors. METHODS: We performed exome sequencing on five malignant meningiomas on the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform using Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon kits. We used wANNOVAR web server to annotate and prioritize variants, identified candidate genes with recurrent mutations, and validated selected mutations by Sanger sequencing. We next designed custom NimbleGen targeted region arrays on five candidate genes, and sequenced four additional malignant meningiomas. RESULTS: From exome sequencing data, we identified several frequently mutated genes including NF2, MN1, ARID1B, SEMA4D, and MUC2, with private mutations in tumors. We sequenced these genes in four additional samples and identified potential driver mutations in NF2 (neurofibromatosis type 2) and MN1 (meningioma 1). CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that mutations in NF2 may play a role in progression of meningiomas, and nominated MN1 as a candidate gene for malignant transformation of meningiomas. Our sample size is limited by the extreme rarity of malignant meningiomas, but our study represents one of the first sequencing studies focusing on the malignant subtype.",

We used wANNOVAR web server to annotate and prioritize variants, identified candidate genes with recurrent mutations, and validated selected mutations by Sanger sequencing. We next designed custom NimbleGen targeted region arrays on five candidate genes, and sequenced four additional malignant meningiomas. Materials and Methods Patient samples After evaluating detailed history of pathology, availability of tissue specimens, and availability of high-quality DNAs, our study included nine patients with malignant meningiomas, including four males and five females. All enrolled patients in the registry came from Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center with written informed consents. Demographic and baseline clinical characteristics of these patients were examined manually and were shown in  Table 1 . Library preparation DNA samples were extracted from the tumor FFPE slides from these patients using QIAamp DNA FFPE kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the standard protocol. Samples with main DNA fragment larger than 250 bp were chosen for constructing exome sequencing library. For each sample, 2 \u03bcg purified genomic DNA was extracted and randomly fragmented using Covaris E210 to generate DNA fragments around 200 to 300 bp and then validated using 2% agarose gel. Next, we purified DNA fragments using AMpure XP beads (Beckman, Brea, CA, USA). The fragmented DNA was treated with T4 polynucleotide kinase, T4 DNA polymerase, and Klenow fragment with dNTPs to create phosphorylated blunt termini. Then the end-repaired DNA fragments were incubated with Klenow fragment exo- and dATP to create 3\u2032 over-hangs and were ligated to synthetic general adaptors. Adaptor ligated-DNA fragments were amplified by ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (LM-PCR) and purified using AMpure XP beads. PCR products from Patients 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were hybridized to the Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon array ( http://www.genomics.agilent.com/en/SureSelect-DNA-RNA/SureSelect-Human-All-Exon-Kits/?cid=AG-PT-177&tabId=AG-PR-1204 ) to prepare for exome sequencing of these 5 patients. As for the other 4 patients, we applied purified PCR product to NimbleGen targeted region array (see below) for enrichment to prepare for targeted region sequencing. Both non-captured and captured LM-PCR products were subjected to quantitative PCR to estimate the magnitude of enrichment. At last, the captured DNA was amplified to create enough fragments for sequencing. Exome sequencing Each captured library by Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon array was loaded on Hiseq2000 platform for sequencing. High-throughput sequencing was performed and the raw image files were processed by Illumina base calling software 1.7 for base calling with default parameters and the sequences of each library are generated as 90 bp paired-end reads. Adequate depth and coverage was achieved for each sample and therefore data from all five samples were used for further analysis. Candidate region sequencing As for candidate region sequencing of the five candidate genes, we designed the candidate region array using NimbleGen Design ( http://www.nimblegen.com/products/nimbledesign/index.html ), with following parameters: Preferred Close Matches-3, Maximum Close Matches-4, and final Target Bases Covered being 90.9%. We obtained the following candidate region: 29985287-30108845 and 28136281-28205468 for chromosome 22, 157034136-157596839 for chromosome 6, 91957869-92112446 for chromosome 9, and 1070443-1108847 for chromosome 11. Next, similar as before, we subjected each library captured by NimbleGen targeted region arrays to Hiseq2000 platform for sequencing. High-throughput sequencing was performed and the raw image files were processed by Illumina base calling software 1.7 for base calling with default parameters and the sequences of each library are generated as 90 bp paired-end reads. Adequate depth and coverage was achieved for each sample and therefore data from all four samples were used for further analysis. Variant calling We used SeqMule ( http://seqmule.usc.edu/ ) pipeline as our primary variant calling pipeline. In SeqMule pipeline, BWA ( Li and Durbin, 2009 ) was used for sequence alignment and GATK ( McKenna  ) and SAMtools ( et al. , 2010 Li  ) were used to generate variant calls and to identify consensus calls for analysis. For further comparison between various variant-calling tools, such as SOAPsnp/SOAPindel, VarScan2 ( et al. , 2009 Koboldt  ), and SAMtools, we used variants from five candidate genes from five exome-sequenced patients as benchmarking data and generated variants from SOAPsnp/SOAPindel, VarScan2, GATK and SAMtools, respectively. et al. , 2012 On the other hand, we decided to use VarScan2 as our primary variant calling tools for targeted region sequencing data analysis given sufficient sequencing depth. Our goal is to obtain the most somatic and germline variants calling from these cancer tissues because we are not only interested in the overlapped variants from exome sequencing but also in additional variants that occurred in these genes. Therefore, for this deeply sequenced data on which most pipelines can generate reliable variant calls, we chose VarScan2 as it is widely used in cancer mutation identification and that it is more sensitive for somatic mutations. Mutation annotation We used wANNOVAR web server at University of Southern California ( http://wannovar.usc.edu/ ) to annotate all the mutations ( Chang and Wang, 2012 ;  Wang  ). wANNOVAR server provides an easy-to-use interface to help researchers filter down variants, and judge the deleteriousness of variants using multiple sources of information, such as SIFT ( et al. , 2010 Kumar  ), PolyPhen-2 ( et al. , 2009 Adzhubei  ), and LRT ( et al. , 2010 Chun and Fay, 2009 ) scores. Given the lack of paired normal tissues, we applied two filtering processes to sift for potential novel somatic mutations occurred in our patients. First, to filter for rare novel mutations and thus can potentially be somatic mutations, we discarded all mutations with Minor Allele Frequency (MAF) strictly greater than 0.001 from 1000 Genomes Project and NHLBI-ESP data on 6,500 exomes, and required the remaining mutations to be absent in dbSNP Build 138 and in 46 unrelated individuals from Complete Genomics, using wANNOVAR with corresponding filtering options. Second, given that our patients were all from Chinese population, which was less represented in these aforementioned databases, to filter for novel somatic mutations specific to Chinese population, we also obtained mutations from a recently published exome-sequencing project on around 1,000 Chinese people and checked the existence and allele frequencies of all remaining mutations in the five frequently mutated genes and in TRAF7. Sanger validation All candidate point mutations identified from exome sequencing were chosen for Sanger validation. Genomic sequences around each candidate mutations were obtained from NCBI. Twelve pairs of primers were designed using primer 3 (v. 0.4.0) ( http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/ ). Next, we subjected DNA samples of all five patients to PCR using these 12 pairs of primers to validate all candidate mutations. The PCR mixture contained 5 \u03bcl of 10X AccuPrime\u2122 PCR Buffer, 0.3 \u03bcl of AccuPrime\u2122 Taq High Fidelit, 2 \u03bcl of 10 \u03bcM forward primer, 2 \u03bcl of 10 \u03bcM reverse primer, and 10 ng of template DNA, resulting in final volume of 50 \u03bcl. All PCR were performed under following conditions: 2 minutes at 94\u00b0C; 20 cycles of 20 seconds at 94\u00b0C and 30 seconds at 60\u00b0C (\u22120.5\u00b0C each cycle) and 1 minute at 70\u00b0C; 20 cycles of 20 seconds at 94\u00b0C and 30 seconds at 50\u00b0C and 1 minute at 70\u00b0C; and 7 minutes at 70\u00b0C. After amplification of DNA sequence, we performed Sanger Sequencing of all 5 samples. The sequencing traces were manually visualized in Codon Code Aligner software ( http://www.codoncode.com/aligner/ ) to confirm the presence of candidate mutations.",

  "introduction": "Introduction Meningiomas are the most common tumors arising from the meninges, the membranous layers surrounding brain and spinal cord, accounting for 34.7% of all Central Nervous System (CNS) tumors with an annual incidence rate of 60 per million individuals ( Whittle  ). Meningiomas are generally benign. Indeed, 80% of meningiomas are classified as benign (grade I), whereas 15%-20% are classified as atypical (grade II), and only 1-3% are malignant (grade III) according to World Health Organization (WHO) histological grading criteria ( et al. , 2004 Louis  ;  et al. , 2007 Ryken and Chamberlain, 2011 ). Rare as they are, malignant meningiomas constitute a rather poor prognosis subtype, with recurrence rate up to 50-80% after surgical resection and with median survival of 1.5 years ( Perry  ). Therefore, to provide important insights into diagnosis and individualized treatment strategies for this aggressive tumor subtype, further understanding of its genetic basis is needed. et al. , 1999 The genetics of meningiomas has been studied less extensively, compared to other more prevalent/complex cancers. Over the past few decades, some genetic studies such as cytogenetic studies, linkage studies, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have suggested candidate genes and pathways that may play a role in meningioma progression ( Pham  ). For example, tumor suppressor genes, such as  et al. , 2011 NF2, DAL-1, CDKN2A, CDKN2B , and various tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases ( TIMPs ), have been reported to be associated with tumor progression of meningiomas ( Fernandez  ;  et al. , 1999 Ferner, 2007 ;  Ferrara  ;  et al. , 2003 Gutmann  ;  et al. , 2000 Jagannathan  ). Oncogenes such as  et al. , 2008 C-sis, c-myc, c-fos, Ha-ras, c-mos, TP73, bcl-2 , and  STAT3  have been noted to have a relatively high incidence of somatic mutations in meningiomas ( Abramovich and Prayson, 2000 ;  Carstens  ;  et al. , 1988 Detta  ;  et al. , 1993 Kazumoto  ). To date, perhaps the most significant genetic finding on somatic mutations was still the disruption of tumor suppressor  et al. , 1990 NF2  on chromosome 22q12, which was confirmed to be a critical initiating event in the formation of approximately half of all meningiomas ( Choy  ;  et al. , 2011 Pham  ). Fewer studies have been conducted on germline mutations; however, a GWAS study of 859 meningioma patients and 704 controls identified  et al. , 2011 MLLT10  gene in a susceptibility locus at 10p12.31, with strong significance but moderate effect size (P=1.88\u00d710 \u221214 , OR=1.46) ( Dobbins  ). et al. , 2011 Recently, the advent of next-generation sequencing techniques made it possible to identify candidate genes and pathways in a larger scale, spurring the discovery of a spectrum of candidate genes, such as  SUFU  ( Aavikko  ),  et al. , 2012 SMO  ( Brastianos  ;  et al. , 2013 Clark  ), and  et al. , 2013 TRAF7  ( Reuss  ). However, such studies focused on analyzing benign meningiomas, which are much easier to sample due to its higher prevalence, while to a lesser extent exploring the most deadly malignant subtype that constitutes a major therapeutic challenge. For example, none malignant tumor was sequenced among 300 meningiomas used in a recent large-scale genomic study ( et al. , 2013 Clark  ). Another recent study did not include any malignant meningiomas for whole genome/exome sequencing in the discovery set, but included 3 malignant meningiomas for candidate gene sequencing in the extrapolation set ( et al. , 2013 Brastianos  ). Therefore, the crucial genetic alterations involved in malignant transformation still remained largely unknown. et al. , 2013 To investigate the molecular genetics of malignant meningiomas, we have initiated a series of pilot studies that aimed at extensively identifying distinctive traits of malignant meningiomas from genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptome aspects. For example, on genomic level, a gene fusion event induced by local chromosomal inversion was recently pinpointed using high-throughput RNA-Seq technology ( Gao  ). On epigenomic level, genes with hypermethylated CpG islands in malignant meningiomas (such as  et al. , 2013a HOXA6  and  HOXA9 ) were found to coincide with the binding sites of polycomb repressive complexes (PRC) in early developmental stages, suggesting differentially methylated genes as potential diagnostic biomarkers or candidate causal genes for malignant transformation ( Gao  ). On transcriptome level, 23 coexpression modules including a distinctive repression of meningioma tumor suppressor  et al. , 2013b MN1  were established from the weighted gene coexpression network analysis on transcriptome copy number alterations of malignant meningiomas ( Chang  ). Such studies paved the way for further investigation of malignant meningiomas, and a higher resolution of genomic scan in malignant meningiomas is entailed to complete the catalog of genetic mutations for this aggressive tumor subtype. et al. , 2013 In the current study, we explored the genomic changes in malignant meningiomas using Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) to complement previous studies on benign ones. On five malignant meningiomas that we sequenced, we identified five genes ( NF2 ,  MN1, ARID1B, SEMA4D , and  MUC2 ) that carry novel protein-altering variations and may be associated with progression of meningiomas. We also validated the candidate genes on an additional cohort of patients using targeted region sequencing on these five genes, further nominating  NF2  and  MN1  as candidate genes associated with malignant meningiomas. Our study represents the first such study focusing on malignant meningiomas, and provides genetic findings for future validation on this rare and deadly cancer.",
  "results": "Results Whole-exome sequencing identifies candidate genes To survey the mutational landscape of malignant meningiomas, we performed whole-exome sequencing on five meningiomas on the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform using Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon kits. After removing low-quality reads, we obtained on average 45 million paired-end 90 bp reads per sample. Alignment statistics showed mean depth coverage of 54X, and 93.4% of bases were covered by at least 10X. In total, these five samples carried ~62,000 unique variants as our candidate variants for functional annotation and analysis. In order to narrow the list of potential disease-predisposing variants and genes, we applied the \u2018variants reduction\u2019 pipeline implemented in the wANNOVAR server and identified a small subset of candidate variants and genes that are more likely to be deleterious ( Chang and Wang, 2012 ). We focused on the list of non-synonymous SNVs, splice variants, and indels in exonic regions, given that they might be more interpretable and perhaps more likely to be disease associated. From this pipeline, we prioritized on average 170 novel protein-altering variants per sample ( Table 2 ,  Figure 1 ). Among all 799 genes with these novel mutations, 39 of them were shared by at least two patients and 4 of them were shared by at least three patients. In order to further narrow down the list of candidate genes, we used DAVID web server and examined the function of all 799 genes ( Huang da  ). Manual examination of brain cancer-related keywords resulted in a ranked list of cancer genes, including  et al. , 2009 NF2, MN1 ,  ARID1B, SEMA4D,  and  MUC2 . Sanger sequencing validated the presence of all point mutations ( Figure 2 ). Due to the very small sample size, we decided to zoom into these five candidate genes and assess their likelihood of being associated with malignant meningiomas. Among these five candidate genes,  NF2  encodes a membrane-cytoskeleton scaffolding protein, predominantly found in nervous tissue and is mainly located in adherens junctions. Previous studies showed that  NF2  was disrupted in approximately half of all meningiomas ( Choy  ). Moreover, in Cancer Gene Census ( et al. , 2011 Futreal  ), both germline mutations and somatic mutations in  et al. , 2004 NF2  are reported to be associated with meningiomas.  MN1  gene was originally cloned from the breakpoint of t(4;22)(p16;q11) in human meningioma and was suspected to contribute to its pathogenesis ( Lekanne Deprez  ). Moreover, as mentioned above, the distinctive repression of  et al. , 1995 MN1  was established in our pilot studies from analysis on transcriptome copy number alterations of malignant meningiomas ( Chang  ).  et al. , 2013 MUC2  encodes a transcription coregulator that plays an important role in diagnostic and prognostic prediction and in carcinogenesis and tumor invasion. It has been tested for association with the recurrence and outcome of pancreatic carcinoma and colorectal carcinoma ( Hamada  ;  et al. , 2005 Imai  ).  et al. , 2013 ARID1  family genes encode integral components of the SWI/SNF neural progenitor-specific chromatin-remodeling BAF complex that potentially plays a tumor-suppressor role in several cancers ( Wilson and Roberts, 2011 ). For example, tumor-specific deletions encompassing  ARID1B  have been reported in CNS tumors ( Ichimura  ) and somatic mutations in  et al. , 2006 ARID1B  have also been reported to be associated with childhood cancer neuroblastoma ( Sausen  ).  et al. , 2013 SEMA4D  encodes axon guidance protein that regulates the functional activity of axons in the nervous system, whose physiological roles have been extensively explored in many facets of tumor progression, such as tumor angiogenesis, regulation of tumor-associated macrophages, and control of invasive growth ( Ch\u2019ng and Kumanogoh, 2010 ). Note that interference with  SEMA4D -mediated pathways could be a viable adjunct to anti-VEGF therapy ( Zhou  ). et al. , 2012 In addition, we found  TRAF7  mutation (c.1922G>C:p.R641P) in Patient 1, which is consistent with previous findings supporting the association between mutations in  TRAF  and benign/atypical meningiomas ( Clark  ). However, since when we ordered the targeted region sequencing capture array, we did not include this gene into consideration, we did not present result of further validation in an additional cohort of patients. Nevertheless,  et al. , 2013 TRAF7  may still be valuable in further replication studies in the future. Validation of candidate genes in an additional cohort Despite the rarity of this cancer subtype, we obtained DNA samples from four additional patients with malignant meningiomas, and performed custom-designed target sequencing of five candidate genes using NimbleGen capture arrays, aiming to identify additional mutations from these candidate genes. Since the targeted region sequencing captures a smaller region compared to WGS or WES, we were able to obtain sequencing data with higher depth coverage on the targeted regions: on average, the read depth is 455X and 100% of targeted regions are covered. We observed two recurrent mutations (c.979G> A:p.A327T and c.2138G>A:p.R713K) on gene  SEMA4D  that occurred in Patients 6 and 7. Note that since these two mutations were not novel (MAFs are 0.16 and 0.26 in the 1000 Genomes Project, respectively), they did not appear in the final set of novel variants obtained using variant reduction pipeline that filters for novel variants in WES data analysis stage. We also identified additional novel protein-altering mutations in  NF2, MN1 , and  MUC2  ( Table 3 ,  Table 4 ). We did not detect any additional protein-altering mutations on  ARID1B  in the validation stage. On the other hand, we were able to detect 104 additional mutations in  MUC2  gene, suggesting potential problems with alignment or variant calling (as many paralogs of mucins are present in human genome). We identified one protein-altering mutation (c.632C>T:p.A221V) in  NF2  across all four patients; notably, another missense mutation at the same position (c.632C>A) was reported in COSMIC database as a confirmed somatic mutation shared by two patients with meningiomas ( Forbes  ). In summary, the validation sample set provided additional evidence that  et al. , 2011 NF2  and  MN1  might be involved in meningioma pathogenesis.",
  "discussion": "Discussion In this study, we applied WES on five malignant meningiomas and identified several candidate genes that may be associated with malignant transformation of meningiomas. To further validate the functionality of these genes on meningiomas, we deep-sequenced them on an additional set of four malignant meningiomas and found two recurrent mutations in gene  SEMA4D , two novel mutations in  MN1 , and one missense mutation in  NF2 , which is also a confirmed meningioma somatic mutation in the COSMIC database. To our knowledge, our study is the first sequencing study focused on malignant meningiomas. We acknowledge several challenges and limitations of the current study. First, unlike several large-scale genomic studies profiling somatic variations on meningiomas, our study lacks blood DNA from control subjects, thus the ability to distinguish somatic mutations from germline mutations is limited ( Brastianos  ;  et al. , 2013 Clark  ;  et al. , 2013 Reuss  ). Therefore, we relied on filtering procedure on multiple databases to remove known germline variants, but the \u2018somatic\u2019 mutation calls may still contain genuine germline mutations that were private to these Chinese patients, as these databases were not specific to Chinese population. We therefore calculated the mutation frequencies of all novel mutations detected in the five frequently mutated genes as well as in  et al. , 2013 TRAF7  (which was also discussed in the Results section), using WES data from around 1,000 Chinese individuals ( Tang  ). We found that only one of the fourteen mutations (c.2138G>A:p.R713K in  et al. , 2014 SEMA4D ) has occurred with mutation frequency of 19% in this Chinese cohort, which means that except for c.2138G>A, all other mutations are unlikely to be germline variants specifically in Chinese population. Even with this analysis, we were still not able to validate their somatic status, given the absence of paired normal samples. Such lack of confirmed somatic mutations therefore reduced the power to detect cancer driver genes. For example, we could not use computational tools, such as MutSigCV used in Brastianos  et al .\u2019s study, to predict cancer driver genes, due to the unavailability of information of normal tissue samples and limited sample size. Second, the brain tissue is difficult to obtain and the availability of high-quality DNA samples from Formalin-Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) tissues were limited, even though additional patient samples were available. This issue is not uncommon for WES studies using FFPE tumor tissues, but previous studies demonstrated that 84.9% of the FFPE SNVs were common to fresh frozen tumor samples ( Menon  ), suggesting that FFPE may still be used for studying mutational spectrum of tumor samples. The same problem on FFPE also emerged during Sanger Sequencing validation stage. We even noticed that some validated variants actually came from low quality calls (quality <=30), which affected the reliability of the validation result. Third, malignant meningioma is an extremely rare disease with approximate incidence of 1.2 per million individuals according to the most recent Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States report, released in 2010 ( et al. , 2012 Ostrom  ). This rarity makes tumor samples extremely hard to find and challenges data analysis. For example, we observed one  et al. , 2013 NF2  mutation in five exome sequenced patients and one  NF2  in four targeted region sequenced patients, but this gene failed to achieve statistical significance since the sample size was too limited. Such difficulty was tackled by two other related studies by analyzing pooled meningiomas samples with different subtypes ( Brastianos  ) or focusing on the more common benign subtype ( et al. , 2013 Clark  ). However, we would not be able to apply these two approaches, because our focus was on the malignant meningiomas. The complexity of this disease, especially in sporadic cases, further complicates our study, since multiple genes rather than one single gene may be drivers for cancer progression. et al. , 2013 Nevertheless, our primary goal was to do an exploratory analysis using valuable data from these nine patients with malignant meningiomas, hoping to get a big picture of this disease on a whole-genome scale and find some interesting points to pin down in further research. Even though similar studies have been done on benign meningiomas ( Clark  ), it was the first time that five malignant meningiomas were sequenced on whole exome and that additional malignant meningiomas were sequenced by capture region sequencing. Therefore, data from our study provides valuable information on the genomic landscape of this rare but highly progressive disease. Moreover, to ensure the reliability of variant calls from whole exome sequencing results, we did a comparative approach by using two independent variant calling tools [GATK ( et al. , 2013 McKenna  ) and SAMtools ( et al. , 2010 Li  ), implemented by SeqMule pipeline] and by using the consensus variants from both variant calling tools as candidate variants for further validation, after observing inconsistencies of variants generated from different tools, such as SOAP, GATK, VarScan2, and SAMtools. et al. , 2009 In conclusion, our study represents an initial effort to define solely in malignant meningiomas the genomic spectrum of genetic alterations using NGS technology. In combination with various bioinformatics and biostatistics tools, we hope to understand this rare but deadly disease, to complement its current genomic profile and to help identify potential drug targets on these therapeutically challenging tumors.",
