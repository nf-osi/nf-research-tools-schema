Cell Lines, Data Access, and Extraction  To assess our analysis algorithm and identify promising targets, we analyzed an HTS dataset produced by Ferrer et al. [ 15 ], which reported pharmacologic and genomic profiling of plexiform neurofibroma-derived Schwann cells from NF1 patients and control nerve cells. Proliferation assays were used to screen a panel of 1912 small molecules (the MIPE 4.0 library [ 17 ]) against immortalized  NF1 \u2212/\u2212,  NF1 +/\u2212, and  NF1 +/+ cell lines [ 16 ], with the fluorescence intensity indicating survival and proliferation after treatment. Primary files [ 15 ] were accessed from Single Agent Screens through Synapse  https://doi.org/10.7303/syn4939906  (accessed on 1 May 2023). Access was provided by the Children\u2019s Tumor Foundation through their 2022 Hack4NF project. The following data were extracted from primary files: cell line name, drug name and target, log AC50 (LAC50, i.e., the log of the active concentration for a half-maximal response in molar concentration), R2 (R 2 , goodness of fit for the 4-parameter logistic regression model) values of dose\u2013response curves, AUC (TAUC, total area under the curve), the asymptote minimum (\u201cINF\u201d, response extrapolated to infinite concentration), and the asymptote maximum (\u201cZERO\u201d, response extrapolated to zero concentration). Separately, response data (dat0\u2013dat10) and concentration (C0\u2013C10, in \u03bcM) were downloaded and analyzed using a 4-parameter fit in SigmaPlot and with the DREA web tool (see  Supplemental Materials ). The DREA web tool recreates our final compound rankings using the application\u2019s default filters, based on the data files from Ferrer et al. [ 15 ]. 2.2. Data Analysis 2.2.1. AC50 (Potency) and Relative Potency The log AC50 values (in M) were converted to AC50 (in \u03bcM), which is a commonly used potency measure. The relative potency (\u2206pAC50) of a compound exposed to two cell lines is defined in Equations (1) and (2). For the data presented in the Results section, the reference ( ref ) cell line was ipnNF95.11C (note that other reference lines can be selected\u2014see our discussion on multiple controls) and the test ( test ) was one of the PNF1 cell lines. Generally, \u2206AC50 > 0 indicates that the test cell lines were more sensitive to a compound than the reference cell line.\n \n (1) \u2206 A C 50 = log \u2061 A C 50 r e f \u2212 log \u2061 A C 50 t e s t \u00a0 = log \u2061 A C 50 r e f A C 50 t e s t (2) \u2206 p A C 50 = \u2212 log \u2061 A C 50 r e f \u2212 log \u2061 A C 50 t e s t = \u2212 log \u2061 A C 50 r e f A C 50 t e s t In an analogous manner, the AUC, as provided in the original dataset (TAUC. total AUC), was used to determine the relative AUC (\u2206pAC50) using a method analogous to those described in Equations (1) and (2), except that the appropriate AUC values were used (in place of AC50). As described above, the reference cell line was ipnNF95.11C and the test was one of the PNF1 cell lines. 2.2.2. The   and  S  Indices \u0394S We establish an algorithm for creating a single value score  , which compares the relative effect of a given compound between a test cell line and a reference cell line. This is, in turn, generated from  \u0394S , which incorporates both AC50 (potency) and the effectiveness into a single value for a single compound in a single cell line. Equation (3) defines effectiveness (EFF) from concentration\u2013response curves and is calculated as the response asymptote at the maximum dose concentration (ASM S Max ) minus the response asymptote at the minimum dose concentration (ASM Min ). These two values (EFF and AC50) were incorporated into a single value  , reflecting both effectiveness and potency (Equation (4)) and, therefore, the overall response for a single compound in a single cell line. The relative value  S  assesses change in  \u0394S  from a reference cell line ( S S ref )  to   from a test cell line ( S ); that is to say ( S test  \u2212  S ref ) (Equation (5)).\n S test \n (3) E F F = A S M M a x \u2212 A S M M i n \n (4) S = log \u2061 E F F A C 50 (5) \u0394 S = S r e f \u2212 S t e s t = log \u2061 E F F A C 50 r e f \u2212 log \u2061 E F F A C 50 t e s t \u00a0 = log \u2061 E F F r e f E F F t e s t A C 5 0 t e s t A C 5 0 r e f The   value can be envisioned as a theoretical log molar ratio where both the reference and test are compared in a way that both reports complete responses and correct for partial responses based on the input data. The test response is normalized, relative to the reference. Note that the magnitude of  \u0394S  depends on the units of response and concentration, but  S  is a unitless quantity. This approach is analogous to that described by others and used in receptor pharmacology [ \u0394S 10 , 14 , 18 ].  The   score was used to monitor the relative effects of compounds across cell lines and monitor the effects of several compounds in a single cell line. When the compound resulted in a higher  \u0394S  in the reference cell line than in the test cell line, the test cell line was considered resistant to the compound.\n \u0394S (6) D r u g \u00a0 r e s i s t a n t , \u00a0 \u0394 S = S r e f \u2212 S t e s t \u00a0 > 0 When the compound gave a lower   in the reference cell line than in the test cell line, the test cell line was considered sensitive to the compound.\n \u0394S (7) D r u g \u00a0 s e n s i t i v e , \u00a0 \u0394 S = S r e f \u2212 S t e s t < 0 Since the tumor cell lines could have different drug sensitivities and harbor mutations that impact different intracellular signaling pathways and processes, we ranked compounds with   for individual cell lines. Then a consolidated evaluation of cell lines was established as the  \u0394S , which is a simple mean of the  \u0394S mean  values for a compound across the PNF1 cell lines. \u0394S 2.2.3. Prioritization To further prioritize compounds for a more in-depth follow-up, we selected compounds that generated concentration\u2013response curves with an average R 2  of at least 0.8 in all four test cell lines. R 2  values from the reference cell line were similarly set to at least 0.8, and compounds that did not meet this threshold were excluded from the prioritized list, except for cases where there was no concentration\u2013response. For the compounds meeting prioritization criteria, the   and  \u0394S mean  variance of the mean were calculated. Compounds displaying drug resistance ( \u0394S  > 0.5) or drug sensitivity ( \u0394S mean  < \u22120.5) were considered potentially biologically meaningful, as they would represent approximately a 3-fold change on an arithmetic scale ( \u0394S mean Figure 1 ). An additional threshold of 0.3 was set for the lower boundary of variance of the mean to ensure that the mean values were at least non-inferior to a null response. Non-inferiority can be shown if the difference between the two treatments does not cross a predefined inferiority margin. A threshold of 0.3 would represent approximately a 2-fold difference in an arithmetic scale. 2.2.4. Reference Cell Line and Use of Alternate and Multiple Controls For our analysis, we primarily used the  NF1 +/\u2212 cell line ipnNF95.11C as our reference cell line and the  NF1 \u2212/\u2212 plexiform neurofibroma cell lines (PNF1 cells) ipNF05.5-MX, ipNF06.2A, ipNF95.11b C/T, and ipNF95.6 as test lines. The reference ipnNF95.11C cell line is derived from the non-tumor peripheral nerve of an NF1 patient and was selected because individuals with NF1 syndrome have a constitutional heterozygosity for  NF1.  Neurofibromas often arise from cells with additional somatic mutations of  NF1  [ 14 ]. Ideal therapies would, therefore, target  NF1 \u2212/\u2212 neurofibroma cells, but not background  NF1+ /\u2212 cells to yield maximum anti-tumor specificity. The dataset from Ferrer et. al. also included additional neurofibromin-competent cell lines, specifically human foreskin fibroblasts [HFF] and the Schwann cell lines ipNF02.3 2\u03bb, ipNF02.8.   calculations using these other control lines can be investigated via the DREA web app. \u0394S One way to adapt   to the comparison of multiple control or tumor cell lines involves selecting one of the control cell lines as the reference and using that reference to evaluate the other control cell lines versus tumor cell lines.  \u0394S  could be determined using HFF, for example, as the reference for each control cell line and tumor cell line. The  \u0394S  of the reference and tumor cell lines would be determined. Then, one can additionally derive the change in the  \u0394S means  of the reference lines against the tumor cell lines ( \u0394S means ). This approach can be used for a group of different control cell lines or similarly applied to replicates of a single control cell line and multiple tumor cell lines. See supplement  \u0394\u0394S Figure S1  on   for an example.\n \u0394\u0394S (8) \u0394 \u0394 S = \u0394 S \u00a0 m e a n t u m o r \u2212 \u0394 S \u00a0 m e a n c o n t r o l",

  "introduction": "1. Introduction Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a rare chronic neurocutaneous disease caused by loss-of-function alterations in the gene  NF1 , encoding the tumor suppressor neurofibromin [ 1 , 2 ]. Via RAS inhibition,  NF1  mutations affect multiple signaling pathways linked to cell survival and proliferation and the development of cancers. NF1 patients often develop neurofibromas, which are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors. In 8% to 16% of NF1 patients, however, these benign neurofibromas progress to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) [ 3 , 4 ]. MPNSTs are characterized by the deletion or loss of function of tumor suppressors, including neurofibromin itself, and amplifications or gain of function mutations in several oncogenes, including  MET ,  EGFR , and other receptor tyrosine kinases. Other deregulated pathways in MPNSTs include the MTOR, HIPPO, WNT, and RAS signaling pathways [ 5 ]. Currently, the sole FDA-approved drug treatment for NF1-associated inoperable plexiform neurofibromas is the MEK inhibitor selumetinib [ 6 , 7 , 8 ], which is indicated for the treatment of pediatric (but not adult) NF1-associated nerve sheath tumors. This deficit highlights the need for different ways to derive promising targets and new drugs. One drug development technique involves using high-throughput screening (HTS) to assess the effect of an array of drugs on cancer cells and, thereby, identify promising targets for further experimentation. The effective prioritization of drugs depends on the appropriate analysis of the resulting data. Typically, the prioritization of drugs has been quantified through evaluating AC50, or area under the curve (AUC) values. Both techniques have limitations. AC50 is the concentration of a drug that induces half-maximal activity. The relative potency of two compounds can be compared by computing the log of the ratio of two AC50 values (\u0394pAC50). For drugs generating complete cytotoxic responses within a given concentration range, AC50 and \u0394pAC50 values can effectively be used for comparison. This relationship breaks down, however, when one or both of the drugs being compared are only partially effective, which is a common finding in HTS [ 9 , 10 , 11 ]. The AUC is the area under the response curve for a cell population over the tested drug concentration range. There are, however, reports of poor concordance of half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) and AUC measures [ 12 ] (as well as AC50 and AUC). Guha et al. [ 13 ] have also pointed out additional issues involving the use of AUC, which may limit its general utility. To address these limitations, we developed relative activity scales ( S  indices) for normalizing and measuring drug activity. The S-index combines potency and effectiveness data, facilitating a comparison of the relative activity of compounds across drug classes and cell lines. Normalizing activity by including the maximal response corrects for differences in full or partial drug sensitivity and can be determined without the need to re-fit the underlying concentration\u2013response data to a more complex model [ 14 ]. We applied our  -index analysis to a high-throughput screening dataset [ S 15 ], which screened a panel of 1912 drugs against NF1-patient-derived neurofibroma cell lines and reference peripheral nerve cell lines (see  Table 1 ). The resulting list of drugs to which these cell lines are sensitive or resistant, and the algorithm itself, may prove useful in drug development efforts.",
  "results": "3. Results 3.1. Drug Resistance and Sensitivity Focusing Primarily on a Single PNF1 Cell Line To validate the algorithm, we initially evaluated the effects of selumetinib and other MEK inhibitors on one test cell line. We assessed the   drug sensitivity of ipNF05.5-MX cells ( \u0394S NF1 \u2212/\u2212) using ipnNF95.11C ( NF1 +/\u2212) as the reference cell line. Using our   measure, we show that these cells are particularly sensitive to PD-0325901 (mirdametinib) and trametinib, and to a lesser extent, selumetinib ( \u0394S Figure 2 ). In this case,   scores appear to have reasonable concordance with the concentration\u2013response curves. These results agree with clinical trial results, showing significant reductions in plexiform tumor volume after treatment with mirdametinib or trametinib [ \u0394S 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 ]. Since   may be considered an alternative to AC50 and AUC-based methods, the Pearson product-moment correlation was used to compare outcomes from  \u0394S , \u0394pAC50, and \u0394pAUC ( \u0394S Figure 2 B\u2013D) from three MEK inhibitors (selumetinib, PD-0325901, and trametinib). No strong correlation was found for any pair of endpoints (\u0394pAC50 and \u0394pAUC, \u0394pAC50 and  , \u0394pAUC and  \u0394S ) across all plexiform neurofibroma cell lines. A moderate correlation was found, however, when comparing \u0394pAC50 and  \u0394S  for individual cell lines. This outcome could be largely anticipated as those endpoints measure different, albeit interrelated, components of the concentration\u2013response curve (also see  \u0394S Supplemental Table S1 ). As an extension, no strong correlation was found when monitoring rank outcomes (see  Section 3.4 \u2014Comparing Ranking Methodologies) from the  , \u0394pAC50 mean, and \u0394pAUC mean, again suggesting that each endpoint is monitoring a different aspect of the concentration\u2013response curves. \u0394S mean We also note that multiple controls can be used in a single analysis by using Equation (8). See  Supplemental Figure S1  for an example. Individual low-concentration responses higher than 100% of the DMSO control were indicative of drug-stimulated growth, as found for ipNF05.5-MX treated with MEK inhibitors and doxorubicin ( Figure 2  and  Figure 3 ). The underlying reason that some drugs display asymptote maximum values above 100% of the DMSO control in  Figure 2  and  Figure 3  (particularly in ipNF05.5-MX) is not clearly understood. It is possible that these low-concentration responses are due to an unknown experimental variability, or some inherent cell line-to-cell line drug response variability.  Supplement Figure S2  compares the histograms of the upper asymptotes from all the plexiform cell lines, including ipNF05.5-MX. All the histograms demonstrated a bell-shaped curve with broadly similar centers. This suggests that it is unlikely that there was a gross plating error or focal cell number error that led to the apparent stimulatory response. It is possible that there is some inherent cell line-to-cell line cause of the low-dose drug response affecting ipNF05.5-MX, which might include hormesis among other explanations. In contrast to compounds inducing sensitivity, ipNF05.5-MX cells showed resistance to a panel of TOP2A inhibitors, compared to the response of the control ipnNF95.11C cell line ( Figure 3 ). Furthermore, drug resistance was found for 6/7 anthracyclines in ipNF05.5-MX cells. These results were also observed in other PNF1 cell lines when examining the concentration\u2013response curves. Analyses of drugs against a single cell line may be useful when developing precision medicine treatments for tumors that share genetic or proteomic similarities [ 23 ]. 3.2. Drug Assessment by Signaling Pathway In some cases, researchers may want to test whether a molecular signaling pathway as a whole is a promising target for drug discovery. To evaluate drugs across PNF1 cell lines, we used  , a simple mean of the  \u0394S mean  values for all four PNF1 cell lines.  \u0394S Table 2  shows the   for compounds known to affect the PI3K/AKT/MTOR signaling pathway. The top hits in this pathway are GNE-490, triciribine phosphate, and WYE-354, which are known inhibitors of PI3K, AKT, and MTOR, respectively. \u0394S mean Additionally, PNF1 tumor cell lines as a group were largely resistant to compounds that target non-RAS-binding partners of neurofibromin [ 24 , 25 ]. Concentration\u2013response curves for two compounds that impact such non-RAS binding partners are found in  Figure 4 . These binding partners include tubulin [ 25 ], HTR6, the focal adhesion protein (FAK) [ 24 , 26 ], and LIMK2 [ 27 ]. Here, NVP-TAE226, a FAK inhibitor, and BMS-3, a LIMK1/2 inhibitor, each displayed drug-resistance in PNF1 cell lines. Arranging the results by the   score and signaling pathway target may be useful in identifying promising drugs for follow-up (see  \u0394S mean Table 2 ). In this regard, AKT inhibitors triciribine phosphate and A-443654 may be of downstream interest. 3.3. Discussion of Prioritized Compounds In this section, we will discuss a subset of the drugs identified as \u2018high-sensitivity\u2019 or \u2018resistance\u2019. Analyses of other compounds are detailed in  Figure 5  and  Figure 6  and can be explored via the DREA web tool (see  Supplemental Materials ). Prioritized compounds have an average R 2  of at least 0.8 in all four test cell lines and display drug resistance (  > 0.5) or drug sensitivity ( \u0394S mean  < \u22120.5), as described in the methods section. For the current analysis, we compared the response of each cell line ( \u0394S mean NF1 \u2212/\u2212) to that of the ipnNF95.11C ( NF1 +/\u2212) cell line, but responses can also be calculated using several other control lines in DREA. 3.3.1. MEK Inhibitors Several MEK inhibitors have been used in clinical trials for NF1-related tumors, including the FDA-approved drug selumetinib [ 7 , 8 ]. Our analysis identified trametinib as a prioritized compound, to which PNF1 cell lines as a group were sensitive. Trametinib shows promising results in clinical trials, significantly reducing the neurofibroma tumor size [ 22 , 28 ]. While selumetinib was not prioritized by  , some cell lines showed sensitivity to it, suggesting it may be effective in specific tumors or cells therein. In vivo, different neurofibromas, even in the same individual, can carry different somatic  \u0394S mean NF1  mutations [ 29 ]. This can affect both RAS and non-RAS cell responses. Alternatively, the differences could reflect a more robust compensatory increase in pMEK levels, indicating the occurrence of reactivation of the MAPK pathway [ 25 ]. 3.3.2. PI3K and AKT1 Inhibitors The most pronounced drug sensitivity across PNF1 cell lines was to the class I PI3KCB inhibitor GSK-2636771. GSK-2636771 is effective in PTEN-deficient tumors [ 30 , 31 ], presumably compensating for the upregulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway engendered by the loss of PTEN inhibition. PTEN pathway alterations have been implicated in early NF1-associated tumorigenesis [ 32 ], with marked PTEN reductions found in MPNSTs compared to both neurofibromas and normal nerve tissue [ 33 , 34 ]. Another PI3K-targeted compound identified in our sensitivity analysis was GNE-490, an experimental, pan-PI3K inhibitor that would be expected to inhibit PI3KCB and PI3KCA [ 35 ]. GNE-490 is effective against mouse xenograft models of breast and prostate cancers [ 35 ]. In contrast, drug resistance was found for two PI3K inhibitors (see  Figure 6 ): PIK-294, an inhibitor that is somewhat selective for the PI3K catalytic subunit p110\u03b4 [ 36 ], and to a lesser extent, BYL-719, which is selective for the p110\u03b1 subunit [ 37 ]. The result for BYL-719 is unexpected, given the sensitivity of the cells to GNE-490, another p110\u03b1 inhibitor. This may suggest differing structure\u2013activity relationships [ 38 ] between these compounds and GNE-490 [ 35 ]. Acting downstream of PI3K, cell lines were sensitive to three AKT1 inhibitors (triciribine phosphate, A-443654, and AT-7867). Triciribine phosphate is the only one of these compounds that has reached the investigational stage of drug development [ 39 ]. The identification of AKT-targeting compounds is particularly interesting, given that in MPNSTs neither AKT nor mTORC2 are required for tumor remission [ 40 ]. This may reflect important differences in pathway utilization between MPNSTs and PNF1. No AKT-targeting drugs were resistant in our analysis. 3.3.3.  TOP2A  and  CHEK1  Gene Product Inhibitors TOP2A , one of the top 20 genes upregulated in MPNST [ 41 ], encodes the enzyme DNA topoisomerase II alpha, which controls and alters the topologic states of DNA during transcription. Matching this observation, PNF1 tumor cell lines displayed drug-resistance to anthracycline topoisomerase inhibitors, e.g., idarubicin, epirubicin, mitoxantrone, and doxorubicin. Finding anthracycline resistance in PNF1 cell lines suggests that this resistance develops early in the tumorigenesis cascade and may later contribute to the poor therapeutic response of doxorubicin in unresectable MPNSTs [ 42 ]. DNA topoisomerase II alpha activates cell cycle progression from the G2 to the M phase by inhibiting CHK1 phosphorylation [ 43 ] (CHK1, checkpoint kinase 1, is the protein product of the  CHEK1  gene), promoting the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cancer cell invasion. CHK1 is required for checkpoint-mediated cell cycle arrest and is upregulated in MPNST, compared to neurofibromas [ 44 ]. We found that cells were sensitive to SCH-900776, which is a selective CHK1 inhibitor. However, these cells were resistant to the CHK1 inhibitor rabusertib. This observation also indicates that there may be an important role in the structure\u2013activity relationships of these compounds and their target. In addition to  CHEK1 , neurofibromas frequently harbor alterations in  PRKDC  [ 45 ], which may contribute to resistance. 3.3.4. Heat Shock Proteins We found sensitivity to three drugs targeting HSP90AB1 (geldanamycin, alvespimycin HCl, and retaspimycin). Given that the loss of neurofibromin activates HSF1 to promote carcinogenesis [ 46 ], a finding that plexiform neurofibroma cell lines are sensitive to HSP90AB1 inhibitors is not entirely unexpected, and the potential for heat shock protein inhibitors as NF1 treatments has been suggested [ 47 ]. Combined treatment with mTOR and HSP90 inhibitors in vitro led to a decrease in LD50 in human and murine MPNST cell lines compared to a human fibroblast cell line (IMR90), and in vivo, to an increase in survival in tumor-bearing Nf1/p53 mutant mice [ 48 ]. While geldanamycin is too toxic to be used clinically, geldanamycin analogs and other HSP90 inhibitors may be good targets for the downstream combination drug evaluation. 3.3.5. Serotonin Modulators A subset of four prioritized drugs act via serotonin signaling. This is notable in that several antidepressants have carcinostatic effects [ 49 ]. Two serotonin reuptake inhibitors (the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine and the serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor duloxetine) were prioritized based on  . Clomipramine interferes with autophagic flux in HeLa cells and inhibits growth and \u201cstemness\u201d in lung cancer via its metabolite desmethylclomipramine [ \u0394S mean 50 ]. Duloxetine is a dual serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that enhances tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) apoptosis in tumor cells [ 51 ]. Two serotonin receptor antagonists (piboserod and sibutramine) were also prioritized. Piboserod is a selective antagonist of the G-protein-coupled HTR4 serotonin receptor [ 52 ]. Sibutramine, in vivo, is a norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine reuptake inhibitor; it has an affinity for several monoaminergic receptors, including HTR1. Both HTR1 and HTR4 can, in some tumor types, act through both the MAPK-ERK pathway and the PI3K-AKT-MTOR pathway [ 53 ]. 3.3.6. Non-Prioritized Compounds of Interest We prioritized drug responses that had an average R 2  of at least 0.8 in all four test cell lines and that displayed drug resistance (  > 0.5) or drug sensitivity ( \u0394S mean  < \u22120.5). There were, however, drug responses in the original panel that represented missing values or responses in fewer than four cell lines. Some of the drugs with the highest  \u0394S mean  drug-sensitive scores were not included in the final lists due to a single cell line with missing or inconsistent data. However, these compounds (secoisolariciresinol and verteporfin, for example) may also be of interest in follow-up studies. \u0394S mean 3.4. Comparing Ranking Methodologies Figure 7  provides a relative ranking of test compounds anchored on  , with comparisons to \u0394pAC50 means and \u0394pAUC means. While there were some similarities in rankings, by and large, the rankings across compounds showed little concordance in paired comparisons of \u0394pAC50 means, \u0394pAUC means, and  \u0394S means . This is similar to outcomes found in  \u0394S\u00a0means Figure 2  for \u0394pAC50, \u0394pAUC, and  . Since these endpoints are derived from the same test system and concentration\u2013response curves, the lack of concordance suggests that \u0394pAC50, \u0394pAUC, and  \u0394S  measure different aspects of concentration\u2013response curve information. \u0394S AC50 and \u0394pAC50 are used to monitor changes in drug potency. They do not take into account response effectiveness, which is a second dimension of a concentration\u2013response curve, and can be misleading when comparing drug responses that display full effectiveness to those with partial effectiveness. The AUC is based on segmenting the entire two-dimensional area underneath the curve and then summing all the sub-values, thereby providing an aggregate measure that considers potency and effectiveness. Differences in the AUC can imply changes in drug sensitivity. Such aggregate values may not always be desirable and may complicate the interpretation of \u0394pAUC because, as pointed out by Guha et al. [ 13 ], the AUC for a compound exhibiting a shift in potency but no shift in efficacy can be the same as (or similar to) the AUC for a compound exhibiting a shift in efficacy but not a shift in potency. The   indices ( S  and  S ) incorporate effectiveness and potency and normalize activity through the inclusion of EFF, which is the response effectiveness. This corrects for differences in full or partial drug sensitivity.  \u0394S  can infer the sensitivity (or resistance) of a given drug in a tumor cell line(s) (a proxy for tumors) relative to a reference cell line (a proxy for normal tissue). Compounds with high sensitivity in plexiform neurofibroma cell lines based on the  \u0394S  or  \u0394S  would be good candidates for follow-on confirmatory and/or in vivo studies. It is likely preferable to investigate treatments for non-malignant plexiform neurofibromas, which have high tumor sensitivity relative to normal tissues, as a patient may receive protracted drug treatment. \u0394S mean",
  "discussion": "4. Conclusions In this study, AC50 and EFF were combined into a single value ( ) to furnish system-independent ratios ( S  and  \u0394S ), used to assess the relative drug sensitivity and drug resistance of a panel of compounds. The combination of EFF and AC50 into a single value considers the heterogeneous effects of partial and full drug responses. Using our algorithm, we recapitulate the identification of MEK inhibitors as potential therapeutics for NF1-related tumors and identify other compounds to which PNF1 cell lines are particularly sensitive or resistant. We suggest that the algorithms behind the Drug Response Evaluation and Assessment (DREA) web tool (available at:  \u0394S mean https://nf.mocomakers.com ) can also be used in both primary cell cultures and other cell models, including induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) [ 54 ]. Given high-throughput data, the algorithm can be applied to any cancer model as needed. For example, the used dataset [ 15 ] had other cell lines, such as human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) that may be useful in other styles of analysis. Compounds with partial or low efficacy can represent important modulators of biological activity and may be particularly difficult to recognize based on AC50 analysis only. The use of   may help to identify promising compounds that display partial effectiveness. The use of  \u0394S  outcomes from multiple cell lines, as used here, may help in addressing drugs that generate partial responses in vitro and help address the known heterogeneity found in tumor cells and tumor cell lines in general [ \u0394S mean 55 , 56 , 57 ]. DREA can be used to assess candidate compounds individually by the cell line, as in  Figure 5  and  Figure 6 . This allows an analysis to reflect the molecular heterogeneity of different cell lines. In the development of treatments, wide applicability of the treatment is vital. Therefore, we also assess the   and variance values, reflecting responses of PNF1 cell lines as a group, with the goal of assuring biological relevance and approaching response uniformity across PNF1 cell lines. \u0394S mean The current study focused on the use of single agent screens; however, it is possible that the   indices could be useful to guide the examination of drug combinations using a modification of the IDACombo method [ S 58 ] and/or SynergyFinder 3.0 [ 59 ]. IDACombo is based on independent drug action (IDA), where the therapeutic benefit is derived from the single most effective drug in a drug combination. SynergyFinder 3.0 incorporates a parametric synergy scoring model and multi-dimensional synergy of combinations (MuSyC), which provides the users with the possibility to distinguish whether the identified synergy is due to enhanced potency and/or efficacy of the single agents. The use of   indices, particularly  S  when data are available for multiple cell lines with a common reference line, can be useful in the high-throughput screening assessment of potentially therapeutical useful compounds for the treatment of NF1-related tumors and other cancers. When prioritizing research for a rare disease such as NF1, a cross-compound analysis such as this may be of utility for focusing on the promising mechanisms of action, as well as investigational therapeutics. Our results provide both an affirmation of already approved or developing therapeutics, but also serve as the basis for further pre-clinical evaluations of high-scoring but sparsely explored compounds. \u0394S mean It is also essential to increase to robustness of our method to incorporate multiple control cell lines within the analysis when possible. In this analysis, we used a limited dataset of plexiform neurofibroma cell lines, precluding the use of multiple controls in the current work. However, in fields like breast cancer, where there are more known control lines, an   analysis with multiple controls could likely be done. \u0394\u0394S It is envisioned that   could be used as part of an overall orthogonal approach to drug evaluation and selection. Orthogonal approaches combined with  \u0394S  could help increase the predictive value of in vitro concentration\u2013response studies and, thereby, reduce the cost and time constraints of follow-on in vivo studies and pre-clinical drug development. With an orthogonal approach,  \u0394S  may also be able to provide a different perspective, if not clarity, on known issues related to the individual use of AC50, effectiveness, or AUC. \u0394S",
