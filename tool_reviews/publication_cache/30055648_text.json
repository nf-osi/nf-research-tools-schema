  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are aggressive sarcomas characterized by high recurrence rates and early metastases. These tumors arise more frequently within neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and present with resistance during standard chemotherapy leading to increased mortality and morbidity in those patients. In vitro all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and MEK inhibitors (MEKi) were shown to inhibit tumor proliferation, especially when applied in combination. Therefore, we established a nude mouse model to investigate if treatment of xenografts derived from NF1 associated S462 and T265 MPNST cells respond to ATRA and the MEKi PD0325901. RESULTS: We demonstrated that human NF1 associated MPNST derived from S462 but not T265 cells form solid subcutaneous tumors in Foxn1 nude mice but not in Balb/c, SHO or Shorn mice. We verified a characteristic staining pattern of human MPNST xenografts by immunohistochemistry. Therapeutic effects of ATRA and/or MEKi PD0325901 on growth of S462 MPNST xenografts in Foxn1 nude mice were not demonstrated in vitro, as we did not observe significant suppression of MPNST growth compared with placebo treatment.",

  "methods": "Materials and methods Cell culture and colony formation assay Human MPNST cell lines S462 and T265 were described previously [ 23 \u2013 26 ]. Cells were cultured in DMEM (4.5\u00a0g/L glucose, 2\u00a0mM  l -glutamine, 10% (v/v) FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin and 1\u00a0mM sodium pyruvate). Clonogenic assays were performed as described elsewhere with specifications: 300 cells per well were seeded in a 6-well plate and incubated for 14\u00a0days. [ 27 ] Following incubation, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with staining/fixation solution (6% glutaraldehyde/0.5% crystal violet/PBS) for 30\u00a0min. Colonies were defined as accumulation of\u2009>\u200950 cells. Images were taken per well (Olympus SZX12 microscope) using Adobe Photoshop CS5 (Adobe Systems Software Ireland Limited 2010), and colonies were counted using the cell counter tool of ImageJ (NIH United States 2014). Xenotransplantation and ATRA quantification Experiments were approved by the federal state authority of nature, environment and consumer protection of Nordrhein-Westfalen (\u201cLandesamt f\u00fcr Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz Nordrhein-Westfalen\u201c, LANUV) (27.08.2013, reference 84-02.04.2013.A275). Balb/c Nude (Balb/cAnNRj-Foxn1nu/Foxn1nu, Janvier), Foxn1 (Nu/Nu) Nude (Crl:NU-Foxn1nu, Charles River), SHO \u00ae  (SCID Hairless Outbred, Crl:SHO-PrkdcscidHrhr, Charles River) and Shorn (ShrN NOD SCID, NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidHrhr/NCrHsd, Harlan) mice were scheduled for xenotransplantations. Female mice were housed in single cages and all strains lacked hair and T cells. SHO \u00ae  and Shorn mice also lacked B cells, and Shorn mice additional partially lacked NK cells. We followed published criteria for generating xenografts. At study initiation nude mice were 5\u20137\u00a0weeks old. A total of 5\u2009\u00d7\u200910 6  cells (T265, S462) within 30% Matrigel\u2122 (Corning, GFR)/DMEM were implanted by subcutaneous injection (150 \u03bcL) into the right and/or left flank. Blood was collected on day 21 of treatment, 2\u20133\u00a0h after oral application. Plasma was extracted immediately from blood by centrifugation (1000\u00d7 g , 5\u00a0min). ATRA plasma levels were analyzed as described elsewhere [ 28 ]. Pharmacological treatment, tumor volume quantification and preparation Daily oral treatment started 42\u00a0days after subcutaneous implantation over a period of 28\u00a0days. Ten mice were treated with ATRA (15\u00a0mg/kg) or PD0325901 (10\u00a0mg/kg). Intake was scored (1\u2009=\u2009full intake, 0.5\u2009=\u2009incomplete intake, 0\u2009=\u2009no intake) and mean values were calculated. Tumor volume was measured three times a week using a digital caliper and calculated according to the formula: v\u2009=\u2009L\u2009\u00d7\u2009W 2  (\u03c0/6) (L-longest diameter, W-width) [ 29 ]. Intra-cardiac perfusion was used for euthanization of mice. Under deep anaesthesia (1.8% (v/v) ketamine and 0.3% xylazine in PBS), peritoneal cavity, thorax, left heart ventricle and the right heart atrium were opened, and 10\u00a0mL PBS were injected into the ventricle. For fixation of mice tissues injection of 10\u00a0mL 4% paraformaldehyde followed PBS intra-cardiac perfusion. Tumors were dissected and stored in 4% PFA for 24\u00a0h followed by paraffin embedding. Tumors were dehydrated in increasing alcohol concentrations in a Tissue-Tek VIP system (Sakura) and embedded in paraffin. Immunohistochemistry of MPNST xenografts was performed using antibodies against S100 (monoclonal, mouse, 10\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, Ventana S100-4C4.9) to demonstrate human Schwann cell origin, anti-Ki67 (monoclonal, mouse, 0.4\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, Ventana Ki-67-30.9) to evaluate proliferation fraction, anti-CD34 (monoclonal, mouse, 0.8\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, Ventana QBEnd/10) to demonstrate vessel and stem cell formation, anti-p53 (monoclonal, mouse, Ventana Bp-53-11), anti-p16 (monoclonal, mouse, 1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, Ventana 725-4713), anti-vimentin (vimentin, monoclonal, mouse, 2.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, Ventana V9 and anti-actin (monoclonal, mouse, 0.02\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, Cell Margue 1A4). Staining was visualized using the ultraView\u2122 Universal Alkaline Phosphatase Red Detection Kit (Ventana, A-PAP method). Staining was performed in the automated staining system Ventana BenchMark XT according to the standard protocols. Statistical analysis ANOVA followed by post hoc  t  test was used to compare differences between groups. Kruskal\u2013Wallis test was applied to compare groups of 4 mice for weight gain. A p value\u2009<\u20090.05 was defined to be significant. The SPSS program (IBM SPSS Statistics Standard) was applied.",
