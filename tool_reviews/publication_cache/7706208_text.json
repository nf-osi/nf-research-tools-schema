  "abstract": "We succeeded in cloning the exon 8-spliced out transcript of neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) gene in human glioma cell lines. We then investigated the expression of the spliced out form in various human tissues by PCR analysis followed by Southern blot hybridization and sequencing to evaluate whether it was generated by normal alternative splicing or by a splicing mutation. The analysis revealed the splicing out of exon 8 in the various tissues, and the transcript missing exon 8 should thus be considered as a product of normal alternative splicing. Our results further support the possibility that the NF2 gene expresses multiple alternatively-spliced transcripts variantly in different tissue types.",
