  "abstract": "Linkage analysis of peripheral neurofibromatosis to DNA markers on chromosome 8.  Diehl SR(1), Boehnke M, Collins FS, Erickson RP, Karolyi IJ, Ploughman LM,  Pericak-Vance MA, Aylsworth AS, Roses AD.  Author information: (1)Department of Human Genetics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48109-0618.  Linkage relationships of the gene for peripheral neurofibromatosis (NF) were  assessed in a large American Caucasian pedigree using two DNA markers located on  chromosome 8. Linkage to the thyroglobulin locus, located at 8q24, was excluded  (lod less than or equal to -2.0) to 21 cM. Data obtained for the tissue  plasminogen activator locus, located at 8p12, excluded linkage to 4 cM. These  results exclude between 20 to 30% of chromosome 8 as a possible map location for  the NF gene in this family. Comparison of the two DNA markers excluded their  linkage to 0.5 cM.
