  "abstract": "Meningiomas are mostly benign brain tumours, with a potential for becoming atypical or malignant. On the basis of comprehensive genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses, we compared benign meningiomas to atypical ones. Here, we show that the majority of primary (de novo) atypical meningiomas display loss of NF2, which co-occurs either with genomic instability or recurrent SMARCB1 mutations. These tumours harbour increased H3K27me3 signal and a hypermethylated phenotype, mainly occupying the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) binding sites in human embryonic stem cells, thereby phenocopying a more primitive cellular state. Consistent with this observation, atypical meningiomas exhibit upregulation of EZH2, the catalytic subunit of the PRC2 complex, as well as the E2F2 and FOXM1 transcriptional networks. Importantly, these primary atypical meningiomas do not harbour TERT promoter mutations, which have been reported in atypical tumours that progressed from benign ones. Our results establish the genomic landscape of primary atypical meningiomas and potential therapeutic targets.",
  "methods": "Methods Clinical materials Institutional Review Board approvals for genetic studies, along with written consent from all study subjects, were obtained at the participating institutions. The specific approval committees included the Human Investigation Committee at Yale University, Ethikkommission der Medizinischen Fakultät der Universität zu Köln and Ethikkommission an der Medizinischen Fakultät der Rheinischen Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn. Selective tissue dissection For each frozen specimen submitted for whole-exome sequencing, sections were re-reviewed to confirm the diagnosis and assess the adequacy of the frozen tissue for experimental analysis. On H&E-stained sections from frozen tissue blocks, areas of interest were identified and microscopically dissected to ensure that each sample consisted of >70% tumour cells; unwanted regions such as inflammatory and necrotic areas were excluded. Tumours in the replication cohorts did not undergo selective tissue dissection. DNA/RNA was prepared using the Allprep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) with the assistance of a QIAcube. Exome capture and sequencing Nimblegen/Roche human solution-capture exome array (Roche Nimblegen, Inc.) was used to capture the exomes of blood and tumour samples according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Sequencing of the library was performed on Illumina HiSeq instruments using paired-end 74 basepair reads by multiplexing two tumour samples or three blood samples per lane. Image analysis and base calling was performed by Illumina Pipeline with default parameters, installed on Yale University's High Performance Computing Cluster. Whole-exome sequence analysis We first filtered the reads based on Illumina quality score. The low-quality 3′-end of the reads using FASTX-Toolkit ( http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/index.html ) and PCR primer-contaminated sequences, that are considered to lead to alignment artifacts, were trimmed using cutadapt. The sequences were kept only if both reads in a pair had more than 35 bases remaining after the above trimming and filtering quality measures. The reads were aligned to the human reference genome (version GRCh37) using Stampy (version 1.0.21) in a hybrid mode with BWA (version 0.5.9-r16) 42 43 . MarkDuplicates algorithm from Picard was used for flagging PCR duplicates. Alignment quality metrics were calculated using CollectAlignmentSummaryMetrics and CalculateHsMetrics utilities of Picard ( http://picard.sourceforge.net/ ). Mean target coverage was 246 and 160 for tumour and blood respectively. The average percentage of reads with at least 20 × coverage was 93% and 90% for tumour and blood respectively. We performed multi-sequence local realignment around putative and known insertion/deletion sites. This was followed by the base quality score recalibration using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK, version 2.5–2) 44 . We detected variant sites (point mutations and small indels) for tumour and matched blood pairs using the HaplotypeCaller algorithm from GATK. The genotype likelihood-based somatic score, which was proposed by Li, was used 45 . We filtered out the variants according to the classes of genotype changes in tumour with respect to the blood 46 . We used various quality metrics to filter out variants: (1) somatic score less than 20, (2) overlapping a RepeatMasker or segmental duplication annotated region, (3) low quality (<30) and low quality-by-depth values (<1) (4) high mapping quality zero reads, (5) strand bias, (6) mutation cluster of size >2 (7) homopolymer runs of length >=10 base pairs within +/− 5 base pairs around the mutation or from the right of the mutation or (8) ClippingRankSum (calculated by GATK)<−3 or >3. We also excluded the sites that have more than 1% frequency in the NHLBI Exome Variant Server Database ( http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/ ) and 1000 Genome Database. In addition we used our internal database of 2216 exomes to compare the variant allele frequencies of each gene and excluded the variants in the genes that have greater than 150 variant alleles. Finally, we annotated variant alleles using Ensembl database (version 69) with the help of Variant Effect Predictor (v2.7) tool 47 . From these functional annotations, we selected the most-deleterious consequence for each variant site and considered the variant allele to be deleterious if its consequence was annotated as transcript ablation, splice acceptor/donor, stop gained, frame shift, stop lost and splice region, initiator codon, nonsynonymous codon predicted to be deleterious/damaging, or in frame codon loss/gain. We also called somatic point mutations and indels with MuTect 48 /Indelocator ( http://archive.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/indelocator ) and Strelka 49 . Since MuTect can only detect somatic point mutations it is used together with short indel variant calling method Indelocator. The co-occurrence and mutual exclusivity of genes were assessed using one-sided Fisher's exact test. The MutSig algorithm was used for determining the genes that were mutated more often than expected by chance with FDR <5% (ref.  50 ). Mutational signatures of 6 main categories, T>C/A>G, A>C/T>G, G>C/C>G, C>T/G>A, A>T/T>A, G>T/C>A) are calculated based on filtered somatic variants. Clonality analysis Clonality rate of each somatic mutation was calculated based on the variant allele frequency and ploidy at that site, taking into account the admixture rate of each tumour. CNV identification from exome data The log ratio of depth of coverage between tumour and blood was calculated using GATK- Depth Of Coverage  tool. CNV segments were then called from the log ratio of depth of coverage using ExomeCNV R package 51 . False positive CNV events were corrected by calculating minor allele frequencies (BAF) in each CNV segment. In each CNV segment, B-allele frequencies (BAF) at heterozygous sites should deviate from 0.5 by at least 0.05 units. We estimated the admixture rate based on CNV analysis of paired tumour and blood samples. Copy number loss regions were extracted and for those regions the BAF of each tumour SNP that was heterozygous in blood was calculated. Finally the admixture rate was estimated from the degree of deviation from homozygosity using the qpure R package 52 . Custom molecular inversion probe sequencing and analysis Targeted sequencing of exomic regions and exon-intron boundaries of  NF2 ,  SMARCB1 ,  TRAF7 ,  PIK3CA ,  PIK3R1 ,  PRKAR1A ,  SMO  and  SUFU  plus the recurrent variants AKT1 p.Glu17Lys and KLF4 p.Lys409Gln was performed using molecular inversion probes (MIPs). Recurrent mutations in  POLR2A  were assessed with Sanger screening. Custom amplicon sequencing and analysis. Libraries consisting of the coding exons from  TRAF7 ,  NF2 ,  SMO , and the recurrent mutations for AKT1 p.Glu17Lys and KLF4 p.Lys409Gln were created using the TargetRich custom amplicon kit (Kailos Genetics). Sanger sequencing Coding variants detected by whole-exome sequencing or targeted next-generation sequencing were confirmed by Sanger sequencing using standard protocols. Whole-genome genotyping The Illumina Platform was used for WGG and CNV analyses of the samples. Human OmniExpress-12v1.0 BeadChips that contain 733,202 markers were used according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). CNVs were detected by comparing the normalized signal intensity between tumour and matched blood or tumour and the average of all blood samples. Segmentation was performed on log intensity (R) ratios using DNACopy algorithm 53 . Large-scale chromosomal deletion or amplification was defined as affecting more than one-third of the chromosomal arm, whereas focal event deletion or amplification was defined as affecting less than one-third and more than one-tenth of the chromosomal arm with accompanying log ratio of signal intensities <−0.1 or >0.1 and B-allele frequencies (BAF) at heterozygous sites deviating from 0.5 by at least 0.05 units. Large-scale copy neutral LOH was defined similarly, with the exception of log ratio of signal intensities being between 0.1 and 0.1. Percentage of genome alteration (PGA) was defined as the percentage of loss or gain base pairs relative to the entire genome. To identify significantly altered genes we applied Wilcoxon test between atypical and benign tumours using intensity log ratios. Cancer genes were identified based on the COSMIC database 54 . Gene expression data We used Illumina HumanHT12.v4 chips on the gene expression data. Data was normalized using normal-exponential convolution model-based background correction and quantile normalization using the limma R package 55 . All batches were normalized at once after excluding probes with low quality. Samples estimated to have zero proportion of expressed probes, mean signal intensity being less than 5.54, or RIN value <3 were excluded. Hierarchical clustering of the gene expression data showed batch effect in the data. The batch effect was removed using ComBat in sva R package 56 . We performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering based on a Euclidean distance metric and average linking clustering on the probes that showed the top 1,000 most variable gene expression levels. GO term enrichment analysis was performed using the Cytoscape Reactome Plugin. Differentially expressed genes were identified using an empirical Bayesian method ebayes implemented in limma R package 55 . Genes were considered differentially expressed with adjusted  P -value<0.05. Random forest prediction model using gene expression data We used the randomForest R package ( https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/randomForest/index.html ) for building a model to predict the histological grade 57 . We first performed feature selection by identifying the top 25 genes associated with histological grade from differential gene expression analysis. We trained the model on our top 25 differentially expressed genes using randomForest function with ntree=5,000 parameter. Out of bag error rate (OOB), which is the error rate of the trained algorithm on a left out dataset that is not used in trained algorithm, was calculated. We next validated our prediction model on an independent dataset 13 . Raw Affymetrix data of the validation set was processed using the RMA method in affy R package ( https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/manuals/affy/man/affy.pdf ). miRNA sequencing analyses Sequencing was performed on Illumina HiSeq instruments using 75 basepair, single-end reads and multiplexing 8 tumour samples per lane. Adaptor sequences were trimmed using cutadapt 58 . Reads shorter than 18 basepair and reads with quality less than 20 were filtered. Per base quality scores were assessed using FASTX tool. Adaptor trimmed reads were aligned to miRBase using mirDeep2 tool 59 . The set of known human miRNA precursors were downloaded from miRBase version 20 (ref.  60 ). We reported total read counts for 5p and 3p strands. Read counts for each sample were normalized to reads per million reads (RPM) and log 2 -transformed. Batch effect was corrected using ComBat in sva R package 56 . We then performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering based on a Euclidean distance metric and complete linking. Differentially expressed miRNAs were identified using limma R package. An FDR threshold of 0.05 was used. Six algorithms were used for miRNA target prediction: Miranda, Mirbase, Mirtarget2, Pictar, Tarbase and TargetScan using the RmiR.Hs.miRNA R package 61 . Regulatory targets of individual miRNAs were defined as those genes having significant negative correlation with the miRNA (spearman correlation test  P <0.05) and prediction support in at least three databases. GO term enrichment analysis was performed using the GOStats R package 62 . DNA methylation data We performed DNA methylation profiling on 57 tumour samples and 3 control samples using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, which assesses the level of methylation at over 450,000 CpG sites across the entire genome (covering 99% of RefSeq genes and 96% of CpG islands). We first processed raw intensity files (*.idat) and obtained ratio between Illumina methylated probe intensity and total probe intensities (beta-values) using the champ package 63 . Then, we assessed the quality of the methylation samples and probes. Finally batch effect is corrected using combat algorithm in champ R package 63 . Quality control and preprocessing for DNA methylation data We removed sites containing missing values. The probes targeting a CpG with a SNP were also removed from analysis. Probes targeting the X and Y chromosomes were excluded. The sites having at least 50% samples with detection  P -value>0.05 are removed. The detection  P -value is calculated using the reported background signal levels of both the methylated and unmethylated channels. After preprocessing the raw data, we performed beta mixture quantile normalization (BMIQ), a normalization correction for the technical differences between the Type I and Type II array designs 23 . The DNA methylation score for each probe is described as the ratio of intensities between methylated and unmethylated alleles: M/(M+U). Unsupervised clustering for DNA methylation We performed consensus clustering on methylation  b -values with 80% subsampling over 1,000 iterations of hierarchical clustering based on a Pearson correlation distance metric and average linking 64 . Identifying differentially methylated sites Differentially methylated sites were calculated using the empirical bayes method called limma 55 . Sites were considered statistically significantly different between the groups if they had an adjusted  P -value<0.05 and median  b -value difference >0.1 or <(−0.1). We used the GREAT tool, which internally maps genomic regions to genes and statistically controls for the fact that genes differ in size and their relative distance to each other 23 . Raw reads of EZH2 H1hesc ChIP-seq were downloaded from UCSC Genome Browser ENCODE database 65 . EZH2, ChIP-seq peaks were downloaded from Cistrome website 66 . Immunofluorescence staining Meningioma frozen tissue sections were washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) for 5 min, then placed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 3 min (fixation), rinsed in PBS and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton-X100 in PBS for 40 s. The sections were rinsed with PBS 3 times for 5 min each and were incubated in BSDSGS blocking solution (PBS with 1% bovine serum albümin, 5% donkey serum, 5% goat serum, 0.1% glycine, 0.1% lysine) with 0.1% Tween 20. Afterwards, the sections were stained with 1:100 rabbit polyclonal anti-EZH2 antibody (5246P, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA). After washing, the slides were incubated 30 min with 1:200 donkey-anti rabbit Alexa Fluor 555 (A315772, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA). After washing, slides were mounted with Vectashield DAPI medium (H1200, Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA, USA). Images were analyzed under an inverted microscope (Axio Vert A1, Zeiss, Obekochen, Germany) with fluorescent light source (X-Cite 120Q, Lumen Dynamics). H3K27ac and H3K27me3 ChIP-seq Briefly, 10 to 15 frozen sections of each tumour block or dura sample were collected for ChIP-Seq experiments. Tissue was crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde, quenched with glycine, and washed with PBS. Nuclei were extracted by dounce homogenization and resuspended in nuclear lysis buffer containing 0.3% SDS. Chromatin was sheared by sonication with a  Q800R2  Sonicator by QSonica (60 min total, amplitude 30, 10 s pulses, 10 s rest). Soluble chromatin was incubated with magnetic beads coated with either H3K27ac antibody (ab4729) or H3K27me3 antibody (ab6002) overnight at 4 °C. Chromatin was precipitated using a magnet, washed extensively, and eluted with TE+1% SDS. Crosslinks were reversed, purified, and subjected to standard Illumina paired-end multiplexed library construction. H3K27ac and H3K27me3 ChIP and input samples were sequenced for each tumour (1 × 75 bp, HiSeq 2000). H3K27ac and H3K27me3 reads were aligned uniquely with bowtie (0.12.7) 67  to the human genome (hg19). In H3K27ac, regions of enrichment were identified with MACS (v1.4) 68  whereas in H3K27me3, regions of enrichment were identified with MUSIC 69 . We used DiffBind to estimate significance of super-enhancer read change (adjusted  P -value threshold=0.05) between meningioma subtypes 70 . Identifying super-enhancers from ChIP-seq data To identify super-enhancers, first regions enriched in ChIP-seq reads for H3K27ac were identified using MACS with input control. Super-enhancers were separated from typical enhancers using ROSE pipeline ( https://bitbucket.org/young_computation/rose ) with parameters -s (stitching) 12,500, -t (promoter exclusion zone) 2000. We used DiffBind to estimate significance of super-enhancer read change (adjusted  P -value threshold=0.05) between meningioma subtypes 70 . Cancer genes are defined based on COSMIC databases 54 . Data availability All somatic mutations identified through exome sequencing of meningiomas were submitted to the COSMIC database previously 7 . Gene expression data is deposited in GEO database (accession:  GSE84263 ) 7 . Our novel datasets including DNA methylation, miRNA sequencing, H3K27ac and H3K27me3 ChIP-seq are deposited in GEO database (accession:  GSE91376 ).
