  "abstract": "Deletions of NF1 gene and exons detected by multiplex ligation-dependent probe  amplification.  De Luca A(1), Bottillo I, Dasdia MC, Morella A, Lanari V, Bernardini L, Divona  L, Giustini S, Sinibaldi L, Novelli A, Torrente I, Schirinzi A, Dallapiccola B.  Author information: (1)IRCCS-CSS, San Giovanni Rotondo and CSS-Mendel Institute, Rome, Italy.  To estimate the contribution of single and multi-exon NF1 gene copy-number  changes to the NF1 mutation spectrum, we analysed a series of 201 Italian  patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Of these, 138 had previously been  found, using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography or protein  truncation test, to be heterozygous for intragenic NF1 point  mutations/deletions/insertions, and were excluded from this analysis. The  remaining 63 patients were analysed using multiplex ligation-dependent probe  amplification (MLPA), which allows detection of deletions or duplications  encompassing >or=1 NF1 exons, as well as entire gene deletions. MLPA results  were validated using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) or fluorescent in situ  hybridisation. MLPA screening followed by real-time qPCR detected a total of 23  deletions. Of these deletions, six were single exon, eight were multi-exon, and  nine were of the entire NF1 gene. In our series, deletions encompassing >or=1  NF1 exons accounted for approximately 7% (14/201) of the NF1 gene mutation  spectrum, suggesting that screening for these should now be systematically  included in genetic testing of patients with NF1.
