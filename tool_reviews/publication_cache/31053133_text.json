  "title": "Burden of adult neurofibromatosis 1: development and validation of a burden assessment tool.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a common genetic neurocutaneous disease, with an autosomal dominant inheritance mode. Quality of life has been shown impaired in NF1, due to severe complications, cosmetic features, and uncertainty about the disorder. METHODS: This study sought to develop a self-administered questionnaire in French to assess the burden of NF1 (BoN), then translate and linguistically and cross-culturally validate it into American English, standardized methodology applied, as outlined in the report. RESULTS: Based on several discussions with NF1 patients, a 17-item conceptual questionnaire was first produced. Of the 91 NF1 adult patients who responded to the conceptual questionnaire, 65 (64.6% females) were accessible. Subsequent confirmatory analyses generated a 15-item questionnaire grouped into four domains, demonstrating internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha: 091), discriminant validity, and high reliability. The BoN was likewise shown to significantly correlate with other validated questionnaires, such as Dermatology Life Quality Index, Perceived Stress Scale, and SF12 mental score, indicating good external validity. CONCLUSIONS: BoN is a specific tool for assessing the burden that NF1 generates on many practical aspects of the patient daily activities, beyond the notion of quality of life\". Given the increasing relevance that regulatory authorities attribute to patient-reported outcomes, the BoN questionnaire provides such supplementary information while accounting for the burden of NF1 patients in the broadest sense.",

  "methods": "Methods This study sought to develop a self-administered questionnaire in French to assess the burden of NF1 (BoN), then translate and linguistically and cross-culturally validate it into American English, standardized methodology applied, as outlined in the report. Methods The self-administered BoN questionnaire was developed using standard methodology comprising three phases, namely exploratory, development, and validation [ 24 ]. This questionnaire was developed by a multidisciplinary working group comprising experts in questionnaire design/development, such as healthcare professionals like physicians and psychologists, experts in NF1, such as social workers and dermatologists, as well as experts in QoL and patient-reported outcomes. The questionnaire was conventionally created in a question and answer format. Response modalities were determined via consensus among the experts, and took the form of a 6-point Likert scale: \u201cnever\u201d (0), \u201crarely\u201d (1), \u201csometimes\u201d (2), \u201coften\u201d (3), \u201cvery often\u201d (4), and \u201cconstantly\u201d (5). To limit missing data, we also considered a \u201cnot applicable\u201d (0). Instructions in the preamble state that the questions relate to the previous 30\u2009days. Subjects from the age of 15 could complete the questionnaire and had the option to indicate \u201cnot concerned\u201d for non-applicable questions. Exploratory phase The initial step involved several one-to-one interviews between the dermatologist, psychologist, social worker, and expert in patient-reported outcomes with patients suffering from NF1 to comprehensively collect the patients\u2019 perceptions and complaints. By analyzing these interviews, the most relevant concepts were identified. A semi-structured questionnaire was then elaborated comprising specific themes in a question/answer format, including closed-ended questions with a choice of predetermined answers, as well as open-ended questions allowing unrestricted answers. The final choice of questions was made by the working group. Development phase During this phase, the conceptual questionnaire was administered to a sample of subjects suffering from the disease. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted to highlight the underlying constructs, assigning each item to its respective domain, with orthogonal varimax rotation performed to verify whether the hypothetical constructs were interrelated. To evaluate the questionnaire\u2019s internal consistency and confirm its reliability, the item homogeneity in each dimension was tested using Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient [ 25 ]. Higher order factor confirmatory analysis was performed to confirm that the dimensions created could be combined into one single score. PROC CALIS procedure, SAS 9.4, was employed. The criteria for the model\u2019s goodness-of-fit were defined as a Bentler comparative fit index >\u20090.90, and Bentler-Bonett non-normed fit index >\u20090.90 [ 26 ], with root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) close to 0.05 or at the very least less than 0.08. External validity To assess the questionnaire\u2019s external validity, all participants were asked to complete three previously validated self-administered questionnaires: the D ermatology Life Quality Index  [DLQI] questionnaire, The DLQI questionnaire is the first dermatology-specific instrument designed to assess the impact of skin diseases on patient QoL [ 27 ,  28 ]. Intended for adults and patients aged over 16\u2009years, DLQI has proven a simple, practical, and validated questionnaire that grades QoL, the DLQI score being the sum of all scores (0\u201330), with high scores reflecting poor QoL. The PSS is the most widely used psychological instrument for measuring the perception of stress. Composed of 10 items rated from \u201cnever\u201d to \u201coften\u201d, PSS measures the degree to which situations in one\u2019s life are perceived as stressful [ 29 ,  30 ]. The total score ranges from 10 to 50, and the higher the score, the higher the stress. The SF12 is a short version of the SF-36, namely a generic instrument to measure population health [ 31 ], with a physical composite score and mental composite score calculated based on 12 questions, and the higher the score, the better the physical and the mental quality of life, respectively. Concurrent validity was established by calculating Pearson correlations between the BoN and the other three validated questionnaires. The data were analyzed using SAS software Version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA), with the significance level set at 0.05. Test-retest analysis To assess reproducibility, a test-retest analysis was conducted, with a group of subjects asked to complete the questionnaire twice, with at least a 10-day interval in-between. Translation, cross-cultural adaptation, and cognitive debriefing While the original BoN questionnaire was developed in French, previously-validated methodology was applied to generate an US English-language version, involving cross-cultural validation [ 32 ]. The nine steps involved are summarized in Table\u00a0 1 . A number of changes could be implemented throughout the validation process, so as to further improve the initial idiomatic draft.

  "introduction": "Background Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is the most common autosomal dominant neurocutaneous disease, caused by mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene, located in a region on chromosome 17ql1.2 [ 1 ]. This gene encodes a common protein, namely neurofibromin, which is an essential negative regulator of Ras cellular proliferation pathways [ 2 ,  3 ]. Disease prevalence is estimated at 1:2000\u20131:3500 individuals worldwide, yet with wide phenotypical variability [ 4 \u2013 6 ]. The germline NF1 mutation rate proves ten-fold higher than that observed in other inherited disease genes [ 7 ]. Establishing the correct NF1 diagnosis may prove challenging [ 8 ]. NF1 patients are at increased risk of developing various tumors, and their life-expectancy is decreased by 10\u2009years as compared to the general population [ 9 ]. With skin lesions as the most noticeable disease manifestation, NF1 may affect many organs, and psychiatric and psychological disorders are likewise common [ 10 ,  11 ]. Around 20% of patients display dysthymia and 7% depressed mood, with a heightened risk of suicide [ 12 ]. Anxiety and personality disorders are similarly observed, and cognitive disorders may last into adulthood, thereby impacting smooth integration into work [ 13 ]. Quality of life (QoL) was shown impaired in NF1 patients, especially in severe disease cases [ 14 ]. The concept of \u201cburden\u201d has taken a central role in evaluating care [ 15 ], and specifically in case of skin diseases [ 16 ]. In 2010, the World Health Organization first introduced the concept of \u201cGlobal Disease Burden\u201d, particularly useful for quantifying population health and determining action priorities [ 17 ]. The focus has meanwhile been switched to \u201cindividual disease burden\u201d, a concept designed to assess disease \u201cdisability\u201d in the broadest sense, including psychological, social, economic, and physical features. Such individual disease burden was already investigated in skin diseases like psoriasis [ 18 ], infantile hemangioma [ 19 ], hereditary ichthyosis [ 20 ], atopic dermatitis [ 21 ], and vitiligo [ 22 ]. Ferner et al. [ 23 ] have developed a disease-specific questionnaire to measure QOL in people with NF1 (INF1-QOL) that is suitable as an assessment tool in clinical practice and in clinical trials. The aim of our work is to assess the burden and the impact that the NF1 generates on many practical aspects of the patient daily activities in addition to the notion of quality of life. As part of their research activities, the \u201creference centers for rare skin disorders\u201d network has elaborated and validated a French questionnaire designed to assess the burden of NF1 on patients suffering from the condition, termed  B urden  o f  N eurofibromatosis (BoN). This paper describes the different steps involved.",
  "results": "Results Conceptual phase Over the preceding 12\u2009months, the psychologist and co-author conducted discussions with 45 NF1 patients on a one-to-one basis concerning their complaints and distresses. Combined with the work of the social worker, this research resulted in the description of the patients\u2019 perceptions in an initial verbatim. Several one-on-one discussions between dermatologist, psychologist, social worker and expert in patient-reported outcomes contributed to consolidate this initial wording, with eventually 17 items forming the conceptual questionnaire. Development and validation phase Study population Patients were selected with the support of the French association of patients with neurofibromatosis, which proposed the questionnaire to previously diagnosed patients. NF1 is a rare skin disease, and working with the Association Neurofibromatoses et Recklinghausen ensured broad recruitment over the territory to guaranteed a reasonably diversity of patients in terms of geographical location, age and sociological status. Overall, 91 patients were contacted of whom 65 responded to the conceptual questionnaire. Among the respondents, 64.6% were women (Table\u00a0 2 ). Table 2 Description of the study population Men Women n \u00a0=\u200923 (35.38%) n \u00a0=\u200942 (64.62%) Age 48.87 47.12 Live alone 39.13% 28.57% Higher level education 56.52% 42.86% Diagnosis delay, if occurred (years) 10.83 13.28 living in a rural area 30.43% 14.29% living in a mid size city 47.83% 40.48% living in a large size city 17.39% 42.86% The cohort\u2019s mean age was 47.74\u2009years \u00b117.06 (43.47\u201352.00). Some 44.4% of patients stated that they were cohabiting, 59.7% exerted a job, and 21.53% were retired, while 47,69% had been to higher level education. Almost all were covered under the French national health insurance, with 78.7% covered under the chronic conditions scheme. NF1 diagnosis was made by a family physician in 25.9% of cases, a dermatologist in 38.9%, and another specialist in 35.2%. The family physician was involved in managing the disease in 35.4% of cases, and the dermatologist in 75.4%. Altogether, 71.7% of patients stated they were satisfied with their current treatment, and 20% used self-medication. There was no diagnostic delay for 36.9% of the patients. For those who did experience diagnostic delay, the waiting period was long, since 139.9\u2009months (11.65\u2009years) on average separated the first disease signs from definite diagnosis. About one-third of patients (30.8%) were offered psychological treatment, and 16.9% had actually received it. Overall, 67% of the respondents were in contact with a patients association. Internal validity Principal component factor exploratory analysis was performed on the 17-item questionnaire. The correlation matrix was previously generated, and the maximum value was 0.8. For all items, neither the answer \u201cnever\u201d nor the answer \u201calways\u201d exceeded 20%. Standardized regression coefficients were all >\u20090.4 (Additional file  1 : Table S1), and each group of questions was assigned a dimension, with five dimensions as follows (Table\u00a0 3 ): Dimension 1, with five questions on concentration and learning problems; Dimension 2, with five questions on the way others look at them and the anxiety they feel about the future; Dimension 3, with three questions on life with the disease; Dimension 4, with two questions on sexuality; Dimension 5, with two questions on acceptance and pain.

The questionnaire\u2019s uni-dimensionality was confirmed by higher order factor analysis (Additional file  2 : Table S2). The practical goodness-of-fit indices were acceptable, with a Bentler comparative fit index of 0.9521 and a Bentler-Bonett non-normed fit index of 0.9355. The model appears well adjusted and well fitted, offering the possibility to group the four dimensions into one single score. All dimensions were found well correlating with the overall score (Table\u00a0 4 ).

External validity The BoN questionnaire highly correlated with the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and SF12 mental scores (Table\u00a0 5 ). The correlation coefficients between BoN and validated questionnaires were relatively high, confirming BoN\u2019s external validity; the correlation with the SF12 physical score proved the weakest. Table 5 Correlations between the scores Pearson correlation coefficients,  N \u2009=\u200965 Prob > |r| under H0: Rho\u2009=\u20090 DLQI 0.69930 <.0001 PSS 0.72643 <.0001 SF12 -MCS \u22120.57650 <.0001 SF12 -Physical \u22120.26242 0.0347 DLQI D ermatology Life Quality Index , PSS  Perceived Stress Scale,  PCS  Physical Composite Score /SF12,  MCS  Mental Composite Score /SF12 Cognitive debriefing did not result in any major changes to the questions\u2019 wording. Test-retest analysis The test-retest reliability was obtained on 23 evaluable subjects (Day 1 and Day 10), demonstrating good reproducibility. The intraclass correlation of each dimension was >\u20090.85 for each domain. Translation and cultural adaptation The original BoN French version was translated, then linguistically and culturally validated in US English. While the original BoN questionnaire was developed in French, previously validated methodology was applied in order to generate an US English-language version, involving linguistic and cross-cultural validation 21. This rigorous process comprises a meticulous 9-step procedure and was meant to refine the translation while taking into account nuances of the source document. Briefly, source text evaluation from a linguistic and cultural perspective, including a clear definition of various concepts, was first carried out. In a second step, a separate translation of the text into US English by two independent translators was made. A comparison of the two translations with subsequent text optimization aiming to produce a preliminary draft questionnaire was then performed. Further, a back-translation and back-translation review were performed in which retranslation of the draft questionnaire into the original language and comparison of the original questionnaire against the version obtained from back-translation was done to check whether the overall meaning of the reconciled translation matched that of the source document. Afterwards, to allow pilot testing of the questionnaire, an analysis of the back-translation and implementation of the back-translation review report was performed. Finally, before correction and finalization, a review of cognitive debriefing was performed. However, from this US English version, an adequate validation in the US patients is still required. Both versions are presently available (Table\u00a0 6 ).

The total score is obtained by summing up the scores for each of the 15 questions. In our patient cohort, the mean BoN score obtained was 28.42 (\u00b116.87), the mean score for men being 22.48 (\u00b116.47) versus 31.67 (\u00b116.38) for women ( p \u2009<\u20090.001). The Shapiro test of normality for the BoN score provided a  p -value of 0.15, meaning that the hypothesis that the data are normally distributed can-not be rejected. The respondents evaluated disease severity on a visual analog scale between 1 and 5, with 1 being low severity and 5 very high severity. The subjects were divided into three groups, namely low severity (scores of 1 and 2), moderate severity (3), and high severity (4 and 5). The BoN score of the low severity group was 17.6 (\u00b111.9), while that of the moderate severity group was 29.3 (\u00b114.4), and that of the high severity group 45.5 (\u00b118.2), the BoN score differences statistically significant. Table\u00a0 7  compares BoN score evolution according to severity, to the evolution of the other validated scores. Table 7 Scores of validated scales according to severity Severity N PSS DLQI PCS MCS BoN Low 20 24.34 6.58 52.67 45.63 44.55 Moderate 34 25.23 5.44 46.78 44.04 45.70 High 11 31.82 10.73 47.19 40.08 65.73 DLQI  Dermatology Life Quality Index,  PSS  Perceived Stress Scale,  PCS  Physical Composite Score /SF12,  MCS  Mental Composite Score /SF12 The mean BoN score was calculated for subjects who stated that they experienced diagnostic delay versus those who did not. BoN score for patients reporting a diagnostic delay was 30.3 (\u00b115.4) versus 23 (\u00b113.9) for those without, the between-group difference being statistically significant ( p \u2009=\u20090.04).",
  "discussion": "Conclusions The BoN demonstrates feasibility, reliability, and discriminant validity. This instrument can thus be employed to better understand the multidimensional nature of NF1 on the individual burden of adult patients. This tool may similarly have a role to play in the decision-making process.",
