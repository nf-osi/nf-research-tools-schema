  "title": "Cutaneous Neurofibroma Heterogeneity: Factors that Influence Tumor Burden in Neurofibromatosis Type 1.",
  "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 is one of the most common genetic disorders of the nervous system and predisposes patients to develop benign and malignant tumors. Cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs) are NF1-associated benign tumors that affect nearly 100% of patients with NF1. cNFs dramatically reduce patients' QOL owing to their unaesthetic appearance, physical discomfort, and corresponding psychological burden. There is currently no effective drug therapy option, and treatment is restricted to surgical removal. One of the greatest hurdles for cNF management is the variability of clinical expressivity in NF1, resulting in intrapatient and interpatient cNF tumor burden heterogeneity, that is, the variability in the presentation and evolution of these tumors. There is growing evidence that a wide array of factors are involved in the regulation of cNF heterogeneity. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this heterogeneity of cNF at the molecular, cellular, and environmental levels can facilitate the development of innovative and personalized treatment regimens.",
