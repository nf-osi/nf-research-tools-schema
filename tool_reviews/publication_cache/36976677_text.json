  "abstract": "Neurofibromas are benign peripheral nervous system tumors associated with neurofibromatosis type 1, which originate from NF1(-/-) Schwann cell precursors. We describe a protocol to generate neurofibromaspheres by differentiating NF1(-/-) Schwann cells from induced pluripotent stem cells and combining them with neurofibroma primary fibroblasts. We also describe the development of neurofibroma-like tumors when neurofibromaspheres are engrafted in the sciatic nerve of nude mice. This model constitutes a versatile platform for drug screening and the study of neurofibroma biology. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Mazuelas et al. (2022).",
