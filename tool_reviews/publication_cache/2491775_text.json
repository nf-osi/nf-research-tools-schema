Author information: (1)Department of Human Genetics, Collaborative Research, Inc., Bedford, MA  01730.  The genetic locus for neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) has recently been mapped to the  pericentromeric region of chromosome 17. We have genotyped eight previously  identified RFLP probes on 50 NF1 families to determine the placement of the NF1  locus relative to the RFLP loci. Thirty-eight recombination events in the  pericentromeric region were identified, eight involving crossovers between NF1  and loci on either chromosomal arm. Multipoint linkage analysis resulted in the  unique placement of six loci at odds greater than 100:1 in the order of  pter-A10-41-EW301-NF1-EW207-CRI-L581-CRI-L946 -qter. Owing to insufficient  crossovers, three loci--D17Z1, EW206, and EW203--could not be uniquely  localized. In this region female recombination rates were significantly higher  than those of males. These data were part of a joint study aimed at the  localization of both NF1 and tightly linked pericentromeric markers for  chromosome 17.  PMCID: PMC1715471 PMID: 2491775 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",
