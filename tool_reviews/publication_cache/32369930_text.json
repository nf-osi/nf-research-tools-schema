  "title": "Unmasking Intra-tumoral Heterogeneity and Clonal Evolution in NF1-MPNST.",
  "abstract": "Sarcomas are highly aggressive cancers that have a high propensity for metastasis, fail to respond to conventional therapies, and carry a poor 5-year survival rate. This is particularly true for patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), in which 8%-13% of affected individuals will develop a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). Despite continued research, no effective therapies have emerged from recent clinical trials based on preclinical work. One explanation for these failures could be the lack of attention to intra-tumoral heterogeneity. Prior studies have relied on a single sample from these tumors, which may not be representative of all subclones present within the tumor. In the current study, samples were taken from three distinct areas within a single tumor from a patient with an NF1-MPNST. Whole exome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and copy number analysis were performed on each sample. A blood sample was obtained as a germline DNA control. Distinct mutational signatures were identified in different areas of the tumor as well as significant differences in gene expression among the spatially distinct areas, leading to an understanding of the clonal evolution within this patient. These data suggest that multi-regional sampling may be important for driver gene identification and biomarker development in the future.",

Study Approvals Blood and tumor were obtained from an individual diagnosed with NF1 according to established criteria [ 25 ] and treated for a MPNST at Washington University/St. Louis Children\u2019s Hospital NF Clinical Program (St. Louis, MO, USA). The human tumor samples were collected under an approved IRB protocol (#201203042) at Washington University, and the patient was appropriately consented. 2.2. Sample Collection Samples were taken from three distinct areas within a single tumor from a patient with an NF1-MPNST immediately after surgical resection with guidance from a pathologist (SD). While area \u201c1\u201d represented solid, tan homogeneous tumor lacking hemorrhage and/or necrosis, areas \u201c2\u201d and \u201c3\u201d of the tumor grossly appeared necrotic and hemorrhagic respectively. 20 g of tissue was taken from each area. Each area was then divided to be used for RNA extraction, DNA extraction, and slide preparation to analyze the histology. A gross image of the tumor was taken at this time and is shown as  Figure 1 .  2.3. Histology Images of the hematoxylin-eosin sections were taken (20X magnification) using an Olympus BX-51 microscope using an Olympus DP71 digital camera, and DP Controller software. Tumor purity was estimated based on morphologic review of the entire hematoxylin-eosin stained section estimating the number of tumor cells, stromal cells, lymphocytes, and extravasated red blood cells. Two pathologists reviewed these slides independently providing an estimated percentage of total tumors cells per slide. 2.4. Sequencing and Bioinformatics Analysis Whole exome sequencing (WES), RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), and copy number analysis (CNVkit) [ 26 ] were performed on each sample and compared to a blood sample as a germline DNA control. Both Illumina Whole Genome Sequencing (eWGS) of 3 tumor samples and 1 PBMC normal sample, and Illumina RNA Sequencing of the 3 tumor samples were generated from the sampled areas. 2.4.1. Library Construction and Sequencing Each tumor had 2 enriched libraries constructed (n = 6), and the PBMCs had a single enriched library constructed (n = 1). Exome libraries were captured with an IDT exome reagent, then pooled with a WGS library for sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq4000 with at least 1000x coverage. RNA was prepared with a TrueSeq stranded total RNA library kit, then sequenced on an Illumina HISeq4000 with 72M reads per sample. 2.4.2. IDT Exome Sequencing Variant Detection Genomic data were aligned against reference sequence hg38 via BWA-MEM [ 27 ] with Base Quality Score Recalibration (BQSR). Structural variants (SVs) and large indels were detected using manta [ 28 ]. SNVs and small indels were detected using VarScan2 [ 29 ], Strelka2 [ 30 ], MuTect2 [ 31 ], and Pindel [ 32 ] via the somatic pipelines available at  https://github.com/genome/analysis-workflows , which includes best-practice variant filtering and annotation with VEP (Variant Effect Predictor, version 95) [ 33 ]. Manual review was used to remove additional sequencing artifacts. Germline variants and somatic variants reported on variant detecting pipeline were compared to see any intersection of variants. Any intersecting variants were removed from the somatic variant gene list, thus filtering out the germline variants. Common variants with 1000 genome MAF (minor allele frequency) > 0.05 were filtered out. Waterfall somatic variant plots were created with GenVisR [ 34 ] by including somatic variants that occurred in each area. Variants reported on the waterfall plot are most likely to be pathogenic, which is reported via VEP. These variants were not reported as a somatic variant in COSMIC (Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer) [ 35 ] and ClinVar [ 36 ] archive, thus these variants are best classified as variants with unknown significance. In order to predict clinical significance and predictions of the functional effects of these variants, each variant was reviewed on SIFT [ 37 ] and Polyphen [ 38 ]. IMPACT rating was determined by VEP for each non-coding variant. 2.4.3. Copy Number Analysis CNVkit was used to infer and visualize copy number from high-throughput DNA sequencing data. Coverage for each bait position in the exome reagent was calculated, then segments of constant copy number were identified using circular binary segmentation. Data were plotted to provide visualization of CNVs. 2.4.4. Inference of Clonal Phylogeny SciClone [ 39 ] and ClonEvol [ 40 ] were utilized to attempt to perform a phylogeny inference. However, the analysis was complicated by the abundance of copy number-altered regions in these tumors, and these standard algorithms were unable to automatically perform that inference. Manual review of the shared and private single nucleotide variants and large copy number altered areas, though, revealed only one possible phylogeny for this tumor. 2.4.5. RNA Sequence Preprocessing RNA-Sequence (RNA-seq) was trimmed from 3\u2032-end with a minimum quality Phred score of 20 and aligned against hg38\u2014Ensembl Transcripts release 99 via BWA-MEM. Pre/post quality control and full expectation-maximization (EM) quantification were run via Partek \u00ae  Flow \u00ae  [ 41 ]. Gene counts and transcript counts were normalized by CPM (counts per million) by using edgeR [ 42 ] package. Heatmap visualizations were created using gplots [ 43 ] R package (Warnes, G.R. Seattle, WA, USA). 2.4.6. Gene Differential Expression Analysis The gene-specific analysis (GSA) method was used to test for differential expression of genes or transcript between sample regions in Partek \u00ae  Flow \u00ae  [ 44 ]. Differential expressed genes were defined as the following statistic parameters:  p -value <= 0.05; FDR step up <= 0.05; Fold Change < \u22122 or >2. From differentially expressed genes, a GO enrichment test was used to functionally profile this set of genes, to determine which GO terms appear more frequently than would be expected by chance when examining the set of terms annotated to the input genes, each associated with a  p -value. 2.4.7. Pathway Analysis A list of genes in copy number aberrant (CNA) regions was extracted. CNA regions were defined as copy number regions greater than 3 or copy number regions less than 1. For each area, we intersected the list of genes that are located in the CNA regions with the differentially expressed gene list reported in the RNA differential expression analysis ( p -value <= 0.05). PantherDB [ 45 ] was utilized to discover GO terms and pathways that may be affected by these genes.",
