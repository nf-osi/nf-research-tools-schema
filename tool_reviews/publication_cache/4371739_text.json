  "title": "Tumours of the nervous system.",
  "abstract": "Tumours of the nervous system of animals are not as rare as has been commonly believed. In dogs, especially the brachycephalic breeds, these tumours occur as frequently as in man. The tumours are grouped according to tissue of origin as follows: nerve cells, neuroepithelium, glia, peripheral nerves and nerve sheaths, meninges and vessels, the pineal and pituitary glands, and the craniopharyngeal duct. Tumours of the glia are relatively common and are divided into the following types: astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, glioblastoma, spongioblastoma, medulloblastoma, and unclassified gliomas.",
