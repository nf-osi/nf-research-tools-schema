  "abstract": "The loss of Nf1 transiently promotes self-renewal but not tumorigenesis by  neural crest stem cells.

Author information: (1)Center for Stem Cell Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Life Sciences  Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2216, USA.  Neurofibromatosis is caused by the loss of neurofibromin (Nf1), leading to  peripheral nervous system (PNS) tumors, including neurofibromas and malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). A long-standing question has been  whether these tumors arise from neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) or  differentiated glia. Germline or conditional Nf1 deficiency caused a transient  increase in NCSC frequency and self-renewal in most regions of the fetal PNS.  However, Nf1-deficient NCSCs did not persist postnatally in regions of the PNS  that developed tumors and could not form tumors upon transplantation into adult  nerves. Adult P0a-Cre+Nf1(fl/-) mice developed neurofibromas, and  Nf1(+/-)Ink4a/Arf(-/-) and Nf1/p53(+/-) mice developed MPNSTs, but NCSCs did not  persist postnatally in affected locations in these mice. Tumors appeared to  arise from differentiated glia, not NCSCs.  DOI: 10.1016/j.ccr.2008.01.003 PMCID: PMC2566828 PMID: 18242513 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",
