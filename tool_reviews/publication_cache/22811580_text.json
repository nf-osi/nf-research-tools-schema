Author information: (1)Divisions of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Oncology, and  Biomedical Informatics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center,  Cincinnati, USA.  PURPOSE: Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) develop malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST), which are often inoperable and do not  respond well to current chemotherapies or radiation. The goal of this study was  to use comprehensive gene expression analysis to identify novel therapeutic  targets. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Nerve Schwann cells and/or their precursors are the  tumorigenic cell types in MPNST because of the loss of the NF1 gene, which  encodes the RasGAP protein neurofibromin. Therefore, we created a transgenic  mouse model, CNP-HRas12V, expressing constitutively active HRas in Schwann cells  and defined a Ras-induced gene expression signature to drive a Bayesian factor  regression model analysis of differentially expressed genes in mouse and human  neurofibromas and MPNSTs. We tested functional significance of Aurora kinase  overexpression in MPNST in vitro and in vivo using Aurora kinase short hairpin  RNAs (shRNA) and compounds that inhibit Aurora kinase. RESULTS: We identified 2,000 genes with probability of linkage to nerve Ras  signaling of which 339 were significantly differentially expressed in mouse and  human NF1-related tumor samples relative to normal nerves, including Aurora  kinase A (AURKA). AURKA was dramatically overexpressed and genomically amplified  in MPNSTs but not neurofibromas. Aurora kinase shRNAs and Aurora kinase  inhibitors blocked MPNST cell growth in vitro. Furthermore, an AURKA selective  inhibitor, MLN8237, stabilized tumor volume and significantly increased survival  of mice with MPNST xenografts. CONCLUSION: Integrative cross-species transcriptome analyses combined with  preclinical testing has provided an effective method for identifying candidates  for molecular-targeted therapeutics. Blocking Aurora kinases may be a viable  treatment platform for MPNST.  ©2012 AACR.
