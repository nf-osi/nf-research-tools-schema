  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: RASopathies are a group of syndromes showing clinical overlap caused by mutations in genes affecting the RAS-MAPK pathway. Consequent disruption on cellular signaling leads and is driven by phosphoproteome remodeling. However, we still lack a comprehensive picture of the different key players and altered downstream effectors. METHODS: An in silico interactome of RASopathy proteins was generated using pathway enrichment analysis/STRING tool, including identification of main hub proteins. We also integrated phosphoproteomic and immunoblotting studies using previous published information on RASopathy proteins and their neighbors in the context of RASopathy syndromes. Data from Phosphosite database ( www.phosphosite.org ) was collected in order to obtain the potential phosphosites subjected to regulation in the 27 causative RASopathy proteins. We compiled a dataset of dysregulated phosphosites in RASopathies, searched for commonalities between syndromes in harmonized data, and analyzed the role of phosphorylation in the syndromes by the identification of key players between the causative RASopathy proteins and the associated interactome. RESULTS: In this study, we provide a curated data set of 27 causative RASopathy genes, identify up to 511 protein-protein associations using pathway enrichment analysis/STRING tool, and identify 12 nodes as main hub proteins. We found that a large group of proteins contain tyrosine residues and their biological processes include but are not limited to the nervous system. Harmonizing published RASopathy phosphoproteomic and immunoblotting studies we identified a total of 147 phosphosites with increased phosphorylation, whereas 47 have reduced phosphorylation. The PKB signaling pathway is the most represented among the dysregulated phosphoproteins within the RASopathy proteins and their neighbors, followed by phosphoproteins implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation and the MAPK pathway. CONCLUSIONS: This work illustrates the complex network underlying the RASopathies and the potential of phosphoproteomics for dissecting the molecular mechanisms in these syndromes. A combined study of associated genes, their interactome and phosphorylation events in RASopathies, elucidates key players and mechanisms to direct future research, diagnosis and therapeutic windows.",

Methods Generation of a RASopathy proteins interactome STRING ( https://string-db.org/ ) is a database of known and predicted protein–protein interactions. The interactions include direct (physical) and indirect (functional) associations; they stem from computational prediction, from knowledge transfer between organisms, and from interactions aggregated from other (primary) databases. In order to analyze the RASopathy proteins using STRING, we first compiled an updated panel of RASopathy-related genes including 27 RASopathy genes:  A2ML1 ,  BRAF ,  CBL ,  HRAS ,  KAT6B ,  KRAS ,  LZTR1 ,  MAP3K8 ,  MEK1 ,  MEK2 ,  MRAS ,  NF1 ,  NRAS ,  PPP1CB ,  PTPN11 ,  RAF1 ,  RASA1 ,  RASA2 ,  RIT1 ,  RRAS ,  RRAS2 ,  SHOC2 ,  SOS1 ,  SOS2 ,  SPRED1 ,  SPRY1  and  SYNGAP1 ; and 5 extra genes  ANKRD11 ,  FGFR3 ,  MEF2C ,  SHOX  and  SRCAP , that were previously proposed as RASopathy proteins as mentioned in the introduction. The UniProt IDs for all the above 32 proteins were submitted to STRING database under the multiple proteins search. The following basic settings were used to generate a portable network graphic: confidence for the meaning of network edges (line thickness indicates the strength of data support); active interaction sources are based on experiments and databases only; and high confidence (0.700) as the minimum required interactome score. Edges represent protein–protein associations. For the generation of the RASopathy proteins interactome (Fig.  2 A) in STRING “none/query proteins only” and “none” values were used for the 1st and 2nd shell, respectively. These associations are meant to be specific and meaningful (i.e. proteins jointly contribute to a shared function), although this does not necessarily mean they are physically binding each other. Generation of a RASopathy proteins and neighbors interactome An interactome was generated including the above 32 RASopathy proteins and their neighbors. We first downloaded all protein–protein associations for each individual RASopathy protein from STRING (using export your current network protein annotations link) and complemented with those annotated in UniProt database (under the Interaction section, which provides information on interaction(s) with other proteins or protein complexes). Data compilation yielded a total of 765 proteins (Additional file  1 : Tab1), including 511 unique proteins based on UniProt IDs (Additional file  1 : Tab2). Functional annotation of the 511 unique proteins was carried out using DAVID ( https://david.ncifcrf.gov/ ). Analysis of the main hub proteins of the interactome network In order to further analyze relationships within the whole interactome derived from the 32 RASopathy proteins, we used STRING to build a network of the interactions with the above list of 511 unique proteins (Additional file  1 ). The resulting network has a total of 8191 edges representing protein–protein associations. Then, in order to find highly connected nodes within the network, the number of edges for every single node was calculated. We focused our analysis on selected nodes that had a number of interactions greater than 4 times the average of interactions found in the network (mean = 18.4 interactions). Dataset compilation of dysregulated phosphosites in RASopathies We scrutinized all previous phosphoproteomics studies carried out in RASopathies using PubMed with the following keywords: “phosphoproteomics”, “phosphoproteome”, “phosphorylation”, “RASopathy”, “Neurofibromatosis”, “Noonan”,”Leopard”, “cardiofaciocutaneous”, “Legius”, “Costello”, “autism”, “capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome”, “juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia”, “NF1”, “PTPN11”, “RAF1”, “MEK1”, “BRAF”, “KRAS”, “MEK2”, “SPRED1”, HRAS “A2ML1”, “CBL”, “MAP3K8”, “KAT6B”, “RRAS”, “SPRY1”, “SHOC2”, “PPP1CB”, “SYNGAP1”, “RASA1”. Protein phosphorylation level changes associated to RASopathies were compiled from nine phosphoproteomic and twenty-seven immunoblotting studies (Additional file  4 ) [ 15 ,  16 ,  19 ,  21 ,  85 – 87 ,  89 – 94 ,  120 – 138 ]. The sample size, animal model, type of data (quantitative/qualitative) and statistical validation is also included in Additional file  4 . These phosphosites were compiled (Additional file  4 ) and belong to different organisms including human, monkey, rat, mouse and zebrafish. Phosphoproteins in the original organism were correlated to the orthologous human counterpart. UniProt retrieve/ID mapping tool [ 139 ] was used for mouse, rat and monkey proteins, and ZFIN [ 140 ] database was used for zebrafish proteins. The equivalent phosphosites in human were mapped by pairwise comparison of the phosphosite orthologous sequences, using the Phosphosite database [ 141 ]. Each identified dysregulated phosphosite was annotated based on the human UniProt protein name and the phosphorylated residues. Analysis of dysregulated phosphoproteins present in the RASopathy interactome Differential phosphorylation levels were analyzed in the RASopathy interactome. UniProt IDs from the interactome (Additional file  1 ) and from the dataset of dysregulated phosphosites in RASopathies (Additional file  4 ) were crossed. The identified proteins were selected for further analysis. Phosphorylation levels are normalized to the total abundance of each phosphoprotein, providing harmonization of the data between experimental models and organisms. Fold changes in the RASopathy versus control were used to represent dysregulation in each phosphosite, transformed to base 2 logarithm ( log2[fold change] ). A threshold of 1.5 both in upregulation and downregulation was applied to filter out noise in the data. Qualitative data was processed in parallel assigning up- and down-regulation based on original data. R 3.63 [ 142 ] and RStudio 1.2.5042 [ 143 ] were used to generate a heatmap representing fold changes of each phosphosite (R package pheatmap [ 144 ]). Clustering analysis was done in NS and NSML by selecting manually from quantitative data dysregulated phosphoproteins with available information for only NS syndrome, phosphoproteins equally dysregulated in both syndromes and phosphoproteins dissimilarly dysregulated in both syndromes. The analysis of dysregulated phosphoproteins present in the RASopathy interactome presented some limitations. Different models, even when they mimic the same syndrome, may show a different response in terms of phosphorylation changes that may be driven in part, by the different experimental conditions. Therefore, experimental validation is recommended for those less studied phosphoproteins. In terms of statistical validation, some original phosphoproteomic studies [ 89 – 92 ] were done for screening purposes. Most immunoblots data was statistically validated including several biological replicates. These aspects are included in Additional file  4 . Analysis of RASopathy proteins phosphosites We investigated the presence of phosphosites in the 27 confirmed RASopathy proteins using available information in the Phosphosite [ 141 ] database. All phosphosites up to available referenced works demonstrating phosphorylation of amino acids in the human sequence were included, independently of the study on their dysregulation in RASopathies (Additional file  6 ). Classification of the references into high-throughput and low-throughput studies was annotated, but both equally considered. Total number of phosphosites per protein with correlation to the cognate RASopathy syndrome, were represented in a bubble plot using R 3.63 [ 142 ] and RStudio 1.2.5042 [ 143 ] (R package ggplot2). Gene ontology analysis and biological processes The 27 RASopathy proteins (Fig.  3 B) and the 33 dysregulated phosphoproteins in the RASopathy interactome (Fig.  4 B) were annotated for GO terms using PANTHER ( http://www.pantherdb.org/ ) classification system tool. A statistical over-representation test using the human PANTHER GO-Slim Biological Process database was used. All groups were selected attending to its statistical significance (FDR value < 0.01) and according to the most specific subclass on the GO hierarchy term they belong to. Limitations of the study for phosphoproteomics data In its conceptualization, our study compiles information from articles including different models and statistical validations assuming some limitations. MS phosphoproteomics studies were used for screening purposes [ 89 – 92 ], and statistics are limited since no p-value test has been performed. Qualitative data from immunoblots is validated by replication of the experiment and fullfill a p-value threshold of 0.05. Details for each study can be consulted in Additional file  4 .Therefore, we can only suggest herein the impact of phosphorylation changes in RASopathies and key phosphoproteins from a point of view of screening and based in the co-occurrence and relevance considering crossed data.\n",
