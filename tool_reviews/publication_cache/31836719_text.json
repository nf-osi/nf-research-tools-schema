A significant challenge facing rare disease communities is finding a sufficient  quantity and variety of data to develop and test disease-specific hypotheses.  Here we describe an approach to data sharing in which stakeholders from the  neurofibromatosis (NF) research community collaborated to develop a  disease-focused data portal with the goal of supporting scientists within and  outside the community as well as clinicians and patient advocates.
