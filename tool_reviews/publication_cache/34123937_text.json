  "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a rare autosomal dominant disease involving the skin and central nervous system (CNS), and also characterized by skeletal and spinal schwannomas that may cause chronic neurogenic pain. Furthermore, pain in NF1 is underestimated, even though it has an impact on quality of life. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common acquired demyelinating disease that may in later stages present with refractory spasticity, particularly in the lower limbs. Oromucosal cannabinoid sprays are currently available for spasticity treatment in MS, with encouraging results on MS pain, but few data have been reported regarding the use of cannabinoids in NF1. We report the successful treatment of chronic neurogenic pain and spasticity in a patient with co-occurrence of NF1 and MS after a poor response to standard approaches. LEARNING POINTS: Chronic pain is a possible complication of several neurological conditions and may show a poor response to standard drugs, thus affecting quality of life.Oromucosal cannabinoid sprays are routinely used in multiple sclerosis spasticity.Cannabinoids may be also effective against neurogenic pain in neurofibromatosis type 1.",
