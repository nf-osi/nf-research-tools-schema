  "abstract": "PURPOSE: To test the effects of the Relaxation Response Resiliency Program - Neurofibromatosis (3RP-NF), a mind-body resilience program for people with NF, on resilience factors from baseline to post-treatment and 6- and 12-month follow-up. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a fully powered randomized clinical trial (RCT) of 3RP-NF and health education control (HEP-NF). We recruited adults with NF1, NF2, or schwannomatosis who reported stress or difficulty coping with NF symptoms. Both conditions received 8 weekly 90-minute group sessions; 3RP-NF focused on building resilience skills. We measured resilience factors via the Measure of Current Status-A (adaptive coping), Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised (mindfulness), Gratitude Questionnaire-6 (gratitude), Life Orientation Test Optimism Scale (optimism), and Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey (perceived social support) at baseline, post-intervention, and 6- and 12-month follow-up. We used linear mixed models with completely unstructured covariance across up to four repeated measurements (baseline, post-treatment, and 6- and 12-month follow-up) to investigate treatment effects on resilience factors. RESULTS: We enrolled 228 individuals (M CONCLUSION: 3RP-NF showed promise in sustainably improving coping abilities amongst people with NF.

Methods Recruitment and participants We distributed advertisements to people with NF via email listservs through the NF registry within the Children\u2019s Tumor Foundation and through other NF centers worldwide. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) diagnoses of NF1, NF2, or schwannomatosis by a medical professional, (2) age 18 years or older, (3) able to provide informed consent and comply with study procedures, (4) English literacy equivalent to a 6th-grade reading level or above, (5) self-reported stress and difficulties coping with NF symptoms; (6) score of 6 or higher on the Patient Stress Scale-4 items [ 25 ,  26 ]. Exclusion criteria were: (1) severe psychopathologies such as schizophrenia or active substance use that would interfere with study procedures or (2) unwillingness or inability to participate in virtual group sessions. We enrolled participants between October 2017 and January 2021. We conducted groups in a sequence of 2, one intervention and one control. We collected the last follow-up outcome assessment in February 2022. All enrolled participants completed assessment measures at baseline, post-intervention, and at 6- and 12-month follow-up via REDCap [ 27 ], a secure online data collection and management system. A research assistant was available via email to answer any questions. At each timepoint we sent the assessment measures up to three times to each participant and followed up with a phone call if needed. After these attempts, we considered unresponsive participants as lost to follow-up. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Participants provided written informed consent for all procedures and did not receive compensation for participation. We advertised the study as a \u201cStress Management Program\u201d to maintain the single-blind study design. Study staff met with study participants virtually to review consent procedures, inclusionary/exclusionary criteria, and the safety protocol. Measures Adaptive coping We used the Measure of Current Status-A (MOCS-A) to measure adaptive coping [ 28 ]. It is comprised of 13 items with four subscales: relaxation \u2013 the ability to employ relaxation on command; awareness of tension \u2013 the ability to recognize tension and stressful triggers; assertiveness \u2013 the ability to express needs to others; and coping confidence \u2013 the ability to cope confidently and restructure unhelpful thoughts. Items are rated on a scale from 0 (\u201cI cannot do this at all\u201d) to 4 (\u201cI can do this extremely well\u201d) and averaged to create a total score (range: 0\u20134). Higher scores represent greater proficiency in adaptive coping abilities. Mindfulness We used the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised (CAMS-R) to measure dispositional mindfulness (i.e., inclination to act mindfully) [ 29 ]. It is comprised of 12-items rated on a scale from 1 (\u201crarely/not at all\u201d) to 4 (\u201calmost always\u201d) and summed to create a total score (range 12\u201348). Higher scores indicate greater dispositional mindfulness. Gratitude We used the Gratitude Questionnaire (GQ-6) to measure gratitude in daily life [ 30 ]. It is a 6-item measure rated on a scale from 1 (\u201cstrongly disagree\u201d) to 7 (\u201cstrongly agree\u201d). Items are summed to create a total score with higher scores representing greater dispositional gratitude (range: 6\u201342). Optimism We used the Life Orientation Test Optimism Scale (LOT) to measure optimism [ 31 ]. It is an 8-item measure rated on a scale from 0 (\u201cI disagree a lot\u201d) to 4 (\u201cI agree a lot\u201d). Items are summed to generate a total score with higher scores representing greater optimism (range: 0\u201332). Perceived social support We used the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey (MOS) to measure perceived availability of social support [ 32 ]. It is a 19-item measure with four domains: perceived availability of emotional, tangible, affectionate, and positive social interactions. Items are rated on a scale from 1 (\u201cnone of the time\u201d) to 5 (\u201call of the time\u201d) and averaged to create a total score, with higher scores representing greater perceived social support (range: 1\u20135). Intervention and control conditions Both 3RP-NF and HEP-NF have been described in detail [ 33 ]. Briefly, both conditions consisted of 8 weekly 90-minute group sessions. Three clinical psychology trainees delivered program content with supervision from the clinical psychologist who developed 3RP-NF and HEP-NF [ 33 ]. Fidelity to intervention and control were high. Participants in both conditions received a printed or electronic version of a patient manual designed for 6th-grade comprehension level to accommodate learning disabilities and other cognitive difficulties associated with NF. Participants in the 3RP-NF also received a link to pre-recorded practice exercises. 3RP-NF The 3RP-NF program is a comprehensive, multimodal treatment aimed at improving QoL and resilience with NF-specific medical symptoms and NF-related stress. It was adapted from the original 3RP [ 34 ]. The foundation for 3RP-NF is the elicitation of the relaxation response (RR), a state of calm and heightened awareness associated with positive changes in genomic, structural, physiologic, psychological, and functional outcomes [ 35 - 42 ]. 3RP-NF combines elicitation of the RR with evidence-based findings on NF-related stress and symptom management, cognitive behavioral theory, and positive psychology. The three core components of 3RP-NF include: (1) \u201cRelaxation Response-Elicitation,\u201d which teaches 15 relaxation and mindfulness techniques; (2) \u201cAppraisal and Coping,\u201d which teaches adaptive coping skills to manage stress and medical symptoms such as pain, appearance concerns, the uncertainty of NF, and disease burden; and (3) \u201cGrowth Enhancement,\u201d which includes the use of acceptance, problem-solving and positive psychology skills (e.g., gratitude, empathic communication) aimed at fostering adaptation amidst new symptom development and uncertainty of prognosis (i.e., resilience). Each session starts with an RR exercise, followed by a review of previously taught skills, an introduction of a new skill, and ends with a short RR exercise. The final session reviewed all skills with an emphasis on continuing skill practice after the end of the program. Attention control The HEP-NF program was adapted from the original HEP [ 43 ] and NF-specific materials gathered from the Children\u2019s Tumor Foundation website. The program provides educational information on NF-related stress and symptoms, sleep, nutrition, exercise, communication, and health care management. Each session included a review of the previous sessions. The last session also included information on ways to maintain positive changes to health made during the program. Randomization Study staff randomized patients according to a 1:1 ratio within blocks of 12; 6 to 3RP-NF and 6 to HEP-NF, stratified by NF type. Participants were blind as to whether they received the intervention or control. Data analytic strategy We conducted the analysis using SAS version 9.8. Following the intention-to-treat principle, we included all randomized participants in our primary efficacy analyses as randomized. To investigate treatment effects on resilience outcomes, we used a linear mixed model with completely unstructured covariance across up to four repeated measurements (baseline, post-intervention, and 6- and 12-month follow-up). The mixed model considers all available data, including information from participants who did not complete their evaluations and those who were lost to follow-up. Missing data is implicitly imputed by the estimated covariance among repeated measurements. As a result, the model generates unbiased estimates because missing information is predictable from observed assessments. We estimated treatment-dependent differences between 3RP-NF and HEP-NF in changes from baseline to posttreatment (approximately 2 months) and 6- and 12-month follow-up times. We tested these estimations using linear contrasts of least-square means and reported the point estimates with unadjusted 95% confidence intervals (Cis) for MOCS-A, CAMS-R, GQ-6, LOT, and MOS total scores. For the MOCS-A, we also conducted post-hoc tests to examine the above linear contrasts for each of the 4 subscales of relaxation, awareness of tension, assertiveness, and coping confidence. We used a false discovery rate approach to account for Type I error given the number of hypotheses tested in this study [ 44 ].",
