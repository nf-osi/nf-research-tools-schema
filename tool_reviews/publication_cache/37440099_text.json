  "abstract": "PURPOSE: To test the effects of the Relaxation Response Resiliency Program - Neurofibromatosis (3RP-NF), a mind-body resilience program for people with NF, on resilience factors from baseline to post-treatment and 6- and 12-month follow-up. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a fully powered randomized clinical trial (RCT) of 3RP-NF and health education control (HEP-NF). We recruited adults with NF1, NF2, or schwannomatosis who reported stress or difficulty coping with NF symptoms. Both conditions received 8 weekly 90-minute group sessions; 3RP-NF focused on building resilience skills. We measured resilience factors via the Measure of Current Status-A (adaptive coping), Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised (mindfulness), Gratitude Questionnaire-6 (gratitude), Life Orientation Test Optimism Scale (optimism), and Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey (perceived social support) at baseline, post-intervention, and 6- and 12-month follow-up. We used linear mixed models with completely unstructured covariance across up to four repeated measurements (baseline, post-treatment, and 6- and 12-month follow-up) to investigate treatment effects on resilience factors. RESULTS: We enrolled 228 individuals (M CONCLUSION: 3RP-NF showed promise in sustainably improving coping abilities amongst people with NF. TRIAL REGISTRATION INFORMATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03406208. Registration submitted December 6, 2017, first patient enrolled October 2017.",
