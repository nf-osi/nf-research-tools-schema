  "title": "Development of patient reported outcome measures assessing tumor pain intensity and tumor pain interference for individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 and plexiform neurofibromas: qualitative findings.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pain is a common symptom in individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) that often is associated with plexiform neurofibroma (pNF) tumors. To date, no patient-reported outcome measures have been validated specifically to assess pNF-related pain intensity or pain interference in this population. Such measures are sorely needed since pain is being considered as an outcome in clinical trials targeting reduction of pNF. The study aims were to: (1) obtain qualitative information from individuals with NF1 and pNFs about their pain and its measurement and (2) modify existing scales to assess pNF-related pain intensity and pain interference for NF1 clinical trials. METHODS: For this multi-site, qualitative study, 56 individuals (26 children, 6-16 years; 30 adults, 18-68 years) with NF1 and pNF participated in a focus group and/or individual interview about pain intensity and pain interference (concept elicitation) and also provided feedback about existing pain measures (Numeric Rating Scale-11 and Pain Interference Index) assessing these domains (cognitive debriefing). Four additional waves of cognitive debriefing interviews further refined the measures. Qualitative concept elicitation data from transcripts were coded, analyzed using NVivo software, and thematic analysis was conducted using both deductive and inductive techniques. Additional themes and systematic problems and suggestions regarding the measures were gleaned from reviewing the field notes and interview transcriptions generated by the cognitive debriefing sessions. RESULTS: Concept elicitation themes included descriptions of two types of pNF-related pain (chronic and episodic), variability of pain over time, varying ability to recall pain, lack of knowledge of pNFs, and the ways pain interferes with daily activities. Cognitive debriefing themes included information on how to rate pNF-related pain intensity apart from other pain; problems and suggestions regarding the measures included difficulty comprehending some items and preferences for alternative wording and formatting. Based on these qualitative results, the measures' instructions, items, and formatting were modified to create the PAin INtensity Scale for plexiform neurofibromas (PAINS-pNF) and the Pain Interference Index for plexiform neurofibromas (PII-pNF) for administration on a mobile app or web-based platform. CONCLUSIONS: The PAINS-pNF and PII-pNF are promising self-report measures developed using patient engagement to evaluate tumor pain intensity and pain interference in NF1 clinical trials. The second phase of the study to provide reliability, validity, and normative data for individuals with NF1 and pNFs ages 8 years and older is underway.",

Four additional waves of cognitive debriefing interviews further refined the measures. Qualitative concept elicitation data from transcripts were coded, analyzed using NVivo software, and thematic analysis was conducted using both deductive and inductive techniques. Additional themes and systematic problems and suggestions regarding the measures were gleaned from reviewing the field notes and interview transcriptions generated by the cognitive debriefing sessions. Methods Participants and settings Individuals ages \u22655 years with documented NF1, with a pNF (at least 3\u00a0cm on longest diameter by physical exam or 2D MR imaging OR\u2009\u2265\u20093 mL by volumetric MR imaging), and who could understand and speak English were eligible. Participants also needed to report experiencing recent pNF-related pain rated\u2009 \u2265 \u20093 on the 0\u201310 NRS-11 pain intensity scale or report taking prescription pain medication and with recent pNF-related pain rated\u2009 \u2265 \u20091 on the NRS-11. For the first wave of qualitative data collection, participants were recruited across 6 age bands (5\u20137, 8\u201311, 12\u201314, 15\u201319, 18\u201324, 25+) from four sites: National Cancer Institute (lead), University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine, Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital and Medical Center, and Children\u2019s National Hospital. Subsequent waves recruited individuals ages\u2009 \u2265 \u20098 years with Waves 3\u20135 completed at the National Cancer Institute due to COVID-19. The protocol ( NCT02544022 ) was approved by each site\u2019s Institutional Review Board. Age-appropriate informed consent and/or assent was obtained for all participants. Measures NRS-11.  The self-report NRS-11 has been used in numerous studies, including as a primary outcome measure, to assess pain intensity. This reliable and valid measure has been recommended for use in clinical trials by consensus groups and pain experts [ 11 \u2013 13 ] and for individuals\u2009 \u2265 \u20098 years [ 14 ]. For this 0\u201310 scale (0\u2009=\u2009no pain), the descriptions for a score of 10 vary widely across clinical practice and research studies [ 15 ]; thus, the investigators initially chose the commonly-used phrase \u201cworst pain you can imagine.\u201d They also generated initial pain questions based on clinical judgement and consultation with NF1 experts: Participants were asked to identify a pNF tumor and rate (1) the pain in that tumor at its worst, (2) their \u201coverall tumor pain\u201d at its worst, and (3) their \u201coverall pain\u201d at its worst \u2013 each over the past 7 days (Supplement 1). PII.  The PII is a 6-item questionnaire developed to assess the extent to which pain interferes with six different aspects of daily functioning on a 7-point Likert-type scale from 0 (not at all) to 6 (completely). The PII is a reliable, valid, feasible measure for chronically ill youth and adults, including those with NF1 [ 8 ] (Martin, personal communication, 2023). Participants completed either the child or adult self-report form (Supplement 2 and 3).",
