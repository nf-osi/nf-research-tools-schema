  "methods": "MATERIALS AND METHODS Experimental animals Nf1 ; flox/flox PostnCre  mice were used for in vivo studies, with genotypes confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as previously described ( + ,  46 ).  47 Hoxb7-Cre;Nf1  mice were previously described ( flox/flox ), and  48 Tgf-β1  overexpression mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (strain no. 018393). Animal care and experiments were conducted according to the guidelines established by the Indiana University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC; protocol no. 21009) and the University of Texas (UT) Southwestern IACUC (protocol no. 2017-102108). TGFβRI inhibition in experimental mice Age- and gender-matched 3- to 4-month-old  Nf1  mice were randomized to be treated with either the vehicle (1% carboxymethylcellulose in distilled water + 0.25% Tween 80 + 0.05% antifoam) or galunisertib (75 mg/kg BID) by oral gavage for a duration of 12 weeks. Mice were then euthanized to evaluate PNF burden as outlined below. flox/flox ;PostnCre + Pharmacokinetics of galunisertib in mice Following procedures previously described ( ), galunisertib was quantified from plasma using sorafenib as the internal standard and high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS; 5500 QTRAP, AB Sciex, Framingham, MA). Briefly, galunisertib and sorafenib were separated by a gradient mobile phase (acetonitrile: 5 mM ammonium acetate in water) using an Agilent Zorbax XDB-C8, 50 × 4.6 mm, 5-μm column. The mass spectrometer used an electrospray ionization probe run in positive mode. The multiple reaction monitoring Q1/Q3 (mass/charge ratio) transitions for galunisertib and sorafenib were 370.6/337.1 and 464.8/252.0, respectively. Plasma samples (20 μl) were transferred to glass culture tubes, sorafenib was added as the internal standard (20 μl of 0.1 ng/μl), and the extraction was performed by the addition of ethyl acetate (2 ml). The samples were then vortex mixed for 20 s and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 3 min and then the organic layer was transferred to a clean glass culture tube and evaporated to dryness. The samples were then reconstituted with mobile phase (50 μl), and an aliquot (10 μl) was injected into the HPLC-MS. The standard curve was prepared using naïve mouse plasma as the matched matrix and was linear from 1 to 10,000 ng/ml. 49 Galunisertib was quantified from tissue samples using a slightly modified method from the plasma sample analysis as detailed previously ( ). Briefly, the tissue was weighed and then transferred to a glass culture tube. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was added to the tissue to bring the total volume to 0.5 ml (assumption: 1 g = 1 ml). The tissue was homogenized using a TissueRuptor with a single-use disposable probe. An aliquot (0.4 ml) was transferred to a clean glass culture tube, and sorafenib was added as the internal standard (20 μl of 0.1 ng/μl). The extraction procedure and HPLC-MS conditions were the same as for the plasma samples. The standard curve was prepared using PBS as the matrix and was linear from 0.04 to 400 ng per sample. 49 Nerve microdissection Immediately postmortem, tumor-bearing nerve tissues from galunisertib and vehicle-treated mice were harvested and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Whole–spinal cord dissection was performed as previously described ( ). Tissues were decalcified in 5% formic acid. Proximal spinal nerves, brachial, and trigeminal nerves were dissected microscopically. 48 Histopathology Paraffin sections were stained with H&E and Masson’s trichrome to examine tumor histomorphology. Whole-slide images were acquired on an Aperio ScanScope CS2. Masson’s trichrome stain was used to identify collagen abundance using HALO image analysis software (Indica Labs, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA). The HALO area quantification algorithm was tuned to identify collagen-stained (blue) regions [RGB optical density (OD): 0.674, 0.699, and 0.335 with minimum threshold OD: 0.323, 0.5221, and 0.6991] and nuclear/cytoplasmic (red) regions (RGB OD: 0.493, 0.944, and 0.708). A tissue classifier was set at a resolution of 0.65 μm per pixel to exclude blank regions from analysis. Investigators were blinded to the treatment groups during analysis. IHC staining IHC staining for TGFβ1 was performed on a 5-μm-thick tissue from a peripheral nerve tumor tissue microarray (SO1001b, TissueArray). The tissue microarray was deparaffinized, hydrated, and transferred to 0.1 M EDTA (pH 9.0) for antigen retrieval in a pressure cooker. The tissue microarray was then treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min, rinsed, and incubated with primary antibodies for 30 min at room temperature (TGFβ1; ab215715, Abcam; 1:100) diluted in TBST. Incubation with secondary antibody was performed for 30 min at room temperature (goat anti-rabbit; ab205718, Abcam; 1:1000), followed by Vectastain DAB, which was applied for 10 min and terminated by rinsing in distilled water. Counterstaining was performed with modified Mayer’s hematoxylin (Vector), and the tissue microarray was dehydrated, cleared, and cover slipped. Slide images were acquired on an Aperio ScanScope CS at 20× magnification. Quantitative analysis of TGFβ1 staining was performed on  n  = 8 normal nerve and  n  = 8 neurofibroma samples using HALO image analysis software (version 2.0.5; Indica Labs) using the Area Quantification version 2.4.9, with analysis settings optimized for TGFβ1. Normal nerve specimens that delaminated from the slide during the staining procedure were excluded from analysis. Staining intensity was scored as negative (0), weakly positive (1+), moderately positive (2+), or strongly positive (3+). The area of TGFβ1-positive staining tissue (1 to 3+) was normalized to the total tissue area. Western blot Isolated proteins were fractionated using NuPAGE 4 to 12% bis-tris gels (Invitrogen) and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes according to procedures previously described ( ). Immunoblots were carried out using antibodies specific to p-SMAD2 (Ser 49 465/467 ) (#CST-3108, Cell Signaling Technology), pERK1/2 (Thr 202 /Tyr 204 ) (#CST-9101, Cell Signaling Technology), p-AKT (Ser 473 ) (#CST-4060, Cell Signaling Technology), p-SMAD3 (Ser 423/425 ) (#ab52903, Abcam), actin (A5441, Sigma-Aldrich), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (#CST-5174, Cell Signaling Technology), LAMB1 (#PA5-27271, Thermo Fisher Scientific), LAMC (#PA5-79579, Thermo Fisher Scientific), NID1 (ab254325, AbCam), and TGFβ (#NBP1-03276, Novus Biologicals; #sc-130348, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After incubation with appropriate horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies [anti-rabbit (#NA934V, GE Healthcare)], signals were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) substrate (ECL Prime, GE Healthcare). Densitometric quantitation of protein bands on images of membranes was conducted using the iBright system’s (Thermo Fisher Scientific) onboard software. BM protein mass spectrometry Mouse DRGs extracted from  Nf1  PNF-bearing mice treated with vehicle ( flox/flox ;PostnCre + n  = 3) or galunisertib ( n  = 3) were collected and lysed with the CNMCS Compartmental Protein Extraction Kit (2145, MilliporeSigma) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and subjected to mass spectrometry assay as our previous report ( ). The mass spectrometry assay was done by the Proteomics Core at the UT Southwestern Medical Center. The data were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer 2.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The total protein abundance for the vehicle and galunisertib group was determined by summing all proteins with more than 10 peptide spectrum matches. For each target protein, its abundance was normalized to the total protein abundance, yielding an abundance ratio (protein × ratio = protein × abundance/total protein abundance). These abundance ratios were then compared between vehicle and galunisertib groups. Statistical significance was assessed using a Student’s  10 t  test, with a  P  value of less than 0.05 considered significant. The mass spectrometry analysis of BM protein in PNF [ Hoxb7-Cre Nf1  mice ( fl/− H7;Nf1mut )] and control dorsal root ganglion tissue ( Hoxb7-Cre Nf1 ) was adapted from our previous work ( fl/fl ). 10 Bulk RNA-seq and analysis A QIAGEN RNeasy Plus Mini Kit was used to extract total RNA from flash-frozen PNF-bearing trigeminal nerve tissues of  Nf1  mice and wild-type (WT) ( flox/flox ;PostnCre + PostnCre ) controls. RNA quantity and quality were evaluated using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. Total RNA (800 ng) was used as an input for cDNA library preparation using a KAPA Stranded RNA-Seq Kit (Roche) with 10 cycles of amplification. FastQC-passed reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome (mm10) using STAR 2.4.2a ( − ), and reads were translated to transcriptome coordinates using Salmon 0.60 ( 50 ). Isoform data were collated to single-gene IDs using biomaRt, and abundance estimates were upper quartile normalized. Gene values were filtered to include only those with 10 or more reads in at least one sample. Differential gene expression analysis was conducted using DESeq2 ( 51 ) on counts data, while log 52 2  ( x  + 4)–transformed counts per million data were used for bar plot visualizations. Log 2  fold change ratios, Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted  P  values, and gene IDs from DESeq2 were used as inputs for IPA. Core gene expression analysis was performed using the differentially expressed genes determined by the significance cutoff  P  adj < 0.05. Network analysis used experimentally observed direct and indirect relationships from all available tissue and cell line sources in  Mus musculus  within the Ingenuity Knowledge Base. scRNA-seq analysis PNF-bearing sciatic nerve tissues pooled from five 11-month-old  Nf1  mice were harvested, flash frozen at −80°C, and shipped on dry ice to Novogene for single-nucleus capture, library preparation, and sequencing. Single-nucleus suspensions were loaded onto Chromium chips (10x Genomics) for 3′ library preparation according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Library quality control was performed by Qubit 2.0 for preliminary determination of the library concentration, Agilent 2100 to determine the insert size, and quantitative real-time fluorescence PCR to precisely quantify the library effective concentration. The resulting library was sequenced on an Illumina sequencing platform at a depth of 106,831 mean reads per cell across an estimated 6881 cells with 24,062 total genes detected and a median of 1654 genes per cell. FASTQ files were processed with CellRanger software (v.7.0.0; 10x Genomics) with default parameters. Reads were aligned against the mouse reference assembly (mm10) with the STAR aligner. Mapped, non-PCR duplicates with valid barcodes and unique molecular identifiers were filtered to generate a gene-barcode matrix for downstream analysis in scanpy. Low-quality cells with less than 200 genes, genes expressed in less than three cells, and outlier cells with less than the 2nd percentile or greater than the 98th percentile of the number of genes detected, or greater than 5% mitochondrial reads, were excluded. Normalization was performed with count depth scaling to 10,000 reads per cell, followed by log flox/flox ;PostnCre + 1 P  transformation. The top 2000 variable features were selected for dimensional reduction. Linear regression was used to regress out unwanted sources of variation including total counts and the percentage of mitochondrial reads. Data were scaled to unit variance before dimensional reduction by principal components analysis (PCA). Nearest neighbors connectivity and distance matrices were computed using the top 30 principal components, followed by UMAP with Leiden-based clustering at default resolution for visualization in two dimensions. The decoupleR package was used to identify the top five predicted cell types for each cluster against canonical mouse cell-type markers obtained from the PanglaoDB database. Final annotations were manually assigned following a detailed review of the enrichment results. UMAP plots, heatmaps, and dot plots of gene expression across clusters were generated in scanpy under default settings. TGFβ pathway activation scores were computed for each cell in the snRNA-seq dataset using decoupleR ( ), which uses multivariate linear modeling and a compendium of pathways, target genes, and interaction weights contained within the PROGENy database ( 53 ). For each cell, a linear model was generated to predict the observed pattern of gene expression based on pathway-target interaction weights. A pathway activity score was estimated from the  16 t  value, or slope of the fitted model in each cell, whereby higher  t  values indicate stronger activity of the pathway in influencing target gene expression. Fresh human PNF tissue was obtained with verbal and written informed consent under Institutional Review Board approval (#1501467439) following a clinically indicated surgical resection. The tissue was minced into 1-mm 3  pieces and placed into dissociation medium containing equal proportions of collagenase type I and trypsin, followed by incubation for 40 min at 37°C with gentle agitation. The dissociation reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 ml of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Following centrifugation at 800 g  for 5 min, supernatants were passed through a 40-μm cell strainer and transferred to a MidiMACS Separator column containing Myelin Removal Beads (Miltenyi Biotec) to remove myelin debris. Following an additional centrifugation and washing step with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of 90% FBS/10% dimethyl sulfoxide for cryopreservation, slowly frozen to −80°C for storage, and shipped on dry ice to GENEWIZ (Azenta Life Sciences) for single-cell capture, library preparation, and sequencing. Upon thawing of cryopreserved cell suspensions, a round of dead cell removal was performed to enrich for live cells before single-cell partitioning using the Chromium Single Cell 3′ Reagent version 2 Kit (10x Genomics). Gel Bead-in-Emulsions were then subjected to reverse transcription to generate barcoded RNA before cleanup and cDNA amplification. Libraries were sequenced to a depth of 80,482 reads per cell across an estimated 6639 cells with 22,268 total genes detected and a median of 1670 genes detected per cell. Demultiplexed FASTQ files were aligned to the human reference assembly (GRCh38) using the CellRanger pipeline v3.1.0 ( ). 54 The filtered feature-barcode matrix was passed to Seurat v4.0 ( ) for downstream analysis in R. Cells with <400 or >3000 features were filtered to exclude empty droplets and doublets, respectively. Low-quality or dying cells were further excluded by filtering cells with greater than 10% of total reads mapping to mitochondrial genes. Data were then log normalized using a scale factor of 10,000, and the top 2000 variable features were identified using the variance-stabilizing transformation method. Scaled gene expression values were used to perform linear dimensionality reduction using PCA. An elbow plot was used to determine an appropriate dimensionality of 20 principal components for graph-based cell clustering using UMAP at a resolution of 0.1. The FindAllMarkers function was used to identify differentially expressed features for each cluster compared to all others, testing only genes detected at a minimum fraction of 10% in either of the two cell populations and a log 55 2  fold change threshold of at least 0.25. Lists of differentially expressed genes with a log 2  fold change of ≥1 were used as input to Enrichr ( ) for overrepresentation analysis against the PanglaoDB Augmented 2021 ( 56 ) database for cell-type identification and annotation. 57 NicheNet analysis was performed on the Seurat object containing the human PNF single-cell expression data to predict which ligands from the microenvironment or cell populations (senders) are most likely to influence target gene expression in interacting (receiver) cells. Analysis was conducted in both sender-agnostic and sender-focused approaches. The sender-agnostic approach considers all ligands for which the target receptor is expressed in the receiver population, whereas the sender-focused approach considers only those ligands expressed in discrete sender cell types. Schwann cells were defined as the receiver population, whereas all other identified cell types (Fbs, ECs, pericytes, and T cells) were considered in the sender-focused analysis. The gene set of interest was defined as the differentially expressed genes within the receiver cell type with an absolute value log 2  fold change of ≥1 and adjusted  P  values of ≤ 0.05 relative to all other cell types present in the dataset. Background genes were defined as all expressed genes in the receiver cell population. The 30 top-ranked ligands based on area under the precision-recall curve were used to predict active target genes and construct a putative ligand-receptor network. The top 100 target genes for each ligand within the gene set of interest, ranked on the basis of interaction weights, were selected for downstream visualization. Similarly, receptors with the highest interaction weights with top-ranked ligands were selected for ligand-receptor network visualization. Integration of human scRNA-seq data scRNA-seq data from our study were integrated with publicly available single-cell transcriptomic datasets from additional human neurofibroma samples [GSE179043 ( ) and GSE181985 ( 58 )]. 10x Genomics h5 and mtx files were converted to AnnData (.h5ad) format and concatenated. Quality control was performed, retaining only cells with at least 100 genes and only genes that were detected in at least three cells. Predicted doublets were removed using scrublet ( 18 ). Cells with high mitochondrial gene expression (pct_counts_mt > 10%) and high ribosomal RNA gene expression (pct_counts_ribo > 35%) were also excluded. Batch effects were addressed by generating mappings between sample identifiers and additional batch covariates including “dataset” (GSE179043, GSE181985, and this study) and “tumor,” given that GSE181985 contains multiple 10× sequencing runs conducted on single-cell suspensions derived from the same tumor. 59 Raw counts were preserved in the AnnData “counts” layer. Total count normalization (target sum = 1 × 10 4 ) and log 1 P  transformation were applied. The top 10,000 highly variable genes were identified using the Seurat v3 algorithm, accounting for batch effects across each sample. An scVI model ( ) was trained for 400 epochs on the raw counts data, incorporating batch effects (“sample,” “tumor,” and “dataset”) and continuous covariates (“pct_counts_mt” and “pct_counts_ribo”). 60 A nearest-neighbor graph was constructed using a local neighborhood size of 80. Dimensionality reduction was performed using UMAP on both the original and scVI latent spaces with a minimum distance of 0.3 between embedded points. Leiden clustering (resolution = 1) was applied to the UMAP embedding to identify cell clusters. Cell-type enrichment analysis was performed using the decoupleR package ( ). The PanglaoDB database ( 53 ) was filtered to include only high-confidence human markers (human, canonical_marker, and human_sensitivity > 0.5), removing duplicates. Overrepresentation analysis was performed using the filtered marker database and the AnnData object. The top five enriched cell types per cluster, based on activity scores, were identified and used, in conjunction with manual annotation, for final cell-type assignment. TGFβ pathway activation scores were computed as described above. Heatmaps of marker genes and UMAP plots of  57 LAMB1  and  NID1  expression were generated in scanpy. Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism v9.2 software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA) or using the ggpubr package in R using the stat_compare_means() function. Unpaired Welch’s  t  tests or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Šidák’s multiple comparisons test was used to evaluate for statistically significant differences between groups as described in the accompanying figure legends. Adjusted  P  values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. One outlier value in TGFβ1-stained normal nerve was excluded following a Grubb’s test ( P  < 0.01) as specified in the fig. S1 legend. Supplementary Materials This PDF file includes: Figs.

  "introduction": "INTRODUCTION Plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) are complex, benign tumors composed of Schwann cells, immune cells, Fbs, and other perineural cells embedded in the extracellular matrix (ECM) ( ). They are a hallmark feature and primary source of morbidity for patients affected by neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a cancer predisposition syndrome caused by a mutation of the  1 NF1  tumor suppressor gene encoding neurofibromin, a guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activating protein (GAP) for p21 Ras  (RAS) ( ,  2 ). While mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK) inhibitors and other kinase-targeted therapies have demonstrated antitumor activity in a subset of PNF, there remain a substantial proportion of individuals who do not respond to currently available therapies or experience intolerable side effects ( 3 – 4 ). Thus, there remains an unmet need to identify therapeutic agents with improved tolerability and efficacy in treating NF1-associated PNF. 8 Fbs and secreted ECM are major constituents of neurofibromas that account for up to 50% of the tumor dry weight and provide a lattice for tumor invasion ( ). However, until recently, the composition of the PNF ECM was poorly defined. Recent work by our group identified basement membrane (BM) proteins as primary constituents of the PNF ECM ( 9 ). ECM proteomic studies further revealed that BM proteins accumulate during PNF development but are reduced in response to MEK inhibitor (MEKi) treatment ( 10 ). Notably, this MEKi-dependent reduction of BM proteins was associated with attenuation of transforming growth factor–β (TGFβ)–dependent signaling. Work from prior decades demonstrated that TGFβ promotes multiple gains of function in  10 Nf1  Fbs ( +/− ) and underpins the pathogenesis of NF1-associated osseous manifestations including reduced bone mineral density and pseudarthrosis ( 11 ). However, the functional consequences of TGFβ signaling in governing PNF growth and ECM remodeling have yet to be interrogated experimentally. 12 Here, we show that both murine and human PNFs are characterized by hyperactivation of TGFβ-dependent signaling. Using computational modeling to define ligand-receptor intracellular communication networks and map TGFβ pathway activity and ECM transcript expression in single-cell transcriptomic datasets from both mouse and human PNFs, we show that both PNF-associated Fbs and neoplastic Schwann cells exhibit evidence of enhanced TGFβ-dependent signaling and up-regulation of BM-associated proteins. Furthermore, we show that conditional overexpression of TGFβ1 in  Nf1 -deficient Schwann cells driven by  Hoxb7 -Cre promotes PNF growth and malignant transformation. In contrast, pharmacologic inhibition of the type I TGFβ receptor (TGFβRI) exhibits antitumor activity against PNF in  Nf1  mutant mice. ECM proteomic studies further demonstrated reduced BM proteins, including laminin B1 (LAMB1) and nidogen 1 (NID1), in PNF in vivo following TGFβRI inhibition. Collectively, these data implicate TGFβ as a putative therapeutic target in PNF and provide insights into the role of TGFβ signaling within the PNF microenvironment.",
  "results": "RESULTS Enhanced TGFβ-dependent signaling in PNF Hyperactive RAS-MAPK–dependent signaling is recognized as a critical mediator of PNF development. However, the functional landscape of other RAS-MAPK–independent effector pathways contributing to PNF initiation and progression remains poorly defined. To elucidate key signaling networks underpinning PNF pathogenesis, we performed a systematic transcriptomic characterization of murine and human PNF at both bulk and single-cell resolutions. Bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of PNF arising in  Nf1  mice revealed distinctive global gene expression patterns in PNF-bearing nerve tissues compared to normal controls ( flox/flox ;PostnCre + Fig. 1A ). Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was conducted to predict key regulatory nodes orchestrating the observed gene expression changes. Upstream regulator analysis identified TGFβ1, TGFβ, and SMAD3 to be among the top activated regulatory nodes in trigeminal nerve tissue from  Nf1  mice ( flox/flox ;PostnCre + Fig. 1B ). In addition, multiple other TGFβ-associated upstream regulators exhibited positive activation  z  scores including TGFβRII, SMAD4, TGFβ2, TGFβ3, SMAD2, and TGFβRI. In contrast, SMAD7 exhibited a strong negative activation  z  score, consistent with disinhibition of the TGFβ/SMAD pathway in murine PNF ( Fig. 1C ). Given prior evidence implicating TGFβ signaling in  Nf1  Fb dysregulation ( +/− ), aberrant ECM remodeling, and other NF1-associated pathologies including osseous manifestations ( 11 ), we therefore prioritized further investigation of TGFβ’s role in PNF pathogenesis. 12 Fig. 1. TGFβ is a key upstream regulator in murine PNF. ( A ) Principal components analysis (PCA) of bulk RNA-seq data from PNF-bearing  Nf1  nerve tissue and normal control nerve from wild-type (WT) ( flox/flox ;PostnCre + Nf1 ) mice ( flox/flox ;PostnCre – n  = 6 per group). ( B ) Top 20 upstream regulators with positive activation  z  scores in PNF-bearing nerve tissue in comparison to normal control ( n  = 6 per group). Nodes are ranked by activation  z  score; node size reflects the –log 10 -adjusted  P  ( P  adj) value (range: 1.2 to 22.3). Nodes related to TGFβ signaling are highlighted in red text and blue dots. IL-1β, interleukin-1β; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; STAT1, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1. ( C ) Key components of the canonical TGFβ signaling pathway are shown, including ligands (TGFβ1, 2, and 3), receptors (TGFβRI and II), and SMAD effectors (SMAD2, 3, 4, and 7). Nodes are ranked by activation  z  score, with blue nodes indicating positive and red nodes (SMAD7) indicating negative activation. Node size reflects –log 10 -adjusted  P  value (range: 4.3 to 19.9). ( D ) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) reveals enrichment of a TGFβRI-activated mutant mouse gene signature in PNF-bearing nerve tissue from  Nf1  mice compared to WT controls ( flox/flox ;PostnCre n  = 6 per group). Black bars indicate the rank of individual genes comprising the signature. The green curve corresponds to the running enrichment score ( q  = 1.71 × 10 –3 ). ( E ) Box-and-whisker plots show  Col1a1 ,  Col3a1 , and  Mmp2  transcript expression from RNA-seq data in murine PNF versus normal nerve ( n  = 6 per group). Dots represent individual samples. Whiskers extend to 1.5× the interquartile range. The center line represents the median. The box spans the 25th to 75th percentiles. Outliers are plotted as individual points beyond the whiskers.  P  values indicate unpaired, two-tailed  t  tests between groups. Mice harboring an R244Q activating point mutation in the  Tgfbr1  gene exhibit enhanced TGFβ signaling activity ( ). Using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), we compared a signature of genes found to be up-regulated in the  13 Tgfbr1  active mutant and observed them to be similarly enriched in murine PNF ( Fig. 1D ). Among these genes,  Mmp2 ,  Col1a1 , and  Col3a1  are recognized as direct targets of TGFβ-dependent transcription ( ,  14 ) and were robustly expressed in murine PNF compared to normal nerve ( 15 Fig. 1E ). We sought to further characterize the landscape of TGFβ-dependent signaling in PNF at a single-cell level by performing single nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) on PNF arising in  Nf1  mice. A total of 17 clusters emerged ( flox/flox ;PostnCre + Fig. 2A ) corresponding to promyelinating Schwann cells (pmSCs), myelinating Schwann cells (mSCs), nonmyelinating Schwann cells (nmSCs), profibrotic Schwann cells (SC-Fb), fibroblasts (Fbs), glial cells, perineurial cells (PnCs), endothelial cells (ECs), pericytes/vascular smooth muscle cells (peri/VSMCs), and macrophages ( Fig. 2B ), which were identified on the basis of the expression pattern of associated marker genes ( Fig. 2C ).  Tgfb1 , encoding the TGFβ1 ligand, was predominantly expressed in macrophages and, to a lesser extent, SC-Fb, whereas  Tgfb2  and  Tgfb3  were most highly expressed in peri/VSMCs and, to a lesser degree, glial cells, ECs, Fb, and SC-Fb. TGFβ receptors ( Tgfbr1 ,  2 , and  3 ) were expressed broadly throughout most cell types within PNF, with  Tgfbr1  predominating in macrophages and, to a lesser extent, SC-Fb, mSC, and Fb ( Fig. 2D ). Using Pathway RespOnsive GENes for activity inference (PROGENy)—a curated collection of pathways, target genes, and interaction weights ( )—we further used multivariate linear modeling to infer pathway enrichment scores for TGFβ signaling in our single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) dataset. Projection of the enrichment scores over uniform manifold approximation projection (UMAP)–based clustering revealed enhanced TGFβ pathway activation in Fbs and multiple Schwann cell populations ( 16 Fig. 2E ). As opposed to collagen, which represents the principal ECM component in many profibrotic disease states ( ), our previous work identified BM proteins including LAMB1 and NID1 to be predominant constituents of the PNF ECM ( 17 ). Here, we show that  10 Lamb1  and  Nid1  expression localizes to both Schwann cells and Fbs with elevated TGFβ pathway activation scores ( Fig. 2, F and G ). Collectively, these data implicate TGFβ signaling in governing PNF pathogenesis through the production of BM proteins. Fig. 2. Schwann cells and Fbs exhibit enhanced TGFβ pathway activity and up-regulation of BM proteins in murine PNF. UMAP plots showing distinct clusters ( A ) and cell types ( B ) detected in PNF from  Nf1  mice using snRNA-seq ( flox/flox ;PostnCre + n  = 6604 cells pooled from five independent mice). Cell types are abbreviated as follows: pmSCs, mSCs, nmSCs, SC-Fb, Fb, glial cells, PnCs, ECs, peri/VSMCs, and macrophages. ( C ) Heatmap of top marker genes for each cluster. ( D ) Dot plots of TGFβ ligand ( Tgfb1 ,  Tgfb2 , and  Tgfb3 ) and receptor ( Tgfb1 ,  Tgfb2 , and  Tgfb3 ) expression by cell type. UMAP plots of TGFβ pathway activation score ( E ),  Lamb1  ( F ), and  Nid1  ( G ) expression. To determine whether similar evidence of enhanced TGFβ transcriptional activity could be found in human PNF, we performed scRNA-seq on a large, treatment-naïve pelvic PNF from a 16-year-old female with NF1, which was partially resected because of urinary obstruction. Five clusters emerged corresponding to distinct populations of Schwann cells, Fbs, T cells, ECs, and pericytes ( Fig. 3A ), which were identified on the basis of the presence of differentially expressed marker genes ( Fig. 3, B and C ). In contrast to murine PNF, Schwann cells comprised a relatively small fraction of the total cells present, which is consistent with observations in other recently published data ( ). Fbs constituted ~86% of cells (table S1). Enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes within the Fb cluster revealed TGFβ regulation of ECM to be the top differentially expressed geneset within the Fb cluster ( 18 Fig. 3D ). Concordantly, we observed up-regulation of genes encoding BM proteins including  LAMB1 and NID1  ( Fig. 3E ) within human PNF Fbs and Schwann cells. Last, we performed a NicheNet analysis using a priori knowledge of ligand-receptor interactions that influence target gene expression to decipher intercellular communication networks driven by discrete sender-receiver interactions in PNF. Using this methodology in both sender-agnostic and sender-focused approaches, we identified TGFβ1 as a top ligand with predicted activity in neoplastic Schwann cells ( Fig. 3, F and G ). To further validate these findings and assess their generalizability, we used deep neural networks to perform batch-corrected integration of our scRNA-seq data with additional, publicly available datasets ( n  = 34 samples from 15 NF1-associated neurofibromas across three independent datasets totaling 154,680 cells). This analysis corroborated our initial results, demonstrating similar up-regulation of BM proteins, including  LAMB1  and  NID1 , in Fbs and Schwann cells with high TGFβ pathway activation scores (fig. S1, A to F). Consistent with these findings, quantitative immunohistochemical (IHC) staining showed a significant increase in TGFβ1-positive tissue area in human neurofibromas compared to normal nerve (fig. S1, G and H). Collectively, these data suggest a putative role of TGFβ1 in driving PNF pathogenesis by promoting ECM and BM protein production. Fig. 3.

TGFβ1 overexpression in Schwann cells drives PNF growth and malignant transformation To experimentally interrogate the role of TGFβ1 in promoting PNF pathogenesis in vivo, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing TGFβ1 in Schwann cells and their precursors in conjunction with biallelic disruption of  Nf1  driven by  Hoxb7 -Cre ( Nf1 ). These  flox/flox ;Tgfb1 + ;Hoxb7-Cre + Nf1/Tgfb1  compound mutants exhibited decreased overall survival ( + Fig. 4A ) secondary to increased PNF burden and ultimately succumbed to large tumors that grew to >1 cm in size ( Fig. 4B ) and were histopathologically consistent with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) volumes were significantly larger in the  Nf1 flox/flox ;Tgfb 1  mice ( + ;Hoxb7-Cre + Fig. 4C ). Of the nine  Nf1  mice, four (44.4%) developed MPNST, while none of the  flox/flox ;Tgfb1 + ;Hoxb7-Cre + Nf1  mice developed MPNST. Therefore, we believe that the decreased survival observed in the  flox/flox ;Hoxb7-Cre + Nf1  mice was due to the more rapid onset of PNF development with higher tumor burden and tumors growing larger earlier, and sometimes progressing to MPNST. Both male and female mice were used for this study, and identical results were obtained regardless of sex. Western blot of PNF-bearing tissue from the  flox/flox ;Tgfb1 + ;Hoxb7-Cre + Nf1/Tgfb1 +  mutant mice revealed increased expression of TGFβ and SMAD3 phosphorylation (p-SMAD3), consistent with hyperactive TGFβ signaling. In addition, multiple BM proteins including LAMC, LAMB1, and NID1 were abundantly expressed in  Nf1/Tgfb1  PNF relative to  + Nf1  mutant controls ( Fig. 4D ). Collectively, these findings indicate that TGFβ1 overexpression in Schwann cells engenders PNF growth and malignant transformation and contributes to ECM remodeling in PNF by promoting BM protein deposition.

Actin is shown as the loading control. Mice 64478 and 64479 ( Nf1 ) and 64480 ( flox/flox ;Hoxb7-Cre + Nf1 ) were collected at 54 days, representing young age. Mice 58326 ( flox/flox ;Tgfb1 + ;Hoxb7-Cre + Nf1 ) and 62969, 62971, and 62977 ( flox/flox ;Hoxb7-Cre + Nf1 ) were collected at 160 days, representing mid-age. flox/flox ;Tgfb1 + ;Hoxb7-Cre + TGFβRI inhibition reduces PNF burden in  Nf1  mutant mice Bulk and single-cell transcriptomic analysis of murine and human PNF, in conjunction with findings of increased tumor burden in  Nf1/Tgfb1  mice, suggested a pivotal role of TGFβ signaling in PNF pathogenesis. We therefore tested whether galunisertib (LY2157299), a small-molecule inhibitor of the TGFβRI, would exhibit antitumor activity in PNF arising in  + Nf1  mutant mice. We began by evaluating galunisertib bioavailability—conducting pharmacokinetic studies following administration of a single dose of galunisertib (75 mg/kg) in  Nf1  mice in vivo. Plasma samples were collected at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours, and tissues were harvested at 1, 4, and 24 hours after administration ( flox/flox ;PostnCre + Fig. 5A  and fig. S1). The observed  C max  was 3078 ng/ml at 1 hour,  t 1/2  was estimated as 1.8 hours, and observed area under the curve was 7888 ng m –1  hour –1  (table S2). Fig. 5.

Plasma samples were assayed at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours, while tissue samples were harvested at 4 and 24 hours after a single 75 mg/kg dose of galunisertib administered by oral gavage. ( B ) p-SMAD2 (Ser 465/467 ), phosphorylation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1/2 (p-ERK1/2; Thr 202 /Tyr 204 ), and AKT phosphorylation (p-AKT; Ser 473 ) were detected by Western blot in sciatic nerve tissues at 1, 4, and 12 hours after administration of vehicle or galunisertib. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is shown as the loading control. Bar plots depict quantitative analysis of p-SMAD2 ( C ), p-ERK1/2 ( D ), and p-AKT ( E ) signal intensity in arbitrary densitometry units normalized to GAPDH as the loading control. Dots represent individual data points.  P  values denote statistical significance as determined by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Šidák’s multiple comparisons test between groups as annotated on the graphs. Error bars represent the SEM.  n  = 3 independent biological replicates per group, except for the 12-hour time point for which  n  = 2 replicates are shown. Vehicle-treated samples were harvested at the 12-hour time point. Having demonstrated adequate penetration of galunisertib within PNF-bearing nerve tissues, we then performed a pharmacodynamic analysis of TGFβ pathway target engagement in vivo at 1, 4, and 12 hours posttreatment ( Fig. 5B ). p-SMAD2 (Ser 465/467 ) was reduced within 4 hours of treatment and remained attenuated at 12 hours postadministration ( Fig. 5C ). Phosphorylation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1/2 (p-ERK1/2; Thr 202 /Tyr 204 ) was also reduced at 1 and 4 hours posttreatment but rebounded to vehicle-treated levels by 12 hours ( Fig. 5D ). In contrast, AKT phosphorylation (p-AKT; Ser 473 ) was stable with no change at 1, 4, and 12 hours ( Fig. 5E ). Having established that galunisertib inhibited TGFβ-dependent signaling in murine PNF in vivo, we proceeded to evaluate the antitumor activity of galunisertib in PNF-bearing  Nf1  mice. Galunisertib (75 mg/kg BID) or vehicle control was administered to  flox/flox ;PostnCre + Nf1  mice for 12 weeks. Tumor number, size, tumor burden index (TBI), and histology were evaluated at the study endpoint. We observed normalization of nerve architecture on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)–stained sections of galunisertib-treated PNF relative to vehicle controls ( flox/flox ;PostnCre + Fig. 6A ). Quantitatively, we found that the mean number of PNF per mouse was significantly reduced in galunisertib-treated  Nf1  animals ( flox/flox ;PostnCre + P  = 0.0071) ( Fig. 6B ). Tumor diameter at maximal width in serial two-dimensional histological sections was also significantly reduced in galunisertib-treated mice compared to the vehicle control ( P  = 0.029) ( Fig. 6C ). Last, a tumor burden index (TBI) was computed by multiplying the mean tumor diameter by the total PNF number per mouse. The TBI was reduced by 51.7% in galunisertib-treated mice as compared to the vehicle-treated controls ( P  = 0.0058) ( Fig. 6D ). Identical results were obtained regardless of sex. Fig. 6.

Outliers are plotted as individual points beyond the whiskers.  P  = 0.02 (unpaired, two-tailed  t  test). TGFβ-dependent signaling orchestrates tumor-associated collagen deposition and BM protein dynamics in PNF Given the recognized profibrotic role of TGFβ signaling, we hypothesized that TGFβ inhibition would alter ECM dynamics within the PNF microenvironment. Masson’s trichrome stain was used to quantify collagen in tumor-bearing regions of  Nf1  mice treated with galunisertib (TGFβi) versus vehicle control. We found that tumor-associated collagen was significantly reduced in galunisertib-treated animals ( flox/flox ;PostnCre + Fig. 6, E and F ). To further characterize the impact of TGFβRI inhibition on ECM dynamics in NF1-associated PNF, we performed ECM proteomics of PNF-bearing sciatic nerve tissue from  Nf1  mutant mice treated with galunisertib versus vehicle for 12 weeks. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed reduction of BM proteins including LAMC3, LAMB1, and NID1 in response to galunisertib treatment ( Fig. 7A ). In contrast, multiple BM proteins were up-regulated in PNF relative to control nerve tissue from non–tumor-bearing mice ( Fig. 7B ). Reduction of p-SMAD3, as well as BM proteins including LAMC, LAMB1, and NID1 in response to TGFβRI inhibition, was further confirmed by Western blot ( Fig. 7, C and D ). Collectively, our findings indicate that TGFβRI inhibition reduces PNF growth and suppresses the aberrant accumulation of BM proteins in the PNF ECM. Fig. 7.

  "discussion": "DISCUSSION This study identifies deregulated TGFβ signaling as a central driver of PNF pathogenesis and aberrant ECM remodeling within the PNF microenvironment. Using complementary genetic and pharmacologic approaches in mouse models with established translational relevance to human clinical trials ( ,  4 ,  7 ,  8 – 19 ), we demonstrate that hyperactive TGFβ1-dependent signaling up-regulates expression of BM proteins including LAMB1 and NID1 in PNF in vivo. These BM proteins are implicated in tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis across various cancers ( 21 – 22 ). TGFβRI inhibition markedly reduced tumor size and number in  24 Nf1  mice. While collagen abundance was only modestly reduced, we observed notable decreases in BM proteins including laminins and nidogens. These findings align with previous proteomic studies identifying BM proteins, not collagens, as the most enriched ECM proteins in PNF ( flox/flox ;PostnCre + ). These results suggest that TGFβRI inhibition primarily acts by depleting BM proteins rather than collagen content within the PNF ECM. 10 TGFβ is a multifunctional cytokine that plays a crucial role in regulating ECM composition and remodeling in cancer and fibrotic diseases. TGFβ signaling modulates the expression of numerous ECM components, including BM proteins such as laminins and nidogens as demonstrated in this study, fibronectin, collagens ( ), proteoglycans, and latent TGFβ-binding proteins (LTBPs), which sequester inactive TGFβ within the tissue field ( 25 ). However, these interactions demonstrate context and cell-type specificity. For instance, while prior work demonstrated that TGFβ1 enhanced type IV collagen and fibronectin expression in human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells without affecting laminin B1, B2, or nidogen mRNA ( 26 ), our data reveal a robust impact of TGFβ signaling on these BM proteins in the PNF microenvironment. Furthermore, specific ECM proteins can reciprocally influence TGFβ activation in health and disease. In Marfan syndrome, defective fibrillin-1 assembly impairs LTBP incorporation into the ECM, rendering TGFβ more accessible to cleavage-dependent activation ( 27 ,  28 ). Further investigation is needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which these complex interactions govern TGFβ signaling dynamics within the PNF microenvironment. 29 The paradoxical and dueling roles of TGFβ signaling in tumor initiation and progression provide crucial context for interpreting our findings. In healthy and premalignant cells, TGFβ primarily functions as a tumor suppressor, maintaining tissue homeostasis through the up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as p15INK4B and p21CIP ( ), suppression of c-Myc ( 30 ), induction of senescence ( 31 ), and inhibition of the production of stromal-derived growth factors ( 32 ,  33 ). However, these tumor-suppressive functions are frequently subverted in malignant cancers. Acquired genetic alterations in TGFβ receptors or SMAD proteins can redirect signaling toward noncanonical, SMAD-independent pathways such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT signaling that promote cell survival, proliferation, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( 34 ). 35 The Ras/MAPK pathway itself plays a critical role in modulating the growth-inhibitory and tumor-promoting effects of TGFβ. Oncogenic Ras mutations drive ERK-dependent p-SMAD2/3 at specific linker regions that are distinct from the activating phosphorylation sites induced by the TGFβ receptor complex ( ). This phosphorylation leads to cytoplasmic retention of SMAD proteins, impeding their nuclear translocation and ability to activate canonical transcriptional programs of growth arrest. In contrast, physiological Ras activators such as epidermal growth factor only partially reduce SMAD nuclear accumulation, suggesting that Ras-MAPK activity serves as a critical set point in decoupling the growth-inhibitory and tumor-promoting functions of TGFβ ( 36 ). In addition to directly altering SMAD function, activated MEK1 stabilizes the TGFβ type II receptor, preventing ligand-induced down-regulation and thus accentuating TGFβ signaling ( 36 ). 37 Our findings build on prior research demonstrating neurofibromin’s crucial role as a Ras GAP in regulating TGFβ expression and signaling.  Nf1  mutations promote an autocrine TGFβ-dependent prosurvival loop in Schwann-cell precursors (SCPs), rendering them insensitive to TGFβ-mediated cell death ( ). This phenotype is rescued by disrupting the R-Ras2 GTPase protein (TC21) in  38 Nf1 -deficient SCPs.  Nf1  deficiency in mast cells ( ) and osteoblasts results in gene-dose–dependent TGFβ1 overexpression, which can be mitigated by reintroducing the GAP-related domain of neurofibromin in osteoblast precursors ( 11 ). Enhanced TGFβ responsiveness has also been observed in  12 Nf1  Fbs, which exhibit increased proliferation and collagen synthesis in a RAS-c-Abl–dependent fashion ( +/− ). In mouse models of NF1-associated skeletal pathology driven by loss of  11 Nf1  in osteoblast precursors,  Nf1  mutant mice display systemically increased plasma TGFβ1 levels. Notably, TGFβRI kinase inhibition rescued bone mass deficits and prevented tibial nonunion in these animals ( flox/flox ;Col2.3Cre ), further supporting the therapeutic potential of targeting TGFβ in NF1. 12 Collectively, our findings demonstrate the potential therapeutic value of pharmacologic TGFβ inhibition for treating NF1-associated PNF, particularly in patients unresponsive or intolerant to MEKis. The observed rebound in phospho-ERK levels following prolonged TGFβi treatment suggests potential synergy between TGFβ and MEK inhibition. Further studies will be needed to establish whether aberrant Ras/MAPK-dependent signaling in NF1 drives resistance to TGFβRI kinase inhibition in PNF, and if so, whether combination therapy could overcome such resistance. However, several challenges exist for clinical translation. Concerns regarding cardiac valvulopathy associated with some TGFβRI kinase inhibitors have hindered clinical development ( ), although intermittent dosing may mitigate these toxicities ( 39 ). Galunisertib has shown a favorable safety profile with no evidence of clinically relevant cardiac toxicity or valvulopathy in multiple early-phase clinical studies in adults with malignant glioma, pancreatic cancer, and myelodysplastic syndrome ( 40 – 41 ). The efficacy of TGFβ inhibition in reducing tumor burden and normalizing the ECM microenvironment in preclinical models provides strong rationale for investing these agents in NF1-associated PNF. Moving forward, carefully designed clinical trials will be essential to optimize dosing strategies and evaluate long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy in the NF1-patient population to potentially establish TGFβ as a new therapeutic pillar in the treatment of these challenging tumors. 45",
