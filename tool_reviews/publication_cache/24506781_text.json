  "abstract": "Exon-skipping antisense oligonucleotides to correct missplicing in neurogenetic  diseases.  Siva K(1), Covello G, Denti MA.  Author information: (1)1 Center for Integrative Biology (CIBIO), University of Trento , Trento,  Italy .  Alternative splicing is an important regulator of the transcriptome. However,  mutations may cause alteration of splicing patterns, which in turn leads to  disease. During the past 10 years, exon skipping has been looked upon as a  powerful tool for correction of missplicing in disease and progress has been  made towards clinical trials. In this review, we discuss the use of antisense  oligonucleotides to correct splicing defects through exon skipping, with a  special focus on diseases affecting the nervous system, and the latest stage  achieved in its progress.
