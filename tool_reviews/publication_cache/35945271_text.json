  "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most common autosomal dominant genetic disorders, is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene. NF1 patients have a wide variety of manifestations with a subset at high risk for the development of tumors in the central nervous system (CNS). Nonsense mutations that result in the synthesis of truncated NF1 protein (neurofibromin) are strongly associated with CNS tumors. Therapeutic nonsense suppression with small molecule drugs is a potentially powerful approach to restore the expression of genes harboring nonsense mutations. Ataluren is one such drug that has been shown to restore full-length functional protein in several models of nonsense mutation diseases, as well as in patients with nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy. To test ataluren's potential applicability to NF1 nonsense mutations associated with CNS tumors, we generated a homozygous Nf1",
