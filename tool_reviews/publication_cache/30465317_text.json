  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The aim was to investigate pain, skin sensations symptoms and patient self-reported, and parent proxy-reported cognitive functioning as predictors of generic health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in pediatric patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) from the perspectives of patients and parents. METHODS: The Pain, Skin Itch Bother, Skin Sensations, and Cognitive Functioning Scales from the PedsQL\u2122 Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Module and the PedsQL\u2122 Generic Core Scales were completed in a multi-site national study by 323 patients and 335 parents. Patients were 5-25\u00a0years of age. Pain and skin symptoms and cognitive functioning were tested for bivariate and multivariate linear associations with generic HRQOL. RESULTS: Pain, skin itch bother, skin sensations, and cognitive functioning were associated with decreased HRQOL in bivariate analyses (P CONCLUSIONS: Pain, skin symptoms, and patient self-reported and parent proxy-reported cognitive functioning are key predictors of generic HRQOL in pediatric patients with NF1. Delineating NF1-specific symptoms and cognitive functioning as high-priority predictors from the patient and parents perspective enhances a family-centered approach in clinical research, clinical trials, and clinical practice intended to improve the global generic HRQOL of pediatric patients with NF1.",
