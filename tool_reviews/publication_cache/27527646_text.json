Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is associated with neurocognitive deficits that  can impact everyday functioning of children, adolescents, and adults with this  disease. However, there is little agreement regarding measures to use as  cognitive endpoints in clinical trials. This article describes the work of the  Neurocognitive Committee of the Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and  Schwannomatosis (REiNS) International Collaboration. The goal of this committee  is to identify standardized and specific cognitive assessment tools for use in  NF clinical trials. The committee first identified cognitive domains relevant to  NF1 and prioritized attention as the first domain of focus given prior and  current trends in NF1 cognitive clinical trials. Performance measures and  behavioral rating questionnaires of attention were reviewed by the group using  established criteria to assess patient characteristics, psychometric properties,  and feasibility. The highest rated tests underwent side-by-side comparison. The  Digit Span subtest from the Wechsler scales was given the highest ratings of the  performance measures due to its good psychometrics, feasibility, utility across  a wide age range, and extensive use in previous research. The Conners scales  achieved the highest ratings of the behavioral questionnaires for similar  reasons. Future articles will focus on other cognitive domains, with the  ultimate goal of achieving agreement for cognitive endpoints that can be used  across NF clinical trials.  © 2016 American Academy of Neurology.
