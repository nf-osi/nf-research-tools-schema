Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disease that predisposes  individuals to developing benign neurofibromas and malignant peripheral nerve  sheath tumors (MPNST). The mechanism of NF1-tumorigenesis or the curatives have  not been established. Using unique trascriptome and proteome integration method,  iPEACH (1), we previously identified translationally controlled tumor protein  (TCTP) as a novel biological target for NF1-associated tumors (2). Here, we  identified specific TCTP-interacting proteins by sequential affinity  purification and data-independent mass spectrometry acquisition (AP-DIA/SWATH)  to investigate the role of TCTP in NF1-associated malignant tumors. TCTP mainly  interacts with proteins related to protein synthesis and especially to  elongation factor complex components, including EF1A2, EF1B, EF1D, EF1G, and  valyl-tRNA synthetase (VARS), in NF1-deficient malignant tumor cells.  Interestingly, TCTP preferentially binds to EF1A2 (normally found only in neural  and skeletal-muscle cells and several cancer cells), rather than EF1A1 despite  the high homologies (98%) in their sequences. The docking simulation and further  validations to study the interaction between TCTP and EF1A2 revealed that TCTP  directly binds with EF1A2 via the contact areas of EF1A2 dimerization. Using  unique and common sequences between EF1A2 and EF1A1 in AP-DIA/SWATH, we  quantitatively validated the interaction of EF1A2 and TCTP/other elongation  factors and found that TCTP coordinates the translational machinery of  elongation factors via the association with EF1A2. These data suggest that TCTP  activates EF1A2-dependent translation by mediating complex formation with other  elongation factors. Inhibiting the TCTP-EF1A2 interaction with EF1A2 siRNAs or a  TCTP inhibitor, artesunate, significantly down-regulated the factors related to  protein translation and caused dramatic suppression of growth/translation in  NF1-associated tumors. Our findings demonstrate that a specific protein  translation machinery related to the TCTP-EF1A2 interaction is functionally  implicated in the tumorigenesis and progression of NF1-associated tumors and  could represent a therapeutic target.  © 2019 Kobayashi et al.
