  "methods": "Materials and Methods Animal procedures All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) of the University of Iowa and Exemplar Genetics (Coralville, Iowa) and all procedures were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. 12 Yucatan minipigs (6 female, 6 male), 8 heterozygous for NF1 ( NF1 ) and 4 littermate wildtypes, were systematically imaged at 4-, 8-, and 12-months of age using both CT and MR imaging. Animals were anesthetized using either a combination of midazolam (0.6\u2009mg/kg) and ketamine (2.2\u2009mg/kg) or telazol (2.2\u20134.4\u2009mg/kg), ketamine (1.1\u20132.2\u2009mg/kg), and xylazine (1.1\u20132.2\u2009mg/kg). Anesthesia was maintained throughout animal preparation and imaging using isoflurane (1\u20135%). Each pig was intubated with a balloon-cuffed endotracheal tube (6\u20138\u2009mm) and mechanically ventilated using a Primer SP MRI-Compatible Veterinary Anesthesia Ventilator (DRE Veterinary). Animals were ventilated under 100% oxygen with a respiratory rate of 16-20 breaths per minute, 5cmH +/ex42del 2 O positive end expiratory pressure, and a tidal volume of approximately 10\u2009mL/kg. Physiological monitoring was performed using electrocardiogram, oxygen saturation (SP-O2), and end tidal carbon dioxide pressure (ET-CO2). Ventilation parameters were modified when necessary to maintain a heart rate between 80\u2013100 beats per minute and an SP-O2 of 95\u2013100%. Prior to imaging, animals were placed in the prone position with their hind limbs extended behind them and their forelimbs fully adducted to their sides to provide stability. Mechanical ventilation was maintained throughout imaging; no breath holds were performed. Imaging procedures A longitudinal imaging study was devised with three proposed imaging timepoints at 4-months (TP1), 8-months (TP2), and 12-months (TP3) of age (Fig.\u00a0 S1 ). Scans were systematically reviewed at each timepoint by a radiologist (T.S.S.) specializing in pediatrics and neuroradiology using a structured method of reporting. Review was performed unblinded to known genotype ( NF1  /wildtype) and preceding timepoint scans were provided for longitudinal assessment concordant with clinical practice. +/ex42del A non-contrast enhanced, full body screening CT was acquired at TP1 and TP3 using a Siemens SOMATOM Force CT scanner (Siemens Healthcare, Forcheim, Germany) or a GE Discovery MI PET/CT (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI). The following standard dose parameters were used for acquisition: Spiral, 70\u2009kV, 208 ref. mAs (tube current modulation on), pitch 1.9. Data was reconstructed as 0.75 and 2\u2009mm slice thicknesses using iterative reconstructions (Qr40, ADMIRE level 5 or STANDARD, ASiR 100%). A subsequent equivalent scan was acquired at a lower radiation dose level with the same parameters but with a 20-reference mAs. MR imaging was performed at all timepoints using a 3.0\u2009T General Electric Discovery MR750w. Four separate protocols were used for imaging: head, whole body, spine, and targeted. The developed protocols drew from whole-body screening recommendations and typical clinical practice . The targeted protocol was used only when an unexpected or abnormal finding was identified during one of the prior three protocols. Table\u00a0 48 , 49 1  lists the scans of each protocol and their parameters. Head scans were completed using a 32-channel head coil. Targeted scans were completed using the 8US TORSOPA abdominal coil. Table 1 Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging parameters.

Clinical measurements and recording At each imaging timepoint, minipig weight and exterior clinical indications were recorded. With the anesthetized minipig positioned laterally, photographs were taken the right and left sides. Additional photographs of encountered phenotypes were taken including CALMs, axillary and inguinal freckling, and exterior indications of neurofibroma. For each minipig exhibiting CALMs, the diameter of the largest marking on each side was measured and tracked for change across the imaging timepoints. A description of this method is included as\u00a0 Supplemental Text . Skeletal measurements Using the CT scans from TP1, skeletal measurements were taken with tools available in 3D Slicer ( https://www.slicer.org/ ) to identify any developmental abnormalities typically seen in NF1 patients. A full description with images of these CT based skeletal measurements is included as\u00a0 Supplemental Text . To summarize, length measurements were made of the long bones on both lateral sides including the femur, tibia, humerus, ulna, metacarpals, and metatarsals. Presence of anterolateral tibia bowing was assessed using an angle measurement previously described in an NF1 mouse model . 62 Optic nerve measurements Longitudinal measurements of the optic nerves from head MR images were obtained using a method previously described . A full description with images of measurements is included as\u00a0 63 Supplemental Text . To summarize, measurements of the diameter of the optic nerve with and without the nerve sheath were taken from the axial plane of the T2 CUBE datasets. These diameters were systematically measured at 3\u2009mm behind the ocular globe in the image slice that provided the clearest view of the nerve. Histopathology neurofibroma assessment For minipig tumor development assessment, at necropsy tissue was taken from identified sites of interest (Fig.\u00a0 2 ). At each site, tumor tissue was excised and samples collected from epidermal/dermal region as well as the subcutis and deep tumor margins. Tumor tissues were fixed (10% neutral buffered formalin x 5\u20137 days), processed, paraffin-embedded, sectioned (~4\u2009\u00b5m) and stained for hematoxylin and eosin (HE) or Masson\u2019s Trichrome (MT) stains. S100 immunohistochemistry was performed as detailed previously . Tissues were examined by a veterinary pathologist following principles of reproducible histopathological examination and scoring 64 . As the tissues came from the same animal and were used principally for comparative descriptions, masking of the samples was not necessary. 65 Imaging-based neurofibroma assessment The corresponding regions for histopathology were assessed in the T2 FS, LAVA Pre- and LAVA Post- contrast scans for quantitative imaging characteristics. Measurements of the neurofibroma regions were made using the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria on the LAVA post contrast MR scans; WHO is taken as the product of the two longest perpendicular measurements of a tumor, progressive disease is defined as \u226525% increase in one lesion . Regions of interest (ROI) corresponding to biopsy zones were extracted from axial slices as regions with consistent area of 1400 square pixels. Percentage signal intensity change ( 38 % SI\u0394) was extracted from the ROIs as previously described . Additional quantitative imaging features (T2 Mean, T2 Entropy, T2 Skewness, and LAVA-Pre Kurtosis) were extracted and compared to published values on retrospective human clinical subjects with benign plexiform neurofibromas 66 . 40 Statistical analysis A two-sample Wilcoxon rank sum (Mann-Whitney) test was performed between  NF1  and wildtype minipig weight and skeletal measurements +/ex42del . For the ten subjects with three timepoints, subject weight growth across time was compared using repeated measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) following assessment of Mauchly\u2019s sphericity test with two degrees of freedom 67 . An alpha value of 0.05 was used to establish significance on a statistical level. Repeated skeletal measurements were compared using Lin\u2019s concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) with a value \u22650.90 considered repeatable 68 . 69",

  "introduction": "Introduction Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder with nearly 100% penetrance and an incidence of approximately 1\u2009in every 3,000 births worldwide . The clinical manifestations of the disorder are highly variable, even among individuals with the same mutation in NF1 1 . The most common phenotypic presentations of NF1 include caf\u00e9-au-lait macules (CALMs), axillary and inguinal freckling, optic pathway gliomas, pilocytic astrocytoma, and the presence of neurofibromas and plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) that have the potential to develop into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) 1 , 2 . Some individuals with NF1 may exhibit learning disabilities, increased pain, short stature, or macrocephaly at birth 1 \u2013 3 . Although uncommon, they may also be born with or develop tibial bowing and sphenoid wing dysplasia 3 , 4 . Those affected by NF1 are also at increased risk of developing a number of different cancers including glioblastoma, breast cancer, and leukemia 4 . Because of the heterogeneity, impact on quality of life, and significant morbidity associated with NF1, there is a considerable need for research into its underlying pathology and noninvasive monitoring of its progression. 1 Systematic study of NF1 in human subjects is a major challenge as the variability in disease presentation between individuals makes it difficult to create an effective longitudinal cohort. Medical imaging is used in the NF1 population to detect and monitor disease phenotypes including optic-pathway glioma , plexiform neurofibroma and MPNST, spinal neurofibroma, tibial bowing and scoliosis. Retrospectively collected imaging studies have assessed prevalence and NF1 findings in radiograph 5 \u2013 7 , computed tomography (CT) 8 , magnetic resonance (MR) imaging 9 , and positron emission tomography (PET) 7 , 10 , 11 . As the NF1 population is more susceptible to the effects of radiation 12 , prospective studies are often limited to non-ionization radiation modalities such as MR 13  and ultrasound 5 , 6 , 14 , 15 . 16 , 17 Efforts to create animal models of NF1 seek to provide the opportunity to explore treatment response and natural course . Several murine models of NF1 have already been developed; however, mice are too small for the relevant medical imaging systems to be used in detection and monitoring the progression of NF1\u2019s phenotypes 18 \u2013 24 . Minipigs have proven to be successful models in a range of human diseases including Huntington\u2019s disease, ataxia-telangiectasia, cystic fibrosis, and cancer 19 \u2013 21 , 24 . The similarities between the minipig and humans with regards to anatomy, physiology, and size allows them to be studied using the same imaging systems that are used clinically for human patients. Our previous work with minipigs has shown that a deletion of exon 42 ( 25 \u2013 33 NF1 ), a mutation observed in NF1 patients, mimics early in life, a wide range of phenotypes exhibited by the human population including CALMs, cutaneous and/or plexiform neurofibromas, axillary and inguinal freckling, unidentified bright objects, decreased cognitive abilities +/ex42del , and increased pain and sleep disturbances 22 . In this study, we examine and monitor the development of NF1 characteristics in a second generation of Yucatan minipig using CT and MR over the first 12-months of life. Image time points at 4, 8, and 12 months target key developmental stages corresponding to pre-puberty, adolescence and young adulthood in the pig 34 . This study provided a unique opportunity for systematic evaluation to capture the natural penetrance of phenotypical presentation and track progression of disease manifestation of  35 , 36 NF1  minipigs compared to sibling wildtype controls. +/ex42del",
  "results": "Systemic imaging of minipigs allows for investigation of other findings In our cohort of 8  NF1  minipigs we did not see indication of optic glioma or optic chiasm tumor (Fig.\u00a0 +/ex42del S3A ). Assessment of the brain did not demonstrate presence of \u201cunidentified bright objects\u201d which was present in the F0 boars  and have been associated in NF1 humans with cognitive dysfunction (Fig.\u00a0 22 S3B ) . Two of the  22 , 41 \u2013 46 NF1  subjects exhibited deep shoulder lesions that could not be identified upon necropsy (Fig.\u00a0 +/ex42del S3C ). These lesions were consistent with a previous injury or preanesthetic delivery prior to image acquisition, as has been sometimes seen. A finding previously undescribed in MR and CT imaging was the presence of an enlarged accessory sex gland in uncastrated males (Fig.\u00a0 S3D ) which appears bright on STIR, isointense on T2, and similar to soft-tissue on CT . Optic gliomas are a manifestation of NF1 occurring in an estimated 15% of children with the disease. Measurement of the optic nerve and sheath indicated no significant difference (p\u2009>\u20090.19) between  47 NF1  and wildtype (Fig.\u00a0 +/ex42del S4 ) .",
  "discussion": "Discussion We longitudinally studied an NF1 porcine model ( NF1 ) for the first 12-months of life to evaluate phenotype development, track disease progression, and provide a comparison to human subjects. Through systematic tracking we have shown that an  +/ex42del NF1  minipig model develops phenotypic characteristics [1] CALMs, [2] axillary/inguinal freckling, [3] shortened stature, [4] tibial bone curvature, and [5] histological variations in neurofibroma growth. With littermate wildtype controls we confirmed that these findings were exclusive to minipigs with NF1 genotype. The breadth of common NF1 phenotypes presented in this cohort indicates minipigs as a translational correlate to the diversity seen in the human presentation of NF1. Through this study we outlined a set of imaging protocols that allow for the longitudinal tracking of phenotypes and demonstrated the effectiveness of tracking on a minipig developing neurofibroma. The ability to longitudinal track neurofibroma progression with non-invasive medical imaging modalities common to human subjects is powerful for preclinical applications such as drug response assessment. +/ex42del The series of imaging protocols utilized for this study were guided by recommendations from the REiNS International Collaboration which indicates that MR imaging acquisition should be optimized for tumor type/location and recommends both whole-body imaging and the STIR protocol for visualization of peripheral nerve sheath tumors . However, it was noted in Dombi  48 , 49 et al . that some clinically relevant tumors may not have good tissue definition on MR imaging with the accompanying Fig.\u00a0 3a,b  of that manuscript displaying a superficial flank plexiform neurofibroma . The development of neurofibroma in a minipig model allows for robust comparison of protocols and modalities which is not possible in human subjects. We recorded the development and growth of a neurofibroma in a minipig model over the course over a 20-month period with four imaging time-points consisting of screening MR, targeted MR, and whole-body CT. We demonstrated detection of neurofibroma with LDCT and with additional testing this could suggest LDCT as a viable option for whole-body screening with reduced radiation exposure over standard CT, and as a fast acquisition (not requiring anesthesia) alternative to MR. 48 We performed an extensive CT-based skeletal measurement assessment in our matched cohort. Short stature is common among NF1 adults with 20\u201330% below the 3 rd  percentile in height .\u00a0We found statistically smaller long bones (femur, tibia, humerus, ulna, metacarpals) in the  37 NF1  minipigs compared to their wildtype siblings. Previous NF1 minipig studies found no difference in stature using external measurement of length and height +/ex42del . However, prior studies have recorded strong association between femur measurement and human stature in adults 23  and children 50  and have been used as a surrogate measure of growth differences between rats 51  and pigs 52 . Hence, we conclude that the significant difference in multiple bones of the  53 NF1  minipigs is indicative of the short stature that is associated with NF in human patients. Interestingly, the metatarsals were the only long bones to not be statistically smaller in the  +/ex42del NF1  minipigs; recently, Faria  +/ex42del et al . described a potential new phenotype of NF1 in which the second toe of subjects is elevated and super-positioned on the third toe, visual assessment of minipig metatarsal arrangement did not demonstrate evidence of this characteristic . Tibial bowing is a rare but distinctive phenotype in NF1 (3\u20134%) 54 , we report quantitative results of increased bilateral and unilateral bowing in NF1 minipigs out of the range of wildtype sibling controls, indicating a potential phenotype. Isakson  37 et al . described bilateral tibial dysplasia narrowing in two cloned boars using qualitative radiograph assessment but did not note other skeletal abnormalities in the F1 cohort . Weight was not statistically significantly different between  23 NF1  and wildtype minipigs at any of the three study time points (4, 8 and 12 months of age). Previous studies have indicated a reduced weight NF1 minipigs using a small selected cohort (N\u2009=\u20093) +/ex42del . 23 The skin of the Yucatan minipig has previously been shown to have similar characteristics to human skin including epidermal thickness and melanin assessment . This was confirmed with the presence of NF1 dermal manifestations including CALMs and axillary/inguinal freckling in all  55 NF1  subjects in this cohort. Over 99% of humans with NF1 present with CALMs ranging from 0.5\u2009cm to greater than 20\u2009cm\u2009in diameter +/ex42del . Here, through longitudinal tracking of CALMs we found the minipig presentation showed similarity in size (1.0\u2009cm\u20135.0\u2009cm). One  56 NF1  subject in our cohort presented with a giant CALM (>20\u2009cm\u2009in diameter) along the left side; giant CALM is a rare NF1 manifestation reported in cases of segmental sporadic NF1 mutation with associated with plexiform neurofibroma and MPNST +/ex42del . As the minipig subjects aged, the skin tended to lighten making it difficult to visually inspect the CALMs; this is in contrast to the human population where increased skin pigmentation due to sun exposure is common 57 \u2013 59 . 56 There are currently two NF1 minipig published models: the Yucatan  NF1 +/ex42del  and the Ossabaw  22 , 34 NF1 . The two models have some similarities and variations which will benefit the research community and provide the mechanism for more individualized choices in phenotypical presentation. In our previously published Yucatan  p.Arg1947*  23 NF1  cohort we demonstrated imaging of neurofibromas in three male NF1 pigs that also presented with CALMs +/ex42del . In this study, we have tracked individual CALM from 4 to 12 months of age - correlating to prepubescence through early adulthood in humans \u2013 finding that CALMs in minipigs across this time period are stable is size. Further, we have demonstrated presence of axillary/inguinal freckling through the 12 months of age. Unlike our previous cohort of  22 NF1  swine, the animals presented here are the offspring of cloned boars heterozygous for the  +/ex42del NF1  exon 42 deletion bred to wildtype sows . There is some evidence to suggest that cloned (F0) animals may exhibit weakened immune systems and other abnormal phenotypes in adulthood, resulting in divergent health outcomes and irregular behavior 22 . In this study we have excluded those potential effects by using naturally bred first generation (F1) minipigs. Isakson  60 , 61 et al . recently reported in an Ossabaw minipig model the development of CALMs (F0, F1), freckling (F1), Lisch nodules (F0), dermal neurofibroma (F0, F1), a glioma-like lesion in optic chiasm (F1), and tibial narrowing (F0) . In this study\u2019s Yucatan F1 cohort we found no evidence of optic chiasm lesion. 23 This study has limitations. While this is the first systematic longitudinal study of a cohort of  NF1  animals with littermate wildtype control animals, the study contained a limited number of animals (N\u2009=\u200912). As some clinically important NF1 phenotypes are rare in the human population, this small animal cohort may not fully represent the spectrum of phenotypes present in the  +/ex42del NF1  swine model. We did not systematically screen this cohort of animals for Lisch nodules or cognitive impairment. Abnormal curvatures of the spine are potential skeletal abnormality associated with NF1, however, in our study we were not able to differentiate imaging assessed spinal curvature from positional distortion in our anesthetized, prone minipigs. It is possible this could be assessed in future studies by incorporating a different positioning approach for image acquisition. This study was designed to systematically image the animal cohort for the first 12 months of age for early characterization and progression over this time-period (early childhood and adolescence). The one  +/ex42del NF1  animal that presented with a neurofibroma within 12 months was necropsied at 20 months. Hence, we cannot determine if further members of the cohort would have developed neurofibromas after 12 months of age - note in our prior study of the F0 cohort neurofibromas were discovered between the ages of 11 and 17 months of age +/ex42del . Due to the yet unknown role of hormones on NF1 phenotype development, the male animals in this study were uncastrated which can present some challenges for longitudinal housing and scientific study. Uncastrated boars have increased aggression and sexual behaviors, along with physical characteristics such as tusk growth and thickened subcutaneous layer of tissue (aka shoulder plate). These characteristics can\u00a0require individual housing and increased caution (and personnel) for transport, anesthesia administration, and recovery. 22 In conclusion,  in-vivo , clinical equivalent medical imaging protocols including CT and MR were used to systematically evaluate early development of NF1 related phenotypes in a matched cohort of male and female  NF1  animals with littermate wildtype control animals. In this study we found penetrant presentation of shortened stature and\u00a0tibial curvature. Typical skin manifestations of NF1 including CALMs and axillary/inguinal freckling were identified as stable throughout the  +/ex42del NF1  minipig life-course. One out of eight  +/ex42del NF1  animals developed a neurofibroma which progressed over time, paralleled to imaging characteristics of human neurofibromas, and demonstrated differential maturation on histopathology. This  +/ex42del NF1  Yucatan minipig model presents a powerful tool for optimization of medical imaging protocols and preclinical therapeutic evaluation. +/ex42del",
