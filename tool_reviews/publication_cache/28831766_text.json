  "abstract": "Neurofibromin and Sprouty-related EVH1 domain-containing protein 1 (Spred1) both act as negative regulators of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and are associated with the rare diseases Neurofibromatosis type 1 and Legius syndrome, respectively. Spred1 recruits the major GTPase activating protein (GAP) neurofibromin from the cytosol to the membrane in order to inactivate the small G protein Ras. These functions are dependent on the N-terminal EVH1 domain and the C-terminal Sprouty domain of Spred1 whereas the former specifically recognizes the GAP related domain of neurofibromin and the latter is responsible for membrane targeting. Within the GAP domain, Spred1 binding depends on the GAPex portion which is dispensable for Ras inactivation. In a first step towards the characterization of the Neurofibromin Spred1 interface in solution we assigned backbone and side chain",
