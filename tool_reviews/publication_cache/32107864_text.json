  "title": "Expanding the Noonan spectrum/RASopathy NGS panel: Benefits of adding NF1 and SPRED1.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: RASopathies are a group of disorders caused by disruptions to the RAS-MAPK pathway. Despite being in the same pathway, Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) and Legius syndrome (LS) typically present with phenotypes distinct from Noonan spectrum disorders (NSDs). However, some NF1/LS individuals also exhibit NSD phenotypes, often referred to as Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome (NFNS), and may be mistakenly evaluated for NSDs, delaying diagnosis, and affecting patient management. METHODS: A derivation cohort of 28 patients with a prior negative NSD panel and either NFNS or a suspicion of NSD and caf\u00e9-au-lait spots underwent NF1 and SPRED1 sequencing. To further determine the utility and burden of adding these genes, a validation cohort of 505 patients with a suspected RASopathy were tested on a 14-gene RASopathy-associated panel. RESULTS: In the derivation cohort, six (21%) patients had disease-causing NF1 or SPRED1 variants. In the validation cohort, 11 (2%) patients had disease-causing variants and 15 (3%) had variants of uncertain significance in NF1 or SPRED1. Of those with disease-causing variants, 5/17 only had an NSD diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Adding NF1 and SPRED1 to RASopathy panels can speed diagnosis and improve patient management, without significantly increasing the burden of inconclusive results.",

To further determine the utility and burden of adding these genes, a validation cohort of 505 patients with a suspected RASopathy were tested on a 14\u2010gene RASopathy\u2010associated panel. 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Ethical Compliance This study was approved by Partner's Healthcare Institutional Review Board. 2.2 Study Population The derivation cohort included 28 deidentified patients with a suspicion of NSD and cafe\u2010au\u2010lait spots or NFNS, who previously tested negative for an NSD gene panel. Their ages ranged from 8\u00a0months to 35\u00a0years, with a mean age of 6.8\u00a0years. Twenty\u2010one patients were negative for variants in eight RASopathy\u2010associated genes ( BRAF ,  HRAS ,  KRAS ,  MAP2K1 ,  MAP2K2 ,  PTPN11 ,  RAF1 , and  SOS1 ), while seven patients were negative for variants in 10 RASopathy\u2010associated genes ( CBL  and  NRAS  in addition to the previous eight). The validation cohort included 505 patients with a clinical diagnosis or suspicion of a RASopathy and no prior molecular testing for RASopathies. Their ages ranged from 1\u00a0month to 54\u00a0years, with a mean age of 9.7\u00a0years. The validation cohort was tested using a 14\u2010gene panel that included the  NF1  and  SPRED1  (see Table  S1  for complete gene list). 2.3 Sequencing DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples using PureGene Blood Core Kit B (Qiagen). For the derivation cohort, 28 DNA samples were tested using next generation sequencing (NGS) of the  NF1  ( NM_000267.3 ) and  SPRED1  ( NM_152594.3 )\u00a0genes. For the validation cohort, all 505 samples were tested using next generation sequencing (NGS) of 14 RASopathy\u2010associated genes (Table  S1 ) as previously described (Pugh et al.,  2014 ). Briefly, NGS was performed by oligonucleotide hybridization\u2010based DNA capture (SureSelect; Agilent) followed by sequencing using the MiSeq\u2010M01450 instrument (150\u2010base paired end mode; Illumina). Sequence reads were aligned to the reference sequence (GRCh37) using bwa\u2010mem v0.7.10, followed by variant calling using GATK, version 1.0.4705 (McKenna et al.,  2010 ). For the validation cohort, Sanger sequencing was used to confirm all clinically significant variants and fill in regions with insufficient coverage. Methods used for polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing have been previously described (Zimmerman et al.,  2010 ). Copy number variants (CNVs) were identified via an NGS\u2010based detection tool (VisCap) (Pugh et al.,  2016 ), but were only available for 23 patients in the derivation cohort and 281 patients in the validation cohort due to NGS data quality. Confirmation of CNVs was done using ddPCR as previously described (Ceyhan\u2010Birsoy et al.,  2015 ). 2.4 Variant classification Variant classification was based on the 2015 guidelines by the American College of Medical Genetics and the Association of Molecular Pathology (Richards et al.,  2015 ). Variants of uncertain significance (VUS) were further subcategorized into three categories: VUS\u2010favor pathogenic when there is a suspicion of a pathogenicity, VUS\u2010favor benign when the evidence suggests the variant does not contribute to disease, and VUS when there is a lack of or conflicting evidence. Although clinical features observed in our cohorts were not used to classify the identified variants, physician\u2010reported clinical findings in patients with pathogenic or likely pathogenic  NF1  or  SPRED1  variants are described in Tables  1  and  2 .
