  "title": "Expanding the Noonan spectrum/RASopathy NGS panel: Benefits of adding NF1 and SPRED1.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: RASopathies are a group of disorders caused by disruptions to the RAS-MAPK pathway. Despite being in the same pathway, Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) and Legius syndrome (LS) typically present with phenotypes distinct from Noonan spectrum disorders (NSDs). However, some NF1/LS individuals also exhibit NSD phenotypes, often referred to as Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome (NFNS), and may be mistakenly evaluated for NSDs, delaying diagnosis, and affecting patient management. METHODS: A derivation cohort of 28 patients with a prior negative NSD panel and either NFNS or a suspicion of NSD and caf\u00e9-au-lait spots underwent NF1 and SPRED1 sequencing. To further determine the utility and burden of adding these genes, a validation cohort of 505 patients with a suspected RASopathy were tested on a 14-gene RASopathy-associated panel. RESULTS: In the derivation cohort, six (21%) patients had disease-causing NF1 or SPRED1 variants. In the validation cohort, 11 (2%) patients had disease-causing variants and 15 (3%) had variants of uncertain significance in NF1 or SPRED1. Of those with disease-causing variants, 5/17 only had an NSD diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Adding NF1 and SPRED1 to RASopathy panels can speed diagnosis and improve patient management, without significantly increasing the burden of inconclusive results.",

To further determine the utility and burden of adding these genes, a validation cohort of 505 patients with a suspected RASopathy were tested on a 14\u2010gene RASopathy\u2010associated panel. 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Ethical Compliance This study was approved by Partner's Healthcare Institutional Review Board. 2.2 Study Population The derivation cohort included 28 deidentified patients with a suspicion of NSD and cafe\u2010au\u2010lait spots or NFNS, who previously tested negative for an NSD gene panel. Their ages ranged from 8\u00a0months to 35\u00a0years, with a mean age of 6.8\u00a0years. Twenty\u2010one patients were negative for variants in eight RASopathy\u2010associated genes ( BRAF ,  HRAS ,  KRAS ,  MAP2K1 ,  MAP2K2 ,  PTPN11 ,  RAF1 , and  SOS1 ), while seven patients were negative for variants in 10 RASopathy\u2010associated genes ( CBL  and  NRAS  in addition to the previous eight). The validation cohort included 505 patients with a clinical diagnosis or suspicion of a RASopathy and no prior molecular testing for RASopathies. Their ages ranged from 1\u00a0month to 54\u00a0years, with a mean age of 9.7\u00a0years. The validation cohort was tested using a 14\u2010gene panel that included the  NF1  and  SPRED1  (see Table  S1  for complete gene list). 2.3 Sequencing DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples using PureGene Blood Core Kit B (Qiagen). For the derivation cohort, 28 DNA samples were tested using next generation sequencing (NGS) of the  NF1  ( NM_000267.3 ) and  SPRED1  ( NM_152594.3 )\u00a0genes. For the validation cohort, all 505 samples were tested using next generation sequencing (NGS) of 14 RASopathy\u2010associated genes (Table  S1 ) as previously described (Pugh et al.,  2014 ). Briefly, NGS was performed by oligonucleotide hybridization\u2010based DNA capture (SureSelect; Agilent) followed by sequencing using the MiSeq\u2010M01450 instrument (150\u2010base paired end mode; Illumina). Sequence reads were aligned to the reference sequence (GRCh37) using bwa\u2010mem v0.7.10, followed by variant calling using GATK, version 1.0.4705 (McKenna et al.,  2010 ). For the validation cohort, Sanger sequencing was used to confirm all clinically significant variants and fill in regions with insufficient coverage. Methods used for polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing have been previously described (Zimmerman et al.,  2010 ). Copy number variants (CNVs) were identified via an NGS\u2010based detection tool (VisCap) (Pugh et al.,  2016 ), but were only available for 23 patients in the derivation cohort and 281 patients in the validation cohort due to NGS data quality. Confirmation of CNVs was done using ddPCR as previously described (Ceyhan\u2010Birsoy et al.,  2015 ). 2.4 Variant classification Variant classification was based on the 2015 guidelines by the American College of Medical Genetics and the Association of Molecular Pathology (Richards et al.,  2015 ). Variants of uncertain significance (VUS) were further subcategorized into three categories: VUS\u2010favor pathogenic when there is a suspicion of a pathogenicity, VUS\u2010favor benign when the evidence suggests the variant does not contribute to disease, and VUS when there is a lack of or conflicting evidence. Although clinical features observed in our cohorts were not used to classify the identified variants, physician\u2010reported clinical findings in patients with pathogenic or likely pathogenic  NF1  or  SPRED1  variants are described in Tables  1  and  2 .

  "introduction": "1 INTRODUCTION RASopathies are a group of autosomal dominant disorders caused by pathogenic variants in genes within the RAS\u2012MAPK pathway. They include the disorders historically referred to as \u201cNoonan spectrum disorders\u201d (NSD: Noonan syndrome (NS; MIM:163950), CBL syndrome (MIM:613563), Noonan syndrome\u2010like disorder with loose anagen hair (MIM:607721), cardio\u2010facio\u2010cutaneous syndrome (CFC; MIM:115150), Costello syndrome (MIM:218040), and Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML; MIM:151100)), as well as Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1; MIM:162200) and Legius syndrome (LS; MIM:611431) (Tartaglia & Gelb,  2010 ). NSDs are caused by gain\u2010of\u2010function or altered activity germline variants in the  PTPN11, RAF1, SOS1, RIT1, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, SHOC2, BRAF, MAP2K1, MAP2K2,  and  CBL , while NF1 and LS are caused by loss\u2010of\u2010function germline variants in the  NF1  and  SPRED1 , respectively (Tartaglia & Gelb,  2010 ). In addition, there are emerging genes (e.g. , RASA2, PPP1CB,  and  SOS2)  with limited to strong association to RASopathy\u2010associated pathognomonic features, as well as  LZTR1 , which is associated with a dominant and recessive form of disease (Grant et al.,  2018 ). Despite being caused by genes in the same pathway, NF1 and LS typically present distinctly from NSDs. NF1 typically presents with\u00a0>\u00a06 cafe\u2010au\u2010lait spots (CALs), peripheral neurofibromas, Lisch nodules, optic gliomas, skin fold freckling, skeletal dysplasia and absolute macrocephaly, whereas LS typically presents with multiple CALs, relative or absolute macrocephaly, axillary or inguinal freckling, and a lack of Lisch nodules or neurofibromas (Brems et al.,  2012 ; Gutmann et al.,  2017 ; Tartaglia & Gelb,  2010 ). Furthermore, individuals with LS or NF1 do not typically present with cardiac defects (2% of NF1 affecteds and few reports in LS) or facial dysmorphism (Brems et al.,  2012 ; Lin et al.,  2000 ). In contrast, NSDs typically present with congenital heart defects (mainly pulmonary valve stenosis (PVS) or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), short stature, dysmorphic facial features (e.g., epicanthal folds, hypertelorism, down\u2010slanting eyes, short\u2010broad nose, deep grooved philtrum, small chin, and tall forehead), skeletal deformities (mainly scoliosis or pectus deformities), relative macrocephaly, and may have a small number of CALs (Tartaglia & Gelb,  2010 ; Williams, Dagli, & Battaglia,  2008 ). In rare cases, some individuals with disease\u2010causing variants in the  NF1  or  SPRED1  may present with multiple NSD pathognomonic features, especially those associated with NS or NSML, and a lack of NF1 features (Tartaglia & Gelb,  2010 ). For example, Neurofibromatosis\u2010Noonan syndrome (NFNS) and Watson syndrome (WS), both caused by pathogenic variants in the  NF1 , present with phenotypes similar to NSDs: NFNS presents with a NS facial gestalt, short stature, skeletal defects, and multiple CALs, while WS presents with short stature, PVS, multiple CALs, and intellectual disability (Tartaglia & Gelb,  2010 ). Furthermore, both NFNS and WS exhibit reduced expressivity of pathognomonic NF1 features (e.g., Lisch nodules, neurofibromatosis, and internal tumors) as compared to classic NF1 (Tartaglia & Gelb,  2010 ). Accordingly, adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of NS or NSML and disease\u2010causing variants in the  NF1  gene do not always meet clinical criteria for NF1 (Chen et al.,  2014 ; Croonen, Yntema, van Minkelen, van den Ouweland, & van der Burgt,  2012 ; Wu et al.,  1996 ). Many individuals with NFNS may be worked up for an NSD prior to the recognition or development of NF1\u2010like features, resulting in an incorrect or delayed clinical diagnosis, attributable to the reduced expressivity of pathognomonic NF1 features in NFNS individuals or lack of some NF1 features in children under 6\u00a0years of age (Gutmann et al.,  2017 ; Tartaglia & Gelb,  2010 ). However, early onset of severe and potentially life\u2010threating NF1 features have been reported, making early screening crucial (Gutmann et al.,  2017 ). The addition of the  NF1  and  SPRED1  genes\u00a0to Noonan spectrum and RASopathy gene panels should reduce the time to diagnosis for such individuals and allow for appropriate medical management. Hence, many clinical laboratories now offer large RASopathy panels that include the  NF1  and  SPRED1 , and this study quantifies the diagnostic yield of such testing.",
  "results": "3.1 Positive findings Testing of the  NF1  and  SPRED1  genes\u00a0in 28 patients in the derivation cohort revealed six (21%) patients with likely pathogenic or pathogenic variants. Proband 6 had a likely pathogenic variant in the  SPRED1 , and Probands 1\u20135 had a pathogenic or likely pathogenic  NF1  variant: one full gene deletion, two frameshift variants, and two missense variants (Table  1 ). Sequencing of all 14 RASopathy\u2010associated genes in the 505 patients in the validation cohort identified 11 (2%) patients with disease\u2010causing variants (Table  2 ) and 15 (3%) patients with a VUS ( n \u00a0=\u00a011) or VUS\u2010likely benign ( n \u00a0=\u00a04) (Table  S2 ) in the  NF1  or  SPRED1 \u00a0genes. One patient (Proband 17) with a clinical suspicion of NF1 had the pathogenic c.4232T>C variant in  SPRED1 . Likely pathogenic or pathogenic variants in  NF1  included one deletion of the entire  NF1  gene, one splice variant, two nonsense variants, one in\u2010frame deletion, and three missense variants (Table  2 ). Adding  NF1  and  SPRED1  to the panel increased the diagnostic yield from 23.5% (119/505) to 25.7% (130/505).",
  "discussion": "5 CONCLUSION Adding the  NF1  and  SPRED1  genes to Noonan spectrum disorder/RASopathy NGS gene panels modestly increases clinical diagnoses without significantly increasing the VUS burden. Since a diagnosis of NF1 or LS would change patient management,  NF1  and  SPRED1  should be included on all Noonan spectrum disorder/RASopathy NGS gene panels.",
