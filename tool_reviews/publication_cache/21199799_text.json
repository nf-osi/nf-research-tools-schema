Author information: (1)Department of Radiation Oncology, University of California, San Francisco,  California 94158, USA. jnakamura@radonc.ucsf.edu  Secondary malignant neoplasms (SMN) are increasingly common complications of  cancer therapy that have proven difficult to model in mice. Clinical  observations suggest that the development of SMN correlates with radiation dose;  however, this relationship has not been investigated systematically. We  developed a novel procedure for administering fractionated cranial irradiation  (CI) and investigated the incidence and spectrum of cancer in control and  heterozygous Nf1 mutant mice irradiated to a moderate (15 Gy) or high dose (30  Gy). Heterozygous Nf1 inactivation cooperated with CI to induce solid tumors and  myeloid malignancies, with mice developing many of the most common SMNs found in  human patients. CI-induced malignancies segregated according to radiation dose  as Nf1(+/-) mice developed predominately hematologic abnormalities after 15 Gy,  whereas solid tumors predominated at 30 Gy, suggesting that radiation dose  thresholds exist for hematologic and nonhematologic cancers. Genetic and  biochemical studies revealed discrete patterns of somatic Nf1 and Trp53  inactivation and we observed hyperactive Ras signaling in many radiation-induced  solid tumors. This technique for administering focal fractionated irradiation  will facilitate mechanistic and translational studies of SMNs.  © 2011 AACR.
