  "title": "Analysis of muscle tissue in vivo using fiber-optic autofluorescence and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy.",
  "abstract": "SIGNIFICANCE: Current methods for analyzing pathological muscle tissue are time consuming and rarely quantitative, and they involve invasive biopsies. Faster and less invasive diagnosis of muscle disease may be achievable using marker-free in vivo optical sensing methods. AIM: It was speculated that changes in the biochemical composition and structure of muscle associated with pathology could be measured quantitatively using visible wavelength optical spectroscopy techniques enabling automated classification. APPROACH: A fiber-optic autofluorescence (AF) and diffuse reflectance (DR) spectroscopy device was manufactured. The device and data processing techniques based on principal component analysis were validated using in situ measurements on healthy skeletal and cardiac muscle. These methods were then applied to two mouse models of genetic muscle disease: a type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF1) limb-mesenchyme knockout (Nf1Prx1\u2009\u2009-\u2009\u2009/\u2009\u2009-\u2009\u2009) and a muscular dystrophy mouse (mdx). RESULTS: Healthy skeletal and cardiac muscle specimens were separable using AF and DR with receiver operator curve areas (ROC-AUC) of >0.79. AF and DR analyses showed optically separable changes in Nf1Prx1\u2009\u2009-\u2009\u2009/\u2009\u2009-\u2009\u2009 quadriceps muscle (ROC-AUC >0.97) with no differences detected in the heart (ROC-AUC <0.67), which does not undergo gene deletion in this model. Changes in AF spectra in mdx muscle were seen between the 3 week and 10 week time points (ROC-AUC = 0.96) and were not seen in the wild-type controls (ROC-AUC = 0.58). CONCLUSION: These findings support the utility of in vivo fiber-optic AF and DR spectroscopy for the assessment of muscle tissue. This report highlights that there is considerable scope to develop this marker-free optical technology for preclinical muscle research and for diagnostic assessment of clinical myopathies and dystrophies.",

  "methods": "2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Optical System A custom AF/DR system was built using commercially available components. A 200-mW 405-nm laser diode (LD) was used for AF measurements, coupled via a servo-actuated shutter, bandpass filter (FB405-10, Thorlabs), and microscope lens into one of seven multimode optical fibers (  core diameter and 0.39 NA) within a fan-out style bundle (BF72HS01, Thorlabs) terminating distally in a six-around-one configuration [ 200 - \u03bc m Fig.\u00a01(a) ]. The shutter allowed the laser power to ramp-up and stabilize before each measurement, while illumination power, set to 20\u00a0mW, was controlled by adjusting the coupling between the fiber and LD. Tissue AF emission was collected using the bundle\u2019s central fiber and long pass filtered at 425\u00a0nm (DMLP425, Thorlabs) to remove the illumination wavelength before detection by a USB spectrometer with a wavelength range of 345 to 1041\u00a0nm (USB 4000, Ocean Optics). Fig. 1 (a)\u00a0Schematic of the fiber-optic AF/DR system. 405-nm laser (violet) and halogen lamp (yellow) light sources were coupled into proximal ends of two multimode (MM) optical fibers via servo-mechanical shutters and a bandpass (BP) filter to further narrow the AF excitation wavelength range. Tissue DR and AF light was collected via a central fiber at the probe\u2019s distal end (red) and passed through a 425-nm long-pass (LP) filter before detection at the spectrometer. Additional fibers within the fiber-optic probe (white) were unused. (b)\u00a0The fiber-optic probe head was positioned directly onto the muscle surface during optical measurements, here showing a DR measurement on the murine gastrocnemius. A stabilized tungsten\u2013halogen light source (SLS201L/M, Thorlabs) was used for DR measurements, coupled via a servo-actuated shutter and microscope lens into a fiber adjacent to the 405-nm LD [ Fig.\u00a01(a) ]. Diffusely reflected light was collected using the same central fiber as for AF measurement and returned to the same spectrometer via the same optical path. The four remaining fibers within the bundle were unused. System control and data collection were performed on a PC laptop using MATLAB (Mathworks) via direct USB connection to the filter wheel and spectrometer. An Arduino was used for transistor\u2013transistor logic and pulse-width modulation signals for control of the LD and shutter servos, respectively. 2.2 Animal Ethics and Husbandry C57BL/6 mice (B6) and   mice (NF1) were bred in-house at the Transgenic Facility at The Children\u2019s Hospital at Westmead. B6 mice were originally sourced from the Animal Resources Centre (ARC, Perth), and the NF1 mice bred from the  N f 1 P r x 1 \u2212 / \u2212 Prx1-Cre  transgenic mice  and the  42  mice. N f 1 f l o x / f l o x \n 43  were bred on a B6 background. The  N f 1 P r x 1 \u2212 / \u2212 mdx  mice (B10 mdx ) were sourced from Australian Bioresources (ABR, Moss Vale). As these mice are on a C57BL/10 background, wild-type mice (B10WT) of this strain were also sourced from ABR. These studies were approved by the local Animal Ethics Committee under protocol K319. 2.3 In-Vivo  Measurements Measurements were made across six groups of mice defined by their genetic strain and age: B6 at 10 weeks of age, NF1 at 10 weeks, B10WT at 3 and 10 weeks (B10WT-3 weeks/10 weeks), and B10 mdx  at 3 and 10 weeks (B10 mdx -3 weeks/10 weeks). Each group comprised five mice, from which multiple measurements were taken across different muscle groups and the left and right sides. Mice were euthanized immediately prior to measurement by   asphyxiation. The quadriceps (Quad), tibialis anterior (TA), and gastrocnemius (Gastr) of both hind limbs were exposed using surgical scissors, removing outer connective tissues including the superficial fascia. The distal tip of the optical fiber bundle was positioned in the center of and in direct contact with each muscle [ CO 2 Fig.\u00a01(b) ], and AF/DR measurements, including background measurements without illumination for calibration, were made successively. Measurements were made on each muscle in triplicate, lifting and repositioning the probe on the same muscle for each repetition. Following a sternotomy, the heart was exposed for a further set of measurements on the lateral edge of the left and right ventricles. 2.4 Histology Muscle tissues were harvested from all mice following optical measurement. These tissues were surface coated in Tissue-Tek \u00ae  O.C.T. Compound (Sakura Finetek), frozen in liquid nitrogen supercooled isopentane (2-methyl butane), and stored at  .  \u2212 80 \u00b0 C  sections were cut on a Leica CM1950 Clinical Cryostat, captured on Superfrost\u2122 Plus Microscope Slides (Fisher Scientific), and stored at 4\u00b0C prior to staining. H&E and Oil Red O staining were performed as previously published. 8 - \u03bc m 18 2.5 Optical Data Preprocessing All data processing and analysis were performed in MATLAB (Mathworks). All spectra were calibrated by subtraction of corresponding background spectra to remove the influence of ambient room light. DR spectra were further calibrated to account for the broadband source spectrum as measured from a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) block, such that  , where  X = ( X R \u2212 B ) / W  is the calibrated spectrum,  X  is the measured tissue spectrum,  X R  is the background spectrum taken from the tissue without illumination, and  B  is the PTFE spectrum. PTFE is known to have a flat reflectance spectrum across the visible and near-infrared region and is hence highly suitable as a white reference material. W  Calibrated spectra with 3648-data points corresponding to each detection wavelength of the spectrometer were then smoothed using a moving average filter with a window size of 10\u00a0nm. AF and DR spectra were then windowed between 435 to 900\u00a0nm and 450 to 900\u00a0nm, respectively, to remove artifacts and noise at the spectral extremes. An analysis based on spectral shape rather than original calibrated intensities was speculated to be less affected by probe contact quality and light source intensity fluctuations. Calibrated spectral data were normalized to the wavelength of maximum intensity such that  44 , where  X N = X / max ( X )  is the normalized spectrum. Spectra were then grouped into matrices according to their animal- or muscle-group class labels, enabling the comparison of any combination of genotype, muscle group, and age as required for subsequent analyses. X N 2.6 Optical Feature Extraction Dimensionality reduction of spectral matrices was achieved using principal component analysis (PCA)  similar to other studies 45 46 ,  as detailed in  47 Supplemental Methods 1 . This method removes noise from the dataset and allows the visualization of important spectral regions that account for variance in the original dataset. Manual feature extraction methods, e.g., calculating intensities at specific wavelengths of interest, ratios of intensities at different wavelengths, 32 ,  integrated spectral intensity, 48  or analyzing derivatives, 32  were avoided to prevent significant loss of variance and potential nonorthogonality between features. For each dataset, spectral features known as principal components (PCs) were extracted, with each being a linear combination of the detection wavelengths. Low variance-explaining PCs were discarded to leave the first three PCs onto which each original observation was projected to give a score matrix with three variables per observation. A preliminary investigation indicated that the first three PCs explained a sufficient percentage of total variance ( 49 ) when applied to normalized AF and DR measurements across each muscle type in the B6 mouse group ( > 97 % Supplemental Methods 2 ). Normalization of calibrated spectral data provided improved separation of measurement scores enabling better classification accuracy, as has been demonstrated in other studies. 46 2.7 Classification Model A quadratic discriminant classifier (QDC)  was then used for classification of the PC score matrices. For each classification task, a QDC was trained using fivefold cross validation as described in  50 Supplemental Methods 1 . The area under the curve of the model\u2019s receiver operator curve (ROC-AUC) was used as a general measure of prediction accuracy. 51",

  "introduction": "1 Introduction Optical technologies capable of real-time quantitative analysis of tissue structure and biochemical composition have the potential to revolutionize medical diagnostics. Histology is the gold standard for clinical diagnostics, but it can often involve painfully invasive biopsies, long turn-around times, and qualitative decision making. Established noninvasive imaging technologies, such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound, offer faster, reliable, and easily interpreted anatomical data with some compositional information. However, these modalities suffer from a variety of limitations including long acquisition times, ionizing radiation exposure, poor contrast between soft tissue types, the need for use of exogenous contrast agents, and large and expensive hardware. 1 \u2013  Alongside these methods, a range of optical techniques that utilize custom-engineered exogenous fluorescent markers of disease have emerged; these include small molecule organic fluorophores, 3  quantum dots, 4  carbon nanotubes, 5  and various other nanomaterials. 6 7 ,  However, considerable scope remains for developing minimally invasive spectroscopic devices [e.g., based on autofluorescence (AF) or diffuse reflectance (DR)] that can be used in the absence of specific probes or dyes. 8 AF spectroscopy involves exposure of tissues to monochromatic ultraviolet (UV) or visible light and the collection of the Stokes-shifted spontaneous emission spectrum that originates from endogenous fluorophores. Naturally fluorescent biological molecules include a variety of amino acids, structural proteins, enzymes, coenzymes, vitamins, lipids, and porphyrins, each of which possesses distinctive excitation/emission spectra. 9 ,  Their distributions vary between tissue types, and their individual fluorescence properties can be affected by their molecular environment, 10  pH, 11  and temperature, 12  making AF spectroscopy a powerful diagnostic tool. This may be complemented by DR spectroscopy, which uses broad-spectrum illumination and detection of diffusely reflected photons over the same wavelength range. DR spectroscopy is sensitive to absorption by endogenous chromophores, including hemoglobin and myoglobin, 13  as well as light scattering from micron-scale structures, such as cell membranes, nuclei, and mitochondria. 14 15 In this study, we aimed to investigate the utility of AF/DR spectroscopy in the context of muscle disease. Myopathies represent a major disease burden in which early diagnosis can be immensely helpful in terms of future clinical management. Myopathies have numerous characteristic histological features that are currently difficult to detect  in situ  and can only be reliably identified using invasive biopsies. Evidence of a congenital myopathy can be seen in the presence of nemaline rods,  fiber-type disproportion, 16  intramyocellular lipid, 17  Z-line streaming, and sarcomeric disruption. 18  Muscular dystrophies often involve adipocyte or fibrotic invasion, the presence of which can correlate with progressive muscle weakness. 19  Both quantitative and qualitative histology techniques exist; 20 20 ,  however, both are time consuming, and biopsy collection is associated with tissue morbidity, pain, infection risk, long turn-around times, and error-prone logistics. 21 22 There is reason to expect that a spectroscopic approach will be effective in characterizing muscle tissue. In skeletal muscle, unique AF signatures of individual myofiber types have been demonstrated, enabling classification of whole muscle types with unique heterogeneous myofiber compositions. 23 \u2013  Differences in their metabolic biochemistry are thought to alter the fluorescence properties of mitochondrial fluorophores including nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), as well as some essential amino acids including tyrosine and tryptophan. This technique may also be applicable to detecting changes in muscle composition with disease and aging. Nakae et\u00a0al. 25  demonstrated the accumulation of fluorescent lipofuscin granules from oxidative breakdown of cellular macromolecules in human and murine dystrophic and aged myofibers detectable with visible wavelength AF microscopy. Further, the sensitivity of AF spectroscopy to muscle fat and collagenous tissues 26 25 ,  may be relevant to the diagnosis of muscle diseases for which intracellular adiposity and fibrosis are phenotypes. 27 18 , 28 A current barrier to widespread use of this technique is a lack of economical, accessible, and easy-to-use platforms that integrate AF/DR spectroscopy with relevant and easily interpretable spectral analyses. In principle, such an approach is feasible and supported by a range of studies characterizing tissue AF in the gut, arteries, and myocardium 29 \u2013  and in tumors. 31 32 \u2013  AF spectroscopy has also been employed in conjunction with DR spectroscopy in a range of settings. 35 36 \u2013  Athough there is currently a lack of information on the use of AF/DR spectroscopy within the specific context of diseased muscle tissue, AF/DR probes have been developed to identify commercial meat cut quality based on intermuscular collagen and adipose content. 39 14 , 25 , 27 In this study, we describe a fiber-optic AF/DR system and speculate that both modalities may be capable of real-time marker-free classification of healthy and diseased skeletal muscle tissues. The system was trialed using several established preclinical models of muscle pathology. The  mdx  mice are a widely used model of muscular dystrophy that feature a mutation in the murine  dystrophin  gene.  Like in the clinical scenario,  40 mdx  mice exhibit a refractory period in which they are asymptomatic before developing muscle weakness. The   mouse line is a limb-specific knockout mouse line in which the NF1 gene is deleted in mesenchymal tissues including muscle. N f 1 P r x 1 \u2212 / \u2212  NF1 is critical for muscle development and function, and NF1-deficient muscle features intramyocellular lipid accumulation and fibrosis. 41 18 ,  Data preprocessing and classification techniques were first optimized with the goal of classifying optical measurements from different muscles groups in healthy wild-type mice before these techniques were applied to the classification of muscle tissues from mouse models of muscle pathology. These results were compared with standard histological techniques for muscle assessment. 28",
  "results": "3 Results 3.1 AF and DR Spectra Enable Separation of Different Muscle Types in Wild-Type Mice It was hypothesized that different muscle groups that contain different fiber types and cytoskeletal proteins would produce different AF and DR spectra. Measurements were made from several murine hind limb muscles (gastrocnemius, quadriceps, and tibialis anterior) as well as from cardiac muscle from the same animals. Statistical analysis of normalized spectra was applied to generate 95% confidence intervals (CIs), which indicated the separability of each muscle group at each detection wavelength. For AF measurements, overlapping CIs were observed across all wavelengths for skeletal muscle groups, whereas cardiac muscle showed significantly different spectral shape to skeletal muscles across the 500 to 600\u00a0nm range [ Fig.\u00a02(a) ]. For DR measurements, overlapping CIs were observed across all wavelengths for all skeletal muscle groups, whereas cardiac muscle was separable from only quadriceps and gastrocnemius groups at  , and from tibialis anterior only between 630 and 895\u00a0nm [ \u223c 560 \u2009\u2009 nm Fig.\u00a02(e) ]. Fig. 2 (a)\u2013(d)\u00a0AF and (e)\u2013(h)\u00a0DR spectroscopy enabled classification of muscle types (Quad, Gastr, TA, and heart) in healthy B6 mice using PCA. (a), (e)\u00a0Average normalized spectra (solid lines) show spectral differences between quadriceps, gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, and cardiac muscle (95% CIs shown by dotted lines and shaded areas). (b), (f)\u00a0Coefficient weightings of each principal component describe sources of variance across all wavelengths, including each PC\u2019s total percentage explained variance (see legend). (c), (g)\u00a0PC1 and PC2 scores show clustering of muscle types, which enabled their classification using decision boundaries (shaded regions) designed by a QDC. (d), (h)\u00a0Classification ROC curves provide a quantitative measure of muscle type separability, where an AUC of 1 describes a perfect classifier and 0.5 a weakest classifier (see legend for muscle-specific ROC-AUCs). To enhance muscle group separability and resulting classification accuracy, spectra were dimensionally reduced using PCA. The coefficient weightings for the first three components of AF and DR spectra are shown in  Figs.\u00a02(b)  and  2(f) , respectively, whereby large (non-zero) weightings indicate sources of variance between observations. For AF spectra, prominent weightings were observed at 475, 550, and 650\u00a0nm and for DR spectra at 490 and 570\u00a0nm. These spectral differences caused muscle-type specific clustering of AF and DR PC scores as shown in PC1 versus PC2 score space [ Figs.\u00a02(c)  and  2(g) ]. Skeletal muscles formed mildly overlapping clusters with intercluster variance across both PC1 and PC2, whereas cardiac muscle formed a separate cluster best distinguished from skeletal muscles through PC1 in AF measurements, and PC2 in DR measurements. PC3 variance is not visualized in these figures but was also used for the purpose of classification. The classification of muscle types was performed using a QDC classifier with fivefold cross validation. The classifier\u2019s performance for each muscle type was quantified using the area under the curve (AUC) of its ROC curve [ Figs.\u00a02(d)  and  2(h) ], while its decision boundaries were observed in the PC scores plots [ Figs.\u00a02(c)  and  2(g) ]. The cardiac muscle was well separable from all skeletal muscles in both AF and DR analyses (  and  AUC = 1  for AF and DR, respectively), whereas skeletal muscles (Quad, Gastr, and TA) were less separable with AUCs ranging between 0.79 and 0.99. AUC = 1 3.2 AF/DR Spectra Enable Separation of Healthy Muscle and Muscle Containing Intramyocellular Lipid It was next tested whether AF/DR spectra could separate healthy versus pathological muscle tissue in murine models of muscle disease. NF1 has shown features of a metabolic myopathy,  and histological staining of quadriceps muscle in  52  revealed an accumulation of intramyocellular lipid. N f 1 P r x 1 \u2212 / \u2212 18 ,  Cardiac tissue was included as a negative control as the  28 Prx1  promoter does not allow for expression in the heart. Analysis was performed on B6 and NF1 mice (10 weeks) using AF and DR measurements ( Fig.\u00a03 ). Fig. 3 (a)\u2013(d)\u00a0AF and (e)\u2013(h)\u00a0DR spectroscopy of quadriceps muscle enables classification of NF1 mice from B6 controls (both 10 weeks) using PCA scores; however, when applied to cardiac muscle, the same analysis yields no separability. Normalized AF spectra of (a)\u00a0quadriceps and (c)\u00a0cardiac muscle in B6 and NF1 mice with [(b), (d)]\u00a0corresponding PC score and QDC decision boundary plots. Normalized DR spectra of (e)\u00a0quadriceps and (g)\u00a0cardiac muscle in B6 and NF1 mice with [(f), (h)]\u00a0corresponding PC score and QDC decision boundary plots. Normalized AF spectra from B6 and NF1 quadricep muscles showed significantly different means (  between  p < 0.05  and 720\u00a0nm) [ \u223c 450 Fig.\u00a03(a) ]. NF1 DR spectra showed a more pronounced absorption feature between 500 and 600\u00a0nm, whereas both mouse groups showed different means across the entire wavelength range ( ). Both AF and DR demonstrated strong quadriceps separability as indicated by distinct PC score clustering [ p < 0.05 Figs.\u00a03(b)  and,  3(f) ] and QDC classifier AUC\u2019s of 0.99 and 0.97, respectively. B6 and NF1 cardiac muscle showed similar spectral shapes and the same mean normalized intensity across almost all wavelengths for both AF and DR ( ) [ p > 0.05 Figs.\u00a03(c)  and  3(g) ]. This similarity resulted in overlapping PC score clusters [ Figs.\u00a03(d)  and  3(h) ] and poor QDC classification performance with ROC-AUCs of 0.67 and 0.63 for AF and DR, respectively.  NF1  muscle histology ( Fig.\u00a04 ) showed endomysial fibrosis and intramyocellular lipid by H&E and Oil Red O staining, respectively, consistent with prior findings. 18 Fig. 4 Histopathology of quadriceps muscle from 10-week-old NF1 mice differs from that observed in B6 mice. H&E staining shows endomysial fibrosis, and Oil Red O staining illustrates the intramyocellular lipid seen in NF1 mice. Scale bars indicate  . 200 \u2009\u2009 \u03bc m 3.3 AF/DR Spectra Provide Separation of In Predystrophic and Dystrophic Muscle A similar analysis was performed on B10 mdx  mouse groups at two different time points using the B10WT groups as controls. At 3 weeks,  mdx  mice are known to be asymptomatic and show no major histological features of dystrophy. By 10 weeks,  mdx  mice show centralized nuclei and fibrosis characteristic of dystrophic muscle. It was queried whether any fundamental differences in the AF/DR spectra would be apparent in  mdx  mice before histological features were apparent, as well as at later stages of muscle degeneration/regeneration. AF and DR measurements were made on the quadriceps of B10WT and B10 mdx  mice at 3 and 10 weeks [ Figs.\u00a05(a)  and  5(d) ]. The PCA-QDC method was again used to test separability of different pairs of these groups. First, B10WT groups at 3 and 10 weeks were compared. Both groups showed similar AF spectral features [ Fig.\u00a05(a) ] with overlapping PC Score clusters [ Fig.\u00a05(b) ] making them indistinguishable to the QDC [ Fig.\u00a05(c) ] with an ROC   ( AUC = 0.58 Table\u00a01 ). DR measurements provided better separability,  . In contrast, B10 AUC = 0.83 mdx  at 3 and 10 weeks showed differences in AF spectral features resulting in strong classifier performance,  , whereas DR spectra were only modestly separable,  AUC = 0.96 . Further comparisons were made between control B10WT and B10 AUC = 0.77 mdx  mice, both at 3 weeks, with strong AF separability,   and with more modest DR separability,  AUC = 0.98 . Finally, B10WT and B10 AUC = 0.73 mdx  mice were compared at 10 weeks, with similar results to that of 3 weeks, with stronger separability using AF,   and modest separability using DR,  AUC = 0.87 . AUC = 0.77 Fig. 5 (a)\u2013(c)\u00a0AF and (d)\u2013(f)\u00a0DR spectroscopy on quadriceps muscle enabled classification of  mdx  mice from B10 controls using PCA at both 3 week and 10 week time points. Normalized AF and DR spectra (top row) indicate differences in optical properties between these groups. These differences are highlighted by clustering in PCA space (middle row) as well as in their classification ROC curves (bottom row). Table 1 DC ROC-AUC metrics for pairwise classification of B10WT and B10 mdx  mouse groups at 3 and 10 weeks. AUCs were used as a measure of class separability, where   = strong separability,  AUC > 0.9  = modest separability, and  0.9 > AUC > 0.7  = poor separability.

  "discussion": "5 Conclusion We describe the design of a minimally invasive marker-free method of optical spectroscopy suitable to the real-time  in vivo  analysis of muscle tissue. The system was implemented in healthy and diseased mouse tissues, including models of muscle myopathy seen with NF1-deficiency in mice and muscular dystrophy caused by  dystrophin  deficiency. Statistically transparent spectral analysis methods based on feature extraction by PCA and a QDC proved capable of distinguishing between healthy skeletal muscle types and diseased tissues. These data show the feasibility of using a fibre-optic AF and DR spectrometry system to characterize muscle tissue and underlying disease. This study serves as a strong proof-of-principle for further development of hardware and data analysis methods for clinical translation. To date these findings are largely empirical, and further study of autofluorescent macromolecules will be needed to appreciate the mechanisms underlying these spectral changes.",
