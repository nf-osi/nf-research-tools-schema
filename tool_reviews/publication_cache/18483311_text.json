Author information: (1)Division of Experimental Hematology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati,  OH, USA.  Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are chemoresistant sarcomas  with poor 5-year survival that arise in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1  (NF1) or sporadically. We tested three drugs for single and combinatorial  effects on collected MPNST cell lines and in MPNST xenografts. The mammalian  target of rapamycin complex 1 inhibitor RAD001 (Everolimus) decreased growth 19%  to 60% after 4 days of treatment in NF1 and sporadic-derived MPNST cell lines.  Treatment of subcutaneous sporadic MPNST cell xenografts with RAD001  significantly, but transiently, delayed tumor growth, and decreased vessel  permeability within xenografts. RAD001 combined with the epidermal growth factor  receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib caused additional inhibitory  effects on growth and apoptosis in vitro, and a small but significant additional  inhibitory effect on MPNST growth in vivo that were larger than the effects of  RAD001 with doxorubicin. RAD001 plus erlotinib, in vitro and in vivo, reduced  phosphorylation of AKT and total AKT levels, possibly accounting for their  additive effect. The results support the consideration of RAD001 therapy in NF1  patient and sporadic MPNST. The preclinical tests described allow rapid  screening strata for drugs that block MPNST growth, prior to tests in more  complex models, and should be useful to identify drugs that synergize with  RAD001.
