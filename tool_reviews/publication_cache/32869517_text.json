  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a tumor-predisposition disorder that arises due to pathogenic variants in tumor suppressor NF1. NF1 has variable expressivity that may be due, at least in part, from heritable elements such as modifier genes; however, few genetic modifiers have been identified to date. METHODS: In this study, we performed a genome-wide association analysis of the number of caf\u00e9-au-lait macules (CALM) that are considered a tumor-like trait as a clinical phenotype modifying NF1. RESULTS: A borderline genome-wide significant association was identified in the discovery cohort (CALM1, N\u00a0=\u00a0112) between CALM number and rs12190451 (and rs3799603, r CONCLUSION: rs12190451 is located in a melanocyte-specific enhancer and may influence RPS6KA2 expression in melanocytes-warranting further functional studies.",

All participants provided written informed consent prior to joining the studies. The NCI Special Studies IRB also approved the overall GWAS. The study was carried out according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Quantitative trait caf\u00e9\u2010au\u2010lait macule count data were collected from two cohorts, CALM1 (CALM number counted by DRS) and CALM2 (CALM number counted by AB), as described previously (Pemov et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 2014 ). Most of the patients in the CALM1 cohort were adults, while most patients in the CALM2 cohort were children (Table\u00a0 1 ). All patients in the CALM2 cohort underwent whole\u2010body MRI and had at least one plexiform neurofibroma. In both cohorts, all CALMs\u00a0\u2265\u00a05\u00a0mm in longest diameter were counted. A Wood's lamp, which makes CALMs more visible, was used for CALM counting in CALM1, but not in CALM2. The log\u2010transformed CALM number, log 10  (CALM\u00a0+\u00a010), was analyzed adjusting for age, sex and body surface area (m 2 )   defined as in Mosteller,\u00a0 = ( weight(kg) \u00b7 height ( cm ) ) / 60 1987 . Differences in age, sex, body surface, and CALM number were compared by two\u2010sided  t \u2010test in R assuming unequal variance between cohorts.

John Wiley & Sons, Ltd 2.2 Genotypes for CALM1 samples for GWAS Genotyping for the CALM1 samples was performed on Illumina Infinium HumanOmni\u20101Quad bead\u2010chips. SNPs from 22 autosomes were included if the SNP GenTrain score was >0.3 and minor allele frequency (MAF) was >0 (non\u2010monomorphic). Samples with genotyping rate \u226599% and calling rate \u226599% were retained. Cryptic relatedness and population stratification were checked with multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis estimating pairwise identity by descent (IBD) for all pairs of founders using independent SNPs in PLINK (Purcell et al., 2007). SNPs with MAF\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.2 in founders were pruned for independence, first with pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) correlation measure  r \n 2 \u00a0<\u00a00.2 within 50 SNPs, then again within 200 SNPs. Lastly, SNPs with MAF\u00a0<\u00a00.1 in European\u2013Americans were excluded. The quality control protocol yielded 608,561 SNPs in 112 European\u2013Americans with non\u2010missing CALM number. The CALM1 cohort included 57 unrelated individuals, 16 families with 2 members each, 5 families with 3 members each, and 2 families with 4 members each. 2.3 Genotypes for CALM2 samples for GWAS Genotyping for the replication cohort CALM2 samples was performed on Illumina Infinium Omni2.5 bead\u2010chips. Quality control measures were performed as described above although the retention rates for genotyping and calling rates were both lowered to \u226598% due to the smaller sample size. Samples with genotyping rate <95% from remaining European\u2013Americans and SNPs with MAF\u00a0<\u00a00.2 were excluded\u2014yielding 623,562 SNPs in 59 European\u2013Americans with non\u2010missing CALM number, including two sibling pairs. To ensure compatibility between the genotyping data between the two cohorts, LitfOver (Hinrichs et al.,  2006 ) was used to convert genome positions in the CALM1 cohort (NCBI build 36, UCSC hg18) to corresponding positions in the CALM2 cohort (NCBI build 37 (UCSC hg19). 2.4 Targeted sequencing of candidate loci Targeted sequencing of candidate loci was carried out in 171 European\u2013American samples using the AmpliSeq/IonTorrent platform, as per the manufacturer's instructions. A genotype was considered missing if its genotype quality score (GQ) was <10, its read depth (DP) score was <10 or the ratio of the genotype quality score (GQ) divided by genotype read depth (DP), GQ/DP was <0.5. Monomorphic SNPs and SNPs with a calling rate <90% and samples with a genotyping rate <90% were excluded leaving 176 SNPs in 157 samples. Quality control for targeted gene sequencing data was done using SNP & Variation Suite v8.3.4 ( http://goldenhelix.com/products/SNP_Variation/index.html ) and PLINK (Purcell et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 2007 ). 2.5 Tests of association In each cohort, tests of association between each SNP and log\u2010transformed CALM number, adjusted for age, sex, and body surface area, were performed with EMMAX (Kang et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 2010 ) with an IBS kinship matrix considering possible spurious association due to genetic relatedness. Simple linear regression (SLR) ignoring genetic relatedness was also performed; these results are not shown because the correlations of the  p \u2010values for EMMAX and SLR for the CALM1 and CALM2 cohorts were 0.95 and 0.99, respectively. In the targeted gene sequencing samples, tests of association were performed by SLR between each SNP in  RPS6KA2  (OMIM 601685; GenBank  NM_021135.6 ) and the log\u2010transformed CALM number, adjusted for age, sex, and body surface area, for the CALM1 and CALM2 cohorts, both separately and combined. An additional covariate, cohort (CALM1, CALM2), as well as age, sex, and body surface area were adjusted in the mega analysis for combined\u2010targeted gene sequencing data. Candidate loci were defined as those with suggestive genome\u2010wide significance ( p  <1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22125 ) in the GWAS of either cohort or in the meta\u2010analysis. 2.6 Meta\u2010analysis Meta\u2010analyses between the CALM1 and CALM2 cohort studies were performed with METAL (Willer, Li, & Abecasis,\u00a0 2010 ) with weights proportional to the square\u2010root of the sample size for each study (Stouffer, Suchman, Devinney, Star, & Williams,  1949 ), with genomic control correction of input statistics enabled. Heterogeneity analyses including I 2  statistics, the percentage of variation between cohorts due to heterogeneity rather than chance, were also performed in meta\u2010analyses. 2.7 ComPaSS\u2010GWAS analysis The second approach for corroboration of SNP associations used ComPaSS\u2010GWAS (Sabourin et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 2018 ), a method based on complementary pairs stability selection (Shah & Samworth,  2013 ) with a regression based GWAS analysis. ComPaSS\u2010GWAS approximates replication by randomly splitting a sample in half (into a pseudo\u2010discovery and pseudo\u2010replication set) multiple times and looking for corroboration of results between each random split. ComPaSS\u2010GWAS returns a corroboration score between 0 and 1, indicating the proportion of random splits where the SNPs were corroborated for the specified within\u2010split significance parameter. The primary focus of ComPaSS\u2010GWAS is for situations where appropriate independent replication data are either not available or when the replication cohort is too small to sufficiently bolster the primary cohort's findings in a meta\u2010analysis. ComPaSS\u2010GWAS may also be useful when heterogeneity between the cohorts affects the ability of a meta\u2010analysis to produce confident results. A high ComPaSS\u2010GWAS score in a single cohort could also indicate that the lack of replication may be a result of the differences in cohorts rather than the individual cohort analysis result being a false positive. In this study, ComPaSS\u2010GWAS scores were obtained using a within\u2010split significance parameter of 10 \u22123  based on 100 random splits. Simulations have shown (Sabourin et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 2018 ) that a ComPaSS\u2010GWAS score of 0.6 is comparable to a traditional genome\u2010wide association significance level ( p  < 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22128 ). ComPaSS\u2010GWAS score greater than 0.4 and less than 0.6 are considered to be suggestively significant findings. 2.8 LD structures Haploview 4.2 (Barrett, Fry, Maller, & Daly,\u00a0 2005 ) was used to generate LD plots across the genome based on D\u2019 and  r \n 2  values to evaluate LD structures among significant SNPs variants in Table\u00a0 2  for each cohort.

John Wiley & Sons, Ltd 2.9 Functional annotation and quantitative\u2010trait loci analysis of SNPs Custom tracks on the UCSC Genome browser ( http://genome.ucsc.edu ) were used to screen NIH Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE experimental data containing the SNP regions of interest for evidence for regulatory relevance in normal skin cells (melanocytes, fibroblasts and keratinocytes). The online tools HaploReg ( http://www.broadinstitute.org/mammals/haploreg/haploreg.php ) and RegulomeDB ( http://regulome.stanford.edu ) were used as complementary analyses and to confirm the location of each SNP in relation to protein\u2010coding and/or non\u2010coding RNA genes. While many regulatory regions can act in a tissue\u2010specific manner, it is unknown whether variants in such regions also have tissue\u2010specific effects, and complex phenotypes are often caused by dysfunction of multiple tissues or cell type. This suggests the potential for the involvement of skin and other tissues/cells such as blood (immunity) and fibroblasts (regulatory role in pigmentation) in CALM phenotype. To evaluate if a SNP could influence gene expression  in\u2010cis  or act as an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in blood and skin tissues, all coding genes were identified that mapped within \u00b11\u00a0Mb of the index SNPs (associated SNPs of interest). eQTL results for all CALM\u2010associated SNPs and collated genes based on 749 normal skin tissues (414 sun\u2010exposed and 335 non\u2010sun\u2010exposed), 369 normal blood samples and 300 transformed fibroblast cell lines were then extracted from GTEx (V7, dbGaP Accession phs000424.v7.p2), (12 lead index SNPs and 1 surrogate variant in perfect LD). In addition, the influence of a SNP on metabolite levels in blood was evaluated by extraction of association results for each SNP and metabolites in blood from the Metabolomics GWAS ( http://metabolomics.helmholtz\u2010muenchen.de/gwas/ ).",

  "introduction": "1 INTRODUCTION Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common, monogenic tumor\u2010predisposition disorder that arises due to germline pathogenic variation in  NF1  (OMIM 613113). The protein product of  NF1 , neurofibromin, regulates the conversion of the active form of RAS (RAS\u2010GTP) to its inactive form (RAS\u2010GDP; Welti, D'Angelo, & Scheffzek,  2008 ). Individuals haplo\u2010insufficient for  NF1  have increased levels of RAS\u2010GTP, dysregulation of cell growth, and thus have an increased risk of a variety of benign and malignant tumors, predominantly of the central and peripheral nervous system (e.g., neurofibromas, pilocytic astrocytomas, optic pathway gliomas; Huson,\u00a0 2008 ). Soft\u2010tissue sarcomas (malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, rhabdomyosarcomas), neuroendocrine tumors (somatostatinomas, pheochromocytomas), and leukemia (juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia) are also associated with NF1 (Brems, Beert, de Ravel, & Legius,\u00a0 2009 ). Although the first, modern medical description of NF1 was published in 1882 by von Recklinghausen, novel tumor associations continue to be discovered, including gastrointestinal stromal tumors (Stewart et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 2007 ), glomus tumors (Brems, Park, et al.,  2009 ), and breast cancer (Sharif et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 2007 ; Uusitalo et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 2016 ). NF1 has variable expressivity, even among members of the same family. This phenotypic complexity probably derives from multiple etiologies (e.g., epigenetic phenomena and stochastic events) as well as from heritable elements, such as modifier genes (Carey & Viskochil,\u00a0 1999 ). There is clinical evidence that modifier genes are a major component of phenotypic variation in NF1. Easton, Ponder, Huson, and Ponder ( 1993 ) first examined intra\u2010familial correlation in phenotypic features (Easton et al.,  1993 ). In that study, among six pairs of monozygotic twins, the highest correlations were for the number of caf\u00e9\u2010au\u2010lait spots ( r \u00a0=\u00a00.85,  p \u00a0<\u00a0.05) and cutaneous neurofibromas ( r \u00a0=\u00a01.00,  p \u00a0<\u00a0.01). Correlation decreased for first\u2010 and second\u2010degree relatives. Four of the five binary traits studied in that paper also showed significant familial clustering (Easton et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 1993 ). Szudek, Joe, and Friedman ( 2002 ) observed similar patterns of familial correlation that also suggested a role for genetic factors (Szudek et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 2002 ; Szudek et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 2002 ). A statistical analysis of NF1 phenotypes and severity in a French cohort provided additional evidence for the existence of genetic modifiers in NF1 (Sabbagh et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 2009 ). The heritability of caf\u00e9\u2010au\u2010lait macules, a hallmark feature of NF1, was the highest (0.62\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.08) among the traits considered. In people with NF1, CALM number is a phenotype that has a number of advantages: compared to other NF1 clinical features it is relatively stable during patients\u2019 life (although some \u201cfading\u201d is observed), is readily quantifiable and can be non\u2010invasively measured. Moreover, CALMs are \u201ctumor\u2010like\u201d in that they arise from a somatic inactivation (a second hit) of the remaining normal copy of  NF1  in skin melanocytes, which, like the Schwann cells, also originate from the common neural crest cell progenitor (Maertens et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 2007 ). In previous work using a gene expression\u2010based, multi\u2010platform approach, variants were identified in the intergenic region of  DPH2  (OMIM 603456) and  ATP6V0B  (OMIM 603717) and in  MSH6  (OMIM 600678) that influence CALM number in NF1 (Pemov et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 2014 ). In the current work, a genome\u2010wide association study (GWAS) was employed for the first time to identify additional variants associated with CALM number in NF1. Furthermore, the potential functional effects of these variants were evaluated in both normal skin and blood tissues using publicly available databases.",

The cohorts were significantly different with respect to age ( p \u00a0=\u00a02.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u221216 ) and body surface area ( p \u00a0=\u00a06.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u221212 ). Figure\u00a0 1  presents the \u2010log 10 ( p \u2010value) of tests of association using EMMAX on 608,561 SNPs from 112 samples in the CALM1 cohort (top panel) and 623,562 SNPs from 59 samples from the CALM2 cohort (middle panel). The bottom panel presents \u2010log 10 ( p \u2010value) from the meta\u2010analysis of the 322,455 SNPs that were shared in common between the two cohorts. Table\u00a0 2  presents SNPs that were suggestively genome\u2010wide significant ( p \u00a0<\u00a01.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22125 ) using EMMAX for either the CALM1 or CALM2 GWAS or the meta\u2010analysis.  p\u2010 values \u00a0 <\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22125  are shown in bold and italics.

The red horizontal line corresponds to the genome\u2010wide significance level of  p  < 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22128  and the blue line corresponds to suggestive genome\u2010wide significance level of  p  < 1.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22125 \n In the CALM1 cohort GWAS, two SNPs in LD ( r \n 2 \u00a0=\u00a01, D\u2019\u00a0=\u00a01) on chromosome 6, rs12190451 and rs3799603, in the intronic region of  RPS6KA2 , had a borderline genome\u2010wide significant association ( p \u00a0=\u00a07.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22128 ) with CALM number (Figure  S1a , b ). Four additional significant SNP associations in the CALM1 cohort in this intronic region were significant at the suggestive genome\u2010wide level ( p \u00a0<\u00a01.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22125 ). Five of the six SNPs in  RPS6KA2  appeared to be in LD, but rs3799585 was not in high LD ( r \n 2 \u00a0<\u00a00.28, D\u2019=1) with the other SNPs (Figure  S1a , b , Block 2). Figure\u00a0 2  presents a regional visualization of EMMAX results for  RPS6KA2  in CALM1 samples (LocusZoom [Pruim et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 2010 ]). In addition to the six intronic SNPs in  RPS6KA2 , other SNPs that were suggestively significant at a genome\u2010wide association level included: an intergenic SNP on chromosome 3 (rs4856490, near  LINC00971 ), an intergenic SNP on chromosome 7 (rs10215358) residing between  PODXL  and  LOC101928782 , three intergenic SNPs in LD ( r \n 2 \u00a0=\u00a01, D\u2019=1) between  GPR158  and  LINC00836  on chromosome 10 (rs12765442, rs868692, and rs868691) and an exonic SNP in  ADAMTSL3  on chromosome 15 (rs34047645). Figure 2 Regional visualization of EMMAX results for  RPS6KA2 locus  in CALM1 samples. The region in chromosome 6, including  RPS6KA2  and flanking genes is shown (genomic coordinates are in hg19). Individual SNPs depicted with circles. Negative log10  p \u2010values and recombination rate are shown on the left and right vertical axes, respectively. Color code for  r \n 2  values is shown in the inset on the right Similarly, SNPs in the CALM2 cohort SNPs that were suggestively significant at the genome\u2010wide level ( p  < 1.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22125 ) included one intergenic SNP on chromosome 2 (rs4513317 between  PDCL3  and  NPAS2 ); one intergenic SNPs on chromosome 3 (rs7615501 between  RFT1  and  PRKCD ); three intronic SNPs in  ADCY2  on chromosome 5 (rs6872422, rs11742602, rs1025291); and two SNPs in LD ( r \n 2 \u00a0=\u00a01, D\u2019=1) in an intronic region of  LOXHD1  on chromosome 18 (rs8093709, rs732108). The SNPs in  ADCY2  and  LOXHD1  were in high LD within each gene (Figure  [Link] ,  [Link] c,d, Blocks 1 ( r \n 2 \u00a0>\u00a00.7, D\u2019=1) and 3 ( r \n 2 \u00a0=\u00a01, D\u2019=1)). 3.2 Meta\u2010analysis for CALM1 and CALM2 None of the SNPs that were significant at the suggestive level in the CALM1 GWAS were similarly significantly in the CALM2 GWAS. And conversely, none of the SNPs that were significant at the suggestive threshold in the CALM2 GWAS were similarly significantly in the CALM1 GWAS. Three SNPs were suggestively significant in the meta\u2010analysis: rs3799585 and rs10946177 in the  RPS6KA2  gene on chromosome 6 and rs1951646 in the  TTC6  gene on chromosome 14. Of the ten SNPs in common between the two cohorts, eight SNPs had an I 2  statistic, the proportion of the variance between the cohort due to heterogeneity rather than chance, greater than 80%, and three had an I 2  statistic greater than 95% ( p \u00a0<\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22125 ). And, in six of these eight SNPs, the regression coefficients (betas) were opposite in the direction between the two cohorts, although the differences were quite small. 3.3 Cohort heterogeneity In addition to the significant differences between the cohorts for age and body surface area (Table\u00a0 1 ), there were striking differences between the cohorts in terms of the distribution of CALM number and age (Figure\u00a0 3 ). CALM number decreased as age increased in the CALM1 cohort, but CALM number increased with age up to about 18\u00a0years of age in the CALM2 cohort. Linear regression modeling for CALM number versus age for two groups was performed (>18\u00a0years old versus\u00a0\u2264\u00a018\u00a0years old). The model  p \u2010value for the group of 124 NF1 patients older than 18\u00a0years of age (right side of the vertical dashed line) was 1.04\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22128  and the  p \u2010value for the group of 47 NF1 patients less than 18\u00a0years of age (left side of the vertical dashed line) was 0.04, confirming the opposite relationship between CALM number versus age by 18 years of age. Taking into consideration that most of the patients in the CALM1 cohort were older than 18 years and most of the patients in the CALM2 cohort were younger than 18 years (Table\u00a0 1 ), the opposite age distribution for CALM number could contribute to the opposing SNP effects observed in each independent GWAS. These findings suggest that the CALM2 GWAS was not an appropriate replication cohort for the CALM1 GWAS. To address this issue ComPaSS\u2010GWAS was used on each cohort separately.

Samples in CALM1 are depicted with open circles and samples in CALM2 are depicted with asterisks. Vertical dashed line is drawn at age of 18\u00a0years. Age on the X axis is shown in years 3.4 ComPaSS\u2010GWAS for CALM1 and CALM2 ComPaSS\u2010GWAS corroboration scores using EMMAX were obtained for all SNPs, presented in Table\u00a0 2 . In the CALM1 cohort, the two most significant SNPs identified by EMMAX in  RPS6KA2  intron on chromosome 6 (rs3799603 and rs12190451) also had the highest ComPaSS\u2010GWAS corroboration score (0.72). These SNPs were in LD ( r \n 2 \u00a0=\u00a01; D\u2019=1). Similarly, the two most significant SNPs identified by EMMAX in  ADCY2  on chromosome 5 in the CALM2 cohort (rs11742602 and rs1025291) also had the highest ComPaSS\u2010GWAS corroboration scores of 0.75 and 0.67. The ComPaSS\u2010GWAS analyses confirmed the findings by EMMAX within each cohort of CALM1 and CALM2 and suggest that these findings may be replicated if larger more homogeneous samples can be obtained. 3.5 Targeted sequencing of  RPS6KA2 \n Because of the marginally/borderline significant associations in the intronic region of  RPS6KA2 in the CALM1 cohort GWAS, ~24\u2009Kb (chr6:166,995,059\u2013167,018,915) of intron 1 of  RPS6KA2  was sequenced (transcript variant 1,  NM_021135.6 ) in order to investigate other possible variants. There were 15  RPS6KA2  SNPs with suggestive genome\u2010wide significance ( p \u00a0<\u00a01.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22125 ) using simple linear regression (SLR) in the CALM1 cohort. However, no SNP was significant in the CALM2 cohort, or in meta\u2010 or mega\u2010analyses of combined cohorts (Table\u00a0 S1 ). 3.6 Functional annotation of CALM\u2010associated SNPs Using Roadmap and ENCODE experimental data from normal penile foreskin cells (including melanocytes, fibroblasts, and keratinocytes) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, each of the CALM\u2010associated SNPs at  p \u2010value < 1.0 x 10 \u22125  presented in Table\u00a0 2  were annotated and mapped to potential DNA regulatory regions (e.g., transcriptional start site [TSS], enhancers, and DNaseI/open chromatin sites; Table\u00a0 S2 ).  RPS6KA2  rs12190451, rs3778385, and rs4710070 mapped to either an active enhancer or region flanking an active enhancer in penile skin fibroblasts and/or melanocytes. Variation at rs4710070 also altered a CpG dinucleotide.  ADCY2  rs11742602 and  RPS6KA2  rs1025291were located in heterochromatin regions in fibroblasts, keratinocytes and melanocytes. The SNP rs7615501 on chromosome 3 was shown to map to an intergenic promoter region in fibroblasts. SNPs rs4513317 (chromosome 2), rs4856490 (chromosome 3), rs10215358 (chromosome 7), and rs12765442 (chromosome 10) were located in heterochromatin regions in fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and melanocytes. The SNP rs34047645 in exon 18 of  ADAMTSL3  and rs3799603 in intron 1 of  RPS6KA2  (Figure\u00a0 4 ) did not locate to regulatory regions in skin or peripheral blood cells. SNP\u2010containing DNA regions shown to interact with specific transcription factor proteins or alter protein binding motifs are also indicated in Table\u00a0 S2 .

We show here that rs3778385 and rs3799603 (a trans\u2010eQTL for  SOCS5  in monocytes, PMID: 24604202) locate to monocyte\u2010specific promoter regions in open chromatin, but only rs3799603 (tracked by yellow line) can interact with transcription factors (e.g., ELF1 and TCF12). Also, rs12190451 locates to an enhancer\u2010region in melanocytes. For clarity, all SNPs contained in this region according to dbSNP are not shown.

Neither of the two genome\u2010wide significantly\u2010associated SNPs (rs3799603 and rs12190451) in CALM1were identified as potential eQTLs for  RPS6KA2  or other coding genes  in \u2010 cis . Likewise, none of the variants identified by targeted gene sequencing of intron 1 of  RPS6KA2  in Table\u00a0 S1 were eQTLs for  RPS6KA2  or other genes  in \u2010 cis  (data not shown). rs11742602 and rs1025291 which showed the strongest association with CALM number in CALM2 were not eQTLs for  ADCY2  or other genes  in\u2010cis  in the blood or skin tissues examined. In contrast, the C allele (Gly713Arg) of rs34047645 in exon 18 of  ADAMTSL3,  which was associated with CALM number in CALM1 results in significantly lower expression of  GOLGA6L4  (beta\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.41,  p \u00a0=\u00a04.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22125 ) in sun\u2010exposed skin and higher expression of  CSPG4P11  (beta\u00a0=\u00a00.29,  p \u00a0=\u00a07.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22125 ) in not sun\u2010exposed skin. Also, the G allele of the intergenic SNP rs7615501on chromosome 3 which correlated with CALM number in CALM2 resulted in significantly higher expression of  RFT1  (beta 0.15,  p \u00a0=\u00a02.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22125 ) in transformed fibroblasts and sun\u2010exposed skin, and significantly lower expression of  GLT8G1  and  PHF7  in sun\u2010exposed skin (Table\u00a0 S3 ). After correction for multiple comparisons, none of the remaining SNPs were eQTLs for any coding genes  in\u2010cis  in the GTEx tissues examined (Table\u00a0 S3 ). Using published association results (beta and  p \u2010values) from the genome\u2010wide association studies (GWAS) of the human blood metabolome ( http://metabolomics.helmholtz\u2010muenchen.de/gwas/ ; Shin et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 2014 ; Suhre et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 2011 ), we further evaluated if any CALM\u2010associated SNPs in Table\u00a0 2  could act as metabolite QTLs (mQTLs) in blood (Table\u00a0 S4 ). After correcting for multiple comparisons (alpha of 0.05/20 tests\u00a0=  p \u2010value \u2264 2.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22123 ),  RPS6KA2  SNPs rs4710070 and rs10946177 ( r \n 2 \u00a0=\u00a00.83) were significant mQTLs for glutamine (beta\u00a0=\u00a00.01,  p \u2010value\u00a0=\u00a09.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22124 ) and prolyl\u20104\u2010hydroxyproline (beta\u00a0=\u00a00.02,  p \u2010value\u00a0=\u00a06.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22124 ), respectively. In addition, rs12765442, rs868692, and rs868691 on chromosome 10, which were in LD ( r \n 2 \u00a0=\u00a01, D\u2019=1) were mQTLs for uridine (beta\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.022,  p \u2010value\u00a0=\u00a01.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22124 ) and hypoxanthine (beta\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.032,  p \u2010value\u00a0=\u00a03.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22124 ) in blood.",
  "discussion": "4 DISCUSSION To identify common variants that influence the number of caf\u00e9\u2010au\u2010lait macules in individuals with NF1, a GWAS was performed in two cohorts with CALM number being treated as a quantitative trait. In the CALM1 cohort, multiple, significant SNPs were identified in the intronic regions of  RPS6KA2  (but not in CALM2) and in the CALM2 cohort SNPs were identified in  ADCY2  (OMIM103071; but not in CALM1). Meta\u2010analysis of the two cohorts identified no genome\u2010wide level significant SNPs, although three SNPs (two in  RPS6KA2  (rs3799585 and rs10946177)) and one SNP in  TTC6  (rs1951646) were significant at a suggestive genome\u2010wide association level ( p \u2010value\u00a0<\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22125 ). Post\u2010genotyping analysis of the cohorts showed significant differences in age and body surface area, differences between the distribution of CALM number and age, and a large number of the variants shared in common between the two cohorts suggested that differences may likely be due to heterogeneity rather than type I error. To address this heterogeneity issue, Complimentary Pairs Stability Selection\u2014Genome\u2010Wide Association Study or ComPaSS\u2010GWAS (Sabourin et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 2018 ), a method that approximates replication by randomly splitting the data into pseudo\u2010discovery and pseudo\u2010replication sets, was used to identify SNPs in each cohort separately. ComPaSS\u2010GWAS identified four SNPs with EMMAX in the CALM1 cohort (in  RPS6KA2 ) and two SNPs in the CALM2 cohort (in  ADCY2 ) with ComPaSS\u2010GWAS corroboration score >0.6. Based on previous simulation studies, this suggests that these findings could be replicated in larger and/or more homogeneous samples. The only SNPs that had a significant ComPaSS\u2010GWAS corroboration score (>0.6), were located in the introns of  RPS6KA2  and  ADCY2 . These two genes belong to RAS\u2010MAPK and cyclic AMP pathways, respectively. These two pathways interact in the cell via common members and converge on the family of transcription factors that control gene expression by binding to cAMP responsive element (CREBs), found in the promotor regions of a number of genes. Both MAPK and cAMP pathways are known to play important roles in proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and DNA repair among other cellular functions (Anjum & Blenis,\u00a0 2008 ; Houslay,\u00a0 2006 ; Sassone\u2010Corsi,\u00a0 2012 ). \n RPS6KA2  (ribosomal protein S6 kinase A2, legacy name  RSK3 ) encodes a 90\u00a0kDa protein that belongs to a family of closely related (75%\u201380% amino\u2010acid identity) and evolutionary conserved serine\u2010threonine kinases that are phosphorylated and activated by RAS\u2010MAPK pathway kinases, encoded by  MAPK3  (OMIM601795) and  MAPK1  (OMIM 176948; Anjum & Blenis,\u00a0 2008 ).  RPS6KA2  has been identified as a modifier of epidermal growth factor receptor activity in pancreatic cancer (Milosevic et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 2013 ). Although no known human phenotypes are associated with  RPS6KA2 ,  RPS6KA3  (OMIM 300075) underlies Coffin\u2010Lowry syndrome (CLS; Trivier et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 1996 ), a rare X\u2010linked disorder of cognitive delay and skeletal malformations. However, no pigmentary abnormalities are reported in CLS. The cAMP pathway has been shown to be involved in NF1 pathogenesis.  ADCY2  (adenylate cyclase 2) is a member of a family of genes that encode enzymes catalyzing synthesis of cyclic adenosine 3\u2019,5\u2019\u2010monophosphate (cAMP) from adenosine triphosphate (ATP; Sassone\u2010Corsi,\u00a0 2012 ). In mammalian brain, NF1/RAS may affect cellular cAMP through protein kinase C zeta and cell\u2010type specific G\u2010protein coupled receptors (Anastasaki & Gutmann,\u00a0 2014 ). Additionally, a study of 243 NF1 patients that focused on association of 2,761 unique SNPs in 22 key regulators of intracellular cAMP levels with optic pathway glioma (OPG), identified an adenylate cyclase gene,  ADCY8  (OMIM 103070), to be significantly associated with OPG risk (Warrington et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 2015 ). Functional annotation of CALM\u2010associated SNPs in this study revealed that the majority of  RPS6KA2  SNPs including the significantly associated rs12190451 in CALM1 mapped to potential enhancers or enhancer\u2010like regions and/or resided in strong open chromatin regions in primary skin cells. The  ADCY2  SNPs located to heterochromatin and/or polycomb\u2010repressed regions in fibroblasts and keratinocytes, but not melanocytes. However, none of the  RPS6KA2  or  ADCY2  associated SNP (and with ComPaSS\u2010GWAS scores >0.6) were identified as eQTLs for the respective genes or any genes  in\u2010cis  in sun\u2010exposed, non\u2010exposed skin tissues, whole blood, and transformed cultured fibroblasts from GTEx (Table\u00a0 S3 ). The possibility remains, however, that these SNPs may influence mRNA expression of these genes in melanocytes as both RSK2 and ADCY2 proteins are expressed in melanocytes ( https://www.proteinatlas.org/ ). \n RPS6KA2  rs3799585 which was associated with CALM number in CALM1 ( p \u2010value\u00a0=\u00a04.34\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22127 ), but not CALM2, has been reported to be a trans\u2010eQTL for  SOCS5  (OMIM607094) on chromosome 2 in monocytes ( p \u2010value\u00a0=\u00a03.15\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22128 ; Fairfax et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 2014 ) suggesting that the other haplotype SNPs may also influence monocyte levels of  SOCS5  mRNA. We show here using RoadMap and Encode data that rs3799585 together with the significant signal rs3799603 ( p \u2010value\u00a0=\u00a07.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22128 ) locate to a promoter region in monocytes, but not in skin cells, and unlike rs3799585, rs3799603 can influence the binding of several transcription factors including YY1 (Choudhury & Ramsey,\u00a0 2016 ). SOCS5 is a member of the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family of proteins and plays an important role in several immune response pathways including IL4 and JAK\u2010STAT signaling. IL4 (OMIM 147780) can directly inhibit melanogenesis in normal healthy melanocytes via STAT3 (OMIM 102582) and STAT6 (OMIM 601512) phosphorylation and downregulate both transcription and translation of melanogenesis\u2010associated genes, such as microphthalmia\u2010associated transcription factor and dopachrome tautomerase (Fairfax et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 2014 ). Thus, the involvement of IL4\u2010induced JAK2\u2010STAT6 signaling in melanocytes could be considered a potential mechanism for influencing pigmentation in skin. We also observed that  RPS6KA2  rs4710070 and rs10946177 ( r \n 2 \u00a0=\u00a00.83) can influence the level of glutamine and prolyl\u20104\u2010hydroxyproline metabolites, respectively, in blood (Table\u00a0 S4 ). Both SNPs were associated with increased CALM number in CALM1 only. Proliferating cells display an intense appetite for glutamine, reflecting its versatility as a nutrient and mediator of intermediary metabolism (DeBerardinis & Cheng,\u00a0 2010 ). A role for glutamine in extracellular signal\u2010regulated protein kinase (ERK) signaling/pathways has also been identified in intestinal epithelial cells (DeBerardinis & Cheng,\u00a0 2010 ). Prolyl\u2010hydroxyproline (Pro\u2010Hyp) has also been shown to stimulate the growth of skinfibroblasts in rats and consequently increases fibroblasts migrating from the skin (Shigemura et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 2009 ). The lack of replication in this study may likely be due to heterogeneity between discovery (CALM1) and replication (CALM2) cohorts. Several factors may be responsible. The data from this study show an increase in the CALM number with age up to ~18\u00a0years and a decrease in CALM number after 18\u00a0years (Figure\u00a0 3 ). CALM number is known to increase in early childhood (Boyd et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 2010 ; Shah,\u00a0 2010 ) and then decrease with age (Duong et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 2011 ; Huson, Harper, & Compston,\u00a0 1988 ). Clinically different features of the patients of the two cohorts due to ascertainment bias of recruitment could explain other parts of the heterogeneity. For the CALM1 cohort, all NF1 patients were eligible, regardless of specific phenotypic features. For the CALM2 cohort, only NF1 patients with plexiform neurofibromas were recruited. Since plexiform neurofibromas can be associated with overlying hyper\u2010pigmentation (Shah,\u00a0 2010 ), the high prevalence (essentially 100%) of these tumors in CALM2 that may have inflated the CALM number. Furthermore, plexiform neurofibromas tend to grow during childhood and especially puberty (Dombi et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 2007 ; Nguyen et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 2012 ); the associated dyspigmentation may also follow this trend. This may partially explain the increase in CALM number we observed in patients <18\u00a0years of age; the mini\u2010peak in CALM number around 11\u201312\u00a0years of age is particularly notable (Figure\u00a0 3 ). Difference in phenotyping of NF1 traits is another possible cause of heterogeneity between cohorts. The Wood's lamp method (UV light in a dark room) method was used to find CALM for CALM1; this is helpful to find fainter CALM in older people. However, counting of CALM by Wood's lamp was not used for CALM2. Accurate and robust quantitative phenotyping of clinical traits in NF1 is technically challenging, highly time\u2010 and labor\u2010consuming and remains one of the major obstacles in identification of genetic modifiers in NF1. Another possible interpretation of the lack of replication could be that multiple genetic modifiers are involved in NF1, each with a limited effect on the phenotype, but few of them could be identified in a modestly sized GWAS and none in a small one. However, as ComPaSS\u2010GWAS results suggest, present findings within each cohort might be biologically plausible given larger or more homogeneous cohorts. In summary, we performed the first GWAS for CALM number in neurofibromatosis type 1. We used caf\u00e9\u2010au\u2010lait macule number as a tumor\u2010like and easily quantifiable clinical phenotype to identify genome\u2010wide variation that is associated with this trait. We identified SNPs in intronic region of  RPS6KA2 , a member of RAS\u2010MAPK signaling pathway, that were associated with CALM number at a suggestively significant genome\u2010wide level.  RPS6KA2  is biologically plausible as a genetic modifier of NF1 and warrants further investigation and functional studies.",
