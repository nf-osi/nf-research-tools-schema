  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a tumor-predisposition disorder that arises due to pathogenic variants in tumor suppressor NF1. NF1 has variable expressivity that may be due, at least in part, from heritable elements such as modifier genes; however, few genetic modifiers have been identified to date. METHODS: In this study, we performed a genome-wide association analysis of the number of caf\u00e9-au-lait macules (CALM) that are considered a tumor-like trait as a clinical phenotype modifying NF1. RESULTS: A borderline genome-wide significant association was identified in the discovery cohort (CALM1, N\u00a0=\u00a0112) between CALM number and rs12190451 (and rs3799603, r CONCLUSION: rs12190451 is located in a melanocyte-specific enhancer and may influence RPS6KA2 expression in melanocytes-warranting further functional studies.",

All participants provided written informed consent prior to joining the studies. The NCI Special Studies IRB also approved the overall GWAS. The study was carried out according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Quantitative trait caf\u00e9\u2010au\u2010lait macule count data were collected from two cohorts, CALM1 (CALM number counted by DRS) and CALM2 (CALM number counted by AB), as described previously (Pemov et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 2014 ). Most of the patients in the CALM1 cohort were adults, while most patients in the CALM2 cohort were children (Table\u00a0 1 ). All patients in the CALM2 cohort underwent whole\u2010body MRI and had at least one plexiform neurofibroma. In both cohorts, all CALMs\u00a0\u2265\u00a05\u00a0mm in longest diameter were counted. A Wood's lamp, which makes CALMs more visible, was used for CALM counting in CALM1, but not in CALM2. The log\u2010transformed CALM number, log 10  (CALM\u00a0+\u00a010), was analyzed adjusting for age, sex and body surface area (m 2 )   defined as in Mosteller,\u00a0 = ( weight(kg) \u00b7 height ( cm ) ) / 60 1987 . Differences in age, sex, body surface, and CALM number were compared by two\u2010sided  t \u2010test in R assuming unequal variance between cohorts.

John Wiley & Sons, Ltd 2.2 Genotypes for CALM1 samples for GWAS Genotyping for the CALM1 samples was performed on Illumina Infinium HumanOmni\u20101Quad bead\u2010chips. SNPs from 22 autosomes were included if the SNP GenTrain score was >0.3 and minor allele frequency (MAF) was >0 (non\u2010monomorphic). Samples with genotyping rate \u226599% and calling rate \u226599% were retained. Cryptic relatedness and population stratification were checked with multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis estimating pairwise identity by descent (IBD) for all pairs of founders using independent SNPs in PLINK (Purcell et al., 2007). SNPs with MAF\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.2 in founders were pruned for independence, first with pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) correlation measure  r \n 2 \u00a0<\u00a00.2 within 50 SNPs, then again within 200 SNPs. Lastly, SNPs with MAF\u00a0<\u00a00.1 in European\u2013Americans were excluded. The quality control protocol yielded 608,561 SNPs in 112 European\u2013Americans with non\u2010missing CALM number. The CALM1 cohort included 57 unrelated individuals, 16 families with 2 members each, 5 families with 3 members each, and 2 families with 4 members each. 2.3 Genotypes for CALM2 samples for GWAS Genotyping for the replication cohort CALM2 samples was performed on Illumina Infinium Omni2.5 bead\u2010chips. Quality control measures were performed as described above although the retention rates for genotyping and calling rates were both lowered to \u226598% due to the smaller sample size. Samples with genotyping rate <95% from remaining European\u2013Americans and SNPs with MAF\u00a0<\u00a00.2 were excluded\u2014yielding 623,562 SNPs in 59 European\u2013Americans with non\u2010missing CALM number, including two sibling pairs. To ensure compatibility between the genotyping data between the two cohorts, LitfOver (Hinrichs et al.,  2006 ) was used to convert genome positions in the CALM1 cohort (NCBI build 36, UCSC hg18) to corresponding positions in the CALM2 cohort (NCBI build 37 (UCSC hg19). 2.4 Targeted sequencing of candidate loci Targeted sequencing of candidate loci was carried out in 171 European\u2013American samples using the AmpliSeq/IonTorrent platform, as per the manufacturer's instructions. A genotype was considered missing if its genotype quality score (GQ) was <10, its read depth (DP) score was <10 or the ratio of the genotype quality score (GQ) divided by genotype read depth (DP), GQ/DP was <0.5. Monomorphic SNPs and SNPs with a calling rate <90% and samples with a genotyping rate <90% were excluded leaving 176 SNPs in 157 samples. Quality control for targeted gene sequencing data was done using SNP & Variation Suite v8.3.4 ( http://goldenhelix.com/products/SNP_Variation/index.html ) and PLINK (Purcell et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 2007 ). 2.5 Tests of association In each cohort, tests of association between each SNP and log\u2010transformed CALM number, adjusted for age, sex, and body surface area, were performed with EMMAX (Kang et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 2010 ) with an IBS kinship matrix considering possible spurious association due to genetic relatedness. Simple linear regression (SLR) ignoring genetic relatedness was also performed; these results are not shown because the correlations of the  p \u2010values for EMMAX and SLR for the CALM1 and CALM2 cohorts were 0.95 and 0.99, respectively. In the targeted gene sequencing samples, tests of association were performed by SLR between each SNP in  RPS6KA2  (OMIM 601685; GenBank  NM_021135.6 ) and the log\u2010transformed CALM number, adjusted for age, sex, and body surface area, for the CALM1 and CALM2 cohorts, both separately and combined. An additional covariate, cohort (CALM1, CALM2), as well as age, sex, and body surface area were adjusted in the mega analysis for combined\u2010targeted gene sequencing data. Candidate loci were defined as those with suggestive genome\u2010wide significance ( p  <1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22125 ) in the GWAS of either cohort or in the meta\u2010analysis. 2.6 Meta\u2010analysis Meta\u2010analyses between the CALM1 and CALM2 cohort studies were performed with METAL (Willer, Li, & Abecasis,\u00a0 2010 ) with weights proportional to the square\u2010root of the sample size for each study (Stouffer, Suchman, Devinney, Star, & Williams,  1949 ), with genomic control correction of input statistics enabled. Heterogeneity analyses including I 2  statistics, the percentage of variation between cohorts due to heterogeneity rather than chance, were also performed in meta\u2010analyses. 2.7 ComPaSS\u2010GWAS analysis The second approach for corroboration of SNP associations used ComPaSS\u2010GWAS (Sabourin et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 2018 ), a method based on complementary pairs stability selection (Shah & Samworth,  2013 ) with a regression based GWAS analysis. ComPaSS\u2010GWAS approximates replication by randomly splitting a sample in half (into a pseudo\u2010discovery and pseudo\u2010replication set) multiple times and looking for corroboration of results between each random split. ComPaSS\u2010GWAS returns a corroboration score between 0 and 1, indicating the proportion of random splits where the SNPs were corroborated for the specified within\u2010split significance parameter. The primary focus of ComPaSS\u2010GWAS is for situations where appropriate independent replication data are either not available or when the replication cohort is too small to sufficiently bolster the primary cohort's findings in a meta\u2010analysis. ComPaSS\u2010GWAS may also be useful when heterogeneity between the cohorts affects the ability of a meta\u2010analysis to produce confident results. A high ComPaSS\u2010GWAS score in a single cohort could also indicate that the lack of replication may be a result of the differences in cohorts rather than the individual cohort analysis result being a false positive. In this study, ComPaSS\u2010GWAS scores were obtained using a within\u2010split significance parameter of 10 \u22123  based on 100 random splits. Simulations have shown (Sabourin et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 2018 ) that a ComPaSS\u2010GWAS score of 0.6 is comparable to a traditional genome\u2010wide association significance level ( p  < 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22128 ). ComPaSS\u2010GWAS score greater than 0.4 and less than 0.6 are considered to be suggestively significant findings. 2.8 LD structures Haploview 4.2 (Barrett, Fry, Maller, & Daly,\u00a0 2005 ) was used to generate LD plots across the genome based on D\u2019 and  r \n 2  values to evaluate LD structures among significant SNPs variants in Table\u00a0 2  for each cohort.

John Wiley & Sons, Ltd 2.9 Functional annotation and quantitative\u2010trait loci analysis of SNPs Custom tracks on the UCSC Genome browser ( http://genome.ucsc.edu ) were used to screen NIH Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE experimental data containing the SNP regions of interest for evidence for regulatory relevance in normal skin cells (melanocytes, fibroblasts and keratinocytes). The online tools HaploReg ( http://www.broadinstitute.org/mammals/haploreg/haploreg.php ) and RegulomeDB ( http://regulome.stanford.edu ) were used as complementary analyses and to confirm the location of each SNP in relation to protein\u2010coding and/or non\u2010coding RNA genes. While many regulatory regions can act in a tissue\u2010specific manner, it is unknown whether variants in such regions also have tissue\u2010specific effects, and complex phenotypes are often caused by dysfunction of multiple tissues or cell type. This suggests the potential for the involvement of skin and other tissues/cells such as blood (immunity) and fibroblasts (regulatory role in pigmentation) in CALM phenotype. To evaluate if a SNP could influence gene expression  in\u2010cis  or act as an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in blood and skin tissues, all coding genes were identified that mapped within \u00b11\u00a0Mb of the index SNPs (associated SNPs of interest). eQTL results for all CALM\u2010associated SNPs and collated genes based on 749 normal skin tissues (414 sun\u2010exposed and 335 non\u2010sun\u2010exposed), 369 normal blood samples and 300 transformed fibroblast cell lines were then extracted from GTEx (V7, dbGaP Accession phs000424.v7.p2), (12 lead index SNPs and 1 surrogate variant in perfect LD). In addition, the influence of a SNP on metabolite levels in blood was evaluated by extraction of association results for each SNP and metabolites in blood from the Metabolomics GWAS ( http://metabolomics.helmholtz\u2010muenchen.de/gwas/ ).",
