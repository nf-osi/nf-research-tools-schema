CONTEXT: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is among the most common genetic  disorders that cause learning disabilities. Recently, it was shown that  statin-mediated inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase  restores the cognitive deficits in an NF1 mouse model. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of simvastatin on neuropsychological,  neurophysiological, and neuroradiological outcome measures in children with NF1. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-two of 114 eligible children (54%) with  NF1 participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial  conducted between January 20, 2006, and February 8, 2007, at an NF1 referral  center at a Dutch university hospital. INTERVENTION: Simvastatin or placebo treatment once daily for 12 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were scores on a Rey complex figure test  (delayed recall), cancellation test (speed), prism adaptation, and the mean  brain apparent diffusion coefficient based on magnetic resonance imaging.  Secondary outcome measures were scores on the cancellation test (standard  deviation), Stroop color word test, block design, object assembly, Rey complex  figure test (copy), Beery developmental test of visual-motor integration, and  judgment of line orientation. Scores were corrected for baseline performance,  age, and sex. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed between the simvastatin and  placebo groups on any primary outcome measure: Rey complex figure test (beta =  0.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.36 to 0.56); cancellation test (beta =  -0.19; 95% CI, -0.67 to 0.29); prism adaptation (odds ratio = 2.0; 95% CI, 0.55  to 7.37); and mean brain apparent diffusion coefficient (beta = 0.06; 95% CI,  -0.07 to 0.20). In the secondary outcome measures, we found a significant  improvement in the simvastatin group in object assembly scores (beta = 0.54; 95%  CI, 0.08 to 1.01), which was specifically observed in children with poor  baseline performance (beta = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.29 to 1.30). Other secondary  outcome measures revealed no significant effect of simvastatin treatment. CONCLUSION: In this 12-week trial, simvastatin did not improve cognitive  function in children with NF1.
