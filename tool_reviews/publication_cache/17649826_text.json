  "methods": "Methods The cNF working group, a subgroup of the Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) consortium, was formed to review and inform clinical trial design for cNFs. Between June 2018 and February 2020, the cNF working group performed a review of existing data on genetic biomarkers for cNFs in the setting of neurofibromatosis type 1. We also reviewed criteria for successful biomarker application in the clinic. The group then held a series of meetings to develop a consensus report.",
