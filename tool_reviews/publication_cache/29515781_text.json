  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: CXCR4 is a chemokine receptor that recruits blood stem cells and increases tumor cell growth and invasiveness. We examined CXCR4 expression in vestibular schwannomas (VS) from patients with and without neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) and correlated the levels with the patients' clinical characteristics. The aim was to determine whether CXCR4 can be used as a prognostic marker and as a target for systemic therapy. RESULTS: Overall, CXCR4 mRNA levels were 4.6-fold higher in VS versus control; the levels were 4.9-fold higher in NF2 patients and 4.2-fold higher in sporadic VS patients. IHC and WB showed heterogeneous protein expression, and CXCR4 was expressed mainly in S100-positive Schwann cells. There was no correlation between the CXCR4 protein levels and tumor extension. However, there was a trend towards correlation between higher expression levels and greater hearing loss. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CXCR4 mRNA and protein levels were determined in VS samples ( CONCLUSIONS: CXCR4 mRNA was overexpressed in VS relative to healthy vestibular nerves, and there was a trend towards higher CXCR4 expression levels being correlated with greater functional impairment. Thus, CXCR4 may be a prognostic marker of VS, and CXCR4 inhibition has potential as a systemic approach for the treatment of VS.",
