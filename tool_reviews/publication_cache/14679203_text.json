  "abstract": "The stability of p53 tumor suppressor is regulated by Mdm2 via the ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated proteolysis pathway. The c-Abl and PTEN tumor suppressors are known to stabilize p53 by blocking the Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation. This study investigated the correlation between p53 and merlin, a neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2)-related tumor suppressor, in association with the Mdm2 function. The results showed that merlin increased the p53 stability by inhibiting the Mdm2-mediated degradation of p53, which accompanied the increase in the p53-dependent transcriptional activity. The stabilization of p53 by merlin appeared to be accomplished through Mdm2 degradation, and the N-terminal region of merlin was responsible for this novel activity. This study also showed that overexpression of merlin-induced apoptosis of cells depending preferentially on p53 in response to the serum starvation or a chemotherapeutic agent. These results suggest that merlin could be a positive regulator of p53 in terms of tumor suppressor activity, and provide the promising therapeutic means for treating tumors with non-functional merlin or Mdm2 overexpression.",
