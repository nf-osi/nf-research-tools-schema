Neurofibromatosis type II (NF2) is a disease that lacks effective therapies. NF2  is characterized by bilateral vestibular schwannomas (VSs) that cause  progressive and debilitating hearing loss, leading to social isolation and  increased rates of depression. A major limitation in NF2 basic and translational  research is the lack of animal models that allow the full spectrum of research  into the biology and molecular mechanisms of NF2 tumor progression, as well as  the effects on neurological function. In this protocol, we describe how to  inject schwannoma cells into the mouse brain cerebellopontine angle (CPA)  region. We also describe how to apply state-of-the-art intravital imaging and  hearing assessment techniques to study tumor growth and hearing loss. In  addition, ataxia, angiogenesis, and tumor-stroma interaction assays can be  applied, and the model can be used to test the efficacy of novel therapeutic  approaches. By studying the disease from every angle, this model offers the  potential to unravel the basic biological underpinnings of NF2 and to develop  novel therapeutics to control this devastating disease. Our protocol can be  adapted to study other diseases within the CPA, including meningiomas, lipomas,  vascular malformations, hemangiomas, epidermoid cysts, cerebellar astrocytomas,  and metastatic lesions. The entire surgical procedure takes ~45 min per mouse  and allows for subsequent longitudinal imaging, as well as neurological and  hearing assessment, for up to 2 months.
