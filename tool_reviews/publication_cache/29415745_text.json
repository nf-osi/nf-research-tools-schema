  "title": "Cutaneous neurofibromas in Neurofibromatosis type I: a quantitative natural history study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder characterized by a predisposition to develop multiple benign tumors. A major feature of NF1 is the development of localized cutaneous neurofibromas. Cutaneous neurofibromas manifest in >\u200999% of adults with NF1 and are responsible for major negative effects on quality of life. Previous reports have correlated increased burden of cutaneous neurofibromas with age and pregnancy, but longitudinal data are not available to establish a quantitative natural history of these lesions. The purpose of this study is to conduct a prospective natural history study of 22 adults with NF1 over an 8-year period to quantify cutaneous neurofibroma number and size. RESULTS: The average monthly increase in volume for cutaneous neurofibromas was 0.37\u00a0mm CONCLUSIONS: The number and volume of cutaneous neurofibromas significantly increased over an 8-year timespan; however, the rate of increase is variable by individual and body region. These findings may provide insight into cutaneous neurofibroma development and benefit researchers considering clinical trials targeting cutaneous neurofibromas.",

  "methods": "Methods Participants All participants were evaluated at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, a regional medical center with the only neurofibromatosis clinic in the state. Inclusion criteria included adult patients (\u226518\u00a0years) who met clinical diagnostic criteria for NF1, had a known  NF1  pathogenic variant, and a significant burden of cNFs. Cutaneous Neurofibroma measurement protocol Paper frames with a 100cm 2  cut-out area were used to guide the assessment (Fig.\u00a0 1 ). The frames were made from paper with a sticky backing and easily adhered to skin. These frames were placed on 3 body sites: back, abdomen, and either the thigh or upper arm. Visible landmarks were used to align the frames consistently when measurements were made at different times, using photographs to insure similar positioning from one time to the next (the neurofibromas themselves can provide clear landmarks). A working definition was developed for operational purposes to reliably count and measure cNFs: dome-shaped, soft, fleshy bumps on the skin greater than 4\u00a0mm (calipers were used to determine the 4\u00a0mm minimum size threshold). Subcutaneous bumps that were firm and nodular were excluded because these are more difficult to accurately measure. Fig. 1 Picture of the 100cm 2  paper frame used to count and measure cutaneous neurofibromas. Blue indicates cNFs that were counted (>\u20094\u00a0mm). Red indicates the cNFs that were measured The cNF number measurement protocol was previously described in detail [ 15 ]. Briefly, all cNF counts were performed manually in \u201creal time\u201d by marking cNFs with a washable marker to avoid counting a tumor more than once, then photographed, and counted again by digital photography to confirm accuracy. All cNFs within the paper frame that fulfilled the working definition of a cNF were counted. The cNF number measurement protocol was used as a guide to develop a method of measuring cNF volume. Instead of counting cNFs, digital calipers were used to manually measure the length, width, and height, which were used to calculate volume. The length measurement was made by placing the caliper\u2019s outside jaws at the cNF\u2019s outermost points with the longest diameter. The width measurement was made perpendicular to the length measurement. The height measurement was made by placing the terminus of caliper\u2019s depth gauge at skin level and measuring to the topmost point of the cNF. Three to 6 target cNFs were identified within each paper frame, marked with washable marker, measured with a digital caliper, and photographed. Regions with plexiform neurofibromas, which involve multiple fascicles of the length of a nerve and its branches, may be large and disfiguring tumors, and usually develop in childhood, were not included within the measurement regions. Size measurement pilot study A set of 16 plaster model \u201ctumors\u201d of known volume were utilized that ranged from 1.18\u2013452.39mm 3  in volume, 2-12\u00a0mm in diameter, and 1-6\u00a0mm in height. Three investigators (I1, I2, I3) measured the length, width, and height of the model tumors with calipers to calculate volume on 2 separate occasions. Prospective natural history study A cohort of 22 adult patients with NF1 participated in the cNF natural history study. The cNF size and number protocol were performed at baseline, then every 4\u00a0months for 24\u00a0months (2\u00a0years). The measurement protocol was performed again approximately 96\u00a0months (8\u00a0years) after the baseline study visit. All 22 participants completed the study visits for 24\u00a0months and 14 were able to complete the 96\u00a0month study visit; the remaining 8 participants were unable to complete the final study visit because of loss to follow-up, death, or illness. Statistical analyses To assure the reproducible and accurate measurement of cNF size in the pilot study, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) [ 16 ] were used to evaluate the agreement of measures from three investigators using laser scanner as well as the agreement between those measures and the actual model volume. High ICC (close to 1) among three investigators indicates high reproducibility and high ICC (close to 1) between human measures and actual volume indicate high accuracy of the measurements. To account for any cNFs that were removed over the course of the study, investigators asked study participants at each visit if any cNFs were surgically removed. These cNFs were not included in the analyses. The size and number measurements obtained during the natural history study of cNF were analyzed separately. In order to provide average growth rates by region (back, abdomen, arm/leg), growth rate per cNF was estimated by change in volume. To account for clustering of lesions within a patient and the correlation from measuring multiple lesions per subject over time, random effect modeling was used with intercept and time as random effects and two level of clustering (i.e. lesions nested within patients). The time effects on the number of lesions were analyzed with a random effect model with the intercept and time as random effects and only one level of clustering (i.e. patients). The slope value shows the rate of increase by month. In both analyses, the Kenward-Roger approximation was used in standard error estimations and the F test, accounting for the small number of patients. All the analysis was conducted using SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC).

  "introduction": "Background Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder affecting approximately 1:3000 individuals worldwide and is characterized by cutaneous, neurological, skeletal, and neoplastic manifestations. Localized cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs) derive from peripheral nerves and manifest within the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Although these lesions are not life threatening, they can lead to significant morbidity. A population-based survey in Wales found cNFs in >\u200999% of adults with NF1 [ 1 ], making this the most common tumor manifestation in adults. The current scientific literature of survey-based and cross-sectional studies collectively indicate that cNFs usually appear around puberty, increase with age, and undergo periods of rapid growth in puberty and pregnancy [ 1 \u2013 3 ]. None of these studies obtained longitudinal data to establish a quantitative natural history of these lesions. Visibility of cNFs are associated with major negative effects on quality of life for individuals with NF1 [ 4 \u2013 6 ]. Treatment of cNFs is limited to surgical excision or destruction (e.g. laser or electrodessication) [ 7 \u2013 14 ]. Removing all lesions is not usually feasible due to the abundance of cNFs, a scar will result at each site, and tumors can regenerate from remaining cells. The development of non-surgical treatment and clinical trials directed at cutaneous neurofibromas has been hampered by the difficulty in measuring and counting cNFs and lack of detailed information on the natural history of the lesions. The present study has expanded on a previously described approach to quantify the number of cNFs [ 15 ] and to measure cNF size. This approach allowed us to elicit quantitative data on the rate of appearance and growth of cutaneous neurofibromas from a prospective natural history study of cutaneous neurofibromas in adult NF1 patients over 8\u00a0years. This dataset establishes both a method for quantitative assessment of cutaneous neurofibromas and a baseline dataset on the progression of untreated tumors that will pave the way for clinical trials of medical treatment for these tumors.",
  "results": "Results A pilot study was designed to determine if a caliper-based protocol for measuring cNF size was accurate and reliable. A set of 16 plaster model \u201ctumors\u201d of known, yet varying, volumes were utilized. Three investigators measured the length, width, and height of the model tumors with digital calipers to calculate volume on 2 separate occasions. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were derived from calculated volumes to assess 1) measurement accuracy to known model volume and 2) reproducibility for repeated measures (Table\u00a0 1 ). The ICC showed that the investigators\u2019 manual measurements were accurate (Table\u00a0 1 , last column) and reproducible (ICC\u2009=\u20090.9964). Therefore, the study investigators proceeded with using the caliper-based size measurement protocol for the duration of the cNF natural history study. Table 1 Intraclass correlation of three investigators (I1, I2, I3) calculated volumes to actual model volumes (Actual Volume) I1 I2 I3 Actual Volume I1 0.9958 0.9964 0.9964 0.9992 I2 0.9951 0.9964 0.9983 I3 0.9966 0.9936 This approach, as well as the previously designed cNF number measurement protocol, was employed to prospectively monitor tumor number and size in a cohort of 22 adult patients with NF1 over an 8-year period. The cNF size and number measurement protocol was performed at baseline, then every 4\u00a0months for 24\u00a0months (2\u00a0years), and finally after approximately 96\u00a0months (8\u00a0years) from the study initiation. All 22 participants completed the study visits for 24\u00a0months and 14 were able to complete the 96\u00a0month study visit; the remaining 8 participants were unable to complete the final study visit. Study participant descriptive information is detailed in Table\u00a0 2 . The mean age at baseline was 50.5\u00a0years and 54.5% were female.

Random effect modeling of the data from the 22 patients indicated that the average monthly increase in elliptical volume for cNFs was 0.37\u00a0mm 3  in the back region (95% CI (0.23, 0.51),  p \u2009<\u20090.0001; Fig.\u00a0 2a ), 0.28\u00a0mm 3  in the abdominal region (95% CI (0.16, 0.41), p\u2009<\u20090.0001; Fig.\u00a0 2b ), and 0.21\u00a0mm 3  in the arm/leg region (95% CI (0.08, 0.34),  p \u2009=\u20090.0022; Fig.\u00a0 2c ). This means the average cNF volume increased by 2.6 fold in the back, 1.64 fold in the abdominal, and 1.75 fold in the leg/arm regions over 96\u00a0months. Fig. 2 Cutaneous neurofibroma volume by body region over 96\u00a0months. Box-and-whisker plot shows the distribution of cutaneous neurofibroma volumes from the 22 patients over 96\u00a0months in the back region ( a ), abdominal region ( b ), and the upper arm or thigh ( c ). The circles (o) above the boxplot maximum range are suspected outliers, the stars (*) further above are outliers, the red plus (+) is the mean To evaluate longitudinal effects on the number of cNFs, random effect modeling was performed with both intercept and slope (time) as random effects. Random effect modeling from the 22 patients yielded\u00a0a non-significant increase in cNF number during 96\u00a0months; however, in a subgroup analysis of the 14 patients that completed the 96\u00a0month study visit showed that the number of cNFs significantly increased in the back (slope\u2009=\u20090.032,  p \u2009=\u20090.011) and abdominal (slope\u2009=\u20090.018,  p \u2009=\u20090.026) regions, while the leg/arm regions retained a positive trend (slope\u2009=\u20090.004,  p \u2009=\u20090.055) (Fig.\u00a0 3 ). This means that the approximate cNF number increase was 3.1 in the back, 1.7 in the abdominal, and 0.4 in the leg/arm regions over the 8\u00a0year timespan. Interestingly, a study participant with a relatively large burden of cNFs had 2 new abdominal lesions develop in close proximity over the course of the study that was captured by photography (Fig.\u00a0 4 ).

  "discussion": "Conclusion Cutaneous neurofibromas can be accurately and reliably measured over a prolonged period of time. The average monthly increase in cutaneous neurofibroma number and volume is significant; however, the rate of increase is variable by individual and body region. These findings may provide insight into cutaneous neurofibroma development and benefit researchers considering clinical trials targeting cutaneous neurofibromas.",
