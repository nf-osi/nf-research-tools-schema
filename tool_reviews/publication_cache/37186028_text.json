  "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 results from loss-of-function NF1 pathogenic variants (PVs). Up to 30% of all NF1 PVs disrupt mRNA splicing, including deep intronic variants. Here, we retrospectively investigated the spectrum of NF1 deep intronic PVs in a cohort of 8,090 unrelated individuals from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) dataset with a molecularly confirmed neurofibromatosis type 1. All variants were identified through their effect on the NF1 transcript, followed by variant characterization at the DNA-level. A total of 68 distinct variants, which were ≥ 20 nucleotides away from the closest exon-intron junction, were identified in 2.5% unrelated individuals with NF1 (200/8,090). Nine different pathogenic splice variants, identified in 20 probands, led to exonization of different parts of intron 30 [23.2] or 31 [23a]. The two major NF1 transcript isoforms, distinguished by the absence (type I) or presence (type II) of the alternatively spliced cassette exon 31 [23a], are equally expressed in blood in control individuals without NF1 or NF1-affected individuals carrying their PV not in the introns flanking exon 31 [23a]. By fragment and cloning analysis we demonstrated that the exonization of intron 31 [23a] sequences due to deep intronic PV predominantly affects the NF1 isoform II. Seven additional (likely) pathogenic NF1 deep intronic variants not observed in the UAB dataset were found by classification of 36 variants identified by a literature search. Hence, the unique list of these 75 deep intronic (likely) PVs should be included in any comprehensive NF1 testing strategy.",
