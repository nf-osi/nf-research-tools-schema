  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: NF1 inactivation is associated with sensitivity to MEK inhibitor targeted therapy in low-grade and some high-grade gliomas. NF1 loss may also be a harbinger of exploitable vulnerabilities in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma (GBM). Accurate and consistent detection of NF1 loss, however, is fraught given the large gene size, challenges with complete coverage and variant calling upon sequencing, and mechanisms of mRNA and protein regulation that result in early degradation in the absence of genomic alterations. Here, we seek to perform a composite analysis for NF1 loss accounting for genomic alterations and protein expression via immunohistochemistry. We also characterize the landscape of NF1 alterations in GBM. METHODS: We assembled a single-institution, retrospective cohort of 542 IDH-wildtype GBM with somatic next generation sequencing to investigate the frequency and nature of detected NF1 alterations. We selected 69\u00a0GBMs from which to build a tissue microarray (TMA) of 44 NF1-wildtype and 25 NF1-mutant cases. We performed NF1 immunohistochemistry using two different NF1 antibodies (NFC, Sigma-Aldrich; and iNF-07E, iNFixion Bioscience) and correlated results with clinical, genomic, and other immunohistochemical features. RESULTS: In our retrospective cohort, we identified 88 IDH-wildtype GBM with NF1 alterations (16%). NF1 alterations were mutually exclusive with EGFR and MDM2 alterations (p-adj\u2009<\u20090.001, 0.05, respectively), but co-occurred with PIK3R1 alterations (Log CONCLUSION: NF1 immunostaining may serve as a sensitive surrogate marker of NF1 genomic inactivation and a valuable extension to next-generation sequencing for defining NF1 status. Minimal NF1 immunoreactivity is a poor prognostic marker, even in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma without apparent NF1 genomic alterations, but the underlying molecular mechanism requires further investigation.",

We performed NF1 immunohistochemistry using two different NF1 antibodies (NFC, Sigma-Aldrich; and iNF-07E, iNFixion Bioscience) and correlated results with clinical, genomic, and other immunohistochemical features. Methods Database construction This study\u00a0was\u00a0conducted with the approval of the Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board (IRB00288357). A REDCap database was constructed from 542 patients with histologically-confirmed IDH-wild type GBM, including 8 gliosarcomas, seen at the Johns Hopkins medical system between November 1, 2017, and December 1, 2023. All tumor specimens underwent sequencing of\u2009~\u2009400 cancer-related genes via the JHH (Johns Hopkins Hospital) NGS Solid tumor panel, as previously described [ 19 ,  20 ]. For each patient, clinical and next-generation sequencing data were extracted from the electronic medical record.  NF1  genomic inactivation status was determined by a neuropathologist based on the  NF1  alteration(s) and comparative variant allele frequencies. Tissue microarray construction A tissue microarray was constructed using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue from a subset of patients comprising the REDCap database. Four, 0.6\u00a0mm tumor cores were selected from each specimen based on the microscopic appearance of an adjacent tissue slide as evaluated by a neuropathologist. Regions of high tumor density and cell viability were prioritized for core selection. The final tissue microarray included 69 tumors \u2013 44  NF1 -wildtype and 25  NF1 -mutant\u2014including one from a patient with NF-1. Tumors were selected from patients who had an initial diagnosis of glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype after November 1, 2017, and had ample surgical tissue available per visual review of paraffin blocks. Following processing and staining, all specimens except one had two or more evaluable cores. Analysis of publicly available glioblastoma cohorts The cBioportal website (cbioportal.org) was used to analyze The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)\u2014Firehose Legacy and the National Cancer Institute\u2019s Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) Glioblastoma cohorts [ 21 \u2013 24 ]. We excluded 7 and 15 samples, respectively, from the TCGA and CPTAC cohorts that harbored pathogenic  IDH1/2  alterations detected on NGS. Immunohistochemistry We validated two anti-NF1 antibodies\u2014NFC (Sigma-Aldrich, MABE1820) and iNF-07E (iNFixion Bioscience) in FFPE cell pellet sections made from glioblastoma neurosphere lines with previously characterized levels of NF1 expression: JHH-520 (NF1-deficient), GBM1 (NF1-intact), and JHH-0879 (NF1-intact) [ 13 ] (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01). The NFC monoclonal antibody recognizes a C-terminal epitope within the last 281 amino acids of human neurofibromin [ 25 ]. iNF-07E is a monoclonal antibody that recognizes amino acids 863\u2013867 of NF1. Both antibodies were validated first in human glioma cells with known NF1 expression status. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed in FFPE tissue microarray sections using the following antibodies against NF1: clone NFC (1:10) and iNF-07E (1:20), podoplanin (clone D2-40, Dako, 1:200), phospho-ERK (#9101, Cell Signaling, 1:250), phospho-S6, p16, ATRX, Ki67, and p53. At least two scorable tissue cores per specimen were required for score assignment. Scoring for NF1, podoplanin, phospho-ERK, phospho-S6, and p16 was performed by two blinded, independent neuropathologists (F.J.R., C.H.L.) using a three-tiered scale (\u201cpreserved\u201d, \u201cequivocal\u201d, \u201clost\u201d) based on staining intensity. Tumors with discordant scores were assigned an aggregate score of \u201clost\u201d if at least one core was \u201clost.\u201d Tissue microarray sections were stained for p53 and Ki67 and digitally scanned. QuPath (v0.4.3) was used to quantify the percentage of cells with positive or negative immunostaining [ 26 ]. Statistical analyses Association between two categorical variables was summarized using contingency tables and analyzed using two-sided Fisher\u2019s Exact test. To account for multiple comparisons, p-values are adjusted using Benjamini\u2013Hochberg procedure to control false discovery rate of 0.05. Overall survival time was defined from the date of initial surgical diagnosis to the date of death (non-censored) or the date of last known alive (censored). Survival rate was estimated using Kaplan\u2013Meier estimator and compared using log-rank test in univariate analysis. Cox proportional hazards model was used in multivariate analysis. Statistical significance was set at  p \u2009<\u20090.05. All statistical analyses were performed in R (version 4.3.1) using the \u2018survival\u2019, \u2018survminer\u2019, and \u2018stats\u2019 packages.",

  "introduction": "Introduction IDH-wildtype glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain malignancy in adults [ 1 ]. The prognosis is poor, and the treatment paradigm\u2014a combination of surgical resection, radiotherapy and alkylating chemotherapy\u2014has remained largely unchanged for the past two decades [ 2 ]. Advances in tumor genomics have identified clinically relevant genetic alterations and epigenetic signatures in GBM, but O (6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase ( MGMT ) promoter methylation remains one of the few molecular markers predictive of response to standard therapy [ 3 ]. Some oncogenic mutations have proven to be actionable clinical targets in other glioma types. Successful trials of IDH-inhibitors for IDH-mutant astrocytoma, BRAF inhibitors for BRAF-mutant glioma, and MEK inhibitors for pediatric low-grade glioma have demonstrated the potential impact of targeted therapy for gliomas, but unfortunately not yet in GBM [ 4 \u2013 6 ]. Identification of targetable oncogenes and development of effective targeted therapies for GBM remains an area of active investigation. Neurofibromin 1  (NF1)  is a potentially targetable gene in the MAPK pathway. NF1 is a tumor suppressor that functions as a RAS GTPase activating protein, negatively regulating RAS/MAPK signaling by promoting the inactive GDP-bound form of RAS. Germline mutations in  NF1  cause neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1), a tumor predisposition syndrome associated with benign and malignant tumors primarily in the peripheral and central nervous system. Somatic mutations in  NF1  are implicated in many sporadic cancers, including melanoma, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and GBM [ 7 ]. In GBM,  NF1  loss is more common at recurrence and is associated with the mesenchymal subgroup, which has the worst clinical outcomes [ 8 ]. NF1 inactivation has been shown to occur through multiple mechanisms. Fifteen percent of sporadic GBM harbor somatic mutations in\u00a0 NF1  [ 8 ]. In addition to truncating and inactivating mutations, NF1 inactivation occurs through other mechanisms such as aberrant splicing, post-transcriptional silencing, and proteasomal degradation [ 9 \u2013 12 ].\u00a0Preclinical studies from several groups, including our own, demonstrate that NF1 inactivation confers ERK pathway dependence and partial sensitivity to MEK\u00a0inhibition [ 13 ,  14 ]. Early-phase clinical trials in pediatric low-grade glioma and case studies in high-grade glioma confirm putative sensitivity to MEK inhibitor therapy [ 15 ,  16 ]. However, effective clinical translation of promising targeted therapy combinations is stymied by challenges in accurately identifying tumors with functional NF1 loss. Accurately and consistently identifying\u00a0loss of NF1 function through next-generation sequencing is challenging for several reasons. The gene is large (350\u00a0kbp) and can be difficult to sequence in its entirety at sufficient depth for variant calling [ 17 ,  18 ]. Additionally, the functional implications of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in  NF1  are largely unclear, and non-coding intronic or promoter alterations may not be detected via standard clinical exome sequencing. Moreover, next generation sequencing (NGS) does not account for post-transcriptional modifications, silencing, or degradation which may lead to functional loss of NF1. Here, we evaluate the genomic landscape of  NF1  alterations in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, validate an immunohistochemical biomarker for NF1 loss, and identify other immunohistochemical, genomic, and clinical correlates of NF1 immunostaining.",
  "results": "Results Characterization of genomic NF1 status in a glioblastoma cohort We first assessed the frequency and type of  NF1  alteration among 542 IDH-wildtype GBM. One hundred fifteen  NF1  alterations were identified across eighty-eight tumors (16.2%) (Supplementary Table\u00a01). Seventy-one nonsense/frameshift mutations, 13 splice-site mutations, 30 missense mutations, and one in-frame insertion/deletion in  NF1  were annotated (Fig.\u00a0 1 A). Protein-coding changes in  NF1  were distributed throughout the entire gene, with the exception of recurrent truncations at Y2264 which were observed in five tumors. Seventy-two  NF1  alterations were identified by ClinVar to be either \u201cPathogenic\u201d or \u201cLikely pathogenic\u201d, with 16 alterations of conflicting or uncertain significance and 27 not annotated [ 27 ]. Of the 30  NF1  missense mutations detected in our cohort, seven were predicted to be cancer-promoting and the rest were predicted to be likely passenger mutations by FATHMM [ 28 ].

VUS\u2009=\u2009variant of unknown significance, FS\u2009=\u2009frame shift NF1  alterations were mutually exclusive with alterations in  EGFR  (log2OR \u20132.3, p-adj\u2009<\u20090.001) , MDM2  (log2OR \u20132.5, p-adj\u2009=\u20090.05) , PDGFRA,  and  CDK4  (Fig.\u00a0 1 B, Supplementary Table\u00a02). Alterations in  NF1  co-occurred with alterations in  PIK3R1  (log2OR 1.6, p-adj\u2009=\u20090.03). After adjusting for multiple hypotheses, only the associations between  NF1  and  EGFR ,  PIK3R1 , and  MDM2  remained statistically significant, supporting prior observations [ 8 ]. Mutual exclusivity of  NF1  and  EGFR  alterations in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma was further substantiated using two publicly available resources, TCGA and CPTAC, totaling 368 genomically-characterized glioblastomas after excluding samples with pathogenic  IDH1/2  alterations (Supplementary Table\u00a03\u20134) [ 21 \u2013 24 ]. To identify whether pathogenic alterations in  NF1  are associated with changes in mRNA or protein expression, we interrogated the TCGA and CPTAC glioblastoma cohorts [ 21 ,  22 ]. We observed significantly decreased average  NF1  mRNA expression ( p \u2009<\u20090.001 for each cohort) in tumors with known pathogenic  NF1  alterations, though a subset had intact expression levels (Fig.\u00a0 1 E,  F ). We next evaluated whether  NF1  mRNA expression correlated with protein expression. In 89 glioblastoma samples with both protein and mRNA, mRNA expression levels strongly correlated with protein expression (Spearman\u2009=\u20090.69,  p \u2009<\u20090.001) as quantified by mass spectrometry (Fig.\u00a0 1 G). We evaluated how  NF1  alterations were associated with overall survival. In our institutional cohort of 542 glioblastomas, we observed that neither truncating  NF1  alterations in the entire cohort nor  NF1  genomic loss in the TMA cohort alone were significantly associated with decreased overall survival (Fig.\u00a0 1 H). This was supported by the TCGA dataset where neither  NF1  alterations nor mRNA expression was associated with a difference in overall survival (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02A-B). Our findings contrasted with the CPTAC dataset where  NF1  alterations were associated with decreased overall survival, though this was not true for  NF1  mRNA or protein expression (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02C-E) [ 23 ,  24 ]. Tissue microarray assembly and genomic characterization In order to evaluate NF1 protein expression, we created a tissue microarray (TMA) from 69 representative glioblastomas from the cohort described above. Forty-four samples were  NF1 -wildtype and 25 were  NF1 -mutant on next-generation sequencing. All but one was obtained from the first tumor resection. The mutational profiles of glioblastomas included in the tissue microarray cohort are displayed in Fig.\u00a0 2 . The range of genomic alterations and their association with NF1 loss were similar to the overall GBM population.  NF1  alterations identified in our cohort were manually assigned to two categories (pathogenic or non-pathogenic) by a neuropathologist based on whether they were indicative of genomic loss, taking into account alteration type, location in the gene, and potential loss of heterozygosity events. Tumors in the TMA were categorized as \u201c NF1  altered\u201d or \u201c NF1  intact\u201d by a neuropathologist based on their alterations. These scores were in high concordance (100%) with ClinVar annotations. Fig.\u00a02 Oncoprint of 69 glioblastomas included in TMA cohort displaying genetic alterations in selected genes Immunohistochemistry for NF1 status We performed an exhaustive literature search for NF1 antibodies previously validated for immunochemistry in human glioma tissue. After thorough validation, we chose two antibodies: clone NFC (Sigma Aldrich, MABE1820) and iNF\u201307E (Infixion Biosciences) to evaluate NF1 protein expression (Fig.\u00a0 3 , Supplementary Fig.\u00a03). Another NF1 antibody, clone McNFn27b (Abnova, NB300-154), was tested but not used due to high background staining in our hands. Immunostaining with the NFC antibody was negative in the tissue specimen from a patient with NF-1 (Fig.\u00a0 3 A), but immunoreactive in a specimen with no  NF1  alterations (Fig.\u00a0 3 B). The NFC immunostain was immunoreactive in 26 tumors (41%), whereas 34 (54%) had minimal or absent staining, one had equivocal staining, and seven were not scored due to the absence of assessable tumor tissue. Inter-core heterogeneity was noted within tumors, with seven displaying a mixture of cores showing both retained and absent NFC immunoreactivity. NF1 immunostaining scored by a second independent neuropathologist (F.J.R.) was highly concordant (82%). NF1 immunostaining results were evaluated for each tumor in the context of  NF1  genomic status (Fig.\u00a0 3 E). Of the 14 scorable tumors assessed to be  NF1 -deficient by NGS, 12 (86%) also demonstrated minimal to absent NF1 immunostaining with NFC antibody. Of the two tumors with intact NF1 immunostaining, one harbored an E2624* truncating mutation near the C terminus. This truncation preserves a portion of the NFC antibody epitope and, of note, was the most C-terminal truncation present in our cohort. Among scorable  NF1- wildtype specimens, the NFC antibody was immunoreactive in 23/42 (55%), equivocal in one (2%), and minimal or absent in 18 (43%). In tumors harboring  NF1  variants of uncertain significance, NF1 immunostaining was minimal or absent in four and immunoreactive in one. Fig.\u00a03 NF1 immunohistochemistry in patient-derived glioblastoma samples.

The iNF-07E antibody was immunoreactive in 46 tumors (76%). Fourteen (23%) demonstrated minimal or absent immunostaining, one stained equivocally, and seven were not scored due to the absence of assessable tumor tissue. Inter-core heterogeneity was minimal with iNF-07E immunostaining, as no tumors exhibited cores with both intact and absent staining. Of the 14 scorable tumors considered  NF1 -deficient by NGS, eight (57%) also demonstrated minimal or absent immunostaining with iNF-07E. Among scorable  NF1  wildtype specimens, NF1 immunostaining was retained in 38 (90%) and minimal or absent in 4 (10%). In tumors harboring  NF1  variants of uncertain significance, NF1 immunostaining was minimal or absent in two and retained in three. Upon comparison, the sensitivity of NFC and iNF-07E for tumors with confirmed NF1 loss was 86% and 57%, respectively (Supplementary Table\u00a05). Protein and genomic correlates of NF1 loss We next evaluated potential protein correlates for NF1 loss as identified via immunostaining or NGS. We assessed the expression of proteins known to be correlated with MAPK signaling (phospho-ERK, phospho-S6) or with  NF1  status (p16, podoplanin) [ 29 ,  30 ]. We also evaluated proteins associated with proliferation and loss of cell cycle regulation in glioblastoma (p53, Ki-67) [ 30 ]. Expression of these proteins did not correlate with NFC or iNF-07E staining. We next asked whether IHC would be associated with  NF1  genomic status and found positive phospho-ERK immunostaining to be associated with  NF1  genomic loss ( p \u2009=\u20090.045, Supplementary Table\u00a05), supporting prior observations of a similar correlation in mesenchymal GBM [ 21 ]. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering by these seven proteins of interest did not identify distinct clusters corresponding with NF1 immunostaining (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04). We evaluated for co-occurring or mutually exclusive gene alterations and found no statistically significant associations with NF1-deficiency by IHC staining. Survival analysis of tissue microarray cohort stratified by NF1 immunostaining We evaluated whether NF1 loss by IHC\u2014as assessed by two different antibodies\u2014correlated with survival. Baseline demographic features of tumors included in the TMA were comparable between the two groups, demonstrating no differences between the two antibodies except for higher baseline Karnofsky performance score observed in patients with loss of immunostaining by iNF-07E antibody ( p \u2009=\u20090.025) (Supplemental Table\u00a07). Notably, patients with NF1 loss by NFC immunostaining had decreased survival compared with NF1 intact tumors (8.5 (4.5\u201312.6) vs. 16.4 (13.2\u201325.4) months,  p \u2009=\u20090.011; Fig.\u00a0 4 A). This difference was not observed with the iNF-07E antibody (9.8 (6.5\u201418.0) vs. 11.4 (4.5\u2014NR) months,  p \u2009=\u20090.63). In a Cox proportional hazard regression model, we adjusted for known and potential confounding variables: age at diagnosis, sex,  MGMT  promoter methylation, baseline Karnofsky performance score, treatment with temozolomide or radiotherapy, extent of resection, and the presence of any  NF1  genomic alteration (Supplementary Table\u00a08). Minimal or absent NFC immunostaining remained significantly associated with decreased overall survival (HR 3.23, 95% CI 1.29\u20138.06,  p \u2009=\u20090.01). Fig.\u00a04 Kaplan\u2013Meier curves displaying overall survival in TMA cohort by NF1 immunohistochemistry. Curves are stratified by  A  NFC immunostaining,  B  iNF-07E immunostaining among entire TMA cohort Protein and genomic correlates NF1 expression in  NF1 -wildtype subset We evaluated whether loss of NF1 expression in  NF1 -wildtype tumors was associated with other gene alterations on NGS or IHC stains. We focused our analysis on the subset of  NF1- wildtype tumors that demonstrated minimal to absent staining by NFC antibody. None of the genes or proteins that we tested were significantly associated with NF1 expression in this subset (Supplementary Tables 9\u201310). Notably, despite the absence of associated gene alterations, minimal or absent NF1 protein by NFC remained significantly associated with decreased overall survival in patients without genomic  NF1  alteration (Fig.\u00a0 4 B). Loss of NF1 expression remained significantly associated with decreased survival on multivariate analysis including age at diagnosis, KPS, degree of resection, prior chemoradiation, and  MGMT  promoter methylation status (HR 2.55, 95% CI 1.00\u20136.49,  p \u2009=\u20090.049, Supplementary Table\u00a011). On univariate analysis, age at diagnosis, KPS less than 80, subtotal resection, lack of radiation/temozolomide, and unmethylated  MGMT  promoter were also associated with inferior survival, but no other immunostain or genomic alteration was significantly associated with outcome.",
  "discussion": "Discussion NF1 loss is a marker of RAS/MAPK signaling dysregulation and a putatively targetable event in gliomas, but rapid, accurate identification remains fraught. Here, we describe the landscape of  NF1  alterations in a large institutional cohort of 542 molecularly profiled IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, identifying clinical and molecular correlates of NF1 loss. We then evaluated two immunohistochemical antibodies in glioblastoma tissue. Both were effective at identifying NF1 protein loss in tumor specimens predicted to have genomic loss of NF1 but may also identify a subset of  NF1 -wildtype tumors with protein loss. The mesenchymal subtype of glioblastoma, defined by frequent  NF1  alterations and low mRNA expression of  NF1 , is associated with a poor prognosis [ 8 ,  31 ,  32 ]. Cells within the mesenchymal subtype are also characterized by hypoxia and an abundance of immune cell infiltrates, and may be present as a subset of cells in a heterogenous glioblastoma [ 33 ]. Analysis of a separate institutional cohort of IDH-wildtype glioblastomas also identified  NF1  alterations to be associated with decreased overall survival [ 34 ]. Here, we evaluated the public literature supporting the role of  NF1  as a prognostic biomarker and found that the presence of an alteration does not correlate with survival in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. Even when restricted to known pathogenic truncating alterations, no clear survival difference emerged. While mRNA does correlate with survival, it is costly and time-consuming. In this study, loss of NF1 immunostaining by NFC antibody correlated negatively with survival, regardless of genomic status. NF1 status is challenging to evaluate via standard next-generation sequencing for many reasons. The  NF1  gene is both large (350\u00a0kbp) and structurally complex (60 exons), making it difficult to sequence accurately in its entirety [ 35 ]. Targeted next-generation sequencing panels may also fail to report  NF1  structural and copy number variants as well as alterations in noncoding regions, such as promoter or intronic alterations which are known to impact expression of the functional protein [ 7 ,  36 ]. Furthermore,  NF1  has few recurrent or hotspot mutations [ 7 ]. Instead, like other tumor suppressor genes, NF1 possesses a diverse mutational spectrum with over 13,000 unique somatic mutations reported in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer [ 37 ,  38 ]. For many of these somatic mutations\u2014especially missense and other non-truncating mutations\u2014their functional consequence is poorly understood [ 7 ]. Here we evaluated the utility of an immunohistochemistry-based approach for identifying NF1 loss. The NFC antibody demonstrated minimal immunoreactivity in 86% of tumors with known  NF1  genomic inactivation. It was immunoreactive in one tumor with an  NF1  truncating mutation that was distal to the antibody recognition site (Supp Fig.\u00a0 3 ). These findings highlight the importance of interpreting the IHC in concordance with the genomic picture. Interestingly, both antibodies identified a subset of glioblastoma that was apparently genomically intact for  NF1  but demonstrated minimal to absent protein expression\u2014the NFC antibody more so than iNF-07E (18/42 vs. 4/42). While the current study did not assess  NF1  mRNA for correlation, this may indicate a subset of glioblastoma is inactivating NF1 post-transcriptionally through mechanisms such as proteasomal degradation or post-transcriptional silencing, or through other negative feedback mechanisms. Prior studies suggest that as many as 30% of neurofibromatosis type 1-associated missense mutations in  NF1  result in aberrant pre-mRNA splicing which may explain the observed loss of NF1 protein in these specimens [ 39 ]. Validation studies with a larger cohort of glioblastomas having known mRNA expression levels and genomic status will be necessary to further evaluate this observation and determine the underlying mechanism driving minimal NF1 expression. Overall, these findings highlight the potential value of NF1 immunostaining as a sensitive surrogate marker of NF1 genomic inactivation. We also show that minimal to absent NF1 immunoreactivity is a poor prognostic marker in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, but the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to decreased NF1 expression in  NF1 -wildtype GBM require further investigation.",
