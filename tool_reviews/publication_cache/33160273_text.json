  "abstract": "Plexiform neurofibromas (pNFs) are benign tumors of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) that can progress towards a deadly soft tissue sarcoma termed malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). pNFs appear during development in the context of the genetic disease Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) due to the complete loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene in a cell of the neural crest (NC) - Schwann cell (SC) axis of differentiation. NF1(-/-) cells from pNFs can be reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that exhibit an increased proliferation rate and maintain full iPSC properties. Efficient protocols for iPSC differentiation towards NC and SC exist and thus NC cells can be efficiently obtained from NF1(-/-) iPSCs and further differentiated towards SCs. In this review, we will focus on the iPSC modeling of pNFs, including the reprogramming of primary pNF-derived cells, the properties of pNF-derived iPSCs, the capacity to differentiate towards the NC-SC lineage, and how well iPSC-derived NF1(-/-) SC spheroids recapitulate pNF-derived primary SCs. The potential uses of NF1(-/-) iPSCs in pNF modeling and a future outlook are discussed.",
