  "abstract": "Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, and with ongoing population growth and aging, its annual incidence continues to rise. Glioma is a malignant tumor of the brain and central nervous system (CNS). Neurosurgical tumor resection is a critical component of glioma treatment, significantly affecting patient prognosis. However, due to the diffuse nature of gliomas, achieving gross total resection is challenging, and residual tumor cells often lead to recurrence and disease progression following surgery. Intraoperative cancer diagnosis using rapid and sensitive techniques, such as ambient ionization mass spectrometry (AIMS), can provide crucial molecular insights to guide surgical decision-making and potentially improve patient outcomes. AIMS techniques, including desorption electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (DESI-MS), require minimal or no sample pretreatment, making them particularly advantageous for intraoperative applications where time efficiency is essential. Several AIMS methods have been investigated in brain cancer studies, either intraoperatively or offline, to analyze molecular alterations in cancerous tissues. Among these, DESI-MS is the most extensively reported AIMS technique in brain cancer research. This review focuses on the developments and applications of DESI-MS in both offline and intraoperative brain cancer diagnosis. Additionally, other AIMS methods employed in brain cancer research are discussed. The potential impact of AIMS techniques on glioma diagnosis is also explored.

  "methods": "Brain cancer diagnosis using other AIMS methods In addition to DESI-MS, other AIMS techniques have been explored for brain cancer diagnosis. Notably, REIMS has shown promise in lipidomic profiling. In one study, REIMS was applied to analyze 37 GBM and 19 control brain biopsies ( Fig. 6A ) [ 17 ]. During method development, 24 GBM and 13 control samples were used to train a partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model capable of distinguishing GBM from non-cancerous tissues. Discriminative ions in the fatty acid (FA) region included  m / z  119.0, 169.1, 183.1, 281.2 (oleic acid), 255.2 (palmitic acid), 325.2, and 303.2 (arachidonic acid), while key diagnostic phospholipids were observed at  m / z  699.5 (phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)), 718.5 (PC), 742.5 (PC), 744.6 (PC), 750.5 (PE), and 766.5 (PE). Model validation with 13 GBM and six control samples across five locations yielded 94.7 % accuracy and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.968 [ 17 ].

C) Sample collection and ionization using CBS for brain cancer analysis. Figures adapted from references with permission [ 17 , 24 , 87 ]. Hese et al. further employed REIMS to rapidly classify glioma subtypes and assess TCP across 36 brain samples [ 80 ]. Using bipolar forceps in coagulation mode, aerosols were generated for REIMS analysis. The resulting lipid data were evaluated using PCA followed by linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA). The glioma subtype model achieved 87.9 % accuracy overall, with higher performance for GBM classification and lower accuracy for oligodendroglioma and astrocytoma. A separate TCP model targeting high-grade gliomas demonstrated 97 % accuracy, with misclassifications limited to samples with TCP < 5 %. A color-coded visualization scheme for TCP was also introduced, showcasing the utility of REIMS to assist intraoperative decision-making. Classification of lower-grade gliomas achieved a more modest accuracy of 75 % [ 80 ]. Beyond REIMS, other surgical instruments have been integrated with MS to support intraoperative brain cancer diagnostics. One example is the CUSA, ( Fig. 6B ), which was paired with SSI-MS for lipid and peptide analysis of metastatic brain tissues using both positive and negative ion modes [ 24 ]. Although the tumors studied were brain metastases originating from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the findings demonstrated the potential of CUSA/SSI-MS for intraoperative applications. Agar et al. extended this work by performing DESI-MS intraoperatively to measure tumor cell concentrations at resection margins, mapping MS predictions onto preoperative 3D MRI images [ 81 ]. Tissue specimens collected using forceps and CUSA were analyzed in negative ion mode for lipid profiling. Multivariate statistical analysis estimated TCP values ranging from 5 % to 95 % [ 81 ]. Another particularly promising tool is the MasSpec Pen, which was used in one study to analyze 44 normal brain biopsies and 42 glioma samples. A LASSO model was trained on the MS data to distinguish glioma from normal brain tissue. The model achieved 96.9 % sensitivity, 93.9 % specificity, and 95.4 % accuracy based on five-fold cross-validation. Remarkably, testing data yielded 100 % accuracy [ 82 ]. Woolman et al. demonstrated the rapid diagnostic capabilities of PIRL-MS by classifying subgroups of 72 medulloblastoma (MB) samples in under 15 s for each measurement, achieving 98.9 % accuracy through PCA-LDA [ 20 ]. PIRL-MS was also used to classify other pediatric cancers, based on lipidomic profiles, with individual measurements made in less than 10 s [ 83 ]. Further insights were gained through PIRL-MS and DESI-MSI analyses of orthotopic xenografts of human MB. These studies revealed metabolic abnormalities in adjacent normal brain regions, resembling cancer-associated alterations. However, no histological evidence of tumor infiltration was found in these areas during pathological examination [ 84 ]. In a further extension of MS technology, SpiderMass was employed to analyze glioma biomarkers in 30 samples previously studied using MALDI-MSI. In SpiderMass, endogenous water molecules are excited by an IR laser allowing desorption and ionization of the sample. PCA-LDA yielded classification rates of 91.85 % with the “leave 20 % out” method and 77.78 % with the more stringent “one-patient-out” approach [ 85 ]. Additionally, use of the SpiderMass instrument enabled the generation of 2D and 3D topographical lipid distribution maps in mouse brains, highlighting its capability for spatially resolved molecular analysis [ 86 ]. Solid-phase microextraction (SPME)-based techniques, such as coated blade spray MS (CBS-MS), ( Fig. 6C ) have also been explored for brain cancer diagnostics. In one study, C18-coated blades were employed for untargeted lipid profiling, while hydrophilic–lipophilic coated probes facilitated targeted metabolic analysis, both with 15-minute extraction times [ 87 ]. Additionally, the same research group used CBS-MS to evaluate neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) mutation status in meningioma by detecting acetylcarnitines — making measurements within approximately six minutes [ 25 ]. Inline cartridge extraction (ICE) has likewise been investigated as a rapid technique for estimating TCP in glioma samples, offering another promising approach for intraoperative assessment [ 88 , 89 ]. Suzuki et al. integrated PESI-MS with machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict several key diagnostic and prognostic markers in brain tumors, including WHO grade, MIB-1 labeling index (LI), IDH mutation status, 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) fluorescence positivity, and radiological characteristics [ 90 ]. The study assessed the accuracy of PESI-MS ML predictions by comparing them with pathological diagnoses. PESI-MS analyses were performed in positive ion mode on 88 homogenized tissue samples, encompassing both glioma and non-glioma brain tissues. The authors utilized partial least squares regression (PLSR) and logistic regression (LR) for classification modeling. The predictive performance was notably high for tumor grading and 5-ALA fluorescence positivity, achieving accuracies of 90 % and 95 %, respectively. Predictions for IDH mutation status reached 87 % accuracy, while MIB-1LI ≥ 10 % had a prediction rate of 82.5 % [ 90 ]. In a move towards point-of-care (POC) instrumentation, miniature MS systems have been employed for glioma diagnosis. Brown et al. conducted intraoperative tandem MS using a mini MS system to assess IDH mutation status in 25 glioma biopsies. The study utilized extraction-nESI, a technique functionally similar to touch spray (TS), for sample collection and ionization [ 21 ]. Another method, direct sampling cartridge (DSC) miniature MS, has also been reported for intraoperative IDH mutation assessment in human gliomas [ 16 , 91 ]. In one such study, 172 biopsies from 74 patients were analyzed intraoperatively using DSC-mini MS, applying the previously described ratiometric method during MS/MS experiments [ 16 ]. Similar to results obtained with DESI-MS, DSC-mini MS achieved 100 % accuracy in predicting IDH mutation status, effectively distinguishing between IDH-wt and IDH-mut glioma samples (Mann–Whitney test,  p  < 0.001) [ 16 ]. In another move towards simpler, POC compatible operations, Pirro et al. employed swab TS for the analysis of 29 human glioma biopsies, using medical swabs to collect tissue by direct contact, followed by solvent application and high-voltage ionization to facilitate MS analysis in negative ion mode [ 22 ]. Both single-stage and tandem MS experiments were performed in the intraoperative study. Lipidomic profiles allowed differentiation between white and gray matter, while product ion scanning for NAA was utilized to estimate TCP. Additionally, the quantification of 2HG enabled assessment of IDH mutation status. These examples illustrate how the value of AIMS techniques in advancing clinical diagnostics, particularly in the field of cancer treatment.",
  "introduction": "Introduction As populations grow and age, cancer incidence rates rise, underscoring the urgent need for rapid and accurate diagnostic tools to detect and assess cancer biomarkers. Among central nervous system (CNS) malignancies, glioma is the most aggressive and complex [ 1 ]. Craniotomy remains the primary treatment for glioma, significantly affecting patient prognosis and survival. However, the need to preserve healthy brain parenchyma often results in incomplete tumor resection, as glioma cells infiltrate surrounding tissue. Residual tumor cells frequently contribute to recurrence, with many cases progressing to higher-grade gliomas that are more resistant to chemotherapy and radiation. Moreover, second surgeries often offer limited benefit for patients [ 2 , 3 ]. Given these challenges, there is a pressing need for intraoperative diagnostic tools that provide rapid, sensitive, and accurate real-time information about surgical margins during tumor resection. Currently, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of frozen sections is the standard intraoperative method for glioma diagnosis, but it does not provide molecular information. In clinical oncology, immunohistochemical staining (IHC) and genetic testing are considered gold standards for molecular cancer diagnostics [ [4] ,  [5] ,  [6] ,  [7] ], yet they are too slow for use during surgery. Imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) are useful for initial evaluations of suspected brain cancer, but offer limited molecular-level information [ 8 ]. Emerging technologies — such as Raman spectroscopy [ 9 ], fluorescence imaging [ 10 ], optical coherence tomography (OCT) [ 11 ], magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) [ 12 , 13 ], and ultrasound (US) [ 14 ] — are being explored for glioma diagnosis based on molecular characteristics. Among analytical platforms, MS stands out for its sensitivity and ability to identify molecules, offering superior specificity compared to spectroscopic methods. MS is gaining traction in cancer diagnostics and is increasingly integrated into both research and clinical workflows [ 15 ]. MS has been widely employed in clinical chemistry for its high sensitivity and broad capability to measure and quantify biomolecules. However, analyzing complex biological samples often necessitates sample pretreatment and separation techniques, notably chromatography. Although integrating chromatography with MS improves analytical specificity, it substantially increases analysis time, to such an extent as to make it unsuitable for intraoperative applications. The advent of ambient ionization mass spectrometry (AIMS) has accelerated sample analysis and the integration of MS into the operating room is already underway. This advance is largely attributed to the minimal need for sample pretreatment, allowing more rapid molecular assessment. Several AIMS techniques have been explored for cancer diagnosis, including DESI [ 16 ], rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry (REIMS) [ 17 ]– implemented in intelligent knife (iKnife) [ 18 ], MasSpec Pen [ 19 ], picosecond infrared laser mass spectrometry (PIRL-MS) [ 20 ], touch spray (TS) [ 21 ] and swab TS [ 22 ], liquid micro-junction surface sampling probe (LMJ-SSP) [ 23 ], cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspiration/sonic spray ionization mass spectrometry (CUSA/SSI-MS) [ 24 ], solid phase microextraction (SPME) [ 25 ], and probe electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PESI-MS) [ 26 ].  Fig. 1  illustrates a selection of these AIMS techniques schematically. Some of these techniques allow  in vivo  sample analysis, while others are limited to  ex vivo , but still intraoperative, studies. Fig. 1 Schematic illustration of several ambient ionization mass spectrometry (AIMS) techniques. A) desorption electrospray ionization (DESI), B) rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry (REIMS), C) picosecond infrared laser mass spectrometry (PIRL-MS), D) MasSpec Pen, E) liquid micro-junction surface sampling probe (LMJ-SSP), and F) cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspiration/sonic spray ionization mass spectrometry (CUSA/SSI-MS). The drawings are not to scale. REIMS operates by utilizing aerosols generated during tissue cauterization, where molecular contents are vaporized. The iKnife, optimized for lipid analysis, is suitable for procedures involving electrosurgical cutting or coagulation [ 27 , 28 ]. PIRL-MS employs laser pulses to generate aerosols during photochemical events, resulting in minimal thermal tissue damage [ 29 ]. The MasSpec Pen extracts metabolites and lipids into small volumes of water held at the pen tip, which are then transferred into the MS [ 19 ]. LMJ-SSP employs a continuous microfluidic solvent flow for analyte extraction, followed by electrospray ionization (ESI) [ 23 ]. In CUSA/SSI-MS, water is ultrasonically aspirated onto the tissue, and the resulting particles are drawn through a venturi pump into a sonic spray ionization (SSI) source, generating charged droplets [ 24 , 30 ]. In TS, sample collection is conducted by direct contact with a substrate, followed by solvent addition and high-voltage application to induce ionization [ 21 ]. PESI involves the perpendicular actuation of a needle that touches the sample. At its highest distance from the sample, pulses of high voltage are applied to the needle, facilitating ionization through a spray of uncharged solvent droplets [ 26 ]. DESI, the first AIMS technique, has proven effective in analyzing a wide range of biomolecules, including amino acids, drug compounds, peptides, and proteins [ 31 ]. This pioneering ionization method has allowed the analysis of numerous sample types in open air with minimal sample pretreatment. Following the development of DESI, several other ambient ionization techniques have emerged [ [32] ,  [33] ,  [34] ,  [35] ,  [36] ,  [37] ,  [38] ]and the number continues to grow. The original DESI configuration featured a sprayer similar to that used in ESI; however, instead of infusing an analyte solution directly into the MS, it was designed to direct a spray at a flat surface holding the sample. In DESI, a high voltage (typically 4–5 kV in early designs and < 1.5 kV in newer designs) is applied to the solvent to produce charged droplets, aided by a nebulizing gas. These charged droplets strike an electrically isolated sample surface, facilitating microextraction and the formation of secondary charged droplets. The generation of secondary droplets is hypothesized to result from a combination of surface wetting, microextraction, and momentum transfer via primary droplet impact [ 39 ] ( Fig. 2A ). The secondary droplets, containing analytes and matrix molecules, undergo further desolvation and Coulombic fission, with a small proportion entering the MS as gas-phase ions. Fig. 2 A) Mechanism of DESI: secondary charged droplet generation, followed by desolvation and Coulombic fission. B) Parameters influencing signal intensity in DESI (image quality enhanced using AI). C) Early DESI-MS imaging experiment on biological samples, showing the spatial distribution of various lipids in different regions of rat brain sections in negative ion mode. D) 3D reconstruction of dominant lipids in the mouse brain, generated by stacking multiple 2D DESI images. Figures B, C, and D adapted with permission from references [ 31 , 43 , 44 ]. Several parameters influence DESI signal quality, including sprayer voltage, nebulizer gas pressure, solvent flow rate, spray angle, and the distance between the sprayer and the sample. Additional variables, such as the diameters of the sprayer and nebulizer capillaries, type of nebulizer gas, distance between the sprayer and the MS inlet, distance from the sample surface to the transfer capillary, and the orifice diameter of the inlet, also affect performance [ 40 , 41 ] (see  Fig. 2B ). Depending on the nature of the sample, these parameters can be adjusted to optimize signal intensity. DESI exhibits a high salt tolerance, significantly exceeding physiological levels, further enhancing its suitability for studying biological samples with minimal to no sample pretreatment [ 42 ]. Since its inception, DESI has supported a broad spectrum of MS experiments, including the analysis of biological samples. DESI-MS has been applied in both quantitative and qualitative studies. An emerging type of application has seen DESI being used, especially in high-throughput (HT) fashion, for chemical synthesis and reaction screening [ [45] ,  [46] ,  [47] ,  [48] ,  [49] ,  [50] ,  [51] ]. The first DESI-MS imaging (MSI) experiment on biological samples was conducted by Wiseman et al., who mapped the spatial distribution of lipids in mouse brain using full-scan MS on a unit-resolution linear ion trap (LIT) ( Fig. 2C ) [ 43 ]. In a subsequent study, Wiseman and colleagues examined the distribution of the antipsychotic drug clozapine and its desmethyl metabolite across various mouse organs [ 52 ]. Lipid mapping in rat brain was significantly advanced using DESI-MSI [ 53 , 54 ]. Eberlin and co-workers demonstrated that DESI could be used to generate 3D images of the mouse brain by stacking serial 2D DESI images, showcasing the localization of dominant lipids within white and gray matter ( Fig. 2D ) [ 44 , 55 ]. Nano-DESI, a commonly used AIMS method for tissue imaging, is closely related to DESI, LMJ-SSP-MS and to the MasSpec Pen and is seeing similar applications [ 56 ]. This review emphasizes the application of DESI and related ambient ionization techniques for intraoperative brain cancer studies. The first section addresses DESI-MSI experiments and is followed by a discussion on smear-based diagnostic approaches. The third section examines additional AIMS strategies used in brain cancer diagnostics. The final section outlines current limitations and offers perspectives on the future of ambient ionization MS in brain cancer research.",

  "discussion": "Conclusions and future perspectives DESI-MS has been utilized in a variety of applications, including cancer diagnosis [ 16 ] and tissue imaging [ 61 ], which are the focus of this review. AIMS methods in general, are increasingly being explored for cancer diagnosis, though their application in brain cancer studies remains limited due to restricted access to brain tissue. Nonetheless, AIMS techniques offer rapid and sensitive molecular detection, enabling intraoperative molecular characterization of brain tumors. Several AIMS modalities have been applied to brain cancer analysis, including DESI-MS, REIMS, PIRL-MS, CUSA/SSI-MS, CBS-MS, the MasSpec Pen, and SpiderMass. Some of these, specifically REIMS, CUSA/SSI-MS, and the MasSpec Pen, are capable of  in vivo  analysis, while others are currently limited to  ex vivo  measurements on tissue biopsies. AIMS has primarily been employed to analyze lipids and small metabolites in gliomas and other CNS tumors, utilizing both high- and low-resolution MS, including miniature instruments. Based on detected molecular signatures, AIMS can provide critical intraoperative insights, including IDH mutation status, TCP, and, to a limited extent, the degree of tumor infiltration. These insights complement existing intraoperative diagnostic techniques and aid surgeons in determining the extent of tumor resection. This approach facilitates maximal tumor removal while minimizing surgical deficits, thereby improving patient outcomes. Furthermore, when a specific tumor phenotype is identified, precision medicine strategies may be employed. The subsequent paragraphs discuss variations in the basic AIMS techniques, methods for quantitative chirality determination, and factors influencing data quality, all topics likely to be increasingly important in the future. Variations on the basic AIMS technique include the use of reactive ionization [ 92 ], HT analysis [ 93 ], and reaction acceleration to facilitate chemical transformations [ 94 , 95 ]. Reactive ionization, especially when it involves pre-charged derivatization agents, offers an avenue to enhance both selectivity and sensitivity [ 96 ]. However, careful agent selection is crucial to minimize nonspecific interactions with isobaric or isomeric species. While reactive DESI has been successfully used for steroid analysis in urine, it remains untested in the context of brain cancer diagnosis [ 48 ]. Some AIMS platforms, such as extraction-nESI and nano-DESI, have harnessed derivatization chemistry to resolve such lipid structures; yet, their application to brain cancer diagnosis remains largely unexplored [ 97 , 98 ]. Lipidomics continues to gain momentum in cancer research owing to the pivotal roles lipids play in tumor biology [ [99] ,  [100] ,  [101] ]. Structural elucidation of lipid isomers — including double bond (C=C) positions and  sn -positions in acyl chains — can provide discriminative markers between healthy and diseased tissue, supplementing HRMS techniques [ 102 ]. A notable HT application (HT-DESI-MS) is the measurement of enzyme kinetics [ 103 ]. Despite these advances, many potential clinical and pathological uses of DESI remain to be explored. In biological systems, metabolism relies heavily on protein stereoselectivity and molecular chirality [ 104 ]. Neomorphic enzyme mutations can generate abnormal chiral metabolites, which may serve as cancer biomarkers; D-2HG in IDH-mut glioma is a prime example [ 105 ]. While MS cannot inherently distinguish enantiomers, the kinetic method enables enantiomeric excess (ee%) quantification without derivatization or use of chiral chromatography for separation [ 106 , 107 ]. However, DESI and related AIMS techniques have yet to be applied to quantitative chiral analysis in brain tumor specimens, perhaps due to potential interference from structurally similar compounds in complex biological matrices. The open-air configuration of AIMS demands control over experimental parameters and alignment to maintain measurement reproducibility [ 108 , 109 ]. However, in practice, HT-DESI-MS experiments demonstrate highly reproducible quantitative and qualitative results. In addition, like any MS technique, AIMS can suffer from ion suppression, particularly when readily ionizable species mask analytes at low concentrations or with low ionization efficiencies [ 110 , 111 ]. Optimizing solvent, incorporating internal standards, switching polarity, and derivatizing analytes are strategies to mitigate ion suppression and improve analytical accuracy [ 110 , 112 , 113 ]. Looking forward, the integration of AIMS with artificial intelligence (AI) holds significant promise for streamlining data processing and interpretation — especially in time-sensitive surgical settings. However, technical merit alone is insufficient for clinical adoption. Successful implementation also relies on the support of medical teams, alignment with hospital workflows, and justification of equipment costs through improved patient outcomes. In addition, navigating regulatory approvals will require robust institutional and industry backing. Finally, research involving human brain cancer is inherently constrained and time-intensive due to ethical and clinical complexities. Yet with continued innovation and collaborative support, these emerging diagnostic tools will be woven into clinical and pathological workflows, helping to guide surgical decisions and ultimately improving patient outcomes.",
