  "abstract": "A novel imaging-compatible sciatic nerve schwannoma model.  Saydam O(1), Ozdener GB, Senol O, Mizrak A, Prabhakar S, Stemmer-Rachamimov AO,  Breakefield XO, Brenner GJ.  Author information: (1)Departments of Neurology and Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, 13th  Street, Charlestown, MA 02129, USA. okay.saydam@meduniwien.ac.at  Benign schwannomas are common tumors of the cranial and peripheral nerves,  causing pain and loss of function. The development of effective therapy for  these tumors has been hampered by the lack of relevant experimental in vivo  models for convenient testing. Here, we describe a novel schwannoma model in  which an immortalized human schwannoma cell line, HEI-193, established from an  neurofibromatosis type 2 patient, has been stably transduced with fluorescent  protein and luciferase reporters and implanted within the sciatic nerve of nude  mice. These cells reliably formed a tumor within several weeks which had  pathologic characteristics of schwannoma tumors. This model system will be  useful for investigation of schwannoma biology and for preclinical assessment of  therapeutic agents.  Copyright © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
