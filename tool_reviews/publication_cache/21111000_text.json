  "title": "A novel imaging-compatible sciatic nerve schwannoma model.",
  "abstract": "Benign schwannomas are common tumors of the cranial and peripheral nerves, causing pain and loss of function. The development of effective therapy for these tumors has been hampered by the lack of relevant experimental in vivo models for convenient testing. Here, we describe a novel schwannoma model in which an immortalized human schwannoma cell line, HEI-193, established from an neurofibromatosis type 2 patient, has been stably transduced with fluorescent protein and luciferase reporters and implanted within the sciatic nerve of nude mice. These cells reliably formed a tumor within several weeks which had pathologic characteristics of schwannoma tumors. This model system will be useful for investigation of schwannoma biology and for preclinical assessment of therapeutic agents.",

Methods Human schwannoma cell line HEI-193 was established from a benign schwannoma tumor from an NF2 patient immortalized with retroviral mediated HPV E6-E7 gene expression and obtained from the House Ear Institute ( Hung et al., 2002 ). These cell lines have been transduced with lentivirus expressing Fluc and mCherry genes as described previously ( Saydam et al., 2009 ) and were cultured as described previously ( Hung et al., 2002 ). 3.1 Tumor implantation and bioluminescence imaging HEI-193 cells were trypsinized, rinsed, and implanted in 1 \u00b5l culture medium into the sciatic nerve of athymic mice (nu/nu, 5-week-old females; Cox 7 breeding facility, MGH).  In vivo  bioluminescence imaging was performed, as described previously ( Saydam et al., 2009 ). 3.2 HC staining Immunohistochemistry with immunofluorescent staining was conducted, as previously described ( Brenner et al., 2004 ). mCherry was visualized directly. S100 (1:400, Dako, Glostrun Denman, Carpinteria, CA) was visualized using fluorescent immunohistochemistry. Images were acquired using a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope.",
