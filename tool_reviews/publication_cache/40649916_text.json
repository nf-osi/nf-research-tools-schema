  "abstract": "Cutaneous manifestations can serve as early and sometimes the first clinical indicators in various hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the dermatological signs associated with these syndromes, aiming to facilitate their recognition in clinical practice. Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer syndrome is notably linked to an increased risk of melanoma. BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome is characterized by BAP1-inactivated melanocytic tumors. Muir-Torre syndrome, a variant of Lynch syndrome, presents with distinctive cutaneous neoplasms such as sebaceous carcinomas, sebaceous adenomas, and keratoacanthomas. PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome commonly features hamartomatous growths, trichilemmomas, acral keratoses, oral papillomas, and genital lentiginosis. Gorlin syndrome is marked by basal cell carcinomas and palmoplantar pits, while Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is identified by mucocutaneous pigmentation. In familial adenomatous polyposis, the cutaneous findings include epidermoid cysts, fibromas, desmoid tumors, and lipomas. Additionally, we examined monogenic disorders associated with cancer risk and skin involvement, such as xeroderma pigmentosum, neurofibromatosis type 1, familial atypical multiple-mole melanoma syndrome, and Fanconi anemia. The early recognition of these dermatologic features is essential for a timely diagnosis and the implementation of appropriate surveillance strategies in individuals with hereditary cancer syndromes.",

  "introduction": "1. Introduction Hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes account for approximately 10% of all cancer etiologies [ 1 ]. These syndromes are variable and present with distinctive tumors and/or clinical features that help us to suspect and determine the diagnosis [ 2 ]. In some cases, cutaneous manifestations could be the first sign that we observe, for example, mucocutaneous pigmentations seen in Peutz–Jeghers syndrome [ 3 ]; palmar pits in Gorlin syndrome [ 4 ]; nonmalignant neoplasms, presenting as sebaceous adenomas or epitheliomas, seen in Muir–Torre syndrome [ 5 ]; or even malignant neoplasms such as basocellular carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and cutaneous melanoma. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of all the dermatologic manifestations observed in both hereditary cancer syndromes and monogenic diseases. The goal was to highlight the key clinical signs that may be detected during a routine examination and emphasize the importance of close collaboration among dermatologists, oncologists, medical geneticists, and other specialists in hereditary cancer. By fostering interdisciplinary coordination, this approach ensures thorough patient management, from the initial suspicion to confirmatory testing and long-term follow-up.",

  "discussion": "4. Discussion The clinical insights compiled in this review underscore the significance of dermatological manifestations as early indicators in various cancer predisposition syndromes (CPSs). These cutaneous signs may precede systemic symptoms and provide an accessible window for early suspicion and diagnosis. Recognizing the dermatological phenotype, therefore, plays a pivotal role in guiding patients toward an appropriate genetic evaluation and subsequent management strategies. Dermatologists, in particular, are often the first specialists to encounter clinical clues suggestive of an underlying genetic syndrome, such as numerous melanocytic nevi in FAMM or multiple basal cell carcinomas in Gorlin syndrome. Similarly, the identification of atypical lesions, like BAP1-inactivated melanocytic tumors, requires nuanced clinical judgment and coordination with molecular diagnostics to guide patient management, even when the associated tumor type is not the presenting malignancy. Moreover, dermatological surveillance has emerged as a formal recommendation in patients with known germline variants, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers, with an increased risk for melanoma. The involvement of dermatologists in routine follow-up facilitates the early recognition of secondary malignancies and provides an opportunity for a family-wide assessment through cascade testing. Additional syndromes—for instance, Fanconi anemia, Bloom syndrome, and constitutional mismatch repair deficiency—present with dermatological signs that include café-au-lait macules, abnormal pigmentation, and telangiectasias. These phenotypes, when considered in conjunction with hematological or dysmorphic features, can trigger a timely referral to genetic services. Notably, many CPSs present with hallmark skin lesions: trichilemmomas and oral papillomas in Cowden syndrome; desmoid tumors in familial adenomatous polyposis; or periorificial lentigines in Peutz–Jeghers syndrome. Other cutaneous tumors, such as sebaceous carcinomas or keratoacanthomas, may be the first clinical manifestation in syndromes like Muir–Torre. Therefore, establishing dermatological literacy across oncologic and genetic disciplines is vital for early identification and triage. In the diagnostic landscape of hereditary cancers, interdisciplinary collaboration among dermatologists, oncologists, and geneticists is imperative. Dermatologists often serve as the first point of clinical detection, identifying suspicious cutaneous lesions through comprehensive skin examinations, often aided by dermoscopy. Once a lesion is identified, a biopsy is performed to evaluate its histological characteristics. Based on the clinical findings and family history, patients may be referred for a genetic consultation. Geneticists create a family tree, assess the cancer risk, and may recommend molecular testing to confirm a diagnosis. Following genetic confirmation, the care team jointly formulates a follow-up plan tailored to the specific syndrome, which may include clinical examinations, imaging studies, and cascade testing for at-risk family members. This coordinated, interdisciplinary workflow ensures an early diagnosis, proactive prevention, and personalized management. When cutaneous findings are integrated with detailed family histories and personal oncological profiles, clinicians can better delineate at-risk individuals. This integrated, multidisciplinary model not only enhances the diagnostic accuracy, but also optimizes prevention, surveillance, and therapeutic intervention strategies for patients and their families. 5. Conclusions Dermatological manifestations may serve as sentinel signs in patients with hereditary cancer syndromes. While some cutaneous features are common in the general population, their context within familial cancer patterns and syndromic associations mandates a comprehensive cancer risk assessment. Incorporating skin findings into genetic risk stratification can expedite the diagnosis and improve outcomes through personalized and precision medicine. The management of CPSs must be inherently multidisciplinary. Dermatologists, geneticists, and oncologists each bring indispensable expertise that, when integrated, facilitates a precise approach to cancer diagnoses, treatment, and prevention. Understanding the dermatological phenotype allows not only for the timely treatment of skin lesions, but also for systemic cancer risk mitigation in affected individuals and their relatives.",
