  "abstract": "Neurofibromin is required for barrel formation in the mouse somatosensory  cortex.  Lush ME(1), Li Y, Kwon CH, Chen J, Parada LF.  Author information: (1)Department of Developmental Biology and Kent Waldrep Center for Basic  Neuroscience Research on Nerve Growth and Regeneration, University of Texas  Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390-9133, USA.  The rodent barrel cortex is a useful system to study the role of genes and  neuronal activity in the patterning of the nervous system. Several genes  encoding either intracellular signaling molecules or neurotransmitter receptors  are required for barrel formation. Neurofibromin is a tumor suppressor protein  that has Ras GTPase activity, thus attenuating the MAPK (mitogen-activated  protein kinase) and and PI-3 kinase (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) pathways,  and is mutated in humans with the condition neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).  Neurofibromin is widely expressed in the developing and adult nervous system,  and a common feature of NF1 is deficits in intellectual development. In  addition, NF1 is an uncommonly high disorder among individuals with autism.  Thus, NF1 may have important roles in normal CNS development and function. To  explore roles for neurofibromin in the development of the CNS, we took advantage  of a mouse conditional allele. We show that mice that lack neurofibromin in the  majority of cortical neurons and astrocytes fail to form cortical barrels in the  somatosensory cortex, whereas segregation of thalamic axons within the  somatosensory cortex appears unaffected.
