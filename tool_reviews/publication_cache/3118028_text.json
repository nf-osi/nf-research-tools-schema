  "abstract": "Genotyping, using plasma proteins or DNA polymorphisms or both, was carried out on 30 families selected through probands with Von Recklinghausen disease. The data provide additional evidence for the exclusion of loci on chromosomes 3 and 5, and chromosome arms 1q, 2p, 4p, 4q, 6q, 7p, 9q, 11p, 11q, and 14q. There was no evidence for genetic heterogeneity at D1S1 (DNF15S2) on chromosome arm 3p, using the Morton test for heterogeneity.",
