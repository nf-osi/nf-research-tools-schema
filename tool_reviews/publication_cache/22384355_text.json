  "abstract": "The SPRED1 Variants Repository for Legius Syndrome.  Sumner K, Crockett DK, Muram T, Mallempati K, Best H, Mao R.  Legius syndrome (LS) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by germline  loss-of-function mutations in the sprouty-related, EVH1 domain containing 1  (SPRED1) gene. The phenotype of LS is multiple café au lait macules (CALM) with  other commonly reported manifestations, including intertriginous freckling,  lipomas, macrocephaly, and learning disabilities including ADHD and  developmental delays. Since the earliest signs of LS and neurofibromatosis type  1 (NF1) syndrome are pigmentary findings, the two are indistinguishable and  individuals with LS may meet the National Institutes of Health diagnostic  criteria for NF1 syndrome. However, individuals are not known to have an  increased risk for developing tumors (compared with NF1 patients). It is  therefore important to fully characterize the phenotype differences between NF1  and LS because the prognoses of these two disorders differ greatly. We have  developed a mutation database that characterizes the known variants in the  SPRED1 gene in an effort to facilitate this process for testing and interpreting  results. This database is free to the public and will be updated quarterly.  DOI: 10.1534/g3.111.000687 PMCID: PMC3276167 PMID: 22384355",
  "methods": "Methods Data sources and limitations The  SPRED1  database was constructed using gene sequence variation data published in the scientific literature since the  SPRED1  gene was first identified in patients with a NF1-like phenotype but with no identifiable  NF1  gene mutation in 2007 ( Brems  ). To date, 78 sequence variants have been found by searching PubMed ( et al.  2007 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez ) and Google ( http://google.com/ ). Search terms included  SPRED1 ,  Legius syndrome , and  NF1-like syndrome . Occasionally, laboratory-sequencing results that identify novel gene variants are also included in this archive. The database was constructed using the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) and Human Genome Organization (HUGO) Mutation Database Initiative recommendations for essential and optional content ( http://www.hgvs.org/mdifaq.html ). HGVS nomenclature recommendations for description of sequence variants were used to generate DNA and protein changes for this database. Reference sequences for this database were GenBank  NC_000015.9 , NM_1525940.2, and  NP_689807.1 ; entries were verified for position and name based on these sequences. All sequence variants in the database (including future updates) are named based on their position in relation to the coding regions of the  SPRED1  gene (cDNA) following recommendations listed by the HGVS ( http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen ) and described in  Den Dunnen and Antonarakis (2000) . To comply with sequence variant nomenclature according to the guidelines of the Human Genome Variation Society, the online batch position check tool Mutalyzer 2.0 ( http://www.mutalyzer.nl/ ) was used to confirm genomic position of all  SPRED1  gene variants ( Wildeman  ). et al.  2008 Software SQL tables (MySQL, Inc.) were organized to represent  SPRED1  mutation status, associated phenotype, literature references, and any known clinical information. PHP coding was performed in-house for dynamic HTML display to render pages and display SQL tables. Graphics were generated using FusionCharts v3 ( www.fusioncharts.com ). Web pages are hosted on a Mac OS X Apache server.  SPRED1  mutations were added to the database and edited using phpmyadmin ( www.phpmyadmin.net ).",

  "results": "Results and Discussion SPRED1  database website The  SPRED1  database can be found under Disease Databases on the ARUP Online Scientific Resource webpage  http://www.arup.utah.edu/  or accessed directly by using the URL  http://www.arup.utah.edu/database/SPRED1/SPRED1_welcome.php . Navigation between the series of webpages can be done using the quick links as shown in  Figure 1A . The  SPRED1  “Home” webpage briefly describes Legius syndrome, phenotype, the database goals, reference sequences used, and gene sequencing tests available at ARUP Laboratories. The right frame of the page conveniently lists contact information for the appropriate experts involved in the database development and curation, including medical director, submissions, testing, and website administrator. The “Home” page also provides a graphic link to the  SPRED1  gene topic hosted by the National Library of Medicine’s Genetics Home Reference ( http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SPRED1 ). Figure 1  Legius syndrome database display. (A) Quick links for navigation within the website for SPRED1 homepage, database display, links, and submission. (B) Main database display including a “live search” function for easy filtering to gene variants of interest. (C) Clicking any display column heading will sort gene variants in ascending or descending order. (D) Mouse-over function for additional clinical “Comments” column follows the literature reference column. The  SPRED1  “Links” webpage has hyperlinks to existing online resources for Legius syndrome and  SPRED1 , including Databases, Gene and Protein Links, Web Reviews, and Literature Reviews. Some of the resources listed here include Gene Reviews, Genetics Home Reference, OMIM, UniProt, Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD), and the  SPRED1  reference sequences used for our database curation. Lastly, recent literature reviews from experts in this disease area are posted and updated as appropriate. The  SPRED1  database can be displayed and searched in its entirety by accessing the “Database” webpage shown in  Figure 1B . The database contained 78 entries as of May 2011. The default database display is by genomic position of each sequence variant (5′ to 3′) within the  SPRED1  gene.  Figure 1C  shows the database display columns of Location, Mutation Type, Nucleotide Change, Protein Change, Classification, Meets NIH NF1 Criteria, References, and Comments. Information in the Comments column ( Figure 1D ) is available by placing the pointer over the comments icon. This information may further explain the data displayed for each entry. The database also has “live search” functionality, so that any term entered in the search box ( e.g. ,  exon ,  insertion ,  benign , or author name), will dynamically filter the displayed listing. Finally, clicking any column heading will sort (ascending and descending) the gene variant entries for redisplay. The “Submissions” webpage is used for submission of novel  SPRED1  sequence variants to the database or to update information for sequence variations currently archived in the database. Contact information is conveniently seen on the “Home” and “Links” pages. Requested information during submission includes gene variant location, mutation type, classification, nucleotide change, protein change, clinical significance, and contact information of the submitter. All submissions are received via autogenerated e-mail to the curators, and variant updates are added to the database quarterly. Database display columns SPRED1 sequence variation location and mutation type: The Location column displays the exon or intron number for each  SPRED1  gene variant. Mutation Type describes the biological event leading to the change in the DNA (relative to the reference sequence). Common types of variants include small deletions and insertions/duplications, missense, nonsense, splice-site, silent, and recently, large deletions (those equal to or larger than a single exon) that have been reported ( Spencer  ). Large duplications have not been reported in individuals with Legius syndrome.  et al.  2011 SPRED1  gene variant mutation types are graphically summarized in  Figure 2 . Figure 2  Dynamic graphical summary of (A) variant classification and (B) types of mutations found in the  SPRED1  database. SPRED1 genotype: The Nucleotide Change column displays the corresponding HGVS nomenclature ( Den Dunnen and Antonarakis 2000 ). For cDNA numbering in the Nucleotide Change column of the  SPRED1  database, the first cDNA nucleotide (c.1) is the “A” of the ATG initiation (start) codon. SPRED1 protein change: For the Protein Change column, the single amino acid changes are listed in the database display. Where splice-site variants occur, only the genotype is listed, with the protein change indicated with a question mark. Classification of pathogenicity: In the Classification column, definitions for pathogenicity are Pathogenic, Suspected Pathogenic, Benign, Suspected Benign, or Uncertain. As is common practice, loss of function (LOF) mutations are assumed pathogenic, and the author’s classification for each variant was used. Legius syndrome phenotype: The phenotype associated with each variant is listed by author if the variant was reported more than once. References and comments: The final two columns of the database feature links to literature resources and genotype/phenotype findings of each individual variant. As displayed in  Figure 1D , moving the cursor over the comments icon highlights a key feature and unique part of this online resource. Comments for each  SPRED1  variant often contain additional information or evidence to support the classification designation and whether the patient meets NIH diagnostic criteria for a clinical diagnosis of NF1. Importantly, clinical details, such as age or other conditions, may be included. Sensitive and private patient information is never listed. Database contents Currently, the database displays information and classification of 78  SPRED1  gene variants. However, this number is actively increasing as additional variants are described in the scientific literature and discovered in routine clinical testing and research laboratories. Pathogenic mutations detected during routine clinical testing of patient samples at ARUP Laboratories or those submitted by other laboratories will also be added to the database. As mentioned above, for variants included from the scientific literature, the database provides a linked reference to the PubMed abstract for each variant. Because the classification of each variant is directly based on evidence from the scientific literature, the link to PubMed is a very useful feature of this database. However, in cases where a variant has not yet been reported in the literature, the database provides the clinical and/or experimental, functional data suggestive of its classification. Laboratories and database users may also contact curators via e-mail or phone regarding database entries, additional references, or clarification of information posted on the site at any time. Figure 2  summarizes the content of the  SPRED1  database by variant classification and mutation types. Analysis of the different types of mutations currently contained in the database are provided, including deletion (16), large deletion (3), insertion/deletion (1), duplication (6), insertion (4), missense (23), nonsense (16), silent (4), intronic (4) and splice site effect (1). Clinical significance of the database Clinical and research laboratories that offer full gene analysis often encounter rare variants and must rely on the published literature or online resources to make informed decisions about the classification of the variant when reporting their findings. We developed this database to facilitate this decision-making process and assist those who interpret results and care for patients. A key feature of this database is the ease of access with which it provides pertinent gene variant information and the associated genotype-phenotype observations. In addition, the database is curated by individuals with expertise in molecular genetics and Legius syndrome, ensuring that all of the information contained in the archive is up to date and of sufficient scientific rigor. Finally, as this database is a publicly available resource, with no login or membership requirement, it serves as an ideal centralized resource to all laboratories offering  SPRED1  gene analysis, as well as to genetic counselors or physicians treating patients.",
