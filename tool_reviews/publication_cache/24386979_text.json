  "title": "Modulation of Ras signaling alters the toxicity of hydroquinone, a benzene metabolite and component of cigarette smoke.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Benzene is an established human leukemogen, with a ubiquitous environmental presence leading to significant population exposure. In a genome-wide functional screen in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, inactivation of IRA2, a yeast ortholog of the human tumor suppressor gene NF1 (Neurofibromin), enhanced sensitivity to hydroquinone, an important benzene metabolite. Increased Ras signaling is implicated as a causal factor in the increased pre-disposition to leukemia of individuals with mutations in NF1. METHODS: Growth inhibition of yeast by hydroquinone was assessed in mutant strains exhibiting varying levels of Ras activity. Subsequently, effects of hydroquinone on both genotoxicity (measured by micronucleus formation) and proliferation of WT and Nf1 null murine hematopoietic precursors were assessed. RESULTS: Here we show that the Ras status of both yeast and mammalian cells modulates hydroquinone toxicity, indicating potential synergy between Ras signaling and benzene toxicity. Specifically, enhanced Ras signaling increases both hydroquinone-mediated growth inhibition in yeast and genotoxicity in mammalian hematopoetic precursors as measured by an in vitro erythroid micronucleus assay. Hydroquinone also increases proliferation of CFU-GM progenitor cells in mice with Nf1 null bone marrow relative to WT, the same cell type associated with benzene-associated leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Together our findings show that hydroquinone toxicity is modulated by Ras signaling. Individuals with abnormal Ras signaling could be more vulnerable to developing myeloid diseases after exposure to benzene. We note that hydroquinone is used cosmetically as a skin-bleaching agent, including by individuals with cafe-au-lait spots (which may be present in individuals with neurofibromatosis who have a mutation in NF1), which could be unadvisable given our findings.",

Subsequently, effects of hydroquinone on both genotoxicity (measured by micronucleus formation) and proliferation of WT and  Nf1  null murine hematopoietic precursors were assessed. Methods Yeast strains and culture Diploid yeast deletion strains used for growth analyses were of the BY4743 background ( MATa / MAT \u03b1,  his3\u22061 / his3\u22061 ,  leu2\u22060 / leu2\u22060 ,  lys\u22060 / LYS2 ,  MET15 / met15\u22060 ,  ura3\u22060 / ura3\u22060 , Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA). The haploid yeast MORF (Movable ORF - [ 40 ]) strain for  RAS1  overexpression was of the Y258 background ( MATa ,  pep 4-3,  his 4-580,  ura 3-53,  leu 2-3,112 - Thermo Fisher Scientific Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL). Growth was conducted in liquid rich media (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose, YPD) for deletion strain growth curve assays, and liquid synthetic complete media lacking uracil (SC-ura) using either 2% dextrose or 2% raffinose as a carbon source for pre-growths of the overexpression strain for growth curve assays (detailed below). Liquid rich media for induction of protein overexpression for growth curve assays contained both galactose and raffinose (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% galactose, 2% raffinose, YPGal\u2009+\u2009Raf). Yeast hydroquinone exposures Hydroquinone (HQ) (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) stock solutions were prepared fresh in sterile nuclease-free water (ISC BioExpress, Kaysville, UT) and protected from light. Yeast deletion strain growth curve assays Yeast strains were pre-grown to mid-log phase, diluted to an optical density at 600\u00a0nm (OD 600 ) of 0.0165, and dispensed into individual wells of a 48-well plate (non-treated polystyrene, Grenier Bio-One, Monroe, NC). HQ stock solution was added to the desired final concentrations with at least two replicates per dose. Plates were incubated in a GENios microplate reader (Tecan, Durham, NC) set to 30\u00b0C with intermittent shaking. OD 595  measurements were taken at 15-minute intervals for a period of 24 hours. Raw absorbance data were averaged for all replicates, background corrected, and plotted as a function of time. The area under the curve (AUC), used as a measure of growth, was calculated with Excel 2008 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) and expressed as a percentage of the control. AUCs were compared with two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-tests, using GraphPad Prism version 5.01 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Data for each strain is derived from three independent biological replicates. Yeast RAS1 overexpression strain growth curve assays The yeast  RAS1  overexpression strain was pre-grown overnight to stationary phase in SC-ura 2% dextrose, diluted 1:100 in SC-ura 2% raffinose and grown overnight again to alleviate glucose repression. Cells were then diluted in YPGal\u2009+\u2009Raf to induce protein overexpression, and grown for 5 hours to mid-log phase. Cells were subsequently diluted to an optical density at 600\u00a0nm (OD 600 ) of 0.0165 in YPGal\u2009+\u2009Raf, and dispensed into wells of a 48-well plate. Hydroquinone treatment, plate measurement and data processing were all carried out in the same manner as for the deletion strain growth curve assays. Mice Mx1-Cre, Nf1 \n  mice (129SV \u00d7 C57BL/6\u00a0J) were generated and somatic  flox/flox \n Nf1  inactivation was induced as described elsewhere [ 18 ]. We refer to hematopoietic cells from these animals as  Nf1 \n  throughout this paper. Cells from wild type (WT) littermates were used as controls in all experiments. Mice were maintained in the sterile animal care facility at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and were fed pelleted chow and acidified water ad libitum. All experimental procedures involving mice were approved by the UCSF Committee on Animal Research. \u2212/\u2212 \n Murine cells Tissue was harvested from mice at ~12\u00a0weeks. Bone marrow (BM) cells were isolated from the hind legs and were mechanically dissociated by pipetting in Iscove\u2019s modified Dulbecco\u2019s medium (IMDM) with L-glutamine/4% FBS (IMDM \u2013 Lonza, Walkersville, MD). Single-cell suspensions were prepared by passing dissociated cells through 70\u00a0\u03bcm cell strainers. BM cells were counted using a hemocytometer. Erythropoietic culture Total BM cells were labeled with biotin-conjugated \u03b1-Lin Abs, consisting of \u03b1 -CD3e, \u03b1 -CD11b, \u03b1 -CD45R/B220, \u03b1 -Ly6G/Ly6C, and \u03b1 -TER-119 Abs (2\u00a0\u03bcl of each Ab/10 6  cells; BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), and Lineage-marker-negative (Lin - ) cells were purified through a 0.3-in StemSep negative selection column as per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada). Purified cells were seeded in fibronectin-coated (2\u00a0\u03bcg/cm 2 ) tissue culture treated 24-well polystyrene plates (BD Falcon, BD Biosciences San Jose, CA) at a cell density of 10 5  cells/ml. On the first day, purified cells were cultured in IMDM containing basal supplements consisting of: 15% FBS, 1% detoxified BSA, 200\u00a0\u03bcg/ml holotransferrin (Sigma, St Louis, MO), 10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml recombinant human insulin (Sigma), 10 -4 \u00a0M \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50\u00a0\u03bcg/ml streptomycin; as well as soluble erythropoietic factors including erythropoietin (Epo - Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA) at 7.5 units/ml and stem cell factor (SCF - R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) at 10\u00a0ng/ml. For all cultures, media was replaced with erythroid-differentiation medium (EDM) (IMDM with 20% FBS, and 10 -4 \u00a0M \u03b2-mercaptoethanol) after 1 day of culture. At harvest, suspended cells were removed from culture wells by pipetting, and the culture well was then incubated in PBS/10% FBS/5\u00a0mM EDTA for 5 minutes at 37\u00b0C to dissociate adherent cells. Dissociated cells were then removed from the culture well by pipetting and combined with the suspended cell fraction from the same culture well for analysis. Viable cell counts, based on trypan blue exclusion, were conducted using a hemocytometer. Genotoxic treatment of erythropoietic cultures Lin -  BM was cultured in 500\u00a0\u03bcl of medium per culture well according to the method described for erythropoietic culture. Cultures were treated one hour before being washed and fed with EDM, as earlier described. HQ solutions were prepared immediately before treatment and protected from light to minimize degradation and decreased reactivity. HQ (Sigma) was first dissolved in warm PBS to make a 10\u00a0mM stock solution. This 10\u00a0mM solution was diluted in 4\u00b0C PBS to produce 7.575\u00a0mM and 5.05\u00a0mM solutions, and 5\u00a0\u03bcl of a solution was added to each culture to expose them to the targeted concentrations of HQ (100\u00a0\u03bcM, 75\u00a0\u03bcM, and 50\u00a0\u03bcM). Cytospin preparation and cytological staining Approximately 2\u00d710 4  cells per culture were centrifuged onto slides for 2 minutes at 800\u00a0rpm (Statspin Cytofuge 2; Iris Sample Processing Westwood, MA) and air-dried. For acridine orange staining, cells were fixed in 25\u00b0C methanol for 10 minutes and stained in acridine orange (Sigma) at a concentration of 20\u00a0\u03bcg/ml in staining buffer (19\u00a0mM NaH 2 PO 4  and 81\u00a0mM Na 2 HPO 4 ) for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Following acridine orange staining, slides were protected from light, washed for 10 minutes in 4\u00b0C staining buffer, air-dried, and stored at 4\u00b0C until microscopic examination and scoring was complete. Histological imaging and quantification Slides were examined by using an Axioplan 2 microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, Germany) and representative micrographs were acquired by using Axiocam MRm (Carl Zeiss). Micrographs of acridine orange stained cells were acquired by using a 63x oil-immersion objective and fluorescence (100\u00a0W Hg lamp excitation). Cytological slides were examined blind, and differential cell counting was used to enumerate relevant cell types and thus quantify the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MN-PCEs) among total PCEs (>2,000 PCEs scored per slide). Statistics To determine the statistical significance of mean comparisons, distributions were first checked for normality by using the Shapiro\u2013Wilk's test with STATA 11 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Normal data sets were then subjected to two-way ANOVA analysis. Interaction between dose and breed was examined but found to be insignificant and so was not used in the model. Two-tailed Student\u2019s  t  tests were executed by using the data analysis tool in Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). Unequal variance was assumed to increase confidence in significant p-values. Progenitor assays Colony forming unit granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM) progenitors were grown in MethoCult\u00ae (StemCell Technologies, Cat #03434) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Technical Manual Cat# 28405). Briefly, BM cells were suspended at 4\u00d710 5 /ml in IMDM/2% FBS and then 200\u00a0\u03bcl of this suspension was added to 4\u00a0ml aliquots of MethoCult\u00ae M3434, which were then vortexed briefly. A fresh solution of 10\u00a0mM HQ (Sigma) was then prepared in warm PBS and sterile filtered through a 0.2\u00a0\u03bcm membrane (Pall Life Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI). This 10\u00a0mM HQ stock solution was then further diluted to give 600\u00a0\u03bcM, 400\u00a0\u03bcM, and 200\u00a0\u03bcM solutions, and then 200ul of one of these solutions was used to treat each 4\u00a0ml aliquot of MethoCult\u00ae at a concentration of 30\u00a0\u03bcM, 20\u00a0\u03bcM, or 10\u00a0\u03bcM. After delivery of HQ, the MethoCult\u00ae was again vortexed briefly and the tubes were left to stand for 5 minutes to allow bubbles to dissipate. A 16G blunt-end needle and 3\u00a0ml syringe were then used to draw up the treated MethoCult\u00ae and dispense 1.1\u00a0ml into each of three 35\u00a0mm petri dishes (StemCell Technologies, Cat# 27100). These 35\u00a0mm culture dishes (3 per genotype/treatment replicate) were then tilted and rotated gently to evenly distribute MethoCult\u00ae and placed in a 100\u00a0mm culture dish that also contained an uncovered 35\u00a0mm culture dish containing 3\u00a0ml of sterile water to maintain humidity. The cultures were placed in an incubator and maintained at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2  in air, and >95% humidity for 12 days, then colonies were scored. The scoring scientist was blinded to the identity of each culture (genotype/treatment). Two independent preparations of each culture condition (combination of genotype/treatment) were used in each trial, and the entire experiment was repeated three further times using independent sets of  Nf1 \u2212/\u2212 /WT littermates.",

  "introduction": "Background Benzene is ubiquitous in the environment due to its wide use in industry for the production of plastics, resins, dyes and detergents, and its presence in gasoline. Hydroquinone (HQ) is a primary oxidative metabolite of benzene. Globally, there is extensive population and occupational exposure to HQ [ 1 ]. Both benzene and HQ are also found in cigarette smoke and HQ is the most abundant pro-oxidant compound in cigarette smoke tar [ 2 ], though HQ is also found in the plasma of nonsmoker individuals living a Western lifestyle [ 3 ]. In addition to industrial exposure, there is significant dietary exposure to HQ in the form of arbutin, a HQ glucose conjugate [ 3 ]. Also, in some individuals dermal exposure can be significant as HQ is used as a skin-bleaching agent, to treat conditions such as hypermelanosis, vitiligo, and cafe-au-lait spots. Benzene causes leukemia in humans (reviewed in [ 1 ]) and HQ itself causes DNA damage  in vitro . HQ is capable of binding to both DNA and protein, and can induce oxidative stress and inhibit apoptosis [ 4 - 6 ]. HQ is formed through a multi-step process involving the action of Cytochrome P450s on benzene in the liver and perhaps other organs. HQ can travel to the bone marrow and is oxidized through both autoxidation and by myeloperoxidase (MPO) to highly toxic quinones [ 7 ], thus contributing significantly to benzene toxicity. Ras proteins transduce cellular signals required for the control of cell growth and differentiation [ 8 ], and activating Ras mutations are present in ~30% of cancers [ 9 , 10 ]. The ERK effector kinases of the Ras/MAPK pathway modify diverse substrates which ultimately mediate cellular pathways controlling cell growth [ 11 ]. In a genome-wide functional screen using the yeast  Saccharomyces cerevisiae , we previously identified  IRA2  as required for cellular tolerance to HQ treatment [ 6 ]. Ira2p is a Ras GTPase activating protein (GAP) that stimulates conversion of Ras proteins from their active GTP-bound state to the inactive GDP-bound state. Deletion of  IRA2  results in an increase in active Ras (and thus Ras signaling). Heterozygous germline mutations in  NF1,  the human homolog of  IRA2,  cause neurofibromatosis type I (NF1), a common developmental disorder with an incidence of 1 in 3000 live births [ 12 ]. NF1 belongs to a group of disorders referred to as the RASopathies (reviewed in [ 12 ]), caused by germline mutations in components of the RAS/MAPK pathway that all give rise to an increased cancer risk [ 12 ]. Individuals with NF1 are predisposed to benign and malignant tumors, which typically arise in cells derived from the embryonic neural crest [ 13 , 14 ]. Children with NF1 have a 200\u2013500 fold risk of developing juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), an aggressive myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) [ 15 ]. Consistent with its biochemical activity as a negative regulator of Ras signaling, JMML and other NF1-associated neoplasms frequently show somatic inactivation or the normal  NF1  allele [ 13 , 16 ]. Patients with NF1 are also at increased risk of developing myeloid leukemia and other genotoxin-induced malignancies [ 17 ], and homozygous mutations in  NF1  were recently reported in a subset of adult acute myelogenous leukemias (AML) [ 14 ]. Homozygous inactivation of a conditional mutant allele of murine  Nf1  in the hematopoietic compartment results in a progressive MPD that models JMML [ 18 ]. Heterozygous Nf1 mutant mice are also susceptible to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and other genotoxin-induced cancers, and appear to be particularly sensitive to the mutagenic effects of radiation [ 19 , 20 ]. As with  IRA2  in yeast , NF1  mutations lead to hyperactive Ras signaling [ 21 , 22 ], and are consistent with the high prevalence of somatic  NRAS  and  KRAS  mutations in these cancers. The association between hyperactive Ras signaling and leukemogenesis is particularly compelling in JMML and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (reviewed in [ 9 , 23 ]). Altered regulation of Ras signaling and exposure to benzene and its metabolites are both leukemogenic, but the sensitivity of  ira2 \u0394 to HQ represents, to our knowledge, the first observation of a potential synergism. Other examples of synergism between exogenous compounds and altered Ras signaling include the observation that lung carcinomas induced by cumene (a compound structurally similar to HQ) have greater malignant potential in mice with  K-ras  mutations [ 24 ], and also that benzene-induced mammary tumors in mice show an increased frequency of  H-ras  mutations [ 25 ]. However, an association between Ras signaling status and HQ toxicity has not been previously defined. Here we report our study demonstrating the interaction of mutations in both  IRA2  in yeast and  Nf1  in murine hematopoietic cells with the cellular consequences of HQ exposure.",
  "results": "Results Modulation of Ras signaling in yeast alters the toxicity of hydroquinone IRA2  was previously identified in a genome-wide screen for genes required for HQ tolerance [ 6 ] and sensitivity to HQ was confirmed by analysis of the individual deletion strain (Figure\u00a0 1 A).  IRA2  is orthologous to the human tumor suppressor gene  NF1 , and expression of the human neurofibromin catalytic domain (GRD) in yeast recovers the phenotype of  ira2 \u0394 cells [ 26 ]. As Ira2p is a negative regulator of Ras (i.e. its deletion leads to increased Ras signaling due to decreased turnover of active-Ras) we tested other mutants in the Ras pathway that have altered signaling. Yeast has two Ras proteins, Ras1p and Ras2p, which are highly homologous to their mammalian counterparts. They exhibit some functional redundancy, like many  S. cerevisiae  paralogs, though Ras1p is specialized for proliferation-related signaling, whereas Ras2p regulates complex cellular differentiation (i.e. sporulation and filamentation) in response to nutrient starvation (reviewed in [ 27 ]). Deletion of  RAS1  results in increased tolerance to HQ treatment, whereas deletion of  RAS2  has no effect (Figure\u00a0 1 B,  1 C and Additional file  1 : Figure S1). To provide further mechanistic evidence for this observation that Ras signaling (through Ras1p) modulates HQ toxicity, we examined a  RAS1  overexpression strain, and this strain also exhibits increased sensitivity to HQ (Figure\u00a0 1 D). Figure 1 The Ras status of yeast cells modulates the toxicity of HQ.  The Area Under Curve (AUC) was calculated for each strain after 24\u00a0h of exposure to the indicated doses of HQ. The bars represent mean AUC as a percentage of the untreated for each strain with standard error of three replicates. Sensitivity was determined by comparison to the wild type strain (gray bars\u2009=\u2009wild type; white bars\u2009=\u2009indicated deletion/overexpression strain).  A ira2 \u0394 (increased Ras signaling) is sensitive to HQ.  B ras1 \u0394 (reduced Ras signaling) is resistant to HQ.  C ras2 \u0394 showed a response to HQ equivalent to WT.  D  Overexpression of  RAS1  (increased Ras signaling) results in sensitivity to HQ. Increased genotoxicity is seen in murine bone marrow cells lacking Nf1 following HQ treatment To determine if there was an influence of  Nf1  on DNA damage by HQ in mouse bone marrow cells, we assessed micronucleus (MN) formation using an  in vitro  erythroid MN assay [ 28 ]. Micronuclei are small fragments of nuclear membrane-encapsulated DNA formed by enucleation of cells with DNA damage during erythropoiesis. Measuring their presence  in vitro  can be used to sensitively detect compound genotoxicity [ 29 ] and requires fewer animals than other  in vivo  methods, while allowing for testing at an increased number of doses [ 28 ].  Nf1  null mice die  in utero , thus a  Cre/loxP  system was used to generate a conditional allele ( Nf1  flox) at the  Nf1  locus, resulting in ablation of neurofibromin in hematopoietic tissues following the induction of Cre expression using interferon gamma [ 18 ]. We first established that HQ can induce MN  in vitro  as it does in the  in vivo  mammalian MN assay [ 29 ], and determined the appropriate dose range. Lineage-marker-negative (Lin - ) BM was used as a starting population for  in vitro  erythropoietic MN experiments, and terminal erythropoiesis progressed normally as assayed by flow cytometry and histological examination (data not shown). Cultures were treated with HQ for 1 hour, starting 23 hours after seeding, and progressed normally through erythropoiesis. MN-PCEs appeared in both treated cultures and controls, but with greater frequency in treated cultures (Figure\u00a0 2 A). Figure 2 Detection of genotoxicity through  in vitro  erythropoiesis. A  Representative micrograph of Day 2 harvested cultures at 100x magnification. The arrows indicate normally enucleated PCEs, and the arrowhead indicates a micronucleated PCE. Scale bar\u2009=\u20098\u00a0\u03bcM.  B Nf1 \u2212/\u2212  Lin- BM cultures exhibit sensitivity to MN formation after  in vitro  exposure to HQ. The response of this erythropoietic culture system to HQ treatment is quantified by MN frequency in PCEs. Data presented is the mean of the \u201cn\u201d independent cultures\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. Lin -  BM from  Nf1  mutant mice and their WT littermates was then used to test whether the  Nf1 \u2212/\u2212  genotype affected genotoxic sensitivity to HQ. There was a higher recovery of Lin -  BM cells from the  Nf1 \u2212/\u2212  mice (0.7%) than the WT littermates (0.3%). The greater recovery of Lin -  BM cells in the  Nf1 \u2212/\u2212  mice is likely indicative of chronic polyclonal hyperproliferation due to hypersensitivity to GM-CSF, which is mediated by increased and prolonged Ras activation [ 30 ]. Regardless, upon culturing, erythropoietic differentiation in  Nf1 \u2212/\u2212  cultures was indistinguishable from that of WT littermates. The MN frequencies observed  in vitro  for both the negative controls and the treated cultures were higher than the levels typically observed  in vivo [ 19 , 20 ]. This increase may be caused by the relatively high rate of erythropoietic growth and lack of spleen function  in vitro ; increasing erythropoietic rates  in vivo  through bleeding [ 31 ] or exogenous erythropoietin (EPO) expression increases erythroid MN frequencies and has been shown to sensitize the  in vivo  assay to genotoxic exposure [ 32 ]. Cell viability at harvest was >85% for all cultures, but viable cell yields were lower for treated vs. control (data not shown). Cell proliferation and death were not explicitly measured, thus reductions in viable cell yields cannot be specifically attributed to cytotoxic or cytostatic mechanisms. Both  Nf1 \u2212/\u2212  and WT cultures treated with hydroquinone at 50\u00a0\u03bcM, 75\u00a0\u03bcM, and 100\u00a0\u03bcM showed a significant dose-dependent increase (two-tailed unequal variance t-test, p\u2009<\u20090.05) in MN formation compared to the respective controls (Figure\u00a0 2 B \u2013 significance not indicated). A two-way ANOVA analysis found that there was an overall significant difference between the MN frequency found in the  Nf1 \u2212/\u2212  cultures and the corresponding WT cultures (p\u2009<\u20090.001). A two-tailed unequal variance Student\u2019s t-test was employed to examine the differences at each dose. There was no significant difference in MN formation between the untreated cultures (p\u2009=\u20090.87) but there was a significantly greater induction of MN in the  Nf1 \u2212/\u2212  cultures than the WT cultures at both 50\u00a0\u03bcM (p\u2009<\u20090.01) and 100\u00a0\u03bcM (p\u2009<\u20090.05) (Figure\u00a0 2 B). This observation indicates that increased Ras signaling increases the genotoxicity of HQ. Murine bone marrow progenitor cells lacking Nf1 show increased proliferation relative to WT following treatment with HQ To further investigate the possible role of  Nf1  in development of hematological malignancies such as leukemia following exposure to HQ, we measured the proliferative ability of myeloid hematopoietic progenitor cells after treatment. We assayed CFU-GM colony growth at several HQ dosage levels for WT and  Nf1 \u2212/\u2212  bone marrow cells and normalized this data to the untreated controls (Figure\u00a0 3 ). HQ caused a dose-dependent decrease in the proliferative ability of progenitor cells in both WT and  Nf1 \u2212/\u2212  cells, in agreement with a previous study [ 33 ]. In both genotypes, colony formation was reduced upon exposure to as little as 10\u00a0\u03bcM HQ, and CFU-GM numbers continued to fall with increasing HQ exposure up to 30\u00a0\u03bcM HQ treatment (Figure\u00a0 3 ). At higher doses of HQ (e.g. 100\u00a0\u03bcM), all colony formation was prevented by excessive toxicity to both genotypes (data not shown). Unexpectedly,  Nf1 \u2212/\u2212  progenitors demonstrated significantly increased survival to HQ exposure in comparison to WT (Figure\u00a0 3 ) at 10\u00a0\u03bcM [p-value 0.0010]. We cannot ascribe these apparent differences to MPD in the  Nf1 \u2212/\u2212  mice because the inhibitory effects of HQ were normalized to growth in the absence of HQ for both genotypes. Moreover, the  Nf1 \u2212/\u2212  mice were euthanized at a relatively young age (12\u00a0weeks) and showed no overt evidence of myeloid disease as assessed by complete blood counts conducted on the harvest BM (data not shown). Thus, the difference observed is likely driven specifically by the HQ treatment. Figure 3 Nf1 \u2212/\u2212  hematopoietic progenitors of the granulocyte and macrophage lineages are resistant to HQ-induced toxicity.  CFU-GM colony counts, relative to untreated controls, are plotted vs. HQ exposure level for cultures derived from both WT and  Nf1 \u2212/\u2212  BM. Bone marrow cells from each genotype were treated with HQ in MethoCult\u00ae capable of inducing growth of CFU-GM colonies and then cultured for 12 days. In both genotypes colony formation was reduced upon exposure to as little as 10\u00a0\u03bcM HQ. CFU-GM numbers continued to fall with increasing HQ exposure up to 30\u00a0\u03bcM HQ treatment, and at all doses the  Nf1 \u2212/\u2212  BM appeared resistant to HQ-induced toxicity when compared with BM from WT littermates.",
  "discussion": "Conclusions Together our findings show that HQ toxicity is modulated by Ras signaling and that increased Ras signaling (by deleting  Nf1 ) results in both an increased level of DNA damage detected in erythroid progenitors and increased survival of GM progenitors. HQ exposure and pre-existing increased Ras signaling could increase the likelihood of leukemic transformation. Importantly, our observations with HQ are highly consistent with observations in human patients and in mice showing that heterozygous  Nf1  inactivation cooperates strongly with genotoxins (particularly radiation) to induce myeloid malignancies and other secondary cancers [ 17 , 19 ]. In addition to NF1, individuals with Noonan syndrome and other RASopathies could be more vulnerable to developing myeloid diseases after exposure to benzene. Of particular concern is the use of hydroquinone as a skin-lightening agent by NF1 patients. HQ is given to NF1 patients to treat the characteristic cafe-au-lait pigmentation spots, which are a key diagnostic criterion of NF1. Our work indicates that the interaction between Ras signaling, sensitivity to toxicants, and the development of neoplasia needs to be given further consideration. Such studies may aid in the development of more protective standards for sensitive individuals to occupational and public exposures to carcinogens such as benzene.",
