All animal procedures were conducted with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and in accordance with the NIH  Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals  ( 65 ). Animals. Inducible Plp- Cre  ( 66 ) and  Nf1 fl/+  ( 67 ) mice were maintained on a pure C57BL/6 background and genotyped by PCR according to publicly available protocols ( 22 ). Tamoxifen was administered to the animals at age 8 wk (see below). Twenty-nine animals participated in Rotarod evaluation (control,  n  = 14; Plp- Nf1 fl/+ ,  n  = 15), 19 animals in DTI (control,  n  = 9; Plp- Nf1 fl/+ ,  n  = 10), and 18 animals in rs-fMRI (control,  n  = 7; Plp- Nf1 fl/+ ,  n  = 11). Of the animals that participated in rs-fMRI, 13 animals participated in DTI (control,  n  = 6; Plp- Nf1 fl/+ ,  n  = 7), and 14 in the Rotarod test (control,  n  = 6; Plp- Nf1 fl/+ ,  n  = 8). Tamoxifen Injection. The injection protocol followed previous publications ( 21 ,  22 ). Tamoxifen (100 mg) was dissolved with 1 mL of ethanol and 9 mL of sunflower seed oil (Sigma-Aldrich). At age 8 wk, both controls and Plp- Nf1 fl/+  mice were intraperitoneally injected with tamoxifen (100 \u00b5L) twice daily for 3 d at the same time of day. L-NAME Injection. Fresh solution of L-NAME (L-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester, 100 \u00b5M in 1\u00d7 PBS; Sigma-Aldrich) was administered daily at 0.4 mg/kg ( 21 ). Animal Surgery. Before any experiment, to use our in-house designed cradle, we implanted headposts on the animals\u2019 skulls as described previously ( 34 ). In brief, the mice were anesthetized with isoflurane mixed with oxygen, which was kept at a level of 2% to 3% for the entire procedure. The skin was removed, and 3D-printed plastic headposts were positioned on the skulls and affixed with dental cement (C&B Metabond; Parkell). To prevent image distortions in MRI acquisition resulting from uneven surfaces, the cement was smoothed using a self-cured resin (general purpose acrylic resin; Unifast Trad). The animals were then left to recover and injected once with antibiotics (cefalexin 0.18 mg/10 g; Norbrook) along with systemic and local analgesics (buprenorphine 0.9 \u00b5g/10 g and bupavacaine 0.075 mg/10 g, respectively). Each animal was carefully monitored over the next week before entering the experiment. Rotating Rod Performance Test. Gross motor coordination function was evaluated using the Rotarod (Med Associates). Twenty-nine animals (controls,  n  = 14; Plp- Nf1 fl/+ ,  n  = 15) underwent one training session and one test session, each consisting of four runs. Every run lasted for 6 min, in which the rod accelerated gradually from 4 to 40 revolutions per minute in the first 5 min and maintained at the final speed for the last minute. Time to fall and peak speed were recorded. MRI Acquisition. Imaging was performed with a 9.4-T BioSpec 94/20 USR MRI (Bruker BioSpin MRI). A 20-mm receive-only coil was fixed to the cradle over the animal\u2019s head, and the entire apparatus was inserted into the MRI bore containing an 86-mm quadrature transmit-only coil (Bruker BioSpin MRI). DTI Acquisition. To characterize structural connectivity, we scanned 19 animals using DTI (control,  n  = 9; Plp- Nf1 fl/+ ,  n  = 10); one control was excluded due to extensive image distortions. Animals were first lightly sedated and fixed to the resting-state cradle with a custom-made mask placed over the nose, which allowed maintenance of anesthesia throughout the DTI scanning session while their respiratory rate was monitored. Data acquisition was performed using a diffusion-weighted spin-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) pulse sequence (repetition time [TR], 7,000 ms; echo time [TE], 21.68 ms). We used 30 noncolinear diffusion directions, a b factor  of 1,000 s/mm 3  with 11 ms duration of the diffusion gradient (\u03b4) and a separation time (\u0394) of 2.6 ms. The scan consisted of 24 slices of 400 \u00b5m thickness, with an acquisition matrix of 100 \u00d7 100 voxels and a field of view of 16 \u00d7 16 cm 2 , resulting in a resolution of 0.1 \u00d7 0.1 \u00d7 0.4 mm 3 . DTI Preprocessing and Analysis. Diffusion-weighted images were preprocessed using ExplorDTI ( 68 ), with tensors calculated using a robust estimation algorithm ( 69 ), together with motion and eddy current correction. FA and B 0  maps were exported to the NIfTI format. Brain extraction was performed, and a template, B 0 , for both controls and Plp- Nf1 fl/+  animals was created using Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) ( 70 ). The control template was registered to the Allen Brain Atlas ( 71 ), while the Plp- Nf1 fl/+  was linearly coregistered to the controls. A final diffeomorphic field from native space to the Allen Brain Atlas space for each animal was calculated and applied in a single step to native scans to prevent data degradation. Normalized FA maps were submitted to a two-sample Student\u2019s  t  test between controls and Plp- Nf1 fl/+  animals. For ROI analysis, we defined the regions manually based on the  t  test results comparing genotypes before L-NAME and calculated the mean voxel intensity within each region to assess rescue after treatment ( 72 ). rs-fMRI Acquisition. Eighteen animals were included in the awake resting-state fMRI experiment (control,  n  = 7; Plp- Nf1 fl/+ ,  n  = 11) which followed a previously published protocol ( 34 ). To reduce stress, the animals were lightly sedated and fixed to the resting-state cradle. During the 5-d acclimatization period, each animal was placed in the MRI machine and exposed to the different scanning protocols used, while the period of head restraint was increased gradually from 2 to 50 min by the last acclimatization session. Afterward, each animal was scanned before and after the administration of L-NAME for six or seven daily sessions of rs-fMRI at each time period. Each scanning session included structural and functional scanning. The structural scan was acquired using a T1-weighted rapid acquisition process with relaxation enhancement (RARE) sequence in coronal orientation (30 coronal slices; TE, 8.5 ms; RARE factor, 4; flip angle, 180\u00b0; in-plane resolution, 150 \u00d7 150 \u03bcm 2 ; slice thickness, 450 \u03bcm). Whole-brain functional scans consisted of 800 repetitions divided over four runs (200 repetitions per run). BOLD imaging was achieved using spin echo-echo planar imaging (SE-EPI) sequence (TR, 2.5 s; TE, 18.398 ms; flip angle, 90\u00b0; 30 coronal slices; in-plane resolution, 150 \u00d7 150 \u03bcm 2 ; slice thickness, 450 \u03bcm; the imaged volume was framed with four saturation slices to avoid wraparound artifacts). rs-fMRI Preprocessing and Analysis. The preprocessing steps have been reported previously ( 34 ,  73 ). In brief, the first two frames were skipped to eliminate inhomogeneity artifacts and the remaining frames were slice time corrected. To perform motion correction, the whole time series was corrected to the average of the first 200 repetitions using rigid-body correction ( 74 ) by calculating a coregistration matrix for each volume. The same averaged volume was then warped automatically, using symmetric diffeomorphic image normalization (SyN) with ANTs ( 75 ), to a predefined EPI template that was preregistered with the Allen Brain Atlas. To prevent degradation of image quality, the final displacement field for each volume, including its motion correction displacement matrix, was calculated and applied on each time-corrected volume. Whole-brain and ventricle masks were calculated automatically. Data-scrubbing procedures were as described previously ( 34 ,  76 ), with similar exclusion criteria: frame displacement threshold of 50 \u00b5m, temporal derivative mean square root area threshold of 150% the interquartile range above the 75th percentile with exclusion of one frame after the detected motion. Runs with fewer than 50 frames and sessions with fewer than 300 frames were excluded; 29 out of 208 sessions were excluded due to excessive movement or image distortion (control,  n  = 11; Plp- Nf1 fl/+ ,  n  = 18). After data scrubbing, the time series underwent demeaning and detrending to remove global mean and nonintrinsic trends, together with regressing out mean ventricles and vascular signals, and six volume-specific motion parameters and their derivatives were regressed out of the signal to remove sources of spurious or regionally nonspecific variance ( 77 ). Finally, bandpass filtering (0.009 to 0.08 Hz) and smoothing using convolution with a Gaussian function (FWHM of 0.6 mm) were applied. To estimate functional connectivity maps, we placed an ROI with a 100-\u00b5m radius and extracted the time course from each seed. A seed-to-whole brain correlation map was calculated during each session and averaged to produce a mean Fisher\u2019s  Z  transform,  Z ( r ), map for that animal. Finally, all the animal-based maps were averaged to produce one map for each genotype, which were displayed on a template registered to the Allen Brain Atlas ( 78 ). Seed-to-seed analysis was performed by calculating Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient between two seeds and transforming it using Fisher\u2019s  Z  transform to allow for cross-subject comparison.",

  "results": "Results We induced oligodendrocyte-specific Nf1 inactivation in mice and compared structural and functional differences from littermate controls (Plp- Cre  or  Nf1 fl/+ ). We induced Nf1 inactivation in 8-wk-old adult mice and 8 to 12 mo later evaluated motor coordination using an accelerating rotating rod and brain-wide connectivity using both DTI and rs-fMRI, and then evaluated the impact of inhibition, using L-NAME, on brain-related measures ( Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1. Experimental setup for whole-brain imaging of Plp- Nf1 fl/+  mice. ( A ) Oligodendrocyte-specific  Nf1  deletion was achieved by crossing of Plp- Cre  and  Nf1 fl/+  mice. Plp- Nf1 fl/+  and littermate animals received a 3-d tamoxifen treatment (twice daily) to induce the deletion in Plp- Nf1 fl/+  mice and create littermate controls (Plp- Nf1 +/+ ). The experimental timeline is shown for mice that underwent full evaluation including behavior, as well as structural and functional imaging. ( B ) A custom-built 3D-printed modular cradle allows head fixation for functional scans of awake passive mice. The same cradle allows the addition of a mouse-compatible mask that can be placed around the animal\u2019s nose and mouth to maintain constant anesthesia of the head-fixed mice for long structural scans. To evaluate motor performance and coordination, we used the accelerating rotating rod experiment over 2 d (four runs per day: control,  n  = 14; Plp- Nf1 fl/+ ,  n  = 15). Repeated-measures ANOVA ( Fig. 2 ) showed main effects of genotype (F A 1,27  = 6.3,  P  = 0.018), time (F 1,27  = 38.4,  P  < 0.001), and interaction (F 1,27  = 4.65,  P  = 0.04). Interestingly, Plp- Nf1 fl/+  mice demonstrated impaired initial performance (first run; Mann\u2013Whitney  U  test:  U  = 31,  P  = 0.0013) in the test and then caught up to controls (last run:  U  = 89,  P  = 0.4956). To quantify this phenomenon, we adapted a previously described analysis ( 40 ). In brief, we performed a linear regression from the first run until the run at which the animal first reached maximal performance (top speed of 40 revolutions per minute). From the linear regression, we calculated the intercept and slope that reflect initial motor coordination ( Fig. 2 ) and learning rate ( B Fig. 2 ), respectively. Plp- C Nf1 fl/+  mice showed reduced initial motor coordination ( U  = 42,  P  = 0.006) but a normal learning rate ( U  = 73,  P  = 0.17). Overall, the Plp- Nf1 fl/+  animals showed differential performance on the rotating rod, with impaired initial motor coordination but normal learning rate, leading them to learn the task by the end of the eighth run and then perform at the same level as the controls. Fig. 2. Plp- Nf1 fl/+  animals show differential performance on the rotating rod with impaired initial motor coordination but normal learning rate.

( B ) Initial motor coordination plotted for Plp- Nf1 fl/+  demonstrating impaired initial motor coordination. * P  < 0.05, Mann\u2013Whitney  U  test. ( C ) The learning rate is equivalent for both groups. To determine whether brain-wide genotype-specific changes in white matter integrity in this model alter FA, we scanned controls and Plp- Nf1 fl/+  mice using DTI. We calculated and coregistered FA maps of each animal onto a common atlas and then compared the genotypes with a whole-brain voxel-based two-sample Student\u2019s  t  test. We observed a widespread, mostly symmetrical, reduction in FA across the brain ( Fig. 3 ), similar to that reported in NF1 patients. We focused on selected white matter tracts as regions of interest (ROIs) to quantify effects. To evaluate the effects of treatment, some of the animals (controls,  A n  = 8; Plp- Nf1 fl/+ ,  n  = 10) underwent intraperitoneal injection of L-NAME for seven consecutive days, followed by a repeated DTI scan to examine the same ROIs ( Fig. 3 ). We observed a reliable recovery of FA to control levels in six out of seven regions including the brachium of superior colliculus (Z = 2.31,  B P  = 0.01), fasciculus reticulata (Z = 2.03,  P  = 0.02), internal capsule (Z = 1.75,  P  = 0.04), medial lemniscus (Z = 1.89,  P  = 0.03), posterior commissure (Z = 2.45,  P  = 0.007) and the anterior corpus callosum (aCC) (Z = 2.45,  P  = 0.007), and a trend toward recovery in the optic nerve (Z = 1.47,  P  = 0.07). When considered with a conservative correction for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method, the aCC and posterior commissure remained statistically significant at \u03b1 < 0.05. Taken together, the voxel-based analysis of FA shows white matter regions of marked difference between Plp- Nf1 fl/+  and controls, with rescue to normal FA levels after inhibition of NOS. Fig. 3. Brain-wide white matter changes in PLP mice show significant differences that are rescued by L-NAME treatment.

( B ) Response of selected brain structures to pharmacologic inhibition of NOS (by L-NAME treatment) in both genotypes.  # P  < 0.1; * P  < 0.05; ** P  < 0.01, Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Based on our whole-brain DTI analysis showing structural damage in Plp- Nf1 fl/+  mice, together with our previous evidence of disrupted white matter integrity in this model ( 21 ,  22 ), we hypothesized that Plp- Nf1 fl/+  mice would also show disrupted functional connectivity. To test this hypothesis, we acclimated 18 animals (controls,  n  = 7; Plp- Nf1 fl/+ ,  n  = 11; some DTI sessions were excluded due to image distortions) for awake head-fixed rs-fMRI. We scanned each mouse for five or six sessions (one session per day), administered L-NAME for seven consecutive days, and then scanned for six additional sessions. We focused on the motor cortex, as the aCC connectivity exhibited significantly reduced FA. The aCC contains axons related to the somatomotor system connecting the two hemispheres, and the integrity of this system is reflected in rotarod performance ( 41 ). As expected, the control group showed homotopicity (symmetric bilateral correlations), a hallmark of rs-fMRI in humans and rodents ( 29 ,  32 ,  34 ,  35 ,  42 ). In contrast, Plp- Nf1 fl/+  mice showed reduced interhemispheric connectivity ( Fig. 4  ; Mann\u2013Whitney  A  and  B U  test:  U  = 15,  P  = 0.037). This reduced connectivity was rescued by L-NAME administration ( Fig. 4 ; Wilcoxon signed-rank test: Z = 2.134,  B P  = 0.033). Collectively, these results indicate that the inhibition of NOS rescues both structural integrity and functional connectivity in Plp- Nf1 fl/+  animals. Fig. 4. Reduced brain-wide connectivity in the motor network is rescued by L-NAME treatment. ( A ) Group average correlation maps demonstrate reduced interhemispheric connectivity between control ( Top ) and Plp- Nf1 fl/+  ( Bottom ) mice.

( B ) Correlation of seed-to-seed analysis in the primary motor cortex (denoted as a plus sign in the maps shown in  A ), plotted for each group before and after L-NAME treatment, demonstrating reduced connectivity between control and Plp- Nf1 fl/+  that is rescued by inhibition of NOS. ( C ) FA in the corpus callosum is plotted as a function of interhemispheric functional connectivity of the motor cortex. The dashed lines represent linear fit for control ( blue ) and Plp- Nf1 fl/+  ( red ). ( D ) Structural and functional change due to treatment are plotted. FA change ratio defined as   and functional connectivity  FA after FA before Z ( r ) change ratio defined as   are plotted. Dashed lines represent linear fit for control and Plp- Z ( r ) after Z ( r ) before Nf1 fl/+ . To exclude the possibility that increased NO in Plp- Nf1 fl/+  animals causes a global change in brain neurovascular coupling that account for these changes in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal on fMRI, we tested whether the Plp- Nf1 fl/+  group shows a nonspecific difference in all interhemispheric connectivity, relative to controls. We divided the cortex into six modules based on Harris et al. ( 43 ), further dividing the somatosensory and motor cortices such that the motor cortex is defined as the primary cortex and the somatosensory cortex is all remaining seeds. We calculated the average interhemispheric connectivity between seeds within each module for each animal, then compared each module between genotypes (Mann\u2013Whitney  U  test). No difference was observed in the anterolateral ( U  = 38,  P  = 0.5), somatosensory ( U  = 26,  P  = 0.139), visual ( U  = 24,  P  = 0.102), medial ( U  = 30,  P  = 0.234), or temporal ( U  = 27,  P  = 0.16) portions of the cortex. We observed a trend in the prefrontal cortex ( U  = 20,  P  = 0.052) and a significant difference in the motor cortex ( U  = 19,  P  = 0.032). Within the somatomotor system, rs-fMRI changes were restricted to transcallosal connections (Wilcoxon signed-rank test:  Z  = 74,  P  = 0.54). Thus, the observed changes in interhemispheric connectivity are not global and reflect the specific structural changes quantified using DTI. Reduced FA, an indicator of myelin integrity, is predicted to affect interhemispheric cortical connectivity, which is mediated by axons crossing between sides of the brain in the corpus callosum ( 44 ,  45 ). Therefore, we tested whether the observed FA is correlated with functional connectivity in mice that underwent both DTI and rs-fMRI. Plp- Nf1 fl/+  mice, but not controls, showed a significant correlation between FA and rs-fMRI results (control:  r  = 0.36,  P  = 0.48; Plp- Nf1 fl/+ :  r  = 0.9,  P  = 0.005), before L-NAME administration ( Fig. 4 ; control,  C n  = 6; Plp- Nf1 fl/+ ,  n  = 7). It is important to exclude the possibility that the apparent rescue of reduced interhemispheric connectivity in Plp-Nf1 fl/+  mice is caused by a global effect on neurovascular coupling caused by L-NAME. L-NAME blocks all NOS isoforms, reducing NO and impacting neurovascular coupling, and thus potentially the rs-fMRI signal. To exclude this possibility, we tested whether functional connectivity changed in the six cortical modules ( 43 ) in controls before and after L-NAME treatment. We observed no difference in functional connectivity (repeated-measures ANOVA; F 1,6  = 0.71,  P  = 0.43), suggesting that L-NAME at this dose and for this time by itself does not introduce a global effect. Thus, Plp- Nf1 fl/+  mice treated with L-NAME show specific changes in transcallosal motor system connectivity, which are detectable by rs-fMRI. These results are consistent with the demonstrated effects of L-NAME on FA in Plp- Nf1 fl/+  mice noted above. Changes in FA during normal maturation, aging, and disease are thought to reflect changes in myelin structure at least partially ( 46 ,  47 ). However, there was no significant correlation between FA and rs-fMRI in either group (all:  r  = 0.43,  P  = 0.14; control:  r  = 0.45,  P  = 0.39; Plp- Nf1 fl/+ :  r  = 0.65,  P  = 0.12). Therefore, we tested whether the changes in FA observed after L-NAME treatment result in a proportional change in functional connectivity. We observed a trend for overall correlation ( r  = 0.51,  P  = 0.07) ( Fig. 4 ). When considered separately, Plp- D Nf1 fl/+  mice showed a significant correlation ( r  = 0.87,  P  = 0.01), but controls did not ( r  = \u22120.0332,  P  = 0.95). We conclude that Plp- Nf1 fl/+  animals with a significant difference from baseline demonstrate rescue in interhemispheric functional connectivity, which correlates with the degree of improvement observed in myelin integrity of the corpus callosum based on FA measurement.",
  "discussion": "Discussion NF1 is a common disease with multisystem effects, including cognitive/motor impairments and neuroimaging properties, that have been proposed to result from white matter abnormalities but are of unknown etiology. Previous evidence in the  PlpCre;Nf1 fl/  mouse model linked  + NF1  heterozygosity in oligodendrocytes, brain myelin-producing cells, to myelin decompaction. To test whether  Nf1  loss in oligodendrocytes is sufficient to disrupt structural and functional myelin integrity in living animals, we investigated the effects of oligodendrocyte-specific  Nf1  deletion using two noninvasive longitudinal brain-wide imaging systems. We found that a reduction in FA, a putative marker of myelin structure integrity, is widespread in Plp- Nf1 fl/+  animals, and that NOS inhibition by L-NAME rescues this defect in affected white matter tracts. Following evaluation of whole-brain structural disruption using diffusion MRI, we focused a functional connectivity analysis on the somatomotor cortex, which contains neurons whose axons travel in the damaged part of the corpus callosum identified in the DTI analysis. NOS inhibition by L-NAME rescued structural integrity and functional connectivity, and the degree of rescue was correlated in the two independent measures. Behavioral tests in mice allow measurements of motor performance and dysfunction in a tightly controlled environment and genetic background. Here we used the rotating rod test to examine motor learning. Mice with oligodendrocyte-specific  Nf1  deletion showed reduced initial motor coordination but no change in motor-based learning. The peripheral nervous system in the Plp- Nf1 fl/+  mice is not detectably abnormal ( 48 ), suggesting that this defect is CNS-based. Indicating the specificity of the  Nf1  effect in oligodendrocytes, mice overexpressing Plp in oligodendrocytes showed reduced learning and unaltered coordination in a forelimb movement learning task ( 26 ).  Nf1  heterozygosity in mice is associated with behavioral phenotypes including visuospatial memory and learning deficits, as in humans ( 49 ). The human impairments in fine motor coordination, manual dexterity, balance, and hand/eye coordination ( 6 ,  50 ) also have been reported in  Nf1  mice ( +/\u2212 51 ). In contrast to Plp- Nf1 fl/+  animals, which exhibited a reduction in initial motor coordination but a normal rate of motor learning, wild-type and  Nf1  mice showed similar short-term motor performance, but  +/\u2212 Nf1  mice showed reduced long-term motor coordination/learning not observed in the Plp- +/\u2212 Nf1 fl/+  mice ( 52 ). In  Nf1  mice, all brain cells (neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes) have reduced  +/\u2212 Nf1 . Our finding of intact motor learning in Plp- Nf1 fl/+  mice is consistent with neuron-driven NF1-associated learning impairment and a contribution of oligodendrocytes to motor performance. Resting-state fMRI measures slow coherent intrinsic fluctuations in oxygenated blood levels that are commonly observed between brain areas connected by monosynaptic or polysynaptic anatomic connections ( 39 ). Damage to white matter disrupts functional coupling between regions, suggesting that intact anatomy is necessary for functional coupling ( 39 ,  53 ). Here we observed structural damage in the corpus callosum, the white matter tract that connects the two hemispheres, and disrupted functional connectivity in the motor areas connected via this structure in Plp- Nf1 fl/+  mice. These findings are consistent with the motor coordination deficits in these mice being CNS oligodendrocyte-driven. We found that Plp- Nf1 fl/+  mice display reduced FA across the brain, as measured by DTI. While the FA change is global, it was most significant in the aCC. Importantly, inhibition of NOS rescued FA in almost all regions examined. Thus, a readout of myelin integrity recovers in adult animals after only 7 d of treatment, consistent with a similar rapid rescue of myelin integrity following NOS inhibition in this model measured by electron microscopy ( 21 ). This rapid response suggests that effects of oligodendrocyte precursor cells on structural change, critical for motor learning, might not be necessary in this setting ( 54 ,  55 ). Interestingly, control mice that received L-NAME showed increased FA variability, indicating a heterogeneous response of the normal CNS to treatment, consistent with the idea that an oxidant response contributes to a normal FA signal. A similar differential response of wild-type mice to L-NAME was noted in motor behavior tests ( 22 ). We observed correlations between the extent of change in structural and functional MRI measures and their absolute values. Functional connectivity and structural integrity each showed significant rescue before L-NAME treatment, but a structure\u2013function correlation was not preserved after L-NAME treatment. Both functional and structural imaging were acquired after treatment, but these tests were carried out sequentially; functional imaging was acquired closer to the treatment period, and structural imaging was acquired subsequently. These measures might become correlated after NOS inhibition by altering drug schedule, dose, or administration of different drugs. It is also possible that changes in myelination and axonal propagation integrity (which are thought to impact functional connectivity measures) are not rescued at the same rate. Additional studies are needed to characterize the timing of NOS inhibition on motor behavior and structural MRI and fMRI changes in NF1 patients to distinguish these alternatives and estimate the efficacy of interventions. Previous work identified aberrant functional connectivity in NF1 children and  Nf1  mice, with a disruption in association network organization, corticostriatal, and corticocortical connectivity without reduced interhemispheric connectivity ( +/\u2212 4 ,  35 ). This discrepancy between  Nf1  gene inactivation in all brain cells and oligodendrocyte-specific  Nf1  deletion showing reduced interhemispheric connectivity may be explained by  Nf1  mice having mutant neurons in addition to oligodendrocytes.  +/\u2212 Nf1  mice show aberrant neural activity that is mimicked by  +/\u2212 Nf1  deletion specifically in neurons ( 56 \u2013 59 ). In contrast, oligodendrocyte-specific  Nf1  inactivation impairs myelin-forming cells, disrupting cellular communication and indirectly influencing neurons. Thus, it appears that when  Nf1  inactivation is present in both neurons and glia, the net effect is increased cortical interhemispheric connectivity. Use of the Plp- Nf1 fl/+  animal model allows us to capture oligodendrocyte-specific features, partially recapitulating the human NF1 condition. Collectively, the impact of myelin decompaction on function is significant; however, this is not the only factor contributing to the cognitive/behavioral phenotypes of this complex disorder. Both DTI and rs-fMRI are commonly used techniques in humans. DTI may be useful as an outcome measure in future clinical trials, as FA is commonly used to identify white matter abnormalities. However, FA is not a direct measure of myelin integrity generally or myelin decompaction specifically; other factors, such as axon composition and spacing, also may affect this measure ( 60 ). With these reservations, given that myelin decompaction is rescued by administration of L-NAME in Plp- Nf1 fl/+  animals on the microscopic level ( 21 ,  22 ), we infer that FA, at least partially, reflects the integrity of myelin in this model. With respect to functional connectivity, rs-fMRI networks have been observed repeatedly and reliably under the presence of anesthetic vasodilators ( 30 ,  61 ). Anesthetic vasodilators impact the signal-to-noise ratio, but network organization is preserved. Thus, we propose that both FA and rs-fMRI can be used as outcome measures in clinical trials. We note that NOS inhibition via L-NAME is not commonly used in humans. Although L-NAME administration to patients in shock did not demonstrate any significant adverse events, it causes systemic and pulmonary hypertension and is teratogenic during pregnancy ( 62 ). Possible consequences of chronic L-NAME use in children are unknown. Other safer and/or specific NOS inhibitors or antioxidants (e.g.,  N -acetyl-cysteine) might be tested in preclinical or clinical trials and be better tolerated ( 63 ) than Ras pathway-specific inhibitors, such as MEK inhibitors ( 64 ), and any cognitive/motor rescue antioxidant affords may be of value to NF1 patients. In summary, NOS inhibition recues structural integrity and functional connectivity across the entire brain in the Plp- Nf1 fl/+  animal model. Rescued myelin integrity was correlated with rescue in functional connectivity, albeit to varying degrees, and the extent of rescue in FA is a predictor of the degree of recovery observed in interhemispheric connectivity. Given that this measure of structural MRI is widely used in humans, we suggest that it may be used as an outcome measure of future clinical trials aimed at rescuing myelin decompaction.",
