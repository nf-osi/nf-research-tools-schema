  "abstract": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are a rare type of soft tissue sarcoma associated with poor prognoses. The standard of care for non-resectable tumors consists of surgical excision followed by radiation and chemotherapy. MPNSTs are most common in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 but can also occur sporadically. Regardless of origin, MPNSTs most often rely on signaling pathways that increase basal oxidative stress. This provides the basis for developing therapeutics with mechanisms that can potentiate oxidative stress to selectively eradicate tumor cells at doses that are tolerable for normal cells. Artemisinin derivatives are a mainstay of malaria therapy worldwide, with a well-established safety profile. Artemisinin's antimalarial effects are due to an endoperoxide bridge in its chemical structure that induces oxidative stress. We found that artesunate (ARS) and metabolite dihydroartemisinin (DHA) are selectively cytotoxic to MPNST cells relative to normal Schwann cells with the endoperoxide bridge required for activity. Mechanistically, DHA induced oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and DHA-mediated cytotoxicity could be prevented with co-administration of the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine. Furthermore, we found that DHA was able to selectively remove MPNST from co-culture with normal Schwann cells. These data supports the further development of artemisinins for the clinical management of MPNST.",
