  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In epidemiological and experimental research, high folic acid intake has been demonstrated to accelerate tumor development among populations with genetic and/or molecular susceptibility to cancer. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant disorder predisposing affected individuals to tumorigenesis, including benign plexiform neurofibromas; however, understanding of factors associated with tumor risk in NF1 patients is limited. Therefore, we investigated whether pregestational folic acid intake modified plexiform-like peripheral nerve sheath tumor risk in a transgenic NF1 murine model. RESULTS: We observed no significant differences in overall survival according to folate group. Relative to controls (180 days), median survival did not statistically differ in deficient (174 days, P = 0.56) or supplemented (177 days, P = 0.13) folate groups. Dietary folate intake was positively associated with RBC folate levels at weaning, (P = 0.023, 0.0096, and 0.0006 for deficient vs. control, control vs. supplemented, and deficient vs. supplemented groups, respectively). Dorsal root ganglia (DRG), brachial plexi, and sciatic nerves were assessed according to folate group. Mice in the folate deficient group had significantly more enlarged DRG relative to controls (P = 0.044), but no other groups statistically differed. No significant differences for brachial plexi or sciatic nerve enlargement were observed according to folate status.",
