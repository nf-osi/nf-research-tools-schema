  "abstract": "Neurofibromin regulates somatic growth through the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.  Hegedus B(1), Yeh TH, Lee DY, Emnett RJ, Li J, Gutmann DH.  Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis,  MO 63110, USA.  To study the role of the neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) gene in mammalian brain  development, we recently generated mice in which Nf1 gene inactivation occurs in  neuroglial progenitor cells using the brain lipid binding protein (BLBP)  promoter. We found that Nf1(BLBP)CKO mice exhibit significantly reduced body  weights and anterior pituitary gland sizes. We further demonstrate that the  small anterior pituitary size reflects loss of neurofibromin expression in the  hypothalamus, leading to reduced growth hormone releasing hormone, pituitary  growth hormone (GH) and liver insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) production.  Since neurofibromin both negatively regulates Ras activity and positively  modulates cAMP levels, we examined the signaling pathway responsible for these  abnormalities. While BLBP-mediated expression of an activated Ras molecule did  not recapitulate the body weight and hypothalamic/pituitary defects, treatment  of Nf1(BLBP)CKO mice with rolipram to increase cAMP levels resulted in a partial  restoration of the body weight phenotype. Furthermore, conditional expression of  the Ras regulatory GAP domain of neurofibromin also did not rescue the body  weight or Igf1 mRNA defects in Nf1(BLBP)CKO mice. Collectively, these data  demonstrate a critical role for neurofibromin in hypothalamic-pituitary axis  function and provide further insights into the short stature and GH deficits  seen in children with NF1.
