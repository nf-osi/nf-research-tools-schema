  "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common hereditary neurocutaneous disorders. In addition to skin pigmentation and cutaneous neurofibroma, some patients developed the plexiform neurofibroma since birth. Plexiform neurofibroma has abundant Schwann cells, fibroblasts, mast cells, blood vessels, and connective tissues, which increases the risk of developing a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). MPNST is a highly invasive cancer with no effective therapeutic agent. Cordycepin or 3'-deoxyadenosine is an extract from cordyceps militaris, which has been reported as an anti-inflammation and anti-tumor agent. Herein, we evaluated cordycepin's anti-proliferative effect on MPNST cell lines both ",
