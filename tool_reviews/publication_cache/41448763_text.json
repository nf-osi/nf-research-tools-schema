  "abstract": "This study proposes an automated neurofibroma detection method for whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WBMRI) based on radiomics and ensemble learning. A dynamic weighted box fusion mechanism integrating two dimensional (2D) object detection and three dimensional (3D) segmentation is developed, where the fusion weights are dynamically adjusted according to the respective performance of the models in different tasks. The 3D segmentation model leverages spatial structural information to effectively compensate for the limited boundary perception capability of 2D methods. In addition, a radiomics-based false positive reduction strategy is introduced to improve the robustness of the detection system. The proposed method is evaluated on 158 clinical WBMRI cases with a total of 1,380 annotated tumor samples, using five-fold cross-validation. Experimental results show that, compared with the best-performing single model, the proposed approach achieves notable improvements in average precision, sensitivity, and overall performance metrics, while reducing the average number of false positives by 17.68. These findings demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high detection accuracy with enhanced false positive suppression and strong generalization potential.",
