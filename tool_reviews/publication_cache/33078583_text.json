  "title": "Cell autonomous requirement of neurofibromin (Nf1) for postnatal muscle hypertrophic growth and metabolic homeostasis.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a multi-organ disease caused by mutations in neurofibromin 1 (NF1). Amongst other features, NF1 patients frequently show reduced muscle mass and strength, impairing patients' mobility and increasing the risk of fall. The role of Nf1 in muscle and the cause for the NF1-associated myopathy are mostly unknown. METHODS: To dissect the function of Nf1 in muscle, we created muscle-specific knockout mouse models for NF1, inactivating Nf1 in the prenatal myogenic lineage either under the Lbx1 promoter or under the Myf5 promoter. Mice were analysed during prenatal and postnatal myogenesis and muscle growth. RESULTS: Nf1 CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate a cell autonomous role for Nf1 in myogenic cells during postnatal muscle growth required for metabolic and proteostatic homeostasis. Furthermore, Nf1 deficiency in muscle drives cross-tissue communication and mobilization of lipid reserves.",

Mice were analysed during prenatal and postnatal myogenesis and muscle growth. Methods Animals Mouse lines used in this study were described before: Myf5 Cre , \n  Lbx1 23 \n Cre , \n  Nf1 24 \n flox , \n  and Rosa26 25 \n mTmG . \n  All animal procedures conducted within this study have been approved by the appropriate ethics committee and have therefore been performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. Animal studies were conducted in accordance with FELASA guidelines and were approved by the responsible authority (Landesamt f\u00fcr Gesundheit und Soziales Berlin, LAGeSo) under license numbers ZH120, G0346/13, and G0176/19. Timed matings were set up, and mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation at indicated days of pregnancy; foetuses were sacrificed by decapitation. 26 \n Tissue processing and histology Forelimbs and hindlimbs of mice were dissected, limbs from the right side of the body were embedded in paraffin, and limbs from the other side were snap\u2010frozen in liquid nitrogen, followed by RNA, gDNA, or protein isolation. Adipose tissue was taken for RNA isolation and paraffin embedding. Muscle tissue was embedded with tragacanth (Sigma\u2010Aldrich #G1128) on a cork plate into cold isopentane for 10\u00a0s; then samples were transferred on dry ice and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Adipose tissue was embedded with paraffin after using PFA fixation and rounds of dehydration. Cryoembedded samples were sectioned using a microtome (Microm HM355S) with a thickness of 10\u00a0\u03bcm. For immunostaining, slides were fixed with methanol for 10\u00a0min at \u221220\u00b0C. Antigen retrieval was used for Pax7 staining with antigen retrieval solution (2\u00a0mM EDTA) for 10\u00a0min at 95\u00b0C water bath (Julabo). Slides were blocked with blocking buffer (5% BSA in PBX) for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were diluted with blocking buffer and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. To remove primary antibody, slides were washed four times 10\u00a0min each with PBX. Secondary antibody was applied in PBX for 1\u00a0h at room temperature followed by washing with PBX for four times. Slides were mounted with Fluoromount\u2010G (Southern Biotech, #0100\u201001). Imaging was performed on a LSM700 confocal microscope (Zeiss) with ZEN imaging software (Zeiss). The primary antibodies and dilutions used were goat anti\u2010collagen IV (Millipore AB769; 1:500), mouse anti\u2010MyHC type 1 (DSHB BA\u2010D5; 1:500), mouse anti\u2010MyHC type 2A (DSHB SC\u201071; 1:200), rabbit anti\u2010laminin (Sigma\u2010Aldrich L9393; 1:500), mouse anti\u2010Pax7 (DSHB Pax7; 1:10), mouse anti\u2010myosin heavy chain (Sigma\u2010Aldrich 05\u2010716; 1:1000), anti\u2010beta III tubulin antibody (Sigma\u2010Aldrich AB9354; 1:500), and anti\u2010perilipin A/B antibody (Sigma\u2010Aldrich p1873; 1:250). For all the immunostaining analysis, three to five animals were used for each genotype as indicated in the figure legends. Paraffin embedding of adipose tissue from control ( n \u00a0=\u00a03) and Nf1 Myf5  ( n \u00a0=\u00a03) animals were used for haematoxylin and eosin staining; slides were fixed with 4% PFA at room temperature for 10\u00a0min and then incubated with haematoxylin (Carl Roth 3816) for 1\u00a0min, followed by eosin (Sigma Aldrich #15086\u201094\u20109) staining for 30\u00a0s. Slides were dehydrated by incubation for 5\u00a0min each in 70% EtOH\u201380% EtOH\u201390% EtOH\u2013100% EtOH\u2013xylene (Carl Roth #CN80). Slides were mounted with Permount medium (Science Service E17986). Oil Red O staining was performed with control ( n \u00a0=\u00a03) and Nf1 Myf5  ( n \u00a0=\u00a03) muscle sections from different development stages; slides were rinsed with 60% isopropanol (Carl Roth 6752) for 10\u00a0min followed by incubation with Oil Red O (Sigma Aldrich O0625) staining solution (0.5\u00a0g Oil Red O in 100\u00a0mL isopropanol) for 15\u00a0min. Then slides were rinsed with 60% isopropanol for 10\u00a0min and washed with PBS before mounting and imaging. Quantitative RT\u2013PCR Total RNA was isolated with RNeasy Micro Kit or RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized using 1\u00a0\u03bcg of mRNA with SuperScript\u2122 III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen 18080044), Oligo(dT)20 Primer (Invitrogen 18418020), and RNaseOUT Recombinant Ribonuclease Inhibitor (ThermoFisher Scientific 10777019) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturers. In brief, 1:10 cDNA dilution was used for each reaction of quantitative RT\u2013PCR analysis performed on an ABI Prism HT 7900 real\u2010time PCR detection system (Applied Biosystems) equipped with SDS software version 2.4 (ThermoFisher Scientific) using GoTaq qPCR Master Mix (Promega) or SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Life Technologies). Beta\u2010actin was used to normalize the expression of each gene. All primers used were purchased from Eurofins Scientific and are listed in the Supporting Information,  Table \n \n . For all assays, samples from three to four animals per genotype were used in three technical replicates. S1 \n RNA sequencing analysis Total RNA was isolated from tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of two p21 Myf5 Cre ;Nf1 flox/+  and two p21 Myf5 Cre ;Nf1 flox/flox  animals using RNeasy Micro Kit or RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). After initial quality control using Agilent Bioanalyzer, sequencing libraries were prepared from 500\u00a0ng of total RNA per sample following Roche's \u2018KAPA stranded mRNA Seq\u2019 library preparation protocol for single indexed Illumina libraries: first, the polyA\u2010RNA fraction was enriched using oligo\u2010dT\u2010probed paramagnetic beads. Enriched RNA was heat fragmented and subjected to first\u2010strand synthesis using random priming. The second strand was synthesized incorporating dUTP instead of dTTP to preserve strand information. After A\u2010tailing Illumina sequencing compatible adapters were ligated. Following bead\u2010based clean\u2010up steps, the libraries were amplified using 11\u00a0cycles of PCR. Library quality and size was checked with qBit, Agilent Bioanalyzer, and qPCR. Sequencing was carried out on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 system in PE75bp mode yielding between 45 and 72 million fragments per sample. Mapping was performed using STAR 2.4.2a software with mouse genome (mm9). Read counts were generated with R Studio function Summarize Overlaps and normalized to RPKM based on the number of uniquely mapped reads. Differential expression analysis was performed with DESeq2 using default settings. Genes with an absolute fold change\u00a0>\u00a02 and adjusted  P \u2010value\u00a0<\u00a00.01 were assessed to be significantly differentially expressed. A table of DESeq2 analysis can be found in the Supporting Information,  \n . Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed with the entire gene list using GSEA software 4.0.1 desktop (Broad Institute). KEGG and gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed using the Signature Database (MSigDB) and DAVID 6.8. RNA\u2010seq data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus database under the SuperSeries accession number  Data S1 \n GSE147605 . Immunoblotting For protein isolation, tissue homogenization was performed with a TissueLyser (Qiagen) with RIPA buffer (50\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH\u00a08.0; 150\u00a0mM NaCl; 1% NP\u201040; 0.5% sodium deoxycholate; 0.1% SDS). Protein concentration was measured with the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher #23225). Protein concentration from all samples was adjusted to 1.5 or 3\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL. Total protein (30\u00a0\u03bcg) was separated with SDS\u2010PAGE gels and transferred to PVDF membrane (GE Healthcare). Membranes were blocked with 5% BSA in TBST for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer and applied overnight at 4\u00b0C. Antibodies used were rabbit anti\u2010PPARG (Cell Signaling Technology 2443), rabbit anti\u2010phosphor (pThr172) AMPKa (Cell Signaling Technology 2535), rabbit anti\u2010AMPK\u03b1 (Cell Signaling Technology 2532), mouse anti\u2010\u03b2\u2010actin (Cell Signaling Technology 58169), mouse anti\u2010\u03b2\u2010tubulin (Sigma\u2010Aldrich T8328), rabbit anti\u2010phosphor (s235/236) S6 (Cell Signaling Technology 4858), mouse anti\u2010MyHC type 1 (DSHB BA\u2010D5), mouse anti\u2010MyHC type 2B (DSHB BF\u2010F3), rabbit anti\u2010phosphor (Ser473) AKT (Cell Signaling, #9271; 1:1000), rabbit anti\u2010phospho (Ser1101) IRS\u20101 (Cell Signaling, #2385; 1:1000), and rabbit anti\u2010phospho (Ser636/639) IRS\u20101 (Cell Signaling, #2388; 1:1000). Secondary antibodies were applied for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. Antibodies used were IgG (HRP conjugated) anti\u2010rabbit (Thermo Fisher; 1:1000) and IgG (HRP conjugated) anti\u2010mouse (Thermo Fisher; 1:1000). Images were acquired using a Fusion FX spectra gel documentation system (Vilber) with FUSION FX software. Blots images were analysed with ImageJ grey value analysis tool. For quantification, samples from at least three animals per genotype were analysed in at least three technical replicates. Proteomics sample preparation Three biological replicates of Nf1 Myf5  and control (Nf1 flox/+ ;Myf5 Cre  and Nf1 +/+ ;Myf5 Cre ) TA muscles from p21 mice were used for proteome profiling. Proteomics sample preparation was performed according to a published protocol with minor modifications. \n  In brief, about 10\u00a0mg frozen tissue per sample were homogenized under denaturing conditions with a FastPrep (two times for 60\u00a0s, 4\u00a0m/s) in 1\u00a0mL of a buffer containing 6\u00a0M guanidinium chloride (GdmCl), 5\u00a0mM tris(2\u2010carboxyethyl)phosphine, 20\u00a0mM chloroacetamide, and 50\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl pH\u00a08.5. Lysates were boiled at 95\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min in a thermal shaker, followed by sonication for 15\u00a0min, and centrifuged at 15\u00a0000\u00a0 27 \n g  for 5\u00a0min. The supernatant was transferred into new protein low binding tubes (Eppendorf, Germany). One hundred micrograms of protein per sample were diluted to 1\u00a0M GdmCl by adding 10% acetonitrile and 25\u00a0mM Tris, 8.5 pH, followed by a Lys\u2010C digestion (1:50) at 37\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h. This was followed by another dilution to 0.5\u00a0M GdmCl and a tryptic digestion (1:50) at 37\u00b0C overnight. Subsequently, peptides were desalted with C18 columns and reconstituted in 1% formic acid in water and further separated into five fractions by strong cation exchange chromatography (SCX, 3M Purification, Meriden, CT). Eluates were first dried in a SpeedVac, then dissolved in 20\u00a0\u03bcL 5% acetonitrile and 2% formic acid in water, briefly vortexed, and sonicated in a water bath for 30\u00a0s prior injection to nano\u2010LC\u2013MS/MS. Five micrograms of each SCX fraction and a non\u2010fractioned sample were used for proteome profiling and analysed by MaxQuant (v1.5.3.30). LC\u2013MS/MS instrument settings for shotgun proteome profiling with label\u2010free quantification and data analysis LC\u2013MS/MS was carried out by nanoflow reverse phase liquid chromatography (Dionex Ultimate 3000, Thermo Scientific) coupled online to a Q\u2010Exactive HF Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific), as reported previously. \n  Briefly, the LC separation was performed using a PicoFrit analytical column (75\u00a0\u03bcm ID\u00a0\u00d7\u00a050\u00a0cm long, 15\u00a0\u03bcm Tip ID; New Objectives, Woburn, MA) in\u2010house packed with 3\u00a0\u03bcm C18 resin (Reprosil\u2010AQ Pur, Dr. Maisch, Ammerbuch, Germany). Peptides were eluted using a gradient from 3.8 to 38% solvent B in solvent A over 120\u00a0min at 266\u00a0nL/min flow rate. Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid, and solvent B was 79.9% acetonitrile, 20% H 28 \n 2 O, and 0.1% formic acid. Nanoelectrospray was generated by applying 3.5\u00a0kV. A cycle of one full Fourier transformation scan mass spectrum (300\u20131750\u00a0m/z, resolution of 60\u00a0000 at m/z 200, automatic gain control target 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 6 ) was followed by 12 data\u2010dependent MS/MS scans (resolution of 30\u00a0000, automatic gain control target 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 5 ) with a normalized collision energy of 25\u00a0eV. In order to avoid repeated sequencing of the same peptides, a dynamic exclusion window of 30\u00a0s was used. In addition, only peptide charge states between two and eight were sequenced. Raw MS data were processed with MaxQuant software (v1.5.3.30) and searched against the mouse proteome database UniProtKB (UP000000589) with 54\u00a0416 entries, released in March 2016. Parameters of MaxQuant database searching were a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.01 for proteins and peptides, a minimum peptide length of seven amino acids, a first search mass tolerance for peptides of 20\u00a0ppm, and a main search tolerance of 4.5\u00a0ppm. A maximum of two missed cleavages was allowed for the tryptic digest. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as fixed modification, while N\u2010terminal acetylation and methionine oxidation were set as variable modifications. The label\u2010free quantification algorithm, implemented in MaxQuant, was used for data normalization. The MaxQuant processed output files can be found in the Supporting Information,  \n , showing peptide and protein identification, accession numbers, % sequence coverage of the protein,  Data S2 \n q \u2010values, and label\u2010free quantification intensities. The mass spectrometry data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium ( http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org ) via the PRIDE partner repository \n  with the dataset identifier PXD017958. 29 \n Statistical analysis was performed by a two\u2010sample  t \u2010test with Benjamini\u2013Hochberg (FDR of 0.05) correction for multiple testing. Significantly regulated proteins between Nf1 Myf5  and controls were indicated in the Supporting Information,  \n , and were submitted to DAVID bioinformatics 6.8 for functional annotation analysis. For comprehensive proteome data analyses, GSEA (v2.2.3) Data S3 \n \n  was applied in order to see if a priori defined sets of proteins show statistically significant, concordant differences between Nf1 30 \n Myf5  and controls. GSEA standard settings were used, except that the minimum size exclusion was set to 5 and KEGG v5.2 were used as gene set databases. The cut\u2010off for significantly regulated pathways was set to be \u22640.05  P \u2010value and \u22640.05 FDR. High\u2010resolution respirometry Extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and soleus muscles from 5\u00a0weeks control ( n \u00a0=\u00a07) and Nf1 Myf5  ( n \u00a0=\u00a07) mice were used in this experiment. Briefly, gently dissected muscles were put into ice\u2010cold biopsy preservation medium (in mM: 2.77 CaK 2 EGTA, 7.23 K 2 EGTA, 20 imidazole, 20 taurine, 6.56 MgCl 2 , 5.77 ATP, 3.95 phosphocreatine, 0.5 dithiothreitol, 50 K\u2010MES, pH\u00a07.1 at \u00b0C) followed by permeabilization with saponin (50\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) in biopsy preservation medium at 4\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min. Fibres were washed with mitochondrial respiration medium (MiR05, 110\u00a0mM sucrose, 60\u00a0mM K\u2010lactobionate, 0.5\u00a0mM EGTA, 3\u00a0mM MgCl 2 , 20\u00a0mM taurine, 10\u00a0mM KH 2 PO 4 , 20\u00a0mM HEPES, pH\u00a07.1, and 0.1% fatty acid\u2010free BSA) at 4\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min. All samples were kept on ice before analysis. The basic principle of this method is to analyse the respiratory capacity at 37\u00b0C in a hyperoxygenated environment using a multiple substrate\u2010uncoupler\u2010inhibitor titration protocol. \n  The following concentrations were used: 2\u00a0mM malate\u00a0+\u00a05\u00a0mM pyruvate (LEAK respiration), 5\u00a0mM ADP (OXPHOS capacity), 10\u00a0\u03bcM cytochrome c (integrity of outer mt\u2010membrane), 10\u00a0mM glutamate (OXPHOS capacity), 10\u00a0mM succinate (OXPHOS capacity), 0.5\u00a0\u03bcM FCCP (ETS capacity, ETSCI&CII), 0.5\u00a0\u03bcM rotenone (ETS capacity, ETSCII), and 2.5\u00a0\u03bcM antimycin A (residual oxygen consumption, ROX) that were used with high\u2010resolution Oxygraph\u20102k (OROBOROS Instruments). DatLab software (OROBOROS INSTRUMENTS) was used for data acquisition and analysis. All data were normalized to non\u2010mitochondrial residual oxygen consumption (after complex I and III inhibition by adding rotenone and antimycin A) and muscle fibre wet weight. Student's  31 \n t \u2010test (unpaired, two\u2010tailed) was used to determine differences between genotypes for each respiratory state. Whole mount  in situ  hybridization Embryos at the stage E14.5 were dissected and fixed overnight in 4% PFA/PBS. Embryos were washed twice in PBST for 30\u00a0min on ice and dehydrated through 25%, 50%, and 75% methanol in PBST (DEPC\u2010H 2 O), twice in 100% methanol for 10\u00a0min, and were stored in methanol at \u221220\u00b0C. Embryos were rehydrated passing through 75%, 50%, and 25% methanol in PBST (DEPC\u2010H 2 O) and washed twice with 1\u00d7 PBS (DEPC\u2010H 2 O) on ice. Afterwards, embryos were bleached with 6% hydrogen peroxide in PBST for 1\u00a0h on ice. After washing three times for 10\u00a0min in PBST, embryos were treated with proteinase K (20\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, Roche) at room temperature for 12\u00a0min. Embryos were washed with PBST, PBST/glycine, and RIPA buffer for 10\u00a0min each and fixed with 4% PFA/0.2% glutaraldehyde for 20\u00a0min followed by washing with PBST, PBST/hybridization buffer, and hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5\u00d7 SSC pH\u00a04.5, 1% SDS and 0.1% Tween\u201020, 0.1\u00a0mg/mL tRNA, and 0.05\u00a0mg/mL heparin). Embryos were pre\u2010hybridized in hybridization solution at 65\u00b0C for 3\u00a0h, followed by incubation in hybridization buffer containing a digoxygenin\u2010labelled  MyoD  mRNA probe at 65\u00b0C overnight. Embryos were washed with hybridization buffer at 65\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min, followed by digestion with RNase A at 37\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min. Embryos were washed with formamide buffer (50% formamide, 2\u00d7 SSC pH\u00a04.5, 0.1% Tween\u201020 in DEPC\u2010water) at 65\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min, followed by two washing steps with MABT for 15\u00a0min each. Embryos were incubated in blocking solution (2% foetal calf serum, 2\u00a0mg/mL bovine serum albumin dissolved in TBST) for 1\u00a0h and subsequently incubated with anti\u2010DIG\u2010Fab antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Roche, 11093274910) in blocking solution (1 in 5000) at 4\u00b0C overnight. Embryos were washed with PBST/tetramisol overnight. Embryos were equilibrated to ALP buffer for three times, 20\u00a0min each, and then transferred to BM purple AP substrate (Roche, 11442074001). For signal conservation, the embryos were washed three times with ALP buffer and then fixed in 4% PFA/PBS. Imaging was performed using a Zeiss Stereo Discovery V12 and the AxioVision 4.6 software (Zeiss). Measurement and quantification of MyoD +  stained area were performed on three embryos for each genotype with the Autmess function of AxioVision 4.6.",
