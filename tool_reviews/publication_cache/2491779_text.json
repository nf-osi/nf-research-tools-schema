Author information: (1)Department of Human Genetics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.  The von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1) gene has been mapped to the  pericentromeric region of chromosome 17. We conducted linkage analyses of NF1 by  using 10 polymorphic DNA markers from this chromosomal region. We ascertained 20  American Caucasian NF1 families (163 individuals, 98 NF1 affected) in Michigan  and Ohio and also studied a large family ascertained primarily in North  Carolina. The following markers were used in this study: HHH202, TH17.19, D17Z1,  ERBA1, EW203, EW206, EW207, EW301, CRI-L581, and CRI-L946. NF1 did not recombine  with either TH17.19 or HHH202 in any of the informative meioses surveyed  (maximum lod scores of 17.04 and 7.21, respectively, at a recombination fraction  of .00), indicating that these markers map very close to the NF1 gene. We also  report evidence of three instances of recombination between NF1 and the  centromeric marker D17Z1 (maximum lod score of 13.43 at a recombination fraction  of .04), as well as two crossovers between pairs of marker loci. We find no  evidence of locus heterogeneity, and our results support the localization of the  NF1 gene to proximal chromosome 17q.  PMCID: PMC1715450 PMID: 2491779 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",
