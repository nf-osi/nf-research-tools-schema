  "abstract": "Close flanking markers for neurofibromatosis type I (NF1).  Upadhyaya M(1), Sarfarazi M, Huson SM, Broadhead W, Fryer A, Harper PS.  Author information: (1)Institute of Medical Genetics, University of Wales College of Medicine,  Cardiff, United Kingdom.  A genetic linkage study with 16 polymorphic DNA markers spanning the region  17p11-17q24 in 22 NF1 families is presented. Close linkage between NF1 and eight  pericentromeric markers (HHH202, EW206, CRI-L946, EW203, EW301, FG2, p17H8, and  CRI-L581) has been found, probe HHH202 being the closest marker to NF1. Genetic  heterogeneity has been excluded. The study of multiply informative meioses  suggests that the probes HHH202 and RW206 are flanking markers for NF1. The most  likely order on the basis of multiply informative meioses and multipoint mapping  is pter-pA10.41-EW301-cen-HHH202-NF1-EW206-++ +EW207-qter.
