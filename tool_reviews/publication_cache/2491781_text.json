  "abstract": "A genetic linkage study with 16 polymorphic DNA markers spanning the region 17p11-17q24 in 22 NF1 families is presented. Close linkage between NF1 and eight pericentromeric markers (HHH202, EW206, CRI-L946, EW203, EW301, FG2, p17H8, and CRI-L581) has been found, probe HHH202 being the closest marker to NF1. Genetic heterogeneity has been excluded. The study of multiply informative meioses suggests that the probes HHH202 and RW206 are flanking markers for NF1. The most likely order on the basis of multiply informative meioses and multipoint mapping is pter-pA10.41-EW301-cen-HHH202-NF1-EW206-++ +EW207-qter.",
