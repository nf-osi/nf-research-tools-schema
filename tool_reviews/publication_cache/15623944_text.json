  "abstract": "DNA ploidy and chromosome (FISH) pattern analysis of peripheral nerve sheath  tumors.  Hruska A(1), Bollmann R, Kovács RB, Bollmann M, Bodó M, Sápi Z.  Author information: (1)Semmelweis University, Institute of Morphology and Physiology, Szentkirályi  14, Budapest 1088, Hungary.  Comment in     Cell Oncol. 2005;27(5-6):359; author reply 361. doi: 10.1155/2005/363704.  BACKGROUND AND METHODS: 44 peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNST) (27  schwannomas, 9 neurofibromas and 8 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors  (MPNST)) were analyzed to determine DNA ploidy pattern and to clarify the  conflicting data in the literature concerning this topic (whether benign PNSTs  are aneuploid or not). For further insight we analyzed 6 schwannomas, one  atypical neurofibroma and five MPNSTs by fluorescence in situ hybridization  (FISH) technique using centromeric chromosome probes (7, 17 and 18) and  automatic image analysis station, Metafer 4. RESULTS: Benign schwannomas (including the problematic variants as ancient,  cellular, neuroblastoma like and multiplex schwannomas) could be characterized  by euploid-polyploidisation and by their 4c peak height value which was usually  more than 10% of total cell number measured. These characters were not found  among neurofibromas and MPNST-s. FISH analysis revealed and confirmed that the  'normal' euploid-polyploid cells are mainly eusomic-polysomic containing two,  four, eight or sixteen signals for each chromosomes examined, but in a small  proportion aneusomy was found among tumor cells of benign schwannomas (average:  2.58; range 1.33-3.44). In contrast, the atypical neurofibroma displayed marked  aneusomy (18.44%) but it contained normal eusomic and polysomic cells too. Two  diploid MPNSTs proved to be clearly aneusomic with trisomy of chromosome 17 and  monosomy of chromosome 18. CONCLUSIONS: All these data suggest that ploidy pattern determination combined  with FISH analysis may be a very useful supplementary tool for making a right  diagnosis (to differentiate benign versus malignant schwannomas in problematic  variants) and to understand better the malignant transformation in PNSTs.
