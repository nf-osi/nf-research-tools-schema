  "abstract": "Phosphorylation of merlin regulates its stability and tumor suppressive  activity.  Ye K(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of  Medicine, 615 Michael Street, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA. kye@emory.edu  The neurofibromatosis-2 (NF2) tumor suppressor protein, merlin or schwannomin,  inhibits cell proliferation by modulating the growth activities of its binding  partners, including the cell surface glycoprotein CD44, membrane-cytoskeleton  linker protein ezrin and PIKE (PI 3-kinase enhancer) GTPase, etc. Merlin exerts  its growth suppressive activity through a folded conformation that is tightly  controlled through phosphorylation by numerous protein kinases including PAK,  PKA and Akt. Merlin inhibits PI 3-kinase activity through binding to PIKE-L.  Now, we show that merlin is a physiological substrate of Akt, which  phosphorylates merlin on both T230 and S315 residues. This phosphorylation  abolishes the folded conformation of merlin and inhibits its association with  PIKE-L, provoking merlin polyubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation.  This finding demonstrates a negative feed-back loop from merlin/PIKE-L/PI  3-kinase to Akt in tumors- The proliferation repressive activity of merlin is  also partially regulated by S518 phosphorylation- Thus, Akt-mediated merlin  T230/S315 phosphorylation, combined with S518 phosphorylation by PAK and PKA,  provides new insight into abrogating merlin function in the absence of merlin  mutational inactivation.
