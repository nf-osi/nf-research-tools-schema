  "title": "Identification of hub genes and drug candidates for NF2-related vestibular schwannoma by bioinformatics tools.",
  "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2)-related vestibular schwannoma (NF2-VS) is a rare genetic disorder that results in bilateral acoustic neuromas. However, the exact pathogenesis of the disease is still unclear. This study aims to use bioinformatics analyses to identify potential hub genes and therapeutic. We retrieved the mRNA expression profiles (GSE108524 and GSE141801) of NF2-VS from the database, and selected the leading 25% genes with the most variance across samples for weighted correlation network analysis. Subsequently, we conducted gene ontology term and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes signaling network enrichment analyses. The STRING database was employed for protein-protein interaction (PPI) axis construction. The mRNA-miRNA modulatory network was generated via the miRTarBase database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified via the R package \"limma\" in both datasets, and hub genes were screened via intersection of common DEGs, candidate hub genes from the PPI axis, and candidate hub genes from the key module. Finally, common DEGs were uploaded onto the connectivity map database to determine drug candidates. Based on our observations, the blue module exhibited the most significant relation to NF2-VS, and it included the NF2 gene. Using enrichment analysis, we demonstrated that the blue modules were intricately linked to modulations of cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, junction, and actin skeleton. Overall, 356 common DEGs were screened in both datasets, and 33 genes carrying a degree\u2005>\u200515 were chosen as candidate hub genes in the PPI axis. Subsequently, 4 genes, namely, GLUL, CAV1, MYH11, and CCND1 were recognized as real hub genes. In addition, 10 drugs with enrichment scores\u2005<\u2005-0.7 were identified as drug candidates. Our conclusions offered a novel insight into the potential underlying mechanisms behind NF2-VS. These findings may facilitate the identification of novel therapeutic targets in the future.",

  "methods": "2. Materials and methods 2.1. Data accumulation Publicly available NF2-VS mRNA datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus website ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ ).  GSE108524 , compiled using the  GPL17586  platform of the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome HTA_2_0 Array, contains 31 human samples stratified into 3 categories: 17 NF2-VSs, 10 sporadic VSs, and 4 normal nerves. In contrast,  GSE141801 , compiled using the  GPL13667  Affymetrix Human Genome U219 Array, contains samples from 9 recurrent irradiated VSs (5 sporadic, 1 cystic, and 3 NF2-VSs), 36 sporadic VSs, 13 NF2-VSs, and 7 control vestibular nerve tissues. Only the NF2-VSs and control nerves from both datasets were analyzed in this study. Data standardization was performed using the R 4.0.3. 2.2. Construction of a co-expression network \u201cWGCNA,\u201d [  an R package, was used to conduct WGCNA. The \u201cpickSoftThreshold\u201d tool was employed for the soft-thresholding power measurement. Subsequently, a co-expression network module was developed using the \u201cone-step network construction and module detection method,\u201d and the minimum gene quantity within the modules was set to 30. 9 ] 2.3. Selection of the NF2-VS-related module For the determination of major components of various modules, we employed module eigengenes (MEs), which utilize the first principal component of module expressions. We also evaluated the association between MEs and patient clinicophysiological information, and generated heat maps. 2.4. Functional enrichment analysis (FEA) To elucidate the roles of NF2-VS-related genes within the modules, we performed FEA of the strongly associated modules using the clusterProfiler package of the R software. [ \n 10 ] P  value adjustment was done via the Holm\u2013Bonferroni technique. The adjusted  P  and the  q  value thresholds were set to 0.05. 2.5. Generation of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) axis The key module genes were uploaded to STRING ( https://string-db.org/ ) to generate the PPI axis, and the results were visualized using the Cytoscape (v3.8.2) software. [  Individual node degree was computed using Cytoscape. Lastly, genes with\u2005>\u200515\u2009degree were considered to be candidate hub genes. 11 ] 2.6. Construction and analysis of the miRNA-mRNA network To explore correlations between miRNA and mRNA in the key module, we retrieved miRNA information from the miRTarBase database, including, over 50,000 experimentally validated miRNA-target associations. The miRNA-mRNA modulatory network was visualized using Cytoscape. 2.7. DEGs screening DEGs were identified between NF2-Vs and normal nerves using the R package \u201climma.\u201d [  The threshold parameters were: false discovery rate\u2005<\u20050.05 and |log 12 ] 2 (fold change) |\u2005\u2265\u20051. 2.8. Identification of drug candidates To identify small molecular drugs that may effectively inhibit NF2-VSs occurrence and progression, we uploaded our list of up- and down-regulated genes into the connectivity map (CMap) database. CMap, a gene expression database, was employed to screen for functional associations among small molecular compounds, genes, and disease status.

  "introduction": "1. Introduction Vestibular schwannomas (VSs) are benign neoplasms of Schwann cell-derived vestibulocochlear nerves. [  Approximately 90% of VSs patients experience progressive hearing loss, along with other symptoms like tinnitus and dizziness. The lifetime VS risk is estimated to be at 1 in 1000. 1 , 2 ] [  Most VSs appear sporadically, and are located primarily within the cerebellopontine angle. Approximately 5% of VS cases involve the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), present bilaterally, and have a genetic predisposition. 3 ] [  Bilateral VS is a typical Nf2-related vestibular schwannoma (NF2-VS) lesion. The NF2-VS is a rare genetic disease brought on by the inactivation of the NF2 gene on chromosome 22q12.2. 4 ] [  The NF2 gene product, merlin, is generally expressed at high levels in Schwann and nerve cells among adult individuals. Given that merlin contributes heavily to cell-to-cell proliferation and adhesion, merlin deficiency can potentially impair contact growth inhibition function. 4 , 5 ] [  Till date, there are no reports on the exact mechanism of NF2-VS pathogenesis. 6 ] Gene expression profiling is a robust approach for identifying essential pathological mechanisms, [  and one form of gene profiling, microarray-based gene expression profiling, is frequently used to screen for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) or novel biomarkers in numerous human diseases. 7 ] [  The Gene Expression Omnibus database contains certain VS gene expression profiles, 7 ] [  the integration and reanalysis of which may provide valuable insight into the pathogenetic pathways of NF2-VS. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) is a bioinformatics tool that describes association profiles between different genes. 8 ] [  WGCNA incorporates genetic and clinical information to precisely identify relevance of certain genes among various samples. Herein, we, for the first time, screened for candidate NF2-VS-related hub genes, and identified several efficacious therapeutic drugs for NF2-VS using bioinformatics analysis. 9 ]",
  "results": "3. Results 3.1. Weighted gene co-expression network (WGCN) construction The leading 25% of variant genes were entered in co-expression analysis. Sample hierarchical clustering methods were used to assess sample outliers in the  GSE108524  and  GSE141801  datasets, and  GSM4213477  was eliminated from co-expression analysis (Fig.  1 A and B). Next, the \u201cpickSoftThreshold\u201d tool from the WGCNA package was employed for soft-thresholding power (\u03b2) determination. The estimated  GSE108524  power (\u03b2) was 7, however, no suitable power (\u03b2) was detected within the  GSE141801  dataset (Fig.  1 C and D). Thus, the WGCN was generated using 6305 genes from the  GSE108524  dataset. Using WGCNA, 19 co-expression modules were identified (Fig.  1 E and F), and the gray modules represented genes that were not classified into other modules. Figure 1.

Identification of module-trait associations and key modules screening MEs were assessed for individual modules, and the association between MEs and NF2-VSs was computed. The associated heatmap is displayed in Figure  2 A. We observed a strong negative correlation between the blue module and NF2-VSs (R\u2005=\u2005\u22120.98 and  P \u2005<\u2005.001), as depicted in Figure  2 B. Additionally, the NF2 gene was also located within the blue module (Fig.  2 A). Hence, the blue module was selected as the key module. Based on our WGCNA, 215 candidate hub genes were finally screened from the blue module. Figure 2. Screening of key modules. (A) Module-trait associations within the generated network.

FEA of genes in the blue module Gene ontology (GO) term and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) FEA were conducted with the clusterProfiler package, and our conclusions are presented in Figure  3 . The analyzed genes were strongly enriched in the following biological process terms, namely, cell proliferation, cell migration, and movement; as well as the molecular function terms \u201cmRNA binding involved in posttranscriptional gene silencing\u201d and \u201cRNA binding involved in posttranscriptional gene silencing,\u201d and cellular components related to the collagen-based extracellular matrix, cell-substrate junction, and focal adhesion (Fig.  3 A). Moreover, the genes showed marked enrichment in 3 KEGG axes, namely, complement and coagulation cascades, tight junction, and actin cytoskeleton modulation (Fig.  3 B). Figure 3.

BP = biological process, GO = gene ontology, KEGG = Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. 3.4. PPI axis construction The STRING database was used to generate the PPI axis of genes in the blue module. PPIs with interaction scores\u2005>\u20050.4 was employed for PPI axis construction. In all, 33 genes (15.35% of the candidate hub genes) with degrees\u2005>\u200515 were recognized as candidate hub genes belonging to the PPI axis (Fig.  4 A). Figure 4. The blue module network.

The outer layer nodes represent genes with degrees\u2005>\u200515. (B) microRNA-target modulatory axis for the blue module. Blue triangles denote microRNAs, and green nodes denote genes. PPI = protein-protein interaction. 3.5. The mRNA-miRNA modulatory network construction The blue module consisted of 90 microRNAs (41.86% of the candidate hub genes). We retrieved 11 microRNAs (12.22% of the microRNAs) with |MM| >0.8 as candidate hub microRNAs. Subsequently, we employed the miRTarBase database to predict the target genes of 11 miRNAs. In all, 1586 genes were estimated, which were matched to 60 mRNAs (27.91% of the candidate hub genes) from the blue module. The miRNA-mRNA modulatory axis is displayed in Figure  4 B. 3.6. Identification of DEGs and real hub genes Following DEG screening based on the aforementioned criteria, 1124 and 1308 genes were identified from the  GSE108524  and  GSE141801  datasets, respectively. The top 100 DEGs for both datasets were showed in Figure  5 A and C, respectively. These genes shared 356 DEGs (17.15% of total DEGs) between the 2 datasets, among which, 232 (65.17% of the shared DEGs) were scarcely expressed and 124 (34.83% of the shared DEGs) were highly expressed. The volcano plots for the DEGs of  GSE108524  and  GSE141801  datasets were presented in Figure  5 B and D. Finally, 4 genes (1.12% of the shared DEGs) were screened as real hub genes upon intersection of the common DEGs, candidate hub genes from the PPI axis, and potential hub genes from the blue module (Fig.  5 E and F).

Screening of potential therapeutic drugs To explore drugs that potentially inhibit NF2-VSs development and progression, we converted the format of common elevated- and reduced gene expressions into probe IDs within the HG-U133A platform, and uploaded the information into the CMap database. Subsequently, negative enrichment score-based stratification was used to identify leading small molecular compounds for drug development.

  "discussion": "5. Conclusions In conclusion, herein, we demonstrated that the key gene co-expression module, hub genes, and several functional networks, such as, actin cytoskeleton regulation, cell proliferation, and migration were strongly associated with NF2 pathogenesis. We also identified potential drugs that may inhibit NF2-VSs. These results are crucial for the future development and management of NF2-VSs. We warrant additional investigations into the underlying mechanism of hub genes and functional networks that potentially contributes to NF2 development.",
