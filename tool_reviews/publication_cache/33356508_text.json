  "title": "C6 Cell Injection into the Optic Nerve of Long-Evans Rats: A Short-Term Model of Optic Pathway Gliomas.",
  "abstract": "The optic pathway glioma (OPG) is a slow-growing brain tumor that arises along the optic nerve or its downstream connections and causing vision to gradually worsen with time. This tumor forms in children with a genetic condition called neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), causing tumors to grow on nerves. In normal conditions, glial cells are there to support and protect nerve cells but, in NF1-OPG, glial cells have a genetic defect and grow out of control forming a tumor called a glioma. There are no rat models of NF1-OPG that can be used to explore various treatment options, and mouse models make interventional studies difficult due to their small eye size. We have created a model in which to study the progression of tumor growth in the optic nerve and establish the anatomical and functional consequences of the model and determine its suitability to serve as a surrogate for human disease. C6 rat glioma cells were injected into the optic nerve of Long-Evans rats and allowed to proliferate for 2 weeks. The eye clearly showed proptosis and lens opacity was observed, likely due to increased intraocular pressure caused by growing tumors. Hematoxylin-eosin staining showed marked cellularity, with hyperchromatism and pleomorphism. There was prominent area of necrosis with neoplastic cells palisading around the penumbra. Immunostaining with markers such as S100, \u03b2-tubulin III, Foxp3, CD45, Vimentin, and Ki67 confirmed low-grade tumor formation, with a mild immune response. Our results show the utility of a surgically induced rat model of OPG that may be used for exploring various treatment options for NF1 ocular tumors.",

  "methods": "Materials and Methods C6 Cell Culture C6 cells were cultured based on the protocol provided by ATCC (culture method, CCL-107, USA). Briefly, confluent T75, fibronectin (Akron)-coated flask (surface 75 cm 2 , vented cap, sterile, Nunclon Delta, USA) were washed with Hank\u2019s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, without calcium and magnesium, Thermo Fischer Scientific, USA) to remove any trace of serum before treating with 0.25% (w/v) trypsin\u20130.53 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Flasks were observed under an inverted microscope and incubated for 5 min at 37\u00b0C to reach complete detachment of cells. Cells were then collected, centrifuged, and resuspended in 1 ml culture media containing F-12 K medium (ATCC-formulated, USA), 2.5% of fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), and 15% of horse serum (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Appropriate amount of the cell suspension was seeded into new culture flasks (usually 2 \u00d7 10 5  per flask). Once confluent cells were further detached with trypsin and frozen in 95% culture media and 5% dimethylsulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) until further experiment. Cell number and viability were estimated, after each passage, using Trypan blue (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and a hemocytometer (Countess\u2122 II FL Automated Cell Counter, Thermo Fischer Scientific, USA). To prepare for injection, C6 cell suspension was prepared in HBSS at the 10,000 cells/\u03bcl. Optic Nerve Injection in Long-Evans Rat Twenty-four domestic rats of the Long-Evans strain (age 4 weeks with approximate weight of 150 g) were used as control and test recipients in the experiment. Rats were sedated using 2%\u20134% isoflurane (Abbott, Solna, Sweden), followed by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (40\u201380 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) combination for anesthesia. A drop of lidocaine (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was placed on surgical eye and artificial tears were used every 5 min to prevent dryness of eyes during the surgical procedure. Before starting rats were placed on stereotaxic frame with heating pad to keep them warm throughout the procedure. A 1-inch incision was made in the skin overlying orbital ridge using size 12 scalpel. Skin was retracted exposing underlying fascia, which was carefully dissected away. Utmost care was taken to avoid blood vessel, which could cause excessive bleeding and cotton swab was used to maintain hemostasis during dissection of fascia. Furthermore, with light traction on the conjunctiva while pulling eye downward out of eye socket superior orbital, muscle was exposed. Using a fine tip needle the muscles were teased out, which gave complete access to the optic nerve fascia. C6 cell suspension was prepared to contain 10,000 cells/\u00b5l and each test animal received 1 \u00b5l of injection using a glass micropipette of 105 \u00b5m diameter. The glass needle was mounted onto a micromanipulator attached to Hamilton syringe stand. After completion, the microneedle was retracted, and eyes were gently pushed back. The skin was sutured, and the animal was return to cage after full recovery. The research protocol was reviewed and approved by the Schepens Eye Research Institute Animal Facility and was in accordance with the Association for Research in Vision Ophthalmology Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. Tissue Processing Days 1, 5, and 12 were the time points to check the effect of C6 injection and its tumor formation ability. Both control and test animals were sacrificed by using CO 2  suffocation, and secondary step of puncturing major organ was used to ensure death. Eyes were enucleated by dissecting from the superior orbital side to obtain part or complete optic nerve and placed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 12 h. Tissues were subsequently treated with sucrose in increasing concentration (5%, 10%, and 20%) containing Sorensen phosphate buffer. One day before dissection eyes were transferred into sucrose: Optimal cutting temperature (OCT) solution (1:1) and, before mounting, with compete OCT media. About 15 \u00b5m sections were collected in poly- l -lysine coated slides. Histology and Immunohistochemistry Both control and test slides were examined using different stains. For histology, Thermo Scientific Rapid-Chrome H&E staining kit was used. This was 18-step process that permanently stains cytology specimens. Slides were dipped into series of solution containing 95% alcohol, distilled water, hematoxylin, Bluing reagent, and Eosin-Y stain followed by series of wash before final fixing step. Slides were then mounted and observed under upright microscope (Leica DM2500). Sections were stained with Luxol blue staining kit (Abcam ab150675, USA). Slides were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with Luxol blue solution for 2 h at 60\u00b0C, following which slides were rinsed with distilled water and differentiated by dipping into lithium carbonate solution. To develop further differentiation slides were dipped in alcohol reagent provided with the kit. For the final staining slides were dipped in Cresyl Echt Violet for 2\u20135 min following which rinsing and dehydration were performed before mounting the slides for visualization. For immuno-histochemistry\u00a0(IHC) staining, cryosections from Long-Evans rats\u2019 left eyes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS (Irvine Scientific, USA) at room temperature for 20 min. These sections were blocked and permeabilized with a blocking solution [Tris-buffered saline (TBS), 0.3% Triton X-100, and 3% goat serum (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA, USA,  http://www.jacksonimmuno.com )] for 15 min. Samples were then rinsed twice with 0.1 M TBS buffer for 15 min each time, mounted on polysine microscope slides and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C: S100-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (major protein expressed by C6 cells ), \u03b2-tubulin III-FITC (neurofibroma presence), Ki67-FITC (proliferation marker), Vimentin-antigen presenting cell (APC) (expressed by C6 cells 11 ), and Foxp3-APC and CD45 (immune response markers). After overnight incubation, samples were rinsed three times with TBS for 15 min. Secondary antibodies [goat-derived anti-mouse and anti-rabbit, 4\u2019,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-VioBlue] staining was performed for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were then washed a final time with TBS before being mounted on poly- 10 l -lysine microscope slides with low viscosity slide mounting medium. Digital images were obtained with an epifluorescence microscope using \u00d720 objective (Leica, DM2500). Electronic image files were processed using MATLAB software (MathWorks Inc., R2019a, USA). Flow Cytometry Assay of C6 Cells The phenotype of C6 cells was analyzed using flow cytometry with the MACSQuant flow cytometer (Miltenyi, San Diego, CA, USA). Cells were collected and fixed with Perm/Fix buffer (BD Biosciences, USA) at 4\u00b0C for 15 min. Cells were then washed in wash buffer (BD Biosciences, USA) and incubated, at room temperature, in blocking buffer (Pharmingen staining buffer with 2% goat serum) for 30 min. Blocked cells were seeded onto a flat bottom 96-well plate (polystyrene, Thomas Scientific, USA) and labeled overnight at room temperature with the following conjugated primary antibodies: S100-FITC, Vimentin-FTIC, CD45-APC, Ki67-APC, and GFAP-APC. Primary antibodies were diluted in 200 \u00b5l of antibody buffer (TBS, 0.3% Triton X-100, and 1% goat serum). After overnight incubation cells were washed three times for 15 min and incubated in secondary antibodies (goat-derived anti-rabbit and anti-mouse, DAPI-VioBlue), which were diluted 1:200 in antibody buffer (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratory, USA). Incubation was performed at room temperature for 3 h. Forward and side scatter and fluorescence signals from each sample were measured using the MACSQuant (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) flow cytometer. The results were analyzed using the MACSQuantify software ( https://www.miltenyibiotec.com ). For each primary antibody the DAPI-positive single cell population was gated. The ratio of positive cells in the gated population was estimated in comparison with blank and species-specific isotype controls. Image Processing and Analysis Seven randomly selected images were taken for each sample. To statistically analyze the field of view, an image processing MATLAB code was created, based on Otsu\u2019s method  (thresholding algorithm). For each image taken, the code calculates (with a tolerance of 0.01%) the surface covered by the cells of interest (in images taken with \u00d720 magnification). The number of colored pixels (green for FITC channel and red for APC channel) were counted and a percentage of cell surface coverage was created. 12 Statistical Analysis All experiments were conducted in  n  = 5 set. Results and values are represented in all figures with mean \u00b1 standard error using GraphPad software. One-way ANOVA analysis of variance was used following Student\u2019s  t -test for statistical analysis.  P  < 0.005 was considered as significant difference.",
