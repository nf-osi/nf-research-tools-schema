  "title": "Merlin/NF2 loss-driven tumorigenesis linked to CRL4(DCAF1)-mediated inhibition of the hippo pathway kinases Lats1 and 2 in the nucleus.",
  "abstract": "It is currently unclear whether Merlin/NF2 suppresses tumorigenesis by activating upstream components of the Hippo pathway at the plasma membrane or by inhibiting the E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4(DCAF1) in the nucleus. We found that derepressed CRL4(DCAF1) promotes YAP- and TEAD-dependent transcription by ubiquitylating and, thereby, inhibiting Lats1 and 2 in the nucleus. Genetic epistasis experiments and analysis of tumor-derived missense mutations indicate that this signaling connection sustains the oncogenicity of Merlin-deficient tumor cells. Analysis of clinical samples confirms that this pathway operates in NF2-mutant tumors. We conclude that derepressed CRL4(DCAF1) promotes activation of YAP by inhibiting Lats1 and 2 in the nucleus.",

See details in  Supplemental Experimental Procedures . Subcellular Fractionation Nuclear and non-nuclear fractions were prepared using NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents following manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Immunofluorescent Staining Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.3% sodium deoxycholate and 0.3% Triton X-100 for 30 min on ice. After blocking with 5% BSA, samples were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies diluted in PBS/2.5% BSA/0.05% Triton X-100. After washing with PBS/0.1% Triton X-100, samples were incubated with secondary antibodies diluted as described above for 2 hours at 4\u00b0C. Samples were finally washed with PBS/0.1% Triton X-100, rinsed with PBS, and mounted in Gelvatol. In vitro Ubiquitylation Assay Affinity-purified recombinant proteins, including E1 (Calbiochem), E2 (UBCH5c), GST-Cul4A, His-Rbx1, GST-DDB1, His-ubiquitin, and FH-DCAF1 and FH-Lats1 (purified from 293T cells) were incubated in 20 \u03bcl reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.2 M NaCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 4 mM ATP, 1 mM DTT) at 25 \u00b0C for 2 hours. Reactions were terminated by boiling in SDS loading buffer. Soft Agar and Tumorigenicity Assay For soft agar assay, cells were trypsinized, resuspended in complete medium, and plated in 0.34% low melting temperature agarose (FMC Bioproducts) in complete medium at 2\u00d710 4  (Meso-33 cells) or 1.2\u00d710 4  (FC-1801 cells) per well in 24-well Ultra Low Cluster Plates (Costar). For tumorigenicity assay, 1\u00d710 6  FC-1801 cells were suspended in Ca/Mg-free PBS and injected subcutaneously into the right flank of nude mice. Tumor volumes were determined by caliper measurement. Animal studies were conducted in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of MSKCC. Statistical Methods Statistical significance was determined by Student\u2019s t test unless indicated otherwise.
