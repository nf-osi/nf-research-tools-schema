It is currently unclear whether Merlin/NF2 suppresses tumorigenesis by  activating upstream components of the Hippo pathway at the plasma membrane or by  inhibiting the E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4(DCAF1) in the nucleus. We found that  derepressed CRL4(DCAF1) promotes YAP- and TEAD-dependent transcription by  ubiquitylating and, thereby, inhibiting Lats1 and 2 in the nucleus. Genetic  epistasis experiments and analysis of tumor-derived missense mutations indicate  that this signaling connection sustains the oncogenicity of Merlin-deficient  tumor cells. Analysis of clinical samples confirms that this pathway operates in  NF2-mutant tumors. We conclude that derepressed CRL4(DCAF1) promotes activation  of YAP by inhibiting Lats1 and 2 in the nucleus.
