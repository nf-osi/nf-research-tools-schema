  "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects\u00a0\u223c\u00a01: 2700 individuals (Lee et al., 2023) however the underlying pathogenic mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we performed simultaneous reprogramming and CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to generate pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs) lines and their respective isogenic controls from six individuals with different pathogenic NF1 variants. All iPSC lines had a normal karyotype, were pluripotent and able to differentiate into the three embryonic germ layers. These iPSC lines are valuable pre-clinical models to investigate the pathomechanisms of NF1 and can be used for future screening to identify new therapeutic treatments for NF1.",
