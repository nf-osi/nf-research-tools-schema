  "abstract": "We report here the use of multiplex fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for quantitative allele loss detection using microsatellites with 2-5 base pair repeat motifs. Allele loss of APC, DCC, p53 and RB1 in colorectal tumours has been reported previously using a variety of methods. However, not all workers used intragenic markers. We have used microsatellite polymorphisms which map within, or are closely linked to, these tumour-suppressor gene loci in order to determine whether these loci are indeed the targets for alteration in colorectal cancer. In addition, we have assayed two other tumour-suppressor genes, WT1 and NF1, to see whether they play a role in colorectal carcinogenesis. The putative metastasis-suppressor gene, NM23, was also investigated since there have been conflicting reports about its involvement in colorectal carcinogenesis. Allele loss was detected at the DCC (29%), p53 (66%), RB1 (50%) and NF1 (14%) loci and in the APC/MCC region (50%), but not at the WT1 or NM23 loci. These rapid, and mostly gene-specific, fluorescent multiplex PCR assays for allele loss detection could be modified to devise a single molecular diagnostic test for the important lesions in colorectal cancer.",
