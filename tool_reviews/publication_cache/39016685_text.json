  "title": "Chemical genetic screens reveal defective lysosomal trafficking as synthetic lethal with NF1 loss.",
  "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1, a genetic disorder caused by pathogenic germline variations in NF1, predisposes individuals to the development of tumors, including cutaneous and plexiform neurofibromas (CNs and PNs), optic gliomas, astrocytomas, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, high-grade gliomas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), which are chemotherapy- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with poor survival. Loss of NF1 also occurs in sporadic tumors, such as glioblastoma (GBM), melanoma, breast, ovarian and lung cancers. We performed a high-throughput screen for compounds that were synthetic lethal with NF1 loss, which identified several leads, including the small molecule Y102. Treatment of cells with Y102 perturbed autophagy, mitophagy and lysosome positioning in NF1-deficient cells. A dual proteomics approach identified BLOC-one-related complex (BORC), which is required for lysosome positioning and trafficking, as a potential target of Y102. Knockdown of a BORC subunit using siRNA recapitulated the phenotypes observed with Y102 treatment. Our findings demonstrate that BORC might be a promising therapeutic target for NF1-deficient tumors.",

  "methods": "MATERIALS AND METHODS Reagents Y102 was originally purchased from Maybridge (NRB04162SC). Subsequent stocks of Y102, along with JW-1, all Y102 analogs, and the azide-tagged form of Y102 were synthesized by Enamine (Kiev, Ukraine). Bortezomib (Bz; S1013), MG-132 (S2619), and Rapamycin (S1039) were purchased from Selleckchem. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate (HCQ; H1126) was purchased from Spectrum Chemical. tert-Butyl hydroperoxide solution (tBHP; 458139), carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP; C2759) and hydroxyurea (HU; H8627) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Staurosporine (STS; S-9300) was purchased from LC Laboratories. Cobalt (II) chloride (CoCl 2 ; 36554) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Q-VD-OPh hydrate (QVD; 50-101-3174) was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Stock solutions of compounds were prepared in 100% DMSO (Alfa Aesar) apart from HCQ and CoCl 2 , which were prepared fresh in DMEM (Corning Life Sciences) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Life Technologies). Cell culture U87-MG, U251-MG, and sNF96.2 cells were purchased from ATCC. ipnNF95.11C and ipNF95.11b \u2018C\u2019 cells were kindly provided by Peggy Wallace, University of Florida, USA and are available for purchase through the ATCC. Immortalized mammary epithelial cells (IMECs) were a gift from James DiRenzo, Euroleader, Houston, TX, USA. U87-MG, U251-MG, ipnNF95.11C and ipNF95.11b \u2018C\u2019 cell lines were cultured in DMEM with L-glutamine, 4.5\u2005g/l glucose and sodium pyruvate (Corning Life Sciences) with the addition of 10% (v/v) FBS (Atlanta Biologicals, Life Technologies or Gibco, Thermo Fischer Scientific). sNF96.2 cells were cultured in DMEM with 4\u2005mM L-glutamine, 4.5\u2005g/l glucose, 1\u2005mM sodium pyruvate and 1.5\u2005g/l sodium bicarbonate (ATCC) with the addition of 10% (v/v) FBS. IMECs were cultured in DMEM/F12 (1:1) supplemented with 5% FBS, 2\u2005mM glutamine (Gibco), 5\u2005\u03bcg/ml insulin (Akron Biotech), 500\u2005\u03bcg/ml hydrocortisone (MP Biomedical) and 10\u2005ng/ml recombinant human epidermal growth factor (Promega). All cell lines were grown at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO 2 , passaged regularly using PBS and 0.25% trypsin (Corning), and routinely screened for mycoplasma contamination using the MycoProbe kit (R&D Systems). Although the currently available U87-MG cell line from ATCC differs from those derived from the original tumor, it is considered to be a human glioblastoma cell line of unknown origin ( Allen et al., 2016 ). In the context of this work, U87-MG cells serve as an NF1-deficient tumor cell line model, due to elevated proteasome-mediated degradation of the NF1 protein ( McGillicuddy et al., 2009 ). U87-MG cells have been used a model of an NF1-deficient tumor cell line in multiple studies ( Allaway et al., 2016 ,  2017 ;  Daginakatte and Gutmann, 2007 ;  McGillicuddy et al., 2009 ;  See et al., 2012 ). Yeast dose\u2013response curves S. cerevisiae  strains were plated at an optical density at 600 nm (OD 600 ) of 0.05 in 96-well plates (Falcon) and grown in Synthetic Complete medium (recipe according to Cold Spring Harbor Protocols  https://cshprotocols.cshlp.org/content/2016/11/pdb.rec090589.full?sid=65431fb9-2fc5-4685-bbe6-85343665fa93 ) containing compound starting at 100\u2005\u00b5M, followed by 2-fold serial dilutions to generate a 10-point range of concentrations in quadruplicate; one column was treated with equivalent amounts of DMSO (\u22641%) as a control. Yeast were incubated for 18\u2005h, after which the optical density was read using a Spectramax M2 (Molecular Devices) at a wavelength of 600\u2005nm and normalized to DMSO. Hoechst cell viability assays Cells were plated at 2500 cells/well in 96-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. In the case of ipnNF95.11C and ipNF95.11b \u2018C\u2019, cells were plated at 5000 cells/well in 96-well plates. Medium was removed and replaced with medium containing compound starting at 20\u2005\u00b5M or 100\u2005\u00b5M, followed by 2-fold serial dilutions to generate a 10-point range of concentrations in quadruplicate; one column was treated with equivalent amounts of DMSO (\u22641%) as a control. Cells were incubated for the indicated timepoints. Upon collection, medium was removed, cells were rinsed with PBS, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until all plates were collected. To process cells, plates were thawed with PBS, incubated with 1\u00d7 saline-sodium citrate (SSC) buffer with 0.02% SDS for 1\u2005h at 37\u00b0C, followed by staining with 1\u2005\u00b5g/ml Hoechst 33258 (Pierce). Absorbance was read using a Spectramax M2 at an excitation of 355\u2005nm and an emission of 460\u2005nm, and absorbance was normalized to DMSO. Cell viability assays using alamarBlue Cells were plated at 5000 cells/well in 96-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. Medium was removed and replaced with medium containing compound starting at 20\u2005\u00b5M or 100\u2005\u00b5M, followed by 2-fold serial dilutions to generate a 10-point range of concentrations in quadruplicate; one column was treated with equivalent amounts of DMSO (\u22641%) as a control. Cells were incubated for 72\u2005h. At 3\u2005h prior to the end of incubation, alamarBlue (Invitrogen) was added to a final concentration of 5% v/v. Fluorescence was read using a Spectramax M2 at an excitation of 544\u2005nm and an emission of 590\u2005nm, and fluorescence was normalized to DMSO. Generation of NF1-deficient IMEC lines using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing A single guide RNA (sgRNA) was utilized to disrupt  NF1  in exon 2: 5\u2032-GTTGTGCTCAGTACTGACTT-3\u2032 ( Shalem et al., 2014 ). IMECs were plated at 900,000 cells per 10\u2005cm plate and were allowed to adhere overnight. The next day, cells were transfected with lentiCRISPRv2 (# 52961  Addgene) and gRNA at a 3:1 ratio using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Clones were selected following 3 days of puromycin selection and confirmed to have loss of NF1 protein by western blotting. Immunofluorescence staining U87-MG cells were plated at a concentration of 50,000 cells/well onto pre-coated poly-D-lysine (PDL) coverslips (Neuvitro) in 24-well plates (Falcon) and allowed to adhere overnight. Medium was removed and replaced with treatment-laced medium normalized to DMSO, and cells were treated for the indicated timepoints. At the time of collection, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde without methanol (EMS); in the case of anti-\u03b3-H2AX, cells were fixed with 100% methanol (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Coverslips were washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Following permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific), coverslips were blocked for 1\u2005h at room temperature (RT) in IF buffer (PBS containing 0.05% azide, 0.2% Triton X-100 and 2% normal goat serum or, for 8-OHG, normal donkey serum). For anti-LAMP1 staining, an additional permeabilization step in 100% methanol was included prior to permeabilizing with Triton X-100. The following primary antibodies were used for 1\u2005h at RT unless specified: Alexa Fluor 488 pre-conjugated anti-\u03b3-H2AX (N1-431) mouse monoclonal (1:50 for 30\u2005min; cat. no 560445, BD Biosciences), anti-cleaved caspase 3 (Asp175) rabbit polyclonal (1:200; cat. no 9661, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-SQSTM1/p62 (D-3) mouse monoclonal (1:500; cat. no sc-28359, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-8-hydroxyguanosine goat polyclonal (1:200; cat. no DR1001, Millipore), anti-BNIP3L/Nix (D4R4B) rabbit monoclonal (1:200, overnight at 4\u00b0C; cat. no 12396, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-Tom20 (FL-145) rabbit polyclonal (1:200; cat. no sc-11415, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-LAMP1 (D4O1S) mouse monoclonal (1:100, overnight at 4\u00b0C; cat. no 15665, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-FLAG (M2) mouse monoclonal (1:500 for 2\u2005h at 37\u00b0C; cat. no F1804, Sigma-Aldrich). Following washes with PBST, cells were stained with goat anti-rabbit-IgG or goat anti-mouse-IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 594 (or, for 8-OHG, donkey anti-goat-IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488) secondary antibody at 1:800 for 1\u2005h at RT (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Coverslips were washed with PBST following secondary staining, cells were stained with 0.33\u2005\u03bcg/ml DAPI in PBS and mounted onto slides in ProLong Gold (Life Technologies). For MitoTracker Red CMXRos staining, 30\u2005min prior to collection, medium was removed and replaced with medium containing MitoTracker Red CMXRos at a final concentration of 100\u2005nM (Molecular Probes). Following staining, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde without methanol. Cells were washed with PBST, then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. When co-staining with an additional marker, the staining procedure continued with the blocking step; otherwise, cells were stained with 0.33\u2005\u03bcg/ml DAPI in PBS and mounted onto slides in ProLong Gold (Life Technologies). To visualize the localization of az-Y102 using immunofluorescence, cells were treated for 2\u2005h with az-Y102, DMSO or parent compound Y102, medium was removed and replaced with normal medium, and cells were incubated for a total of 24\u2005h. Following treatment, cells were washed, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde without methanol (EMS), and permeabilized using 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. Samples were stained with alkyne-488 at a final concentration of 1\u2005\u00b5M following the Click-iT cell reaction buffer kit (Invitrogen) protocol. Following washes with 2% BSA, the staining procedure continued with the blocking step as described above. All confocal images were acquired on a Nikon A1RSi confocal microscope equipped with a 60\u00d71.4 NA oil objective, a DU4 detector unit and Nikon Elements software. Otherwise, images were acquired on a Zeiss Axio Imager.Z1 equipped with a Zeiss EC Plan-NEOFLUAR 40\u00d71.3 NA oil objective, a Zeiss AxioCam MRm camera, a Lumen Dynamics Series 120 Q X-Cite Fluorescence Illuminator, and AxioVision SE64 Rel. 4.9.1 software. Image processing was performed with Fiji, built on ImageJ2. MV-151 proteasome active site inhibition assay U87-MG cells were plated at 500,000 cells/well in six-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight (Falcon). Medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium containing 2\u2005\u00b5M, 4\u2005\u00b5M or 10\u2005\u00b5M Y102 or equivalent amounts of vehicle DMSO (\u22641%) and treated for 24\u2005h. As a positive control, one well was treated for 2\u2005h with 1\u2005\u00b5M Bz and 10\u2005\u00b5M MG-132. Cells were collected after treatment by washing with PBS, harvested with trypsin plus agitation to detach cells, spun down in a centrifuge (400\u2005  for 5\u2005min), and resuspended in PBS to wash. Cells were transferred to 1.5\u2005ml microcentrifuge tubes, pelleted (600\u2005 g  for 5\u2005min) and resuspended in 20\u2005\u00b5l digitonin lysis buffer (50\u2005mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 250\u2005mM sucrose, 2\u2005mM EDTA, 1\u2005mM ATP, 1\u2005mM DTT and 0.05% digitonin). Cells were mixed by pipetting, incubated on ice for 20\u2005min, and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation (\u226518,000\u2005 g  for 20\u2005min). Protein concentrations were determined using a Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). 10\u2005\u00b5g of protein lysate was incubated for 20\u2005min with 20\u2005\u00b5M MV-151 in a 37\u00b0C water bath. 4\u00d7 loading dye was added to the samples and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 4\u201315% polyacrylamide gradient gel (Bio-Rad). Gels were imaged on a Typhoon scanner at an excitation of 532\u2005nm and an emission of 560\u2005nm to detect MV-151 fluorescence. Following imaging, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose. The blot was probed for \u03b1-tubulin as a loading control. Experiments were repeated twice, and a representative image is shown. g Western blotting U87-MG cells were plated at 500,000 cells/well in six-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight (Falcon). Medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium containing drugs or compounds for the indicated timepoints. Cells were collected after treatment by washing with PBS, harvested with trypsin plus agitation to detach cells, pelleted in a centrifuge (400\u2005  for 5\u2005min) and resuspended in PBS to wash. Cells were transferred to 1.5\u2005ml microcentrifuge tubes, pelleted (600\u2005 g  for 5\u2005min), and resuspended in RIPA lysis buffer (50\u2005mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150\u2005mM NaCl, 1% nonidet P40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.05% SDS) containing 1\u2005mM NaVO g 4 , 1\u2005mM NaF, 1\u2005mM PMSF, 0.1\u2005\u03bcg/ml antipain, 1\u2005\u03bcM aprotinin, 100\u2005\u03bcM benzamidine HCl, 0.1\u2005\u03bcg/ml leupeptin, 0.1\u2005\u03bcg/ml pepstatin and 0.1\u2005\u03bcg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. Lysates were sonicated (2 \u00d7 5 s), incubated on ice for 15\u2005min, and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation (\u226518,000\u2005  for 20\u2005min). Protein levels were quantified using a BCA assay kit (Pierce). 50\u2005\u00b5g of protein was prepared in 1\u00d7 Laemmli sample buffer [50\u2005mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 0.02% (w/v) Bromophenol Blue, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) \u03b2-mercaptoethanol and 12.5\u2005mM EDTA] and separated by SDS-PAGE on a 4\u201315% polyacrylamide gradient gel (Bio-Rad). Western blots for NF1 and phospho(p)-ERK were performed as above except lysates were run using a 3\u20138% NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen). Protein was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST and probed with anti-NF1 (D7R7D) rabbit monoclonal (cat. no 14623, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000, overnight at 4\u00b0C), anti-PARP (46D11) rabbit monoclonal (cat. no 9532, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:5000, overnight at 4\u00b0C), anti-BNIP3L/Nix (D4R4B) rabbit monoclonal (cat. no 12396, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000, overnight at 4\u00b0C), anti-p62/SQSTM-1 (D-3) mouse monoclonal (cat. no sc-28359, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1000, 1\u2005h at RT), anti-LC3BI/II rabbit polyclonal (cat. no #2775, Cell Signaling, 1:1000, overnight at 4\u00b0C), anti-C17orf59/BORCS6 rabbit polyclonal (cat. no  g PA566346 , Invitrogen, 1:1000, overnight at 4\u00b0C), anti-GAPDH (14C10) rabbit monoclonal (cat. no 2118, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:2500, 1\u2005h at RT), or anti-\u03b1-tubulin (B-1-2-5) mouse monoclonal (cat. no sc-23948, Santa Cruz Biotehcnology, 1:10,000, 1\u2005h at RT) primary antibody in 2% milk in TBST. Secondary labeling was performed with a 1-h incubation in 1:10,000 anti-rabbit-IgG conjugated to HRP or anti-mouse-IgG conjugated to HRP (Jackson Immunoresearch) antibody diluted in 2% milk in TBST. The film was exposed to ECL-coated blots (Pierce) and developed using a standard film processor. Blot transparency images can be viewed in  Fig.\u00a0S4 . Flow cytometry U87-MG cells were plated at 500,000 cells/well in a six-well plate and allowed to adhere overnight. The medium was replaced with cell culture medium containing equivalent amounts of DMSO (\u22641%), 2\u2005\u00b5M Y102, 100\u2005nM doxorubicin or 100\u2005\u00b5M CoCl 2  for 24\u2005h. At the end of the incubation, cells were rinsed twice with PBS, trypsinized, and rinsed again with PBS prior to fixation with BD cytofix/cytoperm for 30\u2005min on ice. After washing with BD perm/wash twice, cells were stained with DAPI at a final concentration 0.33\u2005\u00b5g/ml in PBS for 30\u2005min on ice. Cells were washed twice more with BD perm/wash and resuspended in PBS for analysis. The cells were transferred to flow cytometry tubes (14-961-10, Fisherbrand) and analyzed using a MacsQuant VYB 8-color flow cytometer. DNA content was detected using the V1 channel. This experiment was repeated twice, and the percentage of cells in each cell cycle stage is shown. 50,000 events per sample were collected and cellular debris was gated out of the dataset. RT-qPCR to measure  BNIP3L  transcript levels U87-MG cells were plated into six-well plates at 250,000 cells/well and allowed to adhere overnight. The next day, cells were treated for 6\u2005h with Y102 or vehicle control; RNA was collected at the endpoint using the RNAeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). A total of 1.5\u2005\u00b5l of RNA was converted into cDNA using first-strand cDNA synthesis kit SuperScript II RT (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was prepared with SYBR Green qPCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) and qPCR was performed using primers against  BNIP3L  or the internal control 18S on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) in triplicate. \u0394\u0394 Ct  was used to calculate relative gene expression. The following qPCR primer sequences were used:  BNIP3L  forward, 5\u2032-AATGTCGTCCCACCTAGTCG-3\u2032;  BNIP3L  reverse 5\u2032-TAGCTCCACCCAGGAACTGT-3\u2032; 18S rRNA forward, 5\u2032-ATACAGCCAGGTCCTAGCCA-3\u2032; 18S rRNA reverse, 5\u2032-AAGTGACGCAGCCCTCTATG-3\u2032. Cellular thermal shift assay and TMT 10-plex labeling U87-MG cells were plated into two 10\u2005cm tissue culture dishes at a concentration that would result in a yield of \u223c1.5\u2005mg total protein per plate on the day of collection. Cells were treated with 2\u2005\u00b5M Y102, 2\u2005\u00b5M JW-1 or the equivalent amount of DMSO (\u22641%) for 2\u2005h. The medium was removed and collected in a conical tube; cells were rinsed with PBS and trypsinized. Cells were re-suspended in 1\u2005ml PBS with protease inhibitors (Roche), equating to a protein concentration of \u223c1\u2005mg/ml. 100\u2005\u00b5l of resuspended cells were transferred to PCR tubes and incubated for 3\u2005min in thermal cyclers preheated to the following temperatures: 37, 37, 44.7, 48.4, 52.3, 55, 58, 60.2, 63.3, 66.3 and 70 (\u00b0C). Cells were lysed by freeze-thaw and centrifuged at 21,100   for 20\u2005min at 4\u00b0C. Supernatants were removed to a fresh 0.5\u2005ml Eppendorf tube. g Supernatant from the duplicate 37\u00b0C treatment condition was used to determine protein concentration through a BCA assay. This allowed for the quantitative transfer of 50\u2005\u00b5g of protein in each of the remaining tubes to a fresh 1.5\u2005ml Eppendorf tube. Proteins were denatured with 7\u2005M urea, reduced with DTT and alkylated with iodoacetamide. Urea was diluted to a concentration of <1\u2005M with Tris-HCl pH 8.1 and proteins were digested with proteomics grade trypsin. Peptides were acidified and desalted via solid-phase extraction and evaporated by vacuum centrifugation. Each temperature treatment was differentially labeled using TMT-10-plex reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). TMT LC-MS/MS analyses The Orbitrap Fusion was operated with an Orbitrap MS1 scan at 120K resolution and an AGC target value of 500K. The maximum injection time was 100\u2005ms, the  m / z  range was 350 to 1300 and the dynamic exclusion window was 30\u2005s. Precursor ions were selected for MS2 using quadrupole isolation (0.6  m / z  isolation width) in a \u2018top speed\u2019 (3\u2005s duty cycle), data-dependent manner. Ion charge states of +2 through +5 were selected for MS2 by collision induced dissociation (CID) fragmentation (32% CID energy) and ion trap analysis. The MS2 scan maximum injection time was 60\u2005ms and AGC target value was 8K. MS2 fragment ions were selected for synchronous precursor selection (SPS)-MS3 analysis in a top 10 data-dependent manner. MS3 scans were generated through higher energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD) fragmentation (55% HCD energy) and Orbitrap analysis at 60K resolution, with a scan range of 110 to 750  m / z . The MS3 scan maximum injection time was 200\u2005ms and AGC target value was 50K. Click chemistry sample TCA precipitation and LC-MS/MS analyses 4\u00d710 7  cells were plated into a total of 3\u201315\u2005cm dishes per treatment condition and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were treated for 2\u2005h with the equivalent amount of DMSO (\u22641%), 2\u2005\u00b5M Y102 or 2\u2005\u00b5M azide-tagged Y102. Following treatment, cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized and resuspended in 850\u2005\u00b5l urea lysis buffer (8\u2005M urea, 200\u2005mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 4% CHAPS, 1\u2005M NaCl) from the Click-iT Protein Enrichment Kit (Molecular Probes). Samples were incubated on ice for 10\u2005min prior to sonication six times for 3\u2005s each. Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000\u2005  for 10\u2005min, then 800\u2005\u00b5l of the lysate was added to 200\u2005\u00b5l of alkyne-bound resin slurry and 1 ml of catalyst solution containing copper (II) sulfate at a final concentration of 1\u2005mM. Slurries were rotated end-over-end at RT for 18\u2005h. Following this, samples were reduced using 1\u2005M DTT and 7.4\u2005mg/ml of iodoacetamide, stringently washed using SDS wash buffer, 8\u2005M urea, and 20% acetonitrile, precipitated in 20% TCA, and washed in 10% TCA and cold acetone. Precipitated proteins were digested with trypsin and peptides identified by LC-MS/MS on an Orbitrap Fusion as described below. g LC-MS/MS analyses of TCA precipitated material LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with an EASY-nLC 1000 ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatograph (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were dissolved in loading buffer [5% methanol (Fisher)/1.5% formic acid] and injected directly onto an in-house pulled polymer-coated fritless fused silica analytical resolving column (40\u2005cm length, 100\u2005\u00b5m inner diameter; PolyMicro) packed with ReproSil, C18 AQ 1.9\u2005\u00b5m 120\u2005\u00c5 pore (Dr. Maisch). Samples were separated with a 90-min gradient of 4 to 33% LC-MS buffer B (LC-MS buffer A: 0.125% formic acid, 3% ACN; LC-MS buffer B: 0.125% formic acid, 95% ACN) at a flow rate of 330\u2005nl/min. The Orbitrap Fusion was operated with an Orbitrap MS1 scan at 120K resolution and an AGC target value of 500K. The maximum injection time was 100\u2005ms, the scan range was 350 to 1500  m / z  and the dynamic exclusion window was 15\u2005s (\u00b115\u2005ppm from precursor ion  m / z ). Precursor ions were selected for MS2 using quadrupole isolation (0.7  m / z  isolation width) in a \u2018top speed\u2019 (2\u2005s duty cycle), data-dependent manner. MS2 scans were generated through HCD fragmentation (29% HCD energy) and Orbitrap analysis at 15 K resolution. Ion charge states of +2 through +4 were selected for HCD MS2. The MS2 scan maximum injection time was 60 ms and the AGC target value was 60 K. Peptide spectral matching and bioinformatics Raw data were searched using COMET against a target-decoy version of the human ( Homo sapiens ) proteome sequence database (UniProt; downloaded 2013; 20,241 total proteins) with a precursor mass tolerance of \u00b11.00\u2005Da and requiring fully tryptic peptides with up to three missed cleavages, carbamidomethyl cysteine as a fixed modification and oxidized methionine as a variable modification ( Eng et al., 2013 ). For TMT experiments, the TMT reagent mass was searched as a static modification on lysine residues and peptide N-termini. The resulting peptide spectral matches were filtered to <1% false discovery rate (FDR) by defining thresholds of decoy hit frequencies at particular mass measurement accuracy (measured in parts-per-million from theoretical), XCorr and delta-XCorr (dCn) values. TPP-TR analyses were performed using the R statistical programming language ( http://www.R-project.org ) ( Franken et al., 2015 ). siRNA knockdown To knockdown BORCS6, cells were plated at 200,000 cells/well in six-well plates, 50,000 cells/well on precoated PDL coverslips in 24-well plates, or 5000 cells/well in 96-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. The next day, cells were transfected with negative control siRNA (Ambicon; #AM4611) or siRNA targeting BORCS6 (Invitrogen; HSS123247) at a final concentration of 2\u2005pmol/\u00b5l and lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM medium (Gibco), and the mixture was incubated for 20\u2005min at room temperature prior to drop-wise addition to cells. At 24\u2005h after transfection, reagents were added to the culture, and medium was removed and replaced with normal growth medium. Cells were incubated for a total of 72\u2005h before collection. \u03b2-galactosidase senescence assay U87-MG cells were plated at 100,000 cells/well and allowed to adhere overnight. Medium was removed and replaced with medium containing equivalent amount of DMSO (\u22641%), 2\u2005\u00b5M Y102 or 100\u2005nM doxorubicin for a total of 72\u2005h. Cells were collected and stained for \u03b2-galactosidase using the Senescence \u03b2-Galactosidase Staining Kit (Cell Signaling). 100 cells were counted per condition; the graph represents results from triplicate experiments. Stable transfection of BORCS6 in U87-MG cells To establish U87-MG cells overexpressing BORCS6, cells were plated at 100,000 cells/well in a 12-well plate and allowed to adhere overnight. The next day, cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector or pBORCS6 (GenScript) at a final concentration of 8\u2005ng/\u00b5l and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM medium (Gibco), and the mixture was incubated for 20\u2005min at RT prior to drop-wise addition to cells. At 24\u2005h after transfection, reagents were added to the culture, and medium was removed and replaced with normal growth medium containing 1000\u2005\u00b5M G418 (Gibco). After several days, pBORCS6 underwent clonal selection; expression of BORCS6 was confirmed by immunofluorescence.",

  "introduction": "INTRODUCTION RASopathies are a group of rare genetic conditions defined by germline alterations in the RAS-MAPK pathway that often result in constitutive activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), RAF and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways located downstream of RAS ( Ratner and Miller, 2015 ). Together, these pathways drive translation, cell proliferation, cell motility and cell invasion. One of the most common RASopathies with an incidence rate of \u223c1:3500 is neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) ( Walker and Upadhyaya, 2018 ). NF1 is an autosomal dominant tumor-predisposing syndrome categorized by the loss of neurofibromin (NF1) protein expression due to genetic mutation or other alterations in the  NF1  gene. NF1 is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that negatively regulates the activity of RAS by stimulating its intrinsic GTPase activity. Loss of NF1 thereby results in RAS hyperactivation and aberrant activation of downstream pathways ( Simanshu et al., 2017 ). Elevated RAS signaling leads to the formation of non-malignant tumors including cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs) and plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) in NF1. cNFs are considered the largest tumor-related burden in NF1 individuals, with no effective therapy options ( Allaway et al., 2018 ). PNs occur along peripheral nerves and can predispose individuals with NF1 to the development of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) and at an earlier age than the general population ( Avery et al., 2017 ;  Korf, 2000 ;  Yao et al., 2023 ). MPNSTs are highly aggressive radiation- and chemotherapy-resistant tumors with a 5-year survival rate of 15\u201350% ( Farid et al., 2014 ). Individuals with NF1 can also develop neoplasias including optic nerve gliomas, pilocytic astrocytomas, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumors and both low- and high-grade gliomas ( Ly and Blakeley, 2019 ). Loss of  NF1  also occurs in 5% of all sporadic tumors, including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), breast cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, both melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers, and lung cancer ( Philpott et al., 2017 ). Using genetically engineered mouse models,  NF1  loss has been shown to be a driver of GBM ( Alcantara Llaguno et al., 2015 ;  McGillicuddy et al., 2009 ). In tumors with sporadic  NF1  loss, progression-free survival is significantly lower in  NF1 -deficient individuals compared to other groups for non-small cell lung cancer and acute myeloid leukemia, making  NF1  loss a poor prognostic factor ( Giraud et al., 2023 ). Based on this information, there is a significant need to identify novel therapeutic targets in  NF1 -deficient tumors associated with the condition NF1 as well as tumors with sporadic  NF1  loss. Over the past two decades, significant steps have been taken to address the lack of therapeutic options for those with  NF1 -deficient tumors, with a focus on targeting RAS effector proteins ( See et al., 2012 ). Clinical trials have focused on repurposing cancer drugs have been carried out in patients with PNs using RAF, mTOR and MEK inhibitors ( Walker and Upadhyaya, 2018 ). Although these inhibitors have had varying degrees of success, there are limitations associated with each. RAF inhibitors such as dabrafinib have been shown to be effective in  BRAF -mutant melanomas; however, in  BRAF -mutant melanomas with concurrent  NF1  mutations, RAF inhibitors are less effective due to remaining hyperactive RAS signaling ( Maertens et al., 2013 ). mTOR inhibitors are also effective in tumor types associated with RAS dysregulation; however, feedback signaling mediated by S6 kinase can increase AKT signaling, bypassing the inhibitory effects of the mTOR inhibitor ( Sabatini, 2006 ). The combination of mTOR and PI3K inhibition is able to prevent this negative feedback loop but remains ineffective at inhibiting the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway ( See et al., 2012 ). Work with MEK1/2 inhibitors such as selumetinib is encouraging and effective in the majority of NF1 participants with PNs or low-grade gliomas, and the drug was recently granted FDA approval for the treatment of NF1 PN ( Dombi et al., 2016 ;  Gross et al., 2018 ,  2020 ). Although this discovery has made a significant impact on the clinical maintenance of NF1, there are several compounding factors associated with MEK inhibition. First, selumetinib has only been successful in NF1 pediatric patients with PNs; treatment does not alleviate other tumor burdens, such as cNFs, nor is selumetinib approved at this time for adult NF1 patients ( Solares et al., 2021 ). Additionally, NF1 patients with long-term exposure to MEK inhibition develop side effects including peripheral edema, hair color change, nausea, headaches, a variety of skin conditions, blurred vision and cardiac abnormalities ( Baldo et al., 2021 ;  Gross et al., 2023 ;  Klesse et al., 2020 ). Therefore, there still exists a need for additional therapeutic targets for  NF1 -deficient tumors. To identify novel pathways to target  NF1 -deficient tumors, we developed an unbiased high-throughput synthetic lethal screening approach utilizing a library of tool compounds and a budding yeast model system of  NF1  deficiency. We discovered several promising compounds through this screen and previously reported the target or the mechanism of action of two of these ( Allaway et al., 2017 ;  Wood et al., 2011 ). Here, we describe the mechanism of action of a third compound, Y102, and identify inhibition of lysosomal trafficking as a potential vulnerability of both sporadic and neurofibromatosis type I-associated  NF1 -deficient tumors.",
  "results": "Y102 results in increased expression of autophagy and oxidative stress markers To identify the mechanism of action of Y102-mediated cell death, we examined expression of proteins associated with DNA damage, apoptosis, proteasome inhibition and autophagy (also referred to as macroautophagy) pathways ( Lavrik et al., 2005 ;  Liu et al., 2016 ;  Sharma et al., 2012 ). First, we examined the expression of the DNA damage marker \u03b3-H2AX, a histone H2A variant that is phosphorylated following the generation of double- and single-stranded DNA breaks ( Sharma et al., 2012 ). There was no significant change in \u03b3-H2AX expression following Y102 treatment ( Fig.\u00a0S2A ), suggesting that Y102 does not mediate cell death through a DNA damage response pathway. We next examined apoptotic cell death following Y102 treatment by monitoring the cleavage of caspase-3 ( Lavrik et al., 2005 ). We did not observe a difference in the amount of cleaved caspase-3 between Y102 treatment and vehicle control ( Fig.\u00a0S2B ). This result suggests that Y102 does not mediate cell death through caspase-3-mediated apoptosis, and was confirmed by western blotting for PARP (also known as PARP1), an enzyme that is cleaved by caspase-3 under apoptotic conditions ( Fig.\u00a0S2C ) ( Chaitanya et al., 2010 ). The ubiquitylation of proteins can mark them for degradation mediated by the proteasome, the unfolded protein response or autophagy, triggering cell death. To determine whether Y102 acts as a direct inhibitor of the proteasomal active sites, we utilized the activity-based broad-range fluorescent inhibitor MV-151, which can bind to and inhibit all three subunits of the proteasome ( Verdoes et al., 2006 ). We performed a competitive binding assay in which cells were treated with DMSO, Y102 or a combination of proteasome inhibitors to serve as a positive control, and the lysates were incubated with MV-151, which can only bind in the absence of proteosome inhibitors. Inhibition of proteasomal subunits was only observed following treatment with the positive controls and not with Y102, as indicated by the presence of MV-151 in the Y102-treated sample, eliminating proteasome inhibition as a mechanism of action of Y102-mediated cell death ( Fig.\u00a0S2D ). Finally, we examined the impact of Y102 on autophagic processes by surveying expression of the adaptor protein sequestosome-1 (p62; also known as SQSTM1), a shared marker of autophagy and oxidative stress perturbations ( Liu et al., 2016 ;  Song et al., 2017 ). p62 recognizes and binds to ubiquitin on cargo marked for degradation either by autophagy or the proteasome; furthermore, phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB following oxidative stress induction results in the upregulation of p62 protein ( Nedelsky et al., 2008 ;  Song et al., 2017 ). Y102 increased expression of p62 compared to DMSO ( Fig.\u00a02A,B ). We also noted that p62 expression with Y102 treatment was similar to that previously observed using the late-stage autophagy inhibitor hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) ( Mauthe et al., 2018 ). We also examined the effect of Y102 on the lipidation state of microtubule\u2013associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) family proteins, another autophagy marker ( Tanida et al., 2008 ). Cytosolic (non-lipidated) LC3-I is converted into LC3-II via phosphatidylethanolamine addition, and LC3-II is recruited to autophagosome membranes ( Shibutani and Yoshimori, 2014 ). When autophagy is inhibited at a stage following the lipidation of LC3-I with compounds like HCQ, accumulation of LC3-II is detectable; however, when autophagy is stimulated and unhindered, LC3-II is degraded within the autolysosome and only LC3-I is detectable ( Mizushima and Yoshimori, 2007 ). Based on this knowledge, we hypothesized that LC3-II would accumulate after Y102 treatment if it inhibits macroautophagy. To test this, we treated U87-MG cells with Y102 for 12\u2005h, followed by HCQ co-treatment for an additional 12\u2005h, for a total of 24-h treatment ( Fig.\u00a02C ). We found that, although p62 expression increased with Y102 or HCQ treatment, Y102 treatment alone did not result in LC3-II accumulation. All treatments with HCQ present resulted in LC3-II accumulation, suggesting that, although HCQ and Y102 both increase expression of p62, the mechanisms of action of Y102 and HCQ differ, and Y102 is unlikely to be a macroautophagy inhibitor. Fig. 2. Y102 treatment results in increased expression of autophagy and oxidative stress markers and alters the mitochondrial network.  (A) U87-MG cells were treated with DMSO, 2\u2005\u03bcM Y102 or 50\u2005\u03bcM HCQ, an autophagy inhibitor for 24\u2005h. Cells were stained for the autophagy marker p62 (red).

At 30\u2005min prior to collection, cells were stained with MitoTracker Red CMXROS (red). Cells were stained for oxidative stress marker 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OHG) (green).

Results in B,E,G are the mean\u00b1s.d. Previous studies have shown that tumors with dysregulated RAS, which include  NF1 -deficient tumors, depend on autophagy to modulate accumulation of oxidative stress-induced damaged mitochondria, and defective autophagic clearance results in the accumulation of abnormal mitochondria ( Guo et al., 2011 ). It has also been previously demonstrated that loss of neurofibromin results in a decrease in expression and activity of key components of oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore,  NF1 -deficient cells have been reported to have a significant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) ( Bessler et al., 2016 ;  Masgras et al., 2022 ), suggesting that  NF1 -deficient cells will require greater mitochondrial turnover than their wild-type counterparts. To investigate whether Y102 resulted in an abnormal mitochondrial phenotype, we used the membrane potential-based fluorescent probe MitoTracker Red CMXRos. Whereas cells treated with DMSO had a highly structured network of mitochondria, Y102-treated cells exhibited perinuclear clustering of the mitochondria, something not observed with HCQ ( Fig.\u00a02D,E ). To investigate whether Y102 resulted in an increase in oxidative damage in  NF1 -deficient cells, we probed for 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OHG), an oxidative stress-induced DNA damage marker for both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA ( Song et al., 2017 ;  Valavanidis et al., 2009 ). Y102 resulted in an increase in 8-OHG compared to DMSO, suggesting an increase in oxidative stress and subsequent damage following Y102 treatment ( Fig.\u00a02F,G ). Localization of 8-OHG indicated that the oxidative stress-induced damage affected both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, as 8-OHG expression colocalized in both the mitochondria in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Together, these findings suggest a potential mechanism of action of Y102, whereby it results in a defect to clear mitochondria by an autophagic process.",
  "discussion": "DISCUSSION Mechanism for Y102-mediated cell death The work presented here demonstrates that Y102 alters lysosome positioning and impacts mitochondrial clearance in  NF1 -deficient cancer cells and is synthetic lethal with  NF1  loss in an isogenic yeast model. Additionally, the selectivity of Y102 for  NF1 -deficient yeast cells is recapitulated in an isogenic pair of  NF1 -deficient cell lines, as well as matched tumor and normal Schwann cell lines from an individual with NF1, demonstrating preferential sensitivity in cells that lack both copies of the  NF1  gene compared to wild-type or  NF1  heterozygous cells. This supports our hypothesis that the compound Y102 is selective in targeting  NF1 -deficient cells. We also found that sensitivity to Y102 has irreversible effects on  NF1- deficient cell viability in as little as 2 h, demonstrating that the potential therapeutic effects of Y102 do not require continual drug presence. Furthermore, proteomics approaches and immunofluorescence imaging support that BORC is a target of Y102. Our working model is that Y102 prevents lysosome-directed mitochondrial clearance by preventing the normal function of BORC. This results in the perinuclear clustering of the lysosomes, as was observed with both Y102 treatment and knockdown of one subunit of BORC. RAS dysregulated cancer cells rely on a high turnover of mitochondria due to their susceptibility to oxidative stress-induced damage; likewise,  NF1- deficient tumor cells with RAS dysregulation might also require rapid mitochondrial turnover. Although autophagy is utilized as a survival mechanism for some tumors confronted with nutrient starvation and increased hypoxia, it might also play a tumor suppressor role by eliminating accumulation of p62 ( Mathew et al., 2009 ). In the case of  NF1- deficient cells, an increase in autophagic proteins, including p62, has previously been observed ( Li et al., 2021 ). Conversely, a decrease in p62 expression is seen when NF1 is overexpressed, suggesting that  NF1- deficient cells are more susceptible to autophagic modulation ( Li et al., 2021 ). Indeed, in an  NF1 -deficient  Drosophila  cell line model, autophagic flux is increased compared to that in an isogenic control line; additionally, these cells are preferentially sensitive to the known late-stage autophagy inhibitors chloroquine and bafilomycin A1 ( Stevens et al., 2024 ). Studies conducted in  NF1 -deficient murine cells show, in comparison to wild-type controls, downregulated respiratory complex I protein levels and enzymatic activity, leading to decreased respiration, a reduction in NAD +  and an increase in ROS ( Masgras et al., 2022 ). Our study is consistent with these findings, as we observe an increase in oxidative stress specific to mitochondria in the presence of Y102. We also observed an inhibition of mitochondrial clearance with Y102 treatment, which leads to an accumulation of mitophagy-specific receptors and ROS-damaged mitochondria. Together, these findings suggest that inhibition of mitochondrial clearance via autophagy or prevention of lysosome distribution might be therapeutic strategies worth investigating further in the context of  NF1 -deficient tumors. Alterations of p21 expression with Y102 treatment and BORC knockdown We identified two potential targets of Y102 using our dual proteomics approach: p21 and BORC. An increase in p21 expression was observed with both Y102 treatment and direct knockdown of a BORC subunit; however, there was no effect on cell cycle progression which is mediated by p21 expression. Furthermore, there was no indication of Y102-induced senescence despite this observed p21 increase. This raises the question as to why we detected elevated levels of p21 in both Y102-treated cells and cells transfected with siRNA against BORCS6. Increase in p21 expression both at the RNA and protein level following treatment with autophagic-lysosomal inhibitors has been reported ( Qiao et al., 2013 ). Therefore, the observed p21 increase following Y102 treatment and BORCS6 knockdown might be due to inhibition of autophagic lysosome inhibition. The elevated p21 levels could explain the identification of p21 in both of our proteomic approaches. Alternatively, upregulation of p21 expression is reported to induce autophagy and to drive the onset of mitophagy, as well as mitochondrial dysfunction, in  NF1 -deficienct breast cancer cells ( Capparelli et al., 2012 ). This suggests that increased p21 expression might prime  NF1 -deficient cells to be more susceptible to autophagy inhibition and, consequentially, Y102 inhibition. BORC as a potential vulnerability in NF1-deficient tumors In addition to identifying a mechanism of action of Y102, this study is one of the first to suggest BORC as a potential therapeutic target in the context of cancer and tumorigenesis, and, to our knowledge, the first study to describe a small molecule capable of inhibiting BORC. BORC is responsible for lysosomal positioning in the cell, and knockdown of various subunits of BORC have led to perinuclear clustering of lysosomes, alterations in autophagic processes, and altered cell migration ( Jia et al., 2017 ;  Pu et al., 2015 ;  Tunganuntarat et al., 2023 ). In yeast, the functions of BORC have been proposed to be carried out by BLOC1, which in mammals shares subunits with BORC ( John Peter et al., 2013 ;  Langemeyer and Ungermann, 2015 ). Trafficking of lysosomes to the cell periphery promotes cell transcription, translation and metabolic processes associated with proliferation; furthermore, lysosomal trafficking is reported to be regulated by mTORC1 signaling, a known vulnerability of  NF1 -deficient cells that is also the proposed mechanism of regulating autophagic activity ( Li et al., 2021 ;  Pu et al., 2017 ;  Varin et al., 2016 ). Additional work in  Caenorhabditis elegans  has shown specifically that mTORC1 activation releases BORC and allows it to recruit the proteins necessary for lysosomal trafficking, like kinesin 1, as well as activation of Arl8 ( Fazeli et al., 2023 ). In the context of breast cancer, high expression of  ARL8B  or BORC subunit genes is associated with poor prognosis, and expression of these proteins promotes invasion of cells that evade radiation treatment ( Wu et al., 2020 ). Here, we show that knockdown of the BORCS6 subunit recapitulates the phenotypes observed following Y102 treatment, including accumulation of macroautophagy- and mitophagy-specific receptors, an increase in p21 expression and nucleus size, the perinuclear clustering of lysosomes and decreased viability of  NF1 -deficient cells. Together, the data presented in this study suggest that BORCS6 is a target of Y102, and inhibition of BORC is a potential vulnerability of  NF1 -deficient tumors.  NF1  deficiency leads to oncogenic RAS, MEK and ERK signaling ( Ratner and Miller, 2015 ). Additionally, tumors with  NF1  loss share a pan-cancer RAS pathway activation RNA signature with tumors that have mutations in RAS family genes, including melanomas with  BRAF  mutations ( Way et al., 2018 ). It is possible, therefore, that other tumors with oncogenic levels of RAS signaling will be susceptible to inhibition of BORC, which we are currently exploring.",
