Author information: (1)Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Penn Cardiovascular Institute,  and the Institute for Regenerative Medicine, University of Pennsylvania,  Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.  Von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis is a common autosomal dominant genetic  disorder characterized by benign and malignant tumors of neural crest origin.  Significant progress in understanding the pathophysiology of this disease has  occurred in recent years, largely aided by the development of relevant animal  models. Von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis is caused by mutations in the NF1  gene, which encodes neurofibromin, a large protein that modulates the activity  of Ras. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of zebrafish  nf1a and nf1b, orthologues of NF1, and show neural crest and cardiovascular  defects resulting from morpholino knockdown, including vascular and cardiac  valvular abnormalities. Development of a zebrafish model of von Recklinghausen  neurofibromatosis will allow for structure-function analysis and genetic screens  in this tractable vertebrate system.
