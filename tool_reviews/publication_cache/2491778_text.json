  "abstract": "The defective gene causing von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1), one of the most common inherited disorders affecting the human nervous system, was recently mapped to chromosome 17. We have used additional DNA markers to further narrow and bracket the NF1 defect. A multipoint linkage analysis suggests that the NF1 gene is flanked by D17Z1 on the centromeric side and by EW 207 on the telomeric side of the long arm of chromosome 17. The identification of closely linked flanking markers should allow us to develop a reliable prenatal and presymptomatic diagnostic test for this serious neurological disorder and provides the basis for applying chromosome-specific cloning techniques for the isolation and characterization of the mutant gene.",
