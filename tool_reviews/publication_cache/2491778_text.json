  "abstract": "Flanking markers for the gene causing von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis  (NF1).  Seizinger BR(1), Farmer GE, Haines JL, Ozelius LJ, Anderson K, Korf BR, Parry  DM, Pericak-Vance MA, Mulvihill JJ, Menon A, et al.  Author information: (1)Neurogenetics Laboratory, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston 02114.  The defective gene causing von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1), one of  the most common inherited disorders affecting the human nervous system, was  recently mapped to chromosome 17. We have used additional DNA markers to further  narrow and bracket the NF1 defect. A multipoint linkage analysis suggests that  the NF1 gene is flanked by D17Z1 on the centromeric side and by EW 207 on the  telomeric side of the long arm of chromosome 17. The identification of closely  linked flanking markers should allow us to develop a reliable prenatal and  presymptomatic diagnostic test for this serious neurological disorder and  provides the basis for applying chromosome-specific cloning techniques for the  isolation and characterization of the mutant gene.
