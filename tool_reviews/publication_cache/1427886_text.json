  "abstract": "A radiation hybrid map of the region on human chromosome 22 containing the  neurofibromatosis type 2 locus.  Frazer KA(1), Boehnke M, Budarf ML, Wolff RK, Emanuel BS, Myers RM, Cox DR.  Author information: (1)Department of Anatomy, University of California, San Francisco 94143.  We describe a high-resolution radiation hybrid map of the region on human  chromosome 22 containing the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) gene. Eighty-five  hamster-human somatic cell hybrids generated by X-irradiation and cell fusion  were used to generate the radiation hybrid map. The presence or absence of 18  human chromosome 22-specific markers was determined in each hybrid by using  Southern blot hybridization. Sixteen of the 18 markers were distinguishable by  X-ray breakage in the radiation hybrids. Analysis of these data using two  different mathematical models and two different statistical methods resulted in  a single framework map consisting of 8 markers ordered with odds greater than  1000:1. The remaining nonframework markers were all localized to regions  consisting of two adjoining intervals on the framework map with odds greater  than 1000:1. Based on the RH map, the NF2 region of chromosome 22, defined by  the flanking markers D22S1 and D22S28, is estimated to span a physical distance  of approximately 6 Mb and is the most likely location for 9 of the 18 markers  studied: D22S33, D22S41, D22S42, D22S46, D22S56, LIF, D22S37, D22S44, and  D22S15.
