  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGG) are the most frequent brain tumors in children. Up to 50% will be refractory to conventional chemotherapy. It is now known that the majority of PLGG have activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway. The same pathway is also activated in plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) which are low-grade tumors involving peripheral nerves in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). These lesions are known to be refractory to chemotherapy. Specific MEK inhibitors such as trametinib are now available and have been approved for other cancers harboring mutations in the MAPK/ERK pathway such as melanoma. We have observed significant responses to trametinib in patients with refractory PLGG in our institutions and results from the phase I study are promising. The treatment appears not only efficacious but is also usually well tolerated. We hypothesize that we will observe responses in the majority of refractory PLGG and PN treated with trametinib in this phase 2 study. METHODS: The primary objective is to determine the objective response rate of trametinib as a single agent for treatment of progressing/refractory tumors with MAPK/ERK pathway activation. The TRAM-01 study is a phase II multicentric open-label basket trial including four groups. Group 1 includes NF1 patients with progressing/refractory glioma. Group 2 includes NF1 patients with plexiform neurofibroma. Group 3 includes patients with progressing/refractory glioma with KIAA1549-BRAF fusion. Group 4 includes other patients with progressing/refractory glioma with activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway. Eligible patients for a given study group will receive daily oral trametinib at full dose for a total of 18 cycles of 28 days. A total of 150 patients will be enrolled in seven Canadian centers. Secondary objectives include the assessment of progression-free survival, overall survival, safety and tolerability of trametinib, serum levels of trametinib and evaluation of quality of life during treatment. DISCUSSION: Trametinib will allow us to target directly and specifically the MAPK/ERK pathway. We expect to observe a significant response in most patients. Following our study, trametinib could be integrated into standard treatment of PLGG and PN. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03363217 December 6, 2017.",

Secondary objectives include the assessment of progression-free survival, overall survival, safety and tolerability of trametinib, serum levels of trametinib and evaluation of quality of life during treatment. Methods/design Objectives The primary objective is to determine the response rate of daily trametinib as a single agent for treatment of progressing/refractory tumors with MAPK/ERK pathway activation. The response rate is defined as the proportion of patients with stable disease (SD), minor response (MR), partial response (PR) and complete response (CR) as the best response on study. Secondary objectives include:\n Determine efficacy outcome defined as time to progression (TTP), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) up to three years following completion of treatment. Determine the safety and tolerability of trametinib. Adverse events (AE) and severe adverse events (SAE) will be monitored. Analyse the serum levels of trametinib. Analysis of trough level will be done twice (at day 22, and before starting cycle 16 or at progression whichever comes first). Assess changes in quality of life over treatment phases and compare pre and post changes across groups. Evaluations of quality of daily life will be recorded at inclusion and every six months with the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) (Generic Core Scales/Brain tumor modules/Infant Scales). Exploratory objectives include:\n Determine if there are cognitive changes in patients with NF1 during treatment with trametinib. Neurocognitive assessment will be performed at inclusion and at completion of treatment using: Bayley-III, D-KEFS, WPPSIV, WISC-V and WAIS-IV depending on the age of patients with NF1. To investigate and correlate biological features to tumor response. Gene expression profiling will be done on fresh frozen tissue and mutational analysis on paraffin-embedded tissue. Circulating tumor DNA in blood (ctDNA) will be assessed throughout treatment. Study design The TRAM-01 study is a phase II open-label basket trial. A total of seven pediatric academic hospitals will be participating. Four groups of patients will be included. Group 1 includes NF1 patients with progressing/refractory glioma. Group 2 includes NF1 patients with plexiform neurofibroma. Group 3 includes patients with progressing/refractory glioma with KIAA1549-BRAF fusion. Group 4 includes other patients with progressing/refractory glioma with activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway. Mutational status is determined locally in participating institutions and will be confirmed centrally.

Administration of oral medication. Patients must be able to ingest and retain enterally (per os, nasogastric tube or gastrostomy) administered medication and be free of any clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities limiting the absorption of the medication. Tablets cannot be crushed. If the patient cannot swallow tablets, the liquid form should then be used. Exclusion criteria \n \n Other investigational agents. Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents. Cardiac exclusion criteria. Patient who has an ejection fraction inferior to the institution LLN, a QTcB ≥480 msec or an absolute resting left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≤39% are not eligible for enrolment. Presence of another malignancy. Patient has any other malignancy except if the other primary malignancy is neither currently clinically significant nor requiring active intervention Previous MEK inhibitor treatment. Participants previously treated with a MEK inhibitor who showed less than stable disease during treatment Tumor with BRAF V600E mutation. Patients with a tumor presenting a positive BRAF V600E mutation Other uncontrollable medical disease. Patient who has a severe and uncontrollable medical disease, has a chronic liver disease, uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Known HIV infection. Patient who has a known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, hepatitis B or C Previous surgery. Patients who had major surgery within 2 weeks prior to study entry Allergy. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to trametinib Previous history of non-compliance. Patients with a previous significant history of non-compliance to their treatment or medical regimen Pregnant or breastfeeding patients. Pregnant or breastfeeding female patients are not eligible for this study Sample size We expect to recruit a total of 150 (Group 1 and 3 = 42 patients each, Group 2 = 46 patients and Group 4 = 20 patients). Sample size was calculated based on the assumption that trametinib will be considered inactive if the true response rate is 40% or less; however, if the true response rate is 60% or more, then this treatment would be considered worthy of further study. Therefore, set H0: response rate = 0.40 (lower limit) versus HA: response rate = 0.60. Simon optimal model was used. For Groups 1, 2 and 3 a minimum of 39 patients is needed in order to support or reject H0. Since 42 patients will be enrolled in Groups 1 and 3 and 46 patients in Group 2 this will account for non-compliance and loss to follow-up of 7 and 15% respectively. Group 4 will be looking at the feasibility to include and treat patients without NF1 and KIAA1549-BRAF fusion. If the recruitment cannot be completed for any reason, participants in Groups 1, 3 and 4 can be pooled to test H0 for PLGG. Intervention During the treatment phase, patients will receive trametinib at a fixed dose of 0.025 mg/kg (patients ≥6 years) or 0.032 mg/kg (patients < 6 years) with no dose escalation. Trametinib will be administered for up to 18 cycles of 28 days to assess the efficacy and safety in patients with PLGG or PN. Patients weighting < 33 kg or who cannot swallow tablets will receive the oral solution. Available formulations and strengths are trametinib 0.5 mg tablets, trametinib 2 mg tablets and trametinib powder for oral solution (0.05 mg/mL). For toxicity related to trametinib, one dose reduction will be accepted. The need for a second dose reduction will lead to the permanent discontinuation of study treatment. Specific guidelines are available in the protocol for management of toxicity. Follow-up phase Patients will be followed every six months for up to 3 years post-treatment or progression. They will be followed for overall survival, further progression and information on further lines of anti-cancer treatments; if known, dates of initiation and end dates will be collected. Data collection All data for the TRAM-01 study is entered in a customized Electronic Data Capture system developed by Information Management Systems (IMS) at the Lady Davis Institution. Radiological evaluation MRI will be done at screening and every 3 cycles during treatment phase and every six months during the follow-up period. Baseline lesions and responses for Groups 1, 3 and 4 will be evaluated using the modified Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO). Target lesion(s) must measure at least 10 mm by 5 mm.\n Complete Response (CR) - No radiological evidence of tumor on MRI scans. Partial Response (PR) - Greater than 50% reduction in the sum of the product of the greatest tumor diameter and its perpendicular diameter taking as reference the baseline measurements by MRI scan. Minor Response (MR) - 25-50% reduction in the sum of the product of the greatest tumor diameter and its perpendicular diameter taking as reference the baseline measurements by MRI scan. Stable Disease (SD) - Less than a 25% decrease or ≤ 25% increase in the sum of the product of the greatest tumor perpendicular diameters taking as reference the smallest measurement since treatment started by MRI scan. Progressive Disease (PD) - Greater than a 25% increase in the sum of the product of the greatest tumor perpendicular diameters in the tumour size by MRI taking as reference the smallest measurement since treatment started by MRI scan, or appearance of one or more new tumoral lesion in a previously uninvolved area on MRI scan. Baseline lesions and responses for Group 2 will be evaluated using a modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1). Target lesion(s) must measure at least 30 mm in on direction.\n Complete Response (CR)- No radiological evidence of tumor on MRI scans. Partial Response (PR) - Greater than 50% reduction in the sum of the greatest tumors diameters on MRI scan taking as reference baseline measurements. Minor Response (MR) - 25-50% reduction in the sum of the greatest tumors diameters on MRI scan taking as reference baseline measurements. Stable Disease (SD) - Less than a 25% decrease or ≤ 25% increase in the sum of the greatest tumors diameters taking as reference the smallest measurement since treatment started. Progressive Disease (PD) - Greater than a 25% increase in the sum of the greatest tumors diameters taking as reference the smallest measurement since treatment started or appearance of one or more new tumoral lesion in a previously uninvolved area. All treatment responses throughout this study will be centrally reviewed by an independent radiologist. Neuropsychological evaluation Neuropsychological evaluations will be conducted to assess cognitive function at start of treatment +/− 28 days, and at the end of treatment (between cycle 17 and the end of cycle 18) for NF1 patients (Groups 1 and 2 patients only). Testing battery will depend on age at inclusion (Bayley III < 3 years old, WPPSIV ≥3 to 5 years old, WISC-V ≥ 6 to 16 years old, WAIS-IV for ≥17 years old and D-KEFS for ≥8 years old). Quality of life evaluation To document the quality of life of patients, the PedsQL Generic scale and Brain Tumor module [ 32 – 34 ]. The measures are available over the age span with an infant scale for patients under 2 years will be used to assess the physical, mental, social health dimensions, as well as the cognitive development of children [ 35 ]. The PedsQL integrates the generic and disease-specific approaches with child self-reports and parent proxy-reports [ 36 ]. Thus, both questionnaires will be completed by the patient and one caregiver. Biological study To determine study group, the NF1 diagnosis will be confirmed clinically based on NIH criteria or by genetic testing. KIAA1549-fusion will be confirmed by FISH or CGH in local institution. V600E mutation will be excluded by immunohistochemistry staining or RT-PCR. Next generation sequencing will be done in the form of RNAseq and as needed a targeted panel (if no alteration is identified in RNAseq). All genetic alterations will be validated. DNA methylation assay using the 850 K array will be performed. Statistical analysis A two-stage assessment during recruitment will be conducted. For Groups 1 and 3, assuming alpha = 0.05 and power = 0.70: During Stage 1, 11 patients will be accrued. Group will continue to Stage 2 if ≥6 patients have an objective response (total of best responses = SD + MR + PR + CR). During Stage 2, if ≤21 patients have an objective response, the treatment will be deemed inactive. For Group 2, assuming alpha = 0.05 and power = 0.80: During Stage 1, 16 patients will be accrued. Group will continue to Stage 2 if ≥8 patients have an objective response (total of best responses = SD + MR + PR + CR). During Stage 2, if ≤23 patients have an objective response, the treatment will be deemed inactive. Objective responses will be listed by patient and timepoint; best response on study, TTP, PFS, and OS will be reported by patient. Descriptive summary statistics for each group will be presented for TTP, PFS, and OS. Curves for PFS, TTP, and OS may be estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Safety Scientific evaluation was done at Sainte-Justine by an independent committee prior to submission to research ethics board (REB). The first ethical review was conducted at CHU Sainte-Justine. An independent and outside ARO (academic research organization), Exactis Innovation, has been assigned for the management of this study. Exactis will be responsible for overseeing the regulatory aspects and, monitoring of sites, verify compliance and conduct site visits. We will record all AEs and SAEs to better evaluate tolerability. The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised CTCAE version 5.0 will be used. Management of AEs of special interest is well described in the protocol. In order to detect early signs of toxicities, surveillance exams will include regular ophthalmologic evaluations, EKG, echocardiogram and X-ray of the growth plate. All SAEs must be reported within 24 h after the Investigator is made aware. A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) was created following the study approval. DSMB will be tasked with determining safe and effective conduct of the study and with recommending the date for the conclusion of the trial based upon whether significant benefits or risks have developed. All members composing the DSMB are independent from the research team and free of any conflicts of interest. A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will receive and review the progress and accrual data of this trial and will safeguard the interests of trial participants, periodically review and evaluate the accumulated study data for participant safety and efficacy and monitor the progress and overall conduct of the clinical trial. The DMC has access to quarterly study reports, raw study data so that they can see any emerging risks such as frequent or severe adverse events.",
