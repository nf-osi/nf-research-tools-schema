  "abstract": "A large number of eukaryotic proteins have been shown to be anchored to the cell membrane by glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI). This glycolipid anchor can serve as a substrate for anchor-specific phospholipases that convert the GPI-anchored membrane proteins into soluble forms. Soluble forms of many GPI anchored proteins have been identified in vivo in connective tissue, plasma, and urine. The authors have discovered that mammalian plasma contains a GPI-specific phospholipase D (GPI-PLD). Because it recognizes a portion of the conserved glycan core structure, all GPI-anchored proteins are potential substrates. The authors report the development of a murine monoclonal antibody specific for one form of the human GPI-PLD and the immunohistochemical localization of this enzyme to mast cells.",
