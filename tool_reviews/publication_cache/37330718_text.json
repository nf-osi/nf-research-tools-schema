  "title": "Current and Emerging Imaging Techniques for Neurofibromatosis Type 1-Associated Cutaneous Neurofibromas.",
  "abstract": "A consistent set of measurement techniques must be applied to reliably and reproducibly evaluate the efficacy of treatments for cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs) in people with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). cNFs are\u00a0neurocutaneous tumors that are the most common tumor in people with NF1 and represent an area of unmet clinical need. This review presents the available data regarding approaches in use or development to identify, measure, and track cNFs, including calipers, digital imaging, and high-frequency ultrasound sonography. We also describe emerging technologies such as spatial frequency domain imaging and the application of imaging modalities such as optical coherence tomography that may enable the detection of early cNFs and prevention of tumor-associated morbidity.",
