The architecture of individual cells and cell collectives enables functional  specification, a prominent example being the formation of epithelial tubes that  transport fluid or gas in many organs. The intrahepatic bile ducts (IHBDs) form  a tubular network within the liver parenchyma that transports bile to the  intestine. Aberrant biliary 'neoductulogenesis' is also a feature of several  liver pathologies including tumorigenesis. However, the mechanism of biliary  tube morphogenesis in development or disease is not known. Elimination of the  neurofibromatosis type 2 protein (NF2; also known as merlin or neurofibromin 2)  causes hepatomegaly due to massive biliary neoductulogenesis in the mouse liver.  We show that this phenotype reflects unlimited biliary morphogenesis rather than  proliferative expansion. Our studies suggest that NF2 normally limits biliary  morphogenesis by coordinating lumen expansion and cell architecture. This work  provides fundamental insight into how biliary fate and tubulogenesis are  coordinated during development and will guide analyses of disease-associated and  experimentally induced biliary pathologies.  © 2018.
