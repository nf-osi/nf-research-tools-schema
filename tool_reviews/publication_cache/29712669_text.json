  "title": "Proliferation-independent role of NF2 (merlin) in limiting biliary morphogenesis.",
  "abstract": "The architecture of individual cells and cell collectives enables functional specification, a prominent example being the formation of epithelial tubes that transport fluid or gas in many organs. The intrahepatic bile ducts (IHBDs) form a tubular network within the liver parenchyma that transports bile to the intestine. Aberrant biliary 'neoductulogenesis' is also a feature of several liver pathologies including tumorigenesis. However, the mechanism of biliary tube morphogenesis in development or disease is not known. Elimination of the neurofibromatosis type 2 protein (NF2; also known as merlin or neurofibromin 2) causes hepatomegaly due to massive biliary neoductulogenesis in the mouse liver. We show that this phenotype reflects unlimited biliary morphogenesis rather than proliferative expansion. Our studies suggest that NF2 normally limits biliary morphogenesis by coordinating lumen expansion and cell architecture. This work provides fundamental insight into how biliary fate and tubulogenesis are coordinated during development and will guide analyses of disease-associated and experimentally induced biliary pathologies.",
