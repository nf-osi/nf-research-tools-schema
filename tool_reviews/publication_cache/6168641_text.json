  "abstract": "The clinical experimental model of HLI application in the therapy of skin and mucosal cancers of the head and neck has opened new prospects in HLI utilization. Based on clinical observations and research it may be concluded that HLI, if applied topically in the area of the tumor, may induce its disappearance or regression. If applied presurgically, it blocks the dispersion of neocytes during surgery. Also, HLI inhibits metastatic dissemination of malignant tumors and therefore might reduce the percentage of patients with recurrence, decreasing the chance of survival of any other primary tumor.",
