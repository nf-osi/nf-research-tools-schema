  "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an inherited disease in which affected patients are predisposed to develop benign Schwann cell (SC) tumours called neurofibromas. In the mouse, loss of Nf1 in the SC lineage causes neurofibroma formation. The tyrosine kinase receptor EGFR is expressed in Schwann cell precursors (SCP), which have been implicated in plexiform neurofibroma initiation. To test if EGFR activity affects neurofibroma initiation, size, and/or number, we studied mice expressing human EGFR in SCs and SCP in the context of mice that form neurofibromas. Neurofibroma number increased in homozygous CNP-hEGFR mice versus heterozygous littermates, and neurofibroma number and size increased when CNP-hEGFR was crossed to Nf1",
