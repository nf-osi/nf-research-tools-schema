  "abstract": "Neurofibromin is the major ras inactivator in dendritic spines.  Oliveira AF(1), Yasuda R.  Author information: (1)Department of Neurobiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North  Carolina 27710, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Duke University Medical Center,  Durham, North Carolina 27710, Max-Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience,  Jupiter, Florida 33458, and Doctoral Program in Biomedicine and Experimental  Biology, Center for Neuroscience and Cell Biology, University of Coimbra,  3004-517 Coimbra, Portugal.  In dendritic spines, Ras plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity but its  regulation mechanism is not fully understood. Here, using a fluorescence  resonance energy transfer/fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy-based Ras  imaging technique in combination with 2-photon glutamate uncaging, we show that  neurofibromin, in which loss-of-function mutations cause Neurofibromatosis Type  1 (NF1), contributes to the majority (∼90%) of Ras inactivation in dendritic  spines of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus. Loss of  neurofibromin causes sustained Ras activation in spines, which leads to  impairment of spine structural plasticity and loss of spines in an  activity-dependent manner. Therefore, deregulation of postsynaptic Ras signaling  may explain, at least in part, learning disabilities associated with NF1.
