  "abstract": "To compare 1D (linear) tumor volume calculations and classification systems with 3D-segmented volumetric analysis (SVA), focusing specifically on their effectiveness in the evaluation and management of NF2-associated vestibular schwannomas (VS). VS were clinically followed every 6 months with cranial, thin-sliced (<\u20093\u00a0mm) MRI. We retrospectively reviewed and used T1-weighted post-contrast enhanced (gadolinium) images for both SVA and linear measurements. 3D-SVA was performed manually or combined with semiautomated segmentation by using axial planes. The maximum linear dimensions (MLD) were determined in three dimensions (anteroposterior, transverse, and craniocaudal planes) using axial and coronal planes. The MLD was cubed (MLD",

A total of 149 NF2 patients and 292 tumors were included in this retrospective analysis and were followed up between 2004 and 2021 at the Department of Neurosurgery and Centre of Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis in T\u00fcbingen. All procedures and methods performed in this study were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. Informed consent was obtained from all participants or their parents/legal guardians included in the study. Ethical approval was obtained from the ethics board of the Medical Faculty and the University Hospital of T\u00fcbingen (No 018/2019BO2, final approval date 17/01/2019). 13 Five patients exhibited unilateral VS (no contralateral VS visible in the thin-layered MRI at any time point), whereas the remaining 144 patients had bilateral lesions. All included patients had at least two MRI scans and one year of routine radiological follow-up. Both internally and externally performed MRI data sets were used. All patient data and imaging were located on a secure server that is accessible to the clinical staff of the University Hospital T\u00fcbingen. MRIs at any treatment timepoint (observation, before and after surgery, with neoadjuvant or adjuvant (postop) off-label treatment with Bevacizumab and after radiation treatment) were included. The analysis explicitly did not address hearing outcomes or growth behavior or examine the outcome of undergone treatment modalities (surgery, off-label treatment with Bevacizumab, radiosurgery). However, volume changes and the challenges related to measurement methods should be explicitly assessed postoperatively, as (partial) resection often leads to significant alterations in the configuration of the residual tumor, unlike radiation or bevacizumab therapy. The entire tumor, including its extension inside and outside the internal auditory canals, was measured in all measurement procedures. MRI data sets with implants (cochlea or auditory brainstem implant) were excluded. Tumor size was classified by the Hannover  and Koos classification systems 12 . 14 For the 3D-based segmented volumetric analysis (SVA), postcontrast thin-sliced (\u2264\u20093\u00a0mm) T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) sequences were uploaded into the iPlan Net software (Brainlab, Feldkirchen, Germany), and volumes were measured manually or in combination with semiautomated segmentation according to our previous studies . 15 For the 1D-based linear measurements, the MRIs were first carefully analyzed to visualize the most ideal and most considerable tumor extension (VS width) in axial and coronal sequences. Subsequently, the maximum linear (tumor) diameter (MLD) in axial and coronal (medial to lateral and caudal to rostral/cranial, in total four measurements per MRI) planes were measured according to the RECIST guidelines . 16 To compare tumor volumes using one-dimensional (1D) and three-dimensional (3D) methods, we employed the cubed maximum linear diameter (MLD\u00b3), as previously described . Additionally, to give a second volumetric impression, the maximum linear diameters in the anteroposterior, craniocaudal, and transverse planes were multiplied (orthogonal analysis, OA) according to previous studies 6 , 7 . 7 These represent the tumor\u2019s full extent and are comparable with other studies.

The greatest linear measurement was defined as the Maximum Linear Diameter (MLD), which was additionally cubed for the volumetric analysis. The maximum linear measurements in the anteroposterior (transverse), cranio-caudal (coronal), and transverse (axial plane) were multiplied to give a second volumetric estimate in the Orthogonal Analysis (OA). The MLD and OA were defined and calculated similarly to previous studies for better comparison. In addition, we have included a fourth dimension (defined as \u201cT1 cor length\u201d = transverse tumor diameter in coronal planes) separately to gain a comprehensive impression. Statistical analysis Statistical evaluation was performed using the Statistical Package for Social Studies (SPSS 10.0 for Windows, SPSS Inc.). The significance level was set to a  p-value\u2009\u2264\u20090.05  for all analyses. To obtain a size reference for the measured and calculated volumes, these were (sub)grouped using the Hannover and Koos classification systems. A linear regression model was performed to investigate the following aspects/comparisons: \n \n Comparison between linear-based diameter assessments (maximum linear diameter, MLD) and their 1D-based volume calculations (orthogonal analysis, OA; cubed maximum linear dimensions, MLD 3 ) for segmented (3D) volume (segmented volumetric analysis, SVA). The percentage deviation of the linear-based methods compared to segmented volumetric analysis. The effect and the comparability of OA and MLD 3  versus SVA methods in terms of postoperative volume reduction through partial resection dimensions. The validity of the classification systems (Hannover and Koos) compared to the linear-based and 3D-based methods. A graphical analysis of the scattering widths and comparisons of all measurement methods was carried out using plots. A one-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was run to determine the deviation of MLD 3 , OA, and SVA on classification systems Koos and Hannover (estimation grade).

  "introduction": "Introduction The development of bilateral vestibular schwannomas (VS) is the hallmark of the tumor predisposition syndrome Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) related schwannomatosis. VS-related symptoms such as hearing loss, tinnitus, and balance disorders may occur early in the course of the disease and are the major presenting symptoms in adults concerning NF2 . Due to VS, which is highly penetrating during the disease, there is a very high risk of bilateral deafness during disease progress. The early evaluation of tumor volume and growth behavior in NF2-associated vestibular schwannoma (VS) by regular, serial cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is indispensable. Contrast-enhanced CT can be an alternative for patients who cannot undergo MRI. This is generally less susceptible to artifacts caused by hearing implants, for example. 1 Nevertheless, in NF2 patients, MRI remains the gold standard mainly due to the low risk of radiation exposure. T1-weighted sequences with contrast agents in axial and coronal planes facilitate an optimal evaluation of NF-associated VS. In addition, T2-weighted and Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) sequences prove valuable in assessing cystic components present within or adjacent to the tumor . Other functional MRI techniques, such as dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and spiral  2 23 Na-MRI acquisition for total sodium concentration quantification, may also help to evaluate treatment responses following radiosurgery  or antiangiogenic therapy 3 , 4 . 5 Imaging is intended to find the right time point of therapy in combination with hearing diagnostics. Depending on tumor size, growth behavior, and hearing function, treatment is predominantly limited to a \u201cwait and scan\u201d strategy, surgery, and off-label use of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor bevacizumab. Cranial MRI should be performed every 4 to 6 months in children, adolescents, and young adults of each tumor size, as well as in adults with large tumors. In small tumors with stable tumor growth and (excellent/good) hearing, these intervals can be extended to 12 months. Remarkably, NF2 patients with an ongoing off-label treatment with the VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor) inhibitor bevacizumab should strictly follow these intervals to rule out possible side effects such as intracranial bleeding events. The tumor volume and growth rate of VS can be determined either by one-dimensional (1D) linear measurements of the greatest diameter or by three-dimensional (3D) volumetric analysis . The disadvantage of the latter procedure is primarily the complexity of its implementation, which takes considerably more time. The development of semi-automation has significantly improved this. Most studies evaluating the growth behavior of NF2-associated VS are based on 1D-based methods, as this is quicker and easier to carry out. However, these seem too imprecise compared to 3D volumetry and have a high intra-observer variability 6 , 7 . Furthermore, they are known to underestimate small and overestimate large tumor volumes 8 . In addition, previous studies are difficult to compare to each other and our study due to the low numbers of investigated MRI scans in both sporadic 6 , 8  and NF2-associated 7 \u2013 9  VS ( 6 , 9 , 10 n \u2009=\u200943\u2013252). In the clinical routine, classification systems such as the Koos  and Hannover classification 11  are still used and helpful to give an impression of the tumor size. These stratify the tumors based on intra- and extrameatal extension and brainstem compression. However, these do not give a detailed impression of the growth behavior. Above all, they are often unable to depict and assess small increases or decreases in volume and, thus, possible therapeutic influences. 12 Unlike sporadic unilateral VS, the bilateral presence of these tumors poses a challenge for all radiological evaluations and volume determinations. Due to the often simultaneously occurring collision tumors such as meningiomas or non-vestibular schwannomas, these are not always easy to differentiate. In addition, they frequently change their configuration and volume due to (often multiple) treatment(s), especially after previous partial resections. In the following study, we investigated the accuracy and compared 1D and 3D-based methods for determining tumor volume in NF2-associated VS in a large patient/tumor collective. We also referenced and correlated the Koos and Hannover classification systems. In addition, the influence of surgery to reduce the tumor volume on the validity of the measurement methods should also be considered.",

Preoperative and postoperative values were measured within 3 months before and after surgery. * Many patients/tumors underwent several treatment modalities. Of the 157 operated tumors, 114 tumors (73%) were operated on once, 38 tumors (24%) twice, and five tumors (3%) three times. Off-label use with Bevacizumab before or after surgery. Out of the 13 tumors that were irradiated, two were solely treated with radiation. The other 11 tumors underwent a combination of radiation, surgery, and, in some cases, additional Bevacizumab. The majority of tumors (77%,  n \u2009=\u2009225) had to undergo solid or multiple treatment modalities, whereas 67 tumors (23%) were only observed. Surgery was the primary (70%,  n \u2009=\u2009157/225) treatment of choice, followed by solid or (neo-)/adjuvant off-label treatment with Bevacizumab (30%,  n \u2009=\u200968), and only 13 tumors were irradiated (6%,  n \u2009=\u200913). Among 137(157) operated tumors with available MRI scans directly before and after surgery, 87(63%) tumors were partially (10\u201390% resection extent) resected due to preserving hearing function, and in 34(25%) tumors higher resection extents (>\u200990%) could be achieved due to preoperative deafness. The remaining 16 operated tumors (12%) even showed a growth progression in the first postoperative MRI after three to six months. Strong positive correlations between all included measurement techniques For the statistical analysis, SVA was defined as the dependent variable (cm 3 ) and MLDs (T1ax length, T1ax width, T1cor length, T1cor width), MLD 3 , OA, Koos, Hannover) as independent variables. A total of 2333 measurement values for each technique could be included. All eight variables added statistically significantly to the prediction. A linear regression model established that all measurement techniques and classification systems (MLDs in coronal/axial planes, MLD 3 , OA, Hannover, and Koos) statistically significantly predict SVA, F (8,2324)\u2009=\u20092003.457,  p \u2009<\u20090.0005. Residuals were independent, as assessed by a Durbin-Watson statistic of 1.794. Homoscedasticity was evaluated by visual inspection of a plot of standardized residuals versus standardized predicted values. Residuals were normally distributed as assessed by visual inspection of a normal probability plot. A Pearson\u2019s product-moment correlation was run to assess the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. There was a strong positive correlation between all parameters,  r \u2009>\u20090.5, and all comparisons were statistically (highly) significant ( p \u2009<\u20090.001). The correlations of parameters are summarized in Supplementary Table ST1. Since SVA is considered the gold standard and comparative value, the OA showed a stronger positive correlation than the MLD 3 . Within the subgroups according to the classification systems Koos and Hannover, smaller tumors (T1/T2, K1/K2) exhibited a low to moderate positive correlation (SVA vs. OA/MLD 3 : r 2 \u2009=\u20090.225\u20130.435) compared to medium-sized (T3, K2, K3) and large tumors (T4, K4) (SVA vs. OA/ MLD 3 : r 2 \u2009=\u20090.540\u20130.758). Detailed correlation coefficients are integrated in Fig.\u00a0 2 . \n \n Fig. 2 Linear regression model between MLD 3  / OA and SVA for Koos ( a ,  b ) and Hannover ( c ,  d ) categories. MLD 3 \u2014 Cubed maximum linear diameter (MLD 3 ) in cm 3 ; SVA\u2014segmented volumetric analysis in cm 3 . OA\u2014 Orthogonal analysis in cm 3 ; SVA\u2014segmented volumetric analysis. Tumor sizes are sub-grouped according to the Koos (K1-K4) \u00a0and Hannover classification system (T1, T2, T3a/b, T4a/b) 11 .\u00a0 The graph describes each Koos/Hannover classification\u2019s correlation coefficient \u201cR2 Linear\u201d values. There is a positive correlation between the two comparative variables for all comparisons. Overall, the correlation between OA and SVA is more robust than between MLD 12 3  and SVA, but the scattering range is extensive in both comparison groups. Large variability/scattering in all tumor sizes with independent variables compared to SVA Since SVA is defined as the gold standard method, the other measurement techniques exhibited a large variability, especially within small classified tumors (T1, T2, K1). Figure\u00a0 2  illustrates scattering plots and r 2 -values of the subgroupings in each comparison. Influence of a surgically induced tumor volume reduction on 1D (MLD3 and OA) and 3D-based (SVA) volume calculations As the disease usually leads to further growth of the remaining tumor after surgery, subsequent monitoring of tumor growth using measurement methods is essential and decisive for the initiation of further therapeutic measures (usually off-label Bevacizumab or secondary surgery). Due to the usually only partially achievable extent of resection to preserve the hearing, the tumor configurations are generally changed by surgery. A linear regression model established that pre- and postoperative MLD 3  and OA statistically significantly ( p \u2009<\u20090.0005) predict SVA (preoperative), F (2,1080)\u2009=\u20093930,627 and SVA (postoperative) F (2,1251)\u2009=\u20092522,296. There was a strong positive correlation between all parameters,  r \u2009>\u20090.5, and all comparisons were statistically (highly) significant ( p \u2009<\u20090.001). Residuals were independent, as assessed by a Durbin-Watson statistic. Homoscedasticity was evaluated by visual inspection of a plot of standardized residuals versus standardized predicted values. Residuals were normally distributed as assessed by visual inspection of a normal probability plot. Nevertheless, in the direct comparisons of pre-and postoperative correlation coefficients (scattering plots are illustrated in Fig.\u00a0 3 a and b), postoperative correlation coefficients are weaker than preoperative, particularly in comparing MLD 3  vs. SVA. \n \n Fig. 3 Scattering plots and linear regression for the perioperative comparisons MLD 3 (a)  and OA  (b)  versus SVA. MLD 3 \u2014 Cubed maximum linear diameter (MLD 3 ) in cm 3 ; SVA\u2014segmented volumetric analysis in cm 3 . OA\u2014 Orthogonal analysis in cm 3 ; SVA\u2014segmented volumetric analysis. Percentage deviation of 1D-based volume calculations (MLD3 and OA) and classification systems from 3D volumetry (SVA) The percentage deviation from MLD 3  and OA to SVA was normally distributed for each Koos category, as assessed by Shapiro-Wilk\u2019s test ( p \u2009<\u20090.05). There was a linear relationship between MLD 3  and OA, as assessed by scatterplot. Koos categories scored higher (overestimation) in MLD 3  than in OA measurements  (Supplementary Table ST2).  The lower the category/, the smaller the scored tumor size, the higher the (over)estimation in both MLD 3  and OA, but especially in MLD 3 . Group differences (SVA, MLD\u00b3, and OA) within the classification systems The difference between SVA, MLD 3  and OA on the combined dependent variables  (Koos categories ,  Supplementary Figure SF1a)  was statistically significant, F (6, 4650)\u2009=\u200924.614,  p \u2009<\u20090.001; Wilks\u00b4\u03bb\u2009=\u20090.939; partial \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.031. Tukey post-hoc tests showed that for SVA and MLD 3 , all comparisons of Koos categories with each other showed statistically significant differences ( p \u2009<\u20090.05). The most considerable difference in MLD 3  mean scores was between categories K1 and K4. For OA, Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test showed that Koos grade K2 showed no significant difference to Koos grade K3 ( p \u2009>\u20090.05). All other comparisons were statistically significant ( p \u2009<\u20090.05), and an enormous difference in OA mean scores was seen between categories K1 and K4. The difference between SVA, MLD 3,  and OA on the combined dependent variables  (Hannover categories ,  Supplementary Figure SF1b)  was statistically significant, F (15, 2329)\u2009=\u2009210.172,  p \u2009<\u20090.001; Wilks\u00b4\u03bb\u2009=\u20090.332; partial \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.307. Tukey post-hoc tests showed that for SVA, MLD 3,  and OA, all comparisons of Hannover categories with each other showed statistically significant differences ( p \u2009<\u20090.001). Challenging cases for measurement techniques and classification systems Due to the bilateral presence, the different bilateral tumor sizes, the often presence of adjacent collision tumors, which are not always clearly separable from each other, and surgically induced changes (opening of the internal auditory canal and partial intra- and extrameatal resection amounts), measurement conditions are difficult, especially for linear-based methods and classification systems. This often leads to shifts in the structures in the area of the internal auditory canal and the cerebellopontine angle. In addition, the growth directions could be different, which is challenging, particularly for the classification systems. Figures\u00a0 4  and  5  illustrate these difficulties. \n \n Fig. 4 Examples of difficult measurement conditions in NF2-associated VS. T1-weighted contrast-enhanced axial magnet resonance images (MRI) of different NF2 patients. Row a demonstrates different cases and challenges for 1D/3D measurement techniques and classification systems. Rows a and b are separated into three different cases in each column. Row c demonstrates an NF2 case in the follow-up between 2013, 2016, and 2021. Row d illustrates the NF2 case before (first image), after (second image), and postoperatively under Bevacizumab (third image). ( a ) A giant ipsilateral VS often leads to an overestimation in the contralateral side classification systems due to displacement of the anatomical structures (cerebellopontine cisterns, brainstem). For instance, a regularly classified T2 tumor changes into a T3b/T4a tumor due to a large contralateral VS with brainstem compression of the other side, as demonstrated in three different NF2 cases. Large tumors change the configuration and the anatomical conditions between the relevant structures: the internal auditory canal, cerebellopontine cisterns, brainstem, and fourth ventricle. Highly subdivided classification systems, such as the Hannover classification, reach their limits here and are then dependent on the investigator. ( b ) Adjacent collision tumors are frequently found in severely affected NF2 patients throughout the disease and represent a challenge not only for the measurement techniques but also in their differentiation from VS and the subsequent therapy. In the case of collision tumors, meningiomas and adjacent non-vestibular schwannomas cannot always be entirely radiologically differentiated from the VS, and it is not uncommon for a smooth transition to occur. Semiautomatic volumetry has difficulty considering adjacent tumors, so such cases often must be performed entirely by hand. ( c ) Different growth directions also lead to anatomical shifts and make it challenging to classify sizes using classifications as demonstrated in an NF2 case under observation during the period (from left to right) 2013, 2016 to 2021 with a dorsal growth direction on the left side. ( d ) Cystic/regressive tumor components can occur spontaneously (first two images) and in response to Bevacizumab (last image). The first demonstrated case was operated on an expansive and rapidly growing tumor cyst on the left side. Under hearing preserving criteria, the solid tumor parts could be just marginally resected. Therefore, the solid tumor size did not change in its volume. The question is whether cysts should be considered in tumor volumetry, especially in monitoring bevacizumab therapy. They usually represent an excellent response to Bevacizumab and should not be regarded as volume addition in 3D volumetry. This naturally makes SVA more complex, and linear-based measurements cannot consider such changes if they occur centrally in the tumor and not in peripheral areas. \n \n Fig. 5 Exemplary cases of surgically induced anatomical changes and limits of the classification systems. T1-weighted contrast-enhanced axial magnet resonance images (MRI) of different NF2 patients. Two (cases a and b) other and operated NF2-associated vestibular schwannoma (VS) cases. The left column shows the preoperative, and the right column shows the postoperative images. ( a ) Bilateral VS, preoperative tumor size left-sided T4b/K4 and non-operated right-sided T3b/K3 VS. Surgery of the giant, left-sided VS (T4b/K4) VS was indicated and performed (regardless of hearing) due to displacement of the brainstem and fourth ventricle. A slight tumor residue had to be left to preserve the facial nerve function. The internal auditory canal (IAC) was also opened. According to Hannover, postoperative classification into T1/T2/T3a or Koos into K1/K2 is more complicated. The contralateral right side became a preoperative T4a to a \u201cpostoperative\u201d T3a due to the relief of the brain stem. The Koos grade K2 did not change due to surgery. ( b ) Bilaterally operated VS, preoperative tumor size right-sided T4b/K4 and left-sided T4a/K3. The relief of the brain stem resulted in an altered configuration of the posterior fossa with almost compensatory widening of the fourth ventricle. Due to this shift in the anatomy after partial resection of the large and the opening of the internal auditory canal, it is tough to classify tumors in classification systems on both sides. This case also shows the problem of the different tilting of the MRI diagnostics.",
  "discussion": "Conclusion Volume calculations based on an orthogonal analysis of the maximum diameter represent an excellent alternative to time-consuming segmented tumor volumetry. Nevertheless, these methods are subject to an enormous scatter range and percentage deviation from segmented (3D) volumetry, especially in the case of small tumor volumes that have been reduced natively or surgically. Classification systems are sufficient for categorizing tumors and assessing intra- and extrameatal extension but are not suitable for detailed monitoring of tumor volume. Avoiding deviations in volume determination is essential, especially for monitoring off-label treatment with bevacizumab or treatment decisions (e.g., timepoint of surgery) and postoperative surveillance predominantly in small (T1/2, K1/2) tumors, with adjacent collision tumors, or linear changes\u2009>\u20092\u00a0mm. Segmented volumetrics should remain the gold standard here despite the time required.",
