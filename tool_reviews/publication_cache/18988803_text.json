Our previous studies  have shown that cells with overactivation in the Ras pathway are more permissive  to infection with herpes simplex virus 1 and its mutant version R3616. In this  study, we show that among five different mouse MPNST cell lines, only the ones  with elevated levels of Ras signaling are highly permissive to infection with  oncolytic herpes G207. Specific inhibitors of the Ras, ERK, and JNK pathways all  reduced the synthesis of viral proteins in MPNST cells. The cell lines that  contained lower levels of Ras and decreased activation of downstream signaling  components underwent an enhancement in apoptosis upon exposure to G207.  Additionally, mouse SW10 Schwann cells were able to become infected by parental  herpes but were found to be resistant to G207. The immortalization of these cell  lines with the expression of SV40 large T antigen increased the levels of Ras  activation and permissiveness to oncolytic herpes. A Ras/Raf kinase inhibitor  reduced the synthesis of both herpes simplex virus-1 and G207 proteins in SW10  cells. The results of this study, therefore, introduce Ras signaling as a  divergent turning point for the response of MPNST cells to an assault by  oncolytic herpes.
