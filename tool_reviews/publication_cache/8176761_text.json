  "abstract": "Neurofibromin, the protein product of the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene, has two alternate isoforms which are generated by alternative splicing of two exons. One of these isoforms containing exon 48a is expressed at highest levels in muscle. Since neurofibromin is a p21-ras regulator and has been recently shown to be modulated during Schwann cell differentiation, we examined the expression of the NF1 gene product during in vitro muscle differentiation. Previous work demonstrated that C2C12 murine myoblast cell differentiation could be blocked by the introduction of an activated p21-ras protein. Using this model system, we demonstrate that differentiating C2C12 cells upregulate the expression of NF1 mRNA by 2 days of serum starvation concomitant with increased expression of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor mRNA. This upregulation of mRNA expression paralleled an increase in neurofibromin and N-ras levels, but no change in the relative abundance of the isoforms containing exon 23a or exon 48a was observed during in vitro myoblast differentiation. The increase in neurofibromin levels paralleled a decrease in the levels of activated p21-ras as assayed by in vivo 32P-orthophosphate incorporation into p21-ras. These results suggest that in vitro C2C12 cell differentiation is associated with a concomitant increase in NF1 gene expression and decrease in the proportion of activated p21-ras.",
