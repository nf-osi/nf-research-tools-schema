Cognitive impairments are a major clinical feature of the common neurogenetic  disease neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Previous studies have demonstrated that  increased neuronal inhibition underlies the learning deficits in NF1, however,  the molecular mechanism underlying this cell-type specificity has remained  unknown. Here, we identify an interneuron-specific attenuation of  hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) current as the cause  for increased inhibition in Nf1 mutants. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that  HCN1 is a novel NF1-interacting protein for which loss of NF1 results in a  concomitant increase of interneuron excitability. Furthermore, the HCN channel  agonist lamotrigine rescued the electrophysiological and cognitive deficits in  two independent Nf1 mouse models, thereby establishing the importance of HCN  channel dysfunction in NF1. Together, our results provide detailed mechanistic  insights into the pathophysiology of NF1-associated cognitive defects, and  identify a novel target for clinical drug development.
