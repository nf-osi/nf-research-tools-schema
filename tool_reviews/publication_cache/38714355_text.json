  "title": "MEK Inhibition Enhances the Antitumor Effect of Radiotherapy in NF1-Deficient Glioblastoma.",
  "abstract": "Individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1, an autosomal dominant neurogenetic and tumor predisposition syndrome, are susceptible to developing low-grade glioma and less commonly high-grade glioma. These gliomas exhibit loss of the neurofibromin gene [neurofibromin type 1 (NF1)], and 10% to 15% of sporadic high-grade gliomas have somatic NF1 alterations. Loss of NF1 leads to hyperactive RAS signaling, creating opportunity given the established efficacy of MEK inhibitors in plexiform neurofibromas and some individuals with low-grade glioma. We observed that NF1-deficient glioblastoma neurospheres were sensitive to the combination of an MEK inhibitor (mirdametinib) with irradiation, as evidenced by synergistic inhibition of cell growth, colony formation, and increased cell death. In contrast, NF1-intact neurospheres were not sensitive to the combination, despite complete ERK pathway inhibition. No neurosphere lines exhibited enhanced sensitivity to temozolomide combined with mirdametinib. Mirdametinib decreased transcription of homologous recombination genes and RAD51 foci, associated with DNA damage repair, in sensitive models. Heterotopic xenograft models displayed synergistic growth inhibition to mirdametinib combined with irradiation in NF1-deficient glioma xenografts but not in those with intact NF1. In sensitive models, benefits were observed at least 3 weeks beyond the completion of treatment, including sustained phosphor-ERK inhibition on immunoblot and decreased Ki-67 expression. These observations demonstrate synergistic activity between mirdametinib and irradiation in NF1-deficient glioma models and may have clinical implications for patients with gliomas that harbor germline or somatic NF1 alterations.",

  "methods": "Materials and Methods Cell Culture Conditions Human-derived glioblastoma neurosphere lines (HSR-GBM1, JHH-520, JHU-0879, JHU-1016B, JHH-136) with diverse  NF1  status were obtained and cultured in serum-free neurosphere media as previously described.( 18 ) The mutational profile of these glioblastoma neurosphere models has been previously characterized. Adherent high-grade glioma lines with BRAF V600E  alteration and varied  NF1  status (B76, NGT-41, NMCG-1, DBTRG) were obtained and grown in attached culture media with 10\u201315% serum as previously described.( 19 ) LN229 was obtained from ATCC, T98G was a gift from the Laterra laboratory, and both were cultured as recommended. All cell lines used in our study were verified by short-tandem repeat profiling for cell line authentication at Johns Hopkins University Core Facility, tested regularly for  Mycoplasma  contamination, and passaged  in vitro  for fewer than three months after resuscitation. Reagents Mirdametinib (also known as PD0325901) has the chemical structure of N-[(2R)-2,3 dihydroxypropoxyl]-3,4-difluro-2-[(2-fluoro-4-iodophenyl) amino] benzamide and was provided by SpringWorks Therapeutics.( 17 ) For  in vitro  experiments, mirdametinib was dissolved in DMSO as a 10mM stock, and stored in \u221220 \u00b0C. For  in vivo  experiments, mirdametinib was dissolved in citric buffer with 1 % hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose and 1% Tween with sonication. Cell Growth Assays Cell lines were infected with NucLight red lentivirus and stably selected in puromycin. Successful insertion of the nuclear-restricted RFP was confirmed via fluorescence microscopy of stably infected cells. Cell growth was evaluated using an IncuCyte S3 live Imager by monitoring area of red nuclei every four hours, or the Cell Counting kit-8 (Dojindo) and read using a microplate spectrophotometer (Epotech) as described. For all growth assays, 1.5\u20133\u2009\u00d7\u200910 3  cells/well were plated in 96-wells plates and treated 24 hours after plating with the described conditions. Relative survival in the presence of drug was normalized to untreated controls after background subtraction. Synergy was calculated using the web-based SynergyFinder to analyze drug combination dose\u2013response matrix data. To determine whether the drugs showed a combinatorial or additive effect, a Synergy Score was calculated to characterize the strength of synergistic interaction.( 20 , 21 ) For all experiments at least three independent replicates were performed. Soft-agar assay was performed as described previously.( 22 ) Briefly, 100 to 150 \u00d7\u200910 3  cells were mixed with 1% agar treated with either DMSO or mirdametinib (10 or 30 nM) and plated over a base layer in 6-well plates. Plates were radiated as described and incubated at 37\u2009\u00b0C for three weeks with media changes and drug repletion one to two times weekly. Colonies were stained with crystal violet for one hour and imaged via ChemiDoc Touch Imaging System (Bio-Rad). The measurements were based on three replicates for each condition and each experiment was repeated at least three times. Images captured within a single experiment were taken at the same magnification and exposure time. Data were analyzed using ImageJ. Immunoblotting Cells were prepared and processed as previously described.( 23 ) Briefly, cells were disrupted on ice in NP40 lysis buffer. Protein concentration was determined with Pierce BCA protein assay kit (#23227, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, immunoblotted with specific primary and secondary antibodies, and detected by chemiluminescence with the ECL detection reagents, Immobilon Western chemiluminescent HRP substrate (#WBKLS0500, Millipore), or Pierce ECL Western blotting substrate (#32106, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The membranes were imaged using ChemiDoc touch imaging system (Bio-Rad). Representative blots of three to four independent experiments are shown. Antibodies against total ERK, phospho-ERKthr202/tyr204, phospho-MEKser217/221, cleaved PARP, RAD51, BRCA2 and GAPDH were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. NF1 (A300\u2013140A) was obtained from Bethyl. MGMT (sc-166528) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Real-time PCR RNA was extracted from treated cells and reverse transcription performed as previously described( 22 ). qPCR was performed using the Promega 2-step kit on a CFX96 Real-Time PCR System (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Three independent experiments (with biological triplicate) were completed for each condition using previously published primers for RAD51, BRCA2 and GAPDH( 24 ). Values were normalized to the housekeeping gene GAPDH using the \u0394\u0394CT method ( 25 ). Flow Cytometry Cells were plated in 6-well plates, irradiated the same day and treated immediately afterwards with mirdametinib. Cells were collected after 72 hours and fixed with 70% ethanol. They were stained with Propidium Iodine (PI/RNase staining- Cell Signaling Technologies), then sorted using a FACS Celeste machine. For Annexin V staining, cells were harvested and resuspended in PBS, then treated with Annexin V, Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (Invitrogen 2413465) and Propidium Iodide prior to flow cytometry. Results were analyzed using the FlowJo software. Immunofluorescence Cells were grown in chamber slides (Lab Tek II, Chamber Slide cat. No. 154534) before fixation (4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 minutes) and permeabilization (0,2% Triton X-100 in PBS). Cells were blocked with goat serum for 2 hours at room temperature and incubated with RAD51(1:500 no. ab133534 Abcam) or yH2AX (1:200 no. 05\u2013636, Millipore) antibody overnight at 4 \u00b0C and then with secondary antibody (1:1000 goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 or 1:2000 goat anti rabbit Alexa Fluor 647) and DAPI (Thermo Fisher). Image acquisition was performed with a confocal microscope (LEICA SP8 Confocal Microscope). Immunohistochemistry Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed at Johns Hopkins IHC core facility. IHC for Ki-67 and pERK was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections on a Ventana Discovery Ultra autostainer (Roche Diagnostics) using a protocol described previously.( 26 ) Ki-67 quantification and image analysis was performed with Qupath to score Ki-67 in tumor tissue for a cohort of nine slices per condition. Radiation therapy Cells were plated in 96 well plates and irradiated with 0\u201310 Gy using a GammaCell irradiator with a  137 Cs source at 50 cGy/min. For  in vivo  experiments, mice were treated using the Small Animal Radiation Research Platform (SARRP), which was able to target the tumor tissue as appropriate.( 27 )The tumors were irradiated with a circular beam of 1-cm diameter with three consecutive daily fractions of 2 Gy each. Animal Experiments and Ethics Statement NOD scid gamma (NSG) female and male mice were purchased from Johns Hopkins University Animal Resources Core. All mouse experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Johns Hopkins under protocol # MO21M387. Glioblastoma neurosphere lines were implanted subcutaneously or intracranially in 6 to 8 week-old NSG mice as described.( 28 ) For heterotopic models, 5 mice per arm received bilateral flank implants. Drug treatment was started when tumor size reached roughly 50\u2013200 mm 3 , at which time mice were randomized into groups and treated accordingly. Mirdametinib 1.5 mg/kg, was administrated by oral gavage twice daily, based on mean group body weight, with treatment schedule of 7 days on/0 days off. Irradiation was administered in 3 daily fractions of 2 Gy. Tumors were measured twice weekly by caliper in two dimensions, and tumor volume was calculated by: W x L 2  where L is the longest diameter and W is the width. In orthotopic experiments, 10 mice were used per arm for 80% power to detect a 2.5 week increase in survival, and drug treatment was initiated after the detection of tumors on MRI, occurring approximately one month post-implantation. Mice were treated for 28 days and monitored closely for toxicity and signs of tumor growth or neurological impairment. Tumors were extracted, photographed, and fixed in formalin. Data analysis and Statistical Methods Graphing, IC50 calculations, and statistical analysis were performed using GraphPad Prism, version 7. ANOVA or multiple t tests were used to evaluate difference between conditions. Data Availability The data generated by the authors are available upon request to the corresponding author.

  "introduction": "Introduction The mainstay of therapy for glioblastoma in adults for almost 20 years has been maximal safe surgical resection followed by radiation with concurrent oral alkylating chemotherapy, temozolomide (TMZ), but this regimen is modestly effective at best.( 1 ) In the 40% of patients whose tumors are deficient for O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT promoter is methylated), median survival improves to approximately 23 months;( 2 ) however in patients whose tumors are MGMT unmethylated, median survival remains less than 18 months.( 3 ) Detailed genomic characterization of glioblastoma has led to a deeper understanding of prognostic and predictive alterations, reflected in the most recent WHO Brain Tumor Classification.( 4 ) Despite these breakthroughs, our ability to exploit oncogenic genomic alterations remains limited, with many negative clinical trials over that time.( 5 ) RAS pathway activation has proven to be critical for glioblastoma cellular growth, as approximately 80% of all glioblastomas have genomic alterations that dysregulate this pathway, either through oncogenic activating mutations (e.g., EGFRvIII, BRAF V600E ), or through loss of tumor suppressors ( PTEN, TP53, NF1 ). Despite promising preclinical data, clinical trials of targeted therapies against EGFR, mTOR, PI3K and other commonly altered targets have been unsuccessful in improving overall survival in patients with glioblastoma.( 6 , 7 ) Even with demonstrable target inhibition in human subjects, development has been limited by both suboptimal antitumor efficacy, intratumoral heterogeneity, and toxicity.( 8 ) One class of targeted therapies that has demonstrated efficacy in glioma with  NF1  or  BRAF  alterations is MEK inhibitors. MEK inhibition alone, however, is insufficient for sustained efficacy in sporadic glioblastoma.( 9 \u2013 11 ) One approach to augment efficacy may be to identify therapeutic agents that synergize with current FDA-approved therapies (radiation or TMZ) potentially by augmenting DNA damage or preventing repair. DNA damage induced by radiation can be repaired via non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway or homologous recombination (HR), which is primarily involved in the repair of secondary double strand breaks (DSBs) that occur during S phase following radiation, when the replication fork collapses at unresolved single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) lesions.( 12 ) Both NHEJ and HR are executed through multistep reactions essential for repairing the DNA damage successfully. ERK signaling is critical for maintaining DNA damage repair pathways in many cancers.( 13 \u2013 16 ) Specifically, these pathways regulate RAD51 expression, along with other proteins essential to HR, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2. Inhibition of ERK signaling with a MEK inhibitor suppresses the transcription of HR pathway genes in melanoma cell lines and renders cells susceptible to therapies that induce DSBs.( 14 ) To assess the role of ERK signaling on HR activity in glioblastoma we evaluate the effect of combined MEK inhibition (using the MEK inhibitor, mirdametinib ( 17 ) with cytotoxic therapy (radiation or TMZ) in a panel of glioblastoma neurospheres with genomic alterations conferring ERK dependence, specifically  NF1  loss or BRAF V600E  mutations, versus those without ERK dependence. Our findings demonstrate cooperative activity between MEKi and radiation in glioblastoma models, both  in vitro  and  in vivo , with potential implications for human clinical trials.",
  "results": "Results MEK inhibition suppresses HR pathway activity in NF1-deficient glioblastoma. We began by determining ERK-dependence in our cell line models based on the presence of genomic alterations in the ERK signaling cascade ( NF1  loss or  BRAF  alteration) as well as dose-dependent growth inhibition to the small molecule allosteric MEK1/2 inhibitor, mirdametinib ( 17 ) (also known as PD0325901; MEKi), at physiologically relevant doses. We compared existing genomic alterations for all lines and  NF1  expression status determined by immunoblot. Based on integrated analysis, we identified two lines as  NF1  intact (HSR-GBM1, JHU-0879), three as  NF1  deficient (JHH-136, JHH-520, JHH-1016B), three having BRAF V600E  with intact  NF1  (B76, DBTRG, NMCG1) and one having BRAF V600E  and deficient  NF1  (NGT41;  Fig. 1A ) Serum-free neurosphere and adherent glioblastoma cell lines were all treated with a dose range of MEKi. Glioblastoma models exhibited varied sensitivity to MEKi, with highest sensitivity in those with loss of  NF1  or BRAF V600E  alterations\u2014consistent with an ERK-dependent phenotype and little growth inhibition in those with intact  NF1  and BRAF, despite adequate inhibition of ERK activity (phospho-ERK) in all cell lines, as previously reported ( Fig. 1B \u2013 D ).( 29 ) Given prior reports of ERK-dependent regulation of homologous recombination (HR) we sought to evaluate the putative relationship in glioblastoma.( 30 )We quantified expression of  BRCA2  and  RAD51  mRNA, two genes critical for HR, in cells treated with DMSO or MEKi. We observed decreased transcription of both genes following 24 hours of treatment with MEKi in neurosphere lines with  NF1  deficiency, though not in those with intact  NF1  ( Fig 1E \u2013 F ). We observed decreased BRCA2 protein expression ( Fig. 1G ), and fewer RAD51 nuclear foci following MEKi therapy as compared with vehicle in an  NF1 -deficient adherent glioblastoma line, consistent with ERK-dependent regulation of HRD ( Fig 1H \u2013 I ). MEK inhibition sensitizes glioblastoma with loss of  NF1  to radiation. We next evaluated whether mirdametinib would sensitize glioblastomas to standard treatments by impairing DNA repair. The effect of a single fraction of radiation on cell growth was evaluated and we observed dose-dependent inhibition and cell death in all cell lines. We identified 5 Gy as the dose with modest biological effect but incomplete cell killing across all neurosphere lines ( Fig. 2A ,  B ), akin to the state in human patients with glioblastoma treated with radiotherapy in whom cancer recurs over time. We additionally evaluated sensitivity to temozolomide (TMZ) monotherapy in our lines ( Fig. 2C ), which in glioblastoma is predicted by MGMT expression.( 31 ) As expected, lack of MGMT expression (HSR-GBM1, JHH-520, JHU-1016B) conveyed sensitivity to TMZ, while intact MGMT expression was associated with resistance (JHU-0879 and JHH-136;  Fig. 2D ). We assessed the effect of combining MEKi therapy with irradiation. Across all  NF1 -deficient neurospheres, but not  NF1 -intact lines, we observed decreased cell growth and sphere formation in response to combined therapy ( Fig. 3A ). Adherent cell lines with BRAF V600E  or  NF1 -deficiency also displayed additive or synergistic response to MEKi combined with radiation ( Fig. 3B ). Additive effects were not observed for  NF1 -intact neurospheres or adherent cell lines. ( Fig. 3C ,  D ). We evaluated the effect of combined therapy on the clonogenic potential of glioblastoma stem cells using a soft agar colony-forming assay and observed decreased sphere formation with combined treatment compared to either monotherapy in  NF1 -deficient but not  NF1 -intact neurospheres ( Fig. 3E ,  F ). To further characterize the effect of combined treatment, we investigated the effect on cell cycle progression. In  NF1 -deficient neurospheres, the combination of MEKi and radiation produced a higher sub-G1 population and increased cell death, along with decreased populations in S and G2 phases ( Fig. 4A ). This effect was not observed in  NF1 -intact neurospheres treated with the combination.  NF1- deficient neurospheres also demonstrated increased apoptosis in response to combined therapy as compared with either monotherapy when measured by Annexin V ( Fig. 4B ,  C ). We evaluated the effect of combined therapy on HR protein expression. The number of RAD51 foci decreased with MEKi treatment in  NF1 -deficient cells, irrespective of whether radiation had occurred, suggesting decreased capacity for DNA damage repair using the HR pathway. In both  NF1 -intact and deficient lines, radiation resulted in increased DNA double-strand damage as quantified by \u03b3H2AX ( Fig. 4D ,  E ). Effectiveness of radiation and MEKi in  in vivo  models of  NF1- deficient glioblastoma. Given the synergistic combination of MEKi, mirdametinib, with irradiation  in vitro,  we evaluated the effect of combined therapy in heterotopic xenograft models ( Fig. 5 ). We observed a transient increase in the volume of tumors treated with radiation monotherapy that subsided within three weeks, consistent with transient inflammation.  NF1 -deficient heterotopic xenografts (JHH-520 and JHH-136) exhibited decreased growth ( Fig. 5A ,  C ) in response to combined treatment as compared to monotherapy. This was true whether MEKi was administered simultaneously with irradiation or following the completion of radiation, but the benefit was most durable in mice treated concurrently, persisting for at least four weeks following the completion of treatment. The combination failed to demonstrate a benefit in  NF1 -intact xenografts ( Fig. 5B ). Immunoblot from  NF1 -deficient tumors obtained following the last treatment confirmed ongoing suppression of ERK phosphorylation in arms with MEKi ( Fig. 5D ), demonstrating that phospho-ERK suppression alone is insufficient to durably inhibit tumor growth. Histopathologic analysis of tumor tissue from individual mice collected 28 days after the start of treatment confirmed a significant decrease in proliferation (Ki-67) in the combination arm, and decreased p-ERK in both conditions treated with MEKi ( Fig. 5E \u2013 G ). When evaluated in an intracranial model of glioblastoma, similar results were observed. The combination of radiation therapy with MEKi resulted in significantly improved survival in two different orthothopic models ( Fig. 5H ,  I ). Together, these findings support the observation that MEKi potentiates the effect of radiation in  NF1- deficient glioblastoma, improving durability of treatment. MEKi does not potentiate temozolomide efficacy in glioblastoma models. Given its role as standard therapy for glioblastoma, we evaluated the combination of TMZ with MEKi ( Fig 6 ). TMZ functions by adding methyl groups (alkylation) to guanine or adenine, causing missense substitutions during DNA replication and creating mismatched base pairs. ( 32 ) This effect triggers mismatch repair and base excision repair mechanisms for DNA damage repair, rather than homologous recombination. We hypothesized that there would be no synergy between TMZ and MEKi given DNA repair from TMZ functions independently of HR ( Fig. 6 ). We evaluated the combination of TMZ with MEKi but did not observe any synergistic effect on cell growth inhibition or cell death in any neurosphere lines ( Fig. 6A ). Furthermore, histopathologic analysis of tumor tissue from individual mice collected 28 days after the start of treatment showed no difference in proliferation with MEKi alone (Ki-67;  Fig. 6E ). Lastly, we evaluated the addition of MEKi to radiation and TMZ, the standard first-line therapy for glioblastoma. We observed a combinatorial effect of radiation with MEKi, but no enhanced growth inhibition or increased cell death with the addition of temozolomide ( Fig. 6B \u2013 D ). This observation extended to heterotopic xenograft models, where MEKi with radiation was equivalent or superior to every other pairwise combination ( Fig. 6F ). Interestingly in  NF1  cell lines, apoptotic markers such as cleaved PARP demonstrated more induction for the combination of radiation with MEKi over any other combination, including the addition of TMZ or TMZ with radiation alone ( \u2212/\u2212 Fig. 6C ,  D ).",
  "discussion": "Discussion Radiation therapy is a cornerstone of glioblastoma treatment and plays a critical role in controlling tumor growth. Combined with oral TMZ chemotherapy, it comprises first line therapy for glioblastoma and other high-grade gliomas in adults. Unfortunately, glioblastoma cells can overcome the effects of standard treatment, which is focused on inflicting catastrophic DNA damage, through aberrant DNA repair mechanisms and cell-cycle regulation. Here, we demonstrate that  NF1 -deficient glioblastoma lines are ERK-dependent, with partial growth sensitivity to MEKi monotherapy. They also exhibit ERK-dependent expression of the homologous recombination DNA repair pathway, where MEKi creates a transient homologous recombination deficiency (HRD)-like state in NF1-deficient cells. This vulnerability is exploitable by treating with MEKi and radiotherapy, effecting enhanced growth inhibition and cell death both  in vitro  and  in vivo.  These findings have potential clinical implications for sporadic glioblastoma with  NF1  loss, as well as for patients with high-grade glioma in the background of neurofibromatosis type 1. Genomic alterations conferring HRD are well known to confer increased radiosensitivity. Mutations in  BRCA1  or  BRCA2  represent examples of classic cancer-associated DNA repair defects, conferring therapeutic susceptibility to agents that stall replication forks and induce double-strand DNA breaks. ( 33 ) These breaks are typically repaired via the NHEJ or HR pathways.( 34 ) Moreover, alterations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase gene (IDH1/2) occur in glioma, conferring an HR deficient state and increased sensitivity to radiotherapy in patients.( 35 ) Here, we demonstrate that  NF1 -deficient glioblastomas exhibit HRD due to decreased transcription following treatment with MEKi, which in turn confers enhanced sensitivity to irradiation. The overall effect is accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage leading to apoptosis. The dependence of HR expression on ERK signaling appears to be unique to glioblastoma with loss of  NF1  or BRAF V600E  alterations, suggesting an ERK-dependent phenotype. This is consistent with prior observations that melanoma and other cancers with RAS-dependence (due to  BRAF ,  NF1 , or  NRAS  alterations) demonstrate ERK-dependent HR, creating an exploitable vulnerability.( 36 ) Our preclinical experimentation was conducted using a combination of  NF1 -deficient and  NF1 -intact glioblastoma models derived from sporadic glioblastoma in adult patients. Low-grade glioma, particularly optic pathway glioma, is quite common in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1, heterozygous germline loss of neurofibromin type 1). LGG in patients with NF1 respond to MEKi alone, and even the occasional HGG may respond as well ( 37 \u2013 39 ). However, there is no standard treatment for HGG in patients with NF1 and radiation is often incorporated into therapy. In patients with sporadic glioblastoma, on the other hand, mono or bi-allelic alterations in  NF1  lead to loss of protein expression or function in ~15%.( 40 ) We expect the findings of this study, conducted in sporadic glioblastoma models, are also relevant for HGG from patients with NF1, but this hypothesis will need to be confirmed in future studies. Attempts to combine radiation with molecularly targeted therapies in the past have been ineffective in glioblastoma. There have been several clinical trials evaluating the combination of EGFR inhibitors and radiation, but most of them were phase I studies focused on dose-finding and safety rather than efficacy.( 41 ) Importantly, in none of the studies did a significant safety signal emerge, indicating that the addition of a small molecule inhibitor to radiation was not more dangerous for patients.( 42 , 43 ) One significant obstacle has been the blood-brain barrier, which is impervious to most chemotherapies and small molecule inhibitors, including most EGFR inhibitors. MEK inhibitors, conversely, have proven blood-brain barrier penetration as evidenced by significant tumor responses pediatric low-grade glioma,( 44 ) resulting in FDA-approval of two different MEKi, either alone or in combination with a BRAF inhibitor. Mirdametinib, a brain-penetrant, high selective allosteric MEK1/2 inhibitor, is currently undergoing clinical trial evaluation in patients with pediatric LGG ( NCT04923126 ) ( 45 , 46 ). We did not observe any enhanced efficacy for the combination of TMZ with MEKi. This limitation is likely due to the fact that TMZ induces the formation of mismatched base pairs, which are detected and processed by mismatch repair (MMR) enzymes ( 47 ), rather than HR. Because this is a different repair mechanism, the addition of the MEKi mirdametinib to TMZ did not demonstrate any synergy in our models. These findings are in agreement with groups that have previously evaluated this combination, showing no further benefit to the addition of MEKi to TMZ ( 48 , 49 ). In conclusion, we have demonstrated that MEKi blocks HR in  NF1 -deficient glioblastoma resulting in synergy with radiation in a cohort of glioblastoma neurosphere lines and  in vivo  models. While confirmation in orthotopic xenografts is needed for further validation, these observations have potentially important implications for patients with NF-1 associated glioma, as well as for those with  NF1- deficient sporadic glioblastoma.",
