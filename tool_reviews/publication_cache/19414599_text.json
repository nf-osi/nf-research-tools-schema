Ras leads an important signaling pathway that is deregulated in  neurofibromatosis type 1 and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). In  this study, we show that overactivation of Ras and many of its downstream  effectors occurred in only a fraction of MPNST cell lines. RalA, however, was  overactivated in all MPNST cells and tumor samples compared to nontransformed  Schwann cells. Silencing Ral or inhibiting it with a dominant-negative Ral (Ral  S28N) caused a significant reduction in proliferation, invasiveness, and in vivo  tumorigenicity of MPNST cells. Silencing Ral also reduced the expression of  epithelial mesenchymal transition markers. Expression of the NF1-GTPase-related  domain (NF1-GRD) diminished the levels of Ral activation, implicating a role for  neurofibromin in regulating RalA activation. NF1-GRD treatment caused a  significant decrease in proliferation, invasiveness, and cell cycle progression,  but cell death increased. We propose Ral overactivation as a novel cell  signaling abnormality in MPNST that leads to important biological outcomes with  translational ramifications.
