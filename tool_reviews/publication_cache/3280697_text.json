Aronson PJ(1), Ito K, Fukaya T, Hashimoto K, Mehregan AH.  Author information: (1)Department of Dermatology and Syphilology, Wayne State University School of  Medicine, Detroit, Michigan 48201.  The mouse monoclonal antibody AFH1 was produced using formalin-fixed, sham  paraffin-embedded human melanoma cell culture line A375 as immunogen. Reactivity  of this antibody was assessed by immunohistochemical techniques against  formalin- or acid alcohol-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue as well as formalin- or  acid alcohol-fixed unembedded lesions. Ninety-seven nevomelanocytic lesions,  neurofibromas, epithelial lesions, and a plasmacellular infiltrate were  evaluated. AFH1 was immunoreactive on 54 of 55 nevocytic lesions (98.2%), 15 of  16 primary melanomas (93.7%), a lentigo maligna, and nests in 21 of 21  dysplastic nevi (100%). Of 100 consecutive basal melanocytes of intraepidermal  melanoma cells counted in each lesion, mean AFH1 immunoreactivity for nonnested  basal melanocytes in nevocellular nevi was 3.8%; for dysplastic nevi, 13.8%; and  for intraepidermal melanoma cells, 78.0%. When nonnested basal melanocytes were  subdivided into cytologically normal and abnormal cell groups, AFH1  immunoreactivity was 9.4% and 72.6%, respectively. AFH1 recognition of the  lentiginous portion of dysplastic nevi corresponds statistically to the  appearance of abnormal melanocyte cytology, nest formation, or both. Using 50%  immunoreactive nonnested melanocytes as the criterion, AFH1 seems to distinguish  primary melanoma from dysplastic nevi with a sensitivity of 93.8% and a  specificity of 95.8%.
