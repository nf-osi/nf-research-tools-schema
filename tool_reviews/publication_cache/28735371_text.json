Children and adolescents with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are at increased  risk for wide-ranging behavioral, developmental, and cognitive impairments and  decreased quality of life. To date, no psychosocial screening tool has been  developed to quickly assess the symptoms that 1) can be addressed during routine  medical appointments in children with NF1, 2) can produce interpretable and  actionable results, 3) can be integrated into medical care, and 4) can quickly  identify patients at risk in order to better address that the provision of  appropriate care are available. This study was conducted to test the overall  usability of the Distress Thermometer (DT) and symptom checklist and concordance  of DT ratings between pediatric patients, their caregivers and medical  providers. Eighty youth (ages 7-21) living with NF1 completed the DT and an  accompanying checklist. The findings of this study suggest the DT and symptom  checklist was acceptable and feasible to complete in a clinic setting. A small  subset reported high distress that required further assessment and intervention.  Significant discordance between distress ratings of caregivers and children and  healthcare providers was also found. Overall, the DT and accompanying symptom  checklist provide important information to identify the presence of distress and  contextualize the child's distress but is limited by not assessing whether these  symptoms interfere with the child's daily life.
