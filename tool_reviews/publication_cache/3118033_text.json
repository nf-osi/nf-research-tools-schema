Author information: (1)Department of Medicine Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina  27710.  Peripheral neurofibromatosis (NF) is one of the most common major genetic  disorders in man. Its chromosomal location is unknown and questions regarding  such factors as genetic heterogeneity remain unanswered. We have ascertained and  sampled several large multi-generation families for linkage studies including  one family of 66 subjects, 28 of whom were affected with NF. Recombinant DNA  studies of several restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) including  C3, ApoC2, pBam34 (D19S6], HAUP[APRT], pE40-1 [D11521], Hp[Hp2 alpha], LDR92,  and LDR111 failed to show a significant linkage (Z [lod score] greater than or  equal to 3.00) in this family. In addition, the results excluded areas of the  genome around the marker loci (Z greater than or equal to - 2.00) as potential  sites for linkage. The maximum Z obtained with the markers was for Hp at theta  (maximum recombination fraction) = 0.20 and Z = 0.399. We are now in the process  of screening additional RFLPs and families for linkage to NF.  DOI: 10.1136/jmg.24.9.530 PMCID: PMC1050260 PMID: 3118033 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",
