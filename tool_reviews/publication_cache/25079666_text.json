Author information: (1)Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck, University of Iowa Hospitals and  Clinics. (2)Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck, University of Iowa Hospitals and  Clinics; marlan-hansen@uiowa.edu.  Vestibular schwannomas (VSs) represent Schwann cell (SC) tumors of the  vestibular nerve, compromising 10% of all intracranial neoplasms. VSs occur in  either sporadic or familial (neurofibromatosis type 2, NF2) forms, both  associated with inactivating defects in the NF2 tumor suppressor gene. Treatment  for VSs is generally surgical resection or radiosurgery, however the morbidity  of such procedures has driven investigations into less invasive treatments.  Historically, lack of access to fresh tissue specimens and the fact that  schwannoma cells are not immortalized have significantly hampered the use of  primary cultures for investigation of schwannoma tumorigenesis. To overcome the  limited supply of primary cultures, the immortalized HEI193 VS cell line was  generated by transduction with HPV E6 and E7 oncogenes. This oncogenic  transduction introduced significant molecular and phenotypic alterations to the  cells, which limit their use as a model for human schwannoma tumors. We  therefore illustrate a simplified, reproducible protocol for culture of primary  human VS cells. This easily mastered technique allows for molecular and cellular  investigations that more accurately recapitulate the complexity of VS disease.
