Comment in     Future Oncol. 2010 Apr;6(4):499-501. doi: 10.2217/fon.10.29.  Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) carry approximately a 10% lifetime  risk of developing a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). Although  the molecular mechanisms underlying NF1 to MPNST malignant transformation remain  unclear, alterations of both the RAS/RAF/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling  pathways have been implicated. In a series of genetically engineered murine  models, we perturbed RAS/RAF/MAPK or/and PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway, individually or  simultaneously, via conditional activation of K-ras oncogene or deletion of Nf1  or Pten tumor suppressor genes. Only K-Ras activation in combination with a  single Pten allele deletion led to 100% penetrable development of NF lesions and  subsequent progression to MPNST. Importantly, loss or decrease in PTEN  expression was found in all murine MPNSTs and a majority of human NF1-associated  MPNST lesions, suggesting that PTEN dosage and its controlled signaling pathways  are critical for transformation of NFs to MPNST. Using noninvasive in vivo  PET-CT imaging, we demonstrated that FDG can be used to identify the malignant  transformation in both murine and human MPNSTs. Our data suggest that combined  inhibition of RAS/RAF/MAPK and PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathways may be beneficial for  patients with MPNST.
