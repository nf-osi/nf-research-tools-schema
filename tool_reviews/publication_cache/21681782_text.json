  "abstract": "Nf1 mutant mice with p19ARF gene loss develop accelerated hematopoietic disease  resembling acute leukemia with a variable phenotype.  Wiesner SM(1), Geurts JL, Diers MD, Bergerson RJ, Hasz DE, Morgan KJ,  Largaespada DA.  Author information: (1)Center for Allied Health Programs, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis,  55455, USA.  Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia (JMML) is a relentlessly progressive  myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic (MPD/MDS) hematopoietic disorder more common  in patients with any one of at least three distinct genetic lesions,  specifically NF1 gene loss and PTPN11 and NRAS mutations. NF1 and PTPN11 are  molecular lesions associated with Neurofibromatosis Syndrome Type I (NF1  Syndrome) and Noonan's Syndrome, respectively. The occurrence of JMML is rare;  even among those predisposed with these syndromes to development of disease, and  secondary genetic events likely contribute to the development and progression of  disease. In NF1 syndrome, loss of p53 function is a common event in solid  tumors, but uncommon in JMML, suggesting that the p53 pathway may be modified by  other events in this hematopoietic disorder. The work presented here  investigates the possible role of the p19(Arf) (p19) tumor suppressor in  development of MPD associated with Nf1 gene loss in mice. We find that Nf1  mutant hematopoietic cells with loss of p19 develop accelerated hematopoietic  disease similar to acute leukemia with a variable phenotype. This suggests that  p19 may play a role in development of JMML and evaluation of the human p19  homolog (p14(ARF)) in JMML may be informative.  Copyright © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
