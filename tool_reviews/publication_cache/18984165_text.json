  "title": "Neurofibromin regulation of ERK signaling modulates GABA release and learning.",
  "abstract": "We uncovered a role for ERK signaling in GABA release, long-term potentiation (LTP), and learning, and show that disruption of this mechanism accounts for the learning deficits in a mouse model for learning disabilities in neurofibromatosis type I (NF1). Our results demonstrate that neurofibromin modulates ERK/synapsin I-dependent GABA release, which in turn modulates hippocampal LTP and learning. An Nf1 heterozygous null mutation, which results in enhanced ERK and synapsin I phosphorylation, increased GABA release in the hippocampus, and this was reversed by pharmacological downregulation of ERK signaling. Importantly, the learning deficits associated with the Nf1 mutation were rescued by a subthreshold dose of a GABA(A) antagonist. Accordingly, Cre deletions of Nf1 showed that only those deletions involving inhibitory neurons caused hippocampal inhibition, LTP, and learning abnormalities. Importantly, our results also revealed lasting increases in GABA release triggered by learning, indicating that the mechanisms uncovered here are of general importance for learning.",

In this paper, we used 3\u20136 month old males and females. Studies with  Nf1 +/\u2212  mice were performed in 129T2/SvEmsJ-C57BL/6 F1 hybrids generated. WT littermates were used as controls. The mice with Cre-mediated deletions of the  Nf1  gene ( Nf1 ;  Dlx5/6+/\u2212 Nf1   syn I+/\u2212 Nf1 ;  CamkII +/\u2212 Nf1 ) were F1 progeny from a cross between the  GFAP+/\u2212 Nf1  and the cell-type specific Cre mice ( floxed/+ synapsin 1-Cre, GFAP-Cre, \u03b1CaMKII-Cre , and  Dlx5/6-Cre . The four lines with Cre-deletions of the  Nf1  gene (and their controls)were all in 129T2/SvEmsJ-C57BL/6 F1 hybrid genetic background. Since the 4 different  Nf1  lines share the same genetic background (all in 129T2/SvEmsJ-C57BL/6 F1 hybrids background), in some experiments we combined WT and  Cre+/\u2212 Nf1  littermates of different conditional mutant lines. The  floxed/+ Nf1  mice were F2 progeny of the  Cre\u2212/\u2212 Nf1  mice. Mice genotype were determined by PCR analysis of tail DNA samples as described before. All experiments were carried out with researchers blind to the genotype of the animals tested. Cre+/\u2212 Western Blot Analysis Immunoblot analyses were performed as described previously (( Elgersma et al., 2002 ). In  Figure 4  and  Figure 6S , tissue was collected 30 min after behavioral training. The primary antibodies used were against NF1 (1:300; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); phospho-ERK p42/p44 and total ERK p42/p44 (1:1,000; NEB); \u03b2-actin (1:5,000; Sigma); synapsin I (1:1000; NEB); phospho-synapsin I is a gift from P. Greengard (Rockefeller University, New York, NY). Blots were quantitated using ECL +  and the Storm 860 phosphorimager system (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Immunohistochemistry Immunohistochemistry was performed using confocal microscopy as described previously ( Kushner, et al. 2005 ). The primary antibodies used were against phospho-Thr202/Tyr204 ERK p42/p44 (New England Biolabs), GAD65/67 (Chemicon). FITC donkey anti-rabbit, cyanine 3 (Cy3) donkey anti-mouse were used as secondary antibodies. Sections were analyzed with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser-scanning microscope using a 40\u00d7 numerical aperture objective. Neuronal quantification was performed by counting cellular FITC fluorescence and cellular Cy3 immunofluorescence. Behavioral analysis The Morris water maze apparatus and procedures were previously described( Costa et al., 2002 ). Mice were trained with two trials per day for 7 d (30 sec ITI). Probe trials were administered after 5 and 7 d after the completion of training. For the studies that looked at inhibition after water maze training, Mice were initially habituated for 7 days (2 mins handling and 5 mins swimming/day). Mice in the \u201c Learning group \u201d were spatial trained with 15 trials (5 min ITI). In each trial, mice were given 30 sec on a platform and another 60 sec to find the platform ( Figure. S9 ). Two mice were excluded from further analysis because of floating. Mice in the \u201c Swimming-only group \u201d spent on average the same time as the \u201c Learning group \u201d in the pool, but no platform was present. To avoid fatigue, training was divided into 5 sessions (4 min each) with 15 min ITI. Mice in the \u201c Cage-control group \u201d were sacrificed immediately after removal from the home cage. Mice from both the \u201c Learning \u201d and \u201c Swimming-only \u201d groups were sacrificed 60 min after the last session, and mIPSCs (see below) were recorded. In the visible version of water maze, mice were trained to search for a marked platform that were placed at a different location for 5 trials during 1 day (30 min ITI). The contextual fear conditioning apparatus was previously described( Anagnostaras et al., 2000 ). To avoid ceiling performances, mice were placed in a conditioning chamber for 40 sec after which they were given a foot-shock (0.40 mA, 2 sec). Mice were trained with one trial/day for 5 consecutive days. At each training day and 24 hours after the last training trial, the freezing levels were monitored for 30 seconds. All values are reported as mean\u00b1SEM. A two-way ANOVA with repeated measures was used to analyze the acquisition data from the water maze and freezing levels in the fear conditioning. A single-factor ANOVA was used to analyze the performance in the water maze probe on the percentage time in quadrant. A paired t-test were used to analyze the proximity data and crossing time. Electrophysiology Transverse hippocampal slices (400 \u00b5m thick) were maintained in a submerged recording chamber perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at 30\u00b0C. The ACSF contained the following (in mM): 120 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2.5 CaCl2, 1.3 MgSO4, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, and 10 D-glucose. Field EPSPs (fEPSPs) were recorded with a metallic electrode in CA1 stratum radiatum. The Schaffer collaterals were stimulated with 100-sec test pulses via a bipolar electrode. The intensity of stimulation was fixed at 60 mA. LTP was induced by a 5-theta-burst tetanus stimulation protocol (each burst consists of four pulses at 100 Hz with a 200-msec interburst interval). Responses from the last 10-min block of recordings were compared using ANOVA was used with Fisher\u2019s PLSD for post hoc comparisons. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings(reference mody)( Hajos et al., 2000 ) using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) or a 3900A Integrating Patch Clamp Amplifier (Dagan, Minneapolis, MN) were performed to measure sIPSCs, mIPSCs and mEPSCs. All recordings were made from the soma of visually identified CA1 pyramidal neurons. Patch electrodes (3\u20138 M when filled) were filled with a solution containing (in mM): 140 CsCl, 4 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 Hepes, 0.05 EGTA, 2 Mg-ATP, and 0.4 Mg-GTP. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were performed at -60-70 mV. Series resistance was compensated to 75\u201380%. Only recordings during which series resistance changed less than 25% through the whole experiment were analyzed. All recordings were low-pass filtered at 2 kHz and on-line digitized at 10 kHz using a PCI-MIO 16E-4 data acquisition board (National Instruments, Austin, TX). sIPSCs, mIPSCs and mEPSCs were measured using an in-house data acquisition and analysis software( Hajos et al., 2000 ). Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical comparisons of mEPSC data were performed using paired and unpaired t tests and ANOVA.",
