  "abstract": "Neurofibromin regulation of ERK signaling modulates GABA release and learning.  Cui Y(1), Costa RM, Murphy GG, Elgersma Y, Zhu Y, Gutmann DH, Parada LF, Mody I,  Silva AJ.  Author information: (1)Department of Neurobiology, Brain Research Institute, University of  California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.  We uncovered a role for ERK signaling in GABA release, long-term potentiation  (LTP), and learning, and show that disruption of this mechanism accounts for the  learning deficits in a mouse model for learning disabilities in  neurofibromatosis type I (NF1). Our results demonstrate that neurofibromin  modulates ERK/synapsin I-dependent GABA release, which in turn modulates  hippocampal LTP and learning. An Nf1 heterozygous null mutation, which results  in enhanced ERK and synapsin I phosphorylation, increased GABA release in the  hippocampus, and this was reversed by pharmacological downregulation of ERK  signaling. Importantly, the learning deficits associated with the Nf1 mutation  were rescued by a subthreshold dose of a GABA(A) antagonist. Accordingly, Cre  deletions of Nf1 showed that only those deletions involving inhibitory neurons  caused hippocampal inhibition, LTP, and learning abnormalities. Importantly, our  results also revealed lasting increases in GABA release triggered by learning,  indicating that the mechanisms uncovered here are of general importance for  learning.
