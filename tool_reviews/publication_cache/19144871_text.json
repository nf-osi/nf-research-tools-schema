Author information: (1)UIC Cancer Center, COMRB, Room 5099, 909 South Wolcott Avenue, Chicago, IL  60612-3725, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 2 is an inherited disorder characterized by the  development of benign and malignant tumors on the auditory nerves and central  nervous system with symptoms including hearing loss, poor balance, skin lesions,  and cataracts. Here, we report a novel protein-protein interaction between NF2  protein (merlin or schwannomin) and erythrocyte p55, also designated as MPP1.  The p55 is a conserved scaffolding protein with postulated functions in cell  shape, hair cell development, and neural patterning of the retina. The FERM  domain of NF2 protein binds directly to p55, and surface plasmon resonance  analysis indicates a specific interaction with a kD value of 3.7 nM. We  developed a specific monoclonal antibody against human erythrocyte p55, and  found that both p55 and NF2 proteins are colocalized in the non-myelin-forming  Schwann cells. This finding suggests that the p55-NF2 protein interaction may  play a functional role in the regulation of apico-basal polarity and tumor  suppression pathways in non-erythroid cells.
