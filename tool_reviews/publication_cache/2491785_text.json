  "abstract": "The order of loci in the pericentric region of chromosome 17, based on evidence  from physical and genetic breakpoints.  Fain PR(1), Wright E, Willard HF, Stephens K, Barker DF.  Author information: (1)Department of Medical Informatics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City.  Previous genetic analyses of chromosome 17 markers and NF1 (Fain et al. 1987)  were extended in an attempt to order marker loci that map physically to  17cen----17q12. Three additional markers (HHH202, CRI-L581, and CRI-L946) were  included in the analyses. Recombinants within the cluster of seven unordered  marker loci were identified by pairwise analyses for each family and by  examining the within-sibship segregation patterns for different markers. Changes  in the segregation pattern for different loci define genetic breakpoints. Given  that interference is complete in the region, markers with the same segregation  pattern lie on one side of the breakpoint, while markers with different  segregation patterns lie on opposite sides of the breakpoint. If the order of  boundary markers is known, markers on each side of a breakpoint can be oriented  in relation to the centromere. The order  cen-(HHH202/NF1)-(EW207)-(EW203/CRI-L581)- (CRI-L946)-(HOX-2/NGFR)-qter was  inferred by combining information from physical breakpoints in a panel of  mouse/human hybrids and information from genetic breakpoints found in 16 NF1  families.
