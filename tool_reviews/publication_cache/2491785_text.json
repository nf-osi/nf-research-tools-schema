  "title": "The order of loci in the pericentric region of chromosome 17, based on evidence from physical and genetic breakpoints.",
  "abstract": "Previous genetic analyses of chromosome 17 markers and NF1 (Fain et al. 1987) were extended in an attempt to order marker loci that map physically to 17cen----17q12. Three additional markers (HHH202, CRI-L581, and CRI-L946) were included in the analyses. Recombinants within the cluster of seven unordered marker loci were identified by pairwise analyses for each family and by examining the within-sibship segregation patterns for different markers. Changes in the segregation pattern for different loci define genetic breakpoints. Given that interference is complete in the region, markers with the same segregation pattern lie on one side of the breakpoint, while markers with different segregation patterns lie on opposite sides of the breakpoint. If the order of boundary markers is known, markers on each side of a breakpoint can be oriented in relation to the centromere. The order cen-(HHH202/NF1)-(EW207)-(EW203/CRI-L581)- (CRI-L946)-(HOX-2/NGFR)-qter was inferred by combining information from physical breakpoints in a panel of mouse/human hybrids and information from genetic breakpoints found in 16 NF1 families.",
