  "title": "Image segmentation of plexiform neurofibromas from a deep neural network using multiple b-value diffusion data.",
  "abstract": "We assessed\u00a0the accuracy of semi-automated tumor volume maps\u00a0of plexiform neurofibroma (PN) generated by a deep\u00a0neural network, compared to manual segmentation using diffusion weighted\u00a0imaging\u00a0(DWI) data. NF1 Patients were recruited from a phase II clinical trial for the treatment of PN. Multiple b-value DWI was imaged over the largest PN. All DWI datasets were registered and intensity normalized prior to segmentation with a multi-spectral neural network classifier (MSNN). Manual volumes of PN were performed on 3D-T2 images registered to diffusion images and compared to MSNN volumes with the S\u00f8rensen-Dice coefficient. Intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) parameters were calculated from resulting volumes. 35 MRI scans were included from 14 subjects. S\u00f8rensen-Dice coefficient between the semi-automated and manual segmentation was 0.77\u2009\u00b1\u20090.016. Perfusion fraction (f) was significantly higher for tumor versus normal tissue (0.47\u2009\u00b1\u20090.42 vs. 0.30\u2009\u00b1\u20090.22, p\u2009=\u20090.02), similarly, true diffusion (D) was significantly higher for PN tumor versus normal (0.0018\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0003 vs. 0.0012\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0002, p\u2009<\u20090.0001). By contrast, the pseudodiffusion coefficient (D*) was significantly lower for PN tumor versus normal (0.024\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01 vs. 0.031\u2009\u00b1\u20090.005, p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Volumes generated by a neural network from multiple diffusion data on PNs demonstrated good correlation with manual volumes. IVIM analysis of multiple b-value diffusion data demonstrates significant differences between PN and normal tissue.",

  "methods": "Methods The Indiana University Institutional Review Board approved this prospective study. All NF1 subjects participated with informed consent in a phase II clinical trial of imatinib mesylate (Imatinib) for the treatment of PNs . Inclusion criteria were NF1 patients with at least one plexiform neurofibroma greater than 1\u00a0cm in a single dimension, an MRI scan with multiple b-value diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) at baseline, and at least one follow-up MRI at 6-month intervals. All MRI sequences were performed on a 1.5\u00a0T scanner (Magnetom Avanto, Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) and included 3D T2-weighted spectral attenuated inversion recovery (SPAIR) sequences in the coronal plane (TR\u2009=\u20092200, TE\u2009=\u2009200, 1\u00a0mm slice thickness, 0\u00a0mm gap, FA\u2009=\u2009120\u00b0, matrix\u2009=\u2009448\u2009\u00d7\u2009450) as well as diffusion weighted sequences in the axial or sagittal plane with multiple b-values (b\u2009=\u20090, 50, 150, 200, 400, 600, TR\u2009=\u20092137, TE\u2009=\u200968.4, ST\u2009=\u20095\u00a0mm, gap\u2009=\u20096.5\u00a0mm, FA\u2009=\u200990\u00b0) focused on the largest PN. Sagittal or axial orientation was chosen on diffusion weighted sequences for maximum in-plane coverage of the largest PN. For the purposes of comparison to diffusion weighted datasets, modified SPAIR images were reformatted in the same plane as the diffusion dataset at matching 5\u00a0mm slice thickness and truncated to match the diffusion anatomical coverage. 6 Neural network machine learning All diffusion datasets were registered to the baseline time point for each subject using the normalized entropy mutual information method described previously . Images were intensity normalized over the interval [0.0, 1.0] by dividing each image volume by the maximum value of the B0 image set (Fig.\u00a0 7 1 ). Using the multispectral neural network (MSNN) modeling tool available in Analyze 12.0 (AnalyzeDirect, Overland Park, KS) , model priors for each \u201cclass\u201d were constructed by defining regions of interest for normal (i.e. non-tumor) tissue, NF1 lesions, and \u201cbackground\u201d (i.e. remainder) that were extracted across all registered normalized multi-b value (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 400, 600) DWI images. The selection of hidden layers was based on an empirical analysis of the model, where the minimum probability was fixed at 0.1, alpha probability was set to 0.25, and epochs set at 200 according to the guidance from the manufacturer. Under these conditions, the number of hidden layers was varied systematically from 3 to 20 layers and the degree of segmentation assessed for over classification. Once the number of layers were selected, the number of epochs were systematically varied from 100 to 1000, keeping the number of hidden layers, minimum probability, and alpha probability constant. Once optimized, the multi-b value voxel series for each class were then applied to a feed-forward neural network consisting of 15 hidden layers each having 3 nodes (Appendix Fig.\u00a0 8 8 ), for training purposes, with 200 epochs. In addition, the recommended minimum probability of 0.1 and an alpha probability of 0.25 were used for voxel classification. The minimum probability represents the likelihood that any given voxel belongs to a defined class; voxels with values less than this probability are left unclassified. Similarly, the alpha probability is a confidence-weighting parameter which controls the strength of the relaxation during iterative optimization. Due to design limitations of the MSNN tool, only a single training set could be defined as part of the model priors; therefore, we randomly selected an NF1 subject from the population to serve as the training set for all subsequent segmentation, and was excluded from the remaining analysis. Post-training, classification of the remaining normalized multi-b value images for each subject were then performed generating 3D object maps for each region in the image series. Each resulting volume map identified as tumor by the neural network was then reviewed and manually edited for obvious erroneous anatomy by a trained imaging scientist (SP) which commonly included bladder, brain, eyes, and spinal fluid (Fig.\u00a0 2 ). These misclassified anatomical structures were excluded from the tumor volume. Figure 1 Image processing workflow for Multi-Spectral Neural Network classification. DWI MRI image series from baseline and follow up scans are imported into the Clinical Trials Processor for de-identification and then registered using the normalized entropy mutual information method described previously . Post registration, maximum and minimum intensities were computed, images intensity normalized over the interval [0.0, 1.0], and images were segmented using the MSNN method. Object maps were then individually inspected for classification errors, cleaned (if required), and then submitted to volumetric and IVIM diffusion modeling. 7 Figure 2 Representative normalized sagittal images of cervical DWI MRI: ( A ) b\u2009=\u20090 DWI image (unclassified); ( B ) Initial Classified Object Map based on the MSNN model described in Fig.\u00a0 1 ; normal tissue (green) and tumor (blue); ( C ) Misclassified structures such as Brain (red) and Orbits (yellow arrow) which require exclusion from tumor volume; and ( D ) Quality control corrected normal (green) and tumor (blue). Manual segmentation analysis As a comparison to manual segmentation, a neuroradiology fellow (JK) manually traced all plexiform neurofibromas on the registered SPAIR images in consensus with the senior neuroradiologist (CH). Measurements were made on a commercially available image analysis software (MIM Encore 6.9.3, MIM Software INC, Cleveland, OH,  https://www.mimsoftware.com/nuclear_medicine/encore ) using a freehand ROI tool. The volumes of the manual measurements were summated for each MRI exam and used for analysis. Bland\u2013Altman plots were performed between the MSNN volume results and corresponding manual segmentation results. Linear regression and S\u00f8rensen\u2013Dice coefficient was used to analyze correlation and concordance between manual tumor volumes and neural network results. IVIM analysis Neural network generated volume maps were also used to generate average b-value series for IVIM analysis according to the bi-exponential model proposed by Le Bihan et al . : 9 1 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\frac{S\\left( b \\right)}{{S\\left( 0 \\right)}} = f \\times e^{{ - bD^{*} }} + \\left( {1 - f} \\right) \\times e^{ - bD}$$\\end{document} S b S 0 = f \u00d7 e - b D \u2217 + 1 - f \u00d7 e - b D where  S ,  b ,  f ,  D * , and  D  are the raw signal, b-value, perfusion fraction, pseudo-diffusion (mixed diffusion) coefficient (sec/mm 2 ), and true molecular diffusion (slow diffusion) coefficient (sec/mm 2 ), respectively. Calculation of IVIM parameters were performed on a molecular kinetic modeling software ( eLucidate , Paul R. Territo, Ph.D, Indiana University, Indianapolis, USA), where the uniformly weighted sum-of squares difference (SSD) between the objective function (Eq.\u00a0 1 ) and normalized b-value series was optimized via Simulated Annealing (relative SSD, tolerance 1e\u221215). IVIM parameters were compared across available scanning time points at baseline, 6\u00a0months and 12\u00a0months, between PN tumors and normal structures excluding the bladder, brain, eyes and spinal fluid. Significant differences of IVIM parameters were assessed between all PN tumor and normal tissue using a two-tailed paired T-test, while a One-way ANOVA was used to assess for significant changes in IVIM parameters for PNs between baseline, 6-month and 12-month scans. In all cases, significance was taken at the  p \u2009\u2264\u20090.05 level.

  "introduction": "Introduction Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common genetic neurocutaneous disease, affecting 1 in 3000 newborn infants . There are over 1000 identified mutations of the  1 NF1  gene which produces a tumor suppressor protein called neurofibromin . A prototypical NF1 tumor is the plexiform neurofibroma (PN), a neurofibroma variant with tumor cells that spread along multiple nerve fascicles, resulting in an extensive mass of thickened nerve bundles in a proteinaceous matrix. These PNs affect 25\u201350% of NF1 patients and can occur anywhere there are nerve fibers leading to significant morbidity and mortality depending on the size and location adjacent to vital structures 2 . Approximately 10% of PNs can transform to become malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors over the lifetime of the patient 3 . Currently, surgical resection is the only available therapy, but is infrequently curative due to extensive invasion, making complete resection difficult 3 . No effective medical therapy currently exists; however, clinical trials are underway to evaluate chemotherapy which shrink tumor or limit growth. 3 Therefore, accurate measurements of tumor burden are necessary to assess for tumor response. Two dimensional measurements are limited in assessing treatment change because of the common irregularity and extensiveness of PNs. Considerable intra- and interobserver variation has also been demonstrated in two- or three-dimensional manual measurements . Furthermore, in cases with large, extensive PNs throughout the entire body, user fatigue can result in measurement errors 4 . Ideally, automated segmentation of PNs from normal tissue with limited user interaction would decrease intra- and interobserver variability as well as user fatigue. The purpose of this project is to develop a neural network deep learning algorithm to perform semi-automated volume segmentation of PNs based on multiple b-value diffusion weighted MRI and to assess the accuracy of the tumor volume maps by comparing to manual segmentation. Post-segmentation, intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) parameters generated from the multiple b-value modeling of data are also compared between PN and background normal tissue. 5",
  "results": "Results A total of 35 MRI scans were included from 14 subjects (mean age 22.6\u00a0years; range 2\u201351\u00a0years; 11 females, 3 males). Location for the largest PN included: head and neck (9 subjects), chest (3 subjects), abdomen and pelvis (1 subject), and right thigh (1 subject). On average, a neural network case including manual definition of tumor classes with removal of obvious normal anatomy took 6\u00a0min, while manually measuring the PNs took an average of 18\u00a0min. Bland\u2013Altman plots of the MSNN versus manual segmentation results are also shown in Figs.  3  and  4 . Raw values for the Bland Altman plots are given in Table  1 . Linear regression (Fig.\u00a0 5 ) showed significant correlation (r\u2009=\u20090.51,  p \u2009=\u20090.002). The S\u00f8rensen\u2013Dice coefficient was 0.77\u2009\u00b1\u20090.016 (\u00b1\u2009SEM, range 0.54\u20130.96).

Figure 5 Linear regression analysis of manual versus MSNN volumes with trend line and 95% confidence intervals. All IVIM modeling showed a very high degree of fit across the three time points studied for normal (non-tumor; R\u2009=\u20090.999\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0001, 0.999\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0002, 0.998\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0002) and PN tumors (R 2 \u2009=\u20090.999\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0001, 0.999\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0004, 0.998\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0005). Moreover, there was a significant difference for all IVIM parameters between normal tissue and PN tumors. Perfusion fraction (i.e. f) was significantly higher for tumor versus normal tissue (0.47\u2009\u00b1\u20090.42 vs. 0.30\u2009\u00b1\u20090.22,  p \u2009=\u20090.02), similarly, D was significantly higher for PN tumor versus normal tissue (0.0018\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0003 vs. 0.0012\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0002,  p \u2009<\u20090.0001). By contrast, D* was significantly lower for PN tumor versus normal tissue (0.024\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01 vs. 0.031\u2009\u00b1\u20090.005,  p \u2009<\u20090.0001). Despite the differences in tissue IVIM parameters, there was no significant change from Imatinib treatment baseline (pre-treatment) when comparing tissues through time (Fig.\u00a0 6 ).

  "discussion": "Conclusion IVIM parameters can significantly differentiate PNs from normal background tissue. Deep learning of multiple b-value DWI data from a neural network successfully generated volume maps in a semi-automated process. When compared with manual measurements, the semiautomated volumes had a S\u00f8rensen\u2013Dice coefficient of 77%. However, PNs in anatomy typically affected by susceptibility artifact within the head, neck and chest limit greater concordance and further work is needed to develop this technology into a routine clinical tool.",
