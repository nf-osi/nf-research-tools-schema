  "title": "Dose-dependent seizure control with MEK inhibitor therapy for progressive glioma in a child with neurofibromatosis type 1.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Low-grade gliomas (LGGs) occurring in children can result in many different neurologic complications, including seizures. MEK inhibitors are increasingly being used to treat LGG, but their effect on associated neurologic symptoms has not been established. RESULTS: Here, we report a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), medically refractory epilepsy (MRE), and an extensive optic pathway glioma (OPG) who developed dose-dependent seizure control while being treated with selumetinib. Seizure frequency rebounded after dose reduction for cardiac toxicity, then improved, and finally ceased after restarting full dosing, allowing confidence in the cause of improvement. CONCLUSION: Selumetinib may have promise in epilepsy management in other children with NF1 or LGG.",
