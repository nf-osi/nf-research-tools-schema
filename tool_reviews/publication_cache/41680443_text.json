  "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type I is a rare neurocutaneous syndrome characterized by the development of disfiguring neurofibroma tumors with unmet clinical needs. As Neurofibromatosis Type I is a monogenic disease, the development of gene therapy is highly attractive, but it is currently unknown if rescuing the NF1 gene in established neurofibroma is sufficient for tumor regression. Here, we test this hypothesis by building two novel NF1 mouse models with reversible NF1 expression. In the first model, the human NF1 ",
