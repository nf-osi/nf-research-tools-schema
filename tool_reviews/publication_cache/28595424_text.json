  "abstract": "Meningiomas are frequent intracranial and intraspinal tumors. They are tumors of the elderly, and meningioma growth at certain localizations, as well as recurrent tumors or primary aggressive biology may pose a therapeutic challenge. To understand the growth characteristics of meningiomas, animal models can provide insights both from a biological and therapeutical point of view. Using genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMM), it has been proven that alterations of the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) gene are key steps for benign meningioma development. Aggressive meningiomas can be induced by simultaneous activation of Nf2 and the PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor)/-PDGF-Receptor (R) system, or inactivation of Tp53 and cdkn2ab in mice. However, mechanisms acting in NF2 wild-type meningiomas are poorly understood so far, because appropriate models are lacking. Xenograft models have been used either by implantation of primary cultures derived from human meningiomas, or immortalized human cell lines, respectively. While the value of primary cells is limited due to low rate of overall tumor growth and slow proliferation, xenograft approaches have been shown to be helpful for the evaluation of potential medical treatment options. Future studies must incorporate new molecular meningioma tumor drivers, as well as potential treatment options based on recurrent genetic alterations into the generation of meningioma models.",
  "methods": "2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Preparation of Meningeal Cells From Cas9 Transgenic Mice Twenty mice of Rosa26‐LSL‐Cas9 knockin were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Strain #:024857, USA) and successfully bred in our lab. All of the protocols were approved by the Experimental Animals Ethics Committee of Fudan University (2022JS‐318). Five neonatal mice (postnatal day 2) were killed, meningeal tissues were isolated, and single‐cell primary cultures were obtained via mechanical and enzymatic methods. Primary meningeal cells were passaged for four to five generations. 2.2 Transfection of Meningeal Cells From Cas9 Transgenic Mice The lentiviral vector pLentiCre/gRNA was packaged, and the viral expression strategy was as follows: CMV‐NLS‐Cre‐3FLAG‐polyA‐U6‐gRNA1‐U6‐gRNA2‐U6‐gRNA3‐U6‐gRNA4. From this, four gRNAs were screened and separately directed to the  Nf2, P15 \n \n ,  Ink4b \n P16 \n \n , and  Ink4a \n P19 \n \n  genes. Arf \n The titer of the packaged virus was greater than 10 8 /ml. According to a virus: cell ratio of 200:1, the primary meningeal cells were infected, cultured, and passaged. The green fluorescent protein (GDP) signal was observed after 3 days of infection with the pLentiCre/gRNA virus, while no signal was observed in the control group. This indicated that the virus could infect the cells and express Cre, which in turn would activate Cas9 expression. In addition, we found that primary meningeal cells infected with the no‐load virus could no longer be propagated after four passages, while the cells infected with pLentiCre/gRNA exhibited a vigorous growth trend, requiring passaging every 2 days, with no slowing in growth for more than 10 generations. 2.3 Target Gene Expression After Viral Infection in Meningeal Cells After being infected with the pLentiCre/gRNA virus, the meningeal cells were passaged for 10 generations, and some meningeal cells were used for DNA extraction. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing were performed on the site to be edited and revealed that the editing sites set in the meningeal cells for the four target genes ( Nf2, P15 \n \n ,  Ink4b \n P16 \n \n , and  Ink4a \n P19 \n \n ) were all mutated. This indicated that our strategy can indeed simultaneously achieve mutations in the four genes in meningeal cells. Arf \n 2.4 Viral Injection Into the Meningeal Site of Neonatal Mice Usually, AAV has a high packaging titer and has a long‐lasting effect in vivo [ 7 ]. Therefore, according to the pLentiCre/gRNA strategy, we constructed an AAV vector of pAAVCre/gRNA, which could import Cre and the four gRNAs. After the above‐mentioned primary meningeal cells were infected with AAV in vivo, the fluorescence expression was observed as well, indicating that the AAV could activate Cas9 expression as the pLentiCre/gRNA virus. The structure of the pAAVCre/gRNA was as follows: ITR‐U6‐sgRNA(Nf2)‐U6‐sgRNA(p16Ink4a)‐U6‐sgRNA(p15Ink4b)‐U6‐sgRNA(p19Arf)‐pEFS‐Rluc‐2A‐Cre‐shortPA‐ITR. The prepared pAAVCre/gRNA was injected into the skull base at the subdural position of 2‐day‐old Cas9 transgenic mice, with each mouse being injected with about 10 8  VG/ml of virus. The mice that survived the injection continued to be observed (one mouse died of viral injection). Two months after injection, five mice were killed, and the expressions of GFP in the injection site at the skull base were observed under microscopy. 2.5 Observation of Meningioma Formation by Brain  MRI  Scan After 10 months' observation, five mice were sent for a brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) scan in order to detect intracranial tumor growth. This study was conducted on a Bruker 7.0 T scanner (Bruker BioSpin GmbH). The specific method is as follows: Inhale 1%–2% isoflurane (IsoFlo, USA) into mice, and after anesthesia, the mice were placed in a magnetic resonance room for scanning. First, we performed rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement echo scans in three directions and then performed conventional spin echo sequence, T1‐weighted, and T2‐weighted scans on the entire brain. The scanning parameters are as follows: relaxation time 4000 milliseconds, echo time 15 milliseconds, field of view 25.6 × 25.6 mm, matrix 256 × 256, slice thickness 0.8 mm, scan time 3 min 20 s. After that, Gd‐DTPA (Magnevist, Germany) magnetic resonance enhancer was injected intraperitoneally into mice; the dose was 0.8 mL/kg for enhanced scanning. 2.6 Histological and Immunohistochemical Analysis After 10 months' observation, finally, nine mice tumor specimens were processed for histological examination via standard hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and also examined for EMA, vimentin, and Ki‐67 (as detected by MIB‐1 antibody) via immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. The primary antibodies were all obtained from Abcam.",
