  "introduction": "Background and aim Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant tumor predisposition syndrome caused by pathogenic variants in the NF1 gene. It exhibits highly variable and unpredictable clinical manifestations involving multiple organ systems, with café-au-lait macules and multiple neurofibromas being hallmark features. Epilepsy represents a common central nervous system complication in NF1, though its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. NF1 patients with epilepsy exhibit a higher prevalence of developmental delay and learning disabilities. Early identification and personalized therapy are critical for optimal management of this patient population. This review aims to synthesize published literature on the disease, thereby providing a comprehensive, detailed, and updated overview of its entire clinical spectrum. 1 Introduction Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant tumor predisposition syndrome caused by pathogenic variants in the NF1 gene, with an estimated prevalence of 1/4,000 to 1/2,000 individuals without significant racial or gender predilection. This multisystem disorder typically manifests in early childhood, exhibiting highly variable and unpredictable clinical features. Hallmark characteristics include café-au-lait macules and multiple neurofibromas. In addition, it can be accompanied by a variety of benign and malignant tumors, skeletal dysplasia, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, cognitive and psychological disorders, epilepsy ( 1 ,  2 ). The prevalence of epilepsy in NF1 ranges from 4–14% ( 3 ), significantly higher than the general population (1–2%) ( 4 ). Seizure semiology is diverse, encompassing focal motor seizures, absence seizures, generalized tonic–clonic seizures, epileptic spasms and so on, with focal seizures being most prevalent ( 5 ,  6 ). NF1-related epilepsy is usually secondary to intracranial lesions, such as tumors, hippocampal sclerosis (HS), or focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) ( 7 ,  8 ), while showing no established association with undefined bright objects (UBOs) or optic pathway gliomas ( 5–7 ). Notably, structural lesions cannot account for all cases, as over 50% of NF1-related epilepsy patients lack identifiable structural abnormalities ( 5 ,  8 ), suggesting that the genetic condition itself may predispose to neuronal hyperexcitability and epileptogenesis ( 6 ). Despite growing interest in rare diseases and recent advancements in NF1 research, most reports on NF1-associated epilepsy remain limited to case studies. Therefore, this review systematically examines the pathogenesis, clinical characteristics, diagnostic approaches, and therapeutic strategies for NF1-related epilepsy, aiming to enhance clinical management and improve patient outcomes.",

  "discussion": "Conclusion This review comprehensively summarizes current knowledge regarding the pathogenesis, clinical characteristics, diagnostic approaches, and therapeutic strategies for NF1-related epilepsy, aiming to optimize diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes for affected individuals. 7 Conclusion NF1 is a multisystem genetic disorder associated with a significantly higher prevalence of epilepsy compared to the general population. NF1-related epilepsy demonstrates substantial clinical heterogeneity and complex pathogenic mechanisms. Nevertheless, the overall therapeutic outcomes are favorable, with the majority of patients achieving seizure control through anti-seizure medications. Patients with structural abnormalities exhibit an increased propensity to develop drug-resistant epilepsy. However, comprehensive presurgical evaluation to identify well-defined epileptogenic zones may enable effective surgical intervention with significant seizure improvement. The molecular mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis in pediatric NF1 patients remain incompletely understood. Current targeted therapy research has primarily focused on NF1-associated tumors. Strengthening translational research bridging basic science and clinical practice is crucial for improving long-term outcomes and quality of life in NF1 patients with epilepsy. Future investigations should further elucidate the pathogenesis and contributing factors of NF1-related epilepsy to develop more precise therapeutic strategies for this patient population.",
