  "abstract": "A total of 15 polymorphic markers were used to construct a genetic map that encompasses the NF1 locus on chromosome 17. The markers were a subset of a large collection of chromosome 17-specific probes and were selected for marker typing in NF1 families after physical localization to the pericentric region of the chromosome. Multilocus data for a total of 17 informative NF1 families and 39 other families were included in genetic analyses. No recombination was observed between NF1 and four markers, one or more of which was informative in 86% of parents. More-refined physical mapping studies demonstrated that all four of the markers are proximal to the chromosome 17 translocation breakpoints from two NF1 patients bearing balanced translocations. The region flanking the disease locus spans a distance of 1 centimorgan (cM) in males and 9 cM in females. Close flanking markers were informative in 76% of meioses. Sex differences in recombination rates in the pericentric region were highly significant statistically.",
