  "abstract": "Spinal schwannoma is an uncommon condition in children, particularly when located in the thoracic region. Affected patients usually exhibit gradually worsening motor weakness, pain, and bladder control issues due to the tumor's impact on spinal nerves. These symptoms depend on the size and location of the tumor, as well as the compression of the surrounding structure. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine is the preferred method for diagnosing spinal schwannoma. It provides detailed information about the tumor's size, exact location, and its association with the spinal cord and nerve roots. Surgery is the primary and most effective treatment for individuals with spinal schwannoma. Due to its vague neurological symptoms, diagnosing this rare compressive tumor is very challenging, which can lead to significant delays in management. The majority of patients who have this rare spinal tumor surgically removed in the early stages of symptoms tend to experience positive outcomes. Herein, we report the case of an eight-year-old girl who presented with progressive lower limb weakness over a duration of three weeks associated with severe lower back pain, with significant loss of her motor function and bladder dysfunction. Upon presentation to the hospital, a spinal MRI showed significant compressive spinal schwannoma. She underwent urgent surgical excision of her tumor with complete recovery of her motor function upon follow-up at a pediatric neurology clinic. The aim of reporting this case was to highlight the importance of early diagnosis of this rare tumor type in pediatric patients, as well as early surgical intervention to achieve a good outcome.",
