  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anticancer compound 3-bromopyruvate (3-BrPA) suppresses cancer cell growth via targeting glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism. The malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), a very aggressive, therapy resistant, and Neurofibromatosis type 1 associated neoplasia, shows a high metabolic activity and affected patients may therefore benefit from 3-BrPA treatment. To elucidate the specific mode of action, we used a controlled cell model overexpressing proteasome activator (PA) 28, subsequently leading to p53 inactivation and oncogenic transformation and therefore reproducing an important pathway in MPNST and overall tumor pathogenesis. METHODS: Viability of MPNST cell lines S462, NSF1, and T265 in response to increasing doses (0-120\u2009\u03bcM) of 3-BrPA was analyzed by CellTiter-Blue\u00ae assay. Additionally, we investigated viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (dihydroethidium assay), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase activity (NADH-TR assay) and lactate production (lactate assay) in mouse B8 fibroblasts overexpressing PA28 in response to 3-BrPA application. For all experiments normal and nutrient deficient conditions were tested. MPNST cell lines were furthermore characterized immunohistochemically for Ki67, p53, bcl2, bcl6, cyclin D1, and p21. RESULTS: MPNST significantly responded dose dependent to 3-BrPA application, whereby S462 cells were most responsive. Human control cells showed a reduced sensitivity. In PA28 overexpressing cancer cell model 3-BrPA application harmed mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase activity mildly and significantly failed to inhibit lactate production. PA28 overexpression was associated with a functional glycolysis as well as a partial resistance to stress provoked by nutrient deprivation. 3-BrPA treatment was not associated with an increase of ROS. Starvation sensitized MPNST to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive MPNST cells are sensitive to 3-BrPA therapy in-vitro with and without starvation. In a PA28 overexpression cancer cell model leading to p53 inactivation, thereby reflecting a key molecular feature in human NF1 associated MPNST, known functions of 3-BrPA to block mitochondrial activity and glycolysis were reproduced, however oncogenic cells displayed a partial resistance. To conclude, 3-BrPA was sufficient to reduce NF1 associated MPNST viability potentially due inhibition of glycolysis which should lead to the initiation of further studies and promises a potential benefit for NF1 patients.",

Additionally, we investigated viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (dihydroethidium assay), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase activity (NADH-TR assay) and lactate production (lactate assay) in mouse B8 fibroblasts overexpressing PA28 in response to 3-BrPA application. For all experiments normal and nutrient deficient conditions were tested. MPNST cell lines were furthermore characterized immunohistochemically for Ki67, p53, bcl2, bcl6, cyclin D1, and p21. Methods Cell lines, cell culture, and chemicals Human MPNST cell lines (S462, T265, and NSF1) were analyzed and have been described in detail in our previous studies [ 16 \u2013 20 ]. NSF1 cells were kindly provided by Dieter Kaufmann (University Hospital Ulm, Germany). Cells were pre-cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM, ThermoFisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100\u2009U/mL penicillin/streptomycin, 2\u2009mM\u2009L-glutamine, and 1\u2009mM sodium pyruvate. Triplicates of 8\u2009\u00d7\u200910 3  cells were seeded in 100\u2009\u03bcL media in a 96 well format and incubated for 24\u2009h prior to 3-BrPA (Sigma Aldrich, Merck) treatment. Then, 3-BrPA was added and cells incubated for additional 24\u2009h. For drug treatment, phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH\u20097.4) was used to dilute 3-BrPA (10\u2009\u03bcl of 0\u20131200\u2009\u03bcM stock concentration with 100\u2009\u03bcL media per well) to a final concentration of 0\u2013120\u2009\u03bcM. Dose application was according to literature describing doses in a range of 10 to 5000\u2009\u03bcM applicated to tumor cells in culture [ 21 ]. Mouse fibroblast B8 cells (kindly provided by Ralf Stohwasser, Brandenburg Technical University Cottbus-Senftenberg) which were stably transfected with plasmid pSG5 vector and encoding PSME3 cDNA harbor PA28\u0443 cDNA under a constitutive SV40 promotor were used. Those cells either displayed a three- to six-fold increased expression of PA28y (B8y) or an empty pSG5 (B8vc) vector as described previously [ 15 ,  22 ]. B8 fibroblasts were pre-cultured in DMEM/Ham\u2019s F12 (1:1) medium (Biochrom, Merck) with glutamine supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS and G418 (250\u2009\u03bcg/mL). Triplicates of 8\u2009\u00d7\u200910 3  cells were cultured in a 96 well format. Cell lines were cultured in an incubator with a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2  at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Cell viability (CTB) assay For B8 cells, triplicates of 8\u2009\u00d7\u200910 3  cells were seeded in 100\u2009\u03bcL media in two separate 96 well formats (two to eight independent experiments) and incubated for 24\u2009h. Fresh medium containing either 10% or 0.2% FBS was added and cells were incubated for additional 24\u2009h prior to 3-BrPA treatment. After 3-BrPA treatment, both B8 and MPNST cells were incubated with 20\u2009\u03bcL of CellTiter-Blue\u00ae reagent (Promega) for 1\u2009h and fluorescence (560\u2009nm excitation/590\u2009nm emission) was recorded using a plate reader and expressed as fluorescence units (FU). The background fluorescence units FU 0  of the associated untreated unstained cells were subtracted in each measurement. Finally, we normalized the measured quantity by\n 1 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ \\Delta  {FU}_{norm}(c)=\\frac{FU(c)-{FU}_0}{FU\\left(c=0\\right)-{FU}_0}, $$\\end{document} \u2206 FU norm c = FU c \u2212 FU 0 FU c = 0 \u2212 FU 0 , whereby c is the concentration of 3-BrPA. DHE assays Murine fibroblasts treated with 3-BrPA in a range of 0 to 120\u2009\u03bcM for 24\u2009h were stained with 10\u2009\u03bcM dihydroethidium (DHE, Sigma-Aldrich, Merck) as an independent indicator of ROS formation. Staining was performed in triplicates at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 45\u2009min using 96 well microtiter plates in seven independent experiments. Stained cells were washed twice with PBS. Fluorescent cells were quantified with the plate reader at 560\u2009nm excitation and 590\u2009nm emission. Results are also displayed as normalized fluorescence unit differences according to Eq. ( 1 ). Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide tetrazolium reductase (NADH-TR) assay A standard NADH-TR staining protocol with minor modifications was applied to investigate the ability of mitochondrial enzyme NADH dehydrogenase (complex I) to reduce colorless nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) chloride into dark blue formazan compound. Therefore, triplicates of living cells in a 96 well format were pre-treated with 3-BrPA and washed once with PBS to remove detached cells. Then, cells were washed once with 50\u2009mM Tris HCl (pH\u20097.6), and 50\u2009\u03bcl of staining solution was added to each well. Staining solution was prepared freshly by mixing equal amounts of solution I (50\u2009mM Tris HCl (pH\u20097.6) and 0,16% NADH) and solution II (50\u2009mM Tris HCl (pH\u20097.6) and 0,2% NBT) prior to application. Staining of cells was performed for 2\u2009h at room temperature. Hereafter, the absorbance of NBT formazan deposits was measured calorimetrically at a wavelength of 620\u2009nm using a microplate reader; the arbitrary unit of the measured quantity is the colorimetrical unit (CU). The final subtraction and normalization of the measurement results were performed according to Eq. ( 1 ). Four independent experiments were carried out. Lactate assay To examine aerobic glycolysis in response to 3-BrPA, we investigated lactate uptake of B8 fibroblasts. Cellular consumption of lactate in cell culture medium is high under normal growth conditions. An increase in lactate concentration in cell culture medium thereby reflects a decrease in metabolic capacity of cells. The detection of L(+)-lactate in cell culture media was performed with Lactate Assay Kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Briefly, duplicates of B8 cell lines were seeded in 96 well plates and incubated for 24\u2009h. Next, fresh media was added containing either 10% or 0.2% FBS and cells were incubated for additional 24\u2009h. After incubation with 3-BrPA, 50\u2009\u03bcl medium was removed from each well and centrifuged (13,000\u2009g for 10\u2009min) to remove cellular debris. To ensure that the amount of lactate in the supernatant medium was in detection range, a standard curve was assayed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Following the manual, 5\u2009\u03bcl medium of each sample was mixed with 2\u2009\u03bcl probe, 2\u2009\u03bcl enzyme mix and 41\u2009\u03bcl lactate assay buffer (per each reaction) in a 96 well plate and incubated for 30\u2009min at room temperature. Lactate probe fluorescence was measured at 535\u2009nm excitation and 587\u2009nm emission by means of a microplate reader. The results of three independent experiments are expressed as normalized FU differences according to Eq. ( 1 ). Protein expression of cell-cycle marker proteins To demonstrate the expression of cell cycle and apoptosis markers, we analyzed MPNST cell lines by immunohistochemistry using commercially available antibodies against the proliferation marker protein Ki-67 (antigen Ki67, monoclonal mouse anti-human Ki67 antigen, clone MIB1, M7240, DAKO), the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (p21, monoclonal mouse anti-human p21 WAF1/Cip1 , M7202, DAKO), the tumor protein p53 (p53, monoclonal mouse anti-human p53 M7001, DAKO), the B-cell lymphoma 2 (bcl2, monoclonal mouse anti-human bcl2 oncoprotein, M887, DAKO), the B-cell lymphoma 6 (bcl6, monoclonal mouse anti-human bcl6 protein, M7211, DAKO), and the cyclin D1 (monoclonal rabbit anti-human cyclin D1, M3642, DAKO). Analyses were performed using standard protocols according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions on an autostainer (DAKO Autostainer Link 48) and human immuno-positive tumors were used as controls. Ki67 labelling was analysed conventionally as well as using analysis software pathoZoom\u00ae (smart in media, K\u00f6ln, Germany). Statistical analyses The U test of Mann, Whitney, and Wilcoxon was applied for univariate hypothesis testing with two independent samples in each case. A significance level of \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05 was used and all confidence levels were 1 \u2013 \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.95 \u2259 95%. A  p  value of \u2264\u00a00.05 was considered to be significant. Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient r was used to quantify the strength of a correlation. The probabilities p of zero correlation were calculated using a one-sided association test based on Student\u2019s t test with n - 2 degrees of freedom, where n is the sample size. The quality of estimating a correlation by a regression function was evaluated using the coefficient of determination, r 2 . The graphical representation of the results and the statistical hypothesis testing were performed by the software package MATLAB\u00ae, version R2007a (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA).",

  "introduction": "Background Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) associated malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) still do not respond well to chemotherapy and increase mortality of NF1 patients markedly. In general, malignant tumors characteristically prefer aerobic glycolysis due to gene mutations responsible for metabolic functions. We therefore investigated the effect of the anticancer compound 3-bromopyruvate (3-BrPA), a small alkylating compound that specifically suppresses cancer cell metabolism. Due to its structural similarity to lactate and pyruvate, 3-BrPA selectively enters cancer cells through monocarboxylic acid transporters which are poorly expressed in normal cells. Intracellular 3-BrPA promotes cytotoxic effects via targeting glycolytic and mitochondrial energy metabolism [ 1 \u2013 3 ]. Tumor cells prefer the utilization of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via aerobic glycolysis which is known as the \u201cWarburg effect\u201d [ 4 ]. Compared to mitochondrial respiration, aerobic glycolysis offers survival advantages such as faster ATP production and increased tolerance towards fluctuations in oxygen supply [ 5 ]. In addition, the conversion of pyruvate into lactate creates an acidic cellular environment toxic to normal cells. Tumor cells sustain anabolic processes using glucose and can adapt to increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [ 6 \u2013 8 ]. Overactive glycolysis additionally inhibits mitochondrial respiration since glycolytic enzymes and mitochondria compete for the cytoplasmatic pool of adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Moreover, up-regulation of hexokinase isoform II (HK-II) in cancer cells has been shown to associate with voltage-dependent anion channels (VDAC) in the outer membrane of mitochondria and thought to be highly relevant for cancer cell survival [ 9 ,  10 ]. VDAC with bound HK-II is involved into the regulation of cell death via release of pro-apoptotic factors into cytosol such as cytochrome c (cyt c), apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) [ 11 ,  12 ]. Our analyses investigated the in-vitro effects of 3-BrPA on NF1 associated MPNST to shine a light on its repressive metabolic capacity and cytotoxic activity. From the central nervous system (CNS) counterpart, the glioma, we have learned that glioma cells undergo a metabolic reprogramming due to isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations [ 13 ]. Such as in MPNST, CNS glioma often accumulate  TP53  mutations that are associated with disturbances in DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, deregulation of apoptosis, and other important pathways. The development of the glial, but peripheral nervous system tumor type, the MPNST, similarly involves deregulation of cell-cycle regulators such as tumor suppressors p53, cyclin D1 and others. MPNST display a high percentage of  TP53  mutations which often enhances immunohistochemical expression of p53. Mutant p53 promotes expressions of the B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL), an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, and the multifaceted oncogene, c-Myc, and contributes to cellular proliferation via gain of oncogenic activity. Since p53 mediated pathways are very important for MPNST as well as for tumor development in general, a study that investigates metabolic functions in p53 dysregulated cells bearing anti-apoptotic properties was intended. To study the specific role of 3-BrPA in detail, we therefore investigated metabolic functions in mouse fibroblasts stably expressing proteasome activator (PA) 28y (Ki antigen, REGy) encoded by proteasome activator subunit 3 (PSME3) and known to be involved in DNA damage response and cell cycle control. PA28y regulates activity, distribution, and monoubiquitylation of p53 and mediates its inactivation; thereby it contributes to oncogenic transformation [ 14 ]. Therefore, the model serves to reproduce tumor associated  TP53  inactivation under controlled cell culture conditions. Since  TP53  inactivation is present in other than glial tumors, conclusions may apply to more tumor entities and may stimulate detailed research in those. Nevertheless, we deliberately selected an invariable cell culture model that shows characteristics of MPNST cells, neglects individual additional molecular events in different human MPNST, and allows to perform reproducible and control matched cell culture experiments. Oncogenic overexpression of PA28\u03b3 represses mitochondrial cyt c release through upregulation of mitochondrial Bcl-xL levels [ 15 ]. Our investigations are intended to help understand the metabolic effects of 3-BrPA on tumor cells with a special view on MPNST patients that urgently need sufficient therapies.",
  "results": "Results Effect of 3-BrPA on viability of human MPNST and PA28\u0443 overexpressing cells Response to 3-BrPA was investigated in three human MPNST cell lines (NSF1, S462, and T265). A variable, dose-dependent reduction of cell viability was observed, and S462 cells were most responsive (Fig.\u00a0 1 a, b). The viabilities of S462 and NSF1 cells were significantly reduced compared to BRGN control fibroblasts: viability decreases of S462 cells were significant in an agent concentration range of 20 to 120\u2009\u03bcM ( p \u2009\u2264\u20090.031). The corresponding concentration range for the NSF1 cells was 40 to 120\u2009\u03bcM ( p \u2009\u2264\u20090.017). We found no significant decreases in the viability of T265 cells ( p \u2009\u2265\u20090.605). At higher concentrations >\u200960\u2009\u03bcM, control fibroblasts also showed a reduced viability. The distinct decreases in viability of the four cell lines in dependence of agent concentration are presented by means of nonlinear regression functions in Fig.\u00a0 1 c. Results of the correlation analyses are summarised in Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 1 ; all correlations were significant ( p \u2009\u2264\u20090.005).\n Fig. 1 In-vitro viability under 3-BrPA treatment and expression of apoptosis and markers of cell cycle in MPNST cell lines. c(3-BrPA) \u2013 concentration of 3-BrPA; \u2206FU norm  \u2013 normalized difference of fluorescence units.  a  Dose-dependent courses of viability in S462, NSF1, T265, and BRGN cells on agent concentration in a range of 0 to 120\u2009\u03bcM.

Scale bars represent 100\u2009\u03bcm in each photograph To demonstrate expression of marker proteins relevant for cell cycle and apoptosis in our MPNST cells, we immunohistochemically analysed Ki67, p53, bcl2, bcl6, cyclin D1, and p21. MPNST showed a moderate to high labelling for Ki67 (highest in S462 with nearly 100%) and for p53 (highest in S462 with about 80%); they are the most important criteria for usage in our study (Fig.\u00a0 1 d). Other markers which might be differentially regulated in MPNST were also expressed but more variable and at lower levels: Bcl6 was only expressed in NSF1 and T265, and bcl2 only weakly in S462. P21 was expressed in NSF1 and T265 at low levels. Finally, cyclin D1 was expressed in all cell lines, but only very mild in S462 and T265. Highly polymorphic MPNST cells become a small and rounded shape in culture; for details see Fig.\u00a0 1 d. We additionally investigated B8 cells that should be resistant to induced apoptosis when overexpressing PA28\u0443 (B8y) due to impaired cytochrome c release into cytosol. B8\u0443 cells treated with 3-BrPA displayed a reduction of viability only at higher concentrations >\u200980\u2009\u03bcM (Fig.\u00a0 2 a). Viability of control B8vc cells was reduced significantly and pronounced at 100 and 120\u2009\u03bcM of 3-BrPA probably indicating higher cytotoxicity ( p \u2009=\u20090.003). Figure\u00a0 2 a also demonstrates that PA28y overexpressing cells are partially resistant to 3-BrPA treatment. The distinct decreases in the viability of both murine cell lines on the agent concentration are presented by means of regression lines in Fig.\u00a0 2 b. The results of the correlation analyses are summarized in Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 1 ; all correlations were significant with  p \u2009<\u20090.003.\n Fig. 2 Response to 3-BrPA treatment in murine PA28y overexpressing fibroblasts (B8y) and controls (B8vc) in a cell viability assay. c(3-BrPA) \u2013 concentration of 3-BrPA; \u2206FU norm  \u2013 normalized difference of fluorescence units.  a  Mean values of normalized differences in FU according to Eq.

For details of statistics see Additional file  1 Effect of 3-BrPA on mitochondrial function Such as apoptosis, p53 expression, and serum deprivation, agent 3-BrPA itself is known to cause impairment of mitochondrial functions and to increase generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Besides, accumulation of ROS is able to stimulate mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis. Here, we analyzed ROS generation in cells with (B8y) and without overexpression of PA28\u0443 (B8vc) under normal conditions as well as under serum deprivation (starvation). At higher concentrations >\u200960\u2009\u03bcM 3-BrPA, a reduction of ROS was seen in B8\u0443 fibroblasts (Fig.\u00a0 3 a). B8vc fibroblasts which should have a controlled rate of ROS production displayed a much higher reduction of ROS levels at increasing 3-BrPA concentrations compared to PA28\u0443 overexpressing cells (Fig.\u00a0 3 a). The  p  values were\u2009\u2264\u20090.036 in the concentration range of 80 to 120\u2009\u03bcM. The decrease of  \u2206FU  under 3-BrPA therapy indicates a decrease of ROS production presumably due to mitochondrial complex I and III dysfunctions, and PA28\u0443 overexpression seems to temper the effect of 3-BrPA while normal fibroblasts seem to be more sensitive.\n norm Fig. 3 Formation of ROS in PA28y overexpressing (B8y) and control cells (B8vc) in response to 3-BrPA treatment and nutrient deprivation. c(3-BrPA) \u2013 concentration of 3-BrPA; \u2206FU norm  \u2013 normalized difference of fluorescence units.  a  Mean values of normalized differences in FU\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM are presented.

Concentration ranges with significant differences ( p \u2009<\u20090.05) in ROS formation compared to starved cells are marked by horizontal lines\u00a0and asterisks.  b  Correlations between ROS formation and agent concentration as regression lines. For details of statistics see Additional file  2 Since nutrient deprivation leads to ROS production, we analyzed if serum starvation leads to a change of ROS in 3-BrPA treated B8\u0443 cells. Under starvation, ROS levels were lower in untreated B8y and B8vc cells (Fig.\u00a0 3 a), nevertheless, the differences in the reduction of ROS production were not significant ( p \u2009\u2265\u20090.164). But interestingly, in B8y cells ROS levels decreased at higher doses of 3-BrPA indicating the same manner of action as under normal serum conditions. Under serum free conditions and therapy with 3-BrPA, the ROS levels of the control cells closely reached levels of those cells treated under normal conditions when higher doses of 3-BrPA were applied. This indicates that nutrient deprivation induced stress affects mitochondrial functions in PA28y overexpressing and normal cells. However, in our model starvation hampers ROS production in normal cells stronger. To conclude, PA28y overexpression was associated with a mildly reduced sensitivity towards 3-BrPA treatment. Figure\u00a0 3 b represents the correlations of the ROS levels on the agent concentration by means of regression lines. All correlations were significant with  p \u2009\u2264\u20090.006 (see Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 2 ). To address activity of mitochondrial complex I of the respiratory chain, we examined NADH dehydrogenase under 3-BrPA treatment. Comparable to the afore mentioned experiments investigating ROS generation, NADH dehydrogenase activity in untreated B8y cells was higher compared to controls. At higher doses \u226580\u2009\u03bcM, both B8y and B8vc cells responded to 3-BrPA treatment with reduced enzyme activity, and they showed differences indicating that PA28 overexpression is associated with a higher enzyme activity and less sensitivity to treatment (Fig.\u00a0 4 a) although differences were not significant ( p \u2009\u2265\u20090.130). Under starvation the same effect was evident, indicating a reduced mitochondrial activity (Fig.\u00a0 4 a), but also not significant ( p \u2009\u2265\u20090.289). Figure\u00a0 4 b represents the correlations of the NADH dehydrogenase activity on the agent concentration by means of regression lines. All correlations were significant with  p \u2009<\u20090.001 (see Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 3 ). Overall data demonstrate that 3-BrPA at least mildly harms respiratory activity of cells.\n Fig. 4 Activity of NADH dehydrogenase in PA28y overexpressing (B8y) and control cells (B8vc) after 3-BrPA treatment and nutrient deprivation. c(3-BrPA) \u2013 concentration of 3-BrPA; \u2206CU norm  \u2013 normalized difference of colorimetric units.  a  Mean values of normalized differences in CU\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM are presented.

There are no concentration ranges with significant differences (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in NADH dehydrogenase activity compared to starved cells.  b  Correlations between NADH dehydrogenase activity and agent concentration as regression lines. For details of statistics see Additional file  3 We then analyzed L-lactate levels as an indicator for glycolytic metabolism. Under normal conditions, concentrations were not different between PA28 overexpressing and control cells (Fig.\u00a0 5 a). But lactate levels increased more quickly and dose-dependent due to 3-BrPA treatment in control cells compared to B8y cells: at 40\u2009\u03bcM versus 80\u2009\u03bcM (Fig.\u00a0 5 a) indicating strong inhibition of lactate consumption. The differences were significant with  p \u2009\u2264\u20090.031 in concentration range of 40 to 120\u2009\u03bcM. In control cells starvation had no influence on lactate levels indicating unchanged lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity. Cells overexpressing PA28 showed an earlier elevation of lactate levels when starved (Fig.\u00a0 5 a). The differences in LDH activity between the cell lines B8vc and B8y were not significant ( p \u2009>\u20090.160). Figure\u00a0 5 b represents the correlations of the LDH activity on the agent concentration by means of logarithmic regression functions. All correlations were significant with  p \u2009\u2264\u20090.020 (see Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 4 ).\n Fig. 5 L(+)-lactate concentration was measured as indicator of L-lactate dehydrogenase activity in PA28y overexpressing (B8y) and control cells (B8vc) with respect to 3-BrPA treatment and nutrient deprivation. c(3-BrPA) \u2013 concentration of 3-BrPA; \u2206FUnorm \u2013 normalized difference of fluorescence units.  a  Mean values of normalized differences in FU\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM are presented.

For details of statistics see Additional file  4 Effect of 3-BrPA on human MPNST under nutrient deprivation MPNST cell lines were investigated for their response to 3-BrPA in dependence of nutrient deprivation. Starved MPNST cells showed noticeably reduced viabilities at 0\u2009\u03bcM of 3-BrPA that were not significant with  p \u2009\u2265\u20090.100. The same effect was apparent in PA28y overexpressing and normal B8 cells (Fig.\u00a0 6 ), but significant with  p \u2009<\u20090.001. In sum, these data suggest an inhibitory effect of 3-BrPA treatment specifically on glycolytic cancer cell metabolism and therefore viability and further demonstrates the potency of our cell culture experiments.\n Fig. 6 Viability of MPNST and PA28 (B8y) overexpressing cells as a function on 3-BrPA concentration without and with starvation. c(3-BrPA) \u2013 concentration of 3-BrPA; \u2206FUnorm \u2013 normalized difference of fluorescence units.  a  Mean values of normalized differences in FU\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM are presented for MPNST cell lines. Results gained with media containing 10% FBS are indicated by full lines; under starvation at 0.2% FBS, cell lines are marked with an asterisk and results are displayed by dotted lines. Concentration ranges with significant differences (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in MPNST cell viability compared to starved cells are marked by horizontal lines and asterisks.  b  Mean values of normalized differences in FU\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM are presented for B8y cells without and with starvation. Concentration range with significant differences in B8y cell viability compared to starved cells is marked by horizontal lines and asterisks.  c  Relative changes in cell viability on 3-BrPA concentration for MPNST cell lines without and with starvation. Statistical significance ( p -value <\u20090.05) is highlighted by asterisk. For details of statistics see Additional file  5 .d) Relative changes in cell viability on 3-BrPA concentration for B8y cells without and with starvation. For details of statistics see Additional file  5 In MPNST cells under treatment with 3-BrPA, the significant effect of starvation ebbed away with increasing concentrations. Thus, dose response to 3-BrPA treatment is clearly enhanced under starvation (Fig.\u00a0 6 b), but is pronounced at lower doses with significant differences in a range of 20 to 80\u2009\u03bcM: 0 to 20\u2009\u03bcM in S462 cells ( p \u2009=\u20090.029), 0 to 40\u2009\u03bcM in NSF1 cells ( p \u2009\u2264\u20090.015), and 0 to 80\u2009\u03bcM in T265 cells ( p \u2009\u2264\u20090.029). Interestingly, although PA28y resistant cells show a reduced viability due to starvation, 3-BrPA treatment had little effect on the gradients of the curves on the agent concentration (Fig.\u00a0 6 b). These data indicate that PA28y overexpressing cells do not much depend on nutrient deprivation at any concentration in-vitro \u2013 as MPNST cells do. Figure\u00a0 6 c and d represent the relative changes in cell viability on the agent concentration by means of regression lines. The slopes of the regression lines for the cell line NSF1 without and NSF1* with starvation were quite different: \u2212\u200940.3%/10\u2009\u03bcM versus \u2212\u200912.6%/10\u2009\u03bcM (Fig.\u00a0 6 c). For the other cell lines, the absolute values of the differences were\u2009\u2264\u20092.8.%/10\u2009\u03bcM (Fig.\u00a0 6 c and d). The results of the correlation analyses are summarized in Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 5 ; all correlations were significant with  p \u2009\u2264\u20090.047.",
  "discussion": "Conclusions MPNST in-vitro respond dose-dependent to 3-BrPA treatment compared to control cells that showed a reduced sensitivity. In a PA28 overexpression model system leading to p53 inactivation, thereby reflecting a key molecular feature in cancer but especially in human NF1 associated MPNST, 3-BrPA application mildly harmed mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase activity and lactate metabolism. PA28 overexpression was associated with a higher mitochondrial activity, a functional glycolysis, as well as a partial resistance to stress provoked by nutrient deprivation indicating its oncogenic potential. Interestingly, 3-BrPA treatment was not associated with an increase of ROS. In general, starvation sensitizes cells to treatment.",
