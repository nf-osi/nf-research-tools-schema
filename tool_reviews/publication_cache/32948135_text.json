  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anticancer compound 3-bromopyruvate (3-BrPA) suppresses cancer cell growth via targeting glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism. The malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), a very aggressive, therapy resistant, and Neurofibromatosis type 1 associated neoplasia, shows a high metabolic activity and affected patients may therefore benefit from 3-BrPA treatment. To elucidate the specific mode of action, we used a controlled cell model overexpressing proteasome activator (PA) 28, subsequently leading to p53 inactivation and oncogenic transformation and therefore reproducing an important pathway in MPNST and overall tumor pathogenesis. METHODS: Viability of MPNST cell lines S462, NSF1, and T265 in response to increasing doses (0-120 μM) of 3-BrPA was analyzed by CellTiter-Blue® assay. Additionally, we investigated viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (dihydroethidium assay), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase activity (NADH-TR assay) and lactate production (lactate assay) in mouse B8 fibroblasts overexpressing PA28 in response to 3-BrPA application. For all experiments normal and nutrient deficient conditions were tested. MPNST cell lines were furthermore characterized immunohistochemically for Ki67, p53, bcl2, bcl6, cyclin D1, and p21. RESULTS: MPNST significantly responded dose dependent to 3-BrPA application, whereby S462 cells were most responsive. Human control cells showed a reduced sensitivity. In PA28 overexpressing cancer cell model 3-BrPA application harmed mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase activity mildly and significantly failed to inhibit lactate production. PA28 overexpression was associated with a functional glycolysis as well as a partial resistance to stress provoked by nutrient deprivation. 3-BrPA treatment was not associated with an increase of ROS. Starvation sensitized MPNST to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive MPNST cells are sensitive to 3-BrPA therapy in-vitro with and without starvation. In a PA28 overexpression cancer cell model leading to p53 inactivation, thereby reflecting a key molecular feature in human NF1 associated MPNST, known functions of 3-BrPA to block mitochondrial activity and glycolysis were reproduced, however oncogenic cells displayed a partial resistance. To conclude, 3-BrPA was sufficient to reduce NF1 associated MPNST viability potentially due inhibition of glycolysis which should lead to the initiation of further studies and promises a potential benefit for NF1 patients.",

Methods Cell lines, cell culture, and chemicals Human MPNST cell lines (S462, T265, and NSF1) were analyzed and have been described in detail in our previous studies [ 16 – 20 ]. NSF1 cells were kindly provided by Dieter Kaufmann (University Hospital Ulm, Germany). Cells were pre-cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, ThermoFisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. Triplicates of 8 × 10 3  cells were seeded in 100 μL media in a 96 well format and incubated for 24 h prior to 3-BrPA (Sigma Aldrich, Merck) treatment. Then, 3-BrPA was added and cells incubated for additional 24 h. For drug treatment, phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) was used to dilute 3-BrPA (10 μl of 0–1200 μM stock concentration with 100 μL media per well) to a final concentration of 0–120 μM. Dose application was according to literature describing doses in a range of 10 to 5000 μM applicated to tumor cells in culture [ 21 ]. Mouse fibroblast B8 cells (kindly provided by Ralf Stohwasser, Brandenburg Technical University Cottbus-Senftenberg) which were stably transfected with plasmid pSG5 vector and encoding PSME3 cDNA harbor PA28у cDNA under a constitutive SV40 promotor were used. Those cells either displayed a three- to six-fold increased expression of PA28y (B8y) or an empty pSG5 (B8vc) vector as described previously [ 15 ,  22 ]. B8 fibroblasts were pre-cultured in DMEM/Ham’s F12 (1:1) medium (Biochrom, Merck) with glutamine supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS and G418 (250 μg/mL). Triplicates of 8 × 10 3  cells were cultured in a 96 well format. Cell lines were cultured in an incubator with a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2  at 37 °C. Cell viability (CTB) assay For B8 cells, triplicates of 8 × 10 3  cells were seeded in 100 μL media in two separate 96 well formats (two to eight independent experiments) and incubated for 24 h. Fresh medium containing either 10% or 0.2% FBS was added and cells were incubated for additional 24 h prior to 3-BrPA treatment. After 3-BrPA treatment, both B8 and MPNST cells were incubated with 20 μL of CellTiter-Blue® reagent (Promega) for 1 h and fluorescence (560 nm excitation/590 nm emission) was recorded using a plate reader and expressed as fluorescence units (FU). The background fluorescence units FU 0  of the associated untreated unstained cells were subtracted in each measurement. Finally, we normalized the measured quantity by\n 1 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ \\Delta  {FU}_{norm}(c)=\\frac{FU(c)-{FU}_0}{FU\\left(c=0\\right)-{FU}_0}, $$\\end{document} ∆ FU norm c = FU c − FU 0 FU c = 0 − FU 0 , whereby c is the concentration of 3-BrPA. DHE assays Murine fibroblasts treated with 3-BrPA in a range of 0 to 120 μM for 24 h were stained with 10 μM dihydroethidium (DHE, Sigma-Aldrich, Merck) as an independent indicator of ROS formation. Staining was performed in triplicates at 37 °C for 45 min using 96 well microtiter plates in seven independent experiments. Stained cells were washed twice with PBS. Fluorescent cells were quantified with the plate reader at 560 nm excitation and 590 nm emission. Results are also displayed as normalized fluorescence unit differences according to Eq. ( 1 ). Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide tetrazolium reductase (NADH-TR) assay A standard NADH-TR staining protocol with minor modifications was applied to investigate the ability of mitochondrial enzyme NADH dehydrogenase (complex I) to reduce colorless nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) chloride into dark blue formazan compound. Therefore, triplicates of living cells in a 96 well format were pre-treated with 3-BrPA and washed once with PBS to remove detached cells. Then, cells were washed once with 50 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.6), and 50 μl of staining solution was added to each well. Staining solution was prepared freshly by mixing equal amounts of solution I (50 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.6) and 0,16% NADH) and solution II (50 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.6) and 0,2% NBT) prior to application. Staining of cells was performed for 2 h at room temperature. Hereafter, the absorbance of NBT formazan deposits was measured calorimetrically at a wavelength of 620 nm using a microplate reader; the arbitrary unit of the measured quantity is the colorimetrical unit (CU). The final subtraction and normalization of the measurement results were performed according to Eq. ( 1 ). Four independent experiments were carried out. Lactate assay To examine aerobic glycolysis in response to 3-BrPA, we investigated lactate uptake of B8 fibroblasts. Cellular consumption of lactate in cell culture medium is high under normal growth conditions. An increase in lactate concentration in cell culture medium thereby reflects a decrease in metabolic capacity of cells. The detection of L(+)-lactate in cell culture media was performed with Lactate Assay Kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Briefly, duplicates of B8 cell lines were seeded in 96 well plates and incubated for 24 h. Next, fresh media was added containing either 10% or 0.2% FBS and cells were incubated for additional 24 h. After incubation with 3-BrPA, 50 μl medium was removed from each well and centrifuged (13,000 g for 10 min) to remove cellular debris. To ensure that the amount of lactate in the supernatant medium was in detection range, a standard curve was assayed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Following the manual, 5 μl medium of each sample was mixed with 2 μl probe, 2 μl enzyme mix and 41 μl lactate assay buffer (per each reaction) in a 96 well plate and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Lactate probe fluorescence was measured at 535 nm excitation and 587 nm emission by means of a microplate reader. The results of three independent experiments are expressed as normalized FU differences according to Eq. ( 1 ). Protein expression of cell-cycle marker proteins To demonstrate the expression of cell cycle and apoptosis markers, we analyzed MPNST cell lines by immunohistochemistry using commercially available antibodies against the proliferation marker protein Ki-67 (antigen Ki67, monoclonal mouse anti-human Ki67 antigen, clone MIB1, M7240, DAKO), the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (p21, monoclonal mouse anti-human p21 WAF1/Cip1 , M7202, DAKO), the tumor protein p53 (p53, monoclonal mouse anti-human p53 M7001, DAKO), the B-cell lymphoma 2 (bcl2, monoclonal mouse anti-human bcl2 oncoprotein, M887, DAKO), the B-cell lymphoma 6 (bcl6, monoclonal mouse anti-human bcl6 protein, M7211, DAKO), and the cyclin D1 (monoclonal rabbit anti-human cyclin D1, M3642, DAKO). Analyses were performed using standard protocols according to the manufacturer’s instructions on an autostainer (DAKO Autostainer Link 48) and human immuno-positive tumors were used as controls. Ki67 labelling was analysed conventionally as well as using analysis software pathoZoom® (smart in media, Köln, Germany). Statistical analyses The U test of Mann, Whitney, and Wilcoxon was applied for univariate hypothesis testing with two independent samples in each case. A significance level of α = 0.05 was used and all confidence levels were 1 – α = 0.95 ≙ 95%. A  p  value of ≤ 0.05 was considered to be significant. Pearson’s correlation coefficient r was used to quantify the strength of a correlation. The probabilities p of zero correlation were calculated using a one-sided association test based on Student’s t test with n - 2 degrees of freedom, where n is the sample size. The quality of estimating a correlation by a regression function was evaluated using the coefficient of determination, r 2 . The graphical representation of the results and the statistical hypothesis testing were performed by the software package MATLAB®, version R2007a (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA).",
