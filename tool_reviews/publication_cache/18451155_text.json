  "abstract": "Pten haploinsufficiency accelerates formation of high-grade astrocytomas.  Kwon CH(1), Zhao D, Chen J, Alcantara S, Li Y, Burns DK, Mason RP, Lee EY, Wu H,  Parada LF.  Author information: (1)Department of Developmental Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical  Center, Dallas, TX 75390-9133, USA.  We previously reported that central nervous system (CNS) inactivation of Nf1 and  p53 tumor suppressor genes in mice results in the development of low-grade to  high-grade progressive astrocytomas. When the tumors achieve high grade, they  are frequently accompanied by Akt activation, reminiscent of the frequent  association of PTEN mutations in human high-grade glioma. In the present study,  we introduced CNS heterozygosity of Pten into the Nf1/p53 astrocytoma model.  Resulting mice had accelerated morbidity, shortened survival, and full  penetrance of high-grade astrocytomas. Haploinsufficiency of Pten accelerated  formation of grade 3 astrocytomas, whereas loss of Pten heterozygosity and Akt  activation coincided with progression into grade 4 tumors. These data suggest  that successive loss of each Pten allele may contribute to de novo formation of  high-grade astrocytoma and progression into glioblastoma, respectively, thus  providing insight into the etiology of primary glioblastoma. The presence of  ectopically migrating neural stem/progenitor lineage cells in presymptomatic  Pten-deficient mutant brains supports the notion that these tumors may arise  from stem/progenitor cells.
