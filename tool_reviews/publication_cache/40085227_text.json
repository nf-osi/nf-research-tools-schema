  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) is the most common pediatric tumor, typically located in the cerebellum, with spontaneous regression observed mainly in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). However, spontaneous regression of PA without NF1 is rarely reported. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we describe a case of spontaneous regression of PA without NF1, located in the left frontal lobe with FGFR1-TACC1 fusion, in a 14-year-old boy who presented with epilepsy. Initial MRI revealed a lesion in the left middle frontal gyrus, and subsequent follow-up MRI demonstrated spontaneous regression. Despite this regression, the patient's seizures persisted, leading to epileptic focus resection. Pathological examination confirmed PA with characteristic histological findings and FGFR1-TACC1 fusion. CONCLUSION: This case suggests that FGFR1-TACC1 fusion may be linked to spontaneous regression of PA, even in the absence of NF1. Surgical intervention may remain necessary in cases of epilepsy associated with PA, regardless of tumor regression.",

  "introduction": "Introduction Pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) is the most common pediatric tumor, typically located in the cerebellum, with spontaneous regression observed mainly in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). However, spontaneous regression of PA without NF1 is rarely reported. Introduction Pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) is the most common pediatric tumor of the central nervous system, accounting for 5% of all gliomas and 15–17% of all brain tumors in children and adolescents [ 9 ]. PA occurs most frequently in the central nervous system and is located in the cerebellum (42%), followed by the supratentorial compartment (36%), optic pathway and hypothalamus (9%), brainstem (9%), and spinal cord (2%) [ 1 ]. In children, the most common site is the cerebellum (67%) and rarely the supratentorial compartment [ 3 ]. Pediatric PA rarely presents with epilepsy but may occasionally require epilepsy surgery [ 5 ]. In terms of molecular characteristics, PA often causes alterations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, such as  BRAF ,  NF1 , and  FGFR1 . Although the most frequent genetic change in PA is the fusion between  KIAA1549  and  BRAF  (> 70%), changes in  NF1  and  FGFR1  are rare [ 3 ,  15 ]. Spontaneous regression of PA has been observed and is particularly associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) [ 7 ,  12 ,  13 ]. However, a few cases of spontaneous regression of PA have been reported even in patients without NF1 [ 8 ,  16 ], suggesting that genes other than  NF1  may contribute to this phenomenon. Here, we describe a case of spontaneous regression of PA without NF1 in the frontal lobe harboring  FGFR1-TACC1  fusion that was treated with focus resection for epilepsy.",

  "discussion": "Conclusion This case suggests that  FGFR1-TACC1  fusion may be linked to spontaneous regression of PA, even in the absence of NF1. Surgical intervention may remain necessary in cases of epilepsy associated with PA, regardless of tumor regression. Discussion Spontaneous regression of PA in patients with NF1 has been reported in various studies; however, studies on PA without NF1 are limited [ 7 ,  12 ,  13 ,  16 ]. Parsa et al. reported 12 cases of spontaneous regression of juvenile PA located in the optic pathway [ 12 ]. Of the 12 patients, 4 had NF1 and 8 did not have NF1. Rozen et al. reported cases of spontaneous regression of juvenile PA without NF1 [ 16 ]. PA was located in the optic chiasm in 10 patients, pons in 2, hypothalamus in 2, and temporal lobe in 1. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of spontaneous regression of PA without NF1 in the frontal lobe. The mechanisms underlying spontaneous regression of PA with or without NF1 are not fully understood. Several potential mechanisms have been proposed, based on genetic, cellular, and environmental factors.  KIAA1549-BRAF  fusion leads to activation of the MAPK pathway, which promotes cell growth and survival. However, some studies have suggested that the  KIAA1549-BRAF  fusion is associated with less aggressive tumor behavior and may even contribute to tumor regression [ 18 ]. In addition, the low level of MAPK pathway like as  BRAF/RAS ,  NF1  or  p16  pathway are related to oncogene-induced senescence [ INK4a 6 ].  FGFR1-TACC1  fusions, which involve the MAPK pathway, are frequently found in other gliomas [ 2 ]. The  FGFR1-TACC1  fusion has been reported in cerebellar and spinal PA [ 4 ].  FGFR1-TACC1  fusion is an oncogenic chromosomal translocation that displays oncogenic activity [ 19 ]. Spontaneous regression of pediatric PA with  FGFR1-TACC1  fusion has not yet been reported. This case suggests that the  FGFR1-TACC1  fusion may also be associated with spontaneous regression as well as the abnormalities in the MAPK pathway reported in the past. Spontaneous regression in this case may be considered as a behavior of ghost tumors. Ghost tumors known as vanishing tumors are classified into two categories, neoplastic and nonneoplastic such as stroke and epilepsy [ 11 ,  14 ]. Our phenomenon was caused by the genetic abnormality in PA from the neoplastic perspective and worsen of seizure frequency from the nonneoplastic one. Surgical resection is generally the primary treatment for PA, and the potential for spontaneous regression can influence treatment strategies. Even when treatment is deferred owing to the expectation of spontaneous regression, it is crucial to conduct regular imaging studies and neurological assessments to monitor tumor progression or changes in symptoms. In this case, owing to the presence of tumor-related epilepsy, epileptic focus resection was performed. Patients with intractable epilepsy show a significant increase in clustering of oligodendroglial cells in the gray and white matter regions [ 17 ]. The oligodendroglial clustering in the cortex surrounding the PA may have affected the epileptogenicity in this case. A previous report on 339 patients with tumor-related epilepsy who underwent epileptic focus resection found that the seizure recurrence rate increased by 4% for each additional year of age. Additionally, surgeries performed at sites other than the temporal lobe were associated with a twofold higher risk of seizure recurrence [ 10 ]. From an epileptogenicity perspective, surgical intervention is a viable treatment option. Conclusion We report a case of spontaneous regression of juvenile PA with  FGFR1-TACC1  fusion in the frontal lobe. Even in cases of spontaneous regression, surgical intervention may be an effective treatment option for tumor-related epilepsy.",
