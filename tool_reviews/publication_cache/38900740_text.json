  "title": "Revisiting the NPcis mouse model: A new tool to model plexiform neurofibroma.",
  "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis Type I (NF1) is a rare genetic disorder. NF1 patients frequently develop a benign tumor in peripheral nerve plexuses called plexiform neurofibroma. In the past two decades, tissue-specific Nf1 knockout mouse models were developed using commercially available tissue-specific Cre recombinase and the Nf1 flox mice to mimic neurofibroma development. However, these models develop para-spinal neurofibroma, recapitulating a rare type of neurofibroma found in NF1 patients. The NPcis mouse model developed a malignant version of neurofibroma called malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) within 3 to 6 months but intriguingly without apparent benign precursor lesion. Here, we revisited the NPcis model and discovered that about 20% display clinical signs similar to Nf1 tissue-specific knockout mice models. However, a systematic histological analysis could not explain the clinical signs we observed although we noticed lesions reminiscent of a neurofibroma in a peripheral nerve, a cutaneous neurofibroma, and para-spinal neurofibroma on rare occasions in NPcis mice. We also observed that 10% of the mice developed a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) spontaneously, coinciding with their earring tag identification. Strikingly, half of the sciatic nerves from NPcis mice developed plexiform neurofibroma within 1-6 months when intentionally injured. Thus, we provided a procedure to turn the widely used NPcis sarcoma model into a model recapitulating plexiform neurofibroma.",

  "methods": "Methods Mice All mice were housed in the Animal Care Facility at the Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke. We follow the principles of laboratory animal care (NIH publication No. 86\u201323, revised 1985). All procedures were approved by the Animal Research Ethics Committee of the Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke in accordance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care standards. All mouse strains were maintained in a room with 12/12 (day/night) light cycle with a temperature of 70-72\u00b0F. NPcis and Hoxb7-cre  Nf1 \n f/f  mice were rederived on C57bl/6 background. Genotyping was performed by PCR as reported elsewhere [ 14 ,  21 ]. The investigators were not blinded to the group allocation during the experiment. No mice were excluded for any reason. When a point limit or end of the experiment is reached, mice are euthanized using isoflurane 5% mixed with oxygen (1\u20132 L/min), followed by asphyxiation using CO 2 . Tissues are collected and whole spinal cord dissection is performed as described elsewhere [ 23 ]. To perform sciatic nerve-induced injury, one-month-old mice were anesthetized by isoflurane 5% mixed with oxygen (1\u20132 L/min) and subsequently placed on a warmed surgery plate maintained around 85\u00b0F and mounted with a mask to maintain anesthesia (2% isoflurane). A cream is applied to the eyes to prevent dryness. The lower back is shaved and subsequently depilated using the NAIR \u2122  cream. Excess is removed after 1\u20132 min. A skin incision was made above the sciatic nerve using extra fine Bonn scissors (#14084\u201308). Upon locating the sciatic nerve in the quadricep muscle cavity with a fine curved twizzer (#91117\u201310). For the \u201cneedle\u201d strategy, a 27G needle was used to perforate the sciatic nerve and disrupt the nerve fibers longitudinally in a few bundles. For the \u201ccut\u201d strategy, the peroneal and tibial nerve were cut at the sciatic nerve ramification (sparing the sural nerve) using extra fine Bonn scissors (#14084\u201308). The sciatic nerve was placed back in the muscle cavity. The skin was sutured using monocryl 4\u20130 wire (adsorbable). At the end of the surgery, the mask is removed, and the mouse is allowed to recover on the warmed plate until the mouse is ambulant. Mice are closely follow-up for tumor formation. Histological characterization Tissues were fixed in 10% formalin-buffered solution for at least 48 hours and subsequently washed with EtOH 70%. Then all samples were transferred to the Histology Research Core of the FMSS at the Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke, for their circulation and inclusion. Briefly, tissues were paraffin-embedded (Thermo Fischer Varistain or Citadel 2000), were sectioned at 5 \u03bcm using a microtome (Leica Histocore Multicut) and were allowed to dry on Diamond white glass microscope slides (Globe Scientific; #1358W) at room temperature (r.t.). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed using Gill 3 hematoxylin (Thermo Scientific, 72604), followed by short washes with acidic water and ammoniacal water and eosin-Y in 1% alcoholic solution (Fischer Scientific, #245827) as counterstaining. Mast cell staining was performed using a solution of 0,1% toluidine blue followed by overnight air drying. For immunohistochemistry, the Vecta Stain Elite ABC kit (Vectorlabs, PK-6100) was used according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The following primary antibodies were used in the immunohistochemistry studies: S100 (Agilent Technologies, GA-50461-2); desmin (abcam, ab15200); SMA (GeneTex, GTX100034); Nf1 (Santa Cruz, sc-376886); p53 (Santa Cruz, sc-126); Iba1 (Fujifilm, 019\u201319741). The pathologist (S. Geha) reviewed the histologies. For immunohistochemistries in \u201cFig 4c\u201d, slides were treated with a solution of 3% H 2 O 2  in NaOH 0.5N for 20 min to depigment the skin. qPCR qPCR was performed using gene-specific primers and cDNA from RNA extracted from FFPE (formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded) histology slides based on the RNeasy FFPE kit (Qiagen; 73504). Briefly, a scalpel was used to grossly dissect the tissue of interest from FFPE slides (3 slides per tissue/mouse were pooled for each replicate) and process following the manufacturer`s recommendation using xylene as the deparaffinization solution, proteinase K in Tris Guanidinium thiocyanate 4M as the lysis solution (15 min, 55\u00b0C, then 15 min, 80\u00b0C) and NH 4 Cl 5M as the demodification solution (20 min, 95\u00b0C) as previously done [ 24 ]. The resulting column-based purified total RNA extract was quantified using Nanodrop and 150 ng from each sample were submitted to a reverse transcription reaction using Roche Transcriptor \u2122  and N6 random primers. Finally, cDNA was diluted with 440 uL of RNase DNase free water and used as template for a qPCR reaction using primers specific for  Nf1  (Nf1_F  5`-GCAACTTGCCACTCCCTACTGA-3` ; Nf1_R  5`- ATGCTGTTCTGAGGGAAACGCT-3` );  p53  (p53_F  5`-CTGCACTTGGATCGGGAAGT-3` ; p53_R  5`- GCCACGAAAACAAAGTCCCC-3` ) and  GAPDH  (GAPDH_F  5`-TGACGTGCCGCCTGGAGAAA-3` ; GAPDH_R  5`- TGACGTGCCGCCTGGAGAAA-3` ) as housekeeping gene in the 2X SyBr Green mix buffer (Quantabio, 95054-02K) under the following cycling conditions: 95\u00b0C, 3min; [(95\u00b0C, 15sec, 60\u00b0C, 30sec, 72\u00b0C, 30sec) X 50], 72\u00b0C, 5min. Relative expression was calculated using qBase [ 25 ]. Statistical analyses A Fischer exact t-test \u201cFigs  1d  and 5b\u201d or a one-way ANOVA \u201cFig 7c\u201d was performed to determine if the two groups were different (P = 0.05 or below). 10.1371/journal.pone.0301040.g001 Fig 1 NPcis derived sarcoma penetrance and tissue distribution. a-c  Pie chart representing the  a  percentage of mice developing sarcomas,  b  the sarcoma tissue sub-location and  c  the sarcoma body distribution.  d  Sarcoma incidence in relation to mouse sex.

  "introduction": "Introduction Neurofibromatosis Type I (NF1) is a neurocutaneous genetic disease [ 1 \u2013 3 ]. It is caused by the loss of function of the tumor suppressor gene encoding neurofibromin (i.e. the  NF1  gene) [ 4 ,  5 ]. Neurofibromin is able to attenuate Ras signaling due to its GTPase activity [ 6 ], and hence,  NF1  mutations inhibiting this activity promote tumor development through excessive Ras signaling. The cardinal features of NF1 are due to  NF1  inactivation in melanocytes (e.g. caf\u00e9-au-lait macules, iris hamartomas) or Schwann cells (neurofibromas). At least two subtypes of neurofibromas existed based on their different clinical behavior [ 1 ]. 99% of NF1 patients developed cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs). They can have hundreds or thousands of cNFs covering their bodies. The onset is usually around puberty, and cNF has zero malignant potential [ 1 ]. In sharp contrast, plexiform neurofibroma have a penetrance of 25\u201350%. There is usually 1\u20132 pNF per patient. Their onset can be as early as congenital, and they risk transforming into a frank malignant tumor [malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST)]. 8\u201313% of NF1 patients will develop an MPNST [ 7 ]. Typically, the neurofibroma to MPNST sequence progress by the subsequent inactivation of the  CDKN2A  locus followed by a gene encoding a member of the PRC2 complex (e.g.  EED  or  SUZ12 ) [ 8 \u2013 11 ]. Several mice models were developed to better understand tumorigenesis in the context of this rare disease. It took about a decade from the time the  NF1  gene was first cloned to develop the first mouse model recapitulating neurofibroma and MPNSTs.  Nf1  knockout mice are not viable, and unlike humans,  Nf1 +/-  mice do not develop any of the cardinal features of NF1 patients although they undergo loss of heterozygosity in other tissues to yield other NF1-related tumors such as pheochromocytomas [ 12 ]. Tissue-specific  Nf1  knockout using a genetically engineered mouse model expressing Cre recombinase under a Schwann cell promoter (e.g.  Krox20 -Cre and lox P sequence flanking  Nf1  exon 31) successfully inactivate  Nf1  expression in the Schwann cell lineage [ 13 ]. As a result,  Krox20 -Cre  Nf1 \n f/-  mice develop neurofibroma with high penetrance. Since this seminal discovery, several Cre recombinases under distinct Schwann cell promoters have been used in combination with the  Nf1  flox mice, and produced similar results [ 14 \u2013 19 ]. However, all but one generates exclusively para-spinal neurofibroma, a rare subtype found in NF1 patients. When  P0 -Cre  Nf1 \n f/f  mice were aged, none of them developed neurofibroma [ 20 ]. Since a nerve injury may enhance the development of neurofibroma, it was hypothesized that  P0 -Cre  Nf1 \n f/f  sciatic nerve injury may enhance neurofibroma development. Indeed, about a third of the mice developed  bona fide  plexiform neurofibroma within 6 to 8 months [ 20 ]. Thus, there is a need to develop neurofibroma models with rapid onset, high penetrance, and representing the main subtype found in NF1 patients: plexiform neurofibroma. The most widely used mouse model for MPNST is the NPcis model [ 21 ].  p53  mutations were reported in MPNST tumors [ 22 ]. Most NPcis mice die within 6 months due to the development of various sarcomas. MPNSTs developed within 3 to 6 months with 30% penetrance. Intriguingly there is no apparent benign precursor lesion. However, at the time when it was developed more than 20 years ago, no neurofibroma mice model existed. It was only realized later that the main manifestations of NF1 were either not recapitulate in mice (e.g. Lisch nodules, CALMs) or recapitulate only a rare subtype (e.g. para-spinal neurofibroma [ 13 \u2013 19 ], diffuse cNF [ 14 ,  18 ]). To develop a novel mouse model for plexiform neurofibroma, we decide to revisit the NPcis model. In doing so, we optimize this model to yield a rapid and high penetrance plexiform neurofibroma model.",
  "results": "Results We generated and aged a cohort of NPcis (n = 61) and their wild-type littermates (n = 56) \u201c S1 Table \u201d. 35 out of 61 (57%) developed at least one solid mass suspected as sarcoma within 6 months \u201c Fig 1a \u201d, \u201c S1 Table \u201d. The majority of these masses were sub-cutaneous. Very few were found in the dermis (cutaneous) or abdominal cavity \u201c Fig 1b \u201d, \u201c S1 Table \u201d. Around two-third of the masses were located in the trunk, and around one-third in the limbs. Only one was found in the head and neck area \u201c Fig 1c \u201d, \u201c S1 Table \u201d. Intriguingly, the mass incidence was more elevated in males than in females \u201c Fig 1d \u201d, \u201c S1 Table \u201d. In addition to MPNST, the NPcis mouse model is known to develop other types of sarcomas such as leiomyosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma [ 21 ]. These sarcomas with muscle differentiation are usually positive for muscle markers such as smooth muscle actin (SMA) and/or desmin. In contrast, most MPNSTs should show some S100 expression and be negative for muscle markers [ 26 ]. To determine the MPNST over the non-MPNST sarcomas, we harvested and performed a thorough histological evaluation on 26 tumors (harvested and kept for histology) out of 36 tumors (identified at necropsy) using S100, desmin and SMA as markers \u201c Fig 1e  and  S1 Fig \u201d. Surprisingly, we found few tumor cells expressing S100 although S100 marks normal nerve within the sarcomas \u201c Fig 1e  and  S1 Fig \u201d. Moreover, most masses show positivity for SMA but very little for desmin, although there is consistent staining in the muscle cells frequently surrounding or infiltrated by the sarcomas \u201c Fig 1e  and  S1 Fig \u201d. Overall, it indicates that the sarcomas spontaneously developing in the NPcis mice are histologically different from human MPNST [ 27 ]. The NPcis mouse model is known to develop MPNSTs without apparent precursor lesions (neurofibroma). Surprisingly, we observed that around 20% of NPcis mice manifest one or more phenotypes commonly used as endpoints for indicating neurofibroma development in  Nf1  tissue-specific knockout mouse models \u201c Table 1  and  S1 Table \u201d. Those clinical signs are either related to the general health status of the mouse (low activity, ruffled fur, thinness) or are considered to be more specific for para-spinal neurofibroma development [kyphosis (hunched posture), ambulation difficulties, lower limb paralysis] [ 28 ,  29 ]. The  Table 1  lists the NPcis mice manifesting the aforementioned phenotypes. None of the 13 mice listed in  Table 1  display complete paralysis of the lower limb nor ruffled fur has witnessed in  Nf1  tissue-specific knockout mice models of neurofibroma [ 14 ,  16 ]. Interestingly, a minority (2 out of 13) developed a sarcoma \u201c Fig 2a \u201d and \u201c S1 Table \u201d. To identify any abnormalities that could explain the clinical signs observed, these 13 mice were submitted to a complete peripheral nerve dissection [ 23 ] and histological evaluation. None of the dorsal root ganglions inspected and measured were above 1 mm in diameter, a measure used to gauge the presence of para-spinal neurofibroma in mice models [ 14 ]. Therefore, we submitted the six most enlarged dorsal root ganglions for histology and compared them with a para-spinal neurofibroma from the  Hoxb7 -Cre  Nf1 \n f/f , an established neurofibroma model [ 14 ]. We could identify one dorsal root ganglion transitioning into a neurofibroma \u201c Fig 2b \u201d. We conclude that spontaneous para-spinal neurofibroma in NPcis mice is a very rare event. 10.1371/journal.pone.0301040.g002 Fig 2 Histological characterization of dorsal root ganglion of NPcis mice. a  Venn diagram representing the low overlap between the NPcis mice that develop a sarcoma and the one that manifests NF clinical signs  b  low (upper, scale bar equals 500 \u03bcm) and high (bottom, scale bar equals 100 \u03bcm) magnification H&E of a normal dorsal root ganglion (left), an enlarged dorsal root ganglion (middle) of a NPcis mouse and an enlarged dorsal root ganglion (right) of a  Hoxb7 -Cre  Nf1 f/f  mouse. 10.1371/journal.pone.0301040.t001 Table 1 Neurofibroma-like clinical signs noticed in NPcis mice.

All peripheral nerve tissues appeared normal except in one case. We noticed a nerve with an enlarged region \u201c Fig 3a \u201d. Histological evaluation by H&E revealed the presence of a plexiform neurofibroma \u201c Fig 3b \u201d. This is supported by the S100 (Schwann cells) signal fading in the neurofibroma area. As the presence of mast cells is a hallmark of neurofibroma [ 30 ], we also performed toluidine blue (mast cells) staining but could not detect a high infiltration of mast cells. Of note, mast cells are not essential for pNF development [ 16 ,  31 ]. We conclude that although rare, NPcis mice can develop neurofibroma in a peripheral nerve, which is common in NF1 patients but rare in  Nf1  tissue-specific knockout mouse models of neurofibroma [ 20 ]. 10.1371/journal.pone.0301040.g003 Fig 3 Histological characterization of a plexiform neurofibroma arising in a peripheral nerve of a NPcis mouse. a  low magnification (scale bar equals to 2.5 mm) H&E of an enlarged peripheral nerve of a NPcis mouse  b  Histological characterization by H&E (left), immunostaining for S100 [middle (Schwann cells)] and toluidine blue [right (mast cells)]. Scale bar is equal to 100 \u03bcm. Interestingly, we also examined the skin of NPcis mice (n = 61) and in one case, we noticed a lesion in the neck area \u201c Fig 4a and 4b \u201d Of note, this is the very place where cNF develops in the  Hoxb7 -Cre  Nf1 f/f  [ 14 ] and  Prss56 -Cre  Nf1 f/f  [ 18 ] mouse models. To confirm it is cNF, we performed histological analysis \u201c Fig 4c \u201d. The results indicate that although rare, NPcis mice can develop skin lesion mimicking cNF. 10.1371/journal.pone.0301040.g004 Fig 4 Histological characterization of a cutaneous neurofibroma arising in a NPcis mouse. a  Gross picture of a mouse developing a cNF  b  Gross picture depicting the cNF and its normal margin harvested for histological evaluation.  c  Histology of the normal margin skin of a NPcis mouse (left), skin lesion from a NPcis mouse (middle) and a skin lesion from a  Hoxb7 -Cre  Nf1 f/f  mouse (right). Histological characterization by H&E (upper), immunostaining for S100 [middle (Schwann cells)] and toluidine blue [bottom (mast cells)]. Arrows point to the mast cells. Black scale bar is equal to 100 \u03bcm. Intriguingly, we also noticed that 10% of mice developed an ear mass \u201c Fig 5a and 5b \u201d, \u201c S1 Table \u201d. Histological evaluation revealed that these masses were MPNSTs as in \u201cFigs  1 ,  5c and 5d \u201d. Since these MPNSTs coincide with their earring, we hypothesize that the wound-induced earring enhances the likelihood of tumor formation at the exact wound location. It is known that a nerve injury can enhance the development of neurofibroma [ 20 ], but it was never attempted on the NPcis mice. Therefore, we tried a procedure where we intentionally injured the sciatic nerves of NPcis mice to enhance the likelihood of plexiform neurofibroma formation in peripheral nerves. In this sense, we proceed with sciatic nerve injuries in 1-month old NPcis (n = 24 sciatic nerves) and their wild-type littermates (n = 8 sciatic nerves). After 3 months, we euthanized the mice, harvested the sciatic nerves and proceeded with histological evaluation. The results indicate that 17% (4 out of 24) sciatic nerves progress into plexiform neurofibroma while none (0 out of 8) of the wild-type sciatic nerves do so \u201c Fig 6a\u20136e  and  S2 Fig \u201d, \u201c S2 Table \u201d. We conclude that intentional sciatic nerve injuries in NPcis mice yield plexiform neurofibroma although at low penetrance. 10.1371/journal.pone.0301040.g005 Fig 5 10% of NPcis develop ear mass coinciding with earring tag. a  Picture of a NPcis mouse bearing an ear mass coinciding with the earring tag.  b  Ear mass incidence in relation to mice genotype.

The procedure we used to damage the nerves is very similar to the one Chen et al [ 29 ] used for their allograft. The concept is to disrupt the sciatic nerve fibers (e.g. with a needle) and to create a physical space for the tumoral cells to infiltrate the nerve. To improve the yield (plexiform neurofibroma incidence) of the NPcis mice nerve injury model, we decided to perform a more severe damage by cutting the peroneal and tibial nerve at the sciatic nerve ramification (sparing the sural nerve) \u201c Fig 6f \u201d. In an independent cohort, 3 NPcis mice (n = 6 sciatic nerves) were injured as in \u201c Fig 6a\u20136e \u201d, (referred as the needle method) and 9 NPcis mice (n = 18 sciatic nerves) were injured using the aforementioned method (referred as the cut method). To ensure that the mice have sufficient time to develop plexiform neurofibroma, they were aged up to 6 months whenever possible \u201c S3 Table \u201d. Strikingly, 50% (9 out of 18) of sciatic nerves injured using the cut method develop a plexiform neurofibroma within 1 to 6 months \u201c Fig 6g  and  S3 Fig \u201d, \u201c S3 Table \u201d. Of note, we could not discriminate the pNF by histology based on the injury method used \u201c S4 Fig \u201d. To complement the histological characterization of pNF from injury-induced sciatic nerve, we performed immunostaining using a macrophage marker. As expected, we noticed positive staining in pNF but minimal staining in the injured sciatic nerves that did not develop pNF \u201c S5 Fig \u201d. Overall, plexiform neurofibroma in peripheral nerves is a rare event in  Nf1  tissue-specific knockout mouse models and NPcis mouse models but can be significantly enhanced by cutting the peroneal and tibial nerve of NPcis mice. On one hand, it was demonstrated that spontaneous sarcoma from NPcis mice undergo loss of heterozygosity (Nf1 and p53) in the malignant Schwann cells [ 21 ]. On the other hand,  Nf1  loss of heterozygosity in Schwann cells is required for pNF development. Therefore, we evaluate the status of  Nf1  and  p53  in our injury-induced pNF model. To do so, we performed immunostaining using NF1 and p53 antibodies on normal sciatic nerves (no injury) from wild-type mice (n = 8), injury-induced sciatic nerves from NPcis mice that develop pNF (n = 12), injury-induced sciatic nerves from NPcis mice that did not develop (n = 9) pNF and spontaneous sarcoma from NPcis mice (n = 23) \u201c Fig 7a \u201d. Then, the staining intensity was scored and output as a bar graph representing the percentage of tissues assigned to each staining intensity level. The results indicate that NF1 and p53 expression are largely preserved in non-malignant tissues whereas it is lowly expressed in malignant tissues as expected \u201c Fig 7b \u201d. We also performed qPCR using  Nf1  and  p53  specific primers on normal sciatic nerves (no injury) from wild-type mice (n = 2), injury-induced sciatic nerves from NPcis mice that develop pNF (n = 2), injury-induced sciatic nerves from NPcis mice that did not develop (n = 2) pNF and spontaneous sarcoma from NPcis mice (n = 2). Again, the results indicate that  Nf1  and  p53  expression are largely preserved in non-malignant tissues. More precisely, Nf1 expression is not significantly different between NPcis nerves and pNF but it is for p53. As expected, both Nf1 and p53 expression is significantly decreased in sarcoma compared to normal nerve from NPcis mice \u201c Fig 7c \u201d. Thus, it suggests that loss of heterozygosity of  Nf1  and  p53  did not took place in injury-induced pNF although alternative strategies to lower p53 expression may exist. 10.1371/journal.pone.0301040.g007 Fig 7 NF1 and p53 expression in NPcis sciatic nerves injury-induced plexiform neurofibroma. a  Representative immunostaining for NF1 and p53 normal sciatic nerves (no injury) from wild-type mice, injury-induced sciatic nerves from NPcis mice that develop pNF, injury-induced sciatic nerves from NPcis mice that did not develop pNF and spontaneous sarcoma from NPcis mice.

  "discussion": "Conclusion Here, we revisit the NPcis model and discovered that about 20% display clinical signs similar to pNF mouse models. However, a systematic histological analysis could not explain the clinical signs in most cases. As opposed to the current neurofibroma models that develop the para-spinal subtype, performing a severe damage to the sciatic nerves of a NPcis mouse yield a  bona fide  plexiform neurofibroma in a peripheral nerve.",
