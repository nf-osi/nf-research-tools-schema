  "abstract": "Vestibular schwannoma quantitative polymerase chain reaction expression of  estrogen and progesterone receptors.  Patel AK(1), Alexander TH, Andalibi A, Ryan AF, Doherty JK.  Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, Division of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery,  University of California, San Diego School of Medicine and Veterans Affairs  Medical Center, La Jolla, California, USA.  OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Determine the role of estrogen receptor (ER) and  progesterone receptor (PR) expression in sporadic and neurofibromatosis 2  (NF2)-related vestibular schwannomas (VS). Growth and proliferation signaling in  human VS tumorigenesis may play a key role in molecular therapeutic targeting.  VS carry mutations of the NF2 gene encoding the tumor suppressor, merlin, which  interacts with ErbB2 in Schwann cells, implicating ErbB receptors in VS  tumorigenesis. ErbB receptor family members are overexpressed or constitutively  activated in many human tumors, and are effective therapeutic targets in some  human cancers. VS occur more frequently in women and are larger, more vascular,  and demonstrate increased growth rates during pregnancy. ER and PR may play a  role in ErbB pathway activation and VS progression. STUDY DESIGN: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for ER  and PR messenger RNA was performed using greater auricular and vestibular nerve  controls (n = 8), sporadic VS (n = 23), and NF2-related VS (n = 16) tissues. METHODS: The qRT-PCR data were normalized with standardization to a single  constitutively expressed control gene, human cyclophylin. RESULTS: Reverse transcription of messenger RNA from control and tumor specimens  followed by RT Q-PCR demonstrated differences in ER and PR gene expression  between sporadic and NF2-related VS. CONCLUSIONS: ER and PR expression in VS might have implications for development  of a VS-specific drug delivery system using antihormone and ErbB pathway small  molecule inhibitors, due to crosstalk between these receptors. These signals may  be critical for re-establishing ErbB-mediated cell density dependent growth  inhibition.  DOI: 10.1097/MLG.0b013e318177e20b PMCID: PMC3570025 PMID: 18670322 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",
