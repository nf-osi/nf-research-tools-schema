  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To analyze the ability of ErbB inhibitors to reduce the growth of vestibular schwannoma (VS) xenografts. METHODS: Vestibular schwannoma xenografts were established in the interscapular fat pad in nude mice for 4 weeks. Initially, a small cohort of animals was treated with the ErbB2 inhibitor trastuzumab or saline for 2 weeks. Animals also received bromodeoxyuridine injections to label proliferating cells. In a longer-term experiment, animals were randomized to receive trastuzumab, erlotinib (an ErbB kinase inhibitor), or placebo for 12 weeks. Tumor growth was monitored by magnetic resonance imaging during the treatment period. Cell death was analyzed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin end labeling of fragmented DNA. RESULTS: Tumors can be distinguished with T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging sequences. Trastuzumab significantly reduced the proliferation of VS cells compared with control (p < 0.01) as analyzed by bromodeoxyuridine uptake. Control tumors demonstrated slight growth during the 12-week treatment period. Both trastuzumab and erlotinib significantly reduced the growth of VS xenografts (p < 0.05). Erlotinib, but not trastuzumab, resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin end labeling of fragmented DNA-positive VS cells (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: In this preliminary study, the ErbB inhibitors trastuzumab and erlotinib decreased growth of VS xenografts in nude mice, raising the possibility of using ErbB inhibitors in the management of patients with schwannomas, particularly those with neurofibromatosis Type 2.",

  "methods": "Methods VS xenografts were established in the interscapular fat pad in nude mice for 4 weeks. Initially, a small cohort of animals was treated with the ErbB2 inhibitor, trastuzumab, or saline for 2 weeks. Animals also received BrdU injections to label proliferating cells. In a longer-term experiment, animals were randomized to receive trastuzumab, erlotinib (an ErbB kinase inhibitor), or placebo for 12 weeks. Tumor growth was monitored by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) over the treatment period. Cell death was analyzed by terminal dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). MATERIALS AND METHODS Vestibular Schwannoma Xenografts Xenografts were developed in male athymic Ncr Nu/Nu mice (National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD) from VS specimens derived from four separate patients. All patients provided written, informed consent for use of tumor harvested at time of surgery. The institutional review board at the University of Iowa approved the study protocol and the University of Iowa Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal protocols. Mice were housed in a barrier room and watered and fed rodent chow freely. Acutely resected VS specimens were transported to the laboratory in ice cold Hank\u2019s Balanced Salt Solution (Invitrogen, Calsbad, CA), cut into approximately 10 mm 3  fragments, and placed into the interscapular fat pad in nude mice anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg, Hospira, Lake Forest, IL) and xylazine (10 mg/kg Phoenix Scientific, St. Joseph, MO). The grafts were allowed to develop for 4 weeks prior to initiating any treatment. Measurement of tumor volume Tumor volume was determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Mice were removed from the barrier facility and imaged in a small animal MRI (Varian Unity/INOVA 4.7 Tesla scanner, Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA). T2- weighted images were acquired in the axial and sagittal planes by placing an anesthetized mouse inside a 37.5 mm diameter transmit/receive volume coil. Slice thickness was 0.5 mm in each plane. To calculate the tumor volume, the surface area of the tumor on each sequential image was determined using the measurement tool on Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD) by drawing a region of interest encompassing the tumor. The reviewer was blinded to the experimental group. The measurements were repeated three times in both the axial and sagittal planes and the average tumor surface area was multiplied by the slice thickness (0.5 mm) to calculate the slice volume. Slice volumes were halved for the initial and final slices of each imaging series. Slice volumes were then summed for total tumor volume. We also calculated total tumor volumes using the entire volume of the initial and final slices for each series. This did not affect the overall results of the experiments. To calculate the relative tumor growth, the initial tumor volume (V i ) was substracted from the final tumor volume (V f ) and the difference was divided by V i  ([V f -V i ]/V i ) to account for differences in initial xenograft volumes. There was no significant difference in the relative tumor growth rates of the trastuzumab control and erlotinib control animals and the data from these animals were pooled. Treatment with ErbB inhibitors A total of 19 mice bearing human VS xenografts derived from 4 separate patients were analyzed in this study. Table 1 presents the distribution of VS specimens used for these studies. In a preliminary experiment, 4 mice were implanted with VSs derived from two patients and were randomly divided into two groups four weeks after tumor implantation. Two mice received trastuzumab (25 mg/kg in 0.25 ml normal saline i.p., Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) three times per week for two weeks while two animals received saline injections. During the final week of treatment, all mice were injected with BrdU (50 mg/kg i.p., Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) daily to label dividing cells. After the two-week treatment interval, the xenografts were harvested and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). For the longer-term experiment, the xenografts were derived from 2 additional VSs and initial images with MRI were obtained four weeks after tumor implantation. Following the initial MRI, the mice were returned to a quarantine room where they were randomly divided into three groups of 5 animals each (15 total). One group received trastuzumab (25 mg/kg i.p.) three times per week. This is similar to trastuzumab doses shown to inhibit growth of xenografts derived from human carcinomas that overexpress ErbB2 ( 35 , 36 ). The second group was gavage fed erlotinib (50 mg/kg, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA), five days a week. This is similar to erlotinib doses shown to reduce growth of xenografts derived from non-small cell lung cancer and malignant nerve sheath tumors ( 37 , 38 ). Erlotinib was suspended in a solution of 0.5% methyl cellulose (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH) and 0.4% Tween-80 (Fischer Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). The final group of mice served as controls. In this group, three animals were gavage fed erlotinib vehicle and two animals received saline injections for trastuzumab control. Treatment continued for 12 weeks. Following completion of the treatment, the mice were once again imaged to determine final tumor volume and the xenografts were harvested and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Immunofluorescence and TUNEL staining Following fixation, the xenografts were washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose. The samples were then embedded in optimum cutting temperature (OCT) compound (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA) and cryosectioned at 10-15 \u03bcm. Frozen sections from the preliminary group of animals were treated with 2N HCl for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.8% Triton-X100 in PBS for 20 min, and then blocked with blocking buffer (5% goat serum, 2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.8% Triton-X100) for 30 min. Next, the samples were incubated in mouse monoclonal anti-BrdU (1:800, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and rabbit anti-S100 (1:800, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) diluted in blocking buffer for 2h at 37\u00b0C. Following several washes in PBS, secondary antibodies (anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568 and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488, 1:800 each, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) diluted in PBS were applied for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were then labeled with Hoechst 3342 (10 \u03bcg/ml, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 10 min and the slides were mounted and coverslipped. Frozen sections from the longer-term groups of animals were labeled with anti-S100 antibody as above. Following immunostaining, terminal dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) was performed as previously described ( 39 ) and the nuclei were labeled with Hoechst 3342. Digital images were captured on a Leica DMIRE2 epifluorescence microscope (Bannockburn, IL) equipped with a CCD camera and Leica FW4000 software. Determination of cell proliferation and cell death Cell proliferation was determined by assaying BrdU uptake in xenograft frozen sections as previously described ( 31 ). The number of BrdU-positive S100-positive cells was determined from digital images from five randomly selected 30x microscopic fields (331\u00b1108 VS cell nuclei/30x field, mean\u00b1SD) for each of 3 frozen sections/xenograft (fifteen 30x microscopic fields/xenograft). The average percent of BrdU-positive VS cells was determined for each xenograft. The investigator was blinded to treatment conditions. Cell death was determined using TUNEL to identify apoptotic VS cells as previously described ( 39 ). The number of TUNEL-positive S100-positive nuclei was determined from five randomly selected 30x microscopic fields for each of 3 frozen sections/xenograft and the average percent of TUNEL-positive cells was determined for each xenograft. The investigator was blinded to treatment conditions. Statistical Analysis Differences in cell proliferation and cell death were analyzed by Student\u2019s two-tailed t-test using Excel software (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). Differences in relative tumor growth were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a post-hoc Kruskal-Wallis test using SigmaStat (Systat Incorporated, Richmond, CA). Reagents Trastuzumab was a generous gift from Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). Erlotinib, ketamine, and xylazine were obtained from the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics pharmacy. All other reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) unless otherwise specified.",
