  "abstract": "Cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs) are a hallmark of patients with the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) genetic disorder. These benign nerve sheath tumors, which can amount to thousands, develop from puberty onward, often cause pain and are considered by patients to be the primary burden of the disease. Mutations of NF1, encoding a negative regulator of the RAS signaling pathway, in the Schwann cell (SCs) lineage are considered to be at the origin of cNFs. The mechanisms governing cNFs development are poorly understood, and therapeutics to reduce cNFs are missing, mainly due to the lack of appropriate animal models. To address this, we designed the Nf1-KO mouse model that develops cNFs. Using this model, we found that cNFs development is a singular event and goes through 3 successive stages: initiation, progression, and stabilization characterized by changes in the proliferative and MAPK activities of tumor SCs. We found that skin trauma accelerated the development of cNFs and further used this model to explore the efficacy of the MEK inhibitor binimetinib to cure these tumors. We showed that while topically delivered binimetinib has a selective and minor effect on mature cNFs, the same drug prevents their development over long periods.",
