  "title": "Modeling human cancer predisposition syndromes using CRISPR/Cas9 in human cell line models.",
  "abstract": "The advancement of CRISPR mediated gene engineering provides an opportunity to improve upon preclinical human cell line models of cancer predisposing syndromes. This review focuses on using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tools to model various human cancer predisposition syndromes. We examine the genetic mutations associated with neurofibromatosis type 1, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Gorlin syndrome, BRCA mutant breast and ovarian cancers, and APC mutant cancers. Furthermore, we discuss the possibilities of using next-generation CRISPR-derived precision gene editing tools to introduce a variety of genetic lesions into human cell lines. The goal is to improve the quality of preclinical models surrounding these cancer predisposition syndromes through dissecting the effects of these mutations on the development of cancer and to provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms of these cancer predisposition syndromes. These studies demonstrate the continued utility and improvement of CRISPR/Cas9-induced human cell line models in studying the genetic basis of cancer.",
