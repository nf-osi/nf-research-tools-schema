  "title": "The nature and origin of the melanin macroglobule.",
  "abstract": "The melanin macroglobule (MMG), formerly called \"macromelanosome,\" is a cytoplasmic spherical granule formed in the melanocyte, varying in size from one to several microns, much larger than normal ellipsoidal melanosomes. Although ultrastructural features of MMG have been adequately described in the past, there has been a disagreement about the formation process of MMG. In order to further elucidate the nature and origin of MMG, electron microscopic studies were conducted in several pigmentary disorders. Our findings included: (1) The most remarkable characteristics of MMG are (a) the pleomorphism of their internal structure and (b) the variation of their size. (2) MMG do not represent true melanosomes but unique forms of autolysosomes resulting from the fusion of autophagosomes (containing various numbers of melanosomes) with primary and/or secondary lysosomes. (3) MMG are retained within melanocytes or transferred to keratinocytes and to Langerhans cells in the epidermis, and to macrophages in the dermis in any of their developmental stages. After transfer, MMG can fuse with other heterolysosomes and probably increase in size in these cells. We regard melanosome complexes as but one step in an autophagic process within melanocytes which can, on occasion, produce MMG as residual bodies.",
