  "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a single gene disorder associated with working Memory (WM) impairments. The aim of this study was to investigate P300 event-related potential (ERP) associated with WM in NF1. Sixteen adolescents with NF1 were compared with controls on measures of WM and EEG was recorded during a WM nback task. The NF1 group showed poorer performance on measures of WM as compared to the control group. No group differences were observed in P300 amplitude at Pz, but P300 latency was shorter in the NF1 group. Topographic analyses of P300 amplitude showed group differences indicating neural processing differences in the NF1 group relative to controls, which possibly contribute to the cognitive deficits seen in this population.",
