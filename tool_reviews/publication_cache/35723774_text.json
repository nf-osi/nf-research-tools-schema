  "title": "A randomized controlled trial of remote microphone listening devices to treat auditory deficits in children with neurofibromatosis type 1.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A high proportion of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) present with functional hearing deficiency as a result of neural abnormality in the late auditory brainstem. METHODS: In this randomized, two-period crossover study, we investigated the hypothesis that remote-microphone listening devices can ameliorate hearing and communication deficits in affected school-aged children (7-17\u00a0years). Speech perception ability in background noise was evaluated in device-active and inactive conditions using the CNC-word test. Participants were then randomized to one of two treatment sequences: (1) inactive device for two weeks (placebo), followed by active device use for two weeks, or (2) active device for 2\u00a0weeks, followed by inactive device for 2\u00a0weeks. Listening and communication ratings (LIFE-R Questionnaire) were obtained at baseline and at the end of each treatment phase. RESULTS: Each participant demonstrated functional hearing benefits with remote-microphone use. All showed a speech perception in noise increase when the device was activated with a mean phoneme-score difference of 16.4% (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and reported improved listening/communication abilities in the school classroom (mean difference: 23.4%; p\u2009=\u20090.017). DISCUSSION: Conventional hearing aids are typically ineffective as a treatment for auditory neural dysfunction, making sounds louder, but not clearer for affected individuals. In this study, we demonstrate that remote-microphone technologies are acceptable/tolerable in pediatric patients with NF1 and can ameliorate their hearing deficits. CONCLUSION: Remote-microphone listening systems offer a viable treatment option for children with auditory deficits associated with NF1.",
