Molecular mechanisms governing the maintenance and proliferation of dorsal root  ganglia (DRG) progenitors are largely unknown. Here we reveal that the Hippo  pathway regulates the expansion of DRG progenitors and glia during mammalian DRG  development. The key effectors of this pathway, transcriptional coactivators Yap  and Taz, are expressed in DRG progenitors and glia during DRG development but  are at least partially inhibited from activating transcription. Aberrant YAP  activation leads to overexpansion of DRG progenitor and glial populations. We  further show that the Neurofibromatosis 2 (Nf2) tumor suppressor inhibits Yap  during DRG development. Loss of Nf2 leads to similar phenotypes as does YAP  hyperactivation, and deleting Yap suppresses these phenotypes. Our study  demonstrates that Nf2-Yap signaling plays important roles in controlling the  expansion of DRG progenitors and glia during DRG development.  Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.
