  "abstract": "Beta common receptor inactivation attenuates myeloproliferative disease in Nf1  mutant mice.

Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Francisco, USA.  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) syndrome is caused by germline mutations in the  NF1 tumor suppressor, which encodes neurofibromin, a GTPase activating protein  for Ras. Children with NF1 are predisposed to juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia  (JMML) and lethally irradiated mice given transplants with homozygous Nf1 mutant  (Nf1-/-) hematopoietic stem cells develop a fatal myeloproliferative disorder  (MPD) that models JMML. We investigated the requirement for signaling through  the GM-CSF receptor to initiate and sustain this MPD by generating Nf1 mutant  hematopoietic cells lacking the common beta chain (Beta c) of the GM-CSF  receptor. Mice reconstituted with Nf1-/-, beta c-/- stem cells did not develop  evidence of MPD despite the presence of increased number of immature  hematopoietic progenitors in the bone marrow. Interestingly, when the Mx1-Cre  transgene was used to inactivate a conditional Nf1 mutant allele in  hematopoietic cells, concomitant loss of beta c-/- reduced the severity of the  MPD, but did not abrogate it. Whereas inhibiting GM-CSF signaling may be of  therapeutic benefit in JMML, our data also demonstrate aberrant proliferation of  Nf1-/-myeloid progenitors that is independent of signaling through the GM-CSF  receptor.
