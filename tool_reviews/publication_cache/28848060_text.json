Methods NF2 care in England is nationally commissioned and coordinated through four centres. An NF2 Genetic Severity Score was determined based on the phenotype of patients assessed through the Manchester NF2 service. For validation, all patients known to the Oxford NF2 centre who met the\u00a0Manchester NF2 diagnostic criteria and consented to genetic testing were analysed. Seven patients previously used for delineation of the score were excluded. One hundred and forty-two patients met the\u00a0inclusion criteria. The data assessed were from last clinical assessment, but the\u00a0length of follow-up differed. A score from 1A to 3, according to mutation type and presence of mosaicism, was assigned. The score used in this validation analysis differed from that previously published by analysing tissue mosaicism as a separate category, due to the more attenuated phenotype. For clinical use, the Genetic Severity Score ( table 1 ) consists of a 3-point classification into tissue mosaicism, classic and severe disease. The tissue mosaic group constitutes those where NF2 is confirmed on clinical criteria, but no  NF2  mutation is detected on blood analysis, or where mosaic NF2 is confirmed molecularly as confined to tissue. In the classic group an  NF2  mutation is identified in the\u00a0blood or the patient has inherited NF2, but no  NF2  mutation is identified (thus excluding mosaicism and inferring an undetectable  NF2  mutation), excepting non-mosaic truncating mutations in exons 2\u201313, which determine the severe category. For natural history studies, group 1 is subdivided into presumed and confirmed mosaic NF2, and group 2 according to the type of mutation into mild and moderate disease ( tables 1 and 2 ).

Records from routine clinical care were reviewed according to six domains\u2014patient demographics, tumour load, ocular features, hearing, major interventions and quality of life\u2014to see if the Genetic Severity Score could differentiate patients across these domains. Mutation testing was performed via the Manchester National Health Service (NHS) diagnostic laboratory on blood and where available on one or more tissue samples. To confirm  NF2  mosaicism in tissue, two separate, independently arising schwannoma samples were analysed for the\u00a0presence of the same  NF2  mutation that was absent from the\u00a0blood. Where only one schwannoma tissue sample was available and a mutation was identified (with loss of the presumed normal allele) which was not present in the\u00a0blood, tissue mosaicism was assumed and the patient was\u00a0assigned to group 1A. Where no tissue sample was available for analysis but the Manchester criteria for a diagnosis of NF2 were fulfilled, the patient was assigned to group 1A. Mosaicism in the\u00a0blood was determined either by the presence of a mutation present at\u00a0<50%\u2009level on next-generation\u00a0sequencing, or after identification\u00a0of an  NF2  mutation in a tumour, which was subsequently found at low levels in blood. Tumour load was assessed by review of gadolinium-enhanced brain and spine MRI scans performed according to a nationally agreed protocol, and reported by a single NF2 specialist neuroradiologist. Presence of VS, intracranial meningioma and spinal tumours was assessed. Any size of lesion was included and categorised by the most likely lesion radiologically, although where available histological diagnosis was used. No account was taken of size, number or growth rate of tumours. All patients had a detailed eye review at diagnosis for NF2-related features. Records were reviewed looking for the\u00a0presence of cataract under age 40, combined retinal hamartoma and epiretinal membrane, or radiological evidence of an optic nerve meningioma. Hearing grade was assigned based on a score of 1\u20136, 30  as used within the English NF2 service to indicate suitability for a hearing implant, with\u00a0grades 1, 2 and 3/4 hearing equating to optimum Speech Discrimination Score (SDS) in the better hearing ear\u00a0>70%, 50%\u201370%\u2009and below 50%, respectively, grade 5 representing patients with a hearing implant and grade 6 those with bilaterally dead ears. Major interventions counted were VS surgery, non-VS intracranial surgery, radiotherapy, spinal surgery, shunt surgery and treatment with bevacizumab. Where surgery or radiotherapy was given to a complex cerebellopontine mass, with potentially more than one tumour type, this was taken as one major intervention, but if confirmed as different tumour types removal of both tumour types was counted separately. Sixteen individuals had more than one surgery to the same VS, and these procedures were counted separately. If radiotherapy was performed to more than one discrete lesion, the number of lesions treated was used to represent the number of procedures. Treatment with bevacizumab was counted as one intervention, even if treatment breaks occurred. Quality of life was assessed using the 8-item NF2 disease-specific quality of life score (0\u201324), 27  with good internal reliability (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1=0.87). Each item consists of four statements rated from 0 to 3, with 0 indicating no problems along different dimensions (eg, mobility, hearing, sight and so on). Last recorded measurements were collected. Statistical analyses were undertaken using SPSS V.23. Genetic severity and hearing grades were treated as ordinal variables. We report standard summary statistics throughout with statistical significance of inferences set to p<0.05. We used \u03c7 2  statistics to compare distributions of gender, mutation data, tumour load, as well as ocular and hearing outcomes. When comparing multiple distributions, we used z-tests with Bonferroni corrections. Trends with genetic severity were investigated using Mantel-Haenszel linear-by-linear \u03c7 2  tests of association. Spearman\u2019s rank-order correlations were run to assess the relationship between age of patients, quality of life, optimum SDS scores, number of interventions, number of symptoms, ratio of interventions to age and genetic severity. Preliminary analysis showed that all relationships were monotonic, as assessed by visual inspection of scatterplots. Two further independent cohorts of patients previously described 10 14  with  NF2  mutations and phenotypic data were assessed to determine if the score could separate these cohorts phenotypically. The score was assigned and correlation examined with age at diagnosis for both cohorts and linear associations with presence of meningiomas, 14  cranial tumours and spinal tumours. 10  To uniformly analyse the data of other cohorts in a comparable way, we converted the data into binary values (yes/no) for the presence or absence of tumours. The study received approval from the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. This service evaluation (registration ID: 4406) did not require additional ethical approval in accordance with the guidance from the National Research Ethics Service (2016). 32",

  "introduction": "Introduction Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a severe debilitating disease affecting morbidity and increasing mortality. Birth incidence is around 1 in 33 000. 1  It is caused by inherited or de novo mutations in the  NF2  gene on chromosome 22. 2  There is a high rate of new mutation, and approximately 30% of patients with a new mutation present with mosaic disease. 3\u20135  The disease is characterised by vestibular schwannoma (VS) occurring either unilaterally or bilaterally, along with other benign intracranial and spinal tumours such as meningiomas, schwannomas or ependymomas. 6 7  Affected patients face acquired hearing loss, repeated major surgery to resect cranial and spinal tumours, significant loss of function and reduced life expectancy. 7 8  Faced with multiple tumours, management decisions are complex and outcome has been shown to be improved with care in specialised treatment centres. 9 \n Genotype\u2013phenotype correlations in NF2 are well established. Truncating mutations are associated with the most severe clinical picture. 8 10\u201314  The\u00a0average age of symptom onset and diagnosis in constitutional truncating mutations is 16 and 20 years, respectively, 15  with an average life expectancy of 45.9 years. 8  In contrast, patients with a splice site and missense mutation have an average life expectancy of 74.2 and 79.1 years, respectively. In addition, truncating mutations cause a younger age of hearing loss. 16  The age of onset of symptoms and age at diagnosis are important predictors of disease severity, 9 17  correlating with the\u00a0growth rate of VS 12 18  and directly with mortality. 19  Also associated with early mortality is the presence of intracranial meningiomas. 8 9  Presence of meningioma and young age of diagnosis are useful in counselling patients regarding a poorer outcome. 8 12 \n Data show that individuals with splice site mutations, large deletions, missense mutations and somatic mosaicism are older at presentation and diagnosis than individuals with truncating mutations. 11  In addition these groups have fewer peripheral nerve tumours, spinal tumours and meningiomas, and consequently a milder disease burden. 15 20  In more detail, 3\u2019 truncating mutations (exons 14 and 15) give a less severe phenotype than exons 2\u201313 mutations, 21 22  while exon 1 mutations give a mild phenotype. 8  Mosaicism for the identical mutation gives a milder phenotype than when non-mosaic, 23  and somatic mosaicism generally gives a milder phenotype than non-mosaic disease. 4 20  Splicing mutations in the 5\u2019 end of the gene give a more severe phenotype than those between exons 8\u00a0and\u00a015. 8 20 21 24 25  Large deletions including the promoter or exon 1 give a milder phenotype than when this section of the gene is retained. 15 \n For newly diagnosed patients, prognostic information based on patients with a similar genotype is helpful. Patients facing a high likelihood of early deafness may elect different management approaches from\u00a0patients with a lower probability of bilateral deafness, while patients with a milder genotype can derive reassurance regarding likely outcomes. Since 2010, patients with NF2 in England have been followed up in four centres of expertise. 26  A Genetic Severity Score was previously devised based on background theory, empirical data and existing literature. The hypothesis was generated that this score can describe trends in the phenotype of patients with NF2 to allow categorisation into severity groups on the basis of the type and extent of  NF2  mutation. 27  To improve clinical utility a revised score is presented here. To validate the score we present the clinical phenotype of a separate cohort of patients and confirmatory statistical analyses that the Genetic Severity Score can adequately describe trends in the phenotype of patients with NF2. Validated in this way, the score allows stratification both for clinical use and natural history studies to facilitate generation of prognostic information.",
  "results": "Results Records of 142 patients with a clinical or molecular diagnosis of NF2 under the Oxford NF2 team were reviewed. Sixty-three cases (44%) were assigned to group 1. Tissue mosaicism was presumed in the majority as either no tumour tissue was available (45) or just one tumour sample was available with an  NF2  mutation identified (12). In six cases mosaicism was confirmed by the presence of an identical  NF2  mutation in two independent samples. Given the small number in 1B, group 1 was analysed as a single cohort. Twenty-five patients (18%) were assigned to group 2A, including three cases with familial NF2 but no  NF2  mutation identified; 35 patients (25%) to group 2B; and 19 patients (13%) to group 3. The three familial patients with no mutation identified were from two families showing linkage to  NF2 , and with a combination of vestibular and other schwannoma, meningioma and ependymoma suggested an unidentified  NF2  mutation, rather than an alternative diagnosis. Demographics according to genetic severity, sex, mean age at diagnosis, mean current age, years since diagnosis, age at NF2-related death, inheritance and quality of life are detailed ( table 3 ). Twice as many women (57.1% of women) compared with men (29.2%) were group 1 (p<0.05), and there was also a greater proportion of women that were in group 1 compared with group 3 (\u03c7 2 =7.8, p=0.005). The male-to-female ratio for non-mosaics in groups 2 and 3 combined was 58%:42%, compared with a ratio of 30%:70% in\u00a0group 1; however, this was not a statistically significant difference (\u03c7 2 (2)=0.5, p=0.98).

NF2,\u00a0neurofibromatosis type 2. A strong negative correlation (r s (140)=.68, p<0.001) was noted between genetic severity and both age at diagnosis and current age (r s (140)=.67, p<0.001). The\u00a0mean years from diagnosis ranged from 10.05 to 14.48 years, and there was no significant difference between the\u00a0groups (r s (140)=.07, p=0.44), suggesting that any difference in outcomes noted is unlikely to be accounted for by differing lengths of follow-up. Although age at time of death does not appear to have a significant correlation with the Genetic Severity Score (r s (5)=\u2212.70, p=0.08), this reached significance when groups 2A and 2B were combined (r s (5)=\u22120.81, p=0.03), suggesting there is a trend, but analysis was limited by the small sample size. There was a weak positive correlation (r s (118)=.23, p=0.01) demonstrating a deteriorating quality of life with increased genetic severity. \n Table 4  details the type of mutation and proportions of constitutional and mosaic disease according to genetic severity. All 19 patients in group 3 had a constitutional truncating mutation as a function of the classification system. In group 2B twelve cases (34.3%) and 2A eight cases (32%) were mosaic in blood with the remainder constitutional  NF2  mutations.

Forty-four per cent had sporadic NF2 with no mutation in the\u00a0blood, and in total 83% had sporadic disease and 17% familial disease. The ratio of familial:sporadic cases in group 2 was 35%:65% compared with 16%:84% in group 3, reflecting the reduced genetic fitness in the more severely affected cohort. This was also demonstrated in that of the 55 sporadic cases in groups 2 and 3, 71% were in\u00a0group 2, compared with 88% of the familial patients. Reviewing tumour load ( table 5 ), statistically significant linear trends were demonstrated for decreasing presence of unilateral VS (p<0.001), and increasing presence of bilateral VS (p<0.001), intracranial meningioma (p=0.001), spinal schwannoma (p<0.001) and spinal meningioma (p=0.01) according to genetic severity. Bilateral VS and intracranial meningioma were found in 54% and 59%,\u2009respectively, of group 1, compared with 100% and 94.7% of group 3. More group 3 patients developed spinal meningioma and schwannoma (36.8% and 94.7%) compared with group 1 (15.3% and 48.3%,\u2009respectively). The presence of spinal ependymoma was marginally discriminating between the\u00a0groups (p=0.05), with a higher proportion of group 2 having ependymoma (44% in group 2A, 33% in group 2B) compared with group 3 (26.3%) and group 1 (11.9%).

Significant linear trends indicated an increasing disease load with genetic severity with respect to ocular features of NF2, with the exception of optic nerve meningioma which was limited by small numbers ( table 5 ). A linear association was demonstrated between genetic severity and hearing grade (p<0.001), with increased genetic severity associated with advanced hearing grades and a higher proportion of tissue mosaic patients having useful hearing compared with severe ones ( table 5 ). In group 3, 55.6% had optimum SDS\u00a0>70% compared with 90.3% in group 1. A moderate negative correlation with age of loss of useful hearing, defined as hearing grade 3 or worse (p=0.006), was found, with a\u00a0mean age of loss of useful hearing being 58.2 in group 1 compared with 23.1 in group 3. Reviewing major interventions according to genetic severity showed a strong negative correlation between age at first radiotherapy (p<0.001), age starting bevacizumab (p=0.007), age at first surgery (p<0.001) and age at first major intervention (p<0.001) ( table 6 ). In addition, there was a positive correlation (p=0.007) between the number of major interventions related to severity, with a mean of 1.4 in group 1 compared with 3.4 in group 3. Significant differences were seen in types of interventions, with 47.4% and 26.3% of patients requiring spinal surgery and\u00a0bevacizumab, respectively, in group 3 compared with 9.5% and 0% in group 1. There was a linear association between the total number of major interventions and genetic severity; 60%of group 1 had one or fewer\u00a0and 19%\u2009more than three major\u00a0interventions, compared with group 3 where 37% had one or fewer and 53% had\u00a0three or more major interventions. Furthermore, there was a significant difference between the mean number of procedures within each severity group when expressed as a ratio to current age, with a ratio of 0.03 for group 1, 0.07 for group 2 and 0.13 for group 3.

For further validation, details of 80 patients with NF2 from two previously published cohorts 10 14  were assessed using the Genetic Severity Score (see\u00a0online\u00a0 supplementary table 1 ). Significant correlations were observed with age at diagnosis in both cohorts. Significant trends were also observed, with increasing genetic severity associated with greater proportion of patients with meningiomas at diagnosis in the cohort of patients described by Ruttledge\u00a0 et\u00a0al , 14  and more patients with intracranial and spinal tumours in the cohort described by Kluwe\u00a0 et\u00a0al . 10 \n 10.1136/jmedgenet-2017-104519.supp1 Supplementary data",
