  "abstract": "This video presents the transorbital endoscopic resection of a Meckel's cave lesion, initially suspected as a trigeminal schwannoma. A 35-year-old woman with trigeminal hypoesthesia, pain, and gait instability underwent near-total tumor removal, with a transient cranial nerve III deficit that resolved completely. Histopathology identified the tumor as a hybrid benign lesion (trigeminal schwannoma/neurofibroma, WHO grade I). This minimally invasive technique offers effective tumor resection while preserving neurological function, making it a valuable option for select patients. Postoperative follow-up was recommended for ongoing assessment and care. The video can be found here: https://stream.cadmore.media/r10.3171/2025.1.FOCVID24164.",
