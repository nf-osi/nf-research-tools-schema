  "abstract": "Reduced striatal dopamine underlies the attention system dysfunction in  neurofibromatosis-1 mutant mice.  Brown JA(1), Emnett RJ, White CR, Yuede CM, Conyers SB, O'Malley KL, Wozniak DF,  Gutmann DH.  Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis,  MO, USA.  Learning and behavioral abnormalities are among the most common clinical  problems in children with the neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) inherited cancer  syndrome. Recent studies using Nf1 genetically engineered mice (GEM) have been  instructive for partly elucidating the cellular and molecular defects underlying  these cognitive deficits; however, no current model has shed light on the more  frequently encountered attention system abnormalities seen in children with NF1.  Using an Nf1 optic glioma (OPG) GEM model, we report novel defects in  non-selective and selective attention without an accompanying hyperactivity  phenotype. Specifically, Nf1 OPG mice exhibit reduced rearing in response to  novel objects and environmental stimuli. Similar to children with NF1, the  attention system dysfunction in these mice is reversed by treatment with  methylphenidate (MPH), suggesting a defect in brain catecholamine homeostasis.  We further demonstrate that this attention system abnormality is the consequence  of reduced dopamine (DA) levels in the striatum, which is normalized following  either MPH or l-dopa administration. The reduction in striatal DA levels in Nf1  OPG mice is associated with reduced striatal expression of tyrosine hydroxylase,  the rate-limited enzyme in DA synthesis, without any associated dopaminergic  cell loss in the substantia nigra. Moreover, we demonstrate a cell-autonomous  defect in Nf1+/- dopaminergic neuron growth cone areas and neurite extension in  vitro, which results in decreased dopaminergic cell projections to the striatum  in Nf1 OPG mice in vivo. Collectively, these data establish abnormal DA  homeostasis as the primary biochemical defect underlying the attention system  dysfunction in Nf1 GEM relevant to children with NF1.
