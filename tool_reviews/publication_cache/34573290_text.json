Study Subjects We retrospectively analyzed the gDNA and cDNA variants identified from 653 patients tested for  NF1  sequencing between January 2006 and December 2020. In accordance with the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathology guideline [ 38 ],  NF1  variants were classified into three categories ( Table S1 ): (1) pathogenic variant (PV)/likely PV (LPV), (2) variant of uncertain significance (VUS), and (3) benign variant (BV)/likely BV (LBV). During categorization, allele frequencies were reviewed using gnomAD (v2.1.1,  https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/ , accessed on 1 July 2021). Previous reports of  NF1  variants were reviewed using Human Genome Variation Database (HGMD \u00ae  Professional release 2021.2,  https://my.qiagendigitalinsights.com/bbp/view/hgmd/pro/start.php , accessed on 1 July 2021), ClinVar ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ , accessed on 1 July 2021), and Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD;  https://databases.lovd.nl/shared/variants/NF1 , accessed on 1 July 2021). Functional study was performed using cDNA and gDNA sequencing analysis (see  Section 4.2 ). The following  NF1  cDNA or gDNA variants were excluded: (1) variants with unsatisfactory quality or insufficient variant information in cDNA and/or gDNA sequencing analysis, (2) benign mRNA transcripts in RT-PCR, and (3) mRNA variants with no identifiable corresponding gDNA variant, and (4) gDNA variants for which SpliceAI \u0394 Score could not be obtained in the range of 0\u20131 (variants other than SNVs or simple INDELs, see  Section 4.3 ). Our study workflow and the number of excluded cDNA/gDNA variants are shown in  Figure 3 . Based on the exclusion criteria above, 285 unique gDNA variants of  NF1  were included for the evaluation, including 73 splice variants (proven by cDNA and/or gDNA sequencing analysis). Among the 285 variants, 235, 30, and 20 were PVs/LPVs (including all 73 splice variants), VUSs, and BVs/LBVs, respectively ( Figure 3 ). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea (protocol code 2021-05-122, approved on 6 July 2021). 4.2. Complementary DNA and Genomic DNA Sequencing Peripheral blood samples were collected in a vacuum tube containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid as a preservative and gDNA and RNA were extracted from leukocytes. DNA was extracted using a Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The concentration and purity of the DNA were measured using NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The RNA was extracted with TRIzol methods and 1 \u00b5g of samples were reverse transcribed using Thermo Scientific RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). RT-PCR and cDNA sequencing were performed to screen altered splicing and coding region variants of  NF1 . Amplification of  NF1  cDNA was performed through 24 overlapping fragments using the GeneAmp PCR System 9700 Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The primer sets for gDNA and cDNA amplification were based on previous report from our institution [ 30 ], which are listed in  Supplementary Tables S2 and S3 , respectively. Cyclic sequencing was performed using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems), and sequence traces were obtained on an ABI 3730xl DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Sequence variations were detected through Sequencher software (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). If a variant or exon skipping was detected in the cDNA sequence analysis, the involved exon and flanking intronic regions of gDNA were sequenced using gDNA to identify the corresponding DNA variant that caused splicing alterations. The reference sequence for alignment and variant detection was based on  NM_001042492.2 , the longest isoform for  NF1 . Variants were described according to the HGVS guidelines ( http://varnomen.hgvs.org/ , accessed on 1 July 2021) [ 39 ]. 4.3. Splicing Prediction SpliceAI, a web-based interface ( https://spliceailookup.broadinstitute.org/# , accessed on 1 July 2021), was used for splicing prediction. The \u0394 Score, the maximum probability of splicing where a variant affects the gain or loss of acceptor or donor sites, was obtained for each variant using default parameters. The \u0394 Scores could be obtained only in SNVs and  simple  INDELs; reference or alternative allele in the reference genome is a single base. More detailed information on the \u0394 Score has been previously described [ 14 ]. For the comparison of the performance of the SpliceAI with other  in silico  splicing prediction tools, MES [ 16 ] and SSF [ 17 ], two commonly used algorithms, were conducted using Alamut \u00ae  Visual v.2.15 software (SOPHiA GENETICS, Saint-Sulpice, Switzerland). According to the previous recommendations [ 18 , 40 ], variants were considered as positive for splicing alteration based on the following: (1) MES predicted >15% reduction of the score of the natural splice site AND SSF predicted >5%, or (2) a new splice site was created. If a variant was not placed within the Cartegni region (i.e., 11 bases for the 5\u2032 splice site; from the last 3 exonic to the first 8 intronic bases, and 14 bases for the 3\u2019 splice site; from the last 12 intronic to the first 2 exonic bases) [ 41 ], we only applied SSF prediction as mentioned above. 4.4. Statistical Analysis Using the \u0394 Scores from SpliceAI, ROC curve analysis was conducted based on the method developed by Hanley and McNeil [ 15 ]. The optimal cut-off value of \u0394 Scores was obtained from ROC curve analysis. In further analysis, a single  NF1  variant was defined as SpliceAI prediction \u201cpositive\u201d when the SpliceAI \u0394 Score of the variant was above the cut-off value. PPA, NPA, kappa coefficient, and their 95% CIs were calculated to compare the agreement between SpliceAI and other  in silico  tools (MES/SSF) for predicting the splice effect of the variants. The sensitivity and specificity of SpliceAI and MES/SSF were calculated against the splicing effect using cDNA and gDNA sequencing analysis results. McNemar\u2019s test was used to compare the sensitivity and specificity between SpliceAI and MES/SSF for splice prediction. Using \u0394 Scores (SpliceAI) and reduction ratio (MES/SSF), pairwise comparison of ROC curves between SpliceAI and MES/SSF were also performed. Statistical analyses were performed using MedCalc Statistical Software version 19.0.5 (MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium).  p  < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",

  "introduction": "1. Introduction Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1; OMIM # 162200) is an autosomal dominant inherited disease and one of the most common human genetic disorders, with an incidence of ~1 in 3000 [ 1 ]. NF1 is caused by loss-of-function variants in the tumor suppressor gene,  neurofibromin  1 ( NF1 ; MIM * 613113) [ 1 , 2 ], which is located at chromosome 17q11.2 and contains 60 translated exons spanning over 280 kb of genomic DNA (gDNA) [ 3 , 4 ]. High proportions of the reported  NF1  disease-causing variants are single nucleotide variants (SNVs), small insertions and/or deletions of nucleotides (INDELs) (see Human Gene Mutation Database:  http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ , accessed on 1 July 2021) [ 5 ], which are predicted to result in a premature termination codon. Notably, the frequency of  NF1  splice variants resulting in aberrant mRNA splicing is significantly higher than that of mutated genes in other genetic diseases [ 6 , 7 , 8 ]. To achieve a sufficient detection rate of pathogenic variants, a multistep sequence analysis procedure for both  NF1  gDNA and complementary DNA (cDNA) has been recommended [ 3 , 6 , 9 ]. However, the analysis of  NF1  variants is challenging and burdensome because of the large size of the gene, the presence of several homologous pseudogenes, and a wide mutational spectrum with a lack of mutational hot-spots [ 6 , 10 , 11 ]. In addition, since mRNA is vulnerable to decay [ 12 , 13 ], the yield, purity, and integrity of extracted mRNA may not be sufficient for cDNA sequence analysis. These obstacles may lead to challenges in identifying splicing variants of  NF1 . When relying on a single technique, variant detection rates are approximately 50 to 80% [ 7 , 11 ], compared with 95% in a combined analysis of gDNA and cDNA [ 6 ]. To compensate for the relatively low detection rate of sequencing of only gDNA, predicting the splice effect of  NF1  using  in silico  tools would be beneficial. Although several algorithms are available for splicing prediction, the sensitivity and specificity of these algorithms are not satisfactory. Recently a novel deep residual neural network tool, SpliceAI, was developed and showed a notable performance for predicting splicing altering effects variants [ 14 ]. In contrast to other  in silico  tools that only examine short nucleotide windows adjacent to exon-intron boundaries, SpliceAI learns splicing determinants directly from the primary sequence by evaluating 10,000 nucleotides of the flanking sequence [ 14 ]. However, evaluation of the use SpliceAI for  NF1  variants has not been reported. Herein, we investigated the optimal cut-off value for the SpliceAI score using patient data and compared the performance of SpliceAI with other  in silico  tools for the prediction of splicing aberrations in  NF1 .",
  "results": "2. Results 2.1. Characteristics of Variants A total of 285 unique  NF1  variants were analyzed. Characteristics of the variants are listed in  Table 1 . Among the variants, 73 were confirmed to result in splicing alteration by cDNA and gDNA sequencing analysis. Confirmed splicing variants were mostly located in canonical splice sites; type I splice variants causing exon skipping [ 8 ] were the most common consequence of the splicing effects. One example of splice variants is shown in  Figure 1 . This variant (c.7458-8T>G) had a \u0394 Score of 1.00 and correctly matched with splice defect. Among the confirmed non-splicing variants, SNVs including nonsense, missense, and synonymous variations were most commonly observed. The distribution of SpliceAI \u0394 Scores was notably different between confirmed splicing and non-splicing variants ( Table 1 ). Of the 285  NF1  variants in this study, 52 were novel and 9 of them were splicing variants. More detailed information about the variants in this study is provided in  supplementary information (Table S1) . 2.2. Sensitivity and Specificity Since few reports have examined the cut-off value for \u0394 Score of SpliceAI, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed [ 15 ]. Based on this analysis, the optimal cut-off was determined to be >0.22 with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.975 ( p  < 0.0001, area = 0.5). Under this value, the sensitivity and specificity were determined as 94.5% (95% confidence interval (CI), 86.6\u201398.5%) and 94.3% (95% CI, 90.3\u201397.0%), respectively. The range of \u0394 Score of false negative and false positive was 0.00\u20130.13 and 0.25\u20131.00, respectively ( Table S1 ). Among 30 confirmed splicing variants located in the non-canonical intronic regions, 100% were accurately predicted by SpliceAI. By the combined analysis of MaxEntScan (MES) [ 16 ] and Splice Site Finder-like (SSF) [ 17 ]; abbreviated as MES/SSF further in the manuscript, the sensitivity and specificity were 83.6% (95% CI, 73.1\u201391.2%) and 82.6% (95% CI, 76.8\u201387.4), respectively ( Table 2 ). SpliceAI had a slightly higher sensitivity (difference 11.0%,  p  = 0.0636) and significantly higher specificity (difference 11.8%,  p  = 0.0003) compared with MES/SSF. 2.3. Pairwise Comparison of Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves The AUC of MES/SSF was 0.841 ( p  < 0.0001, area = 0.5); however, SpliceAI showed a significantly larger AUC (difference 0.134,  p  < 0.0001). The ROC curves of SpliceAI and MES/SSF are shown in  Figure 2 . 2.4. Concordance Rate Among the 285 unique variants, 84.2% were concordant between SpliceAI and MES/SSF. The calculated positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA), and kappa value were 68.4% (95% CI, 58.6\u201376.7), 92.5% (95% CI, 87.8\u201395.5), and 0.64 (95% CI, 0.54\u20130.73), respectively ( Table 3 ). Forty-five discordant variants between SpliceAI and MES/SSF were mainly located in exons. All 31 variants with SpliceAI (\u2212) and MES/SSF (+) were confirmed to be splicing negative by cDNA and gDNA sequencing analysis. Among the remaining 14 variants with SpliceAI (+) and MES/SSF (\u2212), 8 variants were confirmed to be splicing positive ( Table 4 ).",
  "discussion": "5. Conclusions This is the largest single-center study on evaluating the use of SpliceAI in an  in silico  study on  NF1  variants, comparing the actual functional effect of a variant through cDNA and gDNA sequencing analysis as well as other  in silico  tools (MES/SSF). Our data indicated that SpliceAI showed moderate agreement with MES/SSF, and outperformed MES/SSF in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Our observations indicate that SpliceAI is a convenient and effective  in silico  splicing prediction tool. These results suggest the potential for SpliceAI in predicting variants in addition to  NF1  in routine genetic laboratories due to its convenience and predictive value.",
