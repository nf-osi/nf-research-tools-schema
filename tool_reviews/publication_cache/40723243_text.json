The conserved gene regulation networks and the correlation between drug responses and the gene network were determined using the WGCNA package v1.69, as described previously [ 16 , 28 ]. The IDACombo package was used to predict the combination efficacy using the drug screen data with the default settings [ 29 ]. 2.2. Cell Culture and Viability Assay pNF cell lines, ipNF95.11bC, ipnNF95.11c, ipNF05.5 Single Clone, and ipNF05.5 Mixed Clones were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Ref: 10566\u2013016; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Ref: 978068\u2013085; Avantor Sciences Central, Radnor, PA, USA) and 1% Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Anti-Anti; Ref: 45240\u2013062; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Cultures were maintained at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 . For combination drug testing, cells at ~80% confluence were seeded into Corning \u00ae  96-well Flat Clear Bottom White Microplates (Ref: 3610; Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA) and allowed to adhere to the 96-well plate overnight. The medium was replaced the next day with serum-free DMEM containing various concentrations of selumetinib (0, 6, 12, and 24 \u00b5M) systematically combined with either SNX-2112 (0, 0.047, 0.07, 0.105, and 0.1575 \u00b5M) or retaspimycin (0, 0.08, 0.16, 0.32, and 0.64 \u00b5M) in a matrix. Cells were incubated with the treatment for 48 h, followed by cell viability analyses. Cell viability was assessed using the CellTiter-Glo \u00ae  Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Cat# G755B/G756B; Promega, Madison, WI, USA), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Luminescence was measured at 573 nm using a microplate reader, and viability was expressed as a percentage of vehicle-treated controls. Drug synergy was evaluated using the Bliss independence model via the SynergyFinder online platform ( https://synergyfinder.org/  (accessed on 7 July 2025). 2.3. In Vivo Drug Test All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with protocol #7457, approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Medical College of Wisconsin. pNF tumors were generated in nude mice by transplanting tumor cells harvested from dorsal root ganglia with  DhhCre;Nf1  configuration. Following harvest, tumors were enzymatically dissociated into a single-cell suspension, and 5 \u00d7 10 f/f ;Luciferase 4  cells were injected into the right sciatic nerve of 6-week-old female nude mice. After confirming tumor engraftment using an in vivo imaging system (IVIS), mice were randomly assigned into three treatment cohorts ( n  = 5 per group): (1) vehicle control, (2) selumetinib monotherapy (50 mg/kg/day, orally), and (3) combination therapy with selumetinib (40 mg/kg/day, orally) and SNX-2112 (30 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneally). Treatments were administered daily for 17 days. The animals were given painkillers before and after surgery according to the protocol. The specific vet team and experimenters observed the experimental mice regularly. At the study endpoint, all mice were euthanized, and tumors were harvested for subsequent analyses. Tumor growth was indicated by bioluminescence. The final sizes were measured by a caliper at Day 18 and calculated by \u00bd \u00d7 length \u00d7 width 2 . 2.4. Statistical Analyses All graph generation and statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism (v10.4.0; GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Results are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM) of three independent biological replicates. Statistical significance was determined by using one-way ANOVA to compare tumor volumes of treatment cohorts with the control. Two-way ANOVA was used to assess the statistical significance of various treatments over time relative to the control. A  p -value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant.",

  "introduction": "1. Introduction Plexiform neurofibroma (pNF) is one of the most clinically challenging manifestations of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a genetic disorder caused by the biallelic loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene. pNFs are characterized as benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors, but often cause significant morbidity due to their size, location, and tendency to infiltrate surrounding tissues. More critically, a subset of pNFs carries a high risk of progressing to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), which are highly aggressive and associated with poor prognosis [ 1 , 2 ]. Until recently, therapeutic options for pNFs remained limited, particularly for surgically inaccessible cases. The approval of selumetinib, a mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor (MEKi), for pediatric pNFs marked a significant therapeutic advancement in pNF treatment, representing the first FDA-approved pharmacological treatment for use in inoperable pNFs [ 3 ]. Selumetinib acts by targeting the hyperactive RAS/MAPK signaling pathway, which is commonly upregulated following loss of neurofibromin function in NF1-deficient cells. Despite clinical promise, selumetinib has demonstrated limited tumor responses, with variable clinical outcomes across patients, and long-term adverse effects in pediatric patients, including gastrointestinal, dermatological and cardiac side effects [ 4 , 5 ]. Reducing toxicity, enhancing the inhibitory effect, and preventing drug resistance are essential for the long-term clinical success of selumetinib and other MEKi, thereby maximizing patient benefit in a larger patient population. Recent studies have highlighted intratumoral heterogeneity in NF1-associated tumors, particularly reflected by the stem-like tumor subpopulation, that may drive treatment resistance and recurrence in patients [ 6 , 7 ]. These stem-like tumor cells exhibit features similar to neural crest stem cells (NCSC), such as self-renewal, slower cell cycle rates and heightened plasticity, which enable them to adapt to new environments or resist standard treatments [ 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ]. Notably, MEK inhibition has shown limited efficacy in eradicating stem-like tumor cells and may inadvertently promote stem-like characteristics by activating WNT or PI3K/AKT signaling pathways in various tumors [ 11 , 12 ]. These findings underscore the need for innovative therapeutic strategies to address these therapeutic challenges in pNFs by effectively suppressing all tumor subpopulations. One emerging approach to address the inefficiencies of monotherapies involves employing combination therapies that target multiple pathways or molecular features of pNF [ 13 ]. A series of drug combination studies has demonstrated effectiveness in NF1-associated MPNSTs, including a combination of a SHP2 inhibitor and MEKi, which targets multiple vulnerabilities within the tumor [ 14 , 15 ]. While these studies predominantly focus on combining kinase inhibitors to interfere with aggressive growth, we rationalize targeting heterogeneous molecular features, especially stem-like features, through rationally selected drug combinations. Following this line of reasoning, we reanalyzed the drug screen data on pNFs to identify candidates that target stem-like regulatory networks and could be used in combination with selumetinib. The drug screen data mining revealed that HSP90i are among the top-ranking drug candidates and are capable of targeting the stem-like gene regulation network [ 16 ]. HSP90 is a molecular chaperone essential for the stability and activity of a wide range of oncogenic proteins, including kinases and transcription factors involved in differentiation, stress response, and survival, and HSP90i have emerged as a promising class of agents in oncology [ 17 ]. Notably, the HSP90 family has been reported to be involved in stem cell differentiation [ 18 ], and HSP90 inhibition has been shown to suppress stem-like features in tumor models [ 19 ]. HSP90i has significant preclinical efficacy against various cancers, and over 22 HSP90i compounds have progressed into clinical trials [ 20 ]. Furthermore, the combination of HSP90i with various chemotherapeutics, immunotherapies, and targeted treatment has shown enhanced efficacy and reduced systemic adverse effects compared to monotherapy protocols [ 21 ]. Currently, there are 18 active clinical trials investigating HSP90 inhibitors in conjunction with other agents, highlighting a trend toward combinatory experimentation [ 20 ]. While HSP90i enhances the sensitivity of tumor cells to MEKi by inhibiting compensatory signaling mechanisms [ 22 , 23 ], its application has rarely been extended to targeting NF1-associated pNFs. Among the HSP90i list we analyzed, SNX-2112 and retaspimycin have shown remarkable efficacy in preclinical studies by destabilizing key oncogenic proteins involved in pNF growth and maintenance [ 24 , 25 , 26 ]. These findings highlight the intriguing prospect of combining HSP90i and selumetinib, which could potentiate the anti-tumor effects of selumetinib monotherapy. The novelty of this approach lies in its potential to overcome the limitations of selumetinib, reduce the dosage, and interfere with heterogeneous tumor molecular features.",

The Combination Targets Heterogeneous Molecular Features Our previous characterization of conserved gene regulation networks in pNF cell lines and primary tumor tissues revealed a series of essential networks [ 16 ]. These conserve networks were defined by the WGCNA algorithms with a number of co-regulated genes within each color-named network. With the gene ontology analysis, we revealed the potential biological relevance with specific network, specifically the magenta reflecting the stem-like signatures [ 16 ]. The original pNF drug screen included six immortalized Schwann cell lines with different NF1 gene mutation statuses [ 30 ]. The ipNF95.11bC (NF1 -/\u2212 ) and ipnNF95.11c (NF1 +/\u2212 ) were immortalized from the same pNF patient using the tumor tissue and tumor-adjacent non-tumor Schwann cells, respectively. ipNF05.5 Mixed Clones ( NF1 ) and ipNF05.5 Single Clone ( \u2212/\u2212 NF1 ) were generated from the same pNF tumor, the former being a pool of 6 different clones derived from ipNF05.5 Single Clone. We reanalyzed the drug screen data that utilized the MIPE 4.0 library to screen drugs against those pNF cell lines [ \u2212/\u2212 31 ]. Complementary patterns were revealed when we correlated the drug responses to different concentrations of selumetinib and HSP90i using the conserved gene regulation network, as shown in  Figure 1 . The responses to selumetinib negatively correlate with the gene expression of conserved gene networks, except for the magenta, indicating that the higher expression of stem-like signatures in magenta is concurrent with increased cell viability upon treatment with selumetinib. This result indicates that selumetinib may not target the stem-like molecular features represented by the magenta network. In contrast, most of the HSP90i are negatively correlated with the magenta network, implying that these drugs may target the stem-like molecular properties associated with this network. To evaluate the drug combination potential between HSP90i and selumetinib, we use the IDAcombo R package to calculate the IDAcombo Score, which predicts the combination benefit based on the individual effects of the two drugs [ 29 ]. The IDAcombo scores between HSP90i and selumetinib, as shown in  Figure 1 , are represented by the top color bar. We hypothesized that HSP90i can enhance the therapeutic efficacy of selumetinib and reduce the dosage of selumetinib in combination. We selected SNX-2112 and retaspimycin for further combination validation. 3.2. SNX-2112 and Retaspimycin Improve the Inhibitory Effect of Selumetinib We employed the ATP-based cell viability assay to assess the efficacy of the combination of selumetinib and SNX-2112 or retaspimycin at varying concentrations ( Figure 2 ). The four cell lines, ipNF05.5 Mixed Clones, ipNF05.5 Single Clone, ipNF95.11bC, and ipnNF95.11c, were utilized to evaluate the effects of drug combinations. The concentrations of selumetinib (0, 6, 12, 24 \u00b5M) and SNX-2112 (0, 0.0466, 0.07, 0.105, 0.1575 \u00b5M) or retaspimycin (0, 0.08, 0.16, 0.32, 0.64 \u00b5M) were systematically combined in a matrix and evaluated in triplicate using 96-well plates. As illustrated in  Figure 2 A,B, treatment with selumetinib alone (the left column) resulted in modest dose-dependent responses in pNF cell lines. The administration of the lowest concentrations of HSP90i, 0.0466 \u00b5M of SNX-2112 or 0.08 \u00b5M of retaspimycin in combination, yielded significantly improved inhibition compared to selumentinib alone. Meanwhile, the combinations exhibited mild inhibitory effects on non-tumor Schwann cell lines, ipnNF95.11c. These findings indicate that the combinations of selumetinib and HSP90i effectively inhibit pNF cell lines. Furthermore, the combination of SNX-2112 dramatically reduces the dosage of selumetinib, achieving a higher level of inhibition or providing more efficient inhibition than selumetinib alone. 3.3. The Combinations Demonstrate Strong Synergistic Effects in Pnf Cell Lines Given the promising inhibitory effects of SNX-2112 and retaspimycin, we further assessed the synergistic effects between selumetinib and the two HSP90i. Utilizing the SynergyPlus web tool [ 32 ], we calculated the Bliss synergy score based on the viabilities of the cell lines treated with the combination matrix ( Figure 3 ). The synergistic effect score cutoff defined by the SynergyPlus algorithm is that the mean synergy score should be more than 10 [ 33 ]. As illustrated in  Figure 3 A,B, the means of synergy scores for the ipNF05.5 Mixed Clones, ipNF05.5 Single Clone, and ipNF95.11bC are all above the cutoff for the combinations. Notably, the highest synergy scores were commonly observed within the combination therapy, even at low concentrations of both agents. The confirmation of synergistic effects in these NF1-deficient cell models further underscores the outperformance of the combination treatment over selumetinib alone. 3.4. The Combination Shrinks the Pnf More than Selumetinib The therapeutic potential of the combination is further evaluated through the orthotopically transplanted mouse pNFs derived from the  DhhCreNf1  model [ f/f ;Luciferase 34 ]. Fifteen transplanted pNFs were generated and then randomly assigned to three cohorts, which were treated with vehicle control, selumetinib (50 mg/kg), or the combination of selumetinib (40 mg/kg) and SNX-2112 (30 mg/kg). The daily treatment started three days after transplantation ( Figure 4 A). On Day 0, bioluminescence from the transplanted tumors was determined using the IVIS system, and the monitoring was repeated twice a week. In the combination cohort, we reduced the dosage of selumetinib by 20% compared to the selumetinib alone cohort. Also, we utilized a substantially lower dosage of SNX-2112 than what has been reported in prior studies [ 24 , 35 , 36 ], which enables us to challenge the hypothesis that the combination treatment may not only enhance its inhibitory effects in vivo but also diminish the dosage of selumetinib. Significant differences were revealed by the comparison of the three cohorts. The growth rate of tumors demonstrated a much stronger inhibitory effect of the combination compared to both selumetinib alone and vehicle control ( Figure 4 B) at different time points. The significantly different tumor sizes at the endpoint on Day 18 are shown in C based on caliper-measured sizes. The tumors of three cohorts are shown in  Figure 4 D, with no significant toxicity reflected by body weight loss.",
  "discussion": "5. Conclusions This study highlights integrated drug mining as an effective strategy to identify therapeutic targets and combinations for pNFs. We demonstrate that combining HSP90 inhibitors, particularly SNX-2112 and retaspimycin, with the MEK inhibitor selumetinib leading to synergistic tumor growth inhibition, outperforming selumetinib alone. This combination not only enhances efficacy but may also allow for dose reduction of selumetinib, potentially minimizing associated toxicities. These findings support the clinical potential of HSP90i in treating pNFs and emphasize the importance of targeting multiple oncogenic pathways to overcome tumor heterogeneity and resistance. Further preclinical evaluations will help guide clinical translation.",
