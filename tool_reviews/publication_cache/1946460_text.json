  "abstract": "Identification and characterization of the neurofibromatosis type 1 protein  product.  DeClue JE(1), Cohen BD, Lowy DR.  Author information: (1)Laboratory of Cellular Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD  20892.  The neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene responsible for von Recklinghausen  neurofibromatosis is related to regulators of ras proteins, and a portion of NF1  that is homologous to the ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) encodes a similar  GTPase-stimulating activity. We have raised rabbit antisera to a bacterially  synthesized 48-kDa peptide corresponding to the GAP-related domain of NF1  (NF1-GRD). These antisera immunoprecipitated the NF1-GRD peptide, and one of  them specifically inhibited the GTPase-stimulating activity of NF1-GRD. The sera  specifically detected a 280-kDa protein in lysates of mouse NIH 3T3 and human  HeLa cells. This protein corresponds to the NF1 gene product, as shown by  several criteria, including partial proteolysis. Subcellular fractionation  revealed that while GAP is predominantly cytoplasmic, all of the NF1 was  recovered in a pellet (100,000 x g) fraction. NF1 was present in a large  molecular mass complex in fibroblast and Schwannoma cell lines and appears to  associate with a very large (400-500 kDa) protein in both cell types. The  relevance of these findings to cellular regulation of p21ras is discussed.  DOI: 10.1073/pnas.88.22.9914 PMCID: PMC52837 PMID: 1946460 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",
