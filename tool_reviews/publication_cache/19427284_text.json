  "abstract": "Mounting evidence suggests that stem/progenitor cells may be the cells of origin for many tumor types. In this issue of Cell Stem Cell, Le et al. (2009) demonstrate that skin-derived precursors (SKPs) can initiate dermal neurofibromas and highlight the importance of the microenvironment in the formation of this complex tumor.",
