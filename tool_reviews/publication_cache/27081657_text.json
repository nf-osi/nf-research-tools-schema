  "title": "A randomized placebo-controlled lovastatin trial for neurobehavioral function in neurofibromatosis I.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Lovastatin has been shown to reverse learning deficits in a mouse model of Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1), a common monogenic disorder caused by a mutation in the Ras-MAPK pathway and associated with learning disabilities. We conducted a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to assess lovastatin's effects on cognition and behavior in patients with NF1. METHOD: Forty-four NF1 patients (mean age 25.7+/-11.6 years; 64% female) were randomly assigned to 14 weeks of lovastatin (N = 23; maximum dose of 80 mg/day for adult participants and 40 mg/day for children) or placebo (N = 21). Based on findings in the mouse model, primary outcome measures were nonverbal learning and working memory. Secondary outcome measures included verbal memory, attention, and self/parent-reported behavioral problems, as well as tolerability of medication. Participants also underwent neuroimaging assessments at baseline and 14 weeks, to determine whether neural biomarkers were associated with treatment response. Linear mixed models assessed for differential treatment effects on outcome measures. RESULTS: Twelve participants dropped from the study prior to completion (8 placebo, 4 lovastatin), resulting in 32 completers (15 placebo, 17 lovastatin). Lovastatin was well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events. Differential improvement favoring lovastatin treatment was observed for one primary (working memory; effect size f (2) = 0.70, P < 0.01) and two secondary outcome measures (verbal memory, f (2) = 0.19, P = 0.02, and adult self-reported internalizing problems, f (2) = 0.26, P = 0.03). Exploratory moderator analyses revealed that higher baseline neural activity in frontal regions was associated with larger treatment effects. INTERPRETATION: These preliminary results suggest beneficial effects of lovastatin on some learning and memory functions, as well as internalizing symptoms in patients with NF1.",

  "methods": "Patients and Methods Design A prospective double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled, randomized 14\u2010week clinical trial was conducted in individuals with NF1 between January 2010 and March 2013. The study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov, trial #  NCT00352599 . Participants Participants were recruited from three primary sources: (1) The Children's Hospital Los Angeles Neurofibromatosis Clinic, a major NF1 referral center for the greater Los Angeles region; (2) local Children's Tumor Foundation and NF Network educational symposia; and (3) websites, both NF\u2010specific and  www.clinicaltrials.gov . Following receipt of thorough verbal and written descriptions of study requirements, and prior to initiation of any study activities, all participants provided written consent or parental permission and child/youth assent following procedures approved by the UCLA Institutional Review Board. Participants were screened and enrolled by a pediatric neurologist (TR), a clinician with experience in caring for individuals with NF1. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Meets the NIH NF1 diagnostic criteria 14  and does not have segmental NF1 ;  (2) 10\u201350 years of age; (3) Full\u2010Scale IQ of at least 70, as determined by the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI 15 ); (4) Not currently taking a statin medication; (5) Not suffering from hypercholesterolemia, based on National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) guidelines 16 ; (6) Normal hepatic, muscle enzyme (CPK), hematologic, renal function and cholesterol lab values on initial screening; (7) Not taking any additional medications with potential interactions with lovastatin; (8) No comorbid major neurological or psychiatric disorder (e.g., epilepsy, bipolar disorder, psychotic illness, major depression); (9) No evidence of intracranial pathology (other than asymptomatic optic pathway glioma); (10) Female participants could not be pregnant or lactating; sexually active females were required to use adequate birth control measures during the study and undergo regular urine pregnancy testing; (11) Sufficient English fluency to avoid invalidating research measures. Participants with a clinical diagnosis of ADHD were included, but those subjects on medication for ADHD treatment were required to continue the same medication dose throughout the duration of the study (Table  1 ). Additionally, none of the subjects included in the study had other NF1\u2010related gliomas.

Separate randomizations were performed for adult ( n  = 30) and child ( n  = 14) study participants to ensure that treatment assignment was balanced by age. Randomization was performed by the UCLA investigational pharmacist, who assigned participants in the order of their enrollment in the trial and dispensed the medication. Study participants, their parents, and all study investigators and personnel were blind to the treatment allocation. The randomization list was only accessible to the senior database programmer and the pharmacist. Participants' treatment allocation and test results remained de\u2010identified until all follow\u2010up was completed. Subjects were treated once daily for 14 weeks with lovastatin or placebo. Adults receiving lovastatin were administered doses of 40 mg/day for week 1, 60 mg/day for week 2 and 80 mg/day for weeks 3\u201314. Children and adolescents (age 10\u201317) were administered 20 mg/day for week 1, 30 mg for week 2 and 40 mg for weeks 3\u201314. This dosing schedule was based on guidelines for adults 17  and children 18  with hypercholesterolemia, respectively. The capsules containing placebo or lovastatin were identical in color, shape, and size. Medication safety monitoring and adherence Following enrollment, participants underwent a physical examination, including height, weight, and vital signs, conducted by the study physician (TR) in order to verify the NF1 diagnosis based on NIH NF1 diagnostic criteria 14  and to ensure that there were no medical contraindications to participation. Baseline laboratory studies included: complete blood count (CBC), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), bilirubin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), glucose, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), and lipid panels. Menstruating female participants had urine pregnancy tests. Follow\u2010up visits occurred at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 14 weeks following treatment initiation and included a comprehensive physical examination, open\u2010ended adverse event inquiry, documentation of concomitant medications, and repeated laboratory studies. A final study visit occurred at 18 weeks, 1 month after cessation of medication/placebo therapy, and included a final physical examination as well as adverse event monitoring. An independent study physician monitored laboratory results in parallel with study visits to insure ongoing participant safety as well as keeping the treating physician blinded to the treatment condition. Medication compliance was assessed at the week 4, 8, and 14\u2010week visits. Participants were judged medication\u2010compliant when they took at least 80% of their study medication during the intervention period of 14 weeks, which was assessed by counting returned capsules and with a pill diary. General lovastatin and placebo toxicity were monitored throughout the trial using standard guidelines ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ), and were rated as being not drug related, possibly drug related, or definitely drug related prior to unblinding. Criteria for study discontinuation included: (1) Noncompliance with administration of lovastatin or placebo tablets, and/or with required follow\u2010up; (2) development of a medical condition or initiation of another medication with which lovastatin is contra\u2010indicated; (3) development of significant drug toxicity (defined as grade 2 or higher toxicity which persists after 10 days off lovastatin); (4) pregnancy in a female participant. Outcome measures Outcome measures were assessed at baseline and after 14 weeks of treatment. Parallel versions of tests were applied when available to reduce the impact of practice effects. Primary outcomes were two neuropsychological measures that were most analogous to statin\u2010responsive tests in  Nf1  mice, specifically: the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test \u2013 Revised (BVMT, Immediate and Delayed 19 ; nonverbal declarative memory) and the Letter\u2010Number Sequencing task (LNS 20 ; working memory). For the secondary outcomes, we selected neuropsychological and behavioral tests to assess domains that are differentially affected in NF1 patients, that is, attention, learning and memory, and social behavior 2 ,  3 : Digit Cancellation (attention/inhibitory control) 21 , Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT; verbal declarative memory 22 ), WISC\u2010III Object Assembly (visuoconstructive ability) 23 , and Internalizing and Externalizing symptoms, as well as the Attention, Thought and Social Problems subscales from either the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; self\u2010 and parent\u2010report) or Young Adult Self Report (YASR) 24 ,  25 . Due to the exploratory nature of this trial, additional tertiary neurocognitive and behavioral measures (deemed less central to the characteristic NF1 cognitive profile) included: the Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB) Mazes 26 , Delis\u2013Kaplan Executive Function Scale (D\u2010KEFS) verbal fluency (category and letter fluency) 27  and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF; General Executive Composite (GEC) score) 28 . All neuropsychological tests were administered and scored by trained psychometricians blind to treatment condition. Functional imaging measures were also collected at baseline and 14\u2010week follow\u2010up to explore its potential both as a predictor of eventual treatment response and as an intermediate marker of treatment\u2010related change. Image acquisition All scanning was carried out on identical Siemens 3 Tesla Tim Trio (Erlangen, Germany) MRI scanners using identical protocols at either the UCLA Brain Mapping Center or the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience (CCN). Measures of brain structure were obtained using T1\u2010weighted anatomical images acquired with an MPRAGE sequence with the following acquisition parameters: TR/TE/TI = 2300/2.89/900 ms; flip angle = 9 degrees; slice thickness = 1.20 mm, with a 240 \u00d7 256 acquisition matrix. Spatial capacity working memory (SCAP) task A spatial working memory functional MRI paradigm, designed to be analogous to the behavioral tasks used in the mouse model, was also administered. We previously found hypoactivation of fronto\u2010parietal neural circuitry using this task in untreated NF1 patients 29 . Specifically, subjects were shown a target array of 1, 3, 5, or 7 yellow circles positioned pseudo\u2010randomly around a central fixation, as detailed in Glahn et al 30 . After a variable delay, subjects were shown a single green circle and asked to indicate whether that circle was in the same position as one of the target circles. Participants took part in a behavioral training session immediately prior to the one\u2010hour scan. In the scanner, trial events included a 2\u2010sec target array, 1.5, 3, and 4.5\u2010sec(s) delay, 3\u2010sec probe array, and a jittered (average of 2 sec) intertrial interval (ITI) with a fixation. During the task, 291 functional T2*\u2010weighted echoplanar images (EPIs) were collected with the following parameters: slice thickness = 4 mm, 34 slices, TR = 2 sec, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 90\u00b0, matrix 192 \u00d7 192, FOV = 192 mm. Functional MRI analysis fMRI data analyses were performed using tools from the FMRIB software library ( www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl ), version 5.0, using the same processing steps as described in our prior publications 29 ,  31 , including spatial smoothing, temporal filtering, and a three\u2010step registration process in which EPI images were first registered to the matched\u2010bandwidth high\u2010resolution scan, then to the structural image, and finally into standard (Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)) space, using nonlinear transformations 32 . Thirty\u2010seven subjects completed a baseline SCAP fMRI scan (18 statin, 19 placebo), of whom 5 were excluded due to an artifact in structural scan ( n  = 2) or excessive motion (translational motion >2 mm or 3 or more spikes greater than 1 mm in at least one scan;  n  = 3), resulting in 32 subjects (17 lovastatin, 15 placebo) in the baseline fMRI analysis. Thirty subjects (15 statin, 15 placebo) completed a follow\u2010up fMRI scan, of whom 10 were excluded for the following reasons: artifact in structural scan ( n  = 2), low signal to noise ratio (SNR;  n  = 2), excessive motion ( n  = 3), or poor registration between baseline and follow\u2010up scans ( n  = 3). Thus, 20 subjects were available for analysis at follow\u2010up (10 lovastatin, 10 control). Demographics of the subjects with usable MRI data did not differ from those of the overall sample. Further, there were no differences in motion (mean framewise displacement) between treatment groups ( P  = 0.20). Standard model fitting was conducted for all subjects, as in Shilyansky et al. 29 . Briefly, for each subject, first\u2010level models included contrasts for each individual load and delay condition. Our primary analyses focused on the All\u2010Loads contrast. The six motion parameters and temporal derivatives of all regressors were included as covariates of no interest to improve statistical sensitivity. Although no differences between scanners were found in any preliminary analyses ( P  > 0.05 for all comparisons), we included scanner as a covariate in subsequent group\u2010level analyses to ensure that any subtle between\u2010scanner differences were controlled. Bilateral 8 mm spherical regions of interest (ROIs) were used to extract percent signal change from the following regions at each timepoint: bilateral Brodmann's Area 10, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), frontal eye fields, and parietal cortex, as well as two default mode regions which served as control regions, the ventromedial PFC and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC; Fig.  1 \n ) . ROIs were created in MNI\u2010152 space and centered on peak voxel activation from the All\u2010Loads contrast in our previous study 29 . Average percent signal change values corresponding to an 8\u2010sec stimulus convolved with a gamma hemodynamic response function (HRF) from the All\u2010Loads contrast were extracted from baseline and follow\u2010up scans separately 33 . Figure 1 Regions of Interest for Spatial Capacity Working Memory ( SCAP ) Functional  MRI  Task. Statistical analyses Prior to performing the primary tests for treatment effects,  t \u2010tests and chi\u2010squared tests were used to compare the lovastatin and placebo groups on baseline demographic and clinical measures to confirm the success of randomization. Similar tests were used to check for differential dropout between the treatment arms and to identify other correlates of early discontinuation. For each of the primary and secondary outcome measures, we fit a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with group (lovastatin, placebo), time (baseline, 14 weeks), and a group\u2010by\u2010time interaction to test for differential treatment effects (primary RCT analyses). Age\u2010adjusted scores were used for all cognitive and behavioral measures. For the BVMT\u2010R, age\u2010appropriate published normative data were only available for participants aged 18 and up; thus, for child participants, we applied norms from our large database of healthy control participants in a multisite project (North American Prodromal Longitudinal Study; U01MH081902 34 ). For outcome measures where a significant treatment effect was established, follow\u2010up moderator analyses were conducted to determine whether baseline features of the participants influenced response to lovastatin treatment, by adding those factors and their interactions with treatment group and time to the original GLMMs. In particular, we predicted that: (1) younger participants would show stronger treatment effects due to increased malleability, and (2) participants with larger baseline deficits would experience greater treatment benefits. Parallel exploratory analyses were conducted for the neuroimaging measures, to test for differential change over time in brain structure and function in the above\u2010specified ROIs. For all analyses of neuroimaging measures, we controlled for age, gender and scanner location by including them as covariates in GLMMs. Finally, we examined whether greater brain volume and/or increased neural activity at baseline was associated with increased treatment response by adding them as moderators to primary models. Because child and adult participants were assessed with different versions of the CBCL (i.e., participants aged 10\u201317 received the parent\u2010report and child self\u2010report forms, whereas participants age 18 and up received the YASR form), these measures were analyzed separately. We did not correct for multiple comparisons given that: (1) there were only 2 primary and 4 secondary outcome measures which were specified  a priori ; and (2) the neuropsychological and behavioral outcome measures are potentially intercorrelated. Multiple comparison correction would make it very difficult to detect a possible effect of treatment in this proof\u2010of\u2010concept exploratory investigation. Thus, we opted to guard against type II error.",
