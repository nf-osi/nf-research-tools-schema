  "title": "COMT Val(158)Met Polymorphism Is Associated with Verbal Working Memory in Neurofibromatosis Type 1.",
  "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is a neurogenetic disease marked by multiple cognitive and learning problems. Genetic variants may account for phenotypic variance in NF1. Here, we investigated the association between the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val(158)Met polymorphism and working memory and arithmetic performance in 50 NF1 individuals. A significant association of the COMT polymorphism was observed only with verbal working memory, as measured by the backward digit-span task with an advantageous performance for Met/Met carriers. To study how genetic modifiers influence NF1 cognitive performance might be of importance to decrease the unpredictability of the cognitive profile among NF1 patients.",

  "methods": "Methods and Procedures Participants Fifty participants with NF1 [19 subjects from 6- to 18-year-old (11.89 \u00b1 4.11 years; 11 male) and 31 adults from 19- to 50-year-old (30.97 \u00b1 8.81 years; 13 male)] were enrolled in this study. All individuals were recruited from a specialized clinic in neurofibromatosis at the Hospital of the Federal University of Minas Gerais. NF1 diagnosis followed the criteria specified by the  National Institutes of Health statement [NIH] (1988)  statement. Besides NF1, it was not reported by the participants or their families any history of genetic, neurological, or psychiatric disorders. This study is part of a research project that seeks to investigate molecular mechanisms of NF1 approved by the Federal University of Minas Gerais ethics committee. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants and/or from their parents according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Working Memory Assessment All participants completed the age-appropriate digit-span subtest of the Wechsler Adult and Children Intelligence Scales ( Wechsler, 2002 ,  2004 ) and the Corsi block-tapping task ( Kessels et al., 2000 ,  2008 ). Both are span tasks where the examiner presents a growing sequence of numbers (digit-span) or moves on a wooden board (Corsi block-tapping). The subject must repeat the same sequence ( forward  versions of the tasks) or say/do it from the last to the first item (a  backward  version of the tasks). For each span (starting at two items), the examiner presented two different sequences. The tasks are stopped when the subject is not able to correctly repeat two sequences of same span length. We used the product of the maximum span length and number of correct trials as test measures ( Kessels et al., 2008 ). This strategy usually produces more representative measures of working memory variability than the number of correct trials or the maximum span achieved. IQ Assessment General intellectual functioning was assessed by the third version of the Brazilian Wechsler Intelligence Scales (WAIS-III or WISC-III for adults and children, respectively;  Wechsler, 2002 ,  2004 ). School Performance Assessment We adopted the arithmetic subtest from the School Achievement Test ( Stein, 1994 ), as an objective measure of school performance. The School Achievement Test is a standard measure of academic skills including reading, writing, and arithmetic. The test was developed for the Brazilian population following the country educational agenda and have adequate normative data for grades 1\u20136. Participants\u2019 scores on arithmetic were categorized in low-achievement or normal-high-achievement according to the guidelines proposed by  Oliveira-Ferreira et al. (2012)  and the total years of formal education showed by each participant. Socioeconomic Status Assessment Socioeconomic status (SES) was assessed using the Brazilian Criterion for Economic Classification (CCEB) according to the criteria established by the Brazilian Research Enterprises Association ( Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Empresas de Pesquisa [ABEP], 2013 ). The CCEB estimates the purchasing power of families living in urban areas. It includes nine items that measure the available resources at home and one item that judges the education level of the householder, resulting in a scale ranging from 0 to 46 points, and segmentation into eight economic classes. These economic classes can be divided into three larger classes: \u201chigh\u201d (A and B classes; median monthly household income from U$2349 to U$4152), \u201cmiddle\u201d (C class; median monthly household income from U$514 to U$1190) and \u201clow\u201d (D and E classes; median monthly household income of U$348). Eighteen NF1 participants (36%) were classified as high class, 27 (54%) as middle class, and five (10%) as low class. COMT Genotyping The polymorphism was assessed by a standard procedure previously reported ( Pereira et al., 2012 ). Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples using the high salt method ( Lahiri and Nurnberger, 1991 ). The COMT functional polymorphism (val158met,  rs4680 ) was purchased in a made-to-order from Applied Biosystems \u00ae . Genotyping was performed using a real-time PCR system in the allelic discrimination mode (Stratagene Mx3005 \u2013 MxPro QPCR-Software, 2007) using the TaqMan Genotyping Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). PCR parameters included an initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 50 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. Each reaction contained 3.5 \u03bcl of mix, 0.1 \u03bcl of the probe, 3.4 \u03bcl of deionized water, and 1.0 \u03bcl of DNA. Researchers involved in genotyping were blind to neuropsychological results, and researchers participating in neuropsychological assessments were blind to the genotyping results. COMT genotype was coded as a categorical variable (Val/Val, Met/Val, and Met/Met) for further analysis. Statistical Procedures Most of our data was non-normally distributed. The use of data transformation procedures (square, cube, square root, and logarithm) did not succeed in normalizing the data distribution. We then adopted non-parametric tests for the following procedures. Non-parametric univariate comparisons performed by the Kruskal\u2013Wallis tests did not show differences between age (\u03c7 2  = 3.21,  p  = 0.201), years of formal education (\u03c7 2  = 0.65,  p  = 0.721), SES (\u03c7 2  = 1.03,  p  = 0.596), or intelligence (\u03c7 2  = 1.83,  p  = 0.400) between the genotype groups. In this sense, we compared the three  COMT  genotypes (Val/Val, Val/Met, Met/Met) in the digit-span and Corsi block-tapping tasks by the same statistical procedure. To ensure results\u2019 consistency, we analyzed the  p -values along with the effect sizes (\u201c r \u201d conversion computed by dividing the resulting \u201c Z \u201d by the square root of the total sample size). This method can be interpreted as a correlational coefficient, and effect sizes higher than 0.3 can be considered moderate and larger than 0.5 interpreted as large according to  Cohen\u2019s (1988)  guidelines.  Post hoc  comparisons between each  COMT  genotype were corrected by the Dunn\u2013Bonferroni method. The comparison between the two groups defined by the school achievement and the  COMT  genotype was performed by a chi-square test. A secondary analysis investigated the association between  COMT  genotype, IQ, and working memory with arithmetic\u2019s performance. We stratified the participants based on the School Achievement Test performance and used multinomial stepwise logistic regression models to assess whether low school achievement was associated with neurobiological and cognitive measures. All statistical procedures were performed in SPSS 20.0.",
