  "title": "Distinctive epigenomic alterations in NF1-deficient cutaneous and plexiform neurofibromas drive differential MKK/p38 signaling.",
  "abstract": "Benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors are the clinical hallmark of Neurofibromatosis Type 1. They account for substantial morbidity and mortality in NF1. Cutaneous (CNF) and plexiform neurofibromas (PNF) share nearly identical histology, but maintain different growth rates and risk of malignant conversion. The reasons for this disparate clinical behavior are not well explained by recent genome or transcriptome profiling studies. We hypothesized that CNFs and PNFs are epigenetically distinct tumor types that exhibit differential signaling due to genome-wide and site-specific methylation events. We interrogated the methylation profiles of 45 CNFs and 17 PNFs from NF1 subjects with the Illumina EPIC 850K methylation array. Based on these profiles, we confirm that CNFs and PNFs are epigenetically distinct tumors with broad differences in higher-order chromatin states and specific methylation events altering genes involved in key biological and cellular processes, such as inflammation, RAS/MAPK signaling, actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, and oxytocin signaling. Based on our identification of two separate DMRs associated with alternative leading exons in MAP2K3, we demonstrate differential RAS/MKK3/p38 signaling between CNFs and PNFs. Epigenetic reinforcement of RAS/MKK/p38 was a defining characteristic of CNFs leading to pro-inflammatory signaling and chromatin conformational changes, whereas PNFs signaled predominantly through RAS/MEK. Tumor size also correlated with specific CpG methylation events. Taken together, these findings confirm that NF1 deficiency influences the epigenetic regulation of RAS signaling fates, accounting for observed differences in CNF and PNF clinical behavior. The extension of these findings is that CNFs may respond differently than PNFs to RAS-targeted therapeutics raising the possibility of targeting p38-mediated inflammation for CNF treatment.",

  "methods": "Methods Trial participants and sample collection 45 cutaneous neurofibromas, 17 plexiform neurofibromas, and 9 normal skin and nerve samples were collected from individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of Neurofibromatosis Type 1. These samples were collected prospectively under an approved Spectrum Health/Van Andel Research Institute IRB protocol (SH/VAI IRB#2014\u2013295)\u00a0( NCT02777775 ). Additional specimens were analyzed according to ethical standards and under a Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) institutional review board (IRB)-approved protocol (JH IRB # J1649, PI\u00a0Pratilas). The JH NF1 biospecimen repository is supported by a grant from the Neurofibromatosis Therapeutic Acceleration Program (NTAP,\u00a0n-tap.org), to C.A.P. Analysis by Sage Bionetworks is supported through the Neurofibromatosis Therapeutic Acceleration Program (NTAP,\u00a0n-tap.org). Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Tumor samples were isolated by microdissection to remove adjacent normal tissue then snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u2212\u00a080\u00a0\u00b0C. Quality parameters included assessment of percent content (>\u200995%) and viability (>\u200990% nuclear viability) by H/E staining. Biospecimen handling was performed according to\u00a0BRISQ guidelines. 5mC interrogation by Infinium\u00a0MethylationEPIC\u00a0array To extract DNA, frozen tissue was manually dissected into small pieces and homogenized by bead beating (Lysing Matrix D;\u00a0MP Biomedicals)\u00a0in\u00a0UltraPure\u00a0phenol:chloroform:isoamyl\u00a0alcohol (ThermoFisher) according to the manufacture\u2019s protocol.\u00a0DNA was quantified by Qubit fluorometry (Life Technologies) and 500\u00a0ng of DNA from each sample was bisulfite converted using the\u00a0Zymo\u00a0EZ DNA Methylation Kit (Zymo\u00a0Research, Irvine, CA USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol using the specified modifications for the Illumina Infinium Methylation Assay. After conversion, all bisulfite reactions were cleaned using the Zymo-Spin binding\u00a0columns and\u00a0eluted in 12\u00a0uL\u00a0of Tris buffer. Following elution, BS converted DNA was processed through the EPIC array protocol. The EPIC array contains\u2009>\u2009850\u00a0K probes querying methylation sites including CpG islands and non-island regions,\u00a0RefSeq\u00a0genes, ENCODE open chromatin, ENCODE transcription factor binding sites, and FANTOM5 enhancers. To perform the assay, 7uL of converted DNA was denatured with 1ul 0.4\u00a0N sodium hydroxide. DNA was then amplified, hybridized to the EPIC bead chip, and an extension reaction was performed using\u00a0fluorophore-labeled nucleotides per the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.\u00a0Array\u00a0beadchips\u00a0were scanned on the Illumina\u00a0iScan\u00a0platform and probe specific calls were made using Illumina Genome Studio software. EPIC methylation array data pre-processing Data were analyzed using a modified workflow that is similar to the\u00a0ChAMP\u00a0methylation array analysis procedure in R (v3.5.1). Briefly, samples were filtered for probes with poor or skewed intensities (detection  p -value\u2009<\u20090.01) and entire samples were removed from the dataset if they contained\u2009>\u200910% failed probes. One sample exceeded the aforementioned filtering criteria and was removed from the dataset resulting in 70 total samples. Next, probes that have previously been identified to skew downstream differential methylation analyses (SNP probes, cross-reactive probes with other genomic regions, etc.) were removed in addition to probes that target sex chromosomes [ 48 ]. Next, a single-sample normalization method (ssNOOB) was applied to each sample to normalize and remove background signal from the data prior to downstream analyses (Supplemental Fig.\u00a0 4 ) [ 49 ]. Sources of technical variation were found to significantly ( p \u2009<\u20090.05) contribute to the variation explained in the first couple principle components in addition to tissue effects based on SVD analysis as implemented in ChAMP (v2.18.3) and corrected using the\u00a0sva\u00a0(v3.30.1) package in R for visualization purposes only. The results of this procedure for the first 11 PCs can be found in Supplemental Fig.\u00a0 5 . Technical variation was modeled as either fixed or random effects on the uncorrected data in the differential methylation analysis described below. Further, prior to differential methylation calling, additional SNP and CpH probes were removed using ChAMP (v2.18.3) using the default parameters for the function rmSNPandCH. In total, 717,148 probes were analyzed for differential methylation across tissue types. Differential methylation analysis Differentially methylated loci between cutaneous and plexiform neurofibromas were identified using a hierarchical generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) approach with a logit link function as implemented in\u00a0glmmTMB\u00a0(v0.2.2) on the pre-processed beta-values. Partially repeated tissue sampling was modeled as a random effect with patient nested within methylation array slide unless specified otherwise. Group-level differences were determined using a likelihood ratio test (LRT) with a significance threshold of  q \u2009<\u20090.05. False discovery rate adjustment was done using the\u00a0Benjamini\u2013Hochberg procedure. Models were filtered out for downstream analysis if they failed to converge. In total, 31,201 probes were found to be differentially methylated between cutaneous and plexiform neurofibromas. Differentially methylated regions were called using\u00a0DMRcate\u00a0(v1.18.0). Results from\u00a0glmmTMB\u00a0were wrangled into a suitable data structure as input for\u00a0DMRcate\u00a0by using the Wald statistic as the stat and a quasi-beta fold-change using the exponentiated model estimates for each probe. Default parameters were used for\u00a0DMRcate\u00a0with the bandwidth scaling factor (C parameter) set to 2. To identify differentially methylated loci associated with cutaneous neurofibroma size, a GLMM with a logit link was fitted, adjusting for age and sex differences and a random intercept term for partially repeated tissue sampling. Significant associations ( q \u2009<\u20090.05) between CNF size in millimeters and probe-level methylation were determined as described above. A total of 188 loci were found to be significant. Positive or negative correlations were computed on significant probes using Kendall\u2019s Tau. False discovery rate was controlled using the\u00a0Benjamini\u2013Hochberg procedure and significant correlations were determined at a  q \u2009<\u20090.05 threshold. Significantly correlated probes were filtered on a delta Beta-value (maximum Beta-value minus the minimum Beta-value) of 0.2, resulting in 34 loci. Inference of chromatin conformation from EPIC methylation arrays Chromatin compartments were computed at 100\u00a0kb resolution as previously described and implemented in\u00a0compartmap\u00a0(v1.65.71). Briefly, pre-processed M-values were subset to \u201copen sea\u201d CpG probes (at least 4\u00a0kb away from annotated CpG island) and masked probes that were found in at least 50% of samples were imputed using k-nearest neighbor via the impute (v1.59.0) R package. Next, loci were median summarized in 100\u00a0kb bins. Group-level compartments were inferred by computing Pearson correlations of summarized bins and the first principal component of the correlation matrix. A/B compartments correspond to positive (open chromatin) and negative (closed chromatin) eigenvalues, respectively. Genome-wide discordant compartments were identified by comparing the sign of the eigenvalue for overlapping genomic bins and filtering out those with small absolute eigenvalues (>\u20090.02). In total, we identified 2937 discordant chromatin compartments between plexiform and cutaneous neurofibromas. Results were plotted using\u00a0circlize\u00a0(v0.4.8). Pathway and GO term enrichment Enrichment of pathways and gene ontology (GO) terms was performed using the\u00a0gometh\u00a0function within the\u00a0missMethyl\u00a0(v1.16.0) package in R. Briefly,\u00a0gometh\u00a0considers the relatively uneven density of loci covered on the Infinium methylation arrays and utilizes this information when computing enrichment, similar to the approach\u00a0goseq\u00a0uses for RNA-seq. Significant\u00a0CpGs\u00a0were identified as described above and the background probe set was derived following pre-processing. Significant GO terms and KEGG pathways were determined using a  q \u2009<\u20090.05 threshold. Results were plotted using ggplot2 (v3.2.1). Tissue purity estimates Tissue purity was estimated by PAMES (v0.2.3) and annotations built for computing informative sites using IlluminaHumanMethylationEPICanno.ilm10b2.hg19 (v0.6.0). Cutaneous neurofibromas were compared against normal skin samples and plexiform neurofibromas were compared against normal nerve. Results were plotted using ggplot2 (v3.2.1). Copy number estimation from EPIC methylation arrays Copy number alterations were computed using\u00a0SeSAMe\u00a0(v1.3.2) with minor modifications for plotting functionality [ 50 ]. Briefly, raw data were processed using the \u201copen\u00a0SeSAMe\u201d procedure, producing a signal set object. Next, samples were segmented (50\u00a0kb bins) and called for copy number differences, comparing CNFs to normal skin and PNFs to normal nerve using the cnSegmentation function with default parameters in SeSAMe. The genome annotation used was hg19 and relevant annotations are pulled in automatically from the sesameData package by the cnSegmentation function. Data were visualized using the log2 ratio of per-sample signal over the reference. RNA-sequencing data analysis Paired-end, raw neurofibroma and plexiform neurofibroma RNA-seq data were downloaded from syn4939902. Sequencing lanes were merged, followed by alignment with STAR (v2.7.0f) to b37 (downloaded from the GATK resource bundle\u2014 https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/download/bundle ), using the\u00a0Gencode\u00a0v19 annotations). Alignment was performed using default parameters with the following modifications: -twopassMode\u00a0Basic, -outSAMtype\u00a0BAM\u00a0SortedByCoordinate, and -quantMode\u00a0GeneCounts. Reverse-stranded gene counts were read into R (v3.6.1) using\u00a0edgeR\u00a0(v3.27.14), excluding sample 2-025 due to sample quality. Gene counts were restricted to known, protein coding genes and lincRNA. Samples were further filtered to genes that had greater than 1 count per million (CPM) in at least 3 samples. Libraries were normalized using the trimmed mean of M-values method. Dimensionality reduction was performed using the\u00a0prcomp\u00a0function (v3.6.1) on the filtered log2 CPM and plotted using ggplot2 (v3.2.1). Western blotting For protein analysis, samples were divided into methylation high, methylation intermediate, and methylation low groups based on the beta-values across MAP2K3 DMR1 and samples from each group were randomly chosen as a representative subset of the discovery cohort. Protein lysates were prepared by manually homogenizing frozen tissue in RIPA buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Roche). Proteins were separated on a 4\u201320% TGX SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Invitrogen). Blots were blocked in 5% dry milk in TBST buffer (20\u00a0mmol/L Tris\u2013HCl pH 7.4, 150\u00a0mmol/L NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) and incubated at 4\u00a0\u00b0C overnight in primary antibody; MKK3 (Cell Signaling #5674), p38 (Cell Signaling #9219), phospho-p38 (Cell Signaling # 4511), phospho-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling #9101), and \u03b2-Actin (Cell Signaling #3700). Densitometry was done in ImageJ. Data availability Raw and processed EPIC array data are available from Synapse: syn4939910. Raw RNA-seq\u00a0fastq\u00a0data were downloaded from syn4939902. Statistical methods Pairwise comparisons of beta-regressions calculated by betareg (v3.1\u20132) were done using emmeans (v1.4.2). For correlation analysis, normality was first assessed by a Shapiro\u2013Wilk normality test. Data following a normal distribution were analyzed by Pearson\u2019s product\u2013moment correlation, while non-normally distributed data were analyzed by Spearman\u2019s rank correlation rho. For all correlation plots, data were fit by stat_smooth using loess with span\u2009=\u20091 using ggplot2 (v3.2.1). All analyses were done using R (v3.6.1).

  "introduction": "Introduction Approximately 1 in 3000 live births are affected by the tumor predisposition condition, Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) making it the most common single gene-inherited condition in humans. One of the clinical hallmarks and diagnostic sine qua non of NF1 is the formation of benign peripheral nerve tumors called neurofibromas. Neurofibromas are a major cause of disfigurement, pain, and morbidity in NF1. These issues are predominantly attributable to two types of neurofibromas: dermal or cutaneous neurofibromas (CNFs) that develop in the skin,\u00a0and plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) that arise from nerves situated in deeper anatomic compartments. Even though CNFs and PNFs share similar histology, they are\u00a0pathophysiologically\u00a0distinct.\u00a0NF1-related PNFs are associated with the development of high-grade malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), which are the leading cause of death of NF1 patients [ 1 ]. In contrast, CNFs exhibit slower growth rates and do not have malignant potential [ 2 \u2013 4 ]. Although CNFs do not become malignant, these benign tumors are often painful and disfiguring. These critical distinctions between CNFs and PNFs are not explained by genomic and transcriptomic studies that failed to identify consistent alterations in these tumors [ 5 ]. NF1  loss of heterozygosity is thought to be the initiating event in CNF and PNF formation, making  NF1  the most commonly mutated gene in these tumors. Other genetic alterations have also been described but are inconsistent between and across tumor types. Previous genomic studies observed that approximately one third of CNFs exhibit focal chromosomal imbalance; however, there were no consistent chromosomal microstructure alterations among the samples analyzed [ 6 ]. Expression profiling studies have yielded mixed results as to whether CNFs and PNFs can be distinguished based on gene expression alone [ 5 ,  7 ]. It is important to note that these studies were not powered specifically to address differences between CNFs and PNFs, but rather focused on distinguishing PNFs and MPNSTs. Even though CNFs and PNFs arise in distinct anatomic sites, mouse models have demonstrated that CNFs and PNFs share a common cell of origin in Schwann cell progenitors (i.e., skin-derived precursor (SKP) [ 8 ] or GAP43\u2009+\u2009PLP\u2009+\u2009precursors) [ 9 ]. Currently, it is not well understood how tumor microenvironment impacts neurofibroma progression [ 10 ], however inflammation from  NF1 \u00a0haploinsufficient\u00a0mast cells is requisite for PNF development [ 11 ]. Prior work examining epigenetic modifications in CNFs and PNFs has also been confounded by the lack of tissue- and patient-matched controls, which are not always available in the context of  NF1  deficiency. Thus, there are insufficient data to adequately explain why CNFs and PNFs exhibit such distinct clinical behavior. In this study, we performed genome-wide DNA methylation profiling using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip platform on a large discovery cohort of CNFs and PNFs. We demonstrate that CNFs and PNFs maintain epigenetically distinct profiles that are distinguishable based on both site-specific and chromosome-wide methylation differences. This work stands in contrast to prior studies that failed to identify differential methylation at the  NF1  locus in peripheral nerve sheath tumors, and were underpowered to identify signaling impacts based on genome-wide methylation differences [ 12 ][ 12 ]. Our work confirms that broad and distinct patterns of methylation result in differential signaling between CNFs and PNFs, as well as in the regulation of tumor size. Specifically, two differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the\u00a0 MAP2K3 \u00a0and an upstream regulatory site for\u00a0 MAPK14  were significantly altered between CNFs and PNFs leading to increased MKK3 and p38 expression. This epigenetic reinforcement of MKK3 and p38 expression also led to activation of both p38 and ERK based on an arbitrary subset of CNF patient samples within the discovery cohort. The MKK3/ p38 signaling axis is\u00a0linked to both inflammation and pain signaling, as well as chromatin conformational changes through SWI/SNF complex regulation. ERK activation is not a usual consequence of MKK3/p38 activation due to conserved inhibitory feedback pathways. Taken together, our data confirm that epigenetic regulation of key RAS signaling genes results in disordered growth, inflammation and signaling in the context of NF1 deficiency. These findings also confirm the importance of epigenetic regulation in CNF tumor initiation and progression, as well as a potentially druggable signaling axis in MKK3/p38/ERK.",
  "results": "Results CNFs and PNFs\u00a0have\u00a0distinct global methylation profiles CNFs are benign, skin-based neoplasms. These tumors typically arise in puberty and increase in number throughout adulthood. NF1 patients can develop between several to thousands of CNFs that cover significant portions of the body. Even though the size of CNFs can vary in NF1 patients (Fig.\u00a0 1 a), CNFs are associated with limited growth potential (typically\u2009<\u20093\u00a0cm). The primary treatment option for CNFs\u00a0is\u00a0surgical\u00a0removal, however they are prone to recurrence and surgical treatment is impossible in patients with severe tumor burden. CNFs are composed of neoplastic Schwann cells, mast cells, and fibroblasts (Fig.\u00a0 1 a, middle and lower panels). In addition, CNFs often include\u00a0a collagenous and myxoid extracellular matrix. CNFs and PNFs share nearly identical histology and require\u00a0clinical context\u00a0to accurately diagnosis [ 14 ]. In contrast, PNF growth is dysregulated, can develop anywhere in the body, and typically extends along peripheral nerves. Because of these features, PNFs can envelop organs and cause pain, disfigurement, and morbidity. For example, a PNF included in this study was removed due to its rapid growth in an axial location\u00a0(Fig.\u00a0 1 b). Importantly, CNF-associated malignancies are rare, whereas PNFs are able to dedifferentiate into aggressive sarcomas in 8\u201313% of patients [ 15 ]. Fig. 1 CNFs and PNFs are epigenetically distinct tumor types.  a  Clinical presentation of a CNF with H/E stain (20X/100X magnification shown); versus  b  PNF resected from deep shoulder location (T2-weighted MRI image; H/E 20X/100X shown).  c  Principal component analysis of RNAseq expression data comparing CNFs (purple) and PNFs (green) neurofibromas.  d  Copy number analysis of CNFs versus PNFs.  e  Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis of methylation probesets (i.e., beta-values) demonstrating unique CNF and PNF methylation profiles In order to confirm whether CNFs and PNFs are genomically and transcriptomically distinct lesions using advanced sequencing techniques, we compared publicly available RNA-seq data from an NF1 test cohort where cutaneous/non-plexiform neurofibromas were compared to PNFs [ 16 ]. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the RNA-seq data confirmed that histologically \u00a0\u00a0similar\u00a0cutaneous CNFs and PNFs cannot be discriminated based on global gene expression profiles, largely due to transcript heterogeneity (Fig.\u00a0 1 c). Prior expression profiling studies using cDNA microarrays did not identify distinct CNF and PNF transcriptome signatures at the macro-level, even though individual differences in key gene expression were identified [ 5 ]. We also evaluated whether genomic differences were present among our CNF and PNF cohorts and did not observe any large-scale differences in copy number variation (Fig.\u00a0 1 d). However, we note that there do appear to be focal copy number alterations identified in both CNF and PNF patient samples, consistent with observations from prior work (Fig.\u00a0 1 d, Supplemental Fig.\u00a07) [ 17 ]. These results verify that few distinctive genomic or transcriptome alterations exist outside of\u00a0putative\u00a0 NF1  deficiency (Fig.\u00a0 1 c, d). DNA methylation changes play key roles in development, disease and aging, with the added benefit of being a highly stable epigenetic mark that can be readily assayed, making this a clinically actionable and functional readout [ 18 \u2013 22 ]. We determined neurofibroma methylation profiles using the Infinium\u00a0MethylationEPIC\u00a0array in a discovery cohort of 61 CNF and PNF samples from a total of 39 patients (Additional file  6 : Table S1). The\u00a0MethylationEPIC\u00a0array is a targeted approach to interrogate approximately 850,000 methylation sites throughout the genome, including coding and regulatory space (e.g., FANTOM5 annotated enhancers) in addition to CpG islands, shores, and shelves. We applied a hierarchical generalized linear mixed effects model to identify differentially methylated loci between CNFs and PNFs, controlling for age and sex differences with a nested random effect to control for partially repeated measures. In total, we identified 31,201 significant differentially methylated probes (DMP;  q \u2009<\u20090.05). By examining differentially methylated loci with an absolute odds ratio greater than 4 and clustering using a semi-supervised hierarchical approach, we establish a distinct, base-pair resolution epigenetic signature for CNF and PNFs (Fig.\u00a0 1 e). This probe-based analysis confirms that individual CpG-based methylation events are highly consistent within CNF and PNF tumor types, yet between CNFs and PNFs there are clearly definable, distinct global methylation profiles with minimal overlap.\u00a0Comparison of beta-values within clustered methylation sites revealed striking differences across large portions of the genome suggesting that chromatin architecture is also distinct between tumor types. CNFs and PNFs\u00a0display distinctive 3D chromatin architecture Next, we sought to determine if nuclear organization and higher-ordered chromatin states differed between CNFs and PNFs. Chromosomal DNA is organized into A/B compartments that largely correspond to being either transcriptionally active DNA compartments (A compartment) or silenced DNA compartments (B compartment) [ 23 ]. As such, DNA compartmentalization is a critical determinant of gene expression leading to cell fate determination and coordinated tissue development [ 24 ,  25 ]. Typically, chromatin compartments are identified using\u00a0HiC\u00a0or other assays to directly measure long-range chromatin contacts [ 26 ]. However, it has been demonstrated that Infinium Human Methylation 450K or EPIC array can reconstruct higher-order chromatin structure similar to\u00a0HiC [ 27 ]. Thus, we inferred A/B group-level compartments in CNF and PNFs at 100\u00a0kb resolution.\u00a0We show that the 3D genomic organization between CNFs and PNFs is 80\u201385% concordant whereas 15\u201320% of the compartments are inverted or discordant between CNF and PNFs. This discordance of PNF and CNFs compartments is observed genome-wide (X chromosomes were not assessed) (Fig.\u00a0 2 a, b). These data provide additional support that CNFs and PNFs possess distinct epigenomes. Given that individual CpG methylation changes and associated effects are difficult to interpret in isolation unless they are placed in the context of neighboring CpG loci and summarized into region-level changes, we used the differentially methylated probes identified above to call 6,004 significantly differentially methylated regions (DMRs;  q \u2009<\u20090.05) using\u00a0DMRcate. Using an ad hoc threshold of two-fold changes, a total of 1655 differentially methylated regions were significantly different ( q \u2009<\u20090.05) between CNF and PNFs (Supplemental Fig. 6a). A focused evaluation of the top 250 DMRs in terms of fold-change (Supplemental Fig. 6b) revealed that 100 of these sites were found to occur in the genomic contexts of promoter and enhancer space, providing evidence that these DMRs may play a regulatory role in modulating gene expression (Fig.\u00a0 2 b). Notably, we observed that areas of promoter/enhancer overlap were evenly distributed in these top differentially methylated regions across all chromosomes except chromosome 17 which was disproportionately affected (Fig.\u00a0 2 c, d). Chromosome 17 contained 13 top DMRs, while other autosomal chromosomes contained on average, 3.95\u2009\u00b1\u20092.20 DMRs. Intriguingly, these DMRs spanned the entire length of Chromosome 17, including putative regulatory space of key genes such as  NF1 ,  TP53,  and  MAP2K3  (Fig.\u00a0 2 d). Taking into account all significant DMRs (q\u2009<\u20090.05), genomic context distributions revealed a broad distribution that extended beyond the promoter and enhancer space, including CpG islands, shores, and shelves (Fig.\u00a0 2 e), in line with the features targeted by the Illumina EPIC methylation arrays. Taken together, these results provide evidence that  NF1  deficiency in transcriptionally and genomically similar lesions possess distinct epigenomes as evidenced through genome-wide differences in higher-order chromatin structure and differentially methylated regions. These results link  NF1  deficiency with differential methylation events that likely alter signaling fates through epigenetic alterations in regulatory space and culminates in broad remodeling of chromatin architecture throughout the genome. Given the lack of transcriptional and genomic differences between CNF and PNFs, these data strongly suggest that epigenomic differences contribute to the morphological and pathological variation observed in NF1 patients.

CNF density is even noted to be discordant among monozygotic twins [ 28 ]. To determine whether CNF size correlates with site-specific methylation events, we collected CNFs in three size categories. Adjusting for age and sex differences, we determined significant associations ( q \u2009<\u20090.05) between CNF size in millimeters and probe-level methylation status. A total of 188 loci were found to be statistically significant.\u00a0Both positive and negative correlations were discovered among the 188 associated loci, with 34 achieving an effect size (>\u20094\u00a0mm) that reached statistical significance (Fig.\u00a0 3 ). Signaling pathway correlation of the 34 significant DMRs was not possible due to a lack of statistical confidence, however these results indicate that CNF size is significantly influenced by methylation of specific loci. Fig. 3 Differential methylation correlates with CNF tumor size. Graphical comparison of methylation levels (i.e., beta-values) versus CNF size (mm) at DMRs determined to be significantly correlated with measured size of CNF tumors Differentially methylated loci are enriched in inflammatory pain and RAS pathways To understand how the distinct methylation patterns may promote CNF and PNF development, we performed a gene ontology analysis to determine whether DMR patterns would predict signaling in critical pathways. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis is a high-level functional analysis of epigenomic data that allows for annotation of key cell signaling and biological processes. KEGG analysis of global DMR data identified several key cellular processes that differed significantly between tumor types as a result\u00a0of predicted gene expression impacts from methylation events. As expected, the RAS, MAPK, and PI3K\u2013AKT signaling pathways were associated with both CNF and PNF development; however, differential methylation was noted between the tumor types in genes affecting key cellular processes. Interestingly, CNFs and PNFs demonstrated differential regulation of inflammatory mediators of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, phospholipase D (PLD), cytoskeletal rearrangement, and oxytocin signaling (Fig.\u00a0 4 a). TRP channels, PLD, and oxytocin signaling have all been demonstrated to regulate inflammation and pain, which is a common feature of both PNFs and CNFs. Pain and inflammation are known to be dysregulated in Neurofibromatosis, however it is unclear how NF1 deficiency exacerbates these symptoms. To functionalize these results and validate a role for individual DNA methylation events in tumor-type associated inflammation and pain signaling, we examined significantly correlated DMRs associated with genes in the Inflammatory Mediator Regulation of TRP Channels KEGG pathway. Two highly significant DMRs\u00a0(DMR1  p \u2009=\u20092.72E-21; DMR2  p \u2009=\u20091.84E-08)\u00a0were discovered within the primary and alternative promotors and leading exons of the\u00a0 MAP2K3 \u00a0gene that encodes the MAP kinase\u00a0kinase, MKK3 (Fig.\u00a0 4 b). Across DMR1, PNFs displayed higher DNA methylation, while CNFs were more highly methylated in DMR2 (Fig.\u00a0 4 c). As MKK3 plays a role in pain signaling, inflammation and cancer [ 29 ,  30 ], we hypothesized that reciprocal methylation of DMR1 and DMR2 would instruct differential MKK3 protein expression leading to altered RAS signaling fates. Western blot of a representative subset of CNF and PNF tumors demonstrated that MKK3 protein expression was highly correlated to\u00a0 MAP2K3 \u00a0DMR methylation status (DMR1:MKK3  \u03c1 \u2009=\u2009\u2212\u00a00.85,  p \u2009=\u20090.00018) (Fig.\u00a0 4 d, e) despite expected intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity. This strong inverse correlation points to exquisite control of MKK3 protein expression through methylation events occurring at sites of alternative leading  MAP2K3  exons. Fig. 4 Functional annotation of significant DMRs reveals differential methylation at alternative  MAP2K3  exons leading to coordinated MKK3 expression.  a  KEGG pathway analysis of CNF and PNF methylation profiles confirms that multiple pathways are regulated epigenetically including growth factor, inflammatory, pain signaling and oxytocin pathways.  b ,  c  Differential methylation was observed in upstream regulatory sites in  MAP2K3  that control alternative leading exon expression.  d  Western blot analysis of MKK3 protein (actin loading control). Beta-values for tumor-type DMRs (DMR1/DMR2) shown below.  e  DMR1 beta-values correlate strongly with MKK3/Actin ratio expression values ( p \u2009<\u20090.01;\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u00a00.846) As p38 is the primary effector of MKK3 signaling in response to cellular stress and cytokine stimulation [ 31 ], as well as chromatin conformational changes such as those observed in Fig.\u00a0 2 , we hypothesized that DNA methylation also regulates p38 expression in CNFs and PNFs. Because methylation events can also impact protein kinase activation states [ 32 ], we also assessed whether\u00a0 MAP2K3 \u00a0methylation events affected downstream p38 protein expression and activation. We identified a significant DMR ( p \u2009=\u20091.66E\u221216) approximately 3.5\u00a0kb upstream of the\u00a0 MAPK14 \u00a0gene, which encodes the p38\u03b1 isoform. Although the DMR lies within the promotor region of  SLC26A8  gene, p38 protein levels were negatively correlated with methylation at this site (\u03c1\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u00a00.56,  p \u2009=\u20090.038) (Fig.\u00a0 5 a,b). Methylation was higher in the PNF group than the CNF group leading to variable but overall decreased p38 protein expression (T180/T182) in PNFs (Fig.\u00a0 5 a). More specifically, CNFs expressed both MKK3 (Fig.\u00a0 4 d) and p38 (Fig.\u00a0 5 a) more abundantly than PNFs, as well as phospho-p38 indicating consistent p38 activation (Fig.\u00a0 5 c). These results are consistent with canonical MKK3/P38 pathway activation. Whereas MKK3 maintains a high degree of specificity for p38, it is unclear whether p38 regulates ERK through direct crosstalk [ 33 ]. P38 activation was previously shown to inhibit RAS through a redundant negative feedback loop originating in downstream MAPK signaling [ 34 ]. It is currently unclear how NF1 deficiency affects negative feedback mechanisms downstream of RAS. We demonstrate that p38 activation was strongly correlated with\u00a0pERK\u00a0expression regardless of tumor type ( \u03c1 \u2009=\u20090.70,  p \u2009=\u20090.006) (Fig.\u00a0 5 d). These results point to discrete signaling differences between RAS/MEK/ERK and RAS/MKK3/ p38/ERK in the context of NF1 deficiency (Fig.\u00a0 5 c, d).

  "discussion": "Conclusion The epigenetic distinctions between CNFs and PNFs extend from the level of chromatin conformational change down to altered expression of proteins that regulate or modulate RAS signaling. These findings are intriguing given that the analyzed tumors arose in the context of\u00a0RAS deregulation as a result of\u00a0NF1 deficiency. Based on KEGG pathway analysis, it is likely that methylation events are involved in regulation of pain signaling down to the level of inflammatory mediator production. More work is needed in many aspects of neurofibroma epigenetics, including studies targeting p38 and its downstream effectors. As such, we present a new signaling paradigm where differential methylation between tumor types results in reinforcement of inflammatory signaling in CNFs, and classical RAS/MEK/ERK activation\u00a0towards growth\u00a0in PNFs.",
