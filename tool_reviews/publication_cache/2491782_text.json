  "abstract": "Linkage analysis of neurofibromatosis type I, using chromosome 17 DNA markers.  Kittur SD(1), Bagdon MM, Lubs ML, Phillips JA 3rd, Murray JC, Slaugenhaupt SA,  Chakravarti A, Adler WH.  Author information: (1)National Institute on Aging, Gerontology Research Center, Baltimore, MD  21224.  The gene for von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) has recently been  mapped to the pericentromeric region of human chromosome 17. To further localize  the NF1 gene, linkage analysis using chromosome 17 DNA markers was performed on  11 multigeneration families with 175 individuals, 57 of whom were affected. The  markers used were D17Z1 (p17H8), D17S58 (EW301), D17S54 (EW203), D17S57 (EW206),  D17S73 (EW207), CRI-L946, HOX-2, and growth hormone. Tight linkage was found  between NF1 and D17Z1, D17S58, and D17S57 with a recombination fraction of zero.  One recombinant was detected between NF1 and D17S73, showing linkage with a 10%  recombination fraction. No linkage was detected between NF1 and CRI-L946 or  between HOX-2 and growth hormone. Our data are consistent with the proposed gene  order pter D17S58-D17Z1-NF1-D17S57-D17S73 qter.  PMCID: PMC1715469 PMID: 2491782 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",
