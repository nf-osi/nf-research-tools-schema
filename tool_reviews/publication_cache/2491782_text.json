  "title": "Linkage analysis of neurofibromatosis type I, using chromosome 17 DNA markers.",
  "abstract": "The gene for von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) has recently been mapped to the pericentromeric region of human chromosome 17. To further localize the NF1 gene, linkage analysis using chromosome 17 DNA markers was performed on 11 multigeneration families with 175 individuals, 57 of whom were affected. The markers used were D17Z1 (p17H8), D17S58 (EW301), D17S54 (EW203), D17S57 (EW206), D17S73 (EW207), CRI-L946, HOX-2, and growth hormone. Tight linkage was found between NF1 and D17Z1, D17S58, and D17S57 with a recombination fraction of zero. One recombinant was detected between NF1 and D17S73, showing linkage with a 10% recombination fraction. No linkage was detected between NF1 and CRI-L946 or between HOX-2 and growth hormone. Our data are consistent with the proposed gene order pter D17S58-D17Z1-NF1-D17S57-D17S73 qter.",
