  "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a genetic condition marked by the development of multiple benign tumors in the nervous system. The most common tumors associated with NF2 are bilateral vestibular schwannoma, meningioma, and ependymoma. The clinical manifestations of NF2 depend on the site of involvement. Vestibular schwannoma can present with hearing loss, dizziness, and tinnitus, while spinal tumor leads to debilitating pain, muscle weakness, or paresthesias. Clinical diagnosis of NF2 is based on the Manchester criteria, which have been updated in the last decade. NF2 is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the NF2 gene on chromosome 22, leading the merlin protein to malfunction. Over half of NF2 patients have de novo mutations, and half of this group are mosaic. NF2 can be managed by surgery, stereotactic radiosurgery, monoclonal antibody bevacizumab, and close observation. However, the nature of multiple tumors and the necessity of multiple surgeries over the lifetime, inoperable tumors like meningiomatosis with infiltration of the sinus or in the area of the lower cranial nerves, the complications caused by the operation, the malignancies induced by radiotherapy, and inefficiency of cytotoxic chemotherapy due to the benign nature of NF-related tumors have led a march toward exploring targeted therapies. Recent advances in genetics and molecular biology have allowed identifying and targeting of underlying pathways in the pathogenesis of NF2. In this review, we explain the clinicopathological characteristics of NF2, its genetic and molecular background, and the current knowledge and challenges of implementing genetics to develop efficient therapies.",
