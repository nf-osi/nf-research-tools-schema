  "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a genetic syndrome characterized by a wide variety of tumor and non-tumor manifestations. Bone-related issues, such as scoliosis, tibial dysplasia, and low bone mineral density, are a significant source of morbidity for this population with limited treatment options. Some of the challenges to developing such treatments include the lack of consensus regarding the optimal methods to assess bone health in neurofibromatosis type 1 and limited data regarding the natural history of these manifestations. In this review, the Functional Committee of the Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis International Collaboration: (1) presents the available techniques for measuring overall bone health and metabolism in persons with neurofibromatosis type 1, (2) reviews data for use of each of these measures in the neurofibromatosis type 1 population, and (3) describes the strengths and limitations for each method as they might be used in clinical trials targeting neurofibromatosis type 1 bone manifestations. The Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis International Collaboration supports the development of a prospective, longitudinal natural history study focusing on the bone-related manifestations and relevant biomarkers of neurofibromatosis type 1. In addition, we suggest that the neurofibromatosis type 1 research community consider adding the less burdensome measurements of bone health as exploratory endpoints in ongoing or planned clinical trials for other neurofibromatosis type 1 manifestations to expand knowledge in the field.",
