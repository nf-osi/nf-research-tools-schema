  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether [F]fluorothymidine (FLT) and/or [F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) can differentiate growth in neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) related vestibular schwannomas (VS) and to evaluate the importance of PET scanner spatial resolution on measured tumor uptake. METHODS: Six NF2 patients with 11 VS (4 rapidly growing, 7 indolent), were scanned with FLT and FDG using a high-resolution research tomograph (HRRT, Siemens) and a Siemens Biograph TrueV PET-CT, with and without resolution modeling image reconstruction. Mean, maximum, and peak standardised uptake values (SUV) for each tumor were derived and the intertumor correlation between FDG and FLT uptake was compared. The ability of FDG and FLT SUV values to discriminate between rapidly growing and slow growing (indolent) tumors was assessed using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: Tumor uptake was seen with both tracers, using both scanners, with and without resolution modeling. FDG and FLT uptake was correlated (R\u200a=\u200a0.67-0.86, p\u200a<\u200a0.01) and rapidly growing tumors displayed significantly higher uptake (SUVmean and SUVpeak) of both tracers (p\u200a<\u200a0.05, one tailed t test). All of the PET analyses performed demonstrated better discriminatory power (AUCROC range\u200a=\u200a0.71-0.86) than tumor size alone (AUCROC\u200a=\u200a0.61). The use of standard resolution scanner with standard reconstruction did not result in a notable deterioration of discrimination accuracy. CONCLUSION: NF2 related VS demonstrate uptake of both FLT and FDG, which is significantly increased in rapidly growing tumors. A short static FDG PET scan with standard clinical resolution and reconstruction can provide relevant information on tumor growth to aid clinical decision making.",

  "methods": "Methods: Six NF2 patients with 11 VS (4 rapidly growing, 7 indolent), were scanned with FLT and FDG using a high-resolution research tomograph (HRRT, Siemens) and a Siemens Biograph TrueV PET-CT, with and without resolution modeling image reconstruction. Mean, maximum, and peak standardised uptake values (SUV) for each tumor were derived and the intertumor correlation between FDG and FLT uptake was compared. The ability of FDG and FLT SUV values to discriminate between rapidly growing and slow growing (indolent) tumors was assessed using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. METHODS Patients Patients were recruited via the nationally commissioned, specialized NF2 multidisciplinary team meeting in Manchester, UK. Adult patients (aged between 18 and 70 yr of age) with a confirmed diagnosis of NF2 and at least one vestibular schwannoma (VS) were recruited. Exclusion criteria included: female patients pregnant or intending to become pregnant; patients who had undergone previous radiotherapy or antiangiogenic treatment; and patients with contra-indications to MRI. All patients gave informed written consent. The study was approved by an independent research ethics committee (REC 13/NW/0260) and by the United Kingdom Administration of Radioactive Substances Advisory Committee (ARSAC RPC 595/3586/30119). All patients had undergone previous routine clinical assessment including MRI at 6 to 12 month intervals and the median length of follow-up across all patients was 1.52 years (range\u200a=\u200a0.60\u20137.30 yr). The study MRI scan was reviewed in addition to the results of previous clinical MR imaging by the multidisciplinary team and tumors were classified as either rapidly growing or indolent. This classification reflected clinical decision making in these patients with tumors being classified as indolent undergoing further radiological surveillance and rapidly growing tumors being considered for either surgical resection or treatment with the antiangiogenic agent bevacuzimab (Avastin). To confirm the differential growth pattern across these two cohorts, volumetric measurements of tumor size were made for the preceding clinical scan, the study MR scan, and a follow-up scan 1 year later (see Table  1 ). Volumetric measurements were made on T 1 -weighted (T1W) postcontrast imaging using the semiautomatic segmentation tool within the Brainlab iPlan software (Brainlab AG Germany) and the results of segmentation were reviewed and, where necessary, edited by an experienced neuroradiologist (I.D.).

PET Data Acquisition Patients were scanned using FDG and FLT on two separate occasions, less than a week apart. For both tracers 200 MBq was the target injected activity. Patients were scanned using both a conventional PET-CT scanner, the Truepoint TrueV Biograph PET-CT scanner (Siemens), with a spatial resolution of approximately 4.5\u200amm full width at half maximum ( 30 ); and with a brain dedicated scanner the (HRRT, Siemens) with spatial resolution of approximately 2.5\u200amm full width at half maximum ( 29 ). For each radiotracer, the scan sequence followed a 60-gap-30-gap-30 minute structure with alternated order of scanners, i.e., three scans for each radiotracer injection alternating between the PET-CT and the HRRT (with sequence shown in supplementary Figure 1C). Patients were placed on one of the two scanners (with the initial scanner altering between patients), injected with the radiotracer, and data acquired for 60 minutes (scan 1). Following a short break of between 10 and 20 minutes, patients were placed on the other scanner, with data acquired for 30 minutes (scan 2). Finally, following a second short break the patient was placed on the original scanner with data acquired for a further 30 minutes (scan 3). This scan sequence was devised to allow assessment of tracer uptake during scan 2 at approximately 75 minutes postinjection on both scanners, either from direct measurement or from linear interpolation of data from scans 1 and 3 (radioactivity concentrations on the VS followed an approximately linear relationship during this period for both tracers). For attenuation correction, a 6-minute transmission scan was acquired when using the HRRT (preinjection for scan 1 and postemission acquisition for scans 2 and 3) and a pre-emission CT scan when using the TrueV PET/CT scanner. Image Reconstruction Data from both scanners were reconstructed using implementations of three-dimensional iterative Ordinary Poisson Ordered Subset Expectation Maximisation ( 31 ) without (No-RM) and with resolution modeling (RM), reconstructing the data during the last 30 minutes of scan 1 and the data for scans 2 and 3, each into three 10 minute frames. For the TrueV scanner, the Siemens offline reconstruction package \u201c e7_tools\u201d  was used with an image zoom of two resulting in images with a voxel size of 1.33\u200amm\u200a\u00d7\u200a1.33\u200amm\u200a\u00d7\u200a2.03\u200amm and an image grid dimension of 256\u200a\u00d7\u200a256\u200a\u00d7\u200a107 voxels. HRRT data was reconstructed using HRRT user community software generating images consisting of 256\u200a\u00d7\u200a256\u200a\u00d7\u200a207 voxels each of size 1.22\u200amm\u200a\u00d7\u200a1.22\u200amm\u200a\u00d7\u200a1.22\u200amm. In both cases, 10 and 12 iterations for No-RM and for RM respectively were conducted using 16 subsets for HRRT and 21 for the TrueV. RM reconstruction is referred to as HD for the TrueV PET ( 32 ) while for the HRRT user community software was used ( 33 ). The iterations and subsets selected reflect our standard image reconstruction protocols. Postreconstruction smoothing using Gaussian filters, which can be used to reduce image noise, was not performed since it could worsen image resolution, which was considered to be critical for this clinical application. Reconstructions for both scanners were performed with full corrections including scatter and attenuation. In the case of HRRT, attenuation correction was calculated from a reconstructed and segmented \u03bc-map image using the total variation TXTV method ( 34 ). To minimize the effects of patient motion particularly the deterioration of image resolution, image-based motion correction using frame-by-frame realignment for each 10 minute frame was used for both scanners ( 35 ). Delineation of Tumor VOI for PET Quantification Tumor volumes of interest (VOI) for PET analysis were manually drawn on contrast enhanced T1W MR images (voxel size 0.9\u200amm\u200a\u00d7\u200a0.9\u200amm\u200a\u00d7\u200a0.8\u200amm), acquired as part of the study MRI. Regions were drawn to the edge of the enhancing tumor (care was taken when delineating the tumor to avoid partial volume effects from nearby structures or surrounding CSF) and subsequently were modestly eroded using a single iteration and a 3\u200a\u00d7\u200a3\u200a\u00d7\u200a1 erosion kernel. All manual outlining was done using Analyze version 11 and was performed under the supervision of AJ and ID, consultant neuroradiologists with over 40 years of combined experience. The study MRI was acquired on the same day as one of the PET scans for all the patients and therefore within 1 week of both PET scans. Using SPM 8 ( http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm ), contrast enhanced T1W MRIs were coregistered to the 30\u200aminutes motion corrected PET images from each of the three scans, and the manually drawn VOIs were re-sliced to PET space using the rigid body transformations calculated from this coregistration and nearest-neighbor interpolation. PET quantification was performed using the standardized uptake value (SUV), whereby the radiotracer concentration at 75 minutes posttracer injection within each voxel was normalized by the injected radioactivity dose and patient weight ( 36 ). The tumor VOIs were then applied to the PET data to calculate SUV mean  (reflecting the overall regional tracer distribution), SUV max  (max value of the tracer distribution), and SUV peak  within each tumor. The latter is considered to be less sensitive to the VOI boundary and the uptake distribution ( 37 ). Statistical Analysis SPSS version 23 was used for all statistical analyses. The normality and homogeneity of variance for derived values was assessed using the Shapiro\u2013Wilk and Levene test respectively. Intergroup differences in growth rate, SUV mean , SUV max , and SUV peak  between indolent and growing tumors were compared using a Student's  t  test. Linear regression analysis was undertaken to assess intertumor relationship between standardized uptake values for both FDG and FLT using each scanner with and without RM. Finally, the ability of each tracer to classify VS as rapidly growing was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve for each SUV parameter, using the multidisciplinary defined growth classification as the truth.",

  "results": "RESULTS Patient Demographics Six patients with NF2 participated in this study, three males and three females with an age range of 21 to 59 years. Five patients had bilateral VS with the remaining patient having undergone previous surgical removal of a left-sided VS. Six tumors were intracanalicular at the time of the PET study and among the 11 VS, 4 were classified as rapidly growing while the rest were indolent (see Table  1 ). Confirmatory measurements of tumor volume change between the preceding clinical MRI and the study MRI demonstrated that compared with the indolent tumor group rapidly growing tumors displayed a higher annual adjusted growth rate (0.00 versus 0.49\u200acm 3 /yr,  p \u200a=\u200a0.01, two-tailed  t  test). Patient demographics, tumor growth pattern, and the clinical outcome for each VS at 1-year follow-up are shown in Table  1 . Mean injected tracer activities were 203\u200a\u00b1\u200a2 MBq (range 202\u2013210) of FLT and 206\u200a\u00b1\u200a4 MBq (range 201\u2013211) of FDG. Visual Inspection of Uptake Uptake of both FDG and FLT was seen in all tumors, using both scanners with and without RM. SUV mean, maximum, and peak of both tracers at approximately 75 to 105 minutes after injection are shown for the TrueV scanner in supplementary Tables 1C and 2C; and for the HRRT scanner in supplementary Tables 3C and 4C. Figure  1  shows axial coregistered T 1 -weighted contrast enhanced MRI, FDG PET, and FLT PET image sections for two patients (A and D) with bilateral tumors. All of the PET images shown were acquired using the TrueV scanner and show decay corrected SUV (g/ml) at approximately 75 to 105 minutes postinjection with the FDG images windowed to saturate the high brain uptake. Patient A (top row) had bilateral rapidly growing tumors, with the right smaller VS scheduled for surgical removal at the time of the PET scans. High uptake of both tracers is observed in the larger left-sided VS, with a small area of focal FDG uptake within the right-sided tumor. Patient D (bottom row) also had bilateral VS, with the right-sided tumor classified as rapidly growing and the left-sided tumor classified as slow growing (indolent). For both tracers clear uptake is observed for the right-sided rapidly growing tumor while little uptake is observed for the left-sided tumor. FIG. 1 MRI and FDG/FLT PET images. From left to right: coregistered axial contrast enhanced MRI slices through cerebellopontine angle; axial PET FDG images taken at 30 minutes using TrueV PET-CT scanner without RM; axial PET FLT images taken at 30 minutes using TrueV PET-CT scanner without RM. Top row\u201433-year-old female (patient A) with bilateral growing VS. High uptake of both FDG and FLT is observed in the larger left-sided VS, with a small area of focal FDG uptake within the right-sided tumor. Bottom row\u201421-year-old female (patient D) with right-sided growing VS and left-sided slow growing (indolent) tumor. The right lesion shows uptake of both FLT and FDG while the left lesion showed minimal uptake of either tracer. All PET images show the summed activity at approximately 75 to 105 minutes postinjection. Group Comparison Intergroup differences in tumor SUV mean , SUV max , and SUV peak  between rapidly growing and indolent tumors for both FDG and FLT are shown in Table  2 . The group comparison between FDG and FLT for both scanners using RM is presented in Figure  2 . Rapidly growing tumors displayed significantly higher FDG SUV mean  and SUV peak  compared with indolent tumors using both scanners, with and without RM ( p \u200a<\u200a0.05, one-tailed  t  test). With the exception of values derived using the HRRT scanner without RM, the FDG SUV max  values were also significantly higher in the rapidly growing tumor group ( p \u200a<\u200a0.05).

While use of the TrueV scanner without RM did not demonstrate a significant difference in FLT uptake between rapidly growing and indolent tumors ( p \u200a>\u200a0.05), use of the TrueV with RM did demonstrate significantly higher FLT SUV mean  values in the rapidly growing tumors ( p \u200a<\u200a0.05, one-tailed  t  test). Similarly, use of the HRRT scanner with and without RM also demonstrated significantly higher SUV mean  and SUV peak  values compared with indolent tumors ( p \u200a<\u200a0.05, one-tailed  t  test). Scatter Plots Scatter plots of SUV for FDG against FLT for the TrueV and HRRT scanners are shown in Figure  3 . Each point of the graph represents one of the VS with data shown for the SUV mean  with and without RM (rows). Lines of best fit for linear relationships are shown, together with the fit equation and R-squared values. VS classified as rapidly growing are plotted as a solid circle, while indolent tumors are plotted as a square. FIG. 3 Intertumor scatterplot comparison of FDG versus FLT uptake. Scatter plots of the mean tumor SUV values of FDG against FLT for both the TrueV (left column) and HRRT scanner (right column) without RM and with RM. For each graph, a line of best fit for proportionality is shown, along with the equation and R 2  values. Lesions classified as rapid growing (growing) are shown as solid circles, whereas slow growing/indolent lesions are shown as an open square. Visual inspection of the scatter plots in Figure  3  suggests that FDG and FLT are related to each other in a proportional manner with the use of the higher resolution HRRT scanner and/or RM improving the correlation between FDG and FLT SUV mean  values (TrueV: adjusted R 2  value of 0.67 vs 0.73 with RM, HRRT: adjusted R 2  value of 0.85 vs 0.86 with RM). Similar plots for both SUV max  and SUV peak  without and with RM can be found in supplementary Figures 1C and 2C, for the TrueV and HRRT scanner respectively. In supplementary Figure 4C, scatter plots of the SUV mean  for FDG and FLT versus tumor volume for the TrueV scanner without RM are shown. A weak positive correlation between SUV mean  and tumor volume is observed with adjusted R 2  values of 0.18 ( p \u200a=\u200a0.11) and 0.08 ( p \u200a=\u200a0.17) for FDG and FLT respectively. Area Under the Curve of the Receiver Operator Characteristic Curve AUC of the ROC curves for SUV mean, maximum, and peak, for both tracers, and for both scanners are shown in Table  3 . Values ranged from 0.714 to 0.857 with SUV mean  and from 0.786 to 0.821 with SUV peak , suggesting a good ability of FDG and FLT SUV values to discriminate indolent from rapidly growing tumors. Use of RM for both scanners generally increased the AUC values. Overall, FDG displayed higher AUC values than FLT (0.750\u20130.893 vs 0.643\u20130.857) with the exception of SUV mean  when using the HRRT scanner with RM, where FLT displayed greater discriminatory power (AUC 0.857 vs 0.821). Both FDG and FLT outperformed tumor volume in discriminating between rapidly growing and indolent tumors with AUC ROC  value of 0.601.

  "discussion": "CONCLUSIONS Data from 6 NF2 patients, with a total of 11 VS, indicate that for both FLT and FDG an uptake signal above background can be detected and that this uptake shows promise in providing additional and complementary information to serial MRI measurements for the classification of VS which are rapidly growing. Further studies should be undertaken to assess FLT and FDG PET as predictors of tumor growth, and as a clinical imaging tool for early identification of tumors requiring consideration of early treatment.",
