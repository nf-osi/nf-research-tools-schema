  "methods": "2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Reagents Reduced growth factor reconstituted basement membrane (rBM; Cultrex TM ) and Collagen I (high concentration; rat tail) were purchased from Bio-Techne (Minneapolis, MN, USA) and Corning (Corning, NY, USA), respectively. Phenol red-free Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) and MycoZap TM  Plus-CL were purchased from Lonza (Basel, Switzerland). Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was sourced from Cytiva (Marlborough, MA, USA). L-glutamine, MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diplenyltetrazolium bromide) substrates, and all other chemicals, unless otherwise stated, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). CellTracker TM  Orange, CellTrace TM  Far red, Hoechst33342, LookOut RT-PCR kits for mycoplasma detection, and Thermo Scientific Three-Step Stain (methylene blue and eosin) were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). A 24-well cell culture insert (CellQART) was purchased from Sterlitech (Auburn, WA, USA). Human Inflammation Arrays were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA). 2.2. Cells and Cell Maintenance The following immortalized human plexiform neurofibroma cell lines (hereafter called pNF1 cells) described in [ 36 ] were used: ipNF95.11b C, ipNF95.11b C-RFP, and ipNF 05.5. ipNF95.11b C gifted from Dr. Margaret Wallace (University of Florida, USA) was lentivirally transduced with red fluorescent protein (RFP) by Dr. Raymond R Mattingly\u2019s group [ 36 ], and ipNF95.11b C and ipNF05.5 were purchased from ATCC. Primary fibroblasts (hereafter called fibroblasts) from pNF1 patients were purchased from Dr. Margaret Wallace, University of Florida (USA). All cells were maintained as monolayers at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO 2  in growth media (DMEM/high glucose + 10% FBS). Cells were routinely checked to ensure that they were free of mycoplasma contamination. 2.3. Three-Dimensional (3D) Culture We used a 3D rBM overlay model according to previous publications for live-cell imaging by confocal microscopy [ 36 , 37 ]. Briefly, in 3D monocultures of pNF1 cells (8 \u00d7 10 3  cells) or fibroblasts (2 \u00d7 10 3  cells), cells were seeded on rBM, Cultrex TM : collagen I mixture, on glass-bottomed culture dishes (14 mm in diameter), overlaid with DMEM with 2% FBS in 2% rBM, and grown for 6 days, as illustrated in  Figure 1 . In 3D pNF1 cell: fibroblast cocultures, fibroblasts were plated first on rBM and allowed to attach before adding tumor cells. Then, pNF1 cells were placed on top of fibroblasts, followed by 2% rBM in DMEM. A seeding ratio of 4 pNF1 cells to 1 fibroblast was used for 3D cocultures. pNF1 cells were transduced with RFP or were labeled with CellTracker TM  orange, and fibroblasts were labeled with CellTrace TM  Far Red prior to seeding to distinguish each cell type in 3D cocultures. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst33342. Cell culture media were replaced with fresh 2% overlay every 4 days. 2.4. Image Acquisition for Quantitative Analysis in 3D Optical sections of 9 or 16 contiguous fields, unless otherwise indicated, through the entire depth of the 3D structures were acquired using Zeiss LSM 780 (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Jena, Germany) or Stellaris 5 (Leica Microsystems, Deerfield, IL, USA) confocal microscopes. Images were reconstructed in 3D using Volocity software 7.0.0 (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The number of total cells was quantified using Volocity. X (green), y (red), and z (blue) arrows in the bottom left of each image indicate the orientation of 3D images. Representative images of 3D reconstructions in each figure are shown in different angles to visualize the results more clearly. DIC images were taken using a Nikon Eclipse Ti-S microscope (Tokyo, Japan). 2.5. Fibroblast-Conditioned Media (CM) Fibroblasts (1 \u00d7 10 6  cells in a 60 mm dish) in fresh DMEM, i.e., DMEM not exposed to cells, in 2% rBM were added on top of 100% rBM and maintained for 6 days. Media were collected and centrifuged at 1800 \u00d7  g  to remove debris and floating cells, and supernatants were aliquoted to avoid damage from multiple freeze\u2013thaw cycles. The resulting CM from fibroblasts (Fib-CM) or the cell-free condition (control media; CtrlM) was stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until use. For the 3D imaging experiments, pNF1 cells (8 \u00d7 10 3  cells) were then seeded on 100% rBM, overlaid with 2% rBM, and grown in the presence of either CtrlM or Fib-CM mixed at a ratio of 1:1 with fresh DMEM; media were replaced every other day. 2.6. sEV Depletion from Fib-CM Depletion of sEVs from Fib-CM was performed, as previously described [ 39 ]. Briefly, media from 6-day monocultures of fibroblasts (1 \u00d7 10 6  cells in a 60 mm dish) in fresh DMEM were collected and centrifuged at 3000 \u00d7  g  to remove debris and floating cells, followed by 0.22 \u00b5m filtration. The Fib-CM was ultracentrifuged at 100,000 \u00d7  g  for 2 h. The supernatant was used as sEV-depleted Fib-CM. sEV depletion was determined by version 3.3 Dev Build 3.3.104 Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis software (Malvern Panalytical Ltd., Malvern, UK) installed in NanoSight NS300 (Malvern Panalytical Ltd., Malvern, UK). 2.7. In Vitro 3D Invasion Assay We performed 3D invasion assays as previously described [ 38 ]. Briefly, pNF1 cells (3 \u00d7 10 3  cells) were seeded on top of 8 \u03bcm cell culture filter inserts coated with 50 \u03bcL of 5 mg/mL rBM. The cells were allowed to form tumor spheroids for 4 days, which were then incubated for a further 24 h with either control media (CtrlM) or Fib-CM in the lower compartment. Cells on the bottom of the inserts, i.e., invaded cells, were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and stained with Thermo Scientific Three-Step Stain (methylene blue and eosin). After the stained filters were mounted on slides, invaded cells were visualized using a Nikon Eclipse Ti-S microscope (Tokyo, Japan) and quantified using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). Images of seven random fields per insert were acquired, and three independent experiments were carried out. 2.8. 3D MTT Assay A 3D MTT assay was used as an indicator of cell growth and viability, performed as previously described [ 36 ]. On day 0, 1.2 \u00d7 10 4  pNF1 cells (ipNF95.11b C) were plated in 150 \u03bcL media on 100% rBM with a 2% rBM overlay (DMEM, 10% FBS) per well in triplicate or quadruplicate. Empty cells along the perimeter of the plates were filled with PBS to minimize media evaporation. Twenty-four hours after plating cells, the medium was replaced with 150 \u03bcL DMEM (5% FBS). On day 5, 20 \u03bcL of 5 mg/mL MTT solution was added to each well, and cells were incubated for 4 h until a purple-colored formazan product was formed. After incubation, the wells were carefully aspirated. The formazan product was incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C in a 10% SDS in 0.01% HCl solution to solubilize the formazan and the rBM. The optical density (OD) was measured at a wavelength of 570 nm with the background absorbance read at 690 nm by an ELISA plate reader (SpectraMax Plus 384 microplate reader; Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). 2.9. Cytokine Inflammation Array CM was obtained from 3D monocultures of pNF1 cells (ipNF95.11b C) and fibroblasts and cocultures of pNF1 cells and fibroblasts for analysis. Experiments were performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommended protocols. Arbitrary values of the dot intensity representing detected cytokines were quantified by densitometry and normalized to positive controls on the same membrane using ImageJ software (v1.51w) (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). 2.10. Statistical Analysis Data are presented in box-and-whisker plots or bar graphs as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation. In box-and-whisker plots, boxes represent interquartile ranges and whiskers the minimum and maximum values. The significance of differences was evaluated either by one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc test to correct for multiple comparisons, or by Student\u2019s  t -test for two groups using GraphPad Prism version 8.0.1 for Windows, GraphPad Software (Boston, MA, USA). For all studies,  p  \u2264 0.05 was considered statistically significant. 2.11. Patents The present study is associated with the U.S. Patent US10227556B2.",
