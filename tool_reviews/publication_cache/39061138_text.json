  "methods": "2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Reagents Reduced growth factor reconstituted basement membrane (rBM; Cultrex TM ) and Collagen I (high concentration; rat tail) were purchased from Bio-Techne (Minneapolis, MN, USA) and Corning (Corning, NY, USA), respectively. Phenol red-free Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) and MycoZap TM  Plus-CL were purchased from Lonza (Basel, Switzerland). Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was sourced from Cytiva (Marlborough, MA, USA). L-glutamine, MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diplenyltetrazolium bromide) substrates, and all other chemicals, unless otherwise stated, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). CellTracker TM  Orange, CellTrace TM  Far red, Hoechst33342, LookOut RT-PCR kits for mycoplasma detection, and Thermo Scientific Three-Step Stain (methylene blue and eosin) were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). A 24-well cell culture insert (CellQART) was purchased from Sterlitech (Auburn, WA, USA). Human Inflammation Arrays were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA). 2.2. Cells and Cell Maintenance The following immortalized human plexiform neurofibroma cell lines (hereafter called pNF1 cells) described in [ 36 ] were used: ipNF95.11b C, ipNF95.11b C-RFP, and ipNF 05.5. ipNF95.11b C gifted from Dr. Margaret Wallace (University of Florida, USA) was lentivirally transduced with red fluorescent protein (RFP) by Dr. Raymond R Mattingly\u2019s group [ 36 ], and ipNF95.11b C and ipNF05.5 were purchased from ATCC. Primary fibroblasts (hereafter called fibroblasts) from pNF1 patients were purchased from Dr. Margaret Wallace, University of Florida (USA). All cells were maintained as monolayers at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO 2  in growth media (DMEM/high glucose + 10% FBS). Cells were routinely checked to ensure that they were free of mycoplasma contamination. 2.3. Three-Dimensional (3D) Culture We used a 3D rBM overlay model according to previous publications for live-cell imaging by confocal microscopy [ 36 , 37 ]. Briefly, in 3D monocultures of pNF1 cells (8 \u00d7 10 3  cells) or fibroblasts (2 \u00d7 10 3  cells), cells were seeded on rBM, Cultrex TM : collagen I mixture, on glass-bottomed culture dishes (14 mm in diameter), overlaid with DMEM with 2% FBS in 2% rBM, and grown for 6 days, as illustrated in  Figure 1 . In 3D pNF1 cell: fibroblast cocultures, fibroblasts were plated first on rBM and allowed to attach before adding tumor cells. Then, pNF1 cells were placed on top of fibroblasts, followed by 2% rBM in DMEM. A seeding ratio of 4 pNF1 cells to 1 fibroblast was used for 3D cocultures. pNF1 cells were transduced with RFP or were labeled with CellTracker TM  orange, and fibroblasts were labeled with CellTrace TM  Far Red prior to seeding to distinguish each cell type in 3D cocultures. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst33342. Cell culture media were replaced with fresh 2% overlay every 4 days. 2.4. Image Acquisition for Quantitative Analysis in 3D Optical sections of 9 or 16 contiguous fields, unless otherwise indicated, through the entire depth of the 3D structures were acquired using Zeiss LSM 780 (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Jena, Germany) or Stellaris 5 (Leica Microsystems, Deerfield, IL, USA) confocal microscopes. Images were reconstructed in 3D using Volocity software 7.0.0 (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The number of total cells was quantified using Volocity. X (green), y (red), and z (blue) arrows in the bottom left of each image indicate the orientation of 3D images. Representative images of 3D reconstructions in each figure are shown in different angles to visualize the results more clearly. DIC images were taken using a Nikon Eclipse Ti-S microscope (Tokyo, Japan). 2.5. Fibroblast-Conditioned Media (CM) Fibroblasts (1 \u00d7 10 6  cells in a 60 mm dish) in fresh DMEM, i.e., DMEM not exposed to cells, in 2% rBM were added on top of 100% rBM and maintained for 6 days. Media were collected and centrifuged at 1800 \u00d7  g  to remove debris and floating cells, and supernatants were aliquoted to avoid damage from multiple freeze\u2013thaw cycles. The resulting CM from fibroblasts (Fib-CM) or the cell-free condition (control media; CtrlM) was stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until use. For the 3D imaging experiments, pNF1 cells (8 \u00d7 10 3  cells) were then seeded on 100% rBM, overlaid with 2% rBM, and grown in the presence of either CtrlM or Fib-CM mixed at a ratio of 1:1 with fresh DMEM; media were replaced every other day. 2.6. sEV Depletion from Fib-CM Depletion of sEVs from Fib-CM was performed, as previously described [ 39 ]. Briefly, media from 6-day monocultures of fibroblasts (1 \u00d7 10 6  cells in a 60 mm dish) in fresh DMEM were collected and centrifuged at 3000 \u00d7  g  to remove debris and floating cells, followed by 0.22 \u00b5m filtration. The Fib-CM was ultracentrifuged at 100,000 \u00d7  g  for 2 h. The supernatant was used as sEV-depleted Fib-CM. sEV depletion was determined by version 3.3 Dev Build 3.3.104 Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis software (Malvern Panalytical Ltd., Malvern, UK) installed in NanoSight NS300 (Malvern Panalytical Ltd., Malvern, UK). 2.7. In Vitro 3D Invasion Assay We performed 3D invasion assays as previously described [ 38 ]. Briefly, pNF1 cells (3 \u00d7 10 3  cells) were seeded on top of 8 \u03bcm cell culture filter inserts coated with 50 \u03bcL of 5 mg/mL rBM. The cells were allowed to form tumor spheroids for 4 days, which were then incubated for a further 24 h with either control media (CtrlM) or Fib-CM in the lower compartment. Cells on the bottom of the inserts, i.e., invaded cells, were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and stained with Thermo Scientific Three-Step Stain (methylene blue and eosin). After the stained filters were mounted on slides, invaded cells were visualized using a Nikon Eclipse Ti-S microscope (Tokyo, Japan) and quantified using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). Images of seven random fields per insert were acquired, and three independent experiments were carried out. 2.8. 3D MTT Assay A 3D MTT assay was used as an indicator of cell growth and viability, performed as previously described [ 36 ]. On day 0, 1.2 \u00d7 10 4  pNF1 cells (ipNF95.11b C) were plated in 150 \u03bcL media on 100% rBM with a 2% rBM overlay (DMEM, 10% FBS) per well in triplicate or quadruplicate. Empty cells along the perimeter of the plates were filled with PBS to minimize media evaporation. Twenty-four hours after plating cells, the medium was replaced with 150 \u03bcL DMEM (5% FBS). On day 5, 20 \u03bcL of 5 mg/mL MTT solution was added to each well, and cells were incubated for 4 h until a purple-colored formazan product was formed. After incubation, the wells were carefully aspirated. The formazan product was incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C in a 10% SDS in 0.01% HCl solution to solubilize the formazan and the rBM. The optical density (OD) was measured at a wavelength of 570 nm with the background absorbance read at 690 nm by an ELISA plate reader (SpectraMax Plus 384 microplate reader; Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). 2.9. Cytokine Inflammation Array CM was obtained from 3D monocultures of pNF1 cells (ipNF95.11b C) and fibroblasts and cocultures of pNF1 cells and fibroblasts for analysis. Experiments were performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommended protocols. Arbitrary values of the dot intensity representing detected cytokines were quantified by densitometry and normalized to positive controls on the same membrane using ImageJ software (v1.51w) (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). 2.10. Statistical Analysis Data are presented in box-and-whisker plots or bar graphs as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation. In box-and-whisker plots, boxes represent interquartile ranges and whiskers the minimum and maximum values. The significance of differences was evaluated either by one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc test to correct for multiple comparisons, or by Student\u2019s  t -test for two groups using GraphPad Prism version 8.0.1 for Windows, GraphPad Software (Boston, MA, USA). For all studies,  p  \u2264 0.05 was considered statistically significant. 2.11. Patents The present study is associated with the U.S. Patent US10227556B2.",

  "introduction": "1. Introduction Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal-dominant genetic disorder caused by loss of expression of the neurofibromin ( Nf1  gene product) tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 17 and subsequent dysregulation of RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in Schwann cells (SCs) [ 1 , 2 ]. A clinical hallmark of NF1 is the development of a benign tumor on the dermis called a neurofibroma [ 1 , 2 ]. Plexiform neurofibromas often occur early in life in about half of the children with NF1 [ 3 ]. Plexiform neurofibroma with neurofibromatosis type 1 (hereafter called pNF1) can cause major morbidity including disfigurement and motor dysfunction due to its compression of nerves and organs as a result of its locally invasive nature and exceptional capacity for growth [ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ]. pNF1 in patients has about 10\u201315% potential to develop into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), which metastasize and frequently result in a fatal outcome [ 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 ]. The prognosis for MPNST patients is poor, with a 5-year overall survival (OS) rate of 15\u201366% [ 9 , 10 ]. Currently, the primary treatment for pNF1s is surgical removal; however, surgery can have severe consequences, such as quadriparesis. Also, there is a high rate of tumor recurrence because complete removal is often difficult due to the proximity of pNF1 to vital body structures and its high degree of infiltration [ 11 , 12 , 13 ]. Only one drug, selumetinib, has been approved by the US FDA (New Drug Application: 213756 in April 2020) [ 14 , 15 ] for the treatment of pediatric patients in which pNF1 cannot be removed by surgery [ 16 ]. pNF1 patients have a partial response to selumetinib, with treatment provoking a tumor volume shrinkage of ~20% in 70% of pNF1 patients [ 16 ]. Neurofibromas are complex tumors that are composed of SC-derived tumor cells ( Nf1 \u2212/\u2212 ) and the tumor microenvironment (TME), which include cellular components (e.g., fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and inflammatory cells) [ 17 ]. The cellular microenvironment is implicated in the development of neurofibromas through a paracrine loop between the tumor cells and the cellular microenvironment [ 17 , 18 , 19 ]. However, the contribution of the cellular microenvironment to the subsequent growth and invasiveness of existing pNF1 tumors remains unknown. Fibroblasts, the most abundant cell type in the pNF1 TME [ 20 ], produce a dense collagenous extracellular matrix (ECM), a hallmark of neurofibromas [ 21 ], and contribute to the formation of neurofibromas [ 22 , 23 , 24 ]. However, their precise roles in tumor formation and progression are still under-investigated. Therefore, delineating paracrine interactions between pNF1 cells and other cells in their microenvironment that mediate growth and invasiveness may help identify potential therapeutic targets for mono and combination therapies. Tumor cells grown in a two-dimensional (2D) monolayer culture do not replicate  in vivo  conditions of the physiological microenvironment including the structural architecture and stroma [ 25 , 26 ]. This has led to the development of alternative preclinical 3D culture models in which tumor cells are grown in an ECM [ 25 , 26 ]. Such 3D models provide an improved translational capacity for assessing the efficacy of a wide variety of therapies [ 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 ] and replicating the resistance to cytotoxic therapies that occurs  in vivo  [ 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 ]. We have developed 3D/4D (3D + time) culture models of pNF1 cells for screening of therapeutic targets associated with the growth of pNF1 [ 36 ] in real-time and over a period of time (4D). Our 3D/4D pNF1 culture models can be used for live-cell imaging and molecular and biochemical analyses of interactions between tumor cells and other cell types, e.g., fibroblasts, found in the TME of pNF1. Our 3D/4D coculture models expand typical  in vitro  analyses of pathobiological pathways to include dynamic and spatiotemporal processes as live cells interact in real-time [ 37 , 38 ]. Here, we assessed paracrine interactions of pNF1 cells and fibroblasts in a 3D culture system. Using our 3D pNF1 culture models, the present study demonstrates that pNF1 spheroids formed by pNF1 cells in cocultures with fibroblasts exhibit a significant increase in growth when compared with monocultures. In addition, the fibroblast secretome significantly increased the growth of pNF1 spheroids. This effect was ablated when sEVs were depleted from the fibroblast secretome. Our results suggest that paracrine interactions between tumor cells and fibroblasts via fibroblast-derived sEVs may be targeted to reduce the growth of pNF1 tumors.",

Fibroblasts Stimulate the Growth of pNF1 Spheroids in 3D Cultures To determine the effect of fibroblasts on the growth of pNF1 tumor cells within the TME, we compared the growth of two human pNF1 cell lines, ipNF95.11b C and ipNF05.5, when cultured in the absence or presence of human fibroblasts derived from pNF1 patients. Over a 6-day culture period, pNF1 cell lines formed 3D spheroid structures in monocultures. While there was a slight increase in the number of fibroblasts in the cocultures compared to the monocultures, a significant increase in the growth of pNF1 spheroids in the cocultures was observed ( Figure 2 A,C). An increase in the growth of pNF1 spheroids in the cocultures was verified by 3D quantitative analysis ( Figure 2 B,D). This result suggests that paracrine interactions between pNF1 spheroids and fibroblasts increase the growth of pNF1 spheroids. To further validate our observations on the increased growth in pNF1 spheroids resulting from paracrine interactions with fibroblasts, we compared the growth of pNF1 spheroids between pNF1 cell: fibroblast cocultures and pNF1 monocultures, which had an equal seeding density to the cocultures. Indeed, there was a significant increase in the growth of pNF1 spheroids in the cocultures compared to the pNF1 monocultures over a 6-day culture period ( Figure 3 A,B). In line with our previous observations, we confirmed the increased growth of pNF1 spheroids in cocultures with fibroblasts using a 3D MTT assay. The OD value of pNF1 spheroids and fibroblasts grown in cocultures was greater than the combination of each cell type grown in monocultures ( Figure 3 C). Collectively, these results reveal that paracrine interactions between pNF1 spheroids and fibroblasts enhance the growth of pNF1 tumor spheroids. 3.2. Fibroblast-Derived Secretome Increases the Growth of pNF1 Spheroids The observed increase in the growth of pNF1 spheroids in 3D cocultures with fibroblasts suggests that paracrine factors secreted from fibroblasts mediate tumor growth in pNF1 progression. Therefore, we investigated whether the observed increase in the growth of pNF1 spheroids with fibroblasts could be caused by paracrine secretory factors from fibroblasts. The effects of Fib-CM or control media (CtrlM) were compared in pNF1 monocultures over a 6-day culture period. The growth of pNF1 spheroids formed by ipNF95.11b C cells increased by about 2.5-fold in Fib-CM compared to those in control media ( Figure 4 A(a,b),B. An increase in pNF1 spheroid growth in the absence of direct contact with fibroblasts indicates that the fibroblast-derived secretome induces pNF1 cell growth via paracrine interaction. These results were consistent with ipNF05.5 cells under the same conditions. We observed about a 2-fold increase in cells in Fib-CM compared to those in control media ( Figure 4 A (c,d),C). 3.3. Fibroblast-Derived Secretome Stimulates the Growth and Invasive Outgrowth of pNF1 Spheroids To increase our understanding of the quantitative results, we sought to determine if there were differences in physical characteristics of pNF1 spheroids compared to pNF1 spheroids with Fib-CM. We performed Hoechst staining to examine the 3D structures of nuclei in pNF1 spheroids cultured in CtrlM and observed the development of large spheroid formations composed of multiple tumor cells in pNF1s cultured in Fib-CM but few in pNF1 cultured in CtrlM ( Figure 5 ). Moreover, pNF1 spheroids cultured in Fib-CM were significantly larger than pNF1s cultured in CtrlM, and the pNF1s cultured in Fib-CM exhibited multicellular invasive outgrowths from pNF1 spheroids at day 1 ( Figure 6 B), whereas these outgrowths were not observed under control media conditions ( Figure 6 A). Images taken four days later further highlighted how the fibroblast-derived secretome promotes cell growth. pNF1 spheroids grown in Fib-CM for five days demonstrated large cell clusters connected through long cell extensions ( Figure 6 D). pNF1 spheroids formed in the CtrlM, however, were much smaller and lacked long invasive outgrowths ( Figure 6 C). Considering the extensive outgrowths from pNF1 spheroids when incubated with Fib-CM, we performed a 3D invasion assay, as illustrated in  Figure 6 E, to determine the effect of the fibroblast-derived secretome on the local invasive character of pNF1 spheroids  in vivo  [ 13 ]. We observed a significant increase in the number of invasive cells exposed to Fib-CM compared to CtrlM ( Figure 6 F,G). In addition, the invasive pNF1 cells in the Fib-CM group were larger with longer extensions, suggesting that the morphological changes promoted by the fibroblast-derived secretome coincide with the increased invasiveness of the tumor cells ( Figure 6 F). These findings highlight how the fibroblast-derived secretome promotes the growth and invasiveness of pNF1 spheroids in pNF1 progression. 3.4. Fibroblast-Derived Small Extracellular Vesicles (sEVs), as a Paracrine Factor, Increase the Growth of pNF1 Spheroids To identify paracrine factors from fibroblasts that mediate the growth of pNF1 spheroids, we first performed a cytokine immunoarray targeting known proinflammatory cytokines and growth factors. Media were collected from 3D monocultures of pNF1 cells (ipNF95.11b C), fibroblasts, and the cocultures for analysis. We observed no differences in cytokine levels in the media from all three cultures ( Supplementary Figure S1 ). We next examined other factors that could mediate an increase in the growth of pNF1 spheroids through intercellular communication between tumor cells and fibroblasts. sEVs (30\u2013150 nm in diameter) are released by all types of cells including tumor cells and their surrounding cells, which include fibroblasts (see a review [ 40 ]). sEVs mediate intercellular communication by transferring their cargos to recipient cells, impacting cancer cell growth and migration/invasion (see a review [ 40 ]). We initially tested the effect of depleting the Fib-CM of sEVs by ultracentrifugation, as in our published protocols ( Supplementary Figure S2  and [ 39 ]). sEV-depleted Fib-CM exhibited ~ a 94% reduction in sEVs in the range of 30~150 nm. There was no growth of pNF1 spheroids when sEVs were depleted from the fibroblast-CM ( Figure 7 ): ipNF95.11b C ( Figure 7 A(a\u2013c),B) and ipNF05.5 ( Figure 7 A(d\u2013f),C). These results support the premise that sEVs derived from fibroblasts act as paracrine factors to enhance the growth of pNF1 spheroids.",
  "discussion": "5. Conclusions Using our 3D plexiform neurofibroma cultures, we found that the fibroblast secretome\u2014particularly, fibroblast-generated sEVs\u2014plays a critical role in increasing the growth and invasive character of pNF1 spheroids. Our results provide insights on how the TME contributes to increased tumor growth in pNF1 patients. Thus, paracrine interactions between tumor cells and fibroblasts may offer a therapeutic target to reduce the growth and invasiveness of pNF1 tumors.",
