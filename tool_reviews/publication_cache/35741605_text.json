  "title": "Integrated Drug Mining Reveals Actionable Strategies Inhibiting Plexiform Neurofibromas.",
  "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common genetic tumor predisposition syndromes, affecting up to 1 in 2500 individuals. Up to half of patients with NF1 develop benign nerve sheath tumors called plexiform neurofibromas (PNs), characterized by biallelic NF1 loss. PNs can grow to immense sizes, cause extensive morbidity, and harbor a 15% lifetime risk of malignant transformation. Increasingly, molecular sequencing and drug screening data from various preclinical murine and human PN cell lines, murine models, and human PN tissues are available to help identify salient treatments for PNs. Despite this, Selumetinib, a MEK inhibitor, is the only currently FDA-approved pharmacotherapy for symptomatic and inoperable PNs in pediatric NF1 patients. The discovery of alternative and additional treatments has been hampered by the rarity of the disease, which makes prioritizing drugs to be tested in future clinical trials immensely important. Here, we propose a gene regulatory network-based integrated analysis to mine high-throughput cell line-based drug data combined with transcriptomes from resected human PN tumors. Conserved network modules were characterized and served as drug fingerprints reflecting the biological connections among drug effects and the inherent properties of PN cell lines and tissue. Drug candidates were ranked, and the therapeutic potential of drug combinations was evaluated via computational predication. Auspicious therapeutic agents and drug combinations were proposed for further investigation in preclinical and clinical trials.",

Key packages used include synapser [ 24 ], tidyverse [ 25 ], dplyr [ 26 ], WGCNA [ 27 ], ggplot2 [ 28 ], enrichplot [ 29 ], and ConsensusClusterPlus [ 30 ]. The experimental data were provided by the NFhackathon 2020 competition, which were downloaded from  https://www.synapse.org  (syn4940963 and syn22336443, accessed on 1 October 2020). The code of the NFhackathon project can be found at  https://git.io/Jk2iR  (accessed on 25 April 2022).  2.2. Drug Screening, PN Cell Lines, and Primary PN Tissue Gene Expression Data The transcriptome data of PN cell lines were downloaded through NTAP PN Cell Culture Data Portal via syn22351884 [ 31 ] and NFhackathon 2020 via syn22336443 ( https://www.synapse.org , accessed on 1 October 2020). The drug screening data were contributed by Ferrer et al. using the Mechanism Interrogation PlatE (MIPE 4.0) library [ 6 ]. This library comprises 1912 small molecules with different categories. Most of the drugs in this library have known targets, and research has already demonstrated effective tumoricidal activity for specific cancer types. We queried drug information from the ChEMBL database, a manually curated database of bioactive molecules maintained by the European Bioinformatics Institute [ 32 ]. The statical term pCHEMBL is unique to this database and is designed to roughly compare efficacy across different molecules by standardizing the half-maximal response concentration, potency, and/or affinity on a negative logarithmic scale. We filtered our drug data using a cutoff of pChEMBL > 6. This cutoff empirically increases the reliability of the curated annotation. The general drug description of the MIPE 4.0 library is downloaded through syn17091507. In total, seven PN-derived cell lines were used, including control cells and multiple tumor lines, and of these, five cell lines had available transcriptome data, which were downloaded via syn22351884, including ipNF05.5 (mixed clone), ipNF05.5 (single clone), ipNF95.11bC, ipNF95.6, and ipnNF95.11c [ 6 , 33 ]. The human primary PN gene expression profiles used in this study were described in Jessan et al. [ 34 ]. Transcriptome data of thirteen human primary PN samples were characterized in their study, and the normalized data were downloaded through syn6130081.  2.3. Construction of Conserved Gene Regulation Networks The gene regulation networks were constructed using the WGCNA package. The standardized gene expression data of five PN cell lines were first filtered by the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD > 1000) to enrich highly expressed and variable genes and were then merged with the primary tumor transcriptomes to build a scale-free network. A soft-thresholding power of 8 was chosen based on the criterion of approximate scale-free topology [ 35 ]. The consensus gene regulation networks between PN cell lines and PN tumor tissues were established as 26 network modules and were labeled randomly using different color names. Nine modules were determined to be conserved, as defined by the Z-summary score >5 according to the package manual.  2.4. Construction of Consensus Drug Clustering To impartially identify drug clusters with consistently similar transcriptional patterns, we adapted the ConsensusClusterPlus package [ 30 ]. Drug clusters were determined according to the correlation coefficients between drug responses and the eigengene of conserved gene regulatory network modules. Parameters were tested according to the package manual. 2.5. Drug Combination Prediction The single drug dose\u2013response data were downloaded from  https://www.synapse.org  with syn5522627 (accessed on 1 June 2021). For each drug in the screening, drug responses were recorded as the cell viability at eleven different concentrations (\u00b5M), which were 0.000780415, 0.007023779, 0.002341244, 0.02107129, 0.063213917, 0.189641751, 0.5689253, 1.706775899, 5.120327696, 15.36098309, and 46.08294931. The two extreme concentrations in the screening, 0.000780415 and 46.08294931, were removed from the predictions. IDAPredict.2drug function package was used to predict the drug combination between DrugCluster pairs [ 23 ]. Combinations were ranked according to IDAcombo scores, with predicted drug concentrations.",

  "introduction": "1. Introduction Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a hereditary tumor predisposition syndrome with an incidence of 1 in every 2500 newborns. Approximately half of NF1 patients will develop a benign plexiform neurofibroma (PN), and 15% of PNs transform into a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) [ 1 , 2 ]. Because NF1 is a lifelong genetic syndrome, this condition uniquely requires treatments that confer a minimal side effect profile in order to permit long-term or recurrent drug administration [ 3 ]. The loss of NF1 potentiates RAS/MEK signaling, which is the hallmark molecular derangement in benign tumors arising from the Schwann cell lineage [ 4 ]. Despite the apparent simplicity of this pathoetiology, identifying effective pharmacotherapy has vexed the medical community. Indeed, Selumetinib is the sole FDA-approved drug to treat PNs, and it was not approved until 2019, and only for pediatric patients [ 5 ]. New drug targets and drug combinations are urgently needed to treat PNs and potentially inhibit or delay malignant progression in both children and adults. Drug development for rare conditions such as PNs is, however, limited by poor patient accrual, given low numbers of symptomatic tumors as well as geographic dispersion. Computer algorithms that can boost the predictive power of preclinical models are desperately needed to better utilize patient resources and time to develop novel treatments for PNs. Recent scientific and technological advancements have exponentially expanded the capacity of preclinical drug testing to identify plausible treatments for human diseases; however, these studies rarely translate into novel medications. The challenge of high-throughput preclinical studies to accurately mimic effective human treatments is likely related to the inability of in vitro conditions to approximate the physiologic and molecular milieu of the in vivo tumor microenvironment. Recently, a PN cell line-based drug screening was developed by Ferrer et al., which utilizes several immortalized cell lines tested with the MIPE 4.0 small chemical library [ 6 ]. While providing a much-needed platform for drug development, the inherent heterogeneity between different cell lines and the use of non-physiologic conditions in assays can introduce significant variability in the apparent cytotoxic effects of candidate drugs, which undermines downstream experimental verification [ 7 ]. This may explain the observation that while multiple drugs inhibit the hyperactive RAS/MEK signaling of NF1 tumor cells in cell culture, most tyrosine kinase inhibitors fail in vivo and in clinical trials [ 8 , 9 ]. So far, Selumetinib remains the most effective and best-tolerated MEK inhibitor in PN patients. Transcriptome-based gene network analysis is a commonly employed tool for understanding essential molecular signaling within model systems [ 10 , 11 ]. Gene network-based methodology can efficiently identify conserved signaling interactions by identifying co-regulated genes across different model organisms and reveal the correlation between gene networks and biological traits such as disease subtypes and patient survival. It has been employed in the study of glioblastoma [ 12 ], non-small-cell lung cancer [ 13 ], and osteosarcoma [ 14 ]. We aim to use this methodology to reduce background noise in the data and identify salient drug responses across different PN cell lines, and to highlight key molecular pathways that are conserved between cell lines and primary tumors that can be targeted to maximize the success rate of potential drug candidates. Identifying consensus gene networks through this methodology is a valuable tool to better predict efficacious treatments and thus legitimize subsequent validation studies in animals and humans.  Drug combination therapy serves as a fundamental strategy for cancer treatment in order to improve tumoricidal efficacy while reducing toxicities associated with high-dose drug monotherapy [ 15 , 16 , 17 ]. Pathway-based vertical drug combinations that target one major signaling cascade at upstream and downstream effectors or horizontal combinations that target parallel signaling cascades simultaneously have been adapted to optimize drug treatment strategies [ 18 , 19 ]. Additionally, combining drugs that are already FDA-approved, or that are actively being tested in clinical trials for other tumor types, may provide therapeutic shortcuts for drug development of rare tumors such as PNs [ 16 ]. Recent computational advancements have enabled more eloquent drug combination predictions using experimentally measured high-throughput in vitro monotherapy response data [ 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 ]. With a well-planned analytic approach, these methodologies can significantly expand treatment options for rare diseases and prioritize promising combinations for experimental testing. Therefore, we propose a systematic analysis method to mine data from PN drug screening and PN transcriptomes in order to characterize the drug response fingerprint, rank drug candidates according to conserved gene regulation network modules across human PNs and multiple cell lines, and reveal promising drug combinations guided by the molecular drug fingerprints for the treatment of PNs in NF1 patients.",
  "results": "3. Results 3.1. Design Principle and Workflow for Prioritized Drug Candidate Lists Tumor heterogeneity is one significant challenge when interpreting screening-based drug discovery. The data adapted in this analysis used human immortalized cell lines generated from primary PNs [ 33 ]. In addition to inter-individual germline genetic diversity contributing to physiologic differences across the cell lines, these cell lines were genetically modified to ensure that they can be cultivated indefinitely for the purpose of longitudinal drug studies. Immortality was achieved through genetic overexpression of mouse CDK4 and human TERT genes. While it is a common scientific practice to introduce such genetic manipulations in order to immortalize cell cultures, doing so alters the native biologic state and confounds the interpretation of drug responses across different cell lines. Thus, whereas the technique is necessary, it also presents additional challenges for interpreting data and verifying pertinent drug candidates. To tackle this, we identified consensus gene network modules between PN cell lines and primary PN tumors using the WGCNA package in the R programming environment [ 27 , 36 ]. Furthermore, we hypothesized that correlation between drug responses in cell culture and gene expression in preserved gene network modules can elucidate which drugs are more likely to recapitulate tumoricidal activity in follow-up in vivo experiments. In vitro drug cytotoxicity data were then correlated with the gene expression eigengenes of each preserved module. The resulting drugs were then submitted to unsupervised clustering to determine drug clusters that impact similar gene network modules. Drug fingerprints were defined according to the pattern of correlation coefficiency. Candidate List-1 summarizes the top-ranked candidates from each drug cluster. Drug combinations were evaluated by the IDAcombo package [ 23 ]. This algorithm relies on the principle of independent drug activation (IDA), which assumes that the expected effect of a combination of non-interacting drugs is best defined by the more efficacious drug in the combination. Whereas individual cell lines exhibit different sensitivities to the same drug combination, the overall average response across multiple cell lines is almost always greater than that of monotherapy because each cell line is proffered two or more drugs to which it may respond [ 37 ]. We predicted combinations with the guidance of drug fingerprints, and the promising drug combinations with Selumetinib were further prioritized as the Candidate List-2. The workflow utilized is demonstrated in  Figure 1 . 3.2. Preserved Network Modules Reveal Biological Consistencies across PN Models The transcriptomes of cell lines used in the drug screening and the untreated surgically-resected primary PN from Jessen et al. were downloaded through the NF Data Portal [ 34 ]. To identify the consensus gene regulatory network modules among PN cells and primary tumor tissue, we constructed a block-wise network using the WGCNA package (see Methods,  Supplementary Figure S1 ). Twenty-six network modules were defined with various module sizes and preservation as Z-summary scores ( Supplementary Table S1 ). Modules were labeled with different color names, and the module eigengene was defined as the first principal component of each module. The eigengene adjacency value codified the consensus preserved gene network modules from both PN cells and tumor tissue ( Figure 2 A\u2013C). The modules with Z-summary scores of more than 5 were selected as preserved modules among the different PN models, which included brown, blue, magenta, tan, pink, turquoise, salmon, yellow, and midnight-blue modules (hereafter referred to as \u201cpreserved modules\u201d, indicated with arrows in  Figure 2 A).  To interpret the biological features in preserved modules, we performed gene ontology (GO) analysis. The top enriched GO terms from the biological process category (GO:BP) in each conserved module are listed in  Supplementary Table S2 . The highly enriched GO:BP terms of blue and magenta modules were shown in  Figure 2 D,E. The \u201cRas protein signal transduction\u201d term is highly associated with the blue module, reflecting the cardinal feature of NF1-associated PNs. Interestingly, the magenta module is strongly enriched in a series of terms describing development regulation of the peripheral nervous system and interactions between neurons and Schwann cells. Specifically, in magenta, a subset of neural crest progenitor markers, such as NES, SOX10, ERBB3, and NGFR, were reported as highly expressed markers of Schwann cell progenitors and the signatures of stem-like tumor cells in NF1 tumors [ 4 , 38 ]. Genes in different preserved modules are summarized in  Supplementary Table S3 .  These results are consistent with the known pathoetiology of PNs that (1) loss of function of the NF1 gene potentiates the Ras pathway signaling [ 39 ] and (2) Schwann cell progenitors can serve as the cell of origin of PN and subsequently recruit NF1-heterozygous non-neoplastic cells into the tumor microenvironment [ 38 ]. The preserved modules from unsupervised analysis independently recapitulate PN tumor biology, providing validation for using this method to direct drug selection for further study.  3.3. Preserved Module-Based Drug Fingerprints and Candidate List-1  Drug responses in the screening were downloaded from the NF Data Portal. We preselected drugs by setting a cutoff of cell viability <55% for the inhibitory median response across PN cell lines. The inhibitory median response is defined by the area under the curve, reflecting the viability of the cells in the screening. This filter yielded 1831 drug candidates from 1912 oncology-focused compounds within the MIPE 4.0 library. The Pearson correlations between the eigengene of each preserved module and the response to each preselected drug were calculated, as demonstrated in a heatmap in  Supplementary Figure S2 . We then performed consensus clustering analysis on those drugs according to the correlation coefficiency (see Methods) and identified six drug clusters ( Figure 3 A). For each drug, the correlation coefficients related to each PN preserved network module serve as a unique drug fingerprint relevant to the biology of PNs ( Figure 3 B). In the MIPE4.0 library, 20% of drugs are currently FDA-approved, and 40% are undergoing active testing in clinical trials (2019 annotations). Limiting drug candidates to these two categories will allow for more immediate translation of our findings to clinical trials as the human safety and tolerability data are already defined. We filtered drug candidates by annotated statuses of FDA-approved, Phase II, and Phase III (advanced status hereafter) in each cluster and ranked these drugs according to the negative correlation between a given drug and any conserved module. Negative correlations imply that the genes in each module are downregulated with the increased drug concentration and can thus serve as potential treatment targets [ 40 ]. The top 15 drugs in each cluster that satisfied these criteria are listed in  Table 1 , and the completed Candidate List-1 can be found in  Supplementary Table S4 . Selumetinib was identified in Candidate List-1 DrugCluster 4, supporting the validity of our analysis strategy. 3.4. Drug-Fingerprint-Guided Combination Strategies The traditional evaluation of drug combinations is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and expensive, considering the numerous possibilities [ 41 ]. With the accessibility of drug screening data, applying computational prediction models to identify drug combinations offers an attractive alternative. Multiple methods have been utilized in predication, such as machine learning, drug similarity, and/or drug interactome [ 42 ]. With the drug fingerprints developed in this study, we were able to cluster the drugs, reflecting the corresponding biological relevance. A similar fingerprint pattern may suggest the common signaling cascade on the molecular level. Identification of Selumetinib-like drugs or combining Selumetinib with other candidates may provide more options to increase treatment efficacy, minimize toxicity and prevent drug resistance. The vertical combination strategy combines drugs targeting the same biological process or pathway, which has been adapted to minimize drug resistance mechanisms [ 43 ]. With biological relevance indicated by drug fingerprints, we propose to seek the drug candidates in the screening with a Selumetinib-like fingerprint and evaluate the vertical combination efficacy among the candidates. Selumetinib was localized in DrugCluster 4 and demonstrated negative correlations to all conserved network modules except for magenta ( Figure 4 A). Drug candidates that have advanced clinical status and demonstrate similar fingerprints as Selumetinib are enriched in DrugCluster1, DrugCluster2, and DrugCluster4 ( Figure 4 A).  To survey the combination potentials among the Selumetinib-like candidates, we adapted the two-drug combination algorithm from IDAcombo package, which predict the efficacy based on the single drug dosage\u2013response data. The important features of this methodology are that (1) the predictions are concentration-dependent and represent an average response across populations of cell lines, which mimic the efficacy evaluation in clinics and serve as guidance for experimental verification; (2) it scores the combinations to prioritize the predicted combinations [ 23 ]. The predicted IDAcomboscores are shown in the heatmap ( Figure 4 B). The detailed drug responses among the PN cell lines, known mechanisms, and targeted genes are summarized in  Supplementary Table S5 .  Analogous to the horizontal combination strategy, combining drugs with complementary fingerprint patterns may provide a therapeutic advantage by targeting different biological processes, such as DrugCluster 1 and 3, DrugCluster 2 and 6, and DrugCluster 4 and 5, demonstrated in the drug cluster fingerprints ( Figure 3 B). Selumetinib was located in DrugCluster 4, which has a drug fingerprint pattern that is complementary to DrugCluster 5. Therefore, we predicted the combination efficacy of Selumetinib and partner drugs from DrugCluster 5, which may direct salient treatment combinations for subsequent clinical trials. For those combinations with an IDAcombo score >1, their drug fingerprints and combination scores were demonstrated as color bar in the drug fingerprint heatmap ( Figure 4 C). Combinations between Selumetinib and DrugCluster 5 and all the predicted combinations from the above complementary drug clusters were summarized in  Supplementary Table S5 .",
