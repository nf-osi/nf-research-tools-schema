  "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIM: Plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) are benign tumors of the periph eral nerves sheath, which can damage neighboring organs, impair functions, cause pain and serious maxillofacial disfigurement, and have a high risk of malignant transformation. Complete resection is usually not possible since PNFs often extend through multiple layers of tissue. Therefore, it is necessary and beneficial to find a reasonable drug treatment for PNFs. Propranolol-treatment is the first-line therapy for infantile hemangiomas and the side effects are reversible and mostly benign. The present study aimed to examine the possible effect of propranolol for suppressing PNFs in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Paired primary Schwann-cell-rich cultures and fibroblast-rich cultures were obtained from 4 PNFs of unrelated patients. Human Schwann cells (HSCs) were used as the control. These cultures were treated with propranolol for 7 days at concentrations up to 150 μM. Cells were then measured for their viability and immune-stained with S100 to label the tumorous Schwann cells. RESULTS: Propranolol inhibited the viability of the tumorous Schwann cells in a dose-dependent manner, while did not substantially suppress viability of the non-tumorous fibroblasts derived from the same PNFs. CONCLUSION: Propranolol may provide a treatment option for suppressing the growth of PNFs.",
