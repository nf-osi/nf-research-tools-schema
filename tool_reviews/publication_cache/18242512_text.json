  "abstract": "Induction of abnormal proliferation by nonmyelinating schwann cells triggers  neurofibroma formation.  Zheng H(1), Chang L, Patel N, Yang J, Lowe L, Burns DK, Zhu Y.  Author information: (1)Division of Molecular Medicine and Genetics, Department of Internal Medicine,  University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.  Recent evidence suggests that alterations in the self-renewal program of  stem/progenitor cells can cause tumorigenesis. By utilizing genetically  engineered mouse models of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), we demonstrated that  plexiform neurofibroma, the only benign peripheral nerve sheath tumor with  potential for malignant transformation, results from Nf1 deficiency in fetal  stem/progenitor cells of peripheral nerves. Surprisingly, this did not cause  hyperproliferation or tumorigenesis in early postnatal period. Instead,  peripheral nerve development appeared largely normal in the absence of Nf1  except for abnormal Remak bundles, the nonmyelinated axon-Schwann cell unit,  identified in postnatal mutant nerves. Subsequent degeneration of abnormal Remak  bundles was accompanied by initial expansion of nonmyelinating Schwann cells. We  suggest abnormally differentiated Remak bundles as a cell of origin for  plexiform neurofibroma.  DOI: 10.1016/j.ccr.2008.01.002 PMID: 18242512 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",
  "methods": "Experimental Design: The proliferative effects of TNG908 and TNG462 on  MTAP -null and  MTAP  WT MPNST cell lines were examined using CellTiter-Glo assays. Target inhibition was verified by western blot. TNG908 and TNG462 were further profiled in two  MTAP -null MPNST patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Materials and Methods Whole genome sequencing Tumor samples were obtained from patients with NF1- or sporadic MPNSTs. The institutional review boards (IRB) at Washington University in St. Louis (IRB protocol #201203042) and Johns Hopkins University (IRB protocol #J1649) approved the use of deidentified patient samples, and subject demographic information, including age and sex, is reported previously ( 32 – 34 ). All patient samples were collected with informed written consent for research and IRB approval in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki ( 33 ). Whole genome sequencing (RRID: SCR_016637) was performed in prior studies ( 34 ) and queried to determine  MTAP  status. Cell culture Human JH-2-079, JH-2-002, JH-2-009, and JH-2-031 MPNST cell lines were obtained from the Johns Hopkins NF1 biospecimen repository and the Pratilas laboratory at Johns Hopkins University ( 32 ), and WU-356 cells were generated at Washington University in St. Louis. Cell lines are available upon request. Cells were cultured in growth media containing high-glucose DMEM with 10% FBS (cat. # 26140-079, Gibco Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Primocin (100 µg/mL, cat. # ant-pm-05, InvivoGen). The HAP1  MTAP -isogenic cell line pair was purchased from Horizon Discovery (HZGHC004894c005) and maintained in DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11965) containing 10% FBS (Corning, 35-081-CV). Cell cultures were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO 2  in humidified cell culture incubators. Cell lines were tested for  Mycoplasma  using MycoAlert Kit (Lonza) and authenticated by short tandem repeat profiling done by the Genome Engineering and Stem Cell Center at Washington University. Cell proliferation and cell death assays The HAP1  MTAP -isogenic cell line pair was seeded as a monolayer in 96-well plates in DMEM with 10% FBS on day 0 as described in Briggs and colleagues ( 35 ). On day 1, TNG908 ( 36 ), TNG462 (WO2022026892; ref.  37 ), or GSK3326595 (either from custom synthesis ( 38 ) or MedChemExpress HY-101563) were dosed using a Tecan D300e and normalized to highest class volume with DMSO (the final DMSO percentage was 0.2%). On day 8, a 50% volume of CellTiter-Glo (CTG) reagent was added to each well, and luminescence was detected using an EnVision plate reader. MPNST cell lines (JH-2-079, JH-2-002, WU-356, JH-2-009, and JH-2-031) were plated in 96-well plates in growth media at 2,000 (JH-2-079, JH-2-002, and WU-356), 1,000 (JH-2-031), or 100 cells/well (JH-2-009). The next day, cells were treated with MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors, TNG908 ( 36 ) or TNG462 ( 37 ), GSK3326595, and/or chemotherapy drugs (doxorubicin or trabectedin) for 7 to 14 days. Assay length and cell density at plating were determined by the doubling time of each cell line. After 7- to 14-day treatment, the proliferation effects of MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors on MPNST cell lines was determined using CTG assay as per the manufacturer’s instructions. For cell death assays, YOYO-1 green fluorescent dye (50 nmol/L, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to the treatment medium, and cells were imaged every 2 hours by IncuCyte S3 Live-Cell Analysis System (Essen Bioscience, Sartorius) and analyzed by IncuCyte image analysis software (Sartorius). Cell death was calculated as the number of green fluorescent objects normalized to percent cell confluence and the initial timepoint for each well. For all cell lines, the data were plotted as % of the DMSO control wells for each cell line and fitted using the 4-parameter logistic Hill equation using GraphPad Prism (RRID: SCR_002798). Drug combination synergy analysis For calculation of synergy for combination studies, cell viability dose response data from CTG assays were normalized to vehicle control and analyzed using SynergyFinder Plus software (RRID: SCR_019318) and the highest single agent (HSA) model. SynergyFinder Plus software calculated the mean synergy score and a  P  value for the entire matrix ( 39 ). Synergy values >10 were considered synergistic, −10 to 10 was additive, and <−10 was antagonistic. SDMA in-cell western assay HAP1  MTAP  WT or  MTAP -null cells were seeded as a monolayer in 384-well plates and incubated at 37°C for 16 to 24 hours as described in Briggs and colleagues ( 35 ). The next day, test compounds or DMSO control were dispensed at the indicated concentrations ( n  = 4), and cells were incubated with compounds for 24 hours. Pemrametostat (GSK3326595; generated by either custom synthesis ( 38 ) or MedChemExpress HY-101563) served as a plate control. Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde, washed/permeabilized with 1× PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked with 1× TBS with 5% goat serum, and incubated overnight at 4°C with a primary SDMA antibody cocktail (Cell Signaling Technology, cat. # 13222). Cells were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour with a near-IR fluorescent secondary antibody cocktail that also contains DRAQ5 (LiCor, cat. # 926-32211). Cells were washed, and plates were imaged using a near-IR fluorescent imager (LiCor Odyssey). Assay background was determined by the signal detected from cells treated with 1 µmol/L GSK3326595. For data analysis, the SDMA signal was normalized to the DRAQ5 signal, and the background was subtracted. Data were plotted as percent of the DMSO control wells for the  MTAP  WT and the  MTAP -null cell lines independently. WES western analysis in MPNST cell lines MPNST cell lines (JH-2-002, JH-2-009, JH-2-031, JH-2-079, and MPNST-724) were seeded in 6-well plates at 150,000 cells/well in growth media. After 48 hours, cells were washed with 1× PBS and lysed in 1× Cell Lysis Buffer (Cell Signaling Technology). Protein lysates were loaded in equal quantities, and proteins were separated on the WES capillary electrophoresis western system (ProteinSimple, Bio-Techne) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Compass SimpleWestern software (ProteinSimple) was used to quantitate protein levels. Primary antibodies were against MTAP (Cell Signaling Technology, cat. # 4158, RRID: AB_1904054), PRMT5 (Cell Signaling Technology, cat. # 79998, RRID: AB_2799945), caspase 3 (Cell Signaling Technology, cat. # 9662, RRID: AB_331439), PARP-1 (Cell Signaling Technology, cat. # 9542, RRID: AB_2160739), and vinculin (Cell Signaling Technology, cat. # 13901, RRID: AB_2728768). Quantified protein levels were normalized to total protein levels. Immunoblotting Protein lysates were generated by frozen tumor tissue in RIPA buffer supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, P8340). Samples were normalized by protein concentration using Pierce Rapid Gold BCA Protein Assay Kit ( A53225 ). SDS-PAGE was run using NuPAGE 4% to 12% Bis-Tris Protein Gels (Invitrogen, cat. # NP0322BOX). SDMA (Cell Signaling Technology, cat. # 13222, RRID: AB_2714013), MTAP (Cell Signaling Technology, cat. # 4158, RRID: AB_1904054), and vinculin (Cell Signaling Technology, cat. # 13901, RRID: AB_2728768) antibodies were diluted 1:1,000. HRP-conjugated species-specific secondary antibodies were used and signal was detected using Bio-Rad ChemiDoc. Control lysates were generated from human KP4 pancreatic carcinoma cell line–derived xenograft models that were engineered to either express an empty vector or an  MTAP  cDNA as previously described ( 35 ). PDX lines The WU-356 and WU-386 MPNST PDX lines were described previously ( 33 ) and maintained through passage in mice. \n In vivo  pharmacology Mice were housed and treated in compliance with our approved protocol for the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Washington University (protocol #22-0157). Female immunodeficient nude ( Foxn1 nu /Foxn1 ) mice (strain #007850, The Jackson Laboratory, RRID: IMSR_JAX:007850) at 4 to 6 weeks old were implanted on the subcutaneous dorsal surface with one of two  nu MTAP -null MPNST PDX lines, WU-356 or WU-386 (single-cell suspension of 3 × 10 6  cells per mouse). Tumors were monitored by calipers three times per week, and tumor volume was calculated by the formula volume = 0.52 × length × width × width. When tumors reached a volume of 50 to 150 mm 3 , mice were randomized into groups (6–7 mice per group) and treated with vehicle control or the indicated doses of TNG908 or TNG462 as described in Briggs and colleagues ( 35 ). Mice were dosed with compounds formulated in 5% DMA/20% Captisol in water twice per day by oral gavage for 3 to 6 weeks. For data analysis, efficacy was defined as either tumor growth inhibition % ΔT/ΔC = [(treated TV final  − TV initial )/(vehicle TV final  − TV initial )] × 100 or tumor regression %TV = [mean TV final  − mean TV initial ]/mean TV initial  × 100. Comparisons between tumor volumes on the last day of group measurement were calculated with mixed-effects analysis without multiplicity adjustment (Fisher least significant difference test) using GraphPad Prism version 10 (RRID: SCR_002798) for all models.",
  "introduction": "Introduction Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are clinically aggressive soft tissue sarcomas composed of neoplastic Schwann cells ( 1 ). MPNSTs occur both sporadically and in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a common genetic tumor predisposition syndrome affecting 1:2,500 to 3,000 individuals ( 2 ,  3 ). In the setting of NF1, MPNSTs arise from malignant transformation of a benign precursor lesion, plexiform neurofibroma (PN), and the subsequent premalignant atypical neurofibromatous neoplasm of uncertain biologic potential ( 4 ). Despite aggressive treatment, including surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy, MPNSTs can recur in about half of patients, and most people die within 5 years of diagnosis ( 5 – 7 ). Treatment for metastatic disease is limited to cytotoxic chemotherapy, which is minimally effective ( 4 ). Additionally, to date, no clinical trial using a targeted therapy has shown efficacy for treatment of MPNSTs ( 4 ), which underscores the need for development of biomarker-driven therapies. Most MPNSTs are characterized by inactivation of the  NF1  gene, which encodes the Ras GTPase-activating protein neurofibromin ( 8 ). Multiple mouse genetic studies indicate that loss of the  Nf1  gene is only sufficient for benign PN formation ( 9 – 11 ), whereas transformation to MPNST requires additional genetic mutations. Loss of  CDKN2A  is reported to occur in the transition from PN to atypical neurofibromatous neoplasm of uncertain biologic potential ( 12 ,  13 ), whereas alterations in  TP53  and the polycomb repressor complex 2 genes ( EED/SUZ12 ) have been identified as cooperating secondary genetic alterations that promote MPNST development ( 14 – 17 ). In collaboration with the Genomics of MPNST consortium, we previously detected somatic biallelic inactivation of  CDKN2A  in 63% (40/64) of NF1-related MPNSTs and 55% (17/31) of sporadic MPNSTs ( 18 ). Homozygous deletion of  CDKN2A , one of the most common genetic alterations in all cancer, commonly involves the loss of neighboring genes on chromosome 9p, including methylthioadenosine phosphorylase ( MTAP ). Therefore,  MTAP  deletions are prevalent in 10% to 15% of all human cancers, whereas some types of cancer, including glioblastoma, mesothelioma, melanoma, urothelial carcinoma, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, can have  MTAP  deletion rates as high as 15% to 42% ( 19 – 21 ). Consistent with the high prevalence of  CDKN2A  deletion in MPNSTs, 25% to 50% of MPNSTs also have homozygous  MTAP  deletion, suggesting an opportunity for synthetic lethality-based therapies to address the unmet need in MPNST treatment ( 18 – 20 ). Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 ( PRMT5 ) is an essential gene that plays pivotal roles in cellular homeostasis because of its regulation of the epigenome, transcription and RNA splicing, as well as apoptotic pathways through symmetric methylation of key guanidino nitrogens of substrate proteins (known as symmetric dimethyl arginine or SDMA). PRMT5 was validated as a selective dependency in  MTAP -deleted ( MTAP -null) cancer cells, a type of synthetic lethal relationship termed collateral lethality ( 22 – 26 ). MTAP is a key component of the methionine salvage pathway and the only reported enzyme capable of catabolizing its substrate, methylthioadenosine (MTA). Therefore, when MTAP is lost, commonly due to homozygous deletion, MTA accumulates. MTA is structurally similar to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and functions as a SAM-competitive inhibitor of PRMT5. MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors, such as TNG908 and TNG462, selectively bind to the PRMT5·MTA complex, effectively inhibiting PRMT5 in  MTAP -null cancer cells while sparing normal,  MTAP -proficient [ MTAP  wild-type (WT)] cells. A major impediment to drug development is the lack of preclinical models that accurately represent the genetic heterogeneity of MPNSTs ( 27 ). Recent clinical trials have failed to yield effective therapies, which likely reflects the limitations of using one mouse MPNST model system ( Nf1 +/− ;  Trp 53 +/−  mice) and the small number of available human tumor xenograft models ( 28 – 31 ). To evaluate the potential clinical benefit of TNG908 and TNG462 in MPNSTs, we leveraged our collection of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) lines that were generated to more accurately reflect the genetic heterogeneity of MPNSTs ( 32 – 34 ). These lines provide an essential tool for the field both for preclinical testing of new therapeutic targets and to gain a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of MPNSTs. In this study, we evaluated the activity of two MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors, TNG908 and TNG462, in preclinical MPNST PDX models. We found that both TNG908 and TNG462 selectively inhibited the proliferation of  MTAP -null MPNST cell lines compared with  MTAP  WT MPNST cell lines. Target inhibition by both compounds was confirmed by a reduction in SDMA protein levels in  MTAP -null, but not  MTAP  WT, MPNST cells. Finally, TNG908 and TNG462 treatment drove dose-dependent suppression of tumor growth, including inducing tumor regressions, in two  MTAP -null MPNST PDX models, WU-356 and WU-386.",
  "results": "Results: We identified homozygous loss of the  MTAP  gene in ∼54% (7/13) of MPNST PDX lines. Two MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors, TNG908 and TNG462, reduced cell viability in  MTAP -null, but not  MTAP  WT, HAP1  MTAP -isogenic cell lines. TNG908 and TNG462 selectively decreased cell viability and stimulated cell death in  MTAP -null MPNST cells compared with  MTAP  WT MPNST cells. Finally, TNG908 and TNG462 drove dose-dependent antitumor activity, including tumor regressions in two  MTAP -null MPNST PDX models, WU-356 and WU-386, at well-tolerated doses. Results \n MTAP  deletion in human MPNST PDX lines PDXs more accurately represent the heterogeneity of human MPNSTs in the testing of antitumor drugs ( 34 ). We previously established a series of 13 PDX lines derived from human MPNST samples, which were characterized prior to use in preclinical studies ( 34 ). To generate MPNST PDX lines, primary tumor pieces were engrafted and serially passaged in immunodeficient NRG mice ( Fig. 1A ). We identified  CDKN2A  somatic structural variants in about 70% (9/13) of these PDX lines, with partial homozygous loss in two other PDX lines ( Table 1 ; ref.  34 ). Whereas  CDKN2A  status was the same in most of the matching tumor and PDX MPNST lines, we found homozygous loss in the PDX, but not in the primary tumor, in two MPNST lines (JH-2-055 and MN-2), suggesting genetic heterogeneity in the primary tumors ( Table 1 ). Because the  MTAP  gene is located in close proximity to the  CDKN2A  gene on chromosome 9p and both genes are often lost simultaneously, we queried the WGS data for  MTAP . In these PDX lines, we observed homozygous loss of the  MTAP  gene in 7 of 13 PDX tumor pairs (54%), which is consistent with the percentage reported previously ( Table 1 ; ref.  18 ). More than half of the PDX lines with loss of  CDKN2A  also had homozygous loss of  MTAP , and  MTAP  was only deleted in conjunction with  CDKN2A  loss ( Table 1 ). Figure 1.

In normal cells, PRMT5 and SAM form an active complex, in which PRMT5 catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from SAM to arginine residues on histone and nonhistone proteins, thereby affecting chromatin remodeling, gene expression, and mRNA processing. However, in  MTAP -null cancer cells, inactive PRMT5·MTA complexes accumulate, and the cells become more vulnerable to PRMT5 inhibition ( 25 ,  26 ). In line with this, genetic depletion of PRMT5 has previously been reported to impair cancer cell viability by promoting cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis ( 40 ,  41 ). To exploit this vulnerability, the MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors, TNG908 and TNG462, were developed to preferentially target  MTAP -null cancer cells while sparing  MTAP  WT normal cells ( Fig. 1C  and  D ; refs.  35 ,  37 ). MTA binds to PRMT5 and, as reported previously, MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors bind preferentially to the PRMT5·MTA complex, leading to selective inhibition of PRMT5 in  MTAP -null cancer cells ( 35 ,  36 ). SDMA is the most proximal pharmacodynamic marker for PRMT5, and PRMT5 is the primary methyltransferase capable of conferring the mark; therefore, changes in SDMA-modified protein levels are the most relevant evidence of on-target PRMT5 inhibition. TNG908 and TNG462 are both MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors, though they are differentiated by their properties. TNG908 is 15× more selective for  MTAP -null cells relative to  MTAP  WT cells ( Fig. 1E ; Supplementary Fig. S1A and S2B) and was reported to be brain-penetrant in nonhuman primates ( 35 ,  36 ). This  in vitro  selectivity is consistent with the previously reported selectivity of TNG908 in  MTAP -null xenografts relative to MTAP WT xenografts in mice ( 35 ,  36 ). TNG462 is >25× more potent and 3× more selective for MTAP-null cells relative to TNG908 but is not brain-penetrant in preclinical species ( Fig. 1E ; Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B; ref.  37 ). In contrast to TNG908 and TNG462, non–MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors like the SAM-uncompetitive PRMT5 inhibitor, GSK3326595 (pemrametostat), inhibit PRMT5 indiscriminately and do not selectively target  MTAP -null cancer cells ( Fig. 1E  and Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B). MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors are cytotoxic to  MTAP -null MPNST cells To explore the roles of  MTAP  deletion and PRMT5 in MPNST pathology, we evaluated the  in vitro  efficacy of two MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors, TNG908 and TNG462, in MPNST models. First, MTAP and PRMT5 protein levels were analyzed in a panel of  MTAP -null and  MTAP  WT MPNST cell lines ( Fig. 2A  and  B ). Consistent with  Fig. 1E , TNG908 and TNG462 demonstrated concentration-dependent antiproliferative activity in the  MTAP -null MPNST cell lines, JH-2-079, JH-2-002, and WU-356, at IC 50  values 10-100X less than in the  MTAP  WT MPNST cell lines, JH-2-009 and JH-2-031 ( Fig. 2C  and  D ). In addition, TNG462 showed increased potency of ∼10× compared with TNG908, which is consistent with the data generated in the HAP1  MTAP -isogenic cell lines ( Fig. 1E ). However, the SAM-uncompetitive PRMT5 inhibitor, GSK3326595 (pemrametostat), did not show selectivity between  MTAP -null and  MTAP  WT MPNST cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). Figure 2. MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors are efficacious and selective in  MTAP -null MPNST cell lines.  A,  MTAP and PRMT5 protein levels were determined by WES western analysis in human MPNST cell lines.  B,  Densitometry for MTAP and PRMT5 protein levels in MPNST cell lines, normalized to vinculin loading control.  C  and  D, MTAP  WT MPNST cells (JH-2-009 and JH-2-031) and  MTAP -null MPNST (JH-2-079, JH-2-002, and WU-356) cells were treated with the indicated doses of MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors, ( C ) TNG908 or ( D ) TNG462, for 7 to 14 days. Cell viability was examined by CTG assay, and assay length was determined by the doubling time of each cell line. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM. MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors induce cell death in  MTAP -null MPNST cells We next investigated whether the antiproliferative activity demonstrated by MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors in  MTAP -null MPNST cells was because of cell death. MPNST cell lines were treated with TNG908 or TNG462 for 7 days in IncuCyte Live-Cell Imaging studies that monitor cell death. In  Fig. 3A  and  B , both inhibitors of PRMT5 induced cell death in  MTAP -null cells (JH-2-079, JH-2-002, and WU-356) and  MTAP  WT cells (JH-2-009 and JH-2-031). The induction of cell death correlated with the potency of the compounds in  Fig. 2C  and  D . Markers of apoptosis were also evaluated by WES western analysis. Treatment with TNG908 and TNG462 increased cleavage of caspase 3 and/or PARP-1 proteins in  MTAP -null MPNST cell lines and, to a lesser extent, in  MTAP  WT MPNST cell lines, suggesting that these MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors can act through apoptotic pathways ( Fig. 3C ). Figure 3. MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors induce cell death in MPNST cell lines.  A–C, MTAP  WT (JH-2-009 and JH-2-031) and  MTAP -null (JH-2-079, JH-2-002, and WU-356) MPNST cells were treated with the indicated doses of PRMT5 inhibitors, TNG908 or TNG462, for 7 days.  A  and  B,  Cell death was determined by IncuCyte assay using YOYO-1 dye. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM. *,  P  < 0.05 versus vehicle control.  C,  Apoptotic protein levels, total or cleaved (Cl) PARP-1 or caspase (Casp) 3, were determined by WES western analysis. Cytotoxic effects of common chemotherapy drugs are not selective To determine how the activity of MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors compares to common chemotherapeutics used for the treatment of sarcoma, MPNST cell lines were treated with either doxorubicin or trabectedin. Both doxorubicin and trabectedin inhibited cell viability of JH-2-009 and JH-2-079 cells ( Fig. 4A  and  B ; Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B). In  MTAP -null JH-2-079 cells, the effective dose of doxorubicin ( Fig. 4A ) was similar to the more potent MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitor, TNG462 ( Fig. 2C  and  D ), whereas trabectedin was effective at a much lower dose ( Fig. 4B ). However, the potency of each chemotherapeutic agent was similar in both the  MTAP  WT (JH-2-009) and  MTAP -null (JH-2-079) cell lines ( Fig. 4A  and  B ), indicating that these drugs do not show selectivity for  MTAP -null MPNST cells. In addition, these chemotherapeutic drugs were not selective for MPNST versus HEK293 cells, an immortalized human embryonic kidney cell line used as a surrogate for toxicity in normal cells ( Fig. 4A  and  B ). These data highlight the potential therapeutic index for MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors relative to common chemotherapeutics. Figure 4. Common chemotherapeutic drugs have an additive effect on inhibition of cell viability when combined with MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors in MPNST cell lines.  A,  JH-2-009 ( MTAP  WT MPNST), JH-2-079 ( MTAP -null MPNST), and HEK293 ( MTAP  WT kidney) cells were treated with the indicated doses of doxorubicin for 7 to 14 days, and cell viability was determined by CTG assay.  B,  JH-2-009, JH-2-079, and HEK293 cells were incubated with trabectedin for 7 to 14 days, and cell viability was determined by CTG assay. Assay length was determined by the doubling time of each cell line. Data are presented as the mean ± SD.  C  and  D,  Cell viability in ( C ) JH-2-002 and ( D ) JH-2-079 cells was determined by CTG assay after 7-day incubation with drugs. Synergy was analyzed using SynergyFinder software by the HSA method. Heatmaps with red intensity indicating the synergy score for each dose combination, with green indicating antagonism. Combination benefit of PRMT5 inhibition and chemotherapeutics Given the challenging nature of MPNST treatment as well as our data demonstrating the effectiveness of MTA-cooperative PRMT5i and chemotherapy drugs as single agents in MPNST cells  in vitro , we also examined the combination of PRMT5 inhibitors with chemotherapeutics in CTG cell viability assays. In  MTAP -null JH-2-002 cells, the combination of TNG462 with doxorubicin had an overall additive effect on inhibition of cell viability (mean synergy score: 5.84;  Fig. 4C ). Likewise, the combination of TNG908 and trabectedin was also additive in reducing cell viability in  MTAP -null JH-2-079 cells (mean synergy score: 7.44;  Fig. 4D ). However, the combinations did not reach the level of synergy across multiple chemotherapeutic dose levels (mean synergy score >10). Similar additive effects were observed with other combinations of PRMT5i and chemotherapy drugs in multiple MPNST cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S4A–S4D). TNG908 and TNG462 inhibit tumor growth of  MTAP -null MPNST PDX lines Two MPNST PDX mouse models were used to examine the effects of the PRMT5 inhibitors  in vivo . The JH-2-079 and JH-2-009 cells used  in vitro  ( Figs. 2 – 4 ) do not engraft well; therefore, two other  MTAP -null PDX lines (WU-386 and WU-356) were chosen for  in vivo  mouse studies. Mice were implanted subcutaneously with WU-386 or WU-356 PDX lines, and treatments with compound or vehicle were initiated once tumors reached 50 to 150 mm 3 . The doses of each molecule were determined by previous studies ( 35 – 37 ). TNG908 dosed at 120 mg/kg twice per day significantly reduced tumor growth to 19% of control in the WU-356 PDX model ( Fig. 5A ). TNG462 demonstrated dose-dependent antitumor activity in the WU-356 PDX model with up to 80% tumor regression ( Fig. 5B  and  C ). Similar trends were observed with TNG908 and TNG462 treatments in WU-386 PDX mice ( Fig. 5D–F ). Consistent with the increased selectivity and potency of TNG462 relative to TNG908, we observed tumor regressions in four of seven mice in the WU-386 model and all mice in the WU-356 model ( Fig. 5C  and  F ). In the WU-356 PDX model, tumors were followed for an additional 3 weeks after discontinuing TNG462 treatment, and tumors did not exhibit rebound growth more than the initial tumor volume (Supplementary Fig. S5). TNG908 or TNG462 treatments were well-tolerated as mice did not lose weight or show adverse health effects (Supplementary Fig. S6A–S6D). The antitumor activity of each compound was on-target as dose-dependent SDMA inhibition was observed in terminal tumors collected at either 8 or 16 hours after the last dose ( Fig. 5G  and  H ). These data demonstrate that MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors exhibited dose-dependent efficacy at well-tolerated doses in mice, consistent with tumor-selective PRMT5 inhibition. Figure 5.

  "discussion": "Conclusions: Clinical-stage MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors TNG908 and TNG462 are efficacious in MPNST models  in vitro  and  in vivo ; therefore, MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors are promising therapeutic agents for patients with  MTAP -deleted MPNSTs. \n \n \n See related commentary by Sheehan et al., p. 4620 \n Discussion Existing therapeutic strategies for MPNST have proven largely insufficient, in part because of the difficulty in preclinical modeling of this heterogeneous, aggressive sarcoma. In this study, we utilized PDX tumor models to address this gap and pursue the development of biomarker-driven therapies. This study reports several major findings: (i) homozygous loss of the  MTAP  gene occurs in 54% (7/13) of MPNST PDX lines; (ii) two MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors, TNG908 and TNG462, decreased viability selectively in  MTAP -null MPNST cells and HAP1 isogenic cells; (iii) TNG908 and TNG462 induced apoptosis selectively in  MTAP -null MPNST cells; (iv) TNG908 and TNG462 dose-dependently suppressed tumor growth in two  MTAP -null MPNST PDX models, WU-356 and WU-386; and (v) target inhibition by both compounds was confirmed by substantially reduced SDMA-modified protein levels  in vitro  in the HAP1  MTAP -isogenic cell lines and  in vivo  in the WU-356 and WU-386  MTAP -null PDX tumors. In addition, to our knowledge, this is the first study to report tumor regression in MPNST PDX mouse models. Thus, these early clinical trial–stage MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors, TNG908 and TNG462, have the potential to benefit a significant number of patients with MPNST with  MTAP  deletion. Loss of  MTAP  accompanying  CDKN2A  loss on chromosome 9p is common in many types of cancer, including melanoma, glioblastoma, bladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, and MPNST ( 25 ). Homozygous  MTAP  loss is observed in 25% to 50% of MPNSTs ( 18 – 20 ), and in this study we report  MTAP  deletion in 54% of our MPNST PDX cell lines ( Table 1 ). Importantly, though the JH-2-079 PDX line was found to only have a homozygous partial gene deletion of  MTAP , it was still found to lose protein expression of MTAP, suggesting that it is functionally lost. MTAP protein is an important enzyme in the methionine salvage pathway, and loss of MTAP in cancer cells leads to accumulation of its substrate, MTA, making cells selectively vulnerable to PRMT5 inhibition in a synthetic lethal relationship. PRMT5 plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including gene expression, mRNA splicing, and DNA repair, and its selective dependency in  MTAP -deleted cancer cells makes it an attractive therapeutic target. MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors, such as TNG908 and TNG462, have recently emerged as potential anticancer agents. By preferentially binding to the inactive PRMT5·MTA complex, MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors selectively inhibit PRMT5 enzymatic activity in  MTAP -null cells while largely sparing  MTAP  WT cells. This inhibition results in decreased arginine methylation of histones and other cellular proteins, ultimately affecting transcriptional regulation and protein function. Our  in vitro  studies indicate that the MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors, TNG908 and TNG462, induce apoptosis in  MTAP -null MPNST cells ( Fig. 3 ). However, the deep and durable tumor regressions observed  in vivo  with TNG462 treatment suggest that the apoptotic activity observed  in vitro  may be an underestimation or indicate that other mechanisms may contribute to cell death ( Fig. 5 ). The selective inhibition of PRMT5 offers potential therapeutic benefits, as PRMT5 dysregulation is frequently observed in various cancer types ( 18 ,  25 ). Despite significant clinical and therapeutic advancements, MPNSTs remain challenging to manage due to their aggressive nature, high recurrence rates, and limited treatment options ( 4 ). In recent years, efforts have been made to explore novel therapeutic strategies to improve patient outcomes and extend survival. Currently, treatment of advanced or metastatic MPNSTs is typically limited to chemotherapy or clinical trials, and 5-year survival rates have remained low at 16% to 52% ( 42 ,  43 ). Patients with relapsed or refractory MPNSTs participating in one of five Sarcoma Alliance for Research through Collaboration (SARC) phase II trials had a median progression-free survival of less than 2 months, and the 4-month progression-free survival rate was 15% ( 44 ). Thus, the development of more effective targeted drugs is needed to improve patient survival. In addition, treatments that selectively target tumors (e.g., MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors in  MTAP -null tumors) are generally better tolerated by patients than standard chemotherapeutic drugs (e.g., doxorubicin and trabectedin). Whereas our  in vitro  cell viability studies found that doxorubicin and trabectedin ( Fig. 4A  and  B ) are at least as efficacious as the PRMT5 inhibitors ( Fig. 2C  and  D ), they were not selective for  MTAP -null cells and were as cytotoxic to normal,  MTAP  WT cells, illustrating the cytotoxicity of these chemotherapy drugs in noncancer cells in the body. Preclinical studies with TNG908 and TNG462 have demonstrated promising  in vivo  anticancer activity across multiple cancer models ( 35 – 37 ), including two  MTAP -null MPNST PDX models in this current study. These inhibitors have shown efficacy in suppressing cancer cell viability  in vitro  and tumor growth  in vivo  in other cancer models, including glioblastoma, lung, pancreatic, bladder, and gallbladder cancers ( 35 – 37 ). Furthermore, their combination with other targeted therapies, e.g., KRAS, EGFR, and MEK inhibitors, has shown synergistic effects ( 45 ,  46 ), suggesting potential for combination therapy strategies. Indeed, in this study, we show an additive effect of the combination of PRMT5 (TNG462 or TNG908) with chemotherapy drugs (doxorubicin or trabectedin). Drug combinations have the potential advantage of improving efficacy while allowing for lower doses of each individual drug and possibly lowering adverse effects. MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors represent a promising class of targeted therapeutics for cancer treatment. Preclinical and early clinical findings suggest their potential efficacy as single agents or in combination with other therapies. TNG462 is currently being evaluated in a phase I/II clinical trial to investigate the safety, tolerability, dosing, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy in advanced or metastatic solid tumors with homozygous  MTAP  deletion ( 36 ). MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors may provide a valuable addition to current anticancer therapies, holding the potential to improve patient outcomes in the future ( 47 ). Whereas MPNSTs are highly aggressive, we observed robust responses in two aggressive PDX models. Tumors treated with the first-generation MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitor, TNG908, had a small increase in volume after 3 weeks ( Fig. 5A  and  D ). Excitingly, TNG462 suppressed tumor growth in mice for 5 to 6 weeks, and, indeed, induced tumor regression in 4/7 mice in the WU-386 PDX model and all mice in the WU-356 PDX model ( Fig. 5B, C, E , and  F ). TNG462 is the first monotherapy in which we have been able to demonstrate sustained tumor regression in MPNST PDX models. In addition, both TNG462 and TNG908 dose-dependently reduced SDMA levels in MPNST PDX tumors, indicating that the action of these compounds was on-target ( Fig. 5G  and  H ). Unfortunately, the changes in SDMA levels with TNG462 and TNG908 treatments were not directly comparable because they were generated from two different PDX models (WU-386 and WU-356), run on two separate immunoblots, and performed on terminal tumors with quite different tumor volumes. However, the isogenic studies in  Fig. 1E  provide a more robust demonstration of the greater selectivity and potency of TNG462 relative to TNG908. Additionally, due to the pleiotropic nature of PRMT5 activity, further studies are necessary to understand what factors are driving loss of MPNST tumor viability. Taken together, these data provide the rationale for a clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibition in MPNSTs.",
