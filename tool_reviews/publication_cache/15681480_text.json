  "abstract": "Sensitive detection of deletions of one or more exons in the neurofibromatosis  type 2 (NF2) gene by multiplexed gene dosage polymerase chain reaction.  Diebold R(1), Bartelt-Kirbach B, Evans DG, Kaufmann D, Hanemann CO.  Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, University of Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, 89070  Ulm, Germany.  Mutation detection in the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) gene is challenging  because when combining mutation detection methods such as single-strand  conformational polymorphism and heteroduplex analysis, denaturing gradient gel  electrophoresis, and direct sequencing of aberrant polymerase chain reaction  (PCR) fragments only 30 to 60% of the constitutional mutations are detected.  Because large deletions and complete chromosome rearrangements are also  described methods such as microarray-comparative genomic hybridization and  fluorescence in situ hybridization are also used. The one type of mutation often  missed corresponds to deletions encompassing one or few exons. To detect this  type we have developed a swift and reliable method. We perform a gene dosage  analysis with two fluorescent multiplex PCR assays that amplify 15 of the 17 NF2  exons. The labeled PCR products are quantified and gene dose is calculated with  respect to controls. We tested the reliability of this method with DNA from  eight NF2 patients with known heterozygous NF2 deletions, eight controls and  four unknown NF2 patients. In all of the patients with known heterozygous  deletions we found in several exons a reduction of gene dosage to 50 to 69%. In  one NF2 patient with previously unknown mutation and a severe phenotype we found  the gene dosage of two exons reduced by 50% indicating a deletion of these two  exons on one allele. This finding was validated by reverse transcriptase-PCR on  fibroblast and schwannoma cell cultures of this patient and cDNA sequencing. Our  gene dosage assay will detect deletions of one or more exons as well as gross  deletions of the whole coding region of the gene. It can complement the existing  screening methods because it is faster and easier.  DOI: 10.1016/S1525-1578(10)60014-1 PMCID: PMC1867500 PMID: 15681480 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",
